Sayings of the Gospel: And therein, Of the PURPOSES, PROMISES, and COVENANTS of
God, as by GOSPEL declared.

With, A Consideration of a QUESTION stated about FAITH.

By Thomas Moore, Senior.

Romans 15.4. Whatsoever things were written afore-time, were written for our
learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.

alley. 1656.

To such as believe the Testimony of CHRIST.
GOD having given to all men an object of Faith, Act. 17.31. Romans 16.26. Mar.
16.15. Jam. 1.18. Romans 10.10, 15. and 4.5, 22, 25.
and commanded it to be made known by the Scriptures, and preached to all
Nations for the obedience of Faith, and that believing it, which is begot
thereby, and closes therewith, so as to rest thereon for that promised, being
therefore by him called Faith; and to such Believers, Faith imputed for
Righteousness: So as it is verily true, Heb. 11.6. Ephesians. 2.17, 18. Act. 10.43.
and 13.38, 39. Romans 5.1, 2, 3, 5. Heb. 11.2. Act. 18.26. and 9.15. Romans 11.20.
Ephesians. 2.8. 1 Cor. 15.1, 4. 2 Thessalonians. 1.10. 1 Job. 5.10.
By Faith we come and approach to God, by Faith we receive remission of sins,
by Faith we are justified and approved of God, by Faith we receive the virtues
of the Sacrifice and Blood of Christ, by Faith we are sanctified and conformed
to the mind of Christ, by Faith we stand and are saved, by Faith we receive
the Testimony of Christ, and so come to have that Testimony, and therein the
holy Spirit testifying, and Christ testified of; and the Father that is in
Christ, dwelling in our heart by Faith: Ephesians. 3.17. Gal. 3.26. Hab. 2.4. Romans
1.17. Gal. 1.13. 1 John 5.4, 5. Heb. 11. all. 1 Pet. 1.5.
so as by Faith we are the Sons of God; and in all trials and temptations, by
Faith we live; yea, by Faith we have the victory over the flesh, the world and
the devil; and by Faith may be enabled to do worthily in our generations, and
be constant in all services of love, enduring through all sufferings, till we
die in the Faith, and so in the Resurrection shall receive the kingdom: for we
are kept by the power of God through Faith unto salvation: I therefore am
persuaded, it is our best service and fruit of love, Jude 20.3. 2 Timothy 4.7, 8.
Ephesians. 4.4, 5.
to edify one another in this most holy Faith; yea, and to contend for it also
against the opposers of it; and know this Faith to be one, and that there is
but one Faith, that is Faith indeed, though in time past I have conceited
diverse kinds of Faith: and now lately meeting with a Question stated, in which
are asserted two kinds of Faith, each true and real in its kind, by M. John
Owen, in his Book entitled, The Doctrine of the Saints perseverance, I was
moved in my heart to consider the same, and to answer some Expressions of his;
yet leaving the handling of the Controversy to those more fit, to whom it may
appertain; acknowledging all for Truth in his Book, that is found in the
Testimony of Christ, and stands with the Rule proposed by himself also; and
refuse the rest, according to his own counsel and direction: wherein I have
endeavored by plain Testimony and sayings of Scripture, to set forth the true
Faith in the object of it, and Grace of believing, with its efficacies, and so
to encourage men to believe, and believers to persevere. I desire the plain
Testimony of Scripture may be believed; and so far as any of us are by the
Spirit therein, brought to acknowledge Christ, and desire the exaltation of his
Name, and winning in of others thereto, and increase and growth of grace in
believers, let us keep this unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, that so,
in all our other differing apprehensions and expressions, we may so contend for
what the Scripture says, that whatever absurdity thereby, we seem to cast upon
any expressions of one another, it may be without judging or despising of one
another; taking opposed expressions, as consequences of misconception in the
fancy, and not fruits of the principle of grace in such as acknowledge Jesus
the Lord; nor judging them graceless, or having no principle of grace, because
of such an expression; that so we may do all things in charity, seeking the
edification of one another: and so I hope, if any be otherwise minded, God will
reveal the same to them; only whereto we have attained, let us walk by the
same rule of Faith and Love, and believe what Scripture testifies, and not be
waved from that, the Scriptures being able to make us wise unto salvation,
through Faith that is in Jesus Christ. And so committing my self and labor to
the Lord's gracious good pleasure, and to Believers to be tried, and received
or refused, as they are found to be agreeing or disagreeing with the plain
sayings of the Testimony of Christ, I rest

providence and for seize due to them.

and spoke of him Joh. 5.39, 40. Act. 3.22, 24.
: and He is the Brightness of the Father's Glory, and the express Image of his
Person Heb. 1.3. Col. 1.15.
, in whose Face, the Knowledge of the Glory of God shines 2 Col. 4.6.
: he received the Word of the Gospel, in which both Law and Testimony is from
the Father; and in him are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Understanding
Deuteronomy. 18.18. Isa. 42.1. and 6.1, 2, 3. Col. 2.3.
: and he spoke the words the Father gave him to speak Ioh. 3.34. ^7.16. and
12.49, 50.
, and his Record is true John 8.14.
: and he spoke of excellent things, and the opening of his Mouth was right
things; his Mouth spoke Truth, and wickedness is an abomination to his Lips;
all the words of his Mouth in Righteousness, nothing wreathed (or froward) or
perverse in them; they are all plain to him that understands, and Right to
them that find Knowledge Prove. 8.6, 7, 8, 9.
. And this Word and Gospel which he received and preached, he gave unto his
Apostles and first Witnesses, and gave them the Holy Spirit, which gave them to
understand, and receive the same John 15.16. and 17.6, 8.
. By which Spirit they had the Meaning and Mystery in them, so revealed to
them, as never was to any in any ages before John 14.26. and 16.13, 14, 15.
Col. 1.26, 27.
. And so he put, and bound, and sealed the Law and Testimony in his Disciples
Isai. 8.16. 2 Cor. 5.19.
, as in some measure he still does in them that believe 1 John 2.8. Col. 3.16.
: and this Word, Gospel and Testimony, did the Apostles preach as they had
received of the Lord, according to the Revelation of the Mystery Romans 16.25, 26
1 Cor. 11.23.
, and this with great plainness of Words, and evidence and demonstration of
Spirit and power 1 Cor. 2.4. 2 Cor. 3.12.
. And this they also writ, and left upon Record, in such plainness, that they
intended nothing, but what we in their Writings, read Phil. 3.1, 2. 2 Cor. 1.13.
; and in reading, may understand their Knowledge in the Mystery of Christ
Ephesians. 3.3, 4.
: whence Christ, that by his Spirit set them on this work, as he did the
Prophets before, and by that Holy Spirit guided them in writing, says, Have
not I written to thee excellent things in Counsels and Knowledge, that I might
make thee know the certainty of the Words of Truth, that thou might answer
the Words of Truth to them that send unto thee Prove. 22.20, 21.
? And so it is affirmed, That that which was (and is so) written, is upright,
Words of Truth, acceptable Words, and Words of delight, to receive and declare
the Mind of God in, and so fit also for the Preacher Eccles. 12.10. 2 Timothy
3.16, 17.
.

So that the Law and Testimony, as it is manifested in the first coming of
Christ, and by him given to his first Witnesses, and by them delivered and
recorded to us, is the Law and the Testimony to which we are to resort: and so
the whole Scripture as witnessing of Christ, and opened by Christ to them, and
by them to us John 5.39. Luke 24.25, 26, 27, 44, 45, 46, 47. Romans 15.3, 4, and
16.25, 26. 2 Pet. 3.2.
: for Christ spoke by his Spirit in the Ministration of Noah 1 Pet. 3.19.
, and it was the Spirit of Christ in the Prophets, that did signify to them,
when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the Glory that
should follow 1 Pet. 1.11.
; the Spirit of the Son being also the Spirit of the Father, and that by which
God ever has and does testify of his Son 1 John 5 6.
. And so God at the first, did immediately preach the Gospel in Paradise; and
after, more fully to Abraham in Canaan Genesis 3.15. and 15.5. and 17.1, 8.
, and afterward by the mouth of all his Holy Prophets Luke 1.69, 70.
, which Prophets spoke and writ as they were moved by the Holy Ghost 2 Pet.
1.21.
: whence, what the Spirit foresaw and preached, the Scripture that was written
by his Inspiration, is said to foresee and preach Genesis 12.3. with Gal. 3.8, 16.
: And what the Scripture says, the Holy Ghost is said to say Psalm. 95.7. with
Heb. 3.7.
. And we shall find many sayings in the Scriptures, both of Moses, and the
following Prophets, testifying of Jesus Christ, his coming, and sufferings, and
resurrection, and glory; setting him forth to be the great Prophet, High
Priest, and King, and God's Salvation to the end of the Earth; and, that
whoever believes in him shall not be ashamed; calling men to look to him, and
be saved. And this is the main thing to which the Scripture testifies; all
other parts and portions of Scripture, besides this plain Testimony, being
subservient, and having their tendencie to this, even to lead men to the
Knowledge and Acknowledgement of this Testimony, and so of Christ testified
therein John 5.39.
. And so,

The Genealogies from Adam to Abraham Genesis 5.1, 32. and 11.10, 26. Luke 3.
, and from Abraham to David, and from David to Christ Mat. 11, 18, 25. Luke
3.23, 32.
, are to demonstrate of whom Christ came according to the flesh, and that he is
very Man of the Seed of a Woman, etc. And also, the Love, Truth, and
Faithfulness of God in performing his Promise Act. 13.32, 33. Gal. 4.4.
.

The end of the Law given to, and by Moses, was to be a Schoolmaster to Christ
Gal. 3.24.
, and for Righteousness to have it in Christ Romans 10.4.
: the one part of the Law, that of ten Words, was to discover sin, and sentence
to death, that men might die to themselves, magnify Grace, and be quickened by
Christ, and live to him Romans 3.19, 20. and 4.15. and 5.20. Gal. 2.19, 20. and
3.19.
. The other part, that of Types and Figures, in Temple, Altar, Propitiatory,
Priests, Sacrifices, Washings, etc. To figure and shadow out the Truth, that
was to be found in Jesus, that was to come Heb. 8.5. and 9.8, 9. and 7.19.
.

And so many Metaphors and Parables had the like end, which whatever the
outside and face of the Letter was, yet their import was in their end, which
was to witness of, and lead to Christ Romans 3.21.
; in minding of whom, the meaning of all is seen; and so the things, and sense
in sayings, plain Prove. 8.9. 2 Cor. 3.13, 16, 17.
. But when Christ the Truth came, he, by completing that done in his Body, and
sending forth the Holy Ghost, opened the way into the Holiest Heb. 9.9, 15.
, revealed the Father John 1.18.
. And God has now spoken to us by his Son Heb. 1.1.
, who has filled his first Witness with the Holy Ghost, and so with Knowledge
of the Mystery of his will in all Wisdom and spiritual Prudence, and sent them
forth Act. 2. Ephesians. 1.3, 8, 9.
: and they have testified; and in their Testimony, the Holy Ghost has
testified of Christ Act. 5.32. 1 Pet. 1.12.
: and this Testimony of Christ have they preached and recorded, not in a Fable
to be Allegorized; but the very Truth concerning Jesus Christ himself 2 Pet.
1.15, 16, 17, 18.
; not in dark and parabolical Words, nor in the Wisdom of man, nor with
Rhetorical flourishes; but with simplicity and great plainness of speech 1 Cor.
1.17, 27. and 2.1, 2, 13.
, without any deceit or cloak of craft, commending themselves to every man's
conscience in the sight of God 2 Cor. 2.17. and 4.1, 2.
. So that this Gospel of Jesus Christ, as now come forth, in which is the Law
and the Testimony, to which we are to resort for Knowledge of Truth, is the
Testimony of Christ; and as it is of deep and profound Mysteries, so it is
true, verily true, and plain, without any deceit or equivocation, as is
evident. To it therefore go, etc.

CHAP. 2.
Evidences of the Truth and Plainness of this Testimony.

THat the Testimony of Christ in all the sayings thereof is true, is evident,
first, in that it came forth from Almighty God, and is the declaration of his
mind, who is the only true God, the God of Truth, even Truth it self John
17.3. 1 John 5.20. Deuteronomy. 32.1 4.
, whence it is called the Gospel of God Romans 15.16. 1 These. 2.2, 3, 8, 9.
.

Secondly, In that it testifies and sets forth Jesus Christ, who is the
Truth John 14.6.
, in whom Mercy and Truth are met Psalm. 8 5.10.
: and in that he became, has done, does, and will do, Truth is, and is
fulfilled 2 Thessalonians. 2.10, 12, 13, 14. 2 Cor. 5.21.1^0.130. 2 Pet. 1.16, 19.
Ephesians. 4.21.
; and he also sends forth the Holy Spirit, that witnesses Truth, and leads
into all Truth John 15.26. and 16.7, 13. Romans 1.3, 16. and 15.29.
, whence also this Gospel is called the Gospel of Christ.

Thirdly, in that it was inspired and witnessed by the Holy Spirit of Truth
into the Prophets and Apostles, and by them breathed forth and written, as the
Holy Spirit gave them to speak and write 1 Pet. 1.11, 12. 2 Pet. 1.21. Luke
1.70. Prove. 22.21. Romans 15 4.
. True it is, All the Holy Scripture was given, and so narrated and writ by
Divine Inspiration, and so is profitable, etc. 2 Timothy 3.16.
. But though the Narration of Sayings written in the Scriptures were by Divine
Inspiration recorded, yet are there many Sayings recorded, which in respect of
the Sayings themselves were not Divine Inspirations: but the Spirations and
Sayings, some of Satan, some of Seducers and wicked men, some of weak
Believers, some even of strong Believers tempted; which were by the Inspiration
of God given to the Writers, and so by them recorded; but not recorded as the
Inspirations of God's Mind, but as God's Declaration of the Sayings of Satan
or of Men, that we may know the subtilties of Satan, and beware; and the
seducements and evils of the wicked, and take heed; and so the weakness of
some, and frame of Spirit in others: and so such Sayings are to be taken, as
God's Declarations of the Deeds and Sayings of others, to warn, instruct us,
etc. but not as his own Sayings, to be received, obeyed, and built on as true
and good; that would be an abuse of them. But as for the Gospel it self (that
is, the Testimony of Christ) even All of it, was not only narrated by Divine
Inspiration, or given of God by Inspiration to be narrated, as those things
that were indeed spoken or done by Satan, or wicked or weak men: But as the
very Things, Sayings, Spirations, and Inspirations of God himself, of his own
Mind; and so it is Divine Truth, Divine Spiration, divinely inspired, as well
as by Divine Inspiration written and recorded; and therefore True: not only
true it was so said and done, for so were all the other sayings; but true in it
self; yea, Truth, and the Revealer of the Mind of Truth it self.

Fourthly, the Gospel and Testimony of Christ, is a full and perfect Truth, in
all that it narrateth, and in all that it affirms, and in all that it
promises, containing the Declaration of the whole Truth, that is for natural
Men or Believers to know, believe, or do in the worship of God, or toward the
Conversion and Salvation of Men; yea, even to make the Man of God himself
perfect to every good Work John 15.15. Act. 20.26. Micah 6.8. 2 Pet. 1.12, 16.
2 Timothy 3.16.
. And therefore we are bounded up to it Isa. 8.20. Gal. 1.6, 12.
, without adding or diminishing Deuteronomy. 12.32. Rev. 22.18, 19.
; there being no Morning-light in any Spirit, Doctrine, Saying, or Doing, that
is not in, and according to this Testimony, it being the Truth, and Discoverer
of, and Guide to all Truth, and Trier of all things Ephesians. 5.13.
; it being true in Christ, and of Christ, and from him to men, and for men,
whether men believe it or not Joh. 8.40, 45, 46. 1 These. 2.10, 12. 2 Timothy 2.13.
and 4.4.
. And as it is true in and of Christ, and to and for men; so it is true in
Believers also, so as they discern, and experiment, and testify the Truth
thereof 1 John 2.8, 20, 27. 2 John 2. 3 John 3 John 3.33.
: and so this Gospel is most rightly called the Word of Truth 2 Cor. 6.7. Col.
1.5.
; yea, the Truth 2 Cor. 12.
.

Fifthly, the Testimony of Christ (which is in the Gospel) is the Spirit of
Prophecy Rev. 19.10.
: it is the Original, the Spring, Teacher, and Guide to all right understaing
of Truth, and for speaking Truth to Men, in Charity, and to Edification, and
Exhortation, and Comfort 1 Cor. 14.1, 3. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15, 19, 21.
; yea, this Testimony of Jesus believed, is verily, 1. Both the Opener of
Truth, and of the Understanding to discern Truth, as pointed out both in the
end of the Law, and in Types, Parables, and dark Sayings; and also, as set
forth in Prophecies; in which, attending to this Testimony, minding and
believing it, it will make all Wisdom's Sayings plain, and open the meaning and
rightness of them Joh. 12.36, 46. Prove. 1.3, 7. and 2.2, 7. and 8.9. Joh. 1.18.
and 14.7. 1 John 2.20, 27.
. 2. It has its meaning in it self, and the same is in its Discovery,
according to the plain import of its Sayings: it abhors all Equivocations,
dissembling, and pretending any Love or good will, more then really is Prove.
8.6, 7, 8. and 26.24, 26.
. 3. It has Evidences and Demonstrations of Wisdom, Power, and Goodness, and
Motives unmatchable, to draw to the Belief of its Testimony 1 John 5.6, 9, 10.
Romans 5.6, 8. Act. 5.32. and 11.21.
. 4. It is the Instrument and Medium, by which the Holy Ghost convinces of
sin, unbelief, and error Joh. 15.15. and 8.7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
, and brings the convinced in to Believe and love the Truth James 1.18. 1
John 3.19.
, and leads Believers into all Truth Joh. 16.13, 14
: and he that believes this Testimony, believes the Truth; and it being in
them, and they living according to it, they are of the Truth 1 John 3.19.
, and in the Truth 1 John 2.5. 2 John 4.
, and the Truth is in them 1 John 1.8. and 2.4. 3 John 3.
; and such as teach it, are Ministers of the Truth Romans 15.8. 2 Timothy 2.15.
; and such as acknowledge, profess and obey it, do acknowledge, profess and
obey the Truth Heb. 10.26. 1 Pat. 1.22. 2 John 4. 3 John 3
; and such as turn from it, turn from the Truth 2 Timothy 4.4.
; and such as oppose, deny, and resist it, do oppose, deny and resist the Truth
2 Cor. 13.8. 2 Timothy 3.8.
.


So that we are well directed for knowing of Truth, to the Law and to the
Testimony, in which Truth is, and all the sayings thereof are true; yea, all
the sayings in Scripture, as they witness of this Testimony, and are opened by
this Testimony, and agree in one with this, are true; and not only true, but
they are also exceeding plain, as may be seen in that foresaid.

1. In that God and Christ have affirmed these sayings to be not only true,
but also plain and right Prove. 8.6, 9. Isa. 45.19. Eccles. 12.10.
. 2. In that he affirms the end for which he has written them, to be, that
we might know the certainty of the words of Truth Prove. 22.20, 21 Luke 1.3, 4.
Ephesians. 4.3, 4. Romans 15.4.
. 3. In that our Savior directs and commands for knowing and finding
Truth, to search the Scriptures Joh. 5.39.
, to mind what is written, and how we read in the Law and Testimony Luke
10.26. Isa. 8.20.
, and to apply the Ear to his Knowledge, and so the Heart to the Words of the
Wise, that have written by his Spirit Prove. 22.17, 18, 20.
. 4. In that our Savior promises blessedness to such as believe on him as the
Scripture has said John 7.38.
, avouching all that keep not his sayings (that do not Believe, Love and hold
to his sayings) to be no Lovers of him Joh 14.28.
. 5. In the Profession of those inspired with the Holy Ghost, in the knowledge
of the things of Christ, that they spoke them in the wisdom and words which the
Spirit gave them to speak Act. 2.4. 1 Cor. 2.12, 13.
; and this sincerely, without craft, in all plainness 1 Cor. 2.17. and 4.2. 2
Cor. 3.12.
, and not with a veil over their face. 6. In the confession of those that have
believed this Testimony, that his Word is true, very pure Psalm. 119.160, 140,
130. Eccles. 12.10.
, and brings Light, and gives Understanding to the simple. 7. The Title put
on this Testimony; as, The Word of Truth, the Scripture of Truth Col. 1.5. Dan.
10.21.
. 8. The Commendation and Approbation of such as are diligent in searching the
Scripture, to see what is Truth, and take heed to the Word of Prophecy, as to
a Light Act. 17.11. 2 Pet. 1.19.
.
Now if the sayings of the Gospel in the Testimony of Christ have not the sense
they naturally and plainly import; where then is the Truth of God and Christ
his Affirmation, or the fitness in his words for his ends, to give the
certainty of the Knowledge of Truth? or what Profit in following his direction
in searching the Scripture? or where is the Truth of this Promise, or of the
Prophets and Apostles Protestation, or of the Title of the Gospel? or why are
any commended for searching it? If it have not the sense it imports in its
own sayings, who then shall tell us the sense? what Man, what Apostle, what
Angel, or what Spirit, when we are warned to hear none, that speak other or
beside that by these before already preached and written, who have professed
also before God, That they did not lie in the things they writ: and God has
born Testimony of them? Gal. 1.6, 9, 12, 20. Heb. 2.4.
So that their sayings in this Testimony, are true and plain, and have the
sense they plainly import; and what the Prophets and Apostles have spoke and
writ of this Testimony, God has spoken by them; and if we believe God to be
true, and love him, then will we believe and love his sayings: and so to the
Law and to the Testimony, for the discerning of every Whisper, Spirit,
Doctrine, Opinion and Saying; and if they speak not according to that Word,
there is no Morning-Light in them: wherefore let God be true, and justify him
in his sayings; and let every man, whisper, Romans 3.4. Eccles. 12.10.
Doctrine or Spirit, that speaks not according to his sayings, be to us a
liar; knowing his Words are true, upright and plain, though the wisdom of the
flesh be enmity to them; whose oppositions I will endeavor to remove.

CHAP. 3.
Of the Enmity of Flesh and Satan to Him.

THe carnal Mind, or Wisdom of the Flesh, is Enmity against God Romans 8.7.
; so that the natural Man having no other but the Wisdom of Men, the Wisdom of
this World, though never so learned, wise and prudent, does not approve or
receive the things of the Spirit, or his sayings, but accounts them Foolishness
1 Cor. 1.18, 19, 20. and 2.5, 6, 41.
. And among the rest, in this one thing, has this Enmity appeared, in that it
accounts light of the sayings of the Spirit of God in the Scripture, and of
that Knowledge given in the plain Testimony thereof Jer. 8.9.
; and pretends in its fleshly Mind, to a farther and better knowing Job 11.11,
12. Col. 2.18.
, by which it presumes to understand, and to amend, and contradict the plain
Sayings of God; and to frame sayings, better, truer, and safer for Men to
believe and receive Job 4.17, 18, 19. Isa. 40.2, 8. Isa. 40.13, 14.
. In which, thinking to be wise, they become most foolish, and their Wisdom and
their Knowledge perverteth them Romans 1.22. 1 Cor. 3.19, 20. Isa. 47.10.
, or else such filth and blasphemy would never come out of their Mouths, much
less have been set forth by their Pens, as to say, That the Scripture contains
not all things necessary to Salvation; That it is full of Obscurity, a killing
Letter, a dumb Judge, inky Divinity, a Nose of Wax, that may be bended any way;
That every Heretic proves his Heresy by Scripture; and, That the Scripture is
fitted to the time, and variably understood: so that the sense thereof is one
while this, another while that, according as the Church is pleased to change
her Judgment in determining the sense; and, That the Gospel was written, not
to rule our Faith, but to be ruled by it: and so though a Point of Faith be
affirmed never so plainly in Scripture, yet it is but sub judice, and doubtful,
without a higher Determination; though herein be Difference among them, who
shall give that Determination: some say, The Pope; some say, A Council; some
say, The Pope and the Council, both consenting; some say, A Synod or
Convocation of learned and holy Men; some say, This gathered Assembly or
Congregation; some, That; and some say, Humane Reason in a Logical Discourse;
and some say, The infallible Spirit in this or that Man. And thus do they draw
Men from God and his Word, rejecting that as of none effect, occasioning
divisions and contentions without number: and so, in multiplying Sects, not
only seducements from the Faith, but wars and ruins are like to follow.

And Satan that takes advantage from the Flesh to rule in the Hearts of
Unbelievers, is always at hand, subtle, and diligent to set forward this evil
business; and he will abuse Reason, and use subtle and provoking Motives; yea,
and bring Scripture Sentences, with some word subtly left out; and also, vent
Spirations with boldness, though false: yea, pretend to move to confidence in
God, (though out of his way) and to help one to a better condition; yea, he
attempted this where he had no advantage Mat. 4.3, 9. Luke 4.2, 11.
: how much more will he do it where he has the advantage of corrupt Flesh to
work upon? yea, to keep his possession by some unclean lust, or to disturb the
proceedings of Truth; he can transform himself into an Angel of Light, and
confess Jesus to be the Holy One of God Mark 1.23, 24. and 3.11.
, and pretend to help Believers in Christ to a better condition 2 Cor. 11.3, 14
; and he can teach his Ministers to do the same and much more, to maintain some
false Doctrine, or keep the hold of a false Spirit, to rent the Union, and
disturb the Faith and Fellowship of the Saints, and yet be counted of that
Number: and for this end, to make Confession of the Truth, and give an
Honorable Testimony to the Servants of the Truth, and yet vaunt of some higher
things to lead men to Act. 16.16, 17, 18. Phil. 1.15, 16. 2 Cor. 11 13, 14,
15.18.
. Thus busy is Satan, ruling in the Wisdom of the Flesh; whence, the Wisdom of
the Flesh, and so all carnal Men, are full of oppositions against the plain
Testimony of Scripture, yea, sometimes some, in some measure gracious, are yet
by Satan and his Instruments, and the remaining Flesh in them, in some measure
tainted: so, as from many Men we have many Objections against the plain sayings
of the Gospel, and the plain appearing sense imported by them. And
notwithstanding all said in the Scriptures quoted in the first and second
Chapters, yet will they neither give that Glory to God themselves, to believe
him on his word; nor suffer those that do, to be at rest, but seek to trouble
and unsettle them many ways; and the ways by which they endeavor to trouble
Believers, are especially three: first, by Spirit, or pretense of Inspiration,
and speaking from an infallible Spirit. Secondly, by Word, in Queries, or
subtle Reasonings, and Philosophical Disputes. Thirdly, by pretense of
Scripture, alleging it with some addition, or diminution, or wresting: of all
which, we are forewarned to beware 1 John 4 1. Col. 2, 8. 2 These. 2.2.
. I shall endeavor to remove the most usual Objections, which each of them do
make.

CHAP. 4.
An Assay to remove the Objections of those that pretend Spirit, come clothed
with Pretense of Inspiration and Zeal.

YOu have nothing but Letter, what you read in other Men's Writings; but I have
the Spirit, the infallible Spirit: God has inspired this to me, and it is God
within me, that speaks by me, and that I speak is the true Sense and Mind of
God; your Sense imported by the Letter is carnal, and fleshly, and of Man, and
so not the true Sense.

he that speaks of himself, seeks his own glory John 7.18.
; and, not he that commends himself, but he whom God commends is approved 2
Cor. 10.18.
. 2. Your bearing witness of your self, makes you like the Heathen Idols Isa.
44.9.
, and your witness not true Joh. 5 31, 32.
; and coming in your own Name, pretending the Name of Christ, as if you were
Christ, declares you to be a false Apostle or Prophet John 5.43. and 7.18. Mat.
24.5 24.
. 3. For the true Christ, full of, and led by the Holy Ghost, gave every Answer
to the Tempter, with, Thus it is written Mat. 4. Luke 4.
; and directed all his Hearers to search the Scriptures: and the true Apostles,
though filled with the Holy Ghost, yet did magnify the Scriptures fore-written
and proved, and made known all their Doctrine by them, according to the Command
of God Gal. 1.8, 16. Romans 16.25, 26. Act. 17.2, 3. and 18.28. and 26.22, 23.
. And that Spirit, or that Man pretending Spirit, which hears not (submits
not to believe, obey, and be determined by) the Doctrine and Saying of the
Prophets and Apostles, is not of God 1 John 4.6. 2 Pet. 3.2.
.
Wherefore that Spirit that speaks of himself, is not of God; for the Holy
Spirit never speaks of himself, but he witnesses of Christ, and shows and
teaches the things of him; and that in bringing to remembrance the Sayings of
Christ by himself or his Spirit in the Prophets that were written, and he had
before taught his Apostles, that they might witness them to us, and we believe
through their word Joh. 16.13. and 14.26. Luke 24.25, 26, 44, 45, 47. Joh.
17.20.
.

And those that by Faith do know, That the world was made by God Heb. 11.1, 2.
, and that it is preserved and upheld by God through Christ Psalm. 35.3. Col.
1.17.
; and that the Scripture was given by Inspiration of God 2 Timothy 3.16.
; and Christ sent forth, and to have done all things according to the Scripture
Act. 13.32, 33. and 3.24. and 4.25 28. Romans 1.1, 2, 3
; they know also, That what the Scripture says, the Holy Ghost says the same
Gal. 3.8. Heb. 3.7.
; and what the Holy Ghost has once said and testified as true in Christ, he
never alters that Testimony, but breaths in it still; and so wherever
written, that remains Truth: which proves this Objection vain.

You understand not our meaning: for we do believe in, and magnify Christ and
the Scripture, as much as you do; but we have Christ and the Scripture within
us; and we believe that, and speak that from inward and experimental Knowledge,
and the infallible Spirit, and that we speak is the Mind of God: but you
believe in and magnify a Christ without you, and so believe and speak of, and
from the Scripture that is without you; and so the true Sense and Mind of God
which is infallible, and from Christ and the Scripture within, is to you a
Parable; and all you hold and believe is but fleshly and fallible.



For, 1. By Christ in whom we believe, we mean not, An Imagination or Frame;
but, the second public Man, the spiritual Man, who not only out of us, but
before we in our Persons were, and without any Motion or In-being in us, did
himself take our Nature, being conceived by, and born of a Woman, a Virgin,
that was of the natural Seed and Lineal Descent of David, and Abraham, and
Adam; and so took a personal Body of his own, in which he bore our sins on the
Tree, and was made a Curse, and died for us, and overcame Death, and shook off
all Mortality without seeing corruption in that Body, in which being buried, he
rose again, and appeared to, and conversed with his Disciples, and then in
their sight departed from them out of this World in that risen Body, and so
ascended into Heaven, and offered himself a sacrifice to God, and sat down on
his right Hand; and in that now glorified Body remains in Heaven a great High
Priest, appearing before God ever-living to intercede for us. This is The
Christ our Savior, not to come to take flesh, nor so coming, nor so in us: he
has done that already he was to do in his own Body for us, and can die no
more, but is alive for evermore, immeasurably filled with Spirit to send forth
to us. The right knowing of him, is the original and right way of knowing all
things; and right knowing and worshipping of God, is in the Confession of him,
thus to be already come in the flesh; 1 John 4.3.
and that Spirit that denies this, is the Spirit of Antichrist; and he that
denies that This Jesus is The Christ, he is Antichrist, 1 John 2.22, 23.
and denies the Father and the Son.

And whoever believes in This Jesus, receives of his Spirit, which imprinteth
his Word, and frames his Mind in his Heart, enriching him with his
Consolations; and so by Word, Col. 1.25, 26, 27
and Spirit, and Riches of Grace, (and not in bodily presence) is Christ in
Believers; and in so being in them, he is to them the Hope of Glory.

But whoever believes not in this Christ without them, and receives not the
Efficacies and Frames within, from the excellency of the knowledge of, and
Belief in him without, so as he that is without in bodily presence, is within
by spiritual presence; but come to undervalue him as without them, and magnify
something within them: All that within, is but mere delusion, which the ensuing
Discourse will further show: so that the voice of this Objection being so
strange, the sheep will not hear it.

2. And as for the Scripture, we mean not by Scripture, Ink and Paper, nor
Letters of A, B, C, etc. nor Syllables and particular Words, nor Writing, or
Printing, or a Book bound up in Leaves, or rolled in Parchment. But that we
mean by Scripture, is not the writing, but the thing written; not barely the
words, but the thing sounded forth and imported to us in the words. And so the
Almighty God, that is Eternal, without Beginning, before all Things, and
without End, Omnipotent, Omniscient, Infinite, and Immutable, the Creator of
all things; and his only Son, that was in the Beginning, and from Eternity
with him, by whom he made all things, and whom he sent forth made of a Woman,
and so Man, the essential Word; and the Holy Ghost proceeding from the Father
and the Son, the infallible Spirit that witnesses the Mind of God: This one
God, Three in One, and this Mind made known to Men, the Manifestation and
making it known, is the Instrumental Word of God, whether inspired, spoken or
written. And of this God and his Mind it is, as so made known, that we mean;
and when it is once by his Command and Inspiration, written, and put on record
for us, to make known his Mind to us, Prove. 22.20, 21
as now it is, then is all this called Scripture; and so when God had once by
his Spirit preached the Gospel to Abraham, this being after written by Moses,
is since called Scripture. Now it was not Moses his Writing that did foresee
and preach, nor the Book, or Letters, or Words written therein: but the Spirit
in that Testimony did foresee and preach; which being Written, and left on
Record, is therefore called Scripture. Gal. 3.8.
And when the Holy Ghost had in and by David said to the People, To day if you
will hear my voice, harden not your hearts; This being once written, and left
on Record for Generations following, Psalm. 95.7.
the Holy Ghost is said wherever that Scripture is given, still to say it.
And to those to whom no probability that that particular Word was inspired into
every of them, Heb. 3.7.
which was so given to Israel and Joshua, Deuteronomy. 13.6, 8. yet it being after
written and left upon Record for his peoples use, it is said to them many
Generations after, Heb. 13.5.
He has said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee: yea, that which God
spoke to Moses in the Bush, our Savior, it being written, Exodus 3.6.
said to the corrupt and erroneous Sadduces, Have not you read that which was
spoken by God to you, saying, Mat. 22.31, 32
I am the God, etc. And so the Spirit in the Apostles teaches us, That
whatsoever things were written aforetime, Romans 15.4.
were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
Scripture might have hope. Surely, this written aforetime, so long before we
were, was written without us; yea, without even those of us to whom that
sentence was written, and therefore written without in Leaves, that they might
have recourse to it, and learn it, and love it, and so have it within; which
true Believers then had, and now have, that, for their good, Phil. 31. 1 John
1.3, 4. and 5.13. and 2.20, 26, 27.
written without; by the Holy Spirit, in believing, putting it in their Mind
and Heart, written within; and yet the same and more increased within, by use
of that without; and so, that both without and within fenceth us against
Seducers.

And this gracious God in Christ, with his gracious Mind, as made known and
written, is that we call Scripture, be it written or printed over and over, in
Hebrew, Greek, Latin, English, or any Language, be it in Paper or Parchment,
in Tables, Rolls, or Books. This, not the Writing, but the Thing written, we
mean by Scripture. And now God has been so gracious, to cause the great things
of his Law to be written to us, and then called Scripture; shall we, because of
the meanness of a Scribe, the homeliness of the Letter, and commonness of the
Books in which it is conveyed to us, contemn and despise it, and call it
Letter, Ink, and Paper, and Scripture without us, and so count it as a strange
thing? surely then, this will be charged on us as a great sin, Hos. 8.12. Joh.
12.47, 48.
and a rejecting of his Word; and that Word without us, despised by us, and
therefore not within us, shall yet judge us at the last day.

As for any other Scripture within us, then this Testimony of Christ and God's
gracious Mind in him, that is written in the Scripture that is without us, we
desire not: but to have this written without, to be enlightened to our hearts;
and in understanding, believing, loving or retaining the same, to have it by
the same Spirit that first testified it, to be testified and written in our
heart within us, so as our hearts be framed into the same Mind and design with
God and Christ; so we desire it more and more written within. Genesis 8.21. Jer.
17.9.
But wheresoever this Testimony of Christ that is written without, is slighted,
and that is not it within, Prove. 28.26. Isa. 8.20.
as is said, All within is filthy and deceitful: and he is a fool that trusts
his own heart, or a Spirit of falsehood, when God has given us so good a Law
and Testimony to resort unto.

Whatever it be that is written, yet the Letter is dead and kills, and it is
the Spirit that quickens.

Cor. 3.5, 6. Our sufficiency is of God, who also has made us able Ministers
of the New Testament; not of the Letter, but of the Spirit: for the Letter
kills, but the Spirit gives life. Now all that is objected against the
liveliness and plainness of the Gospel in this place, lies in these two words,
Letter and Spirit; which if right understood, according to Scripture Language
and import, clears all, and shows the Objection forceless. Consider it:

1. By Letter is not here meant, A, B, C, etc. opposed to a blank without such
Letters, or to a breath without a Sound; the word Letter is not so used in any
Doctrine of Law or Gospel: nor yet by Letter is meant Syllables and Words,
written and read over, and spoken, opposed to some secret and insensible
conveyance of the Mind to the inward Spirit; Scripture does not so use the
word Letter: nor yet is by Letter here meant the outward sound of the words in
Ministration of them, by reading, speaking, or receiving them, in hearing and
understanding them, according to the outward import of the words.

But by Letter is evident to be meant the Thing it self that was written in the
Law of works to be done under a penalty, and the so doing of it: and so the
Apostle, in reproof of the Jewish Zealots that boasted much of their keeping
the Law, used the word Letter, Romans 2.17, 24.
to signify the Law of Works, Circumcision being that outward Covenant, in
which, all that came to be of Abraham's Family, were obliged to wait on God in
use of all Ordinances given: though Circumcision was before Moses, Gal. 3.4.
and so not of Moses; yet when God gave the Law to Moses, and by Moses to the
People, then Circumcision did still oblige all the circumcised, to observe all
the Ordinances given them by Moses, called the Law: and none but the
circumcised had Liberty to have Fellowship with them in the use of those
Ordinances: whence all that people, Exodus 12.48. Ephesians. 2.11, 12. Romans 15.8.
Ephesians. 2.11. Gal. 5.6, 11. and 6.15.
which did so worship God, were called, The Circumcision; and all the outward
Duties, in that outward Worship and Ceremony, together in one, called,
Circumcision. And this outward Circumcision is plainly said to be that of the
Letter, Romans 2.27, 29.
and opposed to that of the Spirit; whence also, it is opposed to Faith in
Christ, according to the Gospel; which Grace given and received, freeth us from
the Bondage of that Law, Romans 7.6.
that we may serve in newness of Spirit, and not in the oldness of the Letter:
Romans 8.2.
In which sense, the Gospel, that is, the Law of the Spirit, is opposed to this
Law of Works, called, The Law of Sin and Death. And it is before shown, That
this Law was given to discover Sin, and sentence to death, that Men might be
driven to Christ; and so its End was to Life, but to Life in a killing way;
Death by this Law, and Life in Christ, for whom it fitted, and to whom it led.

Now consider, That as the Apostle says not, The Letter of the New Testament,
whose very outward Sound is of Life; but, The Letter: so it was not a dead
Letter that killed, or could kill: it was not Words, writ, read, spoken or
heard only; but the Things imported therein, Romans 2.17, 18, 19. and 9.31, 32.
and 10.1, 2, 3. Phil. 3.2, 3, 7. John 5.45.
understood and minded, that did discover to them their Duty, and move them to
set on the Performance: yet when they did this to get Righteousness, and be
Righteous in, they went wrong, and their Works were but dead Works, their
conceited Life thereby a Deceit, and they still Dead, though trusting in the
Letter, or those Duties doing, still swerving from the end for which the Law or
Letter was given; and this was Confidence in the Flesh: For God's end in giving
that Letter or Law, Gal. 2.21.
was not to make them Righteous by it, but to discover sin, and sentence them
to death, that so they might be enlivened by Christ: in respect of which
gracious end of God, and the Tendency of the Letter or Law thereto, it is
affirmed in the Ministration, To have been glorious, and also profitable, Romans
7.7, 13. 2 Cor. 3 7. Romans 2.25.
if so observed; for so it ministered sin in discovery of it, and death in the
sentence; and so kills, that in that way they might be brought to Life, not
by it, but by Christ typed out in one part of this Law; and so, and to this
end, the Letter kills, yet this killing and death that fitteth for life in
Christ, was not effected by a dead Letter, or by Words, or Sound heard only,
but by some gracious operation of God therein, minding them of, and opening
their Understandings to discern their sinfulness, and submitting their Hearts
to say Amen to the Curse, and helping them in Observance of the Rites, to look
to Christ to come; that so, having no hope in their own Observances, being in
that respect dead also, they saw the end of the Law to lead them to Christ: And
this was the right use of the Letter, and the Work of God, by, and with the
Letter, in this killing way to fit them for Life. But this Medium and Way of
killing to prepare for Life, God was not minded always to use: but as it was
given 430 years after the Covenant made with Abraham, Gal. 3.16, 17, 19, 20, 25.
to whom the Seed, and Blessing in that Seed was promised; so it was to
continue but till Christ that Seed came: so that this Law ministered by Moses,
appears all the way in every place speaking of this business, and in this very
2 Cor. 3. to be meant by Letter: for that Law in Ministration of it, was the
Ministration of sin and of death, or condemnation for sin to death; and that to
so gracious an end, as is said: whence said to be glorious, and yet to be done
away.

2. By Spirit, is not here meant simply and only a supernatural shine and
infusion of Divine Power and Spirit into the Hearts of Men, creating a new and
living Spirit, even the Epistle, or Mind of Christ in the Heart, a living
Principle, springing up in living and quickening Efficacies: by Spirit is not
meant this only, but the Gospel, through which this was conveyed; for they by
whom this Epistle was ministered, in respect whereof, they were Ministers of the
Spirit, and their Ministration, of Life: That which they did Minister, was the
Epistle of Christ, Mat. 22.20. John 14.17, 18. and 25.26, 27.
even the Gospel, as come forth and witnessed by the Holy Ghost since his
Ascension; in Ministration whereof, Christ, according to his Promise, is
present with them by his Spirit; and his Work it is in their Ministration, to
send forth of his Spirit: so as the Ministration of the Epistle of Christ, the
Words of Christ, which are Spirit and Life, is their Work; but the Supernatural
Shine, Infusion and Writing the Mind of Christ in the Heart, is the very Work
of the Holy Ghost from Christ himself, though in their Ministration, and in,
with, and through the Gospel ministered by them; which distinction is here given
us by the Apostle himself in this 2 Cor. 3.2, 3. and in diverse other places 1
Cor. 3.5, 6, 7. Gal. 3.2. Ephesians. 4.21. Act. 11.21.
. So that by the Spirit is here meant the Gospel, yet the Gospel in a peculiar
sense: for Moses preached the Gospel also, even the same Gospel, although not
in the same Manner, and Spirit also went forth in the Ministration of the
Gospel, as delivered by Moses: Romans 10.6, 7, 8. Act. 3.22, 26
but they to whom it was so preached, were still under the Law, and had the Law
to convince them of sin, and the Law to lead them in Observances to look to
Christ: so that the Gospel was also preached with and under the Law or Letter,
which was the first, and now Old Testament: But now that Christ is come, and
Truth fulfilled in him Joh. 1.14, 16, 17, 18.
, that Use of the Law enjoined to the Jews, is taken away, and in the Gospel
preaching, Life is preached with Freedom 2 Cor. 3.11. Act. 5.20.
in a Word of Grace; in, and with which believed, the Spirit operateth, both to
convince of Sin, and to lead into Christ, and so into all Truth John 16.7, 17
Heb. 8.10.
, and write the Mind of Christ in the Heart. And this is the New Testament of
which the Apostles were Ministers; and according to which, with Freedom and
Fullness they preached the Gospel and Testimony of Christ. And so of this
Testimony of Christ, was Paul and the residue of the Apostles and first
Witnesses, made Ministers Act. 26.18. Romans 15.16. Ephesians. 3.7. Col. 1.23.
. And this Gospel being testified, and brought forth by the Holy Spirit 1 John
5.6. Act. 5.32.
; and being that, in Ministration whereof, the Holy Spirit witnesses Joh.
15.26, 27 and 16.7, 8, 13.
, and so the Gospel, the Power of God in every one that believes to Salvation,
working in and with it in the Believer Romans 1.16. 1 These. 2.13.
, it therefore has the Name of the Spirit John 3.6. Rev. 19.10.
, and so is rightly called Spirit; yea, it is the Spirit of Prophecy, and this
Testimony of Christ is of him, and that which abides for ever; and this
Ministration of it, to abide till his own personal coming again, and so is a
more glorious Ministration than that of Moses, which is done away; that having
also a veil, but this delivered without veil: and this to be meant by Spirit,
is seen in the whole Chap. of this 2 Cor. 3. And this Testimony of Christ is
one and the same, whether writ, printed, read, preached or heard; and so not
Letter, but Gospel; ministering, not Sin and Death, but Forgiveness and Life,
whether Men believe and receive it or not John 6.32. Act. 13.37, 18.
. And it is a kind of Blasphemy to call this Gospel Letter, much more to call
it a killing Letter; the Gospel in Moses Ministration, was not so called, but,
The Law; much less may it now be so called: it is a Word of Life; and they that
refuse it, refuse Life; and the refusal brings death: though only Believers
receive and meet with the spiritual Power, and living Efficacies thereof 2
These. 1.8, 10. 2 These. 2.13.
; so that quite contrary to the end of the Objection, we are led by this place
to magnify the Gospel and Testimony of Christ, for the Truth, Livingness,
Excellency and Plainness thereof.

And thus much to take away that by which these most dangerous troublers of
Believers, endeavor to withdraw them from believing the plain import of the
plain sayings of Christ in Scripture.

CHAP. 5.
An Assay to remove the Stumbling Blocks laid in the way by them that seek to
trouble them by Word, that is, by pleading the Judgment and Traditions of
Forefathers, or by Philosophy and vain Reasonings, or by subtle and Rhetorical
Queries and Persuasions, to draw them from belief of Gospel-sayings.

OUr Fathers, the Holy and learned Men, and chief Teachers in the Church, have
thus understood and interpreted; these have been their Doctrines and
Traditions, which they have unanimously taught; and the most zealous and
conscientious for many Generations, have so held and observed: will you be so
profane to turn aside therefrom; so proud, to think you know more and better
than all these; so singular from all other Men in your Opinion and Way? know
you not it will be an Offense to our learned Men and Teachers, and lay a
blemish on them and our Forefathers, as if they were mistaken, and did err?

Mat. 5.21.22, 39. Mar. 10.3, 9.
: and so he has likewise taught us, That it is in vain, and makes the Word and
Sayings of God of none effect, to teach, and believe, and worship God, with,
and by the Doctrines, Traditions, and Opinions of Men, that are not in the
Sayings of God, and so not of him, but of men; how many, learned, holy, or
ancient soever they appear Isa. 29.14. Mat. 15.1, 9. Mar. 7.1, 14.
.

And he has likewise taught us, That every Plant which our Heavenly Father
has not planted, must be plucked up; and God's own Sayings Believers are to
justify, whoever be thereby found a liar, letting such liars alone, not being
troubled with fear of offending them, because they be blind leaders of the
blind Mat. 15.13, 14. and 11.19. Romans 3.4.
.

The Jews of old were commended for observing the plain Words and Sayings of
the Law, though many right holy Men for diverse Generations before, had not done
so exactly according to the plain saying of the Law Neh. 8.14, 15, 16, 17.
; yea, the Priests and Scribes of the Jews in Herod's time, when they answered
a Question with a plain saying of Scripture, erred not in the Answer given Mat.
2.5, 6.
: so victorious is the Truth in its own sayings.

Nor is it Pride, or sinful Singularity, or just cause of Offense to any, to
believe the Sayings of God to be true, whoever be reproved as a liar thereby;
but rather true Humility, in laying aside our own Wisdom, and desire of Repute
with humane Rabbis; and it is Obedience to God in justifying him in his
Sayings, which are never rightly understood but in believing them 1 Cor. 3.18,
19, 20. Romans 3.4.
: so that he that believes the plain sayings in the Testimony of Christ, to be
true, will not hearken to, or be waved by this Objection.

It is not like, yea, not possible, yea, against Reason, That Moses should
speak of so low a business, as the Creation of this visible World, with visible
Heaven, Earth, and Creatures; or, That from one Man and one Woman the World
should be so people'd by Noah 's time: or, That eight Persons, with Creatures
of all kinds should be preserved a whole year, in such an Ark as is mentioned,
when all the World of Mankind and other Creatures besides should be drowned:
or, That if the World were so drowned, that it should be so people'd and
inhabited so fully by Abraham 's time: or, That there should be Three in One
God, and yet God but One: or, That God, in the Person of his Son, should become
Man: or, That that Man should be God, and yet die; or if, as Man, he died, that
that very Body that died should be risen again, and ascended into Heaven, and
remain so long in the Heavens: or, That by his Death and Righteousness, other
Men should be saved: or, That if there be such a thing as Eternal Salvation, if
God made all Men, and Christ died, and gave himself a Ransom for All, that All
should not be Eternally saved: or, That there should be a Resurrection of all
the Bodies that have died since Adam 's time, etc.

Prove. 26.4. and 14.7. Isa. 36.21
: yet because many devise Allegories, to make them true in an Allegorical
Sense, thereby to color their Atheism and Unbelief, and pretend a Fancy of
higher things, though they are vain Fancies and Dreams; Prove. 26.5.
we may give an Answer beside plain Denial, which yet were enough: And so it is
answered, That however Types, and Shadows, and Parables might be Allegorized to
an Agreement in a spiritual sense, with the substance of Truth shadowed and
typed, Col. 2.17. 2 Pet. 1 16. and 2.1, 2, 18. Jude 12.
yet the Truth it self is no Type or Shadow, no Fable, nor can there be any
higher Business; so, as it admits not of Allegorizing: and such as fancy
Allegories, to show something more high and spiritual, their Allegories are
vain Dreams, Fancies, mere Wind and Vanity. As for others not so far departed
from the Faith, that yet not believing the extent of God's own Sayings about
his own Works of Creation, Redemption, and Extention of means, that men might
partake of Redemption, etc. who, to color their Unbelief, bring in Foreign
Senses, and limiting Interpretations, as if the words of a Man, concerning the
work of a Man; and not the Words of God, concerning the Works of God: and so
where he faith, All men, every man, they gloss it, Some of all sorts; if he
say, The world, and The whole world, they will gloss it, The world of the
Elect. Whereas, in a saying that is of God and his works, if general and large,
and no saying of his contradicting it at any time, there can be no limitation:
let not mortal Man presume to be wiser than his Maker. But our Savior's Answer
may serve for all these, who tells us, That Unbelief and Ignorance of the
Scripture and of the Power of God, is the cause of all such Errors Mat. 22.29.
and Mat. 12.24.
, and disables to give any right Interpretation Allegorical or Logical.

You have the Scripture but in a Translation, and have not sufficient Words to
import the full sense of many Words in your Language, which the Hebrew and
Greek, the Original in which the Scriptures were writ, do import; therefore the
sayings are not plain to you that understand not the original Tongues.

viz.

1. That all words are not in every sentence to be taken according to the full
extent of the Etymology of the word: as, where it is said, Our Savior will
come, as a Thief Rev. 16.15.
; as is not meant in the full, and in every respect as a Thief; for Christ will
not come unjustly, to take that is none of his, etc. but only suddenly, etc.
Mat. 24.44.
. So the word Not in some sentences signifies, not at all Exodus 20.13, 17.
Mat. 5.28. Romans 7.7.
; in other sentences it signifies, not so much, not so primely 1 Cor. 1.17,
16, 15.
; and in some sentences it signifies, not only, but moreover John 16 26. with
14.16.
; and diverse other words whose import is not always according to the full
extent of the word, nor always in one sense; but the sense imported, is that
which the sentence in which it is used, carries forth, and so by the whole
sentence may be known.

2. Not Hebrew and Greek words, Rev. 19.10. 1 John 2.20.
but the Testimony of Jesus, is the Spirit of Prophecy. and so the true
Original and Medium for the right understanding of all spiritual and heavenly
things, and the true import of all the sayings of the Gospel, as is foreshewn,
chap. 2.

3. That now God has sanctified all Tongues to declare his Truth, and make
known his Mind in, and to be praised and prayed unto in Act. 2.6. and 8.17.
Romans 8.15. Gal. 4 6.
; and they might as well write (as they did preach) to every Nation in their
own Tongue, when they writ to the Churches, for ought any can say to the
contrary: though when their writings were collected, they might by the great
Clerks be put forth in the Greek Tongue only, yet in diverse Copies; and the
Hebrew was translated into Greek before; and we thank God both for
Translations, and the variety of them; knowing the Truth of God to be one and
the same, and of the same Authority, and to be received in the same manner; as
it appears in every Translation, in every Tongue and Language, as it was to
those Act. 2. and to Romans, etc.

4. That the Light of Truth, and Import to God's Mind to us in his sayings, is
the saying or sentence it self, and not often in the Etymology of every
particular word; nor does the Spirit of Light, and force to enter the heart,
lie in the force of the Etymology, and copious and various sense of such and
such a word, of so many Syllables, in such and such a Tongue, (as some would
persuade of some words, and therefore left them untranslated) but in the
Knowledge and Belief of the Testimony of Christ. And therefore, when words are
used, which are of common and known signification, and alter not, but set forth
the sense as pertaining to the things of Christ in Translation or Explication;
it is all one and the same, being the import of his sayings, which believed,
the Light of his Spirit will go forth therein. And so, without amazing the
people with some strange sense about the Etymology and signification of the
word in the pure Hebrew or Greek, have those that were infallibly led by the
Holy Spirit done, (as the industrious Learned do know.) That Genesis 2.24. in Mat.
19.5. Mark 10.8. Ephesians. 5 31. 1 Cor. 6.16. That Psalm. 40.6. in Heb. 10.5. That
Prove. 3.34. in James 4.6. That Prove. 11.31. in 1 Pet. 4.18. That Isa. 11.10. in
Romans 15.12. That Isa. 42.4. in Mat. 12.21. are all rendered as they were in the
Translation then known and used among the people, without mention of any other
signification in the pure Hebrew. And these are those we are to follow: so that
this Objection appears carnal and of no force, to such as know this.

The fourth Objection is by Queries and Rhetorical Persuasions, when a saying
is so full and plain, that it cannot be denied in its import, but that it is so
said, and that it is true such a thing is; yet then, to darken that import and
thing, that it may not be known what it is, The Objectors put forth Query upon
Query, and on the same Rhetorically persuade or dissuade. I might instance: as
if the saying be plain, That Christ died for all Men: then Query, Did he so
intentionally? why then are not all saved? If the saying be plain, That Jesus
Christ is the Mediator between God and Men, and makes Intercession for
Transgressors; Then it is queried, In what sort, or manner, or intent? If the
saying be plain, That Jesus Christ is the true Light that lightneth every Man
that comes into the World; Then it is queried, In what measure, how far, into
what degree, by whom, and by what means, etc? And many such Queries; which,
when used with Rhetoric to withdraw from the Belief of the plain import of the
saying, they are mere wranglings with the Text it self, and might be answered
with this, Job 33.12, 13. That God is greater than man: why do thou strive
against him? for he gives not account of any of his matters. And we are not to
dispute with him about his sayings, but to believe them true and right, whoever
deny them.



1. The Apostles shunned and used not such wisdom of Words, and excellency of
Speech, or Wisdom of the Wise, 1 Cor. 1.17, 18, 20. and 2.1, 4, 6, 13.
Disputers, and Prudent of this world, or enticing words of Man's wisdom.

2. They have also warned us to take heed, lest any man spoil us through
Philosophy and vain deceit, Col. 2.8.
after the Tradition of Men, after the Rudiments of the world, and not after
Christ; which observed, will be an Antidote against all these gross and subtle
troublers of Believers.

CHAP. 6.
An Assay to remove the Objections of those that pretend Scripture, seek to
trouble Believers from believing the plain sayings of the Gospel, with
something, as if it were in the Letters, Epistles or Writings of the Apostles,
etc.

IN this I must not be large, and shall therefore omit those, that to evade
Scriptures, speaking of the extent of the Death of Christ for all, allege
Scripture speaking of his Ministration, and of some Efficacies of his Grace in
Believers, and of their Privileges; and to gainsay the All and Every in the
sayings, and of the works of God, allege Scripture, using the word All and
Every in the sayings, and of the works of Men, etc. which all that are wise may
observe as impertinent: and I shall only answer two Objections against the
plain import of Scripture-sayings in the Testimony of Christ, pretended to be
by Scripture; and leave the rest to the following Discourse.

Christ himself spoke many things to the people in Parables; therefore many of
the sayings of the Gospel are hard to be understood, and have not the sense the
words seem to import.

Mat. 4. and 12. Mar. 3. John 3.14, 18.
: and after to those that in seeing did not see, and in hearing did not hear,
but hardened their hearts; he therefore spoke to them in Parables Mat. 13.13.
. And we know in Scripture are many Types, Parables and Metaphors, which were
not clearly and fully opened till Christ entered the Heavens in our Nature, and
offered the acceptable Sacrifice, and sent forth the Holy Ghost Heb. 9.8. Joh.
7.39. and 2.22 and 14.26.
. And these Parables were all uttered before that Ascension of his; and yet he
also opened all these Parables to his Disciples Mat. 13.20, 51. Mar. 4.14, 34.
Luke 8.
: yea, and all that Moses and the Prophets spoke concerning himself, he opened
to them Luke 24.27, 47
; and promised them, and according to his promise, gave them his holy Spirit to
teach them all things he had said to them John 14.26. Act. 2.
, having charged them, Mat. 10.27. What I tell you in darkness, speak ye in the
light; and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the house top. And this
given as a Reason to them, That the Knowledge given them, was as a Light set on
a Candlestick, that it may give Light to all that are in the House, that they
which enter in may see the Light Mat. 5.14, 15. Luke 8.10, 16.
. And the Apostles have professed to have fulfilled this charge, and to have
used great plainness of Speech, both in Preaching and Writing; declaring no
Fable, nor using any cloak or veil to hide their meaning, as is fore-shewed,
Chap. 1, and 2. And it were folly in us to be cheated and withdrawn from
believing their sayings of the Testimony of Christ to be plain and true,
according to their own import.

If any reply, The Revelation of Jesus Christ given to his Apostle John is very
dark and obscure, and that was since the Ascension of Christ:

I answer, Our Unbelief makes many things therein more dark to us than
otherwise they would be: and yet the Testimony of Christ, and the sayings
thereof, that are needful to be known and believed of all that would have
Eternal Life, are very plain there also, and have their own plain import, as in
other places, none denying: and that in which so much obscurity appears to us,
is, in Visions, and Prophecies of his providential dealing with his Church, and
with the Enemies of his Church, and so of things to come pass, before, and till
his own coming again: of which, in Understanding and Belief of the Testimony of
Christ, and Acquaintance with the Scripture, we may understand as much as is
needful for us: And in the increase of that Knowledge, and as things draw nigh
to be fulfilled, know more still; whence there is Blessing to be met with in
reading and hearing that Book, Rev. 1.3.
and keeping the things written therein. But our Discourse being of the plain
sayings of the Gospel and Testimony of Christ, by which all the other sayings
in the Scripture are to be understood; and therefore those sayings not obscure,
and so these Objections of no force against it.

says, That in Paul 's Epistles (which were written after Christ his
Ascension) are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned
and unstable, wrest, as they do also the other Scriptures, to their own
destruction. Therefore many of the sayings of Christ in the Gospel are hard and
obscure.

Peter's sayings, 2 Pet. 3.16. gives no color for this objecting inference:
For Peter,

1. He says not, That any sayings in Paul's Epistles are hard to be
understood; or, That the manner of his Writing is hard to be understood: but
some things in those sayings are hard to be understood. Now this is clearly and
commonly known, that a saying may be plain and clearly understood, and yet
something in that saying above our knowledge, and not easily understood: as,
before it was known to the Eunuch, That Christ was come in the flesh, and that
Jesus was the Christ; he, in reading Isa. 53.7. understood what the saying was,
and believed it true: but there was one thing hard in it to him; and that was,
of whom the Prophet spoke; without knowledge of which, he counted himself not
to understand; and in knowledge of that one thing, all the rest was clear and
useful to him, Act. 8.30, 34, 35. And now that is cleared to us, and so all
sayings: yet still in sayings known, even some thing known therein to be, if it
be of a thing to come, may be hard to be understood what it is 1 John 2.2, 3.
Col. 3.3, 4.
.

2. He says not, That all Paul's Epistles, or any one of his Epistles or his
sayings, or all the things in his sayings, or in any of them; but only some
things, some certain things in them; and this, with a limitation also to these
things, that is, the things of which Peter had been forespeaking in this
Chapter, about the second coming of Christ, the Dissolution, and Restoration
of all things, the new Heaven, and the new Earth, and God's Patience in waiting
so long for Men's Repentance, before he bring all this to pass 2 Pet. 3.3, 12,
13, 14, 15.
; of which things, Paul spoke to the Hebrews Heb. 2.5, 8. and 12.26, 27.
: and often in his other Epistles Romans 8.19, 23. 1 Cor. 1, 6, and 15. 2 Cor.
5.1.10. Gal 3.19 Ephesians. 1.14. and 4.13. Phil. 2.10, 11. and 3.20, 21. Col. 1.20.
and 3 4.^ These. 3.13. and 4 14, 18. and 5 2. 2 These. 1, 7, 10. 1 Timothy 6.14, 15.
2 Timothy 2.12, and 4.8. Tit. 2.13.
. And so he speaks not of the beginning of the Gospel of Christ, or of things
here to be enjoyed, but of those things hoped for: and of them, he says not,
The main, or all things; but, Some things are hard to be understood: which
firms our Belief of the sayings, and serves to humble us, and quicken up our
attention, that in Believing, we with patience may wait for that time in which
we shall know clearly, 1 John 3.2. And the more we mind the Testimony, the
more we shall know now; which we could not, if the sayings were dark: but they
are a Light, and so affirmed by Peter to be, 2 Pet. 1.19.

3. He faith not, That those sayings, or that the hardness of some things in
those sayings, did lead or cause any to err, much less that they erred in
believing them true according to their plain import; for had they so done, and
waited on Christ in that Testimony to teach them, they had not erred, but in
due season should have understood, even those things, as much as was needful
and useful for them to know Joh. 8.31, 32 1 John 2.20 27, 28. Prove. 8 9.
. But those hard things beyond their conception, they not liking the plain
import of the sayings in which they were, and so not believing it to be so,
having their own Devices and Opions, which they desire to maintain, to which
the plain import of those sayings were cross, they did therefore wrest them, by
mixing, mangling, adding to, and diminishing from, feigning absurdities in the
sayings, and raising consequences, If so and so, then so and so; and to make
all right, frame Glosses, and Allegories, to suit them to their own Desires and
Opinions, and so hurt themselves and erred; the Mystery being opened to them,
for the obedience of Faith, to be believed and so known, and not for their
Reasoning, Querying, and Allegorizing, by which they have turned from the
Faith, and so from the Truth to Fables; and so allegorized the second coming of
Christ, the first Resurrection, that is, of the Just, the new Heaven, and the
new Earth, and the reigning of the Saints, and the Peace of all Creatures then;
and after this, to Allegorize the very Personal Body of Christ, his Death,
Resurrection, Ascension, and sitting at the right Hand of God; turning all into
a Fancy of a thing or frame and Spirit, within them, which they prefer and
magnify: and to such as hearken to them, and yet look for a bodily
Resurrection, they say, There is no such Resurrection of the Dead 1 Cor. 15.12.
. To such as begin to listen to, and magnify their Allegory, they say, The Day
of the Lord is at hand 2 These. 2.2.
. To such as believe their Seize, they say, The Resurrection is with them
past already: and so overthrow the Faith of some others, as themselves have
departed from it 2 Timothy 2.18.
. And to all this wickedness are they turned, not by the sayings of the Gospel,
or the hardness of the things discovered therein, but by their own Desires to
maintain some evil Opinion, for which they have no plain saying of Scripture,
but are fain to use their wit to wrest them.

4. He says not, That all Men, or Gracious Men, or unfeigned Believers, that
are weak, do thus wrest the Scripture: but them that do thus, he marks them out
by three Characters: 1. They are unlearned. 2. They are unstable. 3. They wrest
also the other Scriptures. Mind these Marks.

I. They are Unlearned: that is, not spiritually enlightened, they have not
hearkened to, and believed the Testimony of the Gospel, and so have not learned
the Knowledge of the Truth as it is in Jesus. This is the Learning he speaks
of, which is the Beginning of Wisdom, through the Belief of the Testimony of
Jesus Christ, to have the Faith of God, and Love of Saints in the Heart Joh.
6.44, 45. 1 Cor. 2.9, 15. Prove. 1.5, 7. and 9.10.
. He speaks not in respect of Humane Learning, in skill in Tongues, and Arts,
and the Liberal Sciences, and of the Learning of this World; Peter himself not
being furnished with this Learning Mat. 11.25. Act. 4.13.
; yea, such Learning as this, is counted by God and his Servants Foolishness,
to discern and find out the things of Christ 1 Cor. 1.19, 28. and 2.1, 6, 8,
14.
: yea, the more of such Learning any Man has, if the former be wanting, the
fitter and abler he is to Wrest, Gloss, and Allegorize Scripture-Sayings: So
that the want of this Learning is not blamed; yea, mostly such as are wanting
in this, are the best learned, if Believers, in the Knowledge Peter speaks of
Psa. 8.2. Mat. 11.25. and 21.16 Luke 10.21. 1 Cor. 1.26, 27.
. So that these Wresters are unlearned, that is, believe not the plain sayings
of the Testimony of Christ, and so have not laid aside their fleshly Pride and
Wisdom, to credit the sayings of God; and so have not received into their
Hearts the Knowledge of the Truth, and therein the Love of the Truth to save
them 2 These. 2.10, 12. 2 Timothy 3.7.
: and so have not the Faith, Fear, and Love of God in their Hearts; and so
unlearned.

II. They are Unstable: they do not abide, nor are yet settled and resolved to
abide, in the Belief and Acknowledgement of the Truth, as it has been
evidenced to them in the plain sayings of the Gospel, which sometime they were
almost persuaded to embrace and profess Act. 26.28.
; sometime persuaded to embrace, John 2.24. and 8.31, 32. sometime persuaded
with Acknowledgement of Grace to profess also Gal. 4.15.
: but through diverse Lusts, a desire to be approved of, and hold in with
contrary Teachers, as with the Teachers of the Truth, are inclining to hear
enticing words, and so ready to be turned aside with every wind of Doctrine
Ephesians. 4.14. Col. 2.8.
. And so they are now inclining this way, anon that; now on, now off: such
unstable ones they are 2 Timothy 3.7.
.

III. They also wrest the other Scriptures to their own destruction: they take
not the plain sayings of the Gospel, as the true and plain Demonstrations of
God's Mind, nor his speaking by his Spirit in his Apostles, as it is indeed
the Word of God, verily true, and without Doubtfulness or Equivocation; which
if they did, it would verily work savingly and effectually in them, Romans 1.16.
1 These. 2.13.
, and save them from erring 1 Cor. 15.1, 4.
; yea, even such as knew not Christ, yet erred not in standing to a plain
saying of Scripture Mat. 2.4, 5, 6.
. But these taking God's sayings in the Scripture, as the sayings of a Man, (if
not as a Barbarian) that may have some uncertainty or equivocation in them, or
at best spoken by a Conjectural Judgment, and according to the outward
appearance of things, they do therefore wrest them; and so they can wrest the
word World, to mean, The Elect only; and the saying, That Christ is the
Savior of the World, to be, The Savior of his Elect only; and, His
purchasing by his ransom given, and sanctifying by his blood, to be, A seeming
so to do: and his calling such as have denied him, such as were bought by him,
a seeming to be bought; and by like reason, their denying him, and departure
from the Faith, a seeming to deny or depart: or if they do not this, then they
can turn the whole Gospel into Allegories. These are the Men, and this is their
way, set forth by the Apostle, to warn us from them. So that Peter is in this
place so far from importing hardness or obscurity in the plain sayings of
Christ in the Gospel, that in moving us to Humility, and to beware of Pride,
and Fleshly Wisdom, and so of sloth, security, and conceited fullness, he by
mentioning some things to be hard to be understood, does stir up our attention
to the sayings of the Gospel, and encourages us to look and wait for farther
Knowledge. And that we may not stumble at any thing appearing hard, but know it
in due time, he instructs and exhorts us to believe steadfastly, and stick close
to the Testimony of Christ, that we may not be drawn aside therefrom by any
such as these unlearned and unstable ones, or their ways of wresting Scripture;
but to grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Savior Jesus Christ 2 Pet.
3.16, 17, 18. Gal. 1.6, 7, 8. 1 Pet. 2.2, 3.
.

And thus much in answer to the Adversaries of the Truth and Plainness of the
Import of the Sayings of the Gospel in the Testimony of Christ.

CHAP. 7.
A Conclusion of all aforesaid, with the Assent of a learned Man, and my
submission thereto.

BY all said from the first Chapter till now, it appears to be the only true
and safe way for discerning and knowing Truth, and avoiding Falsehood and Error,
to resort to the Law and the Testimony, and to believe the sayings thereof; and
count what it says and imports true and good; and whatsoever or by
whomsoever uttered, that is not according thereto, let that be counted a lie
and deceit, that we may justify God in his Sayings: whoever reprove us for it.

Consenters in this Truth, those that read much know I have many; but I shall
here instance no more but that learned and mighty esteemed Mr. John Owen; who,
in the Book I read over, says, Page 190. Sect. 2.
Doubtless it were better for Men, to captivate their understandings to the
Obedience of Faith, than to invent distinctions and evasions, to escape the
power of so many plain Texts of Scripture, and those literally and properly,
and not figuratively and metaphorically expressing the Truth contained in them:
which though it may be done sometime, yet is it not in a constant Uniform
Tenure of Expression, anywhere the manner of the Holy Ghost. Page 192. Sect. 4.
And again he says, Neither is it possible to apprehend, That the Scripture
would, so often, so expressly affirm the same things in plain proper words, if
they were not to be taken in the sense which they hold out. And he also says,
Page 3.
One Scripture in its own plainness and simplicity will be of more use for the
end I aim at, than twenty Scholastical Arguments, pressed with never so much
accurateness and subtilty: yea, he also says, Page 375.
If an unusual sense of a word be found in a thousand places, it will not
enforce it in another place, unless the circumstances of it, and matter
whereabout it treats, enforce that sense, and will not bear that which is
proper: yea, Page 253. Sect. 14.
he says, To the Law, and to the Testimony, with all the conceptions and
notions of the most intelligent Man, if they answer not this rule, it is,
because there is no Truth in them. And in his Epistle in a Book by him
forewritten, he counsels, To honor God and Christ in his own Language, or else
be for ever silent; and that all our inventions, be they never s^splendent
(another adds, rational too) in our eyes, yet to him they are abomination.

How well has Mr. Owen said, and counseled others in all this! Oh that he had
walked in this counsel, by these Rules himself! but if he has done otherwise
in his Controversies, yet it is good in all that he says according to Truth,
to do as he says, though not as he has done in some of his Writings. It may
be these sayings were put in, to counsel and cautionate his Reader, that he
takes not all he reads upon trust; and that he would have others, and will
hereafter himself follow this Rule: and therefore, though he would not grant
like Christian Requests of mine, but went beside all these Rules in dealing
with a Treatise of mine; yet in Love and Obedience to the Truth, I will grant
and yield to all this, and endeavor to follow this Rule to the utmost of the
Ability given me; and so desire, that every Saying or Writing of mine, now, or
heretofore written, (and so of others likewise) may be tried by the Testimony
of Christ, and the plain Sayings thereof; and all that agrees not thereto, I
confess and renounce as a lie and deceit: and so I would have others to do. Let
the Scriptures try, and judge us all; but let not any of us be the Triers and
Judgers of the Scriptures, but the Searchers, Believers and Observers of the
same; for which I suppose the Declaration already given, and Rule consented in,
is good; yet I will add a word or two suited to the capacity of such as are of
the meanest Understanding among Believers.

CHAP. 8.
An Assay to direct the weakest to find the Testimony of Christ in the Sayings
thereof, to be plain, and to have their own plain Import; that such as know
their own Tongue, and the end and use of words therein, may also discern the
Sense and Import of the plain Sayings of Christ in the Gospel.

IF any desire to understand clearly the plain Import of the Sayings of Christ,
and so the true sense of a Saying in the Gospel; There are some Rules very
good, and safe, and useful for some Men, as to take that sense which will agree
with the Analogy of Faith, and with the Ten Commandments, and with that
Doctrine and Ground of all right Praying, called, The Lord's Prayer; and which
most abaseth the Nature of fallen Man, and exalts the Grace of God; which
surely is good; nor can there be any right sense, if it agree not with these
Rules, as Scripture lays them forth: yet is there great difference among even
the Learned and Godly in the understanding of these Rules, and Application of
them; much difference between some about the Analogy of Faith, and between some
about the end and use of the Law, and about the meaning of diverse Petitions;
yea, and also what tends to the abasing of man, and magnifying of Grace; so
that certainty to all will not be found in their use of these Rules, seeing
even the Rules also must be understood, according to the plain Sayings of the
Gospel of Christ: and so the Rule fore-given and consented in, is best; yet
coming to the Scripture to know the Mind of God, that the weak may discern the
plain appearing sense; Observe these Directions.

First, Beware of those evils that will certainly hinder one from meeting with
the right and comfortable understanding of the Mind of God in Scripture: and
for that cause, take heed,

1. That we keep no Idol in our Hearts, allow of no evil Lust, or Confidence,
or Purpose, or Desire of Praise of Men, lest as a punishment, we be left to
false conceits Ezekiel. 14.1, 8. Numb. 22.12, 1^ John 5.44.
.

2. That we lean not to our Understandings, or think by our Wit and Learning to
judge what God's Mind is: but become Fools in our selves, that we may be wise
in believing God Prove. 3.5, 7. and 26.12. 1 Cor. 3.18, 21.
.

3. That we make no Man nor Men on Earth our Rabbie, so as we take our Faith
about the Truth of any Doctrine, or Sense of Scripture-Sayings on trust from
him, or so as not to receive any without his approbation Mat. 23.8, 9, 10.
.

4. That we be not over-busie in raising Queries about the Truth and
Righteousness of the Sayings of Christ, lest that lead us to stumbling, as it
did those, John 6.30, 52, 60.

Secondly, Read the Scripture, as the Declaration of the God of Truth, which he
by the Spirit of Truth has caused to be written for our learning, and in which
he speaks to us Romans 15.4. Mat. 22.31. Heb. 3.7. and 13.5.
.

And therein, first and chiefly mind what he has testified of his Creation of
the World for Mankind; and of Mankind, righteous in one public Man; and of
the Disobedience and Fall of Mankind into sin and death, in, and through one
public Man; and of the Redemption wrought for Mankind, in, and by another
public Man; and of the fullness that is in the second public Man, to make
known the Mind and Love of God, and to send forth Spirit to convince Men, and
bring them in to believe; and of the Remission of sins, and Eternal Life for
Believers, and the just Condemnation of such as disobey and refuse to believe;
and of the Resurrection of the just and unjust, and the appearing of all before
the Judgment Seat of Christ; and his sentence of the Just into Everlasting
Blessedness, and of the unjust to Everlasting Torment; and how all these
Sayings are plain, being written to that end, that we may know the certainty of
the words of Truth; and that we might apply our Hearts to his Knowledge, and
put our trust in the Lord Prove. 22.17, 21.
. And if these Sayings should not hold forth their own Sense, no man could tell
us what the Sense is: let not our Minds be waving in this, but give God the
Honor of his Truth and Love in speaking these things so plainly to us, as they
admit not of any Limitation, Glossing, or Allegory. These be the first things
to be known, and most needful to be first known, and all other Sayings known by
their agreeing in Sense with these: therefore read them, as God's Declaration
of his Mind to us, that we may know it.

Thirdly, as God has been pleased to condescend so low to us, as to make known
his Mind to us, in words understandable to, and used among Men; and in such
manner as is usable among Men for importing their Sense: so let us observe and
mind about them, that which is observable of Men about the Import of words to
know their sense: as to say:

1. The Country or People where such words are used, knowing that many things
are expressed by diverse words in diverse Countries, and understood by the use of
the expression in that Country where it is used; and that in some one Country,
one and the same word is diversely used, and the Sense it bears, known by the
sentence in which it is used: Now the Country whence the Gospel came being
Zion, and according to the Spirit's breathing, writ in the Scriptures, we are
to mind how and in what sense words are used there, and so to understand them
according to the sentence in which they are used.

2. By and of whom a Speech is, whether Governor or Subject, wise or simple,
true, faithful and knowing, or ignorant and unfaithful; and accordingly we
value the Extent, Truth, Worth, and Goodness of their Sayings, or put Limits
and make Doubts thereof: so in the Scriptures, being related the Sayings of God
by his Spirit, and the Sayings of Men, both of faithful and unfaithful Men; we
may understand those sayings accordingly, for their Extent, Worth, Truth, or
for their scantness, weakness, etc.

3. The persons and things treated of, whether the chief Magistrate of a
Commonwealth, or inferior Magistrates, or Fathers, or Masters; and so whether
of a Kingdom, Commonwealth, Corporation, Association, or Family; and so
understand the words All, Every, Head, Body, or Hand, ruling or subjection
accordingly: so may we observe in reading the Scriptures, of whom and what we
read, where we read of two Adams, or two public Men; the first, a living soul;
the second, a quickening Spirit: the first fallen, and of the Earth earthy; the
second alive for evermore, the Lord from Heaven, heavenly: the first having all
his Generation in his loins, naturally to come forth of him; the second taking
the Nature of the first, and spiritualizing it, to have his Generation out of
the first Man's Children, by bringing them in to him in a spiritual manner. And
so we read of Men, as they are of the Race of the first Adam, and of some Men
as born of Water and the Spirit, and become of the Generation of the second and
spiritual Man. And so we read of the Works of God and of Men about both, and of
things suitable to the one, and his Generation; and of things suitable to the
other, and his Generation. And so when we read the sayings of the first Man and
his natural Race, and of things pertaining to them; whether All, Every, or
Head, Body, Eye, Hand, Foot; or of Wisdom, Power, Works of Righteousness; or of
Lands, Waters, Trees, Mountains, we may understand it in a sense suitable to the
natural Man and his Race, whether it be plain or metaphorical: But if the
sayings be of the second Man, that is the spiritual Man, and his spiritual
seed, and of things peculiar to him and them, we may understand it spiritually
in a sense suiting to Christ and the things of Christ, whether it be Temple,
House, Body, Eye, Hand, Foot, Fire, Water, Trees, Wisdom, Strength, or
righteous Doing; yet still according to the Import of the Letter speaking of
such things, comparing natural things with natural, and spiritual things with
spiritual; and in sayings relating to both natural and spiritual Men, to
understand them in both senses, according to their Relation.

4. The Business in and about which the saying is whether. Monarchical,
agitated by Imperial Edict; or National, agitated by a Parliament or State: or
whether the Business of a Province or Country, agitated by Judges, Justices and
Jurors: or a Corporation Business, agitated by Major, Aldermen, Counselor: or
a Family-Business, agitated by a Father, Master, or Steward's direction: or
Personal Business, between two or three: and then the words, Rule, House,
Order, Law, All, Every, Many, or Elect, are easily understood of a larger or
less extent, or more general, or more special in the Import of the Sense: so in
Scripture we may observe the Business of which the Sayings are, whether of God,
and of Christ, and his Works; and therein, whether of his Works in general, as
of Creation of all things, and of Mankind; or his Redemption of Mankind, or
his Preservation of them, and Extention of Mercies and Means to them, to call
them to Repentance: or whether of more special Mercies and Means, extended to
one Nation more than to another; or, of peculiar Graces extended to his
newborn People: and so, whether of his Works of Salvation for Men, or i^ M^n;
or of his Redemption, and Purchasing of Men of God, and calling them to God; or
of his redeeming and purchasing some Men from among Men unto God, and so
sanctifying and choosing them to be his peculiar People: and accordingly we may
understand the words All, Every, Many, Us, were to be of more-general or more
special extent, though the word World be never used to express the Elect only:
but if the Business about which the Sayings are, be of Men, though as his
Instruments, the Sense according to the Business may be more large or strait,
but not so large nor so peculiar as in the Works of God and Christ only.

5. The manner of speaking and propounding, whether it be by Propositions of
Generals or Specials, and whether it be for believing only, or for example
also; and whether it be General, or Particular, and Applicative; and
accordingly we understand the Sayings more or less largely: so in the
Gospel-Sayings, observing whether they be Propositions of Truth, that Men might
believe, or of Example for Men to follow; or Propositions General to Men, or
Special to Believers, or Particular and Applicative Sayings, we may know the
Sense to be more General and Large, or more Special, and Limited to some
Special accordingly.

6. The end and scope of a Speech or Saying, whether it be to set forth a
Person or a Business: and if of a Person, whether it be to set forth who he is,
or what he is, or whence he is, or where he is; or if his Business, whether
what he has done, or what he does, or what he will do, and for whom; and that
whether in General or Special, and for what end. And accordingly we understand
the extent of the Sense: and so in Gospel-Sayings we may understand in minding
the end and scope of them, whether to set forth the Person of Christ or his
Business, or the Persons of Men and their Business, or the Persons of Believers
and their Business: and if the Person of Christ, then whether to show who he
is, or what a one he is, or whence he is, or where he is; and if of his
Business, then whether to show what he has done, and for whom, and for what
end; or what he does, or what he will do, and whether in General for All, or in
Special for Believers, etc. accordingly the Sense imported General or Peculiar.

7. How Words more hardly understood in some Sayings, are explained and shown
to be meant and intended by them that use them, in other of their Sayings; and
how taken and understood by them that are acquainted and conversant with the
users of those Sayings; and so, though the same Word has diverse meanings, one
in one Saying, and another in another Saying; in one Saying proper, in another
figurative; yet by this Observation, it is easily understood by the Sentence in
which it is. And the like we may observe about Words in Scripture Sayings, that
have some obscurity, and one meaning in one Saying, and another meaning in
another Saying; yet in like Sayings, the meaning of those words is explicated
by the Spirit that spoke them, and has been understood and recorded by the
Holy Prophets and Apostles, and may be understood by all that believe their
writings, in comparing one place with another; so that we compare like Sayings,
or Sayings of like things together; as, if the Sayings be of God and of his
Works of Creation, Redemption, etc. and by God said; see the sense of the Word,
as given and explicated in like Sayings; and compare not God with Men, to make
the Sense of a Word used by Men, and in Sayings and Businesses of Men, to be
the Limit of the Sense and Force in such Words spoken by God, and of his Works.
And these things observed, the Import of Sayings in Scripture, will not be so
obscure as many pretend. And for these things, though I might, yet I have not
quoted Scriptures, but leave that to be seen in the following Discourse. I know
such as pride themselves in their Learning and skill in Tongues, Sciences, and
Arts, will push at these simple Observations; but they need not, for they are
not intended for them, though even they will run into Absurdities if they
neglect and go contrary to them: but they are writ for such as are unskilful in
that Learning, that such as have the use of Understanding, may consider that
which they read in Scripture; and I suppose it will after appear, yea, and in
some Scripture-Commands and Appeals, to be even there directed unto. For
present see Romans 7.1. 1 Cor. 9.7, 8. and 11.13. and 14.19, 20. 2 Cor. 4.1.
,

Fourthly, The plainness of the Gospel-Testimony of Christ, will yet farther
appear, if we mind in comparing Scriptures, the Distinctions mentioned
therein, of the manifold ends of the Death of Christ; one to make Propitiation
for sins, one to confirm the New Testament, and one to show Love and Obedience
to his Father, and Love to and Care of his Sheep in witness-bearing to the
Truth, and therein to give us an Example: and likewise mind the different
extent, in regard of these ends; and observing also the Tense and Person, and
change of Tense and Person used in Scripture-Sayings.

These four Rules observed, I hope the Sayings of the Gospel in the Testimony
of Christ, will appear plain to all that desire and pray to God for
Understanding. And yet to make all the more useful to understand the Testimony
of Christ; Before I set on the discovery of that, I will add a few Words more
about God's Creation of the first public Man, and that Man's Fall and Misery;
for remedy whereof, the second public Man came.

CHAP. 9.
Of the Creation of Mankind in the first Adam.

1. IN the beginning God created and made the Heaven, and Earth, and Sea, and a
world of Creatures in each of them; and all to show forth his Glory, Love, and
Bounty, for the benefit and commodity of Mankind; and all before he made the
first Man. And so it appeared, the first Man had no hand or counsel in the
Creation of any of them; all being made and surnished for him, before he was in
being Genesis 1.1, 26. and 2.5, 7. Psalm. 104.1, 23, 24, 25. and 8.3, 9.
.

2. He created and made Man of the Dust of the Earth, and breathed in him the
breath of Life, and so made him a living Soul; yea, a Natural Man, Male and
Female, fit for multiplication in a Natural way; yea, a public Man, so as all
Mankind were in him created, and in respect of species or kind, all in him as
he was Genesis 1.27, 28. and 2.18, 23, 7. 1 Cor. 15.45, 47, 48. Act. 17.26.
.

3. He made this first public Man, (and so all Mankind in respect of kind in
him) in his own Image or Likeness Genesis 1.26, 27.
: not God, but Man Ezekiel. 28.2, 6, 9. Isa 31.3. Gen 1.26, and 27.
; nor equal with God, for that was the peculiar Privilege of the Word, the Son
of God, that was with God, and God Prove. 8.22; 30 Phil. 2.6. John 1.1, 2, 3.
: But Man of the Dust, and therein a little lower than the Angels Psalm. 8.5.
; yet truly in a measure in the Likeness and Image of God: which appears in
Scripture to be,

I. For Uprightness in Holiness and Righteousness; so as his Heart was
naturally inclined to love God with all his Mind, Heart, Soul and Strength,
and his Neighbor as himself; I Genesis 1.27. Eccles. 7.29. Jam. 2.9. Ephesians. 4.24.
Col. 3.10. II Genesis 1.28. Psalm. 8.6, 7, 8.
and all his Powers apted freely to walk out therein, without compulsion of any
outward Law.

II. Lordship and Dominion over all the Creatures below made for him, in the
Earth, and Sea, and Air.

III. A Capacity of Immortality, III Genesis 2.17. Psalm. 8.3, 8. and 49.12, 20.
Rom, 5.12. and 6.23.
and living in his Happiness for ever; so, as if he acknowledged his supreme
Lord, liking and continuing in the Condition and Honor he was put in,
forbearing the eating of the Fruit of one Tree; he should not die, but live,
and enjoy his Happiness for ever: otherwise, he might become as the Beasts that
perish.

4. He furnished this first public Man (and so all Mankind in him) with
sufficient furniture, that he might abide in his happy Estate:

I. I Eccles. 7.29. Ephesians. 4.24.
With an inward and natural Principle and Inclination to love God, and his
Neighbor; and Aptitude and Strength in all his Faculties and Powers of Soul
and Body, to walk out therein; so, as there was in him no occasion of
stumbling, or any thing to withdraw or move him to turn aside 1 John 2.10.
, nor any thing besides God, that he needed to desire or fear, to move without
him Genesis 1.31.
.

II. II Genesis 1.28, 29, 30. Psa. 104.1, 15, 16, 24. and 8.2.3, 9. and 19.1, 7
With an outward furniture of Creatures in Heaven, Earth and Sea, showing forth
the Glory, Love and Bounty of his Creator; all at his service, and fitted for
all Accommodation, for the well-being of his Life, to walk cheerfully before
God.

III. III Genesis 2.8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19, 22. and 1.28. and 3.8.
With an easy and pleasant service, in a place of delight and pleasure, where
also he had the freedom and opportunity of meeting with, and enjoying
intercourse and communion with God.

IV. IV. Genesis 1.29. and 2.16, 17.
With an inward Liberty of will, and power to use it, in choosing or refusing,
that so his Obedience might be voluntary; and outward Liberty given him, freely
to eat of every Tree in the Garden, but only one; of which one, he had the
advantage, by the forbearance of it, to testify his thankfulness to his
Creator, and his delight in him, and well-pleasedness with his will and works;
which without this, had been wanting to him.

V. V Genesis 2.16, 17.
With Instruction of the Nature of that forbidden Tree, and what the event and
danger would be, if he did eat thereof.

So that in all this, the great, free and undeserved Love of God to Mankind,
does so appear, as may lead to Admiration, O what is Man, (that was made of the
dust) that thou should be so mindeful of him, and set thy Heart on him, and
so love and bless him Genesis 1.28. and 18.27. Job 7.17. Psalm. 8.4. and 144.3.
.

But God might have made this first Adam so, and such, as he might have been in
an absolute necessity of living for ever in immortality, and so in an absolute
impossibility of falling or changing:

Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty, instruct him? he that reproves
God, let him answer it Job 40.2.
. But I will endeavor to satisfy.

I. If God had made Man in himself immutable, and so in an absolute
impossibility of changing, he had not made him a holy Man only, but God also;
for that is his peculiar, to be in and of himself immutable, Mal. 3.6. Jam.
1.17.

II. God at first, and in the beginning of his way, exalted his Son that was
with him, the same God: so that it is his peculiar with the Father, to be in
and of himself immutable Prove. 8.22, 23 Joh. 1.1, 2, 3. and 17.5. Heb. 13.8.
: nor can any Creature partake of that immutability and blessed immortality,
but as they have it derivatively from him Isa. 40.8. 1 Pet. 1, 2, 24, 25.
.

III. God willed to make Man a little inferior to the Angels Psalm. 8.5.
, (as the second Man was for a little while Heb. 2.7.
.) Now the Angels were not so made, that in and of themselves they were in an
utter incapacity and impossibility of changing or falling into death; yea, many
of them did so fall 2 Pet. 2.4. Jude 6. Job 4.18, 19.
: and those that are now established, that they cannot fall, had that
establishment and impossibility of falling, derived to them from the Word, that
is, the Son of God, whom God had exalted above all; in Acknowledgement of whom,
and well pleasedness with his Exaltation and Dominion, they were through him
Elect, and so his holy Angels Heb. 1.4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14. Prove. 8.22, 23. Job
38.3, 7. 1 Timothy 5.21. 2 These. 1.7 Mat. 22.30.
, (as most propable the first man in continuance, might in the same
Acknowledgement have been by the same Word, without his taking flesh and
dying.) And such as now believe on him shall be in the Resurrection of the
just, in which they shall be equal to the Holy Angels Luke 20.36.
. And had the first Man been made in and of himself, in such an immutability,
he had been made superior to the Angels: Psalm. 8.
but he was made a little inferior to the Angels, though superior to all other
Creatures, and preferred before the Angels, in Lordship over the Works of God's
hands: and his Liberty and furniture for abiding, is fore shown.

So that the Love of God to Mankind, had its first appearance in and through
this first public Man, in the Creation and furniture, and blessing of him; and
what God did to him, he did to all Mankind in him, for all Mankind were in
him: and so while he abode in his innocence, alike righteous in him, and alike
beloved in him, in their species as Men; so, as none yet, in or by him sinners;
and so none hated, none reprobated: for all were in him, as Men, and in no
other Man, neither was there any other Man in being, nor in purpose as Man
before him; he was the natural Man, the first Man in purpose and being as Man,
and there was no other Man before or with him, for Men, or any Men, as Men, to
be beheld, considered, beloved or chosen in. The Lord Christ, as Man, is the
second Man, the last Adam, the spiritual Man, in whom is no Man or Men, but
such as were first in the first and natural Man, have their being in him, and
come forth from him, and first bare his Image; and after, in a supernatural way
are spiritually brought into the second and spiritual Man, 1 Cor. 15.45, 49.
that they may bear his Image. So that all Mankind are to be first considered
as they have their first being in the first public Man, which at first was
blessed and happy.

CHAP. 10.
Of the fall and misery of the first Man, and all Mankind, in him, and so
through him.

Psalm. 49.12. Man in honor abides not, he is like the beasts that perish.
Romans 5.12. By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death
passed on all men, for that (or in whom) all have sinned. Scripture declares
how this came to pass, viz.

1. 1 Jude 6. 2 Pet. 2.4. Joh. 8.44.
The Devil or Prince of the fallen Angels, who aspiring to be higher, left
their own place, and were cast down, he envying the happiness of Man, as he
abode not in the Truth himself; so he thought by Lies to withdraw Man from it,
and bring him into the same Perdition with himself: he made use of the Serpent,
the most subtle of all the Beasts of the Field which the Lord God made, and by
him as his Instrument (as he now does by the most excellent unsanctified wits,
and seeming holy ones) pretending love and good to the Woman, as to help her
and her husband to a more glorious estate, and greater likeness to God than
that God made them in; So tempting Man to his own aspiring sin, he begins with
questioning her about the mind of God in his sayings: Has God in saying said,
or because he said, Genesis 3.1; 4, 4. 2 Cor. 11.3, 4, 13, 14, 15.
Ye shall not eat of every tree in, etc? Did he so say and intend indeed, That
ye should not eat at all of that tree? may not there be some other meaning in
his saying? so to draw her from heeding and believing the word or saying of
God, according to the plain Import of the same: and so amusing her thoughts
about the sense, and then persuade her to a quite contrary sense, (a trick he
has learned seducers to use) whence also he is called, The great Dragon, That
old Serpent, The Devil and Satan, which deceives the whole world, Rev. 12.9.
and 20.2.

2. Man, that was so loved and blessed of God, and so abundantly furnished with
good things, and blessedly advanced by him, having so plain a word, that in
minding and believing it, he might both have known that other voice to be from
a lying Tempter, and have put him to flight: yet, Genesis 2.17. and 3.2, 3, 6.
Jam. 1.13, 14, 15.
by pondering the strange voice, and parleying with the Tempter, he neglected
the heeding and believing the plain Import of the word given him; and so
hearkened to, and believed the voice of the Tempter and Seducer: and being so
withdrawn, he was enticed, and did then look upon the appearing Excellency of
the Tree; and in looking, proceeded to desire it, for the conceited knowledge
and wisdom pretended to be gotten by it; and from desire proceeded to take of
it, and so handled it; and from handling fell to eating of it, contrary to the
express Charge of his Creator. This is the first sin, and the beginning of the
sinning of man.

3. Man stayed not here, but did proceed in adding to, and completing this sin
to the height; and that by hiding themselves from the presence of the Lord Genesis
3.8.
, and by intimately blaming his Creator, as not having furnished him to come
into his presence, leaving him naked Genesis 3.10. Prove. 19.3.
; and by excusing and hiding his sin, when called to account, the man putting
it off to the woman, and intimately to God that gave him the woman, the woman
putting it off to the Serpent, neither confessing faultiness, nor asking
pardon; but leaving it to God's own search Job 31.33. Genesis 3.3, 12, 13.
: so was the first sin finished.

4. In this sin thus begun and finished, we may discern man's demeanor toward
God, how evil it was, and the exceeding sinfulness of this sin, in his
forgetfulness and unbelief of the good word of God in the plain sayings and
import thereof Genesis 2.16, 17. and 3.3.
, a great sin, Hosea 4.6. and disesteem of, and unthankfulness for the great
love of God in his Creation, and the many good things bestowed on him Genesis
1.26, 27, 28, 29. and 2.1, 16.
: a great sin, Deuteronomy. 32.15. 2 Timothy 3.2. yea, and confederacy with the Devil
the Enemy of God and mankind, in hearing, believing, and obeying his
suggestion in the voice of the Serpent Genesis 3.4, 5, 6.
: a great sin, 1 John 4.1, 5. John 5.43. And yet farther, in this sin was
Pride, Ambition, and Robbery in a high degree, in conceiting, aspiring, and
assaying to be equal with God, (which appertained to none, but the only Son of
God, Phil. 2.6 Genesis 3.5.
.) a sin of an high Nature, Ezekiel. 28.2, 6, 9. and disobedience to, and
rebellion against the plain and express command of the Almighty Genesis 2.17. and
3.11.
: a sin of an high Nature, 1 Samuel 15.23. and blasphemy of God, in mind, tongue
and deed, in faulting the work and furniture of God about his own Body, and
assaying by himself to amend it Genesis 3.7, 10.
: a grievous sin, Job 4.17. and unfaithfulness in his public place, both to
God that betrusted him and put him in it Genesis 1.28. and 2.19. Romans 5.12.
, and to those that were to come of him by propagation, in whose place he
stood, and with whom he was betrusted; and also to the Creatures given pure and
good into his Dominion to rule: a great sin, Luke 16.12. and herein, murder
and overthrow, both of himself and all his natural posterity, both of Soul and
Body, in dying to die; a great murder of many in an high degree Genesis 2.17. Rom
1.12, 18. 1 Cor. 15.21, 22.
: a grievous sin, Numb. 35, 31. and extreme vanity and folly, in assaying to
hide himself and his sin from God, to avoid his judgment Gen, 3.8, 10, 13.
: a grievous sin, Job 31.33. Psalm. 5.5. To show how every Precept in ten words
was herein gone contrary to, and sinned against, and all desirable good in the
rule of Prayer given us; as glorifying God, being under his Regiment, doing his
will, resting on him, etc. was in this transgression cast aside, were an easy
business: and yet this offense so great and manifold, does still appear to be
more heinous and sinful, if we mind the circumstances in it; as against how
great, glorious and bountiful a God, that had made him in his Image, furnished
him with a world of Creatures, exalted him to such a Lordship, placed him in a
Paradise, and vouchsafed intercourse with him. This sin was by him in this
Paradise committed, and against what, and how manifold Obligations of
Authority, Love, Benefits, Instructions, and forewarning given, all obliging to
Love and Obedience; this sin was committed by him that enjoyed the good of them
all. And against what welfare of himself, and all his Natural Posterity to come
of him, it was committed. And against what Knowledge and inward Natural
Principle of Righteousness; and with what deliberation and freedom of will,
when he was no way necessitated thereto, he committed this sin: and also how he
committed this sin by the motion of the Devil in the Serpent, in sayings
questioning the Truth of, and contrary to the plain saying of God, and all for
a dreaming conceit, to get a shadow, when he had the substance of good, which
he let go for it; and so for very vanity it self: so that we may with
marvelling, say, Oh how vile and abominable the sin of Man! how contrary to the
nature and will of God! how tempting and provoking his Majesty! how unworthy
and unbeseeming such a Man as Adam!

5. Having thus viewed Man's demeanor and sin in his fall and first offense,
let us mind also the misery that befell him and all Mankind in and through
him, by this one so great and manifold offense; and that the Spirit says
plainly was the entrance of sin, and death by sin, Romans 5.12, 18, and 6.23. 1
Cor. 15.21, 22. The very yielding to commit this sin, brought forth fruit unto
death, as is evident: For, I. In drinking in, I Genesis 3.1, 13. Eccles. 7.29.
Romans 8.6, 7. Col. 1.21.
and obeying the poysonful word and temptation of the Serpent, the Natural
Disposition and Inclination of Man was poisoned and polluted with that Hellish
and Serpentine Venom; and so Man became emptied and stripped of his
Uprightness, and so of his Comfortable Knowledge of God, and love of God, and
his inward Natural Principle of Righteousness; and filled with a Disposition
and inclination averse to God, and all things pleasing to him, and bent and
prone to all things displeasing to him; and so became an Enemy to God. II. It
brought Weakness, Pain, and Mortality on the Body; and Grief, Shame and Fear of
wrath and death on the Soul of Man Genesis 3. Heb. 2.14.
III. It cast man under the commanding and condemning Power of the Law of
Works, To love the Lord his God with all his Heart, Soul, Mind and Strength;
and, his Neighbor as himself; and, to walk in and bring forth the Fruits of
that Love: he was not under the Power of any such outward Law, to direct,
command, move, and lead him before; for the Law of God was before in his Heart:
it was his Natural Inclination and Aptitude so to love and walk in it: but this
by his Fall was lost and gone out of his Heart: Romans 2.15. and 3.19. and 5.12,
18. Gal. 4.4.
yet notwithstanding God lost no part of his Authority; his Goodness foreshewn
to Man, did still as much oblige Man to this Love and walking in it as before;
and so the Law without, took hold of Man, and had its efficacy in him, to
command, and so to excuse or accuse; but afforded him no help or power of doing
it; yet justly condemned for every Transgression or short coming of it, and
that to death: and this befell all Mankind in the first public Man. IV. IV.
Romans 8.20. Deuteronomy. 28.16, 24 Eccles. 1.1, 2. Psalm. 75.3.
It occasioned misery and vanity on all the Creatures made for the service and
commodity of Man, and put under his Dominion, and turned that which was for his
welfare, into a snare; so, as all turned to be a vexation and curse to him, to
fill him with horror and madness, to his Torment, Ruin, and Destruction. V. V.
Numb. 21.21, 22, 24, 31. Judge. 11.13, 15, 21, 25.
According to the Law of Arms, and the right of a Victorer, Satan had gotten
the Dominion of Mankind; and so Mankind in the first public Man, fell under
the power and slavery of the wicked one, the Devil, that thus overthrew Man,
and got the power of Death to terrify Man withal, Rev. 12.9. 2 Cor. 11.3. 1
John 5.19. Heb. 2.14. VI. VI. Romans 5.12, 18. and 6.23. Gal. 3.10. Deuteronomy 27, 26.
It threw man, and all mankind in that public man, unavoidably under the
guilt and Dominion of sin and Death, even all that first mentioned Death, Genesis
2.17. and so into subjection to the Sentence, Condemnation, and Curse of that
Law of Works, under which he was fallen, and to be judged by the Almighty,
according to that Law, to suffer the utmost of the Curse it did sentence unto
for all the breaches of it.


Lo, such the Fall and Misery of Man, such the foulness and fruit of this first
and Original sin, and such the state of the first Man in his fall, and of all
Mankind in him; and this without difference of any of them that Naturally were
in him, Romans 5.12, 18, 19 and 6.23. 1 Cor. 15.49.
and come forth from him; neither ever did, does, or can any Man by Nature or
Naturally come forth from him in any better state, but in coming Naturally
forth from him, to bear his Image: so, that we may by this see a little of the
sin and misery Mankind at first fell into. He that was once righteous, now
unrighteous; he that was once in favor and well-pleasedness with God, now
under guilt and displeasure; he that was happy, now miserable: yet God the
same, and Man changed and fallen into misery in respect of himself and all
Creatures, without Remedy to help: of which a word or two to prepare for
following Business.

CHAP. 11.
Of the Immutability of God, notwithstanding the mutablity fallen Angels, and
Mankind.

NOtwithstanding all this Evil of Man, his enmity against God, and misery in
himself, and so his woeful change; yet was not there, in or by it any change in
God, nor any alteration, or failing of his mind or purpose: he from Eternity
was, and now is, and to Eternity will be the same for ever Exodus 3.14. Rev.
1.4, 8. and 11.17. and 16.5. Heb. 13.8. Mal. 3.6. Jam. 1.17. 1 John 1.5. and
4.8.
, without change or shadow of change; the Father of Lights, yea, Goodness and
Light it self, and there is no Darkness in him. He is Love: and as for fury and
wrath working out to the hatred, destruction, and torment of any of his
Creatures, it has not its first rise from the Being and Nature of God; but
from such Transgressions against his Goodness by his Creatures, as stands cross
to his Wisdom, Love, and Goodness: so, as even from thence, because of such
Transgression, hatred and wrath flows from him, as a Fruit of his Goodness,
and Love to his glorious Goodness and well-beloved Son, as a just Reward of
such Contemners thereof Psalm. 21.8. and 109.4, 5. and 89.36. Prove. 8.22, 23.
Psa. 119.68. and 136.10, 20.
; so that fury is not in him Isa. 27.4.
: but the Fall and Destruction of Transgressors is of themselves, deserved and
procured by themselves Hos. 13.6, 9. Jer. 14 8.
. And in all this, God is of one mind and changes not: he at first made all
things good, and so Angels and Men righteous, and such as he loved; and so he
approves as good, and rejoices in all his own Works Genesis 1.31. Job 38.4, 7.
Psa. 104 4.31. Act. 15.18.
. And so having made not only Mankind, but the Angels before, holy and
well-qualified, he did approve their Essence which he made, and the holy
Qualifications he endued them with, and the Place, or Habitation, or Degree he
put them in; and so loved them, their Essence, their Persons, their
Qualifications, and in love so placed them, (as he did Mankind whom he made
Righteous, etc.) And that he loved the Angels (as he did Mankind) before they
fell, is evident by the Spirits Testimony, That God is righteous, and so both
loves the Righteous Psalm. 146.8.
, and Righteousness Psalm. 11.7.
, and knows (that is, owneth and approves) his own Works Act. 15.8.
, and upholdeth the Righteous Psalm. 37.17.
, and preserves the way of the Saints Prove. 2.8. Psalm. 1.6.
, and blesses the Righteous, and will not suffer them to be removed Psalm. 5.12.
: and in all this, God is the same for ever, immutable, without change, or
shadow of change in himself, or in his mind, to such approved and beloved
ones. Whence also it is evident, That God did not first forsake the Angels, nor
did withhold or withdraw from them any part of that Wisdom, Holiness, and
Strength wherewith he had endued them and by which they might have abode in
that righteous and happy estate he made and put them in; and so have continued
righteous and holy still; and in acknowledging their supreme Lord, have been
established for ever Job 4 7, 18. and 36.7. Psa. 34 15. and 37.28. Prove.
8.22.36. with Joh. 14.21. and 17.5.
: But those of the Angels that did fall, they did voluntarily aspire to a
higher degree of Dignity, and Equality with their supreme Lord; and so did
first of themselves forsake God, and so sinned and ceased to be Righteous and
Saints; they kept not their first Estate (or Principality) but left their own
Habitation Jude 6.
, and so by their Transgression, provoked the Love of God to wrath, whose Love
is such, as it abhors and hates wickedness; and so by their sinning they
made themselves such, that in their Persons, Qualifications, and Ways, they
became the Object of God's hatred and wrath: so that the change was in them,
not in God; who, (because they so sinned, and sinned of themselves without any
other Tempter, and sinned not all in one public Representative, but every one
in their own Persons freely against so great Light and Goodness;) he has
therefore forsaken them, and cast them down to Hell, and reserved them in
Chains of Darkness to the Judgment of the great Day, to be then tormented in
that Everlasting Fire, prepared for them, and such as by them are led to
suchlike personal Transgression Jude 6. 2 Pet. 2.4. Mat. 25.41 Rev. 20.10.
. And yet in all this is there no change in God: he, in his Love, is the same
still, though these sinning Angels be fallen out of his Love under wrath and
hatred; yea, it would rather have implied a change in God, if he had continued
his Love on such presumptuous Transgressors. And this also is written, to
admonish and warn men, yea, even Believers, That none tempt the Lord by
presumptuous sinning, crying peace to themselves, from the Love, Mercy and
Goodness of God fore-testified to them, and the immutability of God in his Love
and purposes; which, though true, yet that argues not the immutability of all
that are in any sort loved of him; so, as though they sin presumptuously, his
immutability engages him to love such notwithstanding so, as those persons once
loved, cannot by any misdemeanor fall from being under that Love, and become
under hatred: we are warned to take heed of such thoughts; for it has with
some, and may with others so fall out, and yet no alteration in God, for he
has shown his mind to be even so 2 Pet. 2.1.4. Jude 5, 6. Deuteronomy. 29.18, 19.20.
. And as for the Sovereignty of God, it is one and the same, and ever agreeing
with his Wisdom, Holiness, Truth, Justice, Love and Purpose: so that change, by
presumptuous sinning of Persons, from being under Love, to be under Hatred,
argues no change in God. And this is clear in the case of the fallen Angels;
that I say nothing of Mankind changed from being under well-pleasedness to be
under wrath and displeasure: though compassions were yet toward them, who
sinned all in one, and by the subtilty of a Tempter; yet the change in Man
great, in God none at all: which shows the vanity of the Pleas and Inferences
of some, about, and from the immutability of God in his mind and purposes.

1. Page 13. p 2.
That saying of Mr. Owen's, That if God can by his power and Spirit keep them
whom he does not forsake in a state and condition of not forsaking him, he does
forsake them before they forsake him, is not fit for Argument to build Doctrine
on, or confirm with; for it is neither true, nor Scripture-like, but is plainly
derogatory to God, and his Truth and Goodness, and far from acknowledging that
depth of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God, Romans 11.33. and rather tends to
lead to fancy, a depth of some openly appearing respect of Persons, and
causeless indignation, cruelty, and unrighteousness, to be, though no man can
yet see how, Righteousness; which I hope Mr. Owen will not allow: nor will he
say, His saying is meant of the fallen Angels; yet Gods proceeding with them
overturneth the truth of his saying: so as it can be no ground, or proof for
him or others to ground any Opinion on, or prove it by. None in their right
mind will say, The fallen Angels transgressed not without cause, God forsook
them first; and so free them from that number, Psalm. 25.3. that transgress
without cause: as if God did first forsake them, before they forsook him; and
so lay the beginning of the blame upon the Almighty, whereas is was first and
wholly in themselves, who were the first sinners, and sinned from the
beginning, and so sin still: Christ says not, Because there was no Truth in
them before the fall; but, 1 John 3.8. Joh. 8.44.
Because he abode not in the Truth, (and so since the fall) there is no Truth
in him: which reproves this foresaid saying.

2. Another saying by this also appears untrue, though used by many, namely,
That whom God loves once, he loves for ever: if it had been, What God loves
once, or such as God loves once, he loves ever, it would have stood; for God
loves Righteousness, and so the Righteous, and so Believers and Saints for
ever. But to say, Whom, or what Persons; all and Every of them whom God loves
once, he loves for ever, is not true; and the surmise of it is grounded on a
false conceit, as if the unchangableness of God, did either depend on, or at
least argue and necessitate the unchangableness of the state and condition of
all such as are once or at any time beloved of God; which, by the story of the
fallen Angels, appears to be false; and Mr. Owen in part, if not wholly, Page
33.
disclaimeth this conceit; yet the consequence not only he retains, but many
other: some, avouching it for Scripture in their sayings, and some in their
Books and writing, citing John 13.1. But he that will read that Text, may see,
that that saying, John 13 1.
or any like it, or a word or syllable importing such a sense, cannot be there
found; for it is clear in the words, suited also with other places of
Scriptures, That the words there in John 13.1. do speak of Jesus Christ, not
only, nor chiefly as he was God; but also, and more directly as he was Man
Mat. 26.2.
: who not only as God, but also, and rather as a Prophet, spoke as he had
received of the Father John 12.50.
, and that also of his sufferings and departure out of this world John 16.28.
, which could not be meant of his Divine Spirit and Presence Mat. 28.20.
. And this also is observable, That he spoke not in this place of himself
only, as the Sacrificer and Peacemaker; but also and more directly, as he was
a Minister of the Gospel, and Peace-Preacher Heb. 2.3 Ephesians. 2.16, 17.
: in whose Ministration, declaring the Peace made in and by him, God was in him
and by him reconciling the World to himself 2 Cor. 5.19. Heb. 1.1, 2.
: and the persons loved, there spoken of, were not all that God had from the
beginning loved; or, that he does now love; but only those that were not only
his own, but even then in the World; yea, his own as then given him of the
Father in the Gospel-Call, and after the Call chosen by him, to be his
Apostles, Messengers, and Ministers Luke 6 13. John 6.70.
, to whom he gave the Words the Father gave him, that they might be in his
place and stead after his bodily departure, to carry on his Ministration, and
beseech Men to be reconciled to God 2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 20. Joh. 17.8. Prove. 9.2,
3.
. And the Love spoken of in this place, is his Love as a Shepherd and a
faithful One, using all holy means, to keep, and preserve, and instruct them in
the Name of the Father, that none of them might be lost, but be fitted for
their present, and after abiding, and service; for which cause he gave them
both instruction and example Joh. 13.2, 18. and 17.11, 12, 13.
: yea, it is express here, that Judas was among them Verse. 2, 18.
; and though he was not one of them, that in receiving his Words was cleansed
Verse. 10, 11. John 15.2.
, nor that said truly, (though rightly) and so not in both respects well and
from his Heart, in calling him Lord and Master Verse 13.
, and so not happy in doing the things counseled by Christ Verse. 14, 17.
, and so no Lover of Christ Verse. 2. John 15.14.
; yet he was one of Christ's chosen Apostles Luke 6.16.
, one whom Christ loved and prayed for, and did good to; yea, continued his
admonitions with loving words to him to the end Psalm. 109.4, 5. Luke 22.48.
Mat. 26.59.
: but he dissembled with his Master, being Adversary to him for his Love; and
refusing his warnings and counsels, rewarded him evil for good, and so, and
there-through, became a Son of perdition; and so lo^ himself John 17.12. Psalm.
109.4, 5.
; his sin being finished, it brought forth death Jam. 1.15.
, and he was then no more loved, nor prayed for; according to that which is
said of such Rebellious ones, All their wickedness is in Gilgal, for there I
hated them for the wickedness of their doings: I will drive them out of mine
house, I will love them no more Hos. 9.15.
. It is clear here, they were once in his House, and loved; yet now because of
so great wickedness, no more loved. And so Judas was once loved, and prayed
for, and means used toward him, unto the end, till he grew to that height of
wickedness in rewarding evil for good, that against all warnings he persisted
to finish his Transgression; and then was he hated, and cast out of his Office,
and no more loved; but another to be put into his Office Psalm 109.3, 4, 5, 6.
Act. 1.16, 26.
. Even as the fallen Angels were once holy and loved: but after their wilful
aspiring and leaving their place, cast down, hated, and no more loved. Yet in
all this, God is one, and of one mind, immutable; and the change is in and
upon the fallen Angels, and such as are become like them. So that this Text,
John 13.1. is mightily wrested and abused, to be pretended to say, Whom God
loves once, he loves for ever; no word in the Text saying it: and God's dealing
with the fallen Angels, and with others, proclaims the falsehood of that saying.

But of the fallen and reprobate Angels, I may leave off to speak farther,
seeing there was found no remedy for them, no Ransom, no Savior, none to take
their Nature and Cause in Hand, and so no Gospel to be preached to or by them;
no Prayers to be put forth for them, no Commands to them to repent and believe
the Gospel; but Christ, and Gospel, and Prayers, and all against them: but of
Mankind fallen, there is yet some better thing to say of them all, after we
have considered the depth of his misery in respect of the desperateness and
remedilesness of it in respect of Mankind fallen, and all other Creatures.

CHAP. 12.
Of the remedilesness in Man fallen to help himself, and what an inconceivable
and wonderful business it is that will help him, if God discover and give it.

Mankind fallen, as is before shown, into so great sin, sinfulness, and
misery, and under the powerful sentence and curse of the Law, and under the
displeasure of the Almighty, and become an Enemy to him; the door, way, and
passage for God to extend and give forth the fruits of his Love and Mercy to
Men; and so for Men to return, and come into favor with God again, was shut
and become impassible, yea, it was beyond the reach and understanding of Men or
Angels, to open, yea, or find out the way how such a door and passage might be
opened again for Mankind: For,

1. The holy and righteous Law under which Man was fallen, Deuteronomy 27.^6. Gal.
3.10.
still required Obedience to the utmost of all the Righteous Affections and
Services it obliged to, or else to suffer the curse, for the least short coming
of its Requirings; Psalm. ^9.7, 12. Mat. 5.7, 18.
which neither Adam, nor any of his Natural Race, was able to answer in doing,
nor in suffering to overcome: and this Law must not be abolished, but fulfilled
to every Iota of it.

2. The Truth of God that said, Genesis 2.17. Romans 6.23.
In the day thou eatest of that (forbidden) Tree, in dying thou shall die; and
the justice of God that had ordered the cursed Death, as the wages of sin, must
be fulfilled and satisfied, and will admit of no forgiveness or peace till this
Death and Curse be executed, and therein justice satisfied, and Truth
fulfilled. And if Adam or his Natural Race suffer it, they perish in it, and
can no more get out of it again, Psalm. 85.10, 11. and 68.20.
to come into any new terms of Grace: so that less will not serve than such a
suffering in which Mercy and Truth may meet, Truth be fulfilled and spring out
of the Earth; and so Death overcome.

3. Death, Curse, and the Devil that had gotten the Victory over Man, Mat.
12.29. Luke 11.21, 22 Hos. 13.4.
and held him Captive, as a slave in bondage to sin, and under the fear of
Death, will keep their hold and power over Man, till for sin he perish in this
first denounced and deserved Death, unless by a stronger power they be
overcome, subdued and captived; which Adam, and all his Natural Race were not
able to do.

4. The Wound of Guilt and Curse made by sin in the fall, will not be healed,
the breach will not be made up, peace for Mankind with God will not be made,
so as a door and passage may be opened for God, according to Truth and Justice,
to be propitious to Man, and to extend the Fruits of his Love and mercy to him,
and for Mankind to escape perishing in the first Death, and to come into God
for favor again, unless a sin-offering or propitiatory Sacrifice of sufficient
value and worth, to appease the wrath deserved, and satisfy the justice
offended, and purchase a release of all Mankind from the sentence of the Law
into the dispose of the Offerer, be made: which fallen Mankind could never
have found out, nor could all the Creatures made for the use of Mankind, have
been fit or sufficient for such a Sacrifice Psalm. 49.7, 8. and 50.8, 13. Mic.
6.6, 7. Heb. ^0.1, 4.
; into such a depth of misery and helplesness was Mankind fallen, and so far
necessitated to perish.

And yet is not this all the misery and necessity of perishing, that Mankind
fell into by the fall of the first Man; but there is more mischief and evil
still into which Mankind is fallen, that requires more for his help and
recovery, than has in this foresaid in this Chapter been spoken: for though
God should be so gracious, as in Love to Mankind to find out and give such a
Ransom, a propitiatory Sacrifice, as in which in respect of the first
Transgression, and all that necessarily flows from it, Truth is fulfilled,
Justice satisfied, Law answered, the Davil in his first work overthrown, and
Death so overcome, that all shall be raised out of it; the Enmity, that in the
respects beforesaid was in the way between God and Man, slain; and all that was
contrary to Man, taken out of the way, and Mankind released from perishing
under the first sentence, into the dispose of the Ransomer: and so Peace being
made, the door opened, through which Love and Mercies flow from God to
Mankind, by which Men might come in through the same door into favor and
fellowship with God again: surely, for God that was so highly offended by Man,
to do all this for Man, must needs be confessed, unconceiveable and infinitely
great, and free-love to Mankind, deserving and fitly moving the return in
Repentance, Faith, Love and Obedience, in which Men might receive and enjoy
such favor and fellowship with him.

But yet for all this, there is such an evil disposition and enmity against the
mind of God within Man, in the heart of Man, diffusing it self throughout all
the powers of a Man, and ruling the Man, that without something by all this
done for Man without him, there be still farther something supernatural done in
him: Man of himself, though all this be told him, neither can nor will come in
to God again at this door he has opened: for, as may be seen in that said in
Chap. 10.

1. The Heart and Natural Disposition and Inclination in Man, was so poisoned,
with drinking in the suggestions of Satan, Eccles. 7.29. Romans 8.8. Col. 1.21.
Jam. 3.6. Mat. 12.29. 2 Cor. 10.4. 1 John 4.4.
and so filled with high conceits of his knowledge of good and evil, that it is
filled with an aversness and enmity against God, set on fire of Hell, or the
poison of the hellish temptation first received from Satan in the heart; and it
must be a power stronger than the power in Man or Devil, that can master and
overcome this disposition.

2. Satan, though in Chains of Darkness, Iuk. 8.12. 1 Pet. 5.8. 2 Cor. 4.4. 1 John 5.19.
yet according to the Limits permitted him for a time, goes about with all his
malice and subtilty to keep Men out from the knowledge of the great love and
gracious mind of God manifested in the Ransom and Sacrifice found out and
given, that he may so keep them from Repentance and Faith; and so from
receiving the Love of the Truth to be saved, and so from coming into favor and
fellowship with God again: Col. 2.14, 15, 16.
and there needs that power that has overcome, and will overcome him, to help
against this evil, that we may come in to God.

And if God have done this for Mankind also, so as he has exalted the
Sacrificer, Isa. 42.1, 8. and 61.1, 2, 3. John 1.9. Act. 13.46. and 5.31, 32.
and filled him with immeasureable fullness of Spirit to send forth to enlighten
every one that comes into the World, and set him forth a Light and Salvation;
yea, making him a Prince and Savior, to give Repentance and Forgiveness of
sins; 2 Cor. 5.19, 20. Act. 26.18. Joh. 6.44, 45.
so, as Divine Light and Power is extended by him in the means, making known
and applying the Virtue of this Ransom and Sacrifice to the Mind and Heart of
Man, that may enlighten Man's Mind, and flay the Enmity in his disposition,
subdue his aversness, and reconcile his Heart to God; Tit. 3.4, 5.
affording therein power to overcome the wicked One, (without which no Man will
or can come in to God.) Oh how abundantly does the love and pity of God to
Manward appear and flow forth to save! who is able to comprehend all this great
love!

Yet notwithstanding all this, there is something farther needful for Mankind,
even such of them thus far called, that they may abide in this Grace, be
preserved from perishing in a second Death, and have Eternal Life: for though
Peace be made for Men, and all the sins seen in them flowing from the first
Transgression necessarily, and chargeable on them by the Law as they fell under
it in Adam, were charged on the Sacrificer, and are by him cleared and done
away, and Men redeemed from the Curse of the Law; Romans 8.25.
and this by Divine power so made known, that they so far believe, that they
receive Remission of sins past, and so begin to be reconciled to God, and
receive the Atonement: yet through the remaining flesh in them, Gal. 5.17. 1 John 2.16. 1 Pet. 5.8. Jam. 1.14, 15. and 3.2. Heb. 3.12, 13, 19.
and the customs, lusts, fashions and allurements and terrors of the World
without them; and Satan with his manifold Temptations, taking advantage both
from the Flesh and the World, to fasten his Temptations on them, they may be
overtaken many times, and in many things to offend; and if not helped and
healed, sins against Grace are so heinous, they will lead to depart from God,
and cast into danger of perishing in a second Death.

Which, that we may be preserved from, it is needful, That there be virtue and
value enough in the Blood shed, and Sacrifice offered, and fullness of provision
in the Sacrificer and Offerer, that by virtue of his Blood once shed, 1 Timothy
2.5, 6. Heb. 7.27. and 19.12, 14, 15. and 10.10, 12, 14. and 12.24. 1 John 1.7,
9. and 2.1, 2. Luke 5.24. 2 Timothy 4.10.
and Sacrifice once offered, he in continual mediation for us, may freely
forgive and take away our following evils, and so preserve our peace with God,
and send forth following grace and supplies of Spirit to recover and heal us,
and to cause us to abide and grow in grace, and so preserve us from every evil
work unto his heavenly Kingdom, without which we are liable to miscarry: but if
this be afforded us, with both the former, then have we a perfect Savior, a
perfect Salvation, and shall be perfectly recovered. And now though Mankind
had highly offended God, and stirred up wrath and displeasure, and incurred
Death and Curse to be justly executed on them, being also Enemies to God: yet
here is better news for them, than for the fallen Angels; namely, That God,
though angry with, and hating their sinfulness; yea, so, as he could have no
delight or well-pleasedness in them, nor extend loving kindness to them, in
that condition they were in: yet he did not upon Man's fall, turn Enemy to
Mankind; 2 Samuel 14.14.
but loved Mankind still; so far, that in his love and wisdom, his bowels of
compassion yearning on Mankind, he found out a Ransom and mean of Recovery
for Mankind, that for all this Transgression they might not be banished from
him, but might have a way of coming in again to him, and this in his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord; by whom, by virtue of what he has done, received and does,
Psa. 75.3. Romans 2.4.
the old Creation is preserved for a time, and means and mercies extended to
Men in that time, that Men might repent and come in to him, 1 Cor. 15.45. 2
Cor. 5.17. Rev. 21.5.
and a new Creation complete in him, that all that come in to him, may become
new Creatures, and have by him a new Creation completed for them. And of the
dissimilitudes and similitudes between this second and new creation, and that
first creation, a word or two, before I come plainly to set forth what the
Testimony of Christ is.

CHAP. 13.
Of the dissimilitudes and similitudes between the second or new Creation, and
the first and now old Creation.

FIrst, The Dissimilitudes between the two Creations, are these:

1. In the first now old Creation, the first Man, the public Man, Col. 1.15,
16, 17, 18. Rev. 3.14. and 21.5. Romans 11.36.
was made last of all the Creatures made for him; so, as nothing was made by or
through him: but in the second and new Creation, the second public Man is
first made, and then all things in the new Creation, by and through him, as
well as for him.

2. In the first Creation, the first public Man was made of the Dust, and God
breathed into him the Breath of Life, and Man became a living Soul; and being
made Male and Female, was fitted for multiplication of personal beings of his
own kind in a natural way, and was in his perfection at the first, Luke 3.23,
38. Mat. 1.1, 2, etc. Romans 1.3. Mat. 1.23. Luke 1.31, 35. Gal. 4.4. John 1.14.
on the very day he was made. But in the new Creation, the second and last
public Man was in a supernatural way made of the seed of Adam, Noah, Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, David, etc. of a Woman, a Virgin; he being Male only, and so
fitted with Spirit, to bring in spiritually to himself, being a Man in union of
Person with, and so the Son of God. Yet was not the Man Christ in his
perfection at the first Luke 2.40.
, he was first abased, and made perfect through sufferings Heb. 2.10. and 5.8,
9.
, and after service and sufferings perfected Luke 13.32. and 24.26, 46, 47.
; and so, as Man, he was first made that which before he was not, nor as he was
the Word and Son of God, could ever Naturally, or in a Natural way have been:
but he, who was not Naturally Flesh and Man, but God, the Son of God, in a
supernatural way, had a Body given him, and so was made Flesh of the Seed of
David, according to the Flesh, a very Man Heb. 10.5. Job. 1.14. Romans 1.3. 1 Timothy 2.5.
; he being holy and sinless in our Nature, could not naturally have been
subject to the infirmities of Hunger, Thirst, Weariness, Sadness, Pains, and
Mortality; but this was freely for our sakes made so: and so in the likeness of
sinful Flesh, though altogether sinless Heb. 2.17. and 4.15. Romans 8.3. Isa. 53
4.
: he had the holy Law in his heart, and was free, even the Son of God, and
could not Naturally have been a Servant, under the Law, under which Mankind
was fallen; but he was made so, that being under the same bond with us, our
debt might be charged on, and required of him Gal. 4.4. Romans 3.19. Phil. 2.7, 8.
: he being without sin, could not Naturally have been sin or a curse; but for
us was made so 2 Cor. 5.21. Gal. 3.13.
: and he being made all this, and accepting it all, and so performing all in
our Nature, dying for our sins, the Truth of God is fulfilled, according to
that Genesis 2.17. and the justice of God is satisfied, according to that Deuteronomy.
27.26 Gal. 3.10.13. Deuteronomy. 21.23.
. and Mercy and Truth are met, and Righteousness and Peace have kissed each
other Psalm. 85.10.
; yet if Christ be not risen again, we can have no such Forgiveness and
Justification, as to come into favor with God again 1 Cor. 15 14, 15, 17, 18.
: but he is risen from the dead, just, as the public Man for our justification
1 Cor. 15 4. Romans 4.25.
, and has overcome Death, and him that had the power of Death; and so has
spoiled Principalities and Powers Heb. 2.14. Col. 2.12, 15. 2 Timothy 1.9.
; so as Truth is sprung out of the Earth Psalm. 85.11.
. Then he ascended in that very body which died, and was raised again, and by
the Eternal Spirit offered himself a spotless Sacrifice to God; and with the
Virtue of his own Blood, entered the holy of holies, and so made peace, and
obtained Eternal Redemption Act. 1.9, 10, 11. Heb. 8.3, 4. and 10.10, 12. and
9.12, 14.
. And God also for this has exalted him Phil. 2.10, 11.
; and taken up his well-pleasedness in him, and set him on his right hand Mat.
17.5. Heb. 8.1. and 10.12.
, and released and given over all Mankind to him for his dispose, and made him
Lord of all Romans 14.9. Act. 2.34, 36. and 10.36.
, and Head of the Church Col. 1.18, 19.
, and filled him with the immeasurable fullness of the Holy Ghost, to preach the
Gospel, and call sinners, and open the eyes of the blind, etc. to draw Men to
himself, that believing on him they might be his Church, and he so confer his
own Privileges on them Isa. 42.1, 8. and 61.1, 4. Joh. 1.12. Phil. 2.10, 11.
Act. 17.30, 31.
; and that he may raise all Men from the first death, that he died for them,
and bring them before him to be judged by him according to the Gospel, Romans
2.16. and 14.9, 12. 2 Cor. 5.10.

And thus also has God testified of him, and set him forth the Propitiation
for the sins of the whole World 1 John 2.2.
, for Men to receive Remission of sins through Faith in his Blood, and so to
bring them in to God Romans 3.25. Act. 10.43. and 26.18.
. And thus is he perfect in himself, the second and last public Man, the Lord
from Heaven, the spiritual Man, the quickening Spirit, in whom the Nature of Man
is restored, and married to the Divine Nature in the person of the Son of God;
in which is rich Provision of pardon, peace, wisdom, righteousness, holiness,
redemption, and eternal life; all to be enjoyed in coming in by his call to
believe on him 1 Cor. 15.44, 45, 46, 47. Mat. 22.1, 4. Prove. 9.1, 6. Col. 2.9,
10. and 1.28. 1 Cor. 1.30.
: and such a one is the Man Christ, God-Man, God with us, in our Nature for us
Mat. 1.23.
, glorified with the Father's own self, as the public Man, with the Glory he
had with the Father before the World was, which for a while he laid aside for
our sakes, that in his re-assuming it again, we believing on him, might come to
partake of glory with him Joh. 17.4, 5, 9. Col. 3.4.
. And this is an higher business than that Genesis 1.26, 27. and 2.7. if not as
high as that which was unlawfully aspired to by some Angels, and the first Man:
and this is the Christ, nor can there be any Election in him, or Belief on him,
but as he is such a one, and so to be considered as such a public Man, the new
and spiritual Man.

3. In the first Creation, the first public Man had all Mankind in him in his
loins, to come naturally by descent from him; and so sinned in his sinning,
according to that account and language, Heb. 7.9, 10. and so he stood in the
room or stead of none, and undertook for none, but those that were in him, and
Naturally to descend from him, and so Naturally his own, and Naturally
interessed, they in him, and he in them, and he Naturally obliged to them. But
in the new Creation, the Son of God, the Word that was made Flesh, and the
second public Man before considered, as his work done in his own Body, and he
in that Body glorified, he had none of Mankind in him, none his Friends or
Brethren, and peculiar Ones, in and with him to lay aside such Glory as he had
with the Father before the World was, to be supernaturally made Flesh as he
was, and to offer the propitiatory sacrifice as he did; no, not in him, (as
there must have been) according to that language, Heb. 7.9, 10. if there had
been any such in him; nor did he interpose to stand in the room and stead, and
undertake to abase himself, and overcome Death, and offer the propitiatory
Sacrifice for himself, or any his peculiar Friends that were in him, and loved
him, but for the first Man and his Natural Race, that were not only out of him,
sinners and enemies to him, as he undertook for them, but are also found such
when he first calls, or begins to work on them Romans 5.6, 8. 1 Pet. 3.18. 1 Timothy 1.15. Mat. 9.13. Luke 5.32.
: so that his love, his undertaking, and all his grace and obligations to Men,
are unspeakable, gracious, great, and free.

Nor has he any other to make his seed, but such as are first the seed, and of
the seed of the first Man; him, 1 Cor. 15.46, 49. Jam. 1.18. Ephesians. 2.4, 10. 2
Cor. 5, 17.
and those that come forth of him, and bear his Image, are they from among whom
and of whom, by a spiritual way, he brings in to himself, and makes them new
Creatures.

4. In the first Creation, 1 John 3 5. Phil. 2.6-10. Jer. 50.4, 5, 6. Joh. 17.4,
6, 7. Psalm. 68.18.
the first Man's work and business was easy, but to dress the Garden, order the
Creatures, and forbear eating of one of the Trees in the Garden, and so to keep
sin out of the World; which yet he did not. But in the new Creation, the second
Man had a great, painful and mighty work to do, to undergo abasement in shame
and suffering, to offer an invaluable Sacrifice, to take away sin, appease
wrath, make an Atonement, overcome Death and the Devil, to purchase an
Inheritance, and receive Spirit in the Man, to send forth even to the
rebellious, that the Lord might dwell among them, etc. which also he has
faithfully and fully done.

5. In the first Creation, Genesis 1.1. Psalm. 33.6. and 75.3. 2 Pet. 3.5-7, 10,
11, 12. Romans 8. 19, 20, 21. Rev. 21.1-5.
the Heaven and the Earth was made of no pre-existing matter or being, only
the Word of the Lord gave the very being thereto: but in the new Creation, it
is of the old Heaven and Earth dissolved, melted, and overturned, and then made
new, new created to as good and better estate than at the first.

6. The old Creation was finished in six days, Genesis 1. and 2.1, 2. Exodus
20.11. Isa. 65.12, 19. 2 Pet. 3.3-15. Romans 8.19, 20, 21.
each day consisting of evening and morning, consisting of twenty four hours,
and the Rest and Sabbath of the Lord on the seventh day. But the new Creation
is longer before it be finished and brought forth in its full perfection to
open view, it is likely as many thousands of years as the first was of days, it
being the whole time of the supportation and decaying of the old.

And such Dissimilitudes is shown in Scripture to be between the first and now
old Creation, and the second and new Creation.

Secondly, Yet notwithstanding there is also a true resemblance in many
similitudes between them, and that not only in this;

1. That they both are the work of one and the same God: but also in this; 1.
Genesis 1.1, 2. Psa. 33.6. 1 John 1.1, 2, 3, 4. Col. 1.15, 16-19.
That as the first was made by the Word and Spirit of the Lord breathed forth
by the Father through the Word, that is, the Son: even so was the second and
new Creation also begun, and shall be finished. 2. Genesis 1.1, 26.
That as in the first, the Heavenly and Earthy Matter was first made and
framed, before any other particular Creatures; and they after by the command
and word of the Lord, formed and made in and out of them: even so the second
and new Creation, (in the counsels and purpose of God, and actual consent and
Agreement of the Word, the Son of God, and now also in act by the Word made
Flesh) the original and first being, and that which gives being to all, and in
and out of which, and through which all particulars are formed and made new,
was first prepared, made and formed in the Man Christ; in whom, the
Restoration being made, God and Man united in one Person, through whom the
Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father; and so by the word and command of the
Lord, the particulars in their order are formed and made new: and so Jesus
Christ the Son of God, and the Son of Man, even he himself is called the
beginning of the Creation of God Rev. 3.14.
, the firstborn of every Creature Col. 1.15.
, the first-begotten, and firstborn from the dead Rev. 1.5. Col. 1.18.
; before Abraham was, he is Joh. 8.56, 58.
: the Root of David Rev. 22 16.
, the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end Rev. 21 6.
; yea, he that works with the Father, and whatsoever the Father does, he does
the same, John 5.19, 23, 26, 27. he is the beginning, and by him are all
things. 3. That as in the first Creation, in respect of particulars to be
formed, Genesis 1.3. John 1.4, 5. 2 Cor. 4.6.
God first commanded and formed the Light for his Creatures: even so in the new
Creation, in bringing in particulars, the first thing commanded to come forth,
is Light; and this, shining in the Face of Christ, into the Heart of those he
makes new Creatures. 4. That as in the first Creation, the first public Man
was first made a perfect Man, fit for multiplication, Genesis 1.28. and 4.1, 2.
and 5.3. Romans 5.19. 1 Cor. 15.48.
and his seed and posterity after, to come forth of him, one after one, by
degrees, and all in his likeness, such as he was when they come forth of him:
even so in the new Creation, the second public Man is first made perfect, and
his Seed in a spiritual way and supernaturally to be after brought in to him,
and that also one after another, by degrees Romans 16.7. Act. 2.41, 47.
, and all by degrees framed into the likeness of Christ into whom they are
brought Rem. 5.17. 1 Cor. 15.48. 2 Cor. 5.17.
, Ephesians. 2.10. 5. That as in the first Creation, the Man and Woman fell and lost
the benefit of all, by questioning and letting go the Word of the Lord, Genesis
3.16.
in hearing and pondering the voice of the Serpent; and so in believing the
same, looked on and beheld the forbidden Fruit, and desired it; and so took and
eat of it, even so in the new Creation, Men and Women are drawn in to Christ,
and participation of the benefit thereof, by letting go and turning from the
delusions of Satan, in hearing and minding the voice of Christ in the Gospel,
and so believing the same, that they behold him as discovered therein, and so
desire him, and accept and feed on him Act. 3.26. and 26.18. with Job. 5.26.
Isa. 53.3. and Job. 11.25, 26. and 6.54, 55, 56, 57.
. 6. In the first Creation, the deed and offense of the first Man, and
condemnation of him for it, did reach to all Mankind, and was the offense and
condemnation of all in him, as the public Man, and that so verily and
efficaciously, that in coming forth Naturally from him, they should verily
partake of the same, and bear his likeness; though yet none of the sons of Men,
could in their own individual persons, so partake of and feel the same, until,
and but as, and when in a Natural way, they come to have their personal beings
of him, and so come forth from him: even so in the new Creation, the deed and
righteousness of the second Man; and his justification, as he was the public
Man, did reach unto all Men; and was so far, and in that sense on them all to
justification of life from the first sentence, and escape out of the first
death in and through him as the second public Man: Romans 5.12, 18, 9. 2 Cor.
5.14, 15, 17, 18, 19. Phil. 1.10, 11. Gal. 3.26, 29.
and though all shall one day be freed from that first sentence, and raised out
of that first death by him, to acknowledge him Lord to the glory of God; yet do
or can none of the sons of Men, in their own individual persons, partake of or
enjoy the benefit of that freedom, righteousness, and justification, but as
they are brought in to believe that done by him; nor of Eternal Life, but as
they are in that believing spiritually united unto him; and so in such a being
in him, are made new Creatures.


In which respects, as there is such similitude between the first and second
Creation, and the first and second Man, and interests of their seeds in them,
and what they receive from them; Romans 5.14.
so the first Adam was a Type or figure of the second, that was to come: and so
we may say of the natural Tree of Life; and so of diverse things in the first
Creation, there was something typical in them; the Truth whereof, in a
superabounding manner is in Christ, whence he is called Adam, and The Tree of
Life, The green Olive Tree, The Tree by the Rivers of Waters, The true Vine,
The Fountain of living Waters, The Door, Heb. 10.1. Col. 2.17. Romans 16.25, 26.
1 John 1.1, 2, 3.
The Way, The Rock, The Foundation, etc. not, that there were or are no such
things naturally in being, as appertaining to the old Creation: but, because
the Truth, Excellency, and Life, shadowed out by all these things, is found in
Christ, and enjoyed in enjoying him in the new Creation: and we know there is
more in the Truth, than any shadows could type out, and the Gospel has now
more clearly revealed the same. And I hope these things considered, that are
writ from the beginning of this first part of this Treatise till now, and
understood and believed, as far as they are plainly affirmed in the Scripture
here and there, in many places written, and in this writing collected, and on
the Margent quoted; the Sayings of the Gospel in the Testimony of Christ, will
appear plain, bearing forth their own import and sense: and the Testimony of
Christ being known, all Truth being included in it, and flowing from it, we
shall by that be led into all Truth, and so far as is for us meet and
profitable, understand what we read in the Scriptures, so far as to discern
Truth from Error in all Doctrines and Sayings brought unto us. I shall
therefore proceed in the next part, according to the Scripture, assaying to
declare the Testimony of Christ.

An Explicit Declaration of the Testimony of Christ, etc.
PART II.
CHAP. I.
Of the Testimony of Christ.

THe Testimony of Christ is that Testimony, and Witness, and Doctrine of
Christ, 1. Which God the Father has by his Holy Spirit immediately first given
of Christ, Genesis 3.15. and 22.18. Act. 3.18, 24. Luke 1.70. 1 Pet. 1.11, 12.
as the promised Seed, and he in whom all Nations shall be blessed; and after
mediately by his Spirit in Moses, and all the following Prophets, concerning
his coming and suffering, and the Glory that should follow: and after all this,
immediately to John Baptist, both who he was, and what a one he is, and how
well-pleased he is in him Mat. 3.17.
; and after that, mediately by his Spirit in and by John Baptist, that he is
the Christ, upon whom the Spirit rests, full of Grace and Truth, by whom it
comes; and that he is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world,
and that he that believes on him has Eternal Life Joh. 1.16, 17, 29-34. and
3.27-36.
: and after this, immediately to three of the Apostles and first Witnesses of
Christ Mat. 17.5. 2 Pet. 1.17, 18.
; and mediately likewise before by types Heb. 8.5.
, and Angels, and by Zacharias Luke 1.32, 33, 67-79. and 2.11, 30-34.
, and old Simeon; as also in his own Ministration by the mighty works done by
him in his Name, John 5.36. and 14.10, 11. 2. Joh. 3.16, 17. and 5.17-30. and
6.27-69. and 10. and 12.50.
Which Jesus Christ himself received from the Father, and testified in his
Ministration unto Men; which also he did explicate and give unto his Apostles,
and first Witnesses, to testify and witness, Luke 24.25, 26, 27, 44, 45, 46,
47, 48. Joh. 15.15, 27. and 17.6, 7, 8. Act. 1.8. 3. Joh. 14.26. and 15.26. and
16.7-15. Act. 5.32. Ephesians. 3.5. 1 John 1.1, 2. 2 Timothy 1.10.
Which the Holy Ghost did witness to, and in and by the Apostles and first
Witnesses, with the clear opening and revelation of the Mystery formerly
hidden, till Christ had opened the holy of holies, offered the acceptable
Sacrifice, and sat down on the right Hand of God, and sending forth the Holy
Ghost, and by the Gospel in his Testimony opening the door to immortality and
eternal life. 4. Act. 5.32. and 13.25-39. Romans 1.1-5. and 16.25, 26.
Which also the Apostles and first VVitnesses have by the same Holy Spirit
testified, witnessed, preached, written and recorded according to the
revelation of the Mystery, Ephesians. 3.3, 4. Phil. 3.1. whence the whole Scripture
is said to testify of Christ, John 5.39. of which more is said, Part 1. Chap.
1, and 2.


And this Testimony, VVitness and Record, is called the Record and VVitness of
God, and of Christ, and of the Spirit 1 John 5.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Joh. 3.33. 1
Cor. 1.6. Rev. 1, 2. and 20.4. 2 Timothy 1.8.
; and it is also called the Testimony, Record, VVitness and Word of the
Apostles and first VVitnesses of Christ, because they bare it forth and left it
upon record 2 These. 1.10. Joh. 17.20.
: and because it is of Christ, by Christ, and according to the appointment of
Christ, by his Apostles opening the things of Christ, it is called the Doctrine
of Christ 2 John 9.
; and in every respect it is one and the same, the Testimony of Jesus Christ
Rev. 19.10.
: and in this Testimony so clearly come forth, is Jesus Christ plainly set
forth who he is, what a one he is, whence he is, what he became, what he has
done and is become; what he does, and for whom; what he will do for some, and
who they be; and what he will do against others, and who they be; how the good
to be enjoyed, and the peril to be avoided: and all this is full and plain in
the Testimony.

1. Who he is; and that is not Adam, Seth, Enoch, and so none of the Prophets
before John Baptist; nor was John Baptist the Christ, nor any of the Apostles
or VVitnesses that followed Luk 3 and Joh. 1. 1 Pet. 1.11, 12. 2 Cor. 4.5.
: nor is it the Church, or any Society of Men, though such as do indeed bear
his Name, though they be of his mystical Body (as resembled by a King, whose
Body is the Commonwealth; or a General, whose Body is the Army; or a Major,
whose Body is the Corporation: yet are not the Commons the King or chief
Magistrate, nor is the Army the General, nor the Corporation the Major) and so,
Mat. 23.8. 1 Cor. 8.6. Col. 1.18. Ephesians. 1.22, 23.
though the Head and Body be one, yet the Body is not the Head; so the Church
is not the Head, the Husband, the Lord, the King of Saints, the Christ; but the
person of Christ is all that, and none but he: so, that the Church, Col. 1.15,
21.26, 27. 2 Cor. 13.3, 5. 1 John 3.24. Romans 1.18. 2 Cor. 4.5.
though one with Christ, is not the Christ; nor is it any inward Frame, or
spiritual Light or Disposition in the Heart of the Reliever: though this being
right, as flowing from him, and effected in such as are believing on him, is
even the Spirit of Christ, by which he is in them, and dwells in them; yet is
not this the Christ, the person of Christ:

But Jesus, that very Jesus, and no other but he, that was born of a Virgin
espoused to one Joseph a Carpenter, Mat. 1, and 2, etc. Luke 2, and 3, etc.
and born in the time of Caesar Augustus, when Herod was King of Judea, and in
Bethlem, in an Inn, and Stable in that Inn, and circumcised the eighth day, and
his name called Jesus; who was carried into Egypt, and returned again to
Nazareth in Galilee, and there lived a time, and after was baptized of John in
Jordan, and then went about preaching the Gospel, and working Miracles, called
Disciples and chose Apostles, suffered, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
died, was buried, and rose again in the same Body, and appeared often to his
Disciples, who saw, and heard, and felt him, and received commandments from
him, and then he blessed them, Act. 1, and 2, and 3.
and ascended up to Heaven in that Body of his, and fate down on the right hand
of God, Mat. 16.16. Joh. 6 69.
and sent down the Holy Ghost to his Witnesses, and remains in the Heavens
till the time of the restitution of all things; this is that Jesus, and this
Jesus is the Christiand all that the four Evangelists writ, Luke 1.4. John
20.31. Act. 2.36. and 3.13, 16. and 4.11, 12, etc. and 17.2, 3. 1 John 5, 1.
Joh. 1.12, 13.
was to certify us of this, that we might believe, that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God; and that in believing, we might have life through his Name. And
so the Apostles preached, that he is the Christ, and proved by the Scripture,
that this very Jesus whom they preached, is the Christ: he that believes, that
this Jesus is the Christ, is born of God; and he that denies it, is a liar,
and Antichrist, 1 Ioh. 2.22. More of this is shown, part. 1. chapter 1.

2. Joh. 1.1. Romans 9.5. Tit. 3.13. Heb. 1. 2 Timothy 2.5. Joh. 3.16, 17. Isa. 53.
Joh. 5. Luke 1 31. Joh. 1.14. Romans 1.1-4. Mat. 16.16. Joh. 14 14, 18. Romans
5.17, 18. 1 Cor. 86. 1 Pet. 3.18. and 4.1. 1 John 3.16. Act. 20.28. Heb. 2.14.
What a one he is, is also in the Testimony shown, namely, that he is God, the
great God, God over all, blessed for eever; that he is Man, a true and very
Man, of the Seed of David, etc. that he is the Son of God, the only proper and
natural Son of God, the Son of God by Divine and unconceivable Generation,
according to the Divine Nature, and by a supernatural conception, and by the
Resurrection from the Dead, and by union in person with the Word, and
wel-pleasedness with the Father, according to the humane Nature, as he is Man,
and God-Man, the Son of God, the Son of Man, in one person, being one and the
only proper Son of God, the Christ, one Lord Jesus Christ, in respect of the
union of two Natures in one person, that is, one Son of God; that which is done
by or in either Nature, may in respect of person be said of both: so, though he
was put death in the flesh, and God cannot die; yet God is said to have laid
down his Life for us, and his Blood called God's own Blood; and so, though not
Man, but God, could overcome Death, yet this Man is said by Death to overcome
Death: so with respect to each Nature, he is diversely spoken of, in respect of
the Divine Nature, Joh. 10.30.
even when he was on earth; yet the Father and he were one, even in Greatness
and Power: and yet, as he was man, John 14.28.
, to suffer and offer Sacrifice, the Father was greater than he; and having
offered the Sacrifice, he is exalted above all Principality and Power, 1 Pet
3.22. Heb. 8.1. Col. 2.9.
and set down on the right Hand of God; Angels, Powers and Authorities made
subject to him, and the fullness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily; Col. 1.
Heb. 1.3.
so, as all compleatness is in him, he is the Brightness of the Glory of God,
and the express Image of his Person, the Image of the invisible God, he is one
with God, Heb. 5. Isa. 4.2. Cent. 5.10.
God is in him, as is said, He is God; he is one with Mankind, the Nature of
Man is in him, as is said, He is Man; a fit, able, loving and wonderful perfect
Savior, Beauty and Glory, Comely and Excellent, White and Ruddy, the
Standard Bearer, and chiefest of ten thousand, the Savior of sinners, whose
Work and Office is to save sinners, the Lover of the Righteous, whose Office is
to preserve the Righteous; such a one he is, even the Christ, 1 Timothy 1.15. Psa.
11.7. Rev. 15.3. Heb. 7. Act. 3.22. Isa. 42.1, 8. and 61.1 4. Heb. 4.14, 15,
16, and 5.2. and 7.15. and 4.12.
the King of Saints, the King of Kings, the Lord of Hosts and Rules, the Great
High Priest, that orders the whole Worship of God, by whom Men may approach to
God, the High Priest over the House of God, the great Prophet, that reveals
the Father, and teaches the things of God: in a word, he is full of Spirit,
full of love and compassion, knowing all things, and able to do all things;
such a one he is.

3. Whence he is, and that is even from Heaven. It was the infinite Wisdom and
Goodness of God that found out this Ransom: 2 Samuel 14.14. Job 33.24. Joh. 3.16,
17. 1 John 4.9, 10, 14. Romans 5.6, 8, 10. Tit. 3.4. Joh. 1.1, 14. and 17.5. and
16.28. Act. 3. Joh. 1.4, 5, 9. Act. 14.17. Romans 2.4. Isa. 45.22.
it was the infinite Pity and Love of God to Mankind, that moved him to give
and send forth this his Son to become Man, and by his Death and Sacrifice to be
the Savior of the World. He was with God in the bosom of God, glorified with
God's own self: he came forth from the Father, and came into the world; again
he left the world, and went to the Father, and now there in his glorified boby
remains in the Heavens, and from thence by his Spirit, beholding and
discerning all things, he sends forth of the beams of his light and goodness,
(and so the Father through him) in Testimonies of his goodness, in mercies and
means to draw Men to Repentance, and looking to him, that they may be saved by
him: and so Righteousness flows down from Heaven Psalm. 85.11.
: but especially, and more abundantly in the Ministration of the Gospel; in
which God sends and gives his Son to open the eyes of the blind, and turn
them, etc. Act. 3.26. and 26.18.
. and is giving to men the bread of life to feed on Joh. 6.32.
, and Jesus Christ in that Ministration is coming down spiritually from Heaven,
the bread of God, the bread of life, giving life, that Men may feed on him and
live Joh. 6.27, 33, 48.
; and so is God the Father of lights, from whom comes every good and perfect
gift and giving Jam. 1.17.
: and Jesus Christ is the Lord from Heaven heavenly 1 Cor. 15.47.
; and so Jesus Christ by his Spirit, the wisdom of God in its Teachings and
saving Operations, does not first ascend or spring from within out of the
wisdom, heart and frame in Men: the wisdom that so does ascend, is earthy,
sensual, devilish; but this wisdom is above, and descends from above, and so
is pure, etc. Jam. 3.15, 17.18.
. and enters into the heart, and so springs up into suitable fruits; so that
Christ, and Faith in Christ, and the things of Christ, are from above, from the
grace, favor and free-gift of God, even as his next personal coming will be of
Gods sending him from Heaven Act. 3.20.
.

4. For what remains to be said, viz. what he became, what he has done, what
he is become, what he does, and for whom; and what he will do for some, and who
they be; and what he will do against others, and who they be; this being the
Subject of this following Discourse in this part of this Treatise; and that in
which, if in all said, that is here said, Who he is, what a one he is, and
whence he is, be remembered, the whole Testimony of Christ is comprehended: I
shall therefore speak of these things more largely and explicately, considering
them in three distinct Branches, as I find them set forth in the Testimony of
Christ in the Scripture: the first, concerning his first coming; and therein,
his abasement, and exaltation, and sacrifice offered: the second, concerning
his leaving of the world, in respect of bodily presence, and sitting at the
right Hand of God, and there mediating: the third, concerning his coming again
to reign and judge. And these three I shall treat of under these three terms,
that is to say, Of his Oblation of Sacrifice; and, Of his Mediation and
Intercession; and, Of his personal coming again in Glory. These three also,
each in the Testimony of it including other; his Oblation including his
Mediation, as the next end of it, and his coming again in Glory, as the
ultimate end of it; his Mediation and Intercession in the Testimony of it,
including his Oblation, as that by virtue whereof he mediateth and intercedeth;
and, his coming again, as that for which his Mediation has its tendency to
prepare Men: and his personal coming again in Glory, is affirmed to be for the
very cause of his sufferings and sacrifice, and that in which the fullness and
perfection of his Oblation and Mediation, in the fruits thereof, shall clearly
and fully appear; whence they all agree in one, and are spoke of, sometime
together, and sometime distinctly, and sometime more special of one, and sometime
more special of another; as will after appear: and so I shall speak of each
distinctly.

The first Branch of the Testimony of Christ.
CHAP. 2.
Of the Oblation of Christ.

BY the Oblation of Christ, I mean that offering up of himself a Sacrifice to
God, to make satisfaction and propitiation for the sins of Men: and I am
persuaded Mr. Owen and the residue of such learned Men, do mean the same by the
Oblation of Christ. And whatever any other may pretend to mean, yet that is the
thing under consideration, while that word Oblation is used in this business;
otherwise, this word Oblation may be used for other offerings and other
sacrifices, as well as the word Ransom is used, sometime for ransoming by price,
sometime for ransoming by strong hand, sometime for procuring an interest in the
ransomed, sometime for freeing the ransomed out of trouble, etc. as also the
word Redemption sometime is used for redemption of a Friend by purchase, sometime
for redemption out of the hands of an Enemy by strong hand, sometime of the
redeemed purchased or redeemed from other things by a price given to
themselves; sometime the word is used for redeeming Men of God, sometime for
redeeming out of others unto God: so that the confounding these terms, and
using them one for another, as all one in every sentence where they are used,
signifying one and the same manner of thing, is that by which the unwary are
deceived, and strife about words occasioned, while the thing it self is not
stood to. I therefore have here expressed my meaning, and so do accept of, and
use this phrase here, The Oblation of Christ; meaning thereby, His offering up
himself a sacrifice to God, to make satisfaction and propitiation for the sins
of Men.

1. That Jesus Christ, the Man Christ, that is Emmanuel, God with us, did offer
up himself, and so is the Priest, Heb. 7.27, 28.

2. That the whole humane Nature in the Body of the Man Christ, was that which
he offered; and so, that himself in that Body is the Sacrifice which he
offered, Heb. 10, 5-10.

3. That it was by the Power of the Divine Nature, and so by the Eternal
Spirit, by which he was upheld in suffering, and overcame Death, and offered up
himself a spotless Sacrifice, and so also he is the Altar, that upheld,
sanctified and dignified the gift and offering; Heb. 9 2, 14.
and all this, that Jesus Christ is the Priest, the Sacrifice, and the Altar:
the Babylonish Darkness is so removed, that (unless in some Allegorical
Dreamers) I know no difference in this, but that there is an union of Spirit
among us in this, which I wish that we may keep in the bond of peace: and the
Lord so increase our union more. Therefore passing these things over, I shall
observe about the Oblation of Christ, these four things as found in Scripture,
namely, 1. What it was that was offered up in Sacrifice. 2. Who it was that
offered up this Sacrifice. 3. To whom this Sacrifice was by him offered. 4. For
whom, and in whose behalf this Sacrifice was offered. 5. For what this
Sacrifice was offered for Men. 6. To, and for what end he therefore offered
this Sacrifice.


And all these are clearly pointed out to us by the Apostle speaking of it,
Tit. 2.14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. Therefore I
shall consider the points, as plainly affirmed in this Text, compared with and
explicated by other places, speaking plainly of the very same things.

CHAP. 3.
1. What that was which was offered up in Sacrifice.

IT is clear and express in this Tit. 2.14. he gave himself; so its said, Heb.
7.27. he offered up himself Heb. 9.14.
; and so it is called the Sacrifice of himself Heb. 9.26.
; and, the offering of the Body of Jesus Christ once for all Heb. 10.10.
. So this Body, this humane Nature of Chrst, the Body which was given him to
that end, and which he so willingly took into union of person with himself Heb.
10.5, 7.
; that was it he gave and offered up a Sacrifice. He from Eternity was the
natural Son of God, and so in the form of God, equal with the Father, glorified
with his own self, one and the same God; and was not then before time naturally
Man, nor according to the work of God in the first Creation naturally could be
so. It was the work and beginning of a new Creation; in which, in respect of
the Nature of Man taken into union with himself, he became for a time not only
inferior to the Father, but also to the Angels; yea, in some sense to the
Rulers, and rich among Men Psalm. 22.6. Isa. 53.2, 3.
: and he came forth, not in a natural way, but was made that which naturally he
was not, and so he was made flesh, made of a woman of the Seed of David, made
under the Law, made subject to our infirmities, as is foreshewn. And this Body
of Jesus was perfectly holy, and sinless, and had its first, and has its
continual being in union with the Son of God; and so by the Grace of personal
union is one and the same Son; and so Emmanuel, God with us, in our Nature, and
for us; the humane Nature in him distinct, though never divided from the
Divine: so that this humane Nature or Body of Christ, is not only sinless,
just, holy; but also exceeding precious, and beyond all our valuation for
excellency and worthiness; yet in this his personal body, was he under the Law
for us, and brought before the Judgment Seat for us, and condemned, and put to
death in the flesh for sins committed by us in the flesh Romans 8.3. 2 Cor. 5.21.
Gal. 3.13.
; he himself bare our sins in his own Body to (or on) the Tree, being put to
death in the flesh 1 Pet. 2.24. and 3.18.
; and by death he overcame death, and him that had the power of death Heb. 2.14.
, and so rose again just, and for our justification, in the same Body that died
1 Cor. 15.3, 4.
, and by the Eternal Spirit, ascended in that Body, by (or with the virtue of)
his own blood, into Heaven, and offered that spotless Body of his (which had
satisfied for our sins by death, and overcome death, and risen just) a
Sacrifice to God Heb. 9.12, 14. and 10.5-10, 14.
; and God has accepted him, and taken up his wellpleasedness and dwelling in
him, and glorified him in the humane Nature also, with the glory that he had in
person with him before the world was, and has born Testimony of him. And this
the Oblation, Gift, Ransom, Sacrifice offered by Jesus Christ the second
public Man, a matchless and invaluable Sacrifice, which excluded all other
Sacrifices, and all other works of Righteousness from being it, or any part of
it: this Body of Christ that was crucified for us, it, and it alone, is the
Sacrifice which in his Oblation he offered to God for us.

CHAP. 4.
2. Who it was that offered up this Sacrifice.

THis is here also in Tit. 2.14. plainly expressed to be our Savior Jesus
Christ, who gave himself for us; plainly, it was Jesus Christ, he himself, that
did freely give himself: Peter also speaking of the sufferings of Christ, and
having expressly named Jesus Christ that suffered for us, says of him, Who his
own self bare our sins in his own body 1 Pet. 2.22, 24.
: and our Savior Christ says of himself, I lay down my life, that I might
take it again; no man takes it from me, but I lay it down of my self; I have
power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again: This commandment have
I received of my Father Joh. 10.17, 18.
. And so it is often plainly and expressy said, he gave himself for our
offenses, Christ has loved us, and given himself for us; he gave himself a
ransom, etc. he offered up himself, etc. Gal. 1.4. Ephesians. 5.2. 1 Timothy 2.6. Heb.
7.27.
.

If it be replied, That God the Father, he gave his only begotten Son, he made
his Soul an offering for sin, he spared not his own Son, but delivered him up
for us all Joh. 3 6. Isa. 53 10. Romans 8.32.
;

I answer, This is no contradiction or unsaying of any thing foresaid; but
rather, an illustration and confirmation of the approvedness, goodness and
excellency of that his giving himself a Sacrifice; not only in that no other
Man did, and that he himself did it by the Divine will and authority of the
Father; in respect of which will and appointment, the Father did; and in
respect of acting and fulfilling that will, he himself did: but more also in
this respect, Joh. 10.30. 1 John 5 7.
that the Father and he are one, in respect of Divine Essence; and in respect
of both Natures in the person of the Son, Joh. 5.17, 18, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23.
the Father and the Son are both one in love to Mankind, and so both one in
will and design; so, as also they work together: so, that the Son can do
nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do; and what things soever the
Father does, those also does the Son likewise; and also in that the Father
fitted him with a Body for this business, and appointed and sent him forth to
do it: and even so he willingly accepted the appointment, Heb. 10.5, 7, 8, 9,
10, 12.
and took the Body, and came to do, and did it; and so, with free and ready
will, and oneness of will with the Father, he did offer up himself in that body
of his, once for all; so, that the saying, He gave and offered up himself, is
not contradicted by saying the Father gave him; but receives confirmation and
illustration of the goodness and excellency of this his gift and giving; yea,
it opens to us the right understanding of it: he came and did it, not barely of
himself, Joh. 8 42. and 1 John 5.6.
but in union of will and approbation of the whole three in one God: the Father
sent him, he came, and the Holy Ghost witnessed of him; Gal. 4.4.
the Father sent him forth made of a woman of the Seed of David, and the Holy
Ghost sanctified that Seed in the womb of the Virgin, and framed him a Body
thereof, Luke 1.35.
uniting it in the very framing, to the person of the Son of God; and so it was
not the Father, nor the Holy Ghost; John 1.14. Romans 1.3.
but the Son, that is, the Word was made flesh, of the Seed of David, yet the
Father by the Spirit made it so: and the Son accepting willingly to receive
this humane Nature into union of person with himself, and to be thus abased, he
is truly said to have made himself of no reputation, Phil. 2.7, 8.
and took upon him the form of a Servant, and humbled himself; so it was not
the Father or the Holy Ghost that did die, Joh. 10.17, 18 1 Pet. 3.18.
but the Son in the humane Nature or Body which he took, he laid down his life
for us, being put to death in the flesh; neither was it the Father or the Holy
Ghost that rose from the dead, Joh. 10.18. Ephesians. 4.9, 10.
but the Son; and yet the Son in that Body of his, the Father by the Holy Ghost
did raise him; yet was it he in that very Body that died, that rose from the
dead: even so it was not the Father nor the Holy Ghost that offered the
Sacrifice, but Jesus Christ himself in oneness of will with the Father, Heb.
9.14. Psa. 110.1. Heb. 1.13. Heb. 1.3. and 10.12.
and by or through the power of the Holy Ghost, he did offer up himself, his
own Body a Sacrifice without spot to God, even the Father, who has accepted
him, and set him on his right hand; and so also, as having finished and
completed his oblation, and being accepted, he sat down on the right hand of
the Majesty on high: so that there is no exclusion or denial of the works of
the Father or Holy Ghost, about the provision, preparation, offering and
acceptance of this Oblation, in saying Christ himself offered it, but only the
affirmation of the act and freeness of Jesus Christ himself in so offering; and
that he himself has done it, yea, completely done it, and once for all; so, as
it shall no more be so done by himself, nor remains for any other to offer him
in any sort to God a Sacrifice for sins, nor to add any thing to complete that
offering, it being completed by himself already once for all: and as Man, he
himself alone, and by himself, though for others, did offer this Sacrifice; so,
as there was no Creature, either Man or Angel, that did, or in respect of real
acting, can, in any sense of offering, be said to have offered the same with
him, or to be any part of the offering offered by him: but he was both that
offering and offerer, and no other Man in or with him, no, not in that sense of
which it is said, Levi also, who received Tithes, Heb. 7.9, 10.
paid Tithes in Abraham; for he was yet in the loins of his Father, when
Melchizedec met him: so, as Levi, though not in person, yet in specie; though
not with his own hands, yet by, and in, and with his Father, in whose loins he
was, and from whom he naturally proceeded, he did so, and in that manner also,
pay Tithes in Abraham; but so can none be said to have offered this offering
and Sacrifice, by, in, and with Christ; for Jesus Christ had none in his Loins
to come forth of him, as Abraham had, or as Adam had: such a conceit would be
very carnal, gross and erroneous. Christ took the Nature of the first Adam, and
so of all Mankind that were in the first Adam's Loins, that in that Nature,
having suffered and overcome Death, and being filled with the Holy Ghost, he
might be, and so is, a spiritual man, to quicken and draw in of the Sons of the
natural Man to himself, and so make them his spiritual Seed that were not
before so, by uniting and conforming them to himself, by virtue of his
Sacrifice offered, without which they could never have been his seed: so, that
there was none in Christ to die, and rise, and offer Sacrifice in him, in such
a sense as Levi paid Tithes in Abraham, nor yet in respect of that sense
naturally and actually in specie, as we all sinned and fell in the Loins of our
first Father Adam; nor was Christ bound to offer this Sacrifice by any
pre-engagement upon the account of Mankind or any of them, as being in him, or
chosen in him, or allied to him; for his Engagement is free and voluntary: and
before his own voluntary Engagement to take the nature, cause and place of the
first public Man in hand, and therein to undertake for all Mankind, to suffer
and offer up the acceptable sacrifice, he was not engaged to him or any of
Mankind.

For then his Oblation and sacrifice he offered, had not been every way, in all
respects, only of himself, and altogether so free as it was, in respect of
Mankind, and his love to them; but by reason of such a pre-engagement, some
had had some influence upon him, and so power to have enjoined him to take
Man's Nature, and therein to lay down his life; yea, and by virtue of that
pre-engagement and election in him, and so by virtue of their interest in him,
to have challenged some right in the very sacrifice it self, so far as to have
it in some sense counted their offering it together with him: but that no such
thing could be, the dissimilitudes between the first Creation and the new, and
between the two public Men, do fully and clearly show, as is before shown in
Part 1. and Chap. 13. and in diverse expressions and plain sayings of Scripture,
Romans 5.15. But not as the offense, so also is the freegift; for if through the
offense of one many be dead; is not this the same with that before? verse. 12.
By one man sinentred into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon
all men, (in whom, or) for that all have sinned: Adam sinned not alone nor
simply as a public Man; so as his sin became no otherwise the sin of all
Mankind, but only by mere imputation, in an act of severity of vindicative
justice, he standing in the room of all Mankind; but Adam, as the public Man,
had also all Mankind that were naturally to come forth of him, in his Loins;
and so in that his sinning, all Men sinned in their species or kind, though
not as then in that act in their individual persons; and so all sinned, one as
well as another, all alike, without difference; and coming forth naturally from
him, are so in their persons, as naturally, truly and verily found and beheld,
as having sinned in him, as Levi was to have paid Tithes in Abraham; and not
only so, but the Nature and inclination of Mankind being polluted in and by
that very first sin, they come forth polluted, and so add more sin of their
own; Romans 5.18.
and so justly and deservedly, the condemnation of the first Man was both by
imputation, and also naturally the condemnation of all Mankind, or unto all
Men: and the wages of sin to Adam, and to all his posterity, is death, Romans
6.23.
and that by due and just desert, all being made sinners in their own persons,
in coming forth from him by propagation: Romans 5.19.
whence also the word all men, verse. 12. and 18. is, in a double consideration
turned into the word many, verse. 15. and 19. namely, to explicate the word all,
to show it to be a great number, that the evil of the first Man's offense may
the more appear in the heynousness of it, and also as having more special
relation to those that are already come forth in their personal beings
naturally from Adam, and so came forth under such guilt and defilement of sin
and liableness to death, which are all Men that have had their personal beings
naturally from him: and these also are a great number, even Many, Verse. 13, 14,
19.
though there be yet more to come forth from him.

Yet now though there be a similitude here in respect of the number of persons,
Verse. 18.
and the verity of imputation and efficacy, between the disobedience of the
first public Man, Verse. 14.
and the obedience and righteousness of the second public Man, yet there is
some dissimilitude, the first being but a figure of the second, and Christ the
Truth exceeding all that figures could show forth: and so, for Jesus Christ,
the second public Man, as he was a new gift of God, and given to be the
Savior of the world; so he also as freely came forth, and was made Man under
the Law, and as freely died and offered up himself a Sacrifice to God for
Mankind, (the whole kind without difference, and so for all Men) to make an
Atonement for their sins they are fallen into; and this he alone, he himself
did freely, not being engaged to them by virtue of any of them being in him, or
he any way so obliged to them, as it should deserve or engage him to take their
Nature, and offer Sacrifice for them; or, that by virtue of being any ways in
him, they should be so interested in his Death, Sacrifice, and Righteousness,
that it should in any sort be theirs; yea, or counted theirs, and they
interested in it, before, by virtue of the completing of it, in and by himself
alone, he be interested in them, and so by Grace bring them in to have interest
in him.

And I hope it will be granted by all that believe in Christ, and I am sure it
is in Scripture affirmed, That by virtue of his Oblation once offered, God has
released and given over all Men to him to be disposed by him, and has released
over to him the sentence of the first Judgment and Death, Joh. 5.22, 27. Romans
14.8, 9, 10, 12. Joh. 17.1, 2, 5. 1 John 5.11.
by and according to the Law, as Mankind at first fell under it; so, as God
will never so judge them by that Law, nor cause them to perish for ever in that
Death; but has given them over unto the dispose of Jesus Christ, and given him
to be their Lord and Judge, and has given him power over all flesh, and given
for Mankind eternal Life in Christ, in whom, in the Nature of Man it is put;
and he has exalted him, and filled him with Spirit to make it known and
dispense it in his way; and though it was free and undeserved Grace to give him
for Mankind, and freeness of Grace to unite the Body given him, in union of
person with the Son of God; yet all this given him by virtue of his death,
sufferings and sacrifice, may, in respect of himself, be said to be merited and
deserved, and so called the wages of that one Righteousness of his, in his
Oblation offered by himself: Isa. 53.11, 12. Phil. 2.10, 11.
whence it is said, Even, therefore I will divide him a portion, etc. and
therefore God has highly exalted him, etc. yea, as rightly thus called in
respect of himself only, as Death is called the wages of sin in respect of the
first Adam and his posterity: but now in respect of Mankind, for whom he
offered the Oblation, or any of them, it cannot be said so, that their
receiving mercies through this Oblation, or any of the benefit of it, that
either it, or the benefit of it, interest in it, or life through it, is merited
or deserved by them, or the wages of any righteous affections or works of
theirs, or any ways due to them, and descending upon them by virtue of any
fore-being in Christ preceding his Oblation; but only it comes to Men by the
freeness of the Grace of God, that freely gave Christ for them; and the
freeness of the same Grace in Christ, that freely gave himself for them; and
God's gracious acceptance of the gift and sacrifice of Christ for them, and so
imputing it to them, graciously accepting it for them; and them, for and
through it, as if they had died, and risen, and offered the sacrifice; and as
any in his discovery of this great Grace are found believing in Christ, freely
giving to them eternal Life through Christ and for his sake: Romans 6.23. and
5.15.
and so it is said, The gift of God is eternal Life, (he says not, unto
Christ, but) through Jesus Christ our Lord: and so Romans 5.15. Much more the
grace of God, (which comprehends his love in the gift of Christ, and the whole
preparation made in him for Men, before any gift through it, is extended) and
the gift by grace, (and explicating it, have) by one Man, Jesus Christ, has
abounded to many, (that is, in respect of release from perishing in the first
Judgment, and mercies extended) unto all men, Joh. 1.4.5.9. Romans 5.17.
verse. 18. and in respect of the abundance of Grace and eternal Life to all
those that in believing receive the same, verse. 17. so that all the whole
offering of the Oblation by Christ, and the benefit procured for Men thereby,
is by the free Grace of Christ, and freely done by him, and not by debt or
fore-engagement unto any: there was none in him, for him by virtue thereof to
be engaged to, or in such a sense joined with him to die, suffer and offer with
him; but he, he only, he himself, Heb. 7.17. and 9.14. and 10.12.
offered this Oblation and Sacrifice here treated of. Oh infinite, and
unspeakable free and gracious goodness! who would entertain any Doctrine that
should gainsay or darken this?

CHAP. 5.
3. To whom it was that he offered this Oblation or Sacrifice.

TO whom Jesus Christ gave himself, is, though not expressed plainly, yet
clearly and strongly intimated in Tit. 2.14. in that it is not in this place
said, to us, but for us; and to whom should it be offered for us, but to him
against whom we had sinned, even God that gave him forth to that end? whence
it is also called, the grace of God, etc. verse. 11. a like strong intimation we
have, 1 Timothy 2.4, 5, 6. That gave himself a Ransom for all Men, to God, that
would have all saved, and therefore found out the Ransom, by virtue whereof,
with God to whom he offered it, he mediateth for men. But this is seen clearly
in both the former Points, and also expressly affirmed, Ephesians. 5.2. Christ also
has loved us, and given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for
a sweet smelling savor. Christ, who through the eternal Spirit, offered
himself without spot to God, Heb. 9.14. And so it is said of Jesus, Joh. 13.1,
3. and 16.28.
That he knowing all things, knew, that he was come from God, and went to God;
and that he came forth from the Father into the world, and left the world, and
departed out of the world unto the Father; yea, all the former typical Priests
did offer their Sacrifices to God; though they were on Earth, Heb. 7.26, 27.
and 8.3, 4. and 9 9, 12, 14.
and offered on Earth, yet it was to God in the Heavens: and to whom should our
great High Priest offer up his Sacrifice, when he entered into Heaven, but to
God in the Heavens? But I suppose, this is not only clear and evident, Heb.
2.17. and 3.2, 6.
but also acknowleged by all that believe in Jesus Christ, both that he offered
his Oblation and Sacrifice to God, and also that he was faithful in all his
business: but that I note this for, is, that it may be minded, That Jesus
Christ in the business of his Oblation and Sacrifice-offering, he had to deal
with God, and with none but with God; and though for fallen Mankind, yet not
with them, but with God for them. True it is, in his after-Mediation, (of which
is after to be spoken) as he has to deal for Men, so also both with God and
with Men: but in his Oblation and Sacrifice-offering, though it was for Men,
yet he did not in that deal with Men, but with God for them: true, in the
fitting and preparing his Body, which he took to offer, he did deal with the
Nature (though not with the Persons) of Mankind, in that he took flesh of the
Seed of a Woman, that was of the Seed of David, of Abraham, of Adam, and had
thereof his Body framed, which he took into union of person with himself; so,
that the Man Christ is God Man, the Son of God. And this also is true, That
walking on the Earth in that Body, in his Ministration of the Gospel, and
mercies, and miracles extended, he dealt with Men to do them good; yea, as
there were several ends in his death, one to make propitiation for sins, one to
confirm the Testament of precious promises, and one to bear witness of the
Truth he had taught, and therein show his love and faithfulness, as a Minister
and true and faithful Shepherd, his love and faithfulness to his Hearers, which
were his sheep: and as in respect of the first End, not the Scribes and
Pharisees, but God laid on him the iniquity of us all, and delivered him to
death for our sins; and in respect of the second End, he willingly gave up the
Ghost and died, as for our sins, so to confirm the New Testament in his Blood:
so, in respect of the third End, the Priests, Scribes and Pharisees envying and
hating him for his Gospel preaching, did crucify him and put him to death;
which also he willingly under went, to witness the Truth as he had taught, as
has been more lat^ely shown in other Treatises Vin. of God's free grace, c 2.
Dise. about the precious blood of Christ, chapter 3. with uncovery of mystcrious
deceits, P. 31.
: and so in his dying, as it was for witness-bearing to the Truth he had
taught, it was a part of his Ministration, in which he had to deal with Men:
(...) his abasement under the Law, and so his suffering and death as it was for
propitiation-making, and so in offering his whole Oblation and Sacrifice, he
did not deal with Men, or offer to Men, but for Men he offered the Oblation and
Sacrifice to God only; which I insist on to this end, That we may look for and
judge of the efficacy and prevailing virtue and power of this Oblation,
Sacrifice, and Ransom given by Christ; first, in the offering it to God, and
therein in the prevalency it has with God, in Gods acceptance of it, and
giving into his hands all that for the receipt whereof he offered it, that the
Nature of Man be in him exalted, and received into union with God, and filled
with the Holy Ghost, and invested with the inheritance, and Lordship and power
to save and judge; and that all Mankind be released into his dispose, etc. in
which the prevalency of his offering to God is to be seen, and so the
effectualness of it, judged according to the prevalency it has with God, to
whom the Sacrifice was offered, and not first to be judged or looked on, as
effectual only, as it has its efficacy in Men, and prevails with them; no,
not to be seen that way at all, before some making of it known, in some
application of the virtues of it, to Men; after which application, it will in
due time be seen also in its efficaciousness in and upon them also, both in the
receivers in drawing them in to Christ, and in comforting, purifying and
quickening them, and giving them boldness of access to God, and hope of Glory,
and all upon the account of him that first engaged his Heart to approach to God
in their Nature for them.

And indeed there was not any other but he, either fit or able to have dealt
with God for Men: none of the fallen Race of Mankind, rich or poor, one or
other, could by any means redeem his Brother, or give to God? Ransom for him;
Psalm. 49.7, 8. and 40.6, 7, 8. with ^. v. 10. ^-20.
for the Redemption of their Souls is precious, etc. yea, all the Sacrifices
offered by former and typical Highpriests and Priests, could not do this with
God; this could none do, but he, that is both God and Man in one Person, and
through his approach to God, all that believe, receive the liberty of approach
to God, and partake of Life, etc. and not only is this his Oblation efficacious
in Receivers, (...) will he (...) so to be also in and upon Refusers and
R^j^^ers, (...) they shall come and bow before him, and (...) know (...) Lord
to the Glory of God, and to judged by him: which things have been more largely
shown in another Treatise Disc. of the precious blood of Christ, chapter 8, and 9,
and 10. and 11.
. But all the efficacies in and with Men, is after application to Men; before
which, its efficacy is with God: and that we may not judge of the efficacy of
Christ his offering, by what is seen in and upon Men only, nor limit its
efficacy to that scantling, Joh. 12.48. Phil. 8.10, 11.
but acknowledge it according to its prevalency with God to whom it was
offered, for all that for which it was offered, has all this been said, To God
he offered his Oblation.

CHAP. 6.
4. For whom, and in whose behalf Christ offered this Sacrifice.

FOr whom Jesus Christ gave himself, is also answered, Tit. 2.14. 1 Cor. 5.7. 1
These. 5.10. 1 John 3.16. 2 Cor. 5.21. Gal. 3.13. Ephesians. 5.2.
He gave himself for Us: and so in many places of Scripture it is so said,
Christ, our passover, is sacrificed for Us; who died for Us; he laid down his
life for Us; he was made sin for Us; being made a curse for Us; and has given
himself for Us, an offering, etc.

So that the right understanding of the Persons for whom Christ gave himself,
is found in the right understanding of the word Us, in what sense it is used in
this and suchlike sayings.

The worcester Us, (as Our and We) is used sometime in some sayings, as pointing out
some peculiar people, distinct and severed from other people; and then it is
made known to be so meant in the same sayings, by speaking to, or of, some,
with an expression or intimation of some others, to whom they are opposed; as
in these places on the Margent, and diverse others Dout. 5.3. and 9.16. 1 Cor.
4.9. 2 Cor. 3.3. 1 Pet. 4.17. 1 John 2.19. 2 cv. 5.9, 10.
; but here is neither expression nor intimation to lead us to such an
understanding of Us here.

The word Us is found in suchlike business as this, to be used applicatively
in Profession or Confession, grounded on a large and sure Foundation, and
including in its saying two manner of People, or sorts of Men: the one sort
such, whom it concerns, and yet they understand it not, and so neither
believe it nor confess it: the other sort such as do understand, believe and
confess the Truth and Goodness of that asserted, that others also might
believe; and this (in Redemption) applied to fallen Mankind, has also in it
an opposition in respect of sinfulness to righteousness: and so he did not
offer the Oblation for himself or for the Holy Angels, but for us sinners and
unjust; and sometime in respect of the nature, species or kind, in which fallen
Men are opposed to fallen Angels, whose nature and cause he took not on him,
but the nature and cause of Man; and so gave himself for us Men, and not for
the Angels: sometime the word is used with a special reference to Mankind above
other Creatures; so, as the life in him, is the light of Men. And in confession
of Truth, the word Us, We and Our, is frequently used in Scripture as
comprehending all Men, yet testifying the Faith of the Confessors, so Psalm.
100.3. It is he that has made us, and not we our selves. Psalm. 100.3. v. 1, 3.
Psalm. 33.8, 9. Roin. 15.10, 11
This true of all Men of all the Lands and Nations in all the ends of the
Earth; and that a good Ground to move them all to come in to believe in him,
rejoice in him, fear and serve him, that so they might become the sheep of his
pasture; yet the special benefic, and the Testimony of Faith, is enjoyed and
breathed forth by the believing Confessors: the like Mal. 2.10. Has not one
God created us? This true of all Men, and the Confession grounded on that very
Truth, That he is the Creator of all the ends of the Earth, Isa. 48.28, Act.
17.26.
and has made all Nations of Men of one Blood; yet the force of the reproof
and exhortation is found only in the believing Confessors of the same: so 2
Pet. 3.9. The Lord is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any should
perish, etc. where it is evident, verse. 3. with Rev. 2.21. that Us includes as
yet the very scoffers, and such as yet were not come to the knowledge of the
Truth, express verse. 9. and grounded on that Truth Psalm. 1 45.8, 9.
and that the word Us is used in the same sense, and signifies all Men, in
Tit. 2.14. He gave himself for us, us men; and Believers confess it, is evident
and manifested diverse ways by the Scriptures; namely,

1. In the place it self, in the beginning of the Profession or Confession,
Tit. 2.11, 12, 13, 14.
verse. 11. The Grace of God saving to all Men, or bringing salvation to all
Men, has appeared, etc. and giving the Ground both of its appearing and
teachings; He renders it thus, Who gave himself for us: and having made no
difference, what can Us be less than all Men, though the believing Confessors
are they that receive and enjoy the benefit of its teachings? And this will yet
farther appear,

2. By comparing with it other places of Scripture speaking of like things to
the same end, Act. 17.26, 27.
Act. 7.26, 31. where having affirmed, That God made all Nations of Men of one
Blood, etc. and also shown his gracious end toward them all in their several
Generations and Habitations, that they should seek the Lord, etc. in removing
the Objection of impossibility, and affording encouragement, he says, Though
he be not far from every one of us: where it is evident, That Us is us Men; yea,
in such a sense as is true from the beginning; us Men, every one in their
Generations; Us, every one now living in our Generations; Us, every of us
following in all the Generations of Men on Earth: where also we may note, That
this Apostle, like the residue of the Apostles, (as did the Prophets of old)
when speaking of the love and goodness of God to Mankind, Gen 2.7, 23. and
1.27. Eccles. 7.29.
either in the first Creation, wherein Man was made in innocence, and said to
be flesh and bone; he speaks of it, as that which pertained to all Mankind in
the first Man, 2 Cor. 15.50.
before the fall; and what he speaks of the love and goodness of God extended
through a Redeemer and Mediator to Mankind fallen (that by the fall became
flesh and blood, Heb. 2.14.
weak and mortal (which weakness and mortality the second public Man for a
time partook of, that through Death he might destroy him that had the power of
Death) and so what goodness God extends to this fallen Mankind, in making them
of, and from the first fallen man (whose Nature and weakness the second man
took) making them of the same Blood, Psalm. 75.3. Col. 1.17. Psa. 33.6, 7, 8.
Romans 2.4.
of the same Nature and kind, and preserving and extending mercies to them,
(as it is through the second man, that is, the Redeemer; so) it is all to one
and the same gracious end, in the first place, that they might seek, and find
him, and fear him: so the Apostle speaks of this as appertaining to all men:
and so in relation to men, both Unbelievers and Believers, he says, Every one
of us: Act. 17.27, 28.
and then proceeds in giving some evident and undeniable demonstrations
thereof; saying, For in him (or by, or through him) We live, and move, Joh.
1.2, 3, 4.
or have our being, as verse. 25. yea, takes advantage from the power and
victory of this Truth, causing one of their own Poets in his way to confess it,
saying, For we also are his offspring; Joh. 1.4, 5, 9. Act. 14.17.
and however this Light has formerly shined in Darkness, and the Darkness
comprehended it not, yet God being patient, and forbearing till he brought
forth the Light more clearly; yet bringing forth the Light more clearly, Act.
17.30, 31.
he does now admon^ish Men, all men, all Men every where, to repentiso that
that former, Every one of us, and We, he shows it to mean, all Men, and all Men
every where; and then gives this as the ground of the verity and equity of that
admonition, and a motive to receive it, Because he has appointed a day, in the
which he will judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom he has
appointed, Romans 14.9, 10, 11, 12.
(or ordained, namely, by virtue of his Death and Sacrifice for them, to that
rule, dispose and judgment of them) whereof he has given assurance to all
men, (or offered Faith, in giving a sure object for Faith, and medium to bring
to Faith, a witness of the Truth to move to, and facilitate Faith to all Men)
in that he has raised him from the dead. So that all the way here about these
things, the words Us, and We, and all men are of like extent, and in the
largest sense that can be appliable to Men in their several Generations from
the beginning of the World to the end thereof: and if I should add to this,
those places in which he says, That Christ died for all, tasted death for
every Man, and gave himself a ransom for all, and is the propitiation for the
sins of the whole world; and compare them with other places, where speaking of
the same things, he says, He died for us; gave himself for us; died for our
sins: it would easily appear, That where there is no distinguishing word in the
sentence, to limit, That All, Every, the World; and, Us, Our, We, are of like
extent, and indifferently used the one for the other: but occasion to use these
places follows; only I shall note here some gracious essicacy, appearing in
this manner of using the words Us, Our and We, by the Apostles and unfeigned
Believers.

1. Luke 18.11, Isa. 65.5. Tit. 3.3. Romans 7.14, 24. Act. 14.15. 1 Timothy 1.13,
14, 15.
It shows and keeps them humble and low in their own eyes; so, as they are far
from the pride of those that say, I am not as other Men, stand aloof from me, I
am holier than thou: but knowing they were as ill as any, and have the corrupt
disposition still in them troubling them, they judge of themselves still as
Men, Men subject to like passions with others; yea, as the chief of sinners, in
respect of themselves. And so in relation to Men, speaking of God's love to
Mankind, can readily, without making division, say, Us, We, Our, including
themselves with all Men.

2. They have found, and do find such satisfying peace, refreshing, Romans 5.6,
8. Phil. 3.3, 7, 8, 9, 10. 2 Cor. 5.14.
and well-pleasedness in Christ, as the Savior of the World, and propitiation
for the sins of the whole World, as he died for the ungodly, and gave himself a
ransom for all; that they prize not, nor take up their rest or glorying in any
of their own excellencies, in which they appear better than others; but have
their whole rejoicing and well-pleasedness in Christ; yea, even glad that the
same is in him for others to receive, which themselves have received: and so
speaking of him as the Savior of the World (and so of his Death, Resurrection,
Ransom, etc.) to others, they can say without separation making, in that
respect, from such as do not yet believe, for us, for our, etc.

3. Act. 14.15. Romans 2.14, 15, 16. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15, 18, 19, 20.
Yea, this Grace received, engages them as debtors to others, yea, to all Men,
they having and being Stewards of that Word and Grace, which appertains to them
that yet believe not, to be declared to them that they might believe; and this
Grace enflameth them with love and desires, that they might know and believe,
and so receive the same: and therefore are ready to declare; and in declaration
of the Gospel to them, to couple together with themselves, in setting forth
what Christ has done for all Men; and so to say, Us, Our, We: so graciously,
and in such heavenly manner have the Apostles in confession of the Truth of
that which is true for all Men, used the word Us, Our, We: so Paul in his first
preaching to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 12.2.
who at that time when he first preached to them, were carried about unto dumb
idols, according as they were led; 1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11.
sacrificed to, and had fellowship with Devils; and so were Idolaters, many of
them Fornicators, Adulterers, Effeminate, Abusers of themselves with Mankind,
Thieves, Covetous, Drunkards, Revilers, Extortioners; 2 Cor. 5. and 20, 21.
yet to these, in preaching Christ the propitiation for the sins of the World,
he coupled himself together with them, in showing for whom Christ has done
this, saying, 1 Cor. 15.3.
I delivered unto you first of all, that which I also received, 2 Cor. 5.21.
how that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scripture; he was made sin
for us: according to that, he was delivered for our offenses, Romans 4.25.
and raised for our justification: still declaring the choice benefit received
and enjoyed by those that in believing did receive him: 1 Cor. 6.11. 2 Cor.
5.18.
but asserting the Truth thereof in Christ for others, that they might believe:
in which sense, Us comprehends all Men; and so appears to mean all men, Tit.
2.11, 14. and yet farther appears,

3. By minding and considering some particulars, requisite to, and included in
the Oblation and Sacrifice of Christ, that it might be fit for us, and all
minded to us, in saying, He gave himself for us, Tit. 2.14. as his being made
flesh, Heb. 2.11, 14. Luke 3.38. Act. 17.26.
and so having a Body, without which he could not have been a fit Sacrifice for
us: and in this he took the Nature of Mankind, of Abraham, of Adam, of all
Men: in this no difference. If any would put a difference in his coming of the
Jews, Romans 17.5. and 15.8.
and to them; it is answered, That was to confirm the promises made to the
Gentiles. And look to the beginning, and we shall find, he came not only of
Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, Mat. 1.1.
the Fathers of all and every of the Jews; but of Noah, Lamech, Methusalah,
Enoch, Jared, Malaleel, Cainan, Enos, Seth, Luke 3.36, 37, 38.
the Fathers of all and every both Jew and Gentile, and of Adam the Father of
all Men: and so has the Nature of Man, which is common to every Man alike,
created in the first Adam alike: also being in the Nature of Mankind, he was
made under the Law, under which Mankind was fallen, Gal. 4.4. Romans 3.10,
11.19, 20. and 11.32. Gal. 3.22. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15, 10. Romans 14.9-12.
(that so the sins that Law so charged with, might be charged on him) to redeem
them that were under the Law, and that is expressly all the World, and every
mouth, all men: and being under the Law, he died for our sins, and that is
expressly said to be for all men; yea, even all those that must appear before
his Judgement-feat: yea, he was set in his public place, and glorified in
Man's Nature to be a public Man, to do that wonderful business; yet, to effect
it, made a little lower than the Angels (in being Man mortal) all to this end,
That by the Grace of God he might taste death for every: Heb. 2.6, 7, 14.
which can be no less nor other, than every of that Nature; in taking which, he
was for a while made lower than the Angels, and that is every Man: and being
risen for our justification, he offered up himself a Sacrifice to God, and so
gave himself a complete Ransom to God. And this is express to be for all Men,
where it is assirmed, God our Savior will have all Men to be saved, etc. (and
this given as the ground and proof of his will) For there is one God, 1 Timothy
2.4, 5, 6, 7.
and one Mediator between God and Men (indefinitely and universally Men; yea,
here is God and Men, and no Man excepted but one, who is Emmanuel, and the
Mediator between God and Men, even) the Man Jesus Christ, who gave himself a
ransom for all, (this is that by virtue where of he mediateth, and so was first
given for those for whom he mediateth, Heb. 9.15.
his mediation being by the virtue of his suffering and Sacrifice, or Ransom
offered; and so mediating between God and Men, evidenceth him to have given
himself a Ransom for Men: but how many?) even all Men. And of this the Apostle
was ordained a Preacher, and professes in this also to speak the Truth in
Christ, and not to lie; and in teaching this, to teach in Truth and Verity. And
what can be said more, or more plainly, or with greater earnestness and
asseveration, to show, That Christ died and gave himself a Ransom for all Men?

And yet, to remove all stumbles and doubts, and make it most clear, That he
gave himself for all Men, we have one word more.

4. To consider the Qualisication and Character given us of those Men for whom
Christ died, and gave himself a Ransom to God: and this is express, That they
were, and were so viewed, even ungodly, unjust, sinners, and enemies to God:
and this is intimated here, in Tit. 2.14. He gave himself for us. it is not
said, for our desires, or requests, or deserts; no, we were fallen sinners,
without strength, enemies, in captivity to sin, death, Satan; which is
intimated in the next words, That he might redeem us, etc. but in other places
it is fully and plainly expressed, yea, assirmed, 1 Timothy 1.15.
This is a faithful saying, That Jesus Christ came into the world to save
sinners; and, in due time Christ died for the ungodly; again, Romans 5.6. 1 Pet.
3.18.
Christ also has suffered for sins, the just for the unjust: yea, the
Believers have not been ashamed to own themselves in this number also: of whom,
says Paul, I am the chief: Romans 5.8.
And while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. And, all have sinned, Romans
3.
and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by his grace,
through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God has (foreordained,
or) set forth, to be a propitiation, 1 John 2.2.
(even for the sins of the whole World) through says in his blood, (and that
in his setting him forth) to declare his righteousness for the remission (or
passing over) of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God: yea, to
declare at this time (now Christ is so manifested) his righteousness, that he
might be just, (yea, Psa. 145.8, 9, 17. and 36.5. 9. Romans 3.3, 4, 6. Act.
13.39. Romans 4.5.
so known to be in all his merciful Dispensations to men from the beginning of
the World, and to the end of it, and in his judgings of Men) and the justifier
of him that believes in Jesus. And all this given as the Ground, Demonstration
and Proof of the Truth of that fore-assirmed, namely, That the righteousness of
God, without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the
Prophets, Romans 3.21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.
even the righteousness of God, which is (now manifested, and) by says of
Jesus Christ (the clear Doctrine of the Gospel; in which, he, as the Object of
Faith, is set forth to be received in believing) unto all, (that is, as true
for them, and tendered to them) and upon all that believe: for there is no
difference. Till Men believe and receive it, or obstinately reject it, it is
alike for all, and to be preached and tendered unto all; and to this end, that
they might receive it in believing: here no diffence: and in believing it is
upon Believers, they all and every one receive it and have it, and even so in
believing they have it: there is no difference in this neither, for all have
sinned, etc. which brings fully to that understanding of the word Us, Tit.
2.14. to signify, us men, us sinners, and so all Men: and so those for whom
Christ gave himself an Oblation, and Sacrifice, and Ransom to God, are
mankind, all mankind, Adam and all his Race, even all men: and when the
Oblation of Christ, as offered to God for men, is only spoke of, whether it be
in terms of Death or Ransom, they for whom he died and gave himself, are set
forth in those general terms, Men, all Men, Sinners, Unjust, Ungodly, etc. such
phrases, in so speaking of his Death and Ransom, as to say, He died for his
Elect, or for Believers, or for his Church, or such as were appointed to
believe on him, are not in the Scripture, nor Scripture-like; but the devices
of men, thinking to be wise; and so in an unbelievingness, conceive harshness,
absurdities, errors, and danger in the terms of the Holy Ghost; and presuming
to be wiser than their Maker, and to direct the Holy Spirit what terms to
breath in, find him out those foresaid terms, as more true and safe terms to
deliver his mind in: but it is plain, and enough said in a former Treatise,
Universality of God's freegrace to Mankind.
yet unshaken by all the attempts against it; which also are answered by a
learned and godly Brother, beside the Answer fore-given; in all which it
appears, That Christ is set forth in the Scripture to have died for all, and
given himself a Ransom for all men.

CHAP. 7.
5. For what Christ offered this Sacrifice for us Men.

THis is in general intimated, Tit. 2.11, 12, 14. but express in other places,
That it was for our sins: not to purchase any Liberty for sinning, Gal. 5.13.
Psalm. 45.7.
nor for love of our sins, for he loves righteousness, and hates sin and
wickedness; but, because he loved us, and saw us necessitated to suffer for our
sins, and so in a perishing condition, and remediless distress by reason of our
sins, therefore he came, and gave himself in our stead, to suffer for our sins,
the curse that was due to us, and so to make an Atonement and escape for us:
which is here clearly intimated, in saying, He gave himself for us (or, in our
stead, to work redemption for us, and purchase for us) and that also to this
gracious end, That he might redeem us from all iniquity; which is a farther
business, to be spoken in the next Point and Chapter: but of the former, that
done and obtained by him for that end: and so far, for what he gave himself;
which is not only intimated here, Gal. 1.4. 1 Cor. 15.3. 1 Pet. 3.18. 1 John
3.5. Heb. 10.12. Romans 3.23. and 6.23. Gal. 3.10. Heb. 9.22, 23. Psalm. 40.6, 7,
8 and 49.7, 8. Mie. 6, 7.
but in other places fully and plainly expressed, as, that He gave himself for
our sins, He died for our sins, etc. Has suffered for our sins, He was
manifested to take away our sins, And after he had made one Sacrifice for sins
for ever, he sat down on the right Hand of God: for so it is, We have all
sinned, and come short of the Glory of God; and in this no difference: And the
wages of sin is death, and so we all fall short of those righteous affections
and services, which the Law of Ten Words require, and so deserve to suffer the
Curse: and so without shedding of blood, and suffering Death and Curse, there
could be no remission of any of our sins; and that must be better blood than
that of Bullocks and Goats, or our own personal Blood; and yet it must be the
blood of a man, yet a just and perfect man, and one that is more than a man,
even God-Man; therefore God was pleased to send forth his own Son in man's
Nature, and to lay on him the iniquity of us all: And he was delivered for our
effences, Isa. 53.5, 6. Romans 4.25. 1 Pet. 2.24. Heb. 2.14. and 1.3. and 9.12,
14. and 10.12, 14. Ephesians. 2.13.
and so he his own self bare our sins in his own Body on the Tree, and by Death
overcame Death; and so in and by himself made purgation of, or for our sins;
and by the Eternal Spirit offered up himself for us a spotless Sacrifice to
God, and obtained Eternal Redemption, and sat down on the right Hand of God:
and thus has he given himself for our sins, and made the Atonement for us. Now
in this general Answer, there are five particulars included, as that for which
he gave himself a Sacrifice to God, and which by that Offering he has obtained
of God for that work that is fully done.

1. To satisfy for, and take out of the way those sins into which mankind was
fallen, and which, through the corruption of his Nature, he was necessitated to
commit, against the Law under which he was fallen; and so to redeem mankind
from the Curse of the Law; and also to overcome that death into which mankind
was fallen, and the Devil that had the power of it: or which is brought forth
to terrify men with it, man being weakened thereby, and it being due to be
executed on mankind, that so mankind might not perish in it, but be raised
out of it; and these are the sins which were seen to be in Adam and all his
natural Race, as so coming forth from him, and bearing his Image, and this the
Death in which mankind should have perished; and so was mankind beheld before
Christ his undertaking for him: and these sins and this death, Christ undertook
(not to be an exempter of men wholly from feeling any part of either, Isa.
53.4, 5, 6, 7. 1 Pet. 2.24. Psalm. 40.6, 7, 12.
but) to be a Redeemer of men from both these: and so these sins in a special
manner were laid upon him; and in respect of the penalty to be suffered and
satisfaction to be made, they were counted his sins, and he bare them in a
special manner, and confessed them as his own sins, 2 Cor. 5.21. Gal. 3.13.
and did, as under the same bond with us, suffer the full punishment due to us
for them; in which respect he is said to have been made sin for us, and to have
been made a Curse for us: and so virtuous his Blood and Sacrifice, Isa. 53.5.
Gal. 3.13.
and so effectual with the Father, that by this one Oblation, as offered to
God, this our great wound is healed, Heb. 1.3. and 10, 12. Col. 2.14, 15. 2 Timothy 1.10.
and he has redeemed us from the Curse of the Law: and so in and by himself,
as in and by the public man, our sins are purged, the Law satisfied, all that
was in the way contrary to us, is taken out of the way, and that for ever, and
death overcome: so, that though men be conceived and born in sin, and come
forth with Natures polluted, yet there is redemption wrought; and though
through ignorance and unbelief, the consciences of men may charge them for
these sins by this Law, and so they may be terrified for these sins by this
Law, and with the fears of the Curse in this Death, while they live this
natural Life, and know not Christ, yet God will not so go to Law with them, to
judge them by this Law, by which Christ was judged for them; nor shall they
perish in this first Death, which Christ has suffered for them; but be raised
out of it. Romans 3.24, 25. and 5.12, 18.
And this such as do know, and believe in Jesus according to the revelation of
the Gospel, do know and consess, as is clear in that Testimony.

2. To make such an abundant and overflowing propitiation, by the dignity,
excellency and virtue of his Blood and Sacrifice, that he by virtue thereof
might have power and authority to take away from, and extend forgiveness to men
for those following sins, which through their weakness, and Satan's new
attempts, they may be found to commit against that new and gracious Obligation,
under which they now are to him, and to God for the gift of him; and so against
that Light, and those means and spiritual motions extended to them, while he
continues his patience toward them, and is by Spirit so striving with them.
These being the sins, Joh. 1.4, 5, 9, 10, 29. Heb. 2.17. and 7.27.
that will fasten on conscience indeed, and bring reproofs, and condemnation,
and correction from God, of which daily pardon and justification is needful to
be sought and received through the sprinkling of his Blood: and these are
called, The sins of the people; and, The sins of the world. But, because some
not well catechized in the word of the beginning of Christ, may count this
strange; I will therefore also show where I find it in Scripture plainly:
first then, I find it in the Types; in which, though much dissimilitude, yet
ever so much fitness of similitude, that we may know the Truth, though but
darkly typed, to be yet verily fulfilled, and clearly appearing in Jesus
Christ: and so to instruct us into the knowledge of Christ, the Apostle
produces those types, as Heb. 4, and 5. For every High-Priestaken from among
men, Heb. 4.15. and 5.1, 2, 3, 4.
is ordained for men, in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts
and sacrifices for sin. Who can have compassion on them that are out of the
way, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity: Verse. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10.
and by reason hereof, he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to
offer for sins: And no man takes this honor to himself, but he that is called
of God, as Aaron was: so also Christ, etc. as follows, Heb. 9.7, 8, 12, 13, 14.
And so into the second Tabernacle went the High Priest alone, once every year,
not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the
people; the holy Ghost thus signifying, etc. But most plainly, Heb. 7.27.
speaking of Christ, says, Who needed not daily, as those Highpriests, to
offer up sacrifice, first for his own sin, and then for the peoples: for this
did he once, when he offered up himself. Mind the words, That which they daily
or often did, this (not a part only, but this) he did once, and at one time,
namely, when he offered up himself: and consider what this teaches us. The
dissimilitudes are so evident between the typical Highpriests, and our
High Priest, that I need but only mention them: those of the Tribe of Levi,
ours of the Tribe of Judah: those after the Law of a carnal Commandment, ours
after the power of endless Life: those after the Order of Aaran, and without an
Oath; ours after the Order of Melchizedec, and with an Oath: those had in
themselves inherency of sin, and personal sins, needing a Sacrifice for
themselves; ours holy, sinless, had no sin either personal or inherent, needing
any Sacrifice for himself: those, by reason of death, had Successors; ours
lives and remains a High Priest for ever: their Priesthood and Law was
changeable; our Priest and his Law abides for ever: their Sacrifices and
Purifications did but sanctify and purify the flesh, and made nothing
perfect, no, not the comers thereto, though, and therefore often iterated; but
the Sacrifice offered, and Purification made at once by our High Priest, was
perfect, and makes all comers to it perfect, purifying the Hearts and
Conscience of them. These, and suchlike diffimilitudes are set forth to us in
this Epistle to the Hebrews, and other places; by all which, Christ is shown to
excel all that figured and typed him: and so, in the fulfilling of Truth in
every similitude, in which the types did figure him, he not only answers, but
excels in the fullness of Truth: and so in these of the Priests, he was truly
Man, yea, an innocent and perfect Man; and though in a supernatural way, yet of
the Race of Mankind: and he was immediately called to this Office by God, and
he has had experience of humane weaknesses, sorrows and temptations; and he
laid aside his Glory he had with the Father before the World was, till in the
Garments of meanness and innocence, he had made the Atonement, and then was
clothed with his former Glory again; he once in the end of the World has made
the Atonement with his own Blood; and by virtue of his own Blood, has entered
into the Heavens, and obtained Eternal Redemption. These, and suchlike
answering of similitudes, so, as to have the Truth fulfilled in Christ, are
generally known and confessed among Believers; therefore I forbear to enlarge,
either for explication or farther proof about them.

But for this, That this holy, harmless, undefiled and sinless one should have
sins, that in any true sense should be called his own; and also, that there
should be sins of another sort, called the sins and errors of the people, that
he in one offering up himself in Sacrifice should offer for both, I fear this
is not so generally known and confessed among Believers; and yet the Apostle
intimates it strongly, Heb. 2.17. with 5.1, 2, 3. and 9.7, 8, 9. as is
forementioned, in that he affirms such fitness for such causes to be in
Priests; and also, that their oft-offering, was a signification that the way
into the holiest was not yet made manifest while the first Tabernacle stood,
yea, and also that the things done by the High Priest in offering for himself,
and the errors of the people, etc. were figures for the time present, and
patterns of the things in the Heavens; Heb. 9.9, 23. and 8.3, 4, 5. with 5.1,
2, 3. Heb. 7.26, 27.
and so these offerings also did serve to the example and shadow of heavenly
things, and not only intimates, but also plainly affirms, this to be found in
Christ's offering, Heb. 27. having before mentioned the Priests daily offering
up Sacrifices first for his own sins, and then for the peoples, he expressly
says, This he did once; and proves, that he needed not to do it daily or
again, being he is such a holy one, etc. and because he did this once, when he
offered up himself; so that he did give himself a Sacrifice both for some sins
called his own, and also to take away sins of another sort, called the sins or
errors of the people: and yet

Secondly, This will more clearly appear, if we mind what sins were counted
and called his, and in what sense they were so, and so called; and then, what
sins are after the Oblation offered, or considered as offered, called the
peoples sins, for him by virtue of his Oblation to be taken away: both may in
Scripture be found,

1. If we consider, How by the offense of the first Man, sin entered into the
World, and Death by sin, and how thereby sin ran over all Mankind, and so all
Mankind fell under the sentence and power of the Law, Romans 5.12, 18, 19.
and so under the guilt and power of death; and so, as they came forth
naturally from Adam, they come forth sinners under the Law, liable to sin
against it, and be condemned by it: but now other fins than this first, and
those which flowed necessarily from the original corruption of Nature hereby,
and so against the Law as Man was fallen under it, and other death than the
first Death and Curse, which this Law, as Man was fallen under it, did sentence
to, were none through the fall of the first public Man fallen under: and these
were the sins, and all the sins of Mankind in view, before the
pre-consideration of the Death and Sacrifice of Christ.

Now Jesus Christ interposing and undertaking for Mankind, Gal. 4.4.
did take the nature of Mankind fallen in its weakness, and became for Man, 1
Pet. 2.24. Psa. 40.12.
under the Law and Obligation under which Man was fallen; and this by the
agreement between the Father and him, Isa. 53.4, 5. 2 Cor. 5.21. Gal. 3.13.
and so the whole debt was charged on him, so, as he in his own body bare our
sins to the Tree; and by reason of this charge and imputation, being so legal
by the Law, he confessed and called them his sins, and was for them judged and
condemned, and made a curse, by dying and suffering the curse for us; which he
accepted, and having died and overcome death, risen just, and offered himself
an acceptable Sacrifice to God for us, he has, in that one Oblation, redeemed
us from (it is not yet said, all danger of any, or all manner of Curse, but)
the Curse of the Law, and made the Atonement and Reconciliation; Isa. 53.
that in this sense it is sure, with his stripes we are so healed, that these
sins so imputed to Christ, and by him so suffered for, are purged away, and can
no more be charged on him, nor shall they be any more again translated on
Mankind, to be so imputed to them, as for them or any of them, to be judged or
condemned for them, by and according to this Obligation and Law under which
Christ was made, and by which he was judged for them. And thus in a full, and
proper, and direct sense, it is said, Heb. 1.3.
When he had by himself purged our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the
Majesty on high; Ephesians. 2.15, 16, 17.
having abolished in his flesh, the enmity, the law of commandments in
ordinances, for to make in himself of twain, one new man: so making peace
through the bload of his cross, and that he might reconcile both unto God in
one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby, or in himself; and came
and preached peace: Col. 1.20.
so the Father's will is, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by
him to reconcile, etc. Again, Col. 2.14.
it is said of him, Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances, that was against
us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his
cross. And so there is no more sins to be imputed to Christ, or counted upon
his score; he has done all of them away, by one Sacrifice, and made the peace,
and caused it to be preached, that Men might believe it, 2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 20,
21. Romans 5.11.
and in believing be reconciled in their hearts to God, and so peace effected
in them.

2. If we also consider of a Reconciliation, and so of a purging away of sins,
that by virtue of this, Heb. 2.17. Ephesians. 5.26, 27. Heb. 9.14.
completed in and by himself with God, he, as the High Priest, after and by
virtue of the Sacrifice offered, Atonement and Purgation once made in the holy
of holies, is still continually making for the people: Then we shall also
find, that there are sins of another Nature, and against another Obligation
then that Men fell under in and through the first Adam, even such as the Law
under which Mankind was fallen, did not charge upon Christ directly: and they
in the committing are every Man's own sins that does them, as sins against
Mercy and Grace, extended through a Mediator, who by virtue of the Peace he by
his Blood and Sacrifice has made, Joh. 1.4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Prove. 1.23,
24-36. Jer. 6.16, 17. Romans 2.4. Jer. 13.27. Joh. 13.10, 11. Joh. 1.10, 11, 29.
Heb. 2.17. and 7.27. and 9.7.
extends light and means toward them, as not minding the light that shines
forth from the Life that is in him, not owning him in all the preservation he
gives, nor believing or receiving him by all the choice means he uses: and so
not turning at his reproofs, nor harkening to his Call and Voice; but hardening
their hearts against the same, and so refusing to be made clean, walk on
according the lusts and ways of their own hearts: and all these, and all of
this Nature, are called, The sins of the world; and, The sins of the people;
and, The errors of the people. And Jesus Christ did on the foresight of what
through Man's weakness and Satan's malice, would be found in Men, make
provision for Propitiation, Reconciliation, and Pardon in respect of those sins
also, in that one Oblation and Sacrifice of his, his Blood and Sufferings,
being the Blood and Sufferings not only of an innocent and just Man, but of
that Man that was the Son of God: Act. 20.28. Joh. 3.16. Heb. 9.14.
in which sense, his Blood is called, The blood of God; and, His laying down
his life. And so Jesus Christ offering himself by the Eternal Spirit a
Sacrifice to God, the Divine Nature did so sanctify and dignifie this
Sacrifice, that it is of infinite value and virtue, for taking away all sins:
and so, though in his interposing he did not take those sins upon him, as his,
which before his undertaking, were neither in being, nor in a possibility of
being, so to satisfy for and discharge, as that they should never be imputed
to those for whom he suffered, nor they condemned for them, as he did for the
former sorts of sins; yet he did so far bear them, and offered himself in
Sacrifice to God for them, as he might have full power to forgive them, and so
such fullness of virtue in his Blood, and Oblation and Propitiation made
thereby, as to propitiate and speak Peace in its sprinkling, being made known
to Men in the evidences of the Fruits thereof: 1 Timothy 2.5. Heb. 7.24, 25. and
8.1. and 9.15.
and for this business, he remains a continual Mediator between God and Men,
and an High Priest, ever living to intercede for all that come to God by him:
and in this work, we have to consider, that it is done ministerially and
spiritually to Men; in the former, for taking away the former sins, and making
Peace, as he he had to deal with God for Men, so he did it by his material
Blood shedding, and his material Body raised and offered in Sacrifice to God:
But now, as he is a spiritual Man, in dealing with Men, he does this business
spiritually, in Ministration of the Gospel, making known the virtue of his
Blood and Sacrifice, and by his Spirit so sprinkling it on the Hearts of Men,
to wash and reconcile them to God thereby, and so in a daily taking away these
following sins, and renewing, etc. and this was also figured in the continual
bearing of the sins of the people by the typical Highpriests and Priest,
^^covery of myst^^ous deceits, p. 6, 7, 28. Heb. 9. Discourse of the pr^c^ous
blood of Christ, c. 4. p. 21, 22, 23. 2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 20, 21. Mar. 2.10. Luke
5.24. Act. 5.31, 32, 1 Timothy 2.4, 5, 6.
as has been shown at large in another Treatise, and by their Purifications by
sprinkling, as has been shown at large in another Treatise. And this has
Jesus Christ by his Oblation also procured to do: himself in Person one while
did minister the Word of Reconciliation; but now he has left that to his
Servants; and the extention of Spirit therein is his own work still: and
suitable to all this, he said, The Son of man has power on earth to forgive
sins. And so the Apostles in their Te^imony, and the Holy Ghost in the same,
witness, That God has exalted him to give repentance and remission of sins,
etc. In which respect, by virtue of his Oblation once offered, he so ministering
is called, The Mediator between God and Man, for such an end; and, The Lamb of
God, Joh. 1.10, 11, 19.
(not only that has taken away the sins of Mankind, as fallen in A, dam, but)
that takes (that is, in this present time, in a continual act still doing)
away the sin (or sins) of the world, even Men in worldly fellowship, etc. and
even Believers also are said to come to the Blood of sprinking, Heb. 12.24.
that (not only has spoken, but) speaks, etc. and he that believes in
Christ according to Gospel-Testimony, knows both, Heb. 10.2.
That all sins in view and consideration, preceding Christ his undertaking, are
so taken away by his Oblation to God, that he has no more charge in Conscience
for them: and also that there is such virtue in that Blood and Sacrifice of
his, that being believed and received, as he makes it known, it will take away
in such sprinkling, all following sins, and purge the Conscience from dead
works to serve the living God: whence he is said to be set forth a Fountain,
Heb. 9.14. Zach. 13.1. Heb. 10.18, 19, 21, 22, 23. 1 John 1.7, 9. Ephesians. 5.25,
26, 27.
even for Believers to wash at, and they directed to daily washing in
approaching to God by him: and he is said to have given himself for them, to do
this business of washing them with Word and Water, till he have made them
spotless; and in this respect also, of the provision made in his Sufferings and
Sacrifice for taking away these following evils of those redeemed from the
Curse of the Law, and bought by him, it is said, Isa. 53.6, 5, 11, 12.
All we (even we that are healed with his stripes) like sheep have gone astray,
we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord has made the iniquity of
us all to meet on him, etc. and so he is a perfect Savior, and a Giver of
Salvation to such as believe on him, as is demonstrated and affirmed, Heb. 2.10.
where the Apostle having spoken of his being made perfect through sufferings,
after mentions his Burden and Sufferings in the flesh, his tears, prayers,
supports and obedience in all; and then says, (as in another place) And being
made perfect, Phil. 2.7, 11. Heb. 5.7, 8, 9.
he became the Author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. Now
it is known, he was made perfect as a Savior in his Oblation-offering, and the
Father's acceptance of it, and exalting and filling him, and then he became the
Author of eternal Salvation; which also clearly implies some true Salvation,
which proves not to all the saved Eternal, and yet none without Blood: but this
eternal Salvation he gives unto all them that obey him, that is, believe on
him; he says not, to all he died for, nor to all whom by virtue of his Death
and Ransom, he has redeemed from the Curse of the Law, and so bought into his
dispose, that they shall not perish for ever in the first Death; nor to all
that he uses means, and sends forth Spirit to, and so calls them that they
might believe and have eternal Life, and so not be hurt of the second Death:
but to all them that obey him, that is, hear, and believe in his Name; which is
according to the tenor of the Law, by which Christ will judge all Men Act.
3.22, 23. Romans 2.16. Mar. 16.16.
so that all the way, both from the Types, and the Truth affirmed in Christ,
answering what was typed, it appears, That Jesus Christ offered himself a
Sacrifice to God for sins of two sorts; the first, such as were not against
himself as Mediator, but against God as Creator, which he took on him so to
discharge, that the debt became wholly his, and he has fully discharged the
same, and made full riddance of it before God, and will in his time remove it
from all Men, though many will not now believe it; the second sort of sins,
such as are also against him, as Mediator, many of which he takes away: and as
he has received power, so he uses means that Men on the account of his
goodness, might believe on him; and so, not only see their Freedom from those
sins which are passed, but have these present removed from them also, and so be
Eternally saved; and yet Christ's taking away the first sort of sins, and
provision to take away the second sort also, does still farther appear,

Thirdly, if we consider the difference our Savior makes of sins; some
greater, and more heinous and fearful than others, Mat. 12.31, 32. Mar. 3.28,
29. Luke 12.10.
and yet but one sort excluded forgiveness, Verily, (says he) I say unto you,
All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, (lo, he puts in no
condition here at all) and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme;
but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, has never forgiveness: but
is in danger of eternal condemnation. And whosoever speaks a word against the
Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: (lo, here no condition neither) but
whosoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall never be forgiven him,
neither in this world, nor in the world to come. Now what can sinning, speaking
against, and blasphemy against the Holy Ghost be, but some such manner and
degree of sinning, as in which the Sacrifice offered, and the Offerer, of which
the Holy Ghost has born, and beareath witness, is in such degree contemned, as
the sin cannot be forgiven, without dishonor and wrong to the Sacrifice and
Sacrificer; and so such a sinning, as for pardon of which the Sacrifice was not
offered? for there can be no sin or blasphemy against either Father, or Son, or
Holy Spirit, as they are one God, which is not against them all, and every of
them in one, as much offended as either, personally considered: and so all sin
and blasphemy Mankind fell into, through the fall of the first Man, and that
necessarily spring from Nature so corrupted, while no sufficient remedy to
avoid it, is afforded, they are directly sins and blasphemies against God, as a
Creator, and so against the goodness manifested in the Creation, and against
the Law under which Mankind was fallen: and so, though we according to
appearance, may call these sins against the Father, as indeed they are, yet
they are sins against the Son and Holy Spirit likewise; by whom, as one and the
same God, the Creation was effected: but these sins were so satisfied for, and
done away by Christ in his Oblation offered, which God has so accepted, that
he has remitted all over to Christ; and if not now, (as to Believers it does)
yet in the World to come it shall appear, they shall not be judged and
condemned for sins in this manner committed.

But now Jesus Christ having undertaken, and offered such a Sacrifice to God,
as in which he has purged from before him all these, and obtained power to
make this Grace known to draw Men to him, and to forgive all other following
sins found in Men in this his strife, which indeed are (as before shown) sins
against the Mediator, here by himself called, The Son of Man: yet these
sinnings against him are in a higher degree than the former against the Father,
who in love gave and sent forth, and testified of his Son the Savior of the
World; and against the Holy Spirit of Grace in his Testimonies of him, and
Operations from and with him: but they are more appearingly and directly
against the Mediator that took our Nature, and died for our sins, and offered
himself a Sacrifice to God for us, and now extends means and Spirit to us, to
turn us to himself; yet of these sins against himself, he says, All these
shall be forgiven unto men; as Believers do begin to experiment in this World,
and shall fully in the World to come: yea, unless some higher degree than yet
mentioned, in sinning in a higher manner, Men shall not be cast into a second
Death at the end of the World to come: and what this high degree of sinning is,
is also expressed, Mat. 12.24. Mar. 3, 29.30. Luke 12.9, 10.
to be a speaking against, and blaspheming the Holy Ghost in that evidence he
gives of Christ, and the power and goodness of God in and through him; and so
it is a willing persisting in contempt and refusal of this Grace in the
Mediator, when evidenced by the Holy Ghost; and so rising up in opposition
against his Testimony and strife, till he has finished his Testimony and
strife with them: for till then, the Mediator is mediating for them with God,
and striving with them by his good Spirit; so, as in all their sinnings against
him, though they grieve and sin against the Holy Spirit, yet there is
forgiveness with him, and so hope, while he by his Spirit in means is striving
with them; yea, if that be all the days of a Man's Life: though to all it will
not be so. But when a Man has wilfully despited this Holy Spirit after Light,
and so long and often, that he is wholly taken away, and the Man given up to
Satan, and so become of the Serpentine seed; then is there no more forgiveness
after, because there is no other Sacrifice for him, and this he has utterly
renounced: and this sin is found in such, according to the means, and light in
the means, with which the Holy Spirit had been testifying to them, and striving
with them, as may be seen by comparing the Scriptures in the Margent: in which
sin, Prove. 1.24-31. Jer. 6.16.30. Ez^k. 24.12, 13, 14. Heb. 10.29.
according to the light and power extended to Men in the means less or more, is
the most high degree against the Father, in contemning and ill requiting his
love and graciousness, and treading under foot his Son whom he has sent, and
been giving to them; and the highest degree of sinning against the Mediator,
the Man Christ, in counting as common and profane, that precious Blood and
sacrifice of his with which they were bought, and so given into his dispose to
show favor to, and some in some measure sanctified: and the highest degree of
sinning against the Holy Spirit in his gracious tenders of Grace to them. And
it is most properly called, The sin against the Holy Ghost, because the
goodness of God in the first Creation was manifested without a Mediator to Man
in innocence, and so no need of this sanctifying work while Man was naturally
holy: and the Goodness of God in the Redemption wrought for Men, though
manifested in works of mercy through a Mediator, yet Men so blind and weak,
that they come not in thereby through the Mediator unto God, therefore God out
of his abundant Grace, stretches forth his Hand, by sending through Christ the
Mediator, and in his Name the Holy Spirit, in the means he uses, to enlighten
the Minds, and move at the Hearts of Men, that they might see, and believe,
and so turn; and, after some of their resistings, renews his strife with more
light and power; yea, if they yield not, then with some reproofs and
chastisements. And if, after all this, they sin against light, and willingly
persist despiting, till they have wholly despited the love of the Father
discovered by the Spirit in the Blood of Christ, and the Blood and Sacrifice of
Christ, by which Peace was made for them, and by, and with which the Spirit
has been working on them; and herein despited all the Light, and Reproof, and
gracious Allurements, and Bands of Love, by the Holy Spirit streamed on them,
to bring them in to God; Heb. 10.29. and 6.6.
and so persisting till given up: this proves a third sort and degree of
sinning, for which there is no sacrifice; yea, which contemns the sacrifice,
in which is help for all sins of both the former sorts; yea, for all, but this
casting it off.

Fourthly, and lastly, These forementioned two sorts of sins so offered for by
Jesus Christ, as is said, appears by the Scripture-Declaration, how, and in
what manner, and for what manner of sins and sinning, God does reprove, charge,
and condemn Men, either to Correction, Judgments, or Eternal Condemnation;
which since Christ undertaking, and his Oblation considered, we shall never
find to be for fins simply as fallen in Adam, nor yet simply for their natural
and necessitated weaknesses and swervings, having no remedy afforded them to
help; much less because Christ died not for them, or used no sufficiency of
mean toward them, by which they might have received help; yea, the manner of
God's proceeding with Men, witnesses, That Christ died for them, and has
discharged the first debt for them, and used means in good will, and for good
to them: whence he says, Genesis 6.3.
My Spirit shall not always strive with them. And so proceeds in charging
with Sin, Reproof and Condemnation; Prove. 1.24-31. and9.12. Isa, 1.2-15. and
5.4-8. Ezck. 24.13. Icr. 6.16-30. Mat. 23.37. Ioh. 3.19.
Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and none
regarded; ye would none of my counsel, ye despised all my reproof; ye refuse to
hearken, ye harden your hearts, etc. I would, and ye would not. And this is the
condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather
than light. Which is another manner of Charge and Condemnation, and for another
manner of sinning, putting under another manner of guilt, than as Men fell in
Adam. And these are every way directly Men's own sins, for which there is
cleansing and pardon to be received in and through Christ, till the Grace of
his Oblation testified by the Holy Spirit be wholly despited: but these things
are shown before, and will be more in the after-Discourse; only I have been
thus large, to show, that Christ offered his Oblation, both to take away the
sins Mankind was fallen into, and to procure authority and fitness to take
away the following evils found in Men, by offering it to God: and for the
making that known, and taking away the following evils, by application of the
virtue of his Oblation to Men; of which, in his Intercession. And yet farther,
to show for what he gave himself for us: it was,

3. That by this Sacrifice so offered, he might become the Lord of of all Men,
and Savior of the World, that so he may rightfully dispose of them, and use
such means to make known his Death and Sacrifice, and the Ends and Virtues of
the same to them, as he (being one with his Father in his will and design)
pleases: and so to reprove and comfort, Romans 14.9.12. Psa. 2.6, 7, 8, 9.
or abase and exalt, accordingly as he pleases: and this is express; For to
this end he died, and rose, and revived, that he might be the Lord both of the
dead and the living, etc. 2 Cor. 5.15.
answerable to the promise made to him by the Father on that account: and so it
is said, He died for all, that they which lived (each in their several ages)
should not kenceforth (from the making this known to them, though before they
did) live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them, and rose again:
(suitable to that, Romans 14.7, 8.) and that on this Ground, 1 Cor. 6.19.
because they are not their own, but are bought with a price. Hence the
greatness and grievousness of the sin of Apostates, 1 Pet. 2.1. Heb. 8.6.
is thus set out, They deny the Lord that bought them: and so also by this
Sacrifice offered, he obtained a more excellent Ministration.

And for all this, Jesus Christ gave himself a Sacrifice to God, and has on
his very offering obtained the same; as also,

4. That he might in his season, and at and after his next appearing raise the
Dead, and draw all Men to him, Is. 53.11, 12. Luke 24.26. Joh. 6.39-40. and
12.24, 31. Romans 2^6. and 14.9.12. 2 Timothy, 4, 1. Pet. 4.5. Phil. 2.9, 10, 11.
before his Judgment Seat, and judge them by his Law, according to the means
he uses toward them; and absove and bless, or condemn and curse, according to
their living to, or rebellion against him. And this may every one read plainly,
according as was prophesied, and is now plainly testified.

5. That he might have an incorruptible inheritance, to bestow on, and possess
with, all those, that in the day of Grace, Heb. 9.12. Ephesians. 1.14.
believe on him, and live to him, as is express.

And because Jesus Christ by his offering himself has at once obtained all
this, and is invested with all his Power, Authority and Privileges; and this
being that, both for which he gave himself, and which obtained, he is a perfect
Savior; and in making known of which, he prosecuteth his End for essicacies on
Men, I have therefore mentioned them first, and so will proceed to the next and
last Particular.

CHAP. 8.
6. To and for what end he therefore offered this Sacrifice.

THe gracious End of Christ, in giving himself for us, and so offering himself
a Sacrifice to God for all beforesaid, is fully and plainly express in Tit.
2.14. That he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a
peculiar people, zealous of good works. The words are plain, and worthy
minding, both what he says not, and what he does say: first mind, he does not
say, He gave himself for us, and has redeemed us from all iniquity; as if both
these were, either both one work, or done in one and the same time together:
no, not so; but, He gave himself for us, 2 Cor. 5.21.
that he might be made the righteousness of God in him. He says neither, That
he was made sin for us: nor, That we are or were in that act made the
righteousness of God in him: but, That we might be, etc. and expresses it
clearly, to be, not one work or act done at once, but two: and the first done,
that by that the other might be done.

Again, note, That he says not, He gave himself for us, and did redeem us from
all iniquity; as if, though two works, yet both done in his Oblation, or that
one offering of his to God: But, He gave himself for us, that he might, etc. as
if in more words, it should be said, He gave himself for us, that upon and
after that Oblation and Offering perfectly made, he, by virtue thereof, in
making it known, and so applying, might redeem us from all iniquity: like that
said, 1 Pet. 3.13.
For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he
might bring us to God. Which plainly appears, another work following the first,
and to be done by the first; yea, so, as that without the first, first done,
the other could not have been done; and the first therefore done, that the
other might be done by it, in the Discovery and Application of it.

Again, he does not say, He gave himself for us, and will certainly and
infall^^ly redeem us from all iniquity, etc. but, He gave himself for us, that
he might redeem us, etc. that is, that by virtue of his Oblation once offered,
he might be fitted and empowered to do it; and so do unto us, that whereby we
might be indeed redeemed: all which fitness and power, as is shown, he has
fully obtained; and in which doing, he is faithful, and neither has, is, nor
will be wanting. And so, though the word might, when any thing is said to be
done, that by it another thing may be done, when it is spoke of God or Christ
his doing, in, to, and by himself, it implies certainty and infallibility, in
respect of the propounded effect; but when it is spoken of the doing of God and
Christ, in and to fallen Men, that another thing might be done thereby, it does
not always imply certainty and infallibility, of that one, and the same effect
propounded as the End, to be found and accomplished in every of those fallen
Men; but hopefulness and sufficiency of Mean, that shall verily effect it, if
they willingly resist not. And so enough done, that all might enjoy the blessed
effect, though many by their own folly and wilfulness, deprive themselves
thereof: as we may see in the like use of the word might, Levit. 26.45.
in the works of God: I (says the Lord) brought Israel out of the Land of
Egypt in the sight of the Heathen, that I might be their God, etc. And this
explicated thus by the Prophet; Thus says the Lord God, Ezekiel. 20.5, 6, 7, etc.
In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand unto the seed of the
house of Jacob, and made my self known unto them in the Land of Egypt: when I
lifted up my hand unto them, saying, I am the Lord your God; in the day I
lifted up my hand unto them, to bring them forth out of Egypt into a Land which
I had espied for them, which is the glory of all Lands, etc. And how plainly
this was expressed, that he would do it, is shown, Exodus 3. and 6. Exodus 3.8, 18.
and 6.6, 7, 8.
and yet of them so spoken to, and dealt with, that they might have enjoyed all
promised, very many miscarried, and fell short through their own follies and
rebellions, as both the story in Exodus, Exodus 32. Ez^k. 20.7, 8, etc. Ps.
78.31. and 106.17-27.
and the Prophecy in Ezekiel, and the Psalms, tell us. And indeed this
Redemption of Israel out of Egypt, is the very type of that Redemption of
Israel out of Iniquity, mentioned, Tit. 2.14. which is expressed in suitable
expressions Rev. 5.9. Col. 1.13, 19. ^Pet. 2.9.
: this redeeming Men from all iniquity, being after the Redemption of Man's
Nature in himself, and so for Men in and by his Oblation offered; yea, this
effected by that, in making it and the Redeemer known, that Men might thereby
be brought to the heavenly rest; as the Wonders of the Lord made known to
Israel, in bringing them out of Egypt, that by Moses conduct, he might have led
and brought them to Canaan: from whence as an admonition Jude warns Believers
to remember, Jude 5.
How, that the Lord having saved the people out of the Land of Egypt,
afterward destroyed them that believed not: and they being both there and in
other places, set forth for types and ensamples to us 1 Cor. 10.1-11.11.18.
. I will instance yet that which comes nigher: it is said, Psalm. 78. He
establshed a testimony in Jacob, etc. That the generations to come might know,
etc. That they might set their hope in God, etc. And might not be as their
fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, etc. Which yet many of them
were, Psa. 78.5, 6, 7, 8.
and did not set their hope in God, as the story shows.

If it be replied, This was but a Ministration;

I might answer, This was God's End expressly, that they might know, and hope in
God, etc. And that he did order and appoint insufficient and ineffectual means
to bring his Ends about, I hope none will say; neither (as I hope) will any
deny, This giving of a Testimony, to be a Type of his giving Christ for a
Testimony for the same End. But I will come to a closer Answer, Isa. 55.4.
in that which the Lord affirms his own doing, by the Mouth of the Prophet,
Jer. 13.11, 12. As the girdle cleaves to the loins of a man, so have I caused
to cleave unto me, the whole house of Israel, and the whole house of Judah,
says the Lord; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and
for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear, etc. And so to this
very business our Savior himself tells us, God sent not his Son into the world
to condemn the world; Job. 3.17. verse. 14, 15, 18, 19, Ioh. 5.34, 40, 43.
but that the world through him might be saved; yet he does not say or infer,
That the World shall all be certainly saved; no, not so: but, He that (as he is
displayed) believes on him, shall be saved, etc. And so in his own personal
Ministration, he says to the Jews, These things I say, that ye might be saved:
yet many of them to whom he preached to that End, not would come to him, nor
receive his Words, that they might have Life. And the like may be seen in his
end of sending his Gospel by his Servants: so, Act. 26.18.
that all the way the word might, used in setting forth an end aimed at,
implies sufficiency and effectualness in means, to effect the end and good
hope; yea, certainty, if not willingly refused and resisted: but not an
absolute infallibility, that the end in the blessed part of it shall be
accomplished in fallen Men, whether they attend and receive, or no: And all
this is said, not to wave one syllable in the Text; but to show what it says
not; and, how the word might, is, in such business, in Scripture used, when the
ends of things that are to have their efficacy with and in fallen Mankind, are
mentioned. And so let us,

Secondly, mind what he does indeed say; that is, He gave himself for us, that
he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify, etc. This expressly his
gracious End, of giving himself for us, and so of his Oblation, That he might
redeem us from all iniquity, etc. which is partly hinted in the former Chapter,
showing for what he offered himself; which comes here to be enlarged, as it
has reference to this expressed End: and so, that he might, etc. is,

1. That he might have power and authority in the Nature of Man, and as Man
also, even the Son of Man, to be both Mediator between God and Men, and to use
what means he pleases, to redeem Men from iniquity; and to be the judge of
Men, and is foreshewn; and does yet farther appear, Joh. 5.21, 22-26, 27.
in our Savior's own giving this as the ground of the Father's giving to the
Son to have life in himself, to call and to quicken whom he will, and to
execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. And this also by himself
explicated, with his gracious End affirmed, Thus it is written, Luke 24.46, 47.
and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
And that repentance, and remission of sins, should be preached in his Name,
among all Nations, etc. Phil. 2.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Mat. 27, 28. mat. 28.18, 19.
And upon the account of his Sufferings and Sacrifice, this power and authority
being given him, he from thence groundeth his own rightful calling of them
that are weary, etc. to come to him; and on the same ground, gives commission
to his Disciples, to preach the Gospel: and therefore he gave himself for us,
in suffering^, and offering Sacrifice, that he might have this power and
authority as the public Man; and in, and with it, use means by the virtue of
his Oblation, to save, etc. And that God has given him this power and
authority to this end, Act. 5.31, 32.
is affirmed.

2. That he might be filled, in the very Nature of Man, with the immeasurable
fullness of the Holy Ghost, to this End, that the Love, Wisdom, Power, Mercy,
Truth, Goodness and Face of God, might appear to be seen in him, and the Holy
Spirit proceed from the Father, through him in his Name, while in the means he
is displayed. And this our Savior expressly affirmed, Joh. 16.7.
both, That unless he did go away, (which was by his Death and Ascension to
offer Sacrifice) the Comforter would not come; and also, That if he departed he
would send him: and this also, upon the account of his Sufferings and Oblation,
Isa. 50.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Isa. 61.1, 2, 3, 4.
he had (not only the forementioned Power, but God the Lord has) given him the
tongue of the learned, that he should know how to speak a word in season, to
him that is weary. And this explained by himself, The Spirit of the Lord God is
upon me, because the Lord has anointed me, to preach good tidings, etc. And
this affirmed also by the Father, upon the account of his Sufferings and
Sacrifice, Phil. 2.7-10. Heb. 8. Isa. 42.1, 2-8. Mat. 12, 18. and 3.17. and
17.5.
in which he was his Servant, and still is in his Ministration; as in the
Father's well-pleasedness in him, and Acceptance of his Sacrifice and
Mediation, he is his Elect; yea, as the public Man, Behold, says he, I have
put my Spirit on him, and he shall show forth judgment to the Gentiles, etc.

3. That he might, by virtue of his Blood in this his Oblation, Psa. 22.12-22.
and 40.9, 10. Joh. 3.14, 15, 16, and 12.31, 32. Isa. 55.4, 5. Isa. 42.7, 8.
Joh. 5.25, 26, Isa. 52.15. Heb. 9.14. 1 Pet. 18, 19. Rev. 5.9.
with this Furniture he has upon the account thereof, in the means he uses,
especially in the Ministration of the Gospel, declare his Father's Name and
Righteousness, and be himself lift up, and set forth, as the Propitiation for
sins, and the Savior of the World, and so call all Men to him, and therein by
his Spirit open the eyes of the blind, and the ears of the deaf; and give life
to such, as in seeing, see; and in hearing, hear: and so by degrees, in this
life, redeem them from all iniquity, by virtue of his Blood, so applied to, and
sprinkled on their Hearts.

4. That in this redeeming them from all iniquity, he may purify unto himself
a peculiar people, etc. that is, such, as in his redeeming work upon them, are
found believing on him, Tit. 2.11.13. Romans 5.8, 10. Col. 1.22, 23. Ephesians. 5.25,
26, 27.
and yielding to the motions, and teachings of his Grace, he may, and does
still, by virtue of his Oblation, and his Father's Love commended
there-through, besprinkle them more with his Blood, in Gospel-Testimony, and so
purify them a peculiar people zealous of good works, Phil. 2.7-11.
that he may present them in due season spotless to himself; and so have the
glory of his Oblation, in the eternal Salvation of all that have lived and died
in the Faith, and in his righteous judging of all wilful Opposers and Apostates.

This his gracious End in offering his Oblation, and he being righteous, holy,
faithful, his Oblation was so effectual with the Father for all that for which
it was offered, that he has granted him all this, and every way furnished him
for this end, as is foreshewn. And for the Power and Faithfuluess of our
Savior to pursue this End, and so to do all that by which it may be brought
about; enough has been said, and more will be said in treating of his
Mediation and Intercession. And indeed, he is and will be faithful to his
Father, 1 John 2.1. Heb. 2.17. and 5.1-9. and 7.25, 26.
and merciful and faithful to us; he is without sin, holy, unblameable,
compassionate, merciful and able: of which, after. But here in his dealings
with Men, he meets not only with weakness, and so offenses and ill requitals;
but in some, even after their eyes are opened, with willing Rebellion, and
closing them again; and so the efficacy in Men, is not so prevalent as it was
with God; nor the End so certain of being so accomplished in the blessed part,
on every Man, though in every one that believes it will: but these things I
leave to the after-Discourse, having now shown concerning the Oblarion of
Christ, what was offered, who offered it, to whom it was offered; For whom it
was offered, for what it was offered; and, to what End: in which is an
inclusion of his Mediation, and of his coming again, though not explicated,
which (some Traditions and expressions of Men, that darken it, being removed)
will be very useful for our edification; a little of which usefulness, I shall
in that order mention.

CHAP. 9.
An Antidote and Caveat against some unfound Expressions.

FOr those Expressions about the plain Sayings of the Gospel, that are so
Serpentine-like; first, with Queries about the Truth of the plain-appearing
Import of God's Sayings: Has God in saying, Genesis 3.1, 4.
said? was that his meaning? do you think indeed, he meant verily and in truth,
That Christ died for all Men, gave himself a Ransom for all, that he is the
propitiation for the sins of the whole World, or that any do indeed deny the
Lord that bought them, or depart from the Faith, or count unholy the Blood of
the Covenant, wherewith they are sanctified? etc. and then follow on with plain
Contradictions of the Testimony of the Holy Ghost, boldly affirming, Christ did
not die for All Men, he did not give himself a Ransom for All Men, he is not
the propitiation for the sins of the whole World: none that are bought by him
can deny him; none that have true Faith can wholly depart from it; none
sanctified by the Blood of the Covenant, can count it again as a common or
unholy thing: these are so gross, that none that believe the Sayings of the
Scripture for the Testimony of the Holy Ghost therein, will entertain them; and
enough is said before to warn of these, Part 1. chapter 3, and 4, and 5, and 6, and
7, and 8.
so that I forbear other answer to them. But for those Expressions better
colored, though having a tendency to the same End, I shall instance a few of
that learned Mr. Owens.

1. That God will give Faith and Repentance to those, whom he has chosen and
given to Christ to be saved Page 264. Sect. 6.
. If this should be meant of Christ his dying and giving himself a Sacrifice to
God, and by that to save; It Is shown before, That there are none given to
Christ, but upon the account of his Oblation: be was given and gave himself for
us; but none of us given to him, Romans 14.9.
but upon the account of his purchasing us: also, he in giving himself for us,
has saved all Men from perishing for ever under the sentence of the Law, as
Mankind at first fell under it; and in that Death, Romans 5.18.
in which thereby we should have perished: and for eternal Salvation, there are
none given unto him to be saved, but in the Heavenly call, John 6.40, 45. and
17.2, 6. nor is he the Author of eternal Salvation, Heb. 5.9.
but to those that obey him in believing on him: nor can there be any choice,
but in Christ; nor any chosen in him, but as by virtue of his Oblation, he is a
perfect Savior: and so none first chosen for Christ after to die for, nor is
there any elect in him, who are not begun to be saved by him: for the Election
is through the Sanctification of the Spirit, 2 Tes. 2.13, 14. 1 Pet. 2.9. par.
1. chapter 7.
and Belief of the Truth; and the Elect are Holy, etc. but enough is said, in
treating of the Oblation of Christ, to show the Vanity of this Expression; it
being also Scriptureless, and not according to the Rule by himself approved.

2. God purposed to give Eternal Life to his elect Believers, and that none of
them should ever be lost: and committed the accomplishment of this to Christ
Page 84, 2 Cor. 2.17. and 3.12, 13. and 4.1, 2.
. This is no Scripture-Expression, nor expressed in the plainness the Spirit in
the Scripture uses; but with much subtilty, so as it might stand with the
Doctrine he opposes: for if by Elect Believers, he meant only such, as
believing the Grace testified in the Oblation of Christ, are chosen through the
Sanctification of the Spirit, and the Belief of the Truth, unto the Obedience
and sprinkling of the Blood of Christ, and so into union and fellowship with
him, and conformity to him; and so being found believing on Christ, the
Accomplishment of their Salvation is committed to Christ, and none such shall
be lost: Those he opposes, maintain this. But if he mean of an elect Company
in the Counsels of God, preceding the Death and Oblation of Christ; and for him
to offer for, and so accomplish their Salvation: This stands cross to the whole
Testimony of Scripture about the Oblation of Christ, as foreshewn, Par. 1. chapter
7.
and is answered in the former Answer, being no Scripture-saying, nor agreeing
with the Rule there given, and by him approved.

3. That the Fruits of the purchase of Christ shall certainly be bestowed on
all those for whom he died In Epist. to his Higness, p. 2.
. And again, That all the effects and fruits of the Death of Christ, antecedent
to our believing, are deposited in the hand, or righteousness and faithfulness
of God, to whom as a ransom it was paid, etc. to be made out effectually to
them for whom he died, in the appointed time and season: to which he quotes, 1 Timothy 2.5, 6. Heb. 2.17. 2 Cor. 5.18, 19. 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. Page 168.
. None of these places countenancing either of these expressions, and some
contradicting them clearly. And it is before shown, how Scripture plainly
affirms, That Jesus Christ, as the public Man, is by virtue of his
sufferings, and Oblation offered to God, glorified with the Glory, he, as the
Son of God, had with the Father before the World was; and, That he is made, The
Christ; and, The Lord of all, The Savior of the World, The Head of the Church,
The Mediator between God and Men, The great High Priest; yea, all Power and
Authority is given to him; yea, Power to give Repentance and Remission of sins,
to open blind eyes, to communicate the Privileges of sons, to raise the Dead,
and to judge all Men according to the Gospel, and to give rewards to his
Servants the Saints both small and great; to sit on the Throne of David, and
set his suffering-Saints on Thrones with him: and all this, the Fruit of the
Death, Oblation and Purchase of Christ; and attained by him, and to be
believed. O let not Believers be so puffed up, to think all this must be
bestowed on them! all Scripture is against it: let none suffer himself by such
dangerous Expressions to be occasioned to fall into the Condemnation of the
evil Angels that were not content with their place. But let this be waved, as
not intended, though the Expression gives Ground for it; and waving this, the
Expression is waved as false and dangerous: but take it in the best sense we
can, it is a confessed Truth, That the Gifts of Apostles, Prophets,
Evangelists, The visible descending of the Holy Ghost, The Gifts of speaking
with diverse Tongues, The Gifts of Miracles, were all fruits and effects of the
Death, Oblation and Purchase of Christ, as has been shown in plain Texts, and
were procured by him into himself, to be bestowed as Fruits of his Death,
before we believed. And the Spirit says, That all these are not given (not
only not to every one for whom Christ died, but even not) to every Believer and
Member of the Church. So, that this Expression, as it is derogatory to Christ,
so it is contradictory to the plain Testimony of the Spirit in the Scripture.
But let leave be given to wave this, though the Expression will not admit the
waving it, seeing these are things by some attained to, and to be believed. But
if no more is meant, but those Graces necessary to sonship and eternal
salvation, yet the Expression crosses the plain sayings of the Gospel still,
that intimate to us the perishing of some for whom Christ died; and has
plainly foretold us, That some will deny the Lord that bought them: yea, the
Scripture sets forth the Death, Oblation, and Purchase of Christ, as the
Ground of the Lordship of Christ, and of his raising the Dead, and of the
Equity of his judging according to the Gospel; which is all denied by this
Expression.

And yet here is more confusion and darkness in this Expression, in a mistake
of that for what Christ offered himself a sacrifice to God, if not a short
coming also in that which he offered: surely in his paying the debt he died,
that is true; and yet here is more than simply Death, in the Oblation giving,
or Ransom, or Sacrifice; even Death, Resurrection, Ascension, and giving
himself to God: that which he gave and offered to God for us, was himself, his
own Body, as is foreshewn. And that for which he gave himself, was, for Men,
for sinners, ungodly, etc. for us, even for our sins, to take them away; and
for our nature, and persons, to purchase us into his dispose, as is fully shown
and proved. True, if there had been any that God had chosen, and given to
Christ to die for, etc. as Mr. Owen intimates in some of his Expressions; then
they were God's Elect, and Christ his peculiar by donation of the Father before
his Death, and so his Death and Oblation could not be for them to purchase
them, or that they should be his by virtue of that Oblation and Purchase of
his, seeing they were his Father's Elect, and his by gift before; no need to
buy after, that which was given before; therefore it must not be for them, but
for something else for them. And what that is, Mr. Owen's Expression hinteth,
and in other his writings he expresses, as if Christ in giving himself to God,
did purchase of his Father, by his Death and Sacrifice, certain Graces of
Repentance, Faith, Love, and other spiritual Gifts, to be bestowed on some
certain persons fore-given him to die for. That such gifts are the effects and
fruits of the Death and Oblation of Christ, is true and granted, because he by
his Oblation, procured that power and furniture (when he purchased us, and an
Inheritance for all that believe on him) by which he gives and works these
Graces, though purchasing such Graces be no Scripture Phrase: and yet this is
still more unscripturelike, in intimating, as if all these Graces and Fruits
were not in the Hands of Christ to bestow, though purchased by him; but
deposited into the Hands of God, etc. Very true, for they are all deposited in
to the Man Christ, in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, Col.
2.3, 9, 10. Isa. 42. 1-7. and 61.1, 2. And to him it belongs to give
Repentance, Faith, Love, and to communicate the Privileges of sons: and this
Power and Authority he purchased, when he purchased Mankind to be given into
his dispose: Par. 1. chapter 7.
so that this Expression suits not to any plain sayings of Scripture, nor to
the approved Rule, to which he commends us for trial.

4. That there was but one type of Christ his intercession principally, namely,
the entrance of the high Priest into the holy of holies Page 216. Sect. 3.
Surely he must comprehend a great deal in the High-Priest's entrance into the
holy of holies, to make that any direct Type of the Intercession of Christ at
all; much more to make it the principal one: for the High Priest entered into
the holy of holies, once every year, and but once in the year; and so at once
in one day made the Atonement for all Israel; and yet for particular
defilements, they needed daily washings and purifications still, else they
should have died in their uncleanness, notwithstanding the Atonement made for
them: answerably Jesus Christ by his own Oblation once offered in the end of
the World, entered into the holy place, and made the Atonement for the sins of
Mankind that they were fallen into, and obtained eternal Redemption; and is
the Propitiation for the sins of the whole World, and remains in the holy of
holies a continual Mediator and Interceder, that by virtue of his Oblation he
may be taking still away the sin of the World, and by a spiritual sprinkling of
his Blood, purify the Hearts of Believers from their personal and particular
sins; without receipt of which purifications, Men may die in their own sins,
notwithstanding the Atonement that was once made for them: and those
Highpriests could not remain in the holy of holies, so to intercede; but came
out again so soon as the Atonement was made: and so the High-Priest's entrance
in the holy of holies once in the year, was principally the Type of the
Atonement made by Christ once in the later end of the World; and the Types of
his Intercession was in other services of the High Priest and Priests, when the
High Priest was come out of the holy of holies, Exodus 28.29, 30. with Numb.
18.1-4, 22, 23. with Lov. 1, and 2, and 3, and 4, and 5, etc.
when in a continual and daily service they made Intercession for the people,
by bearing (or taking away) their iniquities, in Ministrations in the Sanctuary
for them, and burning Incense, beside their often Purifications, which did rather
type out the Intercession of Christ, as is foreshewn, and may be read in
comparing Heb. 9.7-27. and 10.11, 12, 18, 19. with 7.25, etc. and so this
Expression agrees not with the approved Rule, page 26.

5. There is no real difference between the efficacy of the Death of Christ,
and that of his Intercession, upon the actual accomplishment of it Page 216.
Sect. 3.
. This is a very dark saying, and tending to confound things distinct: for sure
the Oblation is already accomplished, his Death over and past, and he alive for
evermore: but the virtue of his Death, and so of his Oblation, abides; but the
efficacy is that here to be minded: and its efficacy with God is seen in this,
that he has made Christ Jesus the Lord, filled him with all fullness of the
Holy Ghost, given all Power and Authority into his Hands, to dispose of all
Men, to raise the Dead, and to judge all. All this is given him, as the effect
of his Death and Oblation: and for this he neither does nor needs to make
Intercession. Therefore the making the efficacies of Oblation - Offerings, and
Intercession-making, as both one, without any real difference in the actual
accomplishment, is not right. Besides, the prevalency of his Intercession with
God is by virtue of his Oblation-fore-accomplished, and with, and in the
Furniture by it obtained, and it always, and in all things for all he
intercedeth, prevails with God, and so he obtains the making known of his
Oblation, and the Virtues thereof for Men, and the Extention of many Means, and
Mercies, and spiritual Operations to them, all which are the efficacies of his
Intercession with God for Men. But now the efficacies, with, and in Men are
various: some, receiving, and so meeting freely with blessing; others,
refusing, and upon that account condemned (not that he intercedeth for their
Condemnation, but) for their refusal of Mercies, extended by the Intercession
of him that had fore-bought them. The efficacy of his Oblation is, in that they
are given into his dispose, and he is their Lord, and shall be their Judge;
which they cannot avoid: and this obtained before Intercession made. The
efficacy of his Intercession, by virtue of his Oblation, is seen in the
Patience, Forbearance, Mercy, Means, and Spirit extended to Men, to bring them
in to be his peculiar People: and its efficacy in Men, is in their believing,
precious; but in their disobedient refusal, heavy, even tending to just
Condemnation: the manner of Christ's judging, being according to the Mercies
and Means he has extended, as Men have received or rejected. And besides, in
those that do receive the Grace extended for his Intercession, it is not all
one, and so prevalent in and with the best of Saints on Earth, nor so
abundantly efficacious with them, as it has been and is with God: such
thoughts, I hope, are far from us, and not intended in the Expression: but the
Expression being Scriptureless, Page 26.
and not agreeing to the Rule, I leave it.

6. That Christ was sprinkled with his own Blood Page 217. Sect. 3.
. This a very dark and Scriptureless Expression: we read of his Garments to be
sprinkled with the Blood of his Enemies, when he revengeth the cause of his
people, Isa. 63.3. but for being sprinkled with his own Blood, we read not: and
what sense to devise to make this true in, is beyond my understanding: for we,
even all Mankind, in and through our first Father Adam, were fallen under the
guilt of manifold sins, charged upon us by that Law, under which we were
fallen; and these could not be pardoned without satisfaction made by Blood
shedding: and for this cause, the Son of God took our Nature, and was made
under the Law for us; and so that debt was reckoned on his account; and he shed
his Blood materially, and died for our sins, and rose for our justification,
and offered up his own personal Body a Sacrifice for us: and so in completing
his Oblation, he, as it was his debt, fully satisfied; and as it was ours,
obtained, by that Oblation, full pardon for us. And this was materially done by
him, and is not anywhere called, The sprinkling of his Blood: yea, his material
Blood, if it were, or could have litten, or been sprinkled materially on any,
in his Circumcision, or scourging, or crowning with Thorns, or nailing to the
Cross, or piercing with a Spear; yet would it not so have cleansed any from sin
(any more than the supposed relics of it profit any now) the virtue of it for
that, being in the virtue of the Oblation offered to God, and he being by his
own Blood (or with the virtue of it) entered into the Heavens, having offered
the Oblation: he is a spiritual Man, and all he does to us now, he does
spiritually; and so not material Blood as shed; and yet the virtue of the same
Blood that was shed, he, by making it known in the Gospel, spiritually
sprinkleth. And this was also figured in the Law, as is shown at large in
another Treatise. And we, Discourse of the precious blood of Christ, c. 4. p.
22, 23.
notwithstanding the Atonement made in Christ, by his Blood shedding and
Oblation, and the making it known (with the pardon of all that debt) in and by
the Gospel, and the m^ans used toward us, have still many following and daily
sins and defilements, and need this spiritual Application, and sprinkling of
his Blood for our cleansing and peace: and we are found weak in believing, and
need that spiritual sprinkling of his Blood to confirm our Faith in him for the
Promises of the New Testament: all which things, how he is furnished to help
us, has been foreshewed. But he is righteous, holy, harmless; in him never
was, or is, or will be any sin: and for what cause he should be sprinkled with
his own Blood, who will fancy? Sure, I will not believe, because it is
Scriptureless, and agrees not with the Rule given and consented to, page 26.

As for those Expressions of Christ dying for his Elect, seeing that there
could be none elect in him, but as he is beheld, as having died and offered his
Oblation; nor is any of Mankind reprobated, but as thus are beheld, rejecting
him that offered the Oblation. And so, though it be true, That Christ has once
died, and offered the Oblation, both for those that now are elect, and those
that now are reprobated; and by virtue of the same Oblation will eternally save
the one, and justly condemn the other: yet he died, and offered the Oblation
for no Man as elect, nor for any Man as reprobated; but for all Men as sinners
fallen in Adam. Therefore that Expression of dying for his elect, or dying for
the reprobate, are neither the one nor the other found in the Holy Scriptures,
but in the sayings of those that strive to shun, or shadow the Light. These and
suchlike Expressions, being not in the Scripture, may, by the Rule, be easily
avoided. And enough is said, and plain sayings of Scripture directed to, in
treating of the Oblation, Part 1. chapter 7.
to fence against all suchlike Expressions: therefore they are forborne here.

CHAP. 10.
Some Instructions from the Gospel-Testimony of the Oblation of Christ, about
Christ; and, the Gospel of Christ.

FRom that is in Scripture testified concerning the Oblation of Christ, what
was offered, by whom, to whom, for whom, for what, and, to what End; we may
perceive, learn, and know certainly, 1. That Jesus Christ is the last Adam, the
second public Man, 1 Cor. 15.45, 46, 46.47. Romans 5.18 Genesis 3.15. Heb. 2.14. 2 Timothy 1.10. 1 John 5.6, 7, 8.
the spiritual Man, the Lord from Heaven, the quickening Spirit; in whom there
is a full Restoration of the Nature of Man, and for Mankind completed, as
there was depravation in the first Adam. And so that he is the promised Seed,
that has, by his own Oblation in himself, as the public Man, taken away sin,
overcome Death, and destroyed the works of the Devil, and is furnished to do,
and will do the same in others, according to the Agreement between the Father
and him; for Mankind, for the good of Men, and the everlasting benefit of all
that unfeignedly believe on him: Genesis 22.18. Gal. 3.13, 14, 16. Genesis 7 5 6 7.
Is. 53.8. and 9.6. Ioh. 10.58. Romans 9.7, 8. Act. 13.32, 33. Is. 9 6. Is. 49.1,
2, 3 8. Hos 12.4. Heb. 5.7 9. Mat. 6.6. Joh. 4.42.
and so he is that true Seed in which is blessing for all Nations, that all
believing in him, may receive it; yea, the true spiritual Abraham, the
everlasting Father; the true spiritual Isaac, or Son of promise, in whom the
Seed shall be called; the true Israel that has prevailed with God, by whom God
speaks with us; yea, he is the great and true Prophet, Act. 22. the great and
only true high Priest, Heb. 3.1, and 7. the true and spiritual David, and King,
Ezekiel. 34. and 37.24. Rev. 22.16. Heb. 7.1. In a word, he is the Christ, the Son
of the living God, the Savior of the World; yea, and so nearly related to us,
that he is the Son of Adam, Abraham, David; yea, the Son of Man, our Kinsman,
that loves us, is allied to us, and in our Nature, who came to save sinners. 2.
That Jesus Christ in respect of his Oblation, Jam. 1.13. 1 Cor. 5.17. Rev.
3.14. Rev. 5.1. Col. 1.18. Is. 42.1 Rev. 1.18. Tit. 3.5, 6. Rev. 1.11, 17. and
22 5, 6, 7.
completed, is the beginning of the Creation of God, the new Creation, called
Emphatically, The Creation of God; he is the first-begotten, and firstborn
from the Dead, the first elect, that was once dead, and is now alive for
evermore: and so he is the Fountain of the proceeding and completing of the
whole new Creation, of Regeneration, of Adoption, Gal. 4.5. of Election, 2
These. 2.13. of Resurrection, 1 Cor. 15.21, 22, 23. yea, the Alpha and Omega,
the first and the last, the beginning and the end in all these; yea, so it
pleased the Father, that he should be the first, and that all fullness should
dwell in him, that in all things, he might have the pre-eminence, Col. 1.18,
19, 20. 3. That Jesus Christ in respect of this his Oblation, Is. 23.16. Heb.
6.1. Is. 32.2. 1 Pet. 2.3, 4, 5. 1 Cor. 3.11. Act. 4.11, 12. Ephesians. 2.^8. Joh.
14.6. and 10.7, 9.
completed, is that precious stone so tried in his Power, Love and
Faithfulness by so great sufferings, and proved excellent and prevalent with
God, and for Men, which God has laid in Sion for a Foundation, a Foundation of
Repentance and Faith, and for Believers to rest and be built upon; yea, he is
the only Foundation, and there is no other whereby Men may be saved; yea, he is
nor only the Foundation, but the true door and way of all right and true
approach to God, and of entrance into fellowship with, and service of him and
his people; yea, he is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. 4. The Testimony of
Christ, being comprehended in the Testimony of his Oblation and Mediation, and
glorious coming again: this of his Oblation, and its prevalency with God for
Men, in that he obtained and is become; which includes and assures, though it
explicate not his Mediation and second coming; it is, and is rightly called,
both, The Word of the Beginning of Christ; and, The Vision of All.


First, Heb. 6.1.
it is called, The Word of the Beginning of Christ, (or as some translate it,
The Doctrine of the Beginning of Christ) of his Incarnation, See the eight
first Chapters of this par. 2.
Death, Resurrection, Ascension, Sacrifice offered, the Ends and Virtues
thereof, the Peace he has made thereby; the Overthrow he has given to Sin,
Satan, Death; the Redemption he has obtained, and the fullness of Spirit he
has received, even for the Rebellious, that the Lord might dwell among them,
he being the Savior of the World, the Propitiation for the sins of the whole
World, the Lord of All: so, as whoever believes in him, shall not perish, but
have everlasting life: and he the Judge of All, and the Love of God to Manward,
herein testified. This the Word of the Beginning of Christ, and the Beginning
of his Word, (which with an Emphasis, and because of the slowness of Men to
believe, Psalm. 119.160.
is said to be) true, and for ever, and from the beginning: and it is rightly
called, The Word of the Beginning of Christ; and, The Beginning of his Word:
because it is, 1. The Discoverer of Jesus Christ, as the beginning of the new
Creation; Luke 24.26, 44, 46, 47. Col. 1.15, etc.
and so of those things, which he was first to do, and has first done in his
own Body, in offering his Oblation to God; and of the things effected thereby,
of which he is the beginning, and by which he is furnished to complete, and
will complete the new Creation, as has been said. 2. This that which was first
discovered and preached in Paradise, Genesis 3.15. and 12.3. and 22.18. Joh. 1.1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. 1 John 2.1, 2, 3.
before the Covenant made with Abraham; yea, this also first preached to
Abraham, before the Covenant made with him, and confirmed to him after; and was
preached by Moses, and all the Prophets after; of which the Spirit in the
Evangelists, says, In the beginning was the word, etc. And that which was from
the beginning, etc. 3. This is by the appointment of Christ the first thing to
be made known and preached to any and all people, Joh. 3.14, 15, 16, 17. Mar.
1.14, 15. 1 Cor. 15.3, 4 2 Cor. 5.19, 20. Act. 2, and 3, etc.
and the first to be believed and received, that Men may be saved: and even
this was so first and constantly preached by the Apostles, and by Believers
first received. 4. The History of these things by one Evangelist, called, Mat.
1.1. Mar. 1.1. Luke 1.1, 2, 3, 4.
The Book of the Generation of Christ; Is by another called expressly, The
beginning of the Gospel of Christ: And by another said, To be written, that we
might know the certainty of those things which were declared concerning Jesus
Christ, by them which from the beginning of Christ's ministration, were
Eyewitnesses and Ministers of him. Yea, a fourth adds, Writ for this end,
Joh. 20.31.
that we might believe, that Jesus (of whom they wrote, That died and rose
again, and ascended into Heaven, and offered up the acceptacle Sacrifice to
God, and now sits at the right hand of God) is the Christ, the Son of God;
and that believing we might have life through his Name. 5. This Doctrine of the
Oblation of Christ, Gal. 3 1. Romans 10.8, 9. and 4.24, 25. Psa. 119.130. Joh.
3.16. 1 Ioh. 4.9, 10. Tit. 3.4, 5, 6. Romans 5.8, 10. Phil. 3.7, 8, 9. 1 John
2.20, 21, 27, 28.
is the entrance into the full Knowledge of Christ, and the Enjoyment of the
forming of Christ in the Heart; it has the precedence and first entrance into
the Mind and Heart of those that are drawn to believe aright: and in its
coming, it gives Light and Understanding, even to the simple: yea, the Love of
God to Mankind is therein made known and seen; so, as by the Divine Force that
is in it, it draws the Heart to God, and takes it off from other things, and
so uniteth and conformeth it to Christ, and so affords it understanding for
knowing all that follows in both the other Branches of the Testimony. And for
all these Causes, and in all these Respects, it is rightly called, The Word of
the Beginning of Christ; and, The Beginning of his Word. And yet there is one
Cause more for which it may be so called. 6. Because it is the great Oracle of
God in the holy of holies, whence all the Oracles of God proceed; Heb. 5.12.
and 6.1, 2.
by which also the first Principles of the Doctrine of Christ are framed in the
Heart of Believers. Jesus Christ, by virtue of his Oblation, is the Mercy-Seat,
Propitiatory and Oracle; in beholding and minding of whom, as he has made
Peace by his Death and Oblation, and received Spirit and Power, as has been
shown, these Oracles are taught us by it, viz.
I. Romans 8.3. Gal. 2.21. Heb. 9.22. and 10.4.7. Psalm. 40.7, 8. and 49.7, 8.
That all Mankind was through the first Adam lost, and are through his fall,
and from him sinners in themselves; their Nature and Ways, vile; their
Righteousness and Works, vain; their Desert, Death; and nothing able to help
and deliver them, but the Blood, Death and Sacrifice of the Son of God. II.
Joh. 1.14. Romans 4.25. 1 Pet. 2.24 1 Timothy 2.6. Heb. 10. and 9.14.
That this Son of God took Man's Nature, and became a perfect and public Man;
and in that Body of his, did die for our sins, and rise for our justification,
and offered up himself a Sacrifice to God for Men, and made Peace, and obtained
eternal Redemption. III. Heb. 10.10, 12. and 8 1. Mat. 17.5. and 28.18. Romans
14.9.
That God has so accepted his Sacrifice, that he is well pleased in him, and
has set him on his right Hand, and released all Mankind over to him, and
given all Power and Authority into his Hands, and made him Lord of all. IV. 1 John 2.2. and 4.14. Joh. 19. and 3.14, 15, 16, 17.
That by virtue of his Oblation offered, and the Father's acceptance of it, he
is the Propitiation for the sins of the whole World, the Savior of the World,
and the Enlightner of every one that comes into the World; so, as whoever
through that Light extended by him, believes on him, shall not perish, but
have everlasting life. V. Isa. 42.1, 2. Act. 3.22, 23, 24. and 26.17, 18. Joh.
3.6.
That it is the good will of God in Christ toward Men; and that the means he
uses is to that end, That they should hearken to his Son, and so believe in
him, and receive life from him, and live to him. VI. Joh. 5.28, 29. Romans 2.16.
and 14.9, 12. 2 Cor. 5.10.
That in his time he will raise all Men, and judge them according to the
Gospel, as they have yielded and obeyed, or persisted in Rebellion and
Disobedience to the Light in the means he has extended unto them for that end
that they might have repented.


All these Oracles come forth from the Oblation of Christ, known and believed;
Heb. 5.12. and 6.1, 2, 4, 5.
and these Oracles minded and believed, do teach to, and frame in the Heart
those first Principles of Repentance from dead Works, and Faith toward God,
etc. accompanied with those operations of the Holy Ghost's, and tastes of the
Heavenly Gift, etc. mentioned, Heb. 6. therefore this Doctrine of the Oblation
well called, The Word of the Beginning of Christ; and also this Testimony of
the Oblation of christ,

Secondly, is called, The Vision of All; that which is the choice of all that
God has discovered, Isa. 29.11. Romans 1.5. and 16.26. Jude 3.
and his Prophets have seen and declared; in which, all Men are concerned, and
which is needful for all Men, and to be declared as true to them for the
Obedience of Faith; whence also, it is called, The Faith of the common
Salvation, being, The Vision of All. And this Doctrine of the Oblation of
Christ, is rightly called, The Vision of All, because that Jesus Christ, Romans
1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. so to be preached for the Obedience of Faith to all Nations,
for offering this Oblation; First, he did take the Nature of all Mankind, he
was made under the Law for all, he bare the sins of all, he died for all, gave
himself a Ransom for all, calls all, enlightneth all, is God's Salvation for
all; and being all this, God will have him so to be preached to all, and set
forth as an Object of Faith for all; yea, as he is, The Savior of the World,
The Propitiation for the sins of the whole World. All which are before shown,
in treating of the Oblation, by plain sayings of Scripture: and yet, this is
still farther to be noted about this Vision or Doctrine, Joh. 20.31. Luke 1.1,
2, 3, 4. Ephesians. 3.3, 4. Ioh. 3.14, 15. Heb. 2.2. Col. 1.28. 1 Cor. 1.30. Romans
1.16, 17.
That God will have it plainly written and declared; yea, it is so written, and
in Ministration to be held forth to all; yea, so explained and elevated, that
all and every Man may behold and read it for his healing; yea, see himself
perfect in Christ, that is, perfectly satisfied for, and redeemed from the
Curse of the Law by Christ, and in him fullness of Wisdom, Righteousness,
Sanctification and Redemption; yea, fullness of Spirit and Life: so, as
beholding him, he may believe; and in believing, receive it all. And, Isa.
55.4. 1 John 4.9, 10, 14. Ephesians. 2.13-18. 2 Timothy 1.10.
as this is set forth as a common Salvation to all, so likewise the
preciousness and efficacy of the Blood and Sacrifice of Christ, the immensness
of the Love of God to Mankind in the Gift of his Son, and commended through
his Blood, the open way of approach here-through to God; and so bringing
Immortality and Life to Light by the Gospel. And so the Ground, Isa. 55.1-4.
Mat. 11.27, 28. Rev. 22.17. Isa. 45.22, Heb. 2.2.
Freedom, Motives and Helps for all, and every, or any one to come in, and
believe; and the certainty of enjoyment in believing, and sure hope of Glory,
these to be declared, that he that hears, beholds and reads the same, may
be saved, and run to the enjoyment of all in Christ. These things being all in
plain sayings of Scripture before cited, often shows, That such is the
beginning of his Word; and, that it is the Vision of all, in which such
Testimony of Christ, and good News for Mankind: and so the Key of Knowledge,
opening the Door to the Knowledge of the Kingdom. Oh loving and glorious
Christ! Oh excellent Oblation! Oh blessed Gospel! Of which Gospel-Testimony,
concerning the Oblation of Christ, I will say yet one thing more, about its
Usefulness in Ministration.

CHAP. 11.
The Use Ministers of the Gospel are to make of this Doctrine.

THe Oblation of Christ for us all, Tit. 2.14. and 3.4.
and the Love of God to Mankind therein appearing, as before declared, is that
with which, by the appointment of God and Christ, and the Teachings of the Holy
Spirit, the Ministers and Preachers of the Gospel, are to do their whole Work,
for convincing Men of Unbelief, and drawing Men to Repentance from dead Works,
Heb. 5.12. and 6.1, 2.
and Faith toward God; and instructing them in the Doctrine of Baptisms, and
laying on of Hands, and Use of all the Ordinances of God; and for confirming
their Faith in the Resurrection of the Dead, and of Eternal Judgment. This
being the Foundation of all these, yea, 2 Cor. 5.14, 15, 19.20, 21. and 6.1, 2.
Isa. 28.12, 26. Romans 5.1, 2.5, 8, 9, 10, 11. and 8.32-35. Heb. 9.28. Tit. 2.11,
14. and 3.4.
by and with this Doctrine of the Oblation of Christ for us all, to extend and
press Reproofs, Exhortations, Beseechings, Instructions, and Consolations; yea,
with this, and by this, to direct to Peace with God, and Confidence in him, and
Hope of the fruits of the Mediation and Intercession of Christ; and so to a
comfortable waiting for his coming again: yea, in that before said, and places
alleged, it plainly appears, That this Oblation of Christ, and the Love of
God to Mankind, appearing there-through, is that Grace of God saving to all
Men; and that which in the appearance in the evidences of it, specially in the
Gospel-Declaration, saves and teaches; Tit. 2.14. and 3.4, 5, 6, 7.
it saves the Beholders of it, by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of
the Holy Ghost, which (here-through) he richly sheds on them; that being
justified by his Grace, they should be made Heirs according to the Hope of
Eternal Life. And this to be affirmed, to stir up Men to good Works also; Tit.
3.8. and 3.11, 12, 13, 14.
For this Grace of God, saving to all men, in its appearing, teaches us, That
denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and
godly in this present world, looking for the blessed hope, and the glorious
appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for
us, that he might redeem, etc. So precious a Stone is he, that so set forth,
effects such things; and so precious an Ointment (in the Spirit's going forth
in this Doctrine) is this, 1 John 2.19, 20, 21, 27, 28.
That it teaches Believers all things, and is Truth, and is no Lie; yea, and
so fully teaches them, that they need not that any Man teach them [other
Doctrine, or in other Manner,] but as this Anointing teaches them of all
things; yea, no otherwise then by and with this, and according to this, were
they to be taught.

So, that all that the Ministers of the Gospel have to do in their
Ministration, they are, as they desire approbation of, 1 Cor. 1.17, 18, 21, 23,
24.
and blessing in their Ministration from God, so to do all their Ministration
by and with this. Oh that they would all be persuaded to this!

But this having always been rarely found, Isa. 28.12, 14. and 29.10, 11. Psalm.
118.22. Mat. 21.42. Act. 4.11.
That the professed Teachers and Builders in the Church, would hearken to, but
rather slight this as a mean way of teaching; yea, and in these days it being
rarely found, either in practice or approbation among many professed and
admired Ministers of the Gospel: I shall hint a little more, to evidence, That
with this Doctrine of the Oblation of Christ for us all, they are to do their
whole Business in their Ministration.

1. This is that set forth and appointed to be set forth by God, even the
Father, for this end: Romans 3.25, 26. 1 John 2.2.
Him has God set forth to be a propitiation, through Faith in his Blood, to
declare his righteousness for the remission of sins, etc. And to the Ministers
he has said, Isa. 28.12, 16.
This is the rest, wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the
refreshing, etc. And that it was this, is evident, verse. Act. 10.36, 39, 40,
42, 43. Joh. 3.14-17. Luke 24.45, 46, 47, 48. Joh. 15.4, 5, 6, 7.
16. and the same commanded by him to the first Witnesses of Christ, to the
same end.

2. This also was both appointed and practifed by our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, in his own personal Ministration; yea, he affirms plainly, That (as no
Man in any spiritual good, so Ministers for bringing any Fruit to God in their
Ministration) without him they can do nothing.

3. This also of Christ having once died, Joh. 15.26, 27. Act. 5.31, 32.
and being risen, and offered himself a Sacrifice to God for us all; and being
accepted of God, and so displayed, in the Gospel ministered, is that, by, and
of, and with which the Holy Ghost restifying of Christ, does both convince,
teach, and lead, etc.

1. He thus convinces of Sin, of Righteousness, and of Judgment. Joh. 16.7,
8, 9, 10, 11. 1 John 5.9, 10, 11. Isa. 55.4. Joh. 5.37-40. and 15.22.


Of Sin, because they believe not on him, that died for their sins, and made
peace by his blood, in whom God has given us Eternal Life; of whom God has
born witness, and through him testified his Love, that men might believe, and
in believing have Life.

Of Righteousness, That all complete Righteousness is in him, Heb. 9.7, 12, 14
and 10.1-11, 12, 14.
and all other Righteousness of Men, vain: seeing, all other Highpriests
entering the holy of holies came forth again, still to offer with Blood and
Sacrifices again; but he, having approached to his Father with that one
offering, it is so accepted, that he comes forth no more to suffer, and offer
himself a Sacrifice propitiatory again, but is set at the right hand of God: an
evident demonstration of Righteousness completed in and by him, and the vanity
of all other Righeousness besides.

Of Judgment, because the Prince of this World is judged already, Christ
having by death overcome him that had the power of death, Meb. 2.14. Col. 2.14,
15, 16. Col. 2.3, 16. Mat. 28.18. Joh. 5.27, 29.
having spoiled Principalities and Powers, and made a show of them openly,
triumphing over them in it. So that he is rightful Lord of all, and all
Judgment is in his hands, both for discerning, appointing and sentencing. To
which acknowledgement of all this, if Men yield not now, Isa. 45.21, 22, 23.
Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. 2 These. 2.10.
in these his gracious convincements, they shall at the last day be brought to
it by his irresistible Force, when they shall be left without excuse, and
justly condemned, because they did not receive his convincements, when in
acknowledgement they might have been saved.

2. He also even thus, and by this foresaid, teaches the convinced Believers,
and so leads them into all Truth; not by a speaking of himself, giving
immediate Light, Inspirations, Motions, and Dictates, without any Ground or
Bottom from the Sacrifice of Christ; nor by an Exaltation of his own Shines or
Inspiration, to bottom the Believers on them, or lift them up by them; nor does
he take of the things of the Believers, as they are Heirs, either their
Righteousness, their Changes, their Visits, or any thing wherein they are
better than others, to ground their Faith on; nor does he discover to them any
secret purpose, counsel or election of God concerning them, preceding the Death
and Oblation of Christ, Joh. 16.13, 14, 15. and 14.26. and 15.26, 27. with Luk
24.46, 47. and 10.3, 7, 9.
purchasing the same, and as the Fountain of the same to them: But he speaking
not of himself, but of what he receives from the Father and the Son, from whom
he proceeds; and in bringing to mind his sayings, he takes of the things of
Christ, his Death, Resurrection, Sacrifice-offering, Peace mad and the Father's
Acceptance, and Exaltation of him; and so of his Sonship, Election, Fullness,
and Privileges: and so glorifying him, does lead Believers into all Truth.

3. This also the Apostles and first Witnesses of Christ, Act. 2.32-38. and
3.15-26. and 10.36-43. and 13.23 47. 2 Cor. 13.14-21.
according to the Command of God and Christ, and the Spirits guidance,
practiced in their Ministration, preaching this Oblation; and by and with it,
all their Reproofs, Exhortations, Instructions, and Consolations: yea, they
determined in their Ministrations to the People, not to know (own, 1 Cor. 2.1,
2.
approve, or make use of) any thing save Jesus Christ, and him crucified; not
any other Doctrine, Counsels, Works, Learning, Wisdom of Words, or Excellency
of Speech among their Hearers: whence their whole preaching is called, 1 Cor.
1.18, 19, 20.24.
The preaching of the Cross; and that said to be the power of God to us which
are saved; though to unbelievers, foolishness, and a Stumbling Block: such
fullness they saw in this Oblation of Christ, and such use did they make thereof
in all their Ministration.

4. This Death and Sacrifice of Christ, the Purgation made thereby, Mat. 28.19.
Mar. 6.15. with Iuk. 24.46, 47, 48. Romans 4.11. with Col. 2.11, 12. Romans 6.3-8.
1 Cor. 12.13. Gal. 3.13, 14, 27.
and the Essicacies thereof, is that, which Baptism with Water in the Name of
the Lord, in its way, and as an addition to vocal preaching of the Gospel, does
preach and witness; and into which we also are baptized, when, and as we are
spiritually baptized into Christ.

5. This also is that, the continual remembrance whereof we are to celebrate,
and show forth, in our use of the Supper of the Lord, till he come again, 1
Cor. 11.23, 24, 25, 26.

6. It is this, and this only, in and by which is opened for us the new and
living way for all our approach to God, Heb. 10.18, 19, 20. Joh. 10.7, 9. and
14.6. Ephesians. 2.13 18.
and into union and fellowship with him and his people, and acceptable service
of both.

So that this Doctrine of the Oblation of Christ for us all, is that with which
the Ministers of the Gospel are to do all their work in their Ministration; and
so doing and so speaking, Prove. 14.7. 1 Pet. 4.11. 1 John 2.20, 21, 27, 28. 2 Timothy 2.15.
they shall speak with the Lip of Knowledge, and as the Oracles of God, and
teach as the anointing Believers have received, teaches; and so divide to
every one their Portion, and answer all the cavilling Objections of the
Adversaries, that pretend contradictions in the Scripture: for in holding forth
this Oblation, as is shown, they shall clearly show, how Jesus Christ was
before all things, and yet as the public Man, after Adam; and so how he was
both before and after Adam, Abraham, David; and how the Lord, and yet the Son
of David; and how equal to the Father, and yet was in the flesh inferior to
the Father: how as the great Sacrificer he died and offered himself a Sacrifice
and Ransom for all Men; and also, as the faithful and persecuted Shepherd, laid
down his Life for his Sheep, even the Sheep of his Ministration: and so how he
left the World, and is not here, but in Heaven; and yet how he remains here,
and is with and in his people on Earth: and many like things by the discovery
of Jesus Christ according to his Oblation offered, are answered.

But they that despise this Use of the Oblation in their Ministration, and set
light by it, because it opens so plain and easy a way of Knowledge, and takes
away that excessive Honor, and, as some conceive, the necessary use of their
great Learning and skill in Philosophy, in Logic, Rhetoric and School-Arts,
and so would hinder the Admiration of them, both for these, and also for some
fleshly humility, and outside appearing severity and holiness, which yet they
have in the Hearts of the People, and thereby hinder their power of ruling over
the Consciences and Faith of the people, and so stain the pride of all their
Glory: Isa. 28 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17. with c. 29.9, 12, 12, 14, 15.
and therefore they reject to submit to such use of the Oblation of Christ in
their Ministration; and yet to color the evil of their refusal, they will use
all their skill to have here a line and there a line, here a precept and there
a precept of the Gospel; and with such subtilties carry on the business, as if
the Vision of All were a sealed Book: and whatever is there said of Christ his
dying for all, and being the Propitiation for the sins of the whole World, etc.
that every one might believe, and in believing have life and refreshing, and so
rest: yet that is a thing sealed up, it is not to be taken plainly according to
the import of the words, it belongs to some elect Company, which unlearned Men
cannot know, nor the unlearned neither, who they be that are of that number,
till by some of their studied Demonstrations, it come to be manifested: and to
them you must resort for this Knowledge; for the work of their Ministry is to
help Men to know who be of that number; and as for unlearned Men, they must be
kept humble, and not presume to think themselves able to read the Vision, or
dare to understand it, according to the plain import of the words and sayings
in the Vision; yea, such by their great learning do so garnish over the matter,
that neither their secret end, of self-advancing, nor their slighting the
Foundation, and Vision of all, may appear to the people; yea, they conceive, to
any, for they say, Who sees us? Who can accuse us? Jer. 5.31. and 8.8, 9.
But these want true Wisdom, and make false and vain preachings and writings;
and scorning to stoop to his command, in directing the People for rest and
refreshng to this appointed rest, God sets himself against them, Isa. 28.12,
13, 14, 16, 17.
to advance what they despise and cast shame on them: and they persisting after
warning, become drunk with conceits, and asleep, and full of dreams; Isa. 29.9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Prove. 14.7. and 19.27. Jer. 23.16, 17, 28, 29
Mat. 15.1 Cor. 1.18, 19-24. Romans 1.16.
and so teaching Men's Precepts, lead the people to an hypocritical zeal and
holiness in worshipping God: and God sets himself to blast and punish them, and
will discover their subtilties, that Believers shall know and reprove them: and
if yet they persist in their way, and teaching the documents of Men, he warns
Believers not to hearken to them, but to let them alone, and not to regard
their dreams; assuring us, that all devotion and worshipping of God by Men's
documents, is vain: his Word is the Wheat, the Rest Chaff; his Word the Hammer
that breaks the Stone, the preaching of the Cross; the Gospel is the Power of
God, and that wherein his power goes forth to save. So has God magnified the
word of the Oblation of Christ.

The second Branch of the Testimony of Christ.
CHAP. 12.
Of the Mediation and Intercession of Christ. And first, of that general.

BY the Intercession of Christ, I mean also his Mediation, but not that part of
his Mediation at once made in that one Oblation in his once offering up of
himself a Sacrifice to God, which is one part, and the first part of his
Mediation, in which the first work and business was completed: but that meant
here, is his continued Mediation; that in which, by virtue of his own Oblation
once offered, and his first work finished, he remains a Mediator still,
ever-living, mediating and interceding: and of this his continual Mediation,
that is still doing, is in this Branch of the Testimony to be considered: and
it is both general, and more special, as will appear: and so I will treat first
of the General.

The general Mediation and Intercession of Jesus Christ is between God and Men.
There is one God, 1 Timothy 2.5, 6.
and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a
Ransom for all Men. In which it is plain, That Jesus Christ gave himself a
Ransom for all Men: not, That he is giving; but, Has given himself a Ransom
for all. That work is done and finished: and yet this is here also evident,
That notwithstanding the Ransom given, and the Purgation and Atonement made,
and the Redemption thereby obtained, and the Love and Mercy shown through this
Ransom given in means to draw Men to God; Men are found sinners still upon
another account, Romans 2.4, 5.
even against the Grace that should lead them to Repentance, and so not of one
mind with God, but averse to him; and so need a Mediator: but yet God in
Christ is yet of one mind in his Love to extend Mercy, and therefore has
found out and given this his Son, and our Kinsman and Savior, the
Ransom-Giver, to be the Mediator between him and Men. So then this is also
plain, Gal. 3.20.
That this Mediator is he, even the same Jesus Christ, that gave himself a
Ransom for all Men; and, That his Mediation is with, and by virtue of that
Ransom given. Now a Mediator is more than a Dayes-man or Arbitrator, to lay his
Hand on two Parties and variance: to bring the one to abate some part of the
Debt or Trespass, and the other to pay and satisfy some part; and so to make
Friends, and at one: Joh 9.33, 1 Samuel 2.25.
such a one would not be sufficient for us, nor can such a one be found. But
this Mediator is one, that by an infinitely-unvaluable Sacrifice, has fully
paid the Debt we, were first run into; he gave himself a Ransom: and by the
farther provision made in that Sacrifice, and the over-abundant and infinite
value and worth that was in it by virtue thereof, he procures free-forgiveness
of following evils on a new score, and extention of means and Grace to Men, to
bring them into Repentance, and so Peace and oneness with God: so dealing with
God for Men, in procuring for them, and extending to some, Revelation,
Demonstration and making known his mind and goodness to them; and also dealing
with Men from and for God, in opening their Eyes, and moving their Hearts, to
turn to God, and look to him, and be saved: and again still dealing with God
for Men, for patience, pardon and means, still to be extended to them, that so
they might come to Repentance and Faith, and that he in his Father's way may
freely give it to them. By which means, and in which patience, he is striving
with Men, in opening their Eyes, and moving at their Hearts, that they might
believe; and so from the prevalency of his Mediation by virtue of his Oblation,
he is giving them Faith and Repentance: and such a Mediator he is for all Men;
yea, so set to be of his Father, and has himself accepted to perform this
Office also, and is furnished for it with the virtue of his Oblation and
Immeasurable fullness of the Holy Ghost; being faithful, able, and constant in
performance: and so in respect of his receiving from the Father, and so from
God dealing with the people, calling and making known God's mind, being full
of Spirit, Love and Faithfulness; he calls, enlightens, moves, and so strives
with all, 2 Isa. 42.1-7. and 45.22. and 49.6, 8. and 55.5. and 61.1, 2, 3. Joh.
1.4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Romans 2.4, 5.
as has been foreshewn a. And whereas men closing their Eyes which he has
opened, etc. not owning and receiving his reachings and motions, which is the
sin of the world, he yet by virtue of his Blood and Oblation once offered, so
intercedes with God, as to procure such forgiveness, that they are not cut off
presently for these transgressions; but that longer time and patience, and more
mercies and means be extended toward them, and farther strife with his Spirit,
that they might yet repent, believe and be saved. A gracious Mediator,
intimated to us in the Parable of the Vine-dresser, Luke 13.8, 9.
Lord, let it alone this year also, till I dig about it, and dress it: and if
it bear fruit, well; if not, then after, etc.

If any say, This is meant of the Church, the Vineyard of the Jews;

I answer, However meant, it is spoken of particular Trees therein, of some of
which our Savior says, Ye are of this World: Joh. 8.23. Joh. 1.29.
but it is plain express by John Baptist, Behold the Lamb of God which takes
(or bears) away the sins of the world. In which it appears evidently, he
speaks of more than the Atonement and Purgation made; and so of the sins
taken away from before the Face of God at once, by that one Oblation of his
once offered; yea, he speaks of a continued act, by virtue of his Oblation in
Mediation: he takes (that is spoken of a present and continued business, he
takes or bears) away the sin of the world: that is his Office, and his
continued work. That he is faithful in doing, and how he does it, was long
before prophesied: Isa. 53.12.
He poured out his soul unto death, and he was numbered with transgressors, and
he bare the sins of many. And then speaking of another, and farther business,
done by virtue of the former, he faith also, And made intercession for the
transgressors: A little of which we may see fulfilled in Christ's praying for
them that crucified him, Father forgive them, they know not what they do. Luke
23.34.
And this Prayer of his was answered, (yea, in as full a sense and farther
degree than that of Amos) and they so forgiven this great Transgression, that
they were not presently cut off; Amos 7.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Luke 24.47. Act. 2.38.
and 3.26. and 5.31, 32.
but patience and forbearance, and more and greater means extended and used
toward them; yea, the Gospel, after the Resurrection and Ascension of Christ,
first preached to them, and Remission of sins, etc. according to Christ his
Order so rendered and given to them. And many of them did believe and receive
the same. And in like manner he procured patience and long-suffering for other
great Transgressors, even for the same gracious end, That they might repent: 2
Pet. 3.9. Rev. 2.21. 2 Pet. 3^^5.
whence we are willed to account, That the long-suffering of the Lord is
salvation. Yea, we are instructed into the knowledge of this Mediation of
Christ by the Types of old: the Truth of all being fulfilled and found in
Christ: Heb. 9.28.
For Christ was once offered, to bear the sins of man: and unto them that look
for him, he shall appear the second time without sin unto salvation. It is
evident in this place, That more is here spoken of, and meant, than bearing of
sins in his Oblation-offering; 2 Pet. 2 24. Col. 2.14. Romans 4.25 Heb. 9.14. 1
Ioh. 2.1. Romans 6.9.
for those he bare in his Sufferings and Death, and nailed them to his Cross:
so, as he did them all away in his Resurrection, and then by the eternal Spirit
offered himself a spotless Sacrifice to God in the Heavens; nor can there be
any more sin, so imputed to him, or so born by him: he is just, and can die no
more; but his bearing sins now, is his taking them away, and keeping the
punishment of them off from us. And this was also figured to us in the two
Goats: one slain for a sin-offering, figuring out the Atonement made by the
Death of Christ; the other a living Goat, Levit. 16.9, 10, 20, 21, 22. 1 Cor.
15.17. Romans 4.25
over whom was confessed all the iniquity of the Children of Israel; and he
bare them away into a Land of separation, where no man dwelt to be charged with
them. So figuring out the Resurrection of Christ for our Justification, and
bearing away our sins: the forgiveness whereof, men perceive and receive in
confessing and believing on him; and yet a farther bearing away of sins was
here typed, 1 John 1.7, 9.
in that it was of sins confessed after the Atonement was made over the live
Goat that carried them away, etc. But I will not urge that, but come to that
which is more full and plain for this purpose: Aaron the High Priest did bear
the names and the Judgment of the Children of Israel, Exodus 28.29, 30.
when he went into the holy place continually; and he with his Sons the
Priests, were to bear the iniquity of the Congregation, to make Atonement for
them before the Lord; Levit. 10.17.
and this was besides the Atonement made in the holy of holies, once in the
year. And what bearing of iniquity this was, may be clear to us: not that the
iniquity of the people was imputed to the Priests, and confessed over their
heads, and they to suffer the judgment and punishment due to the peoples sins,
and to be offered in Sacrifice for them; not so: But (as skillful Hebricians
say, The word signifies, and the Greeks translates so) to bear and take away;
yea, Numb. 18.1, 2, 3, 4, 5-22, 23.
it is so opened to us in the Scripture, to be by their service and
Ministration in the Sanctuary, by virtue of the great Atonement made: and so by
all their Sacrifices and Purifications in their Ministration, to take away the
peoples sins. Wherce it is plain, their bearing of iniquity was a taking of it
away, by ministering about, and ordering of the holy things; burning Incense,
offering Sacrifices, sprinkling the unclean, etc. (which the people were not
betrusted to do, but the Priests) that they might have God's Ordinances, and
his presence therein, with Mercies continued, to them: and how should the
High Priest bear both the Names and Judgment of the Israelites on his heart,
but in tender compassion, and love to them, and care for them; so to minister
and order the whole Ministration in their behalf? And now sure the Truth of all
this is found in Christ; Heb. 9.24 Job 5.29. Heb. 2.17. and 4.15. and 5.1-9.
he does still appear before God in the heaven of heavens, by virtue of his
Oblation and Sacrifice by him once offered, to take away, and so is taking away
our daily sins; and he able, faithful and full of compassion. Nor is any other
betrusted with this business, nor left to approach to God in his own Name. All
flesh is grass, but the word of the Lord (that was made flesh) endures for
ever.

But I need say no more to this, the words are so plain, by Bear, to mean it,
To bear after his offering; and, By virtue of his offering, which was to that
end also offered, Christ was once offered to bear (or that he might bear) the
sins of many. Heb. 9.24.
But who are those Many? It is evident, they are such as are still found
Transgressors, and have sins daily to take away; yea, surely such work enough
they might find him: so that he might justly complain of them, That they
trouble him not with their holy Desires, Prayers, and spiritual Sacrifices for
him to persume with his Odours, and present to his Father: But they make him to
serve with their sins, Isa. 43.22, 23, 24.25. Amos 2.13.
and so weary him with their iniquities, that he is pressed with them as a Cart
is pressed with sheaves, yet he mediateth for pardon: yea, this many also, are
more than such as will be eternally saved: for it is not said, And unto them
whose sins he did bear, or those many whose sins he bears, he will appear the
second time without sin unto salvation: But expressly, Unto them that look for
him (which is a distinct expression of a peculiar, called out of a general;
which can be no other but so many of those many, whose sins he bears, as
through his graciousness are drawn to believe in him, and love him, and so look
for his coming) to such he shall appear the second time without sin unto
salvation. So that it is evident here, Compare Romans 5.12, 15, 18, 19. with Romans
3.23. 1 Timothy 2.6.
That Many in one sense, is as large as All, as is elsewhere often. But yet it
is both here, and in some other places, in great wisdom expressed in the word
Many, which will bear out All men living upon the earth, in any one age or
generation of men: And so from Age to Age, and from Generation to Generation,
from the beginning of the World to the end thereof. And Christ his interceding
for Transgressors, is at an end for them at farthest when they die: and so all
men for whom he offered his Oblation to God, not living upon this earth at
once, in one Age or Generation, his Mediation and Intercession that is by
virtue of his Oblation once offered, is for men in their several Ages: And so
for some it is past, and for some it is to come; and for the present living it
is now a doing, he is now mediating with God for men; yea, all living on earth
that are not yet blotted out of the Book of Life, and they are many, (in which
respect also it is said, Etcles. 9 4, 5. 1 Timothy 2.5. Isa. 53.12.
A living dog is better than a dead lion, because to him that is joined to the
living, there is hope:) so that by the Types we are led to mind what is found
in the Truth, according to what is plainly affirmed, even, That Jesus Christ is
the Mediator between God and Men, and that he makes Intercession for the
Transgressors; Heb. 7.
yea, and that this may more fully appear what a Mediator he is; I may also
say, as he was figured by Mechizedec, that was a Priest of the most high God,
and a King, etc. not limited to Abraham's Family, or the Israelitish Nation;
but even over the World: 1 Timothy 2.5, 6.
so in some sense Jesus Christ is a Priest over all the World, in that he
offered his Oblation for all men, and is the Mediator between God and Men in
general. And he also in suchlike sense is a Prophet for the whole World, Joh.
1.4, 5, 7, 8, 9. Act. 10.36. Mat. 28.18.
enlightening every one that comes into the World; and so likewise he is the
King, and Lord of all, in whose hands the power, and ruling, and Lordship over
all, is; God administering his Providence through the Mediator Christ: so that
there is such a Mediator between God and Men, as is both King, Priest and
Prophet; yea, such a one as has given himself a Ransom for men; yea, such a
one as is one with God, the same God; and one with men, having the Nature of
man, and so Emmanuel God with us, even the Man Christ Jesus, who is full of
Compassion, Love, Faithfulness and Power: and the prevalency of his mediation
by virtue of his Oblation, is seen in the preservation of man, and other
Creatures for man's use, and in the patience and long-sufferance of God
extended, and the means used toward them, to bring them to Repentance and
Faith, and so bringing many thereto. All which our sins against Light would
deprive us of, but for the mediation of him that takes away the sin of the
World! Oh gracious and unwearied Mediator!

And this his general Mediation is for all men, as before opened, even for the
Transgressors; and in saying for all men, Believers and Saints are included:
who are also usually called men, though not usually called the Transgressors:
yet as they are men, and do in many things offend, and so in a senfe are
Transgressors; they do both need, and have their part in this Mediation, or the
Mediation of Christ thus considered. And that Mediation which is more special
for Believers, or the Mediation of Christ, as it is more specially considered
as it is for Saints; it has in it also a great deal of tendency for the good
of the men of the world, seeing his Mediation for the Saints, and its
prevalency with God, for preserving them in the world, after they are chosen
out of it, Joh. 17.15, 20.23.
and their Sanctification, Union, Ministration, and Blessing on it, are all to
this end, and have this tendency, that the world might believe; in which
believing, they shall receive forgiveness and life. So that this Branch of the
Testimony of the Intercession of Christ thus far, is, together with his
Oblation offered, good News, true Gospel, to be preached to the World, to all
men; that they might believe, and having fitness and power to draw them, that
they might believe: it being all also true before they believe, that they might
believe; and so true, whether they believe it or not.

CHAP. 13.
Of the more special Mediation of Christ; or, his Mediation, as more specially
considered.

THe more special Mediation of Jesus Christ, is his Mediation of the New
Testament: and this also, is by virtue of his Oblation once offered; and that
to this end, That Believers may be preserved in peace, Heb. 9.
enjoy the Promises of the New Testament, and be brought to receive the
promised Inheritance. And in this respect he is, and is called, Heb. 8.2.6.
The Minister of the Sanctuary and true Tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and
not man; and so the Mediator of a better Covenant, established upon better
Promises; Heb. 12.24 Heb 9.14, 15.
his Blood being sprinkled on those that come to him, speaks peace to them,
and purges their Conscience, etc. Therefore also his Mediation is of this New
Testament, that they which are called might receive the promised Inheritance:
this Mediation being so full and excellent, his special Intercession is in it.
Whence also it is sometime called Advocation, for the fullness of his dealing in
it, in removing all Stops, procuring Grants, and affording Instructions and
Consolation, that Believers may enjoy Peace, Compare 1 John 5.7, 9. with 1 John
2.1, 2.
Freedom, Union and Fellowship with him and the Father, and be preserved in and
to their Hope. So it is said, If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He says not, If any man sin, he has an
Advocate; as if this were the common privilege of all men: nor says he only,
If any of us sin, we have an Advocate; as if we had no hope to pray for any but
Believers: but in general, If any man sin, whoever of us, or not of us, if a
man, we have an Advocate, one with the Father, known to us, and believed in by
us, to go to God by, who advocateth for us; and he is righteous, and will
procure us a gracious Answer, when we in his Name pray for our selves, or for
the Church, or any of it; yea, and also, when, according to his will, we pray
for others that are yet of the world: for he is also the Propitiation for our
sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world: so, as
by his Oblation, having made peace for Mankind, and being now the Mercy-Seat
of God, and the Propitiation to propitiate; and mediating with God for that
end, whereby he has propitiated us, and brought us in to believe in God, and
is also become our Advocate, Joh. 10.9. and 14.6. and 16.23. Ephesians. 2.18. Heb.
10.18, 19 and 7.17.24, 25.
that we may approach to God by him, both for our selves and for others; in
which confidence Believers approach through Christ with boldness to the Throne
of Grace, having this Ground, Because he continuing ever, remains a Priest
for ever, having an unchangeable Priesthood, Heb. 7.25. wherefore he is able to
save them to the utmost (or evermore) that come unto God by him, seeing he ever
lives to make Intercession for them: from whence I shall briefly observe a few
things about this special Mediation or Intercession of Jesus Christ, as by
other places also I have instruction, 1. That here is no denial or exclusion of
his Mediation for all Men, and Intercession for Transgressors, as if those only
that approach to God by him, were the All, the only and the whole number, for
whom he does in any sort mediate and intercede. He neither says, But them, or
only them; not a word to contradict that affirmed in other places; nor does he
here speak of his Mediation and Intercession for men, for that to be vouchsafed
them, whereby they might believe, and so approach to God through him; but of
his Mediation and Intercession for those that do already believe, and approach
to God by him; and so are beheld believing, and coming in to God by him; who
are indeed God's chosen 1 Pet. 1.2. and 2.3, 4, 5. 2 These. 2.13.
: and those to whom Christ is the Author of Eternal Salvation Heb. 5.9.
, to whom he is to give, and has promised to give, Eternal Life Joh. 6.37-40.
and 17.3. and 11.25, 26.
. And so Emphatically it is said of them, as the choice upon whom his eye is
set, He ever lives to make Intercession for them; for them directly, for them
especially. 2. That he ever lives to intercede for them, that is, to officiate
and perform this business in Heaven for them: every word is of force: 1. He
ever lives, as their Great High Priest, Heb. 7.23, 24. Romans 6.9, 10. Rev.
1.18. and 2.8. Psalm. 120. Joh. 6.37-40.
appearing in Heaven for them in their Nature, and as their Head, Husband,
elder Brother and Keeper (he died once for them, and rose, and offered the
Oblation once) but now he is alive for evermore, and can die no more, but
lives ever; so as there can be no let nor ceasing of his business: he neither
slumbereth nor sleeps; so that none shall or can perish through any defect in
his Ministration. 2. He ever lives as the Son of God, Joh. 11.42. and 14.16.
Psa. 20.3, 4. Joh. 17.24.
and the Man in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, beloved of the
Father, and prevalent with him; so, as the Father denies him nothing: his
suites are all, and always granted; so, that with him it is but, I will, and it
is done. 3. He ever lives, as the living Object of Faith, Heb. 12.2. Joh.
5.25. 1 Pet. 2.3, 4, 5. 1 Cor. 15.44, 45. Joh. 7.37, 38. Joh. 14.19. Romans 5.10.
the Author and Finisher of it, that has Life in himself, and gives Life to
others; the quickening Spirit, that quickneth and enliveneth all that believe on
him: and because he ever lives, they that believe on him shall live also: his
ever living, is a strong consolation to Believers: For if when we were enemies,
we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled
to God, we shall be saved by his lise, or ever living to intercede for us; and
so to quicken and preserve us.
3. That he ever lives to make Intercession for them: I might say in a sense,
Joh. 14.16. and 17.24. Psalm. 20. and 65.4. Mat. 7.11. Luke 11.13.
to pray the Father for them, though not in that submissive manner, as when he
was on Earth, before he had offered the Oblation, with tears and cries; but, as
one accepted having Power, and Authority, and oneness with the Father, with I
will, etc. That they be one with us, and filled with Spirit, even all the good
things of thy holy Temple; that their Prayers be answered: and he is answered.
But I will instance in some particulars, as well as by Scripture I may. 1. By
virtue of his Blood presented to his Father, and sprinkled (in the spiritual
documents of it, 1 John 1.7, 9. and 2.1, 2. Phil. 4.7. Romans 5.1, 2.
believed, Isa. 52.15. Romans 15.20, 21.) upon their hearts, to bring them to see
and acknowledge their present and daily infirmities, defilements and offenses;
and by the virtue of his Blood, to dispense to them forgiveness and cleansing:
and so maintain that Peace of God in them, that shall keep their hearts through
him. 2. Heb. 6.20. and 9.24. 1 Cor. 1.30-31.
By presenting himself for them, Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and
Redemption; and so presenting them before the Father in himself, wise,
righteous, holy, free. 3. Joh. 14.21, 23. Heb. 9.13, 14. and 10.14. Col. 1.22,
23. Ephesians. 5.25, 26, 27.
By procuring of the Father such Manifestations, by his Spirit in the Gospel,
of the virtues of his Sufferings and Sacrifice for them, and his Father's Love
there-through to them, as thereby both to comfort and purify them: so, as in
due season he may present them as spotless to himself, as now he presents them
in himself before the Father. 4. Heb. 9.15. and 8.2, 6, 10. Romans 8.23. Joh.
14.16, 17, 18, 26. and 15.26, 27. Act. 5.31, 32. Joh. 16.13, 14, 15. 1 Pet.
2.7. 2 Cor. 3.3, 13. Heb. 3.10, 11.
By procuring for them a performance of the promises of the New Testament, in
sending forth the holy Spirit in a first fruits to them, according to his
promise to be an Advocate and Comforter in and to them, and so to mind them
of, and teach them the understanding of his sayings, and to witness of him to
them, and through them to others, to take of the things of Christ, and show to
them, and thereby glorifying him to them, and making him precious to their
hearts; and so guiding them into all Truth, so writing his mind in their
hearts, Romans 16.20. 1 John 4.4. and 5.4, 5. Romans 5.1-3. and 8.14, 15, 16. Gal.
5.22. Phil. 1.9, 10. 1 Pet. 2.5. Ioh. 7.38, 39. Romans 8.26. Ezekiel. 36.37. 2 Samuel
7.27.
and to subdue their sinful and fleshly lusts, Micah 7.19. Romans 8.13. Gal.
5.16, 18. and to answer their opposers, Mat. 10.20. and to support them in
troubles, Isa. 43.3. Joh. 16.33. to be treading, and so to tread Satan under
their feet in due season, and to give them victory over all the evil Spirits
and Temptations that are in the World, and to shed abroad his Love in their
hearts, and so fill them with peace, joy, hope, and all spiritual springs of
his goodness, and fruits of righteousness; and because of their ignorance and
unworthiness of, and inability to reach to or receive these things, to lead,
instruct, and move them to pray unto God for all these things promised, in the
Name of Christ, Joh. 16.23, 24. Zach. 12.10. 5. To perfume their Prayers,
Praises and Services, Rev. 8.3. Joh. 14.16. and 16.22. 1 Pet. 2.5, 6, 7, 9.
with the Odours and sweet smelling Virtues of his Death and Sacrifice; and so
by his Intercession thereby, to expel from before his Father's Throne, those
mixtures of their fleshly weakness that were in them, and make their suits
acceptable to his Father, and so procure them Answers from God. 6. To procure
their preservation for their Generation, Joh. 17.9.13. 2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 20. 1
Cor. 3.5, 6, 7. and 4.1. Phil. 2.14, 15. Ephesians. 4.7, 8-12-16. Joh. 15.5, 8, 16. 1
Pet. 1.8.
to be in his place in the World, for the Ministration of the Gospel, and
holding forth the word of Life to the World, and edifying one another; and
likewise for unity of Spirit among them, and Sanctification and Blessing of
them and their Ministration, that so the World might be brought to believe, and
Believers may grow up together into Christ, by that which every joint
supplieth, that so they may not be barren, but fruitful in the knowledge of
Christ. 7. To prepare for them heavenly Mansions, Joh. 14 2, 3. 1 Pet. 1.4, 5.
and them for the enjoyment of them: and so to preserve them through Faith to
the possession of the promised Inheritance.



All this does he make Intercession for, for all those that come to God by him:
and this a brief or little mention of his business he is now doing in heaven,
in making Intercession for Believers.

And because of his sending forth his Spirit into their hearts, by which he is
present with them, and in them, as in his Body; also he appears in heaven
before the Father for them. Joh. 14.16, 17, 18.
Hence that blessed and Holy Spirit of Christ bears his Name, being called
their Advocate, Romans 8.26, 27.
and Christ by him doing that work in them, he is said to do it, even to make
Intercession for the Saints: so that this making Intercession for the Saints,
in his Mediation of the New Testament, dealing both with God and with them, for
them and in them, is an high, heavenly, choice and peculiar business. And
surely, all that come to God by Christ, believing this, it will fill them with
strong consolation, and make them pray with assurance of Faith, knowing he ever
lives to make Intercession for them that come to God by him. And therefore

4. That he is able to save to the utmost them that come to God by him; which
as it is plainly affirmed, so I hope none of us doubts: therefore I will no
farther instance proofs; only let that be remembered, 1 Timothy 2.4, 5, 6.
which has been before noted, That though the Death and Ransom by Christ
given, was for all men, and so his Mediation in general for all men, that they
might be preserved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth, for which he is
able also; yet the utmost and Eternal Salvation and Inheritance purchased by
his Oblation, was and is to be conferred on Believers: not on all he died for,
or mediateth for; not on such, when through his mediation, the heavenly cords
are let down, Psa. 2.3, 4, 5. 2 These. 1.8. and 2.8, 10, 12.
will not obey, in suffering themselves to be drawn to him; Sure it is, there
is another portion justly designed for such: but to those that by his heavenly
cords are drawn to him; Heb. 5.9. Joh. 1.12.
and so believing, come to God by him, to these he gives Eternal Life, Eternal
Salvation: and for these Believers that approach to God by him, he makes his
special Intercession and Advocation: and seeing he ever lives to do this for
them, he is able, powerful, faithful, true, ready, fit, doing it at all times
evermore, to save them to the utmost: and this Mediation of Jesus Christ by
virtue of his Oblation, both as in general for all men, and as in special for
Believers, is a marvelous heavenly cord to draw to Faith, and stablish in the
Faith.

CHAP. 14.
Of the Excellency and Prevalency of the Mediation and Intercession of Jesus
Christ.

Jesus Christ that is the Mediator between God and men, who also ever lives to
make Intercession for those that come to God by him;

He it is, that by his Oblation has bought us of God, and obtained an Eternal
Redemption to bestow.

He it is, that is filled with all fullness of Spirit, Power, and Authority, to
make known the Name and Love of the Father, and draw to him; and in their
coming to him, to confer Redemption on them.

He it is, that is the merciful High Priest acquainted with our infirmities and
temptations, so knowing how to pity and help us in all our needs.

He it is, that is our Kinsman nearly related to us, being in our Nature, and
having bought all Mankind of God, into his dispose; and also bought Believers
to himself, and so unto God, by the virtues of his Blood in Gospel made known,
and applied to them; And so our Brother, making us Partakers of the Divine
Nature, makes us his own House, and so full of Love, Faithfulness and
Prevalency by his Blood for us and in us.

He it is, that is the Accepted and Beloved of the Father, ever prevalent with
him, and exalted and filled with all power by him: so, as whatever the Father
does, he does the same.

Yea, he is that tried one, that having been tried and proved, Isa. 23.16.
is evidenced to be precious, and sure, failing none that trust in him; his
Love, pity, mercy, faithfulness, have been tried, Isa. 50.5, 6. Romans 5.6, 8.
and proved exceeding great and durable, in his not shrinking back, but
enduring and going through so great Sufferings and Abasements for sinners, etc.
his power and all sufficiency has been tried, and proved mighty, in that he
not only bare the weight of our sins, the terror and sentence of death, the
wrath of God against our sins, Act. 2.24. Romans 1.4. Col. 2.14, 15.
when all was laid on him, and all the powers of Hell fighting against him; but
that he by suffering and death, appeased the wrath of the Father for us, made
Atonement for our sins, and overcame curse, and death, and devil, and all the
powers of hell, and arose from the dead, and ascended to the right hand of God.

His prevalency with the Father in and by his Sacrifice offered to God, and the
excellency of his Sacrifice is tried, and proved precious and prevalent, Joh.
16.10. Psa. 110.1. Act. 2. Mat. 17.5. 2 Pet. 1.16, 17.
in that the Father has received him, and sends him forth no more to suffer,
but has set him at his right hand, and made him Lord of all, and born witness
of him.

His bounty, Romans 3.10, 19, 20, 25. Act. 14.17. Romans 2.4. 1 Timothy 1.15, 17. Isa.
42.1-10. and 45.21-23. Prove. 1.22, 23. and 9.4, 5, 6. Joh. 6.33, 37.
goodness and readiness farther to save men, and therein the prevalency of his
Mediation for men, even transgressors, is also tried, and found excellent and
abundant, in and by his long sufferance, and enduring men's ill requitals; his
still upholding the earth, and extending mercies to men, to lead them to
repentance; his calling and drawing in to believe, and so saving the chief of
sinners, and setting them forth as a pattern to encourage others to believe in
him. In a word, his calling all, even the worst of men, and refusing none that
come to him: but has saved, and does save, being the Savior of the world, and
giving life to the world.

His peculiar Mediation and Intercession for Believers, Romans 1.16 1 Cor. 1.18,
24. 1 These. 2.13. Rev. 5.9. 1 Pet. 1.4. Phil. 3.7, 8, 9. Romans 7.25. and 8.2.
Romans 5.1-5. Ephesians. 2.18. 1 John 4.4. and 5.4, 5. 2 Cor. 1.9, 10. 2 Timothy 4.17, 18.
Col. 3.4. Isa. 43.10, 11, 12. Joh. 3.33.
his chosen, that do come to God by him, has also been tried, and found
exceeding sweet, precious and prevalent, in and by Believers that approach to
God by him, in the saving efficacies of his word believed by them: the
prevalency of his Blood sprinkled on their hearts in that word believed,
pulling them out from the snares and pollutions of the world to God; his Grace
therein appearing, prevaling with them, to let all go, to be found in Christ:
and so freeing them from the lordly dominion of sin, and bondage of the Law;
and so filling them with the springs of peace, boldness of access to God, joy,
hope, etc. making them partakers of the Divine Nature, and giving them victory
over the world: also, in Answers of their Prayers, and Deliverances out of
great Deaths; yea, in sure hope of appearing in Glory with him, when he appears
in Glory. These and many suchlike Evidences have Believers, of the Excellency
and Prevalency of his Intercession for them by virtue of his Oblation; in and
through which, they also are his Witnesses.

So, that as all hearing the Gospel might be encouraged hereby to repent and
believe in him; so Believers much more may be strengthened, and fully
persuaded, That he is willing and able evermore, and to the utmost, to save
them that come to God by him.

And now if both these be put together, and considered, in the Mediation and
Intercession of Christ; his Mediation and Intercession, as it is in general
between God and Men, and so for all Men; for Transgressors, for means to
preserve them, and bring them in to believe; and so also for Believers, as they
are Men, and in some sort Transgressors also, that they may still receive the
benefit thereof: and also, as it is in special, and of the New Testament, for
them that are called, and come to God by him, that they may receive the
promised Inheritance. And this also having its tendency for the good of the
World, Men, Transgressors, that through the virtues of Christ held forth by
Believers, they might be brought to Repentance and Faith, and so to fellowship
with Believers in these foresaid Privileges; then surely we may discern both
the Excellency of his Mediation, and also of his Oblation, by virtue whereof he
mediateth; and how the efficacy of both go ever together in one to Man-ward; he
procuring all of his Father for Men in his Intercession, by virtue of his
Oblation; and from the Prevalency of his Intercession with God, working all in
Men in his dispensation, by and with the virtue of his Oblation.

And yet here is a manifest difference in respect of the efficacy of his
Oblation with God for Men, and of his Intercession with God toward and in Men,
in offering the Oblation to God: the efficacy of the Oblation with God, was
first; and by virtue thereof, he became a Mediator between God and Men, and so
for Men: and this Oblation is always remaining in its virtue and efficacy
before God, and with him; from whence he mediateth with God: but now in
Application to Men, in extension of the Fruits and efficacies to, and in Men,
as to Men's discerning and enjoying, the vertne and efficacy of the Mediation
and Intercession is first: though the Mediation be by virtue of the Oblation
first offered to God, yet the Mediation fore-running the making of it known,
and being that which procures the making known the Oblation and virtue of it
unto Men; and also, it is through his Intercession and Dispensation according
thereto, that the efficaciousness of the Oblation is found in Men, yet the
efficacy with and in Men, is various, and in and with no mortal Man, so full
and complete, as with God; and this appears clearly in the Mediation and
Intercession of Christ, who there-through prevailing with God, procures and
extends forth the knowledge of his Oblation, and virtue thereof with God for
Men, in all that he has suffered and done for us in the Nature of Man, and in
the means used toward us in the Declaration of his Word, and in Ordinances,
Mercies, Chastisements, and Motions of Spirit, in Convincements and
Allurements, to break Man off his purpose, and subdue him to self-denial, and
so bring him in to believe on Christ, and so to Peace and Life; and also herein
discovering the Father's Love, and rich Grace, and gracious Ends, in giving
him, and accepting his Oblation, and making him the Mediator; and now for his
Mediation, extending so much patience and so many means, all sanctified by his
Blood, to draw Men from their own ovil designs and ways in sins, or
righteousness of their own, to receive his Grace and Favor.

And in this Fruit of his Intercession by virtue of his Oblation, he being the
Man, the Word that was made Flesh, and shed his Blood, and by virtue thereof,
is now through these means sprinkling it; and his Father being that Fountain of
Love and living Waters, that sent him, and has filled him with himself, his
Face shining in his: It in all appears, not only that his Mediation and
Intecession is excellent, but also, That this Love of the Father in giving him,
and his Oblation offered, and Mediation by virtue thereof, and the procuring
the extention of the Fruits of God's Love therethrough, is, the Water and Blood
by which he came, and the way in which the Spirit bears witness of him: and
so also the Water and Spirit, of which Believers are born. And hence also it
is, That all those means extended to Men in the Love of God, as procured by the
Intercession of Christ by virtue of his Oblation to so gracious an end; they
are the Cords of a Man, proceeding from the Man Christ, and suited to the needs
and capacities of Men to whom extended, Hos. 11.3, 4. With Isa. 32.2, 3. and
Joh 33.1-7, 13-29.
and such as will verily draw Men in to him, if not presumptuously resisted:
and they are also the bands of Love, that come from the free-Love of God our
Savior, and to gracious Ends, for the good of them to whom extended: in these
being the extention of the Call, the spreading of the Curtains, the means for
the New Birth. All which things in this Chapter, are shown and proved before,
in the 6, and 7, and 8, and 9, and 10 Chapter of this Part 2. Oh presumptuous
Transgressors, that conspire against the Lord and his anointed, saying, Psa.
2.3, 4.
Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us! Ah
foolish and brutish Pastors, that do disgrace these Cords, Jer. 10.20, 21.
Cant. 1.3. Joh. 6.44, 45. Col. 3.19. Psa. 118.17. and 86.11, 12.
and spoil the Church of them! Oh blessed they, that in these drawings, learn
of the Father, and come to Christ; for such shall then find the benefit of his
special Intercession in the same Cords of a Man, and Bands of Love, to unite
them to Christ, and so to God in Christ for ever, and so conforming them to
Christ, and consolating them in him. And so, if we well weigh the Mediation and
Intercession of Christ by virtue of his Oblation, Job. 1.29. 1 Timothy 2.5. Heb.
9.15.
we may perceive how all things are upheld by him, and how excellent and
prevalent his Mediation is, for the good of Men, that they might become
Believers and Saints; and for the good of Saints, that they may enjoy the
Promises, and receive the promised Inheritance. And so the Mediation of Christ,
is for such as are yet unbelievers, that they might believe; and for Believers,
that they may persevere in Faith to the Inheritance: and by the Grace
here-through extended, He is Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End in the
work of Grace; and so the Author, Captain, and Finisher of Faith: and so, he
mediating for all Men, does also therein and therewith more especially mediate
and intercede for Believers, his chosen ones that go to God by him.

CHAP. 15.
An Answer to some Aspersions cast on the Professors of this Truth.

I Having in a former Treatise written, That God so loved the world, that he
gave and sent forth his Son to be the Savior of the world; and, That he sends
forth his Servants to bear witness of his Son, that all men through him might
believe: And quoting to the later Sentence, Joh. 1.7. and 17.21, 23. Mr. Owen
was pleased to fault me for giving this Honor to Christ, that any should by
him believe; and to fault my quotation of Joh. 1.7. thereto: and says, It is
my Sophistry learned of the old Serpent, thus to apply this to the Son of God,
the Light witnessed to: and says, We are said to believe in Christ, and on
Christ, but not by him.

1. I answer, To take that Joh. 1.7. That John was sent forth from God, and
came to bear witness of the light, that all men through him (that is, Joh.
3.26, 27, 30, 31, 32-36. and 5.35, 36 Act. 1.5, 22. and 10.41, 42. and 18.26,
28.
through John) might believe, (and not through the light witnessed by John)
would be a very small All, when a witnessing-Light of that true Light, so
out-shining the Light of John's Ministration, came in so suddenly upon it,
though witnessing still to the same Light that John's Ministration is over. And
if Mr. Owen feared any disgrace to the Servants Ministration, and so to himself
hereby; it was a causless fear, and not occasioned by this quotation of the
place, which denies not at all, John to be the Minister by whom all those, to
whom his Line reached, that believed, did believe, even as the Apostles were
Ministers, by whom the Believers in their Ministration, were brought to
believe: they ministered the Epistle, and held forth and witness Christ the
Light therein; Joh. 3.14, 15.
and for any farther thing, they disclaim it: and for that cause, witnessed of
him, and held forth and exalted him, that men beholding him might through him
believe, and be healed. But the believing of any, Joh. 6.40. 1 Cor. 3.4, 5, 6.
and 4.1. 2 Cor. 3.3, 18, Joh. 3.26-36. Mat. 23.8, 9, 10. 2 Cor. 4.5, 6, 7. Isa.
42.1-10. Act. 5.31.
was from hearing and beholding Christ the Son; and so, as the Lord gave to
every man, and by his Spirit writ his Epistle in their heart. If any desire
farther honor to himself, John disowns it, Christ forbids it, the Apostles
disclaim it: so no wrong done in the quotation: yet for giving this Honor to
Christ, as that glorious Object, by virtue of his Oblation, and by virtue of
his Intercession also, thereby such a full flowing Fountain of Life, and
Prince, giving Repentance and Remission of sins, that through him discovered,
and by him the Beholders of him are brought to believe; I am not only blamed,
but charged to learn this of the old Serpent.

2. I answer, I have learned to give this Honor to Christ from God the Father,
that says, Isa. 42.1, 2, 7. and 49.7, 9. and 55.4, 5. Isa. 61.1, 2, 3, 4. Joh.
5.19, 20, 25, 27. Ephesians. 2.8. Col. 2.12. Act. 5.31. Isa. 55.4, 5, 6. 1 Cor. 3.4,
5, 6.
He has put his Spirit on Christ for that end, That he should call, and open
the eyes of the blind, and cause such as foreknew him not, to come in to him.
I have learned from Jesus Christ, That he was anointed and filled with Spirit
to that end; and, That the Father and he are one; and, That the Father does
nothing, but the Son does the same: And this honor the Father has given to
the Son, That all men should honor the Son, as they honor the Father; and,
Faith being the Gife of God, and the Operation of God, it is verily, The Gift
of Christ and the Operation of Christ; yea, He is Author and finisher, Alpha
and Omega, in this work also: yea, I have learned it from the Holy Spirit, both
in the Testimony born by the Prophets and Apostles; and for a plain express
Answer.

3. I am learned by the Spirit in the Gospel, not only, Tobelieve in Christ and
on Christ, as Mr. Owen says; but also, as the Medium of both, In the Name and
on the Name of Christ; yea, and also, in express words, That all that rightly
believe, it is by Christ, 1 Pet. 1.20. Who verily was foreordained, before the
foundation of the world; but was manifested in these last times for you. Verse.
21. Who by him do believe in God that raised him from the dead, and gave him
glory, that your faith and hope might be in God. So that to give this Honor to
Christ, and his Oblation and Intercession, That it is by him that men believe
in God, 1 Cor. 12.2.
and so to confess him Lord, is by the Holy Ghost; though many dare say, It Is
from the Serpent, because it exalts not them in the place of Christ as Rabbis.
But enough of this: nor will I take notice here to answer any more such stuff
in that Book of Mr. Owen's, it having been fairly answered by a learned and
godly Brother. But in his pretended Answer to Mr. John Goodwin, the Book I
minded that occasioned this Discourse, he says, Page 217. Sect. 3.
That Christ interceded for his Elect, for whom he died, that they may believe;
which, he says, is denied by those he opposes; which, both Saying and
Aspersion, he might have forborne: for those he opposes do hold as firmly as
himself, and more clearly, according to the Scriptures, That Christ intercedeth
in a peculiar and special manner, for his Elect and chosen Ones that approach
to God by him; yea, even for Believing and Faith, in that sense that Believing
is taken for, abiding Believing, and more firmly Believing; and for Faith, as
Faith is taken for Confirmation and Perseverance in the Faith, 1 John 5.13.
as is shown in this fore-written: Yea, more than Mr. Owen can yet be brought
to confess, even, That Christ in act or undertaking, died for them before they
were elect; and, That there was not any in him, to lay aside the Heavenly
Glory, and die, and rise, and offer the Oblation in him, and so to be the
Mediator in and with him; for then there would not have been that room for
Imputation or Application to them, nor could deserved Grace have been so freely
bestowed. But he did all this alone, and in that respect is the Root and
Fountain of Election also: so, that the Elect are beholding to the Oblation and
Intercession of Christ, for Election, as well as for Faith: yea, and they
believe, That Christ interceded for these men also that they might believe: but
that was before they were personally Elect; and so then not for them, as they
were Elect, which then was not, nor were they such; but as they were Men of the
World, and Transgressors, that means might be extended to them, and they so
brought to believe; 2 These. 2.13.
and in this believing of the Truth, chosen through the Sanctification of the
Spirit; which is God's Way. And so Election in some sense, a Fruit of Faith;
but Faith in the beginning of it, and first coming into it, is not in a proper
sense a Fruit of Election: yea, furely we believe, That all the Elect are a
holy and peculiar people, 2 Pet. 2.5, 9.
called out of Darkness into his marvelous Light, and all of them that yet live
on this Earth, to show forth his Praises now, as those for whom he especially
intercedeth, That they may be kept, Psa. 102.17, 23.
that when all the Just shall be raised, we may all more fully show forth his
Praises together: but we dare not entertain vain fancies and dreams, to vent
them among the Rebellious, as if some of them, might even now, while
Rebellious, be God's Elect, for ought any man knows; because the plain
Sayings of Scripture are against this, as has been plentifully shown; and for
that which we believe also, and so for the Mediation of Christ, in general, for
all men; and more especially, for Believers, already showed.

The third Branch of the Testimony of Christ.
CHAP. 16
Of the coming again of Christ, and the manner thereof.

FOr the coming again of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, it being one part
of the Testimony of Christ, it is needful also, to be known and believed; it
being also of the very Object of Faith, set forth in the Gospel to be believed;
so, as without believing it, no Man's Faith is complete and entire, in respect
of the Object of Faith, or Doctrine of the Gospel to be believed: yet before I
proceed in treating of it, it is good to consider what manner of coming it is,
that is here spoken of, because diverse comings are spoken of in the Scripture,
though never but of two personal and bodily comings:

The first called, His coming in the Flesh, in Abasements to suffer, and
overcome in sufferings, and so to offer the acceptable Sacrifice; and so to
make the Atonement, obtain Redemption, receive Spirit in the Man, and sit on
the right hand of God, as the Mediator and great High Priest, and Prophet, and
King, to send forth Spirit to Men, of which is spoken in many places Deuteronomy.
18.18. Psalm. 16.10. and 40.6-9. Isa. 53. 1-10. Zach. 9.9. Psa. 68.18.
: and so he is already come, and has compleared that Work done in his own
Body, and can die no more, nor will offer any other or more Sacrifice, but
lives for ever in that glorious Body once offered in Sacrifice; remaining
still a continual Mediator and High Priest by virtue of that Oblation: 1 John
4.3. 2 John 7. 1 John 42.
and he that denies, and confesses not this, and does not in the belief
thereof, worship God, is led by the Spirit of Antichrist. The true Spirit
confesses this. And of this coming is spoken in the former two Heads of his
Oblation and Mediation, by virtue of his Oblation; all his stretching forth his
power in providential Comings, in Mercies and Judgments, and in gracious
Visitations or spiritual Comings, are the effects and fruits of his Oblation
and Intercession in his Administration in his bodily Absence.

But the second and next personal and bodily coming of Christ, is in Glory, and
to take unto him his great Power and Reign, and to receive to himself, to reign
with him, all that have believed on him, and suffered with him Col. 3.4. Rev.
11.17, 18.
. And this is the coming again of Christ, which is here to be treated of in
this Head: and this his personal coming in Glory, is that which was also spoken
of by the Prophets Zachary, The Lord my God shall come, and all the Saints with
thee Zach. 14.1-5.
: Malachi, The Son of Righteousness shall arise, with healing, etc. Mal. 4.1, 2.
: Isaiah, of the increase of his Government, and Peace, no end; upon the Throne
of David, and upon his Kingdom, etc. Isa. 9.7.
. And upon the first coming of Christ, even before he had actually offered his
Oblation, this was declared in his personal Ministration by himself, both to
his Disciples, saying, For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his
Father, with his Angels Mat. 16.27.
; and, they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of Heaven, with Power
and great Glory Mat. 24.30. Mar. 13.26. Luke 21.26.
; and, I will come again, and receive you to my self, etc Joh. 14.3.
. And also to his Crucifiers, Hereafter ye shall see the Son of man sitting on
the right hard of Power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven Mat. 25.64. Mar.
14.62. Luke 22.69.
. And so it was likewise declared by the Angel, The Lord God shall give unto
him the Throne of his Father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob,
etc. Luke 1.32, 33.
. And again, upon his Ascension the Angel said, This same Jesus, which is taken
up from you into Heaven, shall so come in like manner, as ye have seen him go
into Heaven Act. 1.11.
. And the same has been also taught by the Apostles: And he shall send Jesus
Christ, etc. Act. 3.20, 21.
. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, etc. 1 These.
4.16.
. Unto them that look for him, he shall appear the second time, without sin
unto Salvation Heb. 9.28.
. And this is testified, to be the Promise of Christ, and the Desire of those
led by the Spirit of Christ Rev. 22.20.
. Whence all unfeigned Believers are said to wait for his coming 1 Cor. 1.7.
Phil. 3.20, 21. 1 These. 1.10.
. And the Crown of Righteousness to be given at that day to them that love his
appearing 2 Timothy 4.8.
.

And concerning this his next personal coming, there is declared in the Gospel
and Testimony of Christ these three things: First, The manner of his coming.
Secondly, The Ends of his coming. Thirdly, The Time (though not the day and
hour) of his coming. Let us consider what the Scripture says of each of these;
and first of the first point, The manner of his coming: It is expressly said,

1. It will be sudden, in an hour not known before he come, Mat. 24.27, 44.
Mar. 13.36. 1 These. 5.2, 3. Rev. 16.15. 1 Cor. 15.52.
even to his own; and, as a snare to all the Inhabitants of the World: in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, as a flash of lightning.

2. It will be visible, openly, and discernable to every eye; yea, all the
Believers, those that are asleep, Mat. 24.30. Mar. 13.26. Luke 21.27. Rev. 1.7.
Mat. 24.27.
and those that are at that time living on the earth, not one before another,
but them that are asleep being first raised, then all at once together shall
see him, 1 Thessalonians. 4.15. yea, every eye, and all the kindreds of the earth shall
see him; it will be as visible as the lightning that shines from the East to
the West.

3. It will be with Power and great Glory, 2 These. 1.7. Zach. 4.5.
his mighty Angels, and all his Saints meeting, and coming together with him.

And in such a sudden, visible, and glorious manner will Christ come.

CHAP. 17.
Of the second Point, The Ends of the coming of Christ.

THe Ends of the next coming of Jesus Christ, is for the fulfilling his Word
and Promise in doing those things he has said, and that are testified of him
to be then done by him; which I may comprehend in the naming, under these four
Heads: that is to say,

1. To raise the Just that sleep in the Lord, and change, and make immortal the
surviving Believers that have suffered with him; 1 These. 4.14, 15, 16.
this is affirmed, as necessarily included in the belief of all that do indeed
believe Jesus to have died and rose again: if we believe this, then this also,
That even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him: For this
we say unto you by the word of the Lord, That we which are alive, and remain
unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep; for the
Lord himself shall descend, etc. And the dead in Christ shall rise first, (that
is, before we which live shall see him) then we which are alive and remain,
shall be caught up, etc. being in the very moment of their raising, 1 Cor.
15.52, 53. 1 Cor. 15.23, 24.
changed: and for the Resurrection, it is said, Every man in his own order,
Christ the first Fruits, (that was in his personal Resurrection, who is now
ascended) afterward, those that are Christ's at his coming. (And then speaking
of another Time, he says,) Then the End, (when, or then comes the End; and
when is that End?) when he shall have delivered up, etc.

As it is given out with an Oath, That there should be Time no longer, Rev.
10.6, 7. Rev. 8.2, 6 Rev. 11.15. 1 Cor. 15.24, 25.
but in the days of the voice^ of the seventh Angel: which Angel is to found
the last Trumpet, which begins in Christ his beginning to Reign, and ends
in Christ his delivering up the Kingdom even to God the Father, that God may be
All in All; and so the Government not Dividical, but wholly Divine; yet the
Kingdom without end: So that ^he beginning of this Day is in the entrance or
beginning of Christ his coming to Reign, and to sit upon the Throne of David
his Father; and the end of this last and great Day, is after the Resurrection
and Condemnation of all the wicked, when will be the last and utter destruction
of Death, 26, 28.
in delivering up the Kingdom to the Father, that the David^cal Regiment may be
translated into that which is wholly and altogether Divine. And that this
Resurrection done by God, yet he doing it by the Man Christ, (as he will in
that Day judge all men by him) our Savior Christ himself teaches, speaking of
himself as the Son of Man, saying, Romans 2.16. Joh. 5.26, 27, 28.
The hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
and shall come forth: they that have done good, to the resurrection os life;
and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation. Agreeable to
which, is that Confession of Faith, That there shall be a resurrection of the
dead, Act. 24.15. Isa. 26.19. 1 These. 4.14. Luke 14.14. Joh. 5.24.
both of the just and the unjust. And the Resurrection of those that are by
Faith united to Jesus; and dying in the Faith, sleep in Jesus; is called the
Resurrection of the Just, in which, Rewards are to be given them. And though
both Resurrection of Just and Unjust, shall be in this last and great Day, yet
this Resurrection of the Just, being at Christ his coming, in the beginning of
that great Day: and of those that have believed on Christ, and suffered with
him in the Days of his patience, who are to live and reign with him in the
Davidical Regiment, till the wicked be raised out of Death, and judged, and
cast into the lake of fire; which is at the end of this last and great Day, and
of all Time; when also the Kingdom is delivered to the Father. The Resurrection
of the Just is therefore called, The first Resurrection: Rev. 20.5, 6.
which work our Savior affirms to be the will of our Father, that he should
do, and that he will do; showing the Father's will in general, he says, This
is the Fathers will, etc. Joh. 6.39.
That of all which he has given me, (and that is, all men into his dispose, by
virtue of his Oblation) I should lose nothing, (as is before shown, and will be
more after: he loses none: if any perversely lose himself, yet he is to judge
him; and therefore it is said,) but should raise it up again at the last day.
And then speaking of the Father's special will, he says, And this is the will
of him that sent me, That every one which sees the Son, and believes on him,
may have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day. Which he
speaks more particularly and emphatically, as the first and choice, having not
proceeded in the other to suchlike affirmation, for that reason given, Joh.
12.47, 48. So that this next coming of Christ, is first in the beginning of the
last Day, to raise and cloth with immortality all his Saints, which will be
done in a moment, the same moment he is descending from Heaven; that so they
meeting him in the Air, may come along with him to the next work, as is
affirmed they shall: which next work is also plainly affirmed to be,

2. To overthrow all the Powers and Governments of the World that now is, that
are upon this Earth; and so it is said, 1 Cor. 15.24.
He shall put down all rule, and all authority and power. The Persons ruling,
if any of them Saints, will be taken into that Company, Dan. 7.12. Isa. 60.12.
and be changed, and go with him: if not, if they at first submit to serve him
and his people, their lives shall be prolonged, though their Dominion be taken
away: but all the wicked that rebel against him in that Day, (in which no more
space of Repentance given, for the the Lord will make a short work on Earth)
shall be destroyed and burned up, Romans 9.28. Mal. 4.1. Jude 14, 15. 2 Pet. 3.7,
10. 2 These. 1.8, 9. Isa. 9.4, 5, 6. and 11.4. Psa. 72.4.
both Root and Branch; whence it is called, The Day of Judgment, Destruction,
and Perdition of ungodly Men, which shall be with flaming Fire. For this Battle
shall not be like the former Battles on the Earth, with confused noise, and
Garments rolled in Blood; but with burning and fuel of Fire: for he shall
smite the Earth with the Rod of his Mouth, and with the Breath of his Lips
shall he slay the wicked, and break in pieces the Oppressor: He has long left
the Government of the Affairs of this World in the Hands of Men, Psalm. 82.1, 2,
3, 4. and 2.10, 11.
whom he called Mighty, or Gods, and bade them judge righteously, that it might
be well with them in their account to him: and he has often changed the
Governors and manner of Government, and waired with patience to see if they
would do right; but he sees, That (though he has given them warning, Psalm.
75.4, 5, 6, 7. Psalm. 82.5.
yet ^ they know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness,
all the foundations (or Governments) of the earth are out of course, (even
moved.) Isa. 59.16. and 50.2, 3.
And he saw, and there was no man, (no Government) he wondered there was no
intercessor, therefore his Arm brought salvation to him, and his righteousness
it sustained him; and he dried up the Sea. etc. And says to them, Ye shall die
like men, and fall like one of the Princes. (And then it follows,) Arise, O
God, Psalm. 82.7, 8. Isa. 13.6, 7.11.
judge the earth: for thou shall inherit all Nations. And thus will he come in
that Day to destroy sinners out of the Land, to punish the World for their
evil, and the wicked for their iniquity, and to cause the arrogance of the
proud to cease, and lay low the haughtiness of the terrible; yea, Isa. 13.13.
Heb. 12.26. Hag. 2.6. Zach. 13.2-6. Rev. 19.20. 1 Cor. 13.8, 9-12. Jer. 31.34.
2 These. 1.7, 8 Mat. 13.41.
so great will this shaking be, that he will not only shake the Earth, but the
Heavens also in that Day; not only in destroying the false Prophet, and so all
Idolatrous Congregations, with all their forms of Church Government; but also
in causing to cease all the outward Government, and Ordinances, suitable to the
Church of Christ, in this frail state at that Day; and no till that Day, shall
all these things be done. And though he did the first work himself alone, yet
in this work for these things, he comes not only with his Holy Angels, but also
with all his Saints joining with him in this work, as is said, Let their Saints
be joyful, in glory, etc. Psalm. 149.5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth (or throat) and a two-edged
sword in their hand, to execute vengeance upon the Heathen, and punishments
upon the people, to bind their Kings in chains, and their Nobles with fetters
of iron, to execute upon them the judgment written. This honor have all his
Saints: Hallelujah. Mal. 4.3.
For in that Day they shall tread down the wicked, and they shall be as ashes
under the soles of their Feet: and so in the great straight, to give the great
Overthrow to the Enemies: at the Day of the Lord's coming, it is said, Zach.
14.1, 2-6. Rev. 19.11-21. 2 Pet. 3.5, 6, 7, 8-10.
The Lord my God shall come, and all the Saints with thee. And so the Armies in
Heaven follow him to the taking of the Beast and the false Prophet, and casting
them into the Lake of Eire, and slaying the Remnant with the Sword, etc. when
also the Earth, with the Works that are therein, shall be burned up and
destroyed, as the old World was with Water. And this being done, the next work
is,

3. To restore all things; so said Peter, Act. 3.19, 20.
When the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and he
shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you. And so as in the
beginning of the first Creation, the whole business is first set forth in
general, Genesis 1 chap. and then the things done in the same time, more
particularly set forth and explicated, chap. 2, and 3: So here, in the
dissolution of the Old, and completing of the New Creation, the things done
are in general related, Rev. 19, and 20 chap. and then more particularly
opened, Rev. 21.7, 5.
chap. 21, and 22. And so John says, He saw a new Heaven and a new Earth, etc.
And the Lord says, Behold, I make all things new, etc. And again, These words
are true and faithful. And so the Believers when that great Overthrow is given
to the wicked, 2 Pet. 3.12, 13.
do look for a new Heaven and new Earth, according to his promise: for so when
he cuts off the wicked, Isa. 65.12, 15, 17.
he has promised to create new Heaven and a new Earth, etc. And this is
assured to be in that Day of the Manifestation of the Sons of God, that the
Creature, even the whole Creation, shall be delivered from the Bondage of
Corruption into the glorious Liberty of the Children of God, who shall then
enjoy the Adoption, Romans 8.19, 20, 21, 22. Heb. 2.5, 6. with Psalm. 8.4, 5, 6,
7, 8. Romans 4.13. Heb. 11.16. Isa. 58.12.
the Redemption of the Body, which they now wait for. This the World to come
whereof we speak; this the World to come, of which Abraham shall be an Heir;
this the Country, he and our Fathers waited for, and then shall inherit: so, as
Christ in this respect also, is the Restorer of paths to dwell in. And having
thus renewed the Heaven and the Earth, the next work, which is done in
completing this, is clearly shown,

4. Rev. 11.18. Luke 14.14. Joh. 14.3. 2 Timothy 2.12. Rev. 1.5. and 5.10. Luke
22.28, 29, 30. Mat. 19.28, 29.
To take unto him his great Power and Reign; and so to give rewards to his
Servants the Prophets, and to the Saints, and to them that fear his Name, small
and great; and so to receive to himself, all that have formerly believed on
him, lived to him, and suffered with him, that they may reign with him; yea,
eat and drink at his Table in his Kingdom, and sit on Thrones, etc. In which
Reign and Kingdom of Christ with his Saints, when he comes and takes it, diverse
things are considerable, as expressly declared and affirmed in the Scripture; as
about the place of his reigning, and the place of his Throne, and the extent,
and manner, and prosperity, and duration of his Kingdom.

CHAP. 18.
Of the things considerable about the Kingdom of Christ.

THat mentioned in the Scripture about the Kingdom of Christ, is,

1. The place of his Kingdom and Reign, it shall be upon the Earth, the Earth
being renewed. This is plainly intimated in Heb. 2.5, 6, 7, 8. compared with
Psalm. 8.4, 6, 7, 8, 9. and affirmed both of him and his Saints, upon the making
of the new Heaven and the new Earth: I John saw the holy City, Rev. 21.1, 2.
new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned
for her Husband. Is not this the Spirits of Just Men made perfect, receiving
their Bodies raised immortal, Heb. 12.22, 23, 24. Gal. 4.26. 1 Cor. 15.51, 52,
53, 54. 1 These. 4.15, 16, 17.
glorious, powerful and spiritual; and the living Saints in the same moment of
their Resurrection, changed, and made like them: and so both together
ascending, and meeting the Lord in the Air or Heaven; and so coming down with
him as is foreshewn? And that we may rightly understand the meaning of the
Vision declared, he farther says, Rev. 21.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Zach. 14.9. Psalm.
72.8.
And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God
is with men, and he will dwell with them: and so on. Yea, the Reign of Christ
is expressly affirmed, That it shall be on Earth; and the Reign of the Saints
with him, that it shall be on Earth also: so they confess, Thou have made us
unto our God, Rev. 5.10. Psalm. 37.9, 10, 11.
Kings and Priests; and we shall reign on the earth. And so it is said, When
the wicked are cut off, and shall not be, then the meek (that wait on the Lord
in these days of his patience) shall inher it the earth, and delight
themselves in the abundance of peace. But this will still more appear in the
Points following: and so I will proceed to them.

2. The place of the Throne, it shall be Jerusalem; the great and Holy City in
the midst of Canaan, in which Abraham walked and sojourned as a Stranger;
though then renewed and enlarged: Jer. 3.17.
and so it is said, At that tune they shall call Jerusalem the Throne of the
Lord: And all Nations shall be gathered unto it, Isa. 24.23.
to the Name of the Lord to Jerusalem, etc. The Lord of Hosts shall reign in
Mount Sion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously. Isa. 33.17,
20, 21
And again, Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty, etc. Look upon Sion,
the City of our solemnities. Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation,
a tabernacle that shall not be taken down, etc. There the glorious Lord will be
unto us a place of broad rivers and streams, etc. Oh Jerusalem, the holy City,
Isa. 52.1.
henceforth there shall no more come into thee, the uncircumcised and the
unclean: Rev. 21.10, 11-27. Isa. 2.3. Mic. 4.2. Isa. 62.7. Ezck. 38.35. Psalm.
122.5. Mat. 19.28.
according to that, Rev. 21.27. Then the Law shall go forth of Sion, and the
Word of the Lord from Jerusalem; then shall Jerusalem be the praise of the
Earth, and the Name of the City shall be from that Day, The Lord is there; yea,
in Jerusalem are set the Thrones for Judgment, the Thrones of the House of
David; there shall the twelve Apostles sit on twelve Thrones, judging the
twelve Tribes of Israel: all being but the Throne of Christ, who overcoming
through sufferings, is now set on the right Hand of God, and so set with his
Father on his Father's Throne. And when he comes to take his own Throne, Luke
1.32. Rev. 3.21. Rev. 22.14.19. Genesis 13.14-17. Heb. 11.9. 1 Chronicles. 16.16, 17,
18. Psalm. 105.8, 9, 10, 11. Isa. 14.2. Zech. 12.6. and 14.10. Isa. 61.7.
the Throne of his Father David, that God will give unto him; he promises
likewise, to him that overcomes, to grant to sit with him on his Throne; so
that all such shall have their part in this holy City Jerusalem, which
Jerusalem, shall be in the Land of Canaan, in which Abraham sojourned; and
where David, though a sojourner also, yet reigned, there shall Jerusalem be,
and be again inhabited and resorted to, even in her own place: So, as for the
shame they have undergone, etc. they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore,
in their own Land, they shall possess the double; and everlasting joyshall be
upon them.

3. The extent and largeness of this Kingdom, Dominion, and Reigning, it shall
be over all Nations, over the whole Earth: Zech. 14.9.
and so it is said, And the Lord shall be King over all the earth: in that day
there shall be one Lord, and his Name one. And, Psalm. 72.8, 9, 10, 11.
he shall have dominion from Sea to Sea, and from the River to the ends of the
earth. They that dwell in the wilderness shall how before him, and his enemies
shall lick the dust. The Kings of Tarshish and the Isles, shall bring presents;
the Kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts: yea, all Kings shall fall down
before him, all Nations shall serve him. And so in Vision seen, Dan. 7.14, 27.
And there was given him Dominion, and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all People,
Nations and Languages shall serve him: his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion;
and the Kingdom and Dominion, and greatness of the Kingdom under the whole
Heaven, shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most High, whose
Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and all Dominions (or Rulers) shall serve
and obey him. Rev. 2.26.
And so the Promise, And he that overcomes and keeps my works unto the end,
to him will I give power over the Nations, and he shall rule them, etc. even as
I received of my Father. Again, Do you not know that the Saints shall judge the
world? 1 Cor. 6.2.


4. The manner of this Kingdom, in the beginning of it, and till Christ deliver
up the Kingdom to the Father, it shall be Davidical: his Regiment Providential
among Men, has from the beginning been, and till his next coming will be, by
wordly Governors, which by a Divine power he raises up, and puts down, and
changes by means and Instruments, as and when it pleases him. His Spiritual
Regiment, is, and has been, and will be till his coming again, by his Holy
Spirit in and with his Word of Grace, in the Hearts and Consciences of his
Saints on Earth; which is also so far Divine, that he makes them Partakers of
the Divine Nature, though not all Raigners, but sufferers in this world. But
his own Personal Regiment, as Man and Son of David, shall be Davidical, though
exceeding that of David, as Truth is in all things, and ever exceeding the
Types; in which also are some dissimilitudes, as has been foreshewn, yet ever
fullness in the Truth, to answer all that by similitudes was typed or figured.
And so,

1. Jesus Christ shall have the Kingdom of his Father David, 1 King. 8.18, 19,
20. 2 Samuel 7.12, 16. Psalm. 132. 11-18.
sit thereon, and rule that House and Kingdom, suitable to, and excelling that
said of, and by Solomon the Type; in which shall be fulfilled that promised, 2 Samuel 7. according to his Oath mentioned, Of the fruit of thy body will I set
upon thy Throne, etc. and according to that prophesied. I will raise unto David
a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, Jer. 23.5, 6.
and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall
be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is the Name whereby he shall
be called, Jehovah our Righteousness. And this (...), this is (...) or: Jer.

Ezekiel. 34.23, 24 and 37.24, 25. Daniel shall then stand up in his Lot.
Zerubbabel shall be there as a Signet, etc. The Apostles shall there sit on
twelve Thrones, etc. The victorious Saints shall sit with him on his Throne,
ruling the Nations: All the Saints judging the World, (as Sampson, Deborah,
Barak, and Samuel judged Israel, though it will be in more holy manner.) And so
it is said, Have thou authority over ten Cities: Be thou Ruler over five Cities:
and, I will make thee Ruler over many things. And so likewise for the Governed;
here is also great diversity of degrees, the twelve Tribes of Israel, that are
surviving at his coming, for him to settle in their Inheritance, and those of
the Nations joined to them; and all the People, by the Law going forth of Sion,
converted to them. These are the chief, Isa. 19.21, 22-25. and 66.29.24 Amos
9.12-15. Zech. 2.6-13. Heb. 4.3-10. Rev. 21.24. Isa. 61.5, 6. and 60. Rev.
21.27. Zech. 14.16-19. Rev. 20.8, 9.
and as natural Subjects and free Denizens, have their recourse to the City, to
worship, and keep a perpetual sabbath, and sing Hallelujahs to the Lord: and
the residue of the Nations shall be Servants, and serviceable unto them, who,
if, as the Law comes out of Sion to them, they do not convert and turn to come
and worship, they shall not enter the City; but receive such punishment, as
shall witness displeasure; and they at last be found of that number, that will
be destroyed. Such the degrees both of Rulers and Subjects in this Kingdom; and
therefore rightly called Davidical.

5. The prosperity, beauty and flourishing happiness of this Kingdom, is
exceeding great and glorious: I will only name a little, and quote some
Scriptures.

1. There shall be no sorrow, grief, pain or crying, Isa. 14.3. and 51. 11.
Jer. 3.12, 13, 14. Psalm. 121.5, 6, 7, 8. Isa. 25.8. Rev. 7.15. and 21.4.
nor any thing to cause or occasion it; no violence, oppression, or hurtful
Creature; no sickness, affliction or death; no pollution in Earth or Air; but
all fullness of satisfying in every thing that is good for them.

2. They shall all know the Lord, Jer. 31.33, 34. and 32.38, 39, 40. Ezekiel.
11.19, 20. and 36.26, 27
and the Law of God shall be in their Heart; and they shall have one Heart and
one Way, to love and fear the Lord for their good for ever.

3. They shall not one envy another for any difference in degrees; but each
rejoice in others preferment, as his own, Zech. 3.11. Psa. 106.4, 5.
Isa. 11.13. and 29, 22, 24.

4. Zech. 3.9, 13.
They shall all speak Truth sincerely, both to God, and to one another; for he
will then give and turn to them a pure lip.

5. Psa. 72.16. Isa. 11.6, 7, 8, 9. and 2.4. Mic. 4.3, 4, 5. and 5.5. Zeth.
6.12, 13.
Righteousness and Peace shall stream among them in abundance, Isa. 32.17, 18.
and 11.4. and 60.17. and 66.12. Jer. 33.6. Psalm. 72.7. and with this, abundance
of plenty, and all Creatures at peace with one another; and all Men: so, as
they shall learn war no more, but sit quietly under their Vines and Fig Trees,
and in quiet Habitations: and for these things we may yet see farther, Isa.
49.18-23. and 60. and 65.12, to the end.

In this day, Zech. 12.8. Zech. 12.9. Rev. 20.8, 9.
he that is feeble among them shall be as David, and the House of David as God,
as the Angel of the Lord before them: and as at the beginning of the Kingdom he
destroyed all the Enemies that would not serve them; so toward the end of the
Davidical Regiment (for of the Kingdom is no end) he will destroy all that rise
up against them. And so I proceed to the last considerable about this Kingdom.

6. Isa. 54.9, 10. Jer. 31.35, 36. and 33.25.
The duration of the Kingdom it self is for ever and ever, has no end, as is
often said: but for this manner of administration in this Davidical Regiment or
Kingdom, as in the Kingdom there is such a Monarchy, and such degrees of Rulers
and ruled, we may consider how long that shall continue, and that shall be as
long as day and night, and the course of the Sun and Moon endures; Rev. 21.23,
25. Isa. 30.26. Psa. 8.3, 4. Psa. 72.7, 17. Rev. 20.5, 6.
for though there be no night in the City, and it have no need of the Sun, yet
will there be day and night, and the Sun and the Moon keep their course, with
sevenfold more glorious splendour, and useful to the Inhabitants of the Earth
also: and so it is said, In his days shall the righteous flourish, and
abundance of peace, so long as the Moon end ureth: his Name shall be for ever:
his Name shall continue as long as the Sun, and men shall be blessed in him,
etc. It is evident, this manner of reigning shall be for a thousand years;
which, if taken indefinitely, may be a long time; if taken strictly, as some
for weighty reasons conceive it to be; yet if, as some conceive the measure of
the Sanctuary to be double to the common measure, we may so conceive it to be a
longer thousand than in our ordinary account. And surely, he that in his love
of compassion shortneth the dawes of tribulation, may in his love of delight
lengthen those days of rejoicing reigning: but I will neither dispute nor
determine it; but only say as it is testified, and I believe, it shall be a
thousand years at the least, the time of Christ, as Man, and his Saints with
him, absolute and clear reigning; and so, if minded, a long time: the complaint
of the Prophet in the behalf of the Church, was, The people of thy holiness
possessed but a little while, Isa. 63.18, 19.
(that possession they fore-had in the times of David, Solomon, Rehoboam,
Abiam, Asa, Hezekiah, Josiah, etc. but a little while) our adversaries have
trodden down thy Sanctuary, etc. and the promise of God to them by the same
Prophet, is, As the days of a tree, Isu. 65.22.
(which is the longest of all vegetable Creatures) so the days of my people,
(which can be no less, than as the Tree in durance abides longer than the
Grass, Herb or Corn; so his people shall longer enjoy their Land, and this
manner of reigning, then any other Monarch or Nation has done theirs) and mine
elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. And this is also clear, Rev.
9.6. and 10.6, 7.
That Time shall continue so long as theseventh Angel with his seventh Trumpet
sounds, and no longer. And it appears by comparing Rev. 11.11, 12, 13, 14.
with chap. 19. throughout, That the reviving of the Witnesses, and the
appearance of Christ, and the Resurrection of the Just, and the Destruction of
the Beast and the false Prophet, are before the sounding of the seventh Angel.
And in his beginning to sound, the worldly Powers and Dominions are taken down,
and the Devil bound and shut up, and the Thrones set. And what time these
things take, I dare not say; but some time sure, and then they sit upon
Thrones, and the whole mystery of God is opened; and then, and not before then,
begins the thousand years of their reigning and judging. Mar. 25.31-46.
And when the Son of Man shall sit on the Throne of his glory, then, in that
day, (but whether in the beginning, or in the middle, or the end, I leave to
every man to think as he sees cause) all Nations shall be gathered before him
(this may be in beginning, and middle and end, and throughout this great Day of
the Lord) and he shall separate them, and set the sheep on his right hand, and
the goats on his left. And when he does that, then he proceeds to the last
and final Judgment, which Judgment is not by his Saints, as the former
judging and ruling was; but by himself only: and as the Resurrection of the
Just at first was Christ his own work alone; so the Resurrection of the Unjust,
and this final Judgment, Rev. 20.11-15.
is also now. The compassing the Camp of the Saints, fire coming down from
Heaven, and consuming the Enemies; the time of Satan's last loosing, and his
being taken and cast into the Lake of Fire, and then the Resurrection of the
wicked, and also their Judgment according to their works, who knows what time
these things will take? What God, as God, may suddenly do, I meddle not with;
but what God in Christ, and so what the Son of Man will do, according to the
capacities of Men, however enlarged by him, in judging, with (as one may say)
opening the Books, setting Men's sins in order before them, producing witnesses,
and passing the sentence upon every one; I dare not determine in what space of
time this one thing shall be done: but how long or short soever, although
joyful to the Saints, yet all this, with all that went before it, from Satan's
last loosing, to his being cast into the Lake of Fire, and the Resurrection of
the wicked, it is all after the thousand years of the Saints reigning and
judging, however the thousand years be taken; and all this time Christ as Man
reigns and judges, and his Saints are with him; and so it is a long time,
and the Resurrection of the wicked, and the final Judgment past: then Christ
delivers up the Kingdom to his Father, and then is the mystery of God wholly
finished, and time shall be no more, all will be Eternity; then the Kingdom
continues still for ever to Eternity; only the Davidical Regiment of it, is
delivered up to the Father, and all ruling as Men, all differences of Men in
ruling, or ruled, cease; yea, Christ himself as Man, and David's Son, and his
whole Body of Saints as Men; yea, he as a Monarch, and they, as Rulers or
ruled, are all subject wholly to the Divine Nature, God being All in All; the
Man Christ remaining, 2 Cor. 15.28.
and God in him; the Saints remaining, and God in them; the Kingdom remaining,
and God in all: God is in all; yea, All in all; he is in them all, Wisdom,
Power, Righteousness, Truth, Love, Joy, Glory, Everlasting Life and Joy; God is
All, and All in all; yea, so full, so glorious, and everlasting Joy, that all
former things are so forgot, as if this had ever been; yea, without beginning,
and, as if all that can be to Eternity, were comprehended in present, and so
will be to Eternity, without end, the joy of the Lord in which he is, in which
all the Saints are, it being their joy also, they are now both filled and
compassed with it in them, they in it: they now enjoy to the full, that prayed
for, to which the first Fruits in the Day of Grace, and the Harvest in the
Davidical Regiment, had its tendency, Ephesians. 3.17, 18, 19.
even to be filled with all the fullness of God; yea, if it may be born, I
suppose one might in a true sense say, That of all the Saints, and every of the
Saints, according to every of their capacities, (which by the Divine Nature
possessing them, will then be unconceivably great) which is said of the Man
Christ, That as all the fullness of the Godhead, (even the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, in the Divine Essence, Love, Goodness, Power, Truth, Glory, etc.) dwells
in him bodily: so the fullness of the Godhead of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in
their Love, Joy, Goodness, Power, Wisdom, etc. dwells in them bodily, (then)
shows it self, and operates in and through their Bodies, so as never before;
only with this exception, The Man Christ is one Person in the Son of God, and
so God-Man; yea, that very Person is very God; though as Man he have yielded up
the Government to God, yet as God he governs still: but none of the Saints are
one Person with the Son of God, and so not God, governing; but filled with God.
I desire to express it only as by Scripture I may: We believing in him, now
live by Faith, and enjoy all, and walk in and by Faith, Hope and Love: but in
the Davidical Kingdom, we shall not live by Faith, but by Sight; 2 Cor. 5.7. 1
Cor. 13.8 13. Romans 8.24, 25. 1 John 3.2. and 4.7, 12. 1 Cor. 15.28.
and so there will be no Exercise of Faith, nor yet of Hope; we seeing as we
are seen, and none hops for that which he sees; and yet the habits of Faith
and Hope abide till the Kingdom become wholly Divine; but Charity is most in
Exercise: but when God is become All in all, then Faith and Hope, and all
Desires are streamed into Charity, and Charity abides ever; God is Charity;
and God, and so Charity, is All in them, and in them all; his delight in them,
and their rejoicing in him. Oh unconceiveable Life, Joy, Happiness, without any
intermission for ever and ever! But what manner of Glory this shall be, is not
yet revealed, nor will be, till Christ be upon the Throne of David, that the
whole mystery of God be opened. Therefore I desire no farther to pry into it;
but only as it is revealed, that so it shall be, and that I desire to believe;
and for the manner of it, let it alone till the Day declare it. And this is all
I will, till farther occasion given me, say of the Kingdom of Christ, he comes
to take, and so likewise of the Ends of his second and glorious coming; which
yet is enough to make Believers long and wait for his coming, the Time whereof
is next to be spoken of.

CHAP. 19.
Of the third Point, The Time of the next coming of Christ.

FOr the Time of the coming again of Christ, I shall also say what I find: for
as for the precise hour or day, natural or prophetical, it were presumption in
me so to enquire, as to think beforehand certainly to know it, seeing our
Savior Christ himself has told even his own Disciples that enquired after it,
Ye know not when the time is; not only when the end of the Day, Mar. 13.32, 33,
34, 35.
the last and final Judgment shall be; but not the beginning of the Day, when
the Master of the House comes, whether at even, or at midnight, or at
cock-crowing, or at morning. If any reply, That Christ himself, as he was the
Son of Man, and Minister of the Gospel, did not as then so know it as to make
it known; that is, it was not as yet given him to reveal: This is not denied.

And if it be farther replied, That after his Ascension, it was given him to
reveal, Rev. 1.1, 2.
and he sent and signified it to his servant John;

I answer, This is true also, That then was given him a more full Revelation
for opening the things to come contained in the Scriptures, Luke 24.26, 27, 44,
45.
than that which he had formerly opened to them: in which also the Holy Ghost
instructed them, Joh. 14.26. and 15.26. and 16.13, 14, 15. Romans 16.25, 26. 1 John 2.27.
even about the same things. But now indeed he gives to John a more full
Revelation visionally, with some more particulars explicated as touching the
Gentiles, of those very things, then was before as to the other Apostles by the
Spirit, in which still it was the Office of the Holy Ghost, even by and with
the Scriptures forewritten, to teach, and enable them to teach: yea the very
hour or day, natural or prophetical, that is, for a year in ordinary account,
is not so declared or set down, that one can certainly know it, so, as to say,
and miss not the very hour, or day, or year, in which our Lord will visibly
come, and not before or after it. Whence himself in that Revelation also says,
Behold, I come as a thief; Rev. 16.15. Mat. 24.42, 43, 45. Mar. 13.35, 37. Luke
21.34, 35, 36.
blessed is he that watches and keeps his garments, lest, etc. And this also
of good usefulness for us, that we may be always watchful and prepared,
waiting and looking for his coming, that in his coming we may be found
well-doing. And yet though the precise hour or day natural or prophetical, be
not of us fore-known; yet this we may certainly know, first, That it will
certainly be: and secondly, That it is nigh at hand; yea, many ways evidenced
to be nigh, even at the doors. And this will clearly appear, if we consider
these three things in his coming.

1. His coming to particular Men, in taking away their natural lives. 2. His
coming in hastening and bringing forth or ordering those works by his
providence, that are to be accomplished before his personal and visible
appearance. 3. His personal and visible appearance it self, in that manner, and
to those ends before-shewn. It, in every sense and consideration, will appear
nigh: it cannot be far off. For, 1. When any Man dies and gives up the Ghost,
it is to that Man, and so to every Man in the Day of his natural Death, in
respect of his eternal welfare or woe, Eccl. 9.10. and 11.3. Joh. 5.28, 29.
the very same as if Christ did then personally come: for in what estate of
Faith, or Unbelief; in peace with God, or enmity against him; and so as in
well-doing or evil-doing, a Man is found when he gives up the Ghost, in the
same shall he be found, and appear in the Resurrection of the Dead, and so
dealt with by Jesus Christ in his personal appearance, when at his voice the
Dead are raised: Eccles. 3.21. and 12.7. Rev. 6.9. Luke 16.22. 2 Cor. 5.8.
Phil. 1.23. 1 Pet. 3.19. Romans 14.12. 2 Cor. 5.10. Eccles. 9.5, 6.
when any dies, the Spirit goes to God that gave it; and if dying in Faith or
gracious Estate, it is put under the Altar or wings of Christ in Heaven,
sometime called Abraham's bosom, now the Altar or presence of Christ: but if
dying in unbelief, or disobedient state, the Spirit is put in Prison till the
great and final Judgment; and in the Resurrection of the Bodies, the Spirits
shall be united again, every one to his own Body, and appear before the
Judgment Seat of Christ: the Body all the time till then being dead and turned
to dust, it knows nothing, is sensible of nothing: and so an hour, a day, a
year, or a thousand years, is all one to them, and not so much or so long as an
hour to a living Man: so that his coming in this respect is nigh, and always
has been, to every Man in their several ages: for of that day and hour knows
no Man certainly till it come; but long it cannot be: so that in this respect
it is needful to be always ready. 2. By his discernable (though not visibly
personal) appearance, in bringing to pass and ordering those things that must
be done before his personal and bodily coming; and which being all done, he
will certainly and without tarrying come; and by which as they are in doing,
and come to pass, he wills us to take notice, That his coming draws nigh, and
is at the doors; Mat. 24.4-30. Mar. 13.5-26. Luke 21.8-27.
and that is such things as these, the hearing and seeing wars, near or where
we live; and hearing the rumors of Wars afar off, Famines, Pestilences, Earth
quakes; then Persecutions, and killing such as believe in Christ, and live to
him; and false Prophets arising and deceiving many; then the decay of the love
of many that have been believers, and betraying their Brethren: then some
saying, Here is Christ; or, There is Christ: and some saying, I am Christ. And
in all this, the security or carelessness of the world, not minding any coming
of his in Judgments or in Person, but giving up themselves to follow their
worldly affairs: and then some strange shakings both of Heaven and Earth; of
Churches and States; and strange Apparitions in Sun, and Moon, and Stars. These
things, with the Gospel preached over all the world, were to come to pass, and
so did, before the end, in the destruction of Jerusalem. And after that, they
were all to come to pass, and so be done over again before the end of the World
in the coming of Christ; who, when all these things are fully done and come to
pass, will suddenly come and appear, as himself has foretold us. And our
Savior also bids us, When we see these things come to pass, to know that his
coming is nigh, even at the doors: and warns Believers not to be troubled when
they see these things come to pass; but to list up their heads, for the
nighdrawing of their Redemption. And of, these things the Apostles in their
writings, and in the Revelation also, gives us warning. All which things have
in the several Ages since, been fulfilling, and now apparently to be seen in an
high degree; almost all and every of them come to pass: so that the Day is
hastening and nigh at hand, that by viewing these things, we may take notice of
it, and so be prepared, patiently waiting for his coming. Behold he comes, He
comes quickly. 3. His personal and visible appearance, and coming again, Romans
11.25. with Luke 3.8. Rev. 2.21 Genesis 15.16. Rev. 14.15, 18.
spoken of, is to be when the fullness of the Gentiles is come in, that is, when
they have had their time in their several places, for Gospel-preaching among
them, and those that in hearing heard, are gathered in; and the sins of
Opposers grown full and ripe: and so, when the Kings of the Earth, the ten
Horns, that have helped to uphold the eighth and seventh Head of the Beast,
Rev. 17, with 16, and 18.
that double Beast on whom the Whore did ride, shall hate the Whore, and have
made her desolate, and naked, and eat her flesh, and burned her with fire: and
so, when the great Babylon, as well as the mysterious Babylon is fallen, then
will he come. Which things appear in a great forwardness; but not yet fully
done: of which, Rev. 19.
many have written, and I forbear to speak; it being not my business in this
Tract: but, when the twelve Tribes of Israel are come from all parts of the
World into their own Land, Dan. 12.11, 12.
then forty five years after, will Jesus Christ visibly appear.

But then some may reply, and say, That the Day may be then known, as a day is
taken for a year, to be forty five years just, after the Jews coming in again
to Canaan; and the day of their coming in again may be known by the same place
in Dan. 12.11. to be 1290 years after the abomination that makes desolate is
set up.

To this I thus far yield, That to such as God gives understanding in these
Visions, toward the time of fulfilling, they may come very nigh to know the
neer-approaching: but I suppose, not certainly the very year, before it comes,
for these Reasons: 1. Because our Savior says, We know not the hour or day of
our Master's coming, as has been shown. 2. Dan. 9.1, 2, 3, etc.
Because Daniel, that knew the time of their then Captivity to be express,
seventy years; and understanding by Books the number of the years near out, yet
did not certainly determine the expiration, as one certainly knowing with which
of their goings into Captivity to begin the account; but set his face to seek
the Lord for the same, and so for their return. 3. Rev. 6.9, 10, 11.
Because the Souls of them that were slain for the Word of God and the
Testimony which they held, being under the Altar in the presence of Christ,
they yet knew not the certain time of the coming of this Day: and though, (as
Daniel) the time drawing nigh, they long for it; yet with all the refreshing
flowing on them, they are bid rest for a little season, etc. but the period of
time no farther declared, but only, that it is a little season: and shall we
think to know the time more certainly when than they? 4. Because among many
learned, godly and laborious Men in this business, which by occasions I have
read, I find great difference in their account: some, whose accounts are
already past; and diverse that do much differ, hundreds of years one from
another; and some make it to be a hundred year longer than I will name, or can
believe: and yet probably some might do it from a mistake of the end of that
great Day in the final Judgment of the wicked, for the beginning of that Day
in the Resurrection of the Just, Genesis 17.24. and 25.26. and 47.9. Heb. 11.9.
Exodus 12.40, 41. Gal. 3.17.
in Christ's first glorious appearing: and others might happily lose some years
in account, as some have done in counting but 430 years from the first making
of the promise to Abraham, to the Law giving on Mount Sinai: whereas from the
promise-making to Abraham, to Jacob's Birth, was 61 years: from that to Jacob's
standing before Pharaoh, 130 years: which 191 years, they lived by Faith in the
Land of Promise, as Sojourners: And after the Promise or living by Faith as
Sojourners in the Land of Promise, the Children of Israel sojourned 430 years
in Egypt before the giving of the Law, of which the Apostle speaks. And so by
some, 191 years may be lost by that account. What more between Moses and
Samnel, and after, I have not time and ability to search? And since all
Chronologers agree not for the time since the Creation, no wonder if good Men
have been mistaken for that which is to come. And of them that produce strong
Reasons, and have been skilled in Chronicles, and course of times, and agree
nearest among themselves: in this I speak but as in such Books I have read;
some, speaking of the time of his coming, say, It will be in the year of the
Lord 1688: others, 1689: others, 1700: and others, 1701: others make more. It
is very like they come near; but that they are not under or over, I dare say of
none, till their time be past: but for those Worthies, who, as I suppose, go
the surest way to work, to begin their account from the total destruction of
the Temple in Jerusalem, so as one stone was not left upon another; and so the
daily Sacrifice wholly done away, and the abomination of desolation set up in
Julian's time, which some say was in the year 360; and some say, 367; others,
368, or thereabonts. And from thence reckon Daniel's 1290, to the Jews coming
in; which will fall out to be 1656, or 1657, or 1658, or there-abouts; yet the
Chronologies are not so uniform and certain, that they can all agree, and pitch
upon that year of his coming, in certainty; though I suppose they come near,
yet if it were even now, or should certainly be that they come into their Land,
this next year, 1656, which, O that it might so be! yet to pitch upon the last
year of the next 45 to end, is not so easy, as I have sometime thought it,
because it is not certain whether we shall begin the 45 at the first assay of
some for entering, or at some more general settlement of them in the Land, after
some Battles fought: and then 45 years after, in their greatest strait, he
comes to overthrow their Enemies: of which proceeding, I conceive we may learn
something by the manner of God's dealing for them when he led them out of Egypt
into Canadn; Isa. 11.11, 12.16.
because the Lord, speaking of what he will do for them in this great work in
that Day, concludes it thus; saying, Like as it was to Israel, in the day that
he came up out of the Land of Egypt: and then follows the Song of Thansgiving.
Isa. 12.
I shall but propound, May not there be first a stirring up of the Spirit of
some eminent ones (as of old, Moses and Aaron) to begin to stir up others, and
lead the way; while yet the generality of the people are ignorant and untoward,
(as they of old?) Somewhat of this may be included in that said, Zech. 2.6.
Jer. 3.12, 14. and 31.6. May not also some notable things be done in plagues on
the people that would detain them? (as to the Egyptians of old) may not
something of that be in Zech. 2.8, 9. and so set them a going? is not this
intimated, Isa. 11.11, 12? And when they come to be discouraged by the tongue
of the Egyptian Sea, with its seven streams, or the great River Euphrates (as
the Israelites of old by the Red Sea) may not the Lord destroy and divide the
same, Isa. 11.15, 16.
literally, that such as are thereby hindered, may go over dry-shod; and
metaphorically, in overthrowing the Turkish and Egyptian Enemies for the time,
that those that are thereby hindered may come into their Land; Rev. 16.12.
yea, and in that coming rejoice much, (as Israel when they were passed through
the Sea, and saw the Egyptians drowned:) and yet, upon some Trials, Ezekiel.
20.34, 38.
have many rebellious among them still, in due season to be purged out, (as it
was with Israel of old?) may there not in all this time, (as in the time of
Moses contest with Pharaoh, and leading the people through the Sea, in during
the peoples grievances, till they were fed with Mannah, and in some settled
order, that Jethro kept Moses Wife and Children, and then brought them to
Moses, and gave advice to Moses, even so) the Gentiles or People of the
Nations, some of them be very serviceable, to preserve, help forward, and bring
in of the people of Israel into their own Land, Isa. 49.22.
and advise and help forward, toward their settlement: and yet after all this,
(as Israel of old had many and great Plagues and Wars, with many and great
Kings, till the Rebellious were purged out, as well as those Enemies
overthrown, so) these also have like Troubles and Wars, with like Afflictions
and Purgations, Zech. 14.1, 2.
as well as Victories? And after all this, (as they of old had a Jordan to pass
over, and a Jericho to overthrow, so) these shall have their potent Enemies and
Besiegers to try them more, Dan. 12.2.
and for God to show his Wonders more among them: this their being in their own
Land being a Metaphorical Resurrection; of which, some are to shame; and some,
to contempt: their first Conductors being not so prosperous, as to be
Instruments of the conversion of the generality of them, (no more than Moses
and Aaron of old) yet God may be so gracious to them, (as to Israel of old, in
giving them a Joshuah to be their Leader; so) to send Elijah the Prophet, Mal.
4.5, 6. Isa. 31.8, 9. Isa. 66.19, 20.
to turn the hearts of the Fathers to the Children, and the hearts of the
Children to their Fathers: and upon this, the great Conversion among them; and
many not before come in to them, now coming with weeping and supplication. And,
(as Rahab was helpful of old, so) now the Gentiles may also be more abundantly
serviceable to fetch and bring them into their Land: and the Enemies still
opposing, while God is by his mighty power, (as of old dividing Jordan, and
taking the shame of Egypt off from his people, and to overthrow Jericho) about
to show his great wonders, and to take the shame of all people from off his
people Israel, and free them from all Captivity; the Enemy still strengthening
themselves to oppose, then in that strait, (as to Joshuah of old, so) to these
now, Jesus Christ himself appears, and comes, and all the Saints with him,
Zech. 14.3, 4, 5.9.
and gives the total overthrow to the Enemy: which being done, the last 45
years is expired. I determine not things to be done according to my
expressions: but suchlike things, and in a true sense, according to the
expressions of the Scripture quoted, will be done; yea, even so, that it will
be done to them, like as it was to Israel, when he came out of Egypt. So that
when the 45 years are out, is easy to be known: but when they begin, whether
at their first assay to enter, or in their beginning to settle; I know not: but
could I surely know of the least beginning of these things, I should as
assuredly know the Lord is so nigh coming, as that (as one might say) he is
risen up and on his march; and if the 45 years be not entered, they will
presently enter. So for Israel, and now for our selves that are not natural
Israel, we may learn something for our information, about the time of the
coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Cnrist, in comparing the things and events
coming to pass, with Israel of old, from their coming out of Egyyt unto the
first coming of Christ, with the things and events coming to pass with and
among Christians from the first coming of Christ, 1 Cor, 10.18. and verse. 1.6
11.
to the second and glorious coming of Christ, we are in many things willed to
behold Israel after the flesh; and they are affirmed to be figures and examples
for us, and those things to be written for our warning and instruction: and
concerning God's dealing with them, in giving them the Law by Moses, and their
demeanor toward him; Christ uttered a Parable, which may be read Mat. 21.33,
34. and Luke 20.9-17. and so for his dealing with Christians, from first to
second coming, and their demeanor toward him, he uttered a like Parable,
which may be read Mat. 25.14-30. and Luke 19.12-27. Therefore it it is useful
for us to consider and compare the same things in reading the Histories of
them, and we may discern, there is, has been, and will be some Agreement.


1. When God by Moses the Mediator, gave them the Law, and set their
Priesthood, Sacrifices, and Temple-worship in order, the people were generally,
and many of the Captains and Levites, stubborn and rebellious all the days of
the personal Ministration of Moses: so in the days of the personal
Ministration of Christ the Mediator of the New Testament, while he was
ministering the Gospel, and working Miracles to save the lost sheep of the House
of Israel, to whom in Ministration, he was especially sent, yet while he was
choosing Apostles and Evangelists, and giving them his Gospel and his Ordinances
to have ministered to them, yet were the people generally, with their
High Priest, and Priests, and Lawyers, stubborn and rebellious, and but few of
them that came in to believe on him.

2. In Joshuah's time, when Moses was taken away, the people were more
generally obedient, and followed the Lord more fully; (though some trouble by
Achan.) And so in the days of the Elders that outlived Joshuah. So in the
Apostles and first Witnesses days, (after Christ left the World, and went to
the Father) both Jews and Gentiles came in apace; and the Churches increased
and prospered, and grew in Grace, and kept the Faith sound; notwithstanding
some harm done by false Prophets; for the Spirit of Antichrist began, even
before their departure, to work; yet the Churches kept the Faith sound in their
days, and in the days of the Churches of those first times that next succeeded
them, and received the Gospel from their personal Ministration.

3. After Joshuah's time, and the time of the Elders that outlived Joshuah,
the people learned the manners of the Nations, and went a whoring after their
Gods, and God delivered them often into the hands of their Oppressors; yet in
mercy ever and anon in their distresses, be raised them up Saviors or Judges.
So after the time of the Apostles and first Witnesses, and the time of the
Churches next succeeding them, (according as the Apostles had foretold) wolves
did enter in among them, and men speaking perverse things, rose up among them;
and something now they inclined, to adorn them with the Wisdom and Learning of
the Gentiles, in Philosophy, and other suchlike Arts, and excellency of
Speech, as the Gentiles gloried in; and likewise with such worldly
Excellencies, and Superiorities, and Dignities for Church Order and Offices, as
might suit the same; and so humane Traditions and Superstitions begun to spring
up; and God deeply chastned them, and suffered the Enemies to load them with
many Persecutions: yet in their cries he still gave them some Deliverances, and
preserved to them many good and faithful Teachers.

4. After those troublous times of Israel, God gave them more peaceable times,
with the enjoyment of the purity of his worship, in the days of Samuel, Saul,
David, Solomon, and his worshipping right to Judah, in following Kings Raigns
for a time: so God was pleased after terrible Persecutions to give to the
Christian Churches rest and peace in the time of Constantine, and some other
Emperors and Kings after him; so, as the Churches began for to increase and
flourish, both East and West for a time.

5. After Israel had long enjoyed these flourishing times, they grew full, and
fell into Divisions; and then ten Tribes rent from the House of David, and fell
to superstition, in worshipping Jeroboam's Calves, and after to more gross
Idolatry in worshipping Baal, till they were carried away into Captivity, and
are not yet returned: but Judah still worshipped the true God, though polluted
with many defilements of Israel's Superstition: so the Christian Churches after
a while of enjoyment of these flourishing times, grew full, and through pride
and covetousness of their Bishops, aspiring for pre-eminence, fell into many
Sects and Divisions: and what Divisions in Churches, and between the Churches
East and West, is by many recorded; till many Churches that were famous in the
first times, had their Candlesticks removed; and Mahometans now possess their
place, and they are not to this day restored. The other Churches, specially
Westward, still retained the Faith, though defiled with many humane inventions
and superstitions.

6. After Israel's Captivity, yet Judah repented not of the defilements among
them: but, though for a while continuing with God, yet by degrees they fell to
provoke him so with their Idolatries, that he caused them also to be carried
away Captive to Babylon, for threescore and ten years; so also after the
removal of so many Churches Eastward, the remaining Churches VVestward did not
repent of their defilements with humane inventions and superstitions, nor of
the pride and covetousness of their Bishops; and though for a time they held
the Faith, yet by degrees they fell to more superstitions; so, as they provoked
God, and made way for the Man of sin, till he got his Seat in the Temple of
God, and therewith a worldly power also, and so exaited himself above all that
has Imperial Majesty; and so God being provoked, left the outward Court into
the hands of the Gentiles; and being filled with Idolatry and Superstition, the
Holy City is by them trodden under foot, 1260 years: all which time, the
VVitnesses prophecy in Sackcloth, and all the upright are as Captives in
Babylon, mysterious Babylon.

7. The Jews after their first coming out of Babylon, they set on building the
Temple, and worshipped God according to the express and plain import of the
Letter or Words of the Law, and were commended for it, and encouraged by the
Prophets, and so they prospered for a time: so the Christians after the first
coming forth from the gross darkness, delusions, and Tyranny of the Man of sin,
endeavored collection and reformation of Churches; and held forth the Gospel
according to the express and plain import of the Letter or words of the
Scripture; and for a time (though in persecution) they prospered, and the word
of the Lord grew and increased.

8. After this, the Jews fell no more to the Idolatry of Jeroboam, or of Baal,
nor to any willing or openly professed Idolatry of the Heathen; yea, they were
zealous against it: but in their zeal, they ran into many over-strict
Interpretations of some part of the Law, and over-loose in some other parts of
it; and found out many Inventions and Devices, pretending to Humility,
Devotion, and Holiness, which they took on them to observe, and so by Tradition
kept them, appearing herein very holy; and all that did not know and yield up
to the same, they counted as sinners, publicans, and profane. And thus they
continued, though under the Roman power, till the coming of Jesus Christ. So
after the coming forth from the Man of sin, these reformed Churches fall no
more to such gross Idolatries, but testify against it: yet with their humane
Learning and Wisdom, they content not themselves with the plain sayings of the
Gospel, but study and strain for Interpretations; and so have framed by their
School-Arts such appearing-exquisite Opinions, and Rules also for
Church Government, and certain Observations pretending to great strictness,
zeal, devotion, and holiness: which, taken up as a Tradition from one to
another, must be maintained and observed; and they that do not observe the
same, are counted either factious or profane. And thus they continue till near
the coming of Christ.

9. After the Jews had some Generations walked thus, God sent among them John
the Baptist in the Spirit and power of Elias, the immediate forerunner of the
Lord's first coming, by whom the way of the Lord was prepared, and many
discipled for the acknowledgement of him; but those zealous ones received him
not, but rejected him, though diverse Sects among themselves, Pharisees,
Sadduces and Herodians, etc. So after the reformed Churches have some
Generations continued thus, God stirs up some of his Servants to declare the
Testimony of Christ plainly, in the three forementioned Branches, and therein
the Love of God to Mankind, with the Privileges of Believers; and so to call
to Repentance of the Doctrines and precepts of Men, and to receive the
Testimony of Christ, and look for his coming: and some here and there do
embrace it, but very few of the wise and zealous Observers of the Doctrines and
Traditions of their Fathers will receive it, but oppose it earnestly, though
many divisions among them.

10. When the Jews had had their time, and God dealt thus with them, and their
sin ripened in opposing John, etc. then came Jesus Christ among them; but these
great Ones opposed him also: so when the Gentiles have had their time, and God
has dealt thus with them, and their sin is grown ripe in such opposition of
light, then comes Jesus Christ personally with all his Saints; but the Beast
and the false Prophet will stand against him also: but he comes not then to
suffer, but to reign; and so all the Enemies will be overthrown: he coming to
the ends aforesaid. I have in this but made a homely Comparison of the
proceedings with Jews and Gentiles, specially Christians: how it was with the
Jews, is plainly declared through the Scriptures; how it was with the Gentiles,
the Christians, in the first ages, is seen in the Scriptures; and for the
following ages, it is there also propheted: and for other knowledge, I leave to
them that are acquainted with Histories: and how it is now, let such as have
understanding, judge. And I suppose this will come near to one with the former
accounts of those godly learned Men, and manifest that first said, That the
coming of our Lord is nigh at hand; the call of the Jews being at the doors,
the fullness of Gentiles near come, and the personal coming of Christ, not long
after, he shows us daily, our lives here cannot be long; and, he is in his
works hastening his coming; and all to move us to haste to it, and be always
ready and waiting for it. Behold, he comes.

CHAP. 20.
Some Application of this Branch of the Testimony of Christ, concerning his
coming again in such manner, to such ends, etc.

THe knowledge and mindefulness of this personal coming again of Jesus Christ,
in such manner, and for such ends, as is shown, and his coming so fast, and
nigh-approaching, is profitable to warn, teach and stir us up, first to avoid
and resist the evils, and keep from the danger of seducing and evil Spirits,
that labor to withdraw, and turn many from the Faith of his coming, by their
subtle Reasonings and Arguments, viz.

1. Those Scoffers that say, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the
Fathers fell asleep, 2 Pet. 3 6.
all things continue as they were from the beginning of the Creation. Where is
this new Heaven and new Earth? This Restoration of all things? This reigning
of Christ and his Saints, you say, was promised to the Fathers; And, you have
long called these the last days, and yet no such things appears; you are
beguiled with some Enthusiasm, or Millenary-Opinion; you wait for a Fancy: one
Generation goes, and another comes; all things continue as they were, and
will so do.

We, in belief of the Testimony of Christ, 2 Pet. 3.5.7.
may know these Men are willingly ignorant, etc. we may admire God's Patience
to such, in forbearing them, that they might repent before his coming; and his
patience toward us, that have not done all we might, to gain Men in to
Repentance, that we might renew our Diligence: and we know a Day is not in
God's account, as it is with Men; and that there are some things still to be
performed that must be done before his coming: and the being tried with such
Scoffers is one thing, in which we see the Truth of his Word that foretold it;
and the fulfilling of it, and the hastening and nighness of his coming, to stir
us to desire it, etc.

2. 2 These. 2.2.
Those that go about to shake the mind of Believers, by saying, the Day of
Christ is at hand, now presently, or within one hour, or a day, or ten days;
or a month, or two months; or such a day, week, or month; within this year, or
before a year be out; and thereto pretend a spiritual Revelation, or some word,
or some thing, as out of the writings of the Apostles: for though that day be
much nigher at hand, than when the Apostles gave that warning; and though that
falling away, and the Revelation of the Man of sin be now come to pass, yet all
there spoken is not yet fulfilled. And so we know by the same Rule, That all
the Horns or ten Kingdoms, do not yet hate the Whore; and though there is a
good beginning, and in some places her Flesh eaten, yet not by them all; nor
have they yet burnt her with Fire, nor are the Jews yet come into their own
Land; yea, Euphrates is not yet dried up: all which must first be. So that it
is not so at hand, as to be this day or week: but, he is coming apace, and
hastening in doing these things, and our lives short; which is enough to move
us to be always ready, waiting and looking for his coming.

3. Those that say, The Resurrection is past already, The Lord is come to them,
2 Timothy 2.18.
and they are risen, and do reign, and Heaven is in them, and they are in
Heaven, enjoying the new Heaven and the new Earth already, and are above all
Ordinances, needing the use of none of them.

We in belief of the Testimony of Christ, do know, That when the Lord comes, he
comes and appears to all at once: and so, when the Just are raised, they are
raised all at once, and all Saints made immortal at once, and go with the Lord
to the overthrow of the wicked, and then enjoy the new Heaven and the new
Earth, and reign together; neither marrying nor giving in marriage, 1 Cor.
4.8.2 These. 4.14, 15. Heb. 11.40.
nor living in such condition: so, that whatever they fancy of their being
risen, and living, and reigning in such manner, they are deceived; for if it
were so indeed, we should not be left behind, or be as they say we are, still
in the dark; but we should see, and reign also with them, if they did so in
Truth: for no one shall prevent another in this, or any Saints be perfect
without their Fellows.

4. Those that put off all the coming of Christ, 2 Cor. 11.2, 3, ^ 2 Pet. 3.18,
19. 1 Ioh. 2.22. Prove. 30.13.
into a coming in the Spirit; and say, We must wait indeed for a coming of
Christ, but it is a coming in the Spirit; and, That it is but a fleshly Faith,
to believe in Christ, as come in the Flesh; but the spiritual believing, is to
believe in him as come in the Spirit; and so enjoying him, he is come indeed:
and then such live above Faith. Some, such as these, are intimated in the
Apostles times, though the Spirit of Antichrist did but begin then to work. But
we that believe the Testimony of Jesus Christ, do know, That Jesus, that very
Man, is The Christ; and, That his very being come in the Flesh, and that he
has done therein and thereby, is the Foundation of our Faith and Hope, and the
way and door of our approach to God; and that through which all Mercies are
extended: yea, even the Spirit it self: yea, this it is which the Holy Ghost
(whose work it is) glorifieth to the Heart, and so enables to believe in
Christ, and unites and frames to him thereby, and so to confess him come in the
Flesh, which none can do but by the Holy Spirit, which is Christ his sending
Spirit, and so coming to them, and dwelling in them by Spirit: in which he was
never absent from Believers, since the beginning of the World, though more
abundantly present where he is more known, as declared since his Ascension into
Heaven: and this his presence by Spirit in Believers, is the whole time of
believing and living by Faith; and though more abundant in operations at some
time than at others, yet it is also to help them in their weaknesses and
temptations, and through sufferings, while they are yet mortal. But his
personal coming which Believers wait for, is to free them from weakness,
temptation, sufferings, and mortality; and it is a personal, visible, and
bodily coming, as is foreshewn; so, as the deceit of these is by it easily seen
and avoided.

5. Those, who though they vary from the former sayings, Mat. 24.5, 23, 24.
yet say in effect the same, as, Lo here is Christ, in this or that Form of
outward Discipline, or such a way of outward performing such an Ordinance, to
be seen in the strictness, severity, or some outward appearing excellent thing
in it; or, Lo he is in the wilderness; Mar. 13.6, 21, 22.
if you will let go all the hopes begot in you by the Letter of the Gospel,
concerning Christ's dying for sinners, etc. you shall then see Christ: or, Lo, I
am Christ, I speak from the infallible Spirit; if you receive my saying and
Testimony, you receive Christ; if you refuse my saying, you refuse Christ. Isa.
52.6. 1 John 5.19, 20. and 2.20, 27.
Of these our Savior has forewarned us; and we that believe the Testimony of
Christ, do know, That he is by his Spirit in his own word, the Testifier of his
own Grace; so, as they that believe shall know the same; and his personal
appearing will be so visible, as we shall need no man to tell us, where he is,
or which is he; for every eye shall then see him, as is said.

Thus will the knowledge of this Branch of the Testimony of Christ help us
against all these, and suchlike delusions, which withdraw from the Faith, and
disciple to Men, and make Schisms and Rents from the true Church.

Secondly, The knowledge, belief, and minding of the coming of Christ, as set
forth in this Branch of the Testimony of Christ, will help to preserve and keep
us from falling into many miscarriages, mis-conceptions, and mis-expressions of
some Brethren; and also to afford help to such of them, as do prefer the plain
sayings of Christ before the Notions of any other Man: as, to instance some of
them.

1. Such as deny any appearance of Christ in person on the Earth, till the last
and final Judgment and sentence, when all the wicked shall be cast into the
Lake of Fire, etc. True it is, he will be visible on Earth, and on his Throne
at that time: and true it is, That all the Just shall enter into everlasting
Joy then also. And then Christ delivers up the Kingdom to his Father, that
God may be All in all: but then is no time for destroying all worldly powers,
and for restoring all things, and for bringing the Creation into the Liberty of
the Sons of God, and for the new Heaven and new Earth to be filled with
Inhabitants, and for Christ to sit on the Throne of David his Father, and for
Abraham and his seed to inherit the world; and for Christ and his Saints after
his coming to rule over the Nations, or for the Nations to serve them, and
bring their Glory and Honor to the City, etc. In this Life, the Saints
according to their measure, glorify God through sufferings; and in the new
Heaven and new Earth, God both glorifieth his Saints, making them to reign; and
they glorify him by reigning: but in that last State, God only glorifies
himself upon them, and in them, and through them, and them with himself. And
why should any of us so dishonor God, as to deny the Truth, and true
fulfilling of so many plain sayings of Scripture, so often affirmed, as has been
shown, and will be more?

If any say, That we stick too much to the Letter of the Scripture in
understanding those places;

It might be answered, That in such plain sayings so often affirmed and bound
with the Oath of God, and his Protestation of the Faithfulness of them, it is
safer and better to stick close to the Letter or Words of Scripture, as they
have been breathed forth by the Holy Spirit, than to make Unbelief of the Truth
of those plain sayings, the Interpreter of their meaning, though with never so
much humane Wisdom and Learning.

And it may be also answered, That so to understand those sayings, is according
to the Rule commanded by God, and approved by all Believers, yea, and godly
learned, as is foreshewn.

But I farther answer, Part 1. chapter 7.
That we are led by the Scripture thus to understand these things, both in that
the things spoken of his first coming, in which many things had their spiritual
sense also, yet were all performed according to the plain expression of the
Letter: as, his being born of a Virgin in Bethlem, his being called a Nazarite,
his riding on an Ass, his being sold for thirty pence, the banding of the
Rulers and people against him, the scattering of his Disciples, his Death,
Burial, Resurrection, Ascension; his pouring forth the Holy Ghost, and sitting
on the right hand of God; all fulfilled to the utmost of the plain import of
the Letter; and shall any thing be wanting in the second coming of Christ?
says not the Angel, This same Jesus shall so come, even as ye have seen him
go? etc. And also in that the Apostle, speaking of these things, shows both a
certain measure of fulfilling spiritually now, and also a fulfilling according
to the utmost of the Letter, which is also spiritual: but the one is inward, in
the soul and spirit; the other outward, on the Body also: and of that inward in
Soul and Spirit, he says, We that believe, have a first fruits, (he says not
all, nor half, nor a tenth, but a first fruits) and that we wait for, is not
only the whole or harvest of this; but the adoption, even the redemption of the
body, when also the whole Creation shall be restored into the glorious liberty
of the Sons of God. And I might add the Apostles alluding to Psalm. 8. in Heb.
2. but enough is foresaid for this. So that all our Brethren that heed and
prize Scripture-Testimony, more than Traditions and Opinions of Men, will soon
yield to believe this.

2. Such as believe and look for Christ his reigning in and over the World in
his Saints, and so would fight and strive to set Christ on his Throne, and
think all Adversaries to Christ, that oppose them in his design to be before
his personal appearing; These Brethren seem to acknowledge this Truth, That
Jesus Christ will come and appear personally to reign on Earth, and that the
Saints, that now suffer with him, shall reign with him in the Earth, and over
the Nations, and that Christ should now reign in his Saints: and both these are
true; yea, without controversy, Christ does now reign in his Saints, and its
desired to be more and more: but yet his reigning in his Saints now, is neither
his reigning over the World, nor making his Saints to rule over the Men of the
World; and the mistake is easily discernable to such as believe, and mind the
Scripture-Testimony of Christ's coming to reign.

1. For Christ his now reigning in his Saints, is not his reigning by his
Saints, or with his Saints, and they with him over Men; but as the expression
is, in his Saints; and that is, by his gracious Word and Spirit, subduing every
thought to the obedience of Christ, and them to accept the cross of Christ, 2
Cor 10.3, 4. Phil. 1.7-9. 2 Cor. 4.11, 12, 13, 14. 2 Cor. 1.7. Gal. 2.20. 2
Pet. 2.13-16. 1 Cor. 9.19-23.
and conformity to him in it: and so by the Spirit of Faith, Love and a sound
Mind, he dwells and lives in them, and they live to him; and yet in this
World are for his sake, as he was, subject to humane Powers, and servants to
all for their good: and though they overcome the World, yet their Victory is
by Faith, and not by carnal weapons, and striving for worldly honor and power
over Men; but by the Word of their Testimony, 1 John 5.4, 5. Rev. 12.11. 2 Timothy
1.12. Act. 9.4, 5. Col. 1.24.
not loving their Lives unto Death; so, as while he raigns in them, they are
sufferers for him, and so with him, and he with them; and they shall after
reign with him when he raigns.

2. The Saints reigning with Christ, Col. 3.4. 2 These. 1.7, 10. Rev. 11.15, 18.
and so his reigning in his own Person, and with and by his Saints, begins at
once together: he comes to take to him his great Power and Reign; and then, and
not till then, his Saints reign with him: he that believes makes not haste,
nor desires to reign before his Master; and when God by his Providence puts
any Saint into a place of worldly Power and Government to rule among Men, yet
in that also, they will be found sufferers, for and with their Master, and
strangers in this World; and though Protectors of their Brethren the Saints in
their outward peace, Psa. 75.2. and 72.4. Psa. 39.12. 2 Samuel 23.5. Heb. 4.7, 8,
9, 10. Heb. 11.9, 10, 16. 1 These. 1.9, 10.
yet Rulers of them as men also in their outward affairs; and not able to carry
all as they would by their several Officers and under-Governours in this World,
(the Saints must wait for that till their Masters coming:) even thus it was
with David: and so it is not yet their rest with Christ, and reigning with him
over the Men of the World. It is better to look and wait for our reigning, as
Abraham and our Fathers did, for the same inheritance and Kingdom that we are
to look for.

3. Jesus Christ is not to receive his Kingdom, Joh. 18.36. Psa. 2.6, 9. Dan.
2.44. and 7.13, 14. Ezekiel. 24.13. Luke 1.32. Dan. 7.27. 2 Timothy 4.8. Rev. 2.26.
and be set on his Throne after a worldly manner, or by any worldly power or
weapons; no, it is not the Saints, that set him upon his Throne: but it is the
Father only from whom he receives it; and he it is that gives the Kingdom to
his Saints, and sets them on Thrones. True it is, before his personal coming,
will be many Earthquakes and shakings of worldly Powers, Nation against
Nation, and the hating of the Whore, and eating her Flesh, and burning her with
Fire, by the Kingdoms of the Earth, who shall enrich themselves with her
spoils; in which Battles, the Saints, as Men, and as called by Authority, for
defense of a People, and Execution of Justice on wicked Doers, may have their
hand and work in these Battles; yet as they are Saints, so they use no
violence, commit no rapes, seek not the ruin or destruction of Men; but even
in their overthrow and confusion, desire the shame upon them to be blessed to
them, as a means of their conversion: Psalm. 83.15, 16, 17, 18. Prove. 24.17.
whence also they rejoice not simply in their ruin and harms; but rather when
they are subdued, are very merciful to them, though, when in their perverseness
overthrown, they rejoice in the righteous Judgments of God, and for his
Mercies in their own deliverance: their main design being the same with their
Masters, according to the Gospel-way, The Salvation of Men: Prove. 16.4. 1 Samuel
24.13.
they know, for revengeful, unnatural, and filthy actings, the Lord has in
this World another Generation of Men; therefore, though these be valiant in
War, yet Blood is neither imputed to them, nor the Victory ascribed to them, as
Partners with Christ; but this is his own, Isa. 63.1, 2, 3, 4.
and alone work by his Power in his Providence, (what Instruments soever he
uses) to overthrow the Enemies; in which, his Garments are sprinkled with the
Blood of his enemies; some of his Saints also dying in these Battles, his
coming also approaching nigh: but being come, that Battle in which the Saints,
and none but Saints shall be, in which also the Lord is visibly with them, and
before them, shall not be with carnal weapons, nor confused noise, nor Garments
rolled in Blood, Isa. 9.5, 6, 7. Rev. 19.11.12-21. and 20.1-4.
nor any Saint dying in that Battle; but only the wicked, and all the wicked
overthrown, as has been foreshewn; and yet this also done, before he sit on
his Throne, and reign, and the Saints reign with him. Oh that our Brethren
would consider this.

4. As the Saints must not reign before their Master and Lord Christ, and that
he receives from the Father, and they receive from him the Kingdom; so likewise
must they not reign one before another. If Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, etc. must
not have it before us; Heb. 1.40. 1 These 4.14 18.2 These. 2.1, 2.
much more should not we look for it before them; nay, not the surviving on
Earth, see or enjoy before them that sleep in the Lord: when we are all
gathered together unto him, then, and not till then, shall our reigning be. Oh
that our Brethren would consider this!

3. Such, as though they confess this reigning of the Saints not to be till the
personal and visible appearance of Christ, yet they look for some glorious
manifestation of the Sons of God, whereby they shall be known from other Men,
of what different Opinions soever they be, and in what different Forms of
Church Government soever they live; and so they shall be eyed, and may be
advanced to some honorable places in this World, before the personal coming of
Christ: surely the Belief, and minding of the Testimony of Christ concerning
his personal coming, as set forth in the Scripture, would help our Brethren to
keep from the thoughts or desire of such honor to themselves before their
Masters coming; Dan. 12.4. and 1^.32-35. Mat. 24 12.
for though knowledge shall abound, yet wickedness and Seducers will abound
also. And whatever shaking of worldly Powers, and burning of the Whore, and
destroying of the Body of Antichrist, there shall be; yet the Beast in the
worldly Powers, and the false Prophet, 2 These. 2.8. Rev. 19.11, 20.
with the Spirit of Antichrist, remains till the personal appearance of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and the cross of Christ is to be accepted till then: and the
Life of Believers, in respect of such glorious appearance, is hid with Christ
in God, and they in that respect dead, and not to look to appear in Glory, Col.
3.1, 2, 3, 4. Phil. 3.20, 21.
till he appear in Glory, that we may appear in Glory with him; which will be a
better Glory than that thought on to be had in this World; even a likeness to
him, which the Saints look for in his coming: besides, when the Sons of God are
so manifested, Ezekiel. 11.18, 19. Ephesians. 5.27. Act. 3.19, 20. 1 Cor. 1.8. Mal.
3.17, 18. Romans 8.19-23.
they shall not be of diverse Opinions, nor in diverse Forms of
Church Government, (as now in some things many may be) but of one mind and
heart, free from all spot of sin, shining in holiness: and this manifestation
of them, expressly said to be, In the day when he makes up his Jewels or special
Treasure, explained to be when the Bodies of the Saints are raised and become
immortal, and the whole Creation renewed: so, that as the Creature waits for
the manifestation of the Sons of God, Col. 3.4. Phil. 3-20. 1 John 3.2.
that it may then enjoy its Freedom; so the Sons of God wait for the
manifestation and personal appearance of the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ,
that he appearing in Glory, they may appear in Glory with him, and so be
manifested the Sons of God.

Thirdly, the knowledge and belief of the Testimony of Christ concerning his
personal coming in such manner, and to such ends as is said, is profitable,
being minded, to help and move all that believe in Christ: 1. To keep them from
inordinate loving, Rom 8.18.2 Cor. 4.17, 18. 2 Timothy 4 8.
and pursuing the Glory, riches or pleasures of this world, and to enable them
to count the cross of Christ, and sufferings for his sake, great riches; and so
to bear it with patience, and go through it with fortitude, etc. 2. To attend
upon, Mat. 28.19, 10. 1 Cor. 11.2, 26. 1 Timothy 6.13, 14. 2 Timothy 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5
8.
and hopefully use, all the Ordinances of Christ, according to opportunities
given, till he visibly and personally come again; that being the time of their
ceasing. 3. To long, and wait with patience in well-doing for this coming of
the Lord, Romans 8.23. 1 Cor. 1.7. Jude 21.
that we may be found ready and unblameable, at his appearing, Phil. 3.20. 1
These. 1.^^. 2 These. 3.5. Heb. 9.28. Tit. 2.13. 2 Pet. 3.12, 13.


And thus having gone over the three distinct Branches of the Testimony of
Christ; and that, so as I desire to have them beheld as one whole and entire
Testimony, I shall sum them up together.

CHAP. 21.
The Conclusion of this Part, in summing up the Testimony.

HAving treated distinctly of The Oblation, The Intercession, and The coming
again of Christ; desiring (...) Scriptures speaking of each, to be well minded,
I shall add a word or two, to show how all Three are included in one Testimony,
and are indeed one entire Testimony, even the Testimony of Jesus, that is, The
Spirit of Prophecy, and one included in the other, and all joined in one in
the Testimony in diverse places, set forth in one, John 3.16, 17. there is
affirmed the Love of God in the gift of his Son, in which the Oblation is
affirmed; and there is set out the End of his coming, even to save, and that he
might save: there is his Mediation, and Prevlency of it, in use of means to
apply, intimately affirmed; and there is the blessed Hope in his coming, for all
that obey his call, that they might not perish, but have Everlasting Life: so
is his coming again intimated,

2 Cor. 5.19, 20, 21. There is both the Oblation of Christ, verse. 14, 15, 19.
and the Fruit of the Intercession of Christ, verse. 18, 20. and the coming again
of Christ, verse. 10, 21. yea, all Three together, verse. 21. intimated.

Tit. 1.1, 2. There is the Object of Faith set forth in the Gospel, called, The
Faith of God's Elect, which is Christ, as he has offered the Oblation: and
there is the Fruit of his Intercession, in the acknowledgement of the Truth,
which is after Godliness: and there is intimate his coming again, in which is
given that hoped for, the Hope of Eternal Life.

And yet because his Oblation in his Humiliation and Exaltation, is the
Foundation of Faith, and the Key of Knowledge, and that which gives Light and
Understanding into all the whole Testimony; and being believed, lead; into all:
Therefore we shall find, That that is sometime only expressly named, and yet
the other two secretly in the same saying: and so with Inclusion of
Intercession and Hope of his glorious coming, when not named, Christ, as he
has offered the Oblation, etc. is named as the whole Testimony: 1 Cor. 2.2.
so Paul summed up all the Gospel and Doctrine he determined to preach to the
orinthians, to this, even Jesus Christ, and him cruci^^^: where the Oblation is
express; the other, included. And again, he summed up the Gospel he preached,
and which Believers received, and in which they stand, and by which if they
keep in remembrance, they are saved, 1 Cor. 15.3, 4, 5.
to this, How that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures: and,
that he was buried; and, that he rose again the third day, according to the
Scriptures: and, that he was seen, etc. In which the Humiliation and Exaltation
of Christ, is comprehended; his Oblation, express; his Intercession, and coming
again, included in that saying, According to the Scriptures. And such a brief
sum explicated, 2 Cor. 5.14-24. And so in such a brief sum, the Love of God to
Mankind is testified: 1 Jo. 4.9, 10. Verse. 14. Ioh. 3.14, 15, 16, 17.
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his
only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is
love, not that we loved God; but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
propitiation for our sins. And again, shorter: and the same was in like manner
testified by our Savior, and that also as the Ground of Preaching the same for
Men's healing: and as the Oblation and Love of God to Mankind, appearing
there-through, is sometimes named for the whole Testimony; so, in some places
it is shown, how this known and believed, saves and leads into all Truth,
and so teaches Believers: I will instance but two places.

1. Tit. 3.4, 5, 6, 7. read, and consider the place, and see, it is the
kindness and love of God our Savior toward man, (it is not said, Joh. 3.16.
his special and peculiar Love to some Elect, but the pity and love of God to
Man-ward) that in its appearing saved us; not according to works of
righteousness which we have done, (it neither appeared or saves by any thing
in us or done by us, Romans 3.9, 25. and 5.6, 8, 9, 10. 2 Cor. 5.20. Ephesians. 2.16,
17.
in which we were better than others) but according to his mercy (that is, his
Love commended to sinners in his giving Christ to die, and make peace for them
by his Blood, when we were Enemies; and causing it to appear to us, while we
were such, and no better than others) he saved us, (that is, reconciled our
hearts, and converted us to himself;) and this saving, by the washing of
Regeneration, (that is, the virtue and efficaciousness of the Blood and
Oblation of Christ, by means of his Mediation made known to us; and his Love
there-through streaming, Romans 5.1-5. 1 Pet. 1.2. 2 These. 2.13. Heb. 9.14.
being by the Holy Ghost set home to the Heart: and so also) by the renewing of
the Holy Ghost, (who in such discovery, as is said, sprinkleth the Blood of
Christ in the Heart, and thereby speaks peace, and creates or renews a new
Disposition or Spirit in the Heart. Romans 3.22, 24, 25, 26, 27. and 4.5, 23, 24,
25. and 5.1-11.
) Which washing of Repentance, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, he (by virtue of
his Oblation once offered, and his Intercession continued, the Divine Love
appearing there-through) shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Lord,
that we being justified by his Grace, (now mark the last end, in which his
coming again is intimated) we should be made Heirs according to the Hope of
Eternal Life. 1 John 4.9.10.


Thus does the Love of God to Mankind, appearing through the Oblation of
Christ, lead to see and enjoy the Ends and Virtues of his Oblation, and therein
the Benefit of his Mediation and Intercession; and therewith, and thereby, the
Hope of the Inheritance, and Eternal Life, in the coming again of Christ: so
precious is the word of the beginning of Christ, to lead into all that follows
to be known of him.

2. Tit. 2.11, 12, 13, 14. read the place and mind, The Grace of God, Tit.
3.4. 2 Cor. 3.18. Phil. 3.7, 8.
(which is the same with the kindeness and Love of God to Man-ward) saving to
all men, (or bringing Salvation to all Men) has appeared (so, as in its
appearing and saving Operations, it) teaches us (here is the benefit of his
Mediation, in extending the Virtues of his Oblation) that denying ungodliness
and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and righteously, and godly in this
present world, (now mark the last) looking for the blessed hope, and the
glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ. And all this
large Grace appearing in such saving tendency, with such teachings, and fitness
for prevalency therein, grounded and bottomed upon the Word of the beginning of
Christ, verse. 14. Who gave himself for us, etc. with which I began this
Discourse of the Oblation, Intercession, and coming again of Christ; and with
the same I for this Part end.

In all that is said of the Testimony of Christ, in every Branch, and of all
together, it appears, That this Testimony is a Doctrine according to godliness,
and has its natural tendency to godliness, effecting it in all cordial
Believers of it: and also, that this Testimony of Jesus, is, The Spirit of
Prophecy, The Original of all right Understanding, The true, and so best,
Enlightner, Teacher, Schoolmaster and Director to all right understanding and
speaking.

And ignorance and unbelief of this Testimony, or any Branch of it, specially
the first, is the cause of all error: and mistakes about Scriptures. And by
this Testimony minded, we may discern what true Faith is, what the Object, what
the Medium discovering; what the Believing is, and how it works: But I
forbear to proceed farther in those things, till I have first minded the
degrees of the Revelation of Christ in this Testimony of him, and how it was
revealed, evidenced, and so made known and taught by degrees, till the whole
was clearly manifested, to be so now taught and believed.

An Explicit Declaration of the Testimony of Christ, etc.
PART III.
CHAP. I.
Of the first Revelation of Christ, and Way of making him known.

THE first Revelation of Jesus Christ was in Paradise, thus: Genesis 3.15.
I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her
seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel. In which,
according to Explication since, is observed,

1. That the first Promulgation of the Gospel, as it was immediate from and by
God himself, so it was done in the denouncing the Curse on the Serpent and his
Seed; yea, Genesis 3.1.14, 15.
in some measure on the Serpent that was the Devil's Instrument, and its Seed;
but in full, and specially on the Devil the old Serpent, with his Angels, Rev.
12.9. and 20.2. and 8.13. and 9.12. and 11.14-18.
and those by his Temptations, become of him, and so his Seed, even as the
completing of the Exaltation of Christ, and those that are his Seed; is
declared in the denouncing and bringing in the last and great Woe upon the
Inhabiters of the Earth, which are the Seed of this old Serpent.

2. Genesis 3.16, 17. Romans 5.18. Heb. 9.27.
That the Seed of the Woman is also so expressed, that it may have a double
sense; one a more remote sense, in which it may be carried to all that come of
her by a natural conception; before whom, in the Promise, Hope was set; and of
and from among whom, the two Seeds more directly spoken of, are and will be
drawn.

And the other sense proper and nigher, and that both principal, full, Genesis
3.15. Psalm. 49.7, 8. Isa. 7.14. Mat. 1.22, 23. Luke 1.30, 34, 35. Gal. 4.4 Mat.
1.1. Romans 1.3. Gal. 3.16. 1 John 3.5, 8. Heb. 2.14.
and most clear and direct; and that is the Lord Jesus Christ; for he says, It
shall bruise thy head. It was not thus: The Woman, nor any of her Seed by
natural conception (which are every way as much the Seed of Adam, the Man, as
of the Woman) of which, no Man can redeem his Brother, or give to God a Ransom
for him: But it was, He, even Jesus, that was conceived in the Womb, and born
of a Woman and a Virgin, in a supernatural way, without the help or use of Man:
which Virgin was of the Seed of Abraham and David, to whom also, the Promise
was explicated: and so he was the Seed of David, of Abraham, of the Woman; the
promised Seed, even he that in due time was manifested, to take away sins, and
destroy the works of the Devil. And the Holy Ghost has given us to understand,
That this Jesus is that very promised Seed here primely meant. Gal. 3.16, 29.
Isa. 53.8, 10, 11. Psalm. 72.7, 8, 9, 14. and 89.29, 36
And also here is, in and with this principal, a farther, intimate, necessary,
consequential and included sense; namely, That by Seed is meant all those of
the Sons of Adam, that by this Grace of God discovered through Christ the
promised Seed, are brought in to believe in Christ, and by Faith united to
Christ, and reckoned after him, his Seed, and so of one and the same Seed, the
same spiritual species or kind, to enjoy the benefit of all his sufferings and
victory, and to inherit with him.

3. Luke 24.26, 46, 47.
The way in which Christ should take away sins, and destroy the works of the
Devil, and so enter into Glory, even by suffering and conquest, by Death and
Resurrection, Heb. 2.14. Col. 2.14, 15. Psalm. 63.18, 21. Rev. 12.11. Act.
14.22. Genesis 3.15.
and pouring forth of Spirit, and returning again to triumph: and the way in
which those that come to be of his Seed, must overcome and inherit with him,
being by the word of the Testimony of him, and by his Blood, not loving their
lives unto death; and so through much Tribulation, to enter into his Kingdom.
Both these are implied and testified in the very words, It shall bruise thy
head, and thou shall bruise his heel.

4. That as there is enmity between the two Seeds; yea, Rev. 2.8, 9. etc Mat.
13.25, 28 1 Pet. 5.8. Joh. 8.41, 44. Genesis 3.15. Jude 4. Romans 5.14. Ephesians. 5.31,
32. Col. 2.14, 15. Ephesians. 2.16. Joh. 16.11. Psalm. 68.18. 2 Cor. 4.4. 1 John 5.8.
Phil. 2.10, 11. Isa. 45.23. Genesis 3.15. Jude 14, 15.
according to all the whole sense given us, that is, between Christ and the
Devil; and so enmity in the Devil against all Mankind, preserved by Christ:
but especially those of Mankind, that are by the Grace of God through Christ,
converted, born from above, and so become the Seed of Christ; yea, he moves
all he prevails with to do his will, to be Enemies to them also: and so there
is enmity between the two Seeds also, as is express, I will put enmity between
thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: (where also might be
noted, That as Adam in his public place, was a Type of Christ; so the Woman
here a Type of the Church) even so also, as Christ came first in the flesh, and
by his sufferings and victory in his Oblation overcame the Devil, and overthrew
his first work; so he is by Spirit overthrowing his second work, in which he
endeavors to keep men from the knowledge and acknowledgement of Christ: and he
will come again in glory, and fully destroy his later work also, and bring all
before him to acknowledge him Lord, to the Glory of God: and then shall the
Devil and all the ungodly, be overthrown; and he, and his Seed shall reign: all
which was included in this saying, It shall break thy head. And this was opened
to, and prophesied by Enoch the seventh from Adam; and so, though mysteriously,
yet inclusively, the whole Testimony of Christ was given in this first
Revelation.

5. That the fullness and cleerness of the glorious mystery of Christ, and life
in him, contained in the Gospel, Joh. 1.18.4-9. Heb. 1.1, 2. 1 John 1.1, 2, 3.
and 3.5.
as first declared, was yet hid with Christ in God; and so to be farther
opened, as Christ came to be farther manifested: and this implied in that word
also, Genesis 3.15. Col. 3.3, 4. 1 Ioh. 3.22.
It shall break thy head: as the glorious life of Believers is still hid with
Christ in God, and will then be manifest, when he shall appear in Glory; when,
and not till then, they shall appear in Glory with him.

6. Here in this Revelation, is no mention or intimation, That the promise in
this Gospel, was made, given or applied personally to Adam or to Evah, to both
or to either of them, or any probability of such a thing: for in all this, the
Speech was directed as the Curse to the Serpent, Genesis 3.14, 15. Jude 6. Genesis
3.16, 17, 18, 19. Romans 5.12, 18.
with intimation of the continuance of his malice, chains and limits till his
full overthrow and final judgment: and the sentence of the Curse, in sorrow,
mortality and death, is in the Speech directed both to the Woman and the Man
after this, and the Curse on the Earth, for their sakes also; and so on all
Mankind in this first public Man: but the promise was fore-made to Christ,
that now had undertaken, and intimated here in this word, Genesis 3.15. Isa. 50.5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Ioh. 17.2.
It shall, etc. The Promise for that divine assistance he should have in all he
had undertaken to suffer and do, in the Nature of Man for Mankind; and the
Victory he should have; and so, that Eternal Life he should have in the Nature
of Man and for Mankind, to dispense to all that by the means he uses, believe
on him: so that all the promises of God are his, 2 Cor. 1.19, 20.
and in him yea, and in him Amen. The Promise of Eternal Life was made with him
first; and with, and to him, Tit. 1.2, 7. 1 Ioh. 5.11. Gal. 3.17. Ioh. 1.12. 1
Ioh. 5.12. Isa. 49.8.
for all that in believing come to receive it of him: yea, the Everlasting
Covenant was first made with him, and confirmed in him; and so by necessary
consequence, for all that should believe in him, and so have him; and in having
him, have with and through him Forgiveness of Sins, Asstance in Services and
Trials, the Promises, Everlasting Covenant, and Eternal Life; and so all that
is good for them. This is the way of God's giving such good things to Men, to
give his Son to them, Romans 8.32. Gal. 3.13, 14, 15, 16, 26, 29. Isa. 9.6. and
53.8, 10.
who was fore-delivered up for us all: and in giving him, with and through him
to give the Blessing and all good things, so to Abraham, and so to all other.
And thus is Christ the Everlasting Father of all Believers, and they are his
Generation or Seed. And in this respect also Christ is the firstborn, before
David, Jacob, Isaac, Abraham; yea, Adam and Evah: yea, in this respect and
relation, he is the Root and Father of them all; yea, Rev. 22.15. Ioh. 8.56, 58.
he is the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last,
the Beginner and the Accomplisher of every Man's Faith, and bringing in to God:
and so of theirs also. And though in his actual taking of Flesh, and so as Man,
he was after them and of them; yet the virtue of his Oblation was efficacious
with God, and virtuous for Men, from his first accepting to undertake, and so
from the beginning, even in the first moment of Adam's Fall; and so he the
first Receiver and Dispenser of the Promises: which in denouncing the Curse on
the Serpent, were thus sounded forth in the hearing of Adam and Evah. And the
knowledge of all this, is very profitable for us, seeing by it we are taught so
clearly,

First, That the Gospel thus sounded was not by Adam or Evah received by sense,
or by discerning of any peculiar interest they had in it more than others of
Mankind, or any betterness in them more than others; but by the Divine Power
in the discovery of God's Love to Mankind, without any difference of one from
another, or preferring one before another, they, as fallen Ones, received it by
Faith; in which, it became theirs: and so receiving it by Faith, according to
the import of the sound, and the Light that was in it; thence Adam in this
sight and receipt, called his Wives Name Evah, because she was the Mother of all
living: and this might well be in a twofold sense; natural, of all Adam's Race,
because there was hope for them; and spiritual, of all Believers, she happily
being the first Receiver, according to that, Where sin abounded, there grace
abounded much more.

Secondly, That the Sentence and Curse did pass on them after the Promise and
Interposure of Christ the new public Man, he having fore-accepted to be in
that Nature, and under the Law under which they were fallen, that so he might
come and bear that Sentence and Curse for Mankind, and so take the sting and
venom out of it, and in due season bring them out: and this also was without
difference, for the good of all Mankind.

Thirdly, That the promise in the Testimony and sound, lies as open and free
for all Mankind and every of them, as it did for Adam and Evah, that they
might believe, and in believing be the Seed of Christ, and Children of their
believing Mother Evah, and so have the same hope.

Fourthly, That we may know, That as the Gospel for the good of Mankind, was
first declared in denouncing the Curse on the Serpent and his Seed: so all the
Threats and Curses denounced on the Enemies of Christ and his People, they are
Fruits of God's Love, and sure Promises to Believers. And this was the first
Revelation given of Christ.

Now also for Evidences and Demonstrations of the Truth and Goodness hereof,
besides this revealed Testimony of God, it is to be seen in his works of
Creation and Providence: Psalm. 75.3. Col. 3.17, 18. Joh. 1.3, 4, 5. Heb. 1.2. 1
Cor. 8.6. Psalm. 19 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Romans 1.19, 20, 21. Act. 14, 17. Deuteronomy.
4.19. Psa. 147.15, 16, 17.18. Psa. 145.8, 9, 17. Jer. 5.21, 24. Heb. 11.6. Romans
2.4. Romans 10.18. Col. 1.23. Act. 4.17.
for whereas all was lost, and so for sin to be so far dissolved, as every
Creature remaining, to have been as a Curse, Vexation and ruin to Man; that
the Heavens and Earth, with the Inhabitants are upheld, and that Sun, Moon,
Star, Earth, etc. do serve for the good and comfort of Mankind, It is through
Jesus Christ, and by virtue of his Oblation and Intercession. And so now, and
from thence, The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament shows
his handiwork. Day unto day utters speech, etc. And by these works of
Creation and Providence, God shines forth, and manifests to Men his Eternal
Power and Goodness, his Being or Godhead, his Wisdom and Love to Mankind: and
these he has divided to all Nations under the whole Heaven, to serve them for
their good, and to such a gracious end: and by these he gives hints of a
Ransom and Mediator between him and men; through whom, he that is holy and
just is yet so merciful and gracious to sinful and unworthy men, even that they
might believe him to be, and to be merciful, and a Rewarder of them that seek
him, and so repent, and come in to him; and so far, and in such a sense, the
sound of the Gospel is preached in and by the Creation in the whole Earth, and
so in and by every Creature under Heaven, to all Nations and every Man. And
these two, the rumor of the Gospel as declared in Paradise, and the Evidences
of his Goodness in the works of Creation, were the two Mediums or Books, in
which the Testimony of Christ has been held forth from the beginning, and is
to be read.

Yet God did even at the first, in this provision made in Christ, for Men, and
for instructing them in this Revelation and these Evidences of him, he chose in
him certain Instruments, whom he furnished above others with the Knowledge of
the Gospel, as so revealed, and also with Understanding of his Power, Wisdom,
Justice, Mercy and Mind, evidenced in his works, that they should teach the
same to others, to convert them to God. And these were those who themselves
received the Testimony, and were by it led to love and worship God, and desire
the Salvation of men; as all the first Fathers, Adam, Seth, etc. who all
preached to the World the same Gospel (though not so fully come forth) as we
now have: it is in respect of the more full and clear Demonstration of it, by
the Apostles called, a new Commandment; 1 Ioh. 2.7, 8. and 1.1, 2, 3.
and yet in respect of the thing it self, the old Commandment, being the same
that was from the beginning. And all those first Fathers from Abel to Abraham,
are affirmed to have said such things, and to live and die in the Faith
thereof, Heb. 11.2, 13, 14. yea, all these were Preachers in the World, Adam,
Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methusala, Genesis 5, and 6.
Lamech; yea, all these at one time, sometime before Noah, Adam, Enoch and
Seth, being departed before the time of Noah; but Enos above half a hundred
years in Noah's time, and Cainan above one hundred, Mahalaleel above two
hundred, Jared above three hundred and a half, and Lamech and his Father above
five hundred years preachers in Noah's time, and Methusalah till the year
before the Flood came; and then, still Noah and Sem. What all these might do
for Gospel-preaching in the first Ages, who can say, with all that received it
of them? but preach the same Gospel they did: and so Noah preached, Enoch
prophesied, and in Enoch's time Men called on the Name of the Lord: so, as then
began a Profession of his Name, in which they were distinct from the careless
and profane Sons of Men. Such Teachers then provided:

And yet this is not all, for God did endue these Teachers with his Spirit, and
went forth with his Spirit in their Ministration, and the means he did use
toward them: 1 Pet. 3.19, 20. Genesis 6.3.
so Christ preached by his Spirit in the Ministration of Noah, and with his
Spirit did strive long with them; and that the Ministration and spiritual
Motions might take more place, he in his Providence wrought much for them and
with them, in sending about and stirring up his Servants to admonish and exhort
them, Romans 2.4. Psalm. 36.6, 7. Ioh 33.14, 15, 24, 29.
extending mercies to allure them, and while they did hang back, using
Judgments and Chastisements, to take down their pride, and break them off
their enterprise, and bow their Ear to hearken to the Voice of God in Christ;
so that God dealt graciously with the World at that time; and it was justly,
for great ungodliness and sinning against the mean; of Grace, overthrown with
Water. And the teaching of the Gospel thus revealed, and such Evidences in such
manner taught, Genesis 15.
continued, and was still vouchsafed after the Flood, to the whole World again;
and such, as before, the chosen Teachers, as Noah, Sem, Arphaxad, Salah, Eber,
Peleg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah, Abraham; and such as through their Teachings
were converted and fitted. And how many of these were living together or at one
time in diverse parts of the World, who can tell? But this we know, That Noah so
prayed for, and prophesied of Sem, that implies no less, Genesis 9.27.
than that the Church should be in his House, (as God uses to put his Word in
his choice people, that are his House, that it may sound forth from them, to
bring in others.) And Sem lived five hundred and two years after the Flood; so
that if he did not outlive Abraham, yet he was living on the Earth, when
Abraham offered up Isaac his Son; and he was a Priest and Teacher of God in the
Church, and for, and to the whole World: I will not determine, That he was
Melchizedec, that blessed Abraham, though probabilities of it enough might be
given: nor will I say any thing more of Arphaxad, and the rest; but, That the
Gospel thus revealed and rumoured, and the Goodness of God in his works of
Creation and Providence thus evidenced, being thus taught by those Elders that
feared God, was, for the good of all Men, and saving to them, and such as did
receive the same, and abide therein, were saved thereby, I suppose none
questions. And if we proceed a little farther to the time of Job, Job 19.25,
26, 27.
which very probable was before Moses; however, not in that part of the World,
where the Children of Israel lived: and what knowledge he had of his Redeemer,
we may read; and what way they then looked for, and found, the Knowledge of
God, their own words testify: Bildad says, Enquire, Job. 8.8, 10.
I pray thee, of the former ages, and prepare thy self to the search of their
Fathers, etc. shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of
their heart? Job 15.10.
And Eliphaz gives this as the Reason of their Knowledge, With us are both the
gray headed, and very aged men, etc. and how profoundly they spoke of God from
the Teachings they had in the works of Creation and Providence, the story
shows; Job 25, and 26, and 27. Job 4.12.21. and 33.14, 15. and 35, and 36, and
37, and 38, and 39, and 40.
though some particular enlargement in use of that Knowledge, they had by
visions also: yea, Elihu gives his Instructions to Job, from the great works of
God: and the Lord himself did also even by his works instruct Job: so that the
Love of God to Mankind in providing a Redeemer, as declared in Paradise, in
the hearing of all Mankind, as then in being in the first public Man, to be
taught and rumoured to all the World, and the Evidences and Demonstrations of
his Goodness in works of Creation and Providence, that all might look to him
and be saved: and such as were through the hearing and discerning of his
Goodness, brought in to believe in him, and live to him; those his elect and
chosen Instruments to teach the Knowledge of God in these two Mediums unto
others. Whence also Moses, when he writ the Law, yet says, Remember the days
of old, the years of Generation, and Generation; Deuteronomy. 32.
ask thy Father, and he will show thee; thy Elders, and they will tell thee.
And the Truth revealed in the beginning, and the Evidences of it in works of
Creation and Providence, and the Teaching of the Truth from both the Revelation
at first given, at the Evidences continued, by those graciously brought in, and
chosen into the acknowledgement of it, that others might still come in, 1 Pet.
2.3, 5, 9.
has been God's approved Way from the beginning, and so remains to the end
of the World: and though other Revelations followed, yet it was still but the
farther opening the same Truth: and though other Ordinances and Officers were
afforded, yet it was for farther helpfulness, Mat. 19.8. Ioh. 1.1, 2, 3, 4. 1
Ioh. 1.1, 2, 3.
and no exclusion of these first chosen from bearing forth his Name: and so our
Savior teaches us to have respect, for assured Truth and Goodness, to that
which was from the beginning. And so the Apostles also avouch of their
Doctrine, It was from the beginning: and so the Love of God to Mankind,
evidenced by Word and Works, taught and shown forth by Believers, has been
from the beginning. Too blame was he, that, now farther Light is come, would
have denied the Death of Christ for All Men, by saying, Christ died not for
Cain; for he came not of Cain: for Christ came not of Abel, nor of Joseph or
Levi, the Sons of Jacob, etc. Yet sure Christ not only died for these, but
they were saved by him also: and as for Cain, if he was not one that Christ had
accepted to die for, his Father would not have instructed him to offer
Sacrifice: nor would God have so expostulated with him, and told him, In doing
well, Genesis 4.3-7.
he should have been accepted. His woe came by his own stubbornness, 1 Ioh. 3.12.
in becoming of the wicked One. And all the Fathers mentioned from Adam to
Noah, are as much the Natural Parents of all Mankind now living, as Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob were of old Israel: and that God had a merciful end in making
all Nations of Men of one Blood, Genesis 17.26, 27. Ezekiel. 18.31, 32. and 33.11.
Psalm. 36.7, 8.
that they might seek him; and so in converting any, that they also might seek
to convert others, is affirmed; and still the prevalency of this Grace in the
Heart, is that in which the blessing is met with.

CHAP. 2.
Of the second Revelation of Christ, and way of making him known.

THe second and more full Revelation of Christ, and so the Gospel concerning
him, was by God himself immediately to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob at several
times.

If any demand, But why was not this Revelating given to Melchizedec?

I answer, How much was revealed to Melchizedec, is unknown to us: Job 33.13.
nor does God answer or give account of his matters: therefore I list neither
to enquire nor study to give an answer, unless this may be taken as one given
of God, because that Melchizedec was the highest and choice Type of the Eternal
Priesthood of Christ, greater than Abraham, the Blesser of Abraham, figuring
out Christ as the Chief, the King of Righteousness, and King of Peace, etc. And
Christ knew all, and needed not this Revelation, Heb. 7.1-25. Ioh. 1.18. 1 Ioh.
2.20.
but was one with the Father in revealing, and he in and by whom it was
revealed, he being greater than all, the Blesser, and Anoynter, etc. But I
shall consider what of the same Testimony of Christ fore-revealed and taught,
was now more fully revealed to these three, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: and this
was, 1. That whereas the Nations were now multiplied and divided, and many Men
and Families in them all, it was hard to know, in whose Loins the promised Seed
(Christ according to the Flesh) was; and so, out of which Family or Man, (for
there were many, even of Sem his Posterity also) Christ should come. This was
now immediately revealed by God himself to Abraham, saying, In thee shall all
Families of the Earth be blessed. And, In thee, explicated to be meant, Genesis
12.3. Genesis 22.18. Genesis 26.4. Genesis 28.14. Gal. 3.13, 14, 16, 26, 29.
In thy Seed: and so to Isaac after. And again, the same in both Expressions to
Jacob. And this Seed in the personality of the Man, as the Root and Fountain of
blessing, affirmed to be Christ; and in the multiplicity and union in enjoyment
of the blessing in him, to be all that unfeignedly believe in Christ. 2. That
in this Seed (which is Christ) all the Nations, Genesis 22.18. and 26.4. and 12.3.
and 28.14.
yea, all the Families of the Earth shall be blessed: which can be no less,
than that there is blessing prepared and given in him for all Nations; that in
minding of, and believing in him, they might receive it, according to that Isa.
45.22. and 49.6. Act. 13.47. 1 John 5.11, 12. and 2.2. and also, That in
believing on his Name, every of them so believing, do receive, and shall
participate of the blessing, according to that Joh. 1.12. and 3.16. and also,
that there is a time coming, in which all the ends of the World shall remember,
and turn unto the Lord, and worship before him, and sing unto him, according to
that Psalm. 22.27. and 66.4. and 86.9. 3. That for multiplying of this spiritual
Seed, in bringing Men into union with Christ, Genesis 13.16. and 17.6, 12, 13.
Exodus 12.48. Deuteronomy. 1.10, 11. and 10.22.
he told Abraham, That he would multiply to him a Natural Seed, a great
Company, that should come forth of his Bowels; and others, by gracious
providence, or proselyting, be put into, and made of his Family; that so, out
of much or many People, a spiritual Seed may be drawn, according to that Act.
18.10. 4. That God by his blessing and Spirit in the means he would afford him,
Genesis 15.5. Romans 4.13, 14, 18. Isa. 53.8. Romans 8.16, 17. Ioh. 17.21, 22. Genesis
12.3. and 28, 15.
would multiply to him a spiritual Seed; in such number, that no Man shall be
able to number them: and that all this spiritual Seed, shall in all their
increase and numerousness, be one Seed still; yea, so spiritually one, that
Christ, and those spiritually united to him, are joynt-Heirs, and in a measure
alike beloved of God with the same Love: so that God will bless them that bless
this Seed, and curse them that curse it, either in the Head or Members. 5. That
whoever of any the Sons of Men, do in hearing and believing this preparation of
Blessing and Life God has made for us, Genesis 15.5, 6. Romans 4.13, 14, 16, 18,
22, 23, 24, 26. Gal. 3.6, 7, 9, 26, 29.
and given us in Christ, so mind it, that they are thereby led to believe in
him, for the Promise of Eternal Life, and the Inheritance which is yet to come;
so walking as strangers on the Earth in that Faith and Hope, it shall be
imputed to them for Righteousness, and so they counted of the spiritual Seed.
6. That Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with the Man Jesus Christ, Genesis 13.15, 17.
and 19.18. and 26.3. and 28.13. 1 Chronicles 16.16, 17, 18. Psa. 105.8, 9, 10, 11.
Heb. 11.9. Isa. 65.17. Gal. 3.8, 16.
and all his spiritual Seed, shall one day enjoy, in a heavenly, pure,
peaceable and joyful manner, all that very Land much enlarged, which Abraham
saw, and had Liberty to, and did walk in the length and breadth of it, and
sojourned with Isaac and Jacob therein; and so the Holy Ghost teaches us to
understand it: but then it will be renewed, and so a new Heaven and a new
Earth. And so was Christ revealed, and the Gospel preached to Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob, these three Fathers. And it was confirmed in Christ to them, by a
free, absolute and everlasting Covenant, immediately made with them by God,
that gave to them an outward Covenant in the Flesh, as a sign of the
Righteousness of the same Faith, for them to testify with also to others; of
which remains to be spoken in treating of the Covenants.


And for the way of making the Gospel thus revealed, known to others, to draw
them in to God, it was even all that mentioned in the first Revelation, and the
farther Teaching of this revealed Explication, with the Promises and Covenant
made, for which God did choose and approve of these three primely; yea, first
and chiefly Abraham, and after and with him Isaac and Jacob, who, though his
Sons, yet were with him the Fathers naturally of all Israel, and spiritually of
the faithful among them, and in all Nations following. They the first that
received, and taught, and walked in the Faith of the Gospel and Covenant, as
thus explicately revealed and come forth. And they, besides the former helps
they had in common with all that feared the Lord, as forementioned, were yet
more abundantly furnished, 1. By God his immediate speaking to them, and making
this Everlasting and sure Covenant fore-confirmed in Christ, personally with
them, for themselves and their Seed. Whence he is said to make his Covenant
with Abraham, and to remember his Covenant made with Abraham, Isaac, Genesis 17.1,
8. Psalm. 105.8, 11. 1 Chronicles. 16.15, 16, 17, 18. Lev. 26.42. Psalm. 25.14.
and Jacob, and confirmed with an Oath to them, for them and their Seed, for an
Everlasting Covenant to them and their Seed. And the Children of Israel willed
to remember the Covenant so made with those three. And God in promising to do
the People god, says, He will remember for them his Covenant made with
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with the residue of his Seed. No mention yet that it
was or is (though one day in performance it shall be) personally made with
them; but only the same shown to them; And enabling them as Abraham's Seed, to
believe his performance for Abraham's sake: and no otherwise was this Covenant
made with any that is made known to us, till it was with David more explicitly
in respect of the Kingdom: but to these three it was so made, and they thereby
so abundantly furnished to teach it. 2. They were marvelously and
supernaturally enlightened in the knowledge of it, in their believing: so that
Abraham saw the Day of Christ, Joh. 8.56.
and rejoiced, (and we may suppose the same of Isaac and Jacob, though our
Savior had not occasion then from the Jews words to mention them) so that they
were abundantly fitted to preach this Faith and Covenant unto others. 3. They
had also an outward Ordinance called Circumcision, as a sign and seal of the
Righteousness of the Faith they had received, Genesis 17.9-14. and 18.18, 19.
Deuteronomy. 30.6. Romans 4.11, 12, 15.
and were to teach; that they might so witness the Truth, and disciple their
Children born of them, and by gracious providence brought under their tuition
and government; and so teach them to attend on God in his way, who in such
attention would in due season circumcise their hearts, that thus they might be
the Fathers of all that believe. 4. They were enabled by Faith to walk as
strangers in this very promised Land, Act. 7.4, 5. Heb. 11.9.16.
not building Cities in it, nor having of their own the possession of a foot,
(only a burying-place bought with their money) yet did they believe to enjoy
that very Land according to the promise; and by the preparation of it for them,
and Promise of it, and Gift of God to them, believed, they did wait, and look
for it: in which Faith, they both lived and died; believing, That they should
be raised again, and possess in due season. And so as Abraham at first in the
Faith of the Gospel, as set forth in the first Revelation, went at God's Call
into that Country, not knowing whither, Heb. 11.8.
till he came there, even by Faith: so he lived and walked in that Land by
Faith, as farther enlarged, according to the Revelation explicated to him in
that Promise given him again and again. Genesis 12.2, 3. and 13.15. and 15.4, 5,
6. and 16.16. Genesis 21.5. Genesis 25.26.
And after the Covenant was made with him, he lived and walked in that Land, by
Faith enlarged according to it, for one year himself; and after with Isaac all
his days: and he with Isaac, and Isaac with him, lived in this Faith all the
days of Abraham: and Isaac was sixty years old when Jacob was born, with whom
he then lived in that Faith all his days: and Jacob that was with him, and
after him lived in that Faith with his Sons, was an hundred and thirty years
old, when he stood before Pharaoh in Egypt. Genesis 47.9.
So that their sojourning in the Land of Promise, or promised Land, which they
are one day to possess, was one hundred ninety and one years after the Covenant
made. In which time, they taught the Faith thus enlarged to their Children, and
them so to live in it: which remained with the spiritual Seed. But after Israel
was come into Egypt, they began quickly to be defiled with the Idolatries of
Egypt, and then they sojourned (not in the Land of Promise as their Fathers
did, but) in the Land of Egypt four hundred and thirty years, Exodus 12.40, 41.
Gal. 3.17, 18.
of which four hundred and thirty years after the Fathers living in the Faith
of the Covenant one hundred ninety one years, the Apostle speaks, for so long
it was still confirming to them; and they in being so furnished, have taught
the same.


CHAP. 3.
Of the third Revelation of Christ, and way of making him known.

THe next Revelation of Christ was in Moses time, Heb. 1.1.
and it was both immediately to Moses, and mediately by him to Israel: and this
was in diverse manners, and at diverse times, or by diverse parcels: as to say,

1. By diverse types, shadows, and figures immediately appointed by God to Moses
for the people, Heb. 8.5. and 9.23. and 10.1.
and mediately by him to the people: as to instance,

1. Heb. 7.27. and 9.7, 12, 22.
The way by which Christ should make Peace and Atonement for the sins of Men,
that he might have them into his dispose. This was figured out by Beasts slain
and offered to God in Sacrifice for sin, and the High Priest entering into the
Holy of Holies once in the year to make Atonement for all Israel: as Christ was
by his death and bloodshedding for our sins, and offering himself a Sacrifice
to God, entering into Heaven by his own Blood, to make the Atonement, and
obtain eternal Redemption.

2. The way how he communicates unto Men, this Peace and Atonement, Heb. 9.13,
14. and 12.24. Rev. 1.5.
and Redemption, and makes them partakers of the benefit thereof in the
extention of his Grace and Spirit, making it known with the Fruits thereof,
gaining in to believe; and so sprinkling the virtue of his Blood and Sacrifice
on their Heart and Conscience, thereby washing and comforting them: this
figured by sprinkling the Blood and the Water of Purification on them with a
Bunch of Hyssop. Psalm. 51 7.
Whence that Prayer, Purge me with Hyssop, etc.

3. Heb. 7.25. and 10.2, 19, 20, 22. Ephesians. 2.17, 18.
The way how people may come to, and partake of the benefit of all this Grace
in him and by him dispensed, namely, by looking to him, attending his Voice,
approaching to God by him, through his Sacrifice and Propitiation made, yield
to and receiving in by Faith, his Blood sprinkling, and Water of Purification,
so drawing nigh to God by him: this figured by their so looking to, and
approaching to the Tabernacle, and observing those Rites aforenamed.

4. That Christ is wonderfully filled with Power, Spirit, and Authority, and
all riches of Grace, to be all to us, and work all in us, for Peace, Purity,
Union and Communion with God, he having our Nature in a personal Body, in which
he has by Sacrifice made the Atonement: and the fullness of the Godhead now
dwelling in him bodily, Joh. 2.19. Col. 2.3, 9. Joh. 2.19. Joh. 5.20. Joh.
14.6. 1 Pet. 2.3, 4, 5. 2 Cor. 6, 16. Heb. 3.6. Heb. 8, 5.
He is the Tabernacle, Temple or House of God, in whom are all the Treasures of
Wisdom and Understanding; in whom dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily: in
and through whom only God is to be worshipped: and such a House he is, that all
that believing in him, are united to him, and worship God in him, are made of
the same spiritual Tabernacle, Temple, or House. This figured by their
Tabernacle or Temple, made according to the pattern given of God, and the
Enjoynment of them to come and worship there, looking toward it.

He is also the Altar on which all Prayers and spiritual Sacrifices are to be
offered up to God. Heb. 13.10, 11-15. 1 Pet. 2.5.
This was figured by that one Altar, to which their Sacrifices were to be
brought, and upon it to be offered, and on no other.

He is the Propitiation, the Covering, or Mercy-Seat, Romans 3.25. 1 Ioh. 2.2.
Joh. 1.18. Heb. 9.5.
where all the Righteousness in Mercies and forgiveness, and the Oracles of God
are to be met withal. This figured by the Mercy-Seat they had in the Holy of
Holies.

He also is the great High Priest, Heb. 9.7, 12. 1 Timothy 2.5. Isa. 53.12. Heb.
7.25.
that once for all has made the general Atonement, and by virtue of it,
remains an High Priest of good things to come, interceding for Transgressors;
and in special manner, for all that come to God by him; perfuming their Prayers
with his Incense, and returning Answers of Blessings to them: and this was
figured by suchlike things appointed the High Priest to do for them: Heb.
7.13, 20. and 5.4, 5. Exodus 4.16, 27. and 28.1. and 40.12.
for Christ did not naturally descend from Aaron or Levi, or any of the Priests
of the Aaronical or Levitical Race, nor was he of that Order, nor was he called
by Men, Ecclesiastical or Civil to his Priestly Office; but was immediately
made and called to be a Priest by God himself; which was figured though most
lively, in Melchizedec, yet also in God's immediate calling of Aaron, to be
their first High Priest. 1 Pet. 2.2, 3, 4, 5, 9. Heb. 3.1, 6. and 13.10. Numb.
18.7. Heb. 7.12, 13. and 9.6, 7.
Jesus Christ has for his inferior ministering and spiritual Priests suitable
to his Order, those all, and only those, that through the Knowledge and Belief
of his graciousness are born from above, and united by Faith to him, and so
become one in and with him. And this also was figured by appointing those only
to be Priests, according to the Order of Aaron, which came of him, and were his
Sons by Birth in a natural descent; any many other types and figures, which I
here omit; only I will mind one general Type more, for,

5. Act. 26.17, 18. Ephesians. 2.3, 4, 5. Col. 1.12, 13. 1 Pet. 2.9. 1 Ioh. 5.19. 2
Cor. 4.4. 1 These. 2.18. 1 Pet. 5.8. 1 John 3.8. Mat. 10.17. Joh. 15.19. and
16.33.
The manner and time of God's beginning to manifest the things of Christ, and
dispense thereof to the Souls of men, namely, when by the Ministry of Christ
in the Gospel, he calls them out from the Power of Satan, the Prince of the
Air, and therein out of the darkness and bondage of, and Union and fellowship
with the world, that lies in the power of the wicked one; at, and against
which, the Devil rages and labors to oppose: and the World led by him, is
angry, and joyneth with him in oppositions, by deceits, pressures and
persecutions; yet those that follow the conduct of the Spirit in the Gospel,
believing in the Blood, and accepting of the Cross of Christ, Romans 3.25. Gal.
6.14. Rev. 12.21. 1 Pet. 3.21. and 2.7. Mat. 21.44. Luke 20.17, 18. Gal. 5.11.
Phil. 3.18. Prove. 8.36. Isa. 54.15 Exodus 5, and 6, and 7, and 8, and 9, and 10,
and 11, and 12, and 14.
are through the same, even in shame and sufferings, saved, and so brought into
the Wilderness, as being strangers to, and in this World, and on the way to the
heavenly rest, while the Enemies and Persecuters are by the same appearance of
God in the Cross of Christ, tumbled back and overthrown: and all this typed out
by God's bringing the people out of Egypt by Moses, and the rage and opposition
of Pharaoh in his oppressions, and cruel withstandings of Israel, and the
Egyptians joining with him therein, to keep them from departing out of Egyptian
servitude; and when they were led out, pursued them, to bring them back again,
till they were overthrown in the same Sea, by which God preserved Israel, and
brought them to believe his word, and sing his praise.

And this saved people that then believed his words, and sang his praise; some
of them in minding his goodness were united by Faith to the word of the Lord;
and so had a Spirit of Faith, Exodus 19.5.
and followed the Lord; and these were his Elect and Chosen: some deviated from
the Faith, waited not for his counsel, and so believed not his words, but fell
a lusting, and so to murmuring, and tempting God, and provoking him with
grievous sinning, Psalm. 106.15, 18. 1 Cor. 10.1, 6, 11. Jude 1, 4, 5. Heb.
3.14, 19. and 41. 1 Pet. 2.7, 8, 9.
and were according to the height of their provocations, overthrown and
destroyed in the Wilderness. And these were types and figures of the different
demeanor of many brought out of the darkness of this World into the Light of
the Gospel, and the Faith and Profession of Christ, and so of God's different
proceeding with such; and so who are his elect and chosen, and whom he will
reject and reprobate. All these and much more was shadowed out by types and
figures to Israel, and remain in the Record instructive to us; and though Types
be short of Truth it self, and have their dissimilitudes also, yet what by
similitudes they were to shadow out, is really true, and to be found in the
Truth, which is Christ, and the things of Christ: but they had not only
discovery by shadowing types and figures, but also they had,

2. A more clear Revelation of the Gospel, and that was by an immediate
inspiration of it to Moses, and a mediate Declaration of it by the Spirit of
prophecy in Moses to the people, and this with some Explication of the Gospel,
forepreached concerning Christ, and now also, 1. Concerning his person, that he
should come in the flesh, that he should come of one of those very Israelites,
Deu. 18.15, 18, 19. Act. 3.22, 23. and 7.36. Joh. 1.41.^5.
that he should be very Man, that he should be like unto Moses the great
Prophet and the Mediator, having nearest familiarity with God, knowing the
whole mind of God; and that he should be meek, patient, loving, merciful and
faithful, and declare all the counsel of God; and that they should hearken to
him; and whosoever hearkened not to him shall perish. A Prophet, says he, will
the Lord thy God raise up to thee, from the midst of thee, like unto me, etc.
2. Concerning all true Righteousness and Eternal Life, that it is to be found
in Jesus Christ, that promised Messiah, Deuteronomy. 30.10, 11, 15. Romans 10.4, 10.
Deuteronomy. 17.26. Gal. 3.10. Heb. 7.19.
and received by Faith in him, whose work for Mankind is so complete, his
Goodness and Grace so evidenced, and extended so nigh to the heart, that there
needs no enquiry for any other help or strength, but only believing according
to the Demonstration given for that end; and that the end of the Law given, was
in one part of it, to discover the righteous Affections and Services, to which
men were by it obliged; that seeing their sins, and desert of the Curse, they
might be humbled, and say Amen to the Curse sentenced: and yet, without inquiry
of any other imaginary help, look to Jesus, that was to come, and believe in
him, which was typed out to them in the other part of the Law, that in
observance thereof, they might without resistance in those observances look to
Christ typed out by them, and believe in him, and look to him: and this was the
right doing of his commands: for the end of the Law for Righteousness is
Christ. 3. Concerning the Kingdom, that God will judge his people, Deuteronomy. 32.36,
43 and 33.26, 27, 28, 29.
and avenge the Blood of his Servants, and appear in his excellency for their
help: And then Israel shall dwell in safety alone, and a fountain of Jacob upon
a Land of Corn and Wine: also his Heavens shall drop down dew. Happy thou, Oh
Israel; who is like unto thee, Oh people saved by the Lord? etc.


Now the Revelation of Christ thus far come forth in the three Branches of the
Testimony of him, the means and instruments approved of God for making all this
known, that Men might discern, and believe, and enjoy the benefit of this Grace
of God, and come to enjoy the Hope given, that, and those fore-approved from
the beginning remain so still, Deuteronomy. 32.7, 8. and 6.6, 7. and 11.18, 19. Exodus
26.11. Deuteronomy. 2, and 4, and 5.15. and 4.31, 32. and 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 21. Gal. 3.19.
Lev. Numb. Deuteronomy. 2. Cor. 3.11, 13.
that is, the Report by the Elders of the Gospel fore-given, the Fathers
teaching the Children, and Neighbors one another; and all to consider the
works of Creation and Providence, and to remember the Covenant made with their
Fathers, and God his remembrance thereof, and now farther to remember and heed
the Covenant that God has made with them, which he did not make with their
Fathers, that they may mind and observe the ends and uses of it; that so in
obedience to God, they obey their Mediator, and Lawgiver, and Prophet Moses,
and attend the Ministration of their Priests and Levites, and observe and do
all the Statutes and Ordinances appertaining to them, about the Tabernacle,
Altar, Sacrifices, and Purifications, till the Truth of all came to be
fulfilled in Christ, in whom the Truth remains for ever.

But now, as the Revelation was more full, and the Ordinances and Observances
more than before: so God in Christ, for this Revelation of him, chose some more
peculiar instruments for this Business also, to teach and lead the people to
the right knowledge and observance of all this, that they might enjoy the
benefit: and these chosen Instruments were,

Moses to be the Lawgiver, and Mediator, and Prophet, to begin and set all in
order to and for them, as the Record is plain he did, and how he was furnished
with near familiarity with God, and inspiration of his Spirit and Mind, and
enabled to know and write both all this Revelation and Law, and all that was
meet to be known from the Beginning of the Creation: and with what wonders God
confirmed all his Doctrine, is to be seen in those five Books writ by him: in
which, Luke 16.29, 31.
though his Person was taken away, yet he in that Prophecy, Narration, and Law,
and Instruction for Faith and Observance, continued with them in all Ages, till
Christ came.

Aaron and his Sons, and the Levites to help; and so the Priests and Levites,
for ministering about the holy things in Sacrifices, Incense-Burning,
Atonement-making, Purifications, Numb. 8.1, 7. Deu. 33.8, 9, 10, 11.
and suchlike Temple-Services, for themselves and for the People; and also to
teach the People the Laws thereof.

And these were not only chosen, but furnished also, even with spiritual
blessings of Pardon, Purity, Deuteronomy. 10.8. and 21.5. 1 Chronicles. 23.13. Ephesians. 1.3, 2.
Heb. 9.13, 18, 23. Psa. 51.7.
and Consolation for themselves and others, to bless in his Name; yet were they
not so blessed with spiritual Blessings in spiritual things in heavenly places,
so spiritually to dispense blessing, as the first Trusters in Christ after his
Resurrection were: but the spiritual Blessings they were blessed with to
dispense, was in material things in earthy places, which of themselves did
reach but to the purifying of the Flesh. And the spiritual Blessings were
received in looking up through these to Jesus, that as then was to come to
fulfill the Truth typed: but material and earthy things to minister with, they
had; and so were furnished therewith, having a material Tabernacle or Temple,
a material Altar and Mercy-Seat, Laver, Incense, Sacrifices, Purifications,
Order of Priests and Levites; yet were not these all in one (as the spiritual
things the first Trusters in Christ had) but each distinct from other: Ephesians. 1.3.
their Temple was not their Altar, nor their Altar their Laver, nor any of
these the Mercy-seat, nor any of these the Sacrifices, nor the Incense, nor any
of these the Purifications; nor yet were any of these the Priests, but the
Priests to minister these; and they all distinct, each by it self, not the
other: and for the furtherance of Faith and Obedience, they had some Prophets.
And these writings of Moses, with their Prophets; and these instructions of the
Fathers, Elders, and godly Ones, all Israel, and all that fear God, are ever to
attend to. And all this Temple-Worship, in Sacrifices, and Purifications, and
Observances in attending the Ministration of the Priests and Levites, according
to the Mosaical Institution, were all Israel to attend and observe, till Christ
came and offered up the acceptable Sacrifice: Heb. 10.1, 9. Ier. 31.32. Heb.
8.8, 9.
and in that attention, blessing was to be met with, and God would be an
Husband to them; but if they despised, would not regard them: and in these
things they were preferred before all other Nations.

And though this was an abasement to the Gentiles (till Christ his first
coming) for their slighting and abuse of all the means so long continued to
them, and a taking down of their pride; yet was it not an exclusion of them
wholly from Eternal Salvation: for if, according to the Demonstrations of the
goodness of God in the Light and means he afforded to them, Act. 10.34, 35.
Romans 2.6, 7, 8, 16.
they or any of them (though the light and means were small, in comparison of
these) did repent, believe, and so fear God; such were accepted, and should be
eternally saved: yet did these means given to Israel, exclude all other Nations
from fellowship in the Commonwealth of Israel, Ephesians. 2.11.
and so from having a right and open profession of God in his true outward
worship, and enjoyment of such instructives and ready means to come to Christ,
and so to God by him, unless any submitted themselves to come in to them, and
be circumcised, (which was free for any Nation to do; Exodus 12.48, 49
) and so they should be one with them, of the same Family and Nation, have the
same Law, and the same Privileges: Psa. 147.19, 20. Romans 3.2. and 9.4. Romans
2.13, 17, 29. and 9.6, 7, 8. and 3.9.
so that great were the Privileges of Israel above all Nations, for the means
vouchsafed to them, to know and enjoy God, and his Name put on them, and his
presence with them: so as to them was given the Word, Statutes and Oracles of
God; to them pertained the Adoption, the Glory, the Covenants, the giving of
the Law, the Service of God, and the Promises; so that Salvation in the Promise
was nigh them, that in minding it, they might be born of the Promise, and so
receive the Adoption by Faith, and live to God, and be eternally saved, as were
all the Children of Promise: but such as did not so believe, and receive his
words, etc. should not be eternally saved. So far the Testimony of Christ was
then revealed to Israel; yet it pleased God after, to give to them some more
clear revelation of some particulars concerning Christ, that were at first
included, and already hinted forth in the same Testimony.

CHAP. 4.
Of the fourth Revelation of Christ, and his Kingdom.

IT pleased God yet further to enlarge and clear up more this Revelation of
Jesus Christ to David, and by him to Israel; and to David he revealed the same,
both by inspiration to himself, and by Vision, and also by the Spirit of
Prophecy in Nathan for some part: and so we find revealed,

1. The Oblation and Sacrifice of Christ, Psalm. 40.6, 7, 8. and 22.14, 18. and
26.7. and 16.10, 11. and 68.18, 20. and 110.11.
and therein his Sufferings, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, sitting on the
right hand of God, and pouring forth the holy Ghost to men, that they might
turn, etc.

2. The operations of his Grace in a blessed Man, Psalm. 1, and 15, and 24, and
32. Psalm. 98.
and his preservation of him; and what true blessedness is.

3. The coming again, and Kingdom of Jesus Christ; yea, if, as those skilful in
the Hebrew say, the Book of Psalms is divided into five Boeks, the first ending
with the 41. Psalm, the second with the 72, the third with the 89, the fourth
with the 106, the fifth with the 150; We do mind and perpend, every Book of
them speaks of all these things; and so of the Testimony of Christ in every
Branch of it, in one place or other. And thence it is they are so often spoken
over again in the whole Book of Psalms: but that I have specially to note in
this Revelation, is the more explicit Revelation of the Kingdom then ever was
before. And so for the Kingdom, the King and his reign; by his Spirit in Nathan
he said, 2 Samuel 7.10.
I will appoint (or ordain) a place for my people Israel; and will plant them,
that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more, (and they shall
dwell in their place, and be moved no more) neither shall the children of
wickedness afflict them any more as afore-time, (as at the beginning, 1 Chronicles.
17.9, 10.
and since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and
have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.) Morever, I will subdue all
thy enemies. Furthermore, also the Lord tells thee, 2 Samuel 7.11.
That he will make (or build) thee an House. This is not like the Promise of
the Law, Deuteronomy. 5.2, 3, 4. and 28. and 4.31. Heb. 4.6, 7, 8, 9. and 11.9, 16.
Psa. 39.12.
and Covenant made with the House of Israel; but altogether gracious, free and
absolute, like that made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And here also it is
evident, That Joshua gave them not the Rest in Canaan, according to that
promised to Abraham: and it is also evident, That though David was now reigning
over Israel in Canaan; yet he had it not according to the Promise made to
Abraham, but in that respect counted himself a stranger in it, as all his
Fathers were. And this is manifested, all Israel never yet was so planted in
it: and so it is a thing to come, that shall surely be: and the House here
promised, is neither the Tabernacle built by Moses, nor only the Temple after
built by Solomon, (though these were types) nor was it only to have a great
Name, 2 Samuel 7.9. 1 Chronicles. 17.8. Heb. 3.3, 4, 6. and 8.2, 5, 6. and 11.10, 16.
2 Samuel 7.12. 1 Chronicles. 17.11. Heb. 11.13, 14, 15, 40. Dan. 12.13.2 Sam. 7.16
with a great and famous Posterity, to be great according to the great men on
the Earth; for so David was already: but an House not builded by men according
to the directions given of God; but built by God himself, and his Son Jesus
Christ: and so also an heavenly City of God's building and making, and not
Man's. And it farther appears, That before this be done, David must die in the
Faith, and sleep with his Fathers, and rise again, and stand up in his lot, as
Daniel; and then that will be fulfilled, which God promised David, saying, And
thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: 2 Samuel
7.12.
thy throne shall be stablished for ever. And so we are led to understand that
is said, 1 Chronicles. 17.11.
I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and
I will establish his kingdom: (thy seed which shall be of thy Sons.) Take both
expressions, and it will appear, That this in the figure or type was meant of
Solomon; but in the Truth it is clearly and evidently meant of Jesus Christ,
Mat. 1.1. 1 Chronicles. 17.11, 12, 13, 14.
the Son of David and of Abraham; and so it is said, I will raise up thy seed
after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will stablish (he says not
their, but) his kingdom; he shall build me an house, and I will stablish his
throne for ever, the throne of his kingdom; and I will be his Father, and he
shall be my Son; and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from
him (that is, Saul) that was before thee: but I will settle him in my house,
(that of my building) and in my kingdom, (that of my immediate giving) and his
throne shall be established for evermore: (which was never yet performed to any
of David's natural Race, that said) if he commit iniquity, etc. May show the
justness and removing those that were types; but is no let to him that is here
principally meant; which is Jesus Christ, that came of David in a supernatural
way. And so David by the Spirit understood, saying, 2 Samuel 7.19, 29. 1 Chronicles.
17.16, 17, 25, 26, 27. Luke 1.31, 32, 33, 35. Heb. 1.5.
Thou have spoken also (that is, besides the present house he had) of thy
servants house (he says not only to continue, but) for a great while to come:
and so his following prayer includes both: and it is affirmed expressly to be
meant of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, and the Son of God, that this Kingdom
and Throne is to be given to him: as for those natural Sons of David of that
Kingly Race, if they had not committed iniquity, they might have held the
earthy Kingdom till Christ had come: but iniquity being found, they came to a
lessening of the largeness of their King, and so to captivity, etc. such, as in
which the Covenant seemed made void, yet the Truth remains in Christ and to
him, and at his coming will be completely fulfilled, as according to all this
vision Nathan spoke to David; yea, God spoke the same in vision to David, Psalm.
89. 1 Chronicles. 17.15. Psa. 89.19, 20, 29, 30, 37.
how he would exalt him; and there brings in Christ under his Name, as he had
before done to Abraham, and shows how he will beat down his Foes, and make him
higher than the Kings of the Earth; how his Seed shall endure for ever, and his
Throne as the days of Heaven: yet here in this Life, if his Children forsake
God's Law, and walk not in his Statutes, he will visit their Transgressions
with the Rod, and their iniquity with stripes, but his mercy he will never take
from him, nor suffer his faithfulness to fail; his Covenant he will not break,
etc. once he has sworn, etc. he shall have his Seed still, and his Seed shall
endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sun before him, it shall be established
for ever; 2 Samuel 23.3, 4, 5.
and of this he speaks, Psalm. 132.11, 18: and also in 2 Samuel 23.1, 5. where
mentioning the Ruler, what a one he shall be, and the excellency of his Reign;
David confesses his house in his own personal Reign, was not so with God; nor
in his natural Race, did the Lord make it so to grow: yet says he, He has
made an everlasting Covenant with me, (he says not, with my house, as then it
was, but with me) ordered in all things, and sure; and professes for himself)
this is all my salvation, and all my desire. And David by the Spirit filled
with the Knowledge of this Kingdom of Christ, God did still by inspiration of
his Spirit reveal to him, and he by that Spirit spoke of Christ the Anointed,
the true David and Solomon; the Son of David, the Son of God, the great King,
of him he saw and foretold.

The great opposition and raging conspiracies that would be against him in his
first coming in the flesh, Psalm. 2.1, 2, 3. Act. 4.25.
and spiritual evidencing thereof, to draw men in to him: and this by Jews,
Gentiles, Rulers and People.

The great sufferings that he should undergo by great and small, Psalm. 22.7,
18. and 69.12, 21.
their laughing, scoffing, shaking the head at him, piercing his hands and
feet, parting his Garments, giving him Gall and Vinegar to drink, etc.

The Treason of Judas, Psalm. 41.9. and 109.2, 3, 4, 8. Act. 1.20.
one of his chosen Apostles, and the overthrow of that Traitor that rewarded
evil for good.

His Death and Resurrection, Psalm. 16.8, 9, 10, 11. Act. 2.31. and 13.33.

His doing the whole will of God, and so ascending to Heaven, Psalm. 40.7, 8, 9,
10. and 110.1. and 68.11, 18, 20. Heb. 10.5, 6, 14. Act. 2.33.
and offering the acceptable Sacrifice, and then sitting at the right hand of
God, receiving immeasurable fullness of Spirit in the Man, and for Men; and so
extending thereof to the rebellions, that he might dwell with them: and to that
end, raising up many Preachers to declare his Name, etc.

His coming again, Psalm. 2.6, 9. and 149.4, 9.
and sitting upon his Throne and reigning, and the coming of his Saints to
reign with him, and the great overthrow he and they all shall give to all the
worldly Powers that stand against him; and then the flourishing Estate of his
Kingdom in Jerusalem, and over all the Earth: and this largely in the last
Psalm, which he sung, and committed to the Church, Psalm. 72.1, 16.
and most probable at the same time with that 2 Samuel 23.1, 5.

Yea, Psalm. 102.16.
the time of this his building up Sion and reigning, to be even then when he
shall appear in his glory.

All this, and much more, with the gracious requirings and operations of this
Grace believed, was revealed to David; and he being filled and furnished with
the Holy Spirit, has declared the same, and left it upon record in the Book of
Psalms, and so I leave it and the residue, for such as desire the same, to read
there. And so there was now a great explicit and clear Revelation, in which
also was opened and interpreted to them the meaning of, and the Truth typed by
their Sacrifices and other figures and shadows; yet it pleased God still to
give more revelation of Christ, and to explicate the Testimony in particulars
more.

CHAP. 5.
Of the fifth Revelation of Christ, and the things of Christ.

IT pleased God by his holy Spirit to be still revealing Christ, and the things
of Christ, in and to the following Prophets; 1 Pet. 1.11, 12. 2 Pet. 1.20. Luke
1.70. Act. 26.22.
and by them to Israel and Judah, and that so fully both of his first coming
and second coming, that there is nothing of the things of Christ, as then to
come, but it was revealed to and by them: as to instance some:

1. The Messenger that should go before his face, or in his presence, to
prepare the way before him; Mal. 3.1. Mat. 11.10. Isa. 40.3, 8. Joh. 1.16, 20,
23, 29. Mar. 1.2, 3.
and the Doctrine in crying down all flesh, and exalting the word of the Lord
by which he should do it, and the sudden coming of the Lord on the appearance
of this Messenger, which is now evidenced to be John Baptist.

2. His own first coming and living among men, his Ministry, Sufferings,
Victory, and Works, in each particular, Isa. 9.6. Luke 2.11. Jer. 23.22. Gal.
4.4. Isa. 7.14. Mat. 1.23. Isa. 11.1. Luke 1.27, etc. Mic. 5.2. Mat. 2.5. Ioh.
7.42. Jer. 31.25. Mat. 2.16, 17, 18. Isa. 61.1, 2, 3. Luke 4.18. Psalm. 69.9.
Ioh. 2.14, 17.
as to say a little, his birth into the world, of a woman, a Virgin of the
House and Seed of David; his birth in Bethlem-Ephratah in Judah; yea, his
flight into, and return out of Egypt, Hosea 11.1. Mat. 2.15. and the slaughter
of Rachel's Children on that occasion in Bethlem. His return to Nazareth, and
manner of living among men, Isa. 53.2, 3, 4. Mat. 2.23. Luke 2.51. Joh. 1.46.
and 7.52. Mar. 6.3. His Ministry, his Miracles and Patience, Isa. 42.1, 8.
Mat. 12.1, 18. His Parables, Psalm. 49.1, 4. and 78.2. Mat. 13.35. His Zeal for
purging the Temple. Zach. 11.12, 13. Mat. 26.15. and 27.3, 9. Isa. 53.7, 8, 10,
11, 12. Isa 7.14. Mat. 1.23.
His Meekness and riding on an Ass, and a Colt the Fool of an Ass, Zach. 9.9.
Mat. 21.1, 10. His being sold for thirty pence: the scattering of his Disciples
from him, Zach. 13.7. Mat. 26.31, 56. His being scourged, and crucified between
two Thieves, Isa. 50.6. and 53.12. Mat. 27.26, 38. Yea, his Death, Burial and
Resurrection, and his Sacrifice offered: his being filled with knowledge; and,
his Mediation on that account, or by virtue thereof: yea, his being God-Man in
one Person, Emmanuel, God with us.

3. That in respect of all this which he has suffered and done, Isaiah 28.16.
1 Pet. 2.5, 6. 2 Cor. 5.19, 1 Cor. 3.11. Act. 4.11. Isa. 49.6. and 45.22. 1 John 4.14. Act. 13.47. Isa. 42.6, 7, 8. Luke 2.31, 32. Gal. 3.16, 26, 29. Romans
8.23, 25.
and is thereby become and fitted, and ready to do; God would in and by the
Gospel of him, lay him in Sion for a Foundation, that by Sion he might be so
discovered to others, that whoever believes on him should not be ashamed: and
so he would clearly declare, and set him forth for his Salvation to the ends of
the Earth, the Savior of the world; that all the ends of the Earth might look
to him and be saved. And,

1. To give him, in making him known to be a Light to the Gentiles, even to
such as are blind, deaf, and so dead, and know him not, to open their eyes and
ears, and move in their hearts, that they in beholding and believing might come
in to him, and so receive a spiritual birth, and become of Abraham's Seed.

2. And for a Covenant to the people, that receiving and enjoying him by Faith,
they might in knowing and enjoying their interest in him, know and enjoy their
interest in the Everlasting Covenant for the inheritance and Kingdom made with
and confirmed in Christ first, and in and through him with Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob, David, for them and all the spiritual Seed, who in believing in Christ,
are interessed in the same, and receive a spiritual First Fruits thereof, that
they may with assured hope, wait for the fullness till another Day; when in
performance it will be made with them.

4. the second coming of Christ in his glorious return, when he shall come to
reign, 1 These. 4.15. Col. 3.4.
and all his Saints with him, Zach. 14.9. And so,

1. That a little before his coming, Elias shall come to the Jews and
Israelites, Mal. 4.5, 6. Mat. 17.11, 12.
to turn the hearts of the Fathers (open the mind of the Prophets) to the
Children, and to turn the hearts of the Children to the Fathers, helping them
to understand and embrace, and so repent and turn; and so to prepare the way of
the Lord's glorious coming, as John Baptist came in the Spirit and Power of
Elias, to prepare the way of his first coming in the flesh in meekness: and so
our Savior affirms, both that Elias shall come, and is come. He that is
come, spoke of Mal. 3. He that still shall come, spoke of Mal. 4.

2. That before the coming of Christ personally, Hos. 14.1, 2, 3, 4. Zach.
14.1. Dan. 12.3, 11, 12.
the Jews and Israelites, even all the twelve Tribes of Israel, shall by some
instinct, or motion, or medium used by the Lord, be stirred up, and gathered to
Jerusalem, from all ends and quarters of the World, to Jerusalem in Canaan, and
be exercised with great wars and troubles, for about forty five years before
the coming of Christ.

3. At his coming he will work wonders, as he did in the Land of Egypt, and in
dividing the red Sea; so drying up Euphrates, Isa. 11.11, 12, 16. Jer. 31.8, 9.
Isa. 4.9, 18, 23 Jer. 31, 13, 15, 16. Dan. 12.2, 12, 13. Heb. 11.35. 1 These.
4.14, 18. Ezekiel. 37. Isa. 19.23, 24, 25.
and making way for the Israelites to come over, and move the hearts of many to
bring them: so that all, young and old, men, women with child, lame, etc. even
all of the twelve Tribes, both Israel and Judah, shall come and be joined in
one; yea, in his visible appearance when he is so come, those that sleep in the
Lord, whose bodies are in the dust, shall rise and be with them, not only
Abraham and all the Fathers before and since, but even the young children slain
in Bethlehem, and all that sleep in Jesus; both Houses of Israel joined in one,
never more to be divided, and of the Gentiles joined with them, a great
Congregation.

4. In his coming with all his Saints, and being so come, Isa. 11.4. and 9.5.
and 60.1, 12. Zach. 14.3, 16. Isa. 65.12, 17. Jer. 31.33, 34. and 32.37, 40.
Dan. 2.44. and 7.14. Isa. 9.7. and 24.23. and 66.5, 13. Zach. 12 6. Luke 1.32,
33.
he shall slay all the wicked, and overthrow the worldly Powers, even all that
will not serve him and his People, with the Rod of his Mouth, and the Breath of
his Lips: which slaughter will not be like other battles, where blood is shed
on both sides; for in this, the wicked only shall be destroyed with burning
and fuel of fire: which Battle fought,

Then will he make the Heaven and the Earth new, for his people to inhabit, and
make in performance the new and everlasting Covenant with all the People; and
then shall he receive the Kingdom from the Father, and sit upon the Throne of
David, even in Jerusalem: and all Nations shall be gathered to him, and serve
him, and he shall rule over them, Isa. 2.2, 4. Mic. 4.3, 4. Dan. 7.14. and the
Saints that come with him, shall rule under him, and with him; so as all the
Kingdoms under the whole Heavens shall be given also to them, Dan. 7.27. Isa.
32.1. and 14.1, 2, 3.

5. His Government shall be with Justice and Equity, full of Glory, Isa. 9.7.
and 11, and 60, and 65.14, 20 and 66.12, etc.
Peace, Plenty, etc. and all Creatures at peace one with another; yea, then the
everlasting Sabbath kept, and continual Halelujahs sung: but I must proceed no
further, unless I should transcribe a great part of all the Prophets, which all
that have an heart thereto, may read.

It is enough, that the Apostle affirms of the first coming of Christ, and so
of his Ministration, Sufferings, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, and being
contained in the Heavens till the time of the restitution of all things; Act.
3.18, 19, 20, 24.
and how in the mean time he spiritually sends Jesus Christ in the
Gospel-Ministration to bless us, in turning every of us from all evil ways:
and that he will in his times send forth this Jesus Christ that has been thus
fore-preached, to appear visibly; and that then the times of restitution and
refreshing shall be from his presence: and says, That not only Moses and
Samuel, but also all the holy Prophets that followed, have spoken and foretold
of these days, Romans 16.26. Act. 26.22.
(and so of these things) and that the mystery of Christ is by and according to
the Scriptures of the Prophets, made known for the obedience of Faith to all
Nations: and that they said no other things, but what Moses and the Prophets
did say should come: so that the Revelation was now exceeding great and clear,
and no more nor further Revelation vouchsafed, till the performance began, and
then of no other but the same things in cleerness and mystery opening,
manifested. And as God chose these Prophets, 1 Pet. 1.10, 11, 12. 2 Pet. 1.20.
Luke 16.29.
and furnished them with his Spirit to make known the Testimony of Christ
according to this Revelation; so they have left it on record in their writing;
in which it, and so they are still with us, in viewing of whose writings, we
may discern that all the Sriptures testify of Christ.

CHAP. 6.
Of the next and sixth Revelation of Christ, his person and personal coming in
the flesh.

THe next Revelation of Christ was of his person and personal coming in the
Flesh, who he was, what a one he was, and wherefore come, etc. and this was
first to Zacharias, by an Angel; Luke 1.13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
declaring his Son that should be called John to go before him in the Spirit
and Power of Elias, etc. him before whom he should go, the Angel, called The
Lord their God; then by the Angel to the Virgin Mary her self, declaring his
conception and birth; and who, Luke 1.26, 27, 35 Luke 1.41, 42, 43, 48, 55, 67,
68, 69, 79. Mat. 1.20, 21, 23. Luke 2.10, 11, 14, 16, 17.
and what a one he should be, and that he should have the Kingdom of his Father
David: then by the holy Ghost in the Prophecy of Elizabeth, my life of
Zacharias: then by the Prophecy of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of Jesus: then
by the Prophecy of Zacharias being filled with the holy Ghost: then by an Angel
to Joseph, the espoused Husband of the Virgin Mary: then to Shepherds by an
Angel, with a multitude of Angels confirming the same, declaring his birth,
with the day and place thereof; and that he is the Savior, even Christ the
Lord; and this tidings of great joy which shall be to all people. And then by
the Shepherds when they had both heard and seen, unto others: then by old
Simeon, who had it revealed to him, and was inspired by the holy Ghost, Luke
2.25, 28, 32, 35.
and came and took him in his arms, and declared him to be God's Salvation,
which he had prepared before the face of all people; a light to enlighten the
Gentiles, and to be the Glory of his people Israel. Luke 2.36, 38.
And then by one Annah, a Prophetess. And after all this, by certain wise men,
that came from the East to Jerusalem, being directed to him by a Star, Mat.
2.1, 2, 9, 10, 11.
who declared him born King of the Jews, and worshipped him, and offered him
gifts. And after all this, to John the Son of Zacharias, declaring this Jesus
to be The He, Joh. 1.31, 33. Luke 3.1, 2, 3.
The Christ, etc. to which John the Word of the Lord came at that time
mentioned.

Thus, and in many things now came to pass, according to fore-prophecies,
Christ was declared to be already begun to be come in the Flesh, and to be the
Son of God, and the Son of David, the King of the Jews, and the Savior of the
world, the great Prophet, and Messiah promised: and, that this very Jesus, that
was born in Bethlem of the Virgin espoused to Joseph, and seen of the
Shepherds, and taken in the arms of old Simeon, and witnessed to by Zacharias,
and John his Son; even this very Jesus is he, even the Christ, etc. and ready
to set on his work. And now the person of Christ thus come, and thus witnessed
and pointed out who he is, and that he was personally on the earth, and ready
to set on his great business doing; and that that very Jesus is he, is more
than ever was so revealed and manifested before, and the beginning both of the
performance, and the more clear opening of all the prophecies that have been of
him from the beginning, and so light began to shine forth more clearly.

And now in this Revelation of Christ, and for making him known according to
this Revelation, Isa. 40.3, 4, 6, 7, 8. Mal. 3.1. Luke 1.13, 14, 15, 16.17, 76,
79. and 3.15, 16. Joh. 17.20, 23. Luke 1.15, 44, 76, 78, 79. Luke 1,17.
to prepare men, that they might come into the acknowledgement of him, it
pleased God to choose in Christ the Messenger of the Father, and his own
Messenger also fore-purposed, and now declared to be his immediate Forerunner,
to go before his Face, to prepare his way: and him he approved for this
Ministration.

And for this blessed Ministration, he was abundantly furnished, in that he was
filled with the holy Ghost from his Mothers Womb; and was confirmed by all the
Declarations and Prophecies forementioned, given to him by the Spirit in the
Prophecies and Instructions of his Father, and was himself endued with the
Spirit and Power of Elias, to go on in his Ministration before the Lord; and
had the word of the Lord came to him, revealed, and inspired by God into him,
both in the Doctrine he had to teach, and how to apply it, to his hearers, and
also commission to testify the Truth of it, by baptizing with water. And in
this receipt of the Word of the Lord that came to him, he received his
Commission to set on the business of preaching and babtizing, and so did set on
it in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Luke 3.1, 2, 3, 4.
when Poutius Pilate was Governor of Judea, and Herod the Tetrach of Galilee,
and Annas and Caiaphas Highpriests; and what his Testimony and Doctrine was,
appears in that which is recorded, of what he taught and delivered, to be,

1. That Jesus Christ is the Word, that was in the beginning with God, that was
God, and that was with God, Joh. 1.1, 2, 3, 14. Genesis 3.15.
by whom all things were made, that are made; and that this same Word was made
Flesh, and dwelt among them, Emmanuel, God with us, in our Nature and for us,
even he that was promised and manifested to do that great work for taking away
our sins, and destroying the works of the Devil: 1 Ioh. 3.5, 8. Ioh. 1.4, 7, 8.
9.
so that in him is Life, and the Life is the Light of Men, and he is the true
Light that enlightneth every one that comes into the World.

2. That he is the only begotten Son of God, and yet very Man, full of Grace
and Truth: and being in the heart, Joh. 1.14, 16, 18.
mind and bosom of the Father, knowing all his counsels, and being one with
him in his will and design, and so in all his decrees and purposes; and as Man,
having commission from him, he has revealed and declared him so, as in knowing
him, his mind is to be known.

3. That he, the Man Jesus Christ, being the Son of God, Joh. 1.11
and perfect Man, the Mediator between God and Man, full of Grace and Truth,
declaring the Father, he is so loving to Man, and so bountiful to all that
receive his Declaration, and so believe on him, that he gives them of his own
Privileges, even to be the Sons of God, and so dispenses to them of his own
fullness; so that as the Law discovering sin and sentencing to death; and that
part of it also, which by types and figures in Sacrifices and purifications,
shadowing out a better hope to be looked to in Christ to come, though afar off,
came by Moses; even so Grace and free favor in forgiveness of sins and
delivery from death, and truth in receipt of, and enjoyment of true
righteousness, peace, quickening, purity, and heavenly riches came by Jesus
Christ, even in all times past; and so now more fully and clearly does; so, as
though he came after John, yet he is preserred before him; yea, he was before
him, so, as now he is come, John and all the residue of Believers, then and
since, even we of his fullness have received, and Grace for Grace: for the Grace
of God in Christ, by virtue of his Sacrifice, which God has graciously
accepted of him for us, we receive the Grace of Faith to believe, and therein
remission of sins, and so Grace for Grace; yea, this, and so one, to make us
meet to receive another, and that to make us meet to receive more still, and so
Grace for Grace, plentifully one heaped upon another: Tit. 3.3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Col. 1.12, 13. Joh. 1.15, 16, 17. Act. 26.18.
yea, as Moses had a Law of Works to nurture the people toward Grace; so we a
Doctrine of Grace, and Law of Grace, to teach and lead people to partake of
Grace.

4. That this Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God, (the sin-offering and the true
passover) which by virtue of his sacrifice mediating, takes (or bears) away
the sin of the world, Job. 1.29, 36. Col. 2.14, 15. Ephesians. 2.12, 13, 16, 17. Romans
5.18.
that by his own death and sacrifice offered, takes (and now has taken) sin
out of the way, removed the contradictions that were in the midway between God
and the world of Mankind, and made peace, that it may be preached to them; and
that by virtue of his blood and sacrifice, Isa. 53.12. 1 Timothy 2.4. Romans 2.4.
Romans 3.24, 25, 26. 1 John 3.2. Genesis 22.18. Act. 10.43. Romans 4.5. Mat. 3.2, 11.
has fullness, fitness, authority and readiness to take sin out of the
consciences and nature of Men; and by his Mediation procures forbearance,
patience and mercies to sinners to lead them to repentance: being he, and only
he, set forth for that end, the propitiation for the sins of the world, in whom
there is blessing for all Nations; and that by spiritual application of his
Blood, he does so take sin away from all that in believing come to him for it;
and that he is near at hand to set up his spiritual Kingdom, the forerunner of
his Davidical Kingdom.

5. That the Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hands,
Joh. 3.34, 35, 36.
and immeasurably filled him with the Spirit; so that whoever believes in him
has everlasting life; and be that believes not on him, the wrath of God
abides on him. This Doctrine was John filled with to teach.

And with this Doctrine he was to throw down the Momtains, exalt the Valleys,
Joh. 14.18, 29, 33. Mat. 3. Mar. 1. Luke 3.
cry down all Flesh, and exalt the Word of the Lord, and so to call Men to
Repentance and to Faith in Christ, and so to newness of life; assuring them,
that Christ would baptize them with the holy Ghost and as a witness of the
Truth of this Doctrine, and that Christ was at hand, and shortly to be
manifested to Israel, he did baptize with water unto repentance, and so
discipled all that came to him, and refused it not.

Yet did he not in the beginning of his Ministration, point out which of all
the Sons of Men was that Man that is the Christ; so he showed not which was the
Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, till he was especially fitted, and directed,
and commissionated for that also, by the direction of the holy Spirit, by
communication with Jesus Christ himself; Joh. 1.33, 34. Mat. 3.13, 17. Mar.
1.9, 10.11. Luke 3.21, 22.
and seeing the Spirit of God descending like a Dove, and lighting on him, and
hearing the voice of the Father from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased. And so was he furnished to know and declare the person
of Christ, as distinct from all others, and who he was.

And then he did most plainly point out the Man Jesus, Joh. 1.29, 35, 36. and
3.30, 36.
the Son of the Virgin, with confession, that not himself, and so no other Man
but that very Man Jesus was the He, the Christ, the Lamb of God, the King of
Israel, the Bridegroom, the Son of God; he, even this very Jesus, he pointed
to, and affirmed to the be very he, and so exhorted his Hearers to behold him,
even Jesus, and to follow him, cleave to him, and exalt him.

And in this his Ministration, he was greater than all the Prophets that were
before him, Mat. 11.10, 11.
though less than any of his Lord's first Witnesses of his Resurrection that
were to come after him; and although in the exercise of his Ministration, he
was but for the House of Israel, who, if they had received him as he came in
the Spirit and Power of Elias, they would then have received Jesus Christ also,
and so they might have enjoyed the Gospel of the Kingdom, and have continued in
their own Land, till his coming again to reign, and then John Baptist had been
all the Elias they should have needed; and the coming of Elias, mentioned Mal.
4. it would have been needful only for the ten Tribes of Israel, formerly cast
off; but they refusing, came to be cast off also, and so its needful for them.
And in this Ministration, Mat. 11.13, 14, 15. and 17.11, 12. and 23.37.
according to this Revelation, all the former helps, in and under all the
former Revelations and Ministrations still remained, and all for the good of
Men, specially the house of Israel.

CHAP. 7.
Of the seventh Revelation, and the last that shall be of Christ till his own
return, and personal and visible appearing.

THe next Revelation of Jesus Christ, and the last that is to be carried an end
for usefulness by teaching, and use of such outward Ordinances as now, even
until his personal appearance, when all such means shall cease, and the eternal
Sabbath be; Isa. 42.1. and 61.1, 2, 3, 4. Joh. 12.49, 50. Heb. 1.1, 2. and 2.4.
and this Revelation was by the Father to the Son, even to the Man Jesus
Christ, his Elect, upon whom he has put his Spirit, and by Jesus Christ to his
Disciples, God by his divine power bearing witness thereto, and confirming the
same: and this Revelation by Jesus Christ was of the same things fore-revealed
to, and by the Prophets, but now more fully and clearly manifested, with the
mystery more abundantly opened; and this his Revelation was in a threefold
manner, or by three distinct ways or means: 1. By manifestation of himself and
all that appertained to him to do in his first coming, by demonstrating the
same in the very act visibly, etc. 2. By his personal and bodily Ministration,
in a vocal and audible teaching the Gospel and the Testimony of himself in the
Prophets, and explicating it. 3. By pouring on his witnesses, and filling them
with the holy Ghost.


1. Of the first way of the Manifestation of Christ by himself.

Jesus Christ was manifested and did manifest himself in the very acting and
sensible demonstration in himself of all those things foretold concerning him
to be done in, upon and by him in his first coming; as to say, his immediate
coming on the appearing of his Messenger and forerunner, and so his conception
and birth, having the very nature of Man, born of a Virgin, (that never knew
Man) that was of the Seed of David, Abraham, Noah, Adam: born in Bethlem,
altogether sinless; yet having the weaknesses and infirmities of Man's Nature:
his flight into Egypt, (while Rachels Children were slain) his return to
Nazareth, and being called a Nazarite; his Baptism, with the Testimony of God
concerning him; his fasting, temptations, victories; his poverty and mean life
among men; his travelings, preaching, cures, miracles; his calling Disciples,
and choosing Apostles, and seventy, and sending them forth to preach; his being
persecuted by the Highpriests and Priests, Scribes and Pharisees; his being
betrayed by one of his called Disciples, and chosen Apostles; the scattering of
the rest from him; his agony and bloody sweat; his being arraigned, condemned,
scorned, and crucified between two thieves, the soldiers giving him vinegar
and gall, and parting his raiment; his bitter cry on the cross; his committing
his Spirit to God, and so his giving up the Ghost and dying, and so his death
and his burial by two rich Men, laid in a rich Man's tomb, in which never any
man before lay; his Resurrection the third day, and so victory over death; his
appearing to his Disciples after his Resurrection, being seen, and heard, and
felt by them, and giving commandments and commission to them, and blessing
them, ascended up in their sight to heaven, testified by an Angel, that he,
even the very same Jesus shall so come again, as they saw him go up into
heaven; his being received and set on the right hand of God; and his sending
forth the holy Ghost with plenty of spiritual gifts, testifying the certainty
of his coming again in glory, a glimpse whereof three of them had foreseen in
his transfiguration; so that he appeared to be, and to have suffered, and done,
and shed abroad all that God by the mouth of his Prophets had spoken of him
concerning his first coming: so that he has now fully come in the flesh, and
done all this work, and is not now a dying and doing it, or so to do it over
again; he has finished the work given him to do at his first coming in his own
person on earth; and in and by him is fulfilled all that the Prophets spoke
concerning the first coming of Christ; so, as in no other ever was or will be;
so that this Jesus is the Christ, and has been thus manifested, and so
manifested himself to be, and this manifestation given in, his first appearing
to the first Witnesses of his Resurrection, for all that should after believe
on him, that it was manifested by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ: 2 Timothy 1.10. Joh. 2.11. 1 Pet. 1.20, 21. Joh. 1.1, 2, 3. Act. 10.41, 42.
in doing all this is expressly affirmed, that it was so manifested for all that
(...), by the discovery of him and his spiritual operation, believe; is also
expressly affirmed, that it was manifested to these first witnesses in this
manner, who both heard, and saw, and handled him; is expressly also affirmed,
and that they declared that we might believe: and the things that were by the
Prophets so foretold and written of him (as has been foreshewn) being so
fulfilled and manifested in him, Act. 13. and 17.2, 3. and 18.28. Romans 16.26.
Luke 1.1, 2, 3, 4. Joh. 20.31.
they did according to the commandment of the everlasting God, make known him
to be the Christ, and make him known according to the revelation of the
mystery, by the Scriptures of the Prophets; and have written and professed to
write these things, that we might know the certainty of them; and so, that we
might believe, that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God; and that in believing
we might have life through his Name: and according to all this, Jesus himself
witnessed and affirmed also the Truth of John's Testimony concerning him; and
how by the works done by him, and by voice from Heaven, Joh. 5.33, 36, 37, 39.
the Father did bear witness of him: and how the Spirit in the Scripture did
bear witness of him, and that eternal life is in him. And this the first way of
Jesus Christ revealing and manifesting himself to his first witnesses.

CHAP. 8.
2. Of the second way of our Savior's revealing and manifesting of himself and
the things of him, to his first witnesses of it.

IEfus Christ, besides this actual manifestation, did also in his performance
and bodily ministration, vocally and audibly teach the Gospel according to the
revelation of the mystery to the first trusters in him, and witnesses of him
after his resurrection: and so he taught them;

1. That he is the Massiah, the great Prophet and High Priest, and King of
Israel, the Son of God, and the Son of David; Mat. 16.16, 20. Mar. 8.27. Luke
9.20. Joh. 1.41, 49. and 4.25, 26, 42. and 6.69.
the Christ, the Savior of the World spoken of by all the Prophets.

2. That for estecting his business in all his Offices, that he may be
manifested to be such a one, and thereby have a Seed, saved and justified by
him to serve him, Isa. 53.10, 11, 12. Psa. 68.18, 21. and 2.1, 9.
and to enjoy the Kingdom with him, and Nations for him, and them to reign
over, he must first suffer, and die, and rise again, and ascend into heaven,
and receive the fullness of the Spirit in the Man, and send forth of the same to
Men, that Repentance and Remission of sins may be preached in his Name to all
Nations; and so he on rightful terms judge all according to that fore-written
of him; and therefore from that time that he had instructed them, that he was
the Christ, Mat. 16.21. Mar. 8.31. Luke 9.22. Luke 9.29, 30, 31. Mat. 17.12.
Mar. 9.12. Mat. 20.18, 19. Luke 9.44.
the Son of the living God, the Savior of the World; he then began to show and
teach them, that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the
Elders, and chief-Priests, and Scribes, and be rejected of them, and be killed,
and the third day rise again; yea, this was spoken of between Christ, and
Moses, and Elias, in their hearing, when he was in his transfiguration before
them, and after on that occasion by himself to them, and often after on other
occasions; yea, he teaches them a reason of the necessity of it, namely, for
taking away sin, and overcoming death; and so having an innumerable generation,
according to that said Hebrews 9.22. and 2.14. and Isaiah 53.6.7, 8. and so he
taught, saying, Verily, verily, Joh. 12.24.
I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it
abides alone; but if it die, it brings forth much fruit: and so he plainly
taught them out of the Scriptures after his Resurrection, that it behoved
Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that Repentance,
and Remission of sins should be preached in his Name among all Nations, Luke
24.45, 46, 47.
beginning at Jerusalem; and in teaching this, he taught them many mysteries,
about the virtues, ends, and efficacies of his death, and that distinctly also;
as to say, 1. His death in one respect and end, was satisfactory for the
Remission of sins, to make peace and atonement with God for Men, Isa. 53.5.
Romans 5.18. and 14.7, 8, 9.
that they might be released from the first sentence and curse in the first
death into his dispose, that he might bring them out of that death, as was
prophesied he should, and is confessed he has done, and this he did teach them
often: Mat. 26.28. Joh. 6.51. Psa. 40.6, 8. and 49. 7, 8. Mic. 6.6, 7. Heb.
10.1, 10. Isa. 53.6. Romans 8.32. Psa. 40.6, 7, 8. Heb. 10.5, 10. Joh. 10.17, 18.
and in respect of this end, his death and ransom giving is unimitable by any
other; not in respect of this end did either Jews or Gentiles, Scribes,
Priests, Governors, People or Soldiers, lay on him our sins, and so for that
put him to death; it was God the Father that so laid our sins on him, and
delivered him to death for our offenses, and his own free offer to accept and
do the will of the Father for us: and this also our Savior himself taught
them. And in this offering himself, he had to do with God only, for Men; and
with God it is so effectual, that he has granted all this to him upon this
account, without any further business to be done by him for this grant; and it
shall be manifested to all Men so evidently one day, Psa. 2.10, 11.
that they shall acknowledge it true, and him Lord, to the glory of God,
whether now they will believe it, and in him, or no. 2. His death in one other
respect and end, was confirmatory and sealing, Heb. 8.8, 9, 10, 11. 1 Pet. 1.5.
2 Cor. 1.20.
that the New Testament of precious Promises of Forgiveness of sins, of
purifying the heart, and writing his Law in the inward parts, giving in eternal
life, and preserving by his power through faith unto the inheritance, might be
confirmed, sealed and stable, that believers might have a certain and
undeniable evidence of the performance of them all by him, in whom all the
Promises of God are Yea and Amen, Gal. 3.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, with Heb. 9.15,
16, 17.
to the glory of God. And this could nor be without the death of the Testator;
but by that, even the same death that was for Remission of sins, though in this
respect a farther end, it is done, and fully confirmed and sealed; but then
this death also is in some respect free from constraint; and so it is said,
Joh. 10.30. Mar. 15.39, 44. Joh. 10.32, 33. Heb. 9.14, 15. Romans 5.1, 2, 8, 10,
11.
While he was in his strength, and cried with a loud voice, he bowed down his
head, and then, and so gave up the Ghost, which caused the Centurian to confess
that he was the Son of God, and Pilate, and others to marvel that he was so,
and so soon dead, (for the Thieves that were crucified with him, died neither
so, nor so soon:) and as concerning this end, he is by virtue of his death;
etc. the Mediator of the New Testament, that Believers may enjoy the benefit
hereof: neither is his death in respect of this end imitable for any other:
Mar. 26.28. Mar. 14.24. Luke 22.20. 1 Cor. 11.25.
nor did the Scribes, Pharisees, etc. put him to death for this end: but he
freely laid down his life and gave up the Ghost; and so the Testament is
confirmed, and of force: and this our Savior himself plainly taught them. 3.
There was yet one other distinct end of his sufferings and death, which is also
expressed by himself, namely, to bear witness of the Truth, which he taught,
and this in love, Joh. 17.21, 23. Joh. 10.15. Joh. Joh. 10.11, 12. Phil. 2.8.
Joh. 18.37. Joh. 17.15, 16, 17, 18. Joh. 10.2, 3, 4, 15. Phil. 2.4, 5, 6, 7. 1 John 3.16. Joh. 13.14, 17. and 15, 12, 13. Mat. 20.25, 26, 27, 28. Ephesians. 5.1, 2.
Joh. 18.11. Mat. 16.24. 1 Pet. 2.20, 22, 23.
even to his Enemies, that they might believe, for whom, for that end he so far
prayed, as Luke 22.34. according to that in prophecy, Isa. 53.12. and in love
to, and faithful care over such as he had called and taught, being the sheep of
his own personal Ministration that heard his voice; and in love, obedience, and
faithfulness to his Father. This he professes to Pilat, saying, To this end
was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear
witness to the truth; every one that is of the truth, hears my voice: (as for
the same cause when he left the World, he left his Witnesses in the World.) And
in this he instructs his Hearers, and so he does his own Disciples, that all
good Shepherds may follow him herein, that as he, so we might not seek to be
Lords over one another, but to serve each other in love and in sufferings, when
for their good to put our selves in our Brethrens stead or place: and so laying
down our lives for our Brethren, according to his example; and this he plainly
taught to them: so that his death, in respect of this end, is moving, alluring,
and exemplary for us to imitate and follow him; and that also, in taking up our
Cross, receiving it as a Cup out of our heavenly Father's hand, in patient
bearing all, that for his sake (and by our Father's providence) is laid upon
us, how wrongfully soever by Men, Isai. 53.17. Mat. 26.63. and 27.12. Mar.
14.61. and 15.5. In holding, and fast-standing to the Profession of the Truth
through all sufferings, Joh. 18.36, 37. 1 Pet. 3.16, 17, 18. Joh. 13.12, 13,
14, 17. 1 John 3, 16. Heb. 13.18.
Mat. 10.16, 18, 32, 33. and all this in loving and seeking the good of our
enemies, Psalm. 35.11, 12, 13, 14. Luke 23.34. and 6.27, 28, 36. Romans 12.20, 21.
and in love to, and tender care for our Brethren, submitting to all the lowest
services of love even through sufferings for their safety and good: in all,
approving our hearts in love and faithfulness to God, that we may glorify him,
Joh. 17.4. and 7.16, 17. and 14.31. 2 Cor. 5.6, 7, 8. and so his death, as it
was for witness-bearing to the Truth, Act. 2.23, 24. and 3.13.15. and 4.10. and
5.30.
and to witness, and so to give an example of imitation to us: it is not right
to say, That God for that did put him to death: no, it was the Scribes and
Pharisees that for this did envy him and put him to death, and they did it
wickedly and with wicked hands: but God raised him, and so he will us by him,
if we follow him through sufferings to the enjoyment of glory.


In respect of the first end of his death, for satisfaction and propitiation
making; and of the second end, for confirming the New Testament, the death of
Christ was virtuous and efficacious with the Father, upon and from his first
undertaking, and accepting to do it; and having accepted it, it was virtuous in
dispensations through him toward men: whence he is called, Rev. 13 8.
The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world: and upon the account of the
virtue thereof, all that believed from the beginning of the World, Joh. 1.4, 5,
7, 11, 12. Romans 1.16, 17, 20. and 2.4, 5, 11. Prove. 1.23, 33.
were saved by this Grace in and through him: and all that rebelled against
Light and Grace, were damned on the same account, for rebelling against the
Light and Grace extended through him. It is an ignorant demand of some, Did
Christ die for those in Heaven, or for those in Hell, before his death? for his
acceptance and undertaking was virtuous from the first, and from the beginning;
and God's proceedings with men through him on that account of his death in due
time to be acted; and so to the two first ends, virtuous and efficacious from
the beginning, before the actual accomplishing of it: but for the last end of
his death, to bear witness of the truth, and give his personal example to
follow: the same cannot be so affirmed, True it is, He suffered and was slain
in his members and spiritual Seed from the beginning of the World, even
beginning at Abel, Mat. 23.34, 35. Romans 6.9. Rev. 1.18. Col. 1.24. Luke 10.16.
Act. 9.4, 5.
and so on in those which followed till his own personal coming, as our Savior
taught; and though himself in his own personal body have now once died, and
risen, and is alive for evermore, and can die no more; yet in his members and
spiritual seed on Earth, he is suffering and dying still: such his love to
them, and union with them, he counts these as his own sufferings: and these
examples of the Saints through Faith passing through, and overcoming in these
sufferings, are very useful for us, and speaking examples to us, to be beheld
and minded of us: but our Savior's own personal example was not so before his
actual sufferings accomplished, as now it is: in beholding of which, as set
forth in the Gospl we may see both more into the virtues, and ends, and
efficacies of his death, than before could be seen; and his example therein
also, which could not so be beheld of men, Heb. 11. and 12.1, 2. Jam. 5.10, 11.
Mat. 5.12. and 10.13, 14, 15. Joh. 15.20, 21.
before his actual accomplishment of it: so that in him we have the beginning
and foundation of life and strength, the motive, pattern and example also to
follow him, and therefore now to look to him, and to the other examples also
through him, and to him, in and above all the other: and this our Savior
plainly taught his first witnesses.

3. Our Savior having instructed his first witnesses thus, about his death and
resurrection, and the things done by him therein; Joh. 12.8. and 13.3. and
15.6, 28.
and so the end of his first personal coming into the World, to do and teach
all these things: he then also instructed them about his leaving the World, and
going again [now] in that personal body of his to the Father: and this, to
present himself in that body with the virtue of his blood, to obtain eternal
redemption of the nature of Man in himself; Heb. 10.5, 10. and 9.12. Romans 14.7,
8, 9. Joh. 17.2. Psa. 68.18, 20. Joh. 16.7, 15.
and so to have all men into his dispose, that he may dispense to them and deal
with them according to the Father's will; which also is his will; and so to
receive the immeasurable fullness of the holy Ghost in the Man, to send forth,
even to the rebellious, to convince them; and to believers, to lead them into
all Truth, Ioh. 17.26. Heb. 12.24. 1 Pet. 1, 2. Joh. 13.8. and 15.3. Joh.
14.16, 17, 26. and 16.13, 14, 15, Ephesians. 2.5, 6. Phil. 3.20. Col. 3.1. Ioh. 14,
20, 21.24.
and so to make known still farther his Father's Name, and therein sprinkle the
virtue of his blood upon the hearts and consciences of believers, and herewith
enduing them with his Spirit, to be with and in them, a Teacher, Advocate, and
Comforter, to mind them of his words, enable them to prize and trust in him,
and approach to God by him, and pray in his Name; and so to prepare them
mansions; that having all fullness in him, they might have their rejoicing,
hope, converse, and dwelling with him in Heaven by Faith; and that in one
mindedness with God and Christ in his design, Gal. 4.26. Heb. 12.22, 23. 1 Ioh.
1.2, 3. 2 Cor. 5.8. Rev. 6.9. Heb. 12.22, 23. Ephesians. 2.19, 22. 2 Cor. 7.3. Phil.
1.7. 1 These. 2.17.
in believing and walking in the Truth breathed forth from Jerusalem that is
above, they might have in Spirit, a dwelling and fellowship with the Prophets,
and Apostles, and Spirits of just Men made perfect, that are in and with
Christ, and under the Altar; and also through the efficacy of his Spirit in
their Ministration, they may have a spiritual dwelling in the hearts of such as
living in this World, have their conversation in Heaven, and fellowship in the
Gospel with them. And last of all, according to the Spirits preparation of
them, and fruitfulness in and by them, enlargedness in his Kingdom, which is
reserved in Heaven for them, Col. 1.5. 1 These. 2.19, 20. 2 John 8. 2 Pet 1.11.
Joh. 14 2. Heb. 8.1, 6. and 9.4. 1 Timothy 2.^. 1 John 2.1, 2. Heb. 7.25. and 9.15.
to be given them at his coming; all which he assures them he is now preparing
in the Heavens for them; yea, he is now there in Heaven, appearing at the right
Hand of God before God for us, mediating between God and Men, and advocating
and interceding in special manner for Believers that come to God by him; and
so, as in that he did in his own Body, he made peace, wrought and obtained
Redemption with God for Men, and obtained the Power of extending the virtues
thereof, in these spiritual efficacies to Men; so by these efficacious makings
known and application of the same to Men, he draws M^n to himself, and
works Redemption in Believers, and preserves them to the Inheritance: all
which our Savior taught to his first Witnesses. And moreover,

4. Having thus instructed them about his bodily absence from them, and how
much it is for their benefit, because of the bu^ness he is in Heaven doing with
God for them, and from God by his Spirit with them; Joh. 14.3. Mat. 19.28, 29
Rev. 11.17.18. Mat. 24.27, 30.
he also assures them of, and instructs them in this, that in due time he will
in that body of his personally come again and receive them to himself, and then
take his great power and reign, and they shall reign with him: nor need they be
deceived about this his coming; Mat. 25.32.46. Joh. 5.28, 29.
for it shall be so personal, open, and visible, that every eye shall see him;
and when he does sit upon the Throne of his glory, then shall all Nations be
gathered before him; and having raised all the dead, will separate those that
have believed in him, and lived to him, from those that have rebelled against
him, setting the one on his right hand, and the other on his left hand, and
then judge and give sentence on both; and the righteous that are on the right
hand, shall go into everlasting joy; and the wicked that are on the left hand,
shall go into everlasting Fire, there to be tormented for ever: and that all
that believe on him, may with patience and comfort wait till that day come, he
taught and assured them, that he would not leave them (as Orphans) comfortless,
Ioh. 14.16, 17, 18, 26.
but by his word, and Spirit in that word, he with them, and in them; and by
that Spirit both mind them of, Joh. 16.13, 14, 15. and 15.4, 7. 1 Pet. 1.5.
Joh. 14.6. and 10.9. and 14.9, 10.
and teach them the words that he had fore-given them; and also so take of the
things of Christ, and show to them, that he should present him glorious to
them, and lead them into all truth, that by Faith, and well-pleasedness in him,
they may be made fruitful, and preserved to the inheritance: and that he thus
discovered, is the door and way of access to the Father, and entrance into the
Church; yea, the Father is in him, and he in the Father; and all that is the
Father's, is his: so that in seeing and having him, they see and have the
Father also; and that he is the Truth and the Life, in whom they have Wisdom,
Righteousness, and 1.3.
Sanctification and Redemption, Covenant quickening, and all spiritual Riches
and Life; yea, he is such a sure Rock, that whoever is found in believing built
on him, Mat. 16.18. 1 Pet. 2.3, 4, 5.
the gates of Hell shall not prevail against him: his Flesh, even his Body, as
given for the Life of the World, is Bread of Life, and Meat indeed; and his
Blood, as having confirmed the New Testament, is Drink indeed: Joh. 6.51, 58,
63. and 15.10. and 17.24.
and what Spirit or Soul of Man soever eats and drinks hereof, shall never
die, but have everlasting Life: his words are Spirit and Life: and as the
Father has loved him, even so has he loved those that believe in him, and
will come again, and receive them to himself, that where he is, they may be
also. So that in all this is a blessed, clear, great, gracious, and glorious
Revelation of Jesus Christ in his own personal teachings.

Yet to free them from mistakes, and inform them clearly how by him this
blessed and saving work shall be carried an end till his coming again, that
there may be a spiritual Seed increased and preserved to him till then; he
instructed them how Men and Women should be brought in to God, namely, John
3.14, 15. Tit. 2.3. Mar. 16.25. Romans 16.26.
that He, even Christ the Son of God and Savior of the World, as thus
manifested to them, must be by them so made known to others; yea, lifted up and
made manifest by preaching his word he had taught them; and this to all Men,
all Nations, and in, and about this right preaching, manifestation, elevation,
declaration and tenders of Christ, he taught them much and many things, as
appears plainly by his own sayings to them and theirs, which they learned of
him: as to instance some of them.

1. That it be Jesus, that be lifted up and exalted, as the Christ, Joh. 8.14,
15. Luke 24.47, 43. Joh. 15.26. Romans 1.1, 5. and 16.25, 26. 1 Cor. 22. and
3.10, 11. 2 Cor. 4.5. 1 John 1.1, 2, 3. and 5.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Isa. 49.6.
the Son of the living God, the Propitiation for our sins, he in whom God is
well-pleased, who by virtue of his death, is the Lord of all, the only Rock
and Refuge, in whom whoever believes shall receive forgiveness of sins: this
Jesus, the He, and not the works of the Law, not any order or sort of men, not
any dreams or devices, nor any personal endowments or gifts, nor any internal
Lights and Operations; but only Jesus Christ, to be the Lord, the Foundation,
the He, in whom all Peace, Righteousness, and Eternal Life is prepared of God
for us, and given us of God in him, even in Jesus Christ, that in believing in
him we may receive it, and have it. And this is plain, in comparing his sayings
and theirs.

2. Joh. 3.16, 17. 1 John 4.9, 10, 14. Romans 5.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Tit. 3.4, 5. 2
Cor. 5.14, 15, 19, 21.
That both this gift of Christ the Savior of the World, and the setting him
forth, and tendering him in the Gospel, is, and is to be affirmed, a fruit and
witness of the love of God to the world, to Mankind, even sinners and ungodly
ones; and the love, Grace, and good will of God here-through commended and
tendered to them, that they might repent, and believe; and in believing,
receive remission of sins, and eternal Life: and this is plain in comparing his
sayings and theirs, according to that prophesied, Psa. 36.6, 7, 8. and 145.8,
9. Isa. 55.4.

3. That the end and purpose of God in this gift of Christ, and so setting him
forth, Joh. 3.17. Luke 9.56. Mat. 18.11. Joh. 12.47. Isa. 42.6, 7, 8. and 49.6,
8, 9. and 55.4, 5. and 63.1, 2, 3. Act. 3.26. and 14.15. and 26.17, 18. Joh.
12.35, 36, 46. and 9.5. Joh. 1.4, 7, 8, 9.
and making him known, and witnessing and commending his love through him; and
so the end of Christ his first coming, and Ministration, and of his continuing
the same Ministration of the Gospel in which he is still sent, held forth and
tendered to men, till his personal coming again, is, that the world might be
saved; yea, sinners and the chief sinners, that the eyes of the blind might be
opened, etc. and men brought in to believe, and so turned from darkness to
light, from the power of Satan to God, that so they may receive Remission of
sins, and inheritance among them that are sanctified by Faith that is in Jesus
Christ: and this is plain in the sayings of Christ by himself, and by his
Spirit in the Prophets, and by his Spirit in the sayings of those that learned
it of him: whence he says of his Ministration, that while he is in the world,
he is the Light of the World, and so before was, and in the Ministration of his
chosen Witnesses, will be till his coming again: Mat. 5.13, 14, 15, 16.
whence his Servants as Ministers of the Gospel, are also called, The Light of
the World; so that the Ministration of Christ in the Gospel, by himself or his
Servants, it, or he in it, is not to condemn, Joh. 8.12. and 12.47. Joh. 5.34.
Romans 2.5. Joh. 33.16, 17, 24, 29 30. Prove. 1.23. Romans 11.11, 23, 32, 33. 1 Cor.
5.5. 2 Pet. 3.15. Rev. 2.21. Isa. 5.4. Ezekiel. 24.13. Joh. 3.19. Romans 11. 2 Cor.
4.4. Mat. 13.15. Ier. 8.9. Iona. 2.8. Mat. 10.26. Mar. 8.36. Ioh. 3.18, 19.
Mar. 16.16. Exodus 34.6, 7. Isa. 30.16, 17, 18. Psa. 145.8, 9. Ioh. 7.47, 48.
destroy, or judge to perdition the World; no, not those in the World, and of
it, that at present reject his words; but even to save such: his words to them
are still, That they might be saved; his mercies are to lead to repentance,
that they might be saved; his chastisements to break them of their pride and
enterprises, that they might be saved: yea, his reproofs and beginning to
deliver them to Satan, are for the destruction of the flesh, and to abase them
that they might be saved: yea, his killing by the Law, was, that they might
live to God, Gal. 2.19: yea, all his patience and long-suffering, is, and is to
be accounted Salvation, being extended to Men, because he is not willing that
any should perish, but that they might come to Repentance and be saved: yea, he
does that in the means he uses, whereby they might be saved; so that he loses
none, Joh. 6.39. and 17.12. but whoever are lost, it is by rebelling against
the light, and so causing that which was for their welfare to be turned into a
snare, in their joining with Satan, that is blinding their minds, refusing
when their eyes are opened in seeing to see, and casting aside his word, and
following lying vanities, they lose their own mercies, and their own souls: and
these have one that judges them, even the Light in the Word that has come to
them, does inwardly accuse and condemn them as guilty of sin, and liable to
death. But yet notwithstanding, Christ in his Ministration is patient toward
them, and waits to be gracious to them, like as his Father does, being the same
with him, and having his Name on him; and does not in his Ministration in the
days of his patience, judge them, but reserveth that his judging and passing
Sentence, until the last day, when he is come again. Whence we may understand
the meaning of that sentence: Eccles. 9.4.
To him that is joined to all the living, there is hope: Romans 11.23.
so that if they abide not still in unbelief, they shall be grafted in again,
for God is able to do it; and therefore continue means still toward them: but
if they persist still in dis-obedience till the days of his patience be out,
Eccles. 9.10. and 11.3. Ioh. 12.48
then no more hope: but at that day the word of the Lord, that he has spoken,
(and the light in the means that he has extended) shall judge them; Romans 2.16.
for then will God judge all Men by Jesus Christ, according to the Gospel: not
by the Law of bondage, as they fell under it in Adam; but by the Law of liberty
brought to them by Jesus Christ, Iam. 2.12.
which could not rightly be, if in his word Salvation were not for them, 2
These. 2.10.
and truly tendered to them, and means whereby they might have received it: and
this not only in a show and pretense, but verily, and in truth, that they
might have been saved. So far our Savior's own Testimony of himself, and his
Father's and his own end in his Ministration: and the same he testifies of
himself, and his end in the Ministration continued by his Servants, left by him
in the World to that end that the words he gives them to speak, are such as
whereby Men should be saved, and to that end, and that he sends them in
Ministration to that end, to open their eyes, and turn them, Ioh. 17.15, 18,
21. Act. 11.14. Act. 26.17, 18.
etc. and this affirmed by his Spirit in his Servants, that God in
Gospel-Ministration sends Christ to bless them, in turning every of them from
their iniquities; and so of Christ his coming into the World, both in his
personal Ministration, and his Ministration by his Servants. Act. 3.26.
This is affirmed, as a faithful saying, (in which there is no dissimulation,
no equivocation, no wreathedness; Prove. 8.4, 5, 6, 9.
but it is according to the very Heart and Mind of God, and very plain to be
understood, according to the import of the words) and worthy all acceptance,
(to be heeded believed, and embraced with the heart) That Jesus Christ came
into the world to save sinners, 2 Timothy 1.15.
(sinners indefinitely, such, and all such as are sinners; and to put all out
of doubt, the Apostle having mentioned what a sinner he was, says,) of whom I
am the chief: such the purpose and gracious end of God, in the gift of his Son,
and of Christ in his coming and Ministration, both immediate and mediate,
extended for teaching to Men.

4. That Jesus Christ, according to all this Revelation of him, and of the
Father's love in giving him and making him known, and his gracious end in this
Ministration of him; is to be displayed, held forth, preached, and affirmed, as
a word of Truth and Verity, to the World of Mankind, to all Nations, to every
Man in the whole Creation, wherever they come: and this is plain in the
commission and charge given them.

True it is, the Ministration of John Baptist, was but to the people of Israel,
though the light of it to be extended farther: Mat. 28.19, 20. Mar. 16.15. Luke
1.16, 77. Ioh. 1.7. Mat. 15 24. Mat. 10.5, 6. Romans 15.8, 9.
and so the personal Ministration of the Gospel by Christ, was primely to them,
the Circumcision, the lost Sheep of the House of Israel; and his Disciples
Ministration while he personally abode with them on Earth, was no farther but
to the House of Israel: yet was this also to confirm the promises unto the
Fathers; and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his Mercy: whence when by
providence led among the Samaritans, Ioh. 4.10, 42.
he (as an overplus) in his Ministration converted some of them, that in
hearing his voice became the Sheep of his Ministration, yet he did not
outwardly fold them, till after his ascension and pouring forth the Holy Ghost,
Ioh. 10.14, 15, 16.
when the commission and mission was enlarged for his Servants Ministration.
But now when his suffering-work was finished, death overcome, the acceptable
Sacrifice offered, and he on the right of God, and having sent forth Spirit,
the veil of the Temple rent, the partition wall broken down, and all Tongues
sanctified to declare the Work and Name of God in; they are to go into all the
World and to declare and preach Christ as thus revealed, Romans 5 12, 18. Mat.
22.1, 7. Prove. 9.1, 2, 3. Isa. 55.1, 2, 3, 4. Romans 5.18. and 3.23, 24.
to every man of all Nations in all the World, wherever they come, and this
as a Word, of Truth: and so to set forth this second public Man, the spiritual
Man, the Lord, the quickening Spirit, as he on whom God has executed the
Judgment that was due to Mankind for their sins, as fallen; in whom their
Nature is restored: the Nature of Man, being united and married unto God in the
Person of his Son; and so a great Feast of fatness, even the sure mercies of
David, prepared: in him is Mankind perfect again, as in a public Man, having
in him forgiveness, pardon, peace, wisdom, righteousness, eternal Life; so
verily, that in believing in him, they may receive it, 1 Ioh. 5.10, 11, 12. 2
Cor. 2.17. and 3.12. and 4.2.
and be partakers of it: and so is he to be set forth without any Cloak or
equivocation, plainly to every Man, appealing to their consciences in the sight
of God: and that Jesus is so, and as such a one, to be held forth to all, that
every one may behold him, as he in whom there is healing for them to be
received in believing, is plain in our Savior's own personal Testimony Ioh.
3.14, 15.
, and the Testimony of his Spirit in his Apostles Romans 3.24, 25, 26. 2 Cor. 5.
14, 19, 21. Col. 1.28.
: and this to this end, that by this, Men might be reconciled to God 2 Cor.
5.20.
. And this hope given, the Servants of Christ in such elevation of Christ, that
he will confirm their words, and manifest their Testimony true, so that all Men
shall be drawn thereby, even by Christ testified unto him Joh. 12.32.
: such as in this day of grace believe this Testimony of him, it shall be the
power of God unto Salvation in them, and work effectually in them, uniting and
conforming them to Christ; so as they shall by degrees, and in due season enjoy
all this revealed blessedness Mat. 10.40. Romans 1.16. 1 These. 2.13. 2 Pet. 1.1,
10.
. And such as persist in refusing and rebelling against the Light extended,
shall by the same Spirit that breaths in the Gospel, be at the last day
convinced Joh. 16.7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
, and come before Christ, and bow to him, and confess him Lord to the glory of
God Phil. 2.10, 11.
, and shall confess the Truth of the Testimony his Servants delivered, and them
to be the Servants of the Lord, which in the days of his patience, they
despised and opposed Isa. 60.14. Rev. 3.9.
; and all before the final sentence be executed on them: for God that
frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad, that turns wise
Men backward, and makes their knowledge foolishness, does (and will confirm
the Word of his Servants, and perform the counsel of his Messengers Isa. 44.25,
26.
. And to both parts of this said, he has given us his Oath, That all shall
come before him. Isa. 45.22, 23, 24.
.

And thus was the mystery of Christ revealed by himself in his own personal
Ministration, Part 1. chapter 6.
in which also, as he uttered many Parables, so he opened them all to his
Disciples to teach them openly: and whereas the Disciples did not yet clearly
understand all this Revelation of Christ so taught to them, before Christ had
suffered and risen from the dead; therefore Christ after his Resurrection
appeared to them, and taught the same again to them, and then expounded Moses
and the Prophets, and in order opened in all the Scriptures unto them the
things concerning himself; and also opened their understanding, that they might
understand the Scriptures Luke 24.26, 27, 45, 46, 47.
: and yet because all was not yet acted by Christ, as well as taught by him,
that was to be in the mystery held forth in their Ministration; for Christ his
body, though then risen, was not as then ascended and glorified Joh. 20.17.
, and so the fullness of understanding of the whole mystery by the Holy Ghost,
not yet given Joh. 7.39. and 16.7.
: therefore they were yet to wait for further divine Power, even the holy Ghost
to be given them, to open clearly this Revelation to them, and to help them to
witness it: which Christ promised them, and did perform it after his ascension.
o Luke 24.49, Act. 1.4.


CHAP. 9.
Of the third way of our Savior's Revelation and manifestation of himself, to
the first witnesses. of his Resurrection.

OUr Savior, according to his Promise, did within a few days after his
Ascension, by virtue, and as a fruit of his Ascension and Sacrifice offered and
accepted, and his Mediation begun, he did send, and shed forth, and pour upon
and in them, the Holy Ghost, in an audible, sensible, Act. 2.2, 3, 4, etc.
and visible shape, both resting upon them, and supernaturally and inwardly
filling them; by which Holy Spirit, he brought again to their mind, and gave
them to understand all his fore-Revelation and sayings to them, and showed the
things of himself, and the Father so leading them into all Truth, and making
known to them the whole counsel of God in things pertaining to Eternal Life, to
be taught till his coming again; enduing them with power, motion, and fitness
to witness of him and giving them the gift of tongues to speak to every Man in
his own Language, wherein he was born; so abundantly was the Revelation of the
mystery of Christ by the Spirit made known to them: and yet, that we may
rightly understand what the Holy Ghost is, that was thus given unto them, it is
good to consider, what in Revelation of Christ from the beginning, and now by
himself is given us to understand; and that is, that it is something, that was
never before this so given; no, not as then while John was baptizing, Mar. 1.8.
Joh. 7.38, 39. Joh. 14.16. and 16.7. Act. 5.3, 4. 1 Ioh. 5.7. Genesis 1.2. Psalm.
33.6. and 139.1, 11.
nor yet while Christ himself was personally ministering here on Earth, nor
could be given, till he left the World in that body of his, and went to the
Father; so that it cannot be meant properly of the essence and being of the
Holy Ghost, which is one and the same with the Father and the Son, the same
God, by whom the Heaven and the Earth was made, and all the Hosts of them; for
in this respect he fills heaven and Earth, and is everywhere present, and
always was: so that in respect of essence he is not said to be sent or
proceeding from the Father and Son, or descending, being ever one in and with
both; but only in respect of person or manner of existence in, and operation
of that one divine essence: but it must be meant of some forthcoming of the
divine power from the Father by Christ; yet in this also it cannot be meant of
such forthcoming in breathings and operations, as tend to the supportation of
the old Creation, Joh 26.12, 13. Psa. 104.29, 30.
in upholding, and ordering, and garnishing the Heaven and Earth, and Creatures
therein, for the good of Mankind; and enduing Men with understanding and skill
for Husbandry and disposing the Fruits of the Earth, Deuteronomy. 28.26, 29. Exodus
31.3. and 35.31.
and for curious Arts and Works, or for War, Physic, Laws, and Government of a
Commonwealth, etc. though these be all Mercies to lead to Repentance; for these
were extended before Christ carried the Nature of Man into Heaven: no, nor yet
is meant simply of a discovery of the Mind and Grace of God through Christ,
Heb. 11.6. Genesis 6.3. Act. 14.17. Romans 3.2. and 9.5. Joh. 1.7, 29.
striving with Men, to bring them in to God; for this also was from the
beginning; yea, and some brought in to believe thereby, from the rumor of the
Gospel in Paradise delivered, and the works of Creation and Providence: and yet
more abundantly to Israel, in Types, Promises, and Prophesies; and yet more in
John Baptist's Ministration: yea, the Holy Ghost in such means to enlighten and
teach, has not only been always in the Church, but some have been
wonderfully filled with him: he signified in and to the Prophets, 1 Pet. 1.11.
2 Pet. 1.21. Act. 28.25 Luke 1.41, 46, 67. and 2.25, 26.
and they spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost; and the Holy Ghost spoke
by them; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost, and Mary, and Zacharias;
and the Holy Ghost was upon old Simeon, and revealed Christ to him; and the
same may be said of diverse others: so that though no other Spirit be promised,
yet some farther Discovery and Operation of the Spirit, which was not as yet
given, is evident to be meant here by the giving the Holy Ghost. If any think,
that his coming like a mighty and rushing wind, and sitting on them in the
likeness of fiery Tongues, and giving them to speak with diverse Tongues, is
that which was promised, he is not deceived in that; for it was included in the
promises as to the first Witnesses: but it was neither the whole, nor the main
in the Promise, but an overplus and addition to the main, Joh. 7.37, 38, 39.
and 17.20, 21. Act. 2.39.
the promise being that which however with more abundance to them, yet in the
Testimony given them, it appertained to all, that through that Testimony
believe in Christ: and this appears to be such a giving of the Holy Ghost, as
never was before, in, 1. A more full and clear Revelation of Christ, 1 Cor.
2.9, 10, 11. Joh. 5.39. Heb. 1.1. Romans 16.25. Ephesians. 3.3, 9.
and things of Christ (that lay hid in the bowels of the Scriptures) then ever
was before, all being in this Testimony opened, so far as is to be known till
his own personal coming again; so as the full of the Holy Ghosts Testimony of
Christ is come forth opened, which was not so before. 2. A more free and clear
manifestation of the Lord Christ, 2 Cor. 4.6. Col. 1.25, 26, 27. Joh. 7.37, 38,
39.
as having completed the Sacrifice, and being filled with Spirit, and the
Father's Face and Mind appearing in him (not through Types and Prophecies,
but) in a clear Demonstration of him in the Gospel, as the Object of Faith, and
Allurer (not with servitude in a Law of Works, but) with Freedom to believe in
him, and therein to receive more free and abundant spiritual Operations, and
spiritual gifts, then ever before. 3. A larger Freedom for all Gentiles as Jews
without difference, Ephesians. 3.3, 4, 9. Gal. 3.28. Ephesians. 1.8, 9, 10.
all, every or any one in believing the Testimony, to receive the gracious
Privileges; and in all this, he abounded to the first Witnesses in all Wisdom
and Prudence, making known to them the mystery of his will for the dispensation
of these last times. 4. That this Testimony of Christ in which all parts of the
Testimony fore-given by Inspirations, Types, Prophecies, Joh. 15.26. and 14.26.
and 16.13, 15. Joh. 3.16. Romans 1.16. 2 Cor. 3.6, 7, etc.
Visions, Dreams, was opened, being fully and clearly given forth by the Holy
Ghost witnessing of Christ: this Testimony, being a birth of the Spirit, and
the Medium in which the Spirit works, and his own Testimony, it also bears
his Name; and he that believing receives it, receives him, and shall
experiment this Light and Operations.


And that this is meant by the giving of the Holy Ghost, fore-promised and now
performed by Christ, appears both in the Promises and Performance, and the
Scriptures quoted, and also by the Apostles Affirmation, that as the Promises
of Christ concerning it, Psalm. 68.18, 20. Act. 2.33. Ephesians. 4.8, 11. Act. 2.17,
18.
so the Prophesies of the Prophet concerning his pouring forth his Spirit, both
for convincing the rebellious, and leading Believers into all Truth, and also
the efficaciousness of the Spirit for making known the Mind of Christ, and his
Operations for and in Prophecy, Vision, Dreams, had all a fulfilling in this
given to them: so full a Testimony and clear Revelation, with such Divine
Illumination and Operation was given to these first Witnesses, that by that
Testimony Christ and the things of Christ might be made known, that Men might
believe, and so come in to Christ. And this the last and fullest Revelation of
Christ, and no other but the clear knowledge of this to be looked for till he
do personally and visibly come again. But now for the way of making this known
to the Sons of Men, and carrying it an end, we have that also shown us in this
Revelation, these three ways given to them. In which we have three things to
note: first, The prime Medium or Way of making it known, and the chosen
Instruments to use that Medium to make it known, and also the Furniture
wherewith they are furnished to make it known, that Men may come to know Christ
thus revealed, and so be saved, reconciled and brought to God by Christ. Of
which see what the Scripture says.

CHAP. 10.
Of the prime Medium or Way of making Christ known, according to the Revelation
of the Mystery, to bring Men to God by Christ.

THis way of making Christ known for so gracious an end, so clearly, it is
manifest to be preaching this Word, Testimony or Gospel, as it is now come
forth: Mar. 1.15. Act. 10.42. 2 Timothy 4.2. Tit. 1.3.
and such a manner of Preaching, as never was before Christ his coming in the
Flesh, and suffering on the Cross, and having been put to death in the Flesh,
but quickened by the Spirit, and now alive in that Body for evermore; and by
virtue of his Cross and death, by which he made our Peace, and by virtue
whereof he still mediateth for us, and by virtue whereof he works in
Believers, and so will have his Cross and sufferings remembered, embraced, and
professed till his coming again; so, 1 Cor. 1.18, 20. and 2.1, 2.
as the preaching of him now as it is called the preaching of Christ, so it is
called also the preaching of the Cross, and so the preaching of Jesus Christ
and him crucified, and so it must be a preaching suitable thereto: and the
means to make Christ known according to this Revelation, is preaching, such a
preaching, as in which he is lift up, as shown in the eighth Chapter before:
and in the Scripture we may find it farther thus set forth, that is,

1. That it must be preaching, Joh. 12.38. Romans 10.16. 1 Pet. 1.12. Joh. 17.6,
7. 1 John 1.1, 2, 3. Act. 13.32, 33. and 26.27, Romans 3.25, 26. 1 Cor. 15.1, 2,
3, 4, 5. Act. 5.42. and 18.26. and 28.23, 31. 1 Timothy 2.7. Act. 20, 21. 2 Cor.
5.10, 11, 14, 19, 20.
that is (in Scripture Language) proclaiming and reporting Jesus to be the
Christ, and therewith the things done by him, declaring with manifestation, and
making plain the things reported; and therewith so teaching and expounding the
same, that the ends, virtues and excellencies of Christ and his Cross, and the
things of Christ, with his requirings and promises, may appear and be made
known; and evidencing, and testifying the Truth of all so taught by the
Scriptures, according to the Commandment of God, Romans 1.1, 5. and 16.25, 26.
Act. 18.25, 28. and 17.2, 3. and 26.22, 23. And from Christ and the things of
God in Christ, thus declared, taught, 2 Timothy 3.16. Tit. 2.15.
and testified, to persuade Men to Repentance and Faith, and so to be
reconciled to God, and then live to him; and to press this with Reproofs,
Instructions, Beseechings and Consolations, as need is: and in this manner to
exalt and tender the Grace of Christ, as aforesaid, is preaching; yea, that
preaching, that according to the mind of God is to be used.

2. This preaching must also be with plain and understandable words; 2 Col.
2.17. and 3.12. and 4.1, 2. 2 Pet. 1.15, 16.
not in dark Parables and Allegories, but with such simplicity, and plainness,
that they may appeal to every Man's conscience in the sight of God, with all
sincerity, without any cloak of covetousness, craft or guile. As for Christ
before his Ascension, preaching many things in Parables, it has been
fore-answered, Part 1. chapter 6. Mat. 10.27, 28.
and shown how he opened all to his Disciples, and charged them to teach the
same openly and plainly: so that the mystery of Christ as opened by Christ, is
by his Servants to be plainly preached now, without fear of Man: and so, as in
plain words, so in such language and terms, Act. 2.6, 8. 1 Cor. 14.6, 7, 19.
Rev. 19.10. 1 Cor. 14.3. 1 John 3.20, 21, 27, 28. 1 Cor. 1.1, 2. Genesis 3.15. 1 John 3.5, 8.
as the Hearers do know and understand; so the Holy Spirit given them, did at
first give them to speak to every Man in his own language: and so they used to
speak in words understandable to the Hearers. They are now taught, that the
Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy, the original spring and Leader
to all right speaking for Edification; in knowing him, all things are known;
and other knowledge and teaching, then according to what is taught by the
Spirits witnessing of him, is not needful.

The knowledge of the first Report of the Gospel, is in knowing him, as now
testified, clearly understood: whereas those that by humane Wisdom think to
know that first saying, without this help given, run into many mistakes; yea,
all that the Fathers had in Visions and Dreams, Act. 2.18; 19, 20, 21.
is met with in this Testimony of Christ now given by the Spirit; yea, all that
the Heaven and Earth, with his Works therein, do witness, is seen most clearly
in Christ, Psalm. 19.1, 6. Romans 10.18. Isa. 42.6. 2 Cor. 1.20 Col. 2.17. Heb. 7,
and 8, and 9, and 10. Col. 3.11.
as set forth in this Testimony, and by him made apparent to be more clearly
seen in them; yea, the Covenant made with Abraham, it is to be seen and met
with in him; and all that was figured by Sacrifices and all other Types, the
Truth is in him, and to be seen and known in him, so that now Christ is all and
in all, and so in this Doctrine and Testimony. And therefore he, and the things
of him, are plainly to be preached, and that in a known language, and
understandable words, being alike holy and sanctified to declare the Gospel
with, and so alike fit to express God's Mind to us, as is before shown; Part
1. chapter 5.
and for us to express our Mind to God in praying to him. And so the Apostles
writing to the Church at Rome, Romans 8.25. Gal. 4.6.
where also both Jews and Greeks were, shows how the Spirit breaths in both
languages, Abba, Father; and so to another Church: and so they spoke with all
plainness of Speech in things needful to be known for Faith and good Manners;
and so is the Gospel to be plainly preached in understandable words.

3. This preaching of the Gospel now, must neither be with the wisdom of words,
1 Cor. 1.17, 18, 19, 20. and 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
which the Spirit of Wisdom that is in the Princes of this World, for Learning,
or the Wisdom of Man, teaches; or in such manner as to draw applause to the
Preacher, or to receive that said for his excellency in Learning and arguing in
Rhetorical persuasions.

Nor must this preaching be with Fables and endless Genealogies, 1 Timothy 4.7.
and 6.20. Tit. 3.9. Col. 2.8. 1 Cor. 1.19, 20, 17, 23. and 2.1, 4, 12.
or opposition of Science falsely so called: nor with Philosophical Subtilties,
Reasons, and Depths, after the Fashion of humanely-learned wise Men: nor with
Artificial and framed Eloquence and Rhetorical Persuasions according to Man's
Art: nor yet with pretenses of great Light, intruding into things they have not
seen in the Testimony, there being in that no Revelation of it, Romans 12.3. Col.
2.18. Gal. 1.10. 1 These. 2.4, 5, 6. 1 Cor. 14.6, 19, 28.
and so beyond the measure of Faith given, though covered with great pretenses
and shows of Humility: nor by tempering their Doctrine to the humors of Men,
to please them, and get applause from them: nor with using quaint words, or
words of a strange language not understood. If a strange Tongue inspired were
to be silenced, where it was not of the Hearers understood, how much more that
which is acquired by study? 1 Cor. 2.4, 5. Romans 16.26. 2 Timothy 3.16, 17. Tit.
2.15. 1 Pet. 4.11. 1 Cor. 3.18. Romans 1.1, 5.
all these things are to be avoided in this preaching, and the preaching to be
with Evidence and Demonstration of the Spirit in the Testimony he has given of
Christ in the Scripture, and so with all Power and Authority, as the very
Oracles of God; and all this plain-speaking to Men, not for Men to exercise
their Wisdom to imagine a Riddle, and study for a mysterious sense, but for the
obedience of Faith, that Men, as Fools, in their own wisdom may be wise, in
credit-giving to this Testimony, and so believe, and obey in believing. Such
plain preaching, and for the most part by as plain Instruments, is this
preaching to be used, even such as crosses and confounds the wise and
learned of this World; but it is the Wisdom and Justice of God, that so it
should be: for God had tried them long enough, he had imprinted his Wisdom in
the Gospel reported in Paradise, and carried on by the Fathers and Elders
Instructions, and manifested much of himself and his goodness in his works of
Creation and Providence, See Part 3. chapter 1.
and given them understanding above the Beasts of the Earth, and the Fowls of
Heaven, and many of them by study became wiser then the ordinary sort of Men;
yet in all this time, by their wisdom they did not learn to know God in the
Wisdom of God. Well, God tried them farther, and gave to Israel the Revelation
of his Mind in Word and Oracles by Types and Prophesies, See Part 3. chapter 3.
that by these they might come to know the Wisdom of God: but in all this time,
they have not found out the knowledge of God in the Wisdom of God. Romans 1.21,
22, 28. Joh. 1.4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11.
Therefore, after all this, it pleased God in his great mercy to Men, to give
forth this full and plain Discovery and Revelation of himself in Christ; 1 Cor.
1.17, 21, 23.
and in his Wisdom and Justice also, to appoint this plain Report and preaching
thereof, as to the wise of the World seems foolishness, as neither magnifies,
nor needs their wisdom and learning to interpret or find out the sense; yea,
Psalm. 8.2. Mat. 11.25. Luke 2.17. Joh. 21. Act. 2. and 4.13. Mat. 2.16. Mr.
6.3. 1 Cor. 1.21, 23, 27. Jer. 5.30, 31. Isa. 29.14. and 33.18. 1 Cor. 1.19,
20, 26, 27.
it is such, as in the plain report, wise Men exercising their wisdom, it is
hidden from them; and babes believing, understand, and it is revealed to them,
and for the more part, such Babes, illiterate, Shepherds, Fishers, Mechanics,
whom the Men of the World deride, are the Preachers of it: and this kind of
preaching, is a great stumble and offense to the learned and wise of the World,
and by them counted foolishness; and through their teaching, which tends to
magnify worldly wisdom and learning, and to exalt an outward order of Priests
of that sort to rule over the people, it becomes an offense to the people also,
that love to have such to rule over them: and the pride of all this glory God
will stain, and cast shame upon it: so that this manner preaching the Gospel
becomes a part of the Cross of Christ, Mat. 13.55, 57. Mar. 6.3. Romans 15.2, 3.
2 Cor. 4.10, 11, 12, 13.
to be taken up by the Preachers, and willingly born; and through their dying
in their bearing this Cross, the Life of Christ works in them, and through
their Ministration. And this kind of Preaching, is suited to this Revelation of
Christ: howbeit, that this preaching may be rightly carried on, this is also to
be always joined with it:

4. That those that preach the Gospel, Mat. 5.4, 16. 1 Cor. 9.16, 27. Phil.
1.27. and 2.16. 1 Timothy 6.11, 12, Til. 3.14.
walk suitable to the Gospel, that their Light may shine forth in their Works
and conversation, enduring through reproachings and sufferings; that they so
preach and witness, that they preach to others, even by their conversation.

And in this manner of preaching, is the Gospel to be preached: to which also,
they have certain helps annexed, discovered in this Revelation of Christ.

5. For their helpfulness in doing good with this preaching, they are, 1. To
use earnest Prayer to God in the Name of Christ, Joh. 16.23, 29.
for Divine Help and Assistance. 2. To read, mind, 2 Timothy 3.14, 17.
and meditate the Holy Scriptures that are fore-written. 3. And as any are
brought in to entertain the Gospel, Mat. 28.19, 20. Act. 16.33.
if they have not so been fore-baptized, to baptize them and all that are
theirs, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; so
testifying the Truth of the Gospel they have taught, and admitting the Baptized
into the Family of Christ, to be his Scholars to learn of him. And for such as
are come to the knowledge and profession of Christ in his Family, to break
bread, 1 Cor. 11, 23, 24.25, 26.
and so to eat and drink together according to his institution in remembrance
of his death, and to show it forth till he come. 4. And for their better
profiting in, and use of all these helps, Mat. 18.15, 16, 20. 1 Cor. 5. and
11.23, 31. and 14. all. Heb. 10.25.
to have their assemblings together for fellowship in the Gospel, that so they
may grow in Faith and Love, and in Union and Fellowship with God and Christ,
and one another, and others be still brought in to God by them, and stubborn,
and criminal Offenders shut out of that Fellowship till they repent.


And this the Preaching, 2 Cor. 2.16. and 3.5, 6.
and these the helps for carrying on this business: but who is sufficient for
these things? it is therefore good to consider who they be, that in this
Revelation of Christ, God did purpose, and in his purpose preapprove, and so
choose for this business; and how he has furnished them so chosen, which is
also in this Revelation made known.

CHAP. 11.
Of those whom God has appointed and chosen to this business, for declaring
his Name, and showing forth his praises to this end, for Convincement,
Conversion, and Edification.

WE do find in the Scripture, that these are in some respect of two sorts;
though in respect of Faith, and that ministered, Mat. 5.1.13, 14, 15, 16. Joh.
15.1, 2, 4, 8. and 17.20, 21, 22, 23.
one; and so he chose first and primely those that were brought in by his own
personal Ministration, and the first Trusters in him after his Resurrection, to
be the Beginners and Layers of the Foundation, and Recorders of the Gospel thus
revealed; and likewise together with them, and to be after them, all those that
should through his Word ministered by these first Witnesses be brought in to
believe on him, to carry this business an end, to the same end, till his coming
again. And this appears clear in the Scripture: for,

1. He chose for this business those that were brought in by his own immediate
and personal Ministration, and received the Gospel immediately from himself,
Mar. 3.9, 13, 14, 15, 16, etc. Luke 6.13, 14, etc.
having seen and heard him personally; and so were to be the Trusters in him
after his Resurrection: he chose them not as they were the Sons of Adam, and
born of such natural Parents, and had of them such Names, though they were
such, and had such Names; but as they were his Called, and believed on him,
even so, and as such he chose them: and so it is said of them he chose to be
Apostles, they were first his called Disciples, and then he after called and
chose them to be Apostles; and one of these, notwithstanding all this Grace
extended, Joh. 6.70. and 17.12. Act. 1.15, 26. Rev. 17.14. Ioh. 15.16, 19.
was false-hearted, and became of the Devil, and lost himself, and so never
came to trust in him after his Resurrection; but another of his Disciples, that
so trusted in him, had that place and office of his: for those in and with him
in this business approved of him, are called, and chosen, and faithful: and of
these, of his first Witnesses, he says, You have not chosen me, but I have
chosen you, that you should go, Joh. 17.13, 14, 20. Luke 10.1, 2, 17. Gal.
3.11, 12, 17. 1 Cor. 9.1. and 15.8, 9. Act. 10.41, 42.
and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain. And again, Ye are
not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, etc. And as such, he
prayed for them, that they might be fitted, preselved and blessed in their
Ministration. And so likewise he appointed seventy others to go before his
Face, to evangelize. And thus also Paul was chosen to be one of these first
Witnesses, and an Apostle; and proves his Apostleship by this, That he received
the Gospel immediately from the Lord, and that he had seen the Lord. And this
the Apostle affirms of all the first Witnesses, that saw and heard Christ after
his Resurrection, That they were witnesses chosen before of God, and precious,
and commanded by him to preach unto the people, and testify, etc. so that of
this first sort there is no question.

2. He also in this choice, did also choose for carrying an end this business
till his coming again, those, and all those (approving only those) that in
believing his Word, as delivered and left upon record by his Apostles, are by
his grace brought in believing on him, to be united, and built on him, and so
to have his Word in their Heart. And this is express, 1 Pet. 2.3, 4, 5, 9. Isa.
59.21. and 61.1, 2, 3, 4.
That these are the spiritual house, and holy Priesthood, the chosen
Generation, and peculiar people, called out of darkness into his mavelous
light, to offer up his acceptable Sacrifices to God by Jesus Christ, and show
forth the praises, according to what was fore-prophesied of such: whence that
hope of the Apostle to be enlarged by the Corinthians; and that acknowledgement
with thanksgiving of the Word, 2 Cor. 10.
sounded out to others by the Thessalonians, and their edifying one another, 1
These. 1.8. and 5.11, 14.
to which he still exhorts them (for Officers in outward Congregations, I am
not yet to speak, but as they are one with the unfeigned Believers thus united
to Christ) who as they are admonished in their speaking or Ministration, Romans
12.3.
not to presume beyond the measure of Faith dealt to them; so they are exhorted
according to the gift they have received, 1 Pet. 4.10, 11.
to minister the same one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of
God; and if any man speak, to speak as the Oracles of God; yea, and in the
midst of a crooked Generation, Phil. 2.15, 16. Mat. 5.13, 16. 1 Cor. 12.7.
to shine forth as Lights, and hold forth the Word of Life, as Jesus Christ
bade. And so the Manifestation of the Spirit is said to be given to every Man
to profit withal. And indeed, the House being of God's building, and not
Man's, by a Rule; for so was the old Tabernacle: and Christ being the Minister
of this Sanctuary, the High Priest, that is, the Prophet and the spiritual.
Man, that has none but spiritual Priests to attend his service, there being a
change of the Priesthood, that Law is also changed, Heb. 7.12.
and we have from Christ now no Priests by a natural birth or lineal descent,
but by a spiritual birth only; none by worldly Power, Psa. 68.11. Pro. 9.1, 2,
3, 4, 5.
and Documents, and Order: but by the Teachings and Calling of Christ by the
Spirit of Grace.

But for these two Points, that is, The means of carrying forth the Gospel, and
the Instruments approved and chosen thereto by God in Christ, we may yet see
much more in the next and last Point, which follows next to be spoken of,
namely, The Furniture wherewith he has furnished them, and that with fullness
of spiritual blessings both in knowledge, grace, wisdom, and understanding; and
also with spiritual gifts, of which now.

CHAP. 12.
Of the Furniture of spiritual blessings the chosen Witnesses are endued with.

THe choice and blessed Furniture of the first Witnesses of this Revelation, is
set forth by the Apostle in Ephesians. 1, and 2, and 3, and 4 Chapters, fully and
clearly: Ephesians. 1.1-12. he begins with magnifying the Grace of God given him to
minister, Ephesians. 1. Romans 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. and 11.13. 2 Cor. 11, and 12. Gal.
1.11, 12. Til. 1.1, 2, 3.
and the Office of, and Furniture for the Apostleship given him, as he did to
the Romans and others, but here more abundantly; and in viewing the
Excellencies he was to speak of, he begins with Thanksgiving, Ephesians. 1.3.
Blessed be God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with
all spiritual blessings (that is, of Knowledge, Faith, Righteousness, Peace,
and Joy in the Holy Ghost, with all heavenly Riches, and fitness to display
them) in heavenly places, or things in Christ; (that is, above and better then
our Fathers of old, See Part 3. chapter 3.
who had not heavenly places and things, but earthy, material Temple, Altar,
Mercy-Seat, High Priest, Sacrifices, Incense, Purifications, etc. yea, and all
distinct, not one the other, but each several and divided: but we have a
spiritual and heavenly Temple, Altar, Mercy-Seat, High Priest, Sacrifice,
Incense, Purification; yea, Father, Brother, Sonship, Fellowship, etc. and all
these one, and in one, Col. 2.9, 10. and 3.11.
even in Christ) in that preparation made, and Furniture given us in Christ, in
whom was fullness of provision made, for extending Grace in the several
Revelations of him, for the several Ministrations of him in the several Ages of
the World, (as has been shown) and so for this last Age of the World after his
Resurrection, 2 Timothy 1.9, 10. 1 Pet. 1.11, 12, 19, 20, 21. Col. 1.26, 27. Ephesians.
3.3, 4, 5. Ephesians. 1.4.
in which he purposed the first Trusters in Christ to be his choice Ministers;
and in that purpose, all this Grace was given us in Christ, before the World
began; but since his Resurrection, so revealed and manifested to us, as never
was to any before. And this verse. 4. According as he has chosen us in him
(these words may be taken to be read, as in a Parenthesis, for an actual
Election; which was indeed passed on them, and in that choice they received
nothing, but what was prepared in Christ for them before the Foundation of the
World: and this is a good and true reading and sense; and so is this that
follows, if we take the words for God's fore-purpose and pre-approbation of
these first Trusters in Christ, and so take them without a Parenthesis) before
the foundation of the world, Ephesians. 1.4.
that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. It Is clear he
speaks here of something, wherein they were preferred before the Instruments in
former Ministrations: for to be holy and unblameable before him in love, shall
one day be the portion of all the Saints from first to last. Ephesians. 5.25, 26, 27.
And of faults deserving blame in conversation, the best Saints on Earth have
not been altogether free; Romans 7. Gal. 2. Jam. 3.2. 2 Cor. 3.3, 14.
yea, the Apostles confess, That they were not: But here he speaks of their
Ministration, and the Testament they were Ministers of, as he did elsewhere.
And so Moses in his Ministration was faithful in all his House as a Servant,
and Aaron the Saint of the Lord: but the Law and Testament they ministered, made
nothing perfect; Heb. 7.19. Romans 2.3. Heb. 7.12. and 8.6, 11. and 9.14, 15. and
10.5, 10.
it was weak through the flesh: therefore God sent his Son, etc. and faulting
the former Covenant, he changed, and took away that Law, and has brought in:
New Covenant, established on better promises, which Christ ministers by these
chosen Witnesses; so that they needed abundance of Furniture, and were indeed
so abundantly furnished, that in Love, and Declaration of his Love, by an
unerring Spirit, they were un-erringly led in this excellent ministration, holy
and unblameable, in ministering of an holy and unblameable Covenant before him
in Love, which they have left upon record; which did we more believe, we should
more prize the Gospel, with the sayings in it left upon record by them. Ephesians.
1.5.
But he proceeds, verse. 5. Having predestined us to the adoption of children
by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will. Note
well the words: he says not, Having predestined us to be adopted children;
for they were in election; and being chosen, (whether in purpose or act) as
much adopted as chosen: for sure that Phrase, Mint Elect in whom my soul
delights, Isa. 42.1.
is well and truly rendered, My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased, and
is the same with that, This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.
Besides, Mat. 12.18. Mat. 3.17. and 17.5. 1 John 5.10, 11, 12. Gal. 3.16, 26,
29. Joh. 1.12. 2 Timothy 1.9. Joh. 6.44 Jam. 1.18. Joh. 1.13. Joh. 1.12, 16, 17,
18. Romans 8.16. Romans 9.4.
Adoption is only in Christ Jesus, and had in receiving and having him, as
Eternal Life is; and no other way: and yet farther, Adoption and Acceptance to
Sonship in Christ, is in a peculiar manner the work of God the Father, that
calls, and draws, and begets to Christ. And the communication of the
Dignity and Privileges of Sons, is in a peculiar manner the work of Jesus
Christ the Son; as it is in a peculiar manner the work of the holy Spirit to
witness it: besides, Adoption is a thing to be ministered, and did, though not
so clearly, appertain to the Jews under Moses Ministration. So that it is
evident here, That in saying, Having predestined us to the adoption of sons,
he points out the more clear business in their Ministration they were
predestined to (as predestination relates also to the means, as well as the
person and end) and that is here the Adoption of Children by Jesus Christ, in
which the way is pointed out, a more clear one then ever was in former
Ministrations, by preaching Jesus Christ according to the Revelation of the
Mystery: Romans 16.25, 26. 2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 20.
and so the Gospel is called, The Word of Reconciliation; and the Ministry of
it, The Ministry of Reconciliation: and both committed to them for that end.
Whence they said in Ministration, to be sent to open the eyes, and turn, etc.
that they might receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance, Act. 26.17, 18.
Joh. 15.16.
etc. whence our Savior says of them, I have chosen you, and ordained you,
that you should go and bring forth fruit, Mat. 28.19. Mar. 16.15, 16. Luke 5.10.
etc. and what fruit that is, is to be seen in the commission given them: so
that they were appointed to Adoption, that is, in Ministration of the Son to
bring men in to the Faith of the Son of God, and so to Sonship or Adoption.

And this by Jesus Christ, that is, by abiding in him, Ephesians. 1.5. Joh. 15.4, 7,
8, 27. Luke 24.47, 48. Ephesians. 1.5. 2 Cor. 4, 5, 6. Heb. 13.7, 8. 2 Cor. 5.20. and
11.2.
and so preaching and witnessing him, and so Repentance and Remission of sins
in his Name, to draw men in to him, as has been shown: and this unto himself,
to draw to him, unite to, and inamour with him, that he may have their heart,
and the praise: such the end of their Ministration and Furniture, and so of
their preaching: so they say, We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to
God; and, We have espoused you to one husband, even Christ. Thus was their
Ministration to the Adoption of Children by Jesus Christ to himself; and herein
far above the Ministration of Moses and Aaron, and all the Levitical
Priesthood, and their Law: for though their Adoption appertained to them, and
their Ministration was to bring Men to God, and so to be Sons and Tutor. Sons;
yet it was not with such a clear Revelation of Christ, but by Types, and
Shadows, and Prophesies of him to come; and by Circumcision, Gal. 4.1, 7. and
3.16, 26. and 5.1, 4.18. Joh 1.14, 15, 16, 17. and 8.31, 36.
still holding out the Gentiles as strangers to their Privileges, and binding
even the Circumcision to such observances of outward Rites, that they were kept
still in a kind of bondage; so, as they were under Tutors and Governors as
Servants, so as the most upright that were in Grace and not of works of the
Law, yet were they under the Law: but this Ministration is of Grace only, and
of Freedom, and leads thereto: Mat. 11.11. 2 Cor. 4.4.
yea, even John's Ministration, though before, and above all the former, yet
short of this; this being a glorious Ministration of a glorious Gospel, to a
gloriously gracious end, Ephesians. 1.5.
even the Adoption of Children by Jesus Christ unto God, according to the good
pleasure of his will, not only according to his will, and the pleasure of his
will; for so were all the former Ministrations: but through Men's weaknesses
they did not so profit, Romans 8.3. 2 Cor. 3.6, 14. Heb. 7, and 8, and 9, and 10.
nor were to continue but for a time, till Christ had offered up the Sacrifice;
and so were not approved for continuance and perfecting the Saints. But his
delight is in his Son, and the clear Revelation of him, and that Men should
love and honor him, and so come to God by him; and of this their Ministration,
and so this Ministration to continue till his coming again, 2 Cor. 2.14, 15,
17. and 3, 10, 11, 12. and 4.1.
with which he is well pleased: so that all the efficacies of it, are to him a
sweet savor. This the choice and good pleasure of his will, according to which
they were to minister, and did minister; and both his choice of them, and
furnishing of them to his Ministration, and their so ministering to bring Men by
Christ to Sonship, Ephesians. 1.6.
was for this glorious end, Verse. 6. To the praise of the glory of his grace.
The Grace of God was from the beginning, and testified in his works and word,
and he praised for it by his Servants: but the riches and gloriousness of it,
was but dimly seen, in respect of what indeed it is; nor did it so appear, till
the Son was manifested, till he came and was thus revealed, and that God spoke
by him, Col. 1.15. Heb. 1.1, 3. Joh. 1.14, 16, 17, 18.
and manifested himself through him, who is the Image of the invisible God, the
brightness of his glory, the express Image of his person, who has declared
him; so that God that commanded the Light to shine out of darkness, shined in
the Hearts of these first Witnesses the Light of the Glory of God, 2 Cor. 4.6.
Col. 1.26, 27. Romans 6.25, 26. Ephesians. 3.6, 7.
in the Face of Jesus Christ, revealing the Riches of the Glory of this
Mystery, etc. as formerly had not been revealed to others; yea, the largeness
of this Riches, and extention of it to all Mankind in Ministration, that they
might participate; so as they were for the praise and praising, 2 Cor. 1.20.
and 4.7. 1 Pet. 1.4.
and their Ministration for declaring, extolling and praising the glorious
largeness, riches and freeness of his Grace, and to occasion and bring others
to glorify and praise the same together with them: in which free and abundant
Grace, or, as still in verse. 6. Wherein he has made us accepted in the
beloved, Ephesians. 1.6.
which is as much, as in more words to say, That in the discovery of his
glorious Grace in Christ to us, Romans 5.1, 6, 8.11. Tit. 3.4, 5, 6, 2 Cor. 5.14,
15, 18, 19, 20. 1 Timothy 1 12, 13, 14.15, 16. Romans 8.2. 1 John 1.1, 2, 3.
and shedding it abroad in our hearts, he has therein and thereby reconciled
us (who were sinners as others are) unto himself, and so made us accepted in
Christ the Beloved, and counted us faithful, and put us in the Ministry; so as
we have seen and known what we preach, and have our selves experience of that
we preach to others, being also patterns set forth of God for them that
believe: he having committed to us, and put in us the word of Reconciliation,
and by that large and free Love of his, filled our Hearts with Love and Desire,
that others may participate of the same; and so answered that Praver made for
us, Joh. 17.11, 20. by Christ lesus.

Verse. 7. In whom we have redemption through his blood, Ephesians. 1.7.
the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. The Redemption
here spoken of, is explicated, by the medium, his blood (applied,) the thing it
self, the forgiveness of sins, and the manner, according to the Riches of his
Grace, and so more full then what believers in former times received, who had
the application mediately by other blood, figuring out his blood, as then yet
to be shed, and yet short of that full and complete Redemption that is still to
be waited for: of which, this is a first fruits and sealing confirmation of it
to us. And of the having Redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,
Romans 5.1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11. and 8.2. Rev. 1.5. Col. 2.13. Act. 10.43.
is more then having received forgiveness of their own sins in their own
consciences, and so freedom from the bondage of the Law, and Justification
through his blood, and so peace with God, and access to him in this Grace and
Hope of Glory; which indeed they had, and were thereby filled with, and fitted
by experiments of his Grace. But having, here signifies both all this, and
something more then all this, even something wherein they were preferred before
all the Ministers that went before them. These having in Christ, in the word of
Christ, as given them, the word of Reconciliation, in which all this is
brightly discovered in him: Col. 1.14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23. 2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 20,
21. Luke 24.47, 48. Act. 13.38. Romans 3.26, 27, 28. and 4.5.
and so in the Ministration given them, they have the Redemption completed by
him in himself for Men, and therein Remission of sins, to preach to others in
his Name, that so by Faith in his Blood, they also may receive the same, Romans
3.24, 25. Acts 10.43. and 26.18. yea, even by Faith in his Blood, without
outward Circumcision, or undering to the works of the Law; so glorious the
Ministration he has given them, and they have to display, not according to the
works of the Law, but according to the Riches of his Grace. And this sense
appears by the next following words, clearly to be here meant.

Verse. 8. Ephesians. 1.8.
Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence. This clearly
appears not to be the wisdom of the World, 1 Cor. 1.19, 20, 21. and 2.6.
or of the Princes of this World, or their prudence, which comes to naught;
yea, with all their wisdom, they have not known this wisdom: 1 Cor. 2.8. 1 Cor.
1.2.4. Col. 2.3, 9.
but as Christ is the Wisdom of God, and the Power of God, in whom are hid and
treasured up all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, the fullness of the
Godhead dwelling in him bodily, he being immeasurably filled with the Holy
Ghost, Prove. 8.11, 12. Isa. ^ 1.2. and 42.1, 8. and 61 1, 2, 3, 4. Joh. 15.26,
17.
the Spirit of Wisdom and knowledge, to send forth, and it flowing from him:
and that Spirit testifying of him, and enabling rightly to testify of him.
When the Apostle prays for the Ephesians, that God would grant to them the
Spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of Christ, Ephesians. 1.17, 18, 19.
that so in the knowledge of that Object unbared, and their eyes opened and
strengthened to behold, they might see the hope of his calling them (in this
Ministration,) etc. and it being the wisdom of the prudent to understand his
way, so it is manifest, Prove. 14.8.
that here by all wisdom and prudence he means, the imparting and giving in
to them the clear knowledge of Christ, and the things of Christ, and so of his
Mind, according to the Revelation of the Mystery, 1 Cor. 2.9, 10, 12, 13, 16.
and ability to declare the same by the Holy Ghost, as essewhere he expresses
himself to mean; and so by abounding toward us, he opens himself to mean, he
has given more abundantly to us, Romans 16.25, 26. 2 Pet. 1.3, 4. Col. 1.26, 27.
Ephesians. 3.5.
and revealed the Mystery more fully to us, and fitted us to manifest the same
in all wisdom and prudence, more then ever he did to any of the Sons of Men, or
any his Servants in former Ages: and this to be the meaning, is fully cleared
in the next words.

Verse. 9. Ephesians. 1.9.
Having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good
pleasure, which he had purposed in himself. Having, says he, made known to us
the mystery of his will, Ephesians. 3.4. Col. 1.3. 1 Tit. 3.9, 16. Col. 2.2. Luke
8.10. Mat. 13.11. Mar. 4.11. 1 Cor. 4.1.
which is called also, The Mystery of Christ, The Mystery of the Gospel, The
Mystery of Faith, The Mystery of Godliness, yea, The Mystery of God, even of
the Father and of Christ: in which also the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God:
all which was given to them to know; and these were made Stewards of the
Mysteries of God thus made known to them, as he says, Having made known to us
the mystery of his will, Ephesians. 1.9.
according to the good pleasure which he had purposed in himself. This of it
self clears up to us all; God working all things according to the counsel of
his will, in which is his purpose; he having at first so prepared in Christ,
and ordered for the several Revelations of him, and the Miniders with their
furniture in the several Ages, to carry the same forth, he then for these last
times purposed this great and clear Revelation of Christ; and the first
Trusters in him after his Resurrection, to be his chosen Witnesses, and to be
thus furnished; and according to this purpose in himself, he has thus chosen
and furnished them to this gracious end: in which, this sense does farther
appear by that before and following.

Verse. 10. That in the despensation of the fullness of times, Ephesians. 1.10.
he might gather together in one, all things in Christ, both which are in
heaven, and which are on earth, even in him. By fullness of times, he gives us
to understand, is meant the times after that due time was come when Jesus
Christ was come, and had suffered and completed that prophesied and typed of
him, Tit. 1.3.
to be done by him in his first coming, and so had given his Word to his
Disciples to manifest him by preaching: and so it is said, Gal. 4.4, 5.
When the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman,
made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might
receive the adoption of sons: 1 Pet. 1.20.
which fullness of times, is also called the last times; because also there
shall be no more changes of the manner of his Dispensation in any other
Revelation or Doctrine of Christ, 1 Pet. 1.4, 5. Rev. 10.6, 7. and 11.14, 19. 2 Timothy 4.8. Ephesians. 1.23. and 4.13. Romans 4 6. Gal. 4.4. 1 Pet. 1.4, 5. Act. 2.17.
Heb. 2.2. 1 Pet. 1.20 2 Pet. 1.15. and 3.2.
but in and by this; and this to be continued till that visible coming again of
his, which is the last day and last time, in which the whole Mystery of God
will be finished; that being called, that day, when will be the fullness of the
stature of Christ; when all that are to be brought in to him by such means are
come in to him, and with him; and from his first coming which was in due time,
in the beginning of the fullness of times, to his next personal and visible
coming, which will be at that day, that is the last time; all between, is
called, the last days, the last times; and here, the fullness of times, that we
may be mindeful of and heed this Dispensation and Gospel thus dispensed by the
Apostles, that proved all by the Prophets also, and to look for no other till
Christ come again.

And the end of this glorious Revelation, and glorious Dispensation is, Ephesians.
1.10.
That by Christ thus discovered, and as discovered in it, he might show forth
in Christ, and gather together in one, Heb. 1.1, 2, 3. Col. 1.15. Joh. 1.18.
Mat. 1 23. Psalm. 85.10.
even in Christ, all things which are in Heaven and in Earth, even all the
parcels of his Mind fore-declared in the heavenly Prophesies, or by Dreams and
Visions, or by earthy Types and Shadows, and that was hid (...) Christ, now to
be revealed and made manifest together in him, in whom God and Man are one; and
Truth and Righteousness, with Mercy and Peace meet in one, in him; yea, in
Temple, Altar, Propitiatory, Oracle, Priest, Sacrifice, Purincation; yea, Life
and Covenant are all in one, Heb. 12.22, 24.
in him; yea, in him Father, Son, Spirit are all one; yea, the worshipped and
worshippers meet in one in him; yea, the Spirits of the Prophets, and Apostles,
and of all just Men made perfect in Heaven, and of all unfeigned Believers on
Earth, meet in one in him; yea, Col. 2.10, 11.
Faith, Love, De res, Refreshings, all flow from him, and run into him, and
meet in one; yea, Jew, Gentile, Bond, Free, Male, Female, all one in him; and
by Faith in him, come to enjoy Union and Fellowship in and with him and one
another, and enjoyment of his blessing: and this Union with him, the Gospel
thus dispensed, effects where believed. 1 John 5.20.
And thus to understand this gathering together of all things in Christ to be
of these things, and this Union, we are led by the 3 verse. and other
Scriptures; so that the end of this Dispensation is to let Men see all in
Christ, and so draw them in to believe in him, to place all their Love, Faith,
Desires and Content in him, and so to find all their satisfaction in him, and
so partake of the Blessing of this Union in him.

Verse. 11. In whom, (that is, Ephesians. 1.11.
in Christ) we have obtained an inheritance: this he shows to be, they had it
in hope; and the Holy Spirit as the earnest, till the possession be given: and
this they had also to preach to others, and assure all unfeigned Believers of
the same, to be theirs in hope; yea, there was a confirmation of the Truth of
all this, and of the Blessing of their Ministration in the Ephesians, believing
on their report, Verse. 13, 14.
and being therein sealed, though they had not so much light into the Mystery
as the Apostles had, for which he also prays after for them, and explicates the
Mystery to them, as it was revealed to the Apostles, both in the Doctrine and
Effects of it in Believers, and the Privileges held forth to all Men that they
might believe, with experiments in some measure found in all Believers, which I
leave to be read in the second and third Chapters, only here taking notice of
what he affirms concerning all he has said, Verse. 11. Ephesians. 1.11.
That to all this, they were predestined according to the purpose of him that
works all things according to the counsel of his own will. Mark how he
concludes, and approves the purpose of God to be such, and his predestination
of them according to his purpose, even from his works in them, that God having
so chosen, and blessed, and furnished them-above all his former Servants, and
put them in this Ministration for such a Dispensation, and confirmed it with
such Blessings; he working nothing at random, but all things according to the
counsel of his own will: This is an evidence that such was God's purpose, and
according to his purpose did he predestinate us to all this, to this end,

Verse. 12. Ephesians. 1.12.
That we (we so elected and furnished, according as we were predestined, that
we) should to be the praise of his glory, (we in our Ministration in this
Dispensation, setting forth his glorious rich Grace in and through Christ, as
never was before) should lay the Foundation, and deliver the Doctrine and
Dispensation in which the Glory of his Grace shall be displayed to the end of
the World; so that we now in our personal doctrinal delivery and Dispensation,
and we after in the same Doctrine and Dispensation, delivered and recorded, by
us held forth in the Ministration of those that believe through our word, in
which our Fruit still remains and increases, that so we should be to the
praise of his glory, even we, who first trusted in Christ; and so were
Eyewitnesses of him, and had our Gospel immediately from him: in which he puts
a distinction between the first Witnesses that first trusted in Christ, and the
believing Ephesians that also trusted in him, after they had heard the Word
from the first Witnesses, Verse. 13, 14, etc.
of which Believers he affirms graciously, but short of what he affirmed of the
first Witnesses, putting a remarkable difference in respect of the measure of
the Furniture between himself with those spoken of, and these he speaks and
writes unto. So that the whole Series of all the things affirmed from verse. 3.
to verse. 12. will agree to none but the Apostles and first Witnesses of Christ,
to none of the Servants of God before Christ carried our Nature into Heaven,
nor fully in all and every of the things affirmed, scarce to any since their
times: but to all them, all that is said does fully agree, and in the Text is
expressly affirmed of them, Verse. 12.
which does abundantly testify the Truth and Goodness of the Gospel delivered
by them, who were so abundantly furnished with such a full and clear Revelation
of Christ, which they received so immediately from himself, whom they also saw;
and being so filled with his Spirit, have according to his purpose left the
same on record for us, Ephesians. 3.3, 4. Phil. 3.1. 2 Timothy 1.13. and 2.2. 2 Pet.
3.2. Rev. 22.18, 19.
who have the same Gospel and Dispensation, a revealed by them to believe and
declare, as we have it mediately from them; and not to gape after another
immediate Revelation of it to us, but to take it, as in believing we may by the
Spirit come to know it in and by their writings; and so Blessing, Election and
Furniture, with the Predestination according to his purpose for such a gracious
end for these last times here set forth, speaks good to, and for all the Sons
of Men to whom it comes, that they might believe; and sweet Consolation to all
Believers: and the wresting of Election and Predestination here spoken of, to
mean a certain set Company of Men severed from the residue of Men, that they,
and only they, shall be eternally saved, that were thus absolutely
predestined thereto, before the Foundation of the World; and these only, and
all these thus chosen and blessed, as Ephesians. 1.3, 4. sure there is not one word
in the whole Text, or elsewhere, expressing or importing such a sense as this.
But there are many things in the Text against such a sense, and that will not
admit it, as appears in that said, over and beside the expression of this
Company, to be the first Trusters in Christ, and speaking of them distinctly
from after-Trusters, changing the person from those spoke of, to those spoken
to, with some difference in that affirmed of either; yea, this sense pretended
in the Face of it, compared with the Text, would cut off all the Fathers from
Adam to Noah, and all the Believers in their times, and all from Noah to
Abraham, and all from Abraham to Moses, and all from Moses to David, and from
him to John Baptist, from being of the number of the Elect, and predestinate to
Eternal Life: for the things here affirmed of these Elect and predestined,
cannot be affirmed of those from the beginning; no, not of John Baptist
himself; yea, and by that Trial, few Believers since, will ever come to find
themselves of this elect Company; beside, this pretended sense pleaded for,
weakens and denies the evidence of good and credit this place affords to the
Gospel Dispensation, and darkens the light of the whole Text, so clearly
showing and intended to show forth the excellency of the Gospel as now
revealed, and the heavenly and rich Furniture of the Apostles and first
Witnesses to deliver it, and the Gospel and Dispensation recorded by them, to
be the Dispensation for these last times, and all this according to the purpose
of God; so were they furnished, and in the Gospel recorded, they are in Spirit
with all this Furniture with us now. But as this Furniture was in a sort common
to all the first Witnesses, so they had also a Furniture of spiritual gifts, in
which was difference; some one, some another; some more, some less. Let us view
these also.

CHAP. 13.
Of the Furniture of spiritual gifts the first witnesses had, as in Ephesians. 4.

Ephesians. 4.7.13. Ephesians. 4.7,
But unto every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the gift
of Christ. Wherefore he says, 8,
When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto
men. 9, 10, 11,
(And then there is an inference: read verse. 9, 10. and then he says,) And he
gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors
and Teachers: for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry,
for the edifying of the body of Christ, 12, 13.
till we all come into the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son
of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature (or age) of the
fullness of Christ.

In these words are many things affirmed and taught, both showing their rich
and plentiful furniture of spiritual gifts, and worthy our observing.

1. That these gifts, as here mentioned, were never so given to the Servants of
Christ in this manner, Ephesians. 4.9, 10. Psalm. 68.18, 19, 20. Act. 2.2, 6, 16,
21, 33.
before his personal Death, and Resurrection, and Ascension into Heaven, in
that personal Body of his that died and rose again; and so, that on his
Ascension, he received in that personal Body of his, the immeasurable fullness
of the Holy Ghost to send forth; and then, and not till then, but even then, he
did send forth the Holy Ghost upon his first Witnesses, with all these his
spiritual gifts: Ephesians. 4.7, 8, 11, 12.
and this is evident in the Apostles fore-inference; and in the Prophecy of
it, and in the testified performance of it, and in this express Affirmation. As
for outward Offices, for Order in Churches, for teaching and leading in the
Administration of Outward Ordinances; they were before according to God's
Direction, both for Temples, Synagogues, and Families, as well as those that
follow for their time among these, as Elders, or Bishops, and Deacons, which
are to be chosen by the Church, which is to follow Christ; in cnusing whom he
has fitted, and not enjoining him to follow them, in fitting whom they have
chosen, or else to allow him no Ministers in his Church: but of these after, in
fit place.

2. That these gifts, Luke 24.48.
bear not the names of ordinary Officers in the outward polity of the Church,
but the names of the Offices and Business of the first Witnesses of Christ,
Act. 26.18.
which were to preach him, to bring in such as were no Church, that they might
be a Church, and of the Church; Act. 24.21, 22, 23.
and then to edify the Church: and so a true Church in being, which was
before, and while as yet there was no such outward ordinary Officers, for the
outward polity thereof ordained therein, they being ordained in the Churches,
some time after the Churches were congregated, and in being. And so we find,
Luke 6.13.
That of the Disciples immediately called by Jesus Christ himself, that after
they were come to and followed him as Disciples, he then called them to him:
and first, of them he chose twelve, whom he named Apostles, Luke 10.1, 17.
whom he sent forth to witness of him, and preach him; and also that after that
he appointed other seventy, and sent them to go before his face, which could be
no less then to evangelize: yea, Mat. 5.14, 15, 16.
all his Disciples he appointed, to be a Light to the World, and to let their
Light shine forth, in Word and Conversation, so preaching him: yet with these
gifts fitting for the great business that was to be done, were they not yet
endued, nor could be, Joh. 16.7. Luke 24.49. Act. 1.4, 5. and 2.1, 33.
till Christ had suffered and ascended; and so were to go forth where Christ
was not named, etc. till after Christ his Ascension, they were by his pouring
forth the Holy Ghost on them endued with power from on high; and by this, and
their exercise, and allegations of Scripture in their Ministry, it appears,
that the first, primary, and choice gift, was the gift of Apostle, 1 Cor. 12.28.
put in this his first, and by himself immediately gathered Church: and this
appears to be such a spiritual Manifestation, Isa. 52.15. Rom 15.18, 19, 20,
21.
Light, Knowledge, and Gift, for teaching Christ, with such spiritual power and
efficacy as apted and enabled them to preach Christ, where, and to those he was
not before known to be The Christ, 2 Cor. 3.10, 11. 2 Cor. 9.2. 2 Cor. 3.1, 2,
3. and 13.3, 4, 5.
or else where he was not so much as named, and so known at all; and so not to
be the first instrumental layers of the Foundation; and such brought in by
them, were the seal of their Apostleship.

And in this gift of Apostle this is also to be farther noted, That in it all
the rest were included; so, as such as had the gift of Apostle, had therein all
the other following gifts, as of Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor and Teacher;
though others that had these, had not all that was in the gift of an Apostle.

The next gifts here mentioned, are Prophets and Evangelists; first here naming
Prophet, and then Evangelist, because of the double efficacy for convincement
and drawing on to believe, else they may be called by one or either of the
Names; and so the Apostle elsewhere includes Evangelest, in that Phrase of
Prophet; 1 Cor. 12.28.
saying, secondarily Prophets; by which, with the phrase Evangelist used here,
and by their Ministration, and the effects, we may discern what these gifts or
this double gift is. Prophecy here not to be limited to that gift of
foretelling some events to come; which was more before, then since the
Ascension of Christ; Act. 21.10, 11.
such as that of Agabus: but it was such a spiritual Manifestation, Light,
Knowledge and Gift for teaching Christ, with such power and efficacy, as apted
and enabled them so to preach Christ, as might tend to the convincement of
unbelievers, Joh. 16.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 1 Cor. 14.24, 25.
and the throwing down all their strong holds, convincing them of the fullness
of all Foundation: for trusting in, or doors of approach to God, besides
Christ: and that he is the only Foundation and door of approach to God, which
was done in prophesying, and in this respect the gift for this, called the gift
of Prophet: Romans 10.15. Act. 11.20, 21.
and then the drawing in the convinced to believe in Christ, and so turn to the
Lord, which is the proper effect of evangelizing: and so the Apostle says, The
Word was evangelized, 1 Pet. 1.21, 2, 25.
to those that were brought in to believe: whence the gift is called Evangelist
most frequently, though also both are called, Prophet. And this is also to be
here noted, That Evangelist includes Pastor and Teacher; so, as those that had
the gift of Evangelist, had therein also the gift of Pastor and Teacher, though
all that had the gift of Pastor and Teacher, had not also all that was in the
gift of Prophet and Evangelist. And so,

The next gift here mentioned is, And some Pastors and Teachers: he says not
as before of the other, And some Pastors, and some Teachers; as if these were
several, and distinct, and different gifts, as the other: though in this, as in
the former, there may be a various distribution in the measure, to some more
than to others: 1 Cor. 12.4, 5, 8.
yet feeding and teaching is in them all; yea, feeding is by teaching, and
right teaching the way of right ruling and feeding; and so as the Apostle
includes both these Pastor and Teacher, in one word, saying, thirdly Teachers:
yea, Pastors are in and with these gifts, so as Apostles are Pastors and
Prophets and Evangelists are Pastors, and Teachers are Pastors, and all of them
are Teachers; 1 Cor. 12.28.
yet all according to their several gifts, and the measure of Faith given unto
them; and so all of them together Stewards and Shepherds: and in this is seen
something of the spiritual Kingdom of Christ in this World, as was also typed
in the temporal Kingdom of David, in which was King Priest, Prophets, and all
anointed and called Shepherds, to rule, order, lead, teach, and minister; Jer.
3.15. and 23.4, 5, 6.
and so suitable to that prophecy by Jeremiah, and a spiritual first Fruits of
it: for here is Jesus Christ the anointed of God, into whose Lips Grace is
poured, the great and mighty King, the Prophet and great High Priest over the
House of God, the good Shepherd of his Flock, sitting in his Body in the
Heavens, at the right Hand of God, (till he come again and take to him his
great Power and Reign) that is also the Anoynter, and in sending forth of
Spirit has given gifts unto Men, to get him a spiritual Kingdom amongst Men,
and to order it, till he come to take them to reign with him. 1 John 2.20.
And so he by his Spirit is present with them, and anoynteth them, and makes
them a spiritual House, an holy and royal Priesthood, 1 Pet. 2.5, 9.
to show forth his virtues, and offer spiritual Sacrifices to God by him,
suitable to, and a spiritual first Fruits of that prophesied by Isaiah: and so,
as he has put his Word, Isa. 66.20,
and therein laid the Foundation in them; so he has filled and fitted them in
his anointing, with spiritual gifts, to hold forth, teach, and so lay the same
Foundation for others, and to convince them of the falseness of all other
Foundations, and to draw and build them up on this Foundation, and to help them
to growth and feeding thereon, and for direction for walking therein, till they
come to the fullness of possession; Ephesians. 2.17, 22.
so richly were these first VVitnesses furnished in the Faith, having both the
Gospel in such full and clear knowledge, and all these spiritual gifts,
immediately from Jesus Christ himself, whose personal body they both saw and
heard, even after his Resurrection. And whereas Paul seemed to be born out of
due time for this, yet it was vouchsafes him; and he did, and was the last
that did, both hear and see him in his personal Body, and receive the Gospel
and these spiritual gifts immediately from him; 1 Cor. 15.8, 9. and 9.1, 2.
Gal. 2.11, 12, 21. Luke 16.29. 2 Pet. 1.15. and 3.2.
and by that he proves his Apostleship: and in this immediateness of receipt and
commission they have no Successors; but do continue with us in all their
knowledge and gifts, by and in the Gospel recorded by them.

3. That the end for which all these gifts were given them, was for perfecting
the Saints (that is, Ephesians. 4.12.
all that are prevailingly called by his Grace, and so united to him, and
sanctified by and to him, and for his service; not limiting this to outward
Officers, nor engaging it to all them, some of them it may be not being such
Saints; but limiting it to such Saints, and enlarging it to all them, for
perfecting them) for the work of the Ministry, (the Ministry of the Saints of
the whole Body, whereof no Member is Officeless or useless, but each has some
Service or Ministration and fitness for it, and spirit of life running therein,
and so a Ministration) for the edifying of the Body of Christ; and this such an
edification as is for the growth of the Body both in multitude of converts, and
their growth in Union, Fellowship and Conformity; every Member in this sense
growing, by the influence that proceeds from the Head; but yet not
immediately into every particular Member, nor through some outward Officers
only; but as from the Head of the mystical Body, so through every living
Member, making increase to it self in love; And so the growth of the Body by
that which every joint supplieth: for so gracious an end were these gifts given.

4. The time of the continuance of these gifts, and that is express, Till we
all come in the unity of the Faith, etc. that is, Ephesians. 4.13.
till the last Man be called that is to be called, before the personal
appearance of Christ, till we all (that is, the whole company that is to meet
with him, and to come and reign with him) meet in the unity of the Faith, and
of the knowledge (and so the acknowledgement) of the Son of God, unto a perfect
Man, Gal. 4.3, 7. Jer. 31.34. 1 Cor. 13.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 John 3.2.
(a full and complete Company, a fit and suitable Corporation or Body for such
an Head) the measure of the stature (or age) of the fullness of Christ; which,
(as the knowledge of the Freedom of Sons was by his first coming, so this) will
be at his next coming and appearing in Glory, when this manner of Ministration
will cease; but till then, they to continue in this Ministration of the Gospel.
True it is, The Gospel, that is, the Faith to be taught and received, Jude 3. 1 Timothy 6.13, 14. 2 Timothy 1.13. and 2.2. 2 Pet. 1.13, 14, 15. and 3.2. Gal. 1.6, 7.
it was once and but once, immediately given unto the Saints in these first
VVitnesses; but that very same Gospel is mediately continued, and so to be
received and held forth, and no other Gospel, nor another immediate giving of
that (unless to some Jews,) but that kept, and held forth by the Saints till
Christ come again; even so these spiritual gifts, to minister the Gospel with,
were once given, and that was when Christ ascended up in our Nature to Heaven,
Act. 2.
and then he sent them down to his Saints at once; and in this immediateness
and fullness, as then but once: but these gifts, even all of them, as mediately
received through belief of the Gospel delivered by them; which Gospel, whoever
unfeignedly believes, is become of them, and so of Christ, and so of the same
seed, the seed of them who are the seed of Christ, and the seed of Christ his
seed, and his seed's seed.

And so this Word and Gospel given them, and the spiritual gifts given them
therein and therewith, and so put in them, shall not depart out of them, nor
out of their seed, Isa. 59.20, 21.
nor out of their seed's seed, from henceforth for ever: and so will he make
good his promise to them, of being with them to the end of the World: Mat.
28.20.
and that to this gracious end, That having such a standing and enduring Gospel
recorded, and in that record revealed; and in minding, and believing thereof,
receiving such known spiritual gifts, as all lead to exalt Christ and draw to,
and build on him; We may no more be as Children, tossed to and fro, Ephesians. 4.14,
15.
and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, by the slight of Men, and
cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive: but speaking the truth
in love, we may grow up into him in all things, which is the Head, etc.

And so much for their blessed Furniture, that is of continuance, and abides
in the Church, believing and professing this Gospel in some good measure
throughout all ages. But with this they had some other Furniture tending to
confirm their Doctrine and Ministration, peculiar to the first times.

CHAP. 14.
Of the peculiar confirming Furniture of the first Witnesses and the Churches
brought in by their personal Ministration.

THese first VVitnesses had also some other gifts that were for confirmation,
which were chiefly to them, yet neither personal to every one, nor peculiar to
the first VVitnesses, but peculiar to the first age of the Church, the gifts
mentioned that are for continuance, were to some more, to some less, yet to all
some; and these were for edifying the body of Christ: but these other gifts are
not personally to every Believer; and though they were given to the Church, yet
their principal end was for unbelievers, That such as had not heard, and been
taught, and so did not know, That the Messiah, the Savior of the world was
come, and had offered up the acceptable Sacrifice; and, that this very Jesus
was he; this Jesus whom they preached is the Christ; and, that God will be
worshipped and approached to in and through him; and that such as do believe in
him, and approach to God by him, shall be saved. Till this was proclaimed,
rumoured, and taught through the world, and had been sufficiently confirmed for
truth, so, as it was received and professed by many witnesses; signs and
miracles were necessary, to convince the unbelievers of the truth of it, and to
confirm the weak and unstable in the belief of the same. And indeed for these
ends were such signs, wonders, and miracles granted to be done 1 Cor. 14.20,
21, 22.
: and so it is evident such effects they had Act. 8.13. and 13.12. and 14.3. and
16.29, 32.
, and such use the Apostles made of them Act. 2.33, 36. and 3.12. and 4.10. and
9.42. and 11.18.
: and these gifts of speaking with diverse Tongues, and of working Miracles, and
healing Diseases, were given abundantly in the first age of the Church, but not
to every Believer: yea, primely and most abundantly to the Apostles, that had
the Power or Gift of giving the Holy Ghost, in suchlike Gifts of speaking with
Tongues, by Prayer, with laying on of Hands. Philip was an Evangelist; and God
did by him show many Signs and Wonders: yet the giving of the Holy Ghost in
such Gifts of speaking with new Tongues, was not given by him, but only in
Ministry, on the Prayers and laying on of Hands, by two of the prime and
immediate Apostles Act. 8.14, 15, 16, 17.
: and so in the Preaching of Peter Act. 10.44.
; and so by the laying on of Paul's Hands Act. 19.6.
: though many had the Gift of speaking with Tongues, yet by any thing recorded,
it is not like they received it, but in the Ministry of some of the Apostles;
though the Holy Ghost, for comforting, renewing, and filling the Heart with joy
and some spiritual Gifts, was given in the Ministry of the Gospel by other
Disciples Act. 8.39. and 9.17, 18, 19.
: yea, the Promise of the Holy Ghost in this sort, is to all that God calls by
the Gospel, that in believing they may receive it Act. 2.38, 39.
. But this Gift of giving the Holy Ghost for speaking with Tongues, appears to
be peculiar to the immedately called Apostles, and for their times: but the
Gifts of healings, and doing other Wonders and Miracles, was given to diverse
others, not only Evangelists, but other Disciples, yet not to every Disciple,
nor all to one 1 Cor. 12.28, 29.
; and this to multitudes of the first Witnesses, and to diverse others brought
in by their Ministration, during their times; but not to continue for the times
to come, as the Doctrine with the forementioned Gifts were; But to confirm the
Doctrine of the Gospel, and the Grace and spiritual Gifts to be received in the
belief thereof, which was to continue till Jesus Christ come again, as appears,

1. By our Saviors manner of promising them: And these signs shall follow them
that believe, etc. he says not, Mar. 16.17.
That he (or every one) that believes, shall do these signs; as he had
foresaid, He that believes, shall be saved: but, And these signs shall follow
them that believe, in my Name they shall, etc. where, by the order of the words
according to Scripture Language, They signifies the unity and community of the
whole Society of Believers from first to last, all of them participating in
that, which but some of them have actually done: and so such as are of that
Number, Body and Society, are verily said, in respect of the unity and
community of the whole Society, to do the same that any of them do, while they
do not oppose or disallow it; yea, more fully, if they like, and be glad of it;
as the whole Body may be said to do that, which, with its living force and
likement, any one living Member does: and so They, Exodus 16.20, 27, 28.
even whole Israel, are said not to have hearkened, but transgressed; when but
some did personally so transgress: and so They, Numb. 20.14. with Judge. 11.17.
even Israel, are said to have sent Messengers to the King of Edom, and the
King of Moab; when it was but Moses and the chief of the Rulers that sent: and
so They, Israel, Josh. 7.11.
are said to have sinned and transgressed God's Covenant; when it was but one
Man that personally did it. And this sense the Apostle counts it a shame for
Christians to be ignorant of. 1 Cor. 5.6.
And to come nearer this very business, that God did by Moses, Aaron and Joshua
to those of Israel, personally in their times, is yet counted as done to the
whole Society of Israel, Isa. 63.11, 16.
and the Generations of them, and that after them, many Generations, and many
hundreds of years; and so looked on and spoke of, because of their oneness and
interest as, Them; and because of oneness, Him, for, and to whom God by Moses
did these things: and the People of Israel, Jer. 12.6, 7, 19, 20. Act. 16.18.
and 28.3, 5. and 12.5, 19. and 2.4, 6. and 10.46. 1 Cor. 14.18. Act. 9.33, 34,
41. and 28.8. and 8.17, 18.
in aftertimes and Generations, reproved for not acknowledging the same. And
though all the Apostles did, be not writ; yet so much is writ, that we may know
they, and many of the first Witnesses, and many that believed through their
Ministration in the first times, did all these Signs mentioned by our Savior:
and now those that believe in Christ through their word, are one with them: of
this they, of the same Society; we theirs, and they ours, of the same unity and
community, Ephesians. 2.17, 22. 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. and 12.26. and so, Psalm. 66.6.
as they of old are said to rejoice in God in their Father's rejoicing when
they went through the Sea, and to be spoken to by God, when he spoke to Jacob,
or in that speaking: so, and in that sense may they, Hos. 12.4.
the whole Society of Believers, both then and now, be said to do these signs,
which those of the first times personally did.

2. But this will more appear by the words, Mar. 16.17.
Shall follow them that believe; for as the Signs and Wonders done by Moses,
and in his Ministration did follow the Israelties, that is, accommodate them in
all after-Ages, till the Messiah promised came: not in being done over again,
but in that, first, Deuteronomy. 6.6, 7, 20, 24. with Exodus 12.26, 27.
they were left upon record, together with the Law and Doctrine confirmed by
them; in which they had those Signs, together with the Law and Doctrine to
teach their Children and one another. And secondly, in having, and believing,
Psa. 78. all.
and minding the Law and Doctrine so confirmed, they had all those Signs also
to mind and believe. And thirdly, Psa. 66.6. Hos. 12.4. Jer. 32.19, 20, 21.
Mat. 12.38, 39. and 16.1, 4.
in minding and believing the Doctrine confirmed by those Signs, they had the
same use and benefit of those Signs, for farthering their confidence and
rejoicing in God, in praying to him, seeking help of him, and resting on him
for it in every need, as they had in whose personal sight they were done. And
so did these Signs follow them: Mar. 8.11, 12. Luke 11.29. Joh. 2.18. and 6.30,
31. Heb. 12.22, 23.
and it was an evil and adulterous Generation, that did call for the doing them
over again; even so the Believers being come into the same Society and
Congregation with the first Witnesses, The Apostle in this very sense takes in
all the Believers to the coming of Christ, using that word we, 1 Cor. 15.51. 1
These. 4.15. And in this sense we all may be said to have those Signs done by
the first Witnesses to follow us, and to accommodate us, in that they are left
upon Record for us in the Record of the Gospel that was confirmed by them, Luke
2.1, 4. Joh. 20.31. Romans 15.4. Mar. 16.20. Heb. 2.4. 1 Cor. 14.20, 21. Isa.
28.11, 12, 13. Luke 16.31.
that therein and thereby we may have the same use for minding and teaching
them, and being confirmed in the Faith of the Gospel, and so for farthering our
confidence, as they of the first times had; yea, they are affirmed to be writ
for that end: and it is a Sign of an evil heart, to call for these Signs to be
done over again; which, if it should be granted, yet would not such evil hearts
believe. And as this appears, both by the manner of Christ his promising, and
the words in his promise: so it does also appear,

3. By the Apostles setting them down; having set down the abiding gifts,
first, second, third sort, he says, After that, 1 Cor. 12.28.
miracles, then gifts of healing, helps in Government, diversities or kinds of
tongues. After God had called Moses and Aaran, and spoken by them to the
Children of Israel, and sent them to speak to Pharaoh, he added Signs and
Wonders that made the Enemies say, This is the finger of God: and he fights
for Israel, and causes Israel to believe his Words, and sing his Praise. But
those Signs were not to be done over again, but remembered in all Generations
following: and so much the Apostle intimates here by the word afterward, as an
addition and overplus for a time.

All that may seem to darken this sense, is, because helps in Government is
named among these Gifts: to which, answer might be given, That the naming them
with these, does no more equal them, and make them of the like Nature for their
Tendency and Temporariness, then the naming things indifferent, and evil only
in the use by Circumstance, in one and the same sentence with things simply and
absolutely evil, Act. 15.20.
does equal them, and make them of like Nature and Tendency at all times. And
yet this placing helps in Government, among the things that come in afterward,
and in the midst of those temporary Gifts, does instruct us also,

1. That these helps in Government, Elders, and Deacons, and such outward
Offices, were not of the Essence of those spiritual Gifts, which Christ
ascended up to Heaven to give: but such as in the Wisdom of those spiritual
Gifts given, they might, as occasion and need was, after appoint or elect; and
so those came in afterward, as has been foreshewn.

2. That these helps in Government, are not of the Essence of the Church, nor
simply requisite thereto: the Church was before them, and truly in being
before it had them: and these came afterward into the Church for outward Order
and Ornament, as is foreshewn; yea, it may be to instruct us,

3. That as those outward Offices had not their rise immediately in the first
pouring forth of the heavenly Gifts, but afterward; so they shall not have
their continuance in the true Church and Sanctuary, the real and mystical Body
of Christ, till his personal coming again, as those spiritual Gifts shall,
though they were of longer continuance then the Miracles and Gifts of Healing,
and diversites of Tongues for outward acting were: a time was foreseen to
come, when some of these outward Officers would fall from Heaven, (from the
simplicity of Christ, and receiving their Knowledge and Furniture from the
Gospel believed, even the Testimony of Jesus, that is, the Spirit of Prophecy,
and came from Heaven; and those spiritual Gifts and Furniture received in
belief thereof, which came from Heaven) and so fall to the Earth, in love of
the Learning, Philosophy, Rev. 19.20.
Arts and Sciences of the Gentiles; and with that, interpret and teach, using
it as the Key of Knowledge, and so bring in a smoke, covering the Face of the
Gospel and Church with Darkness. And such Officers getting to be the chief in
the outward Court, the outward Court would be left unto the Gentiles, and then
the Man of sin would enter, and sit therein, and he would be making Apostles,
Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers; and none should be counted so, but those of
his making and calling: and if by his usurped Power and feigned Miracles, he
could not generally persuade Men of this, yet he would claim such Authority for
ordaining Bishops and Deacons, that there should be none acknowledged but of
his ordaining; yea, he and the Officers ordained by him, shall bear the Name of
the Church and Clergy; as if out of Union with them, no Salvation: and all that
will not submit to, and acknowledge this Power in him and his Officers, shall
soon be thrust out of Office, and excommunicated out of the outward Court of
the Church; and then the Holy City, the true Church and Sanctuary, would be
trodden under Foot, Rev. 11.1, 2, 3. 2 These. 2.4. Joh. 6.2.
and clothed with sackcloth in disgrace and persecution: yet the Testimony of
Jesus, and Truth and Verity of all these spiritual Gifts, was in, and would
remain and be in this Sanctuary, the true, though despised Church, and stripped
of her outward Ornaments and Officers: and Power is given to these, by
spiritual Gifts and Virtue, to witness the Testimony of Christ still in all
this time. And as God forsook Shilo where his Tabernacle was in Canaan first
pitched, for the wickedness thereof, Jer. 7.12
and returned his Tabernacle no more thither; Rev. 12.1.
so God may reject this outward Court, (in which his Sanctuary once was, and
his Glory shined in it) and for the wickedness of it, never beautify it with
his true Sanctuary again; but preserve his true Sanctuary by his Word and
Spirit, till Christ come; Rev. 11, and 19.
and the Holy Ones beneath, and the Holy Ones above do meet, and the false
Prophet be slain, and the Church become a Kingdom; which, whether hinted in
leaving out the Name of the outward Court, Heb. 9. I will not say, but only
that the placing helps in Government, among such Temporary things as came in
afterward, may afford these instructions to us: and so leave it to each man, as
Light of Truth persuades.

But for the Gospel, and these spiritual Gifts given from Heaven, that they
have already been abundantly confirmed by Miracles, and they so divinely
recorded, as is enough to confirm Faith, and no need of doing them over again,
is that affirmed and proved; and yet to make it more clear and evident, we have
it expressly testified,

4. By the Apostles own words to the Hebrews, when having set forth the
excellency of Christ, as in Testimony of him set forth, and then exhorted them
to diligent heed taking thereto; Heb. 1. and 2.1, 2, 3, 4.
he admonishing them says, How shall we escape if we neglect so great
Salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord; and was after
confirmed unto us by them that heard him: God also bearing them witness, both
with signs and wonders, and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy Ghost,
according to his own will? So that the Gospel has been confirmed above all
that the Law of Moses was: and as the Miracles confirming that, was no more to
be iterated after the Law was once taught, settled and confirmed; but those
remembered with the Law; yea, the Prophets that came after, endeavoring to move
them to deviate from that Law, with Signs and Wonders, Deuteronomy. 13.
were not to be believed or hearkened to: so we are now warned for these times,
that false Prophets, false Christ's and Antichrists, will come with signs and
wonders to deceive, and draw credit to their false Doctrine with. Mat. 24.24.
Mar. 12.22. 2 These. 2.10.
So that which we are now to heed, is the Word of the Testimony of Christ; in
which is testified, Jesus to be The Christ, the Apostles and first Witnesses to
have declared his Mind, even the Gospel, according to the Revelation of the
Mystery, and the spiritual gifts with which they went forth; and the Gospel
revealing all this, to be taught and left upon record by them, Mat. 24.14. Romans
10.18.
the sound whereof went through the whole World, before the first Witnesses all
of them left the World. And it was, and has been settled in many Churches in
diverse parts of the World, and sufficiently confirmed with Signs, Wonders,
Miracles and miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost already; and they also written,
that we might believe.

And thus have I shown, according to this last and fullest Revelation of
Christ, who were chosen in and by him the first Instruments for laying the
Foundation, and beginning the building on it; and so to set this glorious
Ministration on foot, and how plentifully they were furnished. Now it is
needful also to show the Furniture of the following Witnesses that are of the
same society and house, and to carry on this Ministration to the same end, till
the return and personal appearing of Jesus Christ.

CHAP. 15.
Of the Furniture of the following Witnesses till Christ come again.

WHo are the chosen of God in Christ, to be, Part 3. c. 11.
and so are these Witnesses to carry on this blessed business till Christ come
again, is already before shown; and that they are such as through belief of his
Grace in the Testimony of Christ delivered by the Apostles, are by his Spirit
built on Christ; and so come unto Mount Sion, Heb. 12.22, 2 24.
and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem; and to an
innumerable company of Angels, to the general Assembly of the firstborn, which
are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of just
Men made perfect, and to Jesus thn Mediator of the New Covenant, etc. and so
have fellowship with the Prophets, 1 John 1.3. Ephesians. 2.19, 22. Isa. 59.20, 21.
Phil. 2.15.16. Heb. 3.6. 1 Timothy 3.15.
and Apostles, and so with the Father and the Son, being now fellow-Citizens
with the Saints, and of the household of God, build upon the Foundation, etc.
having the same Word and Spirit in their Heart, and in their Mouth, which the
Apostles had: these are to hold forth the Word of Life, etc. as has been
shown: for these are the House of God, and of Christ; the Church of the living
God, the Pillar and Ground of Truth. So that,

1. Isa. 43.10. Act. 13.47.
As a Pillar was used for a Witness of Peace, Genesis 31.51, 52. so these are
God's Witnesses to the World, of Christ being his salvation to the ends of the
Earth, to open the eyes of the blind, etc.

2. Isa. 43.10, 11. 1 John 2.2. 2 Cor. 5.19. Romans 3.25. 1 Timothy 1.16. Heb. 12.1.
As the Pillar of the Cloud was a Testimony of God's presence, and a Guide to
Israel, Exodus 13. so these are God's Witnesses and Holders forth of his
presence and propitiatoriness to the World, as Preachers and Patterns, that
they might repent, and come in to follow him. God spoke to his People in a
cloudy Pillar, Psalm. 97.7, 8. and through the same Pillar looked upon the
Egyptians, and troubled them, Exodus 14.24. and so by and through these, God
speaks unto the World, 2 Cor. 5.20.
and manifests the savor of his knowledge through them, 2 Cor. 2.14, 17.
which proves a savor of Life unto Life in them that in believing receive it,
and a savor of death unto them that oppose and rebel against it.

3. As a Pillar: the word is sometimes used to express some chief ones, as Gal.
2.9. so whereas God has testified his goodness in that rumor of the Gospel
proclaimed in Paradise, and in his works of Creation and Providence, and after
by Types and Prophesies, and after by the Forerunner of his Son, Ephesians 3.3, 4,
5, 6, 9, 10. 1 Pet. 1.11, 12. 1 Timothy 3.16.
and had Instruments suitable to each for Ministration; yet when his Son is
manifest as come in the Flesh, who is the Brightness of his Glory, and chief
Testimony of his goodness: so in that respect, the Ministers that thus hold him
forth, they are the chief, and such are these, and the Church now.

4. A Pillar is used for an upholder and stay, and so the Truth is the upholder
and stay of the Church, and the giver of Authority to it; and not the Church
the stay of, and Authority-giver to the Truth; yet even in this respect also,
as Christ is the Head of the Church, and his Truth and Spirit; and he thereby
an Indweller in the Church: so they in holding forth the Truth, are
instrumental upholders of it, Act. 9.15. 2 Timothy 4.7. Mat. 5.14.
and maintainers of the Faith to the World, and so the Light of the World: and
in respect of some in the outward Court, that turn the Grace of God into
wantonness, pervert the Gospel, deceive the World, and labor to beguile
Believers in turning them from the Faith; These are the Keepers of the Faith by
teaching it, and opposing and fighting with the sword of the Spirit, against
their profaneness and errors; and so maintaining the Faith against their
falsehoods. And in all these senses, the Church that are these Witnesses, 2 Timothy
4.1, 7. 2 Cor. 10.4, 5, 6. Jude 3, 4.
is the Pillar of Truth; and yet more fully, in one sense more, including all
the former in it, This Church is the Pillar and Ground of Truth, taking in as
is given us, both the words; that is to say,

5. As they were of old to write the Commandments and Statutes of the Lord upon
the door-posts of their house, Deuteronomy. 6.9. and 11.20.
and their gates, (as the Ten words were written in Tables of stone) that they
might be seen and read: and as some say, The Prophets did hang or fasten their
written Prophesies upon one of the Pillars in the Temple, as is the use of the
chief Magistrate to have his Proclamation fastened on some noted post or pillar,
in the Marketplace, where all the Country may take notice of it, and read it:
so these are the Church or House, and so that post and pillar the Table or
Ground, in, and upon whom the Truth is so written, that all may read it, though
some with likement, and some with dislike; as the Apostle has plainly
affirmed, saying to the Church, Ye are our Epistle, written in our hearts, seen
and read of all Men; forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle
of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the
living God; not in Tables of stone (as the Law of old was,) but in the fleshly
Tables of the heart: in which there is a performance spiritually by Christ of
that said to the Prophet of old, Write the Vision, Feb. 2.2.
and make it plain upon Tables, Isa. 29 11, 12.
that he may run that reads it; and being taken with that read, he may read
to others, even that Vision of All: and others may read it on him. And this
writing is the very work of Christ, by his Spirit in Ministry of the Gospel.
We never read that Christ did personally in his own Body, write any part of the
Scripture; that work he left for his Servants by his Spirit to do: yet once we
find that he wrote with his Finger on the ground, as not regarding his
Tempters; Joh. 8.6.
yet what he wrote is not said: but to say the Apostle alludeth to that, I dare
not: nor yet will I say it was an intimate Instruction of his own work, so
freely to write by his Finger (which often signifies his Spirit) his Epistle in
the ground of the heart of his unworthy ones: but this I may say in treating of
his spiritual writing, To allude to this is no error. But however, it clearly
appears, this Society and Church spoken of, is the Pillar and ground of Truth,
where Truth is written and holden forth to be read; 1 Timothy 3.16.
yea, even the Truth that is the Mystery of godliness, that great Mystery, God
was manifested in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit, etc. And so these
unfeigned Believers united to Christ, having his word (as delivered by his
Apostles) in their heart, be his Witnesses now, and the Ministers he has
chosen for this Ministration, to minister according to the grace and gifts
given them (none presuming beyond) these are the holy City and Sanctuary of his
building, and the Ministers of the things thereof, Rev. 11.1, 2, 3.
to whom he gives Spirit and Power, that they may witness him even to the
World; and among these is the true Altar, even in this Temple, and these are
the Worshippers thereat: and because of the Gospel in their hearts, and there
through some portion of these forementioned spiritual gifts, by which they
witness him, and hold forth the word of life with their tongues: therefore
their tongue is said to be as choice silver, and their lips to feed many; Prove.
10.21, 22. Pro. 15, 10. Psa. 35.28. and 71.24. and 119.172. and 51.31. 1 These.
1.8. 1 Cor. 3.3, 18. Gal. 5.22, 23.
their tongue uses knowledge aright, and speaks of God's righteousness and
praise all the day; yea, even so as sinners may be converted to him; and so
from them the word of God sounds forth. And also by the same Spirit in the
Gospel, their hearts being framed to the mind and design of Christ, they so
have a Christ-like Spirit springing up, Love, Joy, Peace, etc. which leads
them to walk in Faith and Love, in Holiness and Mercy, Mat. 5.16.
etc. So that also hereby they do witness of him, and hold forth the word of
Life also in their conversation in good works and holy profession: whence the
Fruit of the Righteous is called, A Tree of Life, Prove. 11.30. Ezekiel. 47.12.
Rev. 22.2. 2 Cor. 9.2.
(and a way of winning Souls;) yea, their Fruit is for Meat, and their Leaf for
Medicine; so their Conversation wins, and their Zeal provokes many: and
because the Spirit of Glory rests on them, 1 Pet. 4.10, 11 14.
and gives them power to glorify God in witnessing both these ways, though
through sufferings; Therefore in respect of their twofold witnessing and
holding forth the word of Life, to glorify God and do good to Men, convincing
by Truth, and comforting with Truth, and confuting falsehood; Rev. 11, 4.
They are also called the two Witnesses that witness; yea, that witness the
Truth on God's part against the Man of sin, and God of the World; and the two
Olive Trees that bring forth that good Fruit whence the good Oil runs; and
the two Candlesticks that hold forth the true Light that shines: so that every
way it appears that these unfeigned Believers, united to Christ in him by
Faith, and he in them by Word and Spirit, are his chosen Ones, to bring forth
Fruit, his Ministers for carrying an end the Ministration of this last
Revelation of Christ till he come again: these are the Temple of God, the House
of God, the Church of God, (I need not to use worldly terms, else I might show
how;) these are the Achademah or School, University and College, in which are
all the Scholars that are taught of God. And I might show how Christ is here
the chief Master, Doctor and Rabbi, and the Prophets and Apostles the Masters.
of this Assembly; the Scriptures, the Library; the Testimony of Jesus, the
Original; the Holy Spirit therein, the Interpreter; the way of Learning and
coming to knowledge, is Attention and believing; the Fellows and Collegiates
are all that are built upon Jesus, and so one in this spiritual house; the
pupils are all that like or desire to learn the Doctrine of the Gospel, though
yet hardly believing, or weak and unstable in the Faith; or believing the Truth
of the Gospel, and professing it, but not so prevailed with by it, as to be
united to Christ, and framed to his Mind, so as to have his word in their
heart, these not yet to be Teachers but Learners; but the residue all Teachers
according to the measure of Faith and Gifts given them, and their acts are
Fellowship in the Gospel; and to those acts the World may come also to hear.
And all the Ministers God approves and sends forth to minister Gospel to the
World, they are brought up in, and sent forth of this University, being Members
thereof, as is proved in that already said; and yet I would add one proof more,
even from the Prayer of our Savior for these, in John 17. where having prayed
for the fitness, furniture and blessing on the ministration of those
immediately called, chosen, taught and set forth by himself, he proceeds in
that Prayer, saying, Joh. 17.6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and verse.
20.
Neither do I pray for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me
through their word, (which is no other but his own word, he received of the
Father, and gave to them:) and so it is through their Ministration of the word;
and so the same word, and as ministered and recorded by these first VVitnesses,
who were immediately sent forth by him, with this Ministration, for the
Obedience of Faith among all Nations, and for all that believe through their
word, He prays,

Verse. 21. That they all (he says not some only or the chief Officers they
shall choose, but the unfeigned Believers, even they all) may be one, as thou
Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. Which
cannot be meant of the Essence of God, because he speaks of Ministration; nor
is it meant only of being one in him by the Spirit of Faith relying on him,
though this be included; yea, the union of the Father and Son in will for
Ministration, and of the Father in the Son, and the Son in the Father, and so
the union between them, is more then so; yea, I may say, there is such an union
between them, as is higher then we can conceive, and incommunicable also,
though the benefit of it be communicable; but the union here meant, appears by
that foregoing, and this following, with the scope of the business, to be the
union of the Spirit for Ministration, as the Father was and is one, and of one
mind in Christ, that he should make peace by his blood, and then preach peace,
that Men might believe; and that in preaching peace, he should speak his words,
that he gave him, and seek his ends for glorifying him, in displaying and
extending Salvation to Men; and eternally saving believing Men. So Christ was
one in and with the Father in all this: and in the same love with the same
design, did both make peace by his Blood, and preach peace in the same words,
and for the same end the Father gave them to him, and so are they one in the
same love and design, for the good of Mankind in this Ministration of
peace-preaching to bring Men in to believe, and to preserve Believers to
eternal Life. And now having committed the Ministry of Reconciliation by
peace-preaching to his first VVitnesses, and prayed for, and begun to frame
them into union with him in this design, he prays therewith, for all that
unfeignedly believe on him through their word, and so are united to him by
Faith and Love, that they may be framed by the same Spirit of Faith to his
mind, and so be one in the Father and him, in the same love and the same
design, for carrying forth this Ministration as he did; and to the same ends,
though through like sufferings, as he did, and as the first VVitnesses did,
that so we may be one together with them, and all one in the Father and the Son
in this love and design pursued in the same way for Ministration. And this to
be the union meant, appears also in the next words, which are, That the world
(that is, such as yet believe not) may believe that thou have sent me: (which
can be no less, Verse. 21.
then that through their Ministration carried forth in such love and union of
Spirit and way, such as yet believe not, may believe, etc.) And this to be the
meaning, the next words show,

Verse. 22. And the glory which thou gave me, I have given them, (which is not
the glory he had with the Father before the world was, and with which he is now
glorified at the Father's right hand, for that was not then as yet given to
him, as he was Man, but to be given him on the finishing his whole work for
suffering and overcoming death, and his own immediate personal Ministration and
his Ascension into Heaven, and offering up the acceptable sacrifice, and then
was that glory given him; so that of this glory he speaks not but of) the
glory of the Ministration, given him immediately of the Father; which was a
more great and glorious Ministration then ever before given to Moses, or any of
the Priests, or Prophets, or John Baptist: and so it is called the glorious
Gospel. And this Ministration with commission, with power, and authority, and
Spirit he received immediately from the Father, and so gave it as immediately
to the first VVitnesses, and now here mediately through the belief of their
Gospel, unto all unfeigned Believers in every age that through their word
believe; to them, and all them, our Savior gives this glory of the commission,
power and authority for Ministration: Verse. 22.
and that to these ends, both that they may be one, even as we are one, (in
that union forementioned;) and so,

Verse. 23. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one. I
in them: The Nature of all Mankind is in me in which I have died their Death,
and suffered the Curse that was due for their sins, and made peace for them by
my Blood, and offered the acceptable Sacrifice, and obtained eternal
Redemption, and received in the Nature of Man, Remission of sins, and fullness
of Spirit, Grace, Truth, and Eternal Life for Men; that in believing, Men might
receive me; and in receiving me, receive it all. And now these believing,
though not by my immediate personal Ministration, yet by my mediate
Ministration, through the Word recorded by my first Witnesses that received it
immediately from me, they in believing come in to me; and receiving my words,
they receive me. So that I by my word, and in that by my Spirit, with all the
heavenly riches and treasures I am filled with in their Nature, am thus
spiritually in them, and pray that I may so be still, and more abundantly.
Verse. 23. 23.
And thou in me: the Father is in the Son, and all that is the Fathers is the
Sons; so that as he that in believing receives the Gospel, does receive Christ
therein; and he that receives Christ, receives the Father; and so from both
that Holy Spirit, that uniteth both to Father and Son, and frames to oneness
of mind, love and design: and so for that farther end also here expressed, that
being made perfect in one, and so in this unity of Spirit in love and design,
their design may prosper in this, That the world may know that thou have sent
me (the Savior of the World, and that the World through me might be saved, and
so that I am the Christ) and (that thou) have loved them (these that believe in
me, and in love minister Gospel to them in my Name) as thou have loved me.
Which if any one come to know and believe what a one Christ is, and how he
loves and approves them and their Ministration, who also are as patterns to
them: this will draw them also to believe and be pulling them out of the World
into the Church. Joh. 4.10. 1 Cor. 2.8. 1 John 1.1, 2, 3, 4. Joh. 17.24.
The next Petition is for glory to be conferred on them after their
Ministration; the hope whereof, is an encouragement and support to them in
their Ministration through all sufferings.

And by all this our Savior gives us to understand, both who be his chosen
Ministers, and also what their Furniture is; and the same that appears in our
Savior's Prayer, is to be seen likewise in the practice and counsel of the
Apostles, who were so filled with, and guided by the Holy Spirit, as to be
unerring both in delivery of their Doctrine, and direction for the
Ministration; 2 Timothy 1.13. Gal. 1.8. 2 Timothy 3.4. and 4.5. 1 Cor. 11.2, 23. 2 Timothy 1.14. 1 Timothy 6.20.
so as it is well done of their followers, to keep both Gospel and Ministration
as they delivered the same: and they committed the Gospel and things thereof,
to such as were known to be faithful, and endued with the Holy Ghost, and
charged them to commit the same to faithful Men, not limiting it to outward
Officers, (though in such an Epistle as was most needful to name them, 2 Timothy
2.2.
if such a thing had been intended) but to faithful Men (whether such Officers
or no.) But more need not be said of this: enough is shown before, proving
these the spiritual House, the royal Priesthood, the chosen Generation, his
chosen Ministers to show forth his praises.

But yet a word or two more, to make plain the Furniture those following
Ministers have: and in this Revelation of Christ, we shall also find that for
Furniture,

1. They have the Word or Gospel discovering Christ; Joh. 14 21, 22, 23. 1 John 2.14, 24. Isa. 59.21. 2 John 2. Ephesians. 3.17. Heb. 12.22. Isa. 78.16. and
46.13. 1 Pet. 2.6. Isa. 40.9.
and so Christ in that Gospel in their heart, and so are come to Sion, and so
are of Sion, and the Foundation is laid in Sion, (that is Christ as set forth
in the Gospel) for Sion to hold forth to others the same Foundation, that they
may come in and be built thereon; yea, this word has come from Sion, Jerusalem
that is above, and is the Mother of us all, Joel 2.23. Gal. 4.26. and is in the
Heart, Fellowship and Ministration of Sion. that part of it, which though in
heart and Spirit above, Phil. 3.20. Col. 3.1. yet in Sion has God taken up his
rest, and will abundantly bless her: Psa. 132.13, 14, 15. Joel 3.21. Psa. 77.2.
he dwells there; yea, the Lord loves the Gates of Sion more then all the
dwellings of Jacob besides; And so we may say, This Ministration, more then all
that fore-went it. So that the word of Truth, of Life and Salvation is here, as
in the outward record; so in the understanding and heart, and flows forth
from hence as a first fruits of that, Isa. 2.3. Mic. 4.2.

2, They in believing and embracing this word, have with it the Holy Spirit,
Isa. 59.21. Romans 8, 9, 10. 1 John 2.20. and 3.24. Ephesians. 4.7. 2 Cor. 12.4, 7, 11.
Jer. 30.17. Isa. 35.2, 3. Cant. 6.8, 9. Cant. 1.7, 8.
effecting the Spirit and Mind of Christ in them all: and in some good measure
enduing them with all the first mentioned spiritual gifts among them, to every
one some, though not to all and every one alike. Thus are they furnished. And
this may be truly said of Sion, whom no Man seeks after, they are in worldly
appearance made so like their Lord, and there are so many Concubines; though
this Beloved be but one, and the only one of her Mother, that for discerning
her, that prayer is needful, Show me where thou feedest, etc. and the direction
there given, needful; and to such as do discern it, it may be said, as Psalm.
48.12, 13, 14.

But now because these following VVitnesses, that part of Sion yet below, have
not the Gospel, and these spiritual gifts, so immediately from Christ, and so
not in so full a measure, as that they are always infallibly freed from erring
in every particular thing altogether in delivery of Doctrine and Ministration,
as the first witnesses were: but as they have received their Doctrine and
Ministration mediately in belief of, and receiving the Doctrine and Gospel as
delivered by them, that are Sion now above: so their preservation from error in
Doctrine and Ministration, is mediate likewise, Prove. 6.20, 23. 1 Timothy 4.15,
16. 2 Timothy 3.14, 17. Col. 3.16.
even in heeding the Gospel received from God and Christ, by them, and
delivered by them to us: and so both the Commandment of our Father, and the Law
of our Mother in one, to be embraced and kept by us: and so we are directed,
and commanded, and promise of guidance given us therein. And so,

3. Romans 1.16. 1 These. 2.13.
They are furnished with Matter, Rules, Directions and Cautions in this
Doctrine of the Gospel, as delivered and recorded by the Apostles; and which
they also in believing it have in their hearts savingly working. And this
helpful,

1. For speaking right and wholesome words in Faith and Love, and to
edification, Pro. 22.20, 21. Eccles. 12.10, 11.
learning, and comfort, Rev. 19.10. 2 Timothy 1.13. 1 Cor. 4.6. and 14.3.

2. 1 Cor. 4.6. Prove. 22.21. Romans 15.4. Col. 2, 18.
For keeping measure and due order in our speakings, that upon no pretense or
presumption of Learning, Parts, Invention or Office, we presume to speak of
things we have not seen in the word of the Gospel; having that also to testify
withal: And so, that none go beyond the proportion of Faith dealt to him, even
that which he is, without taking it on trust from others; Romans 12.3, 4, 6, 7,
8. 2 Cor. 12.4, 5, 6, 12.
enabled to see and understand in the Gospel; so as verily, thereby to believe:
and that his venting be not in imitation of other Men's Gifts and
Administrations; but according to the Manifestation of the Spirit and Grace
given him, freely operating and leading him forth, and not straining beyond
that.

3. For giving this honor to no Man on Earth, how learned soever, or in what
Office soever, or of what parts, excellency, Mat. 23.9, 10. Isa. 8.20. 2 These.
5.20, 21. Col. 2.8, 18. Gal. 1.6, 7, 8. Romans 3.4. 1 Cor. 7.23. Gal. 1.10. 2
Cor. 4.5, 6. 1 John 4.6.
or appearing godliness soever, as to make, count, or call him our Rabbi,
Master or Teacher; so as to take any matter of Faith on trust from him for
Truth: or to be waved from the belief of, or holding forth the Truth of the
plain-sayings of Christ in the Gospel, out of fear to make such a one a liar:
or to temper our Doctrine and delivery, so as it may suit with any cross
sayings of his; yea, to give this honor of taking this upon trust, to none but
God and Christ; Mat. 23.8.
and so to him for his sake, taking it from his Prophets and Apostles, by whom,
in the Record left by them, he speaks to us still. And that none desire or take
this honor to himself: but let God and Christ by his Spirit in the Gospel
delivered, and recorded by his first Witnesses, be our Father, Rabbi, and
Master, for Faith and Love, and all holy walking; and we as Brethren.

4. For keeping the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, Ephesians. 4.2, 3. 1
Cor. 4.6, 7. and 12.4, 11. Phil. 2.3, 4, 5.
that we be not any of us puffed up with the excellency of our own Gifts or
Administrations, nor discontent at the meanness thereof, in respect of others;
nor despise or discountenance others, for their meanness therein; but
acknowledging God and Christ in all, and in love preferring one another, Romans
14.32, 21. and 15.1, 4.
that we judge not, and despise not one another for difference in some outward
things, through the knowledge or want of the knowledge of our Liberty in
Christ, nor trouble the weak Brethren with doubtful disputations: But with all
lowliness and meekness, with all long-suffering, forbearing one another in
love, Ephesians. 4.2, 3, 4. 1 Cor. 1.6, 10 Phil. 3.14, 1^
endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit (in the Gospel-Love and design
forementioned) in the bond of peace, that we may all speak the same thing in
the Testimony of Christ, confirmed among us: and if in any thing any of us be
otherwise minded, to wait for God in the Ministration, to reveal the same to
him: nevertheless, to walk by the same Rule of faith and love, according to
that we have attained; and so mind the same thing, that there be no divisions
among us, so shall all men know us to be Christ's Disciples. Joh. 13.35.


5. For keeping clear and fair the Name and Truth that is written upon us: 1 Timothy 6.11, 12, 13, 14. Tit. 2.10. Phil. 2.27. Col. 3.17. 1 Cor. 10.31.
that we follow after Righteousness, Holiness, Purity, Mercy, good Works; and
fly all Pride, Wrath, Malice, Coverousness, Fraud, Lying, Uncleanness,
Intemperancy, etc. that we do not blur or deface the Name and Writing that is
upon us, but adorning the Gospel we profess, doing all things heartily as to
the Lord in the Name of Christ, to the glory of God, and good of Men.

6. 1 Cor. 16.14. 2 Cor. 5.14. 1 Cor. 13. 1 Cor. 8.1, 2, 3. and 14.1, 2, 5, 12.
For the profiting in speaking and walking, that it may take place with, and be
edifying to others, to see that all our speakings and doings be done in
charity, with the love and bowels of Christ moving us with desire of the good
of others; without which, all Knowledge, Faith, Gifts, Works or Sufferings,
will not avail us in this profiting: and so in desire of spiritual gifts, that
we desire them not for our own applause or exaltation, but for the edifying of
the Church; and that in this desire also, we do more earnestly desire and
follow after charity.

And these with suchlike are the constant and abiding helps given in the
Gospel for Believers, which in living by Faith, they may always have and use,
and so be preserved from erring in Doctrine, Ministration or Manners: so that
here is a sufficient gracious helpfulness and Furniture, always needful, and
always at hand, for all times till Christ come again: yet in respect of some
occasions, there is yet needful to them some other helps, as order and helps in
Government, with which they are also furnished in this Revelation of Christ in
the Gospel.

CHAP. 16.
Of the helps in respect of occasions which are given these witnesses.

FOr the increase and multitudes of Believers and Professors of the Faith
brought in by this Ministration, because their Societies and Assemblies may
come to be both many, and many of them great and numerous; and because their
employments in this World be many and various; and because many brought in to
believe the Report of the Gospel to be a Truth, are not yet by it convinced of
their own unbelievingness, vileness, and the emptiness of their own
righteousness; Joh. 2.23, 24. and 8.31, 36.
vileness, and the emptiness of their own righteousness; and some though
convinced, yet not prevailingly wrought upon to be through-hearted, in cleaving
and submitting to Christ to have all their life in him, and live to him, though
in abiding in this belief of the Truth, and attending this Ministry of it, it
will save them, and work them up to the Truth that will make them free; both
which, though Attenders, and of the outward Society, yet not the true
Sanctuary; and so to be Learners, and not the Teachers: yea, it may be also,
some in some measure unfeignedly believing, and yet Novices, newly come to the
Faith, 1 Timothy 3.6.
may be ready to speak beyond the proportion of Faith given them; yea, and it
may so be, that some feigned and dissembling ones, yea, and disorderly ones
also, may creep into the outward profession, and so be of this Society in
profession, and so the outward Court, though while such, not in nor of the
Sanctuary and holy Place, of which has before been spoken: and by reason of
this, if help be not had, disorder and confusion will be found in, and
blemishes besal the whole Society: but for remedy hereof, there are helps
afforded:

One for Constancy; and that is order in speaking in the Assembly, that but one
speak at once, and the rest be silent: and so two or three may speak one after
another, so it be in order: and after, while time and silence is, may be a
sober Questioning, as in 1 Cor. 14. at large.

And the other Help, is Helps in Government, which is to be used, when and in
such times and places, as they may be enjoyed. And this is to ordain certain
Brethren into certain Offices, and set them in the same, for better carrying on
of the Ministration in the several and great Societies and Assemblies, and for
the comfort and enlargement, and more orderly and beautiful proceedings in the
Church, and of the Affairs in her Assemblies, and for convincing and stopping
the mouths of unbelievers, that may come into their Assemblies to hear them.
And these Officers chofen into these Offices, Tit. 1.5, 7. Phil. 7.1. 1 Timothy
3.1, 2. and 5.17. Phil. 1.1. 1 Timothy 3.8, 10, 12, 13.
are, first, Bishops or elders, (for both these Names are the Names of one and
the same Office.) And secondly, Deacons, called also Ministers. And about these
the Gospel affords us many Directions, some intimate, some express; all plain:
which for understanding I will instance some, as,

1. Act. 14.23. and 20.17, 28. Col. 1.7. and 4.12.
That these Offices appertain to the Church; and the Officers are to execute
their Office in and to the Church in those Assemblies, for and in those
Assemblies where they are chosen and set: Act. 11.19, 20, 24. and 15.22, 32
as for their preaching to the World and Unbelievers, or service they may do in
other places or Assemblies, it is by virtue of the Gospel in their hearts, and
the spiritual Gifts received, and so with Churches consent their Authority is
from Heaven, by which any of their Brethren so gifted, and according to their
Gifts, may do the same as well and as approvedly of God as they.

2. That there is nothing in these Offices, or given therein to these Officers
to do, Pet. 2.25. Mat. 20.26, 27, 28. Joh. 13.13, 14, 15. Act. 1.20.
but what was vertually in the Church before it chose them, and which she had
Authority from Christ, and Love in her Heart to lead her to do: for Christ
himself is the chief Bishop of our Souls; and when he was on Earth, he was as a
Servant, Deacon or Minister also, and did in that give us example: 1 Pet. 5.1.
2 Cor. 11.28. Act. 4.35. and 6.1, 2.
and so the Apostles by virtue of their commission, and the business they were
called to, were Bishops, and their Office a Bishopric; and by virtue of the
Grace and heavenly Gifts given them, they were Bishops or Elders, having the
care and oversight of all the Churches; yea, and they were Deacons or Ministers
also; yea, and those grown in Grace, and endued with spiritual Gifts, Heb.
11.2. Tit. 2.2. 1 Pet. 5.5. Phil. 2.4, 5. 1 These. 5.11, 14. Col. 4.17. Ephesians.
5.21. 1 These. 5.12. Col. 3.12. Jam. 3.17.
going as Fathers before others, are also Elders, and were to be sound in the
Faith, in Charity and Patience, sober, grave, temperate, as well as Elders by
Office, and to be submitted to by the younger also; yea, all the Brethren were
to oversee, and look to the things of one another, to exhort, comfort and
edify one another, to warn them that are unruly, to comfort the feeble minded,
support the weak; yea, even to admonish those that were Elders by Office, and
likewise to submit themselves one to another in the Fear of God, as well as to
those that were in outward Office; yea, to them all it belonged, to visit the
sick and releave the poor; yea, the Liberty for use of all the Ordinances of
God, belonged to the Church and holy Place; yea, where two or three of them, by
his Grace, in the belief and love of his Name, were met together, they have the
promise of Christ, Mat. 18.15, 20.
his own presence with them; they may preach, pray, receive in and baptize such
as freely offers themselves and theirs to them; and when need comples, cast
out. Nor do we read of any of these things limited to Officers of a Church
chose for doing them, or so as if the Believers cannot with safety have these
Officers, they should be deprived of use and enjoyment of any of these
Ordinances; yea, 1 Cor. 5.1, 5, 8. and 11.2, 23. and 14.29, 30, 40.11.34.
it is most probable the Corinthians wanted these outward Officers when Paul
wrote his first Epistle to them, yet had they all the Ordinances in use: yea,
this Liberty and power continues in the holy Place, when by the power of the
Gentiles getting into the outward Court, they are so kept down, Rev. 11.2, 3.
that they can choose no Officers in the place of the outward Court. So that the
choosing and setting such Officers in the Church, is not to give or make up the
being or true being of the Church, which was truly a Church in being before it
chose them, Act. 14.23.
and they were set in the Church, which was a Church in being before they were
set in it; neither do they give the Church the Liberty and power of using the
Ordinances of Christ: but the Church gives the power of officiating by Office
unto them, the original of that power remaining in her still. Nor are they
chosen to infringe the Liberties of the Church, or to free any of the Members
of the Church from any service of Love, Grace obliges them to; but to help
forward and promote the same: for all Believers are not alike, either filled
with Grace or Gifts, some of them weak: all have not like victory over their
passions, but some will be ready to vent disorderly: all that are faithful and
well gifted, cannot have that Freedom and Liberty to oversee all their
Brethren, to afford help according to all the needs of the Society, by reason
of their outward callings and employments in Domestic and
Commonwealth-Affairs, and the distance of their habitations and places of
employment; though as God by providence opens the door, and gives them ability
and opportunity, they moved with charity, do readily and diligently mind how
it is with their Brethrens Souls, and what their needs are for their Bodies;
and according to the proportion of Faith given them, Romans 12.3, 11. 1 Pet.
4.10, 11.
do teach, exhort, rebuke comfort, etc. and according to the ability given them
of God, minister to them for their relief: which still belongs to all Believers
to do, even when they have Officers also; yet cannot they give themselves
wholly to this Ministration, so to search the Scriptures, and attend the
Doctrine of the Gospel, and oversee the state of all their Brethren, and look
into their distresses, as need requires, and is to be desired. Wherefore, as
the Church or holy place has power, so she may choose of the Brethren to attend
to, and give themselves to this Ministration; which, when so set in Office,
Romans 12.7. Col. 4.17.
these Officers are to look to their Ministration, to fulfill it, and the
Brethren accordingly to attend and obey them in the Doctrine of the Gospel they
teach, 1 These. 5.12, 13. 1 Timothy 5.17, 18. Heb. 3.7, 17. Col. 4.17.
and submit to them in all lawful outward Order for Church Affairs, and as they
labor in the Word and Doctrine, to count them worthy double honor for their
Works sake, that so they may more cheerfully and fully perform their Ministry;
and to reprove and warn them, if they neglect their Ministration; so that these
Officers are for the help, commodity and service of the Church, and so not for
bondage but enlargement.

3. 1 Timothy 3.2, 3, 5, 8, 12. Tit. 1.7, 8, 9. Act. 6.3.
That the Men that are to be chosen into these Offices must be of their
Brethren, of the holy place, such as are known to be faithful and spiritually
gifted, holding the Mystery of Faith, even the faithful Word as it has been
taught from the Apostles, in a pure Conscience: That they be not
double-tongued, not self-willed, not soon angry, not covetous, not greedy of
filthy lucre, not given to Wine, no fighters or brawlers; but sound in the
Faith, and also, sober, vigilant, holy, temperate, and apt to teach; each Man
having but one Wife, and ruling well his own House; that they also be not
accused of Riot, etc. These, even such of the true Sanctuary, are by them of
the true Sanctuary to be chosen for this Ministration, that the Church may be
edified, well ordered and governed, as is at large shown in the Epistles to
Timothy, and to Titus.

4. That for the Officers to be chosen, and set in Office, they are of two
sorts, called by several Names: 1. Elders or Bishops: 2. Deacons.

1. The first is, Elder or Bishop; for both these signify one and the same
Office, as is beforesaid; and he is to be such a one, as aforesaid: as for his
skill in diverse Tongues, and Philosophy, and Liberal Sciences, and Arts, so
much extolled in the Wisdom of the Gentiles; or his Collegiate Education, in
the Worlds Universities, nothing is mentioned or required in that; but only,
that he be not a Novice, or one newly come to the Faith, that is, not
spiritually learned and established in the Faith, lest he fall into the
Condemnation of the Devil, not content with his place, to abide speaking
according to the proportion of the Faith dealt out to him, 1 Timothy 3.6. Jude 6.
Col. 2.18. 2 Pet. 3.16. 1 Pet. 5.1, 2, etc. 1 Timothy 3.1, 2, 3, 7. Tit. 1.6, 7,
8.9.
but puffed up with his Function and Office, or with that humane Learning (if he
have it) intrude into things he has not seen, and pervert the Scriptures to
maintain it, and Lord it over his Brethren. But that he be one that is found in
the Faith, and endued with spitual Gifts: in fore-exercise whereof, he is known
to hold fast the faithful Word, and to be apt to teach, and so also to be such
a one, as is foresaid: and his Office is especially to oversee and watch over
the Souls, 1 Timothy 3.15, 16. 2 Timothy 2.15 and 3.14, 17. Heb. 13.17. 1 Timothy 4.6 12.
and spiritual state of his Brethren, and so to divide in his Doctrine to every
one sutably, that they may grow in Faith and Love, and the Fruits thereof, as
one that is to give account of the same to God. In all which also, they are
with their Doctrine, in their Life to be a pattern and example to their
Brethren: and they also are to counsel, Act. 6.2, 7. and 8.12. 1 Cor. 1.14, 17.
1 Timothy 3.15. Tit. 1.9. Jam. 5.5, 14.
direct and help in the order of the Assemblies, and sometime also themselves
to baptize, and to order the times of Assemblings, and manner of proceedings in
the Assemblies; and to lead in the Administration of the Supper, and give
counsel in ordering distribution of Church-Almes, and to be sent for to pray
when any is sick.

And in respect of Church Officers, by an outward Ecclesiastical choice, Act.
15.4, 6. 1 Pet. 5.1. 2 Cor. 4.5. Heb. 13.7.
these may be said, to be the firstborn, of the strength of the Church, the
first chosen, the first that we read of by their Names: (yea, the Apostles were
also Elders:) and being such, and so demeaning themselves as the Servants of
the Church in their Ministration, as the Apostles and prime Christian Elders
did; They are blessedly useful and profitable, and meet to be highly esteemed,
submitted to and followed.

But if any of these, under the pretense of this Office, should assume to
themselves to be the only Pastors and Teachers, and so to be the Church, and
God's Clergy or Inheritance, the only Priests and Levites; and that none is to
presume to preach the Word, and to be Pastors and Teachers, but such as have
the Authority from them, and come into their Order: And that Believers must
understand the Word according to their Interpretation, and submit themselves to
their Injunctions and Traditions; and so Lord it over their Brethren, and
become Lords of their Faith, and Lords of their Gifts, so assuming the place or
bed of Christ himself: Then the Church may say of them, Genesis 49.3, 4.
as Jacob of his Son Reuben: Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the
beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of
power; unstable as water: thoushalt not excel, because thou wentest up to thy
Father's bed, etc. yea, this would come near to, and make way for that sin of
the Man of sin; 2 These. 2.4.
and so be the inlet and way-making for the outward Court to be left into the
hands of the Gentiles, Rev. 9.1, 2, 3. and 11.2. 2 Cor. 1.24. and 4.5, 12. and
10.18. and 11.2. 1 Pet. 5.3.
and to have the Holy City trodden under foot. Whence the Apostles abhorred all
such lording it over their Brethren, and so did all the prime Elders, and
warned following Elders to beware of the same: and when such an evil time
comes, the witnesses in the true Sanctuary, Rev. 11.1, 3, 4.
may go on in the strength of the Lord without measuring or fighting for the
outward Court, and letting it be where it is; and choose and take as ne^^ is
such of themselves, and in such manner, as they may safely and lawfully have,
and so prosper though in disgrace and persecution.

2 The second sort are called Deacons, Act. 6. and 7, and 8.5, 2. 1 Timothy 3.13.
Act. 13.15. and 15.4. 1 Cor. 1.14.
whose Office is especially to oversee the necessities of the poor, and exhort
their Brethren to a merciful relieving of them; and these to receive and
faithfully and wisely to dispense the benevolence of the Church. And these were
first ordained upon a necessity of the prime Elders, lest they who before had
done it, should by continuing that business, be hindered from attending the
Ministration of the Word and Prayer: and these Deacons were also to help the
Elders in Ministration, and to assist in preaching and baptizing, 1 Timothy 3.9,
10.
and also in breaking bread, as is seen in the Acts and Timothy; and these also
were to be sound in the Faith, and such as is aforesaid, yea, and proved and
approved to be such.

5. That for the choosing, order, and number of these Officers, it is to be
according to the fitness and necessities of the several Churches, and the
Liberty God-in his Providence gives them: the Church among the Corinthians,
among whom were many divisions, and many puffed up; for some against other were
exhorted, (to that which should be constant) even to order in their
proceedings, and to let such of them as had prophetical gifts, 1 Cor. 14.26,
29, 40.
have the precedence in leading; but not being fit, because of being puffed up
for one against another, etc. they were not yet permitted to choose their
outward Officers, that so all things might be so set in order till the Apostle
came and did that: Believers furnished with Apostolical, or Evangelistical
gifts at least, needful in such a case. But the Church among the Philippians, a
gracious, sweetly-framed people in their fellowship in the Gospel, they had
their Bishops and Deacons among themselves, and were well approved of. And the
Churches among the Ephesians, had also their Bishops and Deacons; but still
needed more and more helpfulness about them: and Timothy that was an Evangelist
by his Gifts, 2 Timothy 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1 Timothy 1.3, 8. and 3, and 4, and 5,
and 6.
and to do the work of an Evangelist in his preaching, was left as a Bishop or
Elder there, to oversee both the several Churches, and the Elders or Bishops
and Deacons in the several Churches, to charge some, that they teach no other
Doctrine beside that delivered them in the Gospel, and to silence and stop the
Mouths of perverse erroneous Ones by the Word, and to help them in choice of
Officers, Tit. 1, and 2, and 3.
and for the right ordering of all their Assemblies and Manners: and for the
same cause, was Titus left in Crete, both to ordain them Elders, and oversee
both them and the people, and give directions to them; yet were all these in
Corinth, Philippi, and Ephesus, and Crete, true Churches; and fought not one
with another about these outward Forms, it being in and to each according to
their firness and necessity.

Now while the immediate Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers
lived, and those mediate Ones that had heard and seen them; and that the
Officers were chosen by, and of those of the true Sanctuary, who were clothed
with the Righteousness of Christ, and gloried in the Doctrine of Christ
delivered by the twelve Apostles, and contemned the glory, Rev. 12.1, 2.
riches and pleasures of this World: and that the outward Court was in the
Hands of the Saints, and they the Ministers, and these the Officers therein
also; the Church appeared beautiful and glorious indeed. But in that time the
outward Court is left into the hands of the Gentiles, the true Sanctuary is
trodden down, and as one dwelling in a Wilderness, among Briars, Rev. 12.14.
and 11.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
and Thorns, and wild Beasts, and then clothed with Sackcloth; and yet
patiently bearing this, shall carry on their Work, with the rich, spiritual and
constant Furniture given, which is shown to be very good and great, though they
have not all their Privileges in the outward Court: and to encourage, I will
name one Help more.

6. Joh. 11.25. and 7.38, 39. and 14.16, 26. and 16.7, 15, 23, 26. Mat. 28.20.
and 7.7. Mar. 11.23, 24. Luke 1.7.6. Phil. 4.4.5, 7, 13.
To fit and furnish for, and in all the former Directions, and against all that
comes to oppose or hinder us, he has given us his gracious promise to be with
us; that believing on him, his strength and Spirit shall support, lead and go
forth with us, and whatever we find wanting, ask in his Name, and it shall be
done for and to us, that so we may be able to do all things through Christ that
strengthens us: so wonderfully are these chosen Ministers fitted for the
Ministration of the Gospel, according to the Revelation of the Mystery. And
thus much of the several Revelations, and so of this last Revelation of Christ.

CHAP. 17.
A Corollary from the Testimony of Christ in the three Branches, together with
all these several Revelations of Christ to the fullest.

FRom all that has been said in the second and third Part of this Treatise,
and the Scriptures alleged, and so in the whole Scripture-Testimony of Christ,
it appears,

I. That there is one Faith, and but one Faith, that is, Faith indeed, real and
true in its kind; and so not diverse kinds of Faith, each true in its kind.
The whole Testimony of Christ holds forth to us one, and but one kind of
Faith, that is, true Faith: yea, Ephesians. ^.5.
upon exhortation to keep the Unity of Spirit, this is given as the ground of
it, There is one Faith, as there is one God and Father, one Lord and Savior,
and one Spirit, and so one true Church in which he is: so there is one Faith,
and no more kinds of true Faith, then of Gods, etc. we may see this, in every
sense the word Faith is used in the Testimony; Romans 1.5. and 10.8. and 16.26.
Gal. 1.23. and 3.2. Romans 4.19, 24. Ephesians. 2.8. Act. 13.8. Romans 3.20, 30. and 4.5.
and 5.1.
the word Faith being used sometime for the object of Faith, and for the Word
or Gospel in which that object is set forth; and sometime for the Grace of
Faith, or believing in that object; and sometime for both the object and
believing; so as the Believer is united to it: and so still the Faith one, and
of one kind. For,

1. The object of Faith, is every way one and the same: the Gospel, that is the
discovering Medium, 2 Cor. n. 4. Gal. 1.7, 8, 9. Col. 1.5, 23.
the Word of Faith and of Grace, though it has many Branches and Uses, yet
they flow from, and meet in one; and there is but one and the same Gospel, and
not another: and Jesus Christ set forth, and as set forth in this Gospel, he is
one, and there is not another, though he be set forth as indeed he is, The Son
of God, and the Son of Man, God-Man; and what from Eternity he was, and what in
time he became; what he has done, and what he is thereby become, and what he
is furnished to do, 1 Cor. 8.6. Joh. 4.42. 2 Cor. 11.4. 1 Cor. 8.6. and 12.6.
Gal. 3.20. 1 Timothy 2.5. 1 Cor. 12.4, 11. 2 Cor. 11.4. 1 John 5.7. Mar 12.32, 34.
Joh. 10.29, 30. 1 John 5.10, 11.
and what he does and will do, as the mighty God, and the Son of Man, as the
Savior of all Men, especially of those that believe; and the Judge of all; yet
he is one, and but one Lord Jesus Christ; the Christ, the Savior of the World,
and there is not another Jesus that is the Christ: and so God the Father that
is in Christ, and dwells in him, though his works be manifold, yet he is but
one God, he is one: and so the Holy Spirit that proceeds from the Father and
the Son, and discovers Christ, and God in Christ, and bears forth the
Testimony, though his Gifts and Operations be manifold; yet the Spirit is one
in the same; yea, the Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit are one and the same
God; one in Essence, Will, Design, Testimony and Power, and God in Christ
propitious to Men: and having prepared Eternal Life in Christ for Men, this is
the Object of Faith to be preached and believed; and if this were not, there
could be no such thing as the Gospel calls Faith, to be preached, obeyed, or
enjoyed. And this is one.

2. The Grace of Faith, or that believing in the Gospel that is called Faith,
it is that believing which is begot in the heart by the Discovery and
Testimony, Heb. 11.13. Joh. 6.40. Act. 6.7. Rom 3.25. and 10.8, 9, 10.
the Spirit in the means he uses, has given of Christ; in which a Man
discerns the Truth and Goodness testified, is persuaded of it in his heart.
And this is one, one way and manner of believing that Object of Faith; and from
thence it is called Faith, and so truly still one Faith, the Object discovered
having drawn to it self a believing.

3. So when through the Operation of Grace believed, the Heart imbraceth the
Object believed, Heb. 11.13. Romans 10.10.
and so by Faith is united to it, in trust and well-pleasedness, etc. it is
still but one and the same Faith, the same Object uniting to it self: whence
indeed it has the name of Faith; so as still Faith is one, and but one.

II. That as Faith is used for the prevalency of the Object of Faith, drawing
the Hearer and Beholder to believe: and so for the Grace of Faith or Believing,
though the Faith be one, yet there are diverse Degrees in and of it, and diverse
Acts and Operarations of it.

1. One Degree of Believing (which in respect of the Testimony by which it is
begot, and which it believes, Joh. 2.23. and 12.42.
and which if abiden in it will unite to, may be called faith) is yet short of
a real new birth: it is such a belief of the Gospel-Testimony, as according to
light seen, one believes Jesus to be the Christ, so far as to count his saying
true; and yet not so overcome by that believed, to see and acknowledge his own
vileness, and the vanity of all his own best righteousness, and his sin in not
sooner believing by evidences foregiven, and so see not yet the fullness and
liberty in Christ for them, and so are not by the knowledge of the Truth made
single to Christ: they are sprinkled with water, and moved with Spirit, but not
yet born of Water and Spirit; they believe Righteousness, but not yet with the
heart unto Righteousness: they are by the hearing of Faith so far born of God
as to believe Jesus to be the Christ, and confess him to be the Lord; but not
so far born of God, as to be emptied of themselves, and united to Christ, and
so are not yet inwardly renewed and regenerated; and so though in the outward
Court, not yet really translated out of the Power of Darkness into the Kingdom
of God's dear Son: and yet even these Believers, if they abide in this Faith of
the Testimony of the Gospel, and give heed to the plain sayings thereof, Romans
10.9. Joh. 8.30, 31.
and abide therein, they shall be saved, shall know the Truth, and the Truth
will make them free. To say these did but pretend or seem and profess to
believe, and so are said to believe in respect of their seeming and prosession
to believe, in the judgment of Charity, is too much presumption, and
sawciness, and derogation from the Holy Ghost; for the Evangelists writ this
after Christ was ascended, and they endued with the Holy Ghost, and so writ by
his inspiration; so that those sayings such did believe, were not the sayings
of Men imperfect in knowledge, and judging according to the judgment of
Charity by conjecture; but the sayings of the Holy Ghost that knows all
things, the Spirit of Truth that cannot err or be deceived. And he says, they
believed on his Name, they believed on him: and who will be so proud of his
Wisdom and Knowledge, as to direct the Spirit of the Lord, and undertake to
counsel him, and teach him to speak more rightly and safely, and say, they
seemed to believe, they professed to believe; in the judgment of Charity they
ought to be counted Believers, though in the issue it appears they did not
believe? That which some bring to help this conceit, helps it not: Joh. 2.24,
25.
namely, that Christ did not commit himself to them, because he knew all Men,
etc. for it is not said Jesus knew they believed not, Genesis 6.5. and 8.21.
or that he knew there was no truth in their believing: but he knew what was in
Man, an evil and unfaithful disposition, etc. and he knew that his Words or
Miracles that brought these to believe on him, were not so submitted to, as
that their evil disposition was yet mortified, and they made faithful to him;
and so they might have served him as he did, Joh. 5.14, 15. but believe, the
Spirit says, they did. And so in the other place the Holy Ghost affirms,
That as Christ spoke, many believed on him: Joh. 8.30, 31.
and that our Savior then spoke to those Jews that believed on him. And again
the Holy Ghost faith, Among the chief Rulers many believed on him; Joh. 12.42.
but because of the Pharisees, they did not confess him. So that these were
Believers, and therefore so called: and not called Believers, because they
seemed or professed to believe, which the Holy Ghost says they did not; nay,
the praise of Men had that prevalency with them, that it kept them from
profession of believing, though it had not so great prevalency with these, as
with those Joh. 5.44. whom it kept from believing, or yet put them in an
incapacity of it: so that these pointed to, did believe, is evident; that it
was not a feigned but true believing, is evident; for else in continuance in
it, they could not be saved: that they were yet short of the knowledge of the
Truth, etc. is express: that if they continued in his words received by this
Faith, they were even then his Disciples, and they should know the Truth, and
the Truth should make them free, is express: so that here is one Degree of
Faith, yet short of a real New Birth; which yet abiden in, is certain to be
effected; and was after in many of these, as appears in comparing John 3.1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 18. and John 7.50, 51. with John 19.38, 39, 40.

2. The other Degree of believing, in which by the prevalency of the Light
seen, Col. 1, 12, 13. 1 Pet. 2.3, 5, 9. Phil. 3.7, 8, 9.
and Grace believed, the Heart is convinced and brought off all things, to
accept of, and confide in Jesus, and so brought out of the power of Darkness
into the Kingdom of his dear Son; and so by his Love believed, framed to love
him: and that this is true Faith indeed, none that I know, but the deniers of
Jesus to be the Christ, gainsay; yet is this but the farther Efficacies of the
same Object of Faith beheld, and so one and the same Faith still, though in
this degree united and made one with the Object, so as it was not in the former
Degree: yet even in this Degree also there are diverse Degrees, and so some
weak, Joh. 2.13, 14. 2 These. 1.1, 3. Romans 3.21, 22, 25, 26, 27. Act. 6.7. 2
Pet. 1.1.
some stronger, some stablish'd, some Babes, some young or strong Men, some
Fathers; yea, and in every of these Degrees, some may be more grown then
others, and be before others, yet all still in one and the same Faith, and
still also in this one Faith.

3. There be diverse Acts and Operations of this Faith, 1 These. 2.13. Act.
10.43. Gal. 2.3, 5. 2 Timothy 1.7. Joh. 7.38, 39. Gal. 5.22, 23. Gal. 5.6. Romans
10.10. Psalm. ^6.1, 10.
as to say, a receiving Act, in which is received the Word or Testimony, and
therein Remission of sins, Justification, Sanctification, Liberty of access to
God, the Spirit of Faith, Love, Power, and a sound Mind, a springing act,
raising up prizings of Christ, Love of God and Brethren, bowels of Mercy, etc.
a streaming Act, Faith working through Love, and so bringing forth the services
of Love, in Confession, Prayers, Praises, Works of Mercy and Righteousness; yet
the Faith it self is still one and the same, and so called the same, the same
Spirit of Faith; yea, when it produced Miracles, 2 Cor. 4.13. Act. 4.10, 11, 12.
the Faith was still the same, though the Act extraordinary. The belief of the
History, Romans 10.8, 9.
is the belief of the Testimony of Christ; which whosoever believes with his
heart, shall be saved; and when through the Grace believed, one is brought upon
Christ, he is justified from all sins past; and in that believing, receives
continual justification: Romans 3.25, 26, 27. Gal. 5.7. Mat. 24.13.
and if any depart from the Faith, that proves temporary; but he that endures
to the end, shall be eternally saved; the Faith it self being one still, and
but one Faith.

III. As Faith is used to express the Object of Faith, Heb. 1.1.
so it has been reyealed, for the full and clear Demonstration of it, at
diverse times, and by diverse parcels and degrees; and at last fully and clearly
by Jesus Christ; and yet that Object of Faith still one and the same, each
Revelation agreeing with, and opening the former, and so still one, as has
been shown in this whole third Part of the Treatise. And because there is no
Faith by the Holy Spirit called Faith, but that which by his Discovery of this
Object, is drawn toward it in believing, that the Believer might so be united
to it; Therefore the Faith is one; yea, and this Demonstration to lead us into
unity, because, as it unites Believers in one Foundation to one Head, so it
makes them of one Heart and Fellowship; Ephesians. 4.4.
For, there is one Body, (that is, one Mystical Body or Corporation, Fellowship
and Society, though the Members of this Corporation, and their Offices, be
many, yet) the Corporation and Society, in Faith, Love and Fellowship of their
Privileges, is one, and all bear one Name, 1 Cor. 12.12, 20. Ephesians. 2.19, 22. 1 John 1.3. Cant. 6.9. Gal. 3.16, 29. Hos. 11.1. Romans 8.17. Gal. 3.36. Ephesians. 4.4.
1 John 5.6. Joh. 15.26. Ephesians. 2.17, 18. 1 Cor. 12.13. 1 Cor. 2.16. Ephesians. 4.4. sa.
45.22. Joh. 3.14, 16. 2 These. 2.14. Ephesians. 1.18. Ephesians. 4.5. Romans 10.6, 15. 1 Pet.
1.20, 21. 2 These. 1.10. Joh. 1.12, 13. Ephesians. 4.5.
(the Name of Christ) being called Christians. And so there is but one true
Church and Sanctuary that is united to Christ, and shall be in and with him for
ever; and by virtue of their Union with Christ, they are all in respect of
kind, one Seed and one Son; though in respect of their several particular
Persons, Heirs, Children and Sons of God by Faith. And as there is One Body, so
there is in it,

One Spirit, even the Spirit of the Father and the Son, that bears forth the
Testimony of Christ, and enables to believe in Christ, and brings to God by
Christ, and into this Fellowship working the Mind of Christ, and so called the
Spirit of Faith, by whom all he calls, and so all Believers, are called in
One Hope of their calling, The same Grace proclaimed, The same looking and
believing required, and for the same end, To be saved, and to the same Hope in
believing, even the obtaining Eternal Life and Glory; and so One Lord, even the
Lord Jesus Christ, in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily; and so
One Faith; as one Object, so one Manner of believing, which is Faith indeed,
that is produced by the Holy Spirit, through the Gospel, and closes with
Christ the Object of Faith: and so also One Baptism, one kind and end of the
gracious Operation of the Holy Spirit in Baptizing into Christ, and through his
Name (by all the Mediums of baptizing, 1 Cor. 12.12, 13. Romans 6.3, 6. Gal.
3.26, 27, 28.
called also Baptisms) into conformity to Christ in his Death, that they may
partake of the virtue of his Resurrection, and so into the Fellowship of his
body, drinking into one Spirit, and so becoming of one mind, and that the
minne of Christ the Son of God, even as also there is, 1 Cor. 6.11. Phil. 2.1,
2, 5. Ephesians. 4.6. Ephesians. 1.3, 17. 1 Cor. 2.6. Mat. 10.40. Romans 16.20, 25, 26. 1
Pet. 5.10, ^. Psa. 138.8.


One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through al, and in them all,
(that are Believers) he is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in him, and
shmes forth his Glory through him, that Men might believe; and so in and
through him, he is the Father of all that believe in Christ; and above all,
able to overthrow all their Enemies and Opposers, and to perfect all that
concerns them all; so, as all flows from and leads into Union, and this Union
of the Spirit bringing into the Union of the acknowledgement of the Son of God,
is that which the Spirit teaches, and to which all the Degrees and Operations
tends: whence we are exhorted to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of
Peace: 2 Cor 114. Gal. 1.6, 7, 8.
and so but one Faith, which the Gospel calls Faith: and he that would find
out another Faith really true and holy in its kind, must first find out
another true Body, that is, the Church, another Spirit, another Jesus to be the
Christ, another Gospel, and another Hope to call to, and another God, all real,
true and holy in their kind: which is altogether impossible for any to do: so
that there can be but one Faith that is really true and holy in its kind.

IV. Romans 16.25, 26. Ephesians. 3.3, 9. 2 Cor. 3.12, 14.
That the fullest and cle^rest Revelation of the Mystery of Faith, is that
given immediately by Christ himself, and left upon Record by his Apost es and
Evangelists, and so the clearing up of all the former Revelations: and the
sense and meaning of the Prophets is most clearly and in plain Words to be
sound in their Writings; and so the Gospel as delivered by them, because of the
abundance and plainness of Truth, and fullness of spiritual Evidence in it, is
truly and indeed, and so called, Romans 1.16, 17.
The Power of God unto Salvation, to bring every one that believes, etc. for
therein is the Righteousness of God, (not any deceit, or fable, or pretense,
equivocation or falsehood but the Righteousness of God in his Words, saying, or
mises) revealed (not hinted in parabolical and cloking terms; but revealed,
opened, brought to light) from Faith to Faith, from one Revelation of Christ
the Object of Faith, to another, and so to another more clear; from assuring
him to come and suffer, to assure him to be already come, and to have suffered,
and to come again in Glory; from Faith in him, being so come; from believing in
him, through Types, Shadows and Prophecies, to believing in him now from a
clear Demonstration of his having completed Righteousness, and the Father's
face shining in him; and so now; and from believing this Testimony of him, to
confiding in him; and so from one Degree of Faith to another, till he come to
Vision; and yet all the way one Faith still: as it is the same strength
increasing in them, in which they are said to go from strength to strength,
till they appear in Sion: and so the Just shall live by Faith. Psalm. 84.7.
And here we have the fullest and plainest Revelation of it.

And so we are to heed all, and none but those Purposes, Promises and Covenant
of God, which are set forth in this Testimony and Revelation Christ.

An Explicit Declaration of the Testimony of Christ, etc.
PART IV.
CHAP. I.
Of the Purpose of God in general.

THE Eternal and Immutable Will of God, Psalm 33.11. Isa. 14 24, 26, 27. Eccles.
3.14.
or his Decree and Purpose concerning all that in his infinite Wisdom,
Sovereignty and Goodness he has freely purposed to do, has in his seasons
from the beginning, now does, and for ever shall take place and be done even so
as he has purposed; and no power of Creatures can or shall hinder the same;
yea, none can alter it, or add thereto, or take therefrom.

And it must needs be so, for he is of one Mind, Job 23.13, 14. Psalm. 119.90,
91. and 103.19 and 66.7. Deuteronomy. 29.29.
and none can turn him, and his Word is established for ever in Heaven, and his
Kingdom rules over all, and he rules by his power for ever, and all are his
Servants; yet of this his Will, Decree and Purpose, in respect of the
particulars, no more belongs to us to search into, then himself has revealed
to us, but what he has revealed by his Work, in which his Purposes are brought
forth; Ephesians. 1.11.
for he works all things according to the counsel of his own will: so that in
the event, as things are indeed done, we may so far know his Decree and
Purpose; Psalm. 39.9. and 118.23. and 126.
and so far to know the same, is of good use for us; and likewise what he has
revealed in his holy Word of his Decree and Purpose, concerning those things
that are already done, and those things that he will yet now and hereafter do:
which Word of his, is, as himself, true from the beginning; Psalm. 119 140, 160.
Prove. 8.6, 7, 8. Joh. 17.17 Pro. 22.20, 21. Ecclis. 12.10.
and being breathed forth by his Spirit, is the most clear declarer of his
Decree and Purposes, his Word being pure, and without any wreathedness; yea,
the Truth, and therefore written, that we might know the certainty of the Words
of Truth; and that which is written is upright, even Words of Truth.

And according to the discovery of the Decrees and Purposes of God in his holy
written Word, and by his Works, they are to be heeded and believed by us, as
true, certain and good, and of good usefulness to us, and other imaginations
and devices by whomsoever, Isa. 8.20.
and how appearingly goodly soever, we are not to heed, believe or own.

Now then the Purpose of God, (which in respect of the things purposed, are
called Purposes) that I am to treat of, are, Isa. 49.20. Job 27.12. Isa. 25. 1.
Psalm. 2.6. and 148.6. Job 14.5. and 26.10. and 28.26. Prove. 8.29. Jer. 5.22.
That or those about the Eternal Salvation or Damnation of Men; which by these
two, the Word and the Works of God, are revealed to us; which, though the Will
and Purpose of God be one, yet in respect of the things willed, purposed and
decreed, are called Many, and so Purposes: of which is here to be spoken, these
being all ordered and set in that one Will, Counsel, Purpose and Decree of his:
that we are to know and believe hereof, is that which by his Word and Works is
revealed to us, whether in terms of Counsel, Will, Purposes or Decrees, all
which terms signify the same thing; and so to begin with that which prepares
to the right understanding of all: and then so to proceed, as by Word and Works
we are led, we find,

1. Prove. 8.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 30.
That the Purpose of God was in the first place, To exalt his only begotten
Son, The Word, The Wisdom of God equal with God; to show forth his Glory
through him, and by him bring forth all his glorious Works; to glorify him
with his own self, to establish him the supreme Lord and Governor of all in
his own person: and all this freely, before any view or consideration of any
his following Works, as moving causes thereto. And this he did to his Son the
Word: Joh. 1.1, 2, 3. Col. 1.15, 16, 17. Heb 1.2, 3. Joh. 17.5. Phil. 2.6. Romans
11.36.
and so he was possessed in the beginning of his way, and exalted from
everlasting, and brought forth before all things, one with the Father in all
his Decrees, glorified with the Father's own self; and by, and for, and to him,
were all things decreed and made that are decreed and made.

Now in the Son of God, The Word, The Wisdom, The Power of God, in this
consideration, as thus purposed and exalted, it was peculiar to his Person, as
the Son of God only; and there was not in him the Nature of Man in this
consideration, nor any one of Mankind, elected or purposed to be elected in
him, into Union; and Fellowship, and Conformity with him in this Prerogative
and Glory, in which he was equal with the Father: no Scripture so says, yea,
all quoted, and the rest are against it.

2. In this Purpose of glorifying his Son, and showing forth his Glory through
him, he purposed also to do both in this; by creating by him, an infinite or
numberless company of Angels or heavenly Spirits, all holy and good, to attend
on, and minister to this his Son, Heb. 1.4, 6, 7. Psalm. 104.4.
and so to serve and glorify God in serving and glorifying his Son, whom only
he had exalted and glorified with equality to himself; and to endue them with
fitness and ability for this service, and to free them from any seducing
Tempter without them, Job 38.7. Psalm. 9.7. Luke 20.36
to turn them aside from it; and in their rejoicing in him, and acknowledge him
their supreme Lord, rejoicing in his Exaltation, and well-pleasedness with
their own place and service of him, to establish them by his Son, as his Sons
for ever. But if any of them contented not themselves with this their place and
service; Job 1.6. and 2.1. Jude 6. See Part 1. chap. 11.
but aspired to a likeness and equality with God, as was peculiar to his
first-begotten Son, then to cast them down for ever, and reserve them in chains
of darkness to the judgment of the great Day. All which, according to his
Purpose he has done.

3. In this Purpose of glorifying his Son, and showing forth his glory through
him, he also purposed to create by him, the Heaven and Earth, and a World of
Creatures for Mankind, and so to create Man righteous, etc. for his Glory, and
the good of Mankind, as has been shown.

4. See Part 1. chap. 9.
In foresight of Man's Fall and Misery, thereby he purposed still the shining
forth of his Glory through his Son, in working by him a Redemption and
Restoration for Mankind, and a New Creation for all that by his Glory shined
through, should believe on him, and that he should be the Judge of all, See
Part 1. chapter 12, and 13.
as has been foreshewn.

And of the Purpose of God as new last mentioned, and the Purposes included in
it, it is that comes within the compass of this Discourse, and of no other;
for, in consideration of this Purpose, and Purposes included in it, we shall
meet with all that is revealed for us to know, concerning the Purposes of God
about Eternal Salvation for Mankind, or the Eternal Damnation of any of them.
And yet before we proceed, it is needful to observe and mind well a few
Cautions, to prevent Mistakes.

CHAP. 2.
Of some Cautions to be heeded, to prevent Mistakes.

THat we distinguish between Foreknowledge, Caution I.
and Purpose or Decree. By Foreknowledge, I mean not foreowning or
pre-approbation; in which sense, the word is frequently used in Scripture: but,
knowing before, foreseeing, or prescience. In which sense, the word is commonly
used among ordinary people, and sometime some word also bearing that sense used
in Scripture; and such foreknowing I mean.

Nothing could have any being, life, strength, and ability of motion and action
for God to foresee, if God had not forepurposed, and did not according to his
purpose give and preserve the same.

but if it be meant of all the demeanor of those beings, and their various
movings and actings, in and with that power of acting and moving, which God
has given them; then this is not true. Doubtless God did foresee how Jerusalem
would abuse all that Life, Beauty, Ezekiel. 16.2, 27.
Riches and Ornaments he gave them: but he did not will, purpose or decree they
should so abuse them, though he purposed how to deal with them for it; yea, he
expressly sait, They did both choose such ways, and do such abominations, as he
not only not commanded them, Isa. 66.4. Jer. 19.5. and 32.35.
but as came not into his Mind; which can be no less then not purposed by him.
So surely God foresaw when he purposed to make the first Adam, and to give him
that life and power of moving and acting which he did, and that Furniture he
furnished him with, how he would abuse his power and Furniture, and sin against
God: but God never willed, purposed or moved him so to sin, Jam. 1.13.
much less approved he should so do; yea, according to his purppose he afforded
him sufficient means, by heeding which, he might have been preserved; And
farther, he would not withstand and hinder him: and so only permitted, but
decreed not his Fall; yet in foreseeing it, he purposed to show forth the Glory
of his Goodness more, in provision of a fit remedy for restoring of Mankind:
of which Purposes, we are to treat. And indeed, he said well, that said, God is
so good, that he would never suffer evil to be, if he knew not how to work good
out of it. So that Foresight is one thing, and Purpose another.

But then God foreseeing these miscarriages, did decree to permit the same;



That the Purposes of God we are to treat of, Caution II.
are his Purposes of Eternal Salvation, and of Eternal Damnation, and not of
such Purposes of God concerning Men, as being verily fulfilled, et even of
those persons on whom they are fulfilled, some may be Eternally saved, and some
may be Eternally damned: so as the fulfilling of such Purposes, neither
necessitates the persons on whom they are fulfiled to be Eternally saved, nor
to be Eternally damned, they being fulfilled, both on the righteous, and the
wicked: as for some instance,

1. As God has made of one Blood all Nations of Men for to dwell on all the
face of the Earth; so did he also purpose, and in his Purpose, determined the
times before appointed, and the bounds of their Habitation; Act. 17.26, 27.
and this with a gracious end and tendency; for their good also in his way; yet
in this Purpose, only those, and all those, in all times, ages and Nations of
the World that fear him, should be accepted of him; Act. 10.35.
so that, though purposed, and according to purpose, some be Kings and
Magistrates, some Subjects, some Rich, some Poor; and all in a gracious
tendency, that they might seek and acknowledge the Lord in these condition, and
some of all sorts have been found in every of these conditions, seeking and
fearing God, and so walking on to Eternal Salvation: Romans 3.10.20. and 1.18, 28.
but also some of all sorts, if not most of all sorts, persisting in rebe^lious
ways leading to Eternal destruction: Scripture and Men's manners so fully show
this, that it needs no farther proof.

2. As God in his Works has put, so in his Purpose he decreed to put a great
difference between some Nations and other Nations, as one to be greater and
endued with more Pri^iledges then the other; yea, sometime the lesser people or
younger, to be the chief; and the greater or elder people, to serve the
younger: and yet neither does this Purpose, or the fulfilling of it,
necessitate or imply the Eternal Damnation, or hindering the Eternal Salvation
of the inferior appointed to serve, Deuteronomy. 7 6 7. and 14 2. Psalm. 147. 19.20.
Romans 9.6, 27. Act. 10.35.
or of the Superior to be served. So Israel a peculiar people above all other
Nation, though fewest in number, yet were not all this Israel the Israel of God
indeed, in acceptance of and answering their Pri^iledges, and so not every of
them eternally saved; nor were all and every of the other Nations Eternally
damned: that Rule true, according to his Purpose, Romans 2.6, 11, 25, 26. and
3.9. but this is most clear in those two people mentioned, Genesis 25.23. And the
Lord said unto her, (that is Rebecca) Two Nations are in thy Womb, and two
manner of People shall be separated from thy Bowels; and the one People shall
be stronger then the other, and the elder shall serve the younger; or, Romans
9.11.
(as some read it) The greater shall serve the lesser. Now Christ being to come
of Jacob; Esau, or any of his Posterity, in serving Christ that was to come of
Jacob, and so in a willing service of their Brethren the Sons of Jacob,
attending the Word and Oracles given them, might through Grace be saved, as no
doubt some of them were; Deuteronomy. 23.7, 8.
and means was by God appointed thereto. And whereas many for their wilful
refusal and violence (though constrained, did yet in another way serve, Obad.
9, 10, 21. Amos 9.12. with Jer. 49.7, 11. Job 2.11. Psalm. 87.4, 5. and 60.8.
yet for that refusal and violence) did perish; yet of that Race, it is found
in Scripture, many are eternally saved, Isa. 60.7-14. And as God in. his
Purpose differenced one Nation from another in superiority and inferiority; so
he purposed diverse means for diverse Ages in the World, and to diverse People,
and some means excelling other: to some People, the Word, Oracles, Gospel, etc.
to other People, only a rumor of these, with such teachings as are natural,
or by natural Mediums, in the Works of Creation and Providence; yet the
Repentance (and so the Faith and Obedience) he requires, being no more or
greater then according to the means he vouchsafes, and that such will be
accepted; and where more is given, more is required.

This Purpose of such difference, and the fulfilling it in extention of such
different means, hinders not, but that, Romans 2.3, 4, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17,
26, 27.
of those that have but the lesser means, yielding to repent, believe, and
obey, according to the help therein afforded, shall be Eternally saved: and
those that have the greater means, rebelling against the help therein afforded,
and so persisting in Impenitency, Unbelief and Rebellion, shall be Eternally
damned. Let this Caution be heeded.

God has purposed some things that he will bring on all Men, both those that
shall be Eternally saved, Caution III.
and on those that shall be Eternally damned; as namely, That,

1. Isa. 45.23. Romans 14.11, 12. Joh. 12.32. Phil. 2.9, 10, 11.
All Men, one and other, shall come before him and his Son Christ; and he by
virtue of his great suffering and Sacrifice offered for Mankind, and the
Power, Authority and Spirit received thereby shall draw all Men to him, and
they shall come and bow before Jesus, and confess him Lord to the Glory of God:
yet only those that by his goodness discovered, and bands of love extended,
are prevailed with in this Day of Grace, Romans 10.9, 10. Isa. 45.24. Joh. 6.37,
40.
and so found coming to him, and believing on him here with the Heart unto
Righteousness, and confessing him with the Mouth unto Salvation: these shall
say, Surely in the Lord have I Righteousness, and shall be Eternally saved. All
shall come to him; but him that comes (now in the Father's drawing) he will
Eternally save; and all that rebel against these drawings, and persist so
doing, shall yet by his irresistible Power be raised from the dead, Joh. 6.37.
and 16.8, 9. Isa. 45.24. Phil. 2.10, 11.
and convinced of their sin, for not believing on him in the Day of Grace: and
then to their shame, and his Glory, confess him Lord, to the Glory of God,
before the sentence pass on them.

2. Heb. 9.27. Heb. 11.13. 1 These. 4.14. Rev. 14.13. John 8.24. Eccles. 11.
All Men shall once die, or suffer a change suitable to Death, which is the way
of all Flesh; yet of these, some die in the Faith, and so sleep in the Lord;
and these shall be Eternally saved: but others die in their sins and unbelief;
and these shall be Eternally damned.

3. All Men shall also rise again by the Power and Authority of Jesus Christ at
his voice; 1 Cor. 15.21, 22. Joh. 5.28, 29. Luke 14, 14. Act. 24.15.
but the Just, such as have believed in Christ, and done good, shall rise in
the Resurrection of the Just unto Eternal life; and the impenitent and
unbelieving, in the Resurection of the unjust, unto Eternal condemnation.

4. 2 Cor. 5.10. Romans 2.16. Mal. 25.34, 46. Rev. 20.13, 15.
After Death, all being raised, they shall all come before the Judgment Seat
of Christ, and be judged by him according to the Gospel; and then all those
that have believed in him, and lived to him in the Day of Grace, shall enjoy
Absolution, Eternal Life and Joy with him: and all that have throughout the
Days of his Grace and Patience rebelled against him, shall then be cast into
the Lake of Fire, which is the second Death. Let this Caution be also heeded.

For of all Purposes, as set forth in these three former Cautions, is not in
this business directly, but only inclusively to be spoken.

God has set in his Counsel, Caution IV. Psalm. 145.8.9. 1 Timothy 1.17. Joh.
12.13. Jer. 32.18, 19, 20. Isa. 25.1. and 40.14. Prove 22.20, 21. Act. 20.27.
Psa. 33.11. Ephesians. 1.11.
and Purposes concerning the Eternal salvation of Mankind, or the Damnation of
any of them, an holy, wise, and heavenly Order, agreeing with the Nature and
Being of God, his Sovereignty, Wisdom, Holiness, Love, Mercy, Truth, Justice,
and the Testimony of his Spirit concerning his Son Jesus Christ, and his Love
to Mankind manifest through him: all agreeing in one, without any contrarying
of one by another. Hence his Purposes called his Counsel, and said to be
brought forth according to the Counsel of his own Will: and so in respect of
this wise and heavenly Order in his Counsel, for the manner and way of his
Purpose taking effect, we shall find different effects, and different sorts of
Men also, on whom it has different effects; that is to say,

First, for the manner and way of his Purpose taking effect on Men for their
good; it is by discovery of his Love to Mankind, to sinners, enemies, in
discovering his Grace in and through his Son that died for sinners; Isa. 45.21,
22. and 55.1, 4, 6.
and in that Discovery, in some measure opening their blind eyes or
understanding, to see or understand his graciousness: and so calling and moving
them to behold what he discovers, and hear what he says; assuring them, that
in beholding him as discovered, and as understanding is given them to discern,
Joh. 25.3. Prove. 1.22, 23. Joh. 1.9. and 5.25.34.
and so attending him, he will save them, and so bring them in to believe, and
so out of darkness into his mavelous light: and this the first proceed for
his Purpose to take place; for saving Men out of their sinfulness, and
according to his Purpose he proceeds so far with all Men in some measure, at
one season or other.

Secondly, When he has so far proceeded with Men in discovery of his
graciousness through Christ, and so far opened their eyes or understanding,
that they begin to discern, and he calls or moves them to behold and turn; then
such as in hearing do hear, and in seeing do see; and in that motion and
strength of his extended in this call, do according as by that enabled, turn
and believe, he will save, enlive, renew, and change, Isa. 45.22. Joh. 5.25. 2
Cor. 3.18. Romans 5.8, 10. 1 Pet. 2.6, 7. Phil. 3.7, 8. Psa. 73.23, 24, 25. Col.
3.11. 2 These. 2.13, 14. 1 Pet. 1, 2. Ephesians. 1.11. Romans 9.11.
and farther enlighten and confirm in Faith and Confidence, and so enamour them
more with Christ, and he shall appear and become more precious to their Hearts,
so as for the well-pleasedness they find in him, they count all things loss
for Christ, and are willing to be deprived of them to win him, he being all in
all to them. And through the Grace thus believed, and the Sanctification of the
Spirit, he chooses them into Union and Fellowship with Christ, and so to
Conformity to him, and to Eternal Salvation: this being the Order of his work,
who works all things according to the Counsel of his own will; we may be sure
such was his Counsel for the manner of his purpose taking effect, or standing
according to the Election of Grace.

But such, Joh. 3.19, 20, 21 1 Pet. 2.7, 8. Mat. 13.11, 15. Act. 28.26, 27.
Luke 2.34. Isa. 8.14.
as when this light comes, and Grace therein extended, so as light and hearing
is given, and heart moved, do not then in hearing hear, and in seeing see; but
take offense because of some discovery of evil, and reproof and condemnation of
something by them highly esteemed and dearly beloved; which reproof this Light
and Grace works in its convincements: and so do hard en their hearts, close
their eyes, shun the light, love darkness rather, being unperswadeable, and so
willingly disobedient, and refuse to turn at his reproof; these he gives up to
blindness and hardness; so, as the more brightly the gracious mind of God in
Christ is discovered, the more such stumble and take offense; of which we have
a notable example, Joh. 6.27, 28, 60, 66. Romans 11.23 Jer. 6.16, 17, 30. Ezekiel.
24.13, 14. Prove. 1.24, 32. Romans 1.21.23, 28. 1 Pet. 2, 7, 8.
John 6. And this being the manner of God's working; yea, so as if by his
chastisements for such follies, and his renewed strifes, they are not humbled
to return, but persist in their former willing rebellion, he reprobateth them
to Eternal Damnation; we may be sure such was his Counsel in the Order of his
Purpose: and so we see two diverse and contrary effects of the Purpose made
known.

Thirdly, For the different sorts of Men under different considerations, that
were according to this wise and holy order, in the Counsel of God's will, the
objects on whom the several effects of his purpose made known should take
place, they appear to be the Sons of Adam; he, and his natural Race diversely
considered, and not in one and the same consideration, but in respect of the
diversity of effects, diversely considered, either simply as such, or else
though such, yet under another consideration; and that either, as better then
such simply considered, or as worse then such only.

1. For his Purpose of finding out a ransom, making an Atonement, preparing a
Sacrifice, and accepting it, so as to remove the enmity that was in the
midway, 1 Timothy 2.6. 2 Cor. 5.14. Romans 5.6, 8. 1 Pet. 3.18. Isa. 53.5, 6. 1
Cor. 15.3. Gal. 1.4.
and opening a door for Mankind to come in to him, the objects or subjects of
this Purpose, and those for whom it is efficacious with God; so as he has
given all into the dispose of the Sacrificer, are Adam, and all his natural
Race, as fallen, as sinners, ungodly, enemies to God, simply as such, and in no
better or worse consideration: but as such, men, all men, sinful, unjust, and
ungodly men. And so for our sins he suffered,

2. For his purpose of discovery and making known his Grace and Goodness
through Christ in and by means extended, and the efficacy thereof, for opening
the eyes of the blind, and the ears of the deaf, and moving at their hearts,
and so calling them and striving with them, affording such help to them, that
they might turn at his reproof, and so believe and live. The objects or
subjects of this purpose, and those on whom these effects so far shall be
produced, are Adam and all his natural Race, even all Mankind, as in sin,
ignorance and bondage, etc. yet these in some better consideration, then merely
as Adam's sons, and fallen in him, under the power of the Law, and Sin, and
Death, and the Devil, namely, considered, as a Ransom is given, 1 Timothy 2.6, 7.
Psa. 68.18. Isa. 42.1, 2, 7, 8. and 61.1, 2, 3. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15, 19, 20, 21. 1 Timothy 1.15.
a Sacrifice offered, Peace made, and Redemption wrought for them, though not
yet applied to them, nor they knowing or enjoying any of the choice benefits
thereof; for Jesus Christ by virtue of his Oblation being ascended, has
received Spirit in the Man and for Men, with Power and Authority to preach the
Gospel, and extend Gifts even to the Rebellious, Psa. 96.28. Romans 5.18. Joh.
6.51. Eccles. 9.4.
that the Lord God might dwell among them. And on this ground they are called:
and in this respect also they are said, To be written in the Book of Life,
though not yet written among the Righteous. And while they remain such, and no
worse then such, there is yet hope for them.

3. For his Purpose of Election to Union and Fellowship with his Son Christ,
and so to conformity in holiness, Son-like Privileges and Eternal Life, the
Objects or Subjects of this Purpose are still in this Life, and till Death, the
Sons of Adam and his natural Race; Isa. 28.16. 1 Pet. 2.3, 4, 5, 6, 9. Joh.
3.16.
but they are not only so, but much better; not only in respect of a ransom
given and made known, but alalso in respect of a new Birth begun in them; they
being such, and so beheld and considered, as those that through the efficacy of
Grace discovered; and opening their eyes, are in beholding him, drawn
unfeignedly to believe in him, in which, being spiritually in him, they are by
the Election of Grace, rooted in, united more to Christ, and so chosen and
owned in Christ, and conformed in some measure to him, and have the beginnings
of Eternal Life.

4. For his Purpose of blotting out of the Book of Life, and not writing among
the Righteous, but reprobating and giving up to Satan, and so to Eternal
Damnation, the objects or subjects of this Purpose, and those on whom its
efficacy shall take place, are also of the natural Race of Adam, and such also
as were bought by Christ into his dispose: but not only or simply such, but a
great deal worse then as coming from Adam, and fallen in him, Mat. 13.13. Psa.
81.11. Prove. 1.24, 31. Joh. 3.20. Job 24.13, 24. Mat. 13.13, 14, 15. Act.
28.27. 2 Cor. 36.15, 16.
by reason of their wilful contumely against him that bought them, being such,
and those, and so beheld, as will not see when their eyes are opened; will none
of Christ, when and as offered; will not turn at his reproof, though he call
and stretch out his hand to help them; hate, and rebel against the light, close
their eyes, and stop their ears, and harden their hearts, when he has opened
and moved, and wilfully persist so doing against means, light and warnings,
till there be no remedy: These (and none but such, Rev. 3.5. Romans 11.23.) are
the subjects of this Purpose, and those on whom it will take place, Psalm.
69.21, 28. and 109.1, 8. Act. 1.16, 20. Exodus 32.32, 33. Rev. 22.19. Jude 4.

So that though the Sons of Adam as fallen, be the very objects or subjects of
the Purpose of God, for whom he gave his Son to become Man, and so to die, and
rise, and offer Sacrifice; and by virtue thereof through him to extend means,
and light in the means, that they might turn at his reproof; and in turning,
believe; and in believing, not perish, but have Everlasting Life: yet his
Purposes of choosing in Christ, and conferring Everlasting Life, and of
reprobating to eternal destruction, any of the Sons of Adam fallen, was not as
they were simply so considered, either as fallen only, or only as they were
also bought, and means extended to them; but in another consideration, as they
were beheld and found to become of another seed, either of the Woman, Romans 9.8.
Gal. 3.16, 29. 1 Pet. 2.9.
of Abraham, of Christ through belief and receipt of Grace, which all and none
but the Children of the promise are, they the elect; or by rebelling against
Light and Grace, become of the Seed of the Serpent, of the wicked one, 1 John
3.10, 12. Joh. 8.44.
which none are but those that wilfully against light and warning, do and will
do his will.

And between these two Seeds, God has put enmity, so as the one is an a
bomination to the other; yea, Genesis 3.15. Pro. 29.27. Jude 3, 4.
this Seed of the Serpent were forewritten of old at the beginning, and so
foreordained to this contention, condemnation or judgment, to be the triers
and troublers of the Saints, and receive judgment accordingly; against whose
wickedness the Saints are to contend, and for the Faith.

These Cautions minded according as given us in the Scripture, we shall find,
that all the Purposes of God agree with the whole Testimony of Christ in the
Gospel concerning his Oblation, Intercession, and coming again, and all the
Covenants of God, and all his Promises, and all his Threatenings; none clashing
or jarring with other, but all agreeing in one: and though there be not first
and last, and one thing after another in God's Counsels, Foreknowledge or
Purpose; yet, as in the counsel in his Purpose, he has preferred something
before other, and ordered one thing for another, and appointed to bring forth
something before another, as the natural Man before the spiritual; so to our
thoughts and conception, and in being for our knowledge and use, there is
something before, and something after another, according to God's order, for us
to observe. And thus understood, I will now proceed to view these Purposes.

CHAP. 3.
Of the Purposes of God concerning the second public Man, Jesus Christ the
Redeemer.

AS in all other the Counsels and Works of God, The Word, the Person of the Son
of God, Prove. 8.22. Col. 1.17, 18.
is in his Purpose to have the pre-eminence; so, in this he is the prime and
first in this high Purpose of God, even concerning Mankind fallen: and so
concerning him,

1. His Will and Purpose was, That he should do his Will in taking away
transgressions, and destroying the works of the Devil; and for that cause to
give him a Body, that having the Nature of Man, he might be a perfect Man, and
so Emmanuel, God with us, in our Nature for us, even he; for there was no other
with or in him, to lay aside such Glory, or to descend and to be made flesh in
a supernatural way, See Part 1. chapter 13.
none in and with him that might join with him in this business; This was
peculiar to him, and him only, and none with him. This is express and plain in
the Testimony of Christ himself, by his Spirit both in the Prophets and
Apostles, Psalm. 40.7, 8. Heb. 10.7. Deuteronomy. 18.15, 18, 19. Act. 3.22, 23, 24. and
7.37. Joh. 5.39, 46. Romans 1.2, 3, 4, 5. and 16.25, 26. 1 John 3.5, 8.
In the volume of the book (or role) it is written of me, that I should do thy
will. Which as it is written in the Role or Book of the Scriptures that
testify of Christ; yea, even in Genesis 3.15. though not in so clear a Revelation
of the mystery, as after he had offered up the acceptable Sacrifice: so there
is nothing written therein of him, but what was in the Bosom, Will and Counsel
of God before, as appears in comparing Heb. 10.7. with Psalm. 40.7 8. where
only the same saying is plainly written, and that also in the same words, In
the volume of the book it is written, etc. which seems to carry us farther then
any Prophets forewritten, even including the Book of his Counsels and Purposes;
1 Pet. 1.20.
according to that of Peter's saying of Christ, Who was verily ordained before
the foundation of the world. And so it follows, Psalm. 40.8. I delight to do thy
will, O my God; yea, thy Law is in the midst of my bowels. Which shows
plainly, both that he was one with the Father in this, Prove. 8.29, 30, 31
as in all other his Decrees and Purposes; and also, that he did accept to
undertake, and do the same, as his own words verify, Psalm. 40.7. Lo I come:
rendered by the Apostle, Heb. 10.7, 8, 9
Heb. 10.7. Lo I come to do thy will, O God: and then opened, descanted and
pressed again. From which Will of God, of the Father, and Christ his oneness in
the same, the virtue of his Sacrifice is affirmed to be, Heb. 10.10, 12, 14
and to have been from the beginning, virtuous and prevalent with God for Men;
and with and in all that believe in him. And as in order to the performance of
this his Will, concerning, and for, Mankind, he in his Purpose, prepared and
gave him a Body, so as he might be truly and verily man, and the Son of Man,
and so capable of suffering for Man, having right as a Kinsman, and fitness as
having the Nature of Man, to undertake and do the whole business of Mankind,
Romans 5.14, 18
being according to this his Father's Purpose, a perfect and public Man; yea,
the Word and Son of God made Man; and so having the Divine and the Humane
Nature in one Person; and so one with the Father, and one with Man: a fit
Mediator between God and Man, to deal with God for Man, and with Man in the
behalf of God; and so the digging or opening of the Ear, Joh 33.16, 17, 24
(as it signifies in Men the fitting and preparing for obedience to that which
God calls to, that they may obey; so in respect of Christ) it signifies the
giving him, and fitting him with such a Body as in which he might have capacity
and fitness to suffer and do his Will; which being given him, Isa. 50.5, 6 Psa.
40.6, 7
he was not rebellious, nor did draw back; but being one with his Father in his
will and love to Man, he accepted, and delighted to do the same: and so the
Spirit by the Apostle teaches us to understand it; who knowing that to be the
meaning, cites that very Text according to the Translation then extant and
known, A body have thou fitted (or prepared) me. Heb. 10.5
And that he might do his Will in that very Body, he in this Purpose,

2. Purposed concerning the Man Christ, the second public Man, first, an
Abasement of him: secondly, by virtue thereof, an Exaltation.

1. He purposed and decreed an Abasement of him for Mankind, Gal. 4.4
as that he should be made under the Law for Men; and though without sin, yet
to have on him all the infirmities of the Nature of Man, Romans 8.3
which befell it for sin merely through the Fall; and so though true and sinless
flesh, yet in the similitude of finful flesh: 2 Cor. 5.14, 15 2 Timothy 2.6 Heb.
2.9 Ephesians. 2.13 Heb. 9.14 and 7.27 See Part 2. chapter 7. Luke 24.26, 46 Mat. 26.24
Isa. 53.2, 7 Psa. 22.6, 11, 18 Act. 2.23.
and so that he in the stead of, and for all Mankind should die that death;
yea, all that death in the ignominy and pain of it; yea, suffer the Curse in
it, which was due to Mankind for the first offense, and all the sins that
necessarily flow from it, and which the Law on that account can charge Men
with, and also make such full satisfaction, and such a virtuous Atonement by
his Blood, as by it even following sins against himself, might in his way be
taken away and freely forgiven. All which he has done, as was fore-purposed
and fore-written of him: and because of the certainty of God's Purpose, and his
being one with God in that Decree, having accepted to do it, it is spoken of
before the actual and visible performance, as done; and when manifestly
performed, he is said truly to go as it is written of him, and to be delivered
thus to suffer by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God: so his
Abasement was according to Purpose.

2. Psa. 16.10, 11 Isa. 5.3.8 Act. 2.25, 33 and 13.29, 33, 37 Psa. 68.18 and
47.5 Luke 24.52 Heb. 10.12, 13 and 8.1 1 Pet. 3.22 Col. 2.9, 10 Joh. 17.5 Psalm.
20.3, 4 and 110.1
He purposed and decreed the Exaltation of him in that personal Body, in which
he was so willingly abased; and this Exaltation to be in his Resurrection, and
in his Ascension into Heaven, and in the acceptance of his Sacrifice for all
that for which he offered it; and so filling him with the immeasurable fullness
of the Spirit, even glorifying him with his own self; so that the fullness of
the Godhead dwells in him bodily, and he set at the right Hand of God in all
Power and Authority; Angels, Authorities and Powers being made subject to him:
and all this now done, as was fore-purposed.

3. God in Approbation of all this his own Purpose, and of his Son becoming the
Son of Man, and suffering and doing all this for Mankind, and in his own
well-pleasedness in his Son in Man's Nature thus exalted, the heavenly, and
spiritual Man, the Lord, the quickening Spirit; He in this Purpose did also
purpose to elect and choose, and so did and has elected and chosen him to be,
and so made him his Servant or Minister, by whom he will do all his choice
works of saving and judging; yea, Isa. 42.1 Mat. 12.18 and 3.17 and 17.3 Psa.
89.19, 20.28
his delight in whom he takes his rest and well-pleasedness for ever; yea, the
very he in whom and through whom, he will show forth the brightness and
excellency of his Glory, and with whom his Covenant stands fast for evermore.
And so in this Purpose and choice of his, and by the virtue of his sufferings
and Sacrifice, and by reason of, and in, and with al^^^^hs Furniture, he has
fitted and made him to be: and so,

4. He has purposed, and according to Purpose confirmed him to be,

1. The Lord of all, even of the Devils and fallen Angels, as his Captives and
Slaves, Act. 2.36 and 10.36 Mat. 4.3, 11 Heb. 2.14 Col. 2.25 Ephesians. 4.8 Heb. 1.3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14 Romans 14.7, 8, 9 1 Cor. 6.20 2 Cor. 5.14, 15 Romans 2.16 2 Pet.
2.1 John 3.16
by virtue of his Conquest and Victory over them, in the Nature of Man, whom
they had overthrown, and by conquering death, which they brought Man under;
yea, by reason of the transcendent excellency of his Person, and his Work and
Office, even Lord of the holy Angels also, but Lord over all Mankind by virtue
of his Death suffered, and his Resurrection, and his Sacrifice offered for
them: so, as they are all released over to him, who in his time will bring them
out of that Death he died for them, and shall judge them, for they are his, and
ought of right to live to him; which, if according to the Grace he extends to
them, they do, they shall not perish in another death, but have everlasting
life.

2. The Mediator between God and Men, 1 Timothy 2.5. Isa. 43.1, 8 and 55.4, 5 and
61.1, 2, 3 1 John 2.1 Heb. 7.25 and 9.15, 19
the chief and Prime Caller of Men, to come to God by him, and the special
Advocate and Intercessor for all that come to God by him, and so the chief
Priest, Prophet and King, Heb. 5, and 7, and 8, and 9, and 10.

3. That by the means he uses, Joh. 3.17 1 Timothy 1.15 Isa. 53.10, 11 and 55.5
Joh. 12.26 and 17 24 Psa. 68.18, 19, 20, 24 Romans 2.16
and Spirit he sends forth, as it is in earnest to all, and has a
sufficiency in it, that they might be saved, so he shall see his Seed: many
shall thereby run in to him, and so come to God by him, and shall be blessed in
him, and inherit with him, and they that persist in willing rebelling against
him, when by the means he uses they might come in to him, and will not, he
shall judge also justly.

4. That he shall have the Kingdom in the new Heaven and new Earth, 1 Chronicles.
17.9, 14 Psa. 2.6, 9 and 72 Dan 7.13, 14, 27 Luke 1.32, 33
and shall sit on the Throne of David reigning in Jerusalem, and over all the
Nations under the whole Heaven; and all his Seed, even all that have believed
on him and lived to him in the days of his Grace and Patience, shall then have
the Kingdom, and reign with him, and all his Enemies shall be destroyed.

5. Isa. 52.13, 14, 15 and 53.10, 11, 12
That to bring all this about, in making it known, and extending Divine Power
in gi^^^g forth his Knowledge, to bring Men in to Christ, and so to God by him,
that they might not perish, but become his Seed, and have Eternal Life: and so
he may see his Seed, Isa. 45.23, 24 Phil. 2.10, 11 Joh. 12.32.
and of the travel of his Soul, and be glorified and satisfied according to
that promised him, and is daily fufilling, and will be openly and manifestly to
all, when all shall come before him, and confess him Lord to the glory of God:
Mat. 25.31, 46 2 These. 1.8, 9, 10
and he gives the Kingdom to all those that believed on him in the Day of
Grace, whom by his Knowledge he justified, and then shall be admired in them;
and be glorified also in his equitable and righteous judgment on them, that in
the Day of Grace refused to believe on him by the means he used; and so shall
see the travel of his Soul, and the excellency and acceptableness of his
sufferings and Sacrifice with God in both, Isa. 45.22 Ezekiel 33.11 Prove. 9.12
to the Glory of God; his Will and Pleasure all the days of his Patience,
being, that by the means he uses Men should turn to him, and live; yea, rather
rest, that though he will have his Glory on the scorners, and not suffer loss
to himself; and that all this may be by this Knowledge of him, and his Divine
Power therein, and so he have a numerous Seed, and Refusers be altogether
excuseless; He in his Purpose and choice of the Man Christ, did therein also
purpose and choose him; Exodus 23.21 with 1 Cor. 10.9 Heb. 1.3 Isa. 55.4, 5. 1
Pet. 1.21 Joh. 14, 15, 16, 17
and according to his purpose has put his Name in and upon him, to declare and
make it known in, by and through him, and for that cause to make him known, to
cause him to be lifted up and displayed, and in that discovery of him to
glorify him, that Men might behold him; and in beholding, believe in him, and
so come in to him, and to God by him, and so be of his Seed, and have Eternal
Life: and for understanding this, we may briefly view three things in this.

1. Exodus 6.2, 3, 4
What the Name of God is: and that by his own Declaration, appears to be
himself, and his memorial, Rev. 1.4 Act. 17.24, 25 Psa. 105.8, 9, 10 Exodus 3.6,
14, 15 Exodus 34.6 Psa. 145.8, 9 Exodus 34.7 Joh 21.14, 17 Psalm. 81.11, 12 Mat.
24.37, 38 Pro. 1.24 Ezekiel. 24.13 Joh. 5.40 Deuteronomy. 5.9 Psalm. 109.2, 3, 4 Ezekiel
18.2, 20, 31, 32 Prove. 8.30 Psa. 89.8 Genesis 17.1 Psalm. 66.7 Isa. 45.21, 22 Psalm.
9.9, 10 Jer. 9.24
or the appearance of him in his Titles, Word, Works; and so he is Jehovah (he
that is, that was, that is to come, that has his being of himself, and gives
being to all things, and to his Word) The God of Abraham, The God of Isaac, and
The God of Jacob, (with whom he made the everlasting Covenant.) This his Name
for ever, and his Memorial to all Generations: and so, The Lord, The Lord God,
merciful and gracious, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and Truth, (great
in mercy, good to all, and his tender mercies over all his Works) keeping mercy
for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and that will by
no means clear the guilty, (that is, such as refuse and rebel against this
mercy and goodness, when in the means tendered to them, and so will not come
into him for Life, will none of him and his ways, but) visiting the iniquity
of the Fathers upon their Children, and upon the Childrens children, unto the
third and to the fourth generation, explicated, Exodus 20.5. upon them that hate
me, (that hate me that am so gracious and merciful, and so reward me with evil
for good, and hatred for love) on such, and no other but such as so hate him,
will he execute sore punishment. He is the Lord God of Hosts, All-sufficient,
that rules by his power for ever; a just God, a Savior, and there is none
besides him, that calls all the ends of the Earth to look to him, and be saved.
This, and much more abundantly explained in many places of the Holy Scriptue,
is the Name of God, which is so excellent, glorious and gracious, that they
that know his Name will put their trust in him, and are allowed therein to
rejoice.

2. That this his Name, (even Himself, Joh. 14.9, 10 and 1.18 1 Cor. 10.9 Mat.
3.1 Isa. 55.4 Exodus 23.21 Isa. 7.14 Mat. 1.23 Isa. 9.6 Jer. 23.6 Tit. 2.13 Romans
9.5 1 John 4.14
and his Memorial) he has put in and upon his Son, that is, The Man Christ, he
is The Angel that Israel tempted in the Wilderness, the Messenger of the
Covenant: in whom his Name is, and he is, and is called; so that he and his
Name is Emmanuel, (that is, God with us, in our Nature, and for us) Wonderful,
Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace,
Jehovah our righteousness, the mighty God, and our Savior Jesus Christ, God
over all blessed for ever, The Savior of the World, Joh. 4.42. God's Salvation
to the ends of the earth, Isa. 45.22 Phil. 2.7, 10 Col. 1 28 Col. 2.9, 10 Joh.
1.4 1 Job. 5.10, 11 Col. 2.3 Isa. 42.1 and 61.1, 2, 3, 4 2 Cor. 3.18 and 4.6
Isa. 55.4, 5 Joh. 4.10 Isa. 65.1 2 Cor. 3.3, 4 Heb. 1.3.
Isa. 49.6. Act. 1.3.47. who has declared the Father's Name, Psalm. 22.22. Heb.
2.11, 12. Ioh. 1.18. and 17.6. Psalm. 18.49. with Romans 15.9. and so calls all
to look to him, and come to him and be saved; for in and by him the peace is
made, the price is paid, and all fullness and perfection of Furniture is in him
for every Man: in him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily; in him is life;
yea, in him God has given us Eternal Life, and in him it is; in him are all
the Treasures of Wisdom and Understanding; yea, the fullness of Spirit to show
forth the same; yea, in his appearance, presence or face, as in the Glass of
the Gospel presented, the Face of the Father shines: and in that shine, the
Divine Power and Spirit goes forth, to draw the Beholders to desire after, and
believe in him, and to confirm the Believers while beholding him, and conform
Believers to him: so that the Father's Name for Goodness, Power, Excellency,
etc. is in and upon him; he is the brightness of his Glory.

3. That God in his Purpose has appointed and approved this to be the way to
call and bring in a Seed to Christ, namely, to declare his Name, and set him
forth as the Holy Ghost has testified of him, and left that Record in the
Gospel: and so to preach him the Savior of the World, the only Rock,
Foundation, the Wisdom of God, the Beloved of God, See this in Part 2. chap.
10. etc. 11.
and Lover of Men, etc. as is foreshewn.

And thus of his Purpose, and in that his Purposes concerning the Man Jesus
Christ; from which known and believed, we may learn,

1. Romans 1.2, 5 and 16.25, 26 1 John 1.1, 2, 3 1 Pet. 1.20, 21 Ephesians. 3.3, 9 ^
That the Gospel in the whole Testimony of Jesus Christ, it is in that which he
is become and has done according to the Purpose of God, now manifested
according to the Revelation of the mystery; so as the Gospel is the Revelation
of the Purpose of God.

2. Prove. 8.4, 9 and 22.20, 21 1 Timothy 2.6, 7 Prove. 26.23, 26
That the Gospel in all the Sayings and Promises of it, is really true, and
true to all to whom it is declared: there is no wreathedness or equivocation, no
Declaration or pretense of Love, no tender of Mercy to any, but what is really
true; no fair words with an inward covered hatred, which God abhors; but all
Truth, even that which is in, 2 Cor. 1.18, 19, 20, 21 2 Pet. 1.16
and came forth of the Bosom and Heart of the Almighty God of Truth, it being
the opening of his Will and Purpose.

3. That the Purposes of God beginning in his Son, Luke 1.70 2 Pet. 1.20, 21
and being through and for his Son, and so made known by him, they all as
revealed and written in the Holy Scriptures, are all and altogether true, like
himself, his own Mind, and in that manner to be performed, being all the
Breathings of his own Spirit by the Mouth of his Holy Prophets: and so there is
no secret or unrevealed Purpose in God, that is in any wise contrary to those
he has revealed.

4. That Purpose, and Approbation of that purposed, Isa. 42.1 1 Pet. 1.1, 2
and so Election, are distinct; and Purpose in order first, though they meet in
one.

5. That Jesus Christ, even as the spiritual Man that died, and is risen and
exalted at the right Hand of God, Col. 1.15, 19
is the first and choice Elect in order and manner of choice, before and above
all others, and no other but in and by him.

1. He had his Being in and with the Father, even from Eternity, Joh. 1.1, 2
Pro. 8, 22 Col. 1, 17, 18
and the Lord possessed him in the beginning of his way: he is before all
things; but that Being of his, and the Glory he had with the Father, was
incommunicable to Mankind; yea, without his taking Man's Nature, Heb. 2.7, 12.
and the consideration of his Abasement and Exaltation in that Nature; the
Excellencies and Privileges thereof was incommunicable to fallen Mankind: and
he as Man is God's first Elect; Isa. 42.1 Ephesians. 1.3, 4
and without that, could none be elected in him: and had any been otherwise
fore-elected in him, he would without doubt have kept them, and so must have
laid aside their Glory, when he laid aside his own; which I suppose none will
say he did, nor that any were in him as he gave his life for the World, and so
Redeemers with him.

2. He was one with the Father, and with him in his being, Prove. 8.22.31.
and in all his Purposes and Decrees and Ways, and so in the Election of
himself as the second public Man, his first-begotten Son, etc. I hope none
will affirm or conceit the like of any other elect ones.

3. Psalm. 40.6, 7 Heb. 10.5, 10 Isa. 42.1
He accepted the Fathers appointment of him to suffer and sacrifice, and do all
his will, which being accepted of him by the Father, was virtuous from the
beginning; and so he as the spiritual Man was approved of God; and being
pre-approved, was also in that sense elected before the beginning of the World:
but so, and on such account was no other besides him elected.

4. The actual and visible election of him was begun in his birth, perfected
through sufferings, Luke 1.35 Heb. 2.10 and 8.1 Joh. 1.13, 16, 17 Ephesians. 1.3
and completed in his exaltation at the right hand of God, and so filled with
all fullness of Grace, Truth and spiritual blessings: and the blessed election
of others is in him thus considered.

5. Psa. 89.19 Deuteronomy. 18.15, 18 Joh. 8.23 and 15.19
He was chosen from among Men, being made Man, and born of a Woman; but he was
not chosen out of the World, of which he never was: but others that come to be
chosen in and by him, are chosen out of the World, of which they sometime and
in some sense were.

6. Joh. 15.16
He was chosen in and by no other Man, but all other Men that are chosen, are
chosen in and by him: all these things are shown in that foresaid. By all which
it appears he is the first, prime and choice elect, and the fountain, medium
and root of election for others.

6. Joh. 1.18 1 John 5.20 Mat. 7.27
That no man of us can rightly understand and know the Purpose, and in it the
Purposes of God, or his election of any in Christ; but by first knowing Christ,
and the purposes of God concerning him, and God's election of him: all right
knowing of God, being in knowing of Christ; and so all right knowing of his
Purposes and Election, in the knowledge of his Purposes concerning Christ and
his election of him, Chapter 2. before.
as appears in all foresaid. And according to this knowledge, with the Cautions
fore-premised, I will proceed to speak of his Purposes concerning Mankind, as
included and ordered in this great Purpose, and Purposes therein concerning
Christ already spoken of.

CHAP. 4.
Of the Purposes of God concerning Mankind.

GOd in these his Purposes concerning Jesus Christ, and in his Election of him,
has purposed also concerning Mankind for the honor of his Son: which Purpose,
as ordered in his counsel, is not conceiveable and expressable for us, but in
distinct and several parcels: and so in Scripture I find,

1. The Purpose of God to be, To give all Mankind unto his Son Christ, to be
his, and under his Dominion and dispose, Romans 14.8, 9 1 Cor. 6.20. 1 Cor 5.14,
15
as their rightful Lord, to whom they ought of right to live; and so living to
him, not to perish, but have life: and this upon the account of his death and
sacrifice for them; yea, whether they yield willingly to live to him, or rebel
against him; yet upon the account of his death, resurrection and sacrifice, he
would give them all unto him, Psa. 2.1, 6, 7, 8, 9
even the Heathen for his inheritance, and the utmost parts of the Earth for
his possession, and he shall rule them, and dispose of them, and judge them.
And upon the same account of his sufferings and sacrifice, Phil. 2.7, 8, 9, 10,
11 2 Cor. 5.10 Romans 2.16 and 1.9, 10, 11, 12
in the Name of Jesus (in the power and Authority of him) every knee shall bow,
etc. and every tongue shall confess that Jesus is the Lord, to the Glory of
God: and all shall appear before his Judgment Seat, and be judged by him on
the same account; so that Jesus Christ, by virtue of his Ransom given, is Lord
of all, according to the Purpose of God; according to which Purpose also, all
Men ought of right to acknowledge him, Hos. 11.4 Joh. 16.8, 11 Phil. 2.10, 11
and live to him. And those that by the cords of a Man, and bands of Love, will
not be drawn to it now, shall by his Iron-Rod, and irresistably putting forth
of his power, be brought in the last Day to that acknowledgement, to their woe.
And all this the purpose, and according to the Purpose of God, who is of one
mind, and has no secret Purpose, contrary to this revealed.

2. Isa. 45.22. Act. 14.17 and 17.26, 27, 28, 31 Romans 2.4 Psa. 33.6, 8
God also in this Purpose purposed, That means should be extended by and
through Christ to all Men, according to such Revelation of Jesus Christ, and
evidence of his Grace through him, as God has given forth to them, to evidence
and make known his Grace through the Redeemer and Mediator to all Men in
several ages, to call and lead them to Repentance and Faith in him, that they
might not rebel against their Redeemer and rightful Lord, and so lose their own
Souls, and procure to themselves perishing in a second death; but by coming in
to the acknowledgement of him in this Day of Grace, escape that perishing, and
have everlasting Life. And all this he has done and does according to his
Purpose, as is shown in treating of the several Revelations of Christ: See the
first 15 Chap. of the 3 Part.
and as he purposed, so according to his purpose, he sends forth in his
seasons, light and power in the means, and in an especial manner, where the
Gospel, in which is the fullest Revelation of Christ come forth, Genesis 6.3 Psalm.
78 Isa. 55.4, 5 Ezekiel. 24.13 Joh. 3.17 Act. 26.18
is sent: in which Language I am to speak: he gives this light and Power in
the means, working and moving at the Hearts of Men, that they might repent and
believe, and so be saved; yea, he leaves none, till he have in some measure
stretched forth his hand; so, Joh. 1.9 Isa. 42.7, 8 Romans 10.8, 9. 2 Cor. 6.2
as by his Spirit he has enlightened them in some measure to discern, brought
his Word nigh them, and moved at their hearts, that they might believe, being
at hand to succor and enable them thereto, it being his gracious mind they
should accept: and all this according to his purpose, which is seen in his
works, as has been often shown before.

3. God in his Purposes also purposed, his Purpose as so ordered in the counsel
of his will and purpose, is, That having thus given Men into the dispose of
Christ, and through him used such means toward them, that those of them, that
believe in Christ according to the means and light therein with help extended,
shall not perish but have Eternal Life; and such as persist, rebelling against
the light and means therein, and so will not believe, shall be damned. This is
verily the declared purpose of God, and it is sure according to his mind and
heart: and this appears in God's speaking to Abraham, in whose loins, Christ,
according to the flesh, was, and forth of him to come: and to him God said,
Thou shall be a blessing, or Be thou a blessing, Genesis 12.2, 3 and 18.18 Gal.
3.8 Genesis 22.18 Gal. 3.16 Act. 3.25
(which is no less then a promise and command of the blessing to be on him for
others:) and who they are, is opened. And, In thee shall all the families of
the earth be blessed. And this explicated to be meant of his Seed, which is
Christ, that was to come of him. So God opening his will and purpose to
Abraham, in preaching this Gospel to him, assures him of blessing in Christ for
all Nations: and this to be held forth in the Gospel given him to preach; in
which preaching, he should also be a blessing, as their feet are beautiful that
bring glad tidings of peace, and this to and for all, that they might receive
it. But who are they that shall indeed partake of it according to this purpose
of God? the Lord tells Abraham, And I will bless him that blesses thee, Genesis
12.3
(accepts and rejoices in thy Message,) and curse him that curses thee,
(that despises so great blessing and salvation) suitable to that said by
Christ to his Apostles: which rightly understood, Luke 10.16
his purpose clearly is declared. And suitable to this is that spoken of Christ
in means using, Dout. 18.15, 18, 19 Act. 3.19, 23 Isa. 28.16 1 Pet. 2.6, 7, 8
Joh. 8.24 Joh. 3.36
He shall speak forth the words of blessing; but he that hearkneth not to him,
shall be cut off. And yet more plain by the following Prophets, He that
believes in himshall not make haste, or be ashamed: judgment also will I lay
to the line, etc. explicated by the Apostle to have this meaning: and yet still
more full by John Baptist: He that believes on the Son, has everlasting life;
and he that believes not the Son, shall not see life. But most plain and
express is this in our Savior's own words to Nicodemus, Joh. 3.14, 15, 16, 17
where he plainly shows what the will and purpose of God was and is in the gift
of his Son the Savior of the world: and the means he uses toward them by
him, even express, That they might be saved; namely, That men according to the
means and light vouchsafed, Verse. 17 Verse. 14, 15
might believe in him: for our Savior speaks both to Nicodemus, a man to whom
means was extended, and of others as means should be extended to them. And then
in plain terms, he farther opens and affirms the will and purpose of God to be,
That whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life; but
he that believes not, (namely, Verse. 15, 16
when this light in the means is vouchsafed to him) is condemned already,
(namely, in the tenor of the Gospel-Declaration, Joh. 12.47, 48. and 15.22.)
and even for this condemned, because he has not believed in the Name of the
only begotten Son of God, Verse. 18 Verse. 14, 15, 16, 17
which has been displayed to him in the Gospel: and this is evident in that
which follows: And this is the condemnation, That light is come into the world,
Verse. 19
and men loved darkness rather then light, because their deeds were evil. This
is the sin for which, and that which shall be laid to their charge, as that for
which they shall be even so condemned, and if not now taken that they might
repent, yet hereafter the same Spirit in this Gospel shall convince them of
sin, Joh. 16.7, 8, 9
because they believed not on Christ: so as if they persist in refusing his
words, Joh. 12.48 Romans 2.16
and to believe in him, the word or Gospel preached to them, shall judge them
at the last day, when Christ will judge them according to the Gospel, when he
will be admired in his Saints, that in this Day of Grace have believed the
Testimony of him; and the rest, that by the means he used, 2 These. 1.7, 8, 9,
10.
have not known God in his gracious Mind, nor obeyed the Gospel, shall perish
from his presence. And to conclude this point, our Savior, in giving
commission to his Apostles to preach the Gospel to every Creature, tells them
plainly the purpose and will of his Father and himself, Mar. 16.15.16
saying, He that believes and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that
believes not, shall be damned. Nothing can be said more plain and full.

And thus have we this Will and Purpose of God revealed in the Scripture, and
clearly opened and revealed by the Son of God, Joh. 1.18 Joh. 15.15 and 17.6, 8
that is in the bosom of the Father, and knows his Mind and Secrets, and in
this has so clearly declared him, and made known his Father's Name, Words and
Counsel to his first Witnesses; and shall not we believe God's Son? As for that
saying of Mr. Owen's, P. 53. Sect. 10.1.
That conditional promises or threats are not declarative of God's purposes
concerning persons, but of his moral approbation or rejection of things, it
cannot turn us out of our way in this; for our Savior was not setting out a
conditional promise or threat to Nicodemus, but the general Doctrine of the
Gospel, Joh. 3.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Mar. 15.16
and therein the will and purpose of God in means extended, concerning all Men:
and so declares the same in his commission giving to his Apostles; yea, here
all along in every Scripture alleged, it is clear he speaks directly of
persons; for they speak not in these terms; Blessing hearing, believing and
obeying, shall be accepted; which yet were very strange, if they should be
accepted, and not the person so blessing, hearing, believing, obeying: nor are
the terms, cursing, not harkening, not believing, etc. shall be rejected and
condemned; which yet how that may be, and the person guilty, not repenting,
saved, is a riddle: as for any approbation or rejection in and by God of these
things, that is not Divine, I say nothing. But if promises or threats be
understood in the terms they are given forth by God, That Repentance, Faith and
Obedience called for should be morally by God approved, and the person
repenting, believing and obeying, damned; or that such as heed neither promises
nor threats, but persist in impenitency, unbelief and disobedience, should have
their impenitency, unbelief and disobedience morally rejected by God, and yet
be in their own persons without any repentance, etc. saved, I loath to believe,
and I think Mr. Owen would hate to persuade any; I wish none, for fear of being
conquered by Truth, would devise such expressions so Scriptureless, See Part 1.
chapter 7.
as are apt to take off the edge and force of all such promises and threats for
the end for which they are given, in the hearts of all that heed such
expressions, whose tendency is to wave Men from believing the verity of the
plain import of Scripture: to which with this expression, it is contrary, as to
the rule, and his own sayings.

But some may say, All this while you have told us of no purpose of God,
concerning the persons of Mankind, who shall certainly believe, and who shall
not believe.

To which I answer, I find no such purpose revealed in the Scripture
concerning the Sons of Adam, as Adam's Sons: but those purposes of God I find
revealed in Scripture, I know to have come forth of the bosom of God, who is
of one mind; and I also know, that there is no purpose in his bosom contrary
to that which he has revealed, and a purpose of some Men as Adam's Sons merely
considered as such, and fallen would be; and a purpose of some as such, That
they shall not believe, would be cross to the will of God revealed in the
Gospel. Nor could I ever find any, the acutest wits, that ever could either
find out such purposes or expressions in the Scripture, importing a
probability of it; nor can they tell the persons who are under such purposes:
as for their term Elect, it has been, and will again be fully shown, how it is
abused and wrested to such an end: yet of the Sons of Adam, under some
consideration, who, his purpose is, shall believe; and who not, after Caution
given, I shall endeavor to show.

The Caution I desire to be heeded is this, Caution.
That for the Sons of Men, as that is true which is affirmed of them in the two
public Men, Romans 5.12, 18. and that by Christ, being made under the Law, Gal.
3.13 and 4.4 Romans 2.16
and a curse for them, they are redeemed from the curse of the Law, and shall
not be judged by it, but according to the Gospel by Christ: so, for those of
them that die or depart this life, before they come to the use of
understanding, and so have not sinned against their Redeemer, by refusing any
means, nor mis-believed, or chosen any Idol; So actual believing is not
required of them: Mat. 25.25, 26 and 18.3, 6 and 19.14 Mar. 9.36, 37
nor will he that looks not to gather where he has not sown, impute unbelief
to them; and if not that, then no sin that can bring them under a
Gospel-Condemnation; and so by interpretation, in his gracious account and
acceptance they are as Believers, and of the Kingdom; and he can regenerate
them in the very taking away their breath, if not before; and he will complete
their Regeneration with the reft of the Saints in the Resurrection of the Just:
and of these he has an innumerable Seed or Generation. But these come not in
the number I am to speak of, nor was any purpose against these. Let this be
heeded.

Again, for the Sons of Men, as Men fallen and merely natural, and come to the
use of understanding; yet if no day of gracious visitation has passed on them,
so as in some measure to open their eyes, and give them to discern, and move in
their hearts toward convincement and turning: these are all yet in blindeness,
darkness, and under the power of sin and Satan, corruption in sinful lusts
working in them; and so are blind, deaf, dead, in respect of the Life of God
in Christ, and so are unable to hear, see, understand and believe the Testimony
of Christ; yea, all that come to the use of understanding, till by some light
and power from God, they be so visited as to be touched in heart, somewhat
lighted and touched with some convincements in means used, are in this evil
case, and none better then other in that respect. And these are not the objects
or subjects of the purposes I have to speak of; but as there is in the will and
purpose of God, a Day or Days of Visitation for all that are come to the use
of understanding, 1 Pet. 2.22.
especially where the Gospel comes and is preached among them, as it is among
those I can speak or write to: So of such as this Day of Visitation has passed
upon, let me be understood; namely, of those toward whom God in using means,
does in the means he uses, and by the light and power he therein extends,
open their ears to hear his voice, and enlightneth their mind to discern; so
opening their eyes, to see in some measure what is presented to and required of
them; and moves in their hearts by his word sounded, and grace presented, that
they might in seeing see, in hearing hear, and so understand, and turn toward
him; and so he would heal them. In all which, there is no betterness in one
more then in another; yea, they that in seeing see, have nothing to glory in,
but the Riches of his Grace, in giving them such an eye, and alluring them with
such an object, in seeing to see, and extending so freely following Grace to
heal them. But they that in seeing see not, when an eye is given them, and such
an object presented to their view; but for the love of any other thing, dislike
the light, and so close their eyes, stop their ears, and harden their hearts,
have therein willingly made themselves much worse then either themselves or
their Fellows forewere, and this not through any want on the part of God or
Christ, but merely through wilfulness in themselves, and siding with the
Tempter. And of Men thus visited, and under this consideration, I am now to
speak: and so in the Scripture I find.

4. God's will and purpose concerning these thus described, and under this
consideration, and so beheld, That those, who when he has so opened their ears
and eyes, and sounded his Word, and presented Truth to them, and moved in their
hearts, that they might in hearing hear, and in seeing see, and they then do in
hearing hear or attend his voice, and in seeing see, and mind what he
displayeth and presents to them, and so in the motion and strength given
them, are assaying to turn at his reproof, he will heal, that is, save, enlive,
and enable them to believe, and so pour our his Spirit, and make known his
words unto them: such his purpose, his word, his promise. But those that when
he has so opened their ears and eyes, and is moving in their hearts, as has
been said, that they having eyes and ears, might in seeing see, and in hearing
hear, and then they for the love of any lust or conceited goodly thing or
opinion, or supposed righteousness, close their eyes at the light, reproving
it, and so will not in seeing see, etc. lest they should understand and be
converted; these he will blind and harden, so as they cannot believe, but
stumble at the word discovering Christ, and convincing: yet will he not
altogether give over these at the first repulse, but come again with some
chastisements, and renewed reproofs and strivings: and if they abide not still
in impenitency and unbelief, he will receive and save them: but if they still
wilfully persist in their rebellion, he will reprobate them, and then they
cannot believe, but shall be eternally damned, and so eat the fruit (he says
not, of his decrees, but) of their own ways; Prove. 1.31, 32 Hos. 13. 2 Pet.
2.1. Mat. 16.26
so that their destruction is of themselves, they have lost their own Souls.
And these to be the purposes of God, and in this manner to be fulfilled, is
abundantly clearly revealed and affirmed in the Scripture, John 5.25. The dead
(as all by nature are in sins and trespasses, Joh. 5.25 Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3
and that meant here, expressly shown, by mentioning that as another manner of
death, when Men are in their Graves, verse. 28, 29.) shall hear the voice of the
Son of God, and (he says not, all they shall live, but) they that hear shall
live. Which can be no other, but they that in hearing hear: he that quickneth
whom he will, will quicken them, and they shall live, verse. 21-26. the Father
and he being one in will and purpose; and so our Savior opens it himself,
declaring this to be the way of his Father's and his proceeding according to
his purpose; and so his purpose, when he tells his Disciples the cause why he
spoke to the people in Parables, Mat. 4.23
to whom it appears in all the three Evangelists, he had before preached the
Gospel plainly, and they had not so received as to become his Disciples: he
says to them that in hearing were become his Disciples,

Mat. 13. Mat. 13. v. 11,
verse. 11. Becanse it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven: but to them it is not given: 12,
(now mind the cause or reason) for whosoever has, to him shall be given, and
he shall have more abundance; but whosoever has not, from him shall be taken
away, even that which he has. (And this explicated by himself,) Therefore
speak I to them in parables, 13,
because they seeing see not, and hearing hear not, etc. which is plain to be
They have their eyes opened, and their ears opened, and by spiritual motion the
word sown in their heart. And so has, that is, has had given him an eye to
see, an ear to hear, and the Word with motion brought to his Heart; and so has
a price put in his hand. Pro. 17.16 with 9.12.
Now he that has, that is, that here through has an heart, and so has in
usefulness, does in hearing hear, and in seeing see; and minding the Word come
to his heart, does understand, and so in heart turns to learn of the Lord; he
shall be healed, and have more abundance, and so be enabled to believe; that in
believing, he may understand the mysteries of the Kingdom, and be eternally
saved. But whosoever has not; that is when an eye to see is given him, etc.
and so he has a voice, and an ear to hear it; a demonstration, and an eye to
see; yea the word came with motion to his heart: and yet, though he has all
this, he has not; that is, he has not by all this an heart, he has not in
usefulness any of this given him, he does not in seeing see, etc. but for love
of some other thing, closes his eyes, etc. lest by hearing, and seeing and
heeding that word that moved at his heart, he should be turned from that thing
he loves; Mat. 13.13, 14, 15, 19
from these shall be taken away even that they have; that sight, and hearing
and inward moving of the Word in their heart, which they have, shall be taken
away; yea, even therefore, and for that cause: and so God will blind and
harden them: and so Joh. 12.35.40, those that while light was with them,
Compar. Isa. 53. 1 and 6.9, 10 with Joh. 12.35, 38 and ^.39, 40
the Gospel plainly declared to them with such power and helps, yet did not
believe the report in the plain sayings thereof, are said to have the purpose
of God in so blinding, etc. according to the prophecy fulfilled on them; yea
to be so and on that very ground fulfilled on them; and then, when so
fulfilled, they could not believe. And the Apostle also, in Acts 28.27. renders
this also, even their own dullness of hearing, and closing their eyes, Isa. 6.9,
10 with Act. 28.26, 27, 28
lest they should see etc. as the very ground and cause of that judgment of
not perceiving, fulfilled on them; and so of their not believing. And the
Apostle Peter says in effect (by the Spirit of Christ) the same, 1 Pet. 2.6
with Act. 26.18
when having mentioned the excellency of the foundation laid in Sion, and held
forth by Sion, to so gracious an end, he says,

1 Pet. 2.7. Unto you therefore which believe, (that is, which having eyes
opened to discern* do in seeing see, and so are perswadable, Isa. 4 2. 1 Pet.
^, 3, 4, 5, 7 Romans 1.5 and 16.26
and brought in to believe) he is precious; (he is beauty and glory, comeliness
and excellency, alluring and drawing you more and more in believing upon him)
but to them which be disobedient, (that is, to the Faith preached to them,
being unperswadable when means is used, Ephesians. 5.6
and such an object demonstrated, and sight afforded, Act. 4.11
will not in seeing see, and so are disobedient, even children of disobedience
or unperswadableness) the stone which the builders (the Ecclesiastical
pretended Teachers) disallowed, the same is become the head of the corner. (By
which, notwithstanding their disallowance and opposition, Mat. 21.42 Psa. 118,
22 Mat. 21.43. 1 Pet. 2.8 Joh. 3.19 Isa. 8.23, 16.
you are brought in and builded on it, and united together by it; and they that
so disallow it, rejected: and so that also follows,) And a stone of stumbling,
and a rock of offense to them which stumble at the word, (which can be no less
then when by light discovered, do of themselves first stumble, being so
distinguished from them, that upon the discovery, sanctify God in their
hearts, for this gift of his Son) these being disobedient, whereunto also they
were appointed. Luke 2.34. and Isa. 8.14, 15, 16 with Jer. 5.3, 4 and 8.12
Prove. 1.23, 24, 25-31 Isa. 5.3, 4, 5 Jer. 6.16, 30 Ezekiel. 24.13
Which is very clear to be, that such as when Christ in the Gospel is set forth
to them for their fall and rising again, in discovery of whom, all other
Excellencies are cried down, and the glory of God's rich Grace in Christ only
exalted; they discerning the light what it discovers, do refuse to own their
shame in the fall, that they may by him only be raised: and so Christ is to
them a sign and a rock of offense, and they stumble. And these, and such as
these, even for this cause, were appointed to farther stumbling, and so cannot
believe; yea, this is held forth clearly to us also, in many other places of
Scripture, all speaking in this Language, as also in that example
forementioned, Joh. 6.28, 30, 41, 42, 60, 66. So that concerning the Purpose of
God, who shall be helped to believe, and who not; we have it clear from Jesus
Christ by his Spirit in the Prophets and in the Apostles, and in his own
personal sayings, to be men under such considerations: and it becomes us to
desire no other knowledge of this. And to this also very well agrees that
which is said, Romans 9.18. He has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
will be hardneth. For God has not left us in the dark, nor spoken as a
Barbarian to us; so as none can know by his revealed will on whom he will have
mercy, or whom he will harden: but has made known his mind, that as he first
shows mercy on or to all, and this that they may repent; And therefore
discovers the evilness of their hearts and ways, and the emptiness of all
their righteousness, Romans 2.4 and 9.16 Hos. 13.9 Job 33.15, 16-24
and of all earthy things to help them; and that help is only in and of him
that shows mercy; yea, and afflicts them for not turning in to him by his
mercy so also he lets us know, to whom all this mercy shown, and means used,
and transgression still found, he will yet show mercy, namely, to such as by
his continued mercies and chastisements for so gracious an end, do, on sight of
his goodness, against which they have transgressed, fall down in confessing
their sinfulness; 1 Pet. 5.5, 6 Jam. 4.6 Prove. 3.34 Mat. 23.12 Luke 18.14 Prove.
28.13, 14 Deuteronomy. 29.19, 20
and in belief of the Testimony of his graciousness, desire mercy of him, he
will show mercy on them, he will give Grace to them, and lift them up. But to
such as in his call by the mercies and chastisements which he uses, refuse to
hearken and behold, and so scorn to fall down and humble themselves under his
mighty hand, but still persist to go on in their own ways; he will not show
mercy on them, but harden them; and in the continuance of their persisting,
give them up to a reprobate mind, and to Satan; as is full and plain in many
places of Scripture besides these quoted.

And thus the Purposes of God concerning Mankind as revealed in Scripture, are
verily such as is said; and in this written of them in these four Branches of
his Purpose, compared with that said in the second Chapter of this fourth part,
in the Cautions there given. But now, because we read of many that depart from
the Faith, some may desire to know what his Purposes are concerning such as are
once brought to believe, who of them shall be eternally saved, and who not. To
which a short answer might serve, Joh. 3.16 Heb. 11.13 2 Pet. 2.20.21
That no unfeigned Believer shall perish, but have everlasting life: and so all
that live and die in the Faith shall be eternally saved; only those that fall
from their Faith, and die in unbelief, shall be eternally damned: which is a
true and full answer; but it will not satisfy all that enquire. I shall
therefore endeavor to set forth the Purpose of God concerning these, as set
forth and explicated in Scripture, concerning these who are once brought to
believe, and in that sense called Believers; and so let the term be understood.

CHAP. 5.
Of the Purposes of God concerning Believers.

BY Believers I mean not such as only feign, pretend and profess themselves to
believe, and do not; nor does the Scripture anywhere call any upon that account
Believers but Hypocrites. But as in Scripture-account, so by Believers I mean,
such as do indeed in some measure believe the word or Testimony of Christ; and
so, though that Testimony be but one, and Faith one, and but one true
believing; yet of those that do indeed believe the same Testimony, confess the
same Faith, I find two sorts of Believers, as is before shown at large.

First, See Part 3. chapter 17.
such as in hearing and minding the Testimony of Christ, do indeed believe it
to be true and good, but are not yet prevailed with and overcome by that
believed, as to part with all other designs and confidences for life, and to
believe on Christ for all promised, etc. as foreshewn. Now the Purpose of God
concerning these, is, That they continuing in his Word, (that is, in belief,
and minding his word they have heard and believed, Joh. 8.30, 31
attending it, and beholding him as discovered therein; in which they are his
Disciples indeed, that is, such as he teaches, and do begin to learn of him;
Joh. 10.26, 27 Joh. 8.32, 33, 36
and so are the Sheep of his Ministration) they shall know the Truth, and the
Truth shall make them free: which, as yet appears in the following Verses, was
wanting to them. This said Jesus that was in the bosom of the Father, and
spoke nothing but what the Father gave him to speak; and so declared nothing
about this, but what was in Truth the real Mind and Purpose of his Father and
himself; yea, this suits with that declared by the Prophet; and this is
affirmed to be the End (and so the Purpose of God) in sending forth his Son the
Savior of the world, Isa. 45.22 Luke ^.60, 69, 70, 71, 76, 77 Joh. 3.14, 15,
16, 17 and 5.34 Mar. 1 ^.15, 16 Act. 10.43
and declaring him in the Ministration of the Gospel. And thus has Christ
spoken since concerning every one that believes the Testimony of the Gospel,
He shall be saved: and by his Spirit in all his Prophets and Apostles, Such
shall receive Remission of sins, they shall be saved: he does not so express
it, as affirming of them all that which may be affirmed of some, even as many
as believe with the Heart unto Righteousness, Romans 10.9 Romans 10.10. 1 Cor.
1.18. 2 Cor. 2.15 Ephesians. 2.5 2 Timothy 1.9
and confess with the Mouth unto Salvation, that they are saved. Neither does
this hinder this understanding of this phrase, That there is for these saved
Ones, a continued saving, in preserving them from error in Judgment and Life,
in the believing remembrance of this Testimony, in which they shall be so
saved, 1 Cor. 15.1, 2, 3, 4
and a complete Salvation with which they shall be saved after they have
endured to the end; inasmuch as in respect of the begun Salvation, they are
already saved, and so affirmed to be; which our Savior says, Mat. 24.13. 1
Cor. 6.11 Col. 1.12, 13
was yet wanting to these Believers he spoke to, Joh. 8.30-36. Nor can this
said of this Purpose be waved off with this, That here is no more said to these
Believers, then to all unbelievers and mis-believers; of whom also it is said,
his sending forth of Christ in the Ministration of the Gospel, is, That they
might be saved; and that also in looking to him, Joh. 2.14, 17 and 5.34 Act.
26.18 Isa. 45.22
and believing on him, they shall be saved. All which is true; and yet not all
said to these Believers: for unbelievers and mis-believers are not entering the
way of Salvation, nor anywhere said to believe in his Name, or believe in him,
so far as to believe the Testimony of him true and good; and so it is never said
to them, If you continue in your mind or way, that is, in your unbelief or
mis-belief, ye shall be saved: but the very contrary. Nor is it said, Joh. 3.36
and 8.24
If they continue in his words; for if they have not rejected them, yet they
have not received them in believing, though it may be in memory, to abuse and
make ill use of. But these spoke of, Joh. 12.47, 48 and 15.20 Mat. 26.61
believed his Words; and in believing, had so received them, that our Savior
says, If ye continue in my words, ye are my Disciples indeed; and ye shall
know the Truth, and the Truth shall make you free; and elsewhere, shall be
saved, which yet they were not: and if the Word of Faith they believed, though
yet they saw not all that was in it, were not true, and saving; or if their
believing were not true, and of a saving Nature; such as though yet it had not,
would in continuance drink in more saving, efficacies then by cotinuance
therein, they could no more be saved, then by continuance in unbelief or
mis-belief: but our Savior affirms of these Believers, If they continue in his
words they believed, they should be saved. In which saying he has plainly
asserted the Mind and Purpose of God concerning such: and that there are many
Believers in the outward Court of the Church, that yet are no farther wrought
on then these, is evident enough; and probable also, such were in the outward
Court in the first and choice times, by that phrase, Act. 2.47. The Lord added
to the Church daily such as should be saved: it is neither said, Such as were
saved, nor such as against all contradiction shall infallibly be eternally
saved; but, such as should be saved (that is, according to our Savior's
Doctrine, continuing in his words they had believed) and of these added Ones,
we read of two notable Ones among them, Act. 5.1, 10
that miscarried for want of heeding the Word testified by the Holy Ghost: and
for this cause, because the Devil knows, That when the Word is come into the
Heart of any, if it continue in the Heart, and they abide in it, they shall be
saved; Therefore he stirs himself to steal it out of the Heart, lest they
should be saved. Luke 8.12
And indeed Men thus far brought to believe, if they continue not in his Word,
they lose the livingness and quickening of the Spirit in the Gospel, and so
close their eyes again; and then, though they continue a profession of Faith,
yet it is but a dead Faith, Jam. 2.26
destitute of that Life and Motion of Faith, the Spirit in the Gospel
affords: as the Body of a Man, though for a time retaining its form, yet when
Life and Motion is gone is dead; yet as that is no good Argument to prove there
never was Life in that Body, so neither is this deadness of Faith any proof
that there never was livingness in it: but it rather evidenceth the Truth of
our Savior's Testimony, Joh. 15.6
If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and withers etc.
which could not be, if he never had sap, moisture and greenness.

Yea, Page 429. Answ, 1.
Mr. Owen confesses thus much, That before their falling away, they were in a
fair way for life and salvation, and that their falling away is from gifts and
common graces.

Now this is certain, they could not be in any way for Salvation, if Christ by
his Death had not made satisfaction for them, and received Spirit in their
Nature to send forth and apply it to them: nor could they be in a fair way to
Salvation, if there were no will in God through Christ by the means extended to
save them; yea, they could not be in a fair way for Life and Salvation, if the
Word they believed, and their believing, and the Gifts and Graces they
received, were not all true, of the right kind, and of a saving Nature and
Tendency, so as abiding and dying in it, he is certainly saved: for what Faith
or Gift soever a Man has, that continuing and dying in, he is yet damned
eternally: he was in the having them in a deceitful way, a way to death, and
not in a fair way to Life and Salvation. But enough is said to show the Purpose
of God concerning such Believers as these. But to proceed:

Secondly, There are Believers, that through the Testimony of Christ, having
their eyes opened, and their Hearts brought to believe the Testimony to be true
and good, and not so only, Romans 5.6, 8, 9, 10 and 4.22-25 Tit. 2.14 and 3.4,
5, 6. 1 Pet. 1.20, 21, 22
but in that believing, to mind and believe the greatness and immensness of
the Love of God commended in this, that while we were sinners, and enemies to
him, his Son Christ died for us, and made peace by his blood, and now has as
freely made it known to us; so, as thereby they are reconciled to God, and
enabled to believe on him for that eternal Life he has promised; and in that
renewed in heart to a child-like disposition: and concerning these thus
believing in him, the Purpose or Purposes of God are,

1. That he will put his Spirit in them, Ezekiel. 36.27. Joh. 6.68, 69 Mat. 16.16,
17 Isa. 59.21 Joh. 14.16, 17, 26 Joh 16.13, 14, 15, 16 Heb. 8.10 Rom 8.26 Psa.
73.23, 24
and cause them to walk in his Statutes, that he shall not only be with them,
to give them now and then some Light and Motion to make him known in his Words,
and affect their hearts, as before he did; but he shall be in them, that is,
take up such an Habitation in the Word put in their Heart, that he shall be an
indwelling Advocate and Comforter thereby within them, to bring the Sayings of
Christ to their remembrance, and te^^n them; and so to take of the things of
Christ, to show them; and so glorify him, and make him precious to their
Hearts, and write his Mind therein, and enable them to pray, and so comfort
and guide them.

2. That by his Word and Spirit he will give them to answer their Adversaries,
and subdue their sinful lusts and corruptions, Mat. 10.19 Mar. 13.11 Luke 21.15
Mic. 7.18, 19 Romans 16.21
and give them issue out of all their temptations, 1 Cor. 10.13. and shortly
(in due time) tread Satan under their Feet.

3. That he will never leave them nor forsake them, Deuteronomy. 31.6 Heb. 13.5 Isa.
43.1, 4, 5. 1 Samuel 2.9 Psa. 97.10 Pro. 2.8
but uphold them in his way, and so be with them in the worst of hours, when
they are most opposed, and pass through fire and water, that they shall not be
overthrown; yea, he will keep their feet, and preserve their Souls in the way,
Psalm. 91
and so through Faith to the inheritance; so that though thousands miscarry,
yet no evil shall befall them: he will command safety, and deliverance, and
victory for them.

These are not only Promises, but the declared Purposes of God concerning
those that believe in him; and so are the Sons of God by Faith: and they are
made known to imbolden them confidently to abide in the ways of God without
fear, (in which way he will keep them) and that they may have a ready recourse
to the sure Rock and Object of Faith in all these Promises; Luke 1.71, 72, 73,
74, 75 Pro. 10.29. 1 Pet. 1.5
and according to all these revealed Purposes in believing, be united to him,
and so live by Faith, through which Faith, he will by his power keep them even
to the Inheritance; and that such is his Purpose, is plain, and in many places
plainly declared.

4. That such of these unfeigned Believers, as shall be found living upon this
earth, at the visible and glorious appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Cor.
15.50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 1 These. 4.14, 15, 16, 17 Heb. 11.13, 14, 39, 40 Psa.
105 9, 10, 11 Dan. 12.13
shall at that time, at the very beginning of his appearing, in a moment, in
the twinkling of an eye, be changed with a change suitable to Death and
Resurrection; so, as though they sleep not in Death, yet Death and Resurrection
both are included in this change; in which Mortality is put off, and
Immortality put on: and in the same moment, the same short time, as the
twinkling of an eye, all that from the beginning of the World to that time,
have died in the Faith; and so, though slept in Death, yet dying in the Faith
they are the D^ad in the Lord, and so in Christ, and sleep in Jesus: these
shall all be raised at once, in the same moment the other are changed; so that
all at once, and none before another, or preventing another, but all together
shall see the Lord and be caught up in that sight, to meet with him in the Air;
and so to come with him, and receive together the promised Inheritance, and so
be ever with the Lord.

And to conclude the discoursing of Purposes in this way, I shall only add
that which is fore-included and mentioned, namely, That,

5. For all this good purposed for and to Believers, he has so ordered his
Purpose in his Counsels, Joh. 1.13 Romans 9.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 11.4, 5, 6
that it shall take place for effecting and communicating all this rich, free,
and spiritual Goodness, not according to Man's natural or first birth, of what
Family or Man soever born, or by what Name in respect of that birth soever
called; nor according to the Dignities, or Degrees, or Estates conferred on Men
in this World; nor according to the Learning, Wisdom or Workings of Men of what
sort soever: but according to the Election of Grace, that is, as his free and
rich Grace in Christ, being discovered, gains in to believe; and in being
heeded and believed, does choose or elect, that is, sever from the manners and
fellowship of the World; and unite, and bring into oneness, fellowship and
conformity with Christ, and so with his. And this is that assured to Abraham,
That in his Seed all the Families of the Earth should be blessed: so, as there
is blessing in Christ for all Nations and Families: and that blessing truly
held forth for all in the Gospel given him to preach, as is foreshewed: so that
any of all the Families of the Earth, however bounded, or different in their
earthy or natural Births, Habitations, Prerogatives, Names or Works, may in
beholding this Grace of God in Christ, as displayed, be brought in to believe
in Christ, and so receive of the blessing that fore-was in him for them; and so
in views and heeding the Grace seen and believed, be by it elected, chosen out
of the Worlds Fellowship and State, into union and Fellowship and Conformity
with Christ, Joh. 1.12, 13 and 3.3, 5. 2 These. 2.13, 14. 1 Pet. 1.2
and so to enjoy the Privileges of the Elect. And so the Children of Ishmael,
or Esau, or any Nations of the World, in beholding this Grace in Christ as
displayed in the Gospel, may come in to believe, and therein to the service of
Christ that is now come forth of Jacob; and abiding in believing that electing
Grace, be through the belief of it, elected. And this the Apostle renders as
the proof of the Righteousness of God, and the Immutability of his Purpose,
Romans 9.5, 6, 11, 13, 14, 24, 25, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 10.1, 2, 3, 4
in taking the Gospel from the Children of Jacob, that heeded not this electing
Grace, but strove to attain by their works; and giving it (in a sort to the
Children of Esau) the Gentiles that in the Gospel-Call embraced it; and yet
affirms this cast-off Israel in returning to view and embrace the same, shall
also be again received. Romans 11.23
So that the Purpose of God remains firm, That his Purpose of all these good
things pertaining to Eternal Life shall stand, take place, come to pass, Romans
9.11 and 11.5, 6, 7
not according to Men's works, but) according to the Election of grace, is that
is heeded and takes place, and goes on in the Believers, as is shown in the
Cautions in the beginning of this Discourse of Purposes, and needs not be
repeated again.

And yet because of the stumbling of some, by some different Phrases and Terms,
in which these Purposes, and this Election of Grace is set forth; I shall a
little farther treat of them in another way, namely by considering that famous
place to which every Dissenter from us in this, resorts, to ground his Opinion
on in this business of the Purposes of God, in Romans 8.28, 29, 30. let us mind
what is there said.

CHAP. 6.
Of Romans 8.28.

ANd we know, Romans 8.28
that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
the called according to purpose. Verse 17, 18,
The Apostle had before intimated a certainty of the sufferings of those that
are the Sons of God by Faith; and yet comforting them with the greatness of the
Glory to be revealed, he also intimately admonishes them to patience of Hope,
from the consideration both of the expectation of the Creature (now subject to
vanity, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
till that glorious Day of the Manifestation of the Sons of God) whose
deliverance is earnestly expected and waited for; and also of the Adoption,
that is, the Redemption of the Body, together with the fullness or harvest of
the Spirit, then certainly expected, and till then to be waited for; yea, he
secretly stirs them up more abundantly to this patience of Hope, by the
Grace of God, in affording them an enjoyment of the first Fruits of the Spirit;
and to this also, opens the way of their safety and preservation, and the
certainty of it in that way, that is, by hope, even hope for that not yet seen
or enjoyed, but only patiently and confidently waited for: and because,
besides the afflictions befallen them, they are yet but weak: and though God be
a God hearing Prayers, 26, 27, 28
yet they know not how to pray as they ought; he comforts them with this, That
the Spirit they receive in belief of the Gospel, helps them, etc. and now
against all afflictions, oppositions and temptations he gives them this farther
great consolation, All things work together for good to them that long God. God
is good, and does good, and his tender mercies are over all his works; and they
work from him for good, Psalm. 1.4.5.8, 9 Romans 2.4 Job 33.13, 24
even to lead Men to Repentance; and so does his chastisements likewise. But to
them that believe not, and so love not God, Psa. 69.21, 25 and 109.2, 6 Romans
11.9
but return him hatred for love: those things work not so in them to the same
end; but that which was their welfare, turns to them into a snare. But to
them that love God, all things work together for good.

Let this be well heeded, That the Apostle does not say, Psalm. 109.4, 5
To all that God has loved or loves; for some that he has loved or loves,
have rewarded him hatred for his love. Nor does he say, To all for whom Christ
has died and offered himself a sacrifice; for some of these tread him under
foot, and deny him that bought them. Heb. 10.29 2 Pet. 2.1 Pro. 1.24 Jer. 6.16,
30 Heb. 4.1, 2 Mat. 22.16
Nor does he say to all, That by gracious means or Ministration of the Gospel,
he has called or calls; for some such rebelliously refuse; and many not
mixing the Word with Faith, are not yet chosen: much less does he say, To a
Company under a secret Purpose, the greatest number of whom cannot yet be
known. Nor does he say, That all things work together for good to any because
they love God, as if that were the deserving cause; which is but the way and
frame of the Heart, in which things so work: But he says, To them that love
God: and mark, that he speaks it not as a peculiar thing revealed to, and so
known by him, and some few; but as a thing learned, believed and known of all
that unfeignedly believe in Jesus: and we know, all we are assured of this,
That all things work together for good to them, etc. So that we have here to
note for this business, is a double or twofold Description of those that are
the Sons of God by Faith, to whom all things shall work together for good.

The first Description of the Sons and Heirs forementioned, is this, They are
Lovers of God. The second Description is this, Verse. 15, 16, 17
They are called according to Purpose. The words are plain, To them that love
God, who are the called according to purpose. In which words it is plain, That
none love God, but such as are called according to purpose; and that such as
are called according to purpose, do love God; and that the Apostle speaks
here, in Verse. 28.29, 30, etc. of none but such as love God, and are called
according to Purpose. Let these evident things be minded in these three Verses.

1. Those spoken of here, are such as do love God. Now every Man will be ready
to say, Pro. 20.6 and 26.23, 26 Gal. 6.3 1 John 3.18 Tit. 1.16. 1 John 2.4 Romans
11.35. 1 John 4.9, 10, 16, 19
He loves God: but Men's own saying so, is no proof of it; his own Heart is
deceitful, and his persuasion and profession no sufficient Testimony: for love
in conceit and tongue, when it is not in deed declaring it, is not love indeed:
nor is that love indeed, that we love God first, and so claim right in his
love; but that he loved us, and gave his Son to be the Propitiation for our
sins; and making that known, so as we believing it, do therefore love him
because he loved us first: and so this true love of God is, that love, 1. 1 John 4, 10, 16, 19 and 3.16 Tit. 3.4, 5 1 Pet. 1.8 Romans 5.5, 6
Which springs from the great love of God to Mankind, appearing in the gift
of his Son to be the Savior of the World, believed by us. 2. Which in this
springing flows upon and is set upon God in his way, Joh. 8.4^ Cant. 1.2 Joh.
14.7, 10 Romans 8.32 and 15.30 Ioh. 14.21, 23 Psa. 119.97, 155, 165 Psa. 26.8 and
27.4
that is, first on Jesus Christ the Son of God, whom he has given; and so
loves God for giving Christ; and so loves him in and through Christ, and so
loves the Spirit and whole Government of God that proceeds from him, and
therein the Word, and Doctrine, and Sayings of Christ, and so the Ordinances of
God in fellowship with his people, and so with entire affection and
delightfulness, the Brethren that believe in, and love the Lord Jesus Christ, 1
John 4.20, 21. and 5.1, 2. and with compassion to all those in that Nature in
which Christ died, 2 Cor. 5.14, 15, 19, 20 Psa. 119.127, 159, 167 1 John 2.4, 5
2 Timothy 4.8
and so purchased them with his Blood, though not yet corgregated them to
himself thereby; so, as though hating their evil ways, yet pitying them, and
desiring their Salvation, and endeavoring it: and in this love of God, and Men
for his sake, loving to walk in his Commandments, in exercise of Faith and
Love: and so loving the appearing and coming again of our Lord Jesus Christ. 3.
Gal. 5.6. Joh. 14 21, 23. 2 John 11
This love so springing and flowing, does work from the Faith and belief of the
goodness of God in Christ that brings it forth; and so Faith works through
Love. to the flying all evil, and doing good, according to his Commandments.
And this is the Love of God; and they that so love, are Lovers of God; and such
as so love God, are the Called according to Purpose, which is the next
Description of them.


2. To them who are the Called according to Purpose: mind this well; he says
not, To them whom God has or had purposed to call; or, And so according to his
Purpose has called: Ephesians. 1.11
nor can such meaning be foisted in or tolerated; for God works all things
according to the counsel of his own will, and does nothing beside or contrary
to his Purpose; Prove. 1.23, 24, 25, etc. Jer. 6.16.30 Hos. 11.3, 4, 7
and yet he has called and does call many that perish for refusing to turn at
his call: though some are of this mind, That it is those purposed to be
called: and so translate the words as nigh as they can, called of purpose: but
that cannot bear out that sense, because it crosses other places of Scripture
that says, He calls all; and, Isa. 45.22 Mat. 22.14
many are called and few are chosen; and yet he calls none that he purposed
not to call. But the words are plain, Them who are the called according to
purpose: Rev. 17.14
which indeed are none but the Lovers of God, that are called, and chosen, and
faithful; so that for right understanding the Words, we have three things here
to consider, what the Scripture will tell us of them, 1. What this Purpose of
God is, that is here meant. 2. What the Calling is, that is here meant. 3. What
that is meant here, by being called according to Purpose.


I. The Purpose of God here meant, appears in Scripture to be that Purpose of
God, which was for the good of fallen Mankind, consisting to our apprehension
in these four Branches.

1. That he purposed, Joh. 3.16, 17 1 John 3.5.8 and 4.9, 10. 1 Timothy 1.15 and
2.4, 5, 6
and so according to his purpose sent forth his only begotten Son in Man's
nature to make propitiation for our sins, and to be the Savior of the World,
that whoever believes in him might be saved. 2. That God in his Purpose
farther purposed to give forth such evidences of his goodness through his Son,
Pro. 1.22, 23 and 9.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Isa. 45.21, 22 and 55.1, 2, 3, 7
and so to set him forth and lift him up in means using, as thereby to call
Men, and strive with them by his Spirit, opening their eyes, and moving their
Hearts that they might believe, and so repent and come in to him and be saved,
and so to call all in their several Ages, according to the means he uses
toward them. 3. He in this Purpose yet farther purposed, Joh. 3.15, 16 Isa.
45.22 Romans 10.9, 10, 13
That whoever according to the means and light he extends to them, to make
known his Son and Grace through him, do hear and behold, and so believe in him,
they shall not perish, but have everlasting life. 4. He in his Purpose yet
farther purposed, That his Purpose should abide, Romans 9.11. and 11.4, 5, 6, 7
stand and take place in Men, for saving them, and investing them with
Privileges of Sons and eternal life, according to the prevalency and Election
of Grace displayed and believed, and not according to the workings of Men.
And in all these together, is the purpose of God, as has been before at large
showed and proved in the two former Chapters, with the Cautions third and
fourth in the second Chapter, and are here only contracted, to be easily
understood. Now God according to this his Purpose calls all Men, especially
where the Gospel comes, as has plentifully been proved. Let this be heeded.

II. For the Calling that is here meant, it appears by that which is said in
this Verse, Ephesians. 4.4
and which follows in the next, to be a through and double Call; for though the
Caller be one, and the Object discovered, and the Medium and Spirit therein, by
which he calls, be one; and the hope set before them, to which they are
called, be one; and in that respect the Call one: yet in respect of the persons
called, and that to which for the enjoyment of this hope they are called, the
Call is double, first and following, as appears,

1. The first or the beginning of the Call, is of sinners and unbelievers to
repent and believe the Gospel: Mar. 1.15 Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3 1 John 5.19 Mat. 9.13
Mar. 2.17 Luke 5 32 Act. 26.18
such are all men before he call them, even dead in trespasses and sins, under
wrath and the power of darkness, and the wicked one; and such as these are by
the Gospel called to repentance and believing in Christ, that so they may
receive forgiveness of sins, and life in Christ, to convert and renew a right
disposition in them; and so with this Call to this Repentance and Faith, Christ
calls sinners, and none but sinners, and as sinners: and such he sent forth
his servants in the Ministration of the Gospel, Isa. 55.5, 6, 7 and 52.15 Luke
24.46, 47, 48 Act. 13.8 Romans 10.8, 9, 10, 13
to call to this Repentance and Faith. And so it was fore-prophesied of him,
that by himself, and by his Spirit in his servants, he should call such; and by
himself affirmed that so it shall be: and such he himself did call in his
Ministration, and also by his Spirit in the Ministration of his Apostles, Mar.
1.14, 15. Act. 13.38, 47. and 14. etc. And in this Call there is discovered and
tendered to such sinners, mercy and forgiveness in Jesus Christ, and the
blessed hope of eternal Life to be had in their believing: and in this
discovery of Christ crucified for our sins, and risen for our justification,
etc. and of God's rich and free love, graciousness and righteousness
therethrough, Joh. 16.7, 8, 9, 10 Pro. 1.22, 23 Ioh. 6.27 Act. 2.37, 38, 39, 40
is discovered the sinfulness and helplesness that is in Men, the vanity of all
their wisdom, righteousness, strength, and of all Creatures to help them; and
so in reproving their evil ways, their wisdom, righteousness, pride and
designs, calls to turn at his reproof, and so to believe in him, that they may
receive from him remission of sins, wisdom, righteousness and life, which in
their turning he will assuredly give them.

Now some called thus, stumble at his reproof, and will not turn, Prove. 1.24,
25, 36 Ier. 6.16, 30 Ioh. 3.19 and 15.22, 24
to lay aside their own wisdom, designs, etc. and so refuse to hearken, and to
turn at his reproof; these, though called, come not at all. Joh. 5.40. some
others there are, that in his Call do begin to believe the Truth and Goodness
of the Gospel: to the operations whereof, if they did yield, and abide therein,
it would save them, and make them free: but they not abiding in and yielding to
the teachings of this Grace, they are not yet brought in truly to be his, and
live to him. Ioh. 8.31, 32, 36 2 These. 2.13, 14 1 Pet. 2. 2 Phil. 3.7, 8, 9
Romans 5.8, 10 Tit. 3.4, 5, 6 Ioh. 14.21, 23 1 Cor. 8.3 Gal. 4.8 2 Pet. 2.3, 5, 9.
Now both these sorts are called of God according to his Purpose; but neither
of them the called according to purpose, because not prevailed with by his
discovered and electing Grace, to yield up to the blood of sprinkling, to be
his and let all go for him, to win him and live to him. But some there have
been and are, that in hearing and beholding his free and great love to
Minkinde, discovered through the sufferings of Christ for sinners, and the
fullness of grace in him, are brought in to believe; and in believing, minding
of that grace, are so chosen and for his love, love him, and are also now loved
of him with love of well, pleasedness, and so known and approved of him, even
his elect and chosen; and these are the Called according to purpose. And so,
though the word Called be used in both senses, for them, that are prevailed
with, and sometimes for them that are not prevailed with; yet the word, The
Called, is used but in one sense, Romans 1.6, 7
for them that are prevailed with; and here, for those so prevailed with. But
when God has thus approved Believers, he farther calls them.

2. The following Call is of Believers, and Saints approved; and as Believers
and Saints, he calls them to service, even to conformity to Christ in
services of Love, and sufferings for his sake, and therein to patience,
meekness and waiting through suffering for the hope of glory.

Thus Christ called his fore-called Disciples, Mar. 9.7, 12 Luke 9. 1 Isa. 41.
2 Psa. 50.5 1 Timothy 1.11, 12 Gal. 1 Romans 1.1 Mat. 16.24 Ephesians. 5.1 Rev. 17.14 1
Pet. 2.3, 5, 9
and chose them, and sent them forth to such service: and thus God is said to
have raised up the righteous Man, and called him to his foot, (which is to such
service:) and so God calls his Saints that have made a Covenant with him by
Sacrifice. And so Paul being called and couated faithful, was then put in the
Ministry; and so being called to be a Believer, was then called to be an
Apostle. And so all Christ's Disciples were; and all unfeigned Believers still
are called to be followers of Christ in love, services and sufferings; yea,
these are to follow the Lamb wheresoever he goes, and to show forth his
praises.

And of this Call, Jude 1
Jude speaks to the Saints, whom he says were sanctified by God the Father,
that was in the first part or degree of the Call in giving them to Christ, and
preserved in Jesus Christ, there was their inward Sanctification and
Preservation through grace, in which he also approved them: and called, that
is, to services of love, through sufferings and oppositions. To which Jude
exhorts them, as the Apostle was here comforting and encouraging these
Believers in the same.

3. So then, to be called according to purpose, so as to be of the Called
according to purpose, Romans 3.9, 20, 25 and 5.8, 9 1 Timothy 1.15 Tit. 3.4 Phil.
3.7, 8, 9 Joh. 15.16, 19 1 These. 2.13, 14, 15, 16. 2 These. 2.13
appears to be thoroughly called with this double Call, or first and following
Call; and so to have been by the discovery of God's free grace in Christ to
sinners without difference, prevailed with to believe in Christ; and in that
believing, have been through the excellency and operation of that grace
believed, prevailed with to let all go for Christ, to enjoy him; and so severed
from their Union and Fellowship with the World, and their former vain
confidences and designs, and so chosen through the Sanctification of the Spirit
and Belief of the Truth, and set for love-services, though through sufferings.
These are the Lovers of God, and the Called according to purpose. And of these,
and only such as these, the Apostle speaks in this 28 v. and these only are
the Subjects of that he speaks in the two Verses following, which are the
reason, ground and proof that he gives to confirm the Truth of this he has
said v. 28. We know that all things work together for good to them that love
God, etc. for, or because: view the verses.

CHAP. 7.
Of Romans 8.29, 30.

FOr whom he did foreknow, Romans 8.29, 30
he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he
might be the firstborn among many brethren: moreover, whom he did predestinate
them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he
justified, them he also glorified. Let the words be minded: he says not here
or anywhere else, That there were a sort of people foreknown and elect of God,
and given to Christ to die for them: such a Saying would cross all the Doctrine
of the Gospel, and the very place it self; for if any were so elect, then
Christ could neither be the Root, nor Fountain, nor Pattern of Election; and so
in these respects, not the firstborn among many Brethren, as this place
affirms him to be. Nor does the Apostle here or any otherwhere say, That some
of Adam's Sons were predestinate to be eternally saved, and some to be
eternally damned, before the World was; and that Christ came to save the one
sort, and not the other: nor does he here paint out any of fallen Mankind
considered as sinners and unbelievers, to be foreknown of God, and thus
predestined by him: nor is it appearing anywhere in Scripture, That God has
foreknown or does know, own and approve any of the fallen Sons of Adam, that
live in unbelief, 1 Pet. 2.9 Romans 9.25, 26 Psalm. 101.4 and 5.4, 5
either before or in the beginning of the world or since, or any till they be
brought to believe in his Son; yea, to affirm such a thing, is to deny and
affirm cross to the whole Scripture, and no way agreeing with this place; which
brings in only the Lovers of God, that are the called according to purpose; as
those, and only those, who have been thus foreknown and predestined, and are
the only subjects of this Election and Predestination here spoken of: and so
the saying is brought in, to uphold and comfort such in the services of love
and sufferings, to which they are called: and that we may clearly understand
the sense, it will be profitable for us to mind according to
Scripture Language, what is meant,

1. By Foreknowing: 2. By Predestination: 3. By Calling: 4. By Justifying and
Glorifying: 5. What the end and scope of the Apostle here is: And 6. what the
way he takes to accomplish his end. In all which the sense appears fully.

1. Romans 8.29
By foreknowing is clear to be meant, fore-owning, approving, loving, and
taking well-pleasedness with: otherwise in our vulgar sense of the word
knowing, God foresaw and knew all things good and bad: Luke 13.27 Mat. 7.23
Psalm. 101.^ Psalm. 1.6
but in the Language the Scripture here speaks, the Lord does not, never did,
nor will know an unbeliever, hypocrite, and wicked Man: but he knows, that
is, upholdeth, approves, loves, accepts the way of the righteous: and so,
though God be full of compassion, and has given his Son that we might live
through him; yet is he well pleased with none, that having light and means in
any measure extended, do not accordingly believe in him and love him: such
however in love of compassion pitied and forborne, and still called on and
striven with to repent and believe; yet till they do so repent and believe, he
is displeased with them, Joh. 3.36 Psalm. 18.43 Isa. 55.5 Romans 9.25, 26 1 John
4.16, 19 1 Cor. 8.3
and they abide under wrath and displeasedness. And as they know not, that is,
do not own and love the Lord: so likewise they are not so known and owned of
him: and so, while they remain such, they are in this sense of approbation and
special love, not known, not his people, not beloved. But if any man through
the belief of God's love, do love God; that same is known of him: so the
Apostle brings it in as after their believing and turning from serving Idols
(when they knew not God, Gal. 4.9
nor were known of him) but now after ye have known God, or rather are known of
him; for known unto God (that is, approved of God, and well pleasing to him)
are all his works from the beginning of the World: Act. 15.18 Joh. 6.29. 1 Pet.
1.21 Romans 5.5, 8, 10
when he has made known his love through his Son, and so brought Men to
believe in his Son, and in that belief, shed abroad his love in their heart,
and so sprung up love to his Son, and to him, This is the work, and he
approves it, and loves and approves such Lovers of him. Act. 15.19 Joh.
14.21, 23 See chapter 10.
And this the Apostle affirms to prove it an evil work of any, to trouble
such in such Faith and love: and so our Savior affirms, He that loves me,
shall be loved of my Father; and I will love him, and will manifest my self
unto him: if any man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love
him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him. So that these Lovers
of God, as they are the called according to purpose; So they are the elect and
owned, known and approved of God, even all of them, and no other but them, as
is plain and evident in the Scripture.

As for the word foreknown; or, as some translate, has foreknown; or, as
others, knew before: This word before does no whit obscure the sense that is
given, or cross any thing said: for if Men would take before, Joh. 3.16 Romans
9.8, 11. and 11.5, 6, 7 Ephesians. 1.11
as relating to the purpose of God mentioned verse. 28. then it could be no
other then his provision to own such lovers of him according to his order, for
his purpose, standing and taking place for saving Men, as is foreshewn; which
will run into one with that said and to be said. But it is clear, the word
fore, or before knew, has not relation to the persons spoken of in verse. 28.
as considered before or otherwise then as they were lovers of God, and the
Called according to purpose: and so considered as Lovers of God, and the Called
according to purpose, it has relation to them, with an especial relation to
that which follows, namely, predestined, and called, and justified, and
glorified; such foreknown lovers of God, being the subjects of this
predestination, call, etc. and this writ for the consolation and support of
such. And this will clearly appear in the words and scope of the Apostle, and
in all other Scripture: and so,

2. To see what is meant by predestination here, I shall note three things: 1.
Who they are that God has thus predestined. 2. What that is to which they
are predestined. 3. To what end he has predestined them to the same. In
all which together it is clear, The great design of God is the glorifying his
Son, that his Son may also glorify him: and so, Joh. 5.20, 22, 23 and 17.1
Col. 1.15, 17, 18, 19
that as in the counsels, and so in these works of God, he may have the
pre-eminence as the firstborn, first lover of God, first elect, predestinate,
etc. And so, if any would pry into the secret of the counsel of God, the most
and fullest revelation thereof, that is, since the ascension of Christ, in this
matter, is this, that God chose his own Son, Psa. 40.6 Luke 24.26 Isa. 42.1
Part 4. chapter 3. Isa. 50.4, 5, 6 Phil. 2.7, 8, 9 Isa. 50.7, 8, 9 Mat. 17.5
and appointed him to suffer and offer sacrifice, and through suffering to
enter into glory; and so he predestined him the first elect to be both his
Servant and Son, to do the great business as is foreshewed. And in due time God
called and sent him forth to this great work, and he shrunk not back, but most
readily obeyed and did it: and God did justify him, and has glorified him in
Man's Nature at his right hand. And so has God according to his purpose
elected and predestined him, Heb. 8.1 and 12.2 Romans 5.18. 1 John 4.14 Joh.
1.12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 1 Cor. 1.30 Ephesians. 2.5, 6 Phil. 2.10, 11
and called, and justified and glorified him; and so has set him forth as the
second public Man, by and in whom propitiation is made, and provision also for
all Men, that they might be saved; he is the Savior of the World; and such
fullness and compleatness for acceptance of Believers in him, and communicating
his Son-like Privileges to them, that all that unfeignedly believe in him, he
and his Privileges are theirs; and so they reckned after him, and so in him
are they elect, predestinate, called, justified, glorified: he is the head of
the Church, the firstborn among many Brethren; yea, he is so chosen and
exalted, that all shall confess him Lord, and he shall judge all, even those
that have rebelled against him; so that no particular or individual person was
elect in Christ before the World began, much less before him. But in that very
election of the Man Christ, such provision was made, that in purpose, all this
spiritual species or kind of Men believing in him, were foreknown, approved
and elect in Christ; but none elect in their particular persons, till by grace
they believed in Christ; and yet in respect of him and his election, they may
be truly said to be elect in him before the Foundation of the World. And this
might be understood by the Scripture Language in contrary things; Ezekiel. 23.1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 19
as to Israel of old it is said, There were two Women the Daughters of one
Mother, they committed whoredoms in Egypt in their youth; there were their
breasts pressed, there they bruised the teats of their Virginity; their names
Aholah the elder, that is, Samaria; and Aholibah her sister, that is,
Jerusalem: Aholah played the Harlot first, and Aholibah afterward. Now in
Egypt it was but one Woman; all Moses time, when they were come out of Egypt,
it was still one Woman; all Joshua's time, that led them into Canaan, and the
time of the Elders that outlived him, it was still one; and all the time of
the Judges from Othniel to Samuel, it was still one; and all the Reign of Saul,
and David, and Solomon, it was but one Woman still: in Rehoboam's time,
Jeroboam with the ten Tribes, made the rent, 2 Chronicles. 15.2, 4
and then they became two Women, two Churches, two Nations, two Kingdoms. And
this Aholah went a whoring a long time first or before the other; and
afterward, the other sister also: yet now being charged with the sin of their
whoredoms, it is for the time of their beginning of whoredoms, not reckoned
according to the Branches sinning only, what they did when divided; but it is
reckoned upon the account of the several Branches for the time of the beginning
of their sinning, Ezekiel. 20.8
from the root, when in their Mother they went a whoring in Egypt: and this is
understandable enough; and yet heerer, can we understand how a Man in
murdering his Brother or a Saint, does therein approve of Cain's murdering
Abel; 1 John 3.12 Jude 11 Mat. 23.35 Romans 5.12, 18, 19
and so makes himself guilty of Cain's sin in killing his Brother? And can we
understand a Man by propagation from Adam, born a sinner, that his sin is as
old as from Adam's fall? and may not a Believer as easily understand of those
by a new Birth come in to the spiritual Man, that he that yesterday was brought
in to Jesus, and so believing in him, is through the Sanctification of the
Spirit, and the belief of the Truth, united to him, and so chosen and approved
in him, is now in him, and reckoned after him the spiritual Man, the prime
elect, and so partaketh of that election that was his, and of, and in him for
all Believers before the World began? and so, as the grace and righteousness in
him, even so election, etc. when we by Faith receive it, is become ours, and
this grace and righteousness, and so election, which we receive in receiving
Christ, is for the antientness and the beginning of that grace and
righteousness, not reckoned according to the time of our receipt, 2 Pet. 1.20,
21 2 Timothy 2.9, 10 Joh. 1.12. 1 Cor. 1.30
but of the being and compleatness of it in Christ; we partaking of no other
Sonship, Election, Righteousness or justification, but what is his, and was in
him for us before we knew him; and now knowing him, he communicates to us his
own Privileges. In which sense, he that in his own person was but yesterday
chosen out of the world, in and into Christ, may be truly said to be chosen in
Christ before the foundation of the World. And this is a full and plain sense,
not crossing, but agreeing with the place, and the residue of the Scriptures,
to satisfy those that desire to look into the inmost of the mystery.

Yet still agreeing with the same, the sense is more plainly opened in the
words, those three things in them propounded considered with this premise, That
the whole sentence be taken according to its own import of two things performed
in it, that is to say, first, as a Description of the predestinate, with that
whereto they are predestinate, and for what end: secondly, a propounding of
examples to them, of such Saints as have gone before and finished their course;
and so according to both these, let the words be minded.

First, I shall consider those three things as the Description of the
Predestination.

1. Who they are that God has thus predestined? enough is said already to
show they are not any of Adam's Sons as fallen in him, and naturally come forth
from him, as so remaining, and so beheld: but only such as are foreknown and
fore-owned of God, which are only the Called according to purpose, 1 Cor. 8.3
Gal. 4.6, 9 Joh. 15.16 Act. 9.15, 16. and 10.41, 42. 1 Timothy 1.11, 12 and 2.7
that through the grace and love of God in Christ believed, do love God: all
these, and none but these, are known of God: these all, and only these elect,
owned and approved: God does, having first or fore-owned them in that very
election and owning of them, appoint, ordain and predestinate them to this
conformity.

2. That is both intimately hinted what not to, or expressly affirmed to what
intimately showed; that it is not to make propitiation for sins, and to offer
the acceptable sacrifice, etc. for according to purpose Christ only was to do
and has done that, and God has commended his love to Man-ward through him:
nor is it to be called as sinners to repentance, and to believe in Christ; and
in believing to receive remission of sins past, and so to be framed to love
God, and by Faith to be the Sons of God, and in that Faith in him, to have the
beginnings of eternal life; All which in some good measure they have already,
being Lovers of God, and called according to purpose, and so known and approved
of God before this predestinating them: but that which they as Sons are
predestined unto, is something in which Christ as the prime Son is set forth
as a pattern to them; and so it is expressly said, They are predestined to be
conformed to the Image of his Son; which must needs be, to that likeness of him
in which he is set before us for a pattern and example to conform to; and that
may be comprehended in these three Branches, as the Scripture plentifully and
plainly shows.

I. 1 Pet. 2.5, 9 Ephesians. 2.10 Romans 7.4, 5 Joh. 15.16, 19 1 Timothy 1.11, 12 and 2.7.
2 Timothy 1.11 Act. 10.41, 42
In services of love, in declaring his Name, and showing forth his praises and
virtues in word and conversation: to this end were they created in him to good
works, that they should walk in them; yea, to this end, their marrying and
uniting to Christ, that they should serve in newness of Spirit; so Christ in
choosing ordains to go and bring forth fruit: so Paul when counted faithful was
put in the Ministry, and so ordained a Preacher and an Apostle; Ephesians. 1.4 Phil.
2.15, 16 Ephesians. 5.1, 2. Joh. 13.15, 34, 35 and 15.12
yea, all his chosen Witnesses, and specially his Apostles, were predestined
to the Adoption of Children by Jesus Christ in their Ministration, and all
Believers commanded to hold forth the word of life, etc. and so to be Followers
of God as dear Children, and to walk in love as Christ has loved us; who tells
us he has given us an example, and bids us so to do. To this they are
predestined.

II. In bearing the cross of Christ in this their service, 1 These. 3.3, 4
in patient acceptance and indurance of such afflictions as they meet with for
the Name of Christ, and as God is pleased to try and exercise them withal. And
this the Apostle speaks of, Mat. 20.23 and 10.22. 1 Pet. 4.12 and 1.6, 7 Act.
14.22 2 Timothy 3.12 Heb. 12.6
as a known thing among Believers, which he had taught them also; speaking of
afflictions he says, For your selves know, that we are appointed thereunto.
And Christ told his Disciples, That they should indeed drink of his cup, and be
baptized with his baptism. Whence Peter admonishes not to count the fiery
trial strange, as if some strange thing happened to us. And the Apostle puts it
in as of necessity, We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of
God. And Paul puts it down not only as necessary, but general, All that will
live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution: and God scourges every
Son whom he receives. To this they are predestined.

Through these sufferings to be conformed to the Image of Christ in this life,
in spiritual virtues, in meekness, patience, submission to the will of God,
experiments of divine power, in fortitude, constancy, etc. and after this life,
in glory and reigning; that as it was appointed him through sufferings to be
made perfect and to enter into his glory; so it is by the same divine
appointment. that Believers follow him in the same way to enter rest and glory:
whence that is closed in with our Sonship and being Heirs; If so be that we
suffer with him that we may be glorified together; if we be dead, we shall also
live with him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with him: whence those
callings to rejoice when such sufferings befall us. And the predestination is
principally to the way, means and orderly leading to the purposed end: and this
that to which God's chosen are predestined.

3. The end for which he has thus predestined those he has owned as
unfeigned Believers and lovers of him, to be thus conformed to the Image of his
Son, that is express, That he (his Son Christ) might be the first born among
many Brethren. Plain it is. Col. 1.18. Prove. 8.22, etc. Col. 1.17, 15 Col. 1.18
Act. 17.31 Mat. 2.18 Ier. 31.16, 17
That this great design of God in this predestination of the Believers to such
conformity to him, still to advance and glorify his Son, that in all things he
may have the pre-eminence: he was and is without controversy in himself the
firstborn and before all things; yea he is also the firstborn of every
creature; so, as they were made by him: he is also the firstborn from the
dead, and so the object of Faith for all Men. And more I might say in respect
of those dying in infancy: but in this it is, that he might be the firstborn
among many brethren, even those chosen and predestined to conformity to him
in such services and sufferings, to pass therethrough to glory; Heb. 12.23 Col.
1.18 Ephesians. 1.21, 23 Ioh. 17.1
whence so believing on him, they are called the Congregation of the first
born, as he is also the Head of the Church, all whose excellency and happiness
is in being still more conformed to him, in that in which for a pattern he is
set forth to them; in which, as he is glorified, so God is glorified in and by
him: so that predestination here cannot be a predestination of Men to be saved,
for whom Christ should die and suffer to save them; for he then should not be
the firstborn in such a predestination, scarce so the first in order: but here
he is the first, in the choice predestination, call, justification and
glorification, and so in the whole pattern above all in excellency: and they,

First, believing and chosen in him, and then predestined to be conformed to
him, that therein he may be the chief and firstborn among many Brethren. And
so we have the meaning in the Apostle's Description.

Secondly, Let all these things in the words be considered as the Apostle here
proposes to the Believers, according to his wonted manner, the examples of
such as had gone before them in the Faith, to comfort and encourage them to
service and suffering, and through sufferings to wait for glory: in which
examples he also sets forth Christ as the chief, to behold and conform to: they
when chosen were predestined, and then called to it and also justified and
glorified; and there is no change in God; we may be sure, believing in him, 1 Timothy 1.16
he will even so deal in the same manner with us; they are patterns for us that
believe. And so the Apostle giving a definition of Faith, and a description of
it, and the mavelous effects of it in the whole Chapter, Heb. 11.1. verse. 13.2
sets forth a Catalogue of the great things done and suffered; and their
victory and certainty of the promises encourages them, having such a cloud of
witnesses, Heb. 12.1, 2
to lay aside every etc. and to run with patience the race set before them;
(but above all) looking to Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith who, etc.
and so likewise James, Take, Jam. 5.10, 11.
my Brethren, the Prophets, etc. for an example of suffering afflection, and of
patience; behold, we count them happy which endure: ye have heard of the
patience of Job, and ye have seen the end of the Lord. 1 Pet. 2.5
So that, as the purpose and promise of the Lord is, They that trust in him
shall not be confounded; so these examples of his dealing with his beloved
Ones, Psalm. 9.10 and 34.22 Psalm. 22.4, 5
is as a cord let down from Heaven to draw and hold us to trust in him at all
times; yea, this exercise of Faith the Spirit leads Believers to, and upholds
and fills them with pleas in greatest distresses: and that the Apostle
propounds examples here of such as have finished their course, appears, in that
the whole here said, in 29, and 30 verses in the preterfect Tense, not a word
of that doing or to be done, but all done, Has predestined, called,
justified, glorified: and thus taken, the whole business is yet more plain. And
so I proceed,

3. To show what the Calling is that is here meant, that foresaid has done it
already: It is not the Call of unbelievers and sinners to repent and believe;
for Christ was never so called: and though in that Call Believers are brought
in to him, yet it is a following work of grace to conform to him: so that the
Call here, is the Call of those that are Believers, to such services and
suffering, and imitation of Christ in both, as that both in the Call and the
services of love and suffering, they are conformed to him, as is already shown.

Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them also he called. Romans 8.30
There has not been any of those that have been called according to purpose,
and loved God, and were approved of him; but as he has predestined them, so
also moreover and besides, he has called them forth to these services and
sufferings, and so to conformity with Christ therein: and he is the same God
still, and keeps the same course still with all Believers and Lovers of him:
yet may we be confident and rejoice in him in all; for,

4. Whom he called, them also he justified. The Justification here meant, Romans
4.5 and 3.25
is farther then simply a Justification of the ungodly believing in Christ, and
so receiving remission of sins past, even such a Justification, as in which the
justified are conformed to Christ in his justification; and what that was, is
express in the place of the Prophet, Isa. 50.7, 8, 9 Isa. 43.2 Neh. 13.14. Heb.
11.4 2 Cor. 8.12 and 6.8 Rev. 12.11. Psalm. 44.17, 18 Romans 8.36, 37 Isa. 41.9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 37, 40
to which the Apostle alludes in this Chapter: which Justification includes in
it Help and Assistance in all services and sufferings, even when they pass
through fire and water, that they shall not be overthrown or harmed; and
however condemned and defamed by Men, yet he will accept and justify their
services and sufferings and approve of, and justify them believing in him,
when and while they are exercised in these services and sufferings; yea, he
give them victory, so as they shall overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and the
word of their Testimony; yea, he has always done this to his Saints he called
hereto, he has justified them; and not only so, but,

Whom he justified, Joh. 17.1. Heb. 12.2 Psalm. 44.17, 18, etc. Isa. 52.2 Rev.
14.13 and 6.9, 10, 11. 2 Cor. 5.8 Phil. 1.23 and 3.20
them he also glorified. He has glorified his Son in the Nature of Man, that
suffered and finished the work he gave him to do; so, as he is glorified at his
right hand: he has glorified the Saints that followed him, with the glory of
victory, their Bodies at rest in hope, and their Spirits with the Lord,
enjoying glorious rejoicing in the sight of his glorified body, and happiness
in his presence, with infallible assurance of having their glory completed on
Soul and Body at his coming in the Resurrection of the Just: and so has he
done to all his Saints before, and so will do still and for ever.

And thus by this Romans 8.28, 29.30. we are led to understand the Purposes of
God to be even such and the same that have been set forth in this fourth Part
of the Treatise: if we consider in the whole three Verses, the next two things
forenamed, it more appears, that is,

5. What the end and scope of the Apostle here is; and that appears plainly, 1.
Chapter 7.4, 7 and 8.1, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14
To stir them up to abide firm in the Faith, and to mind the things of the
Spirit, and walk after the Spirit in love-services. 2. Verse. 17, 18, 23, 24
To comfort and support them in the afflictions that came upon them while they
walked after the Spirit in the Faith that works by love, and so encourage
them to patience and constancy in the enduring of their afflictions,
persevering in faith and love; yea, even, 3. To lead them to triumphing
confidence in Christ, and the great love of God in delivering him for us, and
making him known to us, Verse. 35, 39
that they might confidently rejoice and glory in the midst of all their
sufferings; and to help them in these, was the Apostle's end and not to lead
their thoughts to conceit a certain company of Adam's Sons, as such beheld,
decreed to be eternally saved, and the rest to be eternally damned; and few of
either sort known: no word in his writing to such an end; yea, the puzzelling
the thoughts with such a conceit, would be cross to his end, which was to
edify in Faith, Love and Love-services, with consolation in sufferings.


6. For the way the Apostle takes to accomplish his end, Chapter 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
16. and 3.22, 25, 28. and 4.5, 24, 25. and 5 6, 11, 12, 18. and 6, and 7.
it is clear to be. That as he had before declared the Foundation and the
Medium of coming to and on it, and so being united with it, and accepted
through it, and exhorted to suitable walking; so here he proceeds to help them
to sound consolation in afflictions, 1. By showing who are the true Sons of
God, V. 14, 15, 16, 28.
and Heirs with Christ, unfeigned Believers, even them that love God, and are
the Called according to purpose. 2. V. 14, 15, 17, 18, 29, 30
By showing them the way of God's dealing with all his called Ones, whom he
approved as his Sons and Lovers of him: he ordains them to conformity to the
Image of his Son in services and sufferings; and in that way to glory, and
calling them thereto, does justify, and will glorify; so that in all this,
God is on their side, and for their good. 3. He also minds them of the
privileges of the Son of God, V. 14, 17, 18, 29, 30.
the prime elect, predestinate, called, and justified, and glorified; the way
through which he has gone, and will bring them to the enjoyment of his own
privileges through the same way. 4. Romans 4.6, 21, 22, 23. and 8.14, 18, 29,
30, 31.
He minds them of the examples of those lovers of God that were of the Called
according to purpose, how they being approved, were even thus predestinate, and
called, and justified, and glorified; and having finished their course so
happily, are set forth as patterns and examples, to instruct and encourage us,
that we in the same way may, following his Call, expect the same justification
and glorification; God being ever the same, of one mind. 5. Directing them
especially and above all to mind Jesus, and the greatness of God's love in
delivering him up for us all, V. 32, 33, 34, etc.
and the special and choice communication of his love, in making known and so
giving his Son to us, that believing in him, he is surely ours, he that died
and so satisfied for our sin; yea rather, is risen, and so our Righteousness,
and filled with Spirit in our Nature, ever living to intercede, to take away
our sins by virtue of his blood, and to communicate of his Spirit to us. Now
God in giving us him, will with him, and so in and through him, certainly give
us all things freely; and in receiving and abiding in him, we shall receive. Oh
inestimable love! who shall separate us from this love etc?


Thus does he lead them to triumphing confidence, without any the least denying
or eclipsing the great love of God to Mankind, Tit. 3.4, 5, 6, 7. 2 Timothy 2.9,
10
or shutting the door to, or darkning the light of life and immortality opened
and brought to light by the Gospel, or working the weakest Believer with
thoughts of secret purposes; yea, so he holds forth the Love, Grace, and Mind
of God in the whole business, as is fit to draw in unbelievers to believe, and
the weakest Believer to come in believing into that number. And so the Purposes
of God are one and the same, agreeing with the whole Gospel preached by him. As
for Objections against it, they are most answered already in former Sayings,
and answer of some of Mr. Owens Expressions: See part 1. c. 11.
and yet to remove that, which if let alone, may occasion some to stumble, I
shall consider in this, one more Expression of Mr. Owen's.

CHAP. 8.
A Consideration of the Purpose of God, as expressed by Mr. Owen, page 168.

GOd's Eternal Purpose of saving some, Mr. Owen.
in and by the Mediation of Christ; that Mediation being interposed between the
Purpose of God, and the accomplishment of the things purposed: by the Fruits of
the one, the Mediator cause of the other. This act of his will the Scripture
knows by no other Name then that of Election, Adoption, or the Purpose of God
according to Election or the purpose of his will in Christ Jesus.

Thus far Mr. Owen: and I shall desire to acknowledge all the Truth I can find
in his Sayings, and by Scripture to remove the rest. He says, God's Eternal
Purpose of saving some in and by the Mediation of Christ, etc. Saving some, he
expresses not what some, or of what kind the some is: if it be meant of his
fallen Creatures, it is acknowledged so far true; for both Angels and Mankind
was fallen, and he purposed no way of saving for the fallen Angels: there is no
contest about that: but if by some be meant some of Mankind, and no way to
discriminate them, that it may be known who, then is there no door to life
opened for any man to come in at; nor Gospel that can be preached as Truth to
and for them while unbelievers, to bring them in to believe. If any conceit it
is some elect Ones, that cannot be; for it is meant of all them, no gainsaying.
But his Expressions elsewhere show it to be meant of Mankind, Some of them:
for as for any elect in Christ before Adam's fall, to be fallen in his fall, is
but a humane device and tradition, nothing in the Testimony of Christ for it,
but all against it; or, That there are any elect Ones in Christ, that according
as they are elected, are not also begun to be saved, and so far holy and
beloved, is another humane device and tradition, without, and beside, and
contrary to the Scripture, as has been plainly shown. So that of necessity by
the word some, (as by other Expressions he would be understood) is meant some
of all Mankind fallen: but then what some shall we conceive? for all Mankind
were once made righteous, and so beheld and loved in one public Man, who was
both Male and Female; so that all Mankind was alike righteous, and alike loved
as righteous, in this one public Man then: but this first public Man, both
Male and Female sinned, and so fell under sin and death and all Mankind in
him, and must needs have perished in that sin and death they were fallen under,
if God had not provided a Savior to interpose.

Now was not all Mankind, alike fallen, alike viewed, and alike under the same
danger; or were there any more individuals come forth to make a some of; or had
any, any other ways sinned and fallen under sin and death then in this public
Man? and what then shall the some be? the Male or the Female the Soul or the
Body, or some part of either? Such whimsies are in the dreams of some; but sure
we are far from them: I wish we may use no Expressions to strengthen them. But
then, did not God find out a Mediator for the first public Man, whole Adam as
fallen, to take away sin, destroy death, and the works of the Devil, which was
already entered into the world? and did not this Mediator interpose and
undertake in that very moment of the Fall, to be a second public Man, to take
the Nature, the Place, the Cause of the first public Man in hand, to work a
restoration for him and so for all that were in him, and naturally to come
forth from him, even all Mankind? where then shall we find the some of them?
if there were any left out for whom there was no purpose of God for any saving
them in and by the Mediation of Christ, why do they not perish in that first
death denounced? why are they not at last judged, according to that Law under
which they fell in Adam? why do they not in dying die, so as to have every
thing filling them with horror and torment, till they perish for ever in the
first death in the utmost of it? How comes Mercy, Patience, and Means to lead
to Repentance, to be extended to them, if no ransom has been given for them,
God being not only merciful but righteous in all his ways? if Christ did not
die, and give himself a ransom for them; if he have wrought no Salvation for
them, and so have none to bestow on them, how is he become their Lord? Why is
the Gospel to be preached to them? why are their sins aggravated by the means
he uses toward them? and how shall they be said to reward him hatred for
love, and be judged by him according to the Gospel, and sentenced unto a second
death, which if he had not come and used means toward them and they rebelled
against him, they could never have been? or did God first purpose in and
through Christ, this second death to them that were already under the first
death, and no Redemption wrought for them; and so send Christ into the world to
be an Abaddon or Man-Destroyer, to condemn so great a part of Mankind farther
then they were condemned in Adam? I will proceed no further in this.

The Gospel and the Purposes of God, as by his word and works declared, and as
set forth in this Treatise tells us another story, which takes away all these
absurdities brought in by this some: and yet neither does he express it of what
saving he means, whether of that Salvation of the Nature of Man wrought in
himself as the public Man, for Men, all Men, or of that Salvation upon the
account of the former extended to Men to save them, or of the efficacy of the
first in the extention of the second, on the same account in Believers and
Receivers, which is opened in the Gospel, and expressed according to it in this
Treatise; but some Expressions elsewhere used, imply to mean it of all: so that
this term some, is not rightly used.

Yet this is true, That he says God's Purpose of saving was in and by the
Mediation of Christ; yea, his saving in every respect, only this glory to God
in Christ, that he is the first purposed and first elected, and all following
Purpose of Salvation is in and by him. And so this also, That the coming of
Jesus Christ, and the Salvation wrought by him, and Preparation made in him, is
a Fruit of the Love, Will and Purpose of God, is true: and the extending of
this Salvation in any or all the Fruits thereof, to Men, and the Efficacies
thereof, in Men, are the Fruits of the Mediation of Christ, and so of the same
Will and Purpose of God in and through the Mediation of Christ: this is true
also.

But that this act of his Will, (whether he mean it of his Purpose of preparing
Salvation for Men in Christ, or of extending Salvation to Men through the
Mediation of Christ, or of the Efficacy of this Salvation in Believers; for he
leaves this in the dark) That the Scripture knows it by no other Name, then
that of Election, Adoption, or the Purpose of God according to Election, or the
Purpose of his Will in Jesus Christ, is a dark saying and full of confusion,
and intimately untrue, unless he deny it to be called by all these Names; and
then there is subtilty, and room left for evasion in the Expression. Let it be
considered, The Will of God in his Purpose is in it self an act, sure one
single real act, before any accomplishment come forth: and if he mean of that,
it will not reach some of the other terms; and if he mean of that act which is
outward toward the Creature, which is confessed the act of his Will, and always
suitable and according to his Purpose; he says not of which he means: but
take it for either or for both; yet there is confusion in his saying, as if
there were no distinction between Election and Adoption, and the Purpose of God
according to Election, and the Purpose of his Will in Christ; and that all or
any of these were and are equally and alike, the Name of this Purpose of his
Will, in his Purpose of saving Men, in and by the Mediation of Christ. True it
is, It may and does bear the Name of the Purpose of his Will in Christ: and the
Scripture will bear it out to be known by that Name; the Eternal Purpose, Ephesians.
3.11. and 1.9, 11. Psalm. 2.7. 2 Timothy 1.9.
which he purposed in Christ Jesus, which he had purposed in himself, the
Purpose of him that works all things according to the counsel of his own
will; yea, it is called, The Decree, (preached by Christ, and to be preached by
his Servants;) yea, and for the good Will of God and Grace given us in this
Decree, it is called, His own Purpose and Grace given us in Christ Jesus before
the World began. And if Mr. Owen had but added his Purpose of electing and
adopting in and by Christ, and his Purpose, that all should take place
according to the Election of Grace, the Scripture would have borne it out. But
for Election without distinction, to be that Purpose, or the Name of that
Purpose, or that act of his Will, that is called his Purpose of saving fallen
Mankind by the Mediation of Christ, no one place of Scripture says, it
speaking of the Oracles and Works of God in this business, Romans 9.11.
says, They were so ordered, that the purpose of God according to election
might stand. Where by standing is meant, abiding, taking effect, and coming to
pass, to have its being in that purposed; which is the constant and plain
signification of the word stand, whenever used about the Purpose, Counsel and
Word of the Lord Psa. 33.10, 11. Pro. 19.21. Isa. 14.24. Jer. 44.28
. And it is not here said, That the Purpose of God in or upon the Elect might
stand: but, according to Election. So that Election, or the Grace of God in
Christ the Elect, discovered and believed, (which believed, electeth;) and so
its the Grace of Election, or the Election of Grace, or, which Grace believed,
makes; opposed to the works of Men by the Law Romans 6.23, 24, 33. and 11.5, 6,
7.
: This that by which the Purpose of God in Christ for communicating the choice
salvation shall stand, become efficacious and take effect in any: whence those
by grace so prevailed with, are affirmed to be the Called according to Purpose,
because Counsel had so ordered it, to take place in the Efficacy of his
appearing Grace Romans 8.28. 2 Timothy 1.9, 10. Tit. 3.4, 5, 6, 7.
: and this Election of Grace, where it so prevails, is thereby known 1 These.
1.1, 3, 4, 5, 6. 2 These. 2.13, 14.
; and so said to be, according to the Foreknowledge of God the Father, which is
no other but the counsel of his Will in his Purpose, approving and appointing
this Way for his Purpose to stand and take effect, and be accomplished Ephesians.
1.11. Romans 9.11. and 11.5, 6
, through the sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling of
the Blood of Christ 1 Pet. 1.2.
: which is to say it in more words, Through the Demonstration of his Grace in
Christ (the prime elect) in the Gospel-Declaration and Call, the Word believed
working effectually in them 2 These. 2.14. 1 These. 2.13.
, and so chosen to Salvation through the sanctification of the Spirit and
belief of the Truth 2 These. 2.13.
. So that all the way, Election in Purpose or Act, is a distinct thing from
Purpose: yet the act of the Purpose not divided from it, but it is the manner
of its taking place, and coming into act; and election is the Name of it self,
being the manner of the blessed coming forth of the Purpose, and not the Name
of the Purpose: nor is the Purpose named the Purpose according to Election, and
there the period; but some good thing to be brought to pass: it is said to be so
spoken, That the Purpose of God according to Election might stand, or take
place. All which is cleared by plain Sayings of Scripture, set down often
before; to which I might add, Romans 11.25, 29. Deuteronomy. 7.6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
that which the Apostle desired Believers not to be ignorant of, concerning the
natural Branches, the Seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and those few that
were chosen for the love God bare to, and the Covenant he made with their
Fathers; of whose natural Seed remaining in unbelief, he tells the Gentiles,
As concerning the Gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: Romans 11.28.
but as touching election, they are beloved for the Father's sake.

Now what is here meant by Election, is that, Romans 11.25.
in which is the mystery there mentioned; and it is evident, that it cannot be
the election of the very individual persons that were then Enemies to the
Gospel for the sake of the Gentiles, 1 These. 1.13. 2 These. 2.13, 14.
because the very fastening and prevalency of election is in and through the
belief and prizing of the Gospel, and Grace by it discovered, and the stumbling
at Christ, (as now discovered in the Gospel) though because of Gentiles or any
receiving him, and accepted, caused their ejection, and was the evident
Testimony, that such were not elected, but blinded, etc. And the Apostle
divides these unbelieving Ones from the Elect and calls them the rest, that is
none of them: Romans 15.7, 8 9, 10, 11. Romans 11.7 8, 10, 15, 17, 19, 20.
but says expressly, These are blinded, hardened, east off and that because of
unbelief: so as according to the Doctrine of Election delivered, not by God,
but by Men not acquainted with his Mind, there would be no love of God to
them, no possibility for such reprobated Ones to come into favor with God
again: which the Apostle affirms there is still; Romans 11.16, 23.
And that God's dealing with them in such a heavy and severe way, is a Fruit of
his love toward them, and has its tendency, that they might be brought in
again. Romans 11.11, 14. Act. 13.45, 47, 52. 1 These. 2.16.
And this is rendered as the ground of all that though their envy and sin be
grievous, that they are enemies to the Gospel for the Gentiles sake, and wrath
be come upon them, and they rejected; yet as touching the Election, (or for the
Election) they are beloved for the Father's sakes. A great mystery; a people
not elected, but cast off for stumbling at the Gospel, and yet as touching
Election, beloved for the sake of others. What shall we think then Election
here to be? though it may stand with the Purpose of God for their Salvation in
his way, according to the Election of Grace, to stand, even the Election here
meant; yet it cannot stand with an infallible Purpose of God, in which their
persons were elected to be eternally saved, against all interposures and
oppositions; for then they were as well beloved for their own sakes, as for
their Father's sakes, and should not have so been broken off: but what this
Election is. I conceive may appear in the very terms used, compared with other
places of Scripture, to be the Election of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and so
for their sakes the Election of their Children, the beloved Father's, whose
natural seed these were; and so for their sakes still beloved with love of pity
and compassion, and means still extended to recall them; yea, their abasement
and casting off, to humble them and so as a means ordered thereto: and all for
their sakes, the Elect with whom the Covenant was made 1 Chronicles. 16.13, 29 Psa.
105.5, 14 and 135.13, 14.
; or rather especially for Christ his sake, that was in them, and to come, and
is now come forth of them Romans 9.5. Psa. 89.19, 34. with Deuteronomy. 7.6, 7, 8. Isa.
41.8, 9 Romans 11.23. Romans 11.25, 26, 27, 29.
: and so whoever of these abide not in unbelief, shall be grasted in again; for
God (has not so tied himself with any decree, but he) is able to graft them in
again; and though thousands stand out till Judgment have scattered and broken
them, yet shall there be a preservation of that natural Seed; and in due time
the whole company of them then surviving, shall be brought in and so all Israel
shall be saved. And is God's gracious Election of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, so
forcible; and is not the Election of Christ, (now having come in the flesh) in
the Nature of Man, and the love and well-pleasedness God has in him, as
prevalent for all that are in and of that Nature he took, and died, and rose
in; and so of the kind of Man, for whom he gave himself a ransom; 1 Timothy 2.5,
6.
and in which Nature he is now mediating between God and Man, as prevalent with
God for all Mankind living on earth, (as election of Abraham, Isaac. etc. for
their natural Seed) now he has sent forth his Son the Savior of the World,
for his sake, the prime, elect to love with pity and compassion, all those of
Mankind, so as to extend means to those that yet live in unbelief and
rebellion, to bring them to Repentance and Faith, that they might so come up in
to Christ; Romans 11.12, 15, 30, 31, 32, 33.
and in their coming in by the means he uses, and viewing his electing Grace,
accept them through, unite and ingraft them into his elect Son, and so into the
number of his Elect; and though thousands stand out and rebel yet when his
indignation has passed on all the World, those that are left alive at his
coming, shall then be brought in, and Israel and Gentiles become one, and all
saved as God's elect and chosen. Oh the depth of the Riches, etc! Gentiles once
shut up under unbelief and now Jews, and yet his end in all this. That he might
have mercy on all. See through the Chapter how the Apostle has opened
Election, which as it stands firm with the Purposes of God expressed in
Scripture, so it gives good ground to love and pity all Men, to pray for them,
and use means for their conversion; which the Purpose as expressed by Mr. Owen,
and confounding Purpose with Election as undistinct, overturneth. And as for
Adoption, I marvel that term should be brought as the Name of the Purpose first
mentioned: as for Election, I conceive there are none elected, but they are in
electing, as much adopted as elected: for though Man may in his thoughts choose
and elect one to be his Son and Heir, whom he may yet not so adopt and make his
Son and Heir, according to his first thoughts, Genesis 15.2, 3.
as it fell out with Abraham; yet is it not so with God, for any that receive
his electing Grace: and yet there may be a distinction between election and
choice of one to Sonship and Adoption, in this free and electing Grace making
one a Son. But these run so together, I desire no farther to search into the
distinction: but this I find in Scripture, and believe, That God has but one
natural Son that is, his only and first-begotten Son, even the Word, that was
made flesh, and so the Nature of Man taken by him into personal Union, is by
the Grace of personal Union the same Son of God: Gal. 3.26 Luke 21.46. Rom
8.23. 1 John 3.2.
nor other Sonship for any other Man do I find, but in Union with him and so
none on Earth the Sons of God but by Faith in him, nor they fully and
completely till the Resurrection of the Just in seeing him as he is. And this I
also find, That the means appointed of God in his Word for Dispensation and
receiving the Grace of Adopition, is even therefore called Adoption, Romans 3.2.
and 9.4, 5.
and so the Adoption was said to pertain to the Israelites while the Word and
Oracles was with them; and those predestined to the Ministration of Christ in
the Gospel, are said to be predestined to the Adoption of Children by Jesus
Christ: Ephesians. 1.5.
and those that in believing receive the Gospel, and so the Spirit of Faith
therein, Romans 8.15. Gal. 4.5, 7.
are said to receive the Spirit of Adoption.

More might, but more need not be said to clear this, That though both Election
and Adoption be things purposed of God in Christ, yet they are distinct in the
counsel of his will; and though wrought according to his Purpose, yet they bear
not the Name of the Purpose, but of things wrought according to his Purpose in
the counsel of his Will. So that this Description of the Purpose of God by Mr.
Owen, is not right, nor according to the approved Rule confessed by himself, See
par. 1. c. 7.
being not Scripture-like, and so not fit to build any Opinion on, as those in
Scripture set forth are: but enough of this.

Yet before I leave it, it is needful to remove two mistakes of many about the
Purpose of God; the one is the making the Purpose of Salvation or Election the
Foundation to build Believers on: the other is the making that the Purpose of
God, which is no Purpose of his at all.

CHAP. 9.
An Answer to those that say, God's eternal Purpose of Salvation and Election,
is the Foundation on which Believers that are safe, are built.

THe Gospel discovering the Purposes of God, will enable such as believe it to
discern things that differ; and so, that the wisdom and love of God found out,
and in his Purpose appointed, and in performance has given and laid in Sion,
to be by Sion held forth, Jesus Christ, for a Foundation, Isa. 28.16. 1 Pet.
2.3, 4, 5, 6, 9.
both for Repentance and Faith, and for Believers to rest, and be built and
safe on: and that Election is that Work of Grace, in which, such as believe on
him, are united to him, and approved in him, as his peculiar and elect: so that
neither Purpose nor Election are the Foundation laid, and declared as the first
thing to be seen, known, believed and rested on; But Jesus Christ is according
to Purpose, this Foundation; Act. 4.12. 1 Cor. 3.11.
yea, and expressly affirmed; there is no other Foundation for any or that any
Man can lay; yet have some Master Builders not so magnified this, but give out,
That the Purpose and Election of God is the sure Foundation, bringing the 2 Timothy 2.19. as so speaking, which it does not; but runs (in affirming Christ the
Foundation) with the rest of the Scripture: for the Apostle had in that Chapter
before exhorted Timothy to mind that which is the Foundation indeed, Christ
raised from the dead; 2 Timothy 2.8.
and given him encouragement from his own example of receiving such Grace,
Strength, and Hope of eternal Life in believing on him, as to be enabled to go
through with his Ministration, and endure all sufferings for the Elect's sakes,
as also to bring in unbelievers to believe; even so that Believers, the elect
Ones, might be preserved, established and grow in Faith. And this no needless
work, but that they also may obtain the Salvation that is in Jesus Christ with
eternal Glory; and so provoking and pressing Timothy, Romans 15.20. 2 These. 3.1,
2, 8. 2 Timothy 2.9, 10.
to diligence in his Ministration, though through the same sufferings; in which
there is so great hope not only for themselves, but for others also, he
professes this to be a faithful saying, (open, plain, true and certain, in
which God will ever be found faithful in his Testimony of Christ, and Christ
faithful in performance of the same, 2 Timothy 2.11.
) If we be dead with him: he says not, If we were dead for him to die for us,
or as dead in his dying for us, having in his sufferings, 2 Cor. 5.14, 19, 20,
21.
as in the public Man, suffered the sentence of death in account, for all we
fell into by Adam; that as he is risen, we might live to him: which is true
also of such as yet believe not; But he says, Romans 6.2, 11. and 7.4. Col.
2.20. Phil. 3.3, 7, 8. Romans 6.4, 5, 8, 11 and 7.4, 5, 6 Joh. 11.25, 26. 2 Timothy
2.12. Romans 8.17, 18.
If we be dead with him, that is, believing in his death, in his Blood; and in
acceptance of that, die to our own Wisdom, sinful lusts and designs, and to all
hope in any righteousness of our own; and so to all the appearing glory, ease,
pleas, and excellency of this World, and all by and with him, which is to be
dead with him in Scripture Language. If we be dead, (note it, he says not he)
we shall also live with him; receive forgiveness, be enlived, preserved, and
raised with and by him; yea more still, If we in this believing, dying and
living, do suffer with him, and so for his and his peoples sakes, we shall
reign (with him at his coming:) but when such glorious grace is discovered and
tendered to us by so gracious a One, as has suffered so much for us, and has
gone before us, and calls us to follow him, and yet we refuse; If we deny
him, he will deny us. This is as plain as all the rest.

If any say, He cannot; for this his death will be in vain, his call frustrate,
and his word become of none effect: This has been answered before, That his
death, his word has its effect, and his Purpose shall verily be performed,
according as he purposed, that is, for life, according to the Election of
grace; and though these deniers of him bring upon themselves swift destruction,
2 Pet. 2.1. Romans 9.6, 8. Isa. 65.11, 15. Joh. 12.48. Romans 2.16. Prove. 9.12.
Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. 2 Timothy 2.13.
others shall be brought in, and the effect of his word shall be seen in those
that are born of the promise; as was said, The Lord shall slay thee, and call
his Servants by another Name: nor shall his death and Ministration of the
Gospel be in vain; he will have the glory of all, in judging them by it
according to the Gospel; and not he, but they alone shall suffer and bear it;
and will have his glory of being by virtue of his death, their Lord; and so it
follows, If we believe not, yet he abides faithful, (faithful in all his
promises and sayings; yea, in this affirmed and faithful saying, and so
faithful in and according to the manner of his Purpose) he cannot (he neither
will nor can, it suits not with his Nature, it is impossible he should) deny
himself: he says not, He cannot deny us, though we believe not, and deny him;
for if that were so, he must deny himself in his own sayings, concerning
unbelievers, Apostates and Deniers of him, and in his faithfulness for bringing
forth his Father's and his own Purposes, according to his Purpose ordered in
his Counsel, and breathed forth by his Spirit: but he cannot deny himself, he
will make good his own word, and show himself to be even the same his Spirit
has in the Gospel reported him to be, denying none, that by his grace in the
Day of grace, believe in him, or having departed, do again in his recalling,
turn to him; but denying such as persist in refusing, or after coming in, in
departure and denial of him, in which is both warning and comfort; and so a
great motive to hold them in the Faith that were in it, and to return them that
were gone astray from it. 2 Timothy 2.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
And therefore he wills Timothy to put them in remembrance of these things,
etc. and urges it, because some were departed from the Faith; assuring him,
that notwithstanding all this, the Foundation of God stands sure, in which we
may see not only the Purpose of God, but the Foundation laid according
thereto, and the sure standing of it, to be such as abides with the Truth of
all these foresayings and events; yet it is meet to answer that conceited
strong Argument against this hereto said, which is Mr. Owen's saying thus:
Though the seed of Christ, Page 132.3.
which he is to see to upon the account of his sufferings for them, do sin and
trangress; yet God has put all these gracious Obligations upon himself to
reduce them by corrections and afflictions, but never to proceed to final
sentence of utter rejection, Isa. 53.10.

Answ. This is nowhere affirmed in Scripture, and so propounded, as is doubtful
what his meaning is, if other sayings did not explain it; as where he says,
Page 364.
The same sins deserve the same punishment; and had not Christ answered for the
sins of Believers, they could not have escaped punishment. (And if he had said,
nor raised from the dead; it is as true: but that any perish for sin, because
Christ did not suffer for them; is not true: nor is God any respecter of
persons, if the manner of sinning be the same though) he also says, Page 161.
and 63.2.
The guilt of sin is also taken away from all those for whom Christ died by his
death, that it shall never be a cause of everlasting separation between God and
them: which has been plentifully shown to be contrary to the Scripture:
besides, the taking sin out of the way by his death is one work; 2 Cor. 5.21.
Ephesians. 5.25, 26, 27. 1 John 1.1, 7.
and the taking the guilt of sin, etc. from Men, another following work: the
first done, where the later is not done; and the first done, that by virtue of
that by which it was done, the later might in his way be done: and it is a
great perverting of the Scripture, to render that done, where it says it is to
be done: of which enough has been said; but his Expression here being more
moderate, I will so view it; for) here he says not, All that Christ died for,
but his Seed: By the Seed of Christ, See par. 1. chapter 13. and par. 4. chapter 2.
is not meant any of the Sons of Adam considered as he was to die, and had
undertaken it, and did die for them; for so they were Men fallen, Adam's Seed,
and sinners and enemies to God, which the Seed of Christ are nowhere called:
but they come in upon the account of his Death, Resurrection and Sacrifice
completed, and Spirit sent forth in the means prevailing with them. And this
express by the Prophet, taught by our Savior, and so the Children of the
Promise, Isa. 53.8, 10, 11. Joh. 12.23, 24. Romans 9.25, 26, 8.
those that were born of the promise, (that were not before in that sense his
beloved People, as now they are) are counted for the Seed; and so let us count
as God counts; that is the best and safest for us. Now this Seed he says
Christ is to see to upon the account of his sufferings; if by see he means a
Seed to see to, he speaks short: for it is upon the account of his suffering,
Resurrection, sacrifice, fullness of Spirit and means using, and God's
glorifying him and bearing witness of him, by which, in that gracious donation,
they are in their times drawn in to him, Isa. 53.10, 11. and 55 4, 5. 1 Pet.
1.20, 21.
and so made his Seed. If by see, he mean see to, or look to, to preserve, etc.
he is in that short too: for that is not only upon the account of all before
said, but also in an especial manner upon the account of the Father's enabling
them in the Testimony of Christ, to discern Christ and believe on him; and so
giving them to him in the heavenly call, Joh. 6.40.45, 47. and 10.27, 28, 29.
and 17.2, 6, 7, 8. Heb. 9.15. and 7.25.
causing them to hear and follow him, and so on the account of his Mediation of
the New Testament for the Called by virtue of his Oblation: and for these who
only are the Seed of Christ indeed. If it were granted to Mr. Owen (though in
his words they cannot be) though they do sin and transgress, yet God has put
all these gracious Obligations upon himself, to reduce them by corrections and
afflictions, but never to proceed to final sentence of utter rejection. If
this, I say, were granted, yet it makes nothing for his other Sayings mentioned
here, nor against any thing here said in and upon the 2 Timothy 2.8, to the 19
verse. for it is before proved, Par. 4. chapter 5.
That many may believe the promise displaied in the Testimony of Christ, that
are not yet born of the ^romise, and so are not of this Seed; and yet
continuing in that believing shall become to be born of the Promise, and so be
counted of the Seed: but by departing may never come to be of it, and so be
utterly rejected; for whom all this faithful Saying and Warning is needful and
profitable, both for Teachers to mind them of, and for them to heed and mind.

But let us to the Testimony, with his Saying: the place most probable it might
be wrested from, is Psalm. 89.28, 33. consider it both in Type and in Truth: and
first, in Type: The Covenant was with David, and stood fast with him, for him
and his Seed, so far as he would, though chastning his Seed for their
Transgression, yet not take his Mercy from him as he did from Saul, 1 King.
1.11, 12, 13. and 15.4, 5
that he should have no Son to sit upon his Throne; which Covenant is yet firm
to David, and a first Fruits of the performance related: yet what is befallen
many of David's Children, as well as of Israel and Judah, the Word and Works of
God, declare and show; yet is not his Covenant broken, nor his Mercy taken from
David.

But now for the Truth it self, which is Christ the Son of David, and the
choice David; Certain it is, The Covenant in the full extent of it, stands fast
with him; his Seed will God make to endure for ever, and his Throne as the
Days of Heaven. I will not press this here, That this is a thing to come, the
whole Seed and such a manner of Seed is not yet come in, and presented before
him, as shall be when he comes to take to him his great Power and Reign, Ephesians.
5.25, 26, 27.
and sit upon the Throne of David his Father. He is now in his Mediation,
sending forth Spirit in the Testimony of him, preparing Believers that they may
be such a Seed, as in whom the new Birth is completed. But lecting this pass,
to speak of them only in whom the new Birth is begun: and of them mark what he
says, If his Children for sake my Law, etc. then will I visit, etc. their
iniquity with stripes: nevertheless, my loving kindness will not I utterly take
from him. Mind the words, for I will not press the change of the terms, nor
deny that in what follows, (his Seed shall endure for ever) his Children are
meant, Romans 9.^. and 8.16, 17. (...) 3.8, 16, 26, 29.
as if Christ (his Seed) were the term fit to set them forth when completed;
and till they come to that, they are counted for the Seed, the Children of God
by Faith, and the Seed of Abraham begot by the Gospel given Abraham to
minister; yet not in their own persons, fully, actually (...) of God till the
Resurrection. But mind what he says of these Children now; he says not, I
will not take my Mercy utterly from any of them: but, My Covenant shall stand
fast with him, I will not take my mercy utterly from him, etc. which can be no
less then My love, mercy, faithfulness and Covenant shall not fail to be in,
to, upon and through him; so as I will be propitious and continue
loving kindness to all his Children, all that believe in him, and love him:
yea, if they go astray, I will correct them to reduce them; and in receiving
correction, my mercy and loving kindness in him, shall be ever upon and through
him, to receive them again, etc. but if they refuse, etc. yet I will preserve
and multiply a seed to him, I will not fail him. And if we mind it, such is
our Savior's complaint for the peoples untowardness, Isa. 44.4, 5, 6, 10.
and rejoicing in God's kindeness according to this Covenant, like that in the
Type: so that here is great mercy and comfort held forth for all Believers, and
encouragement for backsliders to receive correction and return, and a motive to
wait for the coming of Christ to sit on the Throne of David, when all iniquity
will be done away, and this Covenant given and performed to all the Seed of
Christ. And though neither this place, nor Isa. 53.10. quoted by Mr. Owen,
bears out his Notion, yet I desire the greatest comfort and hope it gives,
should be believed to the utmost of believing; but not that it should be abused
according to fleshly reasoning, Romans 11.20, 21, 22.
or Satanical Temptation, to puff up Believers with pride or presumption, to
say or conceit, Though we transgress, etc. we are God's Sons; he cannot cast us
off and reject us utterly, but he must alter his Purpose, break his Covenant,
etc. (which he cannot do) and so they fall into that foolish confidence. Peov.
14.16.
The Devil himself may tempt a Man to such confidence; yea, he did so tempt
(though he could not fasten his Temptation on) the Lord himself: If thou be the
Son of God, if thou be sure of that, (as if he should say, then the Promise
belongs to thee: and he mentions one as full and free, as this or any we read
of) then cast thy self, etc. for it is written, Mat. 4.6. with Psalm. 91.11, 12.
he shall give his Angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall
bear thee up. etc. as if he should say, If thou be his Son, God has absolutely
engaged himself for thy safety, and thou can not mis-carry. But he subtly
left out the middle clause, in which was the Order of the Purpose and Promise,
to keep thee in all thy ways: too near which fault they come, who asserting
Believers kept by the power of God unto Salvation, citing the Text, 1 Pet. 1.5.
leave out the middle clause, the way in which he keeps them, that is, through
Faith: but our Savior minded the Promise as it was, and depended on his Father
in his way, and resisted the Devil with, It is written, Thou shall not tempt
the Lord thy God: so am I by that which is written led to refuse this notion,
and to embrace for Truth all that is said, 2 Timothy 2.8, 11, 12, 13. according to
all which the Apostle also directs Timothy concerning others, and bids him,
Charge them before the Lord, 2 Timothy 2.14.
That they strive not about words to no profit, (as all invention of Purposes,
or of Election, or of any terms or Allegories, which are not in, Gal. 1.6, 7,
8. 2 Cor. 11.3, 4, 5.
or are beside the Gospel delivered by Christ and his Apostles, are) but to the
subverting of the hearers, (amazing and troubling their minds, into wavering
and doubting of the Truth.) And so he charge Timothy himself, 2 Timothy 2.15.
Rev. 19.10. 1 Cor. 2.2, 3. Luke 24.47. 2 Cor. 5.14, 19. Joh. 3.14, 17. 2 Timothy
1.11. and 2.11, 12, 13. and 3.16, 17.
Study to show thy self approved unto God, a workman that needs not to be
ashamed, rightly dividing the word of Truth, (which is the Testimony of Christ
and him crucified, and Repentance and Remission of sins in his Name. Surely,
this is the Foundation,) and the right dividing it, is, with that form of sound
Words (which in the Gospel he had heard of Paul) in Faith and Love. And this
applying according to the faithful saying here mentioned, to every one
instruction, reproof, comfort, or terror, as need was; for which the Scripture
did furnish him: and then he farther warns Timothy to shun profane and vain
bablings, as all their Fables and fancied Allegories, 2 Timothy 2.16.
foolish and vain Queries, and opposition of Science falsely so called, are,
which Peter prosessed was not in his preaching: 2 Timothy 2.18, 23. 1 Timothy 9.20. 2
Pet. 1.16. 2 Timothy 2.16 and 3.13. 2 Timothy 2.17.
and here is a reason given, For they (such bablings, and they that use them)
will increase unto more ungodliness, and their word will cat as does a canker
or gangrene, (and so he names some of them) of whom is Hymene us and Philet us,
who concerning the truth (was not this the Testimony of Christ, the Object and
Foundation of Faith?) have erred, (yea, departed and blasphemed, or spoken
reproachfully of it, as is the use of such as turn the Truth into Allegories,
counting the plain Testimony of the Truth it self, but a fleshly thing; and the
knowledge and belief of it, but a fleshly knowledge and Faith; but their
Allegory a spiritual business, 1 Timothy 1.19, 20. with 2 Timothy 2.1^.
as appears in their) saying, The resurrection is past already, (which could be
no other then in some dreaming Allegorical Resurrection they pretended to have
obtained; which so took with the hears, that thereby they) have overthrown the
Faith of some. So that we have three here that were sometime of great note and
eminency in the Church, Hymeneus, Alexander, and Philetus, that putting away a
good conscience, had made shipwreck of Faith themselves, and two of them at
least excommunicated; yet by their corrupt teaching and vain babbling, they did
also overthrow the Faith of some others. And in the first Epistle, he warned
Timothy by the fall of these, to look to his own standing. And in this Epistle
he warns him by the same to look to others: and against all the discouragements
that might befall him from the departure of such eminent ones, and others also,
turned from the Faith by them, tells them, The Foundation of God stands sure,
etc. which is evident to be such a Foundation as bears forth the Truth of all
the former faithful Sayings, as he and all Believers are brought to and know,
and by abiding on may be fafe. And this is no other but Jesus Christ. And he
being so often and plainly affirmed the Foundation, and that there is no other
given unto Men, it may be marvelled why so many Worthies should upon this place
say, That God's Eternal Purpose and Election is the sure Foundation. Let the
Words be viewed, to see if they import any such thing.

CHAP. 10.
A view of 2 Timothy 2.19. to see what is there meant by The Foundation.

NEvertheless, 2 Timothy 2.19.
the foundation of God stands sure (or steady) having this seal, The Lord
knows them that are his: and let every one that names the Name of Christ
depart from iniquity.

Nevertheless: Notwithstanding those that turned their eye from Truth, slighted
the Foundation, aspired in a Dream, 2 Cor. 11.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15.
defiled their Conscience, and so cast away Faith; and others in listening to
them, as Evah did to the Serpent; and so not heeding to the Truth, or cleaving
to the Foundation, are overthrown, weakened in, or broken off from the Faith;
yet notwithstanding all this, the Foundation of God stands sure.

Now the chief business for me in this, is to demonstrate what is here meant by
The Foundation of God; and though other places of Scripture have fully and
plainly told us already, yet we may mind what this place says, in observing
three things: What the Apostles scope was: What was in his view: What the words
and terms, with their several Branches and Distinctions, are. In all which it
appears what the Foundation is, and that it is Jesus Christ as set forth in the
Gospel: consider it well.

1. The scope of the Apostle appears in this and the following Chapter, to be,
to stir up Timothy (and so others) to faithfulness and diligence in the
Ministration of the Gospel, 2 Timothy 2.1, 2, 3, 14, 15 and 4.2 and 2.8, 16, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26 Jude 21, 22, 23.
to be strong in the Grace of Christ for it, and instant and fervent in it: and
for this end, to endure hardness, and avoid such things as might hinder him; to
fly youthful lusts, vain bablings, unlearned questions, etc. and to mind
Christ risen from the dead; that so he might with tender love and compassion,
endeavor the preservation and edification of those which did believe, and the
recovery of such as were departed and taken in the snare of the Devil; some
with compassion, some with fear, all with meekness: and to encourage him in all
this, he tells him, The Foundation of God stands sure, Isa. 4.2. and 32.1, 2.
and 55.1, 7. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15, 19, 20, 21. Tit. 3.2, 3, 4, 5.
etc. as a known thing to rely on and to hold forth to others, as that which
is always the same, and is not impaired by our transgressions, but has enough
in it to uphold us with desires and endeavors for such as are turned aside;
and to allure them, if they will hear and mind it, to turn in again. And what
can this be, other then Jesus Christ as he is set forth in the Gospel, having
made peace by his Blood, and the love of God to Man-ward commended through him?
Surely, the belief and telling of an eternal Purpose of God to save some
certain persons of fallen Mankind, having elected them; and to damn all the
residue, having reprobated them, and the most of both sorts unknown; and the
one sort, however for the present it be with them, shall be eternally saved;
and the other sort shall never attain any saving Faith; and what seeming soever
they have, it shall be taken away: and the Purpose and Election of the one sort
to be the Foundation that stands sure: Surely, this can produce no such
effects to encourage to such diligence in Ministration, or to help any by it;
Seeing if this be true, it could be no otherwise with any, then it is come to
pass; yea, if this Doctrine be believed and minded for Truth, it will naturally
of it self produce other Fruits: for both Scripture and rightly-ordered-Reason
will lead us to conform to the will of God, to rest well pleased with it; yea,
pray that it may be done in Earth as in Heaven. And why then should any be
grieved for such as God in his Will and Purpose has absolutely excluded life,
and reprobated to damnation, that they pesist in unbelief; or if at any time
believing, depart from the Faith, and become reprobate, seeing nothing is done,
but God's will; and no remedy to have it any better? Psa. 58.10. and 107.40,
41. Isa. 66.23, 24. Rev. 13.14, 17.
Surely, when any through their own fault are in that remediless state of
perishing, the righteous are said to see it and rejoice. And why should any
murmur against God, and repine at the fulfilling of his will according to his
Purposes, or stir to pray, or use means to assay to cross or hinder the same; 1 Samuel 3.18. 2 Samuel 15.25, 26.
but rather submit with quietness to it, as in other cases some have done? so
that such a thought would have made Timothy quiet and sit still, and not to
trouble himself with desires, prayers, and preaching to such an end. But the
Apostle, that had experience what the knowledge and Faith of Jesus Christ, Romans
5.5, 8, 10. 1 Timothy 1.15. Romans 1.14, 15, 16.
and God's love appearing through him to Man-ward, would effect; what a sure
and fruitful Foundation Christ was, how it reconciled him to God, how it moved
him to count himself a debtor to all Men, and to pity them, 2 Cor. 5.11, 14,
15, 19, 20. Romans 9.1, 2, 3. and 10.1, 2, 3, 4. and 11.4, 14. 1 Cor. 9.19, 20
and adventure his life to bring in Men to believe; yea, to desire and
endeavor earnestly the return and Salvation of Israel, those rejecting and
cast-off Brethren: whereas had he had in his heart that opinion and thought
before mentioned, he could not have so done. But he had in his heart a better
thought, even the Testimony of Jesus Christ; and that did so lead him: and
therefore he lays the same before Timothy, even so to lead him; yea, I suppose
any unprejuced will in reading Paul's Doctrine and Writings, and his scope here
to Timothy, confess, that it was Christ according to the Testimony of Christ,
that he propounded and laid before Timothy, as the Foundation to encourage him,
and not a hidden and secret Purpose in respect of Particulars.

2. This still farther appears by that which the Apostle had in his view, and
which he suggested to Timothy, 1 Timothy 1.19, 20. 2 Timothy 2.14, 16, 23. 2 Pet.
2.18, 19. Jude 16.
as that which threatened some danger; to which he opposes, Nevertheless the
foundation, etc. which is clear to be, the blasphemy of those that had made
shipwreck of Faith in their words tending to no profit, but to the subversion
of the Hearers; their profane and vain bablings, tending to increase unto more
ungodliness; their foolish and unlearned questions, their great swelling words
promising liberty: perverting the Gospel, and giving out, as if Jesus that was
born of the Virgin Mary, and died, and was buried, and rose, and ascended in
that Body into Heaven, etc. were but a fleshly Christ, and the knowledge of and
Faith in him, as having died for us, and being risen, and at the right hand of
God interceding, etc. a fleshly and literal knowledge and faith; and the
looking and waiting for his personal coming again, and the Resurrection of the
dead Bodies, a vain hope, keeping to the Letter, and under Bondage: But their
devised allegorical Christ that is dead and risen in them, is the true
spiritual Christ; and the embracing and believing this, being dead to the
former confidence in Christ; this Christ, according to the Spirit, is come to
them, and in them, and they are risen, Heb. 13.8. 1 Pet. 1.24, 25.
the Resurrection is past, etc. O lofty, O vain Dream! How should any that have
once believed in, and professed Jesus Christ, and the Resurrection from the
dead, be drawn to this? Is not Christ always the same, The Word of the Lord
that endures for ever? Yes surely: but these, like the fallen Angels, were not
content with their place, Jude 6. Col. 2.18. 2 Cor. 11.3, 4, 13, 14, 15. Gal.
1.6, 7, 8. 2 Timothy 2.18. 1 Cor. 15.3, 4. Isa. 40.8, 9. 1 Pet. 19.25. Heb. 13.7,
8.
in the light and knowledge afforded them in the simplicity of Christ as set
forth in the Gospel, but would be intruding into things not seen, and so
pervert the Gospel; as if they would declare a more spiritual Jesus, a more
pure Spirit, and more heavenly and spiritual Gospel, and truer Resurrection
then the (Letter, as they call it, of the) Gospel does declare: and so they
have erred and departed from the Truth; which if they had minded, and abiden
in, would have preserved them from such error. Nevertheless, The Word of the
Lord, the Lord Jesus Christ, as set forth in the Gospel for the Foundation,
stands sure, abides and remains for ever the same: though they boast of
such a glorious change from Christ in the Flesh, to Christ in the Spirit; from
Letter, to Mystery; yet he is the same, and had they abode in belief of that
Truth, they had not so erred. Wherefore let none believe or admire their
fancies; for, though they be changed in their thoughts of Christ and the Truth,
yet he is the same; and whosoever holds to and continues in his Words, he will
preserve: for though they have erred from the Truth, Joh. 12.47, 48. 2 These.
1.10.
yet nevertheless the Truth stands firm, and will one Day judge these
Apostates, and justify such as believe in him. So that by this opposition it
clearly appears he means Christ to be the Foundation.

3. This also appears in the Words themselves, with their Order and several
Branches and Distinctions; let them be every one considered:

1. Isa. 28.16, Psa. 18.22. Mat. 21.4. 1 Pet. 2.6 Act. 4.11, 12. 1 Cor. 3.11.
The Foundation of God stands sure. Is not this plain in Scripture Language,
to be the Foundation God purposed and promised to lay in Sion? which Purpose
and Promise was before the laying of it; and now, according to Purpose and
Promise, he has laid it: and Jesus Christ expressly affirmed to be this
Foundation, the Love and Wisdom of God in his will found out and purposed this
Foundation; and according to his Purpose, his Hand has laid this Foundation,
and has declared his Purpose of saving all that in believing are by Faith
built on him, who only is the Foundation, and there is no other. The knowledge
of this Foundation, and so of the Love and Purpose of God according to which he
is laid, meet us with bands of Love, to draw to him, and fasten upon him; or if
declined to return to him, that is so sure, immovable and precious a
Foundation. And this cleer-here that none needed have imagined another, nor
feigned the Purpose to be the Foundation: but to proceed,

2. Having this seal. This is plain, This Foundation has a Seal on it, an
evident and known Seal; it is a sealed Foundation; and so the Seal is distinct,
though not divided from the Foundation; it is in it and upon it, even that by
which it is marked out to be known, and to be sure and steadfast, even that
which God has appointed and sealed: in which Seal also is the sealing and
approbation of all that through believing come to be built on him. So that it
is a demonstrating, living, quickening and confirming Seal, and so Christ (the
Foundation) was sealed, approved, testified and confirmed, both by voice and
works, to be The Christ, Isa. 28.16. Mat. 3.17. and 17.5. Joh. 5.37. Joh. 6.27.
Isa. 55.4. 1 Cor. 2.2. Isa. 42.4. Romans 8.28. and 8.2. Isa. 28.16. and 8.16 and
51.4. 2 Cor. 1.22. and 5.14 Ephesians. 1.13. Isa. 2.3.4. Mic. 4.2, 3 Isa. 8.20, 14,
15, 16. and 28.9, 16. and 29.11, 12. and 42.21. and 49.6. and 13.47. Mat. 5.14,
15. Phil. 2.15, 16. Joh. 1.4, 7, 9. and 5.35. Isa. 44.26. Heb. 2.3, 4.
The Son of God, that precious tried Stone laid for a Foundation: and upon this
ground he exhorts to seek of him the Bread that endures to Eternal Life,
which he will give to such as come to him for it, because or for him has God
the Father fealed; yea, he being given as the VVitness or Testimony of God's
Will, Love, Purpose and Faithfulness, and so preached by the Apostles: and for
the Law, which the Apostle calls, The Law of Faith, The Law of the Spirit of
Life; This the Foundation laid in Sion, The Law and Testimony bound and sealed
up, among the Disciples of Christ, The Law proceeding out of his Mouth; and he
does therewith, so seal those that believe in him, that he indues them with his
own Spirit operating in them: so that the same Law and Testimony goes forth
from them to others. And this is the Law and the Testimony to which we are to
resort for the knowledge of all Truth; though because of its crying down all
flesh, and the reproach it is in, in the World, and among the Children of the
Bondwoman in the Church, it is to them as a book pretended by the Learned to
be sealed, and by the unlearned to be out of their ability to read; yet with
Christ, and in him the Lord is well pleased; yea, and for his sake with all
that believe in him, and will magnify the Law and make it honorable; yea, he
has given him for a light to the Gentiles, and to be his Salvation to the ends
of the earth; yea, he will confirm and has confirmed the same, in making those
that believe in him, the light of the World, in holding forth the Word of
Life, and bearing witness of him the true light, and he will confirm the
Testimony delivered by his Servants; yea, he has abundantly confirmed this
Testimony already; Ephesians. 2.20, 21, 22.
so that Jesus Christ as set forth in the Testimony of the Gospel, he is the
Foundation laid by God, and ministerially by the Apostles, even that Foundation
on which the Apostles and Prophets, yea, the whole Church both of Jews and
Gentiles, are built; and by whom as the Cornerstone they are united in one:
and there is no other Foundation but this. And this Foundation is sealed, and
has the Seal on it, which will be sealing all that come to be built on it: so
that hitherto, even by this Word, having this Seal, We are led to own Jesus
Christ for the Foundation, on which the Seal abides. Now let us consider what
this Seal is; and that also is express,

3. That Lord knows them that are his. This is plain, the Apostle delivers
not this, (the Lord knows them that are his) as the Foundation (which by his
manner of delivery appears, to be some distinct thing forelayed, yea, even
before sealed) but distinctly, plainly and expressly, as the Seal on the
Foundation, which it always has on and with it; and that is this, The Lord
knows them that are his. View the words in their own simplicity according to
Gospel-Language, and it will appear plainly, That, The Lord is the Name
frequently throughout the Gospel, as now come forth, given to Christ Act. 2.36.
and 10.36. and 9.17, 29. and 11.16. and 16.31. and 20.35. Romans 14.9. 1 Cor. 1,
2. and 8.6. 2 Cor. 1, 2. and 13.14. Gal. 1.3. and 6.18, etc.
; but if any will take it for God the Father, it will come to the same: for the
Father and the Son are both one and the same God Joh. 2.1, 2:
: one in divine Essence, and in Will and Design, and in Testimony and Working
Joh. 10.29, 30. 1 John 5.7. Joh. 5.17.19, 22, 23. and 14.6, 10. and 16.14, 15.
Heb. 1.3.
; yea, the Father does nothing, but the Son does the same; yea, he does all by
the Son, that all Men might honor the Son, as they honor the Father; nor can
any come, to the Father but by the Son; and all that is the Father's is the
Son's, and through him his glory appears.

The Lord knows. This Word is more then sees, discerns, and so knows;
Joh. 2.24, 25. and 16.30. Dan. 2.22, Isa. 66.18. Luke 16.15. Deuteronomy. 31.21. 2
King. 19.27. Isa. 37.28. Jer. 48.30. Psa. 138.6. and 139.1, 5.
for so God, yea, God in Christ, and so Christ knows all things; yea, he
knows what is in the darkness, though only the light dwells with him: he
knows the hearts of all Men, even the worst of Men also; yea, their abode,
and going in and coming out, and rage against him; yea he knows the proud
afar off; and therefore he is fit to judge all, and this is for the comfort of
his Servants also; yea, he knows them, and their thoughts, and their ways: a
good Meditation for them: but knows in this business signifies more then all
this; yea, more then to say, See part 4. chapter 7.
The Lord knows who they be that are his, and who are not: for the word here
imports special Grace, Favor and Protection, (as has been shown,) The Lord
knows, that is, the Lord owneth, approves, chooses, delights in,
protecteth, leads, upholdeth, manifests himself to, and vouchsafes
fellowship with, and makes use of them, to show forth his virtues and praises
by: and so the word is used, Psalm. 1.6. explained, God is in the generation of
the righteous: God loves the righteous: Psalm. 14.5. and 146.8. and 37.17. and
112.6. and 5.12. and 1.6. and 146.9. and 37.17. and 112.10.
The Lord upholdeth the righteous: The righteous shall be in ever lasting
remembrance: For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favor will thou
compass him, as with a shield. And this knowing of the righteous, is opposed to
the perishing of the way of the wicked, his turning of the way of the wicked
upside down: so as the arms of the wicked shall be broken, and the desire of
the wicked shall perish; yea, to this understanding of the word knows, here,
we are led by Christ and his Apostles: yea, the learned and godly Writers with
one consent so take the word knows, importing Approbation and Election: The
Lord knows them that are his. These words by the connection with the precedent
and following words and the Apostle's scope, appear plainly, That,

By Them that are his, are not meant all that are his in any sense, as all that
he has right in to dispose of; yea, and to bring about his own ends by, and to
judge, etc. for so, Psalm. 24.1. and 119.91. Joh 12.16. Psalm. 2.7, 9. Romans 13.9.
Act. 10.36. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. Joh. 5.28, 29.
The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that
dwell therein: yea, All are his servants: The deceived and the deceiver are
his: yea, God has given to Christ upon the account of his sufferings and
sacrifice, all Nations of Men; yea, all Men to be disposed by him, and he to be
the Lord of them all; and they are all obliged to him to live to him; and will
they, nill they, they shall all come one day before him, and confess him Lord,
and he shall judge them. In which sense, all Men are his; which, though some
through unbelief deny, and will not acknowledge the Lordship of Christ upon
this ground; yet will none plead for them that are his, to be taken in this
sense here: and it has been often proved before, That none that live in
impenitency and unbelief, can be reckoned in the number of those that are here
meant by them that are his.

By Them that are his, evidently appears here to be meant, them that are his
peculiar, or his in a peculiar manner, that is, them that in the heavenly Call
by the Gospel, in discovery of his great Name, Joh. 6.44, 45. and 14.21, 23.
and 17.2, 6, 7. Romans 9.24. Heb. 3.1, 6. 1 Cor. 1.24. 2 Cor. 8 5 Tit. 3.3, 7.
Romans 9.8. Gal. 3.29. Romans 8.28. 2 These. 2.13. 2 Pet. 1.2. Hos. 2.23. Romans 9.25,
26. 1 Cor. 8.2, 3. Gal. 4.8, 9. 1 Cor. 6.11. 1 These. 5.4, 5. Ephesians. 2.3, 10.
that is, the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, and God's love and
propitiousness to Mankind through him, are prevailed with to believe in
Christ; and so through the Grace believed, united to him, and so wrought up to
love God, and yield up themselves to trust in him, and live to him; and in the
abounding of this love believed, springing up this Faith and Love in them, he
returning with more discoveries of Love, and so approving delighting in, and
choosing them: These are the Children of the Promise that are Christ his
peculiar, and Heirs according to Promise, The Called according to Purpose, that
love God and Christ, The Elect and chosen through Sanctification of the Spirit,
etc. These are them that his, his people in such a sense, as before this they
were not his people; and so both knowing God, and rather so known of God as
before they were not: so now in Christ, in the light, his Children and peculiar
people, which before they were not. And this understanding of these and no
other, to be his peculiar people, and chosen and elect Generation, we are fully
and plainly taught, as all that will read and mind 1 Pet. 2.2, 3, 5, 9, 10.
may see, without interpretation or gloss: and so it is plain, these are those
here meant by Them that are his. And we have the same from our Savior's own
Mouth, (who is the Foundation, and the first sealed, known, approved and
elect,) Joh. 14.21, 23. and 16.27. and 15.16, 19. and 17.6, 10, 16. Joh. 3.14,
15, 16. and 16.24.
He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me; and
he that loves me, shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will
manifest my self to him, etc. And, The Father himself has loved you, because
ye have loved me, etc. and these he says, He has chosen out of the world, and
they are not of the world. And these are the Father's, and these are Christ's:
so that, it is plain, these are The Them so known and owned, of which Paul
speaks here to Timothy: and if any Man would put any into this number, that are
not of this Them, the Scripture is directly against him. So that in this 2 Timothy
2.19. according to Scripture Language, we have set forth intimately the Purpose
of God, and expressly and distinctly, The Foundation of God that is laid
according to his purpose, Isa. 28.16. 1 Pet. 2.6.
and the Election of those that are prevailed with by Grace, to believe in, and
rely on Christ according to his Purpose also; the Foundation is first laid,
and upon the account of the preciousness of this Foundation, the owning and
election of those that believe on him, they shall not be ashamed. I know not
what can be more plain and evident: and yet that which follows confirms all
hitherto said.

4. And let every one that names the Name of Christ depart from iniquity. If
any will take this as the flourishing of the Seal whereby it is demonstrated to
others, I hinder him not, nor does it hinder the scope aimed at; yet I rather
conceive it distinct: for it is not said, These Seals but this Seal; which
mentioned what it is: he comes in with an and distinctive though not
dis-junctive; differenced, though not divided; both distinctive and copulative:
neither the Foundation, nor the Seal; yet an instruction and warning taught by
the Foundation, Tit. 2.11, 12. Pro. 1.22, 23. and 9.6. Mar. 1.15. Act. 3.26.
and 26, 18. Joh. 2.8. Pro. 1.24. Joh. 3.19. Psalm. 85.8. Heb. 3.7. Jam. 1.21. 1
Pet. 2.1, 2.3. Jam. 1.25. Act. 15.9.
and according to the Purpose in Election: For first, this saving Grace of God
in Christ in its appearance, teaches and requires every one to whom it is
tendered in the Call, To submit to his convincements, and turn at his reproofs,
and so turn from iniquity. And if any stubbornly refuse, they lose their own
mercies, their own souls: and those that begin to hearken, and in believing to
taste something of the graciousness of the Lord, it warns also to turn no more
to folly, but to be still casting off all superfluity of naughtiness, and to
receive with meekness the ingrafted word, that so they may come more upon him,
and be built on him. And such as thus receive his gracious words in believing
on him, he will purify from all their iniquities, Joh. 3.14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
Tit. 2.11, 12, 13, 14. and 3.3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
and unite and conform them to himself. And so this last sentence shows, That
this whole Verse agrees with our Savior's Description of the Will of God, and
the Foundation he has set forth and owned, and with the Affirmation of the
Oblation of Christ, and the end thereof, and the Teachings and the Efficacies
thereof; and so with all those holy Cautions and Warnings, to take heed of
refusing, and of backsliding, or of liftning to seducing Spirits. And all
runs, even with the scope of the Apostle, and all the precedent and following
Verses, and the whole current of the Scripture, affirming Christ the only and
sure Foundation: whereas the affirming of an eternal Purpose and Election of
some certain persons of fallen Mankind to be eternally saved, is cross to this
Text, and all Scripture, to be laid as the Foundation, though some sometime
leave out the words, having this Seal; that the other following words might be
taken for the Foundation: Mr. O. p. 77.
and then call it, The Foundation of God's unchangeable Purpose and Love: yet
if a Man would say, By purpose is meant that purposed, I would take it in the
most favorable sense. Suppose some honest and learned Jew, before Christ came
in the Flesh, should have affirmed God's Purpose of sending forth his Son
Christ to die, and rise, and offer the acceptable Sacrifice; and so to be the
Savior of the World, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have
everlasting Life: Suppose, I say, he should have taught this Purpose of God to
be the Foundation; he had something miscarried in Expression: for the
Foundation purposed and promised, was the Seed of the Woman to break the
Serpent's Head, the Seed of Abraham, in whom is blessing for all Nations, a Man
to be the Rock and God's Salvation to the ends of the Earth; and though he was
not then come forth, and so not laid, as now he is, yet he was held forth,
though afar off, in the Promise to be looked to: and by reason of the agreement
between the Father and him, and in his undertaking he was so virtuous and
efficacious, that he was a sure Foundation; so as in beholding him, and resting
on him as yet to come, Heb. 11.13, 14, 40.
such Believers were safe. And so they seeing it afar off, were persuaded, and
embraced, and lived and died in the Faith, and shall receive the Promise of the
Inheritance together with us; and so the Foundation was the thing purposed, and
waited for then. So that here were a little mistake in this honest Jews
Expression; yet this mistake might have been tolerable, because the Foundation
was as then no farther laid, but as held forth in the Promise and Revelation of
the Purpose of God. And so to take the Promise and Purpose therein revealed,
including the belief of him promised for the Foundation, had not been
dangerous, but safe, where farther Light was not come forth. But now the
Purpose is manifest to be come forth into act, Act. 2. and 13.32, 33. and
10.11. Romans 1.1, 5. 1 Cor. 3.11. 1 John 1.1, 2, 3.
and the Foundation according to Purpose laid, the promise fulfilled, and
Christ that took Man's Nature, and died for their sins, is risen, and
manifestly declared to be the Foundation. Now to slight over this open, and
manifest, laid, and sealed Foundation, and to cloak it with making the Purpose
of God, the Foundation to be built on; as if the Foundation purposed were not
laid, or not manifest, is not less then an intimate denial of Christ being come
in the Flesh, 1 John 4.3.
and too near the Spirit of Antichrist.

Therefore it is to be desired, That Men would acknowledge and call him, The
Foundation, that is so; and not avoid it, by calling the Purpose, the
Foundation; and yet to call that the Purpose of God, which is not, and make it
the Foundation also, is much worse: consider that also.

CHAP. 11.
Of a devised Purpose, by some called, The Purpose of God; and counted, The
Foundation.

SOme have conceived, and are ready to affirm this for the Purpose of God,
namely, That from Eternity before the Foundation of the World, God did decree
and purpose eternal to save a certain number of persons of fallen Mankind,
and eternally to damn all the rest of Mankind: and in this Purpose to elect
as a peculiar people to himself, all, and only those he so purposed to save;
and to reprobate all the rest. And also, That in this Purpose he purposed to
give his own Son, to take Man's Nature, therein to die, and rise, and offer
Sacrifice for all these elect, and no other; and to purchase for them
Repentance, Faith, and Eternal Life, and for no other: so that these elect
shall infallibly have it all, and none but they. And, That the residue of Men,
by the Sovereignty and Power of God, shall have their lives given them, and
preserved for a time; that living, they may by sin deserve this Damnation they
were fore-purposed and ordained to, before it be executed; that so, whatever
the Purpose was, the Execution may be just; yea, Gospel preached to many of
them, and some lower works of the Spirit vouchsafed them; yea, Faith attained
by many of them, and holiness true in its kind; yea, profession and doing
worthily: from which if they fall, the greater their condemnation; if they
abide and die in that Faith, yet they must be damned: the Death of Christ and
his Gospel, and all means extended to call and lead them to Repentance and
Faith, had nothing really in Truth for their Salvation; but to leave them
without excuse, and aggravate their condemnation. All belonging to eternal
Salvation, is only for those Sons of Adam, that were eternally purposed and
elected to be eternally saved; and in that Purpose Christ given to die for
them, that they might be saved through him. And this eternal Purpose of God,
some make the foundation, on which, whosoever is built, shall not miscarry: and
no right faith but that which springs from this eternal Purpose, and that is
also built on it.

This framed Purpose affirmed both to be the eternal Purpose of God, and the
foundation first laid, for such as shall be saved to be built on, is an
inhumane device, and a very fable, having no Scripture to express it; yea, it
is a Wolf barking against the Testimony of the Gospel; and yet so of many will
not be owned, till some better coat be put upon it. But if any can clothe it
with, and make it bear the Name of Election and Reprobation, used in the
Scripture, and cover it with a pretense to glorify the Sovereignty,
Omnisciency and Immutability of God, and of abasing Man and magnifying Grace;
if by Wit, Eloquence, and Rhetoric, and wresting Scripture, it be covered with
these pretenses, it may be entertained as a Truth, and a harmless Lamb, by some
zealous, humble, and learned Men; and so it may come to be deposited into the
keeping of some Graduates in some University, that can charm its voice, stop
its violence in devouring, and set it forth in more orderly form; so that
though the thing it self be a Wolf; yet it having on it a Sheep's-Skin; and
being charmed from its barking and violence of devouring; demeaning it self, as
by Art it has been taught: It may so long go for a Sheep, and be cherished in
the Bosoms, and commended in the Declarations of wise, learned and godly Men;
and be entertained, applauded, and pleaded for as a Sheep, by many zealous,
conscientious Professors, and have certain brands of antiquity, and consent of
many learned and godly put upon it; and they that so do, till the Sheep's-Skin
be taken off it, may remain godly still, and yet much hurt be done: for the
Wolf, as it grows up, cannot but sometime show its Nature; yet subtly: so,
as if he bark, it is so out of the hearing of the judicious, that it will be
denied to be he that did it: and if he devour any Sheep, it is so secretly in
the Night, that when Light comes he is gone, and in another place; and so not
known till by the Watchers he be spied among some of his Fellows, and heard
barking, and seen devouring; and yet though they declare it, it will be hard to
convince many of it, till themselves be bitten, he has been so long taken and
applauded for a Sheep among them.

And yet that this Wolf may be known to be so, even while the Sheep's-Skin is
on him; if we, as we are taught, 1 John 4.1.
take Doctrines or Spirits that are false, in the same sense with false
Prophets, we have a good direction given us by our Savior Christ, that says,
Mat. 7.15.
Ye shall know them by their fruits. Now then, they being not open and
professed Wolves, but appearing in Sheep's-clothing, Act. 20.29.30.
and inwardly Wolves; and in Society not with the Wolves of the World, but
among the Sheep in the professed Church, what can fruits be to know them by? but
only these, that in stead of bleating like a Sheep, they bark; and instead of
feeding with the Sheep, they are biting, if not devouring.

Now then confider this Doctrine, or devised Fable of such a Purpose as last
related and held forth for the Foundation of God's unchangeable Purpose and
Election; of which, and no other, I now speak: That it is a devised Fable, such
as the Apostles shunned, 2 Pet. 1.16. 2 Timothy 4.4. Isa. 8.20.
and charged others so to do, is evident; because there is no one saying, nor
diverse, to be coupled in the Law and Testimony, in its own plainness and
simplicity, to affirm it with: That it is a Wolf, the general Affirmation of
our true Prophet and Shepherd assures us, that says, All that ever came before
me, are thieves and robbers. Joh. 10.4.
All that ever came before me: and so whatever is presentend to Men before
Christ, as the Father's Mind and Purpose, or any other thing for Men to stay
and rest on, as a foundation for Faith and Hope, a Guide and safe Keeper: he
says not only, Were, but are Thieves and Robbers; and so Devourers. He, The
first purposed, The first promised; Moses, and all the Prophets; yea, the whole
Scripture testifies of him; yea, they all in those times directed to look to
him, as then to come, that Men might receive the knowledge of God's Mind, and
behold his grace, and receive his Salvation, in minding and believing on him,
as the foundation to be laid in Sion: and though the Purpose and Promise was
plainly declared; yet not before, nor farther, or otherwise then he was
declared; nor did it come forth till he came, nor did any of the Servants of
God teach any to judge it come, till he came; but in his coming, it did come
forth into act: and he is now laid in Sion, and held forth by Sion, and by the
Anostles plainly declared to be, The only true Prophet, Rabbi, Teacher,
Shepherd, and Foundation: therefore whatever Purpose or Election be feigned to
be before him, and so to be the foundation to be known and built upon, for
comfort, or hope, or assurance of our interest in him and Salvation through
him; and so before faith in him; or any otherwise known, then in knowing him,
or any other then is first complete in him and flowing through him: so as he
himself, as discovered in the Gospel, be the first Opener of the Father's
Mind, Allurer of, and Peace-speaker to the Heart, and Door of approach to God,
and all saving Truth, and into fellowship with the Church; that same, that is
not thus, is a Thief, and a Robber; yea, his being laid, called, and sealed:
for the foundation does plainly demonstrate this; for the foundation is that
which is first brought forth to view, and so first said; and then all that is
to be built, laid on that foundation: and then the foundation bears and
upholdeth all the building. And Christ being affirmed to be this foundation;
yea he only, and no other: therefore, though the revealed Purpose of God
concerning him, and of saving and communicating all saving-Grace, with and
through him; and his sealing-Approbation and Election of him for all this, and
of all for his that are brought in to and upon him, be known in knowing him,
and then and so heavenly cords to draw upon, and unite and fasten more to him;
yet they are by good Men very improperly called the Foundation, which Christ
himself only is; as is foreshewn.

But for this foresaid devised Purpose and Election of a certain number of
fallen Mankind to eternal salvation, and of Christ to be given to die only
for them, to purchase it for them only, etc. This is not only a fable, but a
Thief and Devourer, and so a Wolf, and being grown, and often with his fellows,
his fruits do now discover him, both in his barking and devouring; yea, even
while some plead for him: for it barks and snaps directly against the Purpose
of God, set forth by our Savior Joh. 3.14, 15, 16, 17.
, and affirmed by his Apostle 1 Timothy 2.4, 5, 6, 7.
; and also against the Testimony of the Gospel affirming Jesus Christ the
Savior of the World 1 John 4.14.
, the propitiation for the sins of the World 1 John 2.2.
, to be the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the World Joh. 1.2 9.
, to have died for all, and for every Man 2 Cor. 5.14. Heb. 2.9.
, and to enlighten every Man that comes into the World, and so to be God's
Salvation to the ends of the Earth Joh. 1.9 ^6.^
; and it also barks and snaps against God's gracious end in the Gospel
preaching to the unbelieving and rebellious, even to save Act. 3.26. and 26.17,
18.
: and it subtly devours also, in that it takes from Men the key of knowledge,
by which they might come to the knowledge of the Mind of God, and the
Mysteries of his Kingdom, and shuts the Door to keep them from entering in at
that Door to immortality and life, which is brought to light by the Gospel: and
for this end, it leads like the Serpent of old, to query and put doubts in the
plain sayings of God; as, Has God in saying said? was that his meaning? did he
mean sinners, all men, the world? No sure; he meant but some, an unknown elect
Company, that may be some of all sorts of Men: and to maintain this device, it
leads to change the words and terms of Scripture, and for all Men, and the
World, to say some of all sorts; and for all, every, and the World, to say of
the Elect; and call the Seal, the foundation; as more safe terms then the Holy
Ghost uses (for his terms confute the fable) and it perverts and changes the
sayings of Christ, and to that end brings in Philosophy, and multiplies
Questions and strife about words, to the subverting many, I charge in this, and
that which follows, nothing but the fable it self; no Man, unless he willingly
and professedly make himself guilty.

But this is not all the mischief this fable does, as many that are delivered
out of it, can tell; for this fable and Wolf, being embraced and taken for
Truth, or a Sheep, and so admired, it robs and devoureth many ways: as to
say, some that are inwardly touched and conscientious, fearful to deceive
themselves, or be deceived, having nothing demonstrated to them, that can truly
satisfy them, that they are of this elect number, are by the thoughts of it
driven into a terrible and ungospel-like despair, and from thence to hard
thoughts of God; yea, near, if not to blasphemy of him, for making Adam, and
giving him such a Law, suffering him to fall, and retaining in himself that
Purpose to damn the most of men unavoidably, without leaving them any means of
escape: and then to wish, Oh that there were no God, no Law, no Heaven, no
Hell, or that God had never given us being. And all the comfort this fable will
afford them, is but this, They may be elected for any thing they know (though
ten to one it is not so) they may be of this smallest number; and they must
submit to the will of God, to be damned if he have so purposed: for he will
bring them he saves, to this submission; and if they submit to this, there is
hope they are of the elect number. Oh! how hardly can they do this? and how
dreadful are their thoughts? and yet so gracious is God, that he affords some
hints of Mercy to them in the thoughts of Christ his dying for sinners, and
coming to save sinners; so that whoever believe on him, shall not perish but
have everlasting life: and here their drooping Spirits begin to revive.

But then comes this fable again and tells them, It Is true indeed Christ died
for sinners, but not for all sinners, but only for such sinners, as were elect
from eternity; and unless they be of that number, the Death of Christ, and all
Faith in him they can attain to, shall do them no good. And the poor Soul
harkening to this, is distracted and east down again, and begins to think it
must yield to be willing to be damned: and they that cannot flatter themselves
with conceit of such a willingness, whither if the infinite mercy of God
prevent not, it will lead, and whither it has led some, has been sadly known.
And for such as can persuade themselves, that if God will so, they are willing
to be damned, what an unprofitable flash and vain hope it has produced from
their conceits of being elected, and what horror or deadness has after
followed, until that mercy of God in Christ that died for sinners as sinners,
has recovered them, not only I, but others that I have known, have born
witness, with blessing our gracious God for bringing us out of that snare: some
also there have been, and (...) that hating profaneness, and prizing highly
the righteousness of the works of the Law; yet having embraced this fable,
think that salvation is grounded upon this fore-discovered foundation of God's
eternal Election of some of Adam's Sons to eternal salvation; and so that
Christ died only for them, and so none but those elect can be eternally saved:
and they holding in this Opinion, but not so inwardly afflicted in heart, as
the former fort, (unless such as are fallen into deadness, which are liable in
that deadness to the same snare with these) who in words disclaiming to rest
on, or look to be saved by any righteousness, or changes of their own; but
only by the Free Grace of God in his eternal Election, and giving Christ to
die for his Elect; yet for knowledge of their Election, and that Christ died
for them, they slyly and subtly take their inward change, their sorrow for
sin, detestation and shunning of evil ways, their humility, desires and
prizings of Grace, Love, Zeal of righteous walking, etc. as a Fruit and
Testimony of their Election before time, and Christ his dying for them in time;
and so conclude that they are elected, and that Christ died for them; yet this
their first consolation, going before and raised from something before their
belief of the Free Grace of God in Christ dying for sinners as sinners, they
hide with a pretense of an acknowledgement of Grace; they could not, corrupt
Nature would not, it was Grace only that wrought this change: I think thee, O
God that I am not as other men are, Luke 18.11, 12.
etc. And they in this magnify the fable, and the fable molesteth them not.
And so they grow into conceit with themselves, and despifing others, loving
those of their own judgment only, and opposing the Children of the
Freewoman, Romans 9.32, 33. and 10.1, 2, 3 Gal. 4. Phil. 3.3, 7, 8, 9.
that have their birth only from the grace of God, and trust in him only.
Such their Confidence, and whither such Confidence will lead, is expressly told
us, even to stumble at Christ. And not I only, but many others have cause to
bless God, that in making Christ known, overthrew this Confidence, and brought
us in to believe in Jesus Christ only; and so delivered us that from snare
also.

But yet some there are, Gal. 3.10, 13. Tit. 3.4.
that heeding the Testimony of Christ in the Gospel, see these changes and
righteous affections and doings of ones own, are very imperfect, and too weak
to raise such a Conclusion from, and not the way in which the Love of God
appears to save Men, and bring them in to himself, and so not to assure
Election or trust in for it or for life. And that sue^ Trusters cannot be
justified before God; but that is only by the freeness of his Grace discovered
to sinners, as sinners, through the Blood of Christ that died for sinners; and
so bringing them in to believe in him for Justification, yea, and
Sanctification, and all saving Grace, through the freeness of his Grace. O
Grace! how freely workest thou? O precious Faith! thou art now a working.

But this fable not being yet banished, does secretly suggest, All this is true
indeed; but yet this Death of Christ for sinners, as sinners, and all this free
and rich Grace in and through him, is not, nor never was intended for all
sinners, but only to some of them before the World was: the Elect, and they
only, and no other shall have it.

And for the reverence so of many holy Men as have affirmed this fable for
Truth, this Suggestion is received: and so in stead of believing what Grace
tendereth. they are persuaded first to wait for some special and personal
Manifestation of their Election from eternity, by some supernatural shine, and
powerful dictate in some speaking to their heart, that they are elect sons, and
so that Christ has died for them, and their sins are forgiven: and for want of
this, many long languish, and refuse to believe, and to be comforted by the
Words of the Gospel; and some overhasty of Consolation, snatch at any word
that comes suddenly into their thoughts, though left to their own and others
Interpretation, yet putt up with, and boast of them: some in this waiting,
ready to receive any Satanical delusion, coming as an Angel of Light, and so to
be transported with strange dreams and erring fancies; yet so merciful is God,
that to some thus waiting; he not laying this their folly to their charge, does
for his own Name sake in Christ, in some season, mind them of his graciousness
and love in Christ, with some saying or promise in the Gospel put to their
heart, in which they are drawn through Christ to behold him as a Father: and so
for the present, sweetly comforted and framed, yet the Dreams of the old fable
not banished. Anon after, some grow proud of their visits, and though foiled
with some passions and lusts, yet presumptuously confident in their visits,
They say, They cannot by these things miscarry; God can as soon cease to be
God, as cease eternally to save them, because of his eternal Purpose corcerning
them: yet others in minding the great and free love and goodness of God in
Christ, and their own infirmities, are kept more humbly confident in his grace
in Christ, and stirred up more seriously to acknowledge the failings that
appear; and to seek in exercise of faith and use of means, help, preservation,
and increase of grace through Christ; yet the relics of the old fable hinders
the free stream of their Love to such as are yet in ignorance, and their ready
declaring Gospel to them, and apts them to many lofty Speeches, and
un-Gospel-like sayings; and to judge all that by temptation are turned aside,
to have been but hypocrites before; and to put a stop to weak Brethrens
consolation, that have not had their visits. Yet God being gracious to both
these sorts, does yet farther correct and teach them, (notwithstanding the
force the old fable has with them still) and keeps their hearts to himself,
and out of some backslidings does recall them, and heal them: his mercies are
greater, and his waves above Man's, as many of us have cause to confess; for by
his gracious teachings, the Gospel often breathing and shining upon their
hearts, (notwithstanding all the miscarriages before said) The Testimony of
Jesus; That he died for all, and is the Propitiation for the sins of the whole
World; That whoever of them believe in him, shall not perish, but have
everlasting Life: and this the Purpose of God is discerned and believed. And so
the old fable it self departs, and they are more freely and sweetly drawn
upon Jesus Christ, and have all their rest and joy in him, and the freeness of
the grace of God in him, and to mind Purpose and Election, as it is, and
appears in and through him, and so begin to be united to him, and in some
measure conformed to him, loving delightfully their brethren, and with
compassion those that are yet in ignorance and unbelief, and readily holding
forth the word of Life, as a word of Truth and Verity to them.

And yet notwithstanding all this, though the old fable be gone, some of the
dregs of it are left remaining, secretly moving in them, which they in their
fancy are rectifying to a new mould, as if though secret, yet some such
Election there is. But God has purposed, and according to his Purpose, sent
Christ the Savior of the World: and he has purposed, and according to his
Purpose, has, does and will use means toward all, that they might be saved,
and especially where the Gospel comes; yea, so far stretching forth his hand in
the means, with such sufficiency of light and strength, that they might indeed
repent and believe; in which repenting and believing, he will surely save them
by Christ: and if they in such seasons do not repent and believe, it is their
own fault, and they lose their own Souls: all which is verily true. But then
follows, If God should do no more but that which is enough and sufficient to
bring Men in to believe, then would none believe, and so none would come into
his rest, and be eternally saved: but some must enter; therefore he has
decreed and purposed to overcome some with an almighty and unresistable power:
and those only so purposed, and so overcome, shall be eternally saved.

This at first blush would seem to set forth God's Mercy to all Mankind, to
free him from all the imputation of hardness and cruelty by the former fable
laid upon him to abase Man, and magnify the riches and freeness of his Grace
to some, and the equity of his Justice to others; and leaves room to preach the
Gospel as Truth to all, which the other fable did not: yet in Truth well
weighed, it is found but a mere Artifice of remaining dregs of the former; and
if long remaining, will have its barking, bleat, and bring forth many of its
Fruits: and now it may be more marvelled, that the former fable gone, this
should be framed out of its dregs, after plain Gospel-Testimony is believed,
there being no one Saying in the Gospel, declaring any such thing, or that
gives ground for any such consequence: and why should any of us that have
received so much good in the Gospel-Testimony, strain for a consequence to
maintain that which the Gospel declares not; yea, which stands cross to many
Declarations; yea, Heb. 4.6.
and to the scope of that very place alleged some must enter? which appears to
be spoken to encourage the weakest Believers, to abide and go on in their
Faith, that they may enter the Rest, or Canaan, Compare chapter 3. and 4. with chapter
6.12-20. and 11. See Part 3. chapter 2.
God has sworn to give Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and their Seed: and they
looked to receive it in a heavenly manner, a new Earth, etc. which they never
yet did, nor shall, till we all, to the last that shall be called by the
Gospel-Ministration, come to enter together with them.

True, God by Moses called them out of Egypt, to that very promised Canaan, but
not at that time to receive it in that manner promised to Abraham, but yet to
receive it; for which he gave them his promise; which they not firmly
believing, (especially after the receipt of the First Fruits) all the ancient
Men except Caleb and Joshua (that followed him fully in the faith of his
Promise) fell in the Wilderness, and entered not: not but that Moses, Aaron,
Miriam, Zelophehad, and all like them, even all but the rebellious shall in the
Resurrection of the Just, rise again, and enter this promised Rest with
Abraham, etc. So that in this they were but Types and Examples to us. Those
that Joshua led into the Land, the Lord by Joshua gave them rest; and in
continuing in the Law of the Lord, they might have retained it in that manner
till the coming of Christ: but yet the Rest as promised to Abraham, was not
then given; no, nor yet so long after as in David's time, who, when a King
there, and had both his people and his enemies subdued to him yet confessed
himself a stranger as his Fathers were, and affirmed the promised Rest to be
yet to come; yet sure all that lived and died in the Faith, must rise and enter
when Abraham enters: after, God sent forth Christ for a Witness and Covenant;
that resting on him by Faith, they might be so entering, and in due time fully
enter. And the Gospel hereof, was first preached to the Jews, who for the most
part refused, and so entered not by by Faith, and deprived themselves of a
personal entrance when the time comes; yet God in his faithfulness to Abraham,
will preserve a Seed of Men of his Generation through all troubles, that there
should be found of them, surviving at the coming of Christ, and be brought in
by him, and shall enter when Abraham, and all that sleep in Jesus shall be
raised and enter together with them; and till then, none so enter: for were it
already so entered, our hope would be cut off; but it is not; the rest yet
remains for the people of God, that we believing and abiding in Christ, may
have him for our rest, and so be entering by Faith now, and personally at Christ
his next coming: to encourage all Believers to firmness and constancy in this
faith, is the drift and scope of the Apostle, Romans 9.19.
who has thus opened the same. Methinks none should be so void of fear, to
affirm, that as the Saying of the Holy Ghost, which is given as the suggestion
of an evil spirit, and Saying of a vain Man, and so reproved, Who has resisted
his Will? as if none had or could; which with grief, I suppose true Believers
will confess they have too often. What other evils of dissension among
Brethren, etc. the affirming of this devised Purpose to be both the Purpose of
God, and the Foundation, and what other inconveniences follow the maintaining
of the last mentioned figment, I will forbear to speak; only I confess, for
the reverence I bare to some, I was a long time snared with this old fable,
till I experimented the evils mentioned, and was brought to confess God in his
Sayings true, whoever be a liar: nor do I now blame any but my self, who might
have received good only, and not harm by what I read, if I had not made Men's
holiness and learning, but the Scripture only the umpire of my Faith; and yet
I have learned this, That a Wolf in a Sheep's-Skin may for a time be embraced,
and pleaded for by them that are no Wolves; and so to be sober in judging: yea,
this I farther confess, That when I thought my self freed, this last mentioned
figment did a long time remain with me, yea, I was not freed of it, when that
my first published Tract called by the Printer, The Universality of God's
Free Grace to Mankind, was put forth; some Expressions there of it, I wish
were amended. So that in this whole Chapter, I own the blame of all the folly
shown to my self, desiring of God; as for forgiveness of all my Transgressions,
so of those in maintenance and favor of this old Fable, or the last mentioned
figment in Word, or any Manuscript of mine: desiring him that has freed me, to
free others. And yet I believe the eternal Purpose of God, and the Foundation
he has laid according to his Purpose, and his Election of that Foundation, and
of all in believing united to him, to be verily true, precious, unmovable,
unalterable, as they are revealed in the Scripture, as I have fore-declared.

CHAP. 12.
The Conclusion about the Purposes of God, to be known and believed.

THe Gospel as now come forth, the Testimony of Christ in that which he has
suffered and done, and what he is to and for them, and what he does to them
that they might believe, and what he will farther do to and for them believing;
and his Father's and his own end in all this, it is the Word and Mind of God;
yea, the very opening and Declaration of the Heart, Bosom, Counsels and
Purposes of God: there is no Purpose of God, cross to any part of this
Testimony, nor is there any Purpose that is God's, but what is according to
this Testimony, which is the Word and Declaration of the Mind of the living
God, Romans 6.25, 26. Ephesians. 3.3, 9.
and called his Decree, not to be doubted or waved from, by any Suggestion of
other secret Purposes, or by feigned pretenses of other meanings, as if it were
the Word of a Man, that spoke by guess or probabilities, or according to
appearances; but to be believed and received as the word of the Almighty,
all-knowing God of Truth, wherein the very mystery of his Will is opened to us.
Wherefore it becomes us neither to imagine our selves, nor receive of others,
nor pry into any Purposes, as if Purposes of God that are not declared in and
according to the Testimony of Christ in the Gospel: beware of Evah's desire of
knowledge; but if we would know mysteries, Romans 1.16. 1 Thessalonians. 2.13.
mind well and believe fi^^ly the Declaration of the Gospel, and that believed
with the heart as the Word of the God of Truth, will enlighten and work
effectually in us; yea, if that be so heeded, as the very discovery of the
Mind, Heart, and Purpose of God to such unworthy Ones as we; what appearances
of divine Love, what excellencies, what depths of understanding and knowledge,
what supernatural shines, divine streams, spiritual operations, in melting,
renewing, heart-rejoycing! yea, what nighness and approach to God, what
fellowship with Father and Son, and with Prophets and Apostles! yea, what hope
and heavenly riches is to be met with through the Spirit, in belief of this
Testimony, will not be believed without some experiment in the Declarations of
well-grown and experimented Believers; much less in the scanty Declaration of
such a one as I: therefore I forbear that Declaration, knowing, that when any
do come heartily to believe the Gospel-Testimony of Christ, they will
experiment so much, that they will confess, As they have heard, they have
found; but withal, they think the half was not told them; and then they will
see enough in the Purpose of God as revealed for them to know: and this may be
farther said, That the Purposes of God as revealed in the Gospel, are such as
are meet and forcible, if believed, to draw unbelievers to believe, to confirm
weak Believers in the Faith, and to make valiant the strong. All which things
has been before shown and proved.

An Explicit Declaration of the Testimony of Christ, etc.
PART V.
CHAP. I.
Of the Promises of God in the behalf of Mankind.

THe Promises of God, Psalm. 12.5, 6, 7. 2 Cor. 1.20.
are true pure and certain, to be performed according to the terms of his Word
and Promise: they are like his Purposes; yea, the Declarers of his Purposes,
and so Yea and Amen in Christ. And those I am now to take view of, are those
which have their tendency toward the Salvation of Mankind, out of the death he
fell into by the first Adam, and the Justification and eternal Salvation of
Believers: And these I shall view in three Heads or Branches: first, Those
done: secondly, also in doing: thirdly, those remaining to be done.

The first Head or Branch of Promises, is of those things that are truly most,
Genesis 3.15. with 2 John 3.5. Genesis 22.18. with Gal. 3.16. Isa. 42.1, 7. and 49.6.
and all in some sense done and performed; and these are of two sorts: I name
the later first, because first made known to Man; that is, 1. To Mankind, for
giving and sending a Savior. 2. To Christ the Savior, upon his oneness of
Will and Mind with the Father, in his undertaking to be the Savior, and to
save according to the Will and Mind of the Father: and 5.3, 4, 10. with Joh.
3.16, 17. 1 John 4.14. Act. 13.47.
and these are also both in plain and express Promises, and also certainly
intimated in the Curse and Threats on the Serpent and Serpentine Seed, the
Enemies of the Salvation of Mankind, and of the Peace and Prosperity of the
Church, the Seed of Christ, the Seed of the Woman.

1. The Promises to Mankind for giving and sending a Savior, even Christ,
that he should be a very Man, of the Seed of the Woman, Emmanuel, God with us;
that he should come of Abraham, and blessing be in him for all Nations; that he
should die, and rise, and offer the Propitiatory Sacrifice, and make Atonement
for the sins of Men, and be filled with Spirit, so as he shall be God's
Salvation to the ends of the Earth, even the Savior of the World, that
whoever believes on him should not perish but have everlasting Life; which
things are before explained in the Purposes of God, of which the Promises are
the Discoverers. And these Promises are fulfilled: Act. 13.31, 32.33. Romans 8.32.
and he that verily believes God to have fulfilled his Promise in this, may
very well trust him in any other Promise.

2. The Promises to Christ the Savior, Psa. 40.6, 7. Heb. 10.5, 7. Isa. 50.9.
Psalm. 116.10, 11. Psalm. 2.6. and 110.1. Isa. 42.1. and 50.4, 5, 6. and 61.1, 2,
3. Psa. 110.4. Isa. 49.7, 8 and 55.5. Mal. 3.1. Isa. 40. Psalm. 68.11, 19. Prove.
9.3. Isa. 53.10, 11, 12. Psa. 2.8, 9. and 89.20, 21, 27. 1 Chronicles. 17.13, 14.
Isa. 65.9.
upon his oneness of Mind and Will with the Father, in his undertaking to be
the Savior, and to save according to the Mind and Will of the Father: as,
That he would give him a Body, that in it he might do his Will; That he would
be with him in all his Sufferings, and uphold him, and raise him out of Death,
and exalt him after his Sufferings and Resurrection, and set him at his right
Hand, and fill him with the fullness of the Spirit in the Nature of Man, and so
give him the Tongue of the Learned; and, That he would make him an High Priest
for ever, after the order of Melchizedec; and, That he would be present with
him, to make his Mediation prosperous; and, he would also give him a Messenger
to go before his Face or Presence, to prepare the way before him; and Witnesses
also to declare him when he had finished the Work he was to do in his own Body:
and, That he should see his Seed, and the work of the Lord should prosper in
his Hand; and, That he would give the Heathen to him for an Inheritance to
rule, and the Kingdom and heavenly Inheritance for himself, and all his
spiritual Seed, that should be his Jewels, and his peculiar Inheritance. All
which things are explained in the Purposes, which are discovered in the
Promises.

And as the former Promises to Mankind, so these to Christ, as undertaking for
Mankind, are all of both sorts for the good and benefit of Mankind; and yet
had they no dependence on the Faith of particular Men; but that God would send
his Son to be the Savior, and so furnish him to be a Savior, depended only
upon the Truth and Faithfulness of God, and should upon that account be
performed to and for Men, notwithstanding all the unbelief of Men; though Men
come to the use of understanding, cannot receive the special saving benefit,
but in the belief; which belief was not so easy, nor had so demonstrating and
powerful evidence and Argument to draw to believe, as since it is unbared in
the performance. And note, That these Promises to Mankind, and as to Christ
for the good of Mankind, are Promises of Christ by God to Mankind: but not so
properly, as the following Promises through Christ, suitable to our Savior's
Doctrine of his Father's Will in his Love, he freely found out the Ransom,
and promised and gave his Son to be the Savior: but extends Salvation by and
through his Son Christ. Joh. 3.16, 17. Romans 5.6, 8 Gal. 4.4. 1 Timothy 1.15. 1
Pet. 3.22, 23. Heb. 7, and 8, and 9, and 10. 1 Ioh. 4. Romans 1.1, 4. 1 Pet.
1.21, 25. Ioh. 1.12, 13. Gal. 3.7, 8, 16, 26, 29. Ioh. 3.14, 15, 16, 17. Tit.
3.3, 4, 5, 6.
And these Promises, except those as unto Christ, even all as unto Mankind
fallen, were made to them simply as sinners, ungodly, and in enmity against
God. But these Promises are now fulfilled in Christ; and so for Men, that they
might believe: and this is expressly affirmed. So that Christ is come is the
flesh, the promised Seed in which is blessing for all Nations, Gal. 3.16. the
immortal Seed, of which all that are born from above, have their conception and
birth; neither is there any other Seed, nor any that can be counted his Seed,
till by the Grace discovered in these Promises fulfilled, they be brought in to
him, and so born again; and so any Man in believing, may come to be of this
Seed: and in this discovery of him, as these promises are fulfilled in him,
wonderfully is the Love of God to Mankind holden forth and displayed, that Men
might believe; as is shown in the Testimony of Christ, and in the last
Revelation of him, and in the Purposes of God concerning Mankind before.

But alas, Mankind fallen are not only sinners and Enemies to God, but
therethrough naturally deaf, blind, in darkness, and dead in sins and
trespasses, and so unable to discern the grace in these Promises discovered,
much more unable to believe and turn in to Christ, and so come upon this
Foundation, that they may be quickened, and born of this Seed: and what hope
then? to this the following Promises give answer.

The second Head or Branches of Promises are through Christ that has thus far
finished his work, and for his sake to Mankind, the Sons of Men: for though in
and through the infinite Love and Mercy of God, the former Promises might be,
and were both made and performed to Mankind simply, as fallen and sinners, his
Truth and Justice not gainsaying; yet the Promises now to be spoken of, could
not be made, much less performed, if a ransom and Atonement had not been
found; in which Truth is fulfilled, and Justice executed, and so satisfied;
which is only in the Death, Resurrection and Sacrifice of Christ that made the
Atonement, and wrought Redemption in the Nature of Man, Psalm. 85.10, 11.
In whom mercy and truth are met, righteousness and peace have kissed: Truth
shall (now has) sprung out of the earth, and righteousness shall (now does)
look down from heaven. And so it is through him, that all the Promises we are
in this Branch to view, are made to Mankind; and they are also now in doing
and performing: and these are of three sorts, that is to say, 1. To Mankind as
lying in ignorance, darkness, Isa. 42.1, 2, 4, 6, 7. and 49.6, 6. and 52.10,
13, 14, 15. and 61.1, 0, 3. Mat. 12.18, 19. Luke 2.32. Romans 15.21. Joh. 1.4, 5,
7, 8, 9.
blindness and unbelief; as, that Christ shall be a Light to the Gentiles, and
show forth Judgment to them; and in Ministration of the Gospel, preach glad
tidings of peace and salvation to them, and so open their blind eyes, and
bring them forth of the dark prison to see his light, etc. in which he is
always faithful, and according to his Father's will, and in his season does
all this. And these Promises have for their performance, neither dependence on,
nor reference to the believing of Men; but shall in a measure, according to the
means used by him, be performed to Men, whether they believe, and heed it, or
not; and in more special manner, where the Gospel comes; for he calls all the
ends of the Earth, Isa. 45.22 Mat. 4.16. and 25.24, 26. Prove. 1.22, 24. Romans
2.4, 5. Joh. 3.18, 19. and 15.22, 24.
but makes light to shine where the Gospel comes; yea, he does not condemn Men
for impenitency and unbelief, to whom he never showed light, nor gave eyes to
see, nor stretched out his hand that they might repent and believe; but upon
that very account condemns the impenitent and unbelieving. If it be replied,
That men are not able to believe: that is answered in the next. 2. Isa. 45.22.
and 55 5 Joh. 5.25. and 6.45. Mat. 13.12, 13, 15. Isa. 55.1, 2, 3, 4. Joh.
5.37, 40. and 16.8. 2 These. 2.10.
To Mankind when their eyes are opened; and as he opens their eyes, when light
is not only given, but their eyes opened to see; which, though before they
could not see, yet now by the power in the light that has opened their eyes,
they do see; and while it abides with them, may in seeing see. If they now do
in hearing hear, or hearken to his voice; and in seeing see, and behold him in
this discovered grace, he will save them; they shall run to Christ, and be
enabled by him to believe: a gracious promise to sinners and lost ones, in
which Men's unbelief appears to be their own wilful and great sin: all which is
fore-explained in the Purposes discovered in the Promises. 3. Ioh. 3.15, 16, 36
Mar. 16.16. Isa. 28 16. Act. 10.43. and 13.38, 39 Ioh. 11.25, 26. Romans 4, 5.23.
and 5.9.
To Men believing on Christ, that though they were dead, even chief of sinners
and ungodly ones; yet in believing in Christ, as held forth in the Gospel, and
so in his Name, in his Blood they shall not perish, but receive forgiveness of
sins, and have eternal life; yea, thus believing on him that justifies the
ungodly by the Blood of his Son, it shall be imputed to them for Righteousness.
O gracious and alluring Promises, in all which the love of God to Mankind
appears, it being the Revelation of his Purpose! etc.


And concerning all these Promises, with a favorable Interpretation Mr. Owen's
Expression may be taken for true, where he says, Page 114.3.
The Promises are made unto sinners, as sinners, and under no other
qualification whatever. So he: now except but some Promises as made to Christ,
of which he means not, but take all these forenamed, as made to Mankind
fallen, and those about sending Christ to be a Savior; and those through
Christ for extention of means and light to call and open their eyes, that Men
might repent and believe, Romans 3.9, 19, 20, 23.
were all to sinners as sinners, and under no other qualification whatever; for
they were in or under no other qualification, but all sinners without
difference in that: and whatever qualification may be conceived in opening
their eyes, and moving them to believe; yet these two sorts of Promises are
still to them as sinners, as indeed they are, and the Promises made to them
without difference as such; that in minding and believing they might receive
pardon and purgation of their sins; and yet, though they be no better then
sinners in themselves, there is in the second public Man, a price paid, an
Atonement made for them; and so they are beheld as Redemption is wrought for
them in Christ: and so the first Promises given and extended to them; and as
their eyes are opened, and their hearts moved by him in the means, the two next
sort of Promises are extended to them, that they might believe, and in
believing receive, though in themselves they be never such sinners and cursed
ones: and I suppose Mr. Owen's term of qualification, will deny nothing of
this: but for another saying of his, Page 117. Sect. 8.2.
viz. God that has promised life on believing, has promised believing on no
condition, on our parts at all, because to sinners: This is a very hard saying.
He in the other place said, The promises are made to sinners, as sinners, and
under no other qualification whatever. And after that, again he says. Were not
the promises originally made to sinners, there would never any one be found in
any other condition: yet himself has said, That God that promised life on
believing, has promised believing on no condition on our parts at all; and he
gives this as his Reason and Proof, because to sinners. Mind his saying well.
Were they not sinners to whom he promised life on believing? what force then
in his Reason, or Truth in his two other Sayings, for any to be induced to
believe? and yet no Promise of believing to be given, produced; nor any sinner
to whom it should belong; nor can he show any condition in the one, namely
sinners, to whom life is promised on believing, but the same is found in the
other, that is sinners, to whom (in God his way) the grace to believe is
promised, and they both alike sinners.

It is before shown, That for giving and sending forth Christ the Savior of
the World, the Promise was absolute, and not with, If Men believe; and so the
Promises for fitting, supporting, exalting and furnishing Christ to be such a
Savior, all depended only on the faithfulness of God: and though it was for
the good of Mankind; yet the performance of those Promises was not made with
an if men believe: and so the Promises for means to be used, and spirit sent
forth therein, to the opening of the eyes, etc. that men might believe, were
not made to be performed, if men believe, etc. all this is done, and these
Promises all to sinners, as sinners, and performed to them also, before any of
them believe, and to many that come not in to believe. But now when God has
manifested all these Promises, so graciously performed, that the ears and eyes
of Men are open, so as they hear and see, and he moves at their hearts, the
Promises then run thus: If they in seeing see, etc. if they turn at his
reproof, if they hearken and behold, he will save them, open his words, and
pour cut his Spirit to them, draw them to Christ, enable them to believe: and
what condition is this, when nothing is required, but what God has graciously
fore-given, in giving them to see? that by the same grace, they might use their
sight, Act. 17.31. Joh. 6.32. Isa. 5 5.5. 1 Pet. 1.20, 21.
he also in this discovery, as they behold, gives them an Object of Faith to
behold: and he is glorifying Christ that Object in their view, that their faith
and hope may be in him, and so giving them faith, and to believe; so that here
is nothing required, but the use of that given to that very end: the word is in
the mouth, Romans 10.8, 9. Prove. 17.16.
and in the heart, that they might believe; the price in the hand, that they
might hold it: and so. He that believes on him shall not perish, See for all
Par. 4. chapter 4.
etc. is no more Condition then the former: and as the Promise of saving and
believing, was not to the qualification of seeing; but to him to whom God gave
to see in his seeing and beholding; so this is not to the qualification of
believing; but to him to whom God is thus giving Faith in his believing, all is
thus here grace, and grace for grace; here is a Savior freely given, that
wrought salvation in the Nature of Man, and that by him means of Salvation
afforded, that has it may be made known and extended to us, and power in that
means to open our eyes, that we may behold it: and this sight given us, that in
beholding, we may be drawn in to believe; Act. 26.17, 18. Romans 10.15. 1 Cor.
3.5. 2 Cor. 3.3. 1 Pet. 1.20, 21, 22, 23, 25.
and believing afforded, that in believing we may rest on Christ, and so
receive forgiveness, etc. So that all the way here is still one Grace afforded,
that we may receive another; and that other, that we might receive another:
which, if when such divine help afforded, we willingly refuse not, will still
fit and lead us to receive more: so great, so gracious the Promises of God to
Mankind fallen: and this, or these are the Promises made and performed; in
belief or receipt whereof, Men are united to the immortal Seed; and of that,
through these born from above. And yet now for these when so born from above,
we have more Promises to take view of: concerning which Promises, Mr. Owen his
Sayings, ( That the Promises are made to sinners, as sinners, and under no
other qualification whatever; and, That if they were not originally made to
sinners, there would never any one be found in any other condition,) I know not
how to interpret them, to make them hold true in a full sense in the Promises
to be spoken of: for it is evident, That those to whom the first Branch of
Promises is made known, and the second Branch of Promises extended, and so
received, as thereby they are found believing in Christ; these, though they are
sinners, and as sinners, may still have the use of all the former Promises; and
so his Saying true in respect of those Promises still, yet are these in some
better condition, and under some better qualification also, else the Holy
Spirit would not call them, The Children of the Free Woman, The Sons of God,
Saints, and Faithful in Christ, washed, sanctified and justified, etc.
translated out of the power of darkness into the Kingdom of his dear Son: this
is a better condition, and better qualifications, then only sinners, and as
sinners: and some are brought to, and so found in other and better condition.
Besides, upon due search it will be found, That the Promises we are to treat
of, were originally made to Christ, and have their fullness of performance in
him, and are derived from him to Believers under diverse qualifications and
exercises, as appears in the next Branch.

The third Head or Branch of Promises are those to be performed to such of
Mankind fallen, after they come in to believe; and they are those that are
confirmed in Christ, made through Christ, to be derived and received from
Christ for Believers, and so through Christ to Believers, and to be received by
Believers, such as are already Believers: and in all these Promises to be
spoken of, this is taken as granted without question, they are Believers, and
have Faith already, to whom these following Promises are made: so as here is no
condition required to be sought or brought, but only the use and exercise of
that, which of it self is working, and fore-freely given; not an ear but the
use of an ear to hear, given; not an eye, but the use of an eye to see, freely
given; not a mouth, but the use of a mouth, given; not a hand, but the use of a
hand, given; not simply life from death, but the exercise of life freely
fore-given. So that here is fitness, capacity and furniture, as well as
interest to receive these Promises, and only usefulness of that given, which
apts also to usefulness required for receiving these Promises; which are not
made to all Men, nor to any Men simply as sinners, and under no other
consideration or qualification; yea, they are not directly made to any
unbelievers upon condition of believing; but only so propounded, that whoever
believes in Christ, shall in that believing receive that grace, which will
interest them in them all: so as they then appertain to him, being a Believer,
and not before; for the Promises to be spoken of, are made to Believers, the
Disciples and Scholars of Christ: and these may be ranked into four sorts: 1.
To Believers in several spiritual frames and exercises: 2. To Believers abiding
in their Faith, Confidence and Love. 3. To Believers for their abiding, etc. 4.
To Believers for receiving after they have lived and died in the Faith.

CHAP. 2.
Of Promises to them that are indeed Believers: two sorts of Promises.

1. THe first sort, as I name them, of Promises made to Believers, are the
Promises made to them in spiritual frames, fellowship, exercises and
temptations, in spiritual frames of poverty of Spirit mourning, Mat. 5.1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8. and Luke 6.20, 21.
meekness hungring and thirsting after righteousness, mercifulness, purity of
heart, gracious promises to every one of the Disciples in all these frames.
It Is evident these Promises were made only to Christ his Disciples, though in
the hearing of the multitude, to allure them to become his Disciples, that so
in becoming his Disciples, they might enjoy them: but to the Disciples, they
were expressly made and given; neither were they given to those frames and
qualifications, nor upon a condition of having them, but expressly to the
Disciples already so framed, and under such qualifications, (though in some
sense they were sinners still.) And this is clear, in comparing the places
where they are recorded together, though here one of them, and there another be
in diverse places of Scripture beside. In spiritual fellowship, when Believers
are drawn together by and in the Name of Christ, for Fellowship in the Gospel,
and Ordinances thereof, there are gracious Promises to them of his presence and
blessing Psalm. 36.8, 9. and 65.4. and 92.12, 13. Mat. 18.20.
; also there are gracious Promises to the Believers in their spiritual
exercises, as of Meditation Psa. 37.30, 31
, Prayer Joh. 16.23, 24
, hearing reading and preaching of the word Rev. i. 3. Mat. 28.20. Mar. 16.15.
; and also gracious Promises are made to Believers in their sufferings for
righteousness, and the Gospels sake, Mat. 5.11. 1 Pet. 4.13, 14. 2 Timothy 2.12.
Mat. 19.29. Mat. 10.19, 20. 1 Cor. 10.13. Isa. 43.1, 2, 3. Heb. 12.5, 11.
. yea, even when they are tempted by Men or Satan, opposing the Truth that is
in them; yea, though, as need is, God's own correcting hand be upon them; yea,
even in their bodily death, Rev. 14.13. and many-like gracious promises: these
I only quote for the Reader to search, because I know not of any opposition by
Brethren to these.

2. The second sort of Promises are to Believers, abiding in their faith,
confidence and love, and so persevering in their faith, love and noliness to
the end; and so not to any condition, but to them that have faith already, and
enough in and from the Lord, to keep them with him; he promises them in their
abiding in and with him, many gracious things to be so received; Genesis 31.3. and
32.9. 2 Chronicles. 15.2. Mat. 28.20. Jer. 42.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Hos. 6.2, 3 Heb.
3.6, 14. and 10.35, 38. 1 Pet. 2.3, 4, 5. Ephesians. 2.22. and 4.12, 16, Joh. 15.4,
8, 9, 10, 11. Psalm. 81.6, 8, 9, 10. Romans 6.11, 14. and 8.11, 12, 13, 14. Gal.
5.16. Col. 1.22, 23. and 2.6, 7. Mat. 24.13, Rev. 2.10. 2 Timothy 4.7, 8.
as to instance a few, first. That the Lord is, and will be with them; that is,
on their side, to assist and deliver them, and do them good: much like that to
the Apostles; an illustration whereof, we may have in another business in our
types: and also, That these revived Believers in following on to know, shall
know the Lord more fully; yea, also in this fast holding of, and abiding in
their Faith, they are, and remain his house, and partake more of Christ, and
shall be built more upon him, and grow up more in him, unto an holy Temple;
yea, and yet farther in this abiding, they shall bring forth much fruit, and
glorify God; yea, they shall abide in the love of Christ, and his joy be in
them, that their joy may be full; yea, if they attend still to hearken to his
voice, the Commandments shall be turned into Promises to them: so, as he will
so write his Law in their hearts, That they shall have no other God but him,
and shall open their mouth wide, and he will fill it: and though they have
flesh yet lusting in them, yet it shall not have dominion over them; nor shall
they fulfill the lusts of the flesh, but grow rooted and stablished in Christ;
yea, not only all this, but enduring and abiding faithful unto the end, even
to death, they shall be saved with an everlasting Salvation, and have the crown
of life. Are not here gracious Promises? Is there not enough in the Promiser,
and in him in whom all the Promises are Yea and Amen? And in his spiritual
presence, and in the Spirit of faith. love, power and a sound mind given them,
and the tastes of the first fruits of his graciousness dispensed to them, to
allure, hold and keep them with him; yea, to make them break forth, and say
with Peter, Joh. 6.68.
Lord, thou have the words of eternal life, and we know, and are sure, that
thou art the Christ, etc. whither should we go from thee? yea, with
contentment, and hearty desires, Psa. 73, 23, 24, 25, 26.
to say as David, Lord, who have I in heaven but thee? etc. And whereas the
flesh will be bogling, Are not all the threats and curses denounced and annexed
in the Demonstration of God's Mind against departure, a good and gracious help
for Believers to view, and therewith to oppose, terrify and silence all the
reasonings of the flesh? And when the Wisdom and Love of God has so set them
forth, even to Believers, for their good, were it not sinful, Jer. 23.16, 17,
27, 32, 33, 34.
by any dreams or colorable pretext, to steal away the Word of the Lord in
this respect from his People, counting this part of his Word a burden? Surely,
it was not well done of Mr. Owen, to alter the Words of the Apostle, Heb. 3.14.
in stead of, For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginnings of
our confidence steadfast unto the end; Page 429.
to put in, Those only are made partakers of Christ, etc. and then to add
words of his own, viz. And for the rest, they are not, etc. The Apostle not
using that Language, it is not well done of any to use it; to take away the
word (in the force of the Spirits caution, joined with his consolation) from
Believers: and that is something worse to give out, as if that said 1 Samuel
12.22. were not the consolation given to all the people to whom Samuel spoke,
to encourage them to obey his exhortation; 1 Samuel 12.20, 21.
and the threat, verse. 25. a warning not to them all, to deter them from
disobedience; but the consolation to one part of them, as godly, and the
threatening to another part of them, as wicked: and that Men might believe this,
to make the one part of them like those spoke of, Jer. 31. which speaks neither
to, nor of such a peculiar people as was then in being, (though Mr. Owen would
have Men conceive so) but of a Generation of that Nation that shall be left of
the Sword, Jer. 31.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 31, 32, 33, 34.
and found surviving, when the judgments of God have been executed on that
Nation; that then, after those days, shall be made such a peculiar people; so
it was wrongfully concluded hence by him, that the threatenings (such as in that
1 Samuel 12.25.) are only to the wicked, and not to the Saints, but to acquaint
them with the terror of the Lord, how he hates wickedness; and the Promises
only to the Saints, and not to the residue of the people, that the wicked may
know his love of goodness: how this will stand with his two Sayings before
twice mentioned, of the Promises made to sinners, as sinners, etc. I need say
nothing; but of that he says elsewhere viz. That the Saints are only wrought
on and persuaded by the love and promises of God, but not by the terror of the
Lord, and that is it they hold forth only to the wicked; affirming the same of
Paul, 2 Cor. 5.11. This is not right neither: for the very word in that Text,
with that went before, 2 Cor. 5.8, 9, 10, 11.
includes the judgment also, in which the terror is, as that which was also in
the motive of his own and other Believers being persuaded to diligence; yea,
intimates it also to have had some prevalency with the Corinthians. And plain
it is there also, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20.
That he held forth chiefly and mostly the love of God in Christ, even to
persuade unbelievers; and not the terror without it, nor but for the contempt
and refusal thereof: but no need to strive about that is so clear: who can read
that profession of Job, so often expressing it, and concluding, For destruction
from God was a terror to me, Job. 31.1, 23.
and by reason of his highness I could not endure; Psalm. 119.120.
And of David, My flesh trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy
judgments; And of Levi, that not only feared the Lord, Mal. 2.5.
but also was afraid before his Name; And of Habakkuk, Hab. 3.16.
who when he heard the voice of the judgments, his belly trembled, his lips
quivered at the voice, rottenness entered into his bones, and he trembled in
himself, that he might find rest in the day of trouble? Yea, has not God
promised, to look to him, Isa. 66.2, 5. and 28.13.
and appear to his joy, that trembles at his word, when shame shall befall
those that by devices labor to put it from themselves as not having any thing
to do with them? yet the Spirit says expressly, Prove. 28.14.
Happy is the man that fears always, but he that hardneth his heart shall fall
into mischief: yea, was not Moses thus led for Israel? Number. 22.6, 15. Josh.
22.15, 22. 1 Cor. 9.27. and 10.1, 6, 11.
and Phinehas; yea, Paul in respect of himself, and also directing all
Believers to the same. So that this fear in such as believe the Promises, is no
desperate, but a hopeful fear, as well standing with confidence, as godly
sorrow and mourning does with rejoicing in the Lord, as is seen in Job, David,
etc. So that this was rashly affirmed: and yet worst of all, that Affirmation
of this Saying, Page 221.
[God to be with us while we are with him] is a cursed liberty left Men of
departing wickedly from God: it had not been well so to affirm of that saying
of David to Abiathar, 1 Samuel 22.2 ^.
Abide thou with me, fear not; for he that seeks my life, seeks thy life;
but with me thou shall be in safety. But when God in Christ Jesus has called
people to himself, spoken peace to them in the Blood of his Son, freed them
from the charges of the Law, from the Accusations of sin, and the tyranny of
the Devil, and terrors of death, and filled them with the consolations of his
goodness, and promised them eternal life; and also told them of the malice of
Satan and the World, and how they seek to devour them, giving them this counsel
and comfort, saying, I am with you and for you, abide you in me and with me,
and I will be with you for ever; and with me, you shall be in safety: but if
you abide not in me, you will be forsaken, and lie open to all danger: Shall
any call this a cursed liberty, etc? Surely, Methinks, if they could not see
the goodness of it, yet they should forbear reviling it, knowing it to be the
very Saying of the Holy Spirit in the Prophet, 2 Chronicles. 15.2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14.
to a good King and good People, The Lord is with you while you be with him;
and if ye seek him, he will be found of you: but if you forsake him, he will
forsake you. And this they counted not a cursed, but a blessed liberty, and it
had as good a fruit in them. Ioh. 15.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
And suchlike Language used by our Savior to his chosen Disciples; who surely
would have shunned it as blasphemy, to call it a cursed liberty left Men of
departing wickedly from God: they knew it tended, and the fruit of it in
Believers, was to keep Men both humbly and confidently to God. If the saying
startled and enraged him, because it could not be answered; yet so odious a
censure trenching on God's own words, might in reverence of him, have been
forborne; let become of our Opinions what will, let God be True, and every one
that swerves from his sayings, a Liar: as for Saints, by turning aside to fall,
depart, etc. Mr. Owen, and all of his Opinion, grant, a falling may be, and a
grievous one also; yea, a departure, though not total and final, yet such as
will be visited with grievous corrections, such as may be as fire in their
bones. And we believe, and Mr. Goodwin nowhere denies, Ier. 3.6, 14, 22. Hosea
14.2, 4. Jude 22, 23.
but that there are Promises for these departed ones still, That upon God's
correcting, recalling and renewed strife with them (in which he will not be
wanting) in repenting and returning, they shall be forgiven, and received into
former favor, and renewed to former gracious consolation and hope again. What
needed then this harsh Censure? and what profits the Opinion of the
infallible certainty of the Saints perseverance, [ When some of the Saints
never attain this certainty, Page 294.
and some lose it in whole or in part; yea, many of the Saints who are not
enabled all their days, to mix the Promise of perseverance with faith, and on
that account do never all their days get free from some bondage, etc. So says
Mr. Owen:] whereas all that are justified by faith in Jesus Christ, Romans 5.1,
2. Gal. 1.1.
have peace with God, etc. What is contended for? If it were to help the Saints
to persevere, and to the Faith thereof, then Mr. Goodwin his warning of the
danger, to avoid it; and setting forth the Foundation on which they may safely
rest, and not be deceived, is more farthering that business, then the
maintaining an impossibilty of final falling, and set forth no Foundation for
Believers to rest on for it, in which they may enjoy it. And surely, these
gracious Promises given to Believers abiding in the Faith, with all the
Cautions mixed with them, are very helpful to Saints perseverance; yet seeing
there are Promises to help yet farther, I will endeavor to quote some of them
for the Reader to turn to: and mind.

CHAP. 3.
Of Promises to Believers, that they may abide in the Faith.

THe third sort of Promises are to Believers, that they may abide in their
Faith and holiness, Prove. 28.26.
and not be left to trust on their own faithfulness for their abiding; which
would be unsafe for them, and folly in them: yea, if any of them, because of
their love, faithfulness and zeal toward the Lord, or any seize got, or
resolution made should thence resolve and conclude, Isa. 50.10, 11. Mat. 26.33,
35 Romans 11, 18, 20.
and rest thereon, that they shall not depart from him or forsake him; this,
though in the best Saints, would certainly presage a fall: for their standing
and perseverance therefore, that it may be by Faith, Hab. 2.3, 4 Gal. 2.20.1
Pet. 1.5. Gal. 5.5.
and so that they may live by Faith, and be kept by the power of God through
Faith; which is the only way of attaining. God in and through Christ, has
given many gracious Promises, which being mixed with Faith in Believers, they
will be enabled to follow the Lord fully as Joshua did, and so be preserved,
till they come to the heavenly, as he did to the earthly Canaan: Psalm. 125.
for the Lord forsakes none that trust in him; they shall be as Mount Sion,
etc. Let us then search the Scripture where these Promises are.

1. Psalm. 84.12. and 29.11. and 5.12. Isa. 26.3, 4. Jer. 17.7, 8.
They are blessed that believe or trust in the Lord: he will bless them with
peace, and compass them about with favor, as with a shield, and keep them in
perfect peace, so as they shall take root, and be established, be green and
fruitful, and not wither.

2. Deuteronomy. 33.3. Ioh. 10.28, 29. Psa. 18.30. Deuteronomy. 23.25, 27. Romans 16.20. Mat.
16.18.
They are in the hands, and under the wings and protection of the Lord, and
none can pluck them out of his hands: so that he is, and will be a Buckler to
them, and an Enemy to their Enemies, and turn them back; yea, he will tread
Satan under their Feet, and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against them.

3. He will preserve and strengthen them; he will preserve their souls, Psalm.
31.23, 24. and 97.10. Prove. 2.8. Deuteronomy. 31.6. Heb. 13.5. Psa. 37.28.
their way, their feet in his way, 1 Samuel 2.9. yea, he will never leave them
nor forsake them, but preserve them for ever: so as they shall be safe through
all dangers, and set on high, etc. Psalm. 91. throughout.

4. Isa. 57.13. Psalm. 34.22.
They shall possess the promised Land, and inherit his holy Mountain; and none
of them shall be desolate.

Can any that believe Christ, and therethrough trust God in his Word, and so
believe his Promises, but that according to their Faith, they are alike
persuaded of his graciousness, power, truth and faithfulness, according to
these Promises, to preserve their Souls in Faith; and them in his Grace and way
through Faith unto Salvation, in his abundant goodness and truth?

And to help Believers to this believing and confidence, these Promises are
brought nigher to us, Romans 13.11. 2 Timothy 1.9, 10. 1 John 1.1, 2, 3.
and made more open and easy to be believed, then when first made before the
first coming of Christ, in that now,

5. Christ has come in the flesh, and Jesus is the Christ, and he, The Lord
Jesus Christ, The Son of God, The Son and Savior of Man, The Head and Brother
of all Believers; who has suffered for our sins, overcome death, offered the
acceptable Sacrifice, and is exalted and immeasurably filled in the Nature of
Man with the Holy Ghost; and in him all the Promises of God are Yea and Amen:
all the Promises are his, 2 Cor. i. 20. Joh. 1.12.13. Joh. 6.37, 38, 40 and
7.2, 6.
and to him it belongs by virtue of his purchase, and the donation of the
Father, to give the Dignity and Privileges to be the Sons of God to Believers,
and to keep, raise, and give eternal life to those, by the Fathers testifying
of him, drawn in to believe in him, as has been shown in the Declaration of
the Purposes, which are opened in the Promises.

And he, the Lord Jesus Christ, tells us plainly, That his goodness, the
choice benefits of all his sufferings, and Sacrifice, and Mediation, extends
not to the Father, to help or add any thing to his perfection; but to the
Saints that are in the Earth, Psa. 16.2, 3.
(compassed with infirmities) and to the excellent, (yea, even the Spirits of
just Men made perfect, who have not yet received all their happiness) in whom,
(namely, those Saints, both that live by Faith, and that have died in the
Faith) is all his delight. And he communicates the Privileges of Sons, to all
that believe in him; and they are born of God, and have eternal Life, Joh.
1.12, 13. 1 John 5.12, 13. Gal. 3.29 Ioh. 6.40, 45. and 10.27, 28, 29. Ioh.
14.16, 17, 26. and 15.26, 27. and 16.7, 13, 14 Romans 8.26, 23, 14, 15, 16. Psalm.
73.24.
and are Abraham's Seed, and Heirs according to Promise; and he will own them
and keep them, so as they hear his voice and follow him; and he will give them
eternal Life, and they shall not perish. And this he will do, by giving forth
into their hearts his Spirit, in and with his Word, to mind them of his
Sayings foresaid by himself, and by his Spirit in his Prophets and Apostles;
and so to testify of him, and take of the things of him, and show them; and so
glorifying him to them, he will both enable them to pray to God in his Name,
and receive Answers from him, and also witness with their Spirits, that they
are the Sons of God, and so lead them in his way into all Truth, and unto
Glory; and assures Believers in a plain Affirmation by his Spirit, both that
there is an incorruptable and undefiled inheritance that fades not, 1 Pet.
1.4, 5.
reserved in Heaven for them; and also, that they are kept by the power of God
through Faith unto Salvation: it is clear the power of God here meant, is, Romans
1.16. 1 These.
The Word of Grace he has helped them to believe, which is the power of God to
Salvation in every one that believes: and the Holy Spirit in and with that
word, which is the Hand, Luke 11.20. Act. 11.21. 1 Cor. 3.4 (...) 3. 2 (...).
3, 4. Ioh. 17.11, 12.
the Finger and power of God, the Divine Power, or power of the Divine Nature,
in and with the Gospel, which is his Name: this that by which Christ in his
Ministration kept those given him, and by which the Father and he still keeps
such. By this power of God, are Believers kept through Faith unto Salvation,
ready to be revealed in the last times: and how can it be through Faith, if the
Object of Faith se^^rth in the Word, and the influences of that Object be not
continued to them, that they may continue believing, and in believing, mix
their Faith with these Promises, and so be united to and with Christ in the
Promises? or how can it be through Faith, if they also do not in the belief of
the Grace, Power, Truth and Faithfulness of God, which they have been helped to
see and believe, in believing the Testimony of his love in the gift of Christ,
and in his Blood shed for them when they were Enemies, Romans 5.6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Tit. 3.4.5, 6, 7. Gal. 5.5.6. and 6.6. Hab. 2.4. Romans 1.17. Gal. 3.11. Heb.
10.38. Ioh. 3.36. Romans 4.13, 16.
even from thence believe and rely on him for all that Grace and Life, which
he has promised, and so mix Faith with, or be united by Faith to the Promises?
This being the professed way of the Believers confidence, growth, expectation
and perseverance to the inheritance; yea, this the way of the Believers living,
in being justified and so preserved to the enjoyment of the inheritance
promised; till which time there is no other way for the just to live, but by
Faith, and by Faith they shall live; and God has appointed this to be by
Faith, even to this end, That it may be by Grace, and that the Promise may be
sure to all the Seed. And indeed, it can no other way be sure nor is there need
of any other assurance of perseverance to the inheritance, then the assurance
of Faith, even the assurance that Faith in the Object gives, and Faith in
believing receives, when through the belief of the Love of God to sinners,
appears, Romans 4.17, 25. and 5.1, 2, 5, 6. Isa. 28.6. 1 Pet. 2.6. 2 Timothy 1.12.
and 4.18. 2 Cor. 5.1.
in having given his Son Christ to die for their sins; and being therethrough
led to believe in God for performing his Promises; and so mix Faith with the
Promises. This the Faith of Abraham, of which Faith, and assurance of hope
therein, none that have it, will or need to be ashamed: for sure here are
Promises enough, confirmed enough in Christ for Believers to mix with Faith,
and so trust in God, even for keeping and preserving them: and as he does
enough to keep them trusting in him, so he will never fail or forsake any that
trust in him.

But alas, will some say, this is comfortable to them that in believing do mix
Faith with these Promises for their perseverance, and so trust in God: but we
are not able in and by all we believe, to mix Faith with these Promises, and so
to rest patiently on God for our perseverance; yea, we are not sure the Faith
we have is such, but that we may fall from it.

To whom I answer, If thou believe the Testimony of Christ, as given in the
Gospel, thou shall be saved: and in this belief, abiding in him, thou shall not
miss, but find his Grace enabling thee to mix Faith with these promises for
perseverance: and to help thee, and all that believe Jesus to be the Christ,
Here is yet farther provision for thee in the precious Promises, to lead thee
on, and so enable thee to mix thy Faith with the Promises: and these helps,
though all to one gracious end, yet in some respects they are diverse and
manifold, yet meeting in one, to lead thee to unite thy Faith with these
Promises: only before I mention them, take this Coveat, that an Opinion of an
impossibility of one that does once truly and indeed believe, to fall away
again from the Faith, is none of the helps given thee in Scripture; nor is this
Saying, That many of the Saints are not enabled all their days to mix the
Promises of perseverance with Faith; and on that account do never get Freedom
from Bondage, any of the helps given; nor will the holding of an Opinion, that
all true Believers and Saints shall certainly persevere, bring those Saints to
the heavenly rest and inheritance, which never are united by Faith to the
Promises; yea, even the Promises thereof; and so have not their Faith mixed
with the Promises. The Apostle is plain in this, desi^ing the Saints, That he
and the residue that knew this, might without offence-taking by the Saints have
leave and liberty to fear lest a promise being left of entering into his rest,
any of those Saints he wrote to, should seem to come short of it; and the very
Ground of his fear, was, lest this Promise should not be mixed with Faith, in
every of the Saints that had heard it; alleging That the cause of others
falling short and not profi^ing, because the word heard was not mixed with
Faith in them that heard. And indeed, the Holy Ghost does not lead his
instruments, to daub up any with untempered motter, as if they may be Saints
that shall infallibly persevere, and yet never be able all their days to n^^
Faith with the Promises of perseverance etc. But he afforde^^ directions and
helps to Believers that they may in believing mix (not reasonings, but) Faith
with the Promises; and so live, neither by presumption, nor sense, but by
Faith. And so in love are many Helps given them, which also have the Nature of
Promises, and many Promises in them: and they may be comprehended in these four
Heads or Branches, namely: 1. Caution. 2. Instruction. 3. Assurance, 4. Inward
Helpfulness. Consider them.

CHAP. 4.
Of the Helps to mix Faith with the Promises, and so to persevere.

IT has pleased the Lord in his great love to afford and give many Helps to
Believers, that they may mix Faith with the Promises, and persevere.

I. Joshua 24.20. 2 Chronicles. 15.2. Prove. 1.8, 9. and 4.2, 6, 20, 24. Jer. 17.13
Ezekiel. 33.5, 11. Prove. 15.10. Psa. 141.5.
The first Help is Caution and Warning, that they depart not from him, but
abide believing; and so he has warned them of that which will, if not avoided,
hinder and turn aside; and therewith discovered the danger thereof, that they
may both avoid it, and be preserved. And though these things be grievous to
those that are out of the way, yet they are very profitable to those that love
righteousness: and in this manner, to this gracious end, the Lord has warned
us, 1. Heb. 3.7, 12, 15, 16. and 10.35, 38. Phil. 2.14.
To take heed of hardening our hearts, from hearing his Voice, (by fleshly
Reasonings, or foolish Questions, as they Joh. 6. or Murmurings;) and so to
beware of an evil heart of unbelief, which leads to depart from the living God.
2. Heb. 3.13. and 12.16, 17. Romans 8.13 and 13.11, 14. Gal. 6.8. Prove. 11.2. and
16.18. and 29.23. Romans 11.20, 21.
To beware of the deceitfulness of sin, and so of those special sins, that will
harden the heart, and lead to unbelief and falling away; as of profaneness, and
provision making for the flesh to fulfill the lusts of thereof, and so of sowing
to it; and so of those sins that seem more spiritual, as pride of Parts, Gifts,
Receipts. Seize; and of vainglory, in love and desire of praise of Men,
Gal. 5.26. Phil. 2.3. Joh. 5.44. with 12.43, 44. 3. Prove. 1.10. and 9.13, 18.
and 14.7. and 19.27. Isa. 55.2. Romans 9.31, 32, 33. and 10.2, 3. Gal. 4.19, 23.
Luke 18.9, 11, 14. Isa. 65.3, 4, 5.
To beware of a more subtle mischief, namely, That we do neither of our selves,
nor by the allurements and fair words of others, seek life in a wrong way, by
eating that which is not good, to get refreshing and consolation to our Souls.
And so he has warned us, That we feed not on the works of Righteousness of our
own endeavoring by the Law of works, conceiting to have the Righteousness of
God thereby, and so presuming as the Pharisees did, we have Grace, and are
elect, and upon that account, worship and praise God, and hope for eternal
life: this is to sacrifice in the Gardens, and burn incense upon Altars of
Brick, and drink in vanity in conceits of our own holiness, and despising
others; a thing loathed of God: such eat Swines-flesh, of which we are warned:
yea, more still: 4. Mic. 2.10 Isa. 4.1.
He has warned us of an evil more secret and subtle then the former; namely,
That we feed not upon any thing that has blemish or defilement in it; for that
is neither the rest nor the bread of life that he has given us; nor any thing
is that, which is directly our own, how goodly soever appearing, and what
change soever it has wrought in us; as inward sorrow, and brokenness of heart
for our sins, and some suitable mortification of, and abstaining from, or death
to sin, and some suitable vivification and quickening in zeal toward, love of,
desire after, 2 Cor. 10.7, 12, 18. and 13.5.
and delight in holy Duties, and Societies; and some suitable performances and
fruits, in prayer, hearing, just and equitable walking: when these are all
found, and also by others approved right; yet are not these to be fed on for
life and satisfying, in exercising our thoughts on them: from thence concluding
and trusting, That we are Christ's, and so elect, and upon that account to hope
for eternal life. Surely, there is yet wants and defilements in us in all this
sorrow, brokenness, mortification, vivification and performances; so that if
any of us think not fit to confess of our Righteousness in this, with the
Prophet, It is a defiled clout; yet we cannot but confess with the Apostle, We
are not thereby justified: Isa. 64.6. 1 Cor. 4.4.
and if any refuse so to confess, they cannot free themselves from that charge
of the Prophet Isaiah. A dangerous feeding, beware of it; Isa. 65.4. and 66.17.
and yet, 5. He has warned us of a deceit more secret and subtle then these,
which to some appears as the Bread of life to feed on; and that is, when in
waiting and looking for some such thing, there comes into the fancy or
thoughts; yea, to some to their heart, some particular Word or Promise of God
that is in the Scripture: to let pass such as come into the fancy and thoughts
only, as knowing none but fools and unbelievers will deceive themselves to
trust and rely on such motions and thoughts, Prove. 14.15.
nor yet to speak of such words as may be cast in by a Satanical Spirit;
because, when so they tend to pride or presumptuous confidence, Mat. 4.6. Mar.
1.24. Act. 16.17.
withdrawing from attending on Christ in his way and Ordinances; and so true
Believers will be fearful of entertaining them: but those that are hinted by
the good and Holy Spirit; yea, and that in mercy for gracious ends, even to
draw to Christ, and so uphold their fainting Spirits; but not for them to rest
upon the in-giving of such a word to them, and their certain receipt thereof
from God; and so to feed on that, and on that account to conclude their
Election before time, and their assurance of never falling away; but having
eternal life, and persevering to the inheritance: for when time was that the
Holy Ghost was not given in the full Revelation of the Mystery of Christ, and
so this in-giving of some particular words more in use; yet though personally
given to any one Man, It had this Caution with it, Ezekiel. 18. and 33.
If I say to the righteous, (which can be no less then one justified in some
sense) That he shall surely live; which could not be in any righteousness of
his own by the Law of works) if he trust to his own righteousness, (mark the
fruit of such trusting) and commit iniquity, etc. he shall die. What hurt
confidence in our receipt of such words has done me and others, I need not here
repeat; and how it apts some after, over-greedily to receive any thing that
comes with a shine and spiritual fervor, I will not here say. But this it is I
am now to say, That Christ has come in the flesh, and is he in whom all the
Promises of God are Yea and Amen: and now he is given and set forth in the
Gospel to us, for Light, Law, Covenant, Promise, and witness of God's Love to
us. This the Testimony and the in-giving of a particular word, an inferior
Testimony, and not so usual now; yet God tendering us in our infancy,
vouchsafing such speaking Inspirations to us for good, to draw us to look more
to his Son to rest on him, if we sit down and take up our rest in these
speakings short of him, we shall turn that which was for our welfare into a
snare: but of this he has mercifully forewarned us, in making known to us,
That without his bloodshedding, there could have been no Remission for us; and
without the same in the virtue of it sprinkled upon our hearts, there can be no
forgiveness received by us; and that he himself, as he was crucified for our
sins, and is risen in our Nature just, for our justification, and is now at the
right hand of God appearing in our Nature for us; even so he, and he only, is
the object held forth for healing and life, the Revealer of the Father's Mind,
the only Foundation to rest on, and Bread of Life to feed on: and so herein
has warned us of this, and all the former deceits: for, as Paul to some
miscarrying said of himself, 1 Cor. 1.13.
Was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the Name of Paul? so it
may be said, Was any of your Works of righteousness? or was your brokenness,
mortification, vivification and performances? or was an inspiration to you, and
receipt by you crucified, and made a curse for you? did any of these die for
your sins, and rise for your justification, and give the ransom and sacrifice
for you? or were or could you according to the commission of Christ be baptized
in the Name of any of these? Surely no: therefore none of these can be your
bottom or foundation to rest on, nor the true Bread of life for you to feed on?
Nor will you say, The eternal Purpose of God and his Election was made sin and
a curse for you, and so crucified, dead and buried for you, and raised and
offered in sacrifice for you, and so not the first thing appearing, the bottom
and foundation to rest on, the real Bread of life to feed on; but Christ only,
who did all this according to Purpose, being God's Elect, etc. and has not God
discovered his love to us, and his unwillingness that we should perish, and his
readiness to receive, retain, help and save us, by giving us these warnings,
and helping us with such things to awe and terrify the flesh, and to resist
all Doctrines and Spirits of Delusion? And is there not in the same warnings
given, 2 Cor. 15.1, 2, 15. Ezekiel. 18. and 33.1, 9, 10, 11, 19. Joh. 15.1, 2, 15
an intimate and sure Promise, That if we according to the light and strength
he gives us, avoid these lets and pull-backs, he will follow on with more
Grace, and enable us in believing to mix the Promises with Faith? See the
Scriptures: and so these Warnings are one good Help. Another is,


II. Instruction to the business of mixing the word with Faith, Isa. 55.2, 3, 4.
that so we may live indeed by Faith; and that is by eating that which is good,
and letting our Soul delight it self in fatness, so we shall be verily fed with
the sure mercies of David. In which Instruction we have three things explained
by Christ for our Help.

1. That it is good and fatness, meat ready prepared, nothing of our provision,
Prove. 9.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Mat. 22.1, 2, 3, 4. Luke 14.17. Isa. 55.1, 2, 3. Joh.
6.27, 29, 32.
that has any blemish or want in it, nor only a Purpose and Promise of
something to be done, but a real business, and heavenly substance prepared, and
according to Purpose and Promise fulfilled; a Sacrifice that was slain, and the
blood shed, and the Sacrifice offered to God; and so Peace made, Redemption
obtained, Spirit received, and Promises confirmed by his Blood; and so in this
bread of life, and wine mingled, all provided, ready and set sorth, and all,
even the worst of sinners called to it, and have liberty to come; and all
comers freely to eat of this good and fatness. 2. 1 Cor. 15.1, 4. Romans 4.25. 1 Timothy 2.5, 6. Col. 1.23, 24. Heb. 9.12, 14. and 10.5, 10. Ioh. 6.27, 33, 35, 48,
50, 51. Joh. 18.37 Mat. 26.28. Heb. 9.15, 16, 17. Prove. 9.2, 5. Joh. 6.51, 53,
54, 55, 56, 67.
That Jesus Christ himself, as he was wounded for our transgressions, died for
our sins, and rose for our justification, and offered up himself a spotless
sacrifice to God for us, and so redeemed us from the curse of the Law, obtained
eternal Redemption, and is now alive for ever in our Nature, appearing before
God for us, to present us in that Body of his, etc. so he is the very bread of
life, and his flesh is meat indeed. And as by his sufferings and
bloodshedding, he did both witness the Truth, and confirm the New Testament of
precious Promises; and being risen and ascended, ever lives a Mediator of this
New Testament by virtue of his blood. That the Called may receive, etc. so his
blood is drink indeed, and this tender of it, wine mingled. And this in Christ,
is the provision given us to feed on; all other things beside, tendered by any,
or conceived by us to be sed on for life, are in that respect vanity and
deceit: and unless we do eat of this flesh of Christ, and drink of his blood,
there will be no life in us; but in feeding on this, we shall live for ever. 3.
That the manner of our eating that which is good and fatness in feeding on him,
Joh. 6.27, 29, 33, 51.
is not only in believing him the Savior sent of God, and sealed by God to
give eternal life: but also, that in this believing, we believe him the Savior
of the World, that gave his flesh for the life of the World, and gives life
unto the World; and so in exercise of this Faith, eat or feed on him: by
minding and serious confidering, believing resting, and taking our
well-pleasedness and satisfying in him, his flesh, his body that was broken,
and died for our sins, and is riseh for our justification, and offered up a
sacrifice to God for us, in that he has done all this for the sins of the
World, for Mankind, sinners, enemies; and so has made an Atonement, and
redeemed them from the curse of the Law, and procured all Mankind into his
dispose; Joh. 6.33. and 1.4, 5. Romans 5.18. Romans 2.4. Joh. 1.5, 8, 9. Eccles.
9.4.
so that by him their lives are prolonged, and God will neither now nor
hereafter judge them by that Law, nor cause them to perish for ever in that
death they fell under in that first Adam; which judgment and death Christ has
undergone and overcome for them: and by virtue thereof, in his Mediation
procures patience and forbearance, that they are not suddenly cut off for
their transgressions against him; yea, he uses means toward them that they
might believe in him, who is the Propitiation for their sins; in whom
believing, they shall not perish, but have everlasting life; which yet they
have not, though in him there is yet hope for them: and this is the life of the
World, and this is the kindeness and love of God to Mankind, Tit 3.4, 5.
which according to his mercy appearing saves the Beholders with the Laver of
Regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost: and his flesh thus beheld and fed
on, and considered as the love of God in thus giving him, and his so dying for
his Enemies, appears, is that which draws in to believe, Romans 3.9, 21, 25. 1 Timothy 1.14, 15, 16. 2 Cor. 5.19, 20. Tit. 3.4.
at that door, in which one is found no better then the chief of sinners; and
being drawn in to believe, the still believing, beholding, considering and
feeding on the same; so great love appearing in this sacrifice of Christ, and
the fullness in it for sinners, Romans 5.8, 10, 11.
and chief of sinners, draws the heart to confide in him for farther salvation,
and so to be saved by his life, and everliving to intercede and send forth
Spirit: so feeding on his flesh that was given for, and as given for the life
of the World, livingness is found; Luke 22.20. Mat. 26.28. 1 John 2.2. Heb.
9.14, 15, 17. Joh. 6.51, 54, 57. and 11.25, 26. Romans 4.5, 22, 23, 25. and 5.6.
Romans 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
in which living and believing, they see his precious Promises as sealed and
confirmed by the same precious blood of his that was shed for the Remission of
their sins, and the sins of many; yea, of the World: and so they drink of his
blood, and therein mix the Promises with Faith, and so live by Faith; yea, in
this manner believing on him, that justifies the ungodly through Christ, that
died for the ungodly, their Faith is not only imputed to them for
righteousness; but their Faith is herein so united to the Promises, that it
springs up in peace, in boldness of access to God, and hope of the glory to be
revealed, and will in time, to that rejoicing, hope and assurance mentioned,
Romans 8.32, 36. which is the assurance of Faith. O sweet, safe and comfortable
direction! and he that by Grace, to avoid the forewarned hindrances, and
eating bread in secret places, and drinking stolen waters (as all are that
flow not from Christ first known and believed) is prevailed with, and in that
avoiding to come in and rest and feed upon Christ crucified, as is said, will
find so much assurance of Faith, as he dares trust God, without any other
pawns and pledges, then he has given in and through Christ already; in whom he
has given to Believers assurance: of which next.
III. Assurance: The Assurance that God has provided for, and given to
Believers for their preservation through Faith unto Salvation ready to be
revealed in the last time, in the enjoyment of the inheritance: and this is
also clear, great and manifold, as to say, 1. Genesis 22.16, 17, 18. 1 Cor. 16.15,
16, 17, 18. Psalm. 105.8, 9, 10, 11. Gal. 3.15, 16, 17. Heb. 6.13, 14, 15, 18.
The Word or Promise, and Oath of God, that was fore-confirmed in Christ, and
then through him given, and made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the Fathers of
the faithful following, that Believers as their Children and Heirs might in
minding that Word and Covenant firmed with an Oath have strong consolation and
sure hope. 2. The same brought nearer to us, in that which Christ has done and
suffered for us, Heb. 6.20. Isa. 42.6. and 49.8. Gal. 3.26, 29, 1 Timothy ^.1.
who is now entered in our Nature into the Holiest, having begun to take
possession for us, being given and set forth in the Gospel for the Covenant to
us; that so believing in him, we are Sons and Heirs; and he being our hope, and
so our hope anchoring in him, enters within the veil, and is both sure and
steadfast, Heb. 6.18, 19, 20. Phil. 1.20. 1 John 3.1, 2, 3. 3. Heb. 10.10, 12,
14, 18, 19. and 8.1, 6, 11. and 9.14, 15. and 7.25.
The Mediation of Christ, and Ministration of the New Testament of precious
Promises, by virtue of his blood and sacrifice; in which he has opened the
passage for us; and all to this end, That the Called may receive the promised
inheritance, his Mediation being acceptable and prevalent with the Father; and
he ever lives to make Intercession for them that come to God by him and so he
is able to save them to the utmost. 4. Heb. 8.10, 11. 2 Cor. 3.3. Romans 8.23.
Ephesians. 1.13, 14. and 4.30.
This as a secondary and sealing Confirmation, and in some respects sensible,
is added, even the first fruits of the Spirit in some spiritual performances of
some part of that contained in the New Testament and everlasting Covenant, as
an added seal and earnest of our present interest, and after-possession of the
inheritance. And is not all this Assurance enough for any that believe in
Christ? and so in God through Christ, to keep them trusting in him? But I
proceed.


IV. An inward Helpfulness, Ezekiel. 36.25, 26, 27. Ephesians. 4.21, 24. Col. 3. Romans
8.9, 11. 1 Cor. 2.16. 2 Cor. 3.3.
affording motion and ability to mix the Premises with Faith, and thereby to
overturn all oppofition: which helpfulness is a new Man a new Heart, or new
Spirit, even the mind, disposition and Spirit of Christ, within them, as an
inward lving principle, moving and acting within them, and enabling them to
move and act in its movings and actings. This not naturally and originally in
them, as the righteous disposition at first inspired to the first Adam in his
innocence; and so not having its being of its self in them, which would neither
be so profitable nor safe for them (as now it is) for so they might as easily
neglect its operation and lose it again, as our first Father Adam did: nor is
it in them like the light that shines into an house from a Torch passing by
the Windows, nor as a flash of lightning, suddenly coming, and suddenly
vanishing; but as Water from a Fountain, naturally and continually flowing
forth and streaming into the Chanel or Vessel; and as light proceeding from the
Sun into an house, filling it with light that remains, both in the Sun, and
from the influence of the Sun remains in the house, filling it with an
abiding light, unless some wilfully shut all the windows, and stop all the
crannies about the house; by which they cannot keep in, but shut out the light;
yet the light remains in the Sun that sends forth his influences, and cannot
be divided from it; nor fails any of light that suffers it to enter, and
remain as an influence from the Sun: So Christ is the Fountain of living
Waters, Psa. 36.9. Jer. 17.13. Mal. 4.2. Col. 2.3, 9. Joh. 1.16.
of Light, Life, and Spirit, the Sun of Righteousness, in whom all Light, Life
and quickening is, in whom the fullness of the Spirit of life is, and from whom
it flows; and so those that through Grace believe on him, receive of his
fullness, and see light in his light; and so in beholding of, and believing in
him, the same Spirit that is in him flows into them, Joh. 3.6.
and effects the mind and disposition of Christ in them, which is also
called Spirit: in which respect Christ is said to dwell in them, and the Holy
Spirit is said to dwell in them: who as proceeding from Christ, and remaining
in him; so he enters their hearts, and works this new Spirit or disposition
in them, and by his light and operations dwells in it, and so in them: and
this Spirit effected in them, and dwelling in them, they have derivatively from
Christ, and it cannot be had divided from him; but they believing in him, Ephesians.
3.16, 17.
have it of and from him, and him within and by it: and so they have him and
this Spirit of and from him in their hearts by Faith, 2 Cor. 4.13. 2 Timothy 1.7.
1 Ioh. 4.4.
and it is in them, a Spirit of Faith, the Spirit of Power, of Love, and of a
sound mind; and this Spirit dwelling in them, is greater and stronger then the
Devil that is in the World; so that they may full readily mix the Promises with
Faith; 1 Ioh. 5.4, 5.
yea, and believing in the Son of God, overcome the World, their Faith being
their Victory, whereby they overcome.

And thus we have seen, the Promises to Believers in their spiritual frames and
exercises are many, the Promises to them abiding in the Faith given them, are
many; the Promises that they may abide, many; and the helps for their abiding,
many; and all gracious from the Almighty God of Truth, through the Mediator to
Believers, to whom Faith is given, that they may; and whoever as they may mix
the Promises with Faith, and so accepts the Grace given, may have the
Assurance of Faith, even for his perseverance, in which the following Promises
will be still farther helpful also: let them be considered.

CHAP. 5.
Of the Promises to be fulfilled to Believers after this Life

THe fourth sort of Promises, are those which are to be performed to Believers
when they have lived and died in the Faith, when their Battle is fought, their
Race run: and so they have finished their Course, and kept the Faith, and so
overcome. The Promises to be then performed to them, be great, precious, and of
three sorts: 1. Such as are to be performed to them at their death, as all
shall, but such as survive at the coming of the Lord, to whom such Promises not
needful, nor suffer they loss. 2. Such as are to be performed at the
Resurrection of the Just, in the personal coming of the Lord. 3. Such as are to
be performed when Christ delivers up the Kingdom to God the Father; and so God
is All in all: I shall according to what I find, hint somewhat of each.

I. For the Promises that shall be performed to Believers at their death; 1.
They shall rest from their labors, sorrows, Rev. 14.13. Isa. 26.20, 21. and
57.2. Ioh. 3.17, 18. Zach. 9.11, 12. 1 These. 4.14. Ioh 17.13, 16. and 19.25, 27.
combats with temptations, being kept as in Chambers of safety, till the
indignation in which the inhabitants of the earth shall be punished, have gone
over them all; yea, they shall enter into peace, their bodies resting in the
earth, in their several places, as in beds of peace: and though in respect of
the enjoyment of the great hope, their bodies be as Prisoners, yet are they at
rest, and free from all trouble and fear; and so Prisoners of hope that sleep
in Jesus, and shall be raised at his coming, to see him, and come with him: so
it is a blessed sleep and rest. 2. Their Spirits or Souls shall walk in their
uprightness in the presence of Christ, their Righteousness, and under his
Wings, Isa. 52.2. Rev. 6.9, 10, 11. Phil. 1.21, 23. 2 Cor. 5.1, 2, 6, 7, 8.
as the Altar of safety and solace, enjoying a more full sight of the Person of
the Lord Jesus, and being nigher, and having more full fellowship, with greater
rejoycings in him, and with him, and with the Spirits of just Men made perfect,
(of which they now are) then ever they did or could have enjoyed, Heb. 6.12,
15. and 4.3, 4, 10.
while they were in mortal bodies: in which respect, as touching their Souls,
they may be said to inherit the Promises, to enter into rest; and in both these
respects, the day of their death is better to them then the day of their birth
was. 3. Their works do follow them; Rev. 14.13. Ioh. 15.16. 2 Pet. 1.15. 1 Timothy
6.14. 2 Ioh. 8. 1 These. 2.19, 20. 2 Cor. 10.15, 16. Heb. 11.4. and 12.1.
that which through Faith working by love they have done in their preaching the
Testimony of Christ, their works of mercy, their prayers, their sufferings, and
constancy therein, in bearing witness to the Truth, and against Antichrist,
have not only had their fruits for holding forth the Faith, and winning in
others to God, in their lifetime, but in the efficacy of the Truth witnessed
by them in preaching and suffering, in answer of their prayers, and the memory
of their good examples, their fruits shall remain; yea, also multiply and
increase upon their account after their decease.


II. For the Promises to be performed to them at the coming of the Lord Jesus
in and at the Resurrection of the Just, they are of great and glorious things;
as to instance some of them.

1. Their Bodies shall be raised again, not corruptible, 1 Cor. 15, 23, 42, 45,
52. 1 These. 4.16. Phil. 3.21. Mat. 22.30.
weak and mortal, as before they had been; but incorruptible, powerful,
immortal and glorious at the very coming of Christ; yea, so as they shall be as
the Angels of God; though not Angels and Spirits only, Mar. 15.25 Luke 20.35,
36 Romans 8.23.
yet as the Angels, and spiritual, equal to the Angels; for impossibility of
dying or falling, for strength, agility, swiftness of motion in ascending or
descending and moving every way. Thus shall their bodies be raised, and united
to and possessed of their own perfect Souls or Spirits for ever, being both
moved and carried about by the divine power. 2. 1 These. 4.17 Isa. 9.4, 5, 6.
and 11.4. and 30.27, 28 and 60.12. Zach. 14.5. 2 Pet. 3.7. See Part 2, chapter 17.
Being so raised and made spiritual and glorious in Soul and Body, they shall
in a moment ascend, and meet the Lord in the Air, and so be ever with him; yea,
come along with him to that great Battle, in which shall be no carnal Sword, no
confusion, no garments of any Saints rolled in blood; and yet the perdition and
destruction of ungodly Men; yea, of all that then will not serve Christ and his
people; yea, all the Saints with him shall have this honor, To execute
vengeance upon the Heathen, to bind their Kings, etc. as is said. 3. Jer.
3.17, 18. Ezekiel. 30.24. and 37.21, 22. Isa. 52.8. Jer. 33.7, 8, 9. Isa. 19.24,
25. Jer. 48.47. and 49.6, 7. Romans 11.15, 26, 27. Psa. 126.1, 2. Heb. 8.10, 11.
Jer. 31.31, 33, 34. and 32.38, 39, 40, 41 Ezekiel. 37.24, 28.
Yea, they shall also be with him, and see the natural Seed of Abraham that are
at that time found surviving of the whole twelve Tribes of Israel from all the
utmost parts of the World, come into their own Land; yea, then will that be
fully performed that is promised, 2 Samuel 7.10, 13. Isa. 11.11, 16. Jer. 31.8,
9. And they shall not only see this, but they shall also see of other Nations
come in together with them, to worship God, as Egypt and Assyria, and of Moab,
and Ammon, and Elam; yea, of all Nations that shall be left living upon the
Earth, Psalm. 66.4. and 89.9. O joyful sight! what can this be to such, as love
God, less then life from dead, and ravishing and satisfying joy? and yet this
is not all: for then also being with the Lord, they shall themselves receive of
the Lord the full of the Covenant and Testament, he in the day of grace was for
and to them, being the Mediator of that Testament in their behalf, and the
Minister thereof, giving in a spiritual first fruits to their Spirits; but now
openly making it in performance both to Soul and Body: and they shall also see
it made with the whole house of Israel, as it was fore-made for them, with
their Fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; yea, in a fuller sense, because not to
be looked and waited for by Faith then, but to be enjoyed in performance, both
to their Fathers and them: so as they shall then all know the Lord, and there
will be no more any remembrance of their sins by him; they shall have no more
any hunger, thirst, pain, or any sorrow. 4. Then also shall they see Jerusalem,
that great City, Psa. 128.5. Isa. 33.20. and 66.13 Jer. 3.17. Isa 9.7 and 24.23
Luke 1.32, 33 Dan. 7.14 Psa. 72.8, 9, 10, 11. and 106.5. Isa. 65.17. 2 Pet.
3.13. Isa. 9.6, 7. and 11.1, 9. Psa. 72. and 75.1, 2, 3. Heb. 2.8. Psalm. 8.4,
5, 9. Romans 8.21, 22.
the praise of the Earth, the Throne of the Lord, a quiet Habitation; yea, then
and there shall they see Jesus Christ in his glorious Body, The Son of David,
The King in his Beauty and Glory, sitting upon the Throne of David his Father,
and ruling before his Ancients gloriously in Jerusalem, and over all the
Nations and Kingdoms of the Earth under the whole Heavens; then shall they see
the good of his chosen, and rejoice in the gladness of his Nation, and Glory
with his Inheritance; for then they shall have a new Heaven and new Earth,
wherein dwells Righteousness, the Creation restored to its purity, the light of
the Sun, as the light of seven days, the Earth bringing forth plentiful
increase, and all Creatures at peace among themselves, the people among them
all righteous, and not one suffered to live among all Nations that shall rebel
against them, and all Righteousness, and Peace and Prosperity streaming among
them, through the blessed Restoration by, and Government of the Lord Jesus
Christ the King. 5. The Tabernacle of God, Jesus Christ in whom the fullness of
the Godhead dwells bodily, and the holy City, Rev. 21.1, 5. and 1.6. and
5.10. 2 Timothy 2.12. Mat. 19.28, 29. Luke 19.17, 19.
(which are these that have died in the Faith being risen, and meeting the Lord
in the Air) comes down from Heaven, in which God then dwells with Men, having
made all things new; and now shall these Children of the Resurrection, be
Kings, and Princes, and chief Rulers in the Commonwealth of Israel, and shall
judge or govern the World, and rule the Nations, and so reign in this
flourishing Kingdom, with Christ on whom they have believed, and with whom they
have suffered; yea, now the Lord Jesus, the King of Kings, as he has secured
them from any hurt by the second death; Rev. 2.11. and 20.6. and 3.5.21. and
2.7, 17. and 22.14. Mat. 10.41, 42. Luke 14.14. Mat. 29.29 Rev. 7.13, 17. and
11.18.
so he will give unto them to sit with him in white raiment on his Throne, and
give them a new white Stone, with a new Name, (even of Victory) in it, and to
eat of the hidden Manna, and of the Tree of Life; yea, also Rewards according
to all their services and sufferings for his sake; yea, the Kingdoms under the
whole Heavens, shall be given to the people of the Saints, Dan. 7.27. Rev.
21.24. 6. Isa. 66.10, 23. Psalm. 72.
Their exercise shall be a joyful and continual Sabbath-keeping with the Lord,
in singing Hallelujahs and new Songs of praise: and all Nations shall
acknowledge them, The beloved and blessed of the Lord; Isa. 60.3, 14. and 61.9.
1 John 3.2, 1 Cor. 13.12. Phil 3.20. Col. 3.4.
yea, they seeing Christ as he is, and as they are seen, they shall be like
him; but how glorious this estate will be, is not yet manifested, and so beyond
our conceptions; but only that we know that we are now Sons, and that in a
measure, we shall be then like him in glory. And all these things may be seen
more at large before, in Part 2. chapter 18.
III. For the Promises to be performed to them when Christ shall have finished
the work of the Davidical Regiment, raised and judged all the Serpentine Seed,
and cast the Devil and his Angels, and all the Enemies, the wicked, into the
Lake of Fire; and then delivered up the Kingdom to God, even the Father: the
Promises to be then performed, I find no other but an Ascension or increase of
this happiness and glory, in God being All in all: only this I find, That the
Kingdom shall never end, Dan. 7.14, 27. Isa. 9.7. and 60.19, 20. and 61.7. Luke
18.30. 1 Cor. 15.28. Psalm. 16.11.
never pass to another people, they shall be ever with the Lord, and
everlasting joy shall be upon them, and they shall be in everlasting life for
ever, and for ever; only the administration of the Government is exalted or
ascended higher, so as God is All in all: in whose presence is fullness of joy,
and at whose right Hand are pleasures for evermore: that this is, and that so
it shall be, is expressed, and so most certain and sure; but what manner of glory
it will be, is not yet revealed, nor will be till Jesus Christ come and take
unto him his great Power and Reign.

And these be part of the Promises made to Believers, to be performed to them,
2 Timothy 4.8.
after they have finished their course, and at the coming of Christ: and if
Believers do well mind these Promises, Romans 8.18. Heb. 11.25, 26, 27
it will cause all services and sufferings for Christ to appear but a little
matter to be born; yea, it will lead to count sufferings for Christ greater
riches then all the treasures of this World, and strengthen them to endure, as
seeing him that is visible; in which, while these Promises are believingly
viewed, 2 Cor. 4.16, 17, 18.
our afflictions will work for us, a far more exceeding weight of glory; yea,
should temptation come so fiercely, as to dazzle the eye, Psa. 116.3, 11. and
31.22, 23, 24 and 56.4, 10, 11.
or daunt the courage of our believing, so as we fainted in the exercise of our
Faith; yet the minding of these Promises, sealed by him that shed his Blood for
us, would make us cry to him in that fainting, and he would hear us, and help
us, comfort, and enable us to comfort our selves in his word. And will they not
then allure and help to perseverance? Surely, Yes.

And thus I have briefly hinted the Promises of God through Christ to Mankind,
to Mankind believing, to Believers in each condition, and to them; and
Promises to be received after this life: which heartily believed, it would lead
to cleanse from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, 2 Cor. 1.1. and 5.1. 1 John
2.24, 25.
and to perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord; it would lead to
perseverance, and to cause to long and wait for our House from Heaven.

In all which we see, That the Promises of God, and the Purposes of God, and
the Testimony of God concerning Christ, are all one and the same Doctrine,
declare the same thing, the same mind of God by diversity of expressions,
setting forth and closing together in one and the same Truth: and so, as the
knowledge and usefulness of and in any one, will be found the same of and in
each and every one; yet I, to evidence this, will a little go over what has
already been shown, in usefulness of the Testimony of Christ, and of the
Purposes, to show how we are taught the same in the Promises, and how the
knowledge of them, as has been set forth, is helpful to us in many things.

CHAP. 6.
How this knowledge of the Promises is instructive to us about understanding
some Sayings of Scripture.

1. THis will help us to understand that saying, 2 Pet. 1.4. Whereby are given
unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be
partakers of the divine nature, etc. It is evident, That in this and the former
Verse, Romans 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Ephesians. 1.2, 4, 5, 11. Act. 26.18.
Peter was declaring the Furniture given him by God for his Ministration, as
was Paul's course often, in beginning of his Epistles: and both his Furniture and
Mission for the same end, that Paul had his: and so in the former Verse he
tells us, That the divine Power of Christ, Joh. 15.26, 27. Act. 1.4.5. Luke
24.4. Joh. 5.25. and 11.25, 26.
and so of God in and through Christ (which was the Holy Ghost inspiring them
with the Testimony of Christ) has given unto them all things (pertaining) unto
life and godliness: To life, that is, to forgiveness, quickening and life; and
being enlivened, to godliness, to right worshipping of God, and living to him,
an=d uniting and conforming to him: 2 Pet. 1.1, 2.
and all this, he says, the divine Power gave them, through the knowledge of
him, that is, in the Testimony of the Righteousness of God, and of our Savior
Jesus Christ: 2 Cor. 4.6. 1 Pet. 1.20, 21. 2 These. 2.14. 2 Cor. 5.18, 19.
which the divine Power shined into their hearts in the face of Jesus Christ,
who has (says he) called us by glory and virtue, or to glory and virtue:
whereby, or by which divine Power and Spirit in the knowledge of Christ,
according to the Testimony put in our hearts, are given to us (that is, for
Ministration, and to minister with) exceeding great and precious Promises, that
by these ministered by us, and heard and believed by you) you might be Partakers
of the divine Nature, that you in hearing, might believe; and in believing,
being convinced, and brought out of darkness, might receive the light; and so
believing in Christ, have Fellowship with, and partake of the divine Nature:
and so the Promises here appears to be the same with Gospel-Testimony, and the
several Heads or Branches of Promises forementioned. Consider it well.

1. For fallen Man, the Seed of the first Adam, that are under sin and death,
that they may attain to life and godliness, receive forgiveness, and be
accepted into favor, and become of the spiritual Seed, etc. Needful it is,
That in that Nature of Man, sin be condemned and punished, blood shed, death
and curse suffered and overcome in the same Nature, risen, just, ascended, and
offered to God a Sacrifice, so as Aronement be made, Redemption obtained,
Spirit and Eternal Life received in the Man, to send forth, that Men might
believe; Act. 13.31, 32, 33, 38, 39. Joh. 1.45.
and that whoever believes on him, may receive forgiveness, and life. And such
a Savior God from the beginning promised to Mankind; and after more
explicately to Abraham, and by the Prophets: and Jesus Christ that died and
rose, etc. is this very Promise fulfilled, as God has now fulfilled this
Promise in raising him from the dead, Luke 1.69, 70, Joh. 14.6. Ephesians. 2.17. Romans
3.25 1 Cor. 3.11. 1 Pet. 1.21, 25. Joh. 6.48. Isa. 42.1.
etc. and so set him forth in the Gospel: and this Jesus so set forth, is the
Way of approach to God, The Propitiation for sins, The Foundation, The immortal
Seed, The Bread of Life, The Elect of God, The First-begotten, and Firstborn
Son of God; that all that believe in him, may through him approach to God,
receive forgiveness, be united to, and built on Christ, and so become of the
same seed, born of God, a Son of God, by virtue of the Death and Resurrection
of, and union with the Son of God. And this fulfilled Promise, Joh. 3.14, 15.
Act. 2. and 3.9, 26. and 13.38, 39
and so the Promises under this first Head or Branch of Promises (of things
done) are exceeding great and precious, and to be held forth as the Promises of
God fulfilled, that in believing Men might be begotten by, and born of the Word
or Promise: so that to conceive or suggest to any, another Seed, an elect
Company for whom this Seed should come and die, is altogether erroneous; there
is but one blessed Seed in which blessing is, and that is, the Seed of the
Woman, of Abraham, in which is blessing. Gal. 3.16, 26.
And this Seed was not a People for Christ to die for; but it is Christ dead
and risen; and by his communicative virtue, all those that through Grace are
brought in to him, and united to him, as such a Seed: to bring Men in therefore
to be of this Seed, this Promise fulfilled in him is to be preached. 1 Cor.
15.14, 15.


Indeed, to witness this of Christ, that he is dead and risen again, and alive
for evermore, that whoever believes on him, may live; if it were not so
indeed, would be a false witness-bearing of God, and so a vain preaching; and
so likewise to preach this, as good News, and Gospel, to any, for whom Christ
did not indeed die, and rise, Act. 3.26. and 10.34, 43 and 13.38, 39, 47. 1 Timothy 2.4, 5, 6, 7. 2 Pet. 1.20, 21, 23, 24, 25.
and give himself a Ransom; so as there is forgiveness and life in him for
them, that they might believe, and in believing, receive the same; were a false
witness-bearing of God and Christ, of which the Apostles freed themselves, when
they preached this to Jews, to Gentiles, to all Men wherever they came;
affirming the same for Truth: and so this the first Promise, in which the
Foundation is held forth, and the immortal Seed effused; and so Peter preached
this Promise.

2. That sinners, ignorant, blind, weak and dead Men, may be enabled to
believe; and so come upon this Foundation, and be united to, and quickened and
born of this Seed, and so partake of life and godliness; and therein, of the
divine Nature; needful it is, That this Foundation be discovered to them, and
light shined on them with some spiritual fervor and power, opening their eyes
to see, and moving in their hearts, that they might believe; testifying to
them, That if they in seeing see, etc. following Grace shall flow into them,
enabling them to believe; and that in believing, they shall receive Remission
of sins and life, and that this is the very end of God in sending forth the
Gospel to them: and all this God has promised, and is doing, as has been
shown in the second Head or Branch of Promises: and this Promise, See Part 5.
chapter 1.
with the Promises contained in it, are given in the Gospel also to be
preached; yea, so as in the plain Declaration of the Gospel, See Part 4. chapter 4.
with invitation of Men by it to be reconciled to God, God be affirmed to be
fulfilling these Promises also; reaching forth his hand to such a Performance,
that Men might indeed, Joh. 3.14, 15. Act. 3.26. and 26.18. Act. 11.20, 21. 2
Cor. 3.3. and 5.20. Act. 17.30, 31. Hos. 11.3, 4. Joh. 6.27, 32, 33, 62, 63.
Mat. 4.15, 16, 17. 1 Pet. 1.12. Act. 5.22. 1 Romans 1.16. These. 2.12, 13. 1 Pet.
1.20, 21.
by that he discovers in his Son, believe, and so be built on the Foundation,
united to, and born of the immortal Seed; and so the Preaching is said to be
for this end, to enlighten and save, and the hand of the Lord to be with them,
and do this work in this Ministration: and so God is affirmed to beseech in
their beseeching by the Gospel: yea, in the Ministration of the Gospel of
Christ risen from the dead, to be giving Faith to all Men, to be giving the
Bread of Life, drawing with the Bonds of Love, and the Cords of a Man; taking
the yoke from off the Jaws, and laying Meat before Men, to give Light to them
that sit in Darkness: whence Peter, confident of his Master's Truth in his
Word, Mat. 28.20. Joh. 15.26, 27. doubted not to affirm, That they preached the
Gospel with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven; and, That the Holy Ghost did
also witness of Christ in their witnessing: and so these Promises were also
exceeding great and precious, which they had also to preach: so, as whoever, as
Light came discovering Christ, and opening their eyes to see, did but then and
so behold him, this Word would work so in them, that they should by him believe
on him, and so be enlivened, and partake of divine Nature; and so through this
Promise received, united to the former Promise fore-fulfilled, and so born of
that Promise fulfilled, through this Promise now in performing.

3. That these weak Believers and newborn Babes, may be more and more built on
Christ, and grow up in him, and so live through him, and so have life more
abundantly, and be and live godly in partaking of the divine Nature, in
Interest, in Union, in Fellowship, in Usefulness, in Conformity, and in assured
Expectation of a complete Enjoyment in due season, See before chapter 2, and 3, and
4, and 5. Ephesians. 1.18 2 These. 2.14. Jam. 1.18. 1 Pet. 1.1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 2.3,
4, 5, 9. 2 Pet. 1.1, 2, 5, 11.
needful it is, That following Grace be vouchsafed to them, opening to them the
Inheritance, and affording them Blessing in divine spiritual Presence, in all
their spiritual Frames and Services, in their Temptations and Sufferings, in
their Abiding, and for their Abiding, and assuring them of Help and
Preservation to the end, and the Inheritance in its season; which are all given
us in the Gospel, and set forth in the third Head or Branch of Promises: and
these Promises also, be exceeding great and precious, and Peter had them also
to preach to the same end, and so did, these being the Promises, to the Hope
whereof Believers are by the Word begotten and born. And so of the Promises
given them.

II. This will also help us to understand Romans 9.8. The Children of the Promise
are counted for the Seed. In that by that said, it is clear, both who be the
Children of Promise, and in what sense they are said to be born of the Promise,
and so of Water, and of the Spirit; yea, of God, and from above; which only
they are, that being born of the immortal Seed, are reckoned one with it, and
so after it; and so counted for, and are the spiritual Seed.

1. They are born of the Promise, that is, of Christ promised to be the
Savior; which Promise is now fulfilled, Jam. 1.18. 1 Pet. 1.20, 21, 23. Joh.
1.12; Isa. 53.8, 10.
and he so held forth therein, as The Propitiation, The Foundation, The
immortal Seed, The Word of the Lord; that the Love of God appearing in him,
they beholding, are by him begotten, quickened, born; and so are accounted his
Generation. This the Promise of which borne.

2. They are born through the Promise, that is, the Promises God has made of
filling Christ with Spirit, (which is done) and sending forth Spirit through
him, Isa. 42.1, 8. and 55.4, 5.
to open the eyes of the blind, etc. and so to allure and bring in to him: in
performance of which Promise in the heavenly Call, the Word becomes effectual
in the heart of those that in hearing hear; 1 Pet. ^.25. Gal. 4.23.
and so prevails with them to answer the Call, in believing that set before
them in the first Promise seen fulfilled, which therein quickens them, and
brings them forth to the birth; and so of that Promise through this Promise,
they are born.

3. Gal. 3.16, 26, 29. and 4.23, 18, 31.
They are in this Birth born Heirs, to the Hope of the Promise, even the
Promises of and pertaining to the Inheritance.

And these Promises coming all from above, being all the Fruits of Free Grace,
The Love of God shining through them all, and the Spirit of God breathing in
them all, they that are through the Promise displayed, in displaying, born of
the Promise displayed, Joh. 3.3, 5, 6. Gal. 4.29. Joh. 1.13.
to the Hope of the Promise confirmed in him displayed, which is Christ the Son
of God, and the Fountain of Spirit and Life, they are rightly said to be born
from above, of Water and of Spirit, and so of God; and that so born of the
Spirit, is spiritual; and they are in every respect of the Promise, truly
called, The Children of the Promise, being born of the Promise, through the
Promise, Rom 9 8, 9 Gal. 3.23, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31. 1 Pet. 2.5, 9, 10.
to the hope of the Promise; and so both called, and are, The Children of the
Promise, of the Freewoman; and these, all these, and none but these, are the
Seed, and counted for the Seed: and so the Apostle Peter avoucheth them also.
These were before this, another Seed, even Enemies, the Seed of fallen Adam,
for whom Christ underwent the Curse: and he himself is the promised Seed, in
which blessing is for others, even as he came of Man, and in Man's Nature died,
and rose, offered the Sacrifice, made the Atonement, and is filled with the
Spirit of Life, even the spiritual Man, not the first but the second public
Man: so the promised Seed, that in being so made known, sinners may come in to
him, and receive pardon and renewing; and upon that account, may in Union with
him become of the same Seed. And these so one in and with him by Faith, are The
Seed, God's elect Seed: and surely, God has no Elect among the Sons of Men,
but this Seed; yea, none but these counted for the Seed. Therefore for any Seed
or Elect to be counted for the Seed, before the consideration; yea, Acceptance
and Virtue of the Death and Sactifice of Christ, for him to die and offer
Sacrifice for; and then, in due time to call those that were God's Elect Seed
before, to be born again, is such a Dream, that it is a marvel any waking Men
should be taken with it, and not rather hold fast to the Scripture Language,
That those that are born of the Freewoman, The Children of the Promise, are
the Seed, and counted for the Seed.

III. This will also, with that Discovery of the same in the Purposes, help us
to understand those places, Psalm. 69.28. Rev. 3.5. and 22.19. about which, so
many, through unbelief of the Gospel, puzzle themselves: for The Promises of
God, of the first and second Branches, to Mankind fallen, to sinners; which
also opens the Purposes of God as ordered in his Counsel for saving sinners,
both declared in the Testimony of Christ in the Gospel, according to Purpose,
Promise, Testimony of God, holding forth Mercy, Forgiveness, and Life to
Mankind, sinners, that they might repent, believe and receive it. In all which
it appears, That in the Gospel there is a Book declared, which may be, and
truly is called, The Book of the Living, The Book of Life; Psa. 69 28. Rev.
3.5. and 22.19. Romans 5.6, 8, 10. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15 1 Timothy 2.6. 1 Timothy 1.15. Joh.
6.51, 33. Romans 5.18 and 14.9. and 2.4. Ioh. 1.9, 29. and 3.17. and 1.4. Genesis
6.3. Eccles. 9.4.
out of which Men may be blotted; yea, their Name blotted out of it, and their
part taken out of it; and so they were once written therein by these Names,
Men, sinners, ungodly, unjust, Enemies, lost Ones, because Christ died for
such, and came to save such: and there are Declarations of Mercy, and Promises
for such, He gave his Flesh for the Life of the World, and gives life unto the
World, (which yet is nowhere called eternal life, though that they might come
to that) and as by his own Righteousness in one Sacrifice-Offering, Life was
unto all in him, as in the public Man: so God has given them all over into
his dispose; so God also uses means toward them to lead them to Repentance
that they might be saved. Whence also the Life in Christ is called the Light of
Men: and so while he continues in means, to strive with them, and they be
still joined to all the living, there is hope; and while they remain thus,
though no-better, yet if not no worse, they are yet written among the living,
and their Names as Men, sinners, lost Ones, Psalm. 69.28. Rev. 13.8. Ezekiel. 13.9.
Luke 10.20. Heb. 12.23. Joh. 1.12, 13. and 3.1, 5. Ephesians. 1.5. Romans 8.28. 2 Cor.
5.17.
are yet in this Book of life, though yet they are not written with the
Righteous, they are not written in the choice sense, in The Book of Life of the
Lamb, not written in Heaven, in the secret and Congregation of the Righteous:
for none are so written in this Book, but the Congregation of the firstborn,
the Believers on Christ, that are born of God, of Water and the Spirit, whose
Names are, Faithful in Christ, Lovers of God and Christ, and one another, new
Creatures, Saints, Brethren to Christ and one another, Sons of God by Faith,
Overcomers of the World, etc. which Names were never yet on these other. And
when the Promises of the first Head are held forth, and the Promises of the
second Head in some measure performed to these, and they then persist resisting
and opposing till they be reprobated and given up, Romans 11.8, 9, 10, 11, 23.
with Psa. 69.22, 27, 28. and 109.1, 5.
then begin they to be blotted out of the Book of the Living, or that Book of
Life, in which Mankind as sinners are written; and yet by corrections and
renewed strife, there may be a recovery; but if against that also, they still
persist in their Rebellion till wholly given up and reprobated, then are they
wholly blotted out, and shall not be recovered to be written with the
Righteous: and the Names upon them then, are, Reprobates, Sons of Perdition,
that willingly reward him Evil for Good, and Hatred for Love, The Seed of the
Serpent, The Children of the Devil, set with full Purpose to do his Will: which
Names, neither are, nor ever were in the Book of Life, in the first or second
sense; 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. Ephesians. 5.1. Gal. 5.1^, 20. Rev. 13.^.
nay, in the second sense of the Book of Life, Unbelievers, Unrighteous,
Adulterers, Fornicators, Wantons, Thieves, Murderers, Liars, Blasphemers, and
Worshippers of the Beast, and suchlike; with those Names never were, are, or
shall be written in the Book of the Life of the Lamb, among the Righteous; but
only the Names forementioned of new Creatures, Rev. 2.11. and 3.1. Luke 10.20.
Phil. 4.3. 1 These. 1.3, 4, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 3, 7. Psa. 3.29.
etc. and the Promises are to such as overcome, they shall not be hurt of the
second Death, nor their Names blotted out of the Book of Life; and such may
rejoice that their Names are written in Heaven; yea, and discern their
Brethrens Names there written also, and rejoice for the same, being Heirs
together of the Grace of Life; and so of the Promises mentioned in the third
Head or Branch of Promises.

IV. This Consideration of the Promises of God to fallen Mankind, sinners in
the first and second Consideration, and his Purposes alike ordered, and the
Testimony of Christ in the Gospel, declaring and witnessing the same, will keep
us from wresting, and lead us to a profitable understanding of that in Act.
13.48. As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.

This some, to favor some Opinion, wrest to mean, as many as from eternity
were in their persons absolutely decreed and elected to eternal life, believed:
so leaving all the rest of Mankind, but that elect number, as from eternity
decreed to be damned: a harsh and untrue position, cross to all the plain
Declaration of the Gospel, and the Purpose of God in giving and sending his
Son, and causing him to be preached, and the Promises of God to fallen
Mankind, sinners in first and second Consideration, and to the Holy Spirit's
Discovery of the Elect, and those that are counted or the Seed; and cross to
the Text: for if as many as were ordained, as they say, from Eternity decreed
to eternal life, did then believe, then was there no more to be converted, and
that would not have filled the Disciples with joy, nor would the Word of the
Lord have been farther published to others still there: it were better to
acknowledge such a Sentence deep and difficult, and wait till we be helped so
to understand it, as agreeing with the Testimony of Christ, then to fancy a
sense quite cross to it all, as this appears to be; nor is there a word here to
countenance it: for it is not said, As many as were from Eternity ordained to
eternal Life, believed.

If any say, It must be so taken, because of the contrary saying in Jude 4. Who
were ordained of old to this condemnation:

I answer, They mistake both places; for the word in Jude 4, is either
forewritten, or ordained of old; which is not so far as from eternity; no, not
in the works of God. Israel said, The Lord bath appeared to me of old: which
could not be from eternity, Je^. 31.3.
though far off in many Ages past; and so this fore-writing and Ordainment of
old was fore-written by the Prophets. And two things are note-able in Jude 4.

First, Who they were that were thus ordained: and that is, See Part 4. chapter 4.
not particular Men, as Adam's Sons fallen considered; but such as to whom
Grace has been extended, and Light opening their eyes to see, and so called to
yield to the Teachings of it, and they willingly close their eyes, and pervert
the Tenders of Grace, and abuse it, to take Liberty to satisfy the Flesh; and
in that sense ungodly: and that such as so considered, are ordained to stumble,
is foreshewn.

Secondly, note what that is, they are here said to be ordained to, and that
is, to be the Tryers, Exercisers, and Adversaries of the Saints, in contending
against their Faith; and so to this Judgment, Contention or Condemnation, to
be also contended against by the Saints; Genesis 4.15. Prove. 29.27. Psa. 101. and
139.19, 22.
which Ordainment and fore-writing is declared of old, and may be read: and
such as persist in the ungodliness are ordained to the vengeance of eternal
fire, and not else, as that whole Epistle shows. And this Jude 4. speaking of a
direct contrary Ordainment to that Act. 13.48. helps to a right understanding
thereof, namely, That such as, when means of Grace and the Call of God therein
is extended to them, and light so given as they are brought to hear and
understand, and they do in hearing hear, and in seeing see, and so receive and
like the Reproof and Call; such are ordained to have Christ made to appear more
precious to them, and so believe, and in believing to have eternal Life, as
has been shown both in Purposes and Promises, Par. 4. chapter 4.
Part 5. Chap. 1. which helps to understand this: and according to the
Testimony of Christ, and the Purposes and Promises set forth in the Gospel, is
this to be understood. And for the words in it,

1. Some accounted well skilled in the Greek, say, It Is thus to be read: Act.
13.48.
As many as believed were ordained to eternal Life. Which however the saying
and sense in it is true, and safe to be received as Truth, (which the foresaid
contradicting sense cannot be) for this agrees with the residue of the Gospel,
and the Purposes and Promises of God. But grant this Saying to be not fit and
proper in this place, as other skilful Grecians say it is not, yet if we look
well into the words as used in Scripture Language,

2. If we should take ordained, as some press for it, Prove. 1.23. 1 Pet. 2.3,
4, 7. Joh. 5.25. Mat. 13.12, etc.
to be pre-ordained, or ordained of old, or fore-written; yet the sense is
given us in Scripture to be, That God has ordained, that when he declares his
Grace in Christ, and therein opens Men's ears to hear, and their eyes to see,
and puts forth his hand in his Call, moving at their hearts, that such as then
by the Grace extended, do in hearing hear, and in seeing see, and so receive
his Words, more Grace shall flow in to them, so as they shall believe and have
eternal life: and so it stands well here, As many as were ordained to eternal
life, (that is, were so prepared by the Grace extended) believed. This shown in
Purposes and Promises.

3. If we take ordained, (as some skilful in the Greek say, The word signifies)
for ordered or fitted; and so for an act of the following Grace of God, where
his preventing Grace was not rejected, but entertained; and so such as harden
not their hearts against preventing Graces, but receive and own it, to them
more abundant and following Grace is given, and so they fitted to prize,
accept, and receive Christ, Heb. 3.7. Joh. 4.10. and 10.38. Joh. 5.38, 40, 44,
and 10.26, 27 and 12.38, 39. Acts 13.39, 40, 41, 47.
in whom eternal Life is, and so to accept and receive it in God's way; and so
being ordered, inclined and fitted for eternal Life, they do in that gracious
Operation, believe. Just as it is said of Despisers of the Word, and Resisters
of preventing Grace, They cannot believe, They put away eternal Life from
themselves, as is seen in the Verses before this Text: And so likewise when in
this preventing Grace, the Lord Jesus was held forth to be a Light to the
Gentiles, and God's Salvation to the ends of the Earth; which is the same with
The Propitiation for the sins of the whole World, The Savior of the World,
that died for all, and gave himself a Ransom for all; and upon that ground,
Isa. 45.22. Prove. 8.4, 5. Act. 13.44.45.
all the ends of the Earth called to look to him, and be saved: when this was
thus held forth, the Jews that had fore-despised this held forth to themselves,
did now much more despise and reject it also, when held forth not only to
them, but to the Gentiles also, even all that came to hear. But the Gentiles
were glad, and accepted the Message and Call, and counted it good; and they
glorified the Word of the Lord, that is, they prized, it highly, praised it,
received it, yielded to and turned; and these so glorifying the Word of the
Lord, even that Word which the wrested sense crosses, were ordained, ordered,
and fitted to receive eternal life, and they believed. Whereas the Despisers
not so ordered and fitted, believed not. And it is not said, That every
particular Jew (though probable the most of them) did reject; nor that every
particular Gentile (though many of them) did believe: but as many as did like
the Doctrine, were glad of it, and glorified it; so many as were so ordered and
fitted (to show the efficacy of the Word in such ordained Ones) believed. And
this sense agrees with the Testimony of the Gospel, and the Purposes and
Promises therein (...) with the Words and scope of the Text.

4. If we take ordained, (...) ep^red, ordered, and fitted, (as some do) it
agrees well with the place and other Scriptures, and all foresaid: this being
the most usual and ordinary way of God's proceedings, that according as he
gives some evidences of his goodness to all, and calls all; so they that as
his Grace in any measure, opens their eyes, and gives them to discern that
he is, and that he is gracious; and moves them so far to believe him gracious,
as to seek after the knowledge of him, and life from him; they that then hold
the Truth in unrighteousness, and are disobedient, etc. he leaves to farther
stumbling, Romans 1.18, 19, 21. and 2.4, 6, 11. Mat. 13.12. Luke 16.10. Joh.
10.41 Luke 17.29, 30 Act. 10.3, 4, 34. etc. Act. 16.9, 10, 13, 14.
and they are under wrath and great danger of perishing, and so oppose farther
light when it comes. But they that when his Grace is so far extended, do by it
abide in it, and are making out in seeking farther to know him, and receive
life from him; these shall have more, and are accepted of him, and ordered or
fitted to receive readily farther Light when it comes; and such in all places
were first Receivers of the Gospel: so such as received John's Ministration,
were prepared, and readily received the Ministration of Christ following: and
such as rejected John's Ministration, received not Christ when he came: and
among the Gentiles, those that by lesses light and means were yet according to
it, fearing God, more was given to them, and they readily received it. And some
such very like were in Macedonia: For, Come over and help us, might be a voice
suited not only to the needs, but to some kind of desires in the hearts of
many: and though by purchase, all are his, yet it is most probable of such
prepared ones he speaks, when he told Paul, He had much people in Corinth: and
such appears to be here in this place; Act. 18.9, 10.
for it is said, The Gentiles besought, that these words might be preached to
them the next Sabbath: Act. 13.42, 44.
And then came almost the whole City together to hear the Word of the Lord:
very like that of Cornelius and his Company: and such when they heard, being so
graciously prepared, did readily receive and believe. And this a true sense
agreeing in one with all the former: so that every way in belief of the Gospel,
the sense is clear, and in every acceptance of the Word, meets in one true
and full sense.

5. Yet if we shall, as some do, take ordained, for election, or implying
election, though there be nothing in the Word, or in the text, or in precedent
or consequent words to lead us so to do, Isa. 42.1. 1 Pet. 1.20, 21. Act.
10.42. Heb. 10.5. Ephesians. 2.10. Joh. 15.15 Col. 1.12, 13. 1 Cor. 2.9. 1 Ioh. 5.11,
12.
or justify us so doing; yet if we so do, and take Election in the sense the
Scripture uses it, then Ordaining, as implying Election,, signifies something
more then merely elected, even Ordination, Constitution, Preparation,
Furniture, and Consecration of the Elected: and so the word is sometime used
concerning Jesus Christ, and all those chosen in and by him to eternal life;
and the same thing meant by such ordaining, is also expressed in other terms, as
making meet, etc. And surely in some respect, and of some, this sense may be so
taken here, as it will well agree with those formerly mentioned, and include
them also: But the Spirit of the wisdom of this world, opposes this sense with
Rhetorical flourishes and lashes, calling it nonsense; saying, It is all one
as to say, as many as believed, believed. To which it might be replied, Many of
them speak more directly nonsense; when they cannot deny, but it is written,
God will have all men to be saved: 1 Timothy 2.4.
yet to keep men from believing it, they gloss it thus, All that are saved, are
saved by the will of God: and knowing it is written, That Christ enlightneth
every man that comes into the World; Ioh. 1.9.
yet to invade the belief of it, they gloss it thus, Every one that is
enlightened, is enlightened by him: yet these Sayings of God himself, and so they
in both bring one line of Truth to oppose another, and yet would not be charged
with nonsense. But we in speaking of Men that are imperfect, are charged with
nonsense, for bringing one line of Truth not to oppose, but as it consents
with another, and opens and justifies another, as there is Truth in, and
Degrees of believing. I hope none will say, He spoke nonsense that said, They
seeing see not, and hearing they hear not, Mat. 13.13. Ioh. 8.30, 31, 32, 33,
36.
neither do they understand. And so may we say, Some believe something of the
Truth of the Doctrine and Testimony of Christ, and have so seen and heard, that
if they did abide in, and mind that they have seen and believed, they should
know the Truth, and be made free by it, and so be ordained and fitted to
eternal life, 1 These. 1.3, 4, 5. and 2.12, 13. 2 These. 2.13, 14. Act. 14.2, 3.
and 16.23, 31. 2 Cor. ^.9, 12.
and believe on him, which yet they did not: But these mentioned Act. 13.48.
did (which was not ordinary with all at other times) at the very first hearing
the Gospel given to them, even so to believe on Christ: which appears to be
more then ordinary, even a wonderful and special Grace, affording Instruction
and Encouragement to plain Gospel-preaching, when it is most fiercely opposed,
as here it was; seeing in such seasons, the Lord does more abundantly pour out
of his Spirit in giving Testimony to the word of his Grace. And so taking
believing here in this sense, of such a degree of believing, as in which they
were chosen, and filled with the joy of the Holy Ghost, it gives us clearly to
understand and mind,

I. The abundance and power of Spirit, that went forth in this Word, Act.
10.43. and ^^.19, 21.
when so despised by great Ones, and preached by traduced Ministers, to the
hearts of all such as attentively heard it.

II. The unfeignedness and effectualness of the Faith, in the very beginning, 1
These. 1.4, 5, 6. and 2.13, 14.
and at once wrought in such as received the word, when it was so despised and
opposed.

III. The evidencing the effectualness of their Calling and Election in the
beginning, 2 These. 2.13, 14.
and so in this season such abundance of Grace given and received at the first;
and not only so, but at the first also so showing forth it self, as was not at
all times, nor to all usual; now no feigned Believer, now none that believed,
and were not yet made upright and free; nay, none here that staggered; but all
so believing, as ordinarily others came to by degrees, but such a Blessing as
might encourage Ministers of the Gospel to hold forth the Word of Life in all
times of opposition.

Now I leave the sense of the place to every one that believes the Gospel, to
understand as he is helped to conceive; knowing that all will meet in one, and
preserve from stumbling and wresting, if Gospel-Purposes and Promises be
heeded: yet I shall mention a little farther use of them.

CHAP. 7.
Of some usefulness concerning those to whom Promises belong.

THe knowledge of the Purposes of God, and so of the Promises (which are
Revealers of the Purposes) in the three several Heads forementioned, will lead
us to see to whom the Promises belong; and to whom and in what order they may
be proclaimed, preached and applied, without any doubt, or equivocation, or
cloak for an evasion, as the Promises under the first Head declared as
fulfilled, to be held forth to all Men for good; yea, though they believe not,
yet to affirm them true and good, and done for them that they might believe:
and the Promises under the second Head held forth to all Men as true and good,
Act. 13.32, 39, 47, 48.
even for them, so as they have yet an Interest in them, and he will perform;
if in performance of them their eyes are opened, etc. they do in seeing see,
etc. they shall be saved, brought out of darkness into light, and so enabled to
believe, and in believing, receive Remission of sins, Life, Justification: and
so these of both sorts may be thus affirmed as Truth, to all Men, to every Man,
to sinners; yea, to sinners, as sinners; and they hereby beseeched to repent, 2
Cor. 5.14, 15, 19 20, 21. and 6.1, 2.
believe, and be reconciled to God, with assurance of Blessing in their
believing, Acceptance of, and yielding up to this Grace, praying them to
receive it on that Ground. But the Promises as under the third Head, though to
be preached to sinners, and in the hearing of sinners, to allure them to become
Believers, yet not to be applied to any unbelievers, as that in which they have
an Interest, though in believing they might come to have an Interest. But these
Promises are in respect of having Interest, to be applied only to Believers;
and though to them, as yet also in some sense sinners, yet not to them as
sinners only, but as also Believers, and in Christ, and Heirs: of which,
enough has been said, and more needs not; but only a word to show the
mistakes of some, that would cut off all the Promises of God from appertaining
to any but The Elect, The spiritual Seed: alleging there is an Israel, and an
Israel; a People, and a People: and all that are of Israel, are not Israel,
(that is not the spiritual Seed,) but the Children of the Promise are counted
for the Seed. All which is very true; but the inference is very false, That all
the Promises pertaining to life, pertain to, are made and belong only to this
choice Israel, and spiritual Seed, and not to the residue of Israel, and
people; for Paul speaking of Israel, including them that stood out, for whom he
was in great sorrow, Romans 9.2, 9.
says, That to them were committed the Oracles of God, That they are
Israeclites, to whom pertains the Adoption, and the Glory, and the giving of
the Law, and the Covenants, and the Promises: nor does he say, That those to
whom the Promises are made are counted for the Seed: for then there needed no
being born by or of the Promises, to make them so. And Isaac, the Son of the
Promise, was conceived and born of a Promise; yea, a Promise made to Abraham,
before he had any being, and believed by Abraham and Sarah; so the Promise is
surely confirmed in Christ, and believed by the Church, and held forth in the
Gospel, even for and to sinners: and when in performance of the Promises under
the second Head, the eyes and ears of Men are opened, some in seeing see not,
etc. and so are not born of the Promise; yet those that in seeing see, the
Promise becomes effectual in them, and they are born of it; and being born,
they see their benefit in it, Compare Romans 9.1, 9. with Gal. 4.23, 26, 28, 31
and Interest in that Promise to the hope whereof they are born, as Isaac also
did: and were there no Promise made for and to sinners, as sinners, even such
as are not yet Children of the Promise, that by the Promise believed and held
forth by the Church, they might be won in, conceived, and born of the Promise,
how should the Freewoman come to have any more Children? which certainly she
shall.

True it is, Men may be said to be Children of the Prophets, and so of the
Apostles, and so of Abraham, and so of the Church, and so of the Covenant and
Promises God has made with the Fathers and the Church, Act. 2.39. and 3.19, 25
and 13.26, 38, 39, 46 Romans 10.1, 2, 3.
while they are nurtured and brought up under the Doctrine, Law, and Ordinances
given by them, and continue in that Profession: but then so was all the Israel,
or Jews, that yet were unbelievers when Paul wrote; yea, clearly distinct from
true Proselytes and Fearers of God, and charged with putting away eternal life
from themselves: and in this sense, as all Israel under that Tuition, so all
Christians under Gospel-Ministration and Ordinances, are such Children, and
Promises belong to them, and are to be preached to them; and yet still those
that are born of the Promise, are the Children of the Promise, that are the
spiritual Seed, and counted for the Seed, and have the Promises to preach to
others: which known what they are, will direct in the preaching them. And by
that has been said of the Testimony of Christ in his Oblation, Mediation, and
coming again, and of the Purposes of God concerning Christ, and concerning
Mankind fallen, and concerning Believers; and lastly, Prove. 1.22, 23. and 9.2,
6. Isa. 55.2, 7.
of the Promises of God in the three several Heads or Branches, it appears,
That the Love and Free Grace of God in all appearing, has enough in it, to
call and draw in the worst of Men and Unbelievers that hear it, Rev. 22.17.
Joh. 3.33. Romans 3.4. 1 John 5.10.
to repent and believe, and to confirm the Faith of Believers, and to lead ^em
to the assurance of Faith for perseverance.

Oh that Men would believe God more then Men, and not make him a liar to
justify Men! and surely the Covenants of God are suitable to the Gospel of
God, and his Purposes and Promises: of which next.

An Explicit Declaration of the Testimony of Christ, etc.
PART VI.
CHAP. I.
Of the Covenants of God with the two public Men.

THE Covenants of the Lord are sure, and according to his terms of covenanting,
shall certainly be performed to every Iota: but those I am now to consider, be
such as pertain to life and godliness, and so to Salvation. And therefore I
shall endeavor to set them forth as upon search, in and by the Scripture
understood according to the Testimony of Christ, I find them either made or
promised to be made, beginning with those already made: and so I shall begin
with the two public Men; the first Adam, and the second Adam.

I. What the Covenant made with the first Adam was, is not expressed, but as it
may be gathered by the story, and elsewhere in Scripture, what such great
goodness extended, obliges to; and so it cannot be denied, but that the Grace
of God in the Creation of the Heaven and Earth, and a world of Creatures for
Man, and Man himself in the Image and likeness of God, and making him a public
Man and common Father of all Mankind, that were to proceed naturally from him,
and set him in a place of pleasure, and appointed him a service of delight, in
dressing the Garden, making him Lord of all the Creatures below, affording him
Liberty of Communion with the Creator, and a Tree of Life, on which eating, he
might be immortal and live for ever. This did oblige him to believe, and
acknowledge the Word, Wisdom, Power, Truth, Love and Goodness of God his
Creator; and therein to love the Lord his God with all his Mind, Heart, Soul
and Strength; and his Neighbor, even all Mankind that was to come of him, as
himself; and so to walk in this belief of God, and love of God, and his
Nieghbour; doing whatever God should say unto him, from that natural Principle
of Righteousness, God had implanted in him: and though this was to works, yet I
cannot for all this say, God made with him, and put him under a Covenant of
works, to do and live, or by doing such things to live; not only because I
find no Record of any such thing imposed by such an Obligation from God on
him, nor engaged and promised so, on the part of Adam: but, because God in
breathing into him the breath of life, and making him a living Soul, Genesis 2.7.
1 Cor. 15.45. Genesis 1.27 Eccles. 7.29. Col. 3.10.
did so frame him to the likeness of God in Righteousness and Holiness,
inspiring such a Disposition into his Soul, and Aptitude into his Faculties,
Parts, and Members, that it was natural to Adam, and he freely inclined so to
love God and his Neighbor, and apted with motion and strength to have walked
out in that love; yea, as natural as for the Sun to give light, or the Fire
heat, or the Earth to bring forth its fruits; so as no outward imposed or
enforced Law was needed, nor was he under the power of any such, either to
charge, or to accuse or excuse.

If any reply, That he was under a Covenant of works, because he was set to
dress the Garden: Genesis 2.8, 15.


I answer, That God put the Man in the Garden to dress it, and to keep it, is
true: but, That he made that as a Covenant of Works, to put Adam under a
Covenant of Works, it being so easy and delightful, it does no more appear to
me, then God calling a People out of Darkness and Bondage, into Light and
Freedom, choosing them in, and building them on his Son, to offer up by him
spiritual Sacrifices, 1 Pet. 2.5, 9. Luke 1.74, 75.
and show forth his praises, and serve him in Righteousness and Holiness,
should be a putting them under a Covenant of Works.

If it be replied, That the Lord commanded the man, saying, Of every Tree in
the Garden, eating thou shall eat (or, Genesis 2.16, 17.
thou may freely eat,) but of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou
shall not eat of it: for, etc.

I answer, This implies that Adam knew the Nature of all the Trees; and shows
the great Liberty that God gave him, in his delightful business of dressing the
Garden, to eat of them all but one; and showed him the danger of eating of that
one, to keep him from it: and therein gave him both the Opportunity and Liberty
of exercising the Freedom of his Will, in showing forth his well-pleasedness
with, and freeness of abiding in the way of his Creator, which else he had been
in a sort necessitated to; and could not have shown forth that Freedom, as now
he might. And this is not like a Covenant of Works, enjoining Works, unless any
will have a ceasing from one Work to be the Works, to which if any should tempt
him, he could not plead want, fasting, Mat. 4.2.
hunger (all which was on him that overcame) to weaken or necessitate him to
it: and the Truth is, 2 Cor. 11.3. See Part 1. chapter 9. and 10.
Had he abode in the belief of the Word of the Lord, he had not eaten of it,
and so fallen.

So that by all I can find, The first Adam was under a Covenant of Grace,
Grace obliging, and Grace given leading; and so at least a gracious Covenant:
and so was all Mankind at first in him, during his innocence; unless one
should deny any thing freely from God to be of Grace, and free and undeserved
Favor, but only forgiveness of sins, and that which follows thereupon; and so
exclude not only Adam in his innocence, but the Holy Angels also from being
under Grace or free Favor. But Adam in the Female first, and then thereby in
the Male, listened to the Tempter, questioning the Truth and meaning of the
Import of the plain Saying of the Lord, and so let go his Faith or believing of
God's Word, and so eat, and sinned, and fell, Genesis 3.1, 7. Romans 5.12, 18.
and so all Mankind sinned and fell in him: and so in this his fall, he lost
his righteous Disposition and aptitude to love God and his Neigbour: the Law of
Righteousness was now out of his heart, and a contrary Disposition sprung up
therein from the poisonous Word of the Serpent received: and so he, and all
Mankind in him, fell under the Covenant and Law of Works; for, though Man by
sinning lost his Righteousness and Strength, yet God lost not his Authority,
nor were all the good things fore-conferred on Adam, less worthy or less
obliging then before his fall; Romans 5.12, 18. and 6.23.
but did as much oblige him still to love both God and his Neighbor, and walk
in that love, as before; yea, this Law had that force upon him and in him,
which before it had not, to call, and charge, and force him to obey, and to
accuse and condemn him for not obeying; yea, to charge him with death for his
former sin: and unless he could suffer and overcome that first denounced death,
Romans 3.10, 11, 19, 20. Gal. 3.10.
and then fulfill this Law to the utmost, he could not come to live with God
again: This the Law and Covenant of Works, under which Mankind fell, and
under which all Mankind once was. Now God did not make such a Covenant as this
with Adam at the first; but Man through his willing Transgression fell under
it, and by God's just Judgment it took hold of Man, and he was under it. And
this is the Law and Covenant under which Mankind fell in the first Adam, and
by which they should have been judged, and were sentenced to the first death;
in which, if they had come to suffer it, according to the Judgment and curse
of the Law, they could not have overcome it, and risen again; but must have
perished in it for ever. But God in his great Love and Pity to Mankind, found
out one that was willing and mighty to step in and undertake this Cure, even
his own Son Jesus Christ the second public Man: of whom now.

II. What the Covenant made with the second public Man, as he undertook and
stood in the place of the first, and so of all Mankind as fallen, is not
clearly express in any one place, but gatherable in many places of Scripture,
and here and there partly express; and to the utmost I can conceive, it was in
the first place, in respect of himself, a Covenant of Works, even that Law and
Covenant, under which the first public Man, and all Mankind in him were
fallen, and that also, by which their weakness they were liable to be under for
a time, and so he was made under the Law, Gal. 4.4.
to do it and live. And upon the account of his fulfilling and satisfying this
whole Law for Mankind, then a Covenant of Grace and Glory for himself and all
his spiritual Seed: and both these may be seen in the former mentioning of the
Purposes and Promises of God concerning Christ. I shall here only briefly
collect a little thereof.

1. Upon the part of the Word, the Son of God, that he must descend, and lay
aside his great Glory for a time, and abase himself to be made flesh, of the
Seed of a Woman, of the Seed of David, Abraham, Adam; and in the similitude of
sinful flesh, a very Man, subject to humane infirmities, sorrows, temptations,
all except sin; and so a very Man, in the form of a Servant; and then in that
very Nature and Person, while in his weakness, fulfill the Law of
Righteteousness, in the Love of God and Man, and overcome, and put to flight
the Tempter; and then die for (...) sins of Mankind: and in that death suffer
the Curse of the Law due to Mankind; and through sufferings overcome death,
and the Devil that had the power of death, to terrify Man withal: and so, as
the public Man, rise just and free from all the sins that were charged on him
on the account of Mankind, and so for their Justification from their charges
of the Law, under which they were fallen. And this being done with the Virtue
of his own Blood, Death and Cross, to enter into the Heaven, to perfect the
Atonement for all the sins Mankind, through the first fall, was fallen into;
and to procure by Virtue of his Blood, pardon to bestow on all such as approach
to God by him, for all their following sins, and to purchase eternal
Redemption, and an Inheritance, by that offering himself in sacrifice to God;
and to declare this Righteousness of God in preaching it, and delivering it to
certain chosen Witness to open and declare the same to the World.

2. Upon the account of the Father, That he would send him forth, fit him with
a Body, and be with him, and help and assist him in all this, etc. All which
things are before at large shown and proved, in treating of the Oblation of
Christ, and of the Purpose and Promises of God.

And this is such a Covenant, and such a Work, as God never put on the first
Adam, nor any other but the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord; nor was any
other able to undertake it, but he; and he willingly at the first undertook,
and the Father accepted his undertaking, (and so it was then virtuous) and in
due season the Father sent him forth, and he has come, and done, and fulfilled
all this to the utmost, that either Man fallen needed, or the Law of Works
required, or his Father appointed, and is now with God alive for evermore; and
the Father has accepted and approved him, taken up his well-pleasedness in
him, and born Testimony of him, as the Scripture plentifully testifies.

Now upon the account of this undertaken, (now done and performed) the Covenant
of Grace and Glory is also made with him, for himself and all his spiritual
Seed; and confirmed to, in, and by him.

1. Upon the part of the Father, that he would glorify this his Son, Joh.
17.1, 2, 3, 5 Joh. 5.22, 23, 27, 28, 29. Romans 14.8, 9, 11, 12. and 2.16.
even in the Nature of Man, with his own self, even with the Glory he had with
him before the World was: That he should be the Lord of all, and have all Men
into his dispose, that they might live to him; and the Father will not judge
them by that Law he was made under and satisfied for them, but he shall have
the power over them, to extend what ease and freedom, and use what means he
pleases toward them, and raise them out of death in his season, and judge
them all according to his Law, the Gospel, in the means he has used toward
them; and that he will fill him with the immeasurable fullness of the Holy
Ghost, Isa. 41.2. and 55.5. and 61.1, 2, 3, 4. and 53.10, 11.
and send him forth in his Name; and in the means he uses, and in the
Ministration of his Servants, to draw in People to him; and so to beget and
multiply to him a spiritual Seed.

2. Upon the part of Christ, That he will be breathing and operating in the
means he uses, Isa. 42.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and 55.5. Psa. 22.25.
and in the Ministration of the Gospel by his Servants, to call Men and
enlighten their Minds, and open their Eyes to see, and their Ears to hear,
quickening and moving their Hearts, as he calls them, that they may turn to
him, believe and live; and that whoever comes to him in this his Call, Joh.
6.35, 37, 40.
he will not cast out, but receive them, and give them eternal Life, and raise
them up at the Resurrection of the Just at the last Day.

3. Upon the part of the Father again to Christ, That he shall sit at his
Right Hand till this Ministration be accomplished; Psalm. 110.1, 2. Isa. 53.10,
11. Joh. 3.35, 36. and 14.21. and 17.23.
and that he will beat down his Foes and Enemies, and make them his
Footstool,, and he shall see his Seed, and the Work of the Lord shall prosper
in his Hands; and he will accept and love all his Seed that believe in him; and
love them, even as he loves him; and that though the Devil with all his
Serpentine Seed, oppose his Ministration, and hold out many from coming in to
him, Psa. 2.9. and 22.27, 28. and 72.
and seek to delude and turn aside such as are coming, and raise up Persecution
against him in the World; yet his Ministration shall be effectual in many, and
he shall see his Seed, and of the travel of his Soul, and shall overturn and
judge all his Enemies; and then all the ends of the Earth shall remember and
turn unto the Lord, and come, and serve, and worship him; and then he and all
his Seed shall have a new Heaven and a new Earth, and shall have the Kingdom,
and be in his presence with everlasting joy for ever and ever, as is shown
before in the Testimony of Christ, and Purposes and Promises.

And this is the everlasting Covenant, confirmed in Christ for him and all his
spiritual Seed, Psa. 89.19, 37. Joh. 6.56, 58. Gal. 3.16, 17. Rev. 22.16 Mat.
22.43, 44. Rev. 1.8, 11. and 2.8. and 3.7, 14 and 21.6, 7.
and stands fast with him for them for evermore. This was confirmed in Christ,
that spiritually was before Abraham, before made to Abraham, and so before the
Covenant made with David; for Christ also is the Root and Lord of David: and
indeed, the Covenant made, and as made with Christ, is the only original
Covenant, and that out of which all Covenants are derived, that are for the
good of Mankind or Believers; yea, without this, none could have been for the
good of fallen Mankind, and the happiness of Believers.

And for the right understanding of all and every Covenant of God, this is
first to be understood, The differences between the two public Men, the
natural and the spiritual, The Covenant under which the first fell, and under
which the second was made; and having satisfied upon that account, the Covenant
both of Grace and Glory made with and confirmed in him, and so in respect of
the business done, 1 Cor. 15, 21, 22, 45, 46, 47 Romans 5.14. Mr. O. p. 9.
and the firmness of the Covenant made, in viewing the public Men, oppose the
second public Man to the first public Man; and the spiritual Seed come into
the second, to the natural Seed come forth from the first; and so what we have
from the one, to what we have from the other; and not in such business oppose
the first Adam to the Saints, but to the King of Saints, of whom he was a
figure. But now I will endeavor to say what I find of Covenants derived from
this made with Christ, and through him made with Mankind or with Believers:
and so to begin next with Mankind.

CHAP. 2.
Of the Covenant of God made through Christ with Mankind.

What that Covenant is, That God has through Christ made with Mankind, was
not so clearly opened in the beginning, when first made, as since; and yet
still it is not so clearly express in any one place of Scripture, as to be
plainly there read; but in searching and comparing diverse places together, it
is to be found: and so this we find, 1. Jer. 5.22, 24. Job 36.24, 33. and
37.3, 4, 24.
That the mercies of God extended to Mankind through Christ, the preservation
and upholding the Heaven and the Earth, and the Creatures in both; and ordering
all so sweetly by his providence, for the good of Men; yea, the hinting and
rumor of a Savior extended, through whom all this mercy is shown: All this
does still, and more oblige fallen Mankind, Psalm. 104. all.
even all Men, to adore and acknowledge this infinite Wisdom, Power, Mercy, and
Justice, Love and Goodness of God; and so to fear, love and trust in him, with
all their Hearts, Mind, Soul, and Strength, and to love their Neighbor as
themselves; and to walk in this fear and love, doing whatever the Lord hereby
requires of them: and there is no natural Son of Adam, Romans 3.10, 11, 19. and
2.19.
that can free himself from being under this Law, since the fall of Adam, nor
yet fulfill it; and though God in and by Christ, and so Christ, does not set Men
free from being under this Law in themselves, till his season, nor will judge
them in justifying or condemning them by it; Romans 2.24, 15. and 3.19, 20, 21.
and 5.20. Act. 14.17. and 17.26, 27, 28.
yet there is an usefulness of it that is good in his sight, and profitable for
Men, to which his mercy obliges; and that is, that by the effects of this Law
upon their Hearts, requiring, and excusing, and accusing, they see and
acknowledge their sinfulness, and the vanity of their best doings, and so their
need of a Savior, and Mercy through him, that they may so seek after God, and
find Mercy and free-Favour with him: and this sense and use of this Law, is
also a part of his Covenant. But to proceed. 2. In the rumor of Christ to come,
at the beginning, Genesis 3.15. 1 John 3.5, 8. Heb. 11.6. Lam. 3.25, 26.
there was testified the Love, Graciousness, and Propitiousness of God, in
providing such a Savior, through whom Remission of sins and Life is to be had;
so as this engaged to believe him to be gracious, a Forgiver of sins, and a
Giver of Grace and Life to such as seek him. 3. Act. 14.17. and 17.26, 27, 28.
Psa. 19.1, 6 Romans 10.18. and 2.4. Psalm. 145.8, 9, 17, 18. See Part 3. chapter 1.
The Mercies of God extended unto Men in his Works of Creation and Providence,
do witness forth the Truth of that-first rumored, namely, That there is some
Atonement and Propitiation with God; and that he, that is so true and
righteous, is therethrough gracious and merciful: which witnessing of his
Goodness to Men, engages them in acknowledgment of their own short coming and
inability to answer that Obligation, in which they are naturally bound to love
God, etc. in this acknowledgement to believe his Graciousness, and therethrough
to believe in him for life: and in that Belief, as a Testimony of Love and
Thanks to him, according to Light and Strength given, to live to him, and wait
for his coming. By all which considered, we may understand, That the Covenant
of God through Christ with Mankind, in beginning was, and so still is, 1. Act.
14.13, 14, 15, 16, 17. and 17.25, 28. Romans 1.19, 20. and 2.4, 5. Psalm. 19.1, 7.
Prove. 1.20, 23, 24. and 8.1, 6. Joh. 1.4, 5, 7, 8, 9. Isa. 45.22, 23
That he would extend Mercy, use Means, and give forth such Testimonies of his
Goodness in and through Chrst, the promised Seed, to all men, that they might
behold, and in beholding, repent, believe, and be saved; yea, so verily, That
whoever did not then repent and believe, it was because he was then found
hardening his own heart, and willingly refusing. In which God is, was, and will
be found faithful for ever; and Refusers left without excuse, when Believers
saved. 2. Job 37.2. Prove. 3.5, 6, 32, 33. Isa. 45.21, 22. Job 35.10, 11. Psalm.
33.8. Psalm. 14.2, 3. Romans 2.10.22, 23. Psa. 36.6, 7. and 100.1, 2. and 117.1,
2. and 130.4.
That Men should hear his Voice, mind and behold his Goodness, and so believe
him to be Great, Righteous, and Gracious, and so fear him, and stand in awe of
him; and in this belief and awe of him, to acknowledge the Righteousness of that
Obligation, which naturally obliges them to love the Lord with all their
Heart, and Soul, and Strength, and their Neighbor as themselves, and to walk
in that Love: and so their own short coming of it, and inability to answer it,
and their due and just desert of curse thereby, and inability of themselves to
avoid it; and so being abased in themselves, and believing his Goodness and
Mercy, to hope therein, and cry to him for it; and so believing in him, in
Testimony of Thanks, to yield up themselves, according to light and strength
given and received, to live to him; which is the most in this Covenant
required. 3. That those, who by the Testimony of his Goodness, do thus believe
him to be, Psalm. 107.43. and 33.15, 16, 18, 19. and 36.7, 8, 9. Lam. 3.25, 26.
Heb. 11.6.
and to be Great and Gracious; and from thence abasing themselves, do hope in
his Mercy, and are so found coming to him, he will give them Understanding, and
bless and save them; yea, even in such believing, how weak soever it be, if it
be according to the Light and Strength in the means given and received.



And this is all I can find to have been in the beginning, and from the
beginning, of any Covenant made by God with Mankind through Christ: and under
this Covenant, in their time, ever were, still are, and will be, all Men in
their several Ages, from the beginning to the end of this World.

If any reply, That here is nothing mentioned of Men, that they have engaged
themselves to God in, for performance of: and how can that be called a
Covenant, where both parties have not engaged?

I answer, Where there is an Engagement between two, and the one a public Man,
the several Engagements of the Particulars concerned in that public Man, is
not necessary to make it a real Covenant. And this will be yielded, if Reason
it self were made Umpire, That a Lord of a Manor may make a Covenant with his
eldest Son, about the disposal of his Lands, Rents, Goods, and Privileges, to
such and such Children, Servants and Strangers also, that are yet to be born,
on such and such terms to receive all engaged to them: and this a Covenant to
stand firm to all effects: and they all, as they come forth, be accordingly
engaged, and so to receive that given, or else be rejected: and shall not Faith
acknowledge, That The Great and Mighty God, Psalm. 24.1, 2, 5. Mal. 1.6.
The Father of Jesus Christ, The Lord and Master of us all, may make such a
Covenant for Men, who are his own Creatures, and pass it over to his own Son,
his Firstborn? and shall not all Men be engaged in it, for receipt, or for
rejection? were not the denial of this unreasonable? But if Understanding and
Faith be asked, they will soon tell us, That both parties have engaged in this
Covenant that God made with Christ the second public Man, for Men, seeing he
interposed for, and undertook in the Nature of Man, Gal. 4 4. 1 Timothy 2.6. 1
Cor. 6.19, 20. Deuteronomy. 29.14, 15.
to satisfy the Obligation under which Mankind was fallen; and having so
bought them, he as their Lord and Representative, did in his Father's
Engagement to him, so engage for them: and are they not then all engaged? yea,
have they not all in the public Man engaged, and are by him engaged? could
Moses the Mediator between God and Israel, enter into Covenant, those that were
far off, and yet to be born; and shall not the Lord of Moses, The Mediator
between God and Men, do as much for all Men? and was that a sin in those, 1 Timothy 2.5. 2 Samuel 21.1, 7, 9, 14, 15, 16.
that so many Generations after, thought themselves not engaged in the Covenant
made by Joshua their Leader into Canaan, and the Elders of Israel, though
unadvisedly made, and took courage to break it; and will it not be a greater
sin in any Man, to think himself not engaged in this Covenant made by Jesus
Christ the public Man in the behalf of Mankind? surely all that know this
Obligation, will confess it a gracious Covenant, and themselves engaged in it.

And yet I may say; both That all Men are engaged in it by their natural
Fathers, in that Adam, Seth, etc. yea, Cain also did subscribe to iti, n their
offering of Sacrifice; and after, Noah also, the Father of all Mankind now
living; and many have been, and are, that have personally engaged according to
that Testimony: Joh. 3.33.
he that has received his Testimony, has set to his Seal, That God is true:
for so those that believed the Graciousness of God in this Obligation: and
profess themselves, That they would so seek and serve him, they and their house
(as Joshua did) did therein subscribe to the Goodness and Equity of the
Obligation; Josh. 24.15.
and therein engaged themselves, and those under their Tuition, to the
observance of it. Ier. 2.20, 21. 1 King. 2.38, 42.
And if such willingly turn aside, their sin is so much the greater, and their
Condemnation will also be verified just from their own Mouth. But we need not
reason it out; it is expressly writ, That some in the acknowledgment of it, did
offer Sacrifice, did call upon, and were called by the Name of the Lord: Genesis
4.3, 4, 26. and 6.2.
and these, with all under their Tuition in that Profession, were called The
Sons of God, Genesis 6.1.
till the Profession received in that Tuition were cast off; and the residue of
Men, called Men, or the Sons and Daughters of Men. And those that were under
this Obligation, not only Subscribers, Genesis 4.3, 4. and 5.3, 22. Heb. 11.2, 3,
4, 5, 6 Genesis 6.8, 9. and 1.7.
but upright, in believing with the Heart, and so walked with God, they were
accepted, and approved of God also, and called just or righteons, or perfect
and upright Men, (one of the Names writ in the Book of Life among the
Righteous) and those that were guileful, and persisted in their Transgressions
of this Covenant after warning, and then cast off their Profession, were
rejected and punished, and then called wicked men, Genesis 4.5, 15. and 6.2, 4, 5.
Genesis 7. 1 Pet. 3.20. 2 Pet. 2.5.
of the wicked One, mighty in ungodliness, (one of the Names of the Seed of the
Serpent;) yea, all the Sons of men that stood out, and came not to the
acknowledgement of God according to this Covenant in the time given them for
Repentance, were destroyed by a flood of Water, when the righteous man and his
Family were saved; yea, God has magnified his Goodness in, and Faithfulness
according to this Covenant, (though no outward Seal of Circumcision or Baptism
were added to it) that it is affirmed for Truth, That God is no Respecter of
Persons; Act. 10.43.
but in every Nation, (and so may be said in every Age) He that that fears
him and works Righteousness is accepted of him: so good and gracious this
Covenant. And no other Covenant concerning eternal Salvation, do I find made
with any the Sons of Men, till Abraham's time; only I find a Covenant made
with Noah, Genesis 9.8, 17.
That all flesh shall not be destroyed with a flood of Waters any more: which
tends to the preservation of the Generations of Men, till the end of this
World, when the World shall be destroyed by fire; yet because this preservation
has a tendency to repentance, and especially, because there are many
instructions in it, for understandnig both this Covenant spoken, and also those
to be spoken of, I have mentioned it: For, 1. God smelt a savor of rest in a
Sacrifice, Genesis 8.21, 22.
before he made this Covenant; instructing us, That God makes no Covenant for
the good of Mankind, but through the rest and well-pleasedness he has found
in his Son Christ that has offered up the acceptable Sacrifice. 2. God has it
first in his Heart, Genesis 8.21, 22.
and so did first Purpose it, before he did give the Promise, and make the
Covenant: which instructs us, That all the Promises and Covenants made by
God, are according to his Purpose: and also, 3. That God may make a Covenant
with Men, Genesis 9.11, 15. Isa. 54.9, 10. and 65.17.
in which nothing is engaged to them to do for the performance, as here, after
the destruction of the World, and renewing the face of it; and a better in like
manner will be, when after the destruction by fire, the new Earth, etc. is
given. 4. Genesis 6.9, 10.12, 15.
That it is surely a Covenant with all with whom God makes it, that are capable
of receiving benefit by it, though they be not capable of understanding and
believing the same, (as the Fowls and Beasts here, were not;) yea, nor Children
dying in Infancy. 5. Genesis 9.9, 17.
That it is not always necessary to the being of a Covenant made by God with
his Creatures, That those with whom it is made, should all come and engage for
their parts: for then this had been no Covenant. 6. That some Covenants may be
and are made by God with some, Genesis 9.11, 13, 15, 16.
of things out of the power of Men to perform; and so have their whole and sole
dependence on God only for performance, and not on any thing to be done by
Men, less or more. 7. That when such free Covenants are made by God, of so
great things, Genesis 8.21. Isa. 45.9. Genesis 9.12, 13, 14, 16.
he not only confirms it with an Oath, but usually gives some outward sign or
token; which God beholding, is said to remember his Covenant, as the Rainbow
here. 8. Genesis 9.11, 15. 2 Pet. 3.5, 6, 7.
That some Men may by one Covenant be secured from perishing in one death, and
yet for presumptuous Transgression against such goodness, may perish in
another, as the world of ungodly by fire. 9. Genesis 9.8, 17.
That many may be under a gracious Covenant, and secured by it, though but once
made with their Forefathers for them, and not made over again to them
personally. All which Instructions are read in this Covenant, compared with
Isa. 54.9. Psalm. 36.6, 7, 8. 2 Pet. 3.6, 7. Rev. 21.8. And therefore I noted
it, and so shall proceed to the next I find.


CHAP. 3.
Of the Covenant of God made with Abraham.

WHat that Covenant is which God made with Abraham, is plainly and fully
expressed, Act. 7.5. Gal. 3.8, 16. Heb. 6.13, 14. Genesis 26.3, 4, 24 and 28.13. and
35.10, 11, 12.
and may of all be read, Gen 17.4, 8. including, that Genesis 12.3. and 18.18. and
22.18. the same being testified and confirmed over again to Isaac, the Son and
Heir of Abraham by Promise, and to Jacob his Son, the appointed Heir by Oracle:
and so it is sometime called, The Covenant made with Abraham, he being the
first it was made with, for him and his Seed; and sometime called, The Covenant
of the Fathers: the Seed not multiplied till from Jacob; and so it was made
with all these three one after another, i Cor. 16.15, 16, 17.18. Psa. 105.8, 9,
10, 11.
for them and their Seed, they all coming of one, and their Seed all one, and
the Seed of one: and so it is expressly said, It was made with them, and also
for them, and for their Seed. The things in this Covenant may be plainly read
in the several places quoted, and have been something opened before: I shall
only note now a few things about it, as it is a Covenant; And observe, See
Part 3. chap. 2.


I. Gal. 3.8, 16,
This is the Covenant of Grace and Glory that was before made by God with
Christ, and confirmed in Christ for him, and all that come to be in him, and so
of his spiritual Seed, and of the benefit whereof they all shall partake; but
not so (...) now.

II. (...) was so made with Abraham, that provision is in it, 1. That he may by
the Gospel included in it, teach his Children, and call in and proselyte of all
Nations, Genesis 18.13 Ron 4.12, 13. Gal. 8, 16.
as the Father of many Nations, and the Heir of the World: by preaching him in
whom is blessing for all Nations, Men may be brought to believe, and so he may
have a spiritual Seed. 2. That such as in hearing do believe, and so become his
Seed, Heb. 8.10.
may have the Mind and Law of God put in their Heart. 3. That these Believers
may be multiplied exceedingly, Ier. 32.40. Gal. 3.16, 29.
and yet be one Seed still, and have one Heart, and one Way. 4. That the Heaven
and the Earth, Heb. 11.9, 10, 14, 16, 39, 40. Psalm. 105.8, 11.
even that wherein Abraham breathed and sojourned, may be made new, and so fit
for such a Seed to inherit; and that he and all the spiritual Seed shall
inherit together.


III. That this Covenant was so made, that it might have diverse times of
fulfilling: one in the outside of it, Josh. 22.4. Isa. 42.6. Luke 1.71, 76.
Heb. 9.15. and 8.1, 2, 6.
in the Types, in having some rest in Canaan: another in Truth, and spiritually
in Christ, in his first coming, having finished his first Work, and being set
forth in the Gospel, and so given for a Covenant, Act. 3.19, 20, 21 2 Pet.
3.12, 13. Isa. 55.5. 1 Pet. 1.21, 23. Gal. 3.8, 6.26, 29 Ier. 31.33, 34. Heb.
8.10. 1 Pet. 2.3, 4, 5. Ephesians. 1.13. Col. 1.3, 4. 1 These. 4.14, 15, 18.
and remaining the Mediator and Minister of it: and the next, last and complete
fulfilling, according to Spirit and Letter both, at the next and visible
appearing of Jesus Christ: yea, and also a diverse fulfilling of it in
particular Believers: as first, When through the evidence of Truth in
Gospel-Testimony, glorifying Christ, a Man is brought in to believe in Christ,
and so made of the Seed. Secondly, When, and as in believing, a Man, through
the quickening Spirit of Christ, comes to be more built on Christ, and so sealed
in him, being endued with a First Fruits of the Spirit promised, Romans 8.23. And
thirdly, When the Lord Jesus Christ shall appear in Glory, and the Just be
raised, so to appear in Glory with him, to possess, etc. 1 John 3.2.

IV. That this Covenant was made with Christ, as the public Man, Heb. 1.2.
Ephesians. 1.14. Psalm. 89.28. Isa. 53.10, 11. Genesis 17. Act. 7.5. Heb. 11.9, 10, 14,
16, 40. Psalm. 105.8, 9, 10, 11. Romans 9.8, 9, 10, 11. and 4.10, 11, 12, 17, 23,
24. Gal. 3.7, 8, 16, 26, 27, 28, 29. and 4.25, 26, 28, 30, 31.
and the everlasting Father, upon the account of his Sufferings and Sacrifice:
and so the inheritance is his first, he is the Heir, as the Son of God by
Nature, and as the public Man, by Purchase, and by Covenant, for himself and
his spiritual Seed to be after brought in to him, (for there could be none
before him.) And this Covenant was confirmed in Christ to Abraham, and so made
with Abraham for himself, and for his Seed after him also, and confirmed to him
with an Oath; and so to Isaac, and Jacob in like manner, and so still for them
and their Seed, that were to come of them and after them: so as Abraham was
Heir, not only by a spiritual Birth, but also by a Covenant made, and
confirmed with an Oath, fastening the right of Inheritance upon him, and
intailing it upon his Seed: and so in like manner, was Isaac and Jacob Heirs
with him of the same Promise and Promises, and promised Inheritance, which they
never yet enjoyed, but in due time assuredly shall, when all their Seed is come
in to inherit with them: And this Covenant is confirmed to Israel for an
everlasting Covenant, in being so made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and
confirmed with an Oath to them, That all that are born of the Promise, that by
the Grace of God discovered in Christ do believe in him, they are the Sons of
Abraham, and his Seed, and so as Isaac and Jacob, of the same Seed, Heirs by
birth of the Promise given to, and believed, and preached by Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, and also confirmed Heirs by the Covenant made with Abraham, Isaac,
etc. by which, through Faith, they are assured of the Inheritance.

V. That this Covenant being so made with Abraham for himself, and for all
after-Comers that are his Seed, Act. 7.2, 3, 4 Heb. 11.8. Isa. 51.2.
that they, as his Seed, may know their Interest in it, and have by Faith the
same usefulness of it; this is farther to be minded, That Abraham was a true
Believer, and justified before God, and so by spiritual birth of the Seed of
Christ, and so an Heir, and walked in Faith as a Son, before this Covenant was
made with him: so that this Promise and Covenant was not given to him to beget
Faith, or to make him a Son, or upon condition of his believing; All which was
wrought in him, and he so living and walking in Faith, before this Covenant was
made with him; but it was made with him, as a justified Believer, to confirm
and increase his Faith, and so for the exercise of his Faith, in waiting for so
blessed a Hope, as set before him, and given him in this Promise and Covenant:
and in the same manner, it was after made with Isaac and Jacob; the Promise of
the Inheritance, being in order after belief and new Birth; The promised Seed,
is the Promise of which one is so born, the Promise of Means, from and through
that Seed; The Promise through which a Man is so born; and The Promise of the
Inheritance, the Promise to the Hope whereof Believers are born. And so this
Promise and Covenant made with the Fathers, is not fastened on any to make them
Believers and Sons, or on condition of believing, Romans 4.16. and 8.17. Joh.
1.12, 13. Gal. 3, 26, 29. Heb. 6.17, 18.
though in believing is the way to meet with it: but the Interest in it, and
the Assurance of it, as made to the Fathers for them, is given to such as are
Believers in Christ, and so the Sons of God by Faith, who are Abraham's Seed,
and Heirs according to Promise, to confirm and increase their Faith; and for
the exercise of their Faith in waiting for so blessed a Hope.

VI. The freeness, largeness, Genesis 17.4, 8. 1 Chronicles. 15.15, 19,
and everlastingness of this Covenant, the dependency it has on the Truth and
faithfulness of God for its performance; all being put on himself to perform,
Psalm. 105.8, 11. Ioh. 5.19, 20, 21. Heb. 9.15, 16, 17. and 13.20, 2 Samuel 23.5.
who has confirmed it with his Oath; yea, and having first made it with Christ
his Son, upon the account of his Purchase: the Son being one with the Father in
all he does, he also was one with the Father in making this Promise and
Covenant to Abraham, for him and his Seed, and has confirmed the Covenant with
his own Blood, and by virtue thereof, extends the Performances. So that this
is a sure and everlasting Covenant ordered in all things. This is all express
in the words and terms of it.

VII. When this free and everlasting Covenant was openly made and confirmed
with an Oath, Genesis 17.9, 10, 11.12, 13, 23, 27.
it had also added to it, an outward and sensible Testimony, Token, Sign and
Seal, to be set on the flesh of Abraham, and all his natural Seed according to
the flesh; that is, all by natural birth born of him; and all so of him, as
that by gracious Providence they were put under his care and tuition, whether
born in his House or Family, or bought with his Money; so as they were under
the Government of him or his Family; and also that were proselyted, and so come
to live under their Profession, Exodus 12.48, 49
with all under their Tuition and Government likewise. And this visible
Testimony and Seal, was Circumcision, which was to be acted upon the Males
only; in its beginning to be put on the Father of the Family, and Men grown,
and then on Children of eight days old; and so to be continued to Generation
and Generation on the Male-Children. And this Sign and Seal of Circumcision was
given to Abraham, and he received it, to administer, even to all his Family,
however as aforesaid become of his Family, even to the Child of eight days
old, as a Seal of the Righteousness of the Faith, which in believing, he had
received in the Testimony of God, concerning the promised Seed, the Object and
Foundation of Faith, and for alluring to Faith, and for Faith to rest on; and
in the Covenant now made with him, to confirm, increase, and exercise Faith:
both which, as he believed, so he had to preach; and so to testify the Truth
of that he taught, he had as received from God, this outward and sensible Sign,
to testify, seal and confirm the Faith with, [not, Rom: 4 10, 11, 12.13. Gal.
3.7, 8, 9.
That by this outward Sign he should confirm and seal his own believing, that
he might be a Son, which he evidently and knowingly was before; nor yet by this
outward Sign, to confirm the Righteousness and Truth of the Repentance and
Faith, or believing in those upon whose Flesh the Sign was put; but,] That he
might be the Father, etc. namely, by delivering such a Doctrine of Faith, and
testifying it with such a Sign and Seal received from God, as a Seal of the
Righteousness of it: he might be an Instrument to draw on Men to believe, and
bring under the means of begetting to the Faith and Profession thereof; and so
become the Father of them that believe, whether of his own circumcised Nation,
or of any other Nation: in which Seal administered by him, Genesis 17.9, 10, 11,
13, 14. Act. 7.8. Romans 3.1, 2. Ier. 4.4. Deuteronomy. 30.2, 6. Romans 2.25, 29. and
3.30. Josh. 5.9. Exodus 12.48, 49. Genesis 17.10, 11. Exodus 19.5, 6.
this also was included, That all that received the same upon that account, as
given him of God to that end, on themselves and theirs, God by Covenant engaged
himself, to afford them such means, as they attending and yielding up to him
therein, he would circumcise their hearts to love him, and so make them of the
spiritual Seed, that they might be interested in, and wait with assured Faith,
for the Good assured in the free and everlasting Covenant: whence Circumcision
is called God's Covenant in their Flesh, and said to be much profitable, and
they exhorted thus to attend, and the Promise also so made to them; and the
circumcised by this Ordinance were distinguished from the Heathen of the World;
yea, and of them, when proselyted, they were by it, them and theirs, admitted
into the Family of Abraham. And all the Circumcised engaged by this Ordinance
to attend on the Lord in all the Ordinances he should give untothem.

So that the Covenant fore-made by God with Mankind through Christ, was not in
this Covenant nulled or made void, or weakened; but included, and opened, and
farther help for the Observance of it, afforded to all the Circumcised, with
greater Encouragement by the Gospel more clearly taught, and the everlasting
Covenant held forth, to all that were or came to be of this Family of the
Circumcision: so, that the everlasting Covenant made with Abraham, by having
Circumcision annexed, did neither exclude nor hinder the eternal Salvation of
any in any Nation, that according to light and means believed, and lived to God
according to his Covenant made in and through Christ for and with Mankind;
Exodus 12.48.
only such as came not in to be circumcised, were deprived of those
Privileges of large Light, Means, Encouragements and Fellowship in Communion
therein, afforded by the everlasting Covenant to the circumcised. Surely, this
free and everlasting Covenant, is a blessed Covenant, no Covenant beyond it,
nor any could be good for us, that should in any sort make this void. So that
we look for no other Covenant, but only for another manner of making this,
namely, in Performance, (of which after.) And in the mean season, we will
enquire about such Covenants-making as are for our fartherance and help in
waiting for this. And as we read of a threefold Performance of this Covenant,
in three several times, first, In a literal part of it, when God did give the
Israelites rest in Canann by Joshua; Secondly, In the spiritual part of it, to
the Souls of Believers, when God sent Jesus Christ into the World, and gave him
for a Covenant; and the Covenant to be fully made according to Spirit and
Letter in Performance at Christ his glorious coming: so we shall find a
glorious Covenant made with Israel to tutor them till Christ's first coming;
and a Covenant made with all that believe in Christ, as he has come in the
flesh, and is given for a Covenant to tutor them till his next coming, when the
full will be given them. Let us take a view of each of these.

CHAP. 4.
Of the Covenant made with Israel in Moses time.

AFter Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs together with him, in
their times, had in the Faith of this everlasting Covenant, sojourned in the
Land of Promise a hundred ninety one years; the Children of Israel sojourned in
Egypt four hundred thirty years: And after that God in remembrance of this
Covenant brought them out of Egypt, to lead them into Canaan by Moses, Deuteronomy.
5.2, 3.
he made another Covenant with Israel, expressly called, Another: a Covenant God
made with them then at that time living, and not made with their Fathers, that
were before them; and this called, A Covenant also, frequently; and it had two
parts, both and each of them called, both Law and Covenant. I will mention both.

The first was called, The Ten Commands, or Ten Words; Exodus 34.28. Deuteronomy. 4.13.
and 10.4.
a holy and righteous Law, discovering more clearly then since Adam's fall was
fore-declared, all those righteous affections and services, which the kindness
of God to Man in the works of Creation required, and in his great Redemption
prepared for Mankind in Christ; and his Providence for preservation of, Exodus
20.1, 2, 3, etc. Deuteronomy. 5.6, etc. Mat. 22.37, 38, 39. Luke 7.27, 28. Romans 13.8,
9, 10.
and particular Mercies and Redemptions extended to Men through Christ, with
his Authority, do oblige and bind Men to: and so how they ought to love the
Lord their God with all their Heart, and Mind, and Soul, and Strength, and
their Neighbor as themselves: in which two Commands the whole Law is summed
up: and this part of the Covenant, as it is called the Covenant, so it is
called the Law.

The second was called, The Covenant of Levi, Numb. 25.12, 13 Nehem. 13.29.
Mal. 2.4.
or of the Priesthood, where in was more opened, then to our first Fathers,
Adam, Seth, Noah, etc. who offered Sacrifices: for in this was many Ordinances
of divine Service; and this was of things to be done about the Tabernacle or
Tempse, Heb. 9.1. Exodus 25, to 40 chapter and Levit. and Numb.
the Laver, Altar, Propitiatory; an Order of Priesthood, with Levites, and
their Services, Sacrifices, Washings, Purifications, Festivals, etc. and this
part also called, The Law, Heb. 7.12. and 10.1. And because this part, when
once discovered and commanded, Exodus 34.27, 28. Deuteronomy. 4, and 5. Ioh. 1.17.
was also enjoined in the Covenant and Law of Ten Words; therefore it, with
that, and so both together, are called The Covenant, and The Law. Now if we
mind the end of this Covenant-making and Law-giving; and how, and for what end
it was imposed on them, the whole Israel, or Circumcision, we shall find, That
in the whole, or either part of it, it was not put upon them, to put them in
such a sense under this Law, as by, and in the fulfilling, according to the
Precepts, they should indeed live, and get life, and so the Inheritance; Gal.
3.10. Deuteronomy. 27.26, Gal. 3.13. and 2.21. Romans 3.24, 25. and 4.4, 5. Tit. 3.4, 5,
6. Romans 4.13, 14. Gal. 2.17, 18, 21.
or if falling short, be condemned and perish for ever: for that was impossible
for any of the natural Race of fallen Mankind, so to get life, or escape the
curse; yea, so to get Life, were against the very sufferings and Sacrifice of
Jesus Christ, and the end thereof; and it is against the freeness of the Grace
of God, in justifying and saving, and against the Promise fore-made with
Abraham, and against receiving by Faith: and it neither was, nor could be
against any of these.

But this Law and Covenant was imposed and put on them for their tutoridge and
nurture, Gal. 3.19, 23, 24. and 4.1, 2, 3, 4.
as a Schoolmaster, till Christ the promised Seed should come, and be
manifested, as having completed his first work to be done in his own personal
Body. And the use of it in the nurture of them, is declared expressly in three
things:

1. Romans 3.19, 20, 23. and 4.15. and 5.20. Gal. 2.19 Romans 7.11, 12, 13, 24.
To discover their manifold and great sinfulness, and the shortness and vanity
of all their own Righteousness to get life; that hereby they might yield up
themselves as guilty to the sentence of the Law, and say Amen to the Curse, and
so die to all hopes in themselves, or by the Law, and so be prepared to
magnify Grace in the discovery of it more aboundly. This the first use of the
Covenant of Ten Words.

2. To lead them in all their Observation of Temple-Worships, Sacrifices, Heb.
7.19. and 8.5. and 9.11, 12, 13. Gal. 2.16.
and Types, to look to a better Hope, even to Jesus Christ to come, and his
Death and Sacrifice, etc. figured by them, that in believing on him to come,
Act. 15.9. and 13.38, 39
they might receive forgiveness of sins, and have their Hearts purified to live
to him, in the love of him and one another.

3. Having forgiveness and life through him, and so in him, Psa. 116.8, 9, 19.
and 116,1, 6, 15, 16. Romans 13.8, 9, 10. Gal. 5.13.
to show forth their love and thanks according to the light and strength
afforded them, according to the Rule of the Law in the Precepts thereof; so
waiting for him to come: and it, or rather they in it, should be so accepted as
Believers and thankful.

And this forementioned Law, given to this end, was the Covenant made with
them: in which we may clearly see, That the Covenant at first made through
Christ with Mankind, is not taken away from them in this; much less, made null
or void by it to any Man, no, not to Israel, but renewed, and more clearly
opened, with a great deal more usefulness, for their observance and benefit by
it, afforded in it. And so we may see clearly what the people on their parts
were obliged to in this Covenant; and that was not to make themselves
righteous, and get life by doing it; but by it to see their sinfulness and
desert of curse, and to look to and believe in him that was to come, for
pardon, and gracious helpfulness and life: and in Testimony of thanks,
according to their light and strength, Deuteronomy. 29.1, 10, 11.
to walk in the Observances of it, and so to worship the true God: and into
this Covenant Moses entered all the whole Circumcision then present and to come
till Christ came.

Yet here is not all the graciousness of God extended to them; for now under
this Law and Covenant, they had also with it, preached to, and taught among
them, the Gospel preached to Abraham concerning Christ the promised Seed, Deuteronomy.
18.18. and 30.11, 14. Romans 10.6, 8.
in whom was blessing for all Nations; and who should be the great Prophet to
whom all were to hearken, and in believing on whom they should be saved; and
also the Covenant made with their Fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; Deuteronomy.
4.31.
and so the Gospel and everlasting Covenant, was preached to them with, and in
a sort under the Law or Letter: and so though Moses was a Minister of that
Letter or Law of Performances, which in the Injunctions discovered sin, and
sentenced to death, and led to exercise in such Rites and Ceremonies as could
not purify the Consciences; yet he did therewith discover Christ to come, in
whom Remission and Purgation was to be found, and the Truth of all figured in
their Sacrifices and Types, Joh. 5.46. 2 Cor. 3.6, 13.
and the everlasting Covenant confirmed in him; in, and according to which, all
Truth should be performed: whence it is called, A glorious Ministration, though
veiled. And so it appears, in that this Covenant was given in the Hands of a
Mediator, one that should, and did stand between God and them for them to speak
with God, and bring and teach his Mind to them, and to present their Minds
and Distesses to God; and when, they sinned, and God was displeased, to stand
in the breach interceding and prevailing to turn away wrath, and procure
mercies for them; to give them the Ordinances, and set in order their
Tabernacle, Priesthood, Sacrifices, etc. and to go before them to conduct them
to Canaan; and so to them were committed the Word and the Oracles, and therein,
Romans 9.4.
the Adoption, (or means to bring Men in to beadopted) the Glory, (or his
presence in the Tabernacle among them) and the Covenants, (that made with
Abraham; and a little before this, we are now about the Ordinance of the
Passover made with them; and this in which also the Covenant fore-made with
Mankind was included) and the giving of the Law, (the Ministration and
carrying on of the Law and Ministry, given them of God by Moses the Mediator)
and the Services, (that is, the Exercises of this Ministry, and so the true
public Worship of the true God) and the Promises, (both of the first and
second coming of Christ; his Sufferings, Victory, Ministration and Reign, and
the Reign of his Seed with him; and so of the Holy Ghost to be the Teacher and
Leader of his Seed after his Suffering, from his Ascension, till his personal
coming again.) And thus God planted them a right noble Vine, Jer. 2.21.3. Hos.
9.18. Psalm. 147.19, 20.
wholly a right Seed: and so Israel was Holiness to the Lord, the first Fruits
of his increase; and he found the^^ (thus of his own planting and bringing
forth) like Grapes in the Wilderness, and as the first ripe in the Fig Tree,
And thus were they preferred before all Nations in the World, whom, though he
yet continued to them the means at first given, and Covenant at first made with
Mankind through Chrst, and so excluded them, not so from Salvation, Act.
10.34. Romans 2.4, 6, 15.
but that if any of them repented and believed, according to the means
vouchsafed, they should be saved; yet in respect of this knowledge of Christ,
and of any true outward form of worshipping God, and enjoyment of the
Privileges of this Commonwealth of Israel, they were strangers: and though in
coming to them, and being circumcised, Epb. 2.11, 12, 15.
they might partake with them; yet without that, none of any other Nation
could, which was for the time a Law of Ordinances and Handwriting against
them: so highly then did God prefer this People of Israel, that in respect
thereof, Psalm. 114.2. and 135.4. and 136.11, 14. Hos. 11.1. Exodus 4.22. Ezekiel.
20.5, 18, 19, 20. Josh. 22. See for all said, more, par. 3. chapter 3. Jer. 2.5,
21.22. Ezekiel. 20.7, 26. Jona 2.8, Romans 3.2, 3. and 9.5, 8.
they were his Sanctuary and his Dominion; yea, his chosen and peculiar
Inheritance that he had redeemed out of Egypt; yea, his Son, his firstborn,
whom he led to, and set in Canaan. In all which we may observe, That in this
was the first literal performance of the Covenant made with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob; and that these Covenants, and Promises, and Privileges were given to
whole Israel, in which they all had now more means then any other Nation, to
become of the true spiritual Seed, being, in respect of the worship set up
among them, and therein the outward Adoption, and means of the inward, wholly a
right Seed, and the Promises in that respect alike to all: yet such as
contemned and turned aside from these, degenerated into a strange Plant, and
lost their own Mercies; and such as in cleaving and attending to these, were
born of the Promise, they were the true spiritual Seed.

And thus much of the Covenant once made with Israel, the natural and
proselyted Seed of Abraham, that they might become a spiritual Seed, etc. and
we find this Covenant once made, to stand firm in all Generations, for every
one of Israel, till Christ came, without making it over again to the whole
Israel, or to particulars: and when Christ came and suffered for all the sins
the Law could charge with, and fulfilled in Truth that which was typed out in
their Order of Priesthood, Tabernacle, Laver, Altar, Propitiatory, Sacrifices,
and Washings; then was the Law fulfilled, and Truth found in him who is the end
of the Law for Righteousness: and yet there was among Israel another literal
performance of a part of the Covenant made with Abraham, viz. And Kings shall
come out of thee; Genesis 17.6. Psa. 78.70, 71, 72.
when he chose and gave David to be their King in Israel, to feed and govern
Israel; and then we find not only a reviving of the Covenant made with
Abraham, but in respect of that part of it which concerns the King and Kingdom
that shall be enjoyed in the promised Inheritance, more opened, and again made
with David for him and his Seed, which is to be considered also.

CHAP. 5.
Of the Covenant made with David concerning the Kingdom promised to him, for
him and his Seed.

WHat the Covenant made with David was, is express in 2 Samuel 7.10, 17. See also
par. 2. chapter 18.
and 1 Chronicles. 17.9-15. and Psalm. 89.20-37. full and large, and has been before
explicated in Part 3. Chap. 4. there read it: And I will here only add a few
Observations about it as a Covenant:

I. That this Covenant in the outward and literal form and manner of making it,
1 Samuel 7.13. and 23.2, 3, 4. Psalm. 89.30, 31, 32, 39.
and in the Declaration and Ministration of it, as to David and his natural
Sons, it was under the Law and Covenant made by God in Moses Ministration with
Israel; and so had many terms suitable thereto: so that by their breaking
Covenant, they might fail, and come short of this for a time, and this appear
as if failing them.

II. 2 Samuel 23.5. 1 Chronicles. 17.10, 14
That this Covenant was in it self, and in the spiritual making of it with
David, for him and his supernatural and enduring Seed, and his House, promised
absolute, free, everlasting, ordered in all things, stablished and sure; the
same, and as made with Abraham.

III. That this Covenant was confirmed with an Oath, as to Abraham before: The
Lord has sworn in truth unto David, Psalm. 132.11. and 89.34, 35, 36, 37.
he will not turn from it, Of the fruit of thy body, will I set upon thy
Throne: saying, My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my holiness, That I will not lie unto
David; his seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the Sun before me: it
shall be established for ever, as the Moon, and as a faithful witness in
heaven. Selah.

IV. That this Covenant being a part of the Covenant foremade with Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, is no other, but what was first made with and confirmed in
Christ, and then in and through Christ confirmed and made to Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob; and now in like manner, for this part of it explicated, made to and
with David, for him and his Seed, and for the good of all Nations that shall be
joined to them: what manner of Kingdom, and where, I leave the Reader to see in
the Texts, Par. 2. c. 18. Par. 3. c. 4. 1 Chronicles. 16.15, 19. Psalm. 105.8, 11.
and that fore-written. Hence this Covenant is included in, and minded in
minding that made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

V. That this being of the same Covenant made with Abraham, Romans 4.1, 5, 6, 9,
11, 12, 13.
(to which was added the outward sign of Circumcision) and given to the
circumcised, and under the Law; given to the Circumcision, and Circumcision
abiding in its force and use until Christ came, and that the Circumcision of
the flesh was completed in his sufferings, here needed no other outward Token,
or Sign, and Seal, to be added in this new making of the Covenant, it having
that very Sign and Seal before, and then remaining.

VI. That as the former making of this whole Covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, was, 2 Samuel 7.19, 24, 29. 1 Chronicles. 17.17, 27.
even so this part of it now made with David, is so made, that it might have
diverse times and degrees of fulfilling, as is also expressly to be found written.

The first fulfilling was according to the Letter, 1 King. 8.15, 20. 2 Chronicles
6.1, 10 1 King. 11.36.
suitable to the Covenant given by Moses that they were under; and this began
when Solomon was settled on the Throne of David, and had built the Temple, as is
confessed plainly; yea, and after a great breach, yet a continuance of fulfilling
avouched.

The second fulfilling is spiritual, Luke 1.31, 32, 33, 69, 70, 71, 74. Joh.
1.49. Act. 5.31, 32. 1 Pet. 3.23. Heb. 7, and 8. Psalm. 110.11. Col. 1.12, 13.
and that began when God sent forth Jesus Christ, and he had suffered and
overcome Death, and offered up the acceptable Sacrifice, and sat down on the
Right Hand of God, and received all fullness of Spirit in the Man, and sent
forth thereof to Men, to convince the Rebellious, and lead Believers into all
Truth; and so by that Spirit rule in the Hearts of his People, while they, as
he was, are strangers and sufferers here: and this is plainly confessed, and the
continuance likewise.

The third, Rev. 5.10. 1 These. 4.14, 15, 18. Psa. 102.16 Heb. 11.13, 40. Rev.
11.18.
last and complete fulfilling, is, That which shall be both spiritual and
literal, if I may use that term, because it shall be on Earth, though the Earth
renewed; and to Soul and Body, though both spiritual, etc. and to all Israel;
yea, this shall be to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the twelve Tribes of
Israel, and all the spiritual Seed together, even all that sleep in the Lord,
and all that are surviving at his coming, when Jesus Christ will personally and
visibly appear, and come and take unto him his great Power, and sit upon the
Throne of David in Jerusalem, and reign in Jerusalem, and over all Nations of
the Earth, and all Kings fall down before him, and all Nations serve him. And
the Covenant thus fulfilled, Heb. 11.14, 15, 16. 1 Chronicles. 16.15, 19. Romans 4.16.
Gal. 3.7, 8, 16, 26, 29. and 5.5. Levit. 26.44, 45. Deuteronomy. 4.31. Psalm. 105.8, 9.
1 Chronicles. 16.15, 16.
and this settlement and Kingdom, is that which is promised, and which all the
Fathers waited for through Faith; and which, all the spiritual Seed are to wait
for as Abraham's Seed, to whom through Promise it is sure by Faith, and they
have professed so to wait for it; the time, place, manner, prosperity, and
duration of it being foreshewn: and that God, for performance of this and the
whole Covenant made, and as made with the Fathers, Abraham, etc. has confirmed
for, and will perform it to their Seed, according to his Promise: he does for
this remember this Covenant, as made with them; and wills us so to heed, and
mind, and wait for it, as sure in Covenant as made with them; and directs us
not to look for another personal making of it to us, to make it surer to us, to
whom it is sure enough in that first making; in Faith whereof, we wait to
receive and enjoy it, and not for any other making, but the making in
performance.

The first fulfilling is past, as confessed, to begin with Israel and Solomon:
and if any conjecture, It was made again with Solomon; it is clear, it was not
made with him, 2 Chronicles. 7.18. and 6.16. 2 Chronicles. 7.16, 22. and 6.15, 16. 1 Samuel
12.20, 25.
as with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; nor as with David: but as both David and
Solomon, was under the Law given by Moses, and so God did graciously mind
Solomon of the Covenant fore-made with David, (as he often does Believers now)
without so making it over again with him; and so Solomon understood it: and he
promised Solomon the continuance of the Kingdom in that manner he had received,
according to his keeping of that Covenant given by Moses, and not otherwise;
and so he understood it: and such was the promise to all Israel, for the
continuation both of King and Land: and so the everlasting Covenant is fully
and surely already made; and other makings of it, I have not to treat of, nor
other Covenants to be made; but as they are Branches of this, and made in some
performance of this Covenant.

And so I shall mention three things in this business, according to the
performances of the Covenant made with Abraham; and that is, first, In his
sending forth, and giving Christ the promised Seed displayed in the Gospel: so
he has given him for a Covenant to be received by Faith. Secondly, In the
Dispensation of his Goodness and Spirit through Christ, he has given by Christ
a New Testament, for the nurture and guidance of Believers and Receivers to the
Inheritance. And lastly, In the coming again of Christ, the making the Covenant
by a complete Performance. I shall confider each of these.

CHAP. 6.
Of Jesus Christ being given for a Covenant.

GOD promised, Isa. 42.1, 6. and 49.8.
and according to his Promise has given Jesus Christ, The Seed of Abraham, of
David, The Savior of the World, and Propitiation for the sins of the whole
World: The Lord of all, and Head of the Church, that has satisfied the Law,
and is full of the Holy Ghost; The Heir, The King, The Son of David, and The
Son of God, for a Covenant to Believers, the People that are his Seed: so that
he is The Messenger of the Covenant, and he with whom the Covenant was first
made, and in whom it was confirmed to Abraham, Mal. 3.1. Gal. 3.16, 17. Heb.
9.16, 23. and 13.20. Psalm. 89.28. 2 Cor. 1.20. Heb. 8.1, 2, 6.
and has confirmed the Covenant with his own Blood; and with him the Covenant
stands fast for ever: so that all the Promises of God in him, are Yea, and in
him Amen; and he is The Minister of the Covenant, by whom God will perform all
that is in it. And so I shall here only, in what is implied or expressed in this
saying, That God has given him for a Covenant, consider what I am helped to
underdand.

1. That he is given for a Covenant, implies, That he is given or made to
appear in the Gospel, Joh. 1.18. Mat. 11.27. 2 Cor. 4.6. Heb. 1.2, 3. Isa.
42.1, 6. and 49.6. Genesis 3.15 1 Ioh. 3.5, 8. Genesis 12.3. 1 Ioh. 2.2. and 4.14.
Isa. 42.7. and 49.9.
that he may teach, and Men in beholding and minding him, may know the
Covenant, and so be brought in to him to enjoy it; which is a new, and clear,
and more alluring and powerful way of teaching it, and bringing to it, then
ever was before: so he is affirmed to be given for a Light to the Gentiles, and
to show forth judgment to them, and be God's Salvation to the ends of the
Earth. And this must needs be so, when he is set forth, who is the promised
Seed, that came to take away sins, and destroy the works of the Devil, the Seed
of Abraham in whom is blessing for all Nations, The Propitiation for the sins
of the whole World, The Savior of the World, given to open the blind eyes,
and bring out the Prisoners out of Prison, etc. that so the Hearers and
Beholders, may believe; and whoever believes, not perish, Joh. 3.16, 17. Isa.
42.1, 6. and 61.1, 2, 3, 4. Col. 1.19. and 2.3. Ioh. 1.9. Act. 13.47. and
28.17, 18. 1 Pet. 1.20, 21. Isa. 55.2, 3, 4. Joh. 1.12.
but have eternal life; yea, the Father witnesses this of him, and himself
says, He is filled with Spirit for this end; and the Holy Ghost testifies,
That all fullness is in him, and he enlightneth every one that comes into the
World. And that is the command of God to his Servants by the Gospel, to hold
him forth for a Light and Salvation, to open the eyes of Men, and turn them
from darkness to light, etc. that they may receive, etc. and God goes forth in
that Testimony, witnessing of, and glorifying him, that Men may believe on him,
and so receive the Covenant which-he gives to Believers. And this is above all
that was before for teaching and drawing.

2. That he is given for a Covenant to the People, Isa. 42.6. and 49.8. Genesis
3.29.
which implies and expresses, That the Covenant made with the Fathers for the
People, that is, those come in to believe, and so of Abraham's Family, to whom
the Covenant and Promises appertain, he is given for it; that though they yet
wait for the Inheritance, yet they have in him the Interest, Joh. 14.6. and
11.25. Act. 13.32, 33. Isa. 55 2, 3, 4. Act. 13.34. Ioh. 17.10. 1 Cor. 1.30.
and 3.22, 23. Heb. 8.1. Col. 2.9, 10. Act. 3.26. and 13 34, 37. Act. 3.19. Col.
3.4. 1 John 3.2.
the Root, the Assurance, and certain Hope; for he is The Way, The Truth, The
Life; yea, The Resurrection and The Life, yea, The Promise: and so we may say
The Covenant; for he as risen from the dead, is called, The sure Mercies of
David, in giving which, the everlasting Covenant is at least spiritually made;
for he is he, in whom the everlasting Covenant is sure, and sure to be
performed, and the making it in performance sure in him: so as in giving him to
Believers, all is in and with him given; and believing in him, all is so
received; in enjoying and possessing him by Faith, all is enjoyed and possessed
in and with him by Faith; if Christ be ours, all is ours, Jesus Christ raised
from the dead, and glorified in the Nature of Man, the fullness of the Godhead
dwelling in him bodily, Believers are complete in him; and God in giving him in
the Ministration of the Gospel, gives blessing, and the sure Mercies of David,
and the first fruits of the Spirit: and sending him again visibly, it is to
restore all things, and to taign, that Believers may reign with him, and so
have all the fullness of the everlasting Covenant. What other Oracle, what
Temple, Sacrifice, Priesthood, what Knowledge or Gifts, what Covenant-making
with us, what Inspiration or personal giving a Promise to us, can be like this,
to secure us? this is the choicest Testimony of God's Love, and our Interest in
the Covenant, to have Christ given for a Covenant; and in believing on him as
he is set forth in the Gospel, the greatest security and assurance is received:
God that spared not his Son, Romans 2.4. Joh. 1.4, 9.
but delivered him up to death for all Mankind, will, and certainly does
through him extend patience, bounty, mercy and means to bring Men in to believe
on his Son whom he is so giving to them; yet such as believe not, receive him
not, and so have him not as so given them; and those that through unbelief have
not Christ, Joh. 3.6.
whatever they have through Christ, and for his sake, yet they have no eternal
life, no Interest or part in the everlasting Covenant: for eternal life, and
all pertaining to the everlasting Covenant, is so in Christ, 1 John 5.10, 11,
12, 13. Joh. 1.12.
that there is no receiving or enjoyment of it; but in receiving or enjoying
him, which is yet only by believing in him; and in believing in his Name, we
receive him, and he gives these privileges.

So then, if God that gave his Son for us, do so give him to us, Romans 8.32.
Ioh. 1.12.
as we be helped in believing to receive him, he will with him, and as he
gives him to us, give us all things freely; and in receiving Christ, he will
communicate the same to us, according to his order in his first and second
coming: and of the Dispensation by his first coming, and the Hope of that in
his second coming, is here treated and meant: and so his being given for a
Covenant to Believers, can be no less then to be given for a Witness, Isa.
53.3, 4.
Testimony and Seal of God's Mercy, Love, Righteousness, Immutability, and
Faithfulness, to perform to them this everlasting Covenant, and to be the He in
whom they may discern and see all for them in him, Col. 2.3, 9, 10. Ioh. 14.19.
1 Pet. 1.4. Rev. 1.18. Heb. 19.15. and 10.2, 6, 10, 11.
and by him safely kept, who by his power will through Faith keep them till he
bring them to it, and in mean season to be the Mediator of this Covenant, that
they may receive the promised Inheritance; and the Minister of it, to be
dispensing a first Fruits to them in these waiting Days; and this, that he that
has our Nature, and loves us, etc. is given us for a Covenant of the people,
it is a great and strong consolation, and there is nothing to be valued with
it, to give us rest, assurance and establishment. This the way to receive it,
in receiving him; and to be established, in resting and abiding in him: which
that we may do, here is one word more caught us for our safe guidance and
tutoridge, till we come to the Inheritance.

3. In that he is said to be given for a Covenant of the People, as he is for a
Light to the Gentiles, implies, That he is given to give a New and Testamental
Covenant, a new Law for the Nurture and Tuition of those that are the Sons of
God by Faith, Jon. 1.17. and 8.35, 36. Gal. 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 7. Romans 3.27. Gal.
5.1, 5. Iam. 2.12. Romans 7.25. and 8.2, 3, 4. 2 Cor. 3.6, 7, 8, 9.
that they may be led and preserved to the Inheritance promised, and kept by
him for them: that given by Moses, was to nurture the Sons or People of God,
but under tutoridge as Servants, suitable to the Servant, by whom that Law was
given: but this given by Christ, is to nurture the Sons or People of God in
freedom, as adopted Sons, suitable to the Son of God, by whom this Law is
given. That, by Moses, was a Law of Works; this, by Christ, a Law of Faith:
that, by Moses, a Law of Bondage; this, by Christ, a Law of Liberty: that a Law
of Sin and Death; this of Righteousness and Life: that a Law of Letter; this of
Grace and Spirit; that a Ministration of Sin, of Condemnation, of Death; this a
Ministration of Righteousness, of Justification and Life. And that Jesus Christ
is given for a Law in this sense, to give this gracious Law and Testament, is
clearly expressed: A Law shall proceed from me, Isa. 51.4 and 42.1, 4. and 8.16,
20.
etc. And he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. -- And the Istes
shall wait for his Law. And, Bind up the Testimony, seal the Law among my
Disciples. I think none that believe the Gospel, deny this: but we do not all
agree what this Law, or New Testamental Covenant is.

1. Some say, It is the Gospel: and in this saying there is Truth; Genesis 12.3.
Gal. 3.8.
for it is good News which was promised and is discovered in the Gospel: but
the Gospel was preached to Abraham before the everlasting Covenant was made
with him; and he, and Isaac, and Jacob, after the making of the everlasting
Covenant, sojourned in the Faith thereof, a hundred ninty one years in the Land
of Promise: and after that, the Children of Israel sojourned four hundred
thirty years in Egypt, before the giving of the Testament given by Moses, under
which the Gospel was preached also, Heb. 8.13.
and did not make that Testament old or decayed, as the coming in of the New
Testament does: so, though Truth be in this saying, yet it answers not the
Question at all, What New Testament is.

2. Some say, The New Testament is the Gospel as now declared since Jesus
Christ came in the flesh, and died, and rose, and offered the acceptable
Sacrifice, and sent forth the Holy Ghost. Surely, they that then preached him
to come, and do all this, preached Gospel; yet was the first Testament a
distinct thing then, besides this. And so those that now preach him come, and
having done all this, preach good and true Gospel; yet the New Testament may
yet be some farther distinct thing, then yet mentioned in it, though I confess
this saying has much Truth in it, and more tending to satisfaction then the
former; Isa. 42.6. and 8.16.
but yet it satisfies not, because of that said before, and because all here
mentioned is preached in his being a Light to the Gentiles, and that is
somewhat peculiar to be for a Covenant of the People, besides the everlasting
Covenant, as to be made in complete performance, is mentioned in the Gospel
also: so that there is more in the Gospel then New Testament, though all in the
Gospel, as now come forth, is to be preached under the New Testament, as the
Gospel was before preached under the old. So this saying shows not what the New
Testament is, to any satisfying.

3. Some say, The everlasting Covenant made with Abraham: now the old Covenant
that shadowed it, is taken away by the coming of Christ, and that so clearly
opened in the Gospel, that is therefore called, The New Testament. This has
much Truth in it, and comes nigh to satisfying, leaving room for Faith without
Mosaical Observances, to lay hold on this Covenant, as confirmed in Christ to
Abraham, Heb. 8.6. and 10.19.
and to wait for the making of that Covenant in performance to all the Seed.
And this might seem to be grounded on Heb. 8, But when I consider, That the
Holy Ghost speaks there of Laws, Heb. 8.10. and 10.16.
and says, I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them upon their
hearts. whereas the Prophet mentions but one Law, I^r. 31.23.
saying, I will put my Law in their inward parts, etc. this gives me to
conceive a twofold performance of that Jer. 31.33, 34. one spiritual only to
the Sons of God by Faith, in and by the first coming of Christ; the other
literal and spiritual, both on Soul and Body, at the second coming of Christ;
of which the Prophet more especially speaks, including the former, and so
leaving room for a New Testamental Covenant to come in, and remain from the
first coming of Christ to the second, in stead of that old faulted Covenant.
Ier. 31.32.
And the Apostle speaking there more especially of the first coming of Christ,
and things done thereby, including the second coming and things to be then
done, he speaks of both Laws; the first whereof is the New Testament, as shall
after be shown, and does here also in this, That the Prophet expressly, and the
Apostle inclusively, speaks of a time yet to come, saying, After those days,
that is, Ier. 31.8, 31, 32. Heb. 8.10.
when God has brought both Israel and Judah together into their own Land, and
converted them. Besides, here is that mentioned, that shall be, but is not done
to any Believer in this life, nor fully will, till it be done to them all
together, at that day, as so to know him, as they shall teach no more every Man
his Brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know him (note this
well) from the least of them to the greatest of them, (and what time that is,
the Apostle tells us) and he so forgives iniquity, as he will remember their
sins no more; no, 1 Cor. 13 9, 10. 1 Job. 3.2. Ier. 31.33, 34. Heb. 8.11, 12.
not by any corruption abiding in them, or any weakness on them in Soul or
Body; any pain, hunger, thirst, mortality or death, as the Spirit explicates it
to us, Rev. 21.3, 4. so that not only the New Testament, but somewhat more,
even the whole everlasting Covenant as made with Abraham and David, is in Heb.
8.10, 11. which Covenant being made, and lived in, so long before the first
Testament, did not make that Testament old; no, nor yet the renewing of it to
David: so that cleerness of satisfying, is not yet in this saying; and yet
truly, this everlasting Covenant made with Abraham, and renewed to David,
signed with Circumcision, the literal fulfilling as typical both for the
Inheritance and King, being over, the spiritual fulfilling begun by Christ,
completed in him, manifested, and extended by him, and the first Fruits
received, and receiving by the spiritual Seed; Romans 8.23, 24, 25. 1 Pet. 1.3, 9.
and the Harvest, and full of the Covenant in Soul and Body is that we wait
for: so that this very Covenant is the Flower of our Hope, and it is confirmed
in Christ, begun to be performed in and by him, and given in him, and he given
for a Covenant, and in believing in him, and receiving him, it is by Faith
received, and Hope of real receipt enjoyed, a blessed Hope.

If any say, But the outward Sign and Seal of the Truth of this Covenant to
testify withal, which Abraham had, is wanting to us:

I answer, That typical fulfillings of the Covenant are over; and Circumcision,
as it was a Seal, so it was a Type and Figure also, Blood being shed in it; and
what it did typisie and figure forth, the Spirit and Truth figured is found in
the Circumcision, Sufferings and Death of Jesus Christ: Phil. 3.3, 4, 7, 8, 9.
Col. 2.9, 10, 11, 12.
which Spirit and Truth, is so in Christ, that whoever believes in him, is
interested in the same, and it is become his, and he receives the Circumcision
made without Hands, even that of the Spirit, taking him off from all confidence
in the Flesh, that he may rejoice in Christ only, as complete in him; and so,
that Jesus is the Christ, That he had put an end to all bloody Ordinances and
Sacrifices for sin, That he has made purgation for our sins, to purge us with,
and then sat down on the Right Hand of God; and the everlasting Covenant firm
in him, and he filled with Spirit to dispense; and so set forth the Savior of
the World, and Propitiation for the sins of the whole World, that whoever
believes in him may not perish, but have everlasting Life; and so his part in
this everlasting Covenant: Compare Genesis 17.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. and Exodus 12.48,
49. with Mat. 28.18, 19, 20. and Act. 16.33. Col. 2.11, 12.
for all this we have an outward Sign and Testimony, more significant, easy
and free then Circumcision was, even Baptism, etc. to be put on all that accept
this Gospel on them, and all under their Tuition, as a Sign given from Christ,
to testify (not the Truth of the Repentance and believing of such as are
baptized, but) the Truth of the Faith, Gospel, and Covenant taught; and so
disciple into Abraham's Family to be the Scholars of Christ, who needs not
(as humane Schoolmasters) to have his Scholars bring their capacities and
fitness with them; for he even gives that also: and as Circumcision and the
Passover were Ordinances of the Gospel, in which Christ to come in the flesh,
was preached, and both before the first Testament; and yet when that given,
were both used under it: so Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord, are both
Ordinances of the Gospel, in which Christ is preached as already come in the
flesh, and to come in Glory, Romans 3.27. and 8.2. Iam. 2.8, 12.
and both instituted before the New Testament was given from Mount Sion, yet
now both used under it. But the new Testament it self will verily appear to be
something distinct, even that Law of Faith, of Life, of Liberty, for nurturing
Sons, and in which Believers are to walk in this Life. So that yet in this
saying we are not satisfied.

3. Some say, That the New Testament is Christ his Dispensation of a spiritual
first Fruits of the everlasting Covenant into the Hearts and Mind of the
Believers, in putting in by his Spirit, his gracious Word into their Heart; and
so enlivening and operating in them, as to unite and conform them to himself,
and so lead them to the Inheritance. This saying is Truth, and fully proved in
Heb. 8.6, 10. and 10.15, 16. agreeing with 2 Cor. 3.3. and does more satisfy
according to Scripture then all, or any of the former: and in this I long
rested, as if it were the whole of the Truth, as indeed it is a part, and the
chief part of it; and that which according to the New Covenant in his present
Ministration he dispenses: and in that respect also, is rightly said to be
given for a Covenant. And in this Dispensation given, a New Testament is given:
which, what that is, I will assay to find out and delare.

CHAP. 7.
Of the New Testamental Covenant, what it is.

THe New Testament is that Rule and Order agreed on between the Father and the
Son in the council of God, both for Christ his Dispensation, and the Believers
Receipt and Perseverance, to which the Covenant has Engagements on both parts,
as that given by Moses had, though not the like Engagements; for these two
Testaments are one opposed to the other: and by comparing the one with the
other in their Agreements and Differences, and the excellency of the New above
the Old, as declared in Scripture, and the Scripture-Expressions of the New, I
conceive we may come to the cleerest and fullest satisfaction to know indeed
what the New Testament is.

1. They were both given by God, by and in the Hands of a Mediator; Gal. 3.19,
20. Heb. 9.15. and 3.1, 6. Romans 7, 10, 13. Gal. 2.19, 21. and 3.21, 22. 2 Cor.
3.6, 11. Gal. 4.24, 25, 26, 17. Heb. 12.18.22. Deuteronomy. 5.23. Gal. 3.17, 18, 19,
25. Heb. 3.2, 4, 5, 6, 10. Exodus 20.1, 2. Psalm. 81.10. Act. 26.18. Col. 1.12,
13.
but not both by one and the same Mediator: the one, the Servant; the other,
the Son: they were both ordained to life, and so had the same end, but not to
effect it in the same way; but the one preparing by terrifying and killing, the
other extending it by consolation and quickening: they were both given on, and
from a great Mountain; but not the same Mountain, but the one Mount Sinai,
gendring to Bondage; the other Mount Sion, giving to Freedom: they both were
given after the Covenant made with Abraham, and so distinct Covenants made
besides that; and that by Moses first, being no part of the Covenant made with
Abraham, but only subservient to it: and this by Christ after, that by Moses,
and so no part of that, yet having in it the quintessence of the Covenant first
made with Mankind through Christ, and the first Fruits of the Covenant made
with Abraham, they were both made with a People redeemed; not only redeemed in
a public Man, from perishing in the first death, as all men were; but also
called and redeemed in their own persons, out of great bondage and servitude,
to be led to Rest or Canaan: yet not both alike: the one out of an Egyptian,
worldly and bodily bondage, to go to an Earthy Rest or Canaan; the other out of
a spiritual bondage in the darkness and pollutions of this World, and the
powerful Dominion of Satan, to be led to an heavenly Inheritance, Rest and
Glory: they were both given for nurture and tutoridge of Sons, Gal. 4.1, 8, 21,
31.
having both their Directions and Requirings, yet not both alike, but the one
to tutor as a School Master, though Sons, yet under some bondage like Servants,
suitably directing to, and requiring Works; the other to tutor as Sons in the
Father's House and Presence with Freedom, and its requirings not like the other
(of obedience in works in the strength they had, not putting in new strength to
do) but of the use of Faith and Love given, Gal. 5.6. 2 Cor. 6.1, 2. Phil.
2.12, 13. Deuteronomy. 4.1. and 31.5, 6. Romans 10.5. Joh. 7.37, 38, 39. Heb. 8.2, 6.
Heb. 9.12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 22. Exodus 32. and 34. Deuteronomy. all.
affording in all its requirings, strength for the exercise of them: they both
had their Promises annexed, but not both like Promises; the one of an earthy
Inheritance, with promise of Presence and Assistance in the way upon their
keeping his Commandments given in doing them; the other of an heavenly
Inheritance, with promise in their believing, of Spirit to teach, assist,
comfort and lead them. They both were confirmed with Blood, but not with like
Blood; the one with the Blood of Bullocks and Goats, the other with the
precions Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. They both had the Mediator, in whose
Hands they were given to officiate between God and the People, to make known
the mind of God unto the people, and teach and guide them, and to deal for the
People with God, in Prayer for the pardon of their sins, and continuance of
Mercies and Helps, that they might come to the promised Rest; but they were not
both alike: the one was a faithful Mediator, a Man of Peace, and loving the
People, Heb. 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and 8.1, 6. and 7.25.
yet not a Prince of Peace, that could create or instill Peace into the People,
nor sway their Hearts to his directions, nor could he enter them into that
Canaan: but the other, the Son of God, and Son of Man, Emmanuel, God with us,
one with God, and one with us, the Prince of Peace, that can create and infuse
it, and is able to save to the utmost all that come to God by him.

I might add two things more, namely, That they both had the Gospel and
everlasting Covenant, Deuteronomy. 4.34. and 30.11, 15. Romans 10.4, 5, 6, 10. 2 Cor.
3.3, 4, 5, 6, 18.
to preach in and under the Ministration of the Testaments; but the one in and
with the Letter, giving no Life, but requiring doing for Life; and the other in
and with the Spirit, giving Life, requiring only believing, and so receiving
that which would work, in which they might live. And they both had Ministers;
the one Elders, Priests, and Levites, to minister the first Testament, in which
was carnal Observances; the other Apostles and Ministers in preaching the
Gospel, to hold forth and minister the New Testament, in which his Spirit goes
forth to write it in the Hearts of Men. In all which Agreements and Differences
between them, and the excellency of the New Testament above the Old, we may
conceive what probably the New Testament is. And yet with all this,

2. That chiefly to be minded, is that general and positive Rule, Gal. 2.20.
Gal. 3.20. A Mediator is not of one, but God is one. If this new Covenant were
such, as those with whom it was once made, were in no sort Transgressors, or
alienated from God; or if the Covenant were so made, that the People with whom
it is made, there could be no Transgression on their part, occasioning
displeasure, and difference; then there would have needed no Mediator of this
Testament.

If any say, There needed a Mediator to make peace between God and fallen
Mankind:

This is very true; but here is treated of a farther Mediation that is by
virtue of that Blood, Heb. 9.15.
by which that Peace was fore-made by the Mediator.

If any say, There needs such a Mediator with God for procuring Patience,
Ephesians. 2.13, 14, 16, 17, 18. 1 Timothy 2.5.
Mercies, and Means to bring in fallen Mankind, for whom the Peace is made,
that they may know it, and believe:

This is very true also, and Jesus Christ is so the Mediator also: but yet the
Mediation here treated of, is a Mediation for those, who by his former
Mediation are brought in to him, and in Covenant with him: for it is the
Mediation of a new Covenant coming in after, and making old that by Moses.
Abraham was first called and found faithful with God, and then he made the
everlasting Covenant absolutely with him, which was confirmed in Christ the
Mediator, but not then mentioning a Mediator to mediate for his enjoyment of
it, being immediately given. But when a Covenant is expressed to be given in the
hands of a Mediator, and the Mediator set to be the Mediator of that Covenant,
that those covenanted with may receive and enjoy that promised; there is an
import of some weaknesses, and breaches, and dangers thereby, in those for whom
the Mediation is made, that they may be preserved to receive. Till I saw this,
I judged the first Fruits of the everlasting Covenant, to be the New Testament
verily and only; and so this New Testament to be as absolutely made, and as
free from all respect of any thing on the Believers part, as the Covenant made
with Abraham was, or that with Noah either. But now I see my thoughts must be
rectified: yet is this no discouragement nor damage to me, nor need be to any,
Romans 8.32, 36. and 5.8, 10. Heb. 9.14, 15. and 8.2, 6, 10. and 7.25. Ephesians. 5.25,
26, 27. Isa. 61.4. See par. 2. chapter 13.
considering what a Mediator we have, what he has done for us, how he is
furnished for us, how virtuous his Blood is, and how for that cause he is the
Mediator of this better Testament consisting of better Promises, even to this
end, That the called may receive the promised Inheritance. This being his work,
to wash and cleanse Believers, that he may present them spotless, and to give
them beauty for ashes, etc. so that here is strong consolation against our
weakness. And in all hitherto said, we may discern, that the New Testament is
something more then the Declaration of the Gospel as now come forth, in
mentioning the beginnings, or declaring the Covenant made with Abraham, or
declaring the New Testament it self: and yet something less then the New
Covenant as made with Abraham, or as to be made with him and all his Seed
together: and though a Dispensation of the first Fruits of the Spirit of the
everlasting Covenant, be in this New Testament; yet that is also according to
the New Testament, both held forth and dispensed: and if that already said,
will not show what it is, I will assay to more cleerness.

3. For Scripture Expressions to help us, I shall put a few to be considered,
Joh. 1.17. The Law was given by Moses, but Grace and Truth came by Jesus
Christ. Here is first affirmed, That the Law, that requiring so exact a
Righteousness as it discovered, and in every one sin sentenced to the Curse;
yea, even for the least short coming, and so killing, and that of Levi and the
Priesthood enjoining so many Sacrifices and Ceremonies to be done, or else
every Transgression received a just Recompense of Reward; and though done, yet
they did not purify the Conscience, nor make the comers to them or doers of
them perfect; but only shadowed out him that was to come, that they might look
to him and be saved. This Law came by Moses: God gave this Covenant by him.

But Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ. This next affirmed: Grace, that is,
free, undeserved and rich Favor and Mercy, in forgiving sins, and accepting
into Favor and Sonship by Jesus Christ that died for our sins, and so
fulfilled Truth, and satisfied Justice, and so made the Atonement, and rose
just, as the public Man, for our Justification, and ascended to Heaven, and
offered the acceptable Sacrifice, and obtained eternal Redemption; and so is
the Propitiation for our sins, and Grace is only by him. And Truth: that is,
fulfilling of the Promises, he being immeasurably filled with the Holy Ghost in
our Nature, and the fullness of the Godhead dwelling in him bodily, he is The
Temple of God, the High Priest, The Laver of Regeneration, the Altar, the
Sacrifice, The Propitiatory, The Oracle, etc. the Truth of all figured by those
is in him, and so by him, and had in having him: and this virtuous from the
beginning; and so even then, though in a more hidden way, Grace and Truth came
by Jesus Christ. But now he has come and done his first Work, this mystery is
manifested, and the Spirit has testified of him: and this Testimony is Spirit
and Life, by which such as are led to believe in Christ, do meet with Truth,
and so are said to worship him in Spirit (this gracious Law opposed to that of
Works and Types) and in Truth, (acknowledging the Truth in Christ, and meeting
with him in believing on him, as having done his first work for them, Job.
4.21, 22, 24. 1 John 5.19, 20.
and now about the other in them, and so they worship God in and through him:
and that they might thus do, God has done and provided all this in his Son,
and so made him known. And so upon this account of Christ his being so full of
Grace and Truth, and having been so manifested also in the Nature of Man, John
Baptist in respect of himself, and the first witnesses, renders it in these
words, Joh. 1.14, 16, 17
verse. 17. as the ground of that he affirmed verse. 16. For of his fullness have
we all received Grace for Grace: other profitable senses of this noted before:
I only now note this, That as Moses received a Law of works and shadows to
nurture the people, Par. 3. chapter 4.
that in judging themselves for their sins by one part of the Law, and looking
to Christ that was to come, in their use of the Types, (the other part of the
Law) they might through Christ receive Grace, as all that so looked did: but he
having come, has abounded farther to us, and we have of him received Grace, a
Gospel of Grace, with a Law of Grace, and a Spirit of Grace, discovering the
Atonement made, and forgiveness in the Blood of Christ, and Truth fulfilled in
him: so by the Grace of God in that Cross of Christ, he suffered, to show Men
the vileness of their sins, the vanity of their Righteousness, and yet through
the same Cross to show them the great Love, Righteousness and Propitiousness of
God, the pardon of their sins in the Blood of Christ, and the fullness of Love
and Spirit in Christ to draw them in to believe; assuring them in believing
they shall receive forgiveness, etc. and so we have Grace, that we may receive
and declare Grace; and God has engaged himself, that he will so witness of
Christ, Isa. 42.1, 8. and 55.5. Joh. 3.15, 16. Romans 10.9, 10, 13, 15. Act.
15.9, 10, 11. Gal. 5.6. 1 John 3.23. 1 Pet. 1.3, 4, 5. 1 Ioh 1.7, 9.
and he shall so far proceed with Men where the Gospel comes, that they shall
have their eyes opened, that they may see and believe; and has also engaged
himself to all, that where the Gospel comes, do according to the Light and
Power he gives, believe on him, he will save, pardon, and enlive them, and
write his Law in their Hearts. And this Faith working Love, he puts no
farther burden or yoke on any, but to believe him, and love one another; and he
will preserve them through Faith to the Inheritance; and if they fail, confess
their failing, and through the Mediator, they shall be forgiven and cleansed.
And thus far the New Testament is, and is to be held forth to all that live
under the Gospel: and all the baptized in the Name of the Lord, have set their
Hands to this Engagement, and may live in hope of having it personally made
with them: but yet the personal making of this New Testament with Believers, is
yet a farther business: see how that is expressed in Scripture also, 2 Cor. 3.3.
Tea, are manifestly declared the Epistle of Christ, ministered by us; written
not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in Tables of Stone,
but in the fleshly tables of the heart. It is express throughout this Chapter,
That the Apostle speaks here of the New Testament opposed to the Old Testament:
and so likewise it is evident here, That in preaching the Gospel as now come
forth, they did also therein minister the New Testament: 1 Cor. 1.6, 7.
and so it is here also evident, That when Men in believing the Testimony of
Christ in the Gospel, come to believe on Christ, then they receive the New
Testament: and how they receive it, and what it is, see here.

1. Phil. 3.3, 7, 8, 9
In believing on Christ, the Grace believed, breaks the stoniness of the
Heart, and takes down the pride and stoutness of it, and humbles and melts
it, and enamoreth it with Christ, and so makes the Heart fleshy, tender,
flexible fit to receive his Sayings, Teachings, and Impressions. And then,

2. His making the New Covenant with them is begun, by writing his Mind, Heb.
8.10. 2 Cor. 4.13. 2 Timothy 1.7.
his Design, his Epistle, by his own Spirit in their so prepared Heart, giving
into their Heart the Spirit of Faith, of Love, of Power, and of a sound Mind:
so that they have in them a new Heart, a new Spirit, a new Man, an inward
living Principle derived from the Fountain in which they believe, inclining
them to love God and their Brother, and to live by Faith, and walk in Love, and
so to seek the farthering of his design, in seeking the Honor of God in the
Salvation of Men, and the Prosperity of his Church: so looking and waiting for
the coming of the Lord, the Spirit herein springing up Love, Romans 8.28.
Joy, Peace, etc. And this is a Dispensation of a spiritual first Fruits of the
everlasting Covenant made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and no otherwise made
with any since, excepting David about the Kingdom; but in such a
begun-performance. But then minding the words, and the Apostles scope in this
place, with other places speaking of the same business, and we shall see, That,

3. In this Dispensation of Grace by his Spirit, there is made a double
Engagement, on the part of Christ, and on the part of the Believers: in which
respect it is rightly called a New Testament, in opposition to the Old
Testament given by Moses: which also in this Dispensation, is written not with
Ink as the Old Testament was; nor in Tables of Stone, as one part of that was;
nor in Leaves of Parchment, or any such thing, as another part of that was: but
even in their Heart; that is, That Jesus Christ will follow them, Joh. 14.16,
17, 26. and 16.13, 15. Joh. 15.4, 11. Gal. 5.5, 6.
in sending his Spirit to teach, lead, comfort, and guide them, as has been
shown in his Purposes and Promises; and on their part, that they abide in him,
and so walk in Faith that works by Love, waiting through the Spirit for the
Righteousness of God in all these Promises by Faith, In which, living by Faith,
they shall be daily nourished with the Grace, Strength and Goodness, of the
Divine Nature in Christ; and so to walk in Love, which will fulfill all the
Righteousness the Law requires of them, and also on their parts in case by any
Forgetfulness or Temptation, 1 John 1.7, 9.
they fail in the exercise of their Faith and Love, and so be drawn aside to
serve some lusts of the flesh, that they then confess their sins, and crave
pardon and healing in his Name; and he for his part engageeth to heal them, and
so to keep them through Faith unto Salvation, ready to be revealed in the last
times: and for help of their weakness, he has afforded them his Ordinances to
attend, Mat. 28.20. Joh. 13, and 14, and 15, and 16. 1 John 1.9. 1 Ioh. 3.23. 1
Ioh. 4.21. Joh. 14.21. Prove. 3, and 4, and 6.
in which he has promised to meet with them and bless them: all these things
are shown before in the Purposes and Promises. The Engagements on Christ's part
are seen in his Promises of Spirit and Healing, and the Engagements on
Believers parts seen in his command to them, affirming such as are his to have
his commands in them: and these commands they are, That Christ in the Name of
Wisdom, charge his Sons to keep in the midst of their Heart. And so we may
see in these three foresaid points what the New Testament is: nor can any thing
here required be grievous to any that are in this New Testamental Covenant. For,

4. Romans 8.1, 2, 3, 4. There is therefore no condemnation to them that are in
Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. What
Consolation is this? for such as through believing the Testimony of Christ are
brought from under the bondage of the Law and Old Covenant, Romans 7.1, 2, 4, 6.
Gal. 5.16, 17, 18. Romans 7.14, 17, 20.
into this New Covenant with Christ, to bring forth fruit to God, and serve in
newness of Spirit, though they have flesh in them, which lusts against the
Spirit, and much trouble thereby, so as many infirmities be found in them, and
some failings; yet if they allow not the same, and so yield not to walk after
the flesh, make not that their Way and Trade: but walk after, that is, allow,
like, and yield up themselves, to live, sow to, and walk after the Spirit, (the
Law of Grace proceeding from the Testimony of Christ believed in their heart)
if according to the Light, Strength and Motion given into their Hearts, from
this Spirit, they do delight in the Law of God, and desire and will to walk in
it; and so yield themselves to walk: their wants and weaknesses which they
would not, are not charged on them: there is no reproof, no condemnation from
God, from Law, from Conscience, that shall wound them, nothing that shall break
their peace, none, to them. And this the Apostle delivers positively, as very
Truth, and then sets to his Seal, rendering his own experience of the same
Truth; for he also had his flesh, his carnality, his Law in the Members,
rebelling against the Law of his Mind, and so both disabling him from doing
all that good he would, and carrying him as a Captive to the Law of sin, which
discovered his sinfulness; and of Death, sentencing him to death: the beholding
of which, caused a cry; yet believing on Christ, he saw and found deliverance:
so that this Law discovering sin, and sentenced to death, had not power to
fasten its condemnation on him: For (says he) the Law of the Spirit of life in
Christ Jesus has made me free from the Law of sin and of death. Romans 8.2.
As if he should have said, Though it discover sin in me, and sentence death
upon me, yet it cannot fasten on me to condemn me; for I looking to Jesus
Christ that has suffered and made peace for sinners, in believing on him; The
Law of the Spirit of life in Christ, has made me free, Joh. 8.36.
etc. And this also he builds on the true and sure Foundation that is laid open
for all, and gives a general Rule, saying, verse. 3. For what the Law could not
do, in that it was weak through the flesh, Romans 8.3.
(the Law given by Moses discovering sin and sentencing to death, was in it
self good and holy, and promised life on performance; but could not give it,
because of the weakness of flesh, so, as Men could neither satisfy in
performance, nor yet in suffering the punishment, but they would have perished
in it: but) God sending his own Son in the similitude of sinful flesh, and for
sin, (or because of sin, or by making him a Sacrifice for sin) condemned sin in
the flesh, (even executed judgment on the flesh or Nature of Mankind that
sinned, in the person of his own Son, as the public Man in the room of
Mankind, and that to this farther end) that the righteousness of the Law (the
life it promised, and could not give us, and the righteous affections and love
services it required, not affording strength to bring them forth) might be
fulfilled in us, Romans 8.4.
(us that believe in Christ, and so are in him, having received Remission of
sins, and Spirit, with a new inclination, that it might by degrees be fulfilled
in us) who walk not after the flesh, (that is, delight not in, and approve the
Wisdom, Righteousness, Confidence, Affections and Lusts of the flesh, which
were all condemned and crucified, in Christ his being condemned and crucified
upon the cross for us; so that we make not this flesh our Lord and rule, and
our way to walk after it) but after the Spirit, In eyeing and believing in this
Blood and Cross of Christ, and accepting it; Romans 3.25. and 4.5, 23, 24. and
5.5, 8, 10.
so believing on him, of whom the Spirit testifies, admiring the Grace the
Spirit commends therethrough, and according to the Light and Grace thereby
given in the inward Man, delighting in this Law of God, Law of Grace, of Faith,
of Liberty, the Law of the Spirit of life: and so taking it as our Rule, do
will, incline, and yield to make that our trade, to walk therein, Jam. 1.25.
and 2.12. Romans 6.14. 1 John 1.7. Romans 2, and 3, and 4, and 5, and 6, and 7, and
8.1, 13. Gal. 5.13, 16, 18. and 6.8, 1 Cor. 9.21.
we shall receive forgiveness of sins, and healing of, and victory over them,
and have assistance and increase of life, and so no condemnation. Is not this
the language of the Spirit in the Apostle to the Romans, and to the Galatians
and other Churches? yea, does not the Apostle profess himself not to be without
Law to God, but under the Law to Christ? and does not the opposition of these
two Laws that of Moses, and this of Christ, in Romans 8.2, 3, 4. suit and agree
in one with the terms of those two Covenants mentioned, Heb. 8.2, 6, 7, 8. and
so mentioned as the two Testaments, that of the Letter, and that of the Spirit,
the Old and the New, in 2 Cor. 3.5, 14. and it being a Law of Faith, Love,
Liberty, requiring nothing but what it gives and inclines to, and giving
pardon for all weaknesses, accepting the will for the deed: Surely, those that
believe his great Love and Faithfulness, will confess his Truth, Mat. 11.30. 1 John 5.3.
and say, That his yoke is easy, and his burden light, and his commandments
are not grievous.

And more I need not say to show there are Engagements on both parts in the New
Testament, or what the New Testament is, even that Obligation or Covenant made
with Believers, in and upon the Dispensation of the first Fruits of the
everlasting Covenant to them, and grounded on the death and sacrifice of
Christ, and the love of God commended therethrough; which known and believed,
effects Faith in him, and love to brethren: and both obliges and moves, and
affords Grace to live by Faith, and walk in Love, and so to wait for all his
Promises, and not be offended. And surely, such as know and taste this Grace,
will not count harsh, nor take offense at, or evade, as not spoken to them; but
count good, needful, and profitable for them, whose standing is by Faith that
works through Love, even all those caveats given against departing, and all
those Exhortations to abiding given in the Gospel: nor can they be displeasing
or hurtful to any, or hindering their Faith and Consolation in Christ, that do
believe Christ to have died for the ungodly, and by his Grace commended to them
therethrough, to have called them, and enabling them to believe, and so given
them the Spirit of Faith, Love, Power, and a sound mind, when he made this
Covenant with them. In which also is assured, assistance from him, forgiveness
of their failings, and on confession of their sins, and turning to him,
forgiveness and healing of their backslidings: he also by virtue of his own
Blood, remaining the Mediator of this Testament for them, and the Dispensor
also to them; affording them in all this, To ask what they will in his Name,
Psalm. 138.8. Phil. 1.5, 6. 2 Timothy 4.18.
and he will do it; yea, if it be, even to perfect all that concerns them,
never forsaking the work of his own Hands, but perfecting his begun-good work,
and delivering them from every evil way, and so bring them to his Kingdom. Who,
but those that desire Liberty for the Flesh, can desire a better Liberty and
Consolation then this, or a greater? for sure other Liberty to frail Men,
cannot be good; and of the Covenants made, I know no more then these already
declared, and Christ given for a Covenant: and this New Covenant thus given by
him to Believers, the choice of all, as made; but yet as to be made, there is
still more or greater.

CHAP. 4.
Of the Everlasting Covenant as remaining to be made.

IT is evident, That the Covenant remaining to be made is no other but a new
manner of making of the same everlasting Covenant that was made with and
confirmed in Christ at the beginning, for him and his spiritual Seed; and after
declared, as confirmed in Christ to Abraham, and so immediately made with him,
and Isaac, and Jacob, for them and their Seed, which should be of the same Seed
still: and afterward in respect of the King and Kingdom, so also made with
David, for him and his Seed, which should be of the same Seed still; and so
because this Covenant was first opened to, and made with Abraham, it is called
God's Covenant made with Abraham; and because it was after in like manner made
with Isaac and Jacob, Abraham's Sons, and so every of all those three being the
Fathers of all Israel; therefore it is called, The Covenant of their Fathers;
and because in respect of the Kingdom, it was after also so made with David, it
is sometimes called, The Covenant made with David: and this Covenant still
called, The everlasting Covenant, and The Covenant of the Fathers; which was
made to these Fathers for them, and for their Seed, to wait for the performance
thereof by Faith, the first Testamental Covenant given in the beginning of a
literal performance, was for nurture of the Seed till Christ came, and then to
be shaken and pass away; and the Second or New Testamental Covenant given in
the Dispensation of the spiritual first Fruits of the everlasting Covenant, to
nurture Sons for walking in Faith and Love, till they come to the Inheritance,
when the fullness of the Everlasting Covenant will be performed to Soul and Body
both; when, though the first Fruits abide in the Harvest, Romans 8.24. 1 Cor.
13.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Heb. 12.26, 27.
yet the Obligation in respect of living and waiting by Faith, and use of
suitable outward Ordinances, will be shaken, and pass away also in the coming
in of that fullness: so that the Everlasting Covenant in the fullness and
compleatness of it, is that which is waited for, and remains to be made; not
to be waited for by Faith in carnal observances, as till Christ came; nor with
the first Fruits of the Spirit, to wait for the fullness by Faith in use of
spiritual Ordinances, as since the giving of Christ for a Covenant to his
coming again; but to be made in and by a complete performance of it, as all
that is said in the Promise of making it, does evidence. And of this making the
Everlasting Covenant foremade with Abraham, (for him and his Seed then) with
him and all his Seed in performance, I am now to treat; and though in the
Revelation of it, and Promises of it, it be foreshewn, yet as it is insured in
the Promise as a Covenant to be made, I will note a few things about it that
are clearly set forth in the Scripture; as, 1. The Time when it is to be made:
2. The Persons with whom it is to be made: and 3. What is to be done in this
manner of making it; all included, and not darkly, but clearly intimated and
expressed, in that known place, Jer. 31.33,
Jer. 31.33, 34. But this the Covenant that I will make with the House of
Israel after those days, says the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward
parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be
my people. And they shall teach no more every Man his Neighbor, and every Man
his Brother, 34,
saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know me from the least of them, to
the greatest of them, says the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I
will remember their sin no more. Mind these words, and see, That this Covenant
was not then made, when Jeremiah wrote it: he says neither, I have made, nor I
do make; but, I will make: nor does he say, I will presently make: for the old
faulted Covenant yet was, and for a long time to be in force; but, After those
days I will make:

I. The Time when this Covenant is to be made, is clearly express to be after
those days; he says not these days, as speaking of the days of his
prophesying only, or those near following after; but the days of which he
prophesied that must first come, and the things therein to be done, first done;
and then after those days, and those things done in them, he will make this
Covenant: it is nowhere said, in respect of the fullness, That he will make it
before, as for a dispensation of a spiritual first Fruits, and a New Testament
made to nurture Sons, to wait for the fullness in the making this Covenant to
come in its time; this was to be, and has been done by Christ at and since his
first coming, and is here intimated, verse 31, etc. as is foreshewn. But for
the fullness, before that be done, and the Covenant so made, the whole House of
Israel that are then surviving, even Israel and Judah; the natural seed of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, must be first brought into their Land and converted;
and then Jesus Christ the Son of Abraham and David, must visibly descend from
Heaven, and all the Saints be raised, and changed, and come with Jesus Christ,
and break the power of all Oppressors. And then when these things are done,
after those days, he will thus make this Covenant, as is said. And this is
that said here by this Prophet, as elsewhere by the rest of the Prophets. This
Prophet speaking of all the Families of Israel, to whom God will do this,
says, Behold, I will bring them from the North-Country, Jer. 31.1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
7,
and gather them from the coasts of the Earth: with them the blind, and the
lame, the woman with child, and her that travelleth with-childe together; a
great company shall return thither. -- They shall come with weeping, 9,
and with supplication will I lead them; I will cause them to walk in Rivers of
waters, in a straight way where in they shall not stumble: For I am a Father to
Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn. -- He that scattered Israel, 10,
will gather him: (and so on to verse 16.) in which he promises, That the
Children of Rachel shall come again from the Land of the Enemy to their own
Borders: including the Children slain by Herod, in and about Bethlehem, Mat.
2.17, 18. which shall be then also raised, (and so on to the 27 v.) Behold, 16,
27,
the days come, says the Lord, that I will sow the house of Israel and the
house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast: 31, 33.
(and so on to verse the 31. saying,) Behold, the days come, says the Lord,
that I will make a new Govenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of
Judah. And what and when it shall be, he shows in verses 33, 34. and pointing
to the time, he says, After those days, that is, those days, as then to
come, and in the greatest measure and full sense, yet also, which he prophesied
of from the 8 verse to the 30. And this he again after affirms and explains:
Behold, Jer. 32.37, 38, 39, 40, 41. and 3.14, 18. and 24.6, 7. and 30.16, 22.
Ezekiel. 11.17, 18, 19, 20.
I will gather them out of all Countries whither I have driven them in mine
anger, and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to
dwell safely, and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, etc. and I
will make an everlasting Covenant with them, etc. And so elsewhere: and so
other Prophets, Thus says the Lord, I will gather you from the people, and
assemble you out of the Countries where you have been scattered. And I will
give you the Land of Israel, and they shall come thither: and they shall take
away all the detestable things, and all the abominations thereof from thence;
and I will give them one heart, and I will put a new Spirit within you, etc.
(And again,) For I will take you from among the Heathen, Ezekiel. 36.24, 25, 26,
27, 28, 38. and 34.22, 23. and 37.22, 23, 24. Zach. 14.5.
and gather you out of all Countries, and bring you into your own Land. Then
will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean, etc. A new heart
will I give you, etc. So the Time is clear, and that Christ the Son of David,
and all the Saints raised, must first come with him: and then in that time this
Covenant be made, it is clear in many places, as is shown, Part 2. chap. 17.
and chap. 18. part 3. chap. 5. part 5. chap. 5.

Now if any demand, Why I call not these things the making of the Covenant in
performance, seeing there is a performance of so gracious and great things in
them all;

I answer, Because, 1. The Text does not so call them, but speaks of these
things to be performed first, and of the Covenant to be after-made: which is a
good answer.

2. This Covenant is to be made with the spiritual Seed; which all these were
not till then so made. If any say, They were both before the spiritual Seed by
Election: for as touching Election, they were beloved for the Fathers sake:
That has been already answered: the Election mentioned Romans 11.28. is not of
the persons cast off, but of the Fathers whose natural Seed they were, for of
these scattered it is said, I will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
Israel, Isa. 14.1, 2, 3. Zach. 1.17. Ezekiel. 20.5. Ier. 2.2 1 Deuteronomy. 7.6, 8 Romans
11, 26, 27, 28.
and set them in their own Land; and strangers shall be joined with them, and
they shall cleave to the House of Jacob, etc. And again, The Lord shall yet
choose Jerusalem. So as the Lord of old chose Israel, by bringing them out of
Egypt, and giving them his Statutes, etc. and so planted them a noble Vine,
wholly a right Seed: and this for the love of the Fathers: So the Lord will
again choose Israel, and make them wholly a right Seed, by the personal coming
of Christ again, who shall come out of Sion, and turn away ungodliness from
Jacob, and then make the Covenant with them: and this for the Fathers sakes.
Which gives farther answer:

3. The persormance of those mentioned things, Levit. 26.44, 45. Deuteronomy. 4.30,
31. Psalm. 105.8.
are from the remembrance of the Covenant made with their Fathers; and so a
performance to these, for their Fathers sakes. To all which Answers, I add this,

4. Act. 3.19, 20, 21. Romans 8.23, 24, 25. 1 Cor. 13.12. 1 John 3.2.
That Faith and Hope is to be exercised by them till all these things be done,
and that the Lord Jesus do visibly appear and come to them, and restore all
things, and then this Covenant made; which once so made in performance, they
live no longer by Faith and Hope, but by Sight and Enjoyment. And thus it is
every way clear, for the Time when this Covenant is to be so made, it is, After
those days.

II. The Persons with whom this Covenant is to be made, Jer. 31.31, 33. Ezekiel.
37.19, 20.
is also as clear and express to be all the spiritual Seed, that by
Ministration have been so made from the beginning of Gospel-preaching, till
Christ appear personally in Glory, and give the new Heaven, Iso. 13.1, 2, 3.
and 19.24. and 60.1, 11. Psalm. 105.8, 11. Hag. 2.23. Dan. 12.2, 13. Heb. 11.14,
16, 29, 40. Gal. 3.8, 29. 1 These. 4.14, 15, 16. Rev. 11.18.
and new Earth with them all, and with them all together at once; not with one,
or two, or some few; or now with one, or some, and after with other; but with
all the whole spiritual Seed together: for the whole House of Israel, and the
House of Judah, it is express. And so likewise for the People of other Nations
that shall be joined with them; yea, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob must then
receive the performance of this Covenant so made; yea, Zerubbabel and Daniel
must be there, to receive their part with many that shall rise out of the dust
of the Earth; yea, all the whole spiritual Seed of Abraham, even we that are of
the Gentiles; yea, as the Covenant was first made with Christ, and through him
a Covenant for Mankind; so all his Seed by Ministration thereof: and so Adam,
Abel, Seth, Enoch, etc. In a word, None shall prevent another, but all that are
in the dust, and sleep in Jesus, shall arise, and living Saints be changed, and
all together meet the Lord, and be, and come with him; for then is the time in
which he will give rewards to his Servants the Prophets, and to the Saints, and
to them that fear his Name, both small and great. And so this Covenant will be
at once made in performance, to all the Seed together: and indeed this Covenant
was never fore made to be received by Faith to any one person, for himself
alone, but to the Fathers, for them and their Seed; and to them and their
spiritual Seed it shall be at once made in performance to them all together.
These the persons.

But to this, it may be some be replied, That then after this Covenant so made,
there must be no more conversion, no increase of the Seed, for then the
Covenant must be made again, or else it will not be made with all the Seed; and
if so, then not with all at once.

To this I answer, That some whose labors I reverence and esteem, and them for
their works sake, do so conceive, That as that Kingdom shall be sinless and
sorrowless, so it shall be conversionless: there shall be no more converted
after that Kingdom is set up: but the Reason given thereof, is not this I am to
answer, but another, namely, That all that have part in the first Resurrection,
even all the Saints that live and reign with Christ, shall reign with him a
thousand years, the whole time of his reign, as Man, till he deliver up the
Kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all. Whence this Supposition, If
any should after the beginning, and some time of the Kingdom run out, be
converted, they could not reign the full thousand years: One Answer will serve
both these Reasons, which is this, That it is nowhere said, That all the
Inhabitants of this new Earth, or all the Members of this Commonwealth shall
sit upon Thrones, and reign: nor is it said, That all the natural Seed of
Abraham, that are then living in unbelief, and the unbelieving Gentiles with
them, that shall be converted at and by the personal and visible appearing of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and all his Saints with him, and so made of the Seed,
that they shall all be Kings, and reign with him: (they come in after the time
of those to whom that Promise is.) And surely, for such as never suffered,
never waited for him, but are so suddenly, and with so mighty a Hand brought
in; it may be counted happiness enough, to live in such a Commonwealth, and be
free Denizens therein, and enjoy the pleasures of such a Kingdom, till they be
swallowed up with the unconceivable joy of the Father and Son, when God shall
be all in all, which alone will satisfy all that are received into it: and the
Promise of reigning, is to such as here in this suffering time, live and die in
the Faith, or are found so believing on him at his appearing, that they may be
changed while the other are raised, and so come together with the Lord, which
the after-conterted do not. And so those that are the Children of the
Resurrection that are raised or changed in one and the same moment at his
coming, be all that I, and I suppose that any other can find the Promise of
reigning appertain unto. And if I should say, These are the whole of Abraham's
spititual Seed, I should not err, whether Men receive it, or no: for all the
spiritual Seed from Abraham's time so called; and if I shall add the Seed of
Christ, the Seed of the Woman, from Adam to Abraham, though a spiritual Seed,
yet not immediately so, but mediately through a spiritual operation, Romans 4.11,
12, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24. Gal. 3.6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 26, 29.
in the Ministration of some means extended, as is clear all the Scripture
through; and they that are of the Faith, and live by Faith, and walk in the
steps of the Faith of our Father Abraham, and so are the Sons of God by Faith:
these are the Seed, the Children of Abraham, and his Seed; for which cause,
Abraham had the Gospel to preach, and Circumcision to administer, as a Seal of
the Righteousness of the Faith he had to preach, That he might be a Father. And
the Apostles had the Gospel to preach, and Baptism to administer, as a Seal of
the Righteousness of the Faith preached, that they might disciple into
Abraham's Family: Mat. 29.19, 20. Romans 4.11, 12.
and so Abraham still be a Father of such as believe. But now when this time
comes, That Christ with all his spiritual Seed do personally appear, and the
Everlasting Covenant made in performance with them all, then all such
Ministration cease; yea, such Ministration as Moses had in earthly Rites and
Shadows, were shaken and made unprofitable by the Death, Sacrifice, and
Ascension of Christ, pouring forth the Holy Ghost, though in force till then:
but the Truth of the Gospel preached to, and Covenant made with Abraham abode
still, and was more fully preached by the Apostles: but that manner of
preaching, with Baptism and Ordinances delivered by them, though heavenly in
respect of the former, and will be in force till the visible appearing of Jesus
Christ, but then be shaken, when still the Truth of the Gospel and Everlasting
Covenant will abide for ever, to be enjoyed by sight. Now then, when all the
means appointed for Abraham to be the Father of such a Seed, cease, and no
more brought in by believing, but by sight, nor living by Faith, but by sight;
such are not in respect of any conversion, in Scripturephrase called, Abraham's
Seed; but I conceive they more properly may be called, The Seed, or the
Children of Christ, and of his glorified Saints, brought in and living by
fight: not needs any Covenant to be farther or again made with such as are
brought in by and live in the light of this, being brought in to enjoy their
part in it in their first conversion. And if any conceive they may be called,
The Seed's Seed, or his Seed's Seed; and so under that Promise to the Seed of
Abraham, Isa. 59.2^. Deuteronomy. 30.5. Isa. 65.15, 16. Jer. 3.16, 17, 18.
I will multiply thee above thy Fathers; I hinder it not; however, this I know,
The People of God, as well as their worship, shall then be called by a new
Name: so that in this is no let or hinderance to that said, That the Covenant
shall be made to all the spiritual Seed brought in or become of the Seed from
the beginning to the ending of the Ministration of the Gospel, Isa. 41.20, 21.
and 69 7, 8.
by it to them all together at once; yea, it will be a great wonder, to great
admiration, to see a Nation born at once, and such an infinite Company of
Saints presented to them: and yet when the Mountain of the Lord's House is thus
exalted, and the Lord appears in his Glory, and the Children of the
Resurrection ruling and flying about; when the Spirit and the Bride in the
presence of the Bridegroom, Rev. 22.17. Isa. 2.2, 3, 5. Micah 4.1, 2, 3 Isa.
66.12. Psalm. 110.3.
when Light and Law so proceed out of Sion, the Inhabitants of the Nations
hearing, will say one to another, Come: and so go together to the House of the
Lord, without any other Ministration. So that then is promised to be the
greatest Conversion, and more numerous then ever before; though all of them
brought in by, and living in the performance of the Covenant at once so made
with the whole Seed, and not made over again, but continuing; and it is enough
for all so converted, to be under this blessed Government after their
Conversion, enjoying the happiness of it, Rev. 20.9, 15. Mat. 25.46.
and so escape that great destruction and second death, and have eternal Life,
when the Serpent and all his Seed are cast into the lake of fire, which is the
second death. And so we see who the persons are.

III. What that is that is to be done in the manner of making this Covenant, is
fully and sweetly expressed in this Jer. 31.33, 34. affirmed also in other
places of Scripture: let them be considered.

CHAP. 9.
Of the things to be done in making this Covenant: see the Text.

I. I Will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts. Jer.
31.33. Ezekiel 36.25, 26, 27.
This expressed in other words; when having cleansed them from all their filth, he
says, A new heart will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and
I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an
heart of flesh; and I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in
my Statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. Deuteronomy. 30.5, 6.
Of which Moses spoke, saying, And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the
Land which thy Fathers possessed, and thou shall possess it, and he will do
thee good, and multiply thee above thy Fathers; and the Lord thy God well
circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy Seed, to love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and all thy Soul, that thou may live. And so by Jeremiah
again, I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever,
Jer. 32.39, 40.
(all days.) - And I will make an ever lasting Covenant with them, that I will
not turn away from them (from after them) to do them good; but I will put my
fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. So that in all the
places we may see, That then all sin and sinning shall be removed, and a
perfect Righteousness framed in them, and strength to walk constantly therein:
and by this we may note the difference between this and the first Fruits of it
given in to Believers by the first coming of Christ given for a Covenant, as
namely, That this now-given, is but a first Fruits, and earnest of that
promised, which is the Harvest to be waited for: also, That this given was, Rom
8.23. Ephesians. 1.14. Romans 11.11, 26. 2 Cor. 3.3. Rev. 21.1, 8. Zach. 12.10.
and yet is, chiefly received by the Gentiles; but that promised, chiefly by
the whole House of Israel, the natural Seed of Abraham, become the spiritual
Seed: this given, is mediately in the Ministration of his Servants; that
promised, is immediately by his own presence: this given, many Israelites shall
have their return into their own Land; that promised, at the visible appearance
of Chrift: Romans 11.
this given, is to all Believers, though Israel be in dispersion; that
promised, not till Israel dwell in their own Land: many of those that receive
this given, may yet through weakness be puffed up for one against another; but in
receiving that promised, is no more pride nor envy of one against another. 1
Cor. 4.7. Isa. 11.13. Phil. 3.2, 13. Zach. 12.8 Mat. 2.4. Act. 20.30. Rev. 2,
and 3. Isa. 60.21. Jo^l 3.17 Zach. 14.21. Romans 8.17. Isa. 60.18, 19, 21.
The best of those that receive this given, do not here attain to perfection;
the least of those that receive that promised, are perfect. In the Assemblies
of those that receive this given, were and still are found, some among them
unsound, and some decaying, and some falling off: but those that receive that
promised, the people in that whole Assembly be all righteous, and no more
decaying or falling off. Those that receive this given, are here still under
the Cross, and Combatants; but those that receive that promised, are freed from
all Sufferings and Temptation, and are Conquerors, enjoying the Inheritance.
This given is received, now by one, and then by another, and by all by degrees;
but that promised, is received at once by all together, Israel and Judah, and
all Believers of all Nations together. So, though this given be a first Fruits
of the same Spirit and Covenant, yet there is as much difference between this
given, and that promised, as between a handful or first Fruits of the Corn, and
the whole fullness of the Harvest, which is in this making of the Covenant now
treated of: in which it appears, they shall all be made sinless, and righteous,
perfect in the love of God and one another, complete in all true holiness.

II. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Jer. 31.33. and
30.22. and 32.38. Ezekiel. 11.20. Exodus 3, and 4, and 6, and 20. Psalm. 120.
And this appears in that which went before in verse 32. and several places, to
be spoken emphatically, to be understood in a higher sense, and after a more
eminent manner, then ever before: for he was their God, and they his people,
when they were afflicted in Egypt; and in more manifestation, when they were in
the Wilderness; and still more appearingly, when they were settled in Canaan,
and his Worship settled among them: and of these remaining, while Jeremiah
prophesied among them: and still more manifestly in special manner, Romans 9.24,
25, 26.
he is our God, who believe in Christ, and receive of the first Fruits of the
Spirit, and we his people: but here is clearly more implied to be done after
those days, and here and elsewhere expressed, as namely, That he will multiply
his wonders among them, and his favors on them, so as he will make himself
known to all Nations to be their God, Ezekiel. 36.36. and 37.28. Isa. 60.14. Ezekiel.
37.26, 27.
and make them known to all Nations to be his peculiar People, when the Heathen
shall know, That he is the Lord; and, That he does sanctify and build Israel,
and shall acknowledge them, The City of the Lord, The Sion of the holy one of
Israel; yea, he will set his Sanctuary in the midst of them for evermere;
yea, he says, My Tabernacle also shall be with them; yea, I will be their God,
and they shall be my people. And so he has opened his own meaning. And what
this Sanctuary and Tabernacle is, and from whence it comes, and where it shall
be, he has told us, viz. Jesus Christ The Son of God, The Son of Man, The Man
in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, he that is in the Father, and
the Father in him, he is the Temple and Sanctuary, (and no other like the old
Temple, or new formed Church-Governments under the Gospel in this City) for the
Lord God Almighty, Rev. 21.22. Ezekiel. 37.22, 24, 25. and 34.23, 24, 30.
and the Lamb, are the Temple of it, and he the Son of David shall sit on the
Throne, and be the mighty King and Governor among them: and Christ also coming
with his Saints, those that in Spirit are now in Heaven, the Jerusalem that is
now above; these shall come with their Lord and Master down from Heaven, and
receiving their Bodies glorified, the great City, the Holy Jerusalem descending
out of Heaven from God, having the Glory of God upon her; Of which it is said,
I saw the holy City, Rev. 21.2, 3.
new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned
for her Husband. And I heard a great voice out of Heaven, saying, The
Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them; and they shall be
his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God. Thus we have it
clearly opened: so that these Saints, this spiritual Seed, Dan. 7.14, 27. Ezekiel.
48.35. See Part 2. chap. 18.
shall be Princes among the people, and sit upon Thrones with Christ, and reign
with him: And all the Kingdoms under the whole heavens shall be given to the
people of the Saints of the most High, and all nations shall serve him: and the
name of the City shall be from that day, The Lord is there. Thus will God be
with them their God, and they shall be his people. Thus owned by him.

III. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his
brother, saying, Know the Lord, for they shall all know me from the least of
them to the greatest of them, Jer. 31.34.
says the Lord. To know the Lord, is both to understand and know, That he is
Jehovah, and that he is infinite in Wisdom, Power, Goodness, etc. and to know,
that is, acknowledge, Jer. 9 24. Joh. 17.3.
love and adore him as the Lord, as he does discover himself such a one in and
by his Son Christ: and thus to know the Lord, every Man (except Jesus the Son
of God) that has lived or does live upon this Earth in their several Ages,
have needed, and do need, to be taught this knowledge: and it is the part of
every Man, Exodus 18.16. Deuteronomy. 4.34, 39. and 6.11. and 7.9. Joh 5 27. and 11.16.
1 Chronicles. 28.9
according to his understanding and Faith, to teach, and receive teaching from
his Brother, saying, Know the Lord. But because in respect of some, this is
confessed of all, I forbear further proof; only because some conceit established
Believers past this need since Christ came, I shall consider the place alleged
for it, which is 1 John 2.20, 27. Ye have an unction from the holy One, and ye
know all things. -The anointing which ye have received of him, abides in you,
and you need not that any man teach you: but as that anointing teaches you of
all things, and is truth, and is no^ly, and even as it has taught you, you
shall abide in him. This place being a sweet, needful and instructing Truth,
crosses nothing here foresaid; for the Apostle speaks here of a first fruits
of that promised; spiritually dispensed; Jer. 31.34. Heb. 8.6, 10.1 Joh. 5.20.
Romans 8.22, 23, 24, 25. Heb. 11. 13, 40. Heb. 11.1.
and not of the Harvest, as a pears in his former and after-Discourse: for as
he that receives Christ, receives all things with him; but still according to
his receiving, either by spiritual discerning and believing, or by open sight
and enjoyment; so he that knows Christ, knows all things: but still
according to the manner of his knowing, either through a Glass dimly by Faith,
or else in open view, seeing as he is seen; Paul confesses the first to be now
in this life, but the later, 1 Cor. 13.12, 1 John 3.1, 2.
at the time we are speaking of; and so this Apostle confesses the former to
be now, but the later not to be enjoyed till the time of the visible appearance
of Christ. And so he says not, Ye need not that any Man teach you, (saying,
Know the Lord) for that anointing teaches you of all things: but that he says
is, Ye need not that any man teach you, 1 John 2.27.
but as that anointing teaches you of all things, etc. that is, as the Spirit
in the Testimony of Christ in that Doctrine of Christ, in which he has helped
you to believe in Christ, and by that Doctrine teaches you of all things; do
ye so abide in that, and receive the Testimony and teachings of that, by all
that teach you, as that anointing teaches you: But, says he, If there come
any unto you, 2 John 10. 1 John 2.18, 26. Gal. 1.7, 8, 9.
and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, nor bid him
God-speed. And this Counsel on the same ground given in this place to warn
against Seducers. And so Paul to the same purpose says, Though we, or an Angel
from heaven, preach unto you other, or besides that we have preached unto you,
etc. Again, If any man preach any other Gospel unto you, then that ye have
received, let him be accursed. And John's saying to be thus understood, is
clear, by comparing two sayings of Paul, speaking by the same Spirit 1 Cor.
15.1, 4. 2 Cor. 11.2, 3, 4.
: yea, in John's own exhortation 1 John 2.28.
, and professed end of his writing, which was still to teach them as this
anointing teaches, from Chap. 2. to Chap. 5.13. And so Peter, and the residue
of the Apostles, 2 Pet. 1.12, 13. 2 Cor. 3.3. 1 These. 5.11, 14. Heb. 3.13. 1
These. 4.18. 1 Pet. 4.11. Romans 12.3.
were in this manner diligent to teach Believers that knew the Truth, and were
established in the Truth; yea, Christ his anointing is affirmed to be in such
Ministration, and all Believers exhorted daily to teach and exhort one another:
yet still according to this anointing, with the words of the Gospel, in which
the Spirit testifies of Christ, and according to the proportion of Faith as
God has dealt to every Man. So that this place is of excellent use in all
teachings, and receiving of teaching: But when that time comes, and that is
done of which Jeremiah speaks here, 1 Cor. 13.12. 1 John 3.2.1 Cor. 4.5.
Then they shall see Face to Face, and know as they are known; yea, see Jesus
as he is; then will be open the hidden things of darkness; and then not some of
the choice only, but all the Seed, even from the least of them to the greatest
of them, shall know the Lord: so that Tongues, Prophesying, and Knowledge by
such Mediums as now, shall be useless, 1 Cor. 13.8 Col. 3.4. 1 John 3.2.
and such teachings cease then: but we shall all know the Lord, by an immediate
sight of the Lord, which will make us to be like him. Such so full and so clear
Knowledge to be given, then.

IV. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
This is clear to be such a forgiveness, Jer. 31.34.
as in which all sin is wholly taken away, and they presented altogether
spotless before him: such a degree of Forgiveness, Justification, and
Sanctification, and Freedom, as no Man attaineth in this Life: In which, daily
Forgiveness is needed. 1 John 1.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Ephesians. 5.25, 26, 27. Col. 1.22,
23. Act. 3.19. 1 Cor. 1.8.
But this is that spotlesness, which Christ by his Blood sprinkling commending
his Father's Love there through, in Gospelministring by his Mediation sending
forth Spirit in his Word to work on the Heart, is now about to fit his Seed
for, and bring them to; and it shall be completed at that very Day of his
coming, when also that which follows will be performed with it; namely, That he
will remember their sin no more. Whatever Forgiveness God extends to Men;
yea, though into their Consciences, yet while any sorrow, shame, pain, weakness
or oppression lies on them, there is some remembrance of sin, for how good and
gracious ends soever: and while any good promised for Soul or Body is withheld,
there is some remembrance of sin, how advantageous soever it be made; yea, as
long as the Bodies of the Saints are in the dust, there is some remembrance of
sin. But here from this time shall be no remembrance of sin: their sins shall
be remembered no more: which includes and assures them, That God will wipe
away then all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, Rev.
21.4. and 7.15, 16, 17. Jer. 31.12 Isa. 60.17, 18, 19, 20. and 11.6, 9. Isa.
65.17, 18, 19. Romans 8.21, 22. Isa. 9.6, 7. and 11.4, 5. Psalm. 72. Isa. 60, and
65, and 66.
neither sorrow nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain, for the
former things are passed away; and so they shall not have any violence,
injustice or oppression in their Government, nor suffer violence from any, nor
shall there be contention or strife among the Creatures with them any more, nor
any pollution in the Air or Earth, or any thing that grows out of it; but the
whole Creation, the Heaven and Earth made new for them.

Their Government and Commonwealth shall be altogether peaceable, righteous,
and flourishing; the Earth abundantly fruitful; and all Nations bringing their
Glory to them, and they enjoying, and filled with all happiness for evermore,
everlasting joy upon them, as is before shown in the Promises, Part 5. Chap. 5.
and Part 2. Chap. 10, and 13.

And this the everlasting Covenant, which was made in promise to Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob and David, and declared by the Prophets and Apostles, who shall in
that day be also with them, when this shall be made in performance to all the
spiritual Seed, so as they all shall then triumphingly confess, As we have
heard, Psalm. 48.8.
so we have seen in the City of the Lord of Hosts, in the City of our God, God
will establish it for ever; and so filled with Rejoycings, they breath forth
Hallelujahs. Nothing more full and plain in Scripture then these things,
therefore let the Rule and Consent in it be here remembered, and this the Hope
we are called to by the Gospel, and are interested in, Par. 1. chapter 7. 2 These.
2.14. Gal. 3.29.
in believing in Christ; so that Prayer is good for us, That God would grant to
us the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of Christ, that we may
see what the Hope of his Calling is, which is to all engaged in this Covenant;
and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints, a little in
this discovered; and what the exceeding greatness of his power, etc. which will
bring all to pass.

CHAP. 10.
Of some usefulness of this Discovery of the Covenants.

IN what has been shown, we may see, if we search and read the Scriptures
pointed unto, That the Gospel of God and the Testimony of Christ therein, is
according to the Covenants of God, and the Opener thereof; and also, That the
Testimony of Christ, The Purposes of God, The Promises of God, and The
Covenants of God agree in one and the same; The Revelations of Christ, show
forth the Testimony of Christ, which is the Key of Knowledge: The Testimony of
Christ declares The Purpose of God; from his Purpose, The Promises of things
purposed, and as purposed, flow; and to assure the Promises, the Covenants are
suitably made: and so as in the Testimony of Christ, and in the Purposes and
Promises of God, even so in the Covenants made known,

I. We have that set before us, which is already performed in Christ, which is
true, and truly done, as a motive to, and Foundation for Faith; and declared,
that Men might believe, whether men do believe it or not. And also that set
before us, which will certainly be done to men, that they might believe,
whether Men receive it or reject it: and this to give Preachers hope in
declaring the Gospel; and Hearers caution, that they then receive his words and
slip not the day of his visitation. And also that set before us, which
Believers may through Faith, daily look for in this life: and what they are to
wait for till, and through Faith, may be sure to enjoy in the life to come.

Yea, surely, as in the Gospel-Testimony, Purposes and Promises; so in the
Covenants we may see a fullness of Provision for us: a sweet gracious order in
them all, and Freeness of Grace with Mercy, Truth and Holiness in the
performance of them, all mentioned in his Word, and strongly evidenced and
intimated in the Works of God already done, so as they have a sweet and drawing
influence, both to draw such as yet believe not, to believe, and to stablish
Believers for their perseverance: I say, The Covenants of God have: but not
such as expressed or intimated by Mr. Owen, Page 163.4.
saying, The distributive justice of God is engaged upon this obligation of
Christ upon the Covenant and Compact made with Christ as Mediator to that
purpose, to bestow on them for whom he died, all the good things which he
promised him for them, in and upon the account of his undertaking in their
behalf: So he. Sure this Saying has not the savor of the Scripture Language,
in Covenants, Promises, Purposes, or Testimony of his Oblation and Mediation,
which are all plain, and without wreathedness, holding forth their own meaning,
and the certain Truth in that affirmed. Now certain it is, and is before shown,
That what God engaged for to Christ upon the account of his sufferings, Prove.
8.6, 9. and 22.21.
he performed to Christ upon the account of his sufferings; and what upon that
account he engages to Christ to do unto men, both has and shall be upon that
account done to men, all Men, as is foreshewn: and what upon the account of his
extention in Ministration of the virtues of his Sufferings and Sacrifice, was
engaged to him to be done for his sake, has and shall verily be done unto
them: and yet upon both these accounts; in the first, having bought them; in
the second, using means to lead them to Repentance, he shall rule some with a
Rod of Iron, and break them in pieces like a Potter's Vessel for their
Rebellions, and have the glory of his sufferings and Sacrifice for them, and
means used toward them in his just condemnation of them according to the
Gospel. Therefore though God upon the account of the Oblation of Christ, has
given in to him eternal Life, as in a public Man for all Men, for whom indeed
he died, yet not to be on that account dispensed to all for whom he died; but
on those, that by and in the means he uses, believe on him: as has been
foreshewn in the Testimony of the Oblation and Mediation of Christ, and in the
Purposes, Promises and Covenants of God, and in answer of Mr. Owen his more
plain Expressions: so swerving from his own Rule.

II. In this manner of God's making his Covenants, we have a good and sure
Direction to know what Covenants we are under, and what our Interest in the
Covenant is, and how far we are in Covenant with God, and so what we have in
enjoyment, and what in hope to enjoy, if we view the Covenant in which our
Father Adam was at first, and from which he fell; and then view that heavy
Covenant he, and we all in him fell under: and withal, view how the second
public Man, the Lord Christ, became under that heavy Covenant for Mankind,
and has fully satisfied the same: and view how upon the account of satisfying
this heavy Covenant, there is a gracious Covenant between the Father and him,
and that also respecting Mankind to be now in his dispose, and he to have a
Seed out of them, and to have for and give to his Seed eternal Life: And if
believing all this, we view the Covenant God made with Mankind through Christ
at the beginning; we shall see, That we are under a gracious Covenant; and,
That, if according as our eyes are opened, and Light, Motion and Strength in
the means extended to us, given us, we so believe in God, who are according to
the gracious Covenant, under the hope of Eternal Life. And then if we view the
Covenant as made with Abraham, and the first Fathers, and believe the same, we
are under the hope of it: and then, if we view the Covenant that was added
because of Transgression, and given by Moses to continue till Christ came, and
look on Jesus as set forth in the Gospel; we shall see how Christ has
satisfied and made purgation for all the sins, the one part of that Covenant
could charge us with; and fulfilled all that in Truth which the other part of
that Covenant did figure and type out; and freed us from outward Circumcision,
and all the Bondage of the Law of Works; that believing in his Blood, we may
therethrough approach to God, and believe in and receive from him, all saving
Grace, we shall find a better use of that old Covenant for instruction, now
being from under it, then those that were under it in Observances, did or could
find. And see therein the first Covenant made with Mankind through Christ,
cleared; and the Door to Life and Immortality opened, with the hope of the
everlasting Covenant set before us, and Jesus Christ given for a Covenant;
holding forth the New Testament to us: in minding and believing in him with our
heart, he writes his mind in the Heart, enduing us with the Spirit of Faith,
Love, and Power, and a sound Mind; so interesting us in the Promises and
everlasting Covenant, leading us to live by Faith, and walk in Love, in which
he seals us for his, and gives us a first Fruits of the Spirit, as an earnest
of the Inheritance. And so we are under the New Testament, of which Christ is
the Mediator by virtue of his Blood, That we which are called, may receive the
promised Inheritance: and he is loving, faithful, and able; yea, and given us
of God for the everlasting Covenant it self, That we believing on him, and
receiving him, may in and with him receive all things; and he by his power,
keep us through Faith, till he have conferred all things in the Covenant on us.
So that till possession, we can have no better or greater assurance of our
interest in, and enjoyment of all promised in the everlasting Covenant, then
the assurance by Faith in him of his fullness, and our interest in him, and
enjoyment of him, who says, Because he lives, we that believe in him shall
live also: and it is better and safer for us, that it is in his Hands, then if
it were in ours; we may better betrust him then our selves, for keeping it. And
knowing all this revealed in the Revelation of Christ, and so testified in the
Testimony of Christ, and therein the Purposes of God to be declared to be such;
and according thereto, the Promises of God given forth, and all the Promises
assured by his Covenant, and now Christ given us for all, so as believing in
him, he is ours; and he being ours, all that is his is ours, his Father,
Spirit, Promises, Covenant, Inheritance; and we his, as is all plentifully
shown and proved before in this Treatise: Who then can desire a better, firmer,
and stronger assurance of God being ours, and with us, to preserve us to the
Inheritance? I confess I have formerly fancied some more particular and
personal thing, in which I now see I was mistaken. And because I meet with
Expressions importing the same in others, I owning it, as my own former
mistake, will endeavor to remove it from others, in considering one Expression
more of Mr. Owen's; of whose mind in that also, I conceive my self to have
been.

CHAP. 11.
An Answer to an Expression seeming to cross this last said, about assurance:
or else to give a better.

THis I find in Mr. Owen's writing, Page 139.2.
viz. God being with his People, from henceforth even for ever, is from his
giving in that Promise, Psalm. 125.1, etc. into their souls in particular, and
their receiving it in their Generations, according to their appointed times,
even for ever: So far he. But this saying suits not with the Gospel setting
forth Christ to have come in the flesh, and to be given for God's Salvation to
the ends of the Earth, and for a light to the Gentiles, and for a Covenant to
the People; nor is there any place of Senpture in its own plainness and
simplicity either to assert it, or countenance it; no, not that very Text it
self. Let it be considered as agreeing with others.

1. They that trust in Jehovah, as Mount Sion is not moved, Psalm. 125.1, 2.
remains for ever: (or, as some read it,) They that put their trust in the
Lord, are even as the Mount Sion, which may not be removed, but stands fast
for ever: (or, as we read it,) They that trust in the Lord [shall be] as Mount
Sion [which] cannot be removed, [but] abides for ever. 2. The Mountains round
about it, and Jehovah is round about his people, from this time and for ever:
(or, as some read it,) The Hills stand about Jorusalem, even so stands the
Lord round about his people from this time forth for evermore: (or, as we read
it,) As the Mountains [are] round about Jerusalem, so the Lord [is] round about
his people from henceforth even for ever. All comes to one sense in every
reading: but neither the Text it self, nor any Translation of it, does thus
read it, That such as from God's giving in these particular words to their
Souls, and they receiving it, they shall be as Mount Sion, etc. nor any such
manner of saying, here or elsewhere. I will not press that I understand not,
though some of the Learned render it, as the Chaldee Explanation and
Exposition, to be thus, The just which trusts in the word of the Lord; and
so, Jehovah, the divine presence, or Majesty of the Lord is round about them: I
say, I will not press this, though it be far more agreeing with the Text, (then
the former device) being suitable to the same thing spoken by another Prophet,
Isa. 26.3, 4.
Thou will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee, because he
trusts in thee. Trust ye in the Lord for ever; for in the Lord Jehovah is
everlasting strength. But not to press farther, the words countenance not at
all such a saying as I am answering: But,

2. Evident it is here, That the Lord by this Prophet delivers the same
Doctrine for the comfort of his People, Psalm. 125.1, 2. with Hab. 2.3.4.
that he did after in discovering the Vision, to and by the Prophet Habakkuk:
The vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak and not
lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not
tarry. Behold, his soul which is listed up, is not upright in him: but the just
shall live by Faith. And this is cleared to us by the Apostles to be, Romans
3.22, 23, 24, 25. and 4.5. and 5.1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10. Gal. 2.16.
That sinners, ungodly ones, coming in through the Love of God commended in the
Death of Christ for sinners, to believe in his Blood, and therethrough to
believe in God, to be saved through Christ: That God justifies these through
the Blood of Christ, and they receive this justification through Faith; and so
are justified, Romans 1.17. and 4.22, 25. Gal. 2.20. and 3.11. and 5.5, 6.
or just by Faith. And these are the just ones of whom Habakkuk speaks. And
does not the Apostle farther declare, That these just ones do live, abide, and
receive all their strength, increase and safety by Faith in trusting or
believing in the Lord? and these are the Trusters in God and Livers by Faith of
whom both the Prophets speak. And to all such Trusters in the Lord, that said
Psalm. 125.1, 2. is strong Consolation; and he should do an evil work, that
should take them off from this confidence begot in them by the Grace of God in
Christ, commended through his Blood to sinners; by saying, Oh you may be
deceived, and steal this, in trusting on the Lord without warrant, if these
words, Psalm 1.25.1, 2. were not given in, in particular to your Souls, and you
so received them, and then it will prove Gravel to you, etc. But I desire to
wrong none: I suppose he limiteth it not to these very words: But if any
suchlike be so given in, and received, as, Son, be of good cheer, thy sins are
forgiven thee: or, I have blotted out thy transgressions, as a cloud, for my
own Name's sake: or, I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore with
loving kindness have I drawn thee: or any suchlike. But though these be great
and special mercies, to be spiritually streamed into the heart, yet not rightly
taken or used, if it be for such an end, as to take them for Gods, making the
everlasting Covenant with us in particular, as with Abraham; for all these but
one, were spoken to the Church in general, and were not the making, but the
remembering of the Covenant made with Abraham; which, though made in particular,
and personally with him, and so with Isaac and Jacob, and after with David, in
respect of the Kingdom, yet was it not made with them or any one of them for
themselves in particular, but for them and all the spiritual Seed that were to
follow, of which they were to be Fathers: and for that one, which was spoken in
particular, of one particular, it was vocally spoken, and audibly heard by him
to whom spoken, and many others, that were with him, and for their sakes also;
this Man to whom it was spoken, being before this speaking a Son. So that all
these and the like sayings, show what sure confidence Believers may have in
remembering the Covenants made with their Fathers; and the spiritual streaming
in of such Sayings into their hearts, a good relief in their fainting, and help
to enlarge their use of confidence in God, that ever remembers his Covanant
made with the Fathers. And this leads to a farther consideration of this Psalm.
125.1, 2. viz.

3. That these words were not directly spoken to and for such as did not trust
in the Lord, Psalm. 125.1, 2.
to beget them to trust in the Lord, though such an use may be, and come of the
hearing and minding them in convincement: but they were and are directly spoken
to, and for such as are already Trusters in the Lord; being first begot to
trust in the Lord, that they might not fear or depart through fainting, or go
aside in lifting up their Souls, to any other strength, wisdom, righteousness,
policy, or confidence; for so he tells them in the same Psalm, Such as (in any
straight, or for any pretense) turn aside, (namely, Verse. 5.
from this way of trusting in the Lord) unto their crooked ways, the Lord will
lead them forth with the workers of iniquity, [but] peace upon Israel: opened
by the Apostle, directing as the rule to wait through the Spirit for the
Righteousness of God by Faith, etc. says, Gal. 5 5, 6 and 6.15, 16.
As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy upon the
Israel of God. And this the same with that in Habakkuk, He whose Soul is lifted
up, is not upright in him, but the just shall live by Faith. And in this very
sense does the Apostle render that saying to the Hebrews: Heb. 10.38.
to which the whole 125 Psalm fully agrees.

4. This foresaid saying takes away the strength of the Apostles consolation
given to the believing Hebrews, and so to all Believers thereby, Heb. 13 5, 6.
viz. For he has said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake theee; so that we
may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, I will not fear, etc. which Consolation
the Apostle gives to the whole Church of the Hebrews, to withdraw them from
coverousness, and firm them in confidence; and not from a particular in-giving
of these words to their Souls: nor is there any likelihood they were so to all,
every, or many of them; nor is any such Caution put in. But he lays it down,
as it was given, when God was about the first literal fulfilling his Covenant
made with Abraham; and giving Joshua to be their Captain, to encourage them to
go on in his way, he gives this Promise first to all Israel, Deuteronomy. 31.6.
the whole hurch, Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of
them; for the Lord thy God, he it is that does go with thee, he will not fail
thee, nor forsake thee. And this Promise, as a part of the Covenant made with
their Fathers, given to them, Verse. 7, 8.
was together with them, again given to Joshua their Captain. Now as our
Joshua, even Jesus, that is the Captain and Finisher of our Faith; the
Forerunner, in whom all the Promises are Yea and Amen: Heb. 12.2. Gal. 3.26,
29.
so it appertains to all that believe in him, as his spiritual Seed and Heirs,
The Seed of Abraham, The whole Church spoken of, and to, as one, Thee; and
every one having right, as being of the Seed of Abraham, claiming their
interest, We. So the Apostle directs these believing Hebrews; yea, it being
recorded and written, he directs them to take what the Scripture says, as the
Holy Ghost speaking to them; Heb. 3.7 Gal. 3.7, 8, 9, 29. Romans 15.3, 4, 5.
yea, and so he directs all Believers, even of the Gentile, affirming them
written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scripture
might have hope in believing. So that though this place, I will be with thee,
etc. have no otherwise been inspired to them, then as it is written in the
Scripture, they believing in Christ in whom all the Promises are certain, they
are Heirs, and the Promises pertain to them, Romans 8.17. Gal. 4.6, 7. and 3.26,
29.
and they in believing may have the comfort of them; and yet for some
particular difficult extraordinary business, it may sometime be needful and
very profitable for leading to farther trusting in the Lord to go through so
great a business, to have it particularly streamed into the heart of some chief
Officer, as this was to Joshua, after the ministerial giving of it, Josh. 1.5.
from whence I marvel, learned Men should take that saying there, as for every
Saint, rather then from its former ministerial giving to the whole Church, and
after with them to Joshua, Deuteronomy. 31.6, 7, 8: And if we take not this saying
thus, as appertaining to Christ, and in him to all Believers, but only to such
into whose Souls it is particularly given in; What force has the Apostles
Exhortation to these Hebrews, and so to all the Church of Believers? or who
shall be the Thee, and the We, here spoken to, and speaking, if those, and all
those, Gal. 3.7, 8, 9, 16, 29 Heb. 3.6, 14.
and only those mentioned by the Apostle to be they, be not they? and he
expresses it to Believers in Christ; in believing in whom, is Men's entrance
into Sonship and special favor, and interest in promises, as is witnessed in
the Testimony of Christ, and Declaration of the Purposes, Promises, and
Covenants of God: and such particular in-givings, are great mercies, and sweet
enlargements, and most to babes, and at beginnings, till Men have learned to
live by Faith: but to live on sense, and particular visits, to make them our
Foundation, to lift up our selves above our Brethren that have them not, is a
great abuse of them. But I will in this proceed no farther, nor yet in farther
usefulness of all that written, knowing such as read and believe what the
Scripture affirms, will meet with usefulness; but only in considering that
which occasioned me to the writing of this Treatise, namely, Mr. Owen's stating
of the Question pretended to be in dispute or controversy, between him and Mr.
John Goodwin, about Perseverance in, or falling from Faith; or rather, the
Faith that may, and that which cannot be fallen from.

An Explicit Declaration of the Testimony of Christ, etc.

Of the Question as stated.

AS for his mentioning the many sorts of holiness, and holy Ones, and such as
seem so, and are not, about which the contest is not, I let pass, and look
only on that about which the contest pretends on one side to be: and he puts
it into two sorts of Faith, or that Saints are said to believe, and to be holy,
really, and in the Truth of the thing it self: The first sort of Believers that
have Faith and holiness true in its kind, Page 10. Sect. 17. Hab. 41 1 Samuel

6.20. 2 King. 10.16 Hos. 6.4.
he says, Are such as having received sundry common Gists and Graces of the
Spirit, as illumination of the mind, change of affections, and thence
amendment of Life, with sorrow of the world, legal repentance, temporary Faith,
and the like, which are all true and real in their kind, and do thereby become
vessels in the great house of God, being changed as to their use, not in their
nature; continuing wood and stone still, though hewed, and turned to be
serviceable vessels: and on that account are frequently termed Saints and
Believers.

On such as these there is a lower, (and in some) subordinate work of the
Spirit, effectually producing (in and upon the faculties of the Soul) somewhat,
that is true, good, and useful in it self, Joh 6.34. Act. 25.28. Mat. 7.26, 27.
Rev. 3.1. Mar. 4.16.
answering in some likeness and suitableness of operation, to the great work of
regeneration, the which fails not: There is in them light, love, joy, faith,
zeal, obedience, etc. all true in their kind, which makes many of them do
worthily in their generation; howbeit, they attain not to the Faith of God's
Elect, neither does Christ live in them; nor is the life which they lead, by
the Faith of the Son of God. So far he.

Though this description of Faith and Saints, be not in any
Scripture-Expression or Terms, Isa. 28.12, 13.
or according to any Scripture-Description, but rather like unto that reproved
by it; yet here is granted a Faith and Holiness; true in its kind, that has
in it illumination, change of effection, amendment of life, light, love, joy,
faith, zeal, all effected by the Spirit; from which he yields, a Man may
fall. And if that be true, he after says, That a man may abide with constancy
to the death in this Faith through sufferings: surely then, it being none of
the Faith of God's Elect, etc. and they wood still, etc. they must needs
perish. And were it not better to let such a Faith alone, when so great danger
in falling away, and yet no Salvation, but eternal perishing, though they
continue, even through sufferings, and die in it? But I will not meddle with
the controversy, but only the stating the Question. And so this Faith
acknowledged true in its kind, and of the Spirit's operation, I shall consider
three things in it: 1. That mentioned here, which may be mis-conceived by some,
and those things which are no part of Faith or Holiness true in its kind, of
the Spirits operation. 2. I shall acknowledge that which is so, to be so
indeed. 3. I shall consider Heb. 6.1, 8. whence all his proofs seem to be
fetched.

CHAP. 2.
Of things that may be misconceived, and things no part of Faith.

1. I Suppose himself by common Gifts and Graces of the Spirit, Exodus 31. and
35. Isa. 28.26, 29. Isa. 3.2, 3.
means something higher, and more special then that Light, Understanding, and
Skill in Arts for working curious Works given to our Types, or those given to
Men to fit them for Husbandry, or those Gifts given for strengthening a Nation
to some Men, as Wisdom, Prudence, etc. for the Mighty, Joh. 1.9. Joh 35.10, 11.
Ioh. 1.4, 5, 9. Romans 2.4.
and Captains of War, Judges, Prophets, Counselors, cunning Artificers, and
cloquent Orators; or only, that common Light wherewith he enlightens every Man
that comes into the World, and gives them more understanding then the Beasts
or Fowls. All which are indeed gracious Gifts, given to Men through Christ, and
for his sake; and to gracious ends also, having their tendency to lead Men to
Repentance; yet for these things, as the Gospel is now come forth, Men are not
frequently called Believers and Saints, and the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit,
given in his Testimony of Christ in the Ministration of the Gospel to make him
known, and call to, and unite to him in believing, are of a higher Nature, even
the lowest of them: This being his Work, Ioh. 15.26, 27. and 16.7, 15. Act.
5.32. and 14.3.
and that of which we speak, or we speak nothing at all in this business. As
for that quoted 1 Samuel 10, 11. it does not prove, That Saul had the Gift of
Prophecy, any more then one that has no Gift of singing, yet coming where
some are sweetly singing, is taken with the melody, and carried on with them to
sing, or by some extraordinary occasion or motion, led to sing a Verse or two
tuneably, and yet has neither skill nor ability to do it again at any other
times, can be said to have the Gift (though on such an occasion, the act) of
singing; so, that Saul did sometimes on an extraordinary occasion, and by an
extraordinary Motion, Prophecy, yea, and some of his Servants also, is true,
and so by some operations of the Spirit, they had an act of Prophesying, I
believe, because it is so written; and also, 1 Samuel 10.10, 11. and 19.20, 21,
23.
that they were among the Prophets: but that he or they were Prophets, and had
received the Gift of Prophecy, so as to have it, I believe not, because it is
not so written: and however, this place is not to our business; only this I
have noted, to avoid mistakes about the Gifts and Graces here meant.

II. For sorrow of the World, that is not according to God, it has no-tendency
to any gracious quickening, or that Light, Love, Joy, etc. but aptly works
Death, 2 Cor. 7.9, 10.
Grief for worldly shame, poverty, straights, or loss of Honor, etc. leads to
murmuring, and evil fruits, and so to trouble and estrangement from God, and so
to death, and so is evil, one of the lusts of the flesh, which though in
Believers, often anoying them, yet resisted by the Spirit of Grace, Let no man
say when he is tempted to evil, Gal. 5.17. Jam. 1.13, 16, 17. Isa. 5.20, 21.
(moved to sorrow of the World,) I am tempted of God, (This is one of the lower
Works of his Spirit, one of the common Graces I have received from him) do not
so err, do not so dishonor God and his Spirit, as if he were the Father of
darkness, and such evil Gifts came in the flowing of the Spirit from him
through Christ, not call darkness light, and light darkness: a sorrow will be
in the working of the Spirit, but that will be a sorrow according to God,
suitable to the Grace made known, effecting it. But this worldly sorrow, or
sorrow of the World, is no part of it, has no union with it, and so no part of
the Faith or Holiness treated of.

III. Legal Repentance (if by legal be meant, that which is right, true, sound,
and according to rule, we would not strive about words, it might stand: but by
many expressions used, and the scope of the business, it is evident that cannot
be the meaning here, and therefore)

1. If by legal Repentance be meant a Repentance effected by the Law under
which Man was fallen, discovering sin, and sentencing to death for sin,
affording no hope, Gal. 3.13. Romans 9.31, 32, 33. and 10.2, 3.
but in answering the righteousness it requires, and so afflicting with
despair and terrors of wrath and death, at best effecting such a grief, as
causes thoughts or returning to regain such a righteousness, etc. this stands
cross to Faith and submission to Christ, and so is none of the works of the
Spirit in the Testimony of Christ; See Part 2. chapter 7.
but the Fruit of unbelief, if not also of an evil Ministration, being the
exercise of a natural conscience, through ignorance of the Oblation of Christ,
and Peace made thereby; and also ignorance of God's proceedings with Men
through a Mediator, and upon what account he charge sin upon Men, and will
proceed to punish them: so that this is rather a fruit of the deceitfulness of
sin, the work of the Spirit being otherwise.

2. If by legal Repentance be meant such efficacies as were in Men under the
Law as given by Moses, effected in that Ministration, keeping still under a
Spirit of Bondage, suitable to the time before Christ came in the Flesh, and
offered the Oblation, and sat on the right hand of God to mediate, Romans 8.15.
Gal. 4.1, 7. and 5.1. ^ Tim. 1.7. 1 John 4.3. 2 John 7. Act. 20.21. Heb. 6.1.
and so sent forth the Holy Ghost: This would be denial of Christ come in the
flesh, to attribute such efficacies to the Holy Spirit in the Gospel now; yet a
Repentance is wrought in the working of the Holy Spirit, but it is such as the
Gospel teaches, even Repentance toward God, and from dead works, and not this
legal Repentance: nor are any under the Gospel-Ministration, on the account of
such legal Repentance, anywhere called Believers or Saints. As for that
alleged, 1 King. 21.27. it was an Humiliation, occasioned by the report of the
terrible Judgments to be executed, which God in great Mercy for a time
deferred, as he took off some Judgments from Pharaoh; yet neither of them said
to have Repentance, Exodus 9.27.
nor were called Believers and Saints; but wicked Men: so we are quit of this.

IV. Nor can they be brought into this Company of whom Mr. Owen speaks, Page
402. Sect. 8. A sort of Men there are in the World, who escape the outward
pollutions of it, and are clean in their own eyes, though they are never washed
from iniquity; who having been under strong convictions by the power of the
Law, and broken thereby from the course of their sin, attending to the word of
the Gospel, with a temporary Faith, do go forth to a Profession of Religion,
and walking with God; so far as to have all the lineaments of true Believers, (
as Mr. Goodwin somewhere speaks, drawn in their faces) in hearing the word
gladly, as Herod did; receiving it with joy, as the stony ground did; attending
to it with delight, as those did Ezekiel. 33.31. repenting of former sins, as Ahab
and Judas, until they were reckoned among true Believers, as Judas and those
Joh. 2.23. who yet were never united to Christ. So far he.

But it is plain these were Hypocrites in a proper sense, professing to have
that they had not, and to walk with God as they did not; Prove. 30.12, 13. Mat.
23.25, 26, 27, 28. 2 Cor. 10, 11, 12, 18. Mat. 7.21, 22, 23, 24.
nor are such as these anywhere in Scripture called Believers and Saints; but
plainly affirmed, not washed from their filth, of lofty eyes, Hypocrites, not
wise, not approved; Sayers, and not Doers of the will of the Father; such as
Christ in his Ministration, and in the Ministration of his Servants, never
knew, owned or approved by any word of his: and though he yet wait with
patience on such, and use means that they might rightly convert; yet if they
persist, and do not convert, he will after, when the days of his patience is
out, notwithstanding all their profession, say to them, Depart from me, (not ye
Saints, but) yet that work inquity. And this he forewarned all his Hearers of,
that they might truly turn to him: neither have these all the Lineaments of
true Believers (of which Mr. Goodwin speaks, nor yet of which the Scripture
speaks) in their Faces, nor will the examples instanced prove them so to have:
for Herod's hearing John gladly, and doing many things, etc. what Lineament was
this, when he feared the people, and knew John both to be, and to be accounted
a Prophet, and to be just and holy? Mar. 6.17, 27. Luke 3.19, 20. Ezekiel. 33.31,
32, 33.
So that he had no just occasion to harm him, and yet kept him Prisoner; and
contrary to his preaching, kept to himself his Brother's Wife from him, living
uncleanly with her, and at her motion put John to death: nor was he ever
reckoned Believer and Saint, nor with them. And Ezekiel's Hearers are plainly
branded with Hypocrifie, that heard, and would not do, their Hearts running
after Covetousness; and so far from being reckoned among true Believers, that a
woe is denounced against them. As for Ahab's Repentance, there is nothing
affirmed of it, as the Lineament of a true Believer; nor was he so reckoned,
any more then Pharaoh, as is foreshewn. As for Judas Repentance, it was
hellish, and constrained by torment of Conscience, which led him to a vain
course, Mat. 27.3, 4, 5.
even to the Enemies of Christ, to ease his grief; nor was that Repentance a
Lineament of a true Believer; nor was he upon that account, or after, reckoned
among true Believers: and yet being a secret Thief before, what Believer soever
he was before that, he comes not within the compass of those set forth in Mr.
Owen his stating the Question. As for the stony Ground, it is a part of a
Parable uttered and opened by our Savior, showing the efficacy of the Word for
Fruits, rather then for Regeneration; for none was good Ground before the
receipt of the Word; but that received, and possessing the Heart, regenerated,
and made the Ground good, and then kindly fruitful, which could not be till
then. So that the Word in the Highway, if it had abiden, would have saved, and
made it good by degrees; but being suffered to be presently stolen out, Luke
8.12.
they remained Highway: they that suddenly believing were a little touched, if
they had abiden, minding that believed, and let it sink into their Heart, it
would have broken the Stone, and after that, have rooted up the Thorns also:
Mat. 13.20, 21, 22, 6. Jer. 23.29, 30.
But by being withdrawn by Tempration, as the other by worldly Thoughts, they
remained stony, and so became unfruitful: so, as how much, or how long they
believed, we have no warrant to make them like those forementioned; Nor yet of
them John 2.23. of whom it is not affirmed, they professed or confessed him:
There was more danger in that; then in believing. But I need take no pains in
this; for Mr. Owen has excluded these from those mentioned, in stating the
Question, of whom he affirms the Graces given and received, to be the works of
the Spirit, effectually working in all the powers of the Soul, and producing
Light, Love, Joy, Zeal, change of Affections, amendment of Life, Obedience:

And going over them again, Page 423. Chap. 17. Sect. 27. he says, That in
persons thus wrought upon, there is or may be, such an assent upon Light and
Conviction to the Truths professed and preached to them, as is true in its
kind, not counterfeit, giving and affording them in whom it is wrought,
Profession of the Faith, and that sometimes with constancy to the Death, or the
giving of their Bodies to be burned, with persuasions (whence they are called
Believers) of a future enjoyment of a glorious and blessed condition, filling
them with ravishing affections, and rejoycings in Hope, which they profess
suitable to the expectation they have of such an estate and condition. -- These
cannot be said to be Hypocrites in the most proper sense of that Word, etc.
their high Gifts, Knowledge, Faith, change of Affections, and Conversation,
being in their own kind true, (as the Faith of Devils.) So far he.

In all which it appears, That other rabble mentioned by him, cannot be
brought in to be numbered with these, which he confesses may abide and die in
the Faith, yea, and for the Profession of the Faith, or they may fall away; and
of such as do fall away, he says, Page 429. That before their falling, they
were in a fair way for Life and Salvation. As for his Parenthesis about the
Truth of their Faith, (As the Faith of Devils,) he therein intimately grants
this, That the Devils have Faith true in its kind; but, That the Devils have
Faith, and true Faith in any kind, as the word Faith is used in the Scripture,
I believe not, because with all my search I find not one such word there. That
the Devils in a sense do believe, That there is one God, I believe, because the
Scripture says it: But to believe the Devils have Faith, I dare not, because
it is said, The simple believes every word, but the prudent Man looks well
to his going. Iam. 2.19 Prove. 14.15. Deuteronomy. 32.20. Mat. 17.17. Mar. 9.19. Luke
9.41. 2 These. 3.2. with Romans 15.30, 31.
And upon search and pondering, I dare not say, but many of them did believe
there is one God, that are affirmed Children in whom is no Faith, and likewise
of those our Savior calls Faithless; yea, and some of them also of whom the
Apostle affirms, All Men have not Faith. I mean not to justify that foolish
Proverb, Seeing is believing: yet there is a believing that is from personal
knowledge, sight and sensible experience; and such believing is in the Devils.
But the believing that is called Faith, is a gracious Gift of God, Act. 17.31.
Romans 1.5. and 16.26. Act. 11.21. Romans 4.24. and 5.1. and 10.15. Gal. 3.1, 2, 3.
2 These. 1.3, 10.
in which he has provided for all Men an Object of Faith, and causes it to be
preached to Men for the Obedience of Faith. And those that in hearing hear, he
by his Spirit enlightneth their Minds, and moves their Hearts that they may
believe; and believing is no farther called Faith, then it closes with the
Object of Faith; and so Faith is by hearing, and the Spirit also; and so in
believing, receiving the Testimony, is in Men Faith; But God has provided no
Object of Faith for the Devils; and so for believing by Knowledge, Sight and
Sense, they do know, that is, so believe, that the Man Jesus Christ took
neither their Nature nor Cause on him, and so did not die, or work any
Redemption for them, but took on him the Nature and Cause of Mankind, (whom
the Devil had overthrown) and came to save Men, and of Purpose to destroy the
works of the Devil; and that there is no door of Repentance for them; but he
has destroyed his first work already, and is about destroying his second, and
will utterly destroy it, and in his time shut him up in prison for a time,
bound, and after cast him into a Lake of fire, tormenting him for all the
mischiefs he has done to Mankind, and to his People: he knows that God in
Christ is one, and will thus torment him; and this certainty of his knowledge,
and so believing, makes him tremble at the minding of his own Damnation. Now I
hope none will put the Sons of Men in the same species or rank and order with
the Devils, as that Christ took not their Nature and Cause on him, has wrought
no Redemption for them, nor opened any Door of Repentance to them, but came to
aggravate their sins, and so to damn them to the same punishment with the
Devils. If any should believe thus, they should believe as falsely, as the
Devils believe truly: But on the contrary, if any Man do by hearing the
Testimony of Christ, as verily believe Jesus Christ to have taken the Nature
and Cause of Mankind on him, and so to have died for our sins, and offered up
the acceptable Sacrifice to God, and so to be the Propitiation for the sins of
the World, and God through him propitious to Mankind, and so a Justifier of
sinners that believe in Jesus, and all this for the good of Mankind that they
might believe, and in believing be saved; This will fill a Man with Consolation
and Hope, as verily as the Devils believing the Truth of all this to be against
them, does fill them with trembling: and so believing, in the Devils, is
neither having of Faith, it makes them averse to it; but such believing in a
Man as closes with the Object of Faith, and receives influences from it, is
Faith. Hence the Apostle proves, That though a Man believe there is one God;
yet seeing God is in Christ propitions, if that he believes work not up
confidence and love to bring forth Fruits, either it is no Faith, he has never
yet been united to the Object; or if he were, he is withdrawn, and so has lost
the Spirit and Life of Faith, and so his Faith is become dead, like the Body of
a Man when the Soul and Spirit is departed: so that if the Faith in a Man, be
as real and true in its kind, closing with the Object, as the believing of the
Devils is true in their kind, filling them with enmity against that believed,
then that Faith is right, and in a Man as verily saving, as to the Devils an
occasion of trembling.

V. Whereas he says, They are changed as to their use, not in their Nature;
that is rather to be applied to those forementioned to be excluded, mentioned
in his 402 page, then to these mentioned in stating the Question; for if by
Nature he mean, as Men are naturally Gentiles, and so not of Abraham's Family,
and so not naturally under the Hope of that Covenant made with him: then I
suppose he will confess these to be changed in Nature, Mat. 28.19. Romans 11.24.
Ephesians. 2.11, 12, 13.
in being by the Gospel brought into Abraham's Family. If by Nature he mean a
change in the Mind, Will, and Affection, and so in the disposition and
inclination; himself has confessed this of these. 1 Ioh. 5.1.
If by Nature he mean some beginning of the Divine Birth opposed to the Humane,
then those that believe that Jesus is the Christ, are so far born of God; and
himself confesses, they have somewhat produced in all the faculties of their
Soul by the Spirit, subordinate to, like and suitable to the great Work of
Regeneration; Luke 20.36. Romans 8.23 Phil. 3.13, 13, 21.
and that is not complete till the Resurrection from the Dead: And so if by
Nature he mean the Nature of Man that is yet mortal, to be made immortal, the
best Saints have it not yet, but do wait for it to be completed in the
Resurrection, which these, he confesses, page 423. hope for.

And this I add: As he has professed himself not to mean ceremonial or seeming
Holiness; so I confess, Romans 1.7, 8. 1 Cor. 1.1, 9. and 6.2, 11. Ephesians. 1.1, 13.
Phil. 1.1, 6.
That in the Scripture, since Christ his Ascension into Heaven, none are called
Believers and Saints, upon account of any Faith and profession of Faith that is
not saving, and such as in which Men continuing, Col. 1.2, 4, 22, 23.
they shall undoubtedly be saved, as is foreshewn, Part 4. Chap. 4. and Chap. 5.

And thus I have according to his own Rule, only taken away those things,
which cannot be in the Faith and Holiness that is true in its kind.

CHAP. 3.
Of those things that are right and good in this description of the Faith and
Holiness that is true in its kind.

IN this Description of Faith and Holiness, these things are very good and true.

1. That the thing they are enlightened in, convinced by, and so believe, Rev.
19.10. Gal. 1.7, 8, 9. 2 Timothy 1.13. and 2.2.
it is the Truth proposed and preached to them, page 423. Chap. 17. Now if it
be the Truth, it can be no other nor less then the Testimony of Christ; and if
called Truths, they can be no other then the sayings in and according to that
Testimony, as namely, That Jesus is The Christ, The Son of the living God, The
Savior of the World; that he came into the World to save sinners, that he died
for our sins, and rose for our justification, and gave himself a Ransom for
all, and is the Propitiation for the sins of the whole World; that Repentance
and Forgiveness of sins is preached to them in his Name; that this Word is nigh
to them, that they might believe; and even therefore preached to them, that
they might obey in believing, and so be reconciled to God, and be saved; and
that he is at hand in this day of gracious Declaration, to succor them; and
that whoever believes in him, shall not perish, but receive Forgiveness of
sins, and so be saved, and have eternal life; and that he ever lives to
intercede for them that come to God by him, being able to save them to the
utmost; and that he will come again, and receive them to himself, and judge his
and their Enemies, etc. These and suchlike, and none contrary to these, are
the Sayings of Truth; and so in and with these Sayings, the Oblation, and
Intercession, and coming again of Christ; and therein so far, the Purposes, and
Promises, and Covenants of God have been proposed and preached to them, (as is
largely shown in this Treatise) if they have had Gospel-Preachers, which is
taken as granted in this business; and this Gospel, the Truth and Sayings of
Truth that they are convicted by, enlightened in, and believe: so in this we
agree; their Faith in respect of the Truth, the Object believed, is right.

2. That this their Faith is not of their acquiring, got by their strife and
reasoning; but by the Truth preached to them, Jam. 1.18. 1 Pet. 1.21. 2 These.
1.10.
and the work of the Holy Spirit therein, witnessing of Christ, illuminating
their Minds, and working upon their Hearts; so framing them to assent to, and
be persuaded of the Truth and Goodness of the Testimony, and so to believe: and
in this we agree with Truth, this believing; and so this Faith is right.

3. That the Spirit is in this Grace believed, so effectually working in all
the Powers of the Soul, Romans 1.16. 1 These. 2.13. and 1.5.
that he frames them to inward sorrow for their former Unbelief and Rebellions
against so gracious a God, and Repentance for their former evil Thoughts,
Affections and Ways, and so changes their Affections, and produces in them
Faith and Confidence in God, and hope of eternal Life; and so springs up love,
joy, zeal, and ravishing consolation. In all which it appears, a lively Faith,
and in this we agree with the Truth. This Faith is right, true and living.

4. That these inward operations of the Spirit, lead to, 2 Timothy 2.2 1 Iam.
2.18, 25.
and bring forth amendment of Life, Obedience to, and Profession of the Faith,
and walking with God, in which they become Vessels in the House of God, that do
worthily in their Generations; which none can do, but such as are purged, and
made fit for the Master's use. And this demonstrates and justifies the Truth
and Goodness of their Faith: and so right and good.

5. That all this Faith, Zeal, Obedience, and Profession is not counterfeit,
but true in its kind, [the kind can be no other but that which is suitable to
Christ the Object, the Spirit the Worker, and the Gospel the Instrument: for
there is not another Jesus, nor another Spirit, nor another Gospel true in its
kind, either for object of Faith, or begetting Faith] and these Believers are
affirmed to be no Hypocrites in the proper sense of the word, 1 Pet. 2.1, 2, 3.
[as for some hypocrisy to be by Grace resisting and casting out, this may be
found in the best of Saints on earth.]

6. That these Believers may abide to the death; yea, give their Body to be
burned, and die with rejoicing in this Faith. To all which I assent.

If any say, Mr. Owen says not thus:

I answer, If he speak of the Gospel of Christ, and the Belief, and Obedience,
and Profession thereof, he has said no less then all this, by many and plain
expressions, as may be seen in his stating the Question, and going over it
again, page 10. and 423. nor is here any thing put by and taken out, but
according to his own direction and rule, that for which he has no plain Saying
of Scripture; nay, that which will not agree with, but crosses
Gospel-Testimony: so that I may truly say, (if by Truth he mean Gospel) as
Elihu to Job, These are the voice of his words. Job 33.8.
And of this Faith and Holiness, true in its kind, he takes Mr. Goodwin and
others to mean: of which, when the mixtures darkning it are taken away, as not
appertaining to it, that it appears as it is by it self, none need to be
ashamed to own it; nor can any produce a Faith of another kind, that is
better, or so good, or true in its kind, and prove it so. And from this Faith
Mr. Owen professes a Man may fall: wherefore you that through Grace believe,
as is said, abide, go on, live and die in this Faith, (as Mr. Owen also says
you may) and whatsoever any say of it, you shall assuredly be eternally saved,
you have the Testimony of Christ, his Oblation, Intercession, the Purposes,
Promises and Covenants of God, and his Spirit in his Prophets and Apostles
assuring you of this.

But for weakening the excellency of this kind of Faith, besides the mixtures
put in, he seems to prove his business by Heb. 6.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. which is
all that I can find produced with any enforcement, and that is only first
quoted, page 10, but after amplified and pressed, page 423. chap. 17. I shall
therefore in the next place consider that portion of Scripture, with, and as
agreeing with other places speaking of the same things.

CHAP. 4.
Of Hebrews 6.1.

HEb. 6.1. Therefore leaving the principles of the Doctrine of Christ, (or, the
word of the beginning of Christ) let us go on unto perfection, not laying again
the foundation of, etc. And in this, before we proceed, are four Questions to
be answered, for understanding these words.

Quest. 1. What is here meant by the word of the beginning of Christ, or the
Doctrine of the beginning, or the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ, or the
first Principles of the Oracles of God? as chap. 5.12.

And the Answer to this may be read at large before written, Part 2. Chap. 10.
which it were a shame for any that have sometime believed, Heb. 5.12.
to stand in need to be taught again which they be, The Oblation of Christ with
the Ends and Virtues of it, and those Oracles in it, and proceeding from it, as
there shown by Scripture to be the Word of the beginning of Christ, and first
Principles: and in this Epistle also, diverse hints thereof, as speaking of
Christ, saying, Chap. 1.3.
Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person,
and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself
purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, Chap. 2.3.
etc. How shall we escape if we neglect so great Salvation, which at the first
began to be spoken (or preached) by the Lord, and was after confirmed to us by
them that heard him, etc. We see Jesus who was made a little lower then the
Angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, Chap. 1.1.
Chap. 2.9.
that he by the Grace of God should taste death for every man, (every of those
of that Nature, in which he was made lower then the Angels, that in it he might
suffer for those of that Nature.) Forasmuch as the Children are partakers of
flesh and blood; Chap. 2.14. verse. 16. Romans 9.5. Act. 17.26 Luke 3.38. Act. 5
3^. and 3.47 Heb. 2 14. chapter 5.8, 9.
(that is, the natural Children of Abraham, to whom in this Epistle he writes,
and of whom Christ came, they, as others, were mortal; so, as the same in
speaking to the Gentiles, may besaid of the natural Children of Adam; for God
made all Nations of Men of one Blood: and of Adam also Christ came: and so the
same in effect said of srael, is also said of the Gentiles; and so all of one
Blood) he also himself took part of the same, that through death, he might
destroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devil, etc. And after,
though he were a Son, yet he learned Obedience by the things which he suffered;
and being made perfect, he became the Author of Eternal Salvation unto all them
that obey him: which things hinted here, are opened in treating of the Oblation
of Christ, and shown to be in the word of the beginning of Christ, in the place
pointed to for answer of this.

Quest. 2. What is meant here by leaving the word of the beginning of Christ?

And this requires both a negative, and an affirmative Answer: and so,

1. A negative Answer, Not the believing remembrance of it; 1 Cor. 11.26. and
15.1, 2, 3, 4 romans 4.25. and 5.6, 1. 2 Timothy 2.8. 2 Pet. 1.12, 13. Romans 1.3, 4.
1 Cor. 1.17, 18. and 2.2. 2 Cor. 5.19, 20. 2 Timothy 4.7. Jude 3. Heb. 7.25, 28
and 10.19. and 9.14, 15. and 10.22, 25. and 12, 2, 3. and 13.15, 16. and 9.12,
14, 15. and 12.24. and 9.14. and 10.14, 22.
nor the prizing embracing, and believing encouragements, instructions and
consolations from is, and in, and through it; for so he wills us always to
remember it, and says, We shall in such believing remembrance of it, be saved:
no, nor yet the holding of it forth, and contending for the Truth and Goodness
of it against all opposers; not so to be left, but stood to and kept: nor is
the usefulness of it in all teachings, or in any to be left: for there is
nothing can be rightly known or taught without it; yea, in this and in all
these respects, he makes use of it, not only before, but after this saying in
this Epistle, to encourage them in their approaches to God, in their confidence
in God, for the Promises of the New Testament; yea, for all their spiritual
Sacrifices and holy Walkings, both in sufferings and well-doing; yea, he shows
Christ his obtaining eternal Redemption, and his Mediation of the
New Testament, to be by virtue of his Blood and Sacrifice; and his
Peace-speaking to the Hearts of his People, and his purifying of them also, to
be by virtue of the same Blood and sacrifice. So that it is evident and plain,
He neither desired nor intended at all, or in the least, or upon any account,
to leave the believing, minding, and prizing of it, nor the holding it forth,
nor the usefulness of it; no, nor yet simply and wholly to leave it in that
sense, of which he here speak, not in respect of all times, or of all persons.
But,

2. Assirmative Answer; To leave, was at that time, and in this business in his
present writing, to leave or let rest the declaring again what is the
Foundation, and which be the first Oracles of it, and opening the Principles of
the same: though the same was still needful both for him, and for them, to
teach others, yet not for him now, in respect of these, to be still in this
manner laying again the Foundation, so known among them, and thereby to hinder
and forbear his farther building upon it: and this to be the sense, Chap. 5.12,
10, 11, 13. 1 Pet. 2.21. Mat. 5.24. Act. 6.2.
appears his express words, and also in the Reason there given of it. And in
this sense, Leaving is not casting off, but letting remain: and yet for
present, forbearing the pursuit of such a business or discourse, to follow on
with that intended. So the sense.

Quest. 3. For what cause he would leave such a discourse at this time, as the
declaring what is the Found uion, and which are the first Oracles, and opening
again what the first Principles it teaches be; which later he only names
here, but opens not, nor any farther proceeds after in this Epistle, to say
which is the Foundation, or which be the first Oracles, or to o^en what those
first Principles are, but proceeds in usefulness of all together: for what
cause he so does?

Answ. 1. Because he takes this for granted, They to whom he directed this
Epistle, were already fully persuaded of the Foundation, what it was; and knew,
and were instructed in the first Oracles of it, Heb. 3 1, 6, 14. and 6.10.
ebap. 5.11, 12.
and did also enjoy the first Principles: they were holy Brethren, Partakers of
the heavenly Call, had their joycing of Hope, and the beginning of Confidence,
and showed forth the efficacies of Faith in their labor of Love, though
through their dullness of hearing they had deprived themselves of that clear and
larger understanding which for the time they might have had: They which ought
to be Teachers of others, need themselves to be taught again which be the first
Principles, etc. and are become such, (that is, in their own demeanor and
exercise) as have need of Milk, etc. Milk here not used in that sense, 1 Pet.
2.2, 3, 4, 5.
as by Peter, for the sincere Milk of the Word, the gracious influences flowing
from Christ; refreshing, drawing, and strengthening Believers, and so building
them more upon him, that so they are offering up spiritual Sacrifices, etc.
which is the same with that the Apostle proceeds to here in this Epistle: But
Milk signifies here, the lowest and first Rudiments in which Men are to be
catechized, and to know and believe, before they can be built up, as mentioned
in this following discourse of the Apostle, even as to the Corinthians, among
whom was some ignorance and divisions, about the Foundation and first Oracles
in many among them, and some denying the Resurrection of the Body, 1 Cor. 3.2.
Ephesians. 5.1. 1 Cor. 14.20. Joel 3.18.18 Ier. 11.5. 1 Pet. 2.2. Isa. 28.9. 1 Cor.
3.2. Heb. 5.12.
etc. he says therefore, He fed them with Milk. And so, as the word Children
is sometime used in the better part, for such as are child-like affected: and
sometime in the worser part, for such as are weak and ignorant: so is the word
Milk sometime used in the best part, for all fullness and excellency of
provision; and sometime for that is more easy and fit for weaklings. And so it
is used here, as appears in that which follows, And not of strong meat. In
this Milk appears to be meant, as is said, in the lowest sense, in that it is
opposed to strong Meat, as 1 Cor. 3.2. it being not so opposed, 1 Pet. 2.2, 3,
4, 5. where the same is called Milk for its sweetness and easiness of
digesture, Isa. 5 5.1, 3.
that is also strong Meat, even good and fatness for strengthening. And strong
Meat signifies here, not simply any other Doctrine, but the same more clearly
opened, and farther pressed, for Men's spiritual feeding on it, and growth by
it; at which weaklings, not skilled in the Oracles and first Principles of the
Foundation, use to slumble, as those to whom our Savior plainly uttered the
beginnings; Joh. 6.27, 29, 48, 51, 63.
and they not content therewith, and so not believing, yet pressed him with
Queries for farther opening, which, when granted them, they stumbled at it:
(and sometimes strong Meat signifies harder services and greater sufferings
required:) Mat. 9.14, 17. Phil. 1.9, 10.
and so strong Meat here taken for such proceeding in Doctrine, as in the
following Discourse. And so, though the Apostle reproves these Hebrews, for
making themselves like such weaklings, yet he does not judge them to be every
way such indeed, as he professes in his expressions and persuasions of them,
foreshewn: but he judged them to know and believe the first Oracles and
Principles; and being persuaded, they would by this reproof be quickened to
attend, he will forbear the farther opening and declaring these first
Principles, but only mentioning them, and so proceed to that he intended. And
this is one Reason of it: another is,

2. Because if he should be still declaring to them what the Foundation is, and
which be the first Oracles of God; Chapter 5.5, 10, 11, 14, and 7, and 8, and 9,
and 10.
and so opening the Principles thereof to them, it would hinder his present
design in this Epistle, of opening to them the many and great things of Christ
in his Priesthood and Mediation of the New - Testament, and Intercession
thereby, to build them up farther, which was his business now in hand, and
which in this Epistle he was resolved to pursue.

3. Because they that are indeed ignorant of the Foundation, not being
instructed in it, and firmly believing it, Chapter 5.13, 14. 1 Cor. 3.1, 2, 3, 4.
and so not skilled in the Oracles of God and the first Principles thereof,
which they be, and how founded on the word of the beginning of Christ, they are
not capable to be instructed into, and built upon Jesus Christ in the
discoveries of the excellencies of his remaining Priesthood, and Mediation of
the New Testament: and so it would not be profitable so to open the same to
them; yea, our Savior tells his Disciples that were yet weak in their
Knowledge and Faith, about his Death, Resurrection, Ascension,
Sacrifice-Offering, and sending forth Spirit, Joh. 16.12. Mar. 4.33.
That they were not yet able to bear many things he had to say to them: and so
he spoke to the People in many Parables, and as they were able to bear it, not
ordinarily in such open cleerness, as in Joh. 6.48, 66. And while Men (where
Gospel as now come forth is taught) do come to know the Foundation and Oracles
of God in it, and the first Principles thereof, and be firmed in their
persuasion of the Truth and Goodness thereof, whatever they are learning, they
are not come to the knowledge of the Truth: if they fall on interpreting
Scripture, 2 Timothy 3.7. 2 Pet. 3.15, 16. 1 Timothy 3.6.
they will wrest them to their own destruction; nor are such to be admitted
into the Ministry, lest they fall, etc. therefore to such as these he directed
not this Epistle; and if any such were among them, themselves might teach these
things to them, till they were fit to be taught what he now writes, and so
would he in his Ministration where he met with them, but not for fear of these,
leave off his intended business, thus directed to such as were capable to
receive profit by it: that also one Reason.

4. Because if there should be any among them, of their Society, to whom he
directs this Epistle, that have not only known by a ministerial Teaching, the
Foundation what it is, and the Oracles of God in and by it, what they are, and
the first Principles thereof, and so hold them all in Opinion; but in the
Ministration of the Gospel, and their understanding these things, have been
illuminated by the Holy Spirit, and so wrought to Repentance from dead works,
and such Faith toward God, as they tasted of the heavenly Gift; and so that
the Lord is Gracious, and in usefulness of the Doctrines of Baptisms, with
Word, Water, Afflictions and Spirit, were made Partakers of the Holy Ghost in
his spiritual Evidences, Operations and Gifts, and in the Assemblies, Prayers,
and laying on of Hands of his People, have tasted of the good Word of God in
his faithful performance of his Promises, and in the belief of the Resurrection
and eternal Judgment, have tasted or felt the spiritual efficacies or powers
of the World to come: all which he believes to be in these he writes to. And
if such do fall away, he will not say there is any such among them: he is
better persuaded of them: but if any such, (he says not, if any that are yet
ignorant of the first Principles; for, notwithstanding their declinings, they
may be hopefully taught them again; but if any such as they) fall from the
Foundation and first Principles, and so fall away: even as to the Galatians,
Whosoever of you (of you that received the Spirit of Adoption in belief of
Christ crucified for you) are justified by the Law, Gal. 1.6. and 3.1. and 4.4,
7. and 5.2, 3.
(and so Christ become of no effect to you) ye are fallen from Grace: And so
here, they that having received all this before mentioned, if they fall away,
it is impossible to renew them again to Repentance etc. and so the laying again
of the Foundation, and opening the Principles to such, Chap. 6.4, 5, 6.
will not be of any profit for them: therefore the thoughts of such shall not
hinder; But he will forbear further discourse in this Epistle of those first
things, and proceed to his intended business; and that another Reason, and in
them all a full Answer of the cause of his present leaving such a discourse.

Quest. 4. What that going on to perfection is, he craveth Liberty for, and
therein exhorts them to the same?

Answ. That is evident and manifest in all this Epistle, to be no other, but to
instruct them, Chapter 5.10, 17. and 6.19, 20. and 7.1, 25. and 8 and 9.12, 28. and
10, etc.
and that they might be instructed farther in the Ends, Virtues and
Excellencies of the Cross of Christ, his Blood and Sacrifice, his Oblation
declared in the word of the beginning of Christ, as declared, discovered, and
shown forth in the Excellency and Prevalency of his ever-abiding Priesthood,
after the Order, not of Aaron, but of Melchizedec, and of his Mediation of the
New Testament, and of his continual Intercession, by virtue of his Blood and
Sacrifice once offered: and all this Mediation and Intercession for his called,
that come to God by him, to fit them for, and preserve them to the Inheritance,
that they may live by Faith in him, and look for his coming again, and then
receive it; that by instructing them in the Knowledge and Faith hereof, Ephesians.
1.17, 20. and 3.14, 15, 20. 2 Pet. 1.1, 2, 8.
they might be more built on Jesus Christ, and grow up into more Union and
Fellowship with him, and Conformity to him. And in these Answers, we may be
helped to see his meaning and drift, in saying, Therefore leaving the word of
the beginning of Christ, let us go on to perfection.

CHAP. 5.
Of Hebrews 6.1.

NOt laying again the Foundation of Repentance, and of Faith toward God. As if
he should say. Do not put us to that, by such discourse, to be still and again
laying the Foundation, and so to hinder us from building thereon: In which
manner speaking we may note,

1. That the Foundation was forelaid among these. The Oblation of Christ
taught, Heb. 10.32. and 3.1, 6, 14. 1 Cor. 15.1, 2, 3, 4. Gal. 1.6, 9. and 3.1.
and 4.7, etc.
with the first Oracles thereof, and the first Principles opened and pressed,
and the same heard, known, and in believing received; and the spiritual
Efficacies experimented by these Hebrews, who were illuminated, Holy. Brethren,
Partakers of the heavenly Call, as it was with the Corinthians; they had not
only heard, but received, that in which they stood, and in retaining should be
saved: and so the Galatians.

2. That the Foundation laid, was not the Principles here named, as Repentance.
Ezra 4.10. and 5.16. Zach. 4.9.
etc. but the Foundation is that in which are, and from which the Oracles come
that teach the Principles, and on which they are founded, it being the Ground,
Motive, Builder, and Foundation of them; as the Foundation of an House or
Temple, is not the House or Temple, but that on which the House or Temple is
builded.

3. That the Foundation is that which is first brought forth and laid; 1 King.
5.17. and 6.37, 38.
yea, perfectly and-compleatly laid, before any other thing be laid or built on
it, and so nothing laid under it, or before it; not any thing to be built on,
before it, or besides it; but it first, and first complete, and then all that
House or Temple, and every stone to be laid on and builded, comes after, and is
builded on that first-laid Foundation; and so the whole House and building
being on that Foundation, that is sure and firmly laid, the Foundation is the
Upholder and Bearer of all the whole building that is builded on it. This is
plain to any. ^uk. 6, 48.


4. That in spirituals, of all the Principles here mentioned, and of all that
farther growth and excellency the Apostle presses to; of all Repentance
toward God, Faith in God, Love to God, Walking with God, Hope in God; of
Vocation, Sanctification, Election; of Union and Fellowship together with him;
of Teaching, Baptizing, Praying; of Perserance and Enjoyment of the
Inheritance, Jesus Christ as set forth in the Gospel, in which he is
Evangelized; in respect of what from eternity he was, 1 Pet. 1.25. Phil. 2.6,
10. Romans 3.25. 1 Cor. 1.17, 18. and 2.1, 2. Heb. 7.27, 28. 1 Timothy 2.7. 1 John
4.14. 2 Cor. 5.18, 19. Part 4. c. 10.
and what he became, and what in himself he has suffered and done, and what
received in the Nature of Man and for Men, and what he is set forth to be for
Men; him, and him crucified, with the Virtues, and Excellencies, and Ends of
his Blood and Sacrifice: all included in his Oblation, in which he offered
himself to God for men, and is by God set forth for a Savior and Salvation to
Men; and so laid in Sion: and in respect of all this, and Jesus Christ so set
forth, is The Foundation, (though despised by many Builders, The precious
Cornerstone: and this the Name, and the only Name given unto Men, whereby
they may be saved; this that Rock, living and quickening Stone and Foundation,
on which all that by Grace believe, are built up a spiritual House; this the
Rock, against which the Gates of Hell shall not prevail; this that laid by the
Apostles; and other can no Man lay, then this which is laid, which is Jesus
Christ; and the word of the beginning of Christ, is that which thus discovers
him; and by the Oracles in that discovery, draws to him, and teaches these
Principles, 1 Cor. 3.10, 11.
which are derived from, and bottomed on him, and so built on him, and brings
to understand the whole Testimony of Christ, the Medium of farther building;
all which, the Gospel believed with the Heart, effects, and keeps on this
Foundation, and caliveneth these Principles: and there is no other Foundation,
nor Oracles, nor Principles, that are real and true in their kind, of saving
tendency, but these; which therefore are to be so firmly held, as no need of
laying and begetting of them again: let us take some view of them.

The first Principle named, is Repentance from dead works, Principle 1. Luke
24.42. Act. 20.21. Mat. 9.13. Luke 15.7.
which as it is taught by the Oracles of God, flowing from the Foundation held
forth in the Gospel; so it is the same that is preached in the Name of Christ
with Remission of sins, called Repentance toward God, that which Christ came
to call sinners to; for which, when wrought; 2 Cor. 7.9, 10. Act. 13.24. and
2.38. and 3.19. Act. 11.18.
there is joy among the Angels of God, it being according to God, and so a
Repentance not to be repented of. This that also, which John in
Gospel-preaching taught, and which the Apostles taught and called for, and
which God has granted, to such, as, in his giving, receive the Gospel: this
Repentance being the very same with that so often called for, Prove. 1.22, 23. 2
Pet. 3.9. Ezekiel. 18.30. And so it is, A change of Mind, Ezekiel. 14.6. Jer. 26.3.
and 4.1, 2. Hos. 14.1, 2. Joel 2.12.
Inclination and Way, in turning from the evil Judgment, Confidence, Purpose.
Desires Way and Works, which one has formerly allowed himself in; and turning
toward that Goodness, Mercy and Truth presented in and by the Gospel to thim;
with inward grief for, and dislike of their former evil Judgment, Confidence,
Purpose, Desires, Way and Works; and with love and desire of enjoyment of the
Grace of God in Christ, with confidence in him, and living to him.

And in this Principle note three things: Act. 2.37. and 3.19, 26. Zach. 12.10.
Act. 17.30, 31.


1. That this Repentance is effected by the Gospel, discovering Christ, as
having died for our sins, and rose for our justification, and given himself a
Sacrifice to God for us, and used means to bring us to himself: which beheld
and minded, it makes appear the vileness of our sinsulness, and vanity of our
righteousness, that could not be pardoned without so great sufferings of so
mighty a one; and the odiousness of our continuance in sinning against one, so
great and glorious; and yet so loving, even to such Enemies as we, and his love
commended through such Blood shed for us: and this seen, melts the heart with
sorrow for evils, and turns the bent of the heart to him; yea, without this
there is no door of Repentance, or any hope in it; for the Law of Works admits
not of Repentance after sin committed, Gal. 3.10.
but binds over to the Curse; so, as Repentance is bootless and in vain, under
and by that Covenant; Heb. 9.22. Act. 18.27. Jer. 18.8. Isa. 57.7.
neither is there any conceit or fancy of Election that can give this hope to
effect such Repentance; for without shedding of blood, there is no Remission of
sins: Christ crucified for sinners, made known in the Gospel, is the very door
of Repentance, as well as of Faith: so that whoever knows and believes him
the Propitiation for the sins of the World, has a good ground of Repentance
and turning to God; nor shall it be in vain, but accepted. And from this
Gospel-Message believed, is the rise of all true Repentance.

2. That as this Repentance is wrought by and founded on the Oblation of Christ
made known, so it is the first thing taught and called for, in and by the
discovery of Christ in the Gospel: and in believing the Gospel, it first
effects this change, and turning of the Mind, Heart, and Way, from its
former evil Judgment, Purpose, Affection and Way, to the Goodness and Grace of
God, that reproves the same; and so to its tenders and teachings: such the
Order of Christ in his Call, Turn you at my reproof, Prove. 1.22, 23. and 9.6.
Ephesians. 5.14. Act. 2.38. Isa. 40.6, 8. 1 Pet. 1.24. Ioh. 3.20, 21.
and I will pour out my Spirit, and make known my words to you: and so
explained by him, Forsake the foolish, and live: and so by the Apostles. The
Light and Oracles proceeding from Christ, reproves and cries down all flesh;
and he that imbraceth not that reproof, comes not into the light; but he that
imbraceth it, does therein come to the light: and that this is first called
for, is evident and express, Mar. 1.15. Luke 24.47. Act. 20.21.

3. That this Repentance has not only in it a turning from deadly works, such
as the natural Consciences of Men will smite and wound them for, as Atheism,
Blasphemy, Perjury, Murder, Adultery, Stealth, false Witness-bearing, Lying,
Drunkenness, etc. but also a turning from dead works, such as Men in their
ignorance and natural Conscience think to serve God, and get Life and savor
with God by, whether Idolatry, Romans 1.22, 23. Isa. 44.20. Hos. 8.14 Isa. 29.13.
Mat. 15. Romans 9.32. and 10.2, 3. Luke 18.11, 12, 13. Phil. 3.7, 8, 9. Isa.
52.2, 3.
in worshipping Images and Resemblances, as representations of God; or
Superstitions and Devices of Men, and Traditions of our Fathers to worship God
by; or endeavors to stablish a Righteousness of their own in Works of the Law,
to get the Righteouseess of God by. All which, how goodly soever and gainful
they appear to a natural man, yet in this knowing and beholding of Christ, and
him crucified, they become as loss; and a man repents, and turns from them
to Christ, as is said.

And this is the Repentance that is from dead Works, and toward God; and there
is no other Repentance, or otherwise wrought, that is a Principle, or of any
account in the Gospel of Christ, or mentioned there, as that for which any are
called Saints. And this Principle these Hebrews had.

The second Principle is, Principle 2. Act. 20.21 Romans 9.5. Joh. 14.6. Ephesians.
2.17. 2 Cor. 4.6. Romans 1.5. and 16.26. Prove. 14.15. Jam. 2.19. Romans 10.17. Col.
1.4.
Faith toward God. This is the same with that called Faith toward our Lord
Jesus Christ, who is God over all, blessed for ever, and the only Medium of
approaching to God, and he in whom the Face of God shines; so that it is in
Scripture Language evident, That the Principle here called, Faith toward God,
is the Grace or Gift of Faith to and in a man, which closes with the Object of
Faith, and so is Obedience to the Faith; for, as is foreshewn, every believing
is not Faith: the Fool believes every thing, and the Devils believe, who yet
are nowhere said to have Faith; but that Belief which is of the Faith, and
closes with the Faith, is in Scripture called Faith: and so this affirmed
here, as one of the first Principles, taught and begot by the Oracles of God,
building it on the Foundation, is said to be the Faith that comes by hearing
the Word of the Lord, and so the Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. And so it is,
An inward under standing, Joh. 6.40. Romans 10.8, 9, 10. Gal. 5.6.
discerning, and minding the gracious Mind of God, testified, and appearing in
Jesus Christ: by which one is inwardly persuaded and believes the Truth and
Goodness of the same: and so with the heart in love, desires and confidence,
imbraceth it: whence the Grace believed, works renewed disposition: and that
welleth out confession: and this expressed in Scripture, to be that believing
which is called Faith, Heb. 11.13, 14, 15.

So that this Faith having embraced the Word, is a Principle within him that
believes; for he that believes on the Son of God, has the Witness (or
Testimony, or Record) in himself. And so likewise, 1 John 5.10.
we have three things to note in this Faith, as it is a Principle.

1. Act. 1.20. Romans 1.5. and 10.8, 9, 17. and 16.26. 1 Cor. 3.5. 2 Cor. 3.3.
That it is begotten and produced by the Declaration and Ministration of Christ
crucified, etc. and the Love of God commended through him, set forth in the
Gospel, the Word of Faith, and the Oracle of God.

2. That it is wrought in the truning of the heart unto the Lord: whence it
here fitly both follows, Act. 11.21. and 15.9, 11, 15. and 26.18, 20. 2 Cor.
3.16.
and is joined with Repentance from dead Works, according to that promised,
Prove. 1.23.

3. That it is founded and bottomed upon the very Blood and Sacrifice of
Christ, Romans 3.25. and 5.6, 8, 9, 10, 11.
as the Love of God is commended therethrough.

And this is the Faith begot by the Oracles of God, as one of the first
Principles thereof; yea, this with the Repentance mentioned, are often included
both in one, or either of the names; being ever together, and neither of them
being where either of them is wanting: and so the Faith of and in such turned
ones, is that Faith by which the Believer stands and lives. And all the
following Principles here named, are for the quickening, strengthening,
increasing, exercising, and making fruitful this Faith in which the Spirit
dwells and works; and so it works through Love.

CHAP. 6.
Of Hebrews 6.2.

HEb. 6.2. Of the Doctrine of Baptisms, etc. Note well the words: he speaks not
here of Baptism or Baptisms, as before he did of Repentance and Faith; and so
he speaks not here directly and properly of the Act or Work of Baptizing; Romans
6.3, 4, 5. Gal. 3.26, 27. Mat. 28.19, 20.
either inwardly, which is into the death of Christ, and conformity with him
therein, which is done in this Repentance and Faith formentioned: nor yet of
that outward act of Baptizing with Water, in the Name of, etc. which is a
witness of that done in and by Christ, and a Medium having its tendency to that
forementioned, which is the Baptism indeed; Ephesians. 4.4, 5. 1 Pet. 3.21.
which for the substance of it, and that which is spiritual and saving indeed,
is one, and but one: for as there is one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one
Faith; so there is one Baptism: and so, that he here speaks directly of, is not
the Work, but the Doctrine of Baptisms, that is, the Teaching and instruction,
given by the Oracles, about and concerning Baptismes, which, by the term in the
Plural Number, can be no other but the several ways and mediums appointed; and
having their tendency toward Baptizing, or for preparing for, and effecting
that which is Baptism indeed, which because of their tendency and use to it,
are called by that Name, each of them Baptism, and all together Baptisms. And
about this Doctrine of Baptisms, I shall note three things in the Doctrine.

I. That these ways and mediums of Baptizing are four, each of them bearing
the Name of Baptism, as an Instrument used to that end.

1. The prime and chief ministerial way of Baptizing, is the word of the Gospel
opened and applied in preaching; Mar. 1.4. Luke 3.3. Joh. 1.29. Act. 10.25.
so John, besides his baptizing with Water, did preach the Baptism of
Repentance for the Remission of sins; and this was that Apollos knew and
taught, being called Baptism.

2. Baptizing with Water in the Name of, etc. is that which was first, 1 Cor.
1.14. Romans 2.28, 29. Romans 6.4, 5. Gal. 3.25, 26. 1 Cor. 10.1, 2.
and is most frequently called Baptism: and as the spiritual Work of Grace in
the Heart, was never called Circumcision till the outward Ordinance of
Circumcision was given from Heaven, and then frequently so called, as that
which is indeed, The approved Circumcision; so the Work of Grace in the Heart,
was never called Baptism, till the outward Ordinance of Baptism was given from
Heaven: but since, so called: so likewise, the other mediums, that have their
tendency to that gracious work, are also since, upon the same account, called
Baptisms; as follows.

3. Afflictions, Sufferings for the Name of Christ, are also called Baptism.
Luke 12.50 Mat. 20.22, 23 Mar. 10.38, 39.
I, says Christ, speaking of his Sufferings, Have a Baptism to be baptized
with: and of sufferings also he says to his Disciples, Ye shall be baptized
with the Baptism that I am baptized with.

4. The inward Inlightnings, Breathings, and Operations of the Holy Ghost in
and with all the former mediums, Mat. 3.11 Mar. 1.8. Luke 3.16. Joh. 1.33. and
7.38, and 14.26.
is also called Baptism: this being the proper work of Christ himself in his
promised presence, in the Ministration of the Gospel, and according to it, in
all the means he uses for effecting this one gracious and spiritual Baptism,
Act. 1.5. Mat. 28.20.

II. The Gospel in the Doctrine of Baptisms farther teaches of these mediums:

1. That God has a gracious end in all these, in visiting us with his Word, in
having admitted us into his Family, in afflicting us and in extending motions
of his Spirit, moving in our Hearts, as namely, to discover to us that filth of
flesh and corruption that is in us, to abase us for it, and break us off from
it; and to bring us more to prise, desire, and accept that purgation that is in
Christ Jesus for us: and by this means drawing to him, thereby to baptize and
wash us into more conformity to him, even in his death and purity, so to humble
and cleanse us, that he may quicken and raise us: The Word is fit for all this
2 Timothy 3.16. Psa. 119.9. Joh. 15.3.
. Baptism with Water in his Name having been once received, remains a Testimony
and Instruction of the Truth of the Peace and Purgation made by Christ, and the
effectualness of the cleansing that is in him to bestow, and his readiness to
communicate it to all, that by Repentance and Faith come to him, having
received us into his Family, that we might learn and receive the same of him
Mat. 28.19, 20 Mar. 1.4. Act. 2.37, 38. 1 Cor. 1.13.
: Afflictions fitted also to the same end, to humble us, and drive us, and
conform us to Christ Job 33.16, 23, 24. Hof. 5.15. Isa. 27.19.
: and spiritual motions are also for the same end Joh. 16.7, 15.
: and that God in using all, or any of these means toward us, has even this
gracious end for our good, to better us by it Psalm. 119.68.
, in sending his Word, Act. 3.26. and 26.18, in having admitted us into his
Family, Exodus 12.48.49. in afflicting and chastening us, Heb. 12.5-10. in
moving at our Hearts by his Spirit, Prove. 1.23. Rev. 3.20. extending all for
good to us.

2. That in beholding and minding Jesus Christ, as he died and offered himself
for us; Rev. 1.16. 1 These. 2.13. Psa. 65.4. 1 Cor. 15.1, 2, 3, 4. Heb. 22.2,
11. Mic. 2.7 Iam. 4.5, 6. Gal. 6.8.
and so receiving his Sayings; and minding our Engagement to him, receiving
correction in his chastisements, and yielding up to his spiritual motions, we
shall indeed be verily more baptized into Christ, more humbled in our selves,
more cleansed from our filth, and more conformed to the mind of Christ: and
all these things are taught in the Doctrine of Baptisms. And so,

III. The Principle it self is expressed, the Doctrine of Baptisms; Principle 3.
which by all said about it, appears plainly to be, A right judgment of God in
Christ, Prove. 22.17, 21. Psa. 107.43. and 94.12, 13. with Deuteronomy. 4.35, 36. Psa.
119.68, 86.
concerning his gracious and in all this his dealing with us, in a discovery to
the heart by the Gospel, and an inward persuasion and belief in the heart,
effected by the Gospel, that God both in giving and causing his Word to be
preached to us, and in having admitted us into his Family, and in all his
corrections and sufferings, that come upon us; and in all his spiritual motions
of Grace stirring in our Hearts, has this loving and gracious end toward us,
that we may be thereby more baptized into the Death of Christ, that so we might
partake more of the virtue of his Resurrection; and so to cleanse us more from
all filthiness of flesh and Spirit, and conform us more to the Mind of Christ.

And in this we have three things to note.

1. Ioh. 3.17. 1 Timothy 1.15.
That this Principle is founded upon the Oblation of Jesus Christ, and the love
of God to Mankind commended therethrough: this is the Foundation of reaching
this Principle and the ground of affirming the Truth of God's having so
gracious ends in all these means used toward us; for if there were any man for
whom Christ had not died and risen, to preach Repentance or Faith in the Name
of Christ to such a man, 1 Cor. 15.14, 15, 17, 18. 1 Timothy 2.4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Romans
2.8. and 5.10. and 8.32, 36, Judge. 23.23.
or to declare any gracious ends of God's toward such men, by his Word, or
Baptism, or Afflictions, or spiritual Motions, were to bear false witness of
God: and if such should receive the Doctrine, it would be a vain Faith and
Persuasion. But the Ransom given by Christ for all men, being the ground of
the Truth, and the motive to persuade all this, it is verily true and sound:
and the same Oblation and Sacrifice of Christ believed, is the ground and
foundation of such a persuasion and belief of God concerning his gracious ends
toward us, in such things forementioned.

2. That this Principle flows up by and with the former two, Romans 5.1, 2, 3, 4,
5. Psalm. 119. 68, 84.
being only in those, that from believing the Oblation of Christ, have been
led to Repentance from dead Works, and Faith toward God; in which they are
also framed to this persuasion of God about his gracious ends toward us in all
these his dealings with us.

3. That this Principle and Persuasion of God in the Heart, Phil. 2.5, 8. chapter
3.3, 7, 8, 9, 10. Romans 6.3, 4, 5, 6
inclines the Heart to be willing to be conformed to the death of Christ, and
so framed to his mind, by all the means he uses to that end toward us. And
this the Persuasion and Principle begotten in the Heart by the Oracles of God
in the Doctrine of Baptisms.

CHAP. 7.
Of Hebrews 6.2.

HEb. 6.2. And of laying en of hands. This by the connection of the words,
appears to be the Doctrine of laying on of hands. And for the right
understanding of this Principle, four things are to be well heeded.

1. What laying on of hands was, used by Christ, and his Apostles and first
witnesses, and in what manner they used to lay on hands. And this appears in
their writings to be sometimes, that men might receive the visible Gifts of the
Holy Ghost; as our Savior, to prepare his Apostles to receive the Holy Ghost,
breathed on them, and lift up his hands, and said, Receive, etc. Joh. 20.22.
Luke 24.5.
. So they prayed, and laid on their hands on Believers, that they might receive
the Holy Ghost Act. 8.15, 17, and 19.6.
: and sometimes they used this for miraculous curing and healing of Diseases
Mar. 6.5. and 8.22, 25. and 16.18. Luke 4.40. and 3.13. Act. 9.17. and 28.8.
: and sometime it was used for procuring special Blessings on men, Mat. 19.13,
15. Mar. 10.16. as of old, Genesis 48.14, 15, 16. and sometimes it was used for
Believers fitness and ability to preach the Gospel, 2 Timothy 1.6. as of old for
fitness and blessing in leading a people, Deuteronomy. 34.9. and sometime it was used
for setting men in Office in and for the Church, and for fitness and blessing
therein Act. 6.6. 1 Timothy 5.22.
: and sometime for fitness; and a blessing for Messengers sent by the Church
about Church Affairs Act. 13.3.
. And the manner of their laying on of hands was with prayer to God, for that
they desired for those on whom hands are to be laid Act. 8.15. and 28.8.
: in desire whereof, and confidence in God for his gracious Answer, they lift
up their hands to God 1 Timothy 2.8.
: whence Prayer is so named, lifting up the hands to God Psalm. 141.2.
and in Testimony of their desire and confidence in God for his gracious
answering, they laid on hand on the parties prayed for Act. 8.17. and 28.8.
. Such, and in such manner their laying on of hands.

2. The Doctrine of laying on of hands, it is that Doctrine or teaching of the
Gospel of Christ and him crucified, in which Believers are directed and
encouraged to pray for good things to God, with Promises of a gracious hearing,
that so they may pray, and lift up hearts and hands in confidence in God, and
lay on hands in Testimony thereof. And this being one of those Principles, that
by the Oracles of God were taught to all Believers of the Oblation of Christ,
it must needs be as common to all Saints, as the Faith of the Oblation of
Christ, and the Oracles proceeding from it, known and believed: and so it
cannot be meant of the act of laying on of hands, for giving and receiving the
visible Gifts of the Holy Ghost, for speaking with other Tongues; for such
laying on of hands, appears to be peculiar to the Apostles, and was not common
to all the first Witnesses. Act. 8.5.15, 17, and 19.6. 1 Cor. 14.22. and 12.29,
30. Ephesians. 4.7, 8, 13. Ephesians. 1.17. and 3.14, 17. Col. 3.9, 10. 1 These. 3.12. Ephesians.
6.19. 2 These. 3.1. 2 Timothy 1.6. Act. 6.6. 1 Timothy 5.22. Romans 15.30, 31. Act.
13.3. Jam. 5.14, 15, 16, 20.
Philip, though an Evangelist, and had the gift of working Miracles, and did
many, yet for this, the Church sent two Apostles, Peter and John: and so it was
an Apostle that laid on hands for this gift another time; and not this only,
but the gift of Miracles and miraculcus healing, though given to more then the
Apostles, yet not to all Saints, even in those first times, when Miracles were
most needful, till Christ had been fully taught, and Jesus proved to be he; nor
are these gifts affirmed to be of like continuation with other spiritual gifts:
so that, that which the Gospel in the Doctrine of laying on of hands, teaches,
that is of continual use for all Believers, is that here meant, and that is for
venting our desires by Prayer to God in the Name of Christ for his mercy and
free-favour through Christ to be given, in blessing with increase of, and
establishment in the Faith to Believers: and for fitting and furnishing such as
have the word of Grace in their heart, to preach the Gospel, and to bless their
Ministration: and for Believers approbation, fitness, faithfulness, and
blessing, that are chosen into Church-Offices; and for ability, faithfulness,
preservation and blessing for such as are sent and employed in Message or
business for the Church and Church Affairs; and for gracious support, and
helpfulness in, and seasonable deliverance out of any temptation, sickness,
affliction or distress, that any Believer is in, and suchlike: as for that
anointing with oil in the Name of the Lord mentioned, it appears to be taken
in a metaphorical and spiritual sense, because oil and anointing used of old,
was a type of the gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, Psa. 45.7. Isa. 61.1.
with which Christ was anointed immeasurably, and with which, he in the Gospel
anointeth Believers, which in Scripture is called oil and anointing; and
anointing with material oil, is neither commanded, nor anywhere in Scripture
mentioned to be done, much less set forth as an Ordinance, since Christ's
ascension into Heaven, and pouring forth the Holy Ghost; in which, Truth being
come, Types and Shadows cease; nor is it but once mentioned that I find while
he lived on earth, Mar. 6.13 Cant. 1.3. 1 John 2.20, 27, 28.
and that was when bodily cures by Miracles were most in use: but this is a
constant Truth, His Name is as an Ointment poured forth; and so those that
believe in him, are said to have received an unction from him; yea, an
anointing that teaches: and so to anoint those we pray over, with oil in the
Name of the Lord, Phil. 1.8, 9, 10, 11.
is in Faith and Charity fervently streaming, both in Prayers and speaking, so
to declare that Name in the Virtues of the Blood and Sacrifice of him, and the
Love of God appearing therein, with the reviving Instructions and Consolations
it affords, that the savor of his Ointments may refresh the heart. And this
to be the Apostles meaning, Jam. 5.16, 20.
appears in his own after-Explanation. So that the Prayer of Faith, and of the
Faithful is the chief Ordinance meant here, with lifting up the hands in
confidence to God, or also, with laying on of hands in Testimony of confidence
in God, Mat. 7.7, 11. Mar. 10.24. Joh. 16.23, 24.
he being a God hearing Prayers, which is the Doctrine of laying on of hands,
or that which the Gospel teaches concerning it; namely, the gracious Mind of
God, that in all our needs, we should by the Prayer of Faith and of the
Faithful, seek help of him; and that he will hear and help us graciously,
according to his word, Psalm. 64.5. And yet to clear it,

3. This is farther to be noted, That in Scripture Language, 1 Cor. 11.20, 23,
24, 28.
a whole Ordinance, in which are many particular Acts, is sometime called by
the name of one particular Act in it; as, The Supper of the Lord; in which is,
Blessing, Prayer, Instruction, Praise, taking and breaking Bread, and
distributing Wine; eating, drinking, and comemmorating the Death of Christ,
Act. 20.7. Act. 2.46.
etc. is called by the name of one particular Act in it, even, Breaking Bread.
When the Disciples came together to break Bread, Paul preached, etc. Yea,
sometime that one Act is named so, as to imply all the Ordinances Believers had
in Fellowship among themselves: and so the Temple of God, Isa. 56.7.
his House, where Sacrifices, Offerings, and burnt-Offerings, and all
Temple-worship was rightly used, and so there Accepted, is even therefore
called, The House of Prayer. And so this Ordinance of Prayer, in performance of
which, is Confession, Petition, Praise, with bowing the knee, lifting up the
eyes, the voice, the hands, and sometime laying on of hands, as it is sometime
called Prayer, sometime pouring out the heart, etc. so it is sometime named by
one particular Act in it: sometime by one, Ephesians. 3.14. 1 King 8.54. Psalm. 123.
Judge. 21.2. 2 Chronicles. 5.17. Act. 4.24. Joh. 7.27, 32, 33, 34. and 8.27.
sometime by another: sometime bowing the knees, sometime lifting up the eyes,
sometime lifting up the voice; but most frequently is the Ordinance of Prayer,
called by that Act in it, of lifting up the hands, Psalm. 8.2. When I lift up my
hands, etc. and Psalm. 63.4. While I live, I will lift up my hands in thy Name:
Yea, the whole great suffering, and so the Oblation and Sacrifice of Jesus
Christ, is sometime called and expressed by that one Act in it, of his being
lifted up, (from the Earth upon the Cross:) yea, likewise the whole preaching
of the Gospel, in which Christ, 1 Cor. 1.17, 18. Gal. 3.1. Joh. 3.14, 15.
and him crucified, is set forth, the Propitiation for our sins, is expressed by
that very term of lifting up: so our approach to God being through that Blood
and Sacrifice of his, Heb. 10.19, 20. is for that exercise of Prayer, often
called lifting up of hands, as Psalm. 134.2. and 141.2. Lam. 3.41. 1 Timothy 2.8.
and even so likewise, because when they prayed over any, or for any special
mercies for any, Act. 15.17. and 28.8.
they often did point out the parties, and testify their desires and
confidence for them, by touching them with, or laying their hands on them:
therefore, their so praying and blessing, is sometime expressed in that term
only of laying on of hands, as is clearly seen, in comparing Mar. 10.16. with
Mat. 19.13, 15. and so here laying on of hands chiefly and mainly implies and
signifies. The-Prayers of Believers, assembled and met together in the Name of
Christ, to desire some special favor and blessing of him; Mat. 19.18, 20. Joh.
10.23, 24.
to which he has promised, both his presence in the midst of them, and his
gracious Answers to them: in which Prayers of Believers there is most commonly
a lifting up (not only of the heart, but also) ^f the hands toward God: and
sometime, as confidence ^^given, a laying on of hands on parties prayed for, if
present. And so, when Believers have assembled together, and prayed in the Name
of Christ for any, though some particular outward Act were omitted at some
time, yet it being such an Act, as is sometimes done, and by which the
Ordinance of Prayer, in naming that act, is known, yea, often named by it, and
known by that Expression to be done, it may be then so called and expressed in
either of those terms, either lifting up, or laying on of hands; either, and
both, importing praying for, or over those prayed for, as appears in Jam. 5.14,
20. where the same business is mentioned, and not laying on of hands, but
Prayer with instruction (in a metaphorical term.) And so much for Scripture-Use
of the words, lifting up, or laying on of hands: in all that is said, minding
this, That the Principle here is not expressed barely in laying on of hands, but
in the Doctrine of laying on of hands.

4. For the Principle it self that is taught to, Principle 4.
and received of Believers in this Doctrine of laying on of hands, it appears
by Scripture to be, A right persuasion of God, concerning his infinite Love,
Mercy, Truth and Faithfulness in and through Christ, to hear and answer the
Prayers of such as approach to him through Christ, and call upon him in his
Name; in and with this persuasion, to have the heart suitably inclined, not
only ones self so to pray to God, and wait for his answer, but to desire and
expect a blessing in the prayers of such as believe in Christ.

Such the persuasion of the Prophet by the Spirit, That God is a hearer of
Prayers, and that they that by his gracious choosing, are led to approach to
him, and dwell in his Courts, are blessed, and shall be satisfied Psalm. 65.2, 4.
. And thus the Apostle that used to lay on hands, was persuaded of blessing,
through the Prayers of Believers, and the supply of the Spirit, etc. Phil. 1.19.
. Whence also he so earnestly desired the Prayer of Believers for himself Romans
15.30, 31. Ephesians. 6.19.
. and both for himself and his Fellow Laborers with him Col. 4.2, 3. Heb.
13.18.
. Satan's ordinary way in beginning to withdraw Believers from Christ, being to
steal this persuasion (or Principle) out of their heart, and so drawing them to
forsaking the assemblings of the Saints together, for that end Heb. 10.22, 25,
26. Jude 19, 20.
. And in this Principle (or persuasion in the heart of a Believer, note, 1.
That it is begotten by the Oracles of the Propitiatory or mercy-Seat, Ephesians. 2.1,
618. Heb. 9.24. and 10.19, 20. and 13.15, 18. 1 John 2.1, 2.
and founded upon the foundation of the Oblation and Sacrifice of Jesus Christ,
by virtue whereof he now appears in heaven for us. This the ground of all our
boldness to pray for our selves or others and so of all our hope in God for
hearing believers for us. 2. That this Principle, Phil. 116.2, 4, 5, 6, 10.
Romans 5.2. and 10.14. 1 Ioh. 2.1, 2. and 5.13, 14, 15, 19, 20.
as it flows from the foundation, and springs up with Repentance and Faith; so
it is found in them, that through believing in Christ crucified, have repented
of dead works, and do believe in Christ, and are in some measure conformed to
him, in being baptized into his death, Isa. 1.13.14, 15. Psalm. 50.15.16. 3.
That this Principle in the heart of a Believer, Phil. 4.6, 7. 1 These. 5.17, 18.
Heb. 13.18. Phil. 1.19. Ephesians. 6.19. Act. 6.6. and 13.1, 2, 3. and 15.40. Psa.
26.8. and 27.4. Heb. 10.25.
frames him to begin with God in seeking his blessing by Prayer in all
distresses and enterptizes, and so to desire the Prayers of such as believe in
Christ, with expectation of a blessing therein; and so in oppressing distress,
and for special Offices and Services in and for the Church, so far to desire
this laying on of hands, as to desire their Prayers, Blessing, and Approbation,
in seeking the Lord for him, and commending him to the Lord, and the word of
his Grace, for help and blessing in the same: and likewise to desire and
delight to be much in the assembly of Believers met in his Name. And this the
Principle begot in the Hearts of Believers by the Oracles of God in the
Doctrine of laying on of hands.


CHAP. 8.
Of Hebrews 6.2.

HEb. 6.2. And of Resurrection of the dead. This appears by the connection of
the words, and as the Principle taught, to be the Doctrine of Resurrection of
the dead: for understanding whereof, we have three things to consider, viz.

1. What the Resurrection of the dead is, that is here meant; Heb. 9.27. Joh.
5.28, 29.
and that appears in the very words to be a Resurrection of those that once
before lived, and are now dead, but shall be raised and made alive again to
receive the eternal Judgment, which is after death and this Resurrection;
which minded, this Resurrection appears not to be a metaphorical Resurrection,
Psa. 18. and 31.32. and 116.1, 12. 2 Timothy 2.7, 10. Act. 17.26. Genesis 4.1, 2, 3.
Joh 10.9, 12. Joh. 5.23.
in bringing such as were once in a healthful, rich, honorable and comfortable
condition in this life, and now in deep poverty and distress, unto their former
healthful and comfortable estate and condition again in this life; which is
sometimes, though the hope of such a thing, so far as is for good, is raised
from the belief of this mentioned, (whence the Metaphor:) yet this is not it:
nor is it that surrection or quickening and giving life where none was before,
whether in the natural and first birth of a man, or in the new birth, (that is
spiritual) in the Souls of Believers, who, though before in that respect dead,
yet in that respect they were never alive before, and so not a resurrection,
though a surrection and live-making, Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Col. 1.13. But it is
evident, the Resurrection here meant, is of the Body, that once was alive, but
(...) dead, and gone from among the living, in raising and making alive again
that very Body: This appears clearly to be that Resurrection the Sadduces
denied; Mar. 2.18, 27. Luke 20.27, 38. Act. 17.18, 31. 2 Timothy 2.18. 1 Cor.
15.12. Joh. 5.28, 29. 1 Cor. 15.3, 4, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 54.
for which our Savior said, They erred, not knowing the Scripture, nor the
power of God, Mat. 22.23-32. This that Resurrection the Heathen Philosophers
scoffed at: This that which the Apostates and false Teachers craftily and
hiddenly denying, fancied into an Allegorical and Metaphorical Resurrection,
saying, It was already past with them; and so overthrew the Faith of some: by
which seducements, some among the Corinthians fell to doubt of, and deny this
Resurrection, the Resurrection of the Body, which is the Resurrection taught by
our Savior Christ, and by the Apostle in 1 Cor. 15. proving from the
Resurrection of the body of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and shows
the order and several times of the Resurrection of dead Bodies: first, Christ
the first Fruits; then they that are Christ's at his coming again; and after the
wicked at his delivering up the Kingdom to the Father, and giving the total
overthrow to death; and then affirming, That the very individual Bodies that
died shall rise again; that very thing, it, that was sown or laid and covered
in the earth, in corruption, dishonor and weakness, shall be raised again, even
it, that very thing, raised in incorruption, glory and power: 1 Cor. 15 42, 43,
44. 1 These. 4 14, 15, 16, 17. Joh. 11.24 Act. 23.6. and 24.15. 1 Cor. 15.21,
22. Luke 14.14. Rev. 20.5, 6, 12, 13.
and so affirming the same to the Thessalonians, even of them that sleep in
Christ, and are dead from among men. And this Resurrection has been believed,
confessed and hoped for by all that believed the Testimony of Jesus: so that in
the last day, all the bodies of Men that are dead, shall be raised by Christ:
the Just in that beginning of the day, to receive rewards; and the unjust at
the end of the day, to receive the terrible sentence, of which enough has been
said. And this the Resurrection meant.

2. What the Doctrine of Resurrection of the dead is: And this also may be
clearly seen in the Scripture to be, 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. 1 Timothy 2.7. Romans 14.8, 9.
1 Cor. 15.3, 4. Rev. 1.18. Joh. 11.25. and 5.28, 29. and 12.32, 33. Phil. 2.7,
8, 9, 10, 11. 1 These. 4.15, 16. Isa. 26.19. Romans 14.9, 12. and 5.24, 25. Act.
17.31. 1 Samuel 2.6. Hos. 6.1, 2. Psa. 90.3. Heb. 13.20, 21. 2 Timothy 2.3. Rev.
1.18, 19. Romans 4.24, 25. and 5.8, 10. 1 Pet. 1.3. 2 Cor. 1.9, 10. and 4.11, 14
Prove. 3.21, 26. and 24.20. Phil. 3.7, 8, 9, 10. 2 Cor. 12.9, 10. Romans 6.3,
4.11. and 8.17. 2 Timothy 2.11, 12. Joh. 13.15. Heb. 11.13.
that Jesus Christ as the public Man that died for all Men, for their sins,
and gave himself a Ransom for all, that he might have them both living and
dead in his dispose, he is risen from the dead and alive for evermore, the Lord
of all; and that by virtue of this his Resurrection and victory over death, and
Sacrifice offered, and Power received, He is the Resurrection and the Life, and
will raise all men, and bring them before him to acknowledge him Lord: the
just, in that Union with him, in which, they (...) the unjust, in that
Relation, in which they are obliged to acknowledge him Lord, and that in the
Resurrection of Christ from the dead, and therein overcoming death, and
assuring the Resurrection of the dead, is demonstrated and made known to be
believed, the Righteousness of God, and his infinite power and faithfulness, to
do all things, to fulfill his word, even to kill and make alive again; to send
down to destruction, and return again; and so to uphold, help and deliver in
the greatest distresses and death: and that such as believe in Christ, that as
the public Man is risen from the dead, and alive for evermore, may be quickened
to a living hope, to be saved and preserved by him to the heavenly inheritance
and eternal life through Faith: and so to depend on him for such supports and
deliverances in greatest temptations and distresses, as is truly good for them:
and also, that in this confidence in him that raises the dead, they may be
kept from fainting in the day of adversity, and so be made willing to be made
like Christ in the fellowship of his sufferings, and in deaths, knowing his
strength is manifested in our weaknesses; and, that as we are conformed to him
in his death, so we shall likewise also be, to the likeness of his
Resurrection: If we suffer with him, we shall reign; if we die, we shall live,
he being the Resurrection and the Life; so, as thus believing in him, as risen
from the dead, we may persevere, and live and die in the Faith; and such thing:
are taught by the Oracles of God in the Doctrine of the Resurrection from the
dead, or of the dead.

3. What the Principle is, Principle 5.
that is by the Doctrine of Resurrection of the dead, taught to, and received
in the believing heart: that appears to be, Such an inward persuasion, and
belief of, 1 These. 4.14, 15, 17. 1 Pet. 1.3. Romans 4.24. and 5.8, 10. Phil. 3.7,
8, 9. Romans 6.3, 4, 5, 6. 2 Cor. 4.10, 14. Romans 6.4. and 7.6. Heb. 11.13.
and in Jesus Christ risen from the dead, as makes confident in him for
preservation through all sufferings and death, and raising out of death at his
coming, to enjoy the inheritance and eternal life: so, as it frames to a
willingness to be conformed to Christ in his death, that one may partake of the
virtue of his Resurrection, believing that, according to our dying with him,
and for him, we shall be more abundantly quickened and enlived by him and live
with him by the power of God: whence issues that desire and hope of the virtue
of his Resurrection, for newness of life, and perseverance in the Faith, even
to the death, and dying in the Faith, to rise to everlasting life.

And in this Principle also are three things clearly observable, viz. 1. That
it is founded upon, Romans 8.32, 39. and 5.8, 10.
and produced by the Oblation of Christ believed, in his Death, Resurrection,
and Sacrifice offered for us: by virtue whereof, he ever lives to intercede
for us, and will come again and raise us. 2. That this Principle is only in
those that through believing in Christ, and him crucified, Romans 5.1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6. 2 Timothy 1.9, 10, 11, 12.
have been framed to Repentance from dead works, and to Faith toward God, and
therein to some conformity to Christ in his death, and confidence in him for
his Promises, of which some experiments in answer of Prayers they have found.
3. That this Principle inclines the heart to live by Faith in all conditions,
and so to walk in the strength of the Lord, Gal. 2.20, 21. and 5.5.
2 Cor. 4.13. Phil. 4.4, 11, 13. 2 Cor. 1.9, 10. And this is the Principle
begot in the heart by the Doctrine of Resurrection, etc.


CHAP. 9.
Of Hebrews 6.2, 3.

HEb 6.2. And of eternal judgment. This also by the connection of the words,
appears to be the Doctrine of eternal Judgment; and it also appears, in that
it is coupled and mentioned after the Resurrection of the dead, to be that
Judgment which shall be after men have died in their Bodies, and are raised
and made alive again, according to that said, As it is appointed to men, once
to die; and after this, the judgment: to which Judgment, Heb. 9.27. Joh.
5.27, 28, 29. 2 Cor. 5.10. Romans 2.16. Jude 14, 15.
by the voice of Christ, All that are in their Graves shall come forth and
appear before his Judgment Seat, and be judged by him: of this our Savior
warns us, Luke 12.4, 5. and 21.34. as did the Preacher of old, Eccles. 11.9.
and 12.14. and the Apostles since, 1 Pet. 4.5. 2 Timothy 4.1. As for the word
Judgment, it is used, sometime for a right discerning and estimate of Men or
things, as they are good and bad; sometime, for Authority, Order and Rule
given; sometime, for giving sentence, and causing the execution of that
sentence; and in this sense directly, with inclusion of both the former, it is
meant here: and so in this Judgment, 2 Timothy 2.10 Heb. 9.15. Mar. 3.29. Rev.
21.8.
some shall be sentenced to, and possessed of an eternal inheritance with
eternal glory; and some sentenced to eternal damnation, and cast into eternal
fire: of both which, are spoken at large, Mat. 25.31, to 46. And this Judgment
is called Eternal, because the sentence passed, shall never be reversed; nor
the thing sentenced ever be removed; nor they on whom the sentence passed, ever
cease to be; but shall remain for ever, in everlasting joy, or torment,
according to the sentence and judgment given forth, and passed on them: and so
the Doctrine of Eternal Judgment, or that which is in the Gospel by the
Oracles of God, taught concerning it, has these Instructions in it: that is to
say,

1. That there are some judgments both in sentence and execution in this life,
^ccles. 9.1, 5.
both in mercies and corrections, in destructions and deliverances, and
salvations, which are but for a time, and dure not for ever; by which also,
Romans 2.4. Joh. 33.29, 30.
special love or positive hatred are not demonstrated: of which I have no cause
here to speak any more but this. That they both are used in this Day of Grace,
to lead men to Repentance and turning unto the Lord.

2. That according to the Word of the Lord, and in the Ministration thereof, a
sentence of Life or a sentence of Death may pass on a Man in this Life; and yet
it may so come to pass, that without any alteration of the Mind and Purpose of
God, the sentence may be so changed, as the execution shall not be on that Man
on whom it was denounced; according to that 1 Samuel 2.30. And so the Lord has
explained his Mind to be, Jer. 18.7, 19. That when the sentence of death is
given out against any, if thereby they be smitten, and turn from the evil
against which it was given forth, God will take away the threatened evil: And
when a sentence of life and good passes on a man, if he take liberty to go on
to do evil, the Lord will take away the good he said he would do unto them. And
so again he says, Ezekiel. 33.13, 14.
When he says to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his
own righteousness, and commit iniquity all his righteousness shall not be
mentioned to him; but for his iniquity, etc. he shall surely die: and likewise
when he says to the wicked, Thou shall surely die; if he turn from his sin,
and do that which is lawful. etc. he shall surely live, he shall not die. And
all this grounded upon this, Ezekiel. 33.10, 11. and 18.30, 31, 32.
That God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn
from his way, and live. And therefore he calls and promises, and threatens,
and correct; and uses means that they might turn and live: and on the same
ground, and from the same, and like places, Romans 9.19, 20, 21. to chapter 10. and
11.7, 10, 17, 23, 11, 14, 32.
the Apostles have taught the same Dectrine to Believers, warning the believing
Gentiles that were grafted into the true Olive Tree, and partook of the fatness
of it, That if they abode not in his goodness, they also should be cut off: and
tells them also, That the reprobated Jews, the branches broken off, if they
persisted not still in unbelief, they shall be grafted in again^ for God is
able to graft them in again; yea, his mercy shown to the Gentiles, has such an
end and tendency in it; yea, he has concluded all under unbelief, that he
might have mercy on all etc.

3. That though through continuance in wilful Rebellion against light, and many
covincements and warnings, a Man may come to that height of sin, Prove. 1.24,
25, 31. Jer. 6.27, 28, 30. Ezekiel. 24.13, 14. Mar. 3.29.
even in this life, as to be reprobated and given up to Satan, and so left to
that eternal Judgment yet to come; yet that is so hardly discernable to any in
this life, that it is not safe for us to judge farther of such, then that they
are in danger of eternal damnation; for though such transgression shall not be
so forgiven, but that it shall be verily and remarkably punished; yet, if by
the means used, with all punishments, they be regained to repentance, the soul
may be saved in the day of the Lord. Whence we are not absolutely forbidden to
pray for such a one; 1 John 5.16.
but that we pray not for such a transgression to be forgiven and taken away,
so as all punishment be removed; for of necessity that must be visibly and
sorely punished here or hereafter: 1 Cor. 5.5. 1 Timothy 1.20.
whence the delivery of such a one to Satan, has such an end and tendency,
while means and life is continued, to destroy the flesh, that the Spirit may be
saved in the day of the Lord; for while life and means is vouchsafed, there is
hope; for the end of Christ his first coming and Ministration of the Gospel,
Eccles. 9.1, 2, 3, 4. Joh. 3.17. and 5.34. and 12.47, 48. Act. 3.26, and 26.18.
1 Timothy 1.15.
was not to judge with that judgment, to condemn the world to that eternal
damnation, but to save the world; yea, such as at present rejected his words,
waiting their conversion, letting that judgment alone till the last day: and
the same is his end in the Ministration of his Servants. Therefore it is not
good nor safe for us to be peremptory in judging that Judgment, before the
time of the Lord's coming; if not that 1 Cor. 4, 5. much less this, for eternal
Judgment is after death, and it appertains then also to the Lord to pass it:
that is next.

4. That the great and eternal judgment, is after death, and the Resurrection
of the Body; and the Judgment then given, will be altogether irrevocable, in
respect of the persons on whom given; the sentence then unalterable, and the
execution accordingly, will be eternal, Deuteronomy. 22.30. Luke 20.36. Rev. 20.15,
18, 21. Mat. 25.46.
and so expressly called an eternal judgment; there is then no more possibility
of sinning or falling, for those then sentenced to eternal life; they are then
as the Angels of God: nor is there then any more time for, or possiblity of
Repentance, or escape for those sentenced to the second death; they are then
as, and with the Devil and his Angels. And these things, the Oracles of God in
the Doctrine of eternal judgment, teaches: by all which we may learn, what
the Principle it teaches Believers, and they receive in the belief hereof, is;
namely, that it is, An inward and hearty persuasion and minding of the future,
unseen. spiritual and eternal things, Principle 6.
the eternal judgment of God: and therein, Romans 8.17, 24. 2 Cor. 4.16, 17, 18.
and 5.3, 10. Heb. 11.13, 16, 25. Col. 3.1, 4. 2 Timothy 4.8. 1 Thessalonians. 1.9, 10.
Rev. 22.16, 20.
the eternal estate of men: in which Believers that suffer for Christ's sake in
the flesh here, shall be for ever blessed with all fullness of glorious joy and
blessing; and all their enemies for ever overthrown, and punished with eternal
torment: in which persuasion, and minding of these unseen and eternal things,
their afflictions become light and bearable to them, their hearts cheered,
comforted, and strengthened and set on things above; so, as longing for this
heavenly state, they are bent with desire and endeavor in all things to please
God, and so to long and wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus in glory.

The Foundation of this persuasion and Principle, Heb. 9.2, 8. and 7.25. 1 Cor.
1.5, 6, 7, 8. 1 Thessalonians. 1.4, 5, 6, 10.
that which produces it, and on which it is built, is, as of all the former,
the Oblation of Jesus Christ, in his Death, Resurrection, and Sacrifice
offered, and by virtue thereof, sitting on the Right Hand of God, mediating
till he come again. And they in whom this persuasion and principle is, are such
as in whom Christ is spiritually in some measure formed, even so far, as that
from the belief and knowledge of Jesus Christ, and him erucified, all the
forementioned Principles are in a gracious measure in them; and so with them
this also: By all which they are framed, both with desites and patience, to
expect, and in well-doing to wait for the coming of the Lord.

And these be the six Principles, called, Heb. 5.12.
The first Principles of the Oracles of God, that flow from the Foundation, and
teach these Principles by it, and build them on it, and therethrough builds the
Believers on Christ the Foundation, and frames them to the Mind of Christ, and
so leads them. The first two, which are Repentance from dead works, and Faith
toward God, being those in which working, the Believer is taken out from his
estimate of himself and the world, and the flesh, with affections and lufts
thereof crucified, and he drawn to high estimates of Christ, and by Faith and
Love united to him. The second two, that is, the Doctrine of Baptisms, and of
laying on of hands, be those in which the Believer is formed more and more to
Christ, in fellowship with him, and conformity to him in his death, and
likewise in the spiritual virtue of his Resurrection, with enjoyment and
experiments of his goodness in his Promises. The third two, that is, the
Doctine of Resurrection of the dead, and of eternal Judgment, be those in
which the Believer is quickened up in hope of eternal life and inheritance, and
encouraged with constancy and patience to expect and wait for the coming of
Christ, then to enjoy all the good promised. All these mentioned, he says,
Heb. 6.3. And this will we do, if God permit: as if one should say. We having
formerly taught, and laid the Foundation among you, and therein taught the
Oracles of God unto you, which you have heard, and known, and believed, and
therein learned and received the first Principles thereof: And we having now
mentioned those first Principles of the Oracles of God, begotten in you by the
Oracles of God in your belief of the Testimony of Christ; This we will do, that
is, even the same foresaid; that is, in our writing to you, leave, and let
remain these things with you and in you, 1 Cor. 15.1, 2, 3, 4.
as things we are persuaded you have and retain; and in believing remembrance
of the Oblation of Christ whence all sprang you shall be saved. But now not
staying to declare again what the Foundation is, and which be those Oracles of
God, or to open these first Principles thereof, we will proceed to perfection,
in opening more fully to you the Ends, Excellencies, Virtues, and Usefulness of
the Oblation of Christ in his remaining Priesthood, in his Mediation and
Intercession by virtue thereof, thereby to stir up in you these Principles you
have already received in believing on him, that you may be farther builded on
him, 1 Pet. 2.2, 3, 4, 5, 9.
and have more usefulness of your knowledge of Jesus Christ for union and
fellowship with him, and conformity and fruitfulness to him; and God permitting
us, this we will assay and endeavor to do, and that upon very weighty reason
and grounds, because you having received so much as gives us encouragement; and
if any receiving so much, should have clean departed, our labor would be in
vain to them; but not judging you such, we will not on a surmise, desist.

CHAP. X.
Heb. 6.4, 5.

FOr it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, Heb. 6.4, 5.
and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy
Ghost; and have tasted the good word of God; if they fall away, to renew, etc.
For those, Such as once had what these have, but are now fallen off, etc. So
that I shall note in these two and the following verses, only these things. 1.
That all this faith and principles in these Hebrews, was neither acquired, nor
humane notions and motions, but the work of the holy spirit, affording
spiritual operations. 2 That those that fall away from Christ, when they have
so known him, it is impossible to renew them, etc. 3 The reason of that
impossibility. 1 For the first of these, It is evidenced in so many operations
of the Spirit, as he had formerly mentioned principles. Verse. 4, 5
And so he says who were once, that is, those fallen, if any such should be
among them; which he will not say are, but wherever they are, they once were,
as those written to are (and not only were) seeing they retain it, they are.

1 They were enlightened: whence he bids them call to remembrance, the former
days in which they were illuminated, Psalm. 36.9. John 1.9, 12 Ephesians. 5.14 Psalm
19.8 and 119.130 Prove. 6.23 2 Pet. 1.19 2 Cor. 4.6 Ephesians. 1.17, 18 and 5, 13 John
16.7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Prove. 1.23 Acts 26.18 1 Pet. 2.9.
Chap. 10.32. The Scripture shows, the fountain of this light and inlightening,
to be Christ in the appearance, and discovery of whom, Gods gracious mind
appears, the medium and instrument, bringing it and opening the eyes. Is the
Testimony of Christ, the Gospel, the command or word of grace, the light
entering, that which opens the understanding enlighteneth the heart, and
enableth it to discern; Is the holy Spirit coming forth from Christ, in and
through the Gospel, with divine and supernatural light and inspiration to the
mind and heart. The first effect of this inlightening is, convincement of sin,
of righteousness, and judgment, etc. And where any receive this reproof, and
by the light and strength of it, turn to the Lord, repentance from dead works
is wrought, and such are brought out of darkness into his mavelous light:
And so lively and evangelicall and effecatious was their repentance, with such
spiritual illumination from Christ by his spirit, with his word.

2 And have tasted of the heavenly gift (the fallen had, and these writ too
both had, and in some measure still did, though through their dullness, the
edge of their appetite, and liveliness of relishing in their Palate, had some
abatement, whence the Apostles discovery of fears, Chap. 3, 4, 5, 6.
and setting forth such danger, and giving such warning, are intermixed, to
quicken up the same again: for, they have tasted, and have yet an appetite to
be quickened) Now the word Tasting, in this business appears to be, both
eating, feeding, savouring, and relishing, and discerning the goodness, and
pleasantness, of that is eaten or tasted. And so the word Tasting in Natural
things is put for eating and feeding, 2 Samuel 3.35. Jonah 3.7. And for
discerning and relishing, 2 Samuel 19.35. Job. 6, 6. and 12, 11. Ioh. 2.9, 10.
And so for spirituals, when the words of God are received into and laid up in
the heart as food. They prove sweeter than honey to the taste; Job. 23.12.
Psalm. 119. 103, 104. and 34.8 Cant. 2.3
whence when men are exhorted to make trial of the goodness of the Lord by
trusting in him, they are bidden to taste and see, that the Lord is gracious:
And the Church professes his fruit sweet unto her taste, etc. of which tasting
Peter speaks, 1 Pet. 2.2, 3. and so this Apostle here, for there is no other
sense of tasting, in this business given us in Scripture. For the thing
tasted, that is in some measure eat and drunk of, and the sweet savor
relished, that is, express to be the heavenly gift. The same by which that
principle called faith toward God was affected, and with which it closed, and
that is no other but Christ: The oblation of Christ, the flesh and blood of
Christ, Jesus Christ as he has suffered for our sins, and offered himself a
sacrifice to God for us, and so filled with spirit to send forth to us, and in
the Gospel set forth, the propitiation for our sins, wisdom, John 6.35, 48 50,
51. and 3, 16, 17. and 4, 10 Isa. 9.6. Acts 3.26. Gal. 3.1. John 6.32 Romans 8.32
John 1.12 1 John 5.11, 12 John. 6.51 52.64.
righteousness, sanctification, and redemption for us, and the mediator
between God and us, so he, so as the true bread of life which came down from
heaven, and which God so graciously, and for so gracious an end has given; the
gift of God, the heavenly gift; And which in the Ministry of the Gospel he
sends, tendereth and gives, yea, and no other gives he, for any to feed on
but this true bread of life. And in giving him, will with him give all things
that are good, and in believing on his name, he is received, and in, with, and
from himself, and in exercise of faith in receiving the grace that flows
through him, and so resting on him, and taking latislying, 1 Pet. 2.2, 3, 4, 5
and well preasednesse in him; And in that he has done, and is become, and
does and will do, men do eat of his flesh, and drink of his blood: And so
tasting the graciousnesse of the Lord, are by him more inlived, and bunt upon
him: And such the tasting here meant of the heavenly gift, Gal. 4.15. and 5 2,
4. 2 Pet. 1.9
by which that principle of faith toward God was wrought, in exercise of which
faith also is still the tasting of the heavenly gift. As for those fallen away,
they did once taste of the heavenly gift and then it was precious to them, and
of high esteem with them, John. 6.29, 37, 47, 51, 54, 56, 58.
though now having crucified it; it is of no effect with them. And our Savior
says, not he that once came, that once believed, that has once eaten, but he
that comes, that believes, that eats; as speaking of a present, and
continued act, Heb. 3.1.6, 7, 13, 14, 15 1 Pet. 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
which was not in those fallen ones: But in those writ too it was, they did
still in some measure eat, and so taste and relish: for they had the rejoicing
of hope, and the beginning of confidence, which they are exhorted in believing,
still to hold fast, even on like ground, as Peter exhorted those new born babes
that tasted, To whom he wrote: And so the principle of faith toward God; Being
produced through the righteousness of God, and our Savior Jesus Christ, which
is manifested in and through the oblation of Christ, and being also built upon
Christ the foundation, accompanied with such spiritual operation, affording
such tastes of goodness in the heavenly gift. It is for the kind of it, 2 Pet.
1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10
the same precious faith the Apostles had: And so Peter affirms it to the
Believers, giving them the same warning, in case of the loss of those tastes
and relishings, which the Apostle does here: so the faith; the same of the same
kind, I say not of the same degree and measure for growth and establishment:
yea the drift of the Apostle was to lead them to farther growth and
establishment in this Faith, not to another faith.

3 And were made partakers of the Holy Ghost: This as suited to the principle of
the Doctrine of Baptisms; declares its own meaning to be, not only of those
virtues and springs of love, joy, peace, etc. Gal. 5.22. effected by the Holy
Ghost in the spirit of Believers, but also together therewith, certain
spiritual gifts, Ephesians. 4.7.
and operations, for usefulness, whereof to every Believer is given, some in
some measure: And so these in being baptized in to the death of Christ (by all
the mediums, with water, word, afflictions, and spirit extended to them) they
did also partake of the virtue of his resurrection, so as they were also
therein endued with such spiritual gifts as whereby they were enabled in
exercise of faith and love; to speak spiritually, in prayer, and praises to
God, and spiritually and profitably in instruction, admonition, exhortation,
and consolation to men; as appears in comparing the Promise, Act. 2.38, 39. and
11, 15, 16, 17. and Romans 6.4, 5, 6. with the performance to believers, 1 Cor.
1.4, 5, 6, 7. And not to every one the same useful gifts, or the same measure
in the gifts given, but to some one, to some another, to some more, to some
less; Ephe. 4.7.8. -- 12, 14, 15, 16. 1 Cor. 12.2, 4, 5, 6, 7 -- 11. 2 Pet.
1.8. 2 Timothy 2.21. Romans 12.3, 6, 7, 8. 1 Pet. 4.10, 11. Col. 2.18. 1 Timothy 3.6.
And so to every one some, according to the measure of the gift of Christ, in
and with which they were fitted to be fruitful, and in exercise of the same
in faith and love according to their measure, and the divine virtues in them;
they should neither be barren, nor unfruitful in the knowledge of Christ, but
Vessels serviceable for their Masters use in the House of God: Whence Believers
are directed in all their speaking, and use of spiritual gifts; To keep this
Rule in going forth according to the proportion of faith given them, and the
measure of spiritual gifts givenand received by them. 1 Cor. 12.7. and 1, 5,
6, 7. 1 These. 5.8.
He that by any other acquired knowledge or learning, presumes to speak
besides or beyond this Rule; is like to fall into the condemnation of the
Devil, that was not content with his place. These spiritual gifts, being
given to profit withal, and tending to open and confirm the Testimony of
Christ: And as of the Romans ability through these gifts, Romans 15.14, 15.
so of these Hebrews. He was persuaded, they were also, and not like the
fallen ones that had deprived themselves thereof, but these retainings were
capable of that he endeavored, even to lead them to farther usefulness and
fruitfullness; They were made partakers of the Holy Ghost.

4 Verse. 5. And have tasted of the good word of God: And this also suited to
the Principle of laying on of hands; shows its own meaning to be, Mat. 7.7. --
11. Ioh. 16.23, 24.
that whereas God by his Son had graciously promised, to hear their prayers put
forth in the name of his Son, and to give them his good Spirit, and every good
thing they should and did so ask of him: And this in special manner, for
things of nearest and greatest concernment: When two or three of them did
assemble together in his name, and desired any favor of him; Mat. 18.19, 20
He will be in the midst of them, and it shall be done in Heaven for them;
They had tasted, that is, found sweetness and refreshing in experiments of his
truth, mercy and goodness, in answering their prayers, Psalm. 65.2.4. and 18.6,
7. and 10.3.1-10.
and manifesting his gracious presence in the assembly of his people, in
performing his promises, when they have prayed, and in confidence lift up hands
to him, and sometime in that confidence, Act. 21.24-3^.
as a testimony of it, laid hands on parties prayed for: And so have had
experience of the graciousness of the Lord, in his pity toward them, and of
his truth in his promises, and of his infinite love, power and faithfullness in
hearing of prayers: and so not executing deserved threats, but freely
performing his promises of good (whence called the good Word) unto them. And
how this does comfort, sweeten, enlarge and oblige the heart to cleave to God,
and continually to love and call on him; Psalm. 17.4.
and keep to the assembly of the Saints, is fully professed by the Prophet in
the whole 116 Psalm, and else where. And in this was set out the greatness of
Solomon's sin, 1 King. ^1.9.
That he departed from following the Lord that had in such evident manner
appeared to him twice: And this shows the greatness of the sin of those fallen,
in forsaking the assemblies of the Saints, Heb. 10.25, 26.
and crucifying to themselves, him from whom they had tasted so much of his
graciousness in performing his promises; and hearing the prayers, and blessing
the assemblies of Believers; And therein shows the great encouragement and
obligation these Hebrews had to continue in their faith, Heb. 10.19, 20, 22,
23, 24, 25.
and fellowship, and approaching to God, and provoking one another to love, and
good works, having had so many experiments of the graciousness of the Lord. His
drift being to stir them up more hereto, in that he has farther to say to
them; who have tasted of the good Word of God, Heb. 6.5.
and of the powers of the World to come: This Word being in the Plural Number.
The powers of the World to come: does suit this sentence, to the two last
Principles. That is the Doctrine of the Resurrection of the dead, and of
eternal Judgment. Both being grounded on the Resurrection of Christ, and his
coming again, and both, the Resurrection of the dead, which is first, and the
eternal Judgment which follows that Resurrection, appertaining to, and to be
done, not in the time of the World that now is, but in the World to come, at
and after the visible appearing of Jesus Christ; so that of the powers in the
Doctrine of both these, and the spiritual efficacies of both these in that
Doctrine believed, and of the power of the Spirit, that in that Doctrine does in
some measure present or show them to the view of faith, and assertain their
being really done in the due time, of these powers, of both these, he
speaks, and of the same say they have tasted, that is, they have discerned,
savoured, relished, and experimented the efficaciousness of the Divine Power by
which these shall be effected: 1. In their new birth, even when they were dead
in sins, Ephesians. 1.19, 20. and 2, 4, 5, 6. Romans 7.9.24, 25.
cast by the sentence of the Law, when sin accused, and all their righteousness
failed, and despair of all hope in themselves ceised on them; And while they
were in so great blindness and death: The Power of this grace in the Doctrine of
Christ raised from the dead, 2 Timothy 1.7, 8. Romans 7.6. and 8, 10, 11.
and being the raiser of men, quickened and enlived them. 2. In receiving from
Christ into their heart, an inward living Principle or Spirit of Faith and
Life; Gal. 5.22, 23, 24.
That without an outward enforcement from law or fears, or thoughts of
acquiring self-advantages; does from the grace believed, and hope received
spring up love, joy, childelike affections: 2 Cor. 1.8, 9, 10. 2 Timothy 4.17, 18
and so lead to serve in newness of spirit and life. 3 Since they were
quickened in believing. In raising them out of great deaths, Phil. 3.9.14. Heb.
11.25, 26. Psalm. 37.
in distresses and temptations; in which all seen hopes of help were removed,
and so far the sentence of death was passed on them; yet he delivered and
consolated them. 4 In enabling them with willingness to be conformed to Christ
in his death, and so to pass through deaths for Christ's sake, and to bear with
patience, the wrongs and oppressions of the wicked, knowing the certainty of
the Resurrection, and of eternal Judgment. 5 In elivating the Affections to
things above; Col. 3.1.4. 1 These. 1.10. Tit. 2.14.
where Christ is. And so moving to hope, and long, and wait for the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and the blessed hope and inheritance then to be given
by him in the resurrection of the just, as is shown in opening the two last
Principles: Now then put all said in these first five verses together of the
Principles with the spiritual operations. And mind how Jesus Christ in his
oblation is the foundation of all; and the oracles of God in discovery of that
foundation; And those oracles the teacher of these Principles, and the holy
Spirit of God in this teaching, the enlightener of the mind, and worker of
these Principles in the heart, and there through building the Believer on the
same foundation from whence all these flow, and so having effected in them
repentance from dead works, faith toward God, and such tasks of the heavenly
gift, conforming to Christ in his death, enduing with spiritual virtues and
gifts; affording experience of Gods graciousness in performing his Promises,
with a principle of life in the beginning of confidence, to live to God, and
wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Surely, surely in all this is
set forth, True Faith and Holiness of the right kind; even saving and
justifying, and here set forth in a great degree and measure also. And this the
very same-faith that was in these Hebrews to whom this Epistle was written,
whom he owneth as holy Brethren.


And yet notwithstanding all this; He by the same Spirit warns them to fly
all those evils that endanger to departing from this faith, and such
Principles in which they were fastened on such a foundation, where they had so
great salvation, and such a blessed hope; and so warns them of the great danger
in case of forgetfullness, Heb. 2.1, 2, 3. Heb. 3.6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 16-19. Heb.
4.1.
and neglect of so great salvaation: And to avoid that danger; by holding fast
the rejoicing of hope, and beginning of confidence, begot in them, firm to the
end; And to hear his voice and beware of the deceitfullness of sin, and
departing through unbelief: And sets before them the examples of those that
through unbelief did not enter the ripicall rest, and craveth leave to fear,
least any of them should seem to come short of entering the true rest: Heb.
5.11, 12. Chap. 6.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 7. and 10.25, 26, 29. Jer. 2.21, 22. 1 Ioh.
2.-19. chap. 6.9, 10.
And these holy Brethren also he reproves for their dullness and
unprofitableness. And then minding them of the foundation laid among them, and
the Oracles of God thereby to them, and the Principles they taught, which these
also had received, with the lively operations of the Holy Ghost therein,
experimented also by them: And then he secretly intimates to them, as if some
so far brought as they were, yet for want of heedfullness to this great
salvation, were seduced by the Tempter; And had wilfully and wickedly departed
from this faith, and therein from the foundation, Oracles and Principles; which
Apostates he puts here in the third person, Those, and they; because when
fallen away, they are no longer of this number. And because he does not judge
nor will sentence any of them to be such, yea he was better persuaded of
them; and yet proposes those as terrible examples to warn them. And so the
application by way of warning and admonition, and even to fear such things as
cause such danger is even to Believers, and that both in the first person we,
chap. 2.1.3. and 10.26. and 12.25. and also in the second person to them, chap.
3.7-13.15. and 4.1. and 5.11, 12. and 12.25. And this the usual language of
Scripture in like cases of departure, and the danger thereof. Romans 8.13. 1 Cor.
15.12. Gal. 1.6. and 4.11. and 5.4. 2 Pet. 3.17. And so this great danger,
being proposed as a warning. I shall consider the two next points propounded in
these verses.

CHAP. XI.
Heb. 6.4, 6, 7, 8.

FOr it is impossible for those, who were once enlightened, etc. Heb. 6.4.6.
If they fall away to renew them again unto Repentance, seeing they crucify to
themselves, the Son of God a fresh; and put him to an open shame. In which
words for showing the impossibility of renewing such. And the reason thereof, I
shall consider what the Text offers.

1 The persons that have and do so highly sin, as to renew them is impossible.

1 They are not such as do and always hitherto have lived in ignorance and
unbeleef, and so in profaneness, Ioh. 3.14, 16. Act. 13.38, 3 47. Romans 16.26
etc. for to such the Gospel declaring the foundation, and sounding forth the
oracles of God may be hopefully, and is to be preached to them, to bring them
from darkness to light. 2 They are not such as having heard of the foundation,
Joh. 2.9. Luke 24.26, 46 Act. 4.18, 26. 1 Cor. 15.12, 13-23.
do believe it to be, and yet are not instructed in, or acquainted with the
oracles of God (as in particular related, part 2. chap. 10. page 94. 95.) for
to such as these they are to be, and may be hopefully taught and opened. 3
They are not such, Ioh. 8.30, 31,-36. and 12.42, 43-47. 2 Cor. 5.20.21. and
6.1, 2.
as having heard and believed the Testimonies of the Gospel, concerning the
foundation and Oracles of God. And are not yet so prevailed with to heed, and
yield up thereto, as by spiritual light and evidence, to have those
forementioned Principles framed in them, only have their knowledge and faith in
understanding, and notion. These are to be, and may hopefully by the word of
grace be pressed thereto. 4 They are not such, 1 Cor. 15. Gal. 3. and 4, and
5. Jude 19, 20, 21.
as being brought as far as the farthest of these, yea with some spiritual
operations, having a tendancy toward the principles receiving; And yet after
by evil teachers, and temptations turned aside, and fall into doubtfullness
of, or denial, of some of the Oracles, and decay of that towardness that was
in them toward the Principles, and so are found fallen away: for by farther
opening the Doctrine of Christ, and from the foundation and Oracles of God,
opening and pressing for the first Principles to be received. They may be
recovered, and their recovery is to be hopefully sought; But they are such as
have by the Oracles of God been brought upon the foundation; and so had the
forementioned Principles framed in them, with such enlightenings and tastes as
has been shown. 5 Yet they are not such as these, through weakness or some
violent temptation prevailed with, and so overcome, Gal. 6.1. 1 Cor. 5. 2 Cor.
2, 3-11. and 12.19 -21. 2 The^^ 14, 15.
that they are fallen into some gross sin against some of the ten Commands, or
some breach of charity in sinning against some branches of the Precept of the
Gospel; for the recovery of these by the words of grace and reproof, and means
appointed thereby, may be hopefully sought; but they are such as these so far
proce^ded, that are fallen away from Foundation, Heb. 10.26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
Oracles, Principles; after all that light wilfully contemn and turn from this
grace, and despite it and this is their sin as before related in Part. 2. chap.
7. page 80-81.
2 That such as so grievously sin against grace, it is impossible to renew them
again to repentance, It is impossible. The Apostle speaks here of his
ministration, by preaching or writing; for he gives it as the reason, why he
forbears going over again the foundation Oracles, and thereby opening and
pressing the first Principles; because for such as need it, and to whom it may
be profitable, they to whom he writes are fitted, and may do that; but the
usefullness he is pressing to is needful for them, but to such fallen ones,
all he has to say will be of no avail to them; therefore he will proceed and
let such alone, for it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; We
have nothing to say of the Mediator, to press any thing on them, but what they
have crucified to themselves and contemn: So it is impossible to us to renew
them, it is out of the bounds of our ministration; 1 Timothy 1.20. 2 Timothy 2.21.
Tit. 3.10, 11.
we use either to reject such, or deliver them to Satan, and not exercise our
ministry farther toward them while they are such, and so we would have you to
do. They are fallen into the hands of God, who has left us nothing in our
ministration, Heb. 10 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.
to show how God may deal graciously with them through a Mediator, but all we
have to say of the Mediator, whom they have so despitefully used, will
aggravate their sin, and present nothing but terror to them; they are in a
fearful condition, and in danger of eternal damnation. But the Power of God
we will not limit. Mar. 3.29.
And all things are possible to him; Though he will do nothing but according
to the counsel of his own Will: And so in this sense he says, it is
impossible to renew, etc. which is a terrible sentence.

3 The Reason, Why it is impossible to renew them again to Repentance, is
expressed, seeing (or because) They crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh,
and put him to an open shame: He that was once willingly crucified, and put to
an open shame for them, and by his Spirit, commending his love there through to
their hearts, has been glory and beauty to them precious and efficacious in
them; yet now they turning aside to some vain dreams, have hardened their
hearts against him, and for lying vanities have forsaken him, and now are
turned adversaries to him; and by their own reasonings and lusts, and
magnifying some other thing, do make his blood and sacrifice of no account and
efficacy to themselves, but crucify him, Heb. 10.26, 2, 29, 30.
and cast shame on him, to make him despicable to themselves and others: And
there is no other Sacrifice to help them, no mean of any help but in the
freeness of Gods love, that gave his Son, and through that blood and Sacrifice
of his, made known by his gracious Spirit; And all this they have trodden under
foot, despised, despighted: And yet, that is not all, they are not by any
Judgments or warning reclaimed; but they go on, and continue so doing. And so
he says, not only they have fallen away, and have crucified, but they are
even now still so doing, they fall away, they crucify, etc. that is their
business. And they are so doing, it is impossible, and therefore impossible to
renew them again to Repentance; the words are very plain in themselves.

4 That this great danger of eternal damnation into which some have fallen, is
in some cases to be declared, Chap. 2, 3, 4, 6, 10.
and set before them that are not fallen into it, that they may be warned to
avoid all those evils by which by degrees, Gal. 4.
if not avoided, they may be brought to fall into it. And so the Apostle sets
this danger before the Hebrews, to warn them to avoid all that leads to it, as
has been shown. And so did he to the Galatians: And so he directs them to no
other or better faith than here set forth, which suppose some were fallen from,
yet he would have them abide and be steadfast, and grow in this faith; and if
any say, God cannot so proceed with such as once have such faith, though they
fall away. He answers, Heb. 6.7, 8. For the Earth which drinks in the Rain,
that comes often upon it, and brings forth Herbs meet for them by whom it is
dressed, receives blessing from God. But that which bears thorns and briars,
is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned. The Apostle
here sets forth the holiness and justness of Gods proceedings; that as their
standing is by faith, so they may take heed of presumptuousness; as he
admonished the Romans; Romans 11.18.23.
So here the Hebrews, still justifying God, as by setting forth the height and
grievousness of such sinning, being like the sin of the Angels that fell,
having no cause for it, Jude 6.
they had happiness enough in their condition, in which abiding they might have
been established; but aspiring after a higher estate, they left their
habitation, etc. So suitable thereto is this sinning, and in some degree,
beyond that of our first Father Adam, Romans 5.14. Numb 16. Jude 11.
in respect of his own particular, which men are not naturally guilty of so
great, but this is wilfully, resembling that of Corah. They willingly first
forsaking God, Isa. 1.12, 13, 14. Jude.
that showed such mercy to them as was better than all they could set eye on;
So as without cause they for some lust go on rebelliously against him,
finishing sin till it bring forth death. 2 Pet. 2.
Yea like Cain and Balaam; yea reward him evil for good, and hatred for love,
treading under foot, and despiting the choicest of all Gods love, cost and
Jewels, as is foreshewn; And here he produces a plain parrable in which he
shows the equity and justness of such proceeding; even to reason it self. For
the Earth on which a man bestows the same labor and cost for tillage, seeding,
dressing: and then it receives the same blessing from Heaven, in the heat and
influences of the Sun, and the former and latter Rain falling often upon it,
and drunk in by it: if any of this be wanting, the Earth is not condemned, but
if it have all this, and then bring forth Herbs Corn, or other fruit, meet for
those by whom it is dressed, it receives blessing from God. As men will gather
and accept that fruit, and be well pleased with such ground; and bless God
for it. So God will accept and bless such as according to his grace extended,
bring forth suitable fruits: But that part of the Earth which has had the same
labor, cost, tillage, seed, and dressing bestowed upon it, and received the
same blessing of the Sun, and the Rain, and drunk it in, as the former did
(else the faultiness will not be charged on the ground) and brings forth briars
and thorns, is rejected, etc. So here is equal and just proceeding. Now all
the difficulty here about Believers, lies in this, to know what these fruits
are, which yet would not have been so difficult; but that some to maintain an
opinion which this plainly overthrows, frame cavills against it: What say some,
are not repentance from dead works, and faith toward God, and all these
Principles, good fruits? To which one might reply with the like, and say, was
not the receiving of the Word with joy, the blade sprung up, the during for a
while, the Corn growing up, though among thorns, good fruit? To which would be
answered, No, for it came not to perfection, to be gathered in at the Harvest,
which answer is true, and may solve the doubt, and answer the former query: But
I may also answer it otherwise, That all the Principles here mentioned, as
taught by the Oracles of God, Are as the seed that is sown in the Earth (the
bearts of men) and the operations of the holy Spirit, in, and suitable to these
Principles, are as the rays of the Sun of Righteousness, and the Dew and Rain
from Heaven to make them fruitful: And the fruits meet for this is something
suitable; of which anon, but now if some of those fruits also to be named, be
granted to be in the believers operating, through all aforesaid; as surely
there are yet in him that falls away, and so is crucifying Christ again to
himself, etc. are such Briars and thorns, Ezekiel. 33.13.
as now nothing else is found upon his account: All his former Righteousness
is not remembered, Gal. 3.4.
all is lost, gone, and in vain, so says the Spirit; Surely there is a better
way to charge sin on such Apostates, and to glorify God, than to lay the blame
on the foundation laid by him, and say, there was no room on it for them;
Christ did not dye for them, there was no truth in his intention, in the
Oracles of God sounded forth to them, he had no purpose to save them. The
Principles they had were not of the right kind, He has not been at the same
cost, nor bestowed the same tillage, nor sown in the same seed, nor afforded
the same Sun and Rain to them, as He did to the other, and so charge God more
than them: Surely where God expects fruit, he says, what could have been done
more, etc. And he otherwise clears himself, saying, Of old time I have broken
thy yoke and burst thy bonds, Isa. 5, 3, 4, 5^
and thou said, I will not transgress, when upon every high hill, and under
every green tree thou wanderest, playing the Harlot. Yet I planted thee a noble
Vine, wholly a right seed, how are thou then turned into the degenerate plant
of a staange Vine unto me? ^^r. 2.20, 21, 31.
Surely no want in his dealings toward them; and this is suitable to that said
here, as they were our types: And so I shall give a plain answer, The fruits
here meant, verse. 7. are in this Epistle plainly expressed to be, a diligent
heed taking to the grace given, Eeb. 2.1, 2. and 3, 7, 8, ^5. and 3, 6, 14. and
10. 35, 36. and 13.1. and 11.11 13. and 4.16. and 7.25. and 10.19, 20, 22, 23,
24, 25. and 13.15 and 12, 13, 14. and 13.2.16. and 10.33, 34, 36. and 12.2-12.
and 13.3. and 10.23. and 13.23. and 9.28. and 13.21.
and received, and to the voice and teachings thereof; so as we let nothing
flip, nor harden our hearts against any of its teachings, like that 1 Cor.
13.1-4. And with this, A careful and fast holding of the rejoyoing of hope,
and beginning of confidence firm unto the end, like that, Col. 1.23. And
continuing in brotherly love, like that, 1 John 4.7. And so using all diligence
to walk in faith and love, like that, Gal. 5.6. And this in approaching to God
in the Name of Christ, for all promised in the New Testament, like that, 1
These. 5.17, 18. Phil. 4.6. And in frequenting the assemblies of the Saints,
continuing our fellowship with them in the Gospel, and ordinances of God, like
that, Phil. 1.5. And so in all the fruits of love, in com passion following
peace with all men, and holiness, abounding in deeds of mercy, and
righteousness, like that, Romans 12.8-13. Col. 3.12, 13. with patience and
constancy in our selves: and sympathizing with others in their afflictions,
like that, Romans 12.15. And so not ashamed of the word, ways, and people of
Christ, but holding fast the profession thereof, like that, 2 Timothy 1.8. Phil.
2.14, 15, 16. And in all so demeaning our selves as they that look and wait for
the coming of Christ, like that, Luke 12.35-42. And all these and such like
fruits are the same exhorted to Col. 2.6. 2 Pet. 1. 2 Pet. 1.5-11. Joh. 15.2,
3, 4-8. Heb. 2.1, 3. and 3.9. 13, 15, and 12, 15.16, 25. and 3.12, 16, 18. and
10.25.
And all this fruitfulness is in and by abiding in Christ; And on the contrary:
The Briars and Thorns here meant, appear in this Epistle to be a letting slip
the things we have heard, and so a neglect of the great Salvation and so a
listening to the deceitfullness of sin, and so hardening our hearts against the
teachings of the grace of God, and allowing in our selves any root of
bitterness, uncleanness or profaneness; and so turning from him that speaks
from Heaven, through an unbeleeving heart departing from the living God. and
6.6.
And then neglect of the Ordinances of Christ, and forsaking the Assemblies of
the Saints; and then crucifying to themselves the Son of God afresh, and
putting him to an open shame, And so when fallen from such a Faith, by the
Oracles of God fastened on such a foundation, and affording such Principles;
They have trodden under foot the Son of God; and have counted the blood of the
Covenant wherewith they were sanctified, as an unholy thing, and 10.29.
and have done despite unto the Spirit of Grace: These are Briars and Thorns,
and these not repenting but continuing thus crucifying Christ, etc. even
themselves are Briars and Thorns, nigh to cursing, being rejected, and their
end to be burned: And this justly and deservedly. 2 Samuel 23.6, 7.
Because of the truths, goodness, and riches of the Faith, taught by such
divine Oracles, and brought on such a foundation; affording such Principles,
sweet experiences, and blessed hope, all so watered from Heaven; as in which
others brought forth meet fruits; but they rewarding evil for good have so
foulely departed, and continue contemning, and bring forth Briars and Thorns,
Psol. 109.2-29.
till they become Briars and Thorns: So that even in this Demonstration of the
equity, justness, and holiness of Gods proceeding. The Faith they fell from,
and that others abiding in, are found fruitful, and exhorted to abide, appears
to be true, and of the right kind. And in the fourth and fifth verses, Chap.
6.9, 10, 11, 12.
the spirituality and livingness of it set forth sutably to the Principles.

But now I must return to view what is said against this Faith, as set forth,
Heb. 6.4, 5. Yea even by him that has acknowledged the Faith and Holiness, for
which he quotes this place really true in its kind, wrought by the Spirit
effectually, working effectually in all the powers of their souls, etc. So as
they become thereby; Vessels in the great house of God, etc. which is in part
already answered, but I shall view what is farther said,

CHAP. XII.
Of some sayings of Mr. Owens against this Faith, etc.

1 HE says of such Believers and Saints as here spoken of, See the Answer to
this. Page 375.376
Heb. 6.4.5. They are changed, as to their use, not in their Nature, continuing
stone and wood still, though hewed and turned to the serviceableness of
Vessels: So his saying. But this is to be heeded, that as the saying is
without proof: So the Question is not, what they were before this faith and
holiness was wrought in them, nor what they are when they are departed from
this faith and holiness: But what they are in whom this faith and holiness is,
and they abiding in it; and that they are wood and stone in some sense is
granted; according to that is said, The Righteous shall flourish like the Palm
Tree. He shall grow like the Cedar in Lebanon. And so they are called Trees of
Righteousness; Psalm. 92.12, 13. Isa. 61.3, 4. 1 Pet. 2.3, 4, 5, 9.
and those that tasting the graciousness of the Lord, come to him as to a
living stone, are built on him as lively stones, etc. but this is far from Mr.
Owens meaning: But if he allude to that, 1 Cor. 3.12. If any man build upon
this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones (all which are good sure) Wood,
Hay Stubble (all which are combustible) yet here is something doubtful among
many, viz. whether by these be meant Doctrins, or Persons, most probable,
Doctrins, because the builder may be saved, when his labor, and opinions is
by fire burned. But however this comes not up to our business; for we treat
not of a faith and holiness, builded upon the foundation; by the ministry of a
man only; and a man miscarrying also: But of the Faith, builded by the
enlightening, and operation of the unerring Spirit of the Lord, which is not
mistaken in his building; nor are Wood, Hay, Stubble, as distinct from true
Saints, any where in Scripture called Saints, and believers, nor does the
Spirit of Christ build such on Christ, and leave them such. And for his other
Metaphor. 2 Timothy 2, 20, 21.
Though in a great house there are Vessels, not only of Gold and of Silver, but
also of Wood and of earth; some to honor, and some to dishonor: Yet they are
all for use: And those of the most costly metal may some of them be for some
dishonorable use for the Master, and those of the meanest metal may some of
them be for honorable use both for the Master, and servants: But now in the
application we have no Vessels mentioned, meet for the Masters use, operated
by the Spirit to do worthily in their Generations (as Mr. Owen confesses these
may, and many of them do) but such as by the grace received purge themselves
from the Apostates and their ways; and so are by grace sanctified, and made
meet for the Masters use, and prepared unto every good work; so that his saying
is not countenanced in this place; And if any should (as I when by tradition, I
held it, have sometime done) ground this assertion upon some parabolical and
proverbial speeches, as those in Prove. 26.11. and 2 Pet. 2.21, 22. He knows
that parables run not on all four; and that Proverbs and Metaphors are not to
answer, that set out by them in every similitude; and he that wrings the Nose
too hard causes blood to follow; for in grounding such an assertion on such
metaphorical and proverbiall speeches, we shall plead for wicked men, and
extenuate their sin, and impute some blame to the Almighty. For when it is said
of them: These, Jude 10. 2 Pet. 2.12, 13, 14, 15.
as natural bruit beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the
things they understand not, etc. If these men had never understood more than
the beasts, and had always been so brutish: and even made to be destroyed;
Job 35.10, 11. Prove. 1.24-32 Psalm. 49.12.20 Mat. 16.26. Prove. 26.11.
then had not their sin been so great as it was: Nor (which befalls not to
the beasts) their judgment in eternal damnation so just: But God having given
them understanding above the beasts; and they not heeding to make use of it,
became as the beasts that perish; and so loose their own souls: So the Dog that
turns to his vomit was never rid of his doggish ignorance and nature, Nor the
Sow that being washed, walloweth in the mire, was never freed from her swinish
ignorance and nature: And so, though their doing so be filthy and loathsome,
yet some pity, and not so great torment to be executed on them: But for these
enlightened in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And having
the holy Commandment delivered to them, with such Principles effected in them,
in knowledge of him that forbids holy things to be given to Dogs and Swine;
Mat. 7.6.
And through the operations of the Spriit in that knowledge to have escaped the
pollutions that are in the World through lusts, which was that they might have
partaken of the divine Nature, to be so foolish, as to make themselves again,
as the Dog and as the Sow; How great is their sin, and how just their
Judgment; And as for their disposition he confesses that was once changed;
so that the sin here mentioned, suits that falling away mentioned in Heb.
6.4.6. without any impeachment to the goodness of the Faith such have fallen
from, 2 Pet. 2.20. and 1.4.
the excellency whereof condemns their falling.

2. But he says again, though their faith, holiness, light, love, joy, zeal,
obedience, be all true in their kind, and many of them do worthily, and yet
they attain not to the Faith of Gods Elect, neither does Christ live in them,
nor is the life which they lead by the Faith of the Son of God (so he.) Mark
here, that this is not to be understood of them, as before they came to the
Faith; Nor yet of them, as after they are departed from the Faith, but of them
as, and while the Faith is in them, and they abide in it. And he eonfesseth
their faith really true in its kind. Pages 217, 218.
And its before proved, there is but one kind of Faith that is really true, set
forth in the Scripture. And that very Faith also set forth in Heb. 6.1, 2, 3,
4, 5. Nor are we treating of a worldly or humane faith, or a faith begotten by
humane strift, but of a Faith effected by the Spirit of God, and built on Jesus
Christ, that is the Foundation, and the heavenly gift of which they have
tasted. Mat. 3.17. and 12 18. Isa. 42.1.
And is not Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in whom he is well pleased. And so
Gods Elect: Does the Gospel hold forth and call to any other? or does the holy
Spirit witness of, glorify and draw to believe in any other but Jesus Christ?
Does not every good and perfect giving come down from the Father of lights? who
enlived them, and quickened up all these Principles in them, if not Christ by
his Spirit? what is that which was once so precious, that the Apostates after
departure crucify to themselves, tread under foot, etc.? Is it not Christ the
Son of God, his blood, even the blood of the Covenant, and his Spirit, even the
Spirit of Grace, which they so despite: Yea if it were not so, their sin and
danger had not been so great, and there would be more hope of their recovery
again: It were better for us to forbear such rash assertions; and glorify God
in keeping to the expressions of Scripture, concerning Faith and the operations
of Grace, although some be departed from it, as is forenoted. I planted thee a
hoble Vine, Ier 2.21, 27, 31.
and such of you as are fallen from grace; ye were called to liberty, Gal.
5.2, 3.4 Gal. 5. and 1. and 3, and 4, and, 5.
yea were called into the grace of Christ; ye received the spirit of Adoption,
ye did run well, etc. So as we fault the backsliders from such faith, to
aggravate their sin, and fault not the faith to extenuate their sin; which is
more or less vile according to the excellency or meanness of the faith departed
from.

But Mr. Owen has yet more sayings to impeach this Faith, as

3 In page 423. He calls it, an inferior work of the Holy Ghost, causing a
great alteration or change, etc. when the persons be not regenerated or made
new Creatures, etc.

It had been good he had explicated the meaning of his terms; for its already
proved the completing of the work of Regeneration, and making new Creatures,
is in the Resurrection of the just; and that the first fruits is in begetting
us by his word to believe in his Son: But that the Holy Ghost operateth more or
less, in giving the Testimony of Christ, working repentance from dead works,
and faith toward God, to work any change or alteration, like Regeneration,
that is not it, according to the measure and degrees of his working; none that
know God, and Christ, or the Spirit according to Gospel declaration will
believe, that many fain and pretend what they are not, that many resist his
operations, that many are not yet prevailed with to believe on him, Is true.
But these are not charged with this forementioned great sin of departing from
the Faith, but only for disobedience to the Faith, and the Servants of God may
both use means, and wait with patience, and hope, when God will give these
repentance, for they are not come to this impossibility of the fallen ones
treated of, who when fallen from so great grace and operations of the Spirit:
It will not be found a true excuse to say, there was but some inferior work
of the Spirit vouchsafed us, Ier. 2.5.21.31. Isa. 5.4.5-7.
to work something like regeneration which was not it; when God shall say,
wherein was I wanting, what could have been done more, etc. but yet more is said
by Mr. Owen. Page 4 26, 6.


4 Page 124. Every person under these works formerly mentioned, and partakers
of this light, gifts and knowledge, etc. Be capacitated for the sin against
the Holy Ghost

Surely to use such an expression by way of derogation, from the Truth,
goodness, and gracious ends, and tendancy of the works of the Holy Ghost, in
inlightening men in the knowledge of Christ, and bringing in to believe in him,
and thereby working in all the powers and faculties of their soul, such change,
etc. as to say (as I hope he will not say, men are thereby capacitated to sin
against the Holy Ghost, is very great presumption, and of dangerous
consequence, without some better explanation. For might not some reply and say,
All manner of sin and Blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, But the Blasphemy
against the Holy Ghost shall never be forgiven. And so it is less dangerous
to abide in ignorance, rudeness, and profaneness, and neglect of all
Ordinances, then by attending them, to come to this knowledge of Christ, Faith,
change, gifts. etc. without which we are out of the danger of so great
sinning; but in having such faith, etc. we are capacitated so to sin; which
yet would be a false plea (even for those charged with such a sin, Mark.
3.28.30. who were short of those we treat of much more) for these; yet thus
much will be granted, If God had not made the Angels holy, and set them in so
glorious an habitation; they could not have sinned so highly in leaving their
habitation; but the goodness of God in so making and furnishing them, did
capacitate them to have abiden, in which abiding they might have been
established: And their own wilful aspiring; capacitated, and occasioned their
falling. If God had not made the first public man righteous, he couldnot have
fallen from it. as he did: But the Righteousness in which God made him, and
the furniture. wherewith he endued him, did capacitate him to have abiden in
his integrity: And his forgetting the word of the Lord, and listening to Satan's
temptation: did capacitate and occasion him to fall: If Christ had not come and
preached to the Jews, they could not have been charged with such sinning
against the light; But his being and preaching among them did capacitate them
to have believed and been saved; And their refusal of, and opposition against
the light did capacitate them to sin to such a degree, as to be charged with
so great sinning: Even so this blessed inlightening and operation of the Holy
Ghost, giving such tastes of the heavenly gift, etc. effecting such repentance,
and faith, and quickening up such living principles in men; Does capacitate men
to abide, and live and dye in this Faith. But their own neglect of so great
salvation, and so willing blinding their eyes, and hardening their hearts, and
so turning from him that speaks from Heaven, did capacitate and occasion the
persisters in such transgression, Heb. 12.25. and I^^. 28, 29, 30.
to fall into this great sin, which is even proved to be so heinous and great
a sin by the excellency of the Grace and Faith given them, which they so
willingly fell from, and so the justness of their great punishment, evidenced
thereby also. It should be very evilly done of any to vilify the works of God
because of the abuses of men. Or to excuse the evil of sinning, with saying,
the woman which thou gave me, etc. But enough to show the weakness of these
sayings, and the righteousness and goodness of the Faith set forth in Heb.
6.1.2, 3, 4, 5. But Mr. Owen endeavors to gather Reasons out of the Text it
self; to prove the Faith and holiness here set forth, though true in its kind,
yet not to be of the right and saving kind; I shall only view the heads of
them, and see their force.

CHAP. XIII.
Of Mr. Owens Reasons against the Faith and Holiness, that is set forth in Heb.
6.4, 5. in page 424, etc.

REason 1 Here is no mention of Faith, Page, 426.27.
or believing, or in terms equivalent.

Answ. Has Mr. Owen quoted and used this place, as his main place for proving,
and his only place for opening a Faith and Holiness wrought by the Spirit,
effecting change, and really true in its kind. And having served his turn of
it, now put it to shame, and cast it by as a place where is no mention of
Faith, or believing, or in Terms equivalent, that no other might look there, to
see what true Faith is: And is not mentioning of the Foundation, the object of
Faith, and the Oracles of God the teacher of Faith, the effects and Principles
of Repentance from dead works, Faith toward God, Doctrine, etc? And then
presently suiting the works of the Spirit to all these, mentioning,
enlightening, taste of the heavenly gift, partaking of the Holy Ghost, taste of
the good word of God, and of the powers of the World to come: are these Terms,
verse. 4, 5. no expressions or mention of faith, or believing, or in terms
equivalent? Did the Apostle think one of these Terms equivalent (even
Illumination, Heb. 10.32.) And are not all these Terms, verse. 4, 5. so
expressed and suited to those, verse. 1, 2. where Faith also is named, no
mention, nor Terms equivalent, to Faith or Believing? judge Reader.

Reas. 2 Not any thing here spoken of, as ascribed to the persons spoken of,
which is peculiar to Believers, or that constitutes them to be such, called
according to purpose, quickened, born again, or regenerated, justified, united
to Christ, sanctified by the Spirit, adopted; made the Sons of God. Be the
usual expressions of Believers.

Ans. It is clear; here is as much said of these, with ascribing the works to
the Holy Ghost, and acknowledgement of the receipts and tastes spoken of; while
they are yet in the supposition, and not departed; as is said of any of the
Hebrews, to whom this Epistle is written. Indeed when any such are fallen away,
not these things, but other things are ascribed to them; but it is the faith
and spiritual operations once had, and still retained by those not departed,
(and not the departure and crucifying Christ again, which is only in those
fallen away) we now speak of. And that those things which are peculiar to
believers, is here expressly spoken of, is showed and proved before at large, in
opening the principles taught by the Oracles, and built upon the foundation,
and the inlightning, and operations of the Holy Ghost, in, and with, working
up, and suited to those principles expressly, that I marvel, any that know the
foundation, and Oracles of God, and first principles, and Scripture language
should deny it, and much more, that he that more than once has said, that upon
other inferior (and not justifiable) accounts they are frequently called,
Believers and Saints. But in this he has said, not proved. And as for the
Catalogue of terms here brought in, and affirmed to be the usual expressions of
believers, conceived to be terms equivalent to faith, and believing, we may as
he opposes them to these in Heb. 6.4.5. consider,

1 That some are said to have believed, of whom I know not where it is also
said they had faith; Luke 8.13. Joh. 2.23. and 8.30, 31, 32, 36.
for no man is said in Scripture to have faith, unless he be obedient to the
faith, so as he receive the testimony, and close with the object, and have some
usefulness of it, as has been shown, yet many that believed, yea, so believed,
that if they abode they should be saved, where believing is expressly mentioned,
yet these terms under consideration, not applicable to such. But whether these
are usually called Believers, I need not contend, for those we treat of, are
believers in a farther sense, as has been shown.

2 Here are some of these terms, affirmed to be the usual expressions of
Believers, which as they are set down, I cannot find at all used in the
Scripture, as the expressions of Believers, as they are in this life. As the
term Regenerated, as distinct to being born again, as here set down, I read in
Scripture of a Regeneration, in which the Apostles followed Christ. Mat. 19.28.
Tit. 3.5. Ephesians. 5.26, 27. Luke 20.35, 36
And of saving by the washing of Regeneration, which as it flows from Christ is
a continued work still in doing, and to be fully completed in the resurrection
of the just. But that the believers in this life, are called, The Regenerated,
I find not at all, much less usually: And so for the term Adopted, I find,
the Adoption (or ministration thereof) to have pertained to Israel under Moses
ministration, Rom 9.4. Gal. 41, 2, 3. Ephesians. 1.5.
though the Tutorage of sons, were then as servants. And I find also the first
Trusters in Christ predestined. in their ministration, to the adoption of
children by Jesus Christ: And therefore so to have preached Christ come in the
flesh, That men in believing might receive the Adoption of Sons, Gal. 4.5.8,
23. Rom 8.15. Gal. 4.6, 7.
and so a first fruits of the Spirit of Adoption. And I find that such as did
unfainedly believe in Christ, did receive the Spirit of Adoption into their
hearts, crying, Abba Father. But this I also find, That this Adoption is not
yet completed, but only begun, and a first first fruits, and that of the
Spirit only received, and those that have this, do yet wait for the Adoption
(enjoying yet only by hope) even the redemption of the body, Romans 8.12, 23, 24,
25.
when Adoption will be completed in the resurrection of the Just. And so I
find not this said, That believers are completely adopted; Nor is the Adopted,
the usual, or any expression by which believers are now called, that I find.

3 Here are some expressions, which in the meaning of them are true of all
believers in this life, as things truly and perfectly done, though for the
measure not come to its height, and yet not as expressed, the usual expressions
of believers, Ioh. 15.2, 4, 7 Heb. 4.1, 2, 3. Psalm. 86.11.
as united to Christ, which is a gracious work, and in some measure spiritually
effected through believing in the believers, that being united by faith to the
object of faith, the word, and so Christ in the word is in their heart, and
thus by faith, love, and desires in Christ. So also tasting of the heavenly
gift, etc. And so one: And yet a farther uniting prayed for; yea that they
might be one in will, Ioh. 17.20, 21.
purpose, design, and way: And this union of Spirit, we are exhorted to keep,
and to grow up in it, till we come to the fullness of it; Ephesians. 4.12, 16.
but it is not yet fully completed; And so though in a sense believers are
united to Christ, and so truly said to be, yet the compleatment is but a
working, and growing toward. Believers are not very often, and usually set
forth by this expression, The united to Christ. And the term, Made the Sons of
God, is that which in a spiritual sense may be affirmed of true believers; for
to all that receive Christ by believing on him, by believing on his name he
gives the power to be the Sons of God, and so the favor to be called his
Sons; and his Sons they now are by faith (and not otherwise yet.) And shall
more fully and completely be made the Sons of God in the resurrection of the
just; Joh. 1.12, 13. 1 John 3.1. Gal. 3.26. Luke 20.35, 36 1 John 3.2.
whence though Sons of God, be often and usual expressions of believers, yet
made Sons of God, is not so usual an expression, as some other.

4 Here is one expression, that is once or twice used, with some other
expressions joined with it, and explain it who they be; To express believers
that are cordial, with the manner of their calling, and the operation of their
faith, viz. The called according to purpose, Romans 8, 28. 2 Timothy 1.9. Heb. 10.32.
but as a single expression, it is not so usual. And illumination is once used
as a single expression to express believers, besides. This place, Tasting that
the Lord is gracious, 1 Pet. 2.3.
may be taken as so used in another place; And what can be less in tasting of
the heavenly gift, and of the good word of God, etc. Besides as illumination,
tasting of the heavenly gift, etc. are works of the Spirit here mentioned, Act.
11.18. and 20, 21. and 26, 18. Col. 1.4, 5.
as suited to repentance from dead works, and faith toward God, they are
expressions by which believers are usually set forth, so as no cause to except
against them, as not so usual, etc.

5 Here are some terms in the substance of them, though not so usual, or not
more usual than the terms in the Text, here by him rejected, as he expresses
them, usual terms to express Believers, viz. Quickened, Born again, Justified,
Sanctified by the Spirit. Usual indeed; Ephesians. 2.4. Col. 2.13.
But mind well, Quickened is sometime used as an expression of that enlivening,
wrought at first in believers, expressed by Ye, and Us. But the word is also
used to express the efficacy of the word in believers. Psalm. 119.50, 93, and
21.20. and 119 88. 1 Pet. 3.18. Romans 8.11.
And sometime the word is used for a believer fallen into some afflicted and
drooping condition being raised again; sometime for strengthening to walk in the
ways of righteousness, and sometime for the resurrection of the body after
death. And so although this be in some respect a right and good expression of
believers, as thus sometime have been, now are, and after death in the
resurrection shall fully be; yet the expression, Heb. 6.4, 5. compared with
verse. 1, 2. import the same, and are every way as suitable to express
believers, according to their seize in this life, both in principles and
spiritual efficacies, as is at large shown. The other expression, Born again,
Joh. 3.3.5. and 1.13. 1 Pet. 1.3. Jam. 1.18.
if understood, or from above, and so as explicated of water, and the Spirit,
and so of God, by the word of God. A good and fit expression of believers often
used, yet this must be granted, That there are degrees and measures of the work
of God in this work also, that is expressed by this term, For whosoever
believes that Jesus is the Christ, 1 John 5.1. 1 Cor. 12.3. Luke 20.36. Romans
8.23. Act. 13.39. Romans 5.1. 1 Cor. 6.11.
is born of God. And no man can say in preaching Gospel, That Jesus is the
Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. And none are fully and completely born of God till
the resurrection from the dead, so that for explicating the state and present
frame of a believer; The expressions used Heb. 6.1, 2, 4, 5. are every way as
suitable, yea explicating that expression. And so also Justified is a good
expression to set forth a Believer. And so is Sanctified by the Spirit, but
mostly used, rather to set forth, what is received in believing, than the
believing it self. And the expressions in Heb. 6.1, 2, 4, 5. as much set forth
believing, and so may as well express the believer as either of them; So that
all these expressions brought in, though they are all very good, yet the
bringing them in, to discountenance and eject other expressions used in this
business by the Holy Ghost also, 2 Timothy 2.14. Job. 15.3. and 38.2.
is not good, but (contrary to the Commandment) to enter strife about words to
no profit, but the subversion of the hearers or readers; and a darkning of
counsel, by multiplying words without knowledge.

For was not the laying of Christ for the foundation, the purpose, and
according to the purpose of God? And was not the lifting up Jesus in
Gospel-preaching, and glorifying him by Spirit to the hearts of men, that they
might see, and believe, the purpose, and according to the purpose of God? And
whereas some when light comes, would yet be wise in their own eyes, and so come
in to claim by a righteousness of their own, not submitting to the
righteousness of God, and so are not in respect of the prevalency of grace
discovered, the right called ones, yet others in minding that grace discovered,
are prevailed with, to let go all thoughts of confidence in their own
righteousness, etc. and to believe in Jesus, that they may live in him, and to
him. Are not these the called according to purpose? And when in believing in
Christ on this manner, through illumination of the Holy Ghost, and tastes of
the heavenly gift, etc. Repentance from dead works, and faith toward God is
effected, etc. Are not such in some measure called according to purpose,
Quickened, Born again, and spiritually regenerated, united to Christ, justified,
and sanctified by the Spirit? Who that confesses God to be true, will deny
this, so that these two Reasons are vain.

Reason 3. The persons intended (here) be compared to Briars and Thorns.

Answ. The persons intended here, as having, and so abiding in these
principles, upon this foundation, and so with these inlightnings, tastes of the
heavenly gift, etc. Are verily the holy Brethren, partakers of the heavenly
Call, even the very Hebrews to whom he wrote; the persons supposed, expressed
to be such, as do not abide and enjoy these things, but are departed and fallen
from these things, and are now crucifying Christ afresh to themselves, they
bringing forth such Briars and Thorns, are become Briars and Thorns, which
before they were not, nor are any that abide in the faith they are fallen from,
so called, and these fallen, upon the very account of their crucifying, etc.
are compared to, and with their evil fruits, called, Briars and Thorns, this is
plain in the Text, and so this Reason (though once it was mine) is very vain
and false for its end, and unbeseeming understanding men, though weaklings may
be gulled with it, as I have been.

Reason 4. Things that accompany salvation, be better things than any in the
persons mentioned, were to be found, verse. 9. We are persuaded better things
of you, etc.

Answ. Here he speaks of things distinct from the persons, though in them. Now
mind; Better things: Better than which, for the Apostle had mentioned diverse
sorts of things, as he had mentioned Jesus Christ the foundation, and the
Oracles of God from the foundation teaching those principles to build men
thereby on Christ; Surely the love of God in the gift of his Son, The Son of
God given, The blood of Jesus Christ that confirmed the Covenant, The Spirit of
the Father, and the Son, that witnesses of Christ, and calls to him, and
breaths forth these Oracles to teach these principles, and build on Christ.
Sure this, Heb. 10.29.
or these things are all holy, heavenly, rich, precious, invaluable things, not
only accompanying, but giving and working salvation (though some do tread them
underfoot, etc. which is an evil thing.) So that sure he means not better
things than these. But then here is mentioned also, the effects of the word,
and of the holy Spirit, in, and with the word in the hearts of believers; as
Repentance from dead works, and faith toward God, etc. with Illumination,
tasting of the heavenly gift, etc. Phil 2.12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
Surely these are also precious things, not only accompanying salvation, but
even parts of the salvation begun in them, and working in them, effecting those
things to be brought forth which are to accompany it (though some murmr and
harden their hearts, Heb 3.7, 15.16. 1 Thessalonians. 5.19.
and so are disobedient, and quench and despite the Spirit, which is an evil
thing) and sure he means not better things than these. But here are two sorts
of things more mentioned, that is, Heb 3.6, 14, and 13, 1, and 2, and 4 and
6.8, 9, 10.
first, Abiding in their faith, confidence, and love, And so harkening to his
voice, bringing forth the fruits of faith and love, as has been fore-shewn,
according to the seed sown in the heart, and the refreshings by the rain often
drunk in, and of these he expresses himself to men, verse. 9.10. And these be
not better things, then the salvation wrought in them, as by which they bring
them forth; but better than the other sort, which secondly, he names, by some
supposed to bring forth, that is a departing from Christ, through an evil heart
of unbeleef, and so falling from all this salvation, and efficacies thereof
extended; and then crucifying the Son of God afresh, and putting him to an open
shame. And notwithstanding the same seed sown, and the same rain often drunk in,
yet bring forth Briars and Thorns (which accompany not salvation) of which he
mentions no persons among them that he cahrgeth withal, but only by a
supposition shows the danger even to these Hebrews, if any should so do.
Chap. 2.1, 2, 3, and 3.7.18, and 4.1. and 15.12. and 6, 4, 6, 8, 9.
And having so often warned them before, and reproved their dullness. And now in
his supposition set forth before them the hainousness of the sin, and danger,
of such departing and falling away, comparing such transgression and
transgressors, to Briars and Thorns, whose end is to be burned; he mollifies
the harshness of his sentence in respect of them, and says, We are persuaded
better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus
speak, which plainly shows the better things, to be better than Thorns and
Briars, which tended to damnation; and it shows also that his speech in the
warning given was directed to them, else they needed not to have been mollified
with, Though we thus speak; surely none would fancy the Apostle to warn the
Hebrews by speaking at such a rate as this; There is a rock of stability, on
which who ever once believes, and so is, can no more fall off, not sin, not
Satan, not world, though at such and such a rate they listen to them, and fall
into sueh and such a measure of unbeleevingness and sinning, yet they cannot
fall off: And you are upon that Rock, etc. Hold fast therefore your confidence,
Take heed lest any of you fall through an evil heart of unbeleef: And give us
leave to fear lest any of you come short, for there is an unstable rock, on
which, not you, but some others are built. And they that are built on that rock
of instablility, if they abide, they perish; if they fall, they can no more
rise; how fond were this. But the foundaion here mentioned is stable, nor will
the holy Spirit build any upon an unstable foundation, nor fill the heart with
false light, or deceivable works; What deceitful illusions such conceits may
produce, I forbear to name, though this Reason be fit for them.

Reason 5. The persons intended by the Apostle, were such as had need to be
taught again the first principles, etc. Unskilful in the word of righteousness,
etc. distinguished from them to whom the promises are, etc. Chap. 6, 9, 10, 14.

Answ. This is a very harsh, sad, and untrue sentence, clearly appearing so;
For,

1 It is as clear as the day, that Chap. 5.11, 12. he speaks to the same
persons, that he wrote unto, and had before called, Heb. 2 1, 2, and 3, 1, 6,
14 and 4, 1, and 5, 11, 12
Holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly call, and to, and of them he says,
Ye are dull of hearing, for when for the time ye ought to be teachers, you
have need that one teach you again, which be the first principles of the
Oracles of God. Can any thing be more plain, to show he means them?

2 It is as clear, that his saying in Verses 13, 14. are the proof that the
Apostle gives of the justness, and suitableness of his reproof, Heb. 5.13, 14.
in showing what such weaklings are, to whom in their demeanor they became so
like, which occasioned their dullness and non proficiency, being so like them,
they should have been teachers of.

3 It is as clear, That those weaklings and babes, to whom he compares them,
are not the persons put in the supposition of being fallen away, and in so
great danger in height of sinfulness, and of impossibility of recovery, and
soreness of punishment; Heb. 6.4, 5.6, 8
for they had known the foundation, oracles and first principles, yea been by
them drawn upon the foundation, and tasted of the heavenly gift, yea the
sweetness and power of Christ in all the principles; So that now after such
knowledge and tastes, etc. willingly for love or desire of any other thing, to
depart, and crucify all this of Christ; to themselves again; there was nothing
but they had crucified, and were crucifying to restore them with, and so they
could not be restored. But for those weaklings and babes, they were not yet
skilful in these things, and so could not sin at so high a rate, but might be
both profitably and hopefully, yet taught over and over, which be the first
principles of the Oracles of God; and if any of them by temptation, were fallen
from what they began to have, yet there was something of Christ in the
foundation, oracles, principles, and efficacies of Spirit therein, which they
had not clearly known, and so not crucified to themselves, neither were they
crucifying Christ to themselves, and so there was that needful to them to be
still taught them for their recovery. And it is uncharitable to put weaklings
and babes, under this danger and impossibility of being renewed. A rash and sad
saying, yea cross to his other rash saying, speaking of these believers
mentioned, Heb. 6.4, 5. of their high gifts of knowledge, faith, change of
affections and conversation, light, love, etc. says afterward, every person
under these works formerly mentioned (of this light, gifts, etc.) be
capacitated for the sin, against the Holy Ghost: And now he says, They are the
ignorant, weaklings and babes that commit it, verifying that, Prove. 5.6. and
9.13.

4 Neither is there any distinguishing of these wrote to, or reproved, or of
those to whom they are compared, nor yet of them put in the supposition (but
when fallen away, and found crucifying of Christ, and so blotted out of the
book of life) from them to whom the promises appertain, Chap. 6.9, 10-14. For
the promise mentioned is that made to Abraham, which appertained so, as by
attending to the promise it might be attained, and enjoyed, Romans 3.2 and 9, 4,
5, and 11, 21, 24. Act. 2.38, 39, and 3.25, 26. Romans 4.11, 12, 16. Gal. 3.7, 8,
29.
by all, or any of his natural seed, that were under Circumcision in the time
of it, or his proselited seed either; and so Peter preached to them, and so
where the Gospel comes to all that believe in Christ, as interested in them,
and heirs of them; and the Apostle was not here in Heb. 6.9-14. making a
distinction, between those of them, to whom, and of whom he wrote (except in
supposal of any fallen away, and found crucifying Christ) to whom the promises
did belong, and to whom not, but showing the hopefulness he had for them all,
of whom he was persuaded they were not so fallen away, as to be found
crucifying Christ to themselves, and upon that account, exhorts every one of
them, to persevere in showing the same diligence to the full assurance of hope
to the end, etc. The edge of and hope in which exhortation is abated, and a
mist cast upon it, by this wresting the words.

Reason 6. True believers are opposed to those lying under a possibility of
falling, so far as they are cast under it, by the conditional discourse upon
sundry accounts.

Answ. In the whole Epistle, Heb. 2.1, 2, 3. Heb. 3.7, 12, 13 and 12, 25.
there is not one word of distinguishing the one from the other, but in the
neglect of so great salvation, in hardening the heart, by deceitfulnes of sin,
in departing from the living God, through an unbeleeving heart, a turning from
him that speaks from heaven, etc. Nor one put in fear of this more than
another, nor secured without watchfulness, and heed taking one more than
another; Nor does the Apostle in Heb. 6.4.6. speak one word of the possibility,
or impossibility of falling, or not falling, but only in a supposition of those
already fallen, from such a height, and now crucifying Christ to themselves;
nor does he in this speak a word of any possibility of the recovery of one of
these, more than of another; Nor does he in his warning giving, apply it to one
more than another; but in showing the greatness of the sin, if any should fall
from such excellency of grace, and the danger; and therein the equity of Gods
proceeding; to warn them all alike, which this assertion opposes, without the
show of warrant from any one word; but because he says it is upon sundry
accounts, I will view them.

Account 1. Their work and labor of love, mentioned verse. 9, 10.

Answ. Here is no opposition of one to another, for he had yet charged none of
them to be so departed, but only reproved them, and showed them the danger of
such departure, and falling away, and now also mollifying the harshness of his
reproofs, He is persuaded better things of them, than that they are departed,
or so fallen, or that they will bring forth such briars and thorns, Gal. 4.14,
15 and 5, 4. Heb. 6.10, 11, 12.
and he gives one reason of it, from their work and labor of love, not only
that they had showed, for that might be affirmed of some in other places, that
were fallen from grace, but also that they did still continue in: And he
desires their perseverance to the end, that they might receive the promises: So
that he here also speaks to, and of them all, without difference making, so
that a line was imperfectly here taken, to make up this account, not serving
for such a business at all.

Account 2. Their preservation from the righteousness of God.

Answ. Here is no opposition of one to another, Verse. 10.
but he speaks of them all in general: And wherein had God so freely engaged
himself in his righteousness, so as if he should not preserve men, and keep
them to eternal life, he also should be unrighteous: Is not this engagement
first and primely to Jesus Christ? 2 Cor. 1.20.
Are not all the promises in him Yea, and in him Amen? And is it not in, and
through Christ to Abraham, and all the Spiritual seed, Isa. 28.16 Romans 4 12, 16
Gal. 3.16, 29 Act. 10.43 Romans 4.5, and 5.1 Act. 26.13 2 Timothy 1.7 1 Pet. 1.5
Heb. 3.6.14
as many as through grace, believe in Christ? And do not they that believe in
him freely receive forgiveness of sins, justification, sanctification, and a
spirit of faith and love? And how is this engagement to keep believers? Is it
not by his power through faith unto salvation, suitable to that engagement held
forth to these Hebrews? And they now believing, the Apostle is comforted
concerning them, and incourageth them with the righteousness of God: So then,
All the promises of God, are Yea and Amen in Christ: And sure to them all that
believe in Christ, That their preservation in faith and love, is from the
freeness of the mercy of God, and his righteousness through Christ, to continue
to them such supplies of grace and spirit, that they may persevere in faith and
love: This I hope, is believed by us all, yea and something more than this,
namely, That as faith works through love, Gal. 1.6 Mat 10 41, 42 Luke 14.14
so every service of love produced by it, shall to the believer be rewarded,
but then this is without opposition of one believer to another, it is in
general alike true to them all. But now suppose any after they have known the
truth, and believed, and met with such riches and furniture, to keep them in,
and preserve them, and have brought forth some fruits of love; do after this,
for some dream or fancy, etc. turn aside, and so fall away from God. Is God
unrighteous then to forsake them, and to blot out all their former services, so
as not one is remembered on their account? Surely not, he should not else be
righteous, Genesis 12.3. 2 Chronicles. 15.2. Ezekiel. 33.12, 13 Joh. 15.1.2 11
according to the tenor of his promise, and engagement to his Son, and to men
through his Son: And in this language speaks the Apostle to these Hebrews,
Chap. 3, 6, 14, and 10, 35, 38, 39, and 12, 25. And that without difference
making. And I hope none would think the righteousness of God engaged to the
works of men, otherwise than in and through Christ, to such as live by the
faith of Christ; so as this line was wrested to a by end, to make up this
Account; and yet will not serve for that purpose.

Account 3. The immutability of the Counsels of God, and his Oath, mentioned,
verse. 13-18.

Answ. Here is no opposition of believers under a possibility of falling, to
believers under an impossibility of falling, nor is the promise here made to
some sort of believers, opposed to other belevers: But to Abraham for himself,
Gal. 3.6, 7, 8, 13, 14. 1 Timothy 2.7. Ephesians. 3.4 Mat. 22.19, 20 Romans 4.16.
and his seed, which is Christ, and all that through grace, believe in him: And
this so that it may be held forth to all men, that they may believe. And to all
that do believe, that abiding in the faith they may be sure of the inheritance.
And such the counsels and purpose of God as has been shown, in treating of
purposes, and promises, in which he is immutable: And this the Apostles scope
suitable to his exhortation for their diligence and perseverance in faith and
love, in which so sure consolation; but it suits not at all to the scope of
this Account.

Account 4. Their sure, and steadfast Anchor of hope, verse 19.

Answ. Neither is here any difference made between, or opposition of one
believer to another, but a strong consolation set before all believers, that
have by faith laid hold on Christ, who is the seed of Abraham, in whom all the
promises confirmed with an Oath, are Yea and Amen: And he having offered up the
acceptable sacrifice, is now in our nature entered into the heavens, appearing
there a great high Priest, having opened the way for our approach: And ever
living to intercede for all that come to God by him: So as they that by faith
do lay hold on him, who is our hope and hope fixed in him, is as an Anchor
surely fixed, they by faith and hope enter within the vail, cleaving to him,
that is there for us, and so their hope is sure and steadfast, which comfort is
not for some sort of, but for all that are indeed believers: And so the Apostle
enters on his main design, to build these believers more and more on Christ;
which evidenceth, that to be the right faith, and those true believers spoken
of Heb. 6.1, 2, 3, 4 5. and none of them excepted, unless any have so willingly
departed, that they be found crucifying Christ: And as for them, they are
faulted; but the Christ, the Spirit, the Grace, the faith, they have departed
from, and crucify, is not faulted, but remains the same still, in which all
abiding, are safe: So that this place, and all Scripture testify the faith
here set forth to be the true justifying and saving faith. And Mr. Owen
confesses it wrought by the Spirit, and really true in its kind; And that men
may abide in it, or men may fall away from it: And Scripture testifying but one
kind of faith, the controversy is ended the cause is yielded, it is not for
this faith, but some by-opinion, to mantain the honor of a party, that he
contendeth: And yet that it seem not so, many mixtures were put in here, that
are no parts of, nor ingredients in faith at all. To make this appear as not
right, that so another may be set forth, and I shall consider that also.

1. THe Saints then, or Believers, of whom alone our Discourse is, may be
delineated, by these few considerable concernments in their Saintship.

2. Romans 8.28, 29 Act. 13.48. Ephesians. 1.4. 1 Pet. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
That whereas by Nature they are the children of wrath as well as others, and
dead in trespasses and sins; That faith and holiness, which they are in due
time invested withal, whereby they are made believers and Saints, and
distinguished from all others what ever, is an effect and fruit of, and flows
from Gods eternal purpose, concerning their salvation or election, Tin 1.1.
their faith being as to the manner of its bestowing, peculiarly of the
operation of God; And as to its distinction from every other gift, 2 Pet. 1.1.
Romans 8.11. Ephesians 1.19, 20. and 2, 1-5.6, 8, 10. Mat. 7.17, and 12, 13 Gal 2 20 1 John 5.12 2 Cor. 5.17 1 Thessalonians. 5.23 Gal. 5, 22, 23 1 John 3.9 Ephesians. 2.10. 1 Pet.

that upon any account, what ever is so called, in respect of its fountain
termed, The faith of Gods Elect.

2. For the manner of their obtaining of this precious Faith, it is by Gods
giving to them, that holy Spirit of his, whereby he raised Jesus from the dead,
to raise them from their death in sin, to quicken them unto newness of life,
endowing them with a new life, with a spiritual, gracious and supernatural
habit, spreading it self upon their whole souls, making them new creatures
throughout (in respect of parts) investing them with an abiding principle,
being a natural genuine fountain of all those spiritual acts, works and duties,
which he is pleased to work in them, and by them of his own good pleasure.

3. That the holy and blessed Spirit which effectually and powerfully works
this change in them, is bestowed upon them, as a fruit of the purchase and
intercession of Jesus Christ, to dwell in them, and abide in them for ever;
Upon the account of which inhabitation of the Spirit of Christ in them, they
have union with him, i. e. one and the same Spirit, dwelling in him the head,
and them the members.

4. By all which as to their actual state and condition, they are really
changed from death to life, and from darkness to light, from an universal habit
of uncleanness unto holiness, and from a state of enmity, stubbornness, and
rebellion, etc. into a state of love obedience, delight, etc. And as to their
relative condition, whereas they were children of wrath, under the curse and
condemning power of the Law. They are upon the score of him, who was made a
curse for them, and is made righteousness to them, accepted, justified,
adopted, and admitted into that family of heaven, and earth, which is called
after the Name of God.

These alone are they of whom we treat of whose state and condition,
perseverance is an inseparable adjunct, etc. So far he.

For his stating the question about perseverance, what that is, I do not meddle
with, it may be consented in of all hands; But for the faith and Saintship, I
shall consider it, because he begins and ends his discourse or description of
these, with setting them forth, as those alone of whom the discourse is: Also
having before confessed not to stand for the former kind of faith: And this he
has set forth, is in such dark and unscripture-like language (though many be
quoted) that let but the mixtures, put in about the former kind of faith,
believers and Saints. Confessed, True in its kind, be removed, as being no
parts of it, as they are not: And there is nothing in this description, that
will stand, but what is found in that, which will appear in every particular of
his mentioned concernments, and what is that then contended for; let them be
considered, and the rather, because there is but one true kind of faith, and
all else false. I desire therefore the Concernments may every one be considered
according to Scripture, and Scripture Language, without prejudice.

CHAP. XV.
Of Mr. Owen his first Concernment.

1. HE says these Saints and believers, Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3.
By nature the children of wrath they are as well as others. The Text is plain,
that the Apostle having said of the Gentiles, They were dead in trespasses and
sins, where in times past, they walked, etc. He says of himself, and the Jews,
That we also had our conversation among the children of disobedience, etc. And
(he says not are, but) were by nature the children of wrath even as others, or
(as some translate it) as also the rest; or as (some translate it) Naturally
the children of wrath, even as well as others: But neither the Text, nor any
translation puts in that, as the Jews conformity with the Gentiles, That they
were, even as they, dead in trespasses and sins; though that in some sense were
true of the unbeleeving Jews, Romans 11.16 Romans 3 2. and 9.4. Psa. 147.19, 20
John. 4 22. Romans 3.2. and 9, 4, 5. Ephesians 2.11, 12. Romans 3.9-19.
yet not in full sense, even as the unbeleeving Gentiles, before the Gospel was
sent to be preached to them: For the Jews were the natural branches; Not so
the Gentiles: The Jews had the Oracles, Covenants, Promises, and service of God
committed to them; Not so the Gentiles: The Jews had the worship of the true
God, among them, and so the hope set before them, and therein means more
abundantly to come in to him for receiving and enjoying the same by faith,
which the Gentiles had not: Yet these Jews not by faith coming in, Ephesians. 2.13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 3, 5, 6.9.
were no better, but disobedient, and the children of wrath even as the
Gentiles. Now by Christ the partition wall is broken down, and by the Gospel
the same privileges with greater enlargement, and more spiritual and effectual
means given to the Gentiles; yet notwithstanding, whether Jews or Gentiles,
such as are not by this Gospel and means it affords, Romans 3.9.20. and 2, 25-29.
Joh. 3.36.
gained to believe, and so converted and changed in disposition and
conversation (what ever knowledge or means they have, what ever humane
righteousness or profession they have, yet walking according to the wisdom and
will of the flesh, or according to the oldness of the letter) they in respect
of acceptance with God, and eternal life, are no better than others, but under
displeasure and wrath, and in the same danger even as others. The children of
wrath (and if here be put in dead in trespasses and sins, it will stand) even
as others.

Now the difficulty lies in what sense Nature is taken, for which I will not
strive. Let men take it in what sense by Scripture they will.

1. If by Nature be meant the first or natural birth, as men come from Adam by
propagation, and so sinners, Romans 5.12, 18, 19.
and bear his image which is common to all men. Then it overthrows the fancy of
some, a certain number of persons severed from others, before they were born,
to be an elect people to Sonship, and eternal life; for if any were so elect
as Adams sons from eternity, before the world was, then were they not born, or
by birth, The children of wrath even as others; no, there would be a great and
wide difference; in humane things men will easily discern it. If one man had by
high Treason procured on himself, and all his posterity, the sentence of
ejection from all his lands and inheritance, and of suffering for ever an
ignominious and tormenting death, being for ever put under the displeasure,
wrath and hatred of him against whom the treason was committed; and yet the
execution deferred till the Traitor have twenty children: And in the sentence
passed, this reserve, that the third, seventh, tenth, and fifteenth of that
man's children shall be freed from the execution of the sentence, and be
accepted as sons into favor with the King, and enjoy the inheritance, though
these may be born as sinful, and ill-deserving as the rest, yet can they not be
said to be born, or by birth to be the children of the wrath and displeasure of
the King, even as the other, seeing even by their very birth, the persons so
born, were appointed to such freedom, favor, and happiness, as the rest were
excluded from before they were born; but if none so provided for, but all alike
before their birth, excluded, then were they alike the children of wrath, or
else not. This Simily illustrates, the Text proves, and Mr. Owen confesses,
All are by nature the children of wrath, one even as another. And so as Adams
sons, none differenced from others by any such election, before their being, or
by a first birth.

2 If by Nature be meant the corrupt disposition, with which from our first
father we are all naturally infected, and so according to the lusts of that
disposition, what ever means were used toward us, more than other, yet we
according to the course of this world, and the motions of Satan, walked in
fulfilling the wills of the flesh, And so were by Nature the children of wrath
even as others: If we take it thus as surely also we may then it still
overthrows the forementioned fancy; for to be elect to Sonship, and
inheritance, and to be well-beloved, Isa. 42.1. with Mat. 12.18.
and under well-pleasedness, is one and the same, by our Saviors opening the
word; to be under wrath, and under compassion, may well stand together; but to
be under wrath, and well-pleasedness stands not together, nor are any that are
without Christ, and out of him, Romans 5.4. 1 Cor. 15.45, 46, 47.48. 1 Pet. 2.5,
9. 1 Thessalonians 5.3.4 Romans 9 25, 26.
chosen or elected in him; the natural man is first, the spiritual afterward,
as with the head, so with the members: who are the elect and chosen, is
foredeclared; and they, when elect, are not children of wrath even as others,
nor as themselves sometimes were; so that in this saying, he has intimately
confessed the truth of their belief, he professedly opposes.

2. He says, That faith and holiness which in due time they are invested
withal, whereby they are made Believers and Saints, and distinguished from all
others what ever, is an effect, and fruit of, and flows from Gods eternal
purpose, concerning their salvation, and election.

The faith and holiness of those forementioned, 1 John 4.14. Joh. 3.16, 17.
wants nothing of this; Was it not the purpose of God in sending forth his Son
the Savior of the world, That the world through him might be saved? And was it
not in the same purpose of God, Act. 26.17, 18, and 3.26. Joh. 3.14, 15, 16.
and 15.26, and 16, 14, 15 1 Pet. 1.20, 21
That his Son having in man's nature dyed for our sins, and risen for our
justification, etc. should be preached, To turn men from darkness, to light,
that whoever believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life? Is
not this Jesus, He of whom the holy Spirit testifies, and the things of whom
he shows, and so in glorifying him draws men to believe in him? And are not
those so brought to believe in him, believers indeed, and Saints by calling?
And is not this faith produced by the love of God, commended in giving his Son
to dye for our sins, and fastened on Christ the foundation, receiving remission
of sins, Rom 5.8.10
and spiritual quickening, through believing on him: According to the purpose of
God? Is there any purpose of God for sending his holy Spirit to witness of
Christ, to work any other kind of faith, than this of the right kind, or is
there any faith in Christ of the Spirits working, that is not according to the
purpose of God; does he speak of himself, or work otherwise than as proceeding
from the Father and the Son? And are not these believers in their coming into
Christ, distinguished thereby, from all that are unbeleevers, and of the world
what ever? And who will say, It is questionable, whether the holy Spirit thus
bringing any to believe in Christ, be an effect and fruit of, and flowing from
the grace, love, and purpose of God concerning their salvation, even that in
believing they might be saved? But these things have been often at large
cleerlyshewn and proved before; nor does Mr. Owen here say, This faith is a
fruit of election; he knows that with more show of truth it might be said
election is a fruit of this faith; but yet that is not a good and right
expression neither; but the testimony of the holy Ghost is, That they were
chosen through the sanctification of the Spirit, 2 Thessalonians. 2.13, 14.
and the belief of the Truth, to which they were called, etc. which is already
fore-shewn; And here yielded in this saying concerning their salvation or
election, making these two terms in a sort, signifying the same thing, and so
election a part of the salvation wrought in them and upon them, and so the
faith the same set out, Heb. 6.

3 He says, Their faith being as to the manner of its bestowing peculiarly of
the operation of God.

This agrees well with that set forth, Heb. 6.1, 2,, 4, 5. It was God sure that
in love gave his Son to do that for us, in and by which he is the complete
object of faith: And Jesus Christ, in, and through whom God commends his love
to us, is God, even one and the same God blessed for ever: And the Holy Ghost
that proceeds from the Father and the Son, is one and the same God, with the
Father and the Son, and that the Father and the Son is: And he discovering and
drawing on Christ the foundation, and so illuminating and affording tastes of
the heavenly gift as the effects, repentance from dead works, and faith toward
God, This is certainly both his peculiar operation, and the operation of God.
And to deny this under any surmise of an unknown purpose or election, were to
derogate from the grace of God, even of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, as if their works in this kind, were not truly saving, and gracious,
which I hope none will say; so that this faith abides still right.

4. He says, And as to its distinction from every other gift, that upon any
account what ever, is so called, in respect of its fountain, termed, The faith
of Gods elect.

Surely the faith so set forth, Heb. 6.1, 2, 4, 5. is even so in respect of any
other gifts upon any account, by men called Faith; Ephesians. 4.4, 5. and 2.8.
For in Scripture, we find but one true faith, and that is the gift of God.
The object held forth, for faith one, the Gospel discovering it, one; and the
Spirit witnessing and calling in that Gospel to that object, one; his light and
motion, Pages 217, 218
from the free grace of God discovered, drawing to believe in Christ, draws
into one, and works one faith, and there is not another, as is shown before.
As for that in Tit. 1.1. the Apostie was setting forth to Titus the Grace of
his Apostleship. And in, and according to what it was to be exercised, To. 1.1,
2, 3, 4, 5. and 16.25.26. Ephesians. 1.3 12. Gal. 1.11, 12. Tit. 1.1. Isa 43, 1. Mat.
12.18. Gal. 2.20. Romans 1.5. and 16, 26.
uttering in few words, that he did to the Romans in more words, and to the
Ephesians, and to the Galatians, and other Churches. And so here by Gods elect
is primely meant, Jesus Christ who is Gods elect, and his beloved Son: And so
the faith of Gods elect, and the faith of the Son of God, is all one and the
same faith: And by faith is here meant primely, The doctrine of Faith, in which
Jesus Christ is set forth, and this preached for the obedience of faith, that
men might believe it, and so come in to the acknowledgement of the truth, which
is after godliness in the hope of eternal life, which is set forth in this
Gospel. 2 These. 2.14. Gal. 1.23.
This the same faith, which Paul, when Saul, sometimes persecuted; and after
his conversion preached, so that we have here plainly set forth to us;

1. The testimony of Christ, who is Gods elect, his Son. The Word our Savior,
and the medium, and Doctrine setting him forth in these words, The faith of
Gods elect.

And 2. Joh. 3.14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
The repentance, from dead works, and faith toward God, which it calls to,
teaches, requires, and works, 2 Cor. 5.19, 20, 21. Romans 1.1-3, and 16, 25,
26.
in these words, The acknowledging of the truth, which is after godliness.

And 3. The blessing and hope in such repenting and believing to be met and
enjoyed, in these words, In hope of eternal life, etc. Is not this the same
with that in other places: And is not this that which God promised before the
world began, before there was any beginning of increase or society for
multiplication, only creatures made, and man fallen? God then promised the
sending of his Son, and this manifestation of him, and eternal life in him, and
so by him to call and give eternal life in him, 2 Timothy 1.10, 1 Pet. 1.20, 21. 1 John 1.2, 3, and 5.10, 11, 12. Col. 1.26, 27, 28. Ephesians 3.3-9. Romans 16.26.
and through him, to all that believe in him. And now God has manifested this
in sending forth his Son, and through Gospet-preaching declared, and made it
known, that men might believe, and in believing have eternal life. And this the
very same so set forth and expressed in many other places; so that here is the
complete object and foundation of faith. Gods elect, the medium of declaring
the word manifested through preaching; The true believing: The acknowledgement
of the truth, which is after godliness; And the blessed hope given and received
in such believing; The hope of eternal life, and the ground of the certainty of
this hope; The Almighty that is All-sufficient, God that cannot lie, that is
Truth it self, he has promised it, even when mankind was fallen in enmity and
weakness before the beginning of any increase, or rising; and has since
confirmed it by oath to Abraham: Genesis 3.15. and 22.17, 18. Isa. 55 14, 5.
And he has given a testimony of his love, truth and righteousness in
beginning to fulfill his word, in that he has sent forth his Son, and delivered
him up for us all, and according to his will and command causes the same to be
preached.

Now when any through this testimony of God concerning his Son, what he laid
aside, what he became, and suffered for us, what he is, and is become, and has
to bestow on us. And so the love of God to mankind appearing through him, Romans
4.23, 24, 25. and 5.1, 2, 3. 2 These. 2.13, 14 1 Pet. 1.2. and 2, 3, 5, 9.
is thereby convinced and brought in to believe in Jesus Christ, the elect of
God, so as he is therein broken off from all other confidences and delights, to
confide in God that raised Christ from the dead through him, to save, renew,
and preserve them in and by his grace, to eternal life through this belief of
the truth, and sanctification of the Spirit, they are chosen into union and
fellowship with Christ, and conformity to him; These are in, 2 Pet. 1.1. Tit.
1.4. Jude 3. Tit. 1.9. and 2.2 11, 12, 13.14. and 3.4, 5, 6, 7.
and through Christ the elect of God; and have the like precious faith with the
Apostles: And thus was Titus Paul's son, after the common faith, which is also
called, The common salvation, and the faith which was once delivered to the
Saints: The faithful word to be holden fast: The faith that believers are to be
sound in, explicated to Titus in the foundation and teachings of it: And in the
manner and gracious ends of its operation, where the fountain, streams,
effects, and hope, are expressed, and opened, so as we may be sure, This is that
common salvation, common faith; The faith once delivered to the Saints called
also, The faith of the Son of God; Gal. 2.20. Romans 3.3. Act. 14.24. Jam 2.1.
Rev. 14.12. Phil. 1.27.
The faith of Gods elect; yea the faith of God, and the faith of Christ, the
faith of our Lord Jesus; And the faith of the Gospel. And I hope none will say,
This is Gods peculiar manner of believing, or Christ his believing, or the
Gospels believing, nor that the faith of Gods elect, was the peculiar manner of
believing in Christ, distinct from others believing in Christ, which Paul
sometime persecuted, and now preached, and yet no record of it; so that this of
Tit. 1.1, 2, 3, 9. agrees in one and the same faith set forth, Heb. 6.1, 2, 4,
5. And for this that God did from eternity elect a certain number of men that
were to come of Adam, from the rest of mankind, to Sonship and eternal life,
and that he gave these to Christ to dye for them, and that these shall in due
time be invested with a peculiar faith and holiness, and that by his Spirit
witnessing of Christ, he will work a faith and holiness really true in its
kind, in others of the sons of men, for whom Christ dyed not, when such as
have it cannot be eternally saved by it, but are capacitated thereby to sin
against the Holy Ghost, which in falling away they do; and though they abide in
this faith, yet they cannot be saved. That first mentioned faith flowing from
such an election and purpose of God concerning their persons, is the faith of
Gods elect. This I say, Paul never taught, nor is there any one line in
Scripture to affirm it; the Spirit of God leads no man so to believe or speak
it, is quite and directly cross to his Testimony, as is shown at large, Part.
2. Chap. 9. Page 87, 88, 89. and Part. 4. Chap. 10. and 11. So that the faith
here commended is the same with that Heb. 6.4, 5. And as for Romans 8.28. how it
speaks the same thing, and not a word for this reproved fancy is shown before
at large. See Part. 4. Chap. 6, 7, 8.
And so likewise is that Act. 13.48. in Part. 5. Chap. 6. Page 317, 318. So
that Ephesians. 1 4. is likewise shown to make nothing for it, Part. 3. Chap. 12.
Page 221. And that 1 Pet. 1.2, 3, 4, 5. speaks not of an eternal purpose of God
concerning some certain persons of Adams sons, in a decree to elect and
eternally save them; but of the manner of the election of such as were already
actually elected, viz. That it was through the sanctification of the Spirit
unto the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus, 2 Thessalonians 2.13.
expressed elsewhere, The belief of the truth in which that sprinkling is
received. This election being according to the foreknowledge, or
fore-approbation of God, who has foreappointed, and approved this way for
electing and choosing such as believe his Testimony, as is at large shown on
Romans 8.28. Part. 4. Chap. 6. and 7. and 8. So that this Concernment has gained
nothing for any other kind of faith, than that he confessed at first true in its
kind; I would he had not cast it by.

CHAP. XVI.
Of his second Concernment.

1. HE says for the manner of their obtaining this precious faith, it is by
Gods giving to them that holy Spirit, etc. In this I shall note three things,
in which it is pretended to be not only peculiar, but of another, and better
kind than the former, true in its kind.

1. He says, It is by giving that Holy Spirit of his, whereby he raised Jesus
from the dead, to raise them from their death in sin, to quicken them unto
newness of life.

In this first saying, we have two things to note in the manner of true
believers obtaining faith, viz.

First, What God gives unto them, and that is that same holy Spirit of his, by
which he raised Jesus from the dead.

And secondly, The end for which God gives this holy Spirit to them, and that
is to raise them from their death in sin; to quicken them unto newness of life,
both which are very true, and will by all true believers, be so confessed, yet
the asserting it, as a peculiar manner of obtaining faith, that is of a better
kind than that, mentioned, Heb. 6.4, 5. and another manner of obtaining also,
and leaving out something needful in this business to be mentioned, is
blameworthy; For,

1 God for calling any to the faith, does not send forth, or give any other
spirit, nor is there any other spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son,
than that holy Spirit, by which he raised Jesus from the dead; This Spirit is
called his Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Grace. 1 Pet. 3.19,
20. Act 7.51.
By this Spirit Christ preached in the ministration of Noah, and of the
Prophets, whence those that resisted his inlightnings, and teachings in those
ministrations, are said to have been disobedient to, and have resisted the Holy
Ghost: And now more abundantly, since the sufferings, and ascension of Christ,
he does in the ministration of the Gospel, inlighten, call, convince, etc.
whence those that shut their eyes, and refuse, and despise, are said to despise
God: 1 These. 4.7, 8. Heb. 10.29.
And they that after they have received the knowledge of the truth, do
willingly tread under foot, the Son of God, and count the blood of the Covenant
as an unholy thing, are said to have done despite to the Spirit of Grace, i.e.
If it had not been the holy Spirit they had resisted, their sin had not been so
grievous; It is not good to devise pleas for wicked men, to extenuate their
sin. And though there be a Spirit of truth, and a spirit of error, yet truth is
one, and the Spirit of truth is one, 1 John 4.1-6. 1 Cor. 12.4.11 2 Cor.
11.4.13.14, 15. 1 Cor 12.2, 3.
though his gifts be diverse, and the Spirit of truth comes only from God and
Christ; And no other spirit, but error is diverse and many, and the spirit of
error is manifold and various, and proceeds not from God, but from the Devil.
Nor can any man attain any true kind of faith, but by the Holy Ghost; yea that
faith mentioned, Heb. 6.1, 2, 4, 5. was attained by the illumination of the
Holy Ghost, and they were made partakers of the Holy Ghost. And to ascribe to
the Spirit the working of a faith of Christ dying, and by his blood having made
peace, such as shall cause light, love, joy, and fill the soul with such hope
of eternal life, as shall ravish the heart of a man, and inwardly and outwardly
change him: And yet that Christ dyed not for that man, or that there is no
eternal life in him for that man, nor truth, or reality in Gods intentions to
give it him. Oh! ye heavens be astonished, and let the earth tremble at this,
that any should say thus of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of truth, or that God
should have two Spirits, one to work this faith, which yet cannot be true in
any kind, and a better Spirit to work a better kind of faith; His Spirit is
one, and holy, and all his operations to bring any to believe, like himself,
true, real, holy, and of the right and saving kind, though many resist, and
some depart. So that this line of truth, was in this business not well brought
forth, seeing it was to oppose another line of truth, and to obscure the truth
of the holy Spirits operations.

2. The object discovered, and medium used by the Holy Ghost, for bringing any
to this faith, and effecting this end mentioned, is here slighted and left
out: That is Christ and him crueified, as set forth in the Gospel for sinners,
to look to and believe in; For this is certain, first, That this holy Spirit
testifies of Christ, witnesses of his death, resurrection, sacrifice,
exalts, and glorifieth him, as the Son of God, the Savior of the world, Joh.
15.26, and 16, 7, 8-15. Act. 5.31, 32.
the Prince and Savior that gives repentance and remission of sins to Israel,
and is a light to the Gentiles, and Gods salvation to the ends of the earth.
And that whosoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins. 1 John
1.1, 2, 3. and 2, 2. and 2.6, 9, 10, 14.16. and 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 12
This Jesus, and the things of him, does the Holy Ghost witness, discover, and
glorify, and no other thing to bring men to the faith; It is not the holy
Spirit that speaks of himself, or that gives any other thing to bottom faith
upon, or sleights the foundation: And all true faith also is by hearing, by
hearing the word of the grace of God through Christ, Faith is by hearing, Romans
10.15.17.
and hearing by the word of God. The Spirit is received by the hearing of
faith; Gal. 3.1, 2, 3.
yea the holy Commandment delivered to them, who after turned from it, was
through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus; 2 Pet. 2.20, and 1, 2, 3.
1 Pet. 1.20, 21.
even the same way, which they that abode in the faith attained it; So by the
knowledge of Christ, the foundation, and the oracles of God therein, teaching
the principles with the holy Spirit inlightning; the Hebrews obtained their
faith; So that as there is but one faith, so it is attained by one Spirit, Heb.
6.1, 2, 4, 5
and that coming in one way through Christ, and witnessing the grace that is
through him; so that there is no other true kind of faith, but that at first
confessed true in its kind, and to be set forth in Heb. 6.1, 2, 4, 5.

And let his Quotations be read, and considered, and they say no other, 2 Pet.
1:1. Peter affirms, not of some peculiar among believers, but of them all to
whom he wrote, That they obtained like precious faith with them, through the
righteousness of God, and our Savior Jesus Christ. See Part 5. Chap. 1.
Sure the righteousness of God is in, and through Christ; he promised him, and
promised to assist, raise, glorify him, That he should call, etc. And God in
his righteousness has done this, and according to promise, as he has accepted
his sacrifice, and will accept, etc. all that believe on him. And the
righteousness of Jesus Christ being in his oneness of will with the Father, to
perform all that he undertook for men, and has undertaken for believers, as in
his oblation, intercession, and coming again; in all which is the righteousness
of God and Christ. And through the knowledge of this, the Apostles say, 2 Pet.
1.2, 3.
they received, and desire multiplying of grace to the believers the same way;
so as (which in the saying was left out) the Spirit calls tenders, inlightens,
and works faith in giving forth the knowledge of the righteousness of God, and
of our Lord Jesus Christ; So all that through that knowledge are brought to
believe in Christ, have the same precious faith which the Apostles had; and no
other kind of faith, nor manner of obtaining; is commended by Peter.

3 The end he says for which God gives his holy Spirit, is very right and
true; but the limiting it to some certain peculiar, yea unknown, and
undemonstrable persons, is not right, nor according to truth; nor I hope, will
any say, God gives his holy Spirit, Joh. 3.17, and 12 47. 1 Timothy 1.15 Act
26.17, 18. 2 Cor. 5.19, 20 Act. 14.17. Romans 2.4. Job 33. Prove. 1.23. Joh. 16.29.
to work some kind of faith in any, and not for this end here mentioned. The
end of God in giving and sending his Son into the world, was not to condemn,
but to save the world even sinners. The end of Christ his sending his servants
with the Gospel to men, Is to open their eyes, and turn them from darkness to
light, etc. To reconcile their hearts by the reconciliation wrought in Christ;
yea his mercies and chastisements both, have the same end. So that we may be
fully assured, that Gods end in sending his Spirit in the Gospel, is to save,
convince, and so turn the heart, etc. so that a difference of one kind of faith
from another, cannot be proved by a different end of Gods sending forth his
holy Spirit.

But it may be replied, The term in this sentence, is more than sending: It is
Gods giving his holy Spirit.

To which I answer, Joh. 6.27.29.32, 33.
That such a difference in the terms makes none in the thing; For where God is
sending the Gospel, and demonstrating by it, the life in Christ, and calling to
it; He is then, and therein, so giving the true bread of life.

But it will be said, the sentence speaks of more than giving his holy Spirit
to such an end, even also of effecting the end, endowing them with a new life.

I answer, This implies receipt in them to whom given. But receipt, may be in
some men that are receivers: Not to one and the same end, That it is in God the
giver. Truth, with the love of the Truth to save. 2 Thessalonians. 2.18.
Extended and given to some men to that end to save, but some however receiving
to profess, and make some use of, yet they received it not to save them. And
that such do not unfainedly believe, and so have not any right kind of saving
and justifying faith will be granted, though such, and no other, was tendered
and given, if they had received it, in suffering the love of truth to save
them. But for such as have so far received the Spirit, that they are even by
the Spirit affirmed, To be in the grace of Christ; To have received the Spirit
of Gods Son, and to be Sons; yea to have known God, Gal. 1.6. and 3.1, 2, 3.
and 4, 6, 7, 8. and 5.1.
and to be known of God, and to be in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us
free. Surely their faith was of the right kind. And yet of these the Apostle
speaks after they were endued with all this, as if some of them were removed
from him that called them into the grace of Christ, unto another Gospel, which
was not another, but a perversion, Gal. 1.6, and 3.3 and 4.9, 11.
etc. seeking to be made perfect by the flesh, Turning again to weak and
beggarly elements; insomuch that the Apostle was afraid of them, lest he had
bestowed his labor in the Gospel on them in vain; And testified to them, that
whosever of them were (so turned back to be) justified by the law, and 5.4.
Christ was become of no effect to them, they were fallen from grace. And this
was a more applicatory charge than that in Heb. 6.4, 6. and grounded upon that,
which is undoubtedly found in abiding believers; Gal. 5.5, 6.
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith; for in
Jesus Christ, neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but
faith which works by love: The persuasion of which abiding in the Hebrews,
Heb. 6.4, 6, 8, 9, 10.
withheld him from such a personal charge on any of them, and led him to
mollify the harshness of his reproof in the supposition: So that in all this
saying of Mr. Oven, No other kind of faith, or other manner of obtaining it,
by other manner of giving the holy Spirit, than that set forth, Heb. 6.1, 2, 4,
5. is proved; nor yet by his quotations, Romans 8.11. is spoken to them whom he
had affirmed, The called of Jesus Christ, Romans 1.6, 7, 8, and 8, 9.
Beloved of God, Called Saints: To, and of whom he says, Ye are not in the
flesh, but in the spirit; If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. (Mind,
he speaks not of an once, or for a time, having been in them, that was out of
question, but of an abiding, or dwelling as a governor in an house.) Now if any
man have not the Sprit of Christ, (Mind, he says, not has had; so that its no
error to say what ever he had heretofore, Romans 8.10.
as to the Galathians, chapter 3.3, 4. and 5, 7, 8.) he is none of his, And if
Christ be in you (that is by this abiding of the Spirit, or his dwelling in you
preserving confidence in Christ, etc. just as he said to the Hebrews, chap.
3.6.14.) the body is dead because of sin (sin that brought in death, which
though over come by Christ, yet is not removed, till his time, from off men,
all must once dye, nor will it be wholly removed from believers while any sin
abides in them, though it rule not in them, so as their bodies are yet mortal,
and so but heavy instruments to be used in spiritual services, and must once
dye) but the Spirit is life because of righteousness; Col. 2.12, 13. and 3.9,
10. Ephesians. 4.21, 23, 24, Romans 7.22, 24. Romans 7.22. Gal. 5.16, 22, 24. Joh. 7.37,
38, 39.
the spirit opposed to the body, that is the inward man, the new man; or
Christ-like mind or disposition effected in the heart, by the Spirit of Christ
quickening them in, and through believing in Christ, to receive forgiveness of
them sins and so enlivening, etc. This is life, even a living principle,
derived from Christ, in whom believing this principle derived from Christ, in
whom believing this principle is effected and preserved, and it is living in
faith, confidence, hope, love, and joy; yea it is life, affording living
springs and motions; And this for righteousness sake; Romans 5.18.
that is, for Christ his sake, who is risen from the dead, and has by one
righteousness, obtained in himself life for all men, and power to raise all
men. And that such as receive this grace and gift by grace given in, and
through Christ, Grace may reign in them through righteousness unto eternal life
by Jesus Christ; Romans 5.21, 17.
and they shall reign in life by Christ.

And because of the righteousness of God in Christ, and the righteousness of
Christ in his mediation by virtue of his oblation, and in sending forth his
Spirit according to his promise to such end. The Spirit of the believer is
inlived, Romans 8.23.
yea life, And so they receive a first fruits of the Spirit in this life, and
wait for the adoption, the redemption of their body to be at the coming of
Christ. And to comfort not some peculiar among them, but all the believing
Romans, with the certainty, and the way to enjoy the certainty of all this, he
says to them, But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead,
Romans 8.11.
dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your
mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you. Mind these words, he said
before, If Christ be in you, the body is dead, etc. But the Spirit is life,
etc. And now he says again, But if the Spirit of him, etc. dwell in you (abide
as a governor) if so, Then he that raised up Jesus from the dead, shall also
quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit, Romans 6.29. and 7, 4, 6. 2 Timothy 2.11.
etc. that is apt to enlive them to be instruments of righteousness for you to
serve with here in newness of life, and spirit, and raise them up again when
dead, by his Spirit that dwells in you; and so by virtue of your union with
Christ, abiding in this faith of him, 1 Thessalonians, 4.14, 15.
and his Spirit quickening your mortal bodies living and dying in this faith; He
will raise you again in the same union with him in which you slept: So that all
the way here is no other kind of faith set forth, nor other language of giving
Spirit, etc. used, then to the Collossians, as also to the Galathians and
Hebrews, Col. 1.21, 22, 23. Ephesians. 1.16.17.
as afore-shewn Ephesians. 2.19. in respect of their knowledge speaks not of what
they yet enjoyed, but of what the Apostle desired for them; and the power of
God, is as himself one and the same, though the manner and degrees of his
putting it forth be diverse. As without a Mediator (though by him that now is
the Mediator) in the first, now old Creation; It was the same power by which he
made the heaven and the earth, and man upon it, by which also he caused the
grass to grow, etc. but whether with like force put forth, I determine not; But
of this I am sure, the infinite greatness of this power, is beyond the
comprehension of any mortal man. Also his power as put forth through a
Mediator, for upholding and ordering all the old Creation for its time, and
rules for ever by his power; It is one and the same power, ^ Joh. 1.3. Psalm
75.3. and 66.7.
by which he upholds the heaven and the earth, and preserves man and beast,
and orders the fowls and flies, and growing of grass, etc. But whether alike
put forth for every of these, I determine not: But of this I am sure, the
infinite greatness of this power is not fully known by any mortal man. And now
for his power as put forth, not only through a Mediator, but to unite and
conform to him; and so to effect and set forward the New Creation that is begun
and complete in himself, and to be completed in, and for all his New
Creatures, in which, as in the Resurrection of Christ that dyed for sinners,
the power of his wisdom, mercy, truth, faithfulness and strengh, did most
abundantly shine forth, so in this work of uniting and conforming to him, it is
most abundantly dispensed, and known, and met with. And this power thus put
forth, is ever one and the same power, Even that by which he raised Jesus from
the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above
all principality and power, and might, and every name that is named, not only
in this world, Ephesians. 1.20.21, 22, 23. Ephesians. 1.19.
but also in that which is to come: And has put all things under his feet, and
given him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is his body, etc.
This the power here spoken of: But whether this power be in this manner alike
put forth at all times, to every one to whom it is extended, as To convince, to
draw to believe, To preserve in the faith, To uphold in temptation, To raise
from the dead, To meet Christ in the air, I make no determination: But I do not
believe that so it is, because neither the Scripture, nor experience of any
believer, so testifies; But of this I am sure, That every one that believes
in Christ, according to the working of this his mighty power (in which is some
distinctness intimated between this mighty power, and the working of it.) He
that believes according to the working, or forth-putting of the operation of
this his mighty power, whether more or less put forth too, and in him, he is
accepted as a true believer in him, and of that Church whereof he is the head,
in whom all the fullness is. Ephesians. 6.10. 1 Pet. 1.5.
And the exceeding greatness of his power is for, and toward such: And so not
the present working of it, or operation in them, but the exceeding greatness of
this his mighty power that is in him, which he desired they might know, is
propounded to all the believers, one and other, that they might believe in it,
and be strong in it, that so by it they might be kept through faith unto
salvation: Yet notwithstanding what the exceeding greatness of this his mighty
power is, toward such believers: All such believers do not know clearly, which
if they did, it would afford them unspeakable consolation, though the full and
perfect knowledge of it, is not in any mortal man, nor will so be, in believers
till the resurrection of the just; no more than the greatness of the hope, or
that hoped for, to which he called them, or the riches of the glory of his
inheritance in the Saints, though growing in faith, and in the knowledge of our
Lord Jesus they by his spirits illumination be sweetly, and in a measure
clearly, and in respect of the first beginning of faith, abundantly known,
which the Apostle acknowledging these to be believers, sealed, and faithful in
Christ; intimates them to be yet wanting in, and so prays for it for them
suitable to his instructions, and exhortations to the Hebrews: So that this
place was wrong quoted for any other kind of faith, or manner of obtaining it,
serving nothing at all to such an end.

Ephesians. 2.1, 5, 6, 7, 8.10. Speaks of no other kind of faith, or manner or
obtaining it, Col. 1.23, 24, and 2.13, 14. Gal. 4.6, 7, and 3. and 5. Heb
3.1.6. etc.
or quickening in it, but of that is complete in Christ, and a first fruits
received through faith in him, which was also in those mentioned among the
Collossians and Galatians, and Hebrews, to whom those great warnings were
given, and so not at all to the purpose quoted, for another manner of obtaining
faith.

CHAP. XVII.
Of Mr. Owens second saying in his second Concernment.

IN explication of this New life, the holy Spirit is given to quicken them
unto; He faith, Enduing them with a new life, with a spiritual, gracious and
supernatural habit, spreading it self upon their whole souls, making them new
creatures throughout (in respect of parts) investing them with an abiding
principle.

All this soberly, Col. 1.4, 5, 22, 23, 24. and 2.13, 14. Gal. 4.6, 7. and 3.
and 5, 4. Heb. 3.1.6. and 6, 1, 2, 4, 5.
and according to Scripture understood, is very good and true. Nor is there any
kind of faith of the Spirits working, received, that can be called, True in
its kind, or upon account whereof any in Scripture are frequently termed
Saints and believers, if they be not in some measure in truth endued with this.
And all this in a good measure evidenced to be in those believers so warned,
and so in that faith and holiness affirmed to be in them, the Collossians, the
Galathians, and the Hebrews, and confessed by the many expressions used by M.
Owen in that kind of faith and holiness, which he says also is really true in
its kind, and wrought by the Spirit, as has been shown, in opening the
principles, etc. and in setting down his expressions; So that there is nothing
neither in this saying worthy the least blame or refusal, but to be received
and confessed true and good: But only, his asserting it to set forth another
kind of faith and holiness and manner of obtaining it, then besides that
before confessed by him true in its kind: And his altering and stretching out
some terms to make this faith seem to be of another kind, but neither will his
quotations or terms prove or countenance the same, or serve for that end at
all. Let his quotations be considered:

Matthew. 7.17. Every good tree brings forth good fruit, but accrrupt tree
brings forth evil fruit. Consider with this the 16, 18, 19, and 20. verses.

Matthew. 12.33. Either make the tree good and his fruit good, or else make the
tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt, for the tree is known by his fruit,
Consider with this also the 34, and 35. verses. And consider with both, James
3.10, 11, 12.

The whole weight of the business for right understanding these parabolical and
metaphorical sayings, lies in knowing what is here meant by Tree, whether the
man in the substance of his soul and body, or the ruling disposition in the
heart of the man diffusing it self in all the powers and faculties of the soul,
or both these. And then in what manner the one, and upon what account the
other. Let these be every way considered: And so,

1 If we take the Tree simply, singly, directly, 1 King. 8.46. 2 Chronicles. 6.36 1 John 1.8, 10. Mar. 10, 17, 18 Heb. 9.5. Luke 20.36.
and properly for the man, in the substance of his soul and body; then as all
are naturally come forth from fallen Adam, so we fell in him, and come forth
corrupt from him, so there is no man living on this earth, sinless and good;
yea there never was a man living on this earth, good indeed but one, that is
the man Jesus Christ, who is God over all blessed for ever; So that in this
sense there neither is, nor will be found upon the earth any good man, that may
answer to those Texts, till the resurrection of the just, and then there will
be such found. So this is not the sense.

2 If we take Tree for the disposition ruling in man, which is neither the
substance of soul or body, simply considered; but some infused inclination, so
as man in falling from God, lost and deprived himself of his Image; so there
was a corrupt inclination, or disposition ingendered and sprung up in his
heart, Romans 5.12. Genesis 8.21. Jer. 17.9. Romans 6.19, 20, and 7.5. Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3.
2 Cor. 4.4.
from the word, or lie of Satan, in, and by the Serpent suggested, and by man
believed, which is full of aversness and enmity to God, and prone to all that
is contrary to the mind of God, and his design, whence flows manifold evil
lusts and affections, all strengthened and revived, by a new plot of Satan in
unbeleevers, whereby he rules, and so these lusts bring forth evil fruits by
the members of the body: And because this cursed disposition was at first
begotten by Satan's lie believed, and is retained and strengthened by his
suggestions received, Rev. 12.9.
he is said to be the Deceiver of the whole world; and because of the devilish
nature of it, being heated and fired by Satan; Jam. 3.6. Matthew. 15.19.
the heart in which it dwells and rules, is compard to hell, deep, and dark;
And out of this heart, our Savior says, proceed evil thoughts, murders,
adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: And where
envying-strife, and such evil fruits are, the wisdom such profess, comes not
from above, Jam. 3.15.
but is earthly, sensual, devilish. Now this disposition is an evil root, an
evil tree; and he in whose heart this disposition has the Lordship, has an
evil treasure in his heart, and so out of it brings forth evil things: Matthew.
12.35.
And those that are one with, and under the dominion of this disposition,
having no supernatural disposition to cross and crucify this, they are upon
that account, and so long, a generation of wicked men, of vipers, and so evil
trees, Mar. 12.34. Luke 6.43.
and cannot bring forth any good fruit at all. But now on the other side, such
as from the holy Spirit testifying of Christ in the Gospel, do believe that
word or testimony of Christ, Joh. 6.33. Romans 1.16. 1 Thessalonians. 2.13.
which is Spirit and life, so as they believe on Christ, then there is by it
effected in the heart, not only a reproof and dislike of the former
disposition with its lusts, 2 Pet. 1.4, 5. 2 Thessalonians. 1.10. Romans 7.22. 2 Cor.
4.16. Ephesians. 4.22, 23. Col. 3.9, 10. Ezekiel. 36.26. 2 Cor. 3.3.18. 4 Cor. 2.16.
Joh. 3.6. 1 John 5.4. Psalm. 32.2. Joh 7.37, 38, 39. Gal. 5 17, 22, 23.
but also a new heavenly and Christian-like disposition, is from the word and
grace believed, effected in the heart, which is no part of the soul or body,
but an influence from Christ believed in, and an infusion of the Holy Ghost,
that dethrones the old disposition from its lordly power in the heart, and gets
the throne, and lordly power in the heart it self; and this is called an inward
man, a new man, a new heart, a new spirit, the Spirit and mind of Christ. And
this Spirit or disposition is born of the Spirit, and so of God, and so is
Spirit, and divine power is in it, and it overcomes the world; and in it is no
guile, and it is full of heavenly springs, and holy and spiritual lusts,
according to the mind of God; So that this is a good tree, and brings forth
good fruit, and cannot bring forth any evil fruit. And he that has this
disposition in his heart, has a good treasure in his heart, Mat. 7.18. and
12.35.
and out of the abundance of the good treasure in his heart, brings forth good
things: And upon this account.

3 As a man is one with, and under this new and spiritual disposition, in which
by faith Christ dwells in his heart, he, even the man also, so far is born of
God: Joh. 1.13. 2 Cor. 5.17. 1 John 2.28. and 3.5, 9.
And upon this account, a new creature, and so far does righteousness, and
sins not. And so far in such a sense, a good tree, and brings forth good
fruit, and not evil.

But then this last is to be understood according to the expression, and with
such cautions, as the Scripture has given us thereabout.

For the man that is a believer, cannot be said to be a good tree, and that he
cannot bring forth evil fruit, in so full a sense, as the unbeleever is called
an evil tree, and that he cannot bring forth good fruit, because the unbeleever
is under the power of the evil disposition, and has not the supernatural
heavenly disposition in him; And so what light or motions soever flash upon
him, yet he is in the flesh, and minds the things of the flesh, and walks
after the flesh, and cannot please God: But the believer, though he be from
under the lordly power of the evil disposition, and the new and supernatural
disposition has got the seat in his heart, and so the commanding power, yet
the evil disposition remains in his members and faculties still, Gal. 5.17.
Romans ^.14.^4.
and so they are both in him, the one lusting and warting against the other: so
as the believer cannot do as, and what he would, so that though the new
disposition be a good tree, and can bring forth none but good fruit, ^om. 7.14,
15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 25.
yet the believer himself is under a double consideration; One, as man having
the old disposition in him, with its lustings, through which he is hindered and
captived, and so sometime with the flesh serving the law of sin and death, and
there he cries, I am carnal, etc. And again, as he is a believer having the new
disposition in him, with its lusts, and he under the power of it, and so free;
and so there is I, and I my self, and I according to the inward man, and I with
my mind do serve the law of God, but with my flesh, etc. And so far as with
his mind he serves the law of God, and walks after the Spirit, so far he is a
good tree, and brings forth good fruit. And that he may so do still; there
are two things taught him by Grace.

1 That he hold fast his esteem, and minding of, and confidence in Christ, Joh.
13.1.11. Romans 7.25. and 8.2. Gal. 2.20. Gal. 5.16, 18, 23, 24, and 6.8. Romans 6.
and 8.1^, 13. and 12.1, 2. Gal. 5.16, 18, 24 and 6.8. Ephesians. 4.21, 24. Col. 1.23
and 3.9, 10, 12. Heb. 3.14. Joh. 15.7.
in whom this supernatural disposition or Spirit is, and from whom it flows
into, and in all that by faith are united to him, and not otherwise, it is not,
nor does abide in any separate from him, or turning aside from him; but as the
believer abides in him, and lives by the faith of him.

2 That by this renewing of his mind, he with the word believed, do oppose,
and resist the lusts of the flesh, and side with, sow too, and walk after the
Spirit fulfilling the motions of it; And so they shall reap of the Spirit life
ever lasting. And this is the Spirits counsel, direction, and charge given to
all believers without difference, and so is the promise given, and hope set
before them. So to the Romans, so to the Galatians, to the Ephesians, to the
Collossians, to the Hebrews, and by Christ to all his Disciples, If they abide
in him, and his word in them; If they walk after the Spirit, they shall not
fulfill the lusts of the flesh, if they walk after the Spirit they shall live,
etc. But if they sow to the flesh they shall reap corruption, if they live
after the flesh, they shall dye: But abiding in the faith, they partake of
Christ, and by his word in them they shall be fruitful, and so they shall be
good trees, and bring forth good fruit; For so they shall observe the counsel
of our Savior, Mat. 12.33.
Make the tree good, and his fruit good, etc. For we can no otherwise make the
tree good, but in believing on him, and according to grace given, yielding to
the teachings of his Spirit.

And seeing every good and perfect giving comes from him, and that his Spirit
is good, and his operations and fruits good, and that an evil tree cannot bring
forth good fruit; what are all those confessed works of the Spirit, and whence
flows that faith and holiness really true in its kind, upon account whereof,
men are called Believers, and Saints? What is that change of judgment,
affection, and conversation, that light, love, joy, zeal, obedience true in its
kind, sincere, and not hypocritical? whence come they to do so worthily in
their generation, and all acknowledged an effectual work of the Spirit? Can
there be such rightness even from the Spirit, and the tree not good? or is
there any other trees among believers to bring forth good fruit of another
nature? Surely if we mind the proofs and our Saviors words, they show there
is but one kind of faith, to bring forth good fruits, and this even it, set
out, Heb. 6 Gal. 2.20. This place does open that already said: The Apostle
having spoken of being justified by faith, shows how he lived not, Gal. 1.6.
and 4.6, 7. Gal. 2.13. Romans 4.4, 6, 7, 9.
but Christ lived in him, and he by the faith of the Son of God, to which he
endeavored to reduce the Galatians, whom he testifies to have received the
same faith at the first, and so exhorted the Hebrews, and shows his manner of
obtaining it to be in the same way with others.

1 John 3.12. This place has not one word of two diverse kinds of faith, or of
diverse manner of obtaining it, nor of any habit of one believer more than in
another; Joh. 1.12.
but affirms, That he that has the Son (that is believes in his name) has
life; that is, in having the Son by faith, Joh. 3.36.
He has also that eternal life that is in the Son, by faith also, which is
true of all that by grace believe in Christ.

2 Cor. 5.17. This is true of all that by faith are in Christ Jesus, who as,
and so far as they are in him, are affirmed new creatures, as is fore
explicated, though the fullness and compleatness of it is in the resurrection of
the just, but no word here of a second kind of faith, or of newness in some
true believers, that is not in other true believers, the words plain, If any
man in Christ.

1 These. 5.23. This is not an affirmation of what was yet attained, but a
prayer for what was desired, and hoped for, and so not to the purpose for which
it was quoted, unless to mollify the expressions of the saying.

Gal. 5.22.25. This place is a discovery of the fruits of the Spirit that were
in the believing Galatians, that were scarce so far grown as the Hebrews. And
what was done in believing on Christ crucified. How the flesh, with the
wisdom, and whole bent of it, with the affections, and lusts of it, were
crucified, that is made vile, condemned and begun to be mortified by the cross
of Christ, that the body of sin might be destroyed; and then an exhortation to
walk after the Spirit, Gal. 6.14. Romans 6.6.
just as to the Romans, Ephesians, Collossians, and Hebrews. And not a word of
a peculiar kind, in some believers, and not in other believers that are true
in their kind also.

1 John 3.9. This place faith not a word of any difference between believers,
some true in one kind, and some in another; Nor says it, Some that are born
of God; Nor says it, He that has been born of God; but having said before,
Whosoever abides in him, sins not. And having warned them not to be
deceived, 1 John 3.6, 7, 8, 9.
says, speaking in the present tense, He that does righteousness, is
righteous, even as he is righteous (or in his righteousness, and as he has
promised) And then having given warning against being deceived, and going on in
sin, etc. He comes to mention the abiding in him, and doing righteousness;
Again, and he does it in a third term comprehending both, saying, Whesoever is
born of God does not commit sin (that is approve and act it, See this before
^.414, and 415.
going on so to do) And that the word, Born of God, is first appliable to that
sight, belief, and acknowledgement of Christ, and so that new disposition begot
thereby in the heart, is clear in this Epistle, where this is called, That
which is born of God; 1 John 5.1, 2, 3, 4. Mat. 16, 17. Ephesians. 2.8.
Hence both faith and confession are said to be of God, and the gift of God,
and so he that in this revelation and operation of the Spirit, in, and by the
Gospel, is prevailed with to believe, and yield up to it, and so far become one
with it, so as he believes Jesus to be the Christ, and so believing in him,
confesses him to be the Lord; He also on that account, is said to be born of
God: And so likewise the being prevailed with by this grace, To hold fast this
confidence, 1 John 5.2. Ioh. 1.12, 13. Romans 10.^, and 10.
and so to abide, and go on in the faith of Christ, and love of him, and one
another, is the operation of God, and has the same promises to it; and so is
likewise called a being born of God here in 1 John 4.7, 8, and 3.5-10. And that
this is the sense here appears clearly, in that the same thing, for the same
business expressed here, Born of God, Heb. 3.1, 6, 14.
is a little before expressed by a perfect continued act, Abiding in him, 1 Ioh.
3.6, 7.
and doing righteousness; And the same there also affirmed, such sin not, such
are righteous. And also this appears to be the sense in that it is opposed to a
continued approbation, acting of, and going on in sin; for so the devil
commits sin, and sins from the beginning without repentance, or breaking
off his course; But who ever is born of God, he commits not sin (that is,
does not approve, and so commits) but abides in, and goes on, believing in
Christ, and loving him, without repentance of it, or breaking off that course.
And it farther appears that born of God is in this place, abides in Christ,
holding fast confidence in, and love of God through Christ because it is said,
His seed remains in him, that is the divine influence and Spirit of Christ,
with divine force and virtue, abides, and remains in him according to that
promise, Heb. 3.14. And this the constant language of Christ, and the Spirit of
Christ, Whosoever transgresses, and abides not in the doctrine of Christ has
not God; He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, has both the Father and
the Son; Ioh. 15.1.11. 2 Ioh. 9.
yea even of his first work of grace in changing our minds and reconciling us
to God, it is said to be, In the body of his flesh through death, to present us
holy and unblameable in his sight; If we continue in the says grounded and
settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel, of which me have
heard. Col. 1.22^23. 1 John 2.24.
Whence also it is said to these, If that which ye have heard from the
beginning shall remain in you, ye shall continue in the Father and the Son.
And so our Savior says to his own Disciples, that were clean through the word
that he had spoken to them, Abide in me, and 1 in you, Joh. 15 47.
as the branch cannot bear fruit of it self, except it abide in the vine, no
more can ye except ye abide in me; I am the Vine, ye are the branches; he
that abides in me (that is believing) and I in him (that is my word in him)
the same brings forth much fruit, etc. Suitable to like sayings of his
Spirit, and exhortations in other places: And so it is expressly said, Romans
11.22. 1 Timothy 2.17. 1 Pet. 2.3, 4, 5. Heb. 3.6.14. 1 John 3.5, 8, 9, 10. and
4.4 and 5.3, 4, 5.
If we hold fast the confidence and rejoicing of hope firm unto the end. We are
the house of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence steadfast
unto the end, then are we made partakers of Christ ( and so born of God, and
his seed remains in us) and that seed remaining being an influence from
Christ, and so stronger than the Devil that is in the world, we in believing on
God, and so yielding to it, are born of God, and so neither sin, nor can sin
because so born of God, but do overcome the world, This faith that is born of
God being the victory whereby we overcome. Romans 8.2^. Luke 20.36.
And this sense is plain and evident, and agrees with that mentioned, Heb. 6.1,
2, 4, 5, 9, 10. And yet the compleatness of being born of God is in the
resurrection of the just. And so none of the quotations countenance two kinds
of faith, or of obtaining, or of habits each true in its kind: As for degrees,
that is not in question:

Ephesians. 2.10. For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus, unto good
works, which God has before ordained (or prepared) that we should walk in
them. What this is to the purpose to show what God has given into, and wrought
in believers that are true, and in one sort or kind of them more than in
another kind true also, I see not, and suppose that none can show: Eccles.
7.29.
For when God created us all in the first Adam, it was certainly in his Image,
In uprightness, and so with furniture for good works that we might have walked
in them: But he fell and lost himself, and us all, and so we became weak, of no
strength, lost, and destitute of all furniture for any good works. But God has
created mankind anew again in Jesus Christ the second Public man, the last
Adam, who having satisfied for sin, suffered for it, and overcome death, and
ascended, and offered the acceptable sacrifice, is in man's nature glorified,
filled with the immeasurable fullness of the Holy Ghost, to send for to the
rebellious that they might come in, and to furnish, and lead all that do come
in: And he sins not, nor can he dye any more, but is alive for evermore; so
that in him we are complete and perfect, and this held forth to us, that
believing in him we might partake of his fullness, which is a good motive to
believe on Christ, and to continue so believing: And such as through the
knowledge of his grace believe in Christ, are certainly his workmanship, and
begun to be united to Christ, and this also unto good works, such as God has
prepared in him, that we should walk in them, and so live to him and this the
ground of his following exhortation, as to other Churches; Romans 5.18, 19, 20.
with 6.1, 2, etc.
but no assertion of the measure of their seize: And it being confessed
that the faith and holiness, with the effectual operation of the Spirit in all
the powers of the foul, changing judgment, affection, conversation, effecting
light, love, joy, zeal, obedience, enabling to do worthily in their generation;
Is not all this being the work of the Spirit, that is in Christ, comes from
Christ, and witnesses of Christ, his workmanship on, and in them; And are not
they his workmanship in Christ Jesus? 2 Cor. 5.14, 15
And is there not fullness of furniture in Christ Jesus for good works for them?
And is it not the gracious end of God in making it known that they should live
to Christ by walking in them. I hope none will deny it. All which justifies
this faith set forth in Hebrews 6. and gives no countenance for any other kind.

CHAP. XVIII.
Of the third saying in his second Concernment.

FOr the nature and property of this habit, or abiding principle, Thus he
says: Being a natural genuine fountain, of all those spiritual Acts, Works,
and Duties, which he is pleased to work in them, and by them, of his own good
pleasure.

Though this be not the dialect of Scripture, yet in a sober understanding, it
may be taken as agreeing thereto, but not countenancing two kinds, or a second
kind of true faith. And so with some cautions and provisoes, I shall take this
saying for true, and wholly consent thereto, that is to say thus,

1 That this abiding principle, be not understood of a thing peculiar to any
kind of faith diverse from another, true in its kind, 1 Pet. 1.13. Tit. 3.4,
5, 6, 7.
but of the same kind of faith set forth Heb. 6. faith being proved already to
be one, and so the same with that Tit. 1.1.

2 That by Natural and Genuine, be understood, that which is Supernatural and
Spiritual; Isa. 61.13.
And so apt, free, willingly and naturally inclined, and kindly putting forth.

3 That the calling this principle a fountain, be not understood as of a thing
enclosed in the believer, to himself, or any otherwise, Psalm. 36.9. Jer. 2.13.
and 17 13. Zach. 13.1. Rev. 21.6. Hos. 14.8. Joh. 15.4, 5, 6.
then as flowing from Christ, to and in him that believes in Christ, and so in
no sort derogating from Christ: For he is the fountain of life with God, and so
from God unto us, the fountain of living waters, the fountain for clensing, and
for fruits. And from that flowing from him is all that life, cleansing and
fruitfulness that is in believers: And separate from him they can do nothing;
what ever greenness or springs be in any believing on him, Jer. 2.13. and 17.
5, 6, 13. Joh. 15.4, 6.
yet if they thereby abide not in the faith of him, but turning aside, and
departing from him, they lose their principle, and wither, that remains in
Christ from whom they are departed, and cannot be retained, and found abiding,
and dwelling in any, but by, or in believing on him; so as departing through
unbeleef, Romans 11.22. Heb. 3.13.6, 14. Romans 7.2.5 and 8.2. Prove. 13.13, 14, and
6.21, 22, 23 and 14.26, 27
brings loss and perishing, but in believing on him, the dwelling (in the
heart) of this principle is enjoyed; he is the fountain, and he that believes
on him, receives from him: The law of Grace which as it comes from him, and
his Spirit in it, is called a fountain of life. And so the fear of the Lord
effected thereby, even the faith in, and love of, and adoration and
acknowledgement of God in Christ, is a fountain of life, and this upon the
account of Christ the fountain from whom the streams (bearing his name) do
flow. And in believing on whom they are received, and do operate in the
believer, even all those principles mentioned Heb. 6.1, 2, 5. All which run in
one living principle, which because of its springing and living efficacies, is
called a Spring or Well of living waters, in which from Christ believers act in
bringing forth the motions of the Spirit: Joh 4.10, 14. and 7.37.38, 39 Psalm.
68.27. Phil. 4.13. Ioh. 15.4.8.
Yet the believers being still men, and having in them another cross
inclination abiding to molest them, they need still those admonitions, Jam.
3.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Romans 8.5-13. Gal. 6.8. Heb. 3.13. and 12.15, 17, etc.

4 That the spiritual Acts, Works, and Duties, be here rightly understood, and
distinguished, and considered, that we confound not the workings of God in the
believer, inabling and moving him to work, with the workings of the believer,
in, and through the workings of God, To. 12.1, 2, 5. Phil. 2.1, 2, 12.
for so all the exhortations given, and obedience called for, and disobedience
reproved, will be made void and null; and that we may rightly understand, view
the place quoted, Philip. 2.13. For it is God that works in you both to Will,
and to Do, even of his good pleasure. He in the former verse entreated them (as
he did the Romans) even by that done by Christ, and that now in him, and
flowing from him in them. As they had always obeyed, not as in his presence
only, but now much more in his absence (so now says he to them) Work out your
own salvation with fear and prembling: 1 Ioh. 5.12. Ioh. 1.12.
Mind the words, he says not Work for, or to get salvation: Nor speaks he
only of salvation, as it is by and in Christ wrought for them, but of that, as
it is by Spirit in the Gospel, applied to, and by faith received in them, and
so it is their own. Christ, and that which is his, is made theirs; 1 Cor. 1.30.
and 3.22, 23. Romans 5.1, 2, 3-5 Tit. 4-4.7 Tit. 2.11, 12, 13.
and in believing this, they are saved, or have this salvation working within
them, like as is said in verse 12. And this salvation within them, is teaching
and working in them with motions, To deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, to
live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world, and wait for the
blessed hope, etc. Gal. 5.22, 23. Col. 3.9, 10, 12, 13. 1 Thessalonians. 5.11, 20. Romans
6.16.19. and 12.1, 2. Gal. 5.16, 25. Ephesians. 4.21.25. and 5.1, 2. Col. 3.9.12.
And therein stirring them up to live by faith in God, and so to love, joy,
peace, patience, meekness, etc. To bowels of mercy, kindness, etc. And so to
pray to, and praise God, to exhort one another, etc. Now all these are the
works of God in his grace bringing salvation: And as these mercies of God in
this salvation given you, works within you, so do ye obey, yield up your selves
as servants to righteousness. Sow to the Spirit: And so work out your own
salvation with fear and trembling; For it is God which works in you: It is he
which gave his Son for you, and made him known to you, and so enabled you by
him to believe in God, and so forgave your sins, and filled you with this
consolation of Christ, and comfort of his own love, and fellowship of the
Spirit, which by the same Spirit in the operations of this grace, moves you To
Will, to live by faith, to deny ungodliness, etc. to live soberly, etc. to
pray, etc. to show mercy, etc. And to Do; He does not say, It is God that
wills in you, that believes, prays, etc. Neither does he say in any other
sense, than as expressed, by giving light, motion, or power to Will, and to Do;
That God has given and wrought the will and the deed; But it is he that
works in you both to Will and to Do, of his good will or pleasure, so as
still to Will, and to Do, is the believers work, which he cannot do of himself,
yer in this gracious season, by this preventing grace, light, motion, and
divine power of God working within him, he may both will and do, if he yield up
to this grace; and herein is his obedience, which being with a willing mind is
accepted according to that he has. And in murmuring and withdrawing from this,
and so grieving the Spirit, and sowing to the flesh, is his disobedience that
he will be reproved and chastened for. And so in this saying, is a great and
forcible motive and encouragement to obedience, it is God that in the
operations of this salvation works in you to Will and to D^, yea he does it
of good will. So that entertaining his motions, and yielding up according to
his strength given into you, sowing to the Spirit, in willing and doing
according to his motions by his strength afforded, you have God on your si^e,
his favor, and strength is with you to accept, defend, assist, bless, and
follow on with more grace, and you shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
Gal 6.8.
And here is a forcible admonition against disobedience. It is God that by
these operations works in you, etc. If you slight, refuse, turn away, and
disobey, Psalm. 8.11. Heb. 12.25. Ephesians. 4.30. 1 Thessalonians. 4.8. and 5.19.
you slight and refuse God, you turn away from God that speaks from heaven,
and disobey God, and grieve, and resist his Spirit, and so endanger your
selves, etc. Whence suitable to all this follows that exhortation, verse. 14,
15, 16. Do all things without murmurings, etc. Suitable to all said to the
Hebrews, and like this the other quotation, 1 Pet. 1.22. Seeing you have
purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love
of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently. This
appears to be an exhortation to stir them up to such love, not an affirmation
that it would infallibly so be in, and with them; but an exhortation that it
might so be, and that neither in vain, nor needless, but useful, and bottomed
upon the same ground with that to the Philippians, 1 Pet. 1.20, 21.
they had, and did already by Christ believe in God, Phil. 2.1, 2.
and in believing or obeying the truth through the Spirit, God did lead them,
and they had purified their souls to unfeigned love, etc. like that to the
Philippians seeing this, See that you love, etc. And here is the same
encouragement as to them, being born again, etc. of incorruptible seed, etc.
And like exhortations grounded thereon. 1 Pet. 2.1.2, 3, 4.
And so this saying in this Concernment is in this sense acknowledged true, and
justifying only the faith set out, Heb. 6. In his next Concernment, I shall
consider it in both parts.

CHAP. XIX.
Of the third Concernment: The first part. thereof.

THat the holy and blessed Spirit, which effectually and powerfully works this
change in them, is bestowed upon them, as a fruit of the purchase, and
intercession of Jesus Christ, to dwell in them, and abide in them for ever.

In this first part of his saying, we have two things to note,

First, In what manner he says the holy Spirit is bestowed on them.

And secondly, To what end he says the Spirit is so given them. Consider both.

1 He says, The holy and blessed Spirit, which effectually and powerfully
works this change in them, is bestowed upon them, as a fruit of the purchase
and intercession of Jesus Christ. By them he here professedly means in every
of his Concernments; another sort and kind of believers and Saints, that have
another kind of faith and holiness, then that mentioned, Heb. 6.4, 5. or the
best of that set down, in that he calls his first kind of believers and Saints
or faith and holiness, which yet he confesses true in its kind, and wrought
by the Spirit, effectually working in all their powers of the soul etc.
Consider;

1 I hope he believes not that the holy Spirit in testifying of Christ, and
bringing some sort of men to believe, working in them, etc. does testify
falsehood, or dissemble in his operations, etc. Nor yet that there are two
kinds of Spirits, that come forth from God and Christ, to work two kinds of
faith and holiness, one kind that will fail men by one spirit in some, another
kind that will not fail by another spirit in others.

I have read of some affirming something like this. The one they say is indeed
the Spirit of God, that witnesses of Jesus that was born of the Virgin Mary,
and dyed at Jerusalem, etc. And the faith begotten hereby is very effectual in
many; yet this is but a fleshly spirit, a fleshly faith, and fleshly
operations. But the other Spirit that witnesses of the true and spiritual
Christ, that kills all the other confidence, that is the heavenly and holy
Spirit, whose operations only are profitable; blasphemy, so contrary to God
and Christ, and Scripture, as has been shown, Part. i. page 9.10.
that they deserve rather to be abhorred than mentioned, I know no such thing
is in this saying intended, I would such expressions were lest as give strength
to it.

2 There is not one word in all the quotations to prove or show in what the
change in these differs from, or is better than the change in the other kind.

3 That this holy Spirit, is bestowed on them, as a fruit of the purchase and
intercession of Jesus Christ. This is a true saying in it self, and of all to
whom the holy Spirit is in any sort given, but as applied to a peculiar
company, that are not demonstrable, it is dangerous, and very intimatious of
error: Psalm. 75.3. Act. 14.17. and 17, 26, 27, 28. Romans 2.4.
For it is certain, that the earth is upheld (since the fall of man) and brings
forth fruit, that the beasts are preserved on the earth, That the Sun gives
comfortable light and heat, and the rain waters the earth, and it is fruitful,
and all for the good and service of men; And that in these is a testimony of
his goodness, and extended to lead men to repentance: All this is bestowed on
men, as a fruit of the purchase and mediation of Christ; For surely in the fall
all was lost: And according to the Truth and Justice of God without a Mediator,
nothing but death, curse, terror, and distraction, and torment, and vexation,
by every creature, could have come on men, no mercy, nor comfort to soul or
body, nor any thing to lead to repentance, to which no door could be opened
without the purchase, and intercession of Christ for men; For God is righteous
in all his ways, and holy in all his works: Psalm. 145.7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16.
And that he is good to all, and his mercy is over all his works, as indeed he
is. This is through the sacrifice and mediation of Christ, in, and through whom
God is propitious to fallen mankind; whence the Prophet by the Spirit speaking
as well of his general goodness, as of his special favor, in admiration of
both, Psalm. 36.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Joh. 1.4, 5. and 6.51, and 3.29. Psalm. 75.3. Col.
1.17. 1 Timothy 2.5, 6. Luke 13.8, 9. Psalm. 19. Romans 10.18.
as that which brings men to trust in him, he renders this as the ground of
both; For with thee is the fountain of life: Like that is said of Christ, In
him was life (he has procured it) and the life in him is the light (the cause
of all mercy, comfort, and of all means of coming to God again) of men, and
that shines, though men perceive it not; yea he says, He gave his flesh for
the life of the world, and that men are not all sorely vexed, and suddenly
destroyed for their impenitency, and unbeleef, its because, He is the Lamb of
God that takes away the sin of the world. And so he says of himself, The
earth is dissolved and all the Inhabitants, etc. I bear up the pillars, by him
all things consist: He it is that gave himself a ransom for all men and is the
Mediator between God and men; And so procures that patience, and forbearance,
mercies, and means that are extended to them.

Hence it is said, The heavens declare his glory, and the firmament shows his
handy work, etc. And that all are witnesses of his goodness, Col. 1.23, 24, 25,
26.
and to lead to repentance, and in that sense is the Gospel said to be preached
in every creature under heaven. Of which Gospel more fully declared in the
opening of the mystery, Paul was made a Minister.

Oh ye sous of men! how are we beholding to the Lord Jesus (and to God for him)
who has by his blood made peace for us, Heb. 2.9. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15 Romans 14.8, 9.
and by his ransom bought us all into his dispose, and by virtue of that
mediating for us with God, procures for us so much patience and forbearance, so
many mercies, and all to so gracious an end to lead us to repentance, that
coming into him, we might have life; and this now also all testified by the
Spirit of God. Oh! let us not deny this Lord that bought us, let his goodness
melt our hearts and prevail with us, to acknowledge him the Lord and Savior of
the world, even our Lord, that so we may repent and believe in him, and live to
him.

And let no man deceive you, by telling you, these are the fruits of the
goodness of God as a Creator, but not as a Redeemer, not so as through a
Mediator, extended as fruits of the purchase and mediation of Christ, for all
is through him. And no man can know God, that does not so acknowledge Christ
his Son, For the Father has committed all judgment to the Son of man, Romans
14.7. Phil. 2.7-11. 1 Timothy 2.6. Joh. 5.20, 21, 22, 23, 27. 2 Cor. 5.15.
upon this account, because he has taken the nature of man, and therein given
himself a ransom for all men; and that to this end, That all men should honor
the Son, as they honor the Father: And he that honors not the Son (in these
or other things) honors not the Father. So that the application of the
purchase, and intercession of Christ, as being only for some peculiar and
undemonstrable sort of men, does teach the sons of men to deny the Lord that
bought them, and shuts the door of repentance against them. But now for such as
to whom the Gospel is also ministered, yea and therein also Spirit vouchsafed,
and they by the Spirit illuminated in the knowledge of Christ; and that with
such operations as effectually produces such a change in the mind, affections
and coversation, that there is in them, repentance, and sorrow for sin, with
light, love, joy, zeal, obedience, and holiness. So sincere as makes them do
worthily in their generations, their faith and holiness true in its kind, and
they upon account thereof called Saints and Believers; And yet though all this
be given them of God, yet neither the Spirit, nor any of these his operations
bestowed on them, as a fruit of the purchase and intercession of Christ; How
then shall we conceive it to be bestowed, without some secret blaspheming of
God some way in his Truth and Justice, and testimony of his Son, can any man
tell? Is there any word of Scripture to say it? Col. 1.19. 2 Pet. 2.1, 2.
yea is not all the Scripture against such a conceit? yea it shows it to be a
denying of the preheminencie of Christ, that God would have him to have in all
things; yea it plainly teaches not only other men, but even believers to deny
the Lord that bought them, and a leaving them to conclude their faith by fancy,
seeing there are none by the Gospel to tell them, though their faith be true in
its kind, and operative, whether they be beholding to Christ for it, and
whether it be a fruit of his purchase and intercession or no; and if any
presume to tell them they must take it on their word, and so their faith rest
on man: 1 Cor. 2.4.
And into what delusions this may lead men, let wise men judge. But Mr. Owen
may be supposed not to deny, but that they have the holy Spirit given them as a
fruit of the purchase and intercession of Christ, but that it is not so given
them to dwell and abide in them for ever, as to these he pleads for: And were
it not for his often and plain expressions elsewhere in his book, denying the
purchase and intercession of Christ, to be for any but these he pleads for, I
should even so have understood him; and suppose it so meant of the end of
giving the Spirit. I shall consider that also.

2 He says, It was given them, to dwell and abide in them for ever. And this
must be taken either as relating to the gracious mind and end of God,
according to his holy will in giving his holy Spirit, or as relating to the
answering of that end of his ever-dwelling. Let us consider both according to
the Scripture.

1 The end of God in sending his Spirit in the Gospel to call men, Act. 26.17,
18.
Is to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the
power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and
inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith that is in Christ. So that
this appears to be for continuance of his work to the end, and that is his
abiding in them for ever. And so sure his end in sending, Ephesians. 3.16, 17. 1 Pet.
1.5.
or giving his Word or Spirit to any, and inabling them to understand, and
believe, is that this gracious word and Spirit may dwell and abide in them for
ever, but his will and mind is, that it shall so dwell and abide in their hearts
by faith which he has given them. Whence we are so often exhorted to continue
in the faith, and to let that we have received from the beginning abide in us,
so shall we continue and abide in him, and his Spirit will abide in us,
therefore are all the believers and holy brethren warned to take heed of such
unbeleevingness, as canseth departure from the living God, by which some have
deprived themselves of this blessing in this gracious end of God, 1 Samuel 3.
Psalm. 78.5.16. Jon. 2.8.
which yet is so ordered in his Counsels, that his end will be fulfilled in
their just destruction for despiting so great grace, as it was in Israel of old
that fell in the wilderness, in Elies house, in Ephraim, and others. But such
as he has given to believe, having been found trusting in him, have never been
forsaken, etc. And this end in such sense to give his holy Spirit to dwell and
abide in them for ever, may be affirmed of all believers, even those mentioned,
Heb. 6.1, 2, 4, 5. And in no other sense of any believer but to abide in, and
through faith.

2 If the dwelling and abiding in them for ever, be taken in relation to
answering this gracious end of God, in the constancy and durance of the holy
Spirit, his dwelling and abiding in them for ever, that is so as they live and
dye in the faith; then it is out of question of all hands, but this is not
determinable till they have finished their course and dye in the faith; so that
there is no difference or distinguishing and discriminating mark, to difference
one believer from another in this thing; but as some are quite fallen away, and
departed from the faith, and others dye in the faith.

As for that assurance of faith, where-through the heart may be thoroughly
persuaded of their perseverance, and so the Spirits abiding in them for ever;
It is that I have endeavored to lead all believers to in this Treatise, as may
be seen in treating of the testimony of Christ, and of the Purposes, Promises
and Covenants of God, though Mr. Owen says, Even those of that kind he
pleads for, many may go without that assurance all their days, he only
undertakes to prove notwithstanding it shall so be for ever.

Now let his quotations be viewed, to see what they say for one believer more
than another, for the Spirits abiding with them for ever.

Joh. 14.16.26. in verse. 16. Ioh 14.16.26, and 15.26. and 16, 7. Luke 24.49.
Our Savior tells his Apostles and first witnesses that were to carry forth
the testimony of him to the world after his Ascension; That he after he was
gone from them in bodily presence, would yet be an Intercessor with the Father
for them: And the Father in his Name, and so he from the Father, would send
them another Advocate, or Comforter.

Let the words be well minded, he faith not, Another Spirit, no, he minds them
of that, that it is the same Spirit of truth, Joh. 14.17. Mat 16.16, 17. Joh.
17.6, 7, 8.
which they knew, by which the Father in his ministration made him known to
them, to be the Christ, and had given them to believe on him, in which he did
also still, even now he was with them, dwell with them: So that it is not one
spirit opposed to another spirit; but one Advocate or Comforter, in respect of
the manner of advocation and comforting, opposed to another: God had been
formerly, even by the Spirit of Christ, Heb. 1.1, 2. and 7, and 8, and 9, and
10. 2 Cor. 3.7-14.
teaching his mind by parcels to them, and leading them to look to Christ, and
so to worship him by types, shadows, and carnal ordinances which were to be
removed; and now to these in the personal ministration of himself, in his
bodily presence, in which he had been, even so an Advocate and Comforter to
them; Psalm. 63.18. Act. 2.33. Romans 16.25. Joh. 16.7. and 7.39. 1 John 2.1.
But he was not always so to abide with them, nor was the excellency, fullness
and mystery of either his oblation, or mediation, and advocation to be clearly
opened and made known till he had finished his suffering work, and cast off
mortality, and overcome death, and ascended in his body immortal, into heaven,
and offered the acceptable sacrifice, and received the fullness of the Holy
Ghost, in that nature of man to send forth, for that full discovery of himself,
and the Fathers mind in him, and then he would so send forth this Holy Spirit
(himself remaining with the Father the Advocate still) to discover him, and so
the Fathers mind in him, and so, and therein to be an Advocate and Comforter to
them, even so, and such as never was before (as is shown in the eighth and
ninth Chapters of the third part of this Treatise about the revelation of
Christ) and so he opens it verse. 26. Joh. 15.15. and 17.6, 7, 8.
He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance
whatsoever I have said unto you: For he had made known his Fathers Counsel and
Name unto them, and given them his words. And this holy Spirit of truth in his
coming shall guide them into all truth, Ephesians. 1.8, 9.
by taking of the things of him, and showing them, and glorifying him, etc. So
as they shall have the fullness of the testimony, in all wisdom and
understanding to minister.

Oh blessed Advocate and Comforter And yet this not all, but as the next
quotation, Joh. 15.26. He shall testify of him (in them, to them, and through
their ministrations, so as) they also shall bear witness, Act. 5.31, 32. Act.
1.21, 22, and 10 34.42. 1 Cor. 9 1. 1 John 1.1, 2, 3.
because they have been with him from the beginning, even ear and eye witnesses
of his person and ministration, and miracles, and sufferings, and death, and
resurrection, and assent to heaven: And this Advocate and Comforter, both the
Doctrine of the Gospel, by him so opened, and the ministration of it, he taught
and lead them in: And his power and presence in that Doctrine so ministered,
should not be as the Mosaical Law, to pass away, and give place to another
ministration; nor as the ministration of John, nor his ministration in his
bodily weakness, 2 Cor. 3.3-18. Joh. 5.35, 36, and 14.12, 13. Ephesians. 1.3-10. See
part. 3. chap. 12.
to be over-shined by a more clear ministration; but this shall be the last
ministration, and abide till his own coming again; and so her shall be in them
in their doctrine and ministration for ever. So as to all believers here is
given certainty of truth, goodness, and immutability of the Gospel delivered by
the Apostles, and of the presence of the Spirit in such ministration thereof,
as left upon record by them to the end of the world. And as for the promise and
hope given in these promises to believers of this Doctrine for the Spirit in
their hearts, abiding in them for ever. Note,

1 It is great, Joh. 17.20, 21-23. and 7.37, 38, 39. and 14, 17.
our Savior having prayed for the same blessing for them also, and promised
the same, but that is not to some peculiar kind of believers, but to all that
believe on him; not believers opposed to believers, but believers opposed to
the world that lies in unbeleef, as is expressed.

2 That the manner of the assuring is abiding in them for ever, is by our
Saviors own explication to be in their abiding in him, Joh. 15.1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
in that faith, love, and confidence in him, which the Spirit has wrought, and
works in them; and his word, that which he has helped them to understand,
and by which he teaches and comfort them abiding in them: This also
express; So that by there quotations we are lead to hold fast our first faith;
that Heb. 6. Romans 8.10, 11. The Apostle both admonishing, exhorting
instructing, and comforting in such a manner as telling them, how it was with
them, if Christ be in them, and how it should be with them, if the Spirit of
Christ did dwell in them, and so not affirming what would be for ever, but
warning and directing that it might be.

I marvel this should be quoted for this assertion, it so suiting to that by
him opposed, 1 Cor. 6.19. The Apostle tells them that believe (and surely had
such illumination, and participation of the Holy Ghost as mentioned, Heb. 6.4,
5.) That their body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost in them, etc. Their body,
may be taken either for their personal bodies, which were the vessels and
instruments, in, and with which, they were to be given up as servants of
righteousness unto God; Romans 6.19.
or by body, may be meant their society, in which Truth was, and God to be
worshipped, and therefore to be kept holy, 1 Cor. 5.6, 7, 8.
and undefiled. Now the Apostle minding them of this, That their body is the
Temple of the Holy Ghost, or rather secretly reproves them for their neglect of
minding what their body was consecrated to in the heavenly call by Christ that
bought them, and had the right to dispose of them, even to be the Temple of the
Holy Ghost, and Instruments for him to use. And thereby he showed the
heinousness of their sin, if they defiled their bodies with fornication and
made or abused, The members of Christ, to be one with, and the members of an
harlot: Romans 12.1.2.
And so on this ground exhorted them, to demean their bodies suitable to the
purchase made by Christ, and to the relation they now stood in with Christ, and
to the purity and holiness of the Spirit God had given them; having upon the
very same ground forewarned them, That if any man defile the Temple of God, him
shall God destroy, 1 Cor. 3.16, 17 18.
entreating them not to be deceived, etc. (and how does the Spirit dwell in
such for ever then) yet after this he both reproves, warns, and exhorts on
the very same ground, 2 Cor. 6.15, 16.17, 18, and 7.1, 2.
assuring them from the promises of God of the Spirits continuing and dwelling
in them, in their yielding up to his teachings, and therefore calls upon them
for that, even like as to the Hebrews, chap. 6.

I marvel this was quoted here to such an end, which makes for that he
opposes, Romans 5.5. speaks of the operations of Grace believed (not in some
peculiar kind of, but) in all true believers, and so of that which hope in the
exercise of faith does, Romans 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
because of the love of God shed abroad in the heart of believers by the holy
Ghost given unto them; but not a word of the impossibility of any of the Saints
by any ill requitals, to deprive themselves of that love again, and so of that
holy Spirit; yea he rather warns them to beware of that in the 6. and 8.
Chapters following, suitable to the warning given the Hebrews, chap. 2. and 3,
and 4. and 6. 1 John 4.4.13. and those that follow, speaks of the Spirit in
believers, a thing denied by none, but not a word about the infallibility of
his ever abiding, unless as the former places, directing to that in which it
may so be; but it may be these are quoted for proofs of that which follows in
this Concernment, which is no part of that contended for, or against, unless it
be to countenance the distinction of two kinds of faith, preferring one before
another. And so I will consider it.

CHAP. XX.
Of the second part of the third Concernment.

HE says, Upon the account of which inhabitation of the Spirit of Christ in
them, they have union with him, that is one and the same Spirit dwelling in him
the head, and them the members.

Surely this may be truly said of all believers that abide in the faith of
Christ, during the time of their abiding in the faith, and so of the faith as
mentioned, Heb. 6.1, 2, 4, 5. yea the mixtures by him put in, which are no
parts of faith being taken out as they consist not with the rest, even that
first kind of faith set forth by himself, who has not yet produced a better,
but even the same clad with some unjustifiable expressions; so that this saying
is true of all true believers, or that in truth believe the testimony of
Christ, search the Scripture.

This I hope being granted of all that believe the Gospel of Christ, that there
are not two Spirits in Christ, to procced from him, to work faith in men, and
dwell in believers, but only one holy Spirit that is in the Father, and in the
Son, the Spirit of the Father, and of the Son, sent by the Son from the Father,
and by the Father through the Son, and in the name (or Gospel) of the Son, one
and the same holy Spirit. And so where ever the Father and Son is, he is, and
where ever he is, the Father and Son is there, with, and by him.

Now mind what the Scripture says, Christ says, Mat. 10 40. Joh. 13.20. Mat
10.41, 42. Luke 10.16. 1 John 4.6. Rev. 19.10. 2 Cor. 5.19, 20 Joh. 15.16, 27.
Act. 5.32. 2 Thessalonians 2.8, 10
He that receives you, receives me; And he that receives me, receives him
that sent me. And this also spoken of his sending to preach the Gospel: And
though this in respect of his gracious acceptance and interpretation, be true
to all that for his sake receive such as believe in him; yet it is principally
meant of receiving his message by, and from them. And so he that has the
testimony of Jesus, has the Spirit of Prophecy: And the holy Spirit
witnesses together with, and in that testimony: And Christ will in his time
come again, to be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that
believe; because the Apostles testimony was received by them in the days of
his patience while it was preached to them; so that whoever in hearty
believing, receives this testimony, It is Spirit and life to him, Joh. 6.63.
Romans 1.16. 1 Thessalonians. 2.13. Joh. 15.4, 5, 7. 1 John 1.3. and 2.24.
yea the power of God to salvation to him, and works effectually in him. And
as they abide in this word, they abide in Christ, and as this word abides in
them, Christ by his Spirit abides in them; And they have fellowship with the
Father and the Son, and continue in both, and that is his dwelling in them: And
so of the Galatians, of whom Paul was sore afraid, yet he doubts not to
affirm of them, Because ye are Sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son
into your hearts, Gal, 4.6, 7, 8, 9.
etc. and ye have known God, or rather are known of him. And so 1 John 44.13.
speaks in the very same language, not of any peculiar kind of Spirit, that
is in Christ, and flows from him into some peculiar kind of true believers;
but of that one holy Spirit which is in Christ, and his efficacies, which also
in a measure is in all true believers: And so verse 4. he salth, 1 John 4.4.
Ye are born of God, or of God, and have overcome them (that is the evil
spirits in the world) because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in
the world (where the opposition is not of believers to believers, but of
believers to the world) and this he after expresses, both by the effects, and
the believers in whom it is, saying, What soever is born of God, over comes
the world; 1 John 5.4, 5.
And who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is
the Son of God, this being our victory whereby we overcome the world, even our
faith. So that all the way here is but one spirit, and one faith. Gal 4.9. 1
Cor 8.3. 1 Ioh 4.6, 7.12.
And these believers marked out by the same terms with others; He that knows
God, that loves God, and loves his brother, these, says he, Are of God, born
of God, and God dwells in them; And to demonstrate who these are, he says,
It is he that hears us (that is the Apostles in the word given by Christ to
them, and by them delivered and recorded, Romans 1.5 and 16, 26.
for the obedience of faith among all Nations) He that hears, that is,
accepts, and receives our testimony, that will be set, appointed and
determined in his judgment, faith, and way by this word delivered by us, as it
is indeed the word of God, and so accounting God true, 2 Thessalonians. 1.10. 1 Thessalonians.
2.13. Romans 3.4. 1 Ioh. 4.6.11. Ioh. 1.12, 13, and 7.37, 38, 39. Ier 11.6, 8.
and 34-6-10. and 6.17.
who ever be found a liar, etc. And so according to this testimony believes
in Christ, and loves his brother. He, and so all such are born of God. And
that this obedience of faith is meant by hearing, is clear in such a like use
of the word in another business: And they that refuse this are said to refuse
to hearken. So on the other side, He that hears not the word of Christ as
delivered by the Apostles, that is, does not accept it, and receive, etc. he is
not of God, not born of God, that is, for the present time, he is not now of
God, what ever he may be hereafter, or has been heretofore. And so the word
hears is used for a present and continued hearing, Ier. 34.9, 10, 15 11.16.
Ezekiel. 18.24.
Jer. 34. those that were affirmed to have heard, yea so to have heard, as to
have turned, and done right in the sight of God, yet these after backsliding
are then said not to have hearkened unto God, according to that word, In the day
that he sins, all his righteousness shall not be mentioned to him: So then
while he thus hears, he receives the word as the word of God, and therein
Christ and his Spirit, that frames, inclines, and inableth him to believe in
God, love God, love his brother, and so the same mind and spirit that is in
Christ is in him. 1 Cor. 2.16. Phil. 2.12, 5. Col. 3.16. 1 Ioh. 3.6.9.23, 24.
Hence so exhorted, To let the word of Christ dwell plentifully in us; For such
are of God, born of God, and God dwells in them. And so verse. 13. Hereby we
know that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his
Spirit. And so in chap. 3. where abiding in him, and being born of him, are put
one for another. And there it is affirmed, That he that keeps his commands
(in believing on the Name of his Son Jesus Christ, and loving one another)
dwells in him, and he in him; And hereby we know that he abides in us, by
the Spirit which he has given us; which needs no further explication to know
what Spirit it is, and that it is but one Spirit, and the same Spirit that is
in Christ, and in all unfeigned believers: And that this Spirit dwells both in
their society for ever, and in every particular soul of them, that are found
believers, so long as they abide in the faith, he has wrought, and preserves
in them, and on that ground are the exhortations given, Chap. 3. and 4. and of
like signification, the other quotations, 2 Timothy 1.14. 1 Cor. 6 17. and 12.12,
13. Ephesians. 4.4. There being but one Spirit, and I hope for the manner of the
spirits being in Believers, there needs no contention.

It is not meant simply of the essence or being of the Spirit, Psalm. 1 30.7.13.
Ier. 23.23, 24. Amos 9.2.3. Heb. 3.1. Mat. 3.45. Job 37.27, 28 31.
which is one, and the same with the Father, and the Son, and so filling heaven
and earth with his presence, yea so with all creatures, and so in love, and
well-pleasedness with the righteous, and in wrath with, and against the wicked,
discerning all things; so that here is some farther meaning of the Spirit being
in believers: And that is also a farther thing than the forth-putting of his
divine force, and power, upholding and raising up, and making operative
something in the creature, Psalm. 33 5 11, and 36.6. and 104.27 28-30.
for so he upholdeth the earth and the heavens and causes the Sun to shine,
and the clouds to carry about water, and distill their drops, and the earth to
bring forth fruit, and men to live and move. He causes the grass to grow, but
not to be sensible, and knowing, he causes the beasts to live, breathe, Act.
14.17. and 17.25, 28. Psalm. 66.7. Eccles. 3.14.
and move, and to be sensible, and so to know as far as by sense they may be
brought to know, but indueth them not with reason, or an intelle tual
understanding. But men besides all the former, he also indueth with reason, Job
35, 10.
and understanding above the beasts: And all this extended to, and for men, is
an effect of God, and so of one and the same Spirit, extended to fallen
mankind, through a Mediator; and so by virtue of the ransom and mediation of
Christ, and that to gracious ends, to lead men to repentance, yet all this
being but the supportation of the old creation for a time, that time and means
may be vouchsafed to bring men to repentance, and so short of the New Creation.
It is said still to be in a natural way extended: And men thus knowing, are but
natural, and cannot by nature, or all the wisdom thus attained, perceive, 1
Cor. 2.8, 14.
or receive the things of the Spirit that he witnesses of Christ. But the
forth putting of the divine force and power of the holy Spirit in this business
is supernatural in the testimony of Christ. The New and Spiritual man, and for
setting forward the New Creation; which divine force or power, according to the
light in the means vouchsafed, is at one time or other, put forth to all men
that come to the use of understanding in their several Ages; In which respect
also, The word of faith, Joh. 1.4, 5.9. Romans 10.6, 7, 8, 9. Psalm. 119.130. 1 John 5.20.
when preached, is nigh to them in their mouth and heart, that they might
believe and confess: And such as in believing receive the Spirits testimony: He
by his divine light, and power effects in them an understanding, and heart to
know Christ, and so to love him, and one another for his sake, and so to
incline to, and seek his ends. And thus they partake of the Divine Nature: 2
Pet. 1, 4.
This supernatural force and divine power working in them, to this gracious
end, is the very Spirit that is in Christ; and this his supernatural operation
of the mind and disposition of Christ, and so of faith, love, and likeness of
design in their heart; being born of the Spirit, Is Spirit; Joh. 3.6. 1 Cor.
2.16. 2 Cor. 4.13. 2 Timothy 1.7.
yea the Spirit and mind of Christ in them. And called The Spirit of faith,
and the Spirit of love and power, and of a sound mind: And so bears the name
of the Spirit and supernatural divine power that effected it, yea is one with
it, and never separate from it: And this supernatural divine power in this
heavenly supernatural disposition, is the Spirit of Christ in believers. And in
this manner, Romans 8.9-12.
in, and with such a disposition is he in them: And he that has not the Spirit
of Christ in him, is as yet none of his members; And thus one and the same
Spirit is in him the head, and in them the members, yet with some difference
for the manner of being in them; Ephesians. 4 16. 1 John 2.20, 27, 28. Col. 2.3, 9,
10. Ephesians. 4.7. Romans 8.23.
it is in him as the head, whence it flows to all the members: In him as the
giver, but in them as members, and receivers: In him as the fountain, in them
as vessels: In him immeasurably, the fullness of the Godhead dwelling in him
bodily: In them according to a measure of the good pleasure of Christ; and that
not the full, nor the half, nor the tenth, but a first fruits of that which
abiding in him, they shall be filled withal at his coming; and this first
fruits of a different measure in some more than in other, and capable of
increase in all Saints during this life; And so the same spirit in those spoken
to, Heb. 6.1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10. And all this I have writ to prevent fancies,
delusions, and pride, in men's conceits of the inhabitation of the holy Spirit
in them.

As for those two terms, viz. That upon the account of this inhabitation of the
Spirit in them, they have union with Christ, And that this union with Christ,
is one and the same Spirit dwelling in him the head, and them the members:
These expressions, may to such as have understanding to take them in a right
sense, go for current and true, for in a right sense so they are; but to such
as are yet weak, they are so darkly expressed, that it may dazzle and hinder the
faith of some, and the growth of others:

For first, that upon the account of the inhabitation of the Spirit, they have
union with Christ, it is undoubtedly true, yea without controversy there is no
union with Christ, but by the operation of this holy Spirit: But that there is
no union with Christ, before this inhabitation of the Spirit, would be harsh to
affirm, yea in order of nature, if not of time, as it may be in some, the
Spirit in working faith, does first unite the believers in believing to Christ,
before he take up his residence and habitation in them, which is upon, and
after believing, I will not press a nice distinction, of the spirits being with
a man, in bringing to Christ and instructing in the knowledge of him, Joh 7.37,
38. Ephesians. 1.13.
and so bringing by faith to adhere to him, and so uniting. And after taking up
his habitation, as an In dweller, affording a living principle, though there is
more force for this in those words to them united to Christ; Ye know him, for
he dwells with you, and shall be in you, Joh. 14.17.
then in many quotations rendered by some, for what they pretend to prove
thereby: But for true believers, that in faith and love, are united to Christ,
and yet happily, have not, or discern not, such a constant inhabitation as is
mentioned, the Spirits doctrine is good and safe, 1 Pet. 2.2, 3.4, 5
As new born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow
thereby, if so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious; to whom coming,
etc. Ye are built upon him, etc. which is no less than more firmly united, and
growing up in union with him; Suitable to that Heb. 3.6.14. Joh. 17.20.
Though still there is an union, in will, purpose, design, and way, which is a
fruit of the former, and follows it; yea in this also they become of one heart
and mind with all unfeigned believers, for carrying on the design of Christ;
and of union in a spiritual mind and disposition, and by reason of fellowship
in an obliging relation, is that 1 Cor. 6.17 as appears by the opposition: And
of union in mind and fellowship, as well as in faith, appears to be meant, 1
Cor. 12.12, 13. And the reason rendered, because wrought by one Spirit; And of
the oneness of Spirit, with the head, and all believers, Gal. 3.1.5. and 5.5, 6.
in faith, love, and design, appears to be meant, Ephesians. 4.4, 5. And as the
weakest believer hereby may be both comforted and exhorted, in abiding to
experiment this inhabitation, though he yet hardly discern it. So the strongest
may be exhorted to grow up in it. And yet again, that the union with Christ is
in this, That there is one and the same Spirit in him the head, and them the
members, is true, yet in such as are yet weak in understanding; so to take it
without some explication, may hinder their growth, supposing the inhabitation
complete, when yet there may be much wanting to them, and they need still; the
operations of the holy Spirit in making them one with Christ, in his mind and
judgment, in the testimony of Christ, approving what he approves, and
condemning what he condemns. And so one with him in his design for glorifying
God in seeking the salvation of men, and the edifying and prosperity of the
Church; And so one with him in childlike affection to God, and member-like love
to brethren, and compassion to them that are out of the way, and so one with
him in bowels of mercy, patience, meekness, etc. All which oneness with him,
abiding in that faith and love he has wrought, and is stirring up in them,
they shall grow up more in, and so grow up more into him, etc. which was that
the Apostle endeavored to farther the Hebrews in: And so in all quotations in
all the three Concernments, no other or better faith shown, than that which is
faith indeed in the first kind set forth by him: See also the last.

CHAP. XXI.
Of Mr. Owens last Concernment, in two parts.

IN this last Concernment are two things expressly noted. First, Their actual
state and condition.

And secondly, Then relative condition.

And all said of either, as true of that which is faith, in that set out in the
first kind, as of that which is faith set out in this second kind, for the
mixtures put in to darken it, taken from the one, and the unjustifiable
expressions put on the other, to make show of difference, removed; both appears
to be indeed but one kind of faith; so that there is nothing here needful, but
only reciting the words, and minding the proofs quoted.

First, Romans 8.23, 14, 25. 2 Cor. 5.1, 4. Phil. 3.11.12. Romans 8.10. Romans
7-14.15 24, 25, 26, and ^ 1, 2, 3, 4.
he says, By all which, As to their actual state and condition, they are
really changed from death to life, etc. We know he means not from mortallity
to immortallity, which is that real change, they have not yet attained, but
wait for; but for the present. The Spirit is life for righteousness sake, yet
the body is dead because of sin; yea and something savouring of death is also
in, and troubling their souls; But through the law of the Spirit of life in
Christ, as they in believing, walk after the Spirit, they are made free, and
enlived, from the sentence and fear of death, and filled with the promise and
hope of life, which comfort in so great love of God enlives us in love of the
brethren. And 1 John 3.14. We know that we have passed from death to life, 1 John 4.7, 16. and 3, 6, 9, and 5.2
because we love the brethren, etc. We that are born of God, that have believed
the love wherewith God has loved us; and so abide in Christ keeping his
commands of faith and love, We know we are passed from being judged by our
works according to the law, which sentenceth to death, into the gracious
acceptance and favor of God in Christ, and so into the liberty and life of
Christ, and enjoyment of his gracious Spirit, which brings forth this fruit of
love, which whoever has not, abides in death; And this is true of all abiding
in the faith without difference. Ephesians. 2.2-5, and Col. 2.13. Speak of that
quickening, Act. 10.43. Joh. 3.16, 18, 36.
which is through believing in Christ, in which remission of sins, and hope of
eternal life is begun to be received, which all true believers receive, without
difference, though not in like fullness in every believer: And on that ground,
Romans 6.11.13. and 8, 9. Are exhortations to persevere, walking in faith, and
love.

Secondly, From darkness to light. This is true, though that quoted, Act.
26.18. does but show the end of Gods sending the Gospel to be ministered to men;
Mat 4.13-16.
without difference of any to whom it is so sent, which where it comes, light
springs up. And Ephesians. 5.8. shows what believers (without difference) are in the
Lord, Ephesians. 5.8.9 15.
since called and enabled to believe, and that pressed as a motive to abide and
persevere walking in the light. And 1 Thessalonians. 5.4, 5. shows that believers are
not in darkness of ignorance and unbeleef, and how efficacious the light of
truth believed was in them, They were born of it: They were (he says not some,
but) all the children of light, etc. From whence he presses an exhortation,
Not to sleep as others, but to walk, (...)
etc. And Col. 1.13. Is a blessing of God in giving him thanks for having
delivered them (he faith not from all darkness, but) from the power of
darkness, Col. 1.12, 13.23, 24.
and having translated them into the Kingdom (that is the spiritual Kingdom,
or government, and interest in, and hope of that promised Kingdom) of the Son
of his love; for which cause he presses their abiding and continuance. And 1
Pet. 2.9. shows, That Gods elect and chosen people, are such as he has called
out of darkness into his mavelous light to show forth his praises: And what
this light is, 2 Cor. 4.6.
and where it shines, is plain to be in the face of Christ, Gods prime Elect.
And this is true in a measure of all unfeigned believers; let them mind this,
That conceit an elect company, before the appointment of Christ to dye, to be
given him to dye for, and demonstrate what they are, and reconcile them into
one condition with these.

Thirdly, From an universal habit of uncleanness, unto holiness.] In a begun
inclination, and through all the powers, a tendency thereto, that there may be
a proceeding to perfection in holiness; this is true: But Ezekiel. 36.25. speaks
directly of the Jews, when he has returned them to their own land: And as in
reference to a first fruits in believers in this life; Ezekiel 36.24, 25, 26,
27-37. Ephesians. 5.23, 26, 27.
It speaks of that God will do to them after he has called them to believe in
Christ. And so of a continued business on, and in believers till it be
complete, for which he will be sought of them. And 1 Cor. 6 11. speaks of a
work begun, and so in the beginnings of it done in them, In the Name of the
Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God: And this given as a ground both to
reprove some evils, and uncleanness in them, 1 Cor 6. 1 9, 11, 2 20.
and to warn them from sinning, and to stir them up by the same Name and Spirit
to press on to further holiness. And Tit. 3.5. shows the manner of this work,
and by what means, and to what end it is done, and so the beginning and
proceeding, but shows not the accomplishment as yet to be in them. And Heb.
10.22. is not an affirmation of what is attained, but an exhortation to use the
right way, for having a continual increase of renewed holiness; Heb. 10, 12-18,
19, 20, 24, 25 and 12, 12 14.
upon that very ground, of what we have in Christ, and have begun to receive,
and may be daily receiving from him; that so in holding last our confidence and
profession, we may follow after holiness.

Fourthly, From a state of enmity, stubboruness, rebellion, etc. into a state
of love, obedience and delight.] This is no other, but in change of an
expression, what was confessed to be in the first kind of believers, and
Saints. And indeed it is true of both alike, for both, so far as true are one.

Romans 6.11. speaks of that done and completed in Christ, and not yet in us,
but by degrees, and in due season to be done; Romans 6.11, 12, 13, 14.
And that laid as the ground in believing on him, both to reckon our selves
after him, and in that account yield up our selves, to live to him, in which
that will be verified of us that is said from verse. 17 22. and so it plainly
appears to be understood.

Ephesians. 2.12, 13. Speaks of that state of Gentilism, enstrangement to God, all we
Gentiles were in, before Christ came in the flesh, and offered up the
acceptable Sacrifice, and the privileges confirmed before to the Jewish
Nation, were set open to the Gentiles, Chap 3 3-6-9.
and they made nigh by the blood of Christ, that made peace, broke down the
partition wall, slew the enmity, etc. and came and preached peace, by which
peace preached in his Name, all that believe in him have access by one Spirit
to the Father, that is clear.

Col. 1.21. Speaks of the enmity in their minds, and of the efficacy of the
Death and Sacrifice of Christ, and peace made thereby, and Gods love
there-through appearing displayed, and believed, how it reconciled them to God.
And that to this end, Col. 1.4, 5.20. Tit. 3.4, 5. Rom 5.8, 10. Ephesians. 5.25, 26,
27. Col. 23, 24. Heb. 8.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10. Heb. 12.22, 23, 24, 25, 26.
To present them in the body of his flesh through death, holy, and unblameable,
and unreproveable in his sight, if they continued in the faith, etc. Just as to
the Hebrews. Heb. 12.22. Shows to how much more glorious ministration, and
better Covenant, stablished on better promises than they in Moses time had, and
what happy society they were come to, yea even to Jesus, where they might enjoy
the blood of sprinkling, showing thereby, as the benefit of hearing, so the
danger of turning away; so warning to heedfulness.

Secondly, he says, And as to their relative condition, whereas they were
children of wrath, under the curse, and condemning power of the Law, they are
upon the score of him, who was made (...) curse for them, and is made
righteousness to them; accepted, justified, adopted, and admitted into that
family of heaven and earth, which is called after the Name of God. All this in
the truth of it, in a measure is true of all unfeigned believers, even the
weakest of them. As for Ephesians. 2.3. Gal. 5.13.
it is fore-spoken to and agrees to all believers, without difference. And Gal.
3.13, shows the way of deliverance through Christ, Being made a curse for us;
And how he has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, so as God will not go to
judgment with us thereby, however unbeleeving hearts are under the fear of
that curse and death, but he has given us all over to Christ, to be disposed
by him, and judged by him according to the Gospel; yet this was not all the end
he had in so redeeming us from the curse of the Law, but he had a more abundant
gracious end in this his suffering for us, namely, That the blessing of Abraham
might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that so we might receive the
promise of the Spirit through faith: He says not, That we Jews and Gentiles,
all that he has redeemed from the curse of the Law (which is true to all men)
are in their conscience from under Law, and have received the blessing of
Abraham, and the promise of the Spirit but that he by suffering for us the
curse of the Law, has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, to this end, That
we might, etc. And so upon the account of Christ being made a curse for us,
Joh. 3.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 36. Gal. 3.7-12, 16, 29. 2 Cor. 15.1, 2, 3, 4.
etc. The Gospel of this good news is preached to us, that we might believe,
and in believing receive the blessing and promise through faith. Not else, nor
otherwise, but in believing we shall receive: And all this is true for, and to
all men, but only believers receive the blessing and Spirit through faith. And
this is true of all believers, and abides in them, as they abide in the faith,
to press to which, is the drift of this, and following Chapters.

Gal. 4.4. The Apostle here in showing, That God sent forth his Son made of a
woman (that is in the common nature of mankind) made under the Law (that under
which all mankind was fallen) to redeem them that were under the Law (as all
mankind was) that we might receive the adoption of Sons. He says not, And
then we did, Romans 3.10-19 20.
or all so redeemed from the curse of the Law have, But that we might, that is,
in believing receive, etc. And so far true to all alike. And then verse 6. And
because ye are Sons, Chap. 3.13, 14
that is because ye have believed this testimony, and so believed in the Name
of the Son of God, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son, that divine force
of his Spirit, Joh. 1.12. Gal. 3.26. Mar. 14.36. Romans 8.2.14 15.
working childlike confidence, and desires, moving to approach to him by
Christ, crying, Abba Father: And this all true believers receive, yet this, and
the rest he affirms, in no sort to import an impossibility of their
miscariage, for he was afraid of them, but as a motive to reduce them from
miscarriages, and prevent farther miscarriages, that they might abide in, and
live by faith; and though their declining be great, and much fallen from grace,
yet not being quite departed, upon the account of Christ believed in, he
affirms the Spirit in them.

Romans 8.1. Romans 3.19-25. and 5.18. and 7.1-7.14.24.
The Apostle having before laid the foundation forth in the redemption wrought
by, and in Jesus Christ: And also how by faith it is received, and how
believing in Christ we are dead to the Law by the body of Christ, that we might
be married to him, and that in believing, we are so quickened and married to
Christ, That we might bring forth fruit to God, and serve in newness of Spirit.
And then showing in his own example, how the old disposition, the law in the
members, Gal. 5.17.
does war against the Spirit, and so hinder them that they cannot do all the
good as they would; and yet he by following the Spirit in minding Jesus Christ,
and the redemption in him, yielding up with his mind, to side with, and walk
in the Spirit, and so in that faith of Jesus, in love, etc. he was delivered,
and set free from all charges of sin and sentences of death, by the Law, yea
acquit and justified through the blood of Christ believed in, Romans 7.24, 25.
and 5.1-5.9. and 3.25. Romans 8.1.
and so rejoice in Christ: And this he lays down as true in like manner too,
and of all that unfainedly believe in Jesus Christ, and the common privilege
of them all; Now then, or therefore, there is now no condemnation (that is,
none by that law of sin and death, either from God, or from conscience, what
ever be from ungodly men, yet none that can charge their conscience as under
the guilt of sin, or liableness to curse, no such condemnation, or reproof, its
large, No condemnation] to them which are in Christ, who walk not after the
flesh, but after the Spirit: he says not simply to them that are in Christ
Jesus, Gal. 5.16, 17, 18, and 6, 8.
and there stop, and make the period; for if any that have received the
testimony of Christ, so as to believe in him (as the flesh lusts against the
Spirit) do side with the flesh, and sow to it, 1 John 3.4.
and not presently own and confess that faultiness, and seek pardon and healing
in Christ, but go on in any thing to serve such fleshly lusts, 1 Cor. 11.31,
32. Mar. 10.41, 45 Mat. 28.3. Ephesians. 4.29, 30. 1 Cor. 6.7. 2 Cor. 12.21. Gal.
6.8. 1 John 3.20, 21 1 John 1.6, 7, 8, 9.
he sins against grace, and not only the Law will reprove him of sin, but
God will reprove him, and chasten him also, yea Christ will reprove him, yea
the holy Spirit will convince him of faultiness; and all faithful men that walk
after the Spirit, will reprove him, yea and his own heart will condemn him. 1 John 3.20. And if he go on thus, he will reap corruption, and become more
estranged, weakened, and deaded, and cannot have boldness toward God, but in
returning to Christ, confessing his sins, and judging himself, and so again
walking after the Spirit. And this affirmed by the Apostle in this Rom 8.12,
13. therefore the Apostle says, There is no condemnation to them which are in
Christ, who walk not after the flesh (though flesh be lusting in them) but
after the Spirit, 1 Cor. 11.31. Gal. 5.6 16, 18 1 John 1.7, 9. Col. 3.1, 2, 3,
4, 5.
which works by love, inclining, and yielding to walk in the teachings and
motions of the Spirit, confessing, and disowning the sinfulness that is in them
by the lusts of the flesh: and by the Spirit with the cross of Christ
mortifying the same, yield as servants to grace; to such not withstanding the
weakness, molestations and failings thereby, Gal. 6.16, 18, 19, 24, 25 and 6.8.
Ephesians. 4.20-31. Col. 3.1-6.
there is no condemnation; This law of the Spirit of life which is in Christ
Jesus, after which they walk, will free them from the power of that law of sin
and death, and so from all charges of sin and death; And they shall not be
under the Law, but under Grace, non yet fulfill the lusts of the flesh, but of
the Spirit shall reap life everlasting. And on this ground are they exhorted.
To mortify the flesh by the Spirit, and to live in, and walk after the Spirit.
And this is the doctrine of the Apostle, as may be seen in all his writings;
And in this Romans 8. (as well as in Chap. 6. and 7.) by a general Proposition
verse. 1. by his own experiment verse. 2. (compared with 7.25.) and by Gods
preparation for us in Christ, verse. 3. and by his gracious end, of giving life
hereby, to them which walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, verse. 4.
and by his following instructions, and exhortations to verse. 15. So that how
far this quotation serves for that its quoted for; I say nothing, but let the
next quotation clear it.

2 Cor. 5.21. Speaks not a word of any believers, how far they have yet in this
life attained, much less of one more than another, but directly and expressly
shows the preparation God has made for us in his Son, by what way, and to what
end, for the way it is suited to the 14, 15 and 19. verses, Him that knew no
sin, he made to be sin for us; This is done, not now to do, nor yet presented
to us in dark figures, or parables, or allegories, but plainly declared to be
done; And that also to a gracious end, suited to verse. 15.18.20. Even that we
might be made the righteousness of God in him: He says not, And we are made,
as of a thing done, But that we might be made, as of a thing by the former done
in Christ, to be after done in us; and so lays here the foundation for
repentance and faith, Gal. 3.13, 14, and 4.4, 5. Tit. 2.14.
and so reconcilement of the heart to God, and walking after the Spirit, that
men in believing might begin to receive the same, so that as any by faith are
united to Christ, and so made in Christ, So is Christ made of God to them,
wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, 1 Cor. 1.30. Phil.
3.12, 13, 14. 1 John 3, 2.
and not otherwise; And so they begin to be made the righteousness of God in
him: But fully and completely so to be, will not be till Christ come again. And
this is given as the ground of the exhortation following, Not to receive the
grace of God in vain, Chap. 6.1, 2.

Col. 2.10. Speaks not a word of the attainment of believers here in this life,
but of what they are in Christ; sure in Christ, as in a public man, that died
and rose, and gave himself a ransom for them: All have dyed, and are so given
over to him, 2 Cor. 5.14. Romans 14.9. and 5.18.
that to and in him they are discharged and made alive from that first
sentence, curse, and death, into which through the first Adam they fell: And
though this be not yet made over to all men by Christ, and unbeleevers know it
not, yet shall none perish by that first sentence, in that first death, but be
raised out of it; 1 John 5.10, 11, 12. Joh. 1.14, 16. Col. 1.19, 20. Isa.
45.22. and 42.1-7. and 6.1 4. Col. 1.28. Phil. 3.7, 9. 2 Cor. 3.18. Jona 2.8.
Mat. 16.26.
Yea not only this, but God has given us eternal life in Christ, though
unbeleevers have it not; Yea not only this, but the fullness of grace and
truth, of wisdom and understanding, of divine power and spirit are in him,
enough to draw any that in hearing behold him, to believe in him: And so the
Apostle in preaching, endeavored to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,
that so they might see what perfection there is in Christ, and that also by
Gods gift for them which believed, and minded would take them off from other
things, and both draw them into him, and conform them by degrees to him,
although such as heed it not, but follow lying vanities, forsake their own
mercies, Joh. ^7.2, 3.6, 7, 8. and 6.40 and 3.16. and 1.12, 13 Romans 10.10. 1.
Cor. 3.22.
and lose their own souls; and so are not so related to him, as in which
relation he gives to them eternal life, and interresseth them so in himself, as
to interress them in all that is in him, and all that is his; for this is only
given to them, that by the heavenly call are given unto him, so as they receive
his words, and believe on his name; And all that with the heart believe unto
righteousness are thus related to him, and interressed by him.

Now if we believe in him, he and all that is his, is ours. Let us mind what
he is, even the elect of God, the Son of God, the Savior, etc. And what is
his, even, the Father, and Spirit, the Promises, the Kingdom, etc. And what is
in him, Even all the treasures of wisdom, and knowledge, Joh. 1.12.14, 16, 17.
yea in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, so that in him we
are complete, and fully furnished: Whence also those that in believing are
united and related to him, Do of his fullness receive, and grace for grace: And
what ever may yet be wanting to, and in them, it is in Christ for them, in
minding and believing in him, to be receiving the same; so that abiding in the
faith of him, and walking in him, as they have received him, in faith and love,
they shall be rooted in him, receive more of his fullness, and in due time be
completed by him because the fullness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily; And
they as members and brethren are related to him; In whom they are complete,
Col. 2.1, 2, 3, 6, 9.10.
he also being the head of all principality and power, that has the care and
charge of all that believe in him. And this also given as the ground and reason
of the Apostles prayer for them, verse. 2. And exhortation to them, verse. 6. And
admonition to them that none beguile them, verse. 4.8. either with enticing
words, or Philosophy, and vain deceit, or by shows of humility, and great
knowledge, intruding themselves into things they have not seen, etc. and so
happily, either pressing them to Law-observances for their perfection, or to
some humane, and self-mortifications, or to look for some particular words, or
some degree and condition in seize, or some secret decree of election
that was of their persons before their calling, or any thing what ever besides,
that which is discovered to them in Christ: As if there were not enough in him
to be received in believing on him: And so he warns to beware that we be not
removed from him, and that hope of the Gospel given us in believing on him,
Col. 1.22, 23, 24.
For he will present us blameless if we continue in the faith, etc. This is the
Apostles doctrine and scope, as appears in this, and former, and following
Chapters clearly, so as in all the proofs, not a syllable to maintain any true
faith of a second kind, nor the cause contended for, but much rather, that he
contendeth against, and more need not be said, but only to view his terms
about their privileges in the works of God passed on them, which also are
needful to be considered.

CHAP. XXII.
Of the terms of Gods works passed on believers in this Concernment.

OF these terms understood as is fore-shewn, and some so molified, as has been
shown before in Pages 414, and 435, and 436. they may be all received; As for
the term Regenerated, it is not used here, and has been considered where it
is; only here let that place, Mat. 19.28. Ye which have followed me in the
Regeneration, etc. be considered; he says not, Ye which are regenerated, as
speaking of a work done, but a doing; and it may be taken both for
Regeneration, and the Ministry of Regeneration, in both which they were then
following him.

Now what was the Regeneration of Christ, surely he needed none of heart,
spirit, or disposition, he was holy in, and from conception, and knew no sin,
but he had a weak, frail and mortal body, of the seed of David, Abraham, Adam;
and how was that regenerated, but through many sufferings and death in the
resurrection from the dead: Luke 24.26.45, 46, 47. Isa. 53 8, 10, 11 Psalm. 2.
Act. 13.33.
And so he pass^^on through sufferings till he was truly dead, and in the
resurrection he was begotten; there was his regeneration, and such as are so
raised are his generation, or regenerated people; whence such promises to be
performing in the spirit and soul, as through dying with, Romans 6, 4, 5. 2 Timothy
2 11. Phil. 3.9.10, 11, 12, 13. Joh. 15.16-25. Mat. 10. and 24.9-13.
and for him, we are conformed to his death (for we need it in that) and in
soul and body, after we are truly dead in the resurrection of the just, and
those that follow him so to the death, shall then enjoy that promised, Mat.
19.28. and such desires of conformity to him in sufferings.

And as for the ministration of Christ for regeneration of others; it was a
ministration carried an end through sufferings, in which he persevered to the
end, and so must that ministration of his servants be also; and he that
perseveres in following him in that to the end, shall enjoy also that promised;
And that regeneration is thus to be understood here for a work not completely
yet done, but in doing, both in regeneration and ministration of it, is evident
by the Spirit in Luke, mentioning the same thing, so far as they had proceeded
in it, says, Luke 22.28, 29, 30.
Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations, expressing that
as the medium through which regeneration is here attained, which minded will
help to understand all the terms that are here used. The term Accepted, I
suppose he means it to be the same with Justified, because there is no other
quotation for it, and they may well be alike taken, and they are both alike
true of all that are indeed believers, without difference in respect of their
persons, as such, and so sons by faith, yet is not this acceptance and
Justification answerable in degree, to that which shall be in the resurrection
of the just, when their persons as Sons, and all their ways as becoming Sons,
will be alike accepted and justified, but not altogether so yet; yea in this
life even believers in whom the faith is, may be in that respect accepted and
justified as Sons, and yet some words, or act, and so a way of theirs rejected,
and condemned, and they in that not accepted or justified, but both reproved
and corrected.

No doubt but Moses and Aaron abode in the faith, Numb. 20.12.
and were accepted as the Saints of the Lord, yet their failing in an act of
faith, and not honoring the power, and freeness of Gods mercy, before the
people, was reproved, and they corrected for it.

No doubt but Peter abode in the faith and love of his Master, Man. 16.22.23.
and was accepted as a true disciple, yet not acting rightly in his faith, his
carnal counsel is rejected, as proceeding from some suggestion of Satan to whom
Christ as in Mat. 4. says; Depart, and Peter sharply reproved. 1 Cor. 11.30,
32.
No question but those corrected, with weakness, sickness, and some with death,
for so gracious an end, were true believers, and so accepted, but their
demeanor not suitable to their faith, was deeply reproved and chastened: And
the same I conceive of David, Psalm. 32.
though at one time foulely fallen, yet not utterly departed from the faith, and
his belief in God and adoration of him; for then what caused that great grief
and disquietness of heart, nor yet wholly out of favor of God in respect of
his person as the Lords servant, but in respect of his evil way disallowed, 1
King. 15.5.
reproved, and sorely afflicted: And this I conceive because David is affirmed
not to have turned aside, etc. all the days of his life (it is not said, save
only in that time, in which sure were many other matters, but) save only in
the matter of Vriah, Romans 3.22, 25. and 5.8 and 3.25. and 4, 5. and 10, 9, 10.
etc. And the word Accepted thus understood, is safe and good for all
believers, and so the word Justified also; But for the rest there are
quotations to be viewed.

Romans 5.1. The Apostle had before discovered what true faith is, in respect of
the object Christ, as having dyed, rose, etc. And the true believing begot by
the discovery of this object, which is therefore called faith; first, in the
beginning, bringing to, and closing with him; namely, an hearty believing, That
this Jesus is the Christ, and that he dyed for our sins, and rose for our
justification, and is the Lord of all, and the propitiation for our sins; this
is the first thing, in hearty believing whereof, we shall surely be saved.

Secondly, Romans 5.8.10. and 4.23, 24, 25.
In the proceeding of it, uniting to, and ingrafting into Christ, viz. That
through the belief of this foresaid, and the immense love, power, and
propitiousness, and good will of God commended here-through; believe in God,
and so rest on him for preservation in this grace to the enjoyment of the
inheritance, and so for the eternal life promised, Heb. 11.13.
which believing is formerly described to be a discerning, a being persuaded,
and a hearty operation etc. And all so believing without difference, are
justified by faith, which word or term is used to show the way of receiving
justification, even by faith, not to show that justification is completed, and
over, and past, for justification is still needed by believers, and in
believing daily received of them; whence also God is said not only to be the
justifier of him that believes on him that justifies the ungodly; and so to
be he that has justified the believer. Romans 4.5.
But to be the justifier of him that believes, and it is God that justifies.
Romans 3.26. and 8.33.
So as it is a continued flowing business for believers in all needs to be
receiving by faith, that is the only way of receiving, and that in which God
dispenses justification; Therefore being justified by faith [that is, by and
through Christ, by his blood, Romans 5.1, 2, ^ and 3.25. and 5.11. John. 1.12.
Act. 10.43 and 12.38, 39
the object of faith, received in and through believing on him] we have peace
with God, through Jesus Christ our Lord, by whom also we have access into
this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God, etc. And
it should be an evil work by any strange and lofty expressions, to trouble any
such believers about this faith.

Romans 8.32, 33-39. Speaks of that, whence the Apostles persuasion was raised,
and this persuasion not of and for himself alone; or some special and peculiar
Believers with him only: But of the whole society and body of Believers. 1 John
3.1, 2. speaks likewise of the whole society of Believers, Joh. 1.12. Gal.
3.26
Behold what manner of Love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be
called the Sons of God; Therefore the world knows us not, (owneth not us,
nor our faith and profession) because it knew not him (owned not God, in that
discovery of himself in his Son which he has set forth in the gospel) Beloved
now are we the sons of God (that is by faith) and it does not yet appear what
we shall be (that is, 1 Cor. 13, 12. Romans 8.23 Col. 3.4
how glorious and happy we shall be, we see yet but in part, we are but a
little like him, we have yet but the first fruits of the spirit) but when he
shall appear (that is, in glory) we shall be like him, for we shall see him
as he is: this is that which all true Believers do, and may look and wait for.
Ephe. 3.15. Joh. 1.12 Gal. 3.26
speaks of more than believers on the earth, and shows that all that are
believers in Christ, and those that have lived and died in the faith, have had
their name of Sons, from Christ the Son, and Believers now by virtue of
their union with him in believing, and from him, now are they called
Christians, and his house, etc. And it is confessed in a sense, he puts his
Name on them, though it be not here said, they are called after the name of
God; But let it be considered, that here is shown how the Apostle prayed for
them, Ephesians. 3.14.-19. as was in Chap. 1.18.-20. And surely for nothing but what
was good and needful for them, he does not puff them up with thoughts of
their seize, Ephesians. 1.13
because they had believed and were sealed with the holy spirit of promise, And
were quickened together with Christ, and were raised together, and made to sit
together in heavenly places in him, Ephesians. 2.5, 6, 8
and were saved by grace through faith, of the gift of God, therefore they had
and enjoyed these things he prayed for, and it was impossible for them to
miscarry, though they knew not that they had these things: and so wanted only
the knowledge in themselves of the assurance of their abiding: Nor does he
scare or terrify them, as if their faith were not of the right kind, and that
Christ and his holy spirit were not in them: But he acknowledging their faith
right, and them faithful in Christ, tells them now earnestly, and for what he
prays for them, Phil. 1.9, 10, 11. Col 1.9, 10, 11 1 These. 3.12, 13. and 5.23
2 These. 1.11, 12 Ephesians. 3.14, 15
that they may abide, and grow, and be preserved, and established in the faith;
and so found unblameable before him at his coming, As he did the like for the
Phillipians, and for the Colossians, and for the Thessalonians, and so likewise
for the Hebrews, chap. 13.20. And so here to the Ephesians, he lets them know,
To whom, and in whose name he prayed for them, even unto the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ; of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named:

In which are many things, encouraging both him; and them, to pray to God in
the name of Christ: As the exceeding greatness of the power of God that gave,
and raised Christ, Ephesians. 1.19 22 and 2.17, 18, 19 22. Heb. 3.5, 6
etc. The relation between the Father, and the Son, and his engagement to his
Son, by whom the ways of our approach to have access to God, was opened, the
fellowship, corporation, and body, he has received us into, and made us of,
even his own house and family, and so his interest in us, Ephesians 1.23. and 3 14
and ours in him, our Lord and the owner of this house,

And Lastly, That in putting his word in their heart and inabling them to
believe and confess the same, he has put his name upon them, so far, that
he is pleased to be called their God and Father, and they called his people,
and the declarers of his name, which with the rest, gives great consolation,
seeing he has promised to hear his people, that are called by his name, when
they humble themselves and pray, and seek his face, and pray toward, or in the
house that is called by his name, 2 Chronicles. 7.12-14 and 6.20-41
which as the old was a tipe, signifies Christ and his people, and so to pray
in faith in the Name of Christ, and in union with, and love of the brethren:
Joh. 16.23 Mar. 11.24, 25 Psalm. 65.1-4.
He being a God hearing prayers, and they blessed whom he chooses, and
causes to approach to him, that they may dwell in his house for they shall be
satified. And as this is great consolation for Believers confident praying; so
it has in it also a forcible and great admonition to Believers, to beware that
we dishonor not the Name that is put upon us; Romans 2.24
As miscarriages, in such as bear this Name; will do ten times more, then in
those that have not this Name upon them, whence that Tit. 2.10. So that all the
Family of God is named of Christ, is express here, and that God has put his
Name on them, is true, Instructive, Consolatory, and Admonitory: But when thus
expressed, called by the name of God, there needs some cautions to prevent vain
conceits etc. for they are not called Jehovah; or God, or the Father, or Jesus,
or the Christ, or the Holy Ghost, or the Creator of all things, or the Redeemer
of mankind, or the sanctifier of Gods chosen, or the Lord of hoasts, or the
Almighty, or the Truth Love, Wisdom it self, etc. no not so; but the Name put
on them, is the Name of that report of his goodness, in his Doctrine, of which
they are made Believers and professors, and so he is called their God. Father,
Savior; etc. And they his Israel, his People, Sons, Christians, etc. And yet
here is another caution, namely that this family will one day be more pure,
and have a new name given them after their total victory and conquest or his
Name put on them in a more glorious manner, when that 2 Cor. 5.21. will be
completely fulfilled as is there promised, when without controversy, there
will be amongst them no finne, nor possibility of sinning, or falling: but the
family on earth is not so yet, and though the spirits of just men be perfect,
and under the Altar, and out of all danger, yet want they their bodies, and so
that fullness they shall enjoy in the resurrection of the just. But that part
of the family that is here below, are yet in mortal bodies, and so are not yet
any of them altogether without sin, nor are all things that offend yet purged
out, the believers and Saints, in and of this part of the family here on earth,
are yet in a warfare, beset with enemies, within, and without, temptations from
lusts within, terrors and allurements, from the world without, Satan and his
Ministers, with pretenses of light, striving to seduce them from the faith, and
to turn them out of the way, whence they are often warned from God, to stand
fast in the faith, to be sober, and watchful, to put on the whole Armor of God,
to fight the good fight of Faith, to cleave to Christ in whom there is
compleatness for them, to sow to the spirit, of whom they shall reap life
everlasting. And to take heed that they be not deceived, and that they depart
not through an evil heart of unbeleefe, and many such warnings, with ground of
the same.

Now of this part of the family here on earth; and of the faith and holiness
in them, and so of such believers and Saints, is our whole discourse: And so in
the controversy between some brethren; The Question is? whether, such as are
admitted into this family, in that part of it, that is here below, and have the
name of God and Christ so put on them, as it is put on his people here below?
whether they may not, by neglect of their watch, and the warning given them,
be overcome to such degrees of sinning, as to depart from the faith, and so
be cast out of this family, and have this name taken off them again?

To which I answer, Oh that none more might! but yet we need to be heedful:
for if we look at our tipes, as the Temple and place God chose for his worship,
and put his name there, was a tipe of those by faith built on Christ. 1 Pet.
2.3.5
So its not without its use to us, that where God sets his name at the first;
yet for the wickedness of the people there, Jer. 7.10-14
he removed it away from thence: And threatened to do the same (yea he has
done it) to Jerusalem, and the house there called by his name, or it we look
at Israel of old, was not that people called Israel, Isa. 1.10.21.
after for their wickedness called Sodom; Jer. 2.21
and that called a faithful City, afterward for their filthiness called a
harlot: yea, was not the noble Vine of Gods planting, 1 Cor. 10.1-11.18
afterward by evil ways degenerated into the plant of a strange Vine? And are
not these things writ for examples, and warnings to us: but to leave pressing
the tipes, and come nigher even to the truth it self: If this family be the
kingdom of God here on earth, as I suppose none questions; then what means
that saying of our Savior. Mat. 8.11, 12
Many shall come from the East, and West, and shall sit down with Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; But the children of the kingdom
shall be cast out into utter darkness, 1 Timothy 3.15 2 Timothy 20, 21 16, 17, 18.
with 1 Timothy 1.19, 20. Isa. 60.21 Zach. 14.21 Psalm. 144.11, 14, 15, 16
etc. And if this family be the house of God, which is the Church of the
living God, compared to a great house, then sure the vessels, admitted, and
taken into it, that are unmeet for the Masters use, are such as are departed
from the faith, they once had, when they were admitted and used; and are
therefore to be cast out: Surely that time has not yet been, nor now is, but
is yet to come, of which it is said, Thy people shall be all righteous, etc.
This will be when the Church is wholly rid of strange children, that there is
no more going, out, etc So that as yet the being in this family and called by
his name, Is no sufficient argument, to prove that all that so are, in the time
of this warfar, will without all doubt, so continue and remain for ever; it is
more safe for us to watch over our selves, Gal. 5.4 1 Timothy 1.19, 20 2 Timothy 2.18
and 4.3.4 1 Timothy 4.1, 2
and over one another, in taking the warnings given us, in the Scripture, where
also it is affirmed, that some have fallen from grace, some have made Shipwreck
of faith and a good conscience, some have erred from the Faith, and overthrown
the faith of others: yea, and there also the spirit has expressly affirmed,
that in these latter days; some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to
seducing spirits, and doctrins of devils; yea, many turn to fables, which we
with sorrow for them, see fulfilled in many, of whom it cannot with any
evidence of truth be said, that they were all and every of them hypocrites or
that their faith was not saving; yea, some of them so strong in that opinion
that they counted it no less than blasphemy to say, that there was any
possibility, for them, or any true believer and Saints to fall away: But I will
proceed no farther, I have considered Mr. Owens stating the question and his
proofs, and observed his own rule in going to the Law and Testimony, where is
not a word found to countenance any kind of faith but one, of which the
mixtures in his first kind, and the lofty, and by expressions in his second
kind, are no part, but that which is faith indeed, in either, or both of them,
is one and the same faith.

CHAP. XXIII.
The Conclusion.

AS I began, so I end, To the Law, and Testimony. Mind what is written; see
what is there plainly affirmed and testified, how the question is there stated,
and answered, that believe and hold fast, and be not waved from it by any
Queries, glosses, interpretations, or subtle, and Scholastical stating of the
question by men, who, it will appear by such courses, strive more for victory
than truth, and seek more for the honor of some sort of men, than of the
testimony of Jesus, and spying their inability to overturn the evidence of
truth in that testimony of truth plainly asserted, they devise Queries and
glosses, and then state the question, so as that they strive to deny, and that
they maintain, is a mere fancy; that none that hold forth the testimony of
Christ, have contended for, or against, that so they may seem to have the
victory, and then cast a blemish on the plain sayings of the Holy Ghost, to
make men's devices appear lovely; and so put to shame the believers of the plain
testimony of Christ. And how near to this Mr. Owen comes, I leave for others to
consider, only in what is written these things appear proved.

1 That in affirming two kinds of faith wrought by the Spirit in men, upon
account whereof they are called Believers, and Saints, and both really true in
their kind. He plainly goes besides, and contrarieth the Scripture, that
tells us but one kind really true.

2 That in his first kind of faith, there are so many mixtures put in, that
are no efficacies of the holy Spirit in the Gospel, nor any parts of faith at
all, and if they be taken as ingredients and parts of the faith he mentions,
then is that faith he calls really true in its kind, no faith at all in
Scripture language, nor any there, on the account of such a faith, called
Believers and Saints; nor is it the faith pleaded for, and called saving, by
those he opposes. And if those mixtures be removed and left out, and that
stand for the faith true in its kind, which is so indeed, then it is one and
the same, with all that he says of the second kind of faith, that is by
Scripture found true indeed, and then he has secretly, yet plainly, yielded
all that, which through his book he opposes in another; for this faith he
yields men may fall from.

3 That in his second kind of faith, he has put in strange and
unscripture-like expressions, and assertions, in every of his Concernments,
specially the former three of them, which being taken as necessary to the being
of this second kind of faith, that it may be true in its kind, then is there
no such faith and holiness set forth in the Scripture, nor any such believers
and Saints on this earth, what ever by fancy or man's approbation some may
conceive: Nor does all or any of the quotations, express or prove such a faith
according to the terms asserted, to differ it from the first kind, so that the
faith and holiness, the perseverance whereof (such as no possibility of falling
away) he asserteth, is such a faith as is not, as no man has, otherwise then
by conceit, a fancy which those he opposes, never vented, to bring it within
the lists of a controversy. And so in striving for this, he was quite besides
the business in controversy, to give any answer thereto, the question being
not about fancy, but truth: As for the reason why he thus stated the question,
as to evade the business, I leave that to himself, and others to consider.

4. That in both his kinds of faith, I find that that which is true, and which
the quotations to them, do either express or prove for to be says; It is for
the kind of it, in both, but one and the same kind of faith, (as has been
fully shown in treating of both) only it is so darkened, by the mixtures, put
in the one, and the strange expressions, and lofty terms put in the other, that
no man that takes all he says for truth, can see any door for him to come
into the faith, or any certain way to know when he has it; yea it will more
hinder such as have it not, from faith, and such as have it, from perseverance,
then all said by him whom he opposes, and leaves men for their consolation, to
their fancy, and the judgment of their Rabbis, to rely on, whereas the faith
that is true, saving and justifying, is clearly set forth in the Scripture in
the testimony of Christ, as in this Treatise has been shown in every part
thereof, let the Scriptures quoted be read, and their expressions believed, and
so let the Reader discern, and judge accordingly.

If any reply, That when there is a controversy about faith, It is then
needful to state the question, that it may be seen what is pleaded for, and who
plead for the true faith indeed.

I answer, The object and foundation of faith being discovered in the plain
sayings of the Gospel, and the inward belief, and acknowledgement of that stood
for according to plain sayings in the Gospel, the question is well stated in
the plain affirmations of the Gospel, and none need require any other stating
of the question but such as cannot endure to stand to those sayings, from which
none that are wise will be waved: And the truth is the controversy was not
about the faith it self, but about the possibility or impossibility of such as
at any time have attained to believe, to fall away again, that so help may
accordingly be administered to them, and they exhorted to receive and use the
same, to prevent danger; and the diverse kinds of true faith, is an invention
brought in, to strengthen the pursuit of the controversy; and who shall state
a question for two kinds of faith, true in their kind, when there is but one,
and what will become of all that is builded on a question so stated? or who
that is wise will regard it to be waved by it: Judge: But if any will still be
violent to have the question stated, let them first consider, and plainly
answer this one question, namely,

Quest. What they do indeed mean by faith, whether the object of faith, or the
grace of believing in that object; for this is clear in the Scripture, That as
our Fathers confiding, and trusting, and hoping in God, was called their Trust,
and their Hope, so also God himself in whom they trusted, is by them confessed
their Hope, and their Trust: Psalm. 71.5. Jer. 17.17. Psalm. 40.4. 1 Timothy 1.1.
And he is pronounced Blessed, that makes the Lord his Trust. And so now God
has sent forth his Son, and taken up his dwelling in him the Man Jesus Christ,
he is therefore likewise called, God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ our
hope; And so the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, and Savior of the world, as
he has taken the nature of man, and dyed for our sins, and rose for our
justification offered the acceptable sacrifice, sits at the right hand of
God, filled with Spirit, etc. So as who ever believes in him, shall receive
forgiveness of sins, etc. This the object of faith, and the testimony of Christ
in the Gospel holding forth this, being that in which he is discovered and
discerned, in believing of which, believed and received, that is the mediate
object of faith, and Christ thus set forth in, and by the Gospel, is called,
The faith, even the same faith that Paul did once persecute, and after preach.
And this faith is one, and but one.

But I suppose the controversy is not about this, though the evil managing the
controversy, has strengthened many in denying this. But here the business
controverted, is about the grace of believing. Now every believing is not
faith, but that which is begotten by the declaration of the object of faith,
and in believing it closes with it. And so faith is still one, as has been
shown at large. Part 3. Chap. 17. and elsewhere. And so if answer be given,
That by faith is meant such a believing as is begotten by the testimony of
Christ, and closes with Christ in that testimony, then sure the Question is
stated in the Answer given, but if it be urged, it need to be better opened: I
answer it has been often shown, how the Scripture does it, in many places
plainly; and so far to yield to all that is right even in tradition of Fathers
also. Its known what some of them have said, and others from them have preached
who have said the right belief is this,

A believing God to Be, and believing of God, in that which he says, and
believing in God for all he has promised: This, all this, nothing less than
this, is said to be a right belief; True it is, He that believes not God to
be, and Jehovah to be that very true God, is as an Atheist, and has no true
belief at all.

But he that believes God to be, and Jehovah to be that very God, does so far
believe a right; yet if he believe him not true in his sayings, and
demonstrations of his goodness, he is yet wanting of a right belief, yea his
believing is not saving without this.

If he believes both these, his believing is right and saving, and if he abide
in it, and mind what he believes, it will save him so as to bring him to
believe in God for what he promises, which when he attaineth, he begins to
be saved so far as he is a true believer and has faith, even true faith: And
as I conceive the Scripture it self also holds forth this in Heb 11.6. For he
that comes to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them
that diligently seek him: Here is the belief of his being express, and the
belief of his sayings, in his demonstrated goodness, express and believing in
him, intimated in coming to him. And this to prove faith in Henoch, and in his
time, when though all the goodness of God to man-ward was through a Mediator,
yet the Mediator, and his work was not then so clearly revealed as since, Jesus
Christ carried our nature into heaven, and the fulness of the Godhead dwells in
him bodily; of which his first witnesses have testified, saying, We know that
the Son of God is come, 2 John 5.20.
and has given us an understanding that we may know him that is true, and we
are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ; This is the true God,
and eternal life: So then we have not another faith, or an other manner of
believing, but the same object of faith brought nigher, and set forth more
clearly, to be in the same manner more firmly believed in, even God in Christ,
and so Christ, and God in him.

1 To believe this public man to be, even the second man, the Lord from
heaven, the spiritual man, that has in himself as the public man, suffered
for the sins of mankind, that came in by the first public man's transgression,
and restored the nature of man, and presented it spotless in himself before the
Father, and the Father has taken his well pleasedness, and dwelling in him, and
set him forth the propitiation for the sins of the world, the Savior of the
world. That whoever believe in him may have everlasting life, And that Jesus is
this Christ, the Son of the living God.

2 To believe his sayings by his Spirit in the Gospel, all true and good, the
very sayings of the God of truth in, and by him.

3 To believe in him, in Christ Jesus, in his blood, and so in God, in him for
all that he has promised, and so for the Kingdom to come, this according to
the description of the Ancient, is Evangelical faith, not another kind, but
the same more bright and fully appearing and enjoyed, all which has been shown
in first, second, third, and fourth parts of this Treatise, yea in the residue
also at large.

And though, as at first mentioned, it is accepted where this glorious Gospel
is not given, yet where it is displayed, if the first be wanting, there is no
right Gospel-beleeving, but that believed with the heart, will effect the other
two, which being in any measure effected, such do not only believe truly, but
are true believers, and have right faith, that is saving and justifying.

And as for Scripture-stating, and explicating the question, it is often shown
already, and all agreeing with that here said, to set it forth by a definition,
I will not presume, only the nearest that I find of that nature, I will
mention, it is in Heb. 1.2. Now faith is the substance (ground or confidence)
of things hoped for, the evidence of things hoped for, the evidence of things
not seen. By faith here, it is clear, is meant such a belief of Gods evidenced
goodness, as is begotten by his own declaration, evidence, or testimony and
closes with the same in believing, according to his evidence given. And that
he speaks of the object of faith evidenced by divine testimony, received and
closed with in believing, is evident throughout the whole Epistle, of which
evidences through mediums, in the rumor of that report in Paradise, the
evidences in works of Creation and Providence were the first, and then more
fully by word and oracles, and then most full and clear by his Son, the
standing testimony of whom is in the Gospel as now come forth, and this is
plain, Chap. 1.1, 2, 3, and 2.1, 2, 3, 4. and 12.25. of faith begot by
evidences, through the first mediums: Examples in this 11. Chapter, from verse
4. to verse. 7. of more fullness added in more clear discovery by word in the
mediums begetting faith, examples from verse. 8. to 31. of the adding to the
medium, the written word, and prophesies, and faith begotten thereby. Examples
from verse. 32.37 and then the most clear and full discovery in, and through
Christ the Author and finisher of faith, Chap. 12.2. And yet all the way but
one faith, and for the nature and property of this faith, he says, It is the
substance (or ground, or representation, or confidence) of things ^o^ed for;
The evidence (argument or proof) of things not seen.

1 The evidences and testimony given from God, 1 John ^.9, Romans 1.18, 19, 20
and 10 21. Joh. 3.19. 2 Thessalonians 2.10. Romans 10.6, 8, 9
has in it and brings with it, such light, power, demonstration, and evidence
of truth and goodness, as is fit and able to open the eyes to discern the
manifestation, and to gain credit, and believe, yea there is more in it, to
gain belief, then in the testimony of any men to gain belief to things of men
affirmed by them, yea if men do not close their eyes, harden their heart,
unrighteously hold and detain, and refuse its operations, it will draw to
believe and so save, and for that end it comes nigh to the mouth, and the heart
of man. 2 This Testimony, evidence, 1 John 5.10. and 1.1, 2, 3 Romans 1.16. 1
These. 2.13. Romans 5.1-5 Phil. 2.1, 2
and demonstration of God believed, and so received, he that believes has
the Testimony and evidence in himself, and in or with that Testimony; Christ by
his divine presence in the virtue of his oblation, and in that the Father, in
his love streaming in the heart, and so this word or Testimony believed,
works savingly and powerfully in the heart, yea it drinks in of the
influences of Christ, from the right hand of God, and carries the heart and
spirit in, and makes things absent and to come, as present in their virtue,
solace, and comfort to the heart, they having the word and Testimony of
Almighty God, his power, truth, mercy, faithfulness, his son as a witness of
all; This is ground sufficient for all they hope for, and evidence enough for
them to believe and declare to others, the truth of those things that are not
seen, about Creation Redemption, the person of the Redeemer, and what he has
done, does, and will do, the resurrection of the dead, the new heaven and new
earth, etc.
So Faith is not such a thing, as he that has it, is left to build his Faith,
on man's Testimony, and to have a Ministry all his life long, to tell him
whether his faith be right or no, though Ministry is profitable for his
growth and fruitfulness, but Faith has its evidence in it self. And this the
Apostie proves by many demonstrations in such as had it, as 1 That God approves
and bears witness to such. Heb. 11.1, 2.3, 4, 5, 7
2 That it opens mysteries to them and gives them understanding in things not
seen with the eye, nor comprehended by reason. 3 It stregthens and encourages
to approach to God. 4 It inables them to walk with God, yea to do and suffer
great things, and to wait with assurance of enjoying a Kingdom in his season,
yea so evidencing, and powerful is Faith. When Gods spoke in diverse manners, or
by par^^^^, how much more now he speaks by and through his Son, as set forth
in the Gospel?


And if any desire a Description of this believing, Lo it is all express in
Heb. 11.13. and plain in three words.

1 A discerning according to the demonstration of his goodness, to look to,
mind, incline the ear, and so a discerning. 2 A persuasion or credit giving not
reasoning against, but believing his testimony as true and good. 3 An embracing
it, when its believed with all acceptance and delight; that is true believing;
and the grace of God so believed, operateth in the heart and life: as follows
in ver. 13, 14, 15, 16.
But these things are all shown at large before, yea so as the object of Faith
is so set forth in Scripture, that all might believe, and such assurance given
to believers as may encourage both to believe, and persevere believing: to help
the reader whereto, I leave him to consider what is writ in the Treatise, and
desire that what the scripture plainly says, and in the plain sayings of the
Gospel affirms, may in their own plain import, and simplicity of asseveration
be received: Page 26. in 2 Epistle p. 8
yea Mr. Owen consents in this also: besides all his sayings forementioned;
saying (...) in his Epistle to the learned; that which we account our wisdom,
and learning, may if too rigorously attended, be our Folly, when we think to
sharpen the reason of the Scripture, we may straighten the efficacy of the
spirit of it; Its often times more effectual in its own liberty, then when
restrained to our methods of arguing, and the weapons of it keener in their own
soft breathings, then when sharpened in the Forge of Aristotle; And or of Ramus
either.
There is a way of persuasion, and conviction in the Scriptures, that is more
Divine and sublime, than to be reduced to any rules of Art; that men can reach
unto. God in his word instructs men to make them wise unto salvation:
Sillogismes are not (doubtless) the only way of making men wise, with humane
wisdom; much less divine: so far he. If he should or have warved from his
own rule, he can not but be willing in that to be refused, so that with
consent, we all say what is written, how read thou; Believe the scripture,
And the Lord in mercy make us ready and constant in embracing the Truth in his
sayings, as prays the unworthiest of all his people.
