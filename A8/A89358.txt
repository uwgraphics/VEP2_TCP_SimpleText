A most excellent Ballad of an Old Man and his Wife, Who in their want and
misery sought to their Children for succor, by whom they were disdained, and
scornfully sent them away succourless, and Gods vengeance showed on them for
the same. Tune of, Priscillca.




IT was an Old man and his Poor Wife,
in great distrefs did fall,
They were so feeble with age God wot,
they could not work at all:
A Gallant Son they had
which lived wealthily,
To him they went with a full intent,
to ease their misery:
Alack and alas for woe.
A hundred miles when they had gone,
with many a weary step,
At length they saw their Sons fair house,
which made their hearts to leap,
They sat them on the Green
their Hose and Shoos to trim,
They put their bands about their Neeks,
against they should enter in:
Alack, etc.
Unto the Door with trembling Joints
when these Old couple came,
The Woman with a shaking hand,
the Old Man blind and lame:
Full mannerly they knocked,
fearing for to offend,
At last their Son frowningly came,
unto them in the end;
Alack, etc.
Good folks, quoth. he, what would you have?
methinks you are too bold,
Why get you not home to your own Country
now you are lame and old?
With that they both replied,
with sorrow, care. and grief,
Here are we come to thee our son,
for succor and relief:
Alack and alas for woe.
THis is thy Father gentle Son,
and I thy loving Mother,
That brought thee up so tenderly,
and loved thee above all other,
I bore thee in my womb,
these breasts did nourish thee,
And as it chant'd, I often danced,
thee on my tender knee;
Alack and alas for woe.
And humbly now we entreat
our dear and loving Son,
That thou will do for us in our age,
as we for you have done:
Now nay not so, he said,
your suit is all in vain,
It Is best for you I tell you true,
to get you home again:
Alack, etc.
The worlds not now as when I was born,
all things are grown more dear,
My charge of children like wife is great,
as plainly does appear,
The best that I can do,
will hardly them maintain,
Therefore I say, be packing away,
and get you hame again.
Alack, etc.
The old man with his Hat in his Hand,
full many a Leg did make,
The woman wept and wrung her hands,
and prayed for Christ his sake,
Not so to send them back,
distressed and undone,
But let us lie in some Barn here by,
Quoth the, my loving Son:
By no means he would thereto consent
but sent them soon away,
Quoth he, you know the peril of the Law,
if long time here you stay,
The Stocks and Whiping-poast
shall fall unto your share,
Then take you heed, and with all speed;
to your Country repair.
Alack, etc.
Away then went this (...)
full sad in heart and mind,
With weeping tears his Wife did lament,
their Son was so unkind:
Thou wicked Wretch, quoth they,
for this thy cruel deed,
The Lord send thee as little pity,
when thou do stand in need:
Alack, etc.
His Children hearing their Father set
his Parents thus at naught,
In short time after to have his Land,
his death they subtillty wrought:
What cause have we quoth they,
more kindness to express,
Then he unto his Parents did,
in their great wretchedness:
Alack, etc.
They Murdered him in piteous sort,
they weighed not his entreats;
The more he prayed compassionately,
the greater were his threats
Speak not to us quoth they,
for thou the death shall dye,
And with that word a dagger and sword,
they mangled him monstrously:
Alack, etc.
When they had got his Silver and Gold,
according to their mind,
They buried him in a stinking Ditch
were* no man should him find:
But now behold and see
Gods vengeance on them all,
To gain their Gold their Couzin came,
and slew t^em great and small,
Alack, etc.
He came among them with a great Club
in dead of time of the night,
Yea two of the Sons he brained therewith*
and taking of his flight
The Murderer taken was,
and suffered for the same,
Deservedly for that cruelty,
Alack and alas therefore, etc.
