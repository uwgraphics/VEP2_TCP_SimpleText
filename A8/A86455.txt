The Earl of Holland his Speech.
MY Lord Mayor, and you Gentlemen and Inhabitants of the City, we are commanded
by both Houses of Parliament to come hither, and to deliver to you that are
their great Assistant, an account, and knowledge of a Resolution they have
taken to send a Petition to His Majesty, grounded upon these Reasons; The first
is, That there is a duty toward God to seek Peace, indeed to seek it with all
men, therefore properly and naturally with the King: this they are directed to
do, if Peace flies from us, to pursue it, to follow it, this is their holy
duty. They have likewise taken into their thoughts too, seriously, that that
may concern the safety of the Kings person, being engaged in this last Battle,
through his own resolutions and adventures, to put his person in some hazard;
they have a tenderness of that, and amongst other considerations, it is that
that prevails with them, to desire that He may not be in danger (if it be
possible) by a further pursuance of this action, that in all probability must
come to a second blow, and that speedily, if there be not some other way taken
for an Accommodation. There is another reason that they are likewise persuaded
the more willingly thus to Petition, and to desire Peace, that is, for the
saving and recovering the Kingdom of Ireland, in the distress that you have
long seen it; they know the impossibility for this Kingdom to relieve that, if
we continue in these distractions, and in these confusions, within our selves;
and therefore believing nothing can contribute, or conduce toward the
recovering of that Kingdom, and the delivering of those persons indeed from
danger that you have sent thither, they believe nothing can possibly do it, but
our quietness and our peace here, if that Kingdom should fall into other hands,
such hands as it may likely and probably do, what inconvenience, what danger
must fall upon this Kingdom, from the power, and the neighborhood of that, you
all must imagine. They do likewise consider this, that in the distractions
amongst our selves, what advantages foreign States may take, when our own hands
are we^kned, and a desolation upon the Kingdom, universally through the whole
Kingdom, those that do malign our Religion, and their consciences direct them
to destroy it, as well as their ambitions, to make a Conquest of the Nation,
how open we shall be likewise to them, for any prejudice, or any danger may
fall upon us: Besides, they have a consideration of the whole Kingdom, that
have so long continued in peace, in the blessings of peace, so long in the beds
of peace, and in the arms of peace, (for this hundred years there have been
no civil divisions, nor distractions within this Kingdom) and those abundances
that peace has procured, and those happinesses likely to be devoured in any
State by the sword of War, as in every part of the Kingdom already, you see
how it begins to destroy, with what height, with what power, with what
insolency; these are considerations, that have made them believe, that as it
is a duty to God, it is that which they owe likewise to the King, it is that
that they owe to the Kingdom in which they have been born and bred; it is
likewise a discharge of their own consciences that every body may see, that it
is not their faults, if Peace be not procured; but though they are thus
resolved, and upon these Reasons to offer a Petition, and to seek Peace by all
the ways that is possible, yet they have commanded me to let you know, that
as they desire Peace, they will prepare for War, they have given directions
that this day my Lord General shall carry out his Army out of the City, there
is a R^^devouz appointed, they shall there draw themselves together in such a
condition, as we are very confident and very hopeful we shall be able to
defend it; we are likewise resolved, and so I am commanded to deliver to you,
that as we have long kept together with resolutions to defend our Privileges,
our Religion, our Liberties, and Laws; so we will continue in the same
resolution, and the same purpose to do so, nothing shall deter us from it; if
we can find peace from his Majesty upon these conditions, that Religion, and
Laws, and our Liberties, and all, may be happily secured to the Kingdom, and
to you all, we shall be glad of it, and it will be a blessing to us, and to you
all; if it cannot be done, we are resolved, (and so I am commanded to let you
know) nothing shall discourage us, neither danger, nor power, nor any thing;
but if we cannot maintain our Religion, our Laws, and our Liberties, we will
perrish and die for it.

Master John Pym his Speech.
MY Lord Major, and you Gentlemen of this famous City of London, and that will
make it much more famous by these noble affections, which you have showed still
to the public good, and by yielding so much Aid, and so much encouragement
as you have done to the P^rliament in maintaining it* there is little to be
added to that that was said by this noble Lord, who has represented to you,
the sense of both Houses, the reasons, and motives upon which they did desire
peace, motives indeed that have wrought with us from the beginning of this
War to this time, for we should never have stepped one step toward War if
we might have had, or hoped for such a peace as might have secured Religion and
Liberty, and the public good of the Kingdom; but truly ill counsel did
exclude us from such hope; we now conceive that the King having seen the
courage of his Subjects, having seen the danger of his own Person, so much
blood shed about him, that he will be more tractable to good conditions of
Peace, then he would have been before, and that is the reason, why we do
think fit to try him once more after this battle that has been lately
fought, before it come to another battle again; It Is true, that this may seem
a resolution contrary to that that was opened to you within these few days,
but you will conceive, that all great counsels they are subject to alter their
resolutions, according as matters alter, and as the apprehensions of matters
alter, for if things appear more clearer, and hopeful to them, at one time,
then at another, it is no dishonor for them to vary according to their
appearance, Judgments, and best reasons, so long as they do it with affections
to the best purpose, which you may rest assured the Parliament has done; and
though we desire Peace very much, yet a peace to betray Religion, and to betray
our Liberties we shall always esteem worse then War; Therefore we shall
put it to a very quick issue, if the KING receive the Petition, to make such
Propositions, as you may see, whether you shall be secured in your Religion,
in your Religion with a hope of Reformation, such a Reformation as may maintain
the power of Religion, and the purity of Religion, as well as the name of
Religion; for we shall not be contented with the name, without a Reformation,
that shall maintain the power of it. And we shall pursue the maintenance of our
Liberties, Liberties that may not only be the Laws and Statutes, but Liberties
that may be in practice, and in execution; and to take such course, that you
may have the effects of them in truth: For to have printed Liberties, and not
to have Liberties in truth, and realities, is but to mock the Kingdom; and I
hope we shall take care for that in the second place. And we shall take care to
maintain the Dignity, and the Honor of Parliament, for that is that that will
be a lasting security to you in your Liberty and Religion. We shall take care
in the fourth place to Answer the affections of the City of London, That we
will not consent to any thing that shall be prejudicial to them; We will
preserve them in the highest degree of Honor, that ever this City of London
was in; and truly, it is now in the highest degree of Honor that ever it was;
for you have carried your selves in such a regard to the Public, that never
any of your Predecessors did so before; and therefore we shall in a Peace be as
careful of you, as of our selves; and you may be assured of this, that if we
have not this Peace, our Lives, our Pains, our Estate^, they shall all join
with you, in maintaining that with the Sword, which we shall not get in an
humble way by Petition; and this we shall bring to a quick issue. Therefore I
shall only move you (as I am commanded to do from the Parliament) that you
will not think there is any fainting on our parts, that we are more cold, and
less affectionate to any of these good ends, then heretofore we have been; but
that we would compass them with more ^ecure advantage: For if you can get
these by Peace, you will have great advantages by it; you will hinder foreign
invasions from beyond the Seas, you will quickly be able to master the Rebels
in Ireland; you will quickly be able to suppress the Papists that begin to
rise in England; that you shall have a perpetual security, that they shall
never be able to hurt you more; Therefore, if we can have such a Peace, without
further hazard and bloodshedding, we shall praise God, and esteem it as a
great blessing; but if not, pray lay not down the same spirits; for we have the
same hearts, and multitudes of spirits, and the Kingdom inclinable to us; where
the King has passed, many to save their estates and lives, have showed
themselves but men; for it was not to be thought that single Countries should
maintain themselves against an Army, but they have hearts as they had before,
and no doubt but they will join with us, with more alacrity, when they see we
have desired Peace, by all the ways we could, and cannot have it; we shall by
this means satisfy our own consciences, we shall satisfy many Members of
Parliament, that desired it might be put on this way, we shall satisfy many of
the Kingdom too, that have held themselves indifferent, but when they see
there is no hope of Peace, in such a way, without blood, certainly they will
stand to us for Religion, and Liberty, which must be destroyed if we cannot
secure them without War: Therefore I shall commend to you, that you would not
let fall any part of your contributions, for it is that, that must maintain
the Army, and entertain no ill apprehensions of the Parliament, but go on so
as you have done, and I hope it will be such an end as God may have all the
glory, and you all comfort.

FINIS.
