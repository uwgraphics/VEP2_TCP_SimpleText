A DIALOGUE Betwixt TOM AND DICK The former a COVNTRY-MAN, The other a CITIZEN,
Presented to his EXCELLENCY and the COUNCIL of STATE, at DRAPERS-Hall in
LONDON, March 28. 1660.
(To the Tune of I Will never love thee more.)
Tom. NOW would I give my life to see,
This wondrous Man of might.
Dick. Do see that Jolly Lad? That Is he;
I Will warrant him he is right.
There Is a true Trojan in his Face:
Observe him over and over.

Dick. Chorus.
Come Tom; If ever GEORGE be base,
Never trust good fellow more.
He Is none of that Phantastique Brood,
That murder, while they pray:
That trusse, and cheat us, for our good;
(All, in a Godly way,)
He drinks no Blood, and they no Sack
into their gutts will pour.
Chorus.
But if GEORGE does not do the knack.
Never trust good fellow more.
His quiet Conscience needs no guard;
He Is brave, but full of pity.

Tom. Yet, by your leave, he knocked so hard,
H'adlike t'awak'd the City.

Dick. Fool, 'Twas the Rump that let a Fart,
The Chains and Gates it tore.
Chorus.
But if GEORGE bears not a true heart,
Never trust Good Fellow more.

Tom. Your City-blades are cunning Rookes;
How rarely you collogue him?
But when your Gates flew off the Hooks,
You did as much be-rogue him.

Dick. Pug'h. -- 'Twas the Rump did only Feel,
The blows the City bore.
Chorus.
But if GEORGE be'nt as true as Steel,
Never trust Good Fellow more.

Dick. Come, by this Hand, we'll crack a quare,
Thou'll pledge his health, I trow.

Tom. Tope boy, Dick -- A lusty dish my heart,
Away w'ot; Tom. -- Let it go.
Drench me you slave in a full Bowl,
I Will take it, an' twere a score.

Dick. Chorus.
Nay, if GEORGE be'nt a hearty Soul,
Never trust Good Fellow more.

Tom. But hark you, Sirrah, we are to loud,
He Will hang us, by, and by.

Dick. Me'thinks, he should be vengeance proud?
No more then thee, or I.

Tom. Why then I Will give him the best Blade,
That ere the Bilbo wore,

Dick. Chorus.
If GEORGE prove not a Bonny Lad,
Never trust Good Fellow more.

Tom. 'Twas well he came, we'd mawll'd the Tail;
-- We Have all thrown up our Farms.
And from the Musket, to the Flayle,
Put all our men in Arms.
The Girls had taken the Members down,
Never faw such things before.

Dick. If GEORGE speak not the Town our own,
Never trust Good Fellow more.

Dick. But prithee, are the Folk so mad?

Tom. -- So mad, say; -- The're undone,
There Is not a penny to be had;
And every Mothers Son
Must fight, if he intend to eat,
Grow valliant, now he is poor.

Dick. Chorus.
Come -- yet if GEORGE don't do the feate,
Never trust Good Fellow more.

Tom. -- Why Richard, it is a Devilish thing,
We Are not left worth a groate.
My Doll, has sold her wedding-ring,
And Su has pawnd her Coat.
The Sniv'ling Rogues abused our Squire,
And called our Mistress Whore.

Dick. Chorus.
Yet -- If GEORGE don't what we desire,
Never trust Good Fellow more.

Tom: -- By this good day; I did but speak;
They took my Py-ball'd Mare;
And put the Carri'on Wench to the squeak:
(Things go against the Hair).
Our Prick-ear'd Cor'nell looks as bigg
Still, as he did before.

Ric. Chorus.
And yet if GEORGE don't humme his Gigg,
Never trust Good Fellow more.
'Faith, Tom: our Case is much at one;
We Are broke for want of Trade;
Our City's baffled, and undone,
Betwixt the Rump, and Blade.
We Have emptied both our Veins and Baggs,
Upon a Factious Score.
Chorus.
If GEORGE Compassion not our Rags,
Never trust Good Fellow more

Tom. But what do think should be the Cause,
Whence all these Mischiefs spring?

Ric. Our damned breach of Oaths and Laws;
Our Murder of the King.
We have bin Slaves since CHARLES his Reign,
We lived like Lords before.
Chorus.
If GEORGE don't set all right again,
Never trust Good Fellow more.

Tom. Our Vicar -- (And he is one that knows)
Told me once, -- I know what: --
(And yet the Thief is woundy Close)

Ric. It Is all the better; -- That.
H'as too much Honesty and Wit,
To let his Tongue run over:
Chorus.
If this prove not a lucky hitt,
Never trust Good Fellow more.
Shall's ask him, what he means to do?

Tom. -- 'Good faith, with all my heart;
Thou make the better Leg of the Two:
Take thou the better part.
I Will follow, if thou't lead the Van.

Ric. Content; -- I Will march before.
Chorus.
If GEORGE prove not a Gallant man,
Never trust Good Fellow more.
My Lord: -- in us the Nation craves
But what you're bound to do.

Tom. -- We have lived Drudges:

Ric. -- And We Slaves;

Both. We would not die so too.
Chorus.
Restore us but our Laws again;
The unborn shall thee adore:
If GEORGE denies us his Amen;
Never trust Good Fellow more.
