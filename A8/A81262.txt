The Case is altered: BOTH THY CASE, AND MY Case, and every man's Case.

With a direction for a speedy present way to make every thing Dog-cheap.

Printed in the Year 1649.

The case is altered.
THere are as many Cases as there are living creatures, the cases of our bodies
are our skins, and the case of our souls is our bodies: And as a leaden sword
may have a golden scabbard, or a wooden dagger a velvet sheath: so many a
fair rich case covers a foul poor carcass, and many a beautiful outside is
the case of a treacherous inside; for Lucifer was a bright Angel, Saul a
goodly Personage, Absolon fair, and Jezabell of rare and painted exquisite
beauty. These were once in very good, (or great) places, and cases, (as many
thousands more have been.) But the Pride of one made him a Devil, the
disobedience of the other made him a cast away, and desperately kill himself,
the Rebellion of the third purchased him a self casual hanging by the hair of
his head, and loud crying murder was repayed to the fourth a (murdresse,) for
she was eaten up by dogs. So that with them the cases or case was strangely
altered.

To take the words of my Title in order as they lie: First THE the words, THE
CASE, does impart the only one main Case, as much as to say, THE CASE of most
concernment and consequence IS ALTERED: for as a Bible is a book, so THE Bible
is the book of books, to which (in comparison) all other books are but
Pamphlets, or as he that calls to his servant to fetch him a Cloak, or his
Cloak may perhaps have more Cloaks then one; but he that calls for THE CLOAK,
it is to be supposed has no more but one. The Athenians were great Idolaters,
and they erected Altars to a great many ungodly gods; but only one Altar had
the Inscription upon it, To THE UNKNOWN GOD: That God was, is, and will be
everlastingly THE GOD, He changes not, nor is ever to have so much as a shadow
of change or alteration, but with all things mortal, The case is altered.

Is, the word says not was (or will be altered) But is in the present Tense,
which denotes unto us the continual attendance of our changing Mutability, The
case was altered with the four Monarchies of the world, from the Assyrians to
the Persians, from the Persians to the Grecians, from the Greeks, to the
Romans, and from the Romans (almost) no whither. This Kingdom of England,
has had its case six times altered: First it was conquered by the Bryttains:
Secondly, by the Romans: Thirdly, by the Saxons: Fourthly by the Danes: Fifthly
by the Normanes, and lastly (for want of a foreign enemy, we have made a
shift to war without a foe) whereby we have most courteously conquered one
another, insomuch that there is scarce any one house, name, family or person,
either of the Royal Party, or the present Army, (or a Party) but may truly
say, the Case is altered.

It is to be noted that all those great men who had any hand in the killing of
Julius Caesar (in hope to destroy Monarchy) did afterward murder themselves,
or die violent, and untimely deaths, the fruits of their attempts were
frustrated, Monarchy was remounted, and their Cases altered.

When Great and Good Families are Metamorphosed into beggars and knaves, and
beggars raised to high preferments and rich fortunes, a man may think (though
he dare not say) that with both these sorts of people, the case is strangely
altered.

It may be imagined that all England is transformed into one entire Bedlam, or
habitation of mad folks, all are not either as they would or should be, no one
is fully contented, and most of them will never be satisfied; they com plain of
want, they grumble at scareity, and (cut of their Lunacie or Frenzy) in this
time of plenty would make us believe every thing is dear, when it is only a
mere fantasy of the brain, a Whirligigge in the mind, e a squinting, or misty
vapor before the eyes, a mere deceptio visus, or delusion of the sight, which
so far stupifies and plunders our wits and senses that we neither feel our
comforts, or see our happiness.

Is it not strange that Wheat should be three shillings the Bushel, and we are
so madly blind that we cannot see it, and foolishly dream that we pay ten or
eleven shillings for it? Coals (very good sea coals) at three pence the Bushel
(at Castela Nova) and we talk idly, that we have lately paid two shillings
four pence the Bushel (with other high prices) but we have eaten Charvill,
which has the virtue and operation to make folks think, that every one thing
they see, is either double, treble, or four times more then it was wont to be.

It is not perceived that so many fast days, and days of Humiliation have
brought down the Price of flesh, more then Hecatombes of Popish Lents or Ember
weeks could have done, all the Vigills (or superstitious Eves) of Saints, the
nice observation of them did formerly raise meat to very high rates, whereas
the suppressing of them has brought such a cheapnesse amongst us, that any one
that will buy the best Beef, (...) may have a stone for ten pence, and all
other things (except Butter and green Geese are as a man may say) dog cheap.

There is a Cook that dwells in long Acre (two or three houses from the Globe
Tavern,) that dreamed he sold a shoulder of Mutton and a Calves head (with no
Bacon) for eighteen Shillings, on Monday the 22 of April last; the Cook
believes and dare swear it true, and I thought it very necessary (for the
honor of our Lords of misrule, and Masters of mischief) to declare to the
world what cheapnesse and plenty we are brought to by Divisions and
Distractions, by which extraordinary happiness, we may believe (as a great many
simpletons do) that the Case of three great Kingdoms is in a manner altered.

But it is beyond the thoughts and Apprehensions of all wise men here, (and
beyond Sea) That true borne English men, Loyal Subjects, and professed
Protestants would ever so far degenerate from their profession of fearing of
God, or their Allegiance toward their Lawful Sovereign (being a Protestant)
as to hunt him up and down, to and fro, to every County of England, to deprive
him of all Earthly comforts, to scandal him with venomous Tongues and pens in
Pulpits, and written, and Printed Libells, and weekly occurrences, and Roguish
Pamphlets: To mock him with a Treaty, and (when Peace was agreed on) to cut His
throat at his own door, to share all His houses, goods, Lands, Jewels, and
whole estate, to dishinherit Root and Branch, all the Royal posterity, to
starve all the Kings Servants, such as did never bear Arms, but attend only
on his person, according to their Oaths and duties. Me thinks it is impossible
for any men to be so Divelish mad to do all these things, (with many more
virtuous actions) but I cannot be so sottishly frantic to believe other wise,
but that we all are in a dream, for it is beyond all belief, or example, that
Christians, English men, Protestants and true Subjects would or could be so
far deprived of Grace, Wisdom, Understanding, Wit, Sense, or common
Capacity, as wilfully headlong to precipitate themselves into such, and so many
Temporal, and Eternal dangers as such horrid designs must necessarily
produce. But these are only mad dreams, as may be fancied, with no more show
of truth amongst honest men (except such as either saw, or feel the miseries
and mischiefs) then it is for a great Earl to degenerate so far as to be a
Knight of a Shire, or a Lord Major to descend lower, then to the office of an
Headborough or Tithingman.

Charity is a most heavenly virtue, her chiefest delight being still to be
doing of good, and in rel^eving the necessities and wants of the needy: true
Charity is never idle, and because she shall not want work, there are fresh and
new beggars made every day, but the Proverb says, Charity should begin at
home; but where her home is, is a very hard and cold enquiry: It is to be
imagined that she is well esteemed, and much made of in the House of Commons at
Westminster, for their weekly Historians and Chronologers of their most
Honorable Acts and Monuments, do week-ly, moderate-ly, and perfect currant-ly,
set forth their abundant love of Charity, for a great part of their Pamphlets
do frequently, devoutly, and palpably declare the care and pains there taken
for the speedy relief of the poor, and the further increase of Beggars for the
Kingdoms honor, the humiliation of the Malignant Party, and the exercise of
Charity.

But suppose there were a dearth, dearnesse and scarcity of food, fuel, and
other things which are the Preservers and maintainers of our Lives, yet there
is a special, provident, speedy way to avoid a sudden famine, to procure a
present plenty.

And it is a wonder, that our State-Pollitians have not long ago put it in
practice, for it would make them to be more honored for so charitable a work,
then for all the good that ever they have done since their first sitting, and
thus it is.

First if they would consider the great number of Malignants, and the many
thousands that are sequestrated: amongst all which innumerable numbers with
their Families, their oppressors have not one friend amongst them all. They
with their Children, Wives, Kinsfolks, Friends and Allies, cannot be fewer then
a million of mouths, and those mouths do eat and feed every day upon such meat
as the Godly Parliament and sanctified Army should have: and seeing they are
deprived of their livelihood, and means of subsistence to live, It is as just
to cut their throats, and take away their lives, and by so doing stop so many
mouths at once from eating: and this is one way to stay abundance of S^o^nacks,
and to bring down the price of victuals suddenly, besides it will raise more
money for the State and Army, by making quick Sale of such small possessions of
Lands and Goods, which as yet all those (whom they are pleased to call
Malignants and Delinquents) do live poorly upon.

Secondly, if they would be pleased to hang all the Whores, and Whore-masters
in the Kingdom; and that a Committee be appointed for that purpose: And
further that the ingenious Harry Martin may be Chaireman to the said Committee.

And also (if they please) they may take all the drunkards, loyterers and idle
vagabonds, and thieves, Sectaries, knaves and Levellers into the bargain.

Thirdly, they may do as the Canniball Brasilians do in America, kill all the
old folks men and women of all degrees, who by reason of their decrepit
impotency, weakness, and encombrances of old age, are but a chargeable pestring
and trouble to the State, and little or no pleasure to themselves; and when
they have killed them, they may eat them as the Canniballs do.

Fourthly, they may hang up all the Beggars, male and female, old and young,
(blind, lame, deaf and dumb) this is a piece of Charity (for it is better to
hang then starve) besides it will be no loss to the State for they can at
their pleasure make Beggars at any time, or at all times more then a good many.

Fifthly, they may play the part of Herod, (not to destroy males of two years
old and under) But to dispatch all the females which are not seven years of
age, for the feminine exceeds the masculine seven to one, and the Girls outvie
the boys more then treble in number, and all those toys do eat and drink
daily, and help to make every thing dear. It may be considered that men have
more ways to die then natural deaths; but (for the most part) women do seldom
die by any casualty of war either by Sea or Land, as men do, for if the women
do fight at any time, it is but a kind of Billingsgate Battle with tongue and
nails, scolding and scratching, and those conflicts are seldom mortal.

Lastly, if they would hang up all the Rebels and Traitors, or all the
Enemies of the late King, it would be much available for the saving of dinners
and suppers; but if they will do none of these things (for the good of the
Commonwealth) then they are humbly desired to hang themselves for the case of
the Kingdom.

FINIS.
