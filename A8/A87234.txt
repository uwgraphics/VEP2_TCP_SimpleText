In Memoriam Thomae Rainsbrough, Pro Populo, and Parliamento, Chiliarchae
Fortissimi.
The Epitaph or Engravement on the Tombstone.
HE that made King, Lords, Commons, Judges shake,
Cities and Committees quake;
He that sought naught but His dear Countries good,
And sealed their Right with His last blood;
RAINSBROUGH, The Just, the Valiant, and True,
Here bids the Noble Levellers Adieu.
The Enlargement upon the Epitaph dedicated to all His Friends; in Parliament;
Army, City, and Country.
SOund sound a Call with speed, beat loud the Drum,
Back from the North brave RAINSBROUGH is come
A butchered martyred Saint, whose gallant Hand
Awed once the Sea, and twice has awed the Land.
Let Justice mourn, and Freedom ring his Knell,
For in their Quarrel, he both fought and fell:
Basely betrayed He fell; ten times through's breast
(Unarmed, unwarn'd) the Coward's sword was thrust.
Dragged from his bed, nor friend, nor weapon nigh him;
Twenty to one, with hacks and thrusts they ply him.
Lend, lend a sword he cries; will none? then I
With naked Arms, the armed dogs defy:
Nor would He yield, till in the street he dies,
With twice ten wounds, the Armies Sacrifice.
Never in Field yet beat; nay whilst that breath
Gave limbs he stood, a Victor at his death:
Up then, brave souls born for your Countries Good:
Mount him to's Grave, and next avenge his Blood.
For though entombed with honor RAINSBROUGH lies,
To you his blood for Satisfaction cries.
Now Cholmly laugh, and ye Malignants grin:
Yet know, from hence your Reckoning must begin.
Anno salutis Christianae 1648. November. 14. Summo cum amore Londinensis
Militiae in humatus fuit honorabiliter Thomas Rainsbrough Justitiae pugil
militaris, libertatis vindex legalis.
