A LETTER FROM A GRAVE GENTLEMAN once a Member of this House of COMMONS, to his
friend, remaining a Member of the same House in LONDON.

CONCERNING HIS REASONS WHY he left the House, and concerning the late Treaty.

Printed in the Year, 1643.

SIR,
I Am extremely glad that in this time of general Distraction and Ruin, (of
which Pragmaticalnesse and want of Charity are both the effect and the cause)
there is yet so much Leizure and kindness left, even in the most busy and most
ill-natured place, to admit a thought of a Person no more considerable, and to
afford a letter to a Malignant and a Cavalier, and that you put me not out
either of your Memory or Your Care, when those you live with put me out of the
House. And truly, if you could, in despite of the Infection of Your Climate,
have as well preserved your Logic as your good Nature, either you might have
brought me to your Opinions, or have left me hopes that I might persuade you
into mine; Whereas now I see no probability of either, your way of arguing
being so different from your own usual rational way, that you seem to me to
have burnt your Aristotle's Organon, and to have learnt a new manner of making
Syllogismes from Mr Gordon and Sergeant Wild. Sir, I assure you, that though
you have there inflicted a Punishment upon me, which in the beginning of the
Parliament would have broke my Heart, and that for no other cause (for ought
appeared to you) then for having business at York, when you had banished the
King from London, yet I am more troubled with the decay of Reputation which
both Houses suffer by such unreasonable and unjust Votes, then for my own
Concern in their unreasonablenes and Injustice, being sufficiently comforted
against my share in them, by the Company you have given me, having expelled
whole Sholes (sometimes twenty in a morning) of Gentlemen, first chosen and
still esteemed by their Countries, for continuing in, and demeaning themselves
according to the same Principles, by which they had obtained that Choice and
Estimation.

1. You know Sir, you and I were, both at once, both committed about the
Loanes, and put out of the Commission of the Peace for opposing Shipmony, and
how sensible We after found the Parliament of all men's sufferings in that kind,
and for those causes. And did either of us then think to have lived to have
seen any so much as discountenanced by both Houses of Parliament for refusing a
loan, though it were called a Contribution, or opposing an Ordinance as
illegal as that Writ, grounded upon a Necessity as hard to be discovered as
that which was then pretended? How often have you told me (when you have heard
the Courtiers argue that without such a Power in the Crown, no Parliament
sitting, the Kingdom might be unavoydably destroyed) that with* or without that
Power We should be liable to mighty dangers, but the Wisdom of the Law had
avoided those most that were likely to come oftnest; That now besides, the
Question was not what was best to be Law, but what was Law; That Arguments from
Convenience are good considerations in framing of Laws or founding of States,
but that the State being framed it was most ridiculous and dangerous to retire
from the Law to a disputable convenience or Necessity, and put our selves back
again into the same Maze of Debates and Questions, which Laws were framed to
be rules to us to deliver us from; And yet then, Sir, We might have known this
present fundamental (and indeed only Law now left) of nature and Necessity,
And Salus Populisuprema* Lex* was a sentence that was no stranger to Us, and
these are sure better Pretenses for one Estate, when the other two are not in
being, then for two Estates in the presence and in the despite of the Third.

2. You and I, Sir, were both of that Parliament in which my Lord of Bristolls
dispute with my Lord Duke of Buckingham, and our dislike of my Lord Duke got my
Lord of Bristoll all those that dislikt the other, to labor to assist and
protect him, and you know how studious most men were in that work, when my Lord
of Bristoll was accused of Treason by the Kings Attorney in the Lords House,
and yet the accusation stood received till the end of the Parliament. And could
We ever have then believed, that an Accusation in the same manner, by the same
Officer, in the same Court, before almost all the very same men (no difference
in the case but between Bristoll and Kimbolton) should be voted a high breach
of Privilege, should be a Reason to censure the Attorney, and the maine and
most sufficient Pretense for most necessary and defensive Arms, at least for a
horrid Rebellion under that Title?

3. You and I were both of that Parliament in which my Lord of Arundell being
Committed, you know how both Houses labored his Discharge. You know how tender
we were then of Our Privileges, and how much more likely to claim a
Privilege that we had not, then to quit a Privilege we had, and how many
able, honest, judicious Lawyers we had of the House, that would not have
suffered us to have overseen Our Right. And when in that Parliament a Petition
framed by both Houses did admit their Privilege of Parliament not to extend to
Cases either of Treason, Felony, or refusing to give sureties for the Peace,
could we ever have thought to see it claimed as a Privilege, that no member be
restrained without order of the House, though in case of Treason to be
immediately acted upon the Kings Person? And could we ever have thought to have
seen the People, engaged by Order of the House of Commons alone, and under
Pretense of an uncommanded Protestation, to have assisted all such as should be
so restrained, in despite of this Declaration of both Houses, and in
Opposition to the known Laws of the Land?

4. You and I Sir have been of many other Parliaments, and when we saw so many
Bills offered, and some passed, and others laid by, sometime with Our sorrow,
but never with our complaint, when we all acknowledged, with the old* Act of
Parliament, that is was of the Kings Regality to grant or deny them, and no one
of us so much as whispered to any friend, that the King had done illegally in
doing so, or broke the Oath taken at His Coronation, because of the Clause,
Quas vulgus Elegerit, could we ever have thought then to have seen the whole
frame of Monarchy destroyed, by seeing the Kings Negative voice denied Him, and
He called by consequence a perjured man, for not consenting to any public
Bill from both Houses, though it were to depose Himself?

5. When in those Parliaments We saw so little prevalency in the Puritan party,
that they were never able to pass a Bill, even in the House of Commons, for
such an ease of weak consciences in the point of indifferent Ceremonies, as I
always wished them, and as the King has now often professed Himself ready to
join in, (which Profession would sure have been more readily entertained, if
they had not feared, that this would have been so full a satisfaction to so
many, that their side would have been much weakened by it) could we then ever
think to have lived to see the Common Prayer Book totally neglected, and
publicly affronted, and those neglects and affronts not only connived at,
but as publicly countenanced and encouraged by that honorable Assembly, and
to see a Bill passed both Houses, for the total extirpation of Bishops, Root
and Branch, and this Bill offered to His Majesty among Propositions for Peace?

6. In those Parliaments though some of us often expressed our dislike of some
illegal Clauses, in the Commissions given to, and executed by Lords and
Deputy. Lievtenants, yet did we ever hear, or look to hear of the least
pretense, that the Militia of this Kingdom was either not under the Kings
Command, or under any Command but His? And did both Houses so much as suspect
themselves upon any pretense, or in any time, to have any Right to order and
dispose of it?

7. In those Parliaments though we have often humbly represented to His Majesty
some things, wherein we supposed there was some failour in His Ministers in
those particulars which we then all confessed the Law had solely trusted to Him,
as of Ships not set out, or Forts ill guarded, or the like; yet did we ever
think it possible both Houses should ever pretend to such a supervisorship
over that Trust, that whenever they would say He did not discharge it as He
ought, they might legally lay hold on it themselves, and having seized His
Ships, Forts, Magazines, etc. take up Arms to maintain what they had done,
and to keep this their Trust Paramount in perpetual execution?

8. In those Parliaments did we ever see the same things several times pressed
to the Lords House by the House of Commons (after they had been upon mature
advice rejected by them) as if they had meant to say, Deny it if you dare; and
at last past there with the Peoples help, either a thin House being watched
for, or some of the Lords out of anger, and some out of* fear absenting
themselves?

9. In all those Parliaments did we ever see any Declarations of both Houses
against the King, or of one House against the other, Printed and published to
the people, calling them to their assistance, and laying before them their
destruction if they assisted not?

10. In all those Parliaments, did we ever see when any thing had been proposed
to, and rejected by the House of Lords, the House of Commons notwithstanding
proceed in it, and express their minds of it to the people, as in the point
of the Bill for the Protestation, or when the House of Lords had published an
Order for the established Law, as they did now upon the ninth of September, did
we ever see the House of Commons oppose them and the Law together, and disgrace
the one, and endeavor to suppress the other, as they did now by a Printed
Order to the contrary, of the same Date?

11. Did we ever see the House of Commons in all those Parliaments so invade
the Privilege of the House of Lords, as first to question particular Members
for words spoken in that House (as my Lord Duke and my Lord Digby) and next to
question the whole House by bringing up and countenancing a mutinous and
seditious Petition, which demanded the names of those Lords, who consented not
with the House of Commons in those things which that House (that is the Major
part of it) had twice denied, and joining with them in that Demand?

12. Did We ever see Petitions brought by armed Mechanics countenanced by the
House of Commons, the Assaults made by them upon their own Members, though
complained of, not enquired into, and these multitudes termed their Friends by
the principal Governors, the House of Lords refused to be joined with in
their modest desire, only of a Declaration against the like for the future,
the guard against the like placed by virtue of a Writ, issued by command of the
Lords House, discharged, the Justice of Peace that placed them committed, and
the ordinary legal Inquisition upon Riots stopped and hindered by an order of the
House of Commons alone?

Sir, some of these things having been done in former Parliaments so contrary
to what is now done, and so many things now done, which were never attempted in
(and if they had been thought of would have been condemned by) those former
Parliaments; you must pardon me if I think that charge of Apostasy (which
under other men's names you your self lay upon me) to be very injurious, and I
appeal to any man that shall consider and examine my Action and these
particulars, whether I left the Houses till they left the Law, and whether to
quit the place and retain the principles, or to quit the principles, and be
only constant to the place, be the greater and the truer Apostasy.

The next Objection you make is this, That whereas We here pretend to stand
for Law, yet it is only for such a Law, of which we Our selves will only be
Judges, refusing to stand to the Judgment of the supreme Iudicatory of the
Kingdom, both Houses of Parliament. And truly Sir, if this objection were made
by a stranger only made acquainted with the general Scheme of the Constitution
of the Kingdom, and neither with the particular Laws, nor the particular
Occurrences, I should not wonder; but from one who has been a constant Member
of the Parliament, I wonder to receive it. First, Sir, I appeal to you, whether
you do not believe, that suppose, (which were hardly possible to be supposed)
that both Houses (in the fullest and freest condition of Parliament that is
imaginable) should declare, that by the Law of the Land, The Kings Crown and
the Subjects Property and Liberty were to be disposed of by them, and should
take up Arms to make this good for Law, and declare that by Law all the
Subjects of the Land were obliged to assist their Arms thus taken up; Suppose
this, I say; Do you not believe, that their being the Supreme Iudicatory could
not satisfy Our consciences (who have taken the Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy) in a Judgment as contrary to those Oaths and the known Law, as it
is known that by the Law both Houses have Power to judge in any other Cases,
or that there are at all two Houses of Parliament? And sure this is now (as to
what is done, though not as to their condition who do it) either the Case, or
very near it. Indeed, Sir, till the Parliament was made perpetual, such a
Case was absolutely unimaginable, for being a dissoluble Body, kept them from
invading the known Rights either of King or Subjects, of neither of which they
need now to have the same apprehension, having strengthened themselves by a Bill
against the one, and by an Army against the other.

But, Sir, I cannot allow you so much, The Houses now are neither full nor
free; Really the Major part of the Commons, and evidently the Major part of the
Lords, do not, cannot, dare not come to you. How much you were wont to mislike
Tumults, appears to me by your former bitterness against them, when they came
down to press even those things, for the passing of which you had been very
earnest in the House, and you may remember you apprehended them so much, that I
had much ado, during the time they lasted, to persuade you to venture your
self any nearer to Westminster, then your Chamber in Fleet Street, and that
you answered me, when I told you that you needed not fear, for those People
took you for their Friend, that a Brickbat was an ill distinguisher of
friends, and that you saw enough of those Gentlemen out of your Window as they
past along the streets, to make you not desire to keep them company without a
Wall between you. Sir, if a few within, shall have power to draw a multitude
from without, to awe the rest, and make them either retire, or judge as they
please, and then judge so (as in the point of the Militia, Hull, and taking up
of Arms) as with safety of Conscience no man can rest in their Judgments, nor
with safety of Purse and Liberty oppose them, and shall keep themselves still
by this means the Major part to judge on as they have begun, and yet may still
retain the Authority of the Supreme Iudicatory, then really, Sir, it must of
necessity follow, That the Subjects will still be in the power of the seditious
and factious, and it is not the men but the Walls that make the two Houses of
Parliament. No, Sir, it is you, who refuse to secure the Parliament from
Tumults where it is, or to remove it thither where it may be secure, that
refuse to have it tried what is Law by the Supreme Iudicatory of the Kingdom,
all you say now is but the same, as if the Lord Chief Justice of the Kings
Bench, out of Parliament time, should by force drive away his Brethren of the
same Bench, and then Judge there, that none of those other Judges were more
then His mere Assistants in that Court, and then find fault with them for not
submitting to that Judgment as made and delivered by the highest Court of
Justice.

But, Sir, foreseeing this Objection of the Tumults would come strongly upon
you, you prepare the Ward for that Blow, and tell me that though some disorders
indeed there were, yet this was but the pretense of Our absence, for the
Tumults did precede Our absenting Our selves by many weeks, in which time We
came often to the House, and securely opposed the sense thereof. The disorders,
Sir, you speak of were such, and did so awe the Members, that you know some
discourse, in order to doing of that which this put really in execution, was
voted Treason by Our House, but the same awing of the Parliament, when it is
done by the well-affected, and countenanced by the worthy Members, and the good
Lords is, it seems, but disorder, and no Treason: These Tumults first caused
Our infrequent meeting at the House, who differed from their Opinions that had
such Satellites abroad, and this Infrequency gave leave to the rest to command
such things as our Consciences would not allow us to obey. If We took not up
Arms in obedience to your Ordinance of the Militia; If We would not live and
dye with my Lord of Essex etc. you would punish and imprison us; If We did, the
known Law, agreeing with His Majesty's Proclamation, told us, We were Traitors,
and the Protestation We had taken to defend the Kings just Rights, told us, We
were forsworn; If We joined together to over-vote you in it (for as long as We
came and opposed you not, or opposed you and carried it not against you, or
carried only that which was not much material, I confess we were safe enough)
the precedent Tumults had sufficiently told us, That they would beat out our
Brains; So what was left for us to do, but to be gone? And yet We could not
go till We could go somewhether, and therefore were to bear our Condition as
well as We could, till His Majesty were in Posture to give us that Protection
which He ought us by the Law. And this was the true Cause both why We went, and
why no sooner.

But your next Objection is of all other the most unreasonable, That you have
discovered by this Treaty, That the King is averse to Peace. And in the name of
God, whereupon is this discovery founded? It is well known that in all
several Conditions, the King has equally pressed for Peace, and the Rulers of
the House of Commons have equally opposed it; And probably they would have gone
further, and used their old Arts to have stopped the consent to this Treaty by
violence too, if they had not looked upon their appearing so to break it, when
so many desired it, as too great a burden of Envy, and known their Interest
to be enough to be able to break it before it could be concluded, with less
disgust then at that time, as being easier to persuade the people, that any
individual Peace was not good for them, then that no Peace at all was, which a
Total rejection of all Treaty did clearly imply. And did they not (when the
sense of their misery had given their followers Courage to overvote them in
this) clogge the Treaty as much as possibly they could; First, with a
Resolution that their Committee should Treat only with His Majesty, (which He
might well, and so they hoped He would refuse) then with such Limitation of
Articles to two, and of days to four, and of Instructions to hardly any, That
they might have sent down their Papers by Edgerley the Carrier to His Majesty,
and he might as easily have concluded a Peace with Him, as with so bounded and
untrusted a Committee? But in the Treaty what did the King ask or deny that
showed so little desire of Peace* If He had asked together with His Ships,
Forts, and Castles, the Lives of those who took them from Him, (which if He
had, He had asked no more then belongs to Him by Law, as the proper Security
that the like violence should be offered Him no more) and if He had required an
end of the whole Treaty before He disbanded, (which is yet the usual course of
Treaties) you might have had some Color for what you object; But now the whole
Objection is this, His Majesty's own Ships, Forts, Magazines, etc. were by
violence, and that of Subjects, taken from Him, and this unreasonable,
unpeaceable, blood-thirsty Prince desires to have them again. An excellent
Argument of Aversion to Peace. When the Cessation was in Debate, the King
demanding the Approbation of the Commanders of the Ships, It was replied, That
this Demand was to desire the strength of one party to the other before the
difference were ended; and upon this Reason the King receded from that
Condition, never expecting that they would so soon have forgotten their own
Logic, and have demanded, That when Differences were ended, this Approbation,
that is this strength should for three years continue in them. And sure the
King is in a miserable Condition, if neither a Cessation nor a Treaty be a fit
time or means for Him to recover his Own. But say you the Fears and
Iealousies of the People must be satisfied. Say I, the People must be
satisfied, That there was Cause of Fears and Iealousies. And one Cause of
their Demand is, That these things would appear to have been taken without
Reason, if they were restored without Conditions. But this may be an Argument
to them to ask it, I am sure it can be none to the King to grant, for then by
the contrary Argument the King is necessitated to insist that they be restored
without Limitations or Conditions, because He can never confess that they were
taken from Him with any Reason or Color.

Sir, though you have great Abundance of Fears and Iealousies, yet you have
not hoorded them so up, but you have given some to the King, certainly if when
these things were in his Hands they were wrested by you from Him, you may do
it with much greater case, if you have more then half the Hold (as you
confess in the Point of the Ships, that the allowing of Approbation of the
Commanders gives up the strength.) And nothing can be more ridiculous then for
you to pretend to fear Him when He shall have those, whom you did not fear
when He had them. Certainly if you had apprehended this Power as you pretend,
you would never when he was vested in it have offered Him such injuries, and
denied Him such Rights, as you never offered or denied to His Predecessors, at
least you would have thought that Power if not able to punish you, yet able to
defend it self, and you would never have attempted so hard a work as to take
it from Him. This, Sir, is the truth, and that most visibly; These Powers are
so far from enabling Him to oppress you, That the least Color of such an
intention after a Peace would be the same as delivering them up to you again;
They were your Leavies that made His; It was you that raised Him an Army when
you gave Him the Law of His side, and He will not be able to raise another if
He have once disbanded this, till you give Him again the same Advantage, and
you will be able to oppress Him if He shall give it you. For to fear that He
shall conquer England with three or four small Garrisons, when those who now
assist Him (that is almost all the Gentry of England) must look upon Him as the
most perjurd man alive, and upon themselves as dispenc't with by Him from any
Obedience or Loyalty to Him, is so hypocondriacall a fancy, that it is either
to be mad, or to resolve that He is so. Nothing else can so puff Him up with
some Ships, and a few Forts (which without money to Man and pay them, are but
so many Hulkes, and but bare walls) as not rather to be inclined to comply in
any reasonable thing with the only Legal Root and spring of Money, the House of
Commons, that He may live in Glory and Peace, then without Money to hope to
begin and conquer in an unjust War, Who has found it so difficult to defend
Himself in so visibly a just one. There is yet another reasonable Fear and
Iealousy for the King to apprehend, The Nineteen Propositions (in which there
was presented to Him a perfect Platform of a total change of Government, by
which the Counselors were to have been Kings, and the King to have become
scarce a Counselor, and nothing of the present State to have remained, but
Eadem Magistratuum vocabula) cannot easily get out of the Kings Head, or
appear to Him not to be still in theirs, who were the framers and Contrivers.
And He has great cause to be very wary after such an instance of some men's
ends and designs (this Parliament being by Law perpetual, and a Trienniall
one being however to be) not to give any Ground to any such Power in both
Houses as may make this submitting of His known Rights, in the choice of these
particulars, to their Approbation, a ground to continue these, and draw on more
of the same kind, and to divide at least that Dependence with them which the
Law (for excellent and necessary Reasons) meant only to the Crown; If Fears
and Iealousies be so rewarded, I doubt I shall see new ones at the Three years
end, that this share in conferring of Places of Power and trust may be rather
increased then lost. And there could not be a greater justification and
fortification of this Iealousy, then to see a new Book printed by order of a
Committee of the House of Commons with a Members ( John White's) hand to it,
whole Title is, The Sovereign Power of Parliaments and Kingdoms, asserting the
Parliament and Kingdoms Right and Interest in, and power over not only the
Militia, Ports, Forts, and Ammunition of the Realm, but likewise to make
choice of the Keeper, Treasurer* Privy-Seale, Privy-Councellors, Judges and
Sheriffs of the Kingdom, and denying the Kings negative Voice to such public
Bills as both Houses deem necessary and just; And if all this belong to both
Houses, I wonder what is left to belong to the King, but to give Warrants for
Bucks, without consent of Parliament.

But say you, If the King would have named persons to them, He should have seen
how moderate you would have been in your Exceptions. Truly, Sir, what you would
have been perhaps neither of us know, but by your refusing to make the Law your
Rule, it seems you intended to give a very arbitrary Approbation. And though
you now say (as we always hear much of the moderation intended by you,
whenever a Treaty is either broken or diverted) that you would have excepted
against none but impeach't persons, yet I am sure in the Bill for the Militia,
the King offering you the same Persons, whom within a few Weeks before you had
offered Him for the same employments, you yet excepted against four, my Lord
Marquis of Hertford, my Lord of Cumberland, my Lord of Derby, and my Lord of
Lincoln, because in the Interim they did not accept of a Command over the
Militia without the Kings consent, (who could only Legally give it them) and
yet since, the last (having so much submitted his Conscience to Power, that
from being unsatisfied with raising Arms, without the King, He is come to make
no scruple of bearing Arms against Him) is now again so fully confided in by
you, that Respect to the King, and Reverence to the Law appear to be the
Qualities you cannot confide in, and the King after such an instance has great
Reason to be wary, how He either approve of your confiding, or confide in your
Approbation. And if they really meant, only to except against impeacht
Persons, why did they not say so much in the Treaty, to have made the breach of
the Treaty, on their side, somewhat more popular? And since to direct their
Exceptions they knew who were Legally vested in those Places, (for the King
only named those whom the Law had named first) Why did they not except at such
of them as were impeach't, and give that as a Reason, or make some other (at
least colorable) exception against them, which upon debate and mutual
reasoning might have produced either their satisfaction or the Kings, unless
an agreement were not that effect of their Treaty, which they aimed at most.
Truly I am very confident the King knew not (and I am the more confident of it,
because I am certain, I knew nothing of it my self) that any Persons now in
those Commands had ever been impeacht, and then sure the King had no Reason to
take it so far for granted, that any deserved to be excepted at against whom
He knew no exceptions Himself, as without a present Charge to dispossess them
of those Commands to which they had a present Right. And God forbid, Sir, That
a mere Charge not proved, nor yet answered to, should dispossess men of their
Rights, especially in a time in which a Charge comes so easily, that men are
voted Traitors for assisting the King against a Rebellion against Him. You
instance only (...) men Will: L^gg, and Mr G^ring. And for the first, I pray,
what is he charged with, only for being employed by the King as a mere
messenger in the delivery of a Petition, which having been Printed ever since
the twelfth of August, I could never yet hear either publicly or privately
any objection made against it, and which I am sure must appear very just,
humble, and modest, even to the most passionate, if they compare it to the
Petition of Hertfordshire, or to that of the Thousands of poor People about
London, or to diver^ others which received the Countenance of one House, and
Thanks from both. And sure if the Crime had been so great as you would now
intimate, you would never for so long a time have suffered him to have gone
whether he pleased upon Bail. For the second Person I am not enough of his
Acquaintance to be able to answer for him* but certainly you can lay nothing
but Loyalty to his Change, since to the very Minute of his declaring for the
King, when Arms were raised against His Majesty, you confided so much in him,
that I am credibly informed you meant to have made him (Lieutenant General of
your whole Army, and I am sure when I left London, he was esteemed by you an
excellent Patriot, one who had saved the Kingdom from a greater then the
Gunpowder Treason, and was the very Darling and Favorite of the Commonwealth.

This is, Sir, the true state of the case, after that the House of Lords
(whereof the major part by above twenty, there being then hardly any Bishop in
Town uncommitted, and not one Popish Lord left in Town, had twice refused to
join in asking the Militia, Forts, Ports, etc. of the King) were forced by the
threatening Petitioners, and the Countenance given to them by the House of
Commons, to join with them perforce in their fears and jealousies, and in
that Demand which was grounded upon them, and after that in an humble
pursuance of these desires, these things (with the Magazines and Ships to
boot) are forced from His Majesty, (whom and His Ancestors the Law had as
irrevocably vested in them, as it has any man in England in his House, Goods,
or Land) it is thought an Aversion to Peace in the King, that He will not by
now assenting condemn Himself as guilty of this War, for not having rather
at first then now assented to these Desires, which were their ground of it;
That He will not by this Assent condemn the Lords House for not having sooner
discovered the Causes of fears and Iealousies, (which occasioned, and, as they
say, did necessitate the continuance of those Desires) till their Eyes were
opened by the Threats and Tumults of the People; That He will not justify
these forcible proceedings against Himself in taking these things from Him, by
submitting to any Conditions or Limitations whatsoever to recover them again,
but does pertinaciously insist to have His own restored to Him, and thinks to
put them off with Justice, and with the Law of the Land. For though the Militia
were not named either in the Proposition of both Houses, or in the Kings, yet
even that too is hooked in in their Limitations in such a manner as the People
may not see it, and not only they deliver not what is the Kings to Him, but, as
it were demand satisfaction from Him for having taken it, and not only (without
any regard to the Right of the Persons legally vested, or offering any legal
or colorable Exception against them) require still that such be named in those
Places as they may confide in, (though We may take a measure by what Rule they
will confide, by the Precedents I quoted before) and not only they require this
for once at first, but if any dye within three years they must confide again,
and indeed that is a fair time taken to be sure by that time to have more
fears and Iealousies ready made to keep up the perpetuity, and to extend the
Power of confiding; But yet farther these Officers and the Admiral and others
must take an Oath to suppress all Forces that shall be raised, during that
time, without the consent of both Houses* so that by this, His Majesty, even in
Case this Parliament should end sooner (if perhaps they have not resolved it
shall not, and have prepared this as a Reason why it should not) and in case
never so great a Rebellion should rise, or never so terrible an invasion should
come in upon us, must neither increase his Garrisons, nor raise other Forces to
resist them, unless a Parliament both be, and be willing to afford Him their
Consent, and His Majesty having sworn to protect His Subjects must quit the
old legal way of doing it Himself* and (at best) be obliged to call upon
others to help Him not to be foresworne. Truly, Sir, unless like one that has
been so long in the dark, that he takes a Rush Candle for the Sun, you have
now so long kept unreasonable Company* that you think any thing on this side
the Ninteen Propositions to be reasonable, you would never approve a demand
which does thus slyly and by the by divest the King of that sole Power over the
Militia (and that for a year longer then your own Bill asked it) which was the
first and chiefest Dispute between the King and the Commons, (for the Lords had
had no Iealousies, if they had had no Fears) and which is so principal a
Prerogative of the Crown, as without it He will hold the Crown it self by no
better a Tenure, then durante been placito. Nor could you expect that He should
grant you that (together with such other things) having an Army at Oxford,
which alone and naked He refused at Hampton Court and Windsor. What else do
you except at in the Treaty? Why say you the King pretends to ask nothing but
what is Law, why does He require us to adjourne from London? Sir, He never
required it. He required a security from Tumults and violence for Himself and
both Houses, and this sure is due to Him by the Law; the other course He only
proposed, as that which in his Opinion could only effect it, and truly if the
minds of the Rabble of London be not much altered since I left it, I must be
much of his mind.

But say you, The King was ever offered that; He was indeed, Sir, but at the
same time they defended, that there had been no Tumults, so that the King could
not receive so much of Security from their Offer, as the Tumults must needs
receive of encouragement from their Defense, the sense of what they said put
together being only this, That they would secure Him and us from any thing
which they would confess to be a Tumult. But for my part if I be constrained
and in danger, it is not enough for me that you vote me free and safe; Call
them Tumults or not, as you please, if there be that which looks as like
Tumults as the last did, I shall be, though perhaps in more safety, yet in no
more security then at Edgehill.

But say you, what an ungrateful thing were it of the Parliament to desert
that City from which they have received so large Assistance? Truly, Sir, the
Country (God forgive it) has contributed not a little to your Assistance too,
and ought to have some part of your Care, and for the City it self (besides
that Allegiance is a duty as well as Gratitude, and a precedent Bond to this)
in my Opinion even for their sake you ought to consent to this advice* Do you
think That City will be able to bear that burden of Envy which must fall
upon them from all the rest of the Nation, if they see you for this
consideration expose them to all the miseries of War, rather then remove
twenty miles from thence, though the King allow you your own Choice of a place
out of all the whole Kingdom besides? Nay, do you think, that if the Armies
were disbanded, the Peace again begun, and the whole Parliament now met at
St Albans, that the City would not find both their charge much diminisht, and
their Trade and gettings much increased, and a miraculous change of their
condition to the better? Nor can any inconvenience come by it, unless you
think Freedom not only not essential to, but not consistent with such
meetings, and unless it be your opinion, that no Tumults, no Parliament.

But say you, suppose the King in Justice might ask and refuse all He does;
Were it not yet prudent for the King rather to consent to part with some of His
Right then to venture all the rest; And were it Justifiable in Him to destroy
His Kingdom and so many Innocents, by not ending the War when now He may?
Sir, I am confident since you are able to say nothing against it (or if you
are, why do you not?) you would as well have granted as have supposed this, if
you had not feared Sr Robert Pyes fortune, That your Letter might have been read
at the close Committee; and till you give me Reasons why you cannot grant it, I
must assume it as if you did. And then truly, I must tell you, that this
Logic will in all times render the wise and the welnatured a Prey to the
unreasonable and the furious, and that as there are some outward medicines for
the Stone and the Gout, which only stupifying and not removing the Cause give
only a little ease for the present, but make the fits both more frequent and
more fierce; so the accepting of such Conditions might ease us for the present
of this Rebellion, but (when it were seen that to seize and usurp all the Kings
Rights, and peremptorily to resolve rather to destroy the Kingdom then to give
them up again, were the way to persuade Him to relinquish a good part of them)
it may so far encourage future Rebellions, that We may doubt they would be
hereafter as Trienniall as Parliaments, till the King by this Logic and
little by little, have given so much to appease them, that nothing will be left
Him either to give or to keep, and out of His Care of His People He have made
them none of His, and have engaged them besides into the miseries of many
Wars, by paying so dearly for the end of this.

But, Sir, I pray turn your Argument on the other side. Both Houses have not
Kingdoms of their own to see destroyed by the War, but they have Rights as
Houses, and Estates as Persons* which being their all, is to be prudentially of
the same Concern to them; And suppose the King did ask them to part with some
of their Rights or Estates, were it prudent or justifiable in them by the same
reason to venture all their Rights, rather then part with some, and to destroy
their fortunes, the Kingdom and so many Innocents by not ending the War when
they might? But Alas! how much more imprudent and unjustifiable is it in them,
to venture all and destroy the Kingdom, and so many Innocents, by continuing
this War* rather then to grant to the King what is justly and notoriously His
own, or forbear to insist, that He should grant that to them, which you do not
so much as pretend in Justice to belong to them? And do you think whether the
People will not be excellently satisfied, and who^ they will adhere unto in it,
when they see the cause of the Continuance of this miserable War thus
shortly, truly, and clearly stated and laid open? Can you, Sir, pretend any
longer to be thought one of the moderate, (by any other title then by living
among those who are somewhat madder then your self) if you can believe that
the requiring much that is neither reasonable, nor theirs, argue Inclination to
Peace in both Houses, and the Kings asking but somewhat that is reasonable and
his own, show an Aversion to it in His Majesty, and if you continue to blame
the King for not granting what you only suppose it Prudence to grant, and
continue to join with, and assist those against your Allegiance, and against
Him, who insist upon that, which the same Rule of Prudence does oblige them not
to insist upon, and the Rule of Justice obliged them not to have asked;
Especially since, If your Assistance, and that of such as you are, did not give
them their strength, there were then no Color of any Argument left so much as
from Prudence, to persuade the King to grant what they now ask Him, and Peace
it self is not more desirable, then the Conditions of it would be reasonable,
which would then be had from them.

But Fears and jealousies keep you still on that side. And to this I can only
answer; First, that of the King there is no ground of Fears and Iealousies, If
there be, they must be both of His Will and of His Power, and I can see no
pretense for either. Here have been during His Government many and great
Illegalities suffered and committed by His Ministers. But was He ever bred in
any of the Innes of Court, and then is it reasonable to lay the fault of that
to His Charge, which as He often knew not to be done at all, So He never knew
to be illegally done? Did He not ever leave the trial to the laws? Did He
ever Solicit or threaten any Judge to say that was Law which was not? Did He
ever offer to protect any from this Parliament, that had either offended
against Law, or Judged amiss of Law, though in the Cases most to His own
advantage? And has he not given all possible Personal Satisfaction for other
men's faults, both by public acknowledgements (a thing unusual for Princes to
descend to) of things past, by extraordinary Provisions for the future, by the
Punishment of His nearest and most trusted Setvants in no ordinary way, by
quitting many Rights pretended to by His Ancestors, and many more confessed to be
Legally in Him, by frequent and Solemn Protestations and Execrations (which
are much strengthened by the Person of the Protestor, known to be neither
revengefull, nor guilty of any of those Crimes, or liable to any of those
temptations, which most usually engage men into breach of so public a faith)
And lastly (which should most work with them who are most wrought upon by
that) Is it not evident that His Interest joins with His Conscience in the
requiring this observance from Him, and that for Him to break what the promises
to His whole Kingdom, and in the observance of which the whole Kingdom is
concerned, were the way to turn the Cavaliers into Roundheads, and the same
thing as for Him to mediate a League between His Friends and His Enemies
against Himself? The King, Sir, has had great Experience by what means the
Court lost their Interest in the People, and (by the Advantage that has been
since made out of it upon Him) of what Consequence that Interest is, and He is
more to be trusted that He will never hazard the like loss by the same way,
then any new Prince in whose time there had been no misgovernments and
misfortunes. He cannot but know that a Kingdom is like a Torch, which having
been once on Fire, though after put out, will take Fire again much more
easily, then another which was never kindled.

Secondly, I answer, That the King has reason to have Fears and Iealousies,
not only in Case He accepted of their Propositions, but although His own
Propositions were granted to Him, if His care of His People did not prevail
with Him above them. For both the Will and the Power of others does
sufficiently appear, by what has been already attempted and effected both by
them and against Him. And when His Army is once disbanded with no fuller
satisfaction in their Pay (and perhaps with much less to some of their Hopes)
then He is able to give them, He will be so much more unlikely to be able to
raise another, if a Necessity of it should come again; and the zeal of their
Army of Separatists is so well known, and in how short warning upon the least
sign they would flock together again; And how much they are the more
Plotting, more united, more industrious, and more violent Party of the Houses
and of the Kingdom, and what influence Arts, union, Industry and violence have
upon the People to mislead, carry away or bear down the divided and the
indifferent, that is the Major part of the rest, is so well known too, that
whether by beginning a new war if they see Cause, or by awing the Parliament
again, (for they will be ready to travail farther then twenty miles in so good
an errand) or by perpetual Diligence in the House observing and complying with
the Interests and affections of the Members to gain them over, or in watching
when the House is emptiest and fittest for their Turn, or by any other Art
that can conduce to their ends with the People, first to seduce, and then to
inflame them, they are likely to have no small advantage of His Majesty, and
are most unlikely not to improve to the uttermost any Advantage they shall have.

Thirdly, I answer, That the Kingdom has as much Cause as the King to have
Fears and Iealousies of the same Persons; And that in those points which are
most dear and most important to them. Does Alteration of the Religion
established deserve a Iealousy? What Printing, Preaching and violence do we
daily hear and see against the Government and Liturgy of this famous
Protestant Church? Do they not avowedly fight to take it away? What swarms of
Lay Tub-Preachers, what strange unheard of Innovations daily arise among us?
Nor are those Innovations only about words or Actions in themselves
indifferent, (as calling a Table an Altar, a Minister a Priest, or receiving
the Communion rather at the window, then in the middle of the Chancell,
Innovations, which yet you know, Sir, I never approved) nor yet about opinions
merely speculative, (as some of those are which have formerly troubled
Parliaments) but in such opinions as disorder all Government and dissolve
civil society in order to setting up Jesus Christ in a Throne, in which no
History can tell us that ever he sat yet, throughout any one Province, or in
any one Parish. And all this I will not say how unpunisht, but how
countenanc't, and by whom, but by those men, who make use of Your Authority to
produce none of your ends.

Does the danger, or rather the destruction of the Property and Liberty of the
Subject deserve a Iealousy? Is not all they have or as much as is thought fit,
taken from them by Orders of both Houses, who have no more right to that power
then a Grand Jury? Are not men committed in an arbitrary way, no cause expressed
nor Legal cause known, by both Houses, and then in despite of all Habeas
Corpusses retayn'd? Nay, Are not they ordinarily committed by the House of
Commons alone, which till of late, never pretended to any right of committing
any Body but the Members of their own House, or such out of it as had broken
some Privilege of theirs? Nay, is not the public Liberty given up into the
Hands of Committees and strangers delegated by them, and all this done by the
Power of these men?

Does the Alteration of the Civil State, and of the very frame and
Constitution of Parliaments deserve a Iealousy? Have not the Arts, Industry and
violence of those Men, and of their Party so wrought and framed both Houses, as
to prevail with them to oppose and usurp all the Rights and Power of the
King? Have not they since with great Justice to the Lords House, prevailed with
the House of Commons (with the help of the Common People, and Common Council)
as wholly to swallow up the Lords Power, as their Lordships former concurrence
had enabled them to devour the Kings? And have they not again squees'd that
Power into a close Committee, and thence again into a sub-Committee yet closer
then that, that is in to themselves? And by their sole Orders, and to their
sole ends is not this whole Commonwealth upon the matter wholly governed and
disposed? Do they not not only justify all this to be Law in time of War,
(though indeed they only offer such Reasons for it, as will as well justify any
unpaid Soldier in their Army to Plunder Legally, according to the same
fundamental Laws of Nature and Necessity) but even as to the unjustifiable
Illegal Votes and Actions published and committed before the War, do they
either make any acknowledgement or Retractation of, or give any satisfaction
for what is past, or offer any such security against the like for the future,
as the King has done for those things for which the Iealousies are still
pretended to continue against Him? And therefore if you be jealous still of the
King, and they having done all this, and in this manner, you are
notwithstanding not jealous that they will continue the same things as long as
they continue in the same Power, I cannot but wonder to see you so jealous on
the one side, and so secure on the other, unless perhaps what I imply they
will do be a thing so evident to you, that you count it the object rather of
foresight, then of Iealousy.

Fourthly I answer, That supposing you had no grounds to be jealous of them,
and had grounds to be jealous of His Majesty, yet this were no sufficient
excuse for the Countenance you give by your Presence, and for the Assistance
you give by your Purse, to those Arms which upon no stronger a ground are
raised against Him; For it is not justifiable in you to violate your duty, for
fear least another may not discharge his. Consider this as seriously as the
matter deserves, and you will be of my opinion, that when that sin shall be
laid to your charge at the day of Judgment, it will be then found that a
future possible Tyrant will not excuse a present certain Rebel.

But, Sir, I will count all this cast away upon you. I will be confident that
since in order to Peace, and immediate disbanding of the Armies, the King
desires nothing but what is Law, and denies nothing that is so; since He asks
not all that by Law He might ask, but only that so much as was by violence
taken from Him, before the War, may be now quietly restored to Him, and
submits all the other Injuries He has received, and all those Delinquents He
has been so charged to protect, to be considered and tried in a full, peaceble
and secure convention in Parliament; since after this offer nothing can be so
impudent, as to pretend your Arms to be any longer necessary and defensive;
since you can say nothing to persuade the King to yield to what they ask, but
only that unless He will yield to what you will not say is reasonable, they
are unreasonable enough to choose to destroy the Kingdom by continuing the
War, I will be confident, that suppose this unreasonablenesse seem a Reason
for the King to take their Conditions, it can appear none to you to take their
Parts, and you will never continue with those men of whom you have those
thoughts. No, Sir, you are too much a Lover of unity and Government, too good
natured, too much a Gentleman to be a ROUNDHEAD, that is to fight to introduce
nothing but Brownisme, Independance, Insolence, Hardheartednesse and Parity,
and to put the Kingdom into such hands, as before this business began, were
known to few men in it. I know you were engaged into this insensibly and by
degrees, and (though you had then both a worse Opinion of the Court, and a
better of the House of Commons, then their different demeanors since has by
this time persuaded you to have) yet if you had ever guest it would have come
to this, you would as soon have meddled with a Serpent as with the Militia, and
would have left them as soon as I did. I know nothing but the unjustifiable
shame of confessing a past Error to avoid a perpetual one, has since kept you
with them, and therefore doubt not but you will now submit to that shame (as a
punishment due for the fault of having been ashamed to do your duty so long,
and as a trouble that will bear no Proportion to the delight of having at last
satisfied your Conscience) and leave those, who in my Conscience love those
among you who stay with them, and are not of them, worse then they do any
evil Counselor in Oxford, and who, when you have sufficiently established
their Power for them, will sufficiently show it. And in confidence (upon these
Reasons) that you will bring me a sudden Answer to this Letter your self, I
remain

SIR, Your much pleased and very humble servant.
Oxford, Oriell College the 4. of May, 1643.
