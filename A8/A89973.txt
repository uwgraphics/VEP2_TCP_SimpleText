A New Found STRATAGEM FRAMED IN THE OLD FORGE of Machivilisme, and put upon
the Inhabitants of the County of Essex.

To destroy the Army under his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax, and to inslave
all the Freeborn of England on a sudden: Manifested and laid down, in certain
animadversions, upon a Clandestine, illegal Petition, contrived, made, and
privately printed, by a destructive party in London: and then by them sent down
to the Ministers of the County of Essex, to publish as on the last Lords day,
4. April, to the people, with directions to take their subscriptions in two
sheets of paper: which being done:

So many of the Subscribers as can, are to be desired to meet at Stratford
Langton, the 18. instant April, and so to come and present the same to both
Houses, as the Petition and sense of the whole County: whereas it was never
propounded to the County, nor ever heard of among them, before it came down
ready in print, from London, to be published by their Ministers, in there
several Parishes.

With certain Observations and Cautions on the same, conducing to the
information, and public good of the whole Kingdom.

Psalm 37.12, 13. The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him
with his teeth* The Lord shall laugh at him: for he sees that his day is
coming.

Published principally for the Meridian of the County of Essex, but may serve
for all the Counties of England 1647.

A new found STRATAGEM: Framed in the old Forge of Machiavilisme, and put upon
the Inhabitants of the County of Essex: The which intended, Clandistine,
dissembled, deceitful Petition, (not more spetious then treacherous) is as
follows, viz.
To the right honorable, the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, Assembled in
Parliament
The humble Petition of the Inhabitants of the County of Essex.
Humbly shows,
THat in alexigencies having freely, and with the first engaged themselves to
the uttermost hazard of their lives, and exhausted their estates, for the
support of the Kingdom, in its native rights, and liberties, and by the
blessing of God, the successes have been answerable in some degree to their
desires, by which we sit in peace and your selves in security, with a full
possession of the hearts of the people, and now fearing least by the
miscarrying on, of the military charges beyond the necessity of the work, and
the ability of the people, now much weakened by a dearth, sharper then the late
devouring sword; you should hazard the loss of your selves, and friends, not
so much the alienation of their affections (which yet. Is not to be neglected)
as their disablity to serve you which may arise from the Army now on foot,
after six months cessation of all hostility here, and so bleedingly called,
for to the saving of another Kingdom:

And also from so numerous a party in this County, shortly by their quarters
like to equal all precedent charges, and to surmount the worst, and heaviest
of our former taxes, espetially by the manner of being imposed on us

Your Petitioners do humbly offer to your prudence, the speedy disbanding of
the Army, as a plenary expedient against the worst, that in general may be
feared by you and us, and the removal of it from the County, by which you
shall continue absolute Masters, and disposers of them, and theirs in all your
pious and faithful undertakings for the future; and that God will assist you
for all your safeties, it shall be the daily prayers of your Petitioners.

Certain Animadversions and Observations upon the said Petition.
O Foolish men of Essex! who has be witched you? ye did run well, who has
hindered you? for indeed ye were with the first, and most forward, in assisting
the Parliament, for the recovering and regaining our then lost Laws and
liberties and (to your everlasting fame be it spoken) ye have (according to
the narrative part of the Petition) both hazarded your lives, and exhausted
your estates, in the common cause of the Kingdom; but ye are not alone. And
will ye do and suffer all these things in vain, if it be yet in vain? Will
ye now foolishly (through the delusion of a treacherous party of corrupt
members in both Houses, and covetuous ambitious Clergy, who seek by feigned
words, and false pretenses to ensnare, and inslave you, and to make themselves
Lords over you) deprive your selves of all the blessed fruits which ye are
likely, and may (by Gods blessing) suddenly reap and enjoy? if ye your selves
do not let, by being induced causlesly to Petition; or act, for the disbanding
of that Army, by whom God has given you such answerable successes as your
selves mention; and caused you as ye confess) to sit in peace, and the House
in security, in which your free acknowledgment, I acknowledge you, far more
noble then the House themselves; for instead of giving God so much glory, or
showing themselves so much as verbally thankful, by any such acknowledgement,
they committed Major Tewledy the other day, only because he told Hollis, Earl,
and others in effect, the same thing.

And whereas it is said in the pretended Petition that the Parliament is in
full possession of the hearts of all the people, how true this claw-back
insinuation is, I appeal to your own hearts and ask, whether ye do not hear
more clamours and complaints then ever heretofore, and do not see more
injustice, cruelty, and oppressions exercised and executed by the Parliament,
then ever was by the King, and feel more abundant, and heavy pressures and
impositions laid upon you, (even to your necessery food and raiment, and the
fruit of your own labors) then ever were in the worst of former times? so
that the people, abhor them and all their actions, they are weary of their
burdens; and how then can ye affirm that the Parliament, is fully possessed
of the peoples hearts, when as they are rather possessed of their hates?

As for that subtle suggestion of fear, in which is implied a specious
pretense of a care to avoid a future inconvenience, viz. least by carrying on
the Military charges beyond the necessity of the work (as if there were now no
need of the Army, and that if it was disbanded, ye should be troubled no more
with such military taxes and charges) and the ability of the people, (as if
Essex was so poor and eaten up, which has been least troubled with
quartering) now much weakened with a dearth (not more I hope then other
Countries ( sharper then the late devouring sword (God for bid, do not belly
God) you should hazard the loss of your selves and friends, and not so much
the alination of their affections, as their disability to serve you etc. It is
both groundless and senseless for if this Army were now disbanded, the
Parliament would still carry on the military charge, by raising them another in
this Armies stead, and to that end they have both nominated certain officers
which they intend to imply therein, and voted the raising of 60000 l a month
to maintain it and the forces in Ireland: So that the taking away this Army,
will not take away the military charge from you, and the Parliament it seems
would never the less hazard the loss of your good affections, and ability to
serve them, and therefore ye may even spare that your great care for them, and
it is very probable you may suddenly (if you do not already) find that they
have no such great care of you.

And where it is said that by quartering so many of them, their quarters are
like shortly to equal all precedent charges, and to surmount the worst and
heaviest of your taxes especially by the manner of their being imposed on you:
Your Taxes sure have either been few, and very small in respect of others, or
else the quartering of this Army which is (as I have heard) content with
ordinary provisions, and will not abide I am confident longer then is
convenient with you, and pays quarters so often as it receives pay, cannot
amount to such your incomparable prejudice, as those high and hyperbolricall
expressions (of amounting and surmounting) do sound forth, and import: and as
for the manner of their being imposed on you, I do believe it is neither
forceably, nor disproportionably: but this particular his Excellency Sir Thomas
Fairfax, their General (who was never yet taxed for any irregular quatterings)
can more distinctly answer; and so I have done with the narative part of your
pretended, or intended Petition.

Now whereas in the conclusion, or Petitionary part, ye^ are humbly to offer
the speedy disbanding of the Army, as a plenary expedient, against the worst
that may in general be feared by you and them, and to have it removed out of
your County, that so the Parliament (as ye must say, but I hope do not wish)
may be absolute Masters and disposers of you and yours for the future etc. I
would have you observe that here is a dainty gul, a notable piece of
machiavilisme put upon you, not only to make you the instruments of removing
those, who as they have redeemed your rights and liberties, are also ready and
willing, and the principal means, as the things now stand, to defend and
maintain your liberties, and to keep you and yours from sudden vasalage and
slavery; but also in plain terms voluntarily to offer your selves slaves; as,
that the Parliament shall be the absolute Masters and disposers of you and
yours: I hope ye know better what belongs to your own inherent power and
native rights, then to make your servants your Masters, or so to own them: as
to let your Stewards, have absolute command over you, and all you have; who by
the duty of their places are to give you an account of what they have done for
you, and how they have disposed that they have already had of you: Thus much
for the opening of the Petition: And now I will show you the illegality,
inequality, and ill consequences thereof, if ye be so fond, as to subscribe
the same, and proceed therein.

1. For the illegallity: That which is to go under the name of a County or
Corporation ought to be first publicly propounded to all the Inhabitants of
that County or Corporation, that there may be a general meeting, debate, and
consultation about the matter intended, and to be concluded, by and among
themselves: Otherwise it is clandestine, and surruptitious comprehending rather
faction, then public concurrence and therefore may justly be rejected: And
such is this Petition; For it was never publicly propounded, nor debated, or
consulted by the Inhabitants of the County of Essex, but was (as manifestly
appears) secretly devised, and framed by a private party, of Lords and Commons,
yea, and ready printed, before the matter was either made known or published
among you; and then it was sent down to the Ministers to publish on the fourth
of this instant month, with order to take your subscriptions in two sheets of
paper, now is not here an obtrusion on your privileges and immunities, and an
illegal, unjust and indirect course used, both in the framing of this
petition, and getting your subscriptions? (even just such means as Parliament
men, use in the elections of new members) and therefore it is not to be
accepted, but the contrivers ought rather to be found out and punished; and
again it wants one qualification, which is especially requisite, in all
Petitions, and much more in such as concern the public, and are presented to
the Parliament, that is; necessity of the thing desired, but this is not
petit^^^ necess^ria, a necessary petition for, if the Parliament intend his
Army (as they say) for Ireland, it is much more necessary to keep them in a
body entire, then to disband them; for then they will disperse, and most will
depart to their own homes, and never go upon the se^vice: and in case they do
not intend or (...) they shall go for Ireland, then it is as needful to keep
them together, for seeing that the Parliament do conclude that there is yet a
necessity of keeping up an Army still with^n this Kingdom, is it not better (I
pray you) to have this Army which we know, and of whose fidelity and Christian
behavior we have had such sufficient experiment continued then a new Army
raised, of I know not whom and what? It may be of such as the general part of
the Earl of Essexes, or Massies Brigade, and others were; whose ill manners,
besides other unseen all consequences ye will unhappily find to be a mountain
to your backs, in comparison of the present Mole hill quartrerings.

And now for the inequality of this Petition it contains mighty earnest
desires to have this Army speedily disbanded, seems to complain greatly of
their quarterings; but never moves or mentions one word that their arreares may
be paid them, or that from henceforth more constant pay may be made them, that
so they may for the future pay their (...) better. Have they deserved for all
they have done (Countrymen) for you, and the whole Kingdom, no better reward,
then to be disbanded and turned off with nothing? What not so much as their
due, (the price of their lives) for preserving of yours? Is this equal? Are
ye also unjust and ingratfull? Ask your daily Thresher, your plowman, and
days labourer if they will be contented with the like dealing? A bad
iccompence; yet let them be comforted; God is their po^^on and their great
reward.

As for the evil consequences of this Petition (or of the like) incase ye
should persist and proceed therein and that it should (as it ought not to) be
granted, they are many and more then I, or you, or the most part of this blind
Kingdom, does or (...) foresee or apprehend but I will only him at one head
or two, and so commend all to the judgments of the world and your
consideration.

By all appearances (and to me it is visible) that there is a strong endeavor
and design by a company of false, traitorous, and deceitful men; in both
Houses of Parliament, and of proud, coveteous Priests, who have combined in
one, for the accomplishment of their own domination and power over us,
suddenly to inthrall and inslave us; that so they may keep their abominable
actions from being questioned, and themselves from deserved shame and justice,
and there is no let for them in the way to it but this Army, the which they
know right well will not be corrupted, but does expect to have their Oaths and
Declarations fulfilled, and therefore do these ill men work by all means
possibly to disband and dissolve it, and in particular by the contriving and
sending you this Petition to own and subscribe, that they may take thereby a
seeming just cause, as desired of the Country, to proceed in their distructive
purpose, the which if they can bring to pass, then will they raise up an Army
of wicked men, ready, and reserved for that end, which shall be a standing Army
for their defense, in the execution of all their injustice and oppressions, and
by the help of the inland Garrisons (whereof I am sure there is now no need)
will they tyrannize (not like Lords and Kings, but worse then either great
Turk, or grim Tarter) over us: and and where then I pray, is our Laws and our
liberties, for which this Army has fought; and which they have redeemed for us
with their sword, and for which we have paid so dear? And thus ye will have
the last clause of the Petition fulfilled really, to your sorrow and woe; for
ye shall not more be ruled by a known Law, as free men of England, but curbed
and governed by the sword, as the Peasants be of France, and the inslaved Bores
of Flanders who indeed (as your Petition is) are wholly and all they have at
their lawless Masters dispose, Nay they will not tyrannize over your bodies
only, but your souls also; for then you must put on the Presbyterian yoke; it
is already so agreed between them and our dear Brethren of Scotland, and
because they cannot otherwise set up amongst us that antichristian inslaving
government, they will do it by the sword, and so we shall have a Religion
established, as Mahomet established his Alchoran, for if ye will not obey, ye
must expect either smart, pecuniary punishment, or destroying, imprisonment:
and ye may see the proud Priests footing even in this Petition: is it not
commended unto them, and are not they to attempt you on a sudden, and to
surprise your judgments by fained words and speeches? and I believe you see
not their end in it, it is because they know that this Army is generally an
enemy to their pride, and pompous Lordly livings, crying down their Diana,
their Tyth-monging and unlawful calling, wheresoever they come, whereby their
trade (for so they make their preaching only and alone to be) is in danger to
be set at naught; and it is by their craft (as Demetrius said) that they get
their wealth, and therefore would they stir up you, under the pretense that the
quartering of the Army, is a burden to you, to Petition to have them disbanded,
at least to have them removed.

But I hope Countrymen ye are more wise, then to be acted by other men's
councels, to father a child that is none of your own, that was formed, borne,
amd brought forth, before it came to your knowledge or sight: can any man tell
better then your selves, where your shoe pincheth you, and what is most
expedient for you to do? Never render your selves so rediculous, as to be led
like children and fools by the nose; to be made stalking horses for other men's
designs, whose interests are dissonant, and inconsistant with yours.

As for this poor Army, what evil has it done, wherein has it so highly
offended? for which of all its good deeds is it so oppressed, despised, hated,
and persecuted? Is it (when all others falsified) for proving faithful, or for
accomplishing your deliverance, beyond your own faith or expectation) in so
short a time? pardon them these offenses, another Nation would do it, and hold
them dear, their very enemies cannot but justify them, and yet so great is
their malice toward them; that because they petitioned the House but for their
Arrears, an act of indemnity to save them harmless, a more constant pay,
that they might be able to pay their quarters, and some few other most just and
reasonable things; they unjustly declared against them in print, as mutinous,
and obstructers to the releife of Ireland, whereas (God knows) there are many
thousands spare Soldiers besides in this Kingdom, whom they might if they
would) send thither.

And when their Officers, Lieutenent general Hamond, Commissary Ireton, and
others appealed to the House: and desired that these malicious suggestions
might be proved, or the Authors punished, and the Army vindicated; they could
not obtain so much at civil right, as the authors of these false aspertions
(which were Rossiter and Harley) to be called forth; an act both base and
shameful but what is to be expected, where justice is fortified with impudence.

One word more to you sweet men of Essex. Whose poultery has this Army
destroyed? whose goods have they spoiled, or whose sheep or calves have they
stolen, or whose persons have they confronted, terrified or abused in their
Houses, or what markets have they hindered by robbing of passengers, and
infesting the roades and high ways, as too many others ye knew who have been
less provoked, have done? If none of this be done, what just cause then have
ye, I say ye, more then all other Counties, where they have been, to complain
or petition against them? I could tell you: that ye have every man sat at home
under his Vine, and under his fig tree with full tables in peace and safety,
when these poor souls have been in the field in the face of death, in frost,
snow, rain, cold, heat, wet, and dirt, by day, by night, in hunger and thirst,
to keep back from you, and to suppress the fury of your blood-thirsly enemies:
and can you, or any chirstian man think on this, and so ill reward this
precious Army? In reason it is impossible, but experience proves the contrary,
so full of bitterness, rage and malice, has the Devil filled the hearts of
some men against them; but of you I have better hopes, presuming that ye will
not be so easily removed from your own steadfastnesse, nor be persuaded through
the deluding subtilty of any, to act in the least against those, who have
endured so many difficulties, passed so many perrils, obtained so many
victories, and never accounted their own lives dear unto them for your sakes.
Whatsoever others may do, either, through ignorance or malice, yet let it not
be said, that the County of Essex (a County that has always been esteemed
prudent and religious) did show it self ingratfull or despightfull to the
preservers both of their religion and lives.

Truly in my thoughts this Army can never be enough requited, for do we not
at this day, (next under God) by them enjoy all we have? Have not they subdued
our enemies, and removed our fears, and caused us to dwell in safety? And are
not they a contented, patient, well governed people, can you say that God is
not amongst them? then certainly they that hate and despite them are of the
Devil.

For my part (Countrymen and all others whom it may concern) I hold nothing
more expedient for you, and me, and all true English men (seeing the public
adversary is subdued, and our Parliament so averse, and indisposed to do us
justice and establish our liberties) then to petition forthwith effectually, to
have justice speedily, and impartially executed, and our Laws and liberties
established, and a just account rendered of all the moneys they have received:
and without question when these just things are done, the Army will of its own
accord cease and lay down. I account this that unum Necessarium, that one
necessary thing, which is now principally to be minded in the Kingdom, and not
to petition about quarterings, and removings, and preachings, and places, and
any thing indeed, rather then this very, only thing, without which all other
our outward enjoyments are nothing, was but one thing done (Law, and liberty
established) the wheels of our State would go easily, commands would be
pleasant, discontents would be removed, injustice, oppression and Treason would
be banished, and supplanting dividing spirits would be utterly disappointed. In
the mean time till this be done, it is the best and only way for the Countries
and free commoners of England, to preserve this Army in power and being, and to
petition that it may still stand and be continued, and tha others (rather then
it) may be sent into Ireland, that so in case these just demands be denied,
contrary to duty, Oath and Covenant, the poor Commons may have a shelter and
defense to secure them from oppression and violence, and his Excellency and
every Soldier under him by the duty of his place, and virtue of the
Protestation, is bound thereunto. Who knows whether we may not yet have as
great need of this Army, as we have ever had? For it is evident and all men may
see, that our native rights and liberties are now in more hazard, then they
were at the first, and that we are more in jeoperdy, of them by a close
traiterous party (our pretended friends) then we were by our public professed
foes. And our greatest, and most dangerous enemies, are now they of our own
House.

Sweet friends, I am a mere stranger to you, but one that am a true lover of my
Country, and therefore thought good, as a Member of the same body politic
with you, to give you a few animadversions, with some cautions, and
observations; concerning the subtle and deceitful, dissembled practices,
wherewith your homebred adversaries, go about to make you instruments of your
own misery and mischief. And lastly, mark this I beseech you and consider it
seriously.

Why cannot the Parliament as well send over those Officers and Soldiers they
have intended for a new Army here, to serve in Ireland, as these of this Army?
Can they give the Kingdom a satisfying reason? It is more then I and many more
can apprehend, if they can: But if here ly not a deep mystery, no better then
close treachery, I am grossly mistaken. Let none therefore so far delude you,
as to draw you to petition for the disbanding of this Army, no, both for your
honor and security, discountenance and disclaim it and all such practices and
conspiracies against it, for such deeds will savor more of ignorance, malice
and invie then of any prudence, justness, or necessity, and whereas in the
close of the Petition, it is said that the disbanding of this Army is a plenary
expedient against the worst in general that may be feared, let them by no
means under pretense of benefit, ease, or advantage, deceive you, for it is
apparent, and will yet be made more manifest that the disbanding, or otherwise
dissolving of this Army, is the only plenary expedient to render us Vassals and
slaves, to the will of our enemies, and to bring upon us the worst of miseries,
and that suddenly and insensibly, for alas we are at the pit brinke, and see
not.

FINIS.
