MADAM,
ALthough my former freedom in writing might rather give me occasion to beg
pardon for a fault committed, then to proceed in the same kind: Yet I know not
how it comes to pass, that in stead of repenting and abstaining, I am drawn
to re^terate and aggravate this fault, by a higher presumption. The cause of
this irregular motion in my spirit I can attribute to nothing but to that which
all sinners may pretend for their excuse; namely, a strong bent of desire, and
an inclination moving me irresistibly to do what I am about to do: together,
with a secret hope and promise to my self of forgiveness grounded upon your
obliging disposition: Upon such motives as these we all sin against God. If
then you will be so patient to bear with me, as he does with sinners, till
they may be reclaimed, and so bountifully kind as to imitate him, in using
means to cure my distemper; I will be thankful, and truly acknowledging the
merit of your virtue, be bound to serve you and honor your Sex. For I must
confess that partly the silly weakness, and want of capacity, which does
appear in most of the Female kind; partly, the disproportion of spirit which I
have found in my self from the ways of their conversation, has kept me at a
distance, till of late one whom you know has made me perceive, both by her
self, and by the Characters of your excellent spirit, which I find in some of
your Letters unto her, that God has not deprived that part of mankind of
eminent graces, with strength of parts and abilities to do him spiritual
service, and to be more helpefull in some things toward the advancement of the
Kingdom of his Son then even Men themselves. Upon this discovery, I confess
my inclination to converse did grow more free, and the prejudice, which made me
shie, being taken away, my affection was enlarged to be willing to contribute
unto that subject which I found most susceptible of the best Motions, most
apprehensive of the chiefest Aims and most generously active and resolute to
set forward the fittest Means and Ways leading thereunto; that assistance and
help, which my calling in the profession of the Gospel did oblige me to
afford. And in continuance of this endeavor, some intimacie being grown
betwixt us, and a settlement of that resolution (which I had long before vowed,
maintained, and practiced, to live no more to my self, but unto the Communion
of Saints,) Being then also begotten in her, I found that she was capable, not
only of a Moral, but of a Spiritual friendship: And therefore upon her
departure into Ireland, after that I had been in Holland, I proposed unto her
the heads of a Covenant of spiritual friendship, to be maintained for the Aims
of public and mutual Edification, as well at a distance as when we should be
near at hand. In this Bond, and in the faithful and single prosecution of the
duties thereof we have continued till this day, upon several occasions
confirming and rectifying our purposes therein by such Rules as the Word of God
through the spirit of divine and common. Love have revealed unto us. Now the
only thing, which I for my part have ever found a hinderance and distraction
from the accomplishment of the duties whereunto we are bound, which does
ordinarily clog the prosecution, and frustrate the effecting of that for which
God has moved us to contract this friendship is merely the want of freedom
to communicate upon all occasions our thoughts one to another, which is
occasioned by the distance of our abode. This does put both my spirit within me
to a perpetual straitness, and the prosecution of my Work in public without
me to a lingering slownesse. For seeing I find it impossible at such a distance
as we have lived, and still live in these busy times, to satisfy that tie
which our friendship does put upon my conscience, either for the public
Edification of many, or for the private comforts of each other against the
causes of common perplexities, whereunto all private conditions are involved.
Seeing, I say, I find it impossible at such a distance to satisfy in such
occurrences and for such ends my conscience chiefly in point of ready
deliberation, or seasonable execution of that, whereunto the love of Gods
service, as well in public as in private does bind me, and that only by
reason of our distance; therefore I have often desired, that a way may be found
to remove it: But because I find other inconveniences in the removal thereof,
which will ensue in respect of the world, which will blast the fruit of all our
intentions, except some nearer relation prevent the same; and because I see no
warrant to stint the increase of friendship and divine love from the nearest
relations for humane respects, nor is it conscionable, without Gods own way,
to confirm the application of ones self to one particular, more then to many,
with a restraint of the Spirit, from intending others in the same degree, who
may be, if not alike capable, yet no less inclinable to serve God in the same
way; I say, Madam, for these and some other causes now to be omitted, I am
necessitated to break through humane respects, by casting my self upon God,
who does in the capacity of your Spirit open a door unto me to see a way
through the obstacles, which otherwise might seem impassable. For I am
confident, that your Ladyship is able to discern what hand God has in this
business of our continued acquaintance, and I make no doubt but you also see
clearly, that I will be constrained in the end either to fail in friendship by
not fulfilling a Covenant made in the fear of God, (which is a thing
intolerable to my very thought to apprehend) or to neglect Gods service in the
Gospel of peace, and Communion of Saints, to which I am more bound then to the
former, by how much this Aim is the more Universal then that, (which is as
grievous and less supportable to my thoughts) except the public and private
relations, under which we both stand, be brought to be one and the same in
their due subordination, which cannot be done without the nearest conjunction
of our persons in the freedom of all manner of commerce, for the performance
of these duties and endeavors, upon which our intimacie is grounded; and
without which it is not lawful, as being not subordinate unto the glory of
God. I^ t^en the causes of our distance do really disturb my peace, and make
my straightened spirit lead a wearisome life; and if these obstacles of our lawful
conjunction hinder us both from the work of Gods glory in our callings, which
might many ways more comfortably then now it is, be performed; and if your
spiritual Sagacitie cannot but find this to be so: I may (I hope) without
despair of Pardon presume to make this request, that you would be pleased to
represent this case unto your Aunt, who is here, to desire her to remove the
impediment of which I complain, by that approach which may be honorable
before God and Man, and give me the full freedom of performing all duties
which God does require of those whom he makes one body for his service. As
for any doubts which she might have had concerning the state of Marriage, and
the usefulness thereof to Gods glory, I have by general discourses
endeavored to take them away, and am confident, by the grace of God, that all
scruples, that either she or any in her condition may have about that matter,
will easily be resolved. Therefore I cannot but seek, that she may fulfill her
part toward the full accomplishment of the effect of our Covenant, although I
neither at first, nor a long time after, did conjecture any necessity of such
a sequel as now I find enforced (by the circumstances into which God cast, me)
upon my intentions. And this, Madam, I could never have uttered unto any of her
friends, besides your self, because I know that there is none to whom she has
so great confidence; and I believe, there is none able to judge better of the
case then you are, as being fully persuaded of your Spiritual and Rational
parts; for which cause you may see, that I have put the trust of my self, and
of the secrets of my heart, upon which the chief comforts which I expect in
this temporal life depend, in your hand, to use them as your conscience to the
love of Gods glory shall direct you: For I protest truly in his presence,
that it is no worldly desire, nor earthly intention, nor personal passion,
(although I cannot wholly deny the affections of humanity) which does sway or
lead me to this motion, but merely the discharge of my duty, to advance the
glory of God in my Calling, by the fittest means which his providence does
afford. On him therefore I rely for success, according to the sincerity
which he sees in me; wherein also I will take my leave, commending your spirit
in this and all other things to his gracious direction, who am

MADAM, Your Ladyships most humble and faithful Servant in Christ,
This 4/14 December, 1644.
MADAM,
THis last Post brought me a great confirmation of my resolution concerning
Master N. which resolution I desire should be known there: the ground of it is
in his Letter to your Ladyship, therefore I send it again; and the rather,
because I cannot possibly lay down now the particular Reasons of this Union
with him; which I thought to have done, for the satisfying such who are either
capable of Grace, or Reason: As for your self (with whom there is none ranked)
I perceive your Ladyship takes up most of these things, which has obliged me
to yield to Master N. Proposition; and therefore I am not much solicitous for
others, knowing you will (as occasion serves) inform all, as they are capable:
which I must leave to you, beseeching the Lord of life to fill you more with
the abundance of his Grace, that you may still be a help to Gods people, and a
comfort in God, to

MADAM, Your Ladyships most faithful, humble, and most affectionate Servant,
11 / 22 Febr. 1645.
MADAM,
YOur Gratulatorie affection is no less obliging then your intercession, and I
hope the Lord will make me thankful for all the blessings which he has
bestowed upon me; amongst which, that which you mention, of such a Friend and
Wife in one person is the greatest in temporal things: and as he has by his
Grace joined our hearts, not for worldly Ends, but for a Spiritual Aim of
serving him; so I am confident, that he will direct us in that way which is
most unblameable: and as we seek not the honor and appearances of this world,
but are sincerely bent to seek the honor which is from God alone, without any
show in the world, that we may be counted worthy to partake of the Cross of
Christ, and to be mortified unto the world with him; so I believe steadfastly,
that God will sanctify us, and make us Vessels of Honor for every good use in
his Tabernacle, and quicken us by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the more we
shall be liable to the censures of the world. Yet I think it very fit, that
some Means should be used, such as your Ladyship does mention, to stop the
censoriousnesse of worldly-minded Friends, which will be intended with the
first occasion by her, who will be more subject to be blamed by those that
consider things after the flesh, then I will be either by them or others. But
we shall jointly intend the clearing of our ways toward Men, as we have
approved them hitherto before God; that perhaps the eyes of such as are dim
may see somewhat clearer then yet they do the purposes of our life, which
shall truly be dedicated in all faithfulness to your Ladyships comforts, by

MADAM, Your most affectionate and humble Servant in Christ.

MADAM,
YOur affectionate Congratulations to our Union, I make, no doubt, will be
accompanied with your prayers to God for us, that we may be enabled to attain
the End of our lawful Conjunction, and be strengthened in the dutiful
performance of those Endeavors which have drawn us to this state, which by
Gods grace may be effectually useful to his Glory, and the Edification of
others, which is all the ground of the Comfort which we seek in one another
Society. I am bound therefore to praise God for this inclination and frame of
spirit, whereby he has joined us first to himself, then one to another, and
lastly, to all others who can understand what the End of every Christians life
is, as well in this as in any other Relation: and I rejoice not a little, to
see your Ladyships hearty Congratulations going along with us, upon this
discovery and knowledge of our way in these proceedings. For although others,
who are good in their own degree, reach not to the Aims which have brought us
to this state; yet in due time, by the ability which God has endued your
Ladyship withal, I hope, their apprehensions may be rectified, to look upon
matters with another Eye then hitherto they have done: it is a blessing of God
to be prayed for unto them, to discern the things most excellent; and when we
discern them, to be resolute in following them is a duty which generous
spirits will delight in. Would to God we all could understand the saying of
Christ, as he meant it; That which is highly esteemed of Men, is abomination in
the sight of God. And in another place he says, How can ye believe, that
receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor which is of God alone?
We must speak of our selves, and profess, that we count nothing estimable
or honorable, but what is useful to his service, in the life of Christ; and
nothing is useful that way, but that which crucifieth the world to us, and us
to the world, in respect of the fashion of it, and outward surface of things,
which is void of Realitie. All that imaginary Substance, and Accidental Frame
of Corruptible Matters, which makes a show in this present World, does bring
us under a Yoke of Bondage, and depriveth us of the glorious liberty of the
Spirit of Adoption, in some degree or other, as we yield thereunto. Therefore,
as our sense is, so we will in our practice really endeavor to bear witness
to this Truth unto every one; and I suppose, my Wife would rather her Friends
should receive satisfaction, in reading her real performances of duties to
God, then any Apologies or Verbal Justifications. But I must needs break off,
as being straightened in time; therefore I can scarce read over what is here
written in haste: only I must say in truth, that I am

Your Ladyships most humbly affectionate and obliged Servant,
4 / 14 April, 1645.
