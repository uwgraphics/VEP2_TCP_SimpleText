EXCLAMATIO PAVPERVM: THE EXCLAMATION, OR THE OUTCRY OF THE POOR: Against
Those State Gudgeons at Westminster, who have swallowed up their lively-hoods
by their unlawful Taxes, to uphold their Rebellion, to the ruin of the
Kingdom in general, and the absolute beggering of many thousands of Tradsmen
(who before the ravenous State had the power to stretch them upon the tenters
of their libidinous wills) lived happily and plentifully with their families,
but now for want of Trade, they are in a perishing condition, and altogether
void of any relief from those who grind the face of the Poor, and hate them,
because they are the Image of God. But I would wish all good men to observe the
words of Solomon.

Prove. 14.31. He that oppresses the Poor, reproves him that made him: but he
honoreth him, that has mercy of the Poor.

O cursed Monsters, and incarnate Devils,
Thus on the Kingdom still to vent your evils;
What! do you think there is no God at all,
That surely will with vengeance on you fall?
Yes, yes our God is just, and he will try
You in the fire of Hels eternity:
If you repent not, and for mercy crave,
Damnation you are certain for to have.

Exclamatio Pauperum. THE EXCLAMATION, OR, OVT-CRY of the POOR, etc.
WHat! will you still run on to our destruction? without any remorse at all of
our miseries; not so much as once to take notice of our future calamities,
which are like to be greater than our present sufferings, although they be
altogether insupportable, according to our weak abilities, for which we may
think your ungracious inhumane proceedings; who that you may be glutted with
the riches of the Kingdom, and inebriate your selves with the blood of Loyal
Subjects, you have hitherto, and still do by all means possible, both public
and private, both by entreaty and threats, endeavors to persuade and seduce
diverse to hazard their lives, that so they might support your cursed and worse
than heathenish cause: But now your hellish intentions having been found to be
so horrid and cruel, even as to extend not only to the murdering of many poor
subjects of this Kingdom (which is a crime both by the law of God and man
deserving death) but you have also endeavored your selves: First to divest the
King of his Royal Power, and by false and scandalous papers and pamphlets to
alien the hearts of his Subjects from him; but you too would turn Regicides
and destroy him (which if not happily prevented (by that good and loyal
Gentleman Mr. Osborne) had doubtless in a short time effected by your agent,
that wretched Cative, and ever infamous desperate Rebel Captain Rolph, under
the command of that cursed Cerberus, Hammond) an act so horrid in the sight of
God and man, that if it had bin executed, must needs a hastened Gods indignation
upon this milcreant Parliament, however the intention of the murder of so
sacred a Person as is our King (whom we ought not to harbor an evil thought
of) is sufficient to cause the earth to swallow them, as it did Chora and his
accomplices, for their conspiracy and treachery against Moses, that so succeding
ages might be forewarned, how they sought the overthrow of him that is
appointed to be their King and Ruler.

Thus while you spare not any thing to perpetrate our miseryes, and make our
dolors greater: We, our Wives and Children (to whose indigent and sorrowful
cries you stop your ears, like men who wish rather to continue our woes, than
remedy them) are like to suffer by that miserable plague of Famine, our Wives
so disabled with want, that they are not able to nurse their young children,
who are in a perishing condition, not having relief according to their age; we
our selves miserably afflicted and almost starved, victuals is so deer and
chargeable, and our trading has so failed us with your oppressions, that we
are many thousands of us enforced with hunger to beg for our livings, which is
so poor a subsistence, to our needy and hungry souls (Charity is so slender)
that without some speedy remedy, whereby we may be again restored to our
former callings, we shall certainly dye in the streets by want of sustenance,
while you at Westminster like so many Neroes (having your delight with your
wantons and all varieties) sit upon the stage and laugh to see our miseries
every way increasing, with Cities, Towns and Villages burning, the Innabitants
some by the Sword, and others by the Famine or Pestilence consuming, and the
earth all staynd with innocent blood, for which you must surely give an account
in the last day, when your shifts, evations, and subtleties will not relieve
you, nor money purchase your freedoms before the dreadful Judgment Seat of
God.

Nay further, your malice is so great, and to show how willing you are to
destroy us, you would gladly have raised four shillings upon each Chaldron of
Coals for to have maintained that Hel-bound Haslerigge, and his Beagles, a
company of Schismatical Sectaries, thinking thereby to uphold your drooping,
dying, f^ding, falling, fainting Cause; but that our good Rulers of the City,
in their clemency toward us, would not agree to your wicked desires: Oh what
hellish Machiavilian inventions are these! still to plunge us further into
extremity, not being satisfied to extort by Taxes, and other Oppressions (both
numerous, and well nigh insupportable) from such who in some ^^all measure were
contributary to our necessity, but likewise by the raising and inhancing of our
necessary fire, that w^e^ the nipping cold of Winter come, we may dye with the
want of fuel, and by that means you be eased of (...) and tears, but be
certain they will ascend to he^ven and plead against you.

These, and thousands more of mischeifes are daily hatched by that wicked
crue^, and bloody Conventicle of Traitors against us, who like poor worms are
bruised and trodden to death by your pondrous and heavy foote-steps, daily
walking upon, and as hungry Dogs devouring us, our Wives and Children, that
you may be accounted the greater Tyrants by your insulting and domineering over
us the poorer sort of People, after you have almost ruined many gallant
Gentlemen with their Families, who we are confident would with the large extent
of their Charities have relieved some of our indigencies, but by your
diabolical useings, and worse than Turkish torturings, and most unlawful
Extorting both their Goods, and Revenues for this seven years now last past,
to make up the ends of a few needy Scoundrels (who before these unlucky broils
(which were begun by you) knew not scarcely how to provide themselves bread to
sustain their hunger, but now by fishing in the troubled waters of this
distracted Kingdom have raised to themselves great fortunes. And you who daily
ride up and down in Coaches, sit and vote our miseries; yes, and feast,
drink, and drab at pleasure; never remembering the Kingdoms sufferings; nay
you are grown to such a height of lewdness that there is not any thing which
may be called sin, but you endeavor to commit it without once reflecting
upon the events of your ungodly proceedings; although it has pleased GOD to
give you so many, and convenient opportunities to procure a happy Peace, and
stop all our distractions, and desolations which are so apparently falling
upon us by all the Handmaydes of War, Pestilence, Fire, and Famine.

While you (the Grand Assembly of incarnate Devils at Westminster, who have
all along by your retoricall Orations, Lies, and Forgeries blind foulded and
led us into a Captivity, for the number of years far worse than that of
Egypt, pretending still it was for our Religion, Laws, and Libertyes, and so
ensnared us by your damned subtleties, where now a short time (to our hearts
breaking has laid open your reprobate intentions and made manifest to us your
abhorred deceites and delusions, how instead of being the conservators of our
Freedoms, you are the destroyers of our future good Hopes, to enjoye either
Religion, or any good by your means: For you like Hedge-hogges not contenting
your selves with the Milk of the Cowes dugges will suck till blood come: I
mean you, who not satisfied with the detaining of men's livelie-hoodes from
them, do seek to spill their innocent lives (because they beg for their
own) that so you may the better assure your selves to enjoy their Vineyards in
safety: But God is the revenger of all wrongs, and will make his Arrows
sharp in the hearts of the KINGS Enemies, to their shame, and confusion.

Nay, it is not the Temporal Devils alone that work our Woes, but it is
likewise those Spiritual Fiends, and Sinagogue of Satan, who call themselves
the Reformers of the Church, but are indeed the Deformers, which having changed
their old Principles of Religion, Preach nothing but Rebellion and Treason,
bespattering the Pulpits with Sedition, Blasphemy, and Heresy, and exciting
all people to the murdering Kings, and killing Subjects, that they may be
upheld in their treble Beneficies, besides their four shillings per diem, not
caring who are the parties in sufferings and losses, if they may be principles
in gaining.

Which divelish acts of theirs will surely be
Revenged by the heavenly Deity.

FINIS.
