The joint Declaration of the several Counties OF KENT, ESSEX, MIDDLESEX,
SVRRY,
UNTO The Soldiers of the Army, now under the Command of the Lord Fairfax.
WHEREAS We the Inhabitants of the Counties aforesaid, have endeavored, by
the best, and (as it seemed unto us, the most effectual means, (a peaceable
Application of our selves by way of Petition) humbly and sadly to offer unto
the present Parliament, the many miseries which (by a new and bloody engagement
in the most unnatural War) were suddenly threatened unto this whole Kingdom
and Nation; and proposed unto them, as the only expedients to prevent these;
The present re-establishing of his Majesty unto his royal Rights. the
Settlement of Religion and Liberty, according unto the known, and received
Laws, and (upon payment of their Arreares) the disbanding of the Army.

Yet finding, unto our unspeakable Grief, that a prevailing party in the
present Parliament, contrary unto their many solemn professions and
protestations, and the ends for which we first engaged with them; have by the
power of the Army imprisoned the Kings Majesty, overthrown Religion; and our
liberty, and now for diverse years continued the freeborn People of England in
a greater Servitude, then at any time since the Norman Conquest; and have
slighted us in all our Addresses unto them; in regard whereof, and for timely
suppression of these usurpations, and mischiefs daily growing upon us, (no
other way being now left us) we have resolved to Arm, and by our power (God
assisting) to Command what we could not iutreat.

Unto the end and purpose aforesaid; we do hereby heartily and seriously
invite you, like honest and true-harted Englishmen, to join with us in this
good work, and desire you that upon notice hereof, every of you either serving
on horseback, or of the foot, in the said Army, forthwith to repair with your
horses and Arms unto us, or the several places of your abodes before your
engagement with the Army, where you shall immediately be provided for,
according unto your several qualities; and also present care shall be taken
that your whole Arreares, shall be forthwith paid unto you; And this as we
undertake for our selves so we doubt not to effect for you, in all the counties
throughout the whole Kingdom: Assuring our selves that you will no longer
adhere unto a Faction, set up to destroy this flourishing Kingdom, against
your friends, kindred, your own Bowels, and the present and future good of
your Country; which ought to be more dear unto every of you then his own life.

Whereof if ye shall take due notice, and do accordingly, ye may assuredly
expect from us, the regards and benefit aforesaid, otherwise we shall esteem
(and so deal with) you, as sworn enemies unto your King and Country.

1648. may.24.
Published by direction of diverse Gentlemen of the said Counties.
