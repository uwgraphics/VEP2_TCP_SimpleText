AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF TRADE

By a Relation of the Deceased.

AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF TRADE.
A Worthy Old Dame,
Mother Trade was her Name,
That had long lain in desperate State,
Perceiving at last
That all Hopes were past,
Contentedly bends to her Fate.
And since she is gone,
For the good Deeds sh'has done,
As it is common in such like Cases,
We can sure do no less,
Than attend on her Hearse,
With some Marks of Remorse on our Faces.
There Is her Granddaughter Art,
Has almost broke her Heart,
For the Loss of so Faithful a Friend:
She sits in her Chair,
In the Depth of Despair,
And seems to draw near to'ards her End.
Industry her Sister,
When she left her, she kissed her,
And bid her for Ever Adieu;
I must seek out a place,
Where to alter the Case,
For here I find 'twill not do.
Her Cousin Invention,
Seems too in Declension,
And sits down by her, and cries,
Oh! what shall I do?
I have naught to pursue,
Except it be Forging of Lies.
But what is still worse,
'Twou'd make a Man Curse,
Her Landlord has seized all she had;
He has not allowed
Her a Coffin and Shroud,
Good People, e'nt this very sad?
But the Beadle is gone,
To see what can be done;
It Is hard she should lie above-ground,
And yonder he comes,
A biting his Thumbs;
I Am afraid there is no help to be found.
Then, come Mr. Beadle,
Pray how look the People?
What means this mighty Dejection?
Why, Sir, the Folk look,
Like our Constable's Book,
That has been these Three Years in Collection.
I Am afraid, Mr. Blue Coat,
That you are no True Coat,
For all you look so precisely;
Why, sure they will give,
Since they wou'd'nt let her live,
Some small thing to Bury her wisely.
Come, come, you must out,
And try the other bout,
And pray put the thing to the Godly.
What! Must the good Dame
Lie unburied? For shame;
This all over the World will look odly.
Why, Sir, if you would hear me,
You Would instantly clear me,
I have been with abundance already,
As God knows my Heart,
I have acted my part,
And was always to serve her most ready.
I have been with the Merchant,
Who you know is an Arch one,
As also with the Baker and Brewer,
I have been with the Banker,
And with him that makes the Anchor,
With the Tailor, and almost all that knew her.
Then pardon my Passion,
'Twas my Zeal for my Nation,
That urged me a little too fast:
Come, prithee, go on,
Let me know Man by Man,
What betwixt you and each of them past.
For the Merchant then first,
When I told him, he Cursed,
And Swore he expected it long:
I Will be moving, says he,
No, Faith, they shall see
I Will never stay to Starve with the Throng.
My Debts lay an Embargo,
Or I Would be my own Cargo,
And Sail to the Land of Mogul;
But when a Man Breaks,
His Vessel then Leaks,
And it is Danger to Swim in the Hull.
But I Will Sell what I Have got, Land,
And even go to Scotland,
I Will venture their Itch and their Lice;
It Is better, you know,
Mr. Beadle, to go,
Than to stay here to be eat up with Mice.
And now for to give,
I have naught, as I live,
I was never so Poor in my Life;
The Times are so Dead,
I can hardly get Bread
For my Self, my Children, and Wife.
Next I went to the Baker,
And he was a Quaker,
But a little inclined to the Papist,
When I told him our Loss,
He made on him a Cross,
And Swore and Damned like an Atheist.
Says he, Friend, be gone,
For Money I Have none,
Go, prithee don't trouble my Shop;
Don't tell me of the Dead,
I must live by my Bread,
And so I was forced for to lope.
When I came out of the Door,
Says I, you Son of a Whore,
By your Forestalling, Regrating, and Cheating,
You have got an Estate,
And that makes you prate,
Take notice I owe you a beating.
I went hence to the Brewer,
And there I thought sure
I should meet with a little Relief;
But, Faith, when I come,
He looked so Damned grum,
I said nothing, but stood like a Thief.
It seems 'twas the Day
He was doomed to go pay,
Upon Ale and Beer, the Excise,
Betwixt Taxes and Malt,
Says he, I don't get Salt,
And so should lay down, were I wise.
At length I grew bold,
And went to him, and told
The long and short of the Thing,
His Reply was, don't teeze me,
Pray Friend, I Would be easy,
I must give not to her, but the King.
Then next with the Banker
I soon cast my Anchor,
And told him the state of the Dame;
His Answer was short,
All he had lay at Court,
And bid me return whence I came.
To the Anchor-smith next,
Whom I found sadly vexed,
At the News of a Merchant just Broke,
I asked him for something,
Who stood like a Dumb thing,
At last scratcht his Head, and thus spoke.
Friend, did you but know,
You Would never press me so,
And out he lugs a long Scroul;
As God is to Save me,
'Twixt Merchants and Navy,
I Am utterly Ruined, by my Soul.
Thence I trudged to the Tailor,
That Wretch did bewail her,
But Swore he had never a Souse;
If I had it, said he,
You should have something of me,
But, Faith, I Am scarce worth a Louse.
A Pox take all the Beaus,
They must have their New Clothes;
I abhor those Fools in the Fashion:
Your Knights, 'Squires, and Lords,
That will not keep their Words,
By Heavens, would there was none in the Nation.
I went next to the Drapers,
Found their Boys Cutting Capers,
With abundance of Fiddles and Flutes;
But when I asked them for Money,
They stood staring upon me,
As though they would been so many Mutes.
Said I, where is your Master?
So I told the Disaster;
To which answers one of the wisest,
Sir, he seldom comes here,
If he does, he with Beer,
In a dreadful manner disguised is.
From the Draper of Linen,
(Which they Sell, and then Sin in)
I went to their Brother of Wool;
But he gave me a Joke,
And said that his Poke
Was as empty as his Skull.
To the next that I went,
Was Old Sir Cent. per Cent.
That was soundly Enricht by her Art;
His Reply was in short,
I have found better Sport,
And don't value her Death of a Fart.
Being thus in quandary,
I met Apothecary,
And told him the full of the Matter;
He called me aside,
And asked when she Died,
And withal, what Doctors came at her.
I Am afraid, with their Blisters,
Their Purges and Clisters,
And Issues in every part,
They weakened her so much,
She could not stand the touch,
I Am afraid on it with all my Heart.
If her Head had been shaved,
She might have been Saved,
Had she taken a Vomit withal;
But if she is Dead, it is in vain
Any more to complain,
Here Is a Couple of Pence, it is my All.
I marched next to the Pressers,
And from him to the Mercers,
Where the Foreman stood Combing his Wig,
At the fur-end of the Shop,
The Lads were Whipping Top,
In the middle one Dancing a Jig.
You must know this Spruce Cit,
Laid a Claim to some Wit,
And to show it, took a Wise for her Beauty;
But I saw by his Face,
There was something in the Case,
I Am afraid sh'had late been on Duty.
Well, without long Petition,
I told the Condition,
He gave me this Answer in brief,
I lament the good Dame,
And speak it with Shame,
But have nothing to give for Relief.
Being Devilishly vexed,
To a Wretch I went next,
That was Selling of Buttons and Thread;
But had you been there,
You Would have said, I dare Swear,
He was more fit to be tied in his Bed.
When I told him, Mother Trade
Was gone to the Shade,
He Swore a great Oath, why do'u name her,
I have just Bought a Horse,
And I Will out for a Purse,
I Would almost venture Hanging to shame her.
I thought 'twas no boot,
To say more to the Brute,
And so to the Sadler I pack,
Where I found him a Swearing,
Stamping, Grinning, and Staring,
He had scarce got One to his Back.
Says he, these Commanders,
By their Warring in Flanders,
Have so Cursedly run in my Debt,
They Have scarce left me a Farthing,
To keep me from Starving,
Prithee, Friend, don't urge me to Fret.
I went then to the Grocers,
To the Brasiers and Throsters,
To the Binders and Sellers of Books;
But for the Success,
I could presently guess,
By their Goods in their Shops, and their Looks.
I went next to the Blacksmith,
The Silver and Jack-smith,
And so called on a Perfumer,
But he like a Rogue,
Though the Chief Trade in vogue,
Bid the Devil in Hell consume her.
I went to the Printer,
The Victualler and Vintner,
But there finding nothing but Chalk,
To the Weavers I went,
But being near Day of Rent,
They were all moved, their Landlords to baulk.
But, Sir, it is too long
To repeat the whole Throng,
I have been with most Trades in the City,
And said what I could,
But 'twould all do no good,
They Are too Poor to be wrought into Pity.
Having finished my Range,
From Temple Bar to the Change,
I thought of a New Expedition,
I was resolved to go,
As far as Soho,
And try of French and Dutch the Condition.
And yet by the way,
I made a short stay
At the Temple, if you know the place, Sir,
On a Lawyer I called,
That often Client had mauled,
And told him the state of my Case, Sir.
He asked me, from whence
I had that Impudence,
To expect any Goodness from him;
Says he, Sirrah, you know
We have nothing to do,
But to Cheat, Drink, Whore, and go Trim.
Then Mr. Attorney,
Since it don't concern ye
I Will go to the Jobbler of Stocks;
But he would Jobb'd so long,
As I found by his Song,
That he could give her naught but the Pox.
I went next to the Priest,
But he Swore, 'twas a Jest
To ask any Charity there,
For he would many Children to get,
With much Cost, Pains, and Sweat,
Besides something for Puddings and Beer.
And now for Monsieur,
Who before I came near,
I suppose, had smelt out the Matter;
He makes two or three Cringes,
As if he hung upon Hinges,
And thus he began for to Flatter,
Begar, me and Minheir,
Bin very sorry to hear
Of de Death of de English Trade;
Dis be one good Nation,
Upon my Salvation,
As ever me tinke dat God made.
Here I put him in mind
Of what I designed,
And he very briskly replied,
De French and de Dutch,
Dat love her so much,
Will take Care dat she shall be supplied.
The Frenchman, Begar,
Will take very good Care,
To lay her so deep she shant rise;
For if once she should,
Dat would be no very good,
If de English should open their Eyes.
The Beadle here ends
The Tale he intends,
And so we march on to the Grave;
But when we come nigh,
There was such an Outcry,
Good Lord, how the People did Rave.
There was Gun-smiths, and Cutlers,
And Founders, and Sutlers,
And Coach-makers a great many,
There was Cobblers, and Tinkers,
Those Honest Ale-drinkers,
And Shoe-makers too more than any.
There was some of all Trades,
Even Rogues, Thieves, and Jades,
All howling and yelping about her,
Such throwing away Snot,
Drivel, Piss, and what not,
That in short I wished my self out, Sir.
Had you been next,
When Mr. Spin-Text
Began to hold forth to the People,
You Would have Swore that the Jar
Had been louder by far,
Than that 'twixt the Change and Bow-Steeple.
And then for the Sound
When they put her in the Ground,
What Mortal was able to bear it?
For my part, I confess,
I got out of the press,
And left those that liked it, to hear it.
But now to conclude,
I think 'twou'd be rude,
Without saying something of the Dame;
In short, we shall miss her,
But you know how it is, Sir,
And let those that deserve't have the Blame.
FINIS.
