AN HEALTH TO CALEDONIA,
To the Tune of Marin's Trumpet Air.
LEt CALEDONIA's Health go round
With Martial Drum and Trumpets Sound,
And that we may with Joy abound
Let each man drink his Bowl.
Confusion to all Villainy,
All Success to our Colony;
Caledonia, Caledonia!
And may all dastard Knaves
Who grumble at their Countrey's Glory,
E're be Damned in future Story,
Hated alike by Whig and Tory,
And live eternal Slaves.
2.
TO all dare boldly hold their Faces,
Spite of Pensions and of Places,
Spite of Threatening and Disgraces:
Will never bow nor bend.
To all who will themselves oppose
Against Foreign and Domestic Foes,
Caledonia, Caledonia!
As worthy Patriots.
May those who follow other Measures
Either Greatness or rich Pleasures:
Be ever balk't of Pelf and Treasures,
Reck'ned Rogues and Sots.
FINIS.
