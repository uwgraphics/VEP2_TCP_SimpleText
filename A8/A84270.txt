An excellent Ballad entitled, the unfortunate Love of a Lancashire Gentleman,
and the hard Fortune of a fair young Bride.
The tune is, Come follow my Love.

Look you faithful Lovers,
on my unhappy state,
See my tears distilling
but powered out too late,
And buy not foolish fancy
at so dear a rate,
Alack for my Love J shall dye.
My Father is a Gentleman,
well known of high degree,
Tender of my wy welfare
evermore was he,
He sought for Reputation,
but all the worse for me,
Alack etc.
There was a proper Maiden
of favor sweet and fair,
To whom in deep affection
I closly did repair,
In heart I dearly loved her
lo thus began my care,
Alack, etc.
For Nature had adorned her
with qualities divine,
Prudent in her actions,
and in behavior fine,
Upon a sweeter Creature
the Sun did never shine,
Alack, etc.
Nothing wanted in her,
but this the grief of all,
Of Birth she was but lowly,
of substance very small;
A simple hired Servant
and subject to each call,
Alack, etc.
Yet she was my pleasure,
my joy and hearts delight;
More rich then any treasure,
more precious in my sight:
At length to one another
our promise we did plight,
Alack for my Love J shall dye.
And thus unto my Father
the thing I did reveal;
Desiring of his favor,
nothing I did conceal,
But he my dear affection
regarded never a deal,
Alack, etc.
Quoth he thou graceless fellow.
thou art my only heir,
And for thy own preferment
have thou so little care?
To marry with a Beggar
that is both poor and bare.
Alack, etc.
I charge thee on my blessing
thou do her sight refrain,
And that into her company
you never come again,
That you should be so married
I take it in disdain.
Alack, etc.
Is there so many Gentlemen
of worshipful degree,
that have most honest Daughters
of beauty fair and free;
And can none but a beggars brat
content and pleasure thee.
Alack, etc.
By God that made all creatures
this vow to thee I make;
If thou do not this beggar
refuse and quite forsake;
From thee thy due Inheritance
I wholly mean to take,
Alack, etc.
These his bitter speeches
did sore torment my mind;
Knowing well how greatly
he was to wrath inclined,
My heart was slain with sorrow
no comfort could I find.
^
Then did I write a Letter
and sent it to my dear;
Wherein my first affection
all changed did appear,
Which from her fair eyes forced
the pearled water clear.
Alack for my Love I shall dye.
For grief unto the Messenger
one word she could not speak,
Those doleful heavy tidings
her gentle heart did break;
Yet sought not by her speeches
on me her heart to wreake.
Alack, etc.
This deed within my conscience,
tormented me full sore,
To think upon the promise
I made her long before;
And for the true performance
how I most deeply swore.
Alack, etc.
I could not be in quiet
till I to her did go,
Who for my sake remained
in deadly care and woe.
And unto her in secret
my full intent to show,
Alack, etc.
My sight rejoiced greatly,
her sad perplexed heart,
From both her eyes on sudden
the trickling tears did start;
And each in others bosom
we breathed out our smart,
Alack, etc.
Unknown unto my Father,
or any friend beside;
Our selves we closly married
she was my only Bride:
Yet still within her service
I caused her to abide.
Alack, etc.
But never had two Lovers
more sorrow care and grief,
No means in our extremity
we found for our relief;
And now what further happened
here follows in brief
^
The Second Part,
To the same tune.
NOw you loyal Lovers
attend unto the rest,
See by secret marriage
how sore I am oprest.
For why my full misfortune
herein shall be expressed.
Alack for my Love I must dye.
My Father came unto me
upon a certain day,
And with a merry countenance,
these words to me did say.
My son quoth he come hither,
and mark what I shall say.
Alack, etc.
Seeing you are disposed
to lead a wedded life,
I have unto thy credit
provided thee a Wife;
Where thou may live delightful
without all care and strife.
Alack, etc.
Master Senock's Daughter
most beautiful and wise,
Three hundred pound her portion
may well thy mind suffice:
And by her friends and kindred
thou may to credit rise.
Alack, etc.
This is my Son undoubted
a match for thee most meet,
She is a proper Maiden
most delicate and sweet.
Go woo her then and win her
I should rejoice to see it.
Alack, etc.
Her friends and I have talked,
and thereon have agreed,
Then be not thou abashed
but presently proceed.
Thou shall be entertained
and have no doubt to speed.
Alack, etc.
O pardon me dear Father
with bashful looks he said,
To enter into marriage
I sorely am afraid.
A single life is lovely
therein my mind is staid.
Alack, etc.
When he heard my speeches
his anger did arise,
He drove me from his presence,
my sight he did despise.
And straight to disinherit me
all means he did devise.
Alack, etc.
When I my self perceived
in this ill case to stand,
Most lewdly I consented
unto his fond demand.
And married with the other
and all to save my Land.
Alack, etc.
And at this hapless marriage,
great cost my friends did keep.
They spared not their poultry,
their Oxen nor their sheep.
Whilst joyfully they dances
I did in corners weep.
Alack, etc.
My conscience was tormented
which did my joys deprive,
Yet for to hide my sorrow
my thoughts did always strive,
Quoth I what shame will it be
to have two wives alive.
Alack, etc.
O my sweetest Margaret,
I did in sorrow say,
Thou know not in thy service
of this my marriage day;
Though here my body rests
with thee my heart does stay.
Alack, etc.
And my meditation
came in my lovely Bride,
With chains and Jewels trimmed
and silken Rebes beside,
Saying why does my true Love,
so sadly here abide.
Alack, etc.
Yea twenty lovely kisses
she did on me bestow,
And forth abroad a walking
this lovely Maid did go,
Yea arm in arm most frindly,
with me that was her foe.
Alack, etc.
But when that I had brought her
where no body was near,
I embraced her most falsely,
with a most feigned cheer,
Unto the heart I stabbed
this Maiden fair and clear.
Alack, etc.
My self in woeful manner
I wounded with a knife,
And laid my self down by her
by this my married Wife:
And said that Thieves to rob us
had wrought this deadly strife.
Alack, etc.
Great wailing and great sorrow
was then upon each side,
In woeful sor^ they buried
this fair and comely Bride.
And my dissimulation
in this was quickly tried:
Alack, etc.
And for this cruel murder
to death that I am brought,
For this my aged Father
did end his days in thought,
My Margaret at these tidings
her own destruction wrought.
Alack, etc.
Lo here the doleful peril
blind fancy brought me in,
And mark what care and sorrow
forced marriage does bring:
All men by me be warned,
and Lord forgive my sin.
Alack, etc.
FINIS.
