Die Veneris 5. Junii 1646.
AN ORDINANCE OF THE LORDS and COMMONS Assembled in PARLIAMENT.
THe Lords and Commons in Parliament, holding their former resolution, That all
notorious and scandalous Offenders shall be kept from the Sacrament, have thought
fit to make a further addition to the scandalous Offenses formerly enumerated,
for which men shall be kept from the Sacrament; and least the stay of the
enumeration, and the not naming of Commssioners to judge of Cases not
enumerated, should hinder the putting in execution the Presbyterian Government
already established: They have thought fit, that in regard that diverse persons
fit to be Commissioners, according to the last Ordinance of 14 Martii 1645. by
reason of the present Distractions, are absent from their habitations, and so
cannot do the service therein, which otherwise they might do: They do
therefore Ordain, that in stead and place of Commissioners in the said
Ordinance,

Or any nine of them shall be a Committee of Lords and Commons, to adjudge and
determine scandalous offenses not formerly enumerated, and the Elderships shall
proceed in the Examinations of such scandalous offenses according to the
causions and restrictions mentioned in the Ordinance of the twentieth of
October, 1645. And the said Committee shall have such power, and shall proceed
in such sort as is hereafter mentioned.

If any notorious and scandalous offense not formerly enumerated be committed
by any within any Eldership, and so after full proof shall be found before the
Eldership, who shall have power to examine Proofs and Witnesses on both sides,
in case both the Eldership and the party complained of do agree, the Proofs and
Examinations to be duly taken, the said Eldership shall forthwith certify the
said Offense, with the Proofs, to the said Committee of Parliament, who shall
with all convenient speed determine and adjudge the same; But in case the party
accused shall find himself grieved, either by the not examination or undue
examination of Witnesses, or mis-entring of the Depositions, in such case he
shall forthwith declare the same to the Eldership, who shall relieve him if
there be cause, which if they shall not do, then the three Justices of Peace
next to the Parish whereof the party complained of is a Member, or any two of
them, not being of the same Eldership before whom the Complaint lies, shall
have power, and are hereby enabled and required forthwith to examine upon Oath
the said Witnesses that were not examined, or were mis-examined, or whose
Depositions were misentred, and with all convenient speed retume the
Examination to the said Committee of Parliament: And in case the said Justices,
or any two of them, do not finish their Examination, within six days after the
Cause shall be presented to them, the Party shall abstain until they have
finished and certified their Examinations; And the said Committee upon hearing
the whole matter from the Eldership and Justices, or either of them, shall
adjudge whether the same be a notorious and scandalous offense, and so proved
or no. And in case the said Committee shall not adjudge and determine the Case
within fourteen days after the receipt of the Certificate to them made, the
party against whom the said Certificate shall be made, shall abstain from the
Sacrament, until the Committee shall determine the same, unless in the mean
time the party shall show his repentance for the said offense, and thereof give
satisfaction to the Eldership; And if the said Committee shall adjudge the same
not to be a scandalous Offense, or not well proved, the said party shall be
admitted to the Sacrament; and if they shall adjudge the same to be a
scandalous Offense, and so proved, he shall not be admitted to the Sacrament
until he shall have testified his repentance to the Eldership.

And be it further Ordained, That the Eldership shall either give personal
notice to the Party complained of before them, or else leave notice in writing
at his dwelling place, of the time and place when and where they will examine
Witnesses against him, and also of the time that they will make their
Certificate to the Committee of Parliament. And in case information shall be
given to the Eldership of a notorious and scandalous offense committed by any
within their Eldership, they shall forthwith proceed to the Examinat on
thereof; And if they cannot finish their Examination till the week before the
Sacrament, and they shall then find by sufficient proof that he has committed
a notorious and scandalous Offense, and yet they cannot certify the same
before the Sacrament, it being to be administered within a week after, in such
case the party shall abstain from the Sacrament for the next time only,
unless the Committee of Parliament, to whom the same is to be certified, shall
adjudge the same a notorious and scandalous offense, and so proved; for which
he ought to be kept from the Sacrament: and in such case, upon the testifying
of his repentance to the Eldership, he shall be again restored to the
Sacrament, and not before.

And be it further Ordained, If any shall find themselves agrieved with the
judgment against him given by the said Committee, they shall appeal from
thence to both Houses of Parliament, if they see cause.

And be it Ordained, That the Committee to whom the said Certificate shall be
made, as aforesaid, shall report to both Houses the said several Cases to them
certified, and their judgments thereupon, that so the Offenses not yet
enumerated may be added to the enumeration, in case the Houses shall so think
sit, and in their Reports they shall take care that they first report those
Certificates and their opinions thereupon, wherein they at any time shall
differ from the Eldership.

And be it further Ordained, That this Ordinance shall continue for the space
of three years, and no longer, unless both Houses think fit to continue it.
