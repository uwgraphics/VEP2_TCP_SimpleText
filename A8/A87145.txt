The Grand Design, OR A discovery of that form of slavery intended, and in
part brought upon the free People of England.
IN all Ages public pretenses have been made use of, for the advantaging and
securing of particular interests: Not to trace the footsteps of our Ancestors,
I shall come a little nearer, and bring to memory only the actings of a great
party in our present Parliament, and some, yea most members in power in the
Army, for the proving my Assertion.

And now O ye free Commons of England, remember, at the beginning of this
Parliament, what public pretenses were made use of to unite your affections
in the management of their then designed undertakings? Was there any visible
suffrage, or indeed supposed grievance, depending as a consequent upon the
King, and his Parties deportment, that was not laid down, and de-painted in the
most lively colors; to the end that the actors and contrivers might appear
odious; and the discoverers, and then opposers, famous; persons deserving both
the love and assistance of that People, which they seemingly pretended to
deliver from such their then declared pressures and grievances,

At the beginning of this Parliament the whole Representative declared against
those illegal practices of the King and his Council, touching Pattens,
Monopolies, illegal Taxes, as Ship Money, and the like, to the end they might
the better catch the affections of the People, that groaned under those
unsupportable burdens: But it may be remembered, that after those Declarations
had netled the Royal party therein concerned; and that self-interest began to
run a contest with public concernments; how soon (although before we had a
full Parliament declaring) had we an empty House owning or vindicating the
justice of those (...) which they had before declared to be legal, and
prosecuting the contrivers and abetters of those things which were (as they had
declared) illegal, nay rather how soon had we a great party (swaid by honor
and interest) that (contrary to their own Declarations) did join in the
maintenance of those things, which they had before so egerly declared against;
viz. the now Lord Hop^on, the Lord Capell, Sir Edward Deering, and many others
of the Representative or Parliament: Which acting and dissenting of theirs, how
destructive it proved to the Kingdom since, I leave to all wise men to judge;
but to proceed:

After many persons had declined, and deviated from their first principles
(whereby a bloody War was occasioned) a second party remaining in power, and
plausibly pretending the public safety (having by pretenses of freedom
beguiled the Natition to a belief) took upon them (instead of executing justice
and judgment without partiality, and employing the Law, in a way of safety and
preservation) to oppress the oppressed, and pervert justice, to exercise
power, more then reason, and to make Law subject to their own inordinate wills;
straining their privileges beyond their due limmits, making them altogether
unlimmited: which being observed and discovered by some great men in the Army
(who pretended) as in the field) so in all places) to endeavor the redemption
of the Kingdom from slavery and oppression) a design was carried on in the
Army, and engagements passed thereupon, without, yea, against the Parliamnts
liking; in as much as the Parliament had not (by reason of a malignant party
prevalent therein) done those things which they had formerly sworn to perform,
and were in conscience bound to do, in the discharge of their trust to them by
the free Commons committed, and for as much as there was a design to engage the
Kingdom in another war, and enslave the People of England under an Arbitrary
power; carried on by Mr. Hollis, Sir Philip Stapleton, and others, as was
supposed, and as indeed afterward did manifestly appear: The Army and Council
thereof did agree, and enter into an engagement, (against the Parliaments
liking) to endeavor and employ all their force to break and prevent that
design of raising another Army, and to defend, maintain, and vindicate the
liberties, and Native Birthrights of all the free Commons of England, against
all the endeavors, or opposition that could he made against it. In pursuance
whereof, it was by some persons at L. Genesis Crumwels, he himself being present,
upon monday at night before Whitsunday, 1647. resolved, that for as much as it
was probable that the said Hollis and his Party had a determination privately
to remove the King to some place of strength, or else to set him in the head of
another Army; That therefore Cornet George Joyce, should with as much speed and
secrecy as might be, repair to Oxford, to give instructions for the securing
the Garrison, Magazine and Train, therein, from the said Party then
endeavoring to get the same, and then forthwith to gather such a Party of
Horse as he could conveniently get to his assistance, and either secure the
person of the King from being removed by any other, or if occasion were, to
remove him to some place of better security, for the prevention of the design
of the aforesaid pretended traitorous Party: Which was accordingly done, both
with the knowledge and approbation of L. G. Crumwell, although he afterward
(like a subtle Fox) would not be pleased to take notice of it.

This being done, and the two Politicians, Crumwell and Ireton, finding
themselves completely seated in the affections of the soldiery, having caught
them by their plausible pretenses of Liberty, Freedom. Indemnity, security,
and the like; and being sure likewise (by reason of their many Creatures in the
Army, which they had advanced to places of promotion, and brought into the
Council) being sure I say, to carry any thing that they should propound,
though they might meet with some opposers; they cast about first how to
un-horse that Faction that opposed them; which by a charge of Treason, and
other misdemeanors (which they never yet had leisure to prove, nor ever will)
they in a short time accomplished; which being done they made an essay to do
something which seemed to tend to the establishment of justice, securing the
freedoms of the People, and easing of the burdens of the Kingdom (that they
might the better catch the affections of the People) which when they found to
be abstructed, and that the same party and their adherents were still prevalent
in the House,, and did vote against their proceedings, and by secret
complotments did bring a tumult upon the House, forcing all members that were
not of that party to absent themselves, especially the Speakers, who with many
other members came to the Army for security; which members sitting and assuming
a parliamentary power during the Speakers absence, they declared to be
illegal, and thereupon entered into a farther engagement at Hounslo-heath, to
march up to London, to purge the House of those usurpers of the Parliamentary
Power, and to setle the free Parliament with honor and safety.

In order whereunto the Army marched up to London, and being in a capacity to
perform, what they had undertaken, and declared so necessary, and conducing to
the peace of the Kingdom (by the subtle Sophistry of Crumwell and Ireton) the
General was advised to leave it unto the House to purge it self, which was
accordingly done, and what the effect has been since; and how well the House
has been purged, I leave to all wise men to Judge; they all, or most of them
still remaining therein, and they since owned and declared a true Parliament.

But by the way you may take notice, that as a gratification the House made the
General High Constable of the Tower, and I am sure the L. General lost
nothing by that, for he had an old servant or two to gratify, which he did
suddenly after with places both of profit and concernment; besides, another
Creature of his, Col. Hamond was presently advanced to be Governor of the Isle
of Wight.

But to proceed, Having now got almost what they aimed at (to wit) The Person
of the King; a considerable party in the Parliament; the Militia of the City;
and the name of saving the Kingdom; they then begin to cast about how, to keep
what they have got, and that they find to be done but by two ways: the first,
by closing with the Parliament, in making such Propositions as may please the
King, and thereby link themselves so to the Kings interest and power, that
they may be thereby secured from the just Taxes of the People which they have
so oppressed and betrayed; or else by bringing the Army to the obedience of the
Parliament, that by their power, the Parliament might be strengthened and
enabled to hold both King and Kingdom to hard meat, and at last if the King
would not assent to what they declare to be fit and requisite, then to depose
him, and take the power into their own hands, and if the Kingdom did not
recent or relish the business, then by the power of the Army to quell and curb
them: In order whereunto they sent Propositions to the King, which being not
assented unto by him, it was put to the question, whether they should make any
more addresses; which argues that they had a good mind to throw off the King,
if they could any way keep their power, and secure themselves without him: But
Ireton declares that he could not promise the assistance of the Army in any
such matter; his Father in laws pulses now beating a Lord-like pace, having a
little before kissed the Kings hand, and therefore since they are not likely to
secure their power without him, they will by him; and to that end the Army must
be taught a new lesson, and whereas before, freedom, security, the purging of
the House, a period set to the Parliament, and the like, was the only theme;
now only security for Arreares, a little pay, etc. must be all that the Army
desires, and to what end think you, but that they might appear seekers of
themselves, and so by degrees be lost in the affections of the People; thus
have they in a full careere posted from the Saving, to the Enslaving the
Kingdom: But by the way they met with a rub, for notwithstanding that, they
thought they had made all sure, yet so it pleased God to order and dispose
things, that their design was made manifest, and some men of upright hearts,
were carried out in the seeking of justice, and preventing the enslaving of the
Nation, and in order thereunto, did several times, not only oppose all their
enslaving practices, but also offer unto them in open Council, some foundations
of common freedom, absolutely necessary to be insisted on, for the re-estating
of the free Commoners of England in their ancient birthrights; which they, the
said Designers, (to wit) Crumwell and Ireton; and the rest of that rayalized
Faction could by no means relish; neither would their high aims ever admit
them to debate the justness thereof; it being altogether cross to the Pias of
their Ambition: But contrarily they rayled and reviled against those, which
either propounded or owned any such matter, branding them with the name of
dividers of the Army, factious persons, and the like: And being fearful that
after all their labor they should now be frustrated of their expectations, and
by some underhand dealing be deprived of the darling of their hopes, the King,
there must be a pretended design against the Kings person, discovered by L. G.
Crumwell to his Cozen Whaley, and immediately after, (the Guards being first
doubled) there must be a pretended escape of the King to avoid that pretended
danger; but by the way remember, the King affirms he had withdrawn his promise
made to Col. Whaley, long before this pretended discovery, which was in order
to his departure at that time determined without question, and the other but a
pretense made use of to color the business.

It may be remembered that these manner of pretenses are no new things; for when
the King first discerted the Parliament, the pretense was Tumults, and the
danger of his Person; and if you would know what those tumults were, they were
no other but the approaches of his oppressed Subjects, with cries for justice,
which he unjustly denied both his Parliament and People which because he would
not grant, he absented himself, and made the danger of his Person by those
tumults as he called them, the ground of his departure; although it be
notoriously apparent, that he was then privately providing to make war with
his Parliament and People, and in order thereunto, was sending the jewels of
the Crown to purchase Arms in Holland for the managing of the design aforesaid.

Which acting and pretenses then being compared with his present acting in
relation to his departure from Hampton Court, and the now pretended cause
thereof, will plainly appear to be of the same stamp with the former; and in
deed no other but a design, not only to make odious, but also if advantage be
offered, to cut off, and destroy all the godly persons in the Kingdom, that
shall but in the least endeavor to oppose the exercise of his, and their
Prerogative enslaving tirannicall practices, in the securing of the Peoples
just Rights and Freedoms.

But if you shall consider further, whether must the King fly, or rather be
carried, to avoid the pretended danger, but to Hammond at the Isle of Wight,
one of Crumwels own creatures, there to remain, until such time as
Propositions can be made ready suitable to the Kings desire, and an Act be
passed for the Parliaments indemnity; and then O you poor betrayed Commons,
where will you obtain justice or security, when your Trustees that pretended to
deliver you, shall have thus to advance themselves, betrayed you.

And now if you shall desire a reason why these men should now at last derogate
from their former pretended Principles; and should not now, as heretofore,
endeavor to secure the Peoples just freedoms.

I answer; the Parliament, (or at least a great part of them) are now brought
to such an exigency, that they cannot act otherwise with security to themselves.

It is easy to demonstrate unto the world, that many of their actions have
not, neither can they be warranted by Law, especially their Arbitrary and
illegal sommoning, and committing persons (contrary to Law) which all knowing
men are resolved for the future to protest against, and oppose, maugre the
power of all that shall endeavor the execution or justification of those
unjust and tyrannical practices:) And likewise, that by their continued, and
redoubled oppressions brought upon the Kingdom, they have not only lost the
friendship of the People, but in a great measure purchased their enmity; so
that now their condition is such, that either they must close with the King,
whose interest in the People is now greater then theirs, having got what they
have lost) that so, what they cannot promise themselves by their own power,
they can assure themselves by his, (who without doubt has so much policy as to
promise both security and advancement to a part, that he may the easilyer get
into a capacity of enslaving the whole.

To be a little plainer; It cannot be immagined improbable, that the Parliament
having lost the love of the People, doubting the assistance of the Army, and
wanting means (though without question they have wills) to enable them to throw
off the King, and by force to maintain their actions legal; I say, can it by
any that have sense or reason be imagined, that they will not to secure
themselves from the taxes of the People, the lash of the Law, and Levelling, as
they term it; that is, from being made (as all other Subjects) accountable to
the Law, and People for all their actions) take any advantage or opportunity?
And what better advantage can they have, then to join with the King? that by
assenting unto his desires, they may engratiate themselves into his favor, and
wrapping themselves up in his Mantle of tirannicall Royalty, and Protection, in
their own honor and security, leave all the free Commons of England, (by them
animated, authorized, nay enforced to fight against, and subdue him) exposed to
the exasperated rage of a conquered King, and incensed Party, who will not
fail, being once in power, to exalt themselves in, and by the ruin of their
opposers; and like legitimate Imps of their Tyrant-exalter, Lord it over the
Kingdom.

And if you shall ask, wherein Crumwell, Ireton, and the rest of that Faction,
are concerned in the Parliaments actions; I Answer, they are Parliament men,
and so bound up in the Parliaments actings; and indeed so involved in the
Parliaments interest, (joined to their own ends) that I can think it no other
then a difficult matter, for them to deny themselves in this Particular; Honor
and profit being very potent allurements in these our self-loving days.

It is observable that these two Politicians Crumwell, and Ireton, at first
were eager against all persons that visibly opposed them in the Parliament, but
would never yield to the purging of the House,, only they would never be quiet
till they had got out all those that any way opposed them; witness the late
charge against the eleven Members, where (although Crumwel himself confessed
at Colbrooke, that he had nothing against Sir John Mainard; yet he must be put
in among the rest, and only because he was a busy man against him and his
faction: Having removed them he remains satisfied, until he finds another
party of Pellamites which endeavor to throw him out of the Sadle; and then he
comes in with (I am persuaded) a hearty sorrow, confessing, and praying God to
forgive him, because he had hindered the purging of the House: And why is the
Lieutenant General so penitent think you? but only because he feared they
would be some hinderance to his high aims.

And here I shall insert this Quere, Whether, considering that there are two
Parties acting for particular interest, and each of them endeavoring to bring
in the King, for the advancement of their own party, whether, I say, it be not
probable that the King was removed by design, and enduced by engagement, to
alter his former resolution of not being removed; lest the Pellamites should
have served Crumwell at Hampton, as he served them at Holdenby? For my part if
it were not so, it is to me a Ridle, which none I believe can unfold but honest
Oliver,

But to proceed, It may be demanded, seeing that Crumwell is so active for his
own parties interest, why the other party being as yet most powerful in the
House have not outed him of his power?

I answer, could they but bring the King in upon their own interest, and
thereby secure themselves in the attempt; I am confident they would tread him
and his adherents low enough: and that the Lieutenant General knows well;
otherwise Hammond had never been Lord Chamberlain; nor the King removed to the
Isle of Wight; though I believe he never dreamt of the consequences that have
happened, and and are like to succeed thereupon; that by the way; but to
proceed, the King being gone, the City distasting them, or indeed overawed,
not daring by reason of their own divisions, to appear with, or for them; the
Country wearied, and rather enclinable to endeavor the dissolution of their
power, then any way to assist them in the maintenance or support thereof; and
which is worst of all, the Army, (which should by their power make their
commands authentic) utterly rejecting their authority, and rendering them a
traiterous Party, and persons endeavoring the destruction of the just rights
and freedoms of the People; these things being duly considered, you may
plainly see, that it is more for fear, then favor, that they close with him,
he being both politic and powerful, by reason of his adherents in the House,
and creatures in the Army, in respect of which also they could not make use of
a fitter instrument, to draw the Army to their assistance, if it might be; for
the Father and the Son, with the rest of their Family, from generation to
generation, have the command of half the Army, all which having received their
promotion and Principle from Crumwell, and looking still to rise with him, will
not move a foot beyond his instruction, nor as near as they can, fall short of
it; and as the King is his Idol, so he is theirs, hanging altogether in the
executing what their own honor and interest dictates unto them.

It is a commendable thing in the Lieutenant General to advance his kindred,
and servants, so it be done by good ways, and for just ends; not to advance
lawless ambition, and strengthen irregular attempts, if so; he may chance in
the midst of his Golden hopes meet with Buckinghams Fate, or Straffords doom,
and in stead of honor inherit infamy.

Thus having in some measure discovered unto you their actings in relation to
the betraying the free People of England to an Arbitrary power, contrary to the
Protestations of Parliament, and engagements of the Army.

I will now, in opposition to this their practice, lay you down the heads of
that foundation of freedom prop^unded, and by them opposed, and to the
Kingdom rendered odious, under the notion of Parity, Community, Levelling,
destroying Magistracy, and the like, to the end that you may plainly judge
betwixt us and them, and see who they be that indeed labor to invest you with
your just rights and liberties.

The Agreement:
1. That the People of England being at this day very unequally distributed by
Counties, Cities and Boroughs, for the Election of their Deputies in
Parliament, ought to be more indifferrently proportioned according to the
number of the Inhabitants.

That is, for as much as by the late costomes of this Nation, there were but
two persons chosen as Representatives for each County, and those by the consent
and approbation of persons of such a rank, quality, and condition, as
freeholders, etc. which persons chosen as Representatives have commonly been
such as were in some measure linckt in, or related to, the prerogative of the
King, either by promotions received or expected; and likewise for as much as
the persons chosing are commonly more swaid by favor then reason in their
choice, being Tenants either to the persons chosen, or their friends; which
has been one main reason that the lost liberties of the Kingdom have been
from time to time no better vindicated and preserved; That therefore from
henceforth their might be persons chosen for Representatives for every County,
proportioable to the number of Inhabitants in each County, and that not by
freeholdolders only, but by the voluntary assent of all men that are not
servants or Beggars, it being pure equity, that as all persons are bound to
yield obedience to the decrees of the Representative or Parliament, so they
should have a voice in the electing their Representatives, or Members of
Parliament.

2. That to prevent the many inconveniences apparently arising from the long
continuance of those persons in authority, this present Parliament be
dissolved, etc.

That is, for as much as the long continuance of the Power of Parliament men
proves very destructive to the liberty of the People, and occasioneth their
falling into parties and factions, and gives them great countenance in the
exercising of an arbitrary power: that therefore they be continued but for a
short time, and that during that time they may remain accountable to those that
chose and entrusted them.

And for that clause in the agreement, to wit, That in all Laws made or to be
made, every person may be bound alike, and that no Tenure, Estate, Charter,
Design, birth or place; do confer any exemption from the ordinary course of
legal proceedings whereunto others are subjected, which they make the ground
of aspersing the prosecutors thereof with the name of Levellers and pulling
down Magistracy; it is indeed no other but this, That whereas now several
persons are by an usurped power exalted above the Law, and protected from due
process at Law, (viz) Lords as Peers, allhough legally indebted, may not be
touched with an arrest, nor be made subject to the censure of the Law; whereby
they have made little conscience when they have got men's estates in their
hands, to return the same, but have stood upon their Prerogative and thereby
been protected, to the utter ruin and undoing of many of the free people of
England.

And likewise whereas not only the persons but habitations of such Persons are
made sanctuaries for persons indebted; that these things might be for the
future removed, and both persons and places put under the power of the Law,;
and this is the whole sum of that great design of Levelling you hear so much
of.

For all other matters I refer you to the Agreement it self, which being
seriously and impartially scanned, I am confident will give any man not swaid
with interest or prejudice, sufficient satisfaction; and I doubt not, (maugre
the malice and opposition of all sorts of men) will ere long appear to be
indeed that which ultimately conduces to the freedom and security bothof the
Magistracy (if settled in its right orb) and all other the now oppressed and
almost enslaved Commons of England.

Quere.
Whether it be not more then probable that the increasing the heavy burdens of
the Kingdom by taxations from the Parliament and free quarter from the Army,
whether I say, may it not be done by design, and on purpose to weary out the
People, that they may thereby be made willing to accept of peace on any
terms?
