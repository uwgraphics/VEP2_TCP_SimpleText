TRUTHS DEFENSE AGAINST LIES.
In a brief Answer to a Book, entitled the Worcestershire Petition defended;
set forth by one (of Englands blind guides) who calls himself a Minister of
Christ, yet pleads altogether, that the Friars, Abbots, Bishops, Deans and
Chapters Lands, which the Papists set forth to maintain their Idolatrous
Worship, are of Divine right and institution, and were given to the maintaining
of the Church of England, which he calls the Church of Christ, and complains
of the sin of Sacrilege, against those who have, or shall take any of the
aforesaid Lands or Tithes, from the Clergy, which he calls the Church, etc.
THou Fowler, who snares for others made, art in them found fast thy self;
and for thy lies art cas^ into the pit, from whence thou shall never rise,
until thou be made to cry out against them, and own thy own condemnation, and
there wait, until all thy lies be cast forth of thee, who art with the light,
which Christ has enlightened his Children withal, seen to be one of Satan's
Ministers, transformed into the Ministers of Christ's likeness, and yet thy
mouth full of lies: And begins in thy first answer to the first Query, where
thou say, All the Ministers in England, whom that Petition does mention, are
given to the Church, for the perfecting of the Saints, etc. and yet thou say;
But it does not follow, that the Ministers of this Age, must bring the Saints
to perfection. Here thou utterest forth thy lies and confusion, and art for
condemnation with the light; for if thou with thy Brethren be given to perfect
the Saints, (as thou say) and further (as thou say) the Saints cannot be
made perfect by you in this age: then you accomplish not the work whereunto you
are sent, so are found unfaithful and unprofitable Servants, and must give an
account of your Stewardship, and out of your own mouths be condemned, and for
your unfaithfulness be cast out of your service.

2. Thou say, Perfection will be at Christ's second coming, and your
Resurrection, when soul and body shall be joined in felicity: here thou
utterest forth thy folly, and confesses thy ignorance in the knowledge of
Christ's coming in spirit in thy flesh, and of thy Resurrection and holiness in
Christ, showing thy self to be dead, and in the grave of sin, unraised from
corruption, not having put on Christ, where no imperfection is, and yet dare
call thy self a Minister of Jesus Christ. Oh blush for shame, thou that hates
to be reformed, (and thy Brethren) who have a Whores forehead, and sits in the
highwayes, and corners of streets in the twigh-light, and night of your
iniquities, to intise the ignorant and foolish ones, to commit adultery with
you, and to act fornication with strange lovers, and all are strangers to God,
and strangers from the Covenant of grace, and are gone from the Lord, the true
lover; and from the light: and into the night, and darkness leads where you all
dwell and have your portion.

3. Thou says, You cheerfully accept of Christ's ways, and yet says, you know
not what it is; for he never covenanted with you, as thou says, you never
capitulated with him; but what he offers, you shall be sure of, in the life to
come: here thou shows thy self ignorant of eternal life, and art without faith;
for he that believes in Christ, has everlasting life dwelling in him, Jo.
6.47. and if thou had everlasting life dwelling in thee, what other life
would be desired, or what life would be wished for, more than life eternal; but
thou and all who here live not in the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, are
without God and Christ, and lasting joy and happiness: and are in darkness,
death and hell, shut up as thou plainly declares thy self to be, and have
nothing to do to talk of God or Christ, or Scripture; for from them art thou
shut out, and from thee they are locked and sealed up: the Gulf is betwixt you,
and woe is thy portion, and all they who are joined to thee, whilst you live
there; for under the wrath of God you are, and are accursed from off the earth,
which fruit to God does bring forth, with your Father Cain, and you vagabonds,
strangers, wandering from God, and from the light of God, and are afraid of
destruction by every one, who finds you out, as thou expresses in thy 11th
Query, saying, If the public maintenance be taken away, the Ministry will not
continue long, and so thou would tie (as thou call it) Gods Ministry to
depend on an outward public means, and here thou art a blasphemer, and knows
not the Ministry of Gods spirit, and art for condemnation by the Ministry of
the spirit, and all such liars and blasphemers as thou art, who go about,
either by speaking or printing to deceive the world, and to cast aspersions on
the sure truth, and draw poor Creatures from the light of God within them, to
follow your and their own imaginations in a voluntary humility, and
will worship preaching and hearing for Doctrines, the precepts of men, crying
out against all, who speak forth the living Oracles of God calling them
Heretics and deluders; but let all who desire to know the truth, as it is in
Christ Jesus, seriously consider, whether we who direct to walk by the true
light, the spirit of truth in every ones measure, and to be guided by it; and
to do as the true anointing teaches them: or thou and thy Companions, who draw
from the light to observe outward forms; be the deceivers and seducers. All
that thou and thy fellows, in all your writings against truth, and in all your
answers to any thing propounded, is but to gull the people of the Nation, and
to persuade them, that God has left you only as teachers of them, and that
you must have a maintenance from them; and if they will not pay you you cast
out hard words against them, and so if they put not into your mouths, you
prepare war against them, and keep the people under, and you Priests bear
rule by their means, and hold up the filthy and horrible thing, preaching for
hire, and the people love to have it so; but what will you do in the end
thereof, which will come upon you at unawares. And thou who accounts thy
self a Minister of Christ, says, it is sufficient for thee that Christ has
commanded, that men should not muzzle the mouth of the Ox, that treads out
the Corn, and the Labourer is worthy of his hire etc. did thou never yet sow
spiritualls, and therefore can have no right to temporalls; for the seed of God
is hid in thee, the witness lies slain in thy streets; and as thou say in thy
answer to the first Query, Christ is not come to thee the second time to
salvation, and the Resurrection of the dead body (or seed that lies dead) is
not yet come to thee: therefore to the light in thy conscience I speak, how
can thou or any of thy fellows, have a face to plead for temporalls (but that
you are brazened)? when by your own confession you have no spiritualls to
administer to them, or seed of God to sow in them. Thou say, and I have
heard many of thy fellows say, that the new birth is not in this life: but the
Scriptures witness, that the Saints of God had passed from death to life, and
they witnessed their turning from darkness to light, and their translating into
the Kingdom of Christ; Col. 1.10.13, 14. and all who are called to be Saints
now, in the measures witness the same. Thou say, if we so far prevailed, as
to take away the established maintenance of the Ministry, you are resolved to
preach never a Sermon the less: But none who knows thee will believe thee, or
any of thy Generation; for if your mouths be not filled, you will not, nor
cannot bark; for your barking consists in the bit, as in Isa. 56.10, 11. and
as thou thy self says in thy 11th. Query of thy Book that if the public
maintenance be taken away, there is but little likelihood of a Ministry, longer
her: To thy face, thy lies are laid open, as all that read in thy book may see.
Oh shameless and filthy Generation, lying deceiving, and being deceived, how
long will ye resist the power of the holy one, and yet profess your selves to
be the Ministers of Christ! be ashamed and confounded! come down thou Daughter
of Babylon, and sit in the dust, and humble thy self, if it may be the Lord may
take pity upon thee, and spare thee, for the hand of the Lord is stretched out
over Babylon to destroy it, and none shall hold it. And for answer to the rest
of thy Book, all who read it may see, if they be not blind, thy shame and
nakedness laid open by thy self and needs no other to unmask thee, but thy
self: all which strives to prove, that the maintenance which was given to
Friars, Abbots, Bishops, etc. by the Pope, are of divine right and institution,
and was given to the Universities, as thou calls them, and to the rest of the
Churches in England, calling it the Church of Christ. In thy fifth Query,
laying open thy folly to all eyes who will see, thou says, is it not a fearful
hardening to the Papists, when they shall observe that those of their Religion
give to the Church, and that these of ours take it away: so here thou and thy
Church, and the Pope, Rapists, and their Church, are all one by thy own words.
and further thou complains against King Henry for taking away part of the
means, and against this present Power, for taking another part of the Churches
means, And thou say, we will not leave any: All who knows what part Henry
(King in England,) sold of the Churches means, knows what he sold, was of
the Friars and Abbots Lands. O see thy shame and filthiness thou Beast, who
dare so plead for the Popes right, to be thine, and the Church of Englands
right; but all who in the light dwell, sees thee and the Church of England,
that thou pleads for, and the Pope and his partakers to be Members of the body
of Antichrist; and with the breath of Christ and his bright appearance in his
Saints, shall be consumed. Thou likewise sooths up the ignorant and poor
people, and says, the common people may easily be persuaded that the Religion
which teaches men to rob God, (counting it a robbing of God to fell the
Friars, Abbots, Bishops, Deans, and Chapters Lands) is not so good, as that
which teaches them to give to him and his worship. But woe is all your
portions, you cannot escape the hands of the Lord, and though you hide your
selves never so secretly, you are found out, and all your lights and subtle
devices, whereby you lay in weight to deceive the simple, are uncovered, and
with the light are to be condemned. And so Reader, read but the Worcestershire
Petition defended, which this man who calls himself a Minister of Christ, writ
in answer to certain Queries, which was put forth to those, who put forth the
Worcestershire Petition to be answered by them; and thou shall see himself
laying open his own folly and nakedness, and making his own shame to appear:
and lastly, how he confesses, that they (he and his brethren) have been too
much mindful of the things of this life, and preferring their own rights more
then the rights of Jesus Christ: thus out of thy own mouth, are they condemned
with thy brethren: you sloathful Servants, weeping and wailing, shall be your
portion without you speedily repent and turn to the Lord, for with the light
you are found out; and by the light you are condemned, and cast out from God,
and from the fellowship and Communion of the Saints in God, with the
abominable and defiled, to have your portion in the lake, which cannot be
quenched, without you make haste to meet the Lord: Repent therefore and come
out of Babylon; for he who in her abides, shall partake of her plagues, take
warning by one who your soul loves, and desires to see your welfare in God, and
return from Babylon, BEN: NICHOLSON.

And many more unsavory words there is in thy book, which be not worth
mentioning; But this is given forth, that the fool should not boast himself in
his folly, amongst the ignorant; and for the ignorants sake, this book was
written, and sent forth.

FINIS.
