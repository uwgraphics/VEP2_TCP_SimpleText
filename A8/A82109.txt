A DECLARATION OF OLD NICK, Prince of the Air, and all his Infernal crew, to
the inhabitants of the whole world, but chiefly to the QVAKERS of Great Britain
etc
WHereas it is well known to the whole universe, that our dominions extend from
one end of the earth to the other, and that we are the first, and the most
ancient hellish Prince, that ever reigned on the earth, or in the hearts of the
disobedient, and that our Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom of darkness,
horror, burning pain, fire, stinch, and what not, which no honest body can
deny: and seeing there is in this later age, and especially in these South
countries, crept into our dominions, a fallacy, which is got into the hearts of
some sorts of people, which do affirm, and say, they have new lights and
inspirations, wherewith they begin to dazzle, and blind the eyes and minds of
our well affected subjects to our Kingdom, who are pursuing to their utmost
power, and strive to be greatest, and most eminent in the same; these sorts we
say do endeavor to bring them out of our old way of error, blindness,
sedition, treason, murder, and such like, which as far as we can apprehend,
will be to the utter (if it were possible) overthrowing and subversion of us,
and our territories, by their pretended holiness of life; a false zeal, and a
counterfeited Religion, if not timely prevented, we therefore seeing this
danger approaching, and what is like to ensue, do declare, with all our
infernal spirits and angels; that we ever were, are, and still will be utter
enemies to all that is called good, honest piety, love, unity, peace, faith,
obedience, holy life, and christianity, and whatsoever is contrary to our
meaning and excellent nature.

And likewise we do declare, that whosoever shall attempt at any time, to usurp
any power, beyond or above us, whereby to deprive us, or our successors of
their undoubted government, thereby to procure any thing in that kind, to the
advancement of their own interest; they shall suffer the most heavy hand of
vengeance, curse, and burning with fire, and gnashing of teeth (for ever) that
can be imagined or thought on.

And we do declare, that we will do our endeavor, by our own power, to root
out of our Dominions, all ^he rest, (called by them truth) and all that kind
of Religion, which they so much brag and boast of, and pretend to have a right
unto: and we do grant a toleration to all our subjects under our jurisdiction,
to be of any judgment or belief they please; whether it be Atheistical,
Papistical, Tyrannical, Turkish, Heathenish, Mahometical, Antichristian or
Infidel, provided it be not Christianisme or Judaisme.

Item, We declare, that we will mantain and defend all manner of perjury,
blasphemy, murder, sacrilege, witchcraft, conjuring, enchantments, sorcery,
sedition, envy, backbiting, idolatry, adultery, oppression, pride,
drunkenness, covetousness, hypocrisy, and whatever is delightsome to the
will, and satisfying of flesh and blood with all manner of bestiality; that is,
to defile themselves even with beasts, and with their own kin; by having to do
with as many as their corrupt imagination can think upon, with all manner of
ravishments.

Item, We Declare to all our obedient Servants, of what Degree, Condition, Age,
or Sex they be: to Device, Plot, Counterplot, Undermine, Deceive, defraud,
Cousin, Cog, Dissemble, Circumvent, Cony-catcht, Befool, Besot, Baffle, Cheat,
and Delude, any other of what Nation soever they be.

Also we Declare by our Satanical power to use all the means possible to set
whole Kingdoms together by the Ears, to devide the people one against another,
and they against their lawful Governor, even to the Death, be it by Poisoning,
Heading, Killing, or Hanging; and to stir them up to Rebellion, by insinuating
into their minds, all m^^ner of mischief, bloodymindednesse, Revenge,
Quarreling, and Disobedience, to bring all things out of Order and Frame into
confusion; to invent Lies, Forgeries, and to broach our damnable Doctrines, to
fill their Ears and Hearts with Novelties, and Falsehoods, to pretend one thing,
and to mean another to dissemble to the life like as our beloved Son Judas did,
with a Kiss.

Item, We declare to the World, that we would have all in the same as we are,
and have been from the beginning, Liars, Murderers, Perjurers, breakers of
Oaths, Vows, and Covenants, Sabath breakers, to fast for Debate, and Strife, to
feast to superfluity of Gormandising, Surfitings, Gluttony, Drunkenness, even
to excess.

All which we command and charge upon the incurring of our high displeasure of
Everlasting Punishment to those that disobey our real meaning and intention.

Dated at the High Court of Gehenna the bottomless Pit, in the six thousand
year of our Reign, witness our self Great Beelzebub Prince of Darkness, and our
infernal Spirits. Lucifer: Satan: Serpent: Diablus; Mammon: Abadon:
