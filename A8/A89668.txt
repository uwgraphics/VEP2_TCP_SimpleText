TO THE COURTEOUS READER.
BY an Act of Grace, and not by imposition of a new tax, a years rent only,
is now required of such as have transgressed the Laws formerly made for
preventing of Buildings, least any should suffer too much by the rigorous
execution of those Laws, and further it is provided that this years rent be
indifferently proportioned, upon several persons, according to their respective
interests in such Houses, where more then one are concerned; (for where one
only person is concerned, the Fine is quickly set, viz. a years rent,) but
where there are more concerned, though there is still but one years rent
required; yet how this shall be raised, is not so easy to determine, and is
therefore to be proportioned upon the several persons concerned therein,
according to their respective interests, in such manner as the Commissioners
appointed, by his Highness, shall think fit, for which purpose, a certain
value of such Houses must be fixed, and therefore that the Head-Land-lord, (by
whom the transgression was first committed) might pay somewhat a greater
proportion, for his estate in reversion, then the Under-tenants, that do
derive their interests from him, it is determined by his Highness
Commissioners, that the Fee-simple of such Houses shall be valued at 15 years
purchase, and the estates of the Under-tenants, at 8 li. in the Hundred, or 12
years purchase, and a half, or as near that rate, as the condition of their
estates will allow, without imposing too great a proportion upon the
Head-Land-lord, now by this ensuing Table, these fines or parts of rent may be
so computed, as that all the Under-tenants shall be allowed between 7, and 8,
in the Hundred for their purchase money, according as their interest is,
whether for a longer or a shorter time, nevertheless then 7, that so the fine
may fall somewhat more heavily upon the Head-Land-lord, then the Under-tenant,
and never more then 8; least the reversion should fall heavier then is
intended, for the first 20 years, the present worth is here to be computed at
the rate of 8 per Cent. and at the rate of 12 pence less for every fourth year
after, that is a lease of 24 years is computed at the rate of 7 l. 19.. per
Cent. 28 at the rate of 7. 18 s. Cent. and so decreasing 12 pence for every 4
years till you come to 100, for which time the rate is 7 per Cent. per Ann. now
how such Fines or parts of rent may be so computed by this Table, as that the
several Fines, which are proportioned upon him that has the Fee, and upon his
Under-tenants shall in the whole make but one years rent, we will explain by
example, taking it for granted, that the Reader already knows, how the parts
of a pound may be reduced into a Decimal, and the contrary.

1 Question.

There is a House let for 14 l. 10 s. in which A B has 2. 10 s. for 11 years,
C D has 4 l. for 11 years and 6. 10 s. for 24 years after E F has 8 l. for
35 years and the Fee, the question is what every of these estates is worth in
present money, and what each man's Fine or proprrtion of rent is, which he must
pay for his interest.

For answer to this Question: First, compute the present worth of A B in this
manner, the number in the Table answering to 11 years is 7.138963, now then I
say,

If 1 l. Annuity, for 11 years be worth 7.138963 2.5 What is the present worth
of and multiplying the second and third terms together, the product is which is
the present worth required. 17.8474075

Now because CD has 4 l. for 11 years and 6.10 s. for 24 years after, I add
his number of years together, and they make 35, for which time I find the
present worth of 6.10 s. to be 77.1726085, from deducting the present worth of
2.10 s. before found, the remainer is the present worth of 4 l, for 11 years,
and of 6.10 for 24 years after.

The present worth of 6.10 for 35 years is 77.17260 The present worth of 2.10
for 11 years subtract 17.84740 The remainer is the present worth of CD
required. 59.32520

And to find the present worth of OF, who has 8 l. for 35 years, and the Fee
in reversion, I compute the present worth of the whole estate at 15 years
purchase, now the whole rent is 14.10, or 14,5, which being multiplied by 15,
the Fee-simple is worth 217.5, from which deducting the present worth of 6.10
for 35 years 77.17260, which is the present worth of the estates of AB and CD
added together, the remainer is the present worth of OF.

The present worth of 14.10 in Fee 217.50000 The present worth of 6:10 for 35
years subtract 77.17260 The remainer is the present worth of OF, who has 8 l.
for 35 years, and the Fee in reversion of 14.10. 140.32740

Now the present worth of these 3 estates added together, do make the present
worth of the whole rent 14.10 at 15 years purchase.

The present worth of AB 17.84740 The present worth of CD 59.32520 The present
worth of OF 140.32740 The present worth of the Fee 217.50000

Or being reduced into current Money.

l. s. d. The present worth of AB 17 16 11 The present worth of CD 59 06 06 The
present worth of OF 140 06 07 The present worth of the Fee 217 10 00

And the present worth of each man's estate being thus found, the proportional
part of the years rent which every man must pay for his interest, is easily
found also; for the Fee being rated at 15 years purchase, it is apparent that
one pound is the Fine of an estate, that is worth 15 pound in present money,
and hence to discover the Fine of one pound, I say, if 15 give I, what shall 1
l. give? and the answer is 1 shilling, 4 pence, or the 15 part of a pound, and
therefore the Fine of every man's present worth, is 16 pence in the pound; but
because the Fine, for the part of a pound, is in this manner somewhat
troublesome, if you divide the present worth of an estate, by 15, the Quotient
shall be the Fine required.

Example, The present worth of AB 17.84740 being divided by 15, the Quotient is
1.18982 or 1 l. 3 s. 10 d.

And because it is all one to divide by 5 and by 3, or to divide by 15, the
Fine will somewhat more easily be discovered by such division, it being easier
to divide by one digit, then by two. Thus dividing 17.84740 first by 5, the
Quotient is 3.56948, and then dividing this Quotient by 3 the second Quotient
1.18982, is the Fine required as before.

And because it is all one to divide a number by 5, or to multiply the same
number by 2 tenths, therefore if you multiply the present worth by 2 tenths,
and divide the product by 3, the quotient will be the Fine required.

Example, The present worth of AB 17.84740 which being multiplied by 2, is
3.56948 And this product divided by 3 gives in the Quotient as before 1.18962

So that by either of these ways the Fines or parts of rent may be discovered;
And thus,

The Fine which AB must pay is 1.18982 The Fine which CD must pay is 3.95502
The Fine which OF must pay is 9.35516 In all 14.50000

Or in the parts of current Money.

The Fine which AB must pay is 1 03 10 The Fine which CD must pay is 3 19 01
The Fine which OF must pay is 8 07 01 In all 14 10 00

And in this manner, may all other questions of the like nature be resolved, I
shall not therefore trouble thee with any farther Directions, but leave these
such as they are, to be perused and censured, as in thine own judgment they
shall deserve.
