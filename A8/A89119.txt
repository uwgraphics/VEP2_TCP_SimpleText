THE SPOUSE Rejoicing over ANTICHRIST, And triumphing over the DEVIL, In the
Day of the Lord, when God alone shall be EXALTED.

Then sing my Love, then sing my Dear,
Then sing the truth, stand not in fear.
Written in the day and year, when the world is running besides it self, crying
out against truth, in the hearing of truth; this mad world is beside it self,
persecuting those which desire not to meddle with the world: I have found it,
that the world cannot endure light, my experience makes it manifest.

Written by JAMES MICHEL,

Who have been lately accused for blasphemy in the words which is Scripture;
they say that this is blasphemy which the Scripture says, My God, my God is a
consuming fire, and everlasting burning: to this I shall rest to the proceeding
further in the BOOK.

London, Printed, and are to be sold in Cannons street, near London-stone. 1654.

A word to the patient Readers consideration in season, so I shall leave it to
the Reader to judge a charitable judgment to the proceedings after.
A Message to the world, which the world loves not, but rather is reviling
against, the messinger which to me brings glad tidings, and therefore they are
crying out against me, and accusing me for putting times to the songs in my
Book, entitled, the singing of Praises but now the cause of their malice
against me, or persecuting of me, therefore I shall cease from that work of
vanity, as they call it, but rather please a fool in his folly; so at this time
J am taken up in earnest occasion, that time will not permit any longer to give
babes meat, but rather should feed them with milk, and give meat to stronger
men, who is able to bear meat. But at this time J am called upon, or else I
should speak a word or two to the Babes and sucklings of the world, that cry
blasphemy, and know it not; they accuse me for not setting my name to my book
of Songs, which is entitled, the singing of Praises, and many such false
accusations they have raised upon me for blasphemy touching my life, but for my
part. J do not wrong none of them all, neither did I ever blaspheme, never in
my life, but as they do accuse me for not setting my name to my Book of Songs,
I have proved them liars, and I am not ashamed of my name, I set my name to
that book three times, and I would have them understand themselves, nor mistake
me, and so I shall conclude this, which is Written by James Michel.

A vindication of the Verses in this Book.
THat he that rejoices in the Lord, does truly serve the Lord, for the Spouse
when they rejoice it is in the knowledge that they received of the Lord
glorifying the eternal God; for those that glorify the eternal God, do truly
serve God; but the property of meaning, which the Scripture holds forth, that
the true service in the serving of God is the Spouse with jesus Christ,
rejoicing in the Lord to the excellency of the most high God: in that true
sorvice when they serve God royally and truly in the sincerity of the heart,
they may safely rejoice over Antichrist, and may truly and freely triumph over
the Devil, over Death, over Hell, and over Damnation. And this the Spouse and
those that do truly serve the Lord, may rejoice over these things, and say, O
death where is thy sting! O grave where is thy victory! for those that know the
most high God, will, glorify that true God the Lord of beaven and earth, that
mighty King of Israel whose name is glorious; Then you need not stand in fear
of this Devil, Hell, death or damnation, but may sing all honor glory and
praise be given to the eternal God, the Lord of best that is his name, this
Lord knows what my will is, that I may freely say as the spouse says, that I
will serve the Lord before the face of his enemies, and by the love of the
everlasting God and his glorious power, if we truly serve him we may truly
rejoice in him, and sing with him, triumph with him over his enemies in spite
of the Devils face; and in this service of the Lord, as we find his love
manifested to us, so he will speak in us freely above tribulation, singing
peace with him, and living in rest, so we shall according at he makes himself
manifest to us, we shall say, then Devil do thy worst, for we know our God is
an everlasting God, who will bear us on with love, and carry us from all our
enemies that do oppose the Lord Jesus, so we shall freely be carried forth of
trouble, and live in silence for ever, and so I conclude,

JAMES MICHEL,

The SPOUSE rejoicing over Antichrist.

THis is Gods love I see,
Taking away the curse,
but here I Will stay

And purely from the curse.

8.
But now I live with God,
And he does make me to see,

By James Michel,
1.
March on March on,
Says my General in chief,
He is my only dear,
for he is se free
and lives in me,
A casting out all fear.
2.
We march with him,
We march with him.
In Majesty and grace,
if willin be.
he will make us see
The heightness of his face.
3.
And this Jehovah is going on,
With honor and renown,
for he lifts us up
to his spiritual cup,
And so he wears his crown
In true love that he found,
4.
He is the King
The King of Kings,
That King I do see,
the King of rest
and of righteousness
And of true liberty.
5.
For he is above
The Priest and Preachers all,
who thinks themselves so wise,
to fill peoples ears full of din.
And fills men's hearts with lies,
6.
And this cheir snapping
And snarling like,
Like dogs a picking bones,
For if they could se
The Lord Jesus
At him they would throw stones.
7.
And these men sot up tyrant laws,
But I am sure they could not stand,
For they fight against the God of love,
And the Lord of Just command,
His command is truth,
That you shall see in rest.
8.
But we will march, we will march,
Says our General in chief,
We Will march into the field,
When we meet then with our enemies
Sweetly we will win the field.
9.
This which I do tell you now
Mark it very well.
For when that you do sinde true love.
You shall hear who carries away the bell,
10.
Then hearken people, hearken all,
Hearken what I do say,
Then live in rest, and in true peace,
For our Lord God and Jehovah,
Have truly won the day.
Some certain mistakes are past in these verses, concluded as an error for
have, but it may be excused.

A Description of love in true love, declared by James Michel,
1.
When the trumpet sounds his call,
Then death and hell does fall,
For God he is all in all:
Now rejoice, now rejoice.
2.
Rejoice in this thing,
That God our only King.
Salvation he does bring.
He makes me now to sing.
And rejoice, and rejoice.
3.
Then be you not so sad,
For all you are so mad,
Persecuting so bad,
For all that I am glad,
And rejoice, and rejoice,
4
For this will be that happy day,
When the lion with the Lamb does play,
And cast old things away,
And rejoice and rejoice.
5.
For the stopping of the ear.
Is the cause of all fear,
Brings desolation hear,
For God now he is near,
Now rejoice, now rejoice.
6.
Rejoice now with all.
That death and hell do fall,
For God he is all in all,
Now rejoice, now rejoice.
7.
I glorify my King,
Glad tidings he does bring,
For he makes me now to sing,
And rejoice, and rejoice.
8.
When eternal fire do burn,
Then Merchantry shall mourn,
For I do live with one,
And rejoice, and rejoice.
9.
These tidings I do see,
For Christ have set me free,
And he do sing with me,
now rejoice, now rejoice.
10
It comes from above,
When sorrows they do move,
Then we will live in true love,
And rejoice, and rejoice.
11.
The Kingdom is at hand,
Where God will have command,
No rebels there shall stand,
Now rejoice, now rejoice.
12.
At this poor Righteous King.
I see how they do sling,
Because he do make us swim.
And rejoice, and rejoice.
13.
I swim unto my dear,
Who takes away all fear,
And dwell with him so clear,
And rejoice, and rejoice,
14.
I do not swim for hire,
Nor to ly in the mire,
But home we will retire*
15.
It Was not a fleshly King,
That good to us did bring,
Nor never made us sing,
Nor rejoice, nor rejoice.
16
Nor yet the outward State,
Nor Parliament of late,
Did never make things sweet,
To rejoice, to rejoice.
17.
Its this eternal King so neat,
Is with us now complete,
A making all things sweet,
To rejoice, to rejoice,
18
For he is in his throne,
For all the world do frown
His Glory is his own,
Now rejoice, now rejoice.
19.
And to the Priest I call
When Babylon shall fall,
for we will be merry all.
And rejoice, and rejoice.
I tell it to the poor,
I have destroyed the whore,
Now you shall fing for evermore,
And rejoice, and rejoice.
12.
I can no longer forbear*
But tell you what you are,
And this I do declare,
And rejoice. and rejoice,
22.
But your fighting with the poor,
Ambition is the whore,
I will destroy her so sure,
And rejoice, and rejoice.
23.
True love is not so blind,
But to the poor is kind,
And constant is in one mind,
To rejoice, to rejoice,
24.
All Glory now is mine,
Though they will me confine
Because I cast out the swine,
And rejoice, and rejoice:
25.
But this is the swines grace,
To confine true love to one place,
while they do run the race,
And thus laugh God in the face;
Now rejoice. now rejoice.
26.
But he is lust and true,
Making all things so new,
In sweetness here to view,
And rejoice, and rejoice.
27.
Thus heaven and earth is shown,
His Glory now is known,
With true love that is his own,
To rejoice, to rejoice.
28.
I Will be merry and sing,
Sorrows away I Will fling,
Now death have lost her sting,
I Will rejoice, I Will rejoice.
29.
When I am in my throne,
Whose glory that is shown,
Where Is no good nor evil known,
Then rejoice, then rejoice.
30.
This is game of the head,
Sorrows away are fled,
The curse is almost dead,
Now rejoice, now rejoice.
31.
For this is his love to us,
To take away the curse,
Gives us the better for the worse,
Now rejoice, now reio ice.
32.
For he is my loving friend,
with me do not contend,
Makes the stoutest heart to bend,
For he will be the end,
Now rejoice now rejoice.
The Descrptioin of the restoration of love.
Now love 's declared,
And wrath 's abased,

By James Michel,
1.
Our joys now they are come,
And truly they do reign,
It is the Lord Jehovah,
with all his loving train,
He Is with his train so sure.
Which now do make me see,
It is that virgin pure,
The life that lives in me,
2.
His foes are now exalting,
And this makes them so stout,
But he sets most pure upon them,
And gives the whore the rout,
But this which I do tell you,
I speak unto you all,
I see men's Kingdom shaking,
Behold how they do fall.
3.
It is his loving kindeness
Which does appear to me,
That I am in his Kingdom
And purely set free;
Then this is my beloved,
My own beloved dear.
which lives in my bosom
A casting out all fear.
4.
Now fear away is Casted,
Which makes me sing amain,
The freedom now is pure,
To live in peace again,
This is life ete^nal,
That glory we enjoy,
To live in peace and frience
And so to go away
James Michel.
A Vindication or the verses following, whereby no man may be trubled at these
verses, for he that is troubled which these verses knows not what he is troubled
at for men knowing not the things of the Lord Jesus, therefore they are
troubled to hear them, but indeed they need not be troubled at the things o^
God, for mine own part I am not ashamed of them, but am free to declare them as
they are declared in me, for indeed it is thus, men knowing not that the Lord
Ie^us is within them, they use a form of praying for him, which the Scripture
makes manifest and restisies that all men are wicked; and as the Scrio ure
says, that the prayers of the wicked are abomination before the face of the
Lord, for no man can pray righteously, but the prayers of the righteous prevail
much, there is no man righteous, no not one, neither can one do good, but that
good which is done, is done by the righteous man the Lord Jesus, and therefore
I do hold it plainly, that man's prayers cannot prevail any thing of good, for
if a man's prayers were good, then he might prevail much by prayer, but they
vanish away like a shadow, not acting the things which are Royal and truth,
therefore according to these verses following, it is plainly to be seen what
men's prayers are, they are but earth, therefore they need not pray as they do,
for they pray for the Lord Jesus, but they have him already, but in this they
crucify the Lord of life, because they see him not; and this earth exalting
himself something to be, and all men's prayers are not in force not yet in power,
for if they were faithful men, when they pray for rain they should have it, or
if they did pray for water to be turned into wine it should be so, but indeed
their prayers as the Sripture says are abomination before the face of the
Lord, whereby reason proves it is nothing but earth and from whence they came
thither they shall return; from the earth they came, and to the earth they
shall return again: Therefore I declare this unto you, not to read these lines
in wrath, but read them in love. And so I rest in love at this time.

JAMES MICHEL,
1.
It is my joy, and for to see
All those which now are set free,
Those are our people to behold,
And live in Sion to be more bold,
Syon it is the purest throne,
For there the Lord enioys his own.
This is the truth I Will justify
To see what the whore and the world can deny.
6.
For when conceiving in you did begin,
It said that paid was the man of sin,
Then be content and rest on this hour,
For the Lord is working in a light power.
7.
And this the people cannot see,
It Is darkness to them and a mystery,
The Mystery that you shall know,
The light of God will truly show.
8.
And the people they shall see,
How pure all shall be set free;
3.
And to this truth I shall speak still
And live so pure upon Syon hill.
But now these words that I shall say,
For any faith you need not pray.
4.
For all your praving that is vain,
From whence it came it returns again,
Then be you silent for you must,
For all your prayers return to the dust.
5.
Then do hold you that are free,
And for to sing this harmony
For the Mountains know I do declare,
What all below the Lord God are.
Then sit you still upon the true throne,
For Syon once shall be your own.
Dear friends this is to let you understand, the passages I have seen in some
travels, the cruelty of men one toward another, for as J pass^d along the
Highway, J see some gallants habited inclothing l^ke unto Gentlemen, which were
using violence against the poor, taking their estates from them, and this
cruelly abusing of them, and robbing them of that which was free for their use,
and this J see as J travel until I come to my iourneys end, for J have a long
Journey to go, as it is declared by men, for they say it is a great way to
Herven, but still I am traveling on the road till come thither, but when I com
thither, there I shall find ^eare and rest but none I do ^^nde here amongst men,
for they are apt to backbite one another, even as they have done me ^lredy,
indeed if a man peaks what he knows at that they will be troubled, but touch a
gauld horse on the back and indeed he will soon kick, as also these verses that
follow, do touch the thieves and robbers, but many others may seem to take
exception, but they need not do it for any thing I know (but if any man be
troubled any thing which is written in this Book) be my be guilty of the same
action of robbing, but if he be guilty he needs no accuser but his own
conscience, for if he is guilty his conscience will fly in his face, and bare
witness against him, and therefore he may seem to cry out against these veases;
who ever are troubled at them, will make themselves guilty of that fact of
robbing but I should very gladly see men turn from their darkn^ss unto light,
and live in true love, so turn from their wickedness and live.

James Michel.
Who is not ashamed to declare the truth of the passages which he has seen and
do lee, so that men may forsake theit cruelty one toward another, and love one
another in truth and reallity and sincerely by the bottom of his heart, and to
the height and depth of his soul to the utmost thereof.

1.
Glorious one now let us be^ogging,
Every true lover in his own way,
Then give us the spiritual fl^gging
For we will be merry in Vount Sian to day.
2.
Now awake all ye that are Sleepy,
And do hear the voice of the Lord,
For he is a pulling down allyour Temples,
Religion shall be no more your strong Guard.
3
You Tyrants, Tyrants, now in the Kingdom,
This mine eyes so plainly do see,
Then what will be come of all your vain glory
When the poor Captives are trnly set free.
4.
Them^^r^ again turn again
You Thieves and robbers,
A you do plainly appear unto me.
For you are a robbing the poor of this Nation,
And so like Tyrants ra^gn go as you be.
5.
These words that I do say it is in rejoicing
That the Lord Christ have set me so free,
For I my self could not declare it
Not till true reason declared in me.
6.
Then leave of Crueity and all your baseness,
Throw down injustice and east away pride,
Then you shall be married all in sweet communion,
When truth shall be your own glorious Bride.
A Dis^ription of love betwixt God and Christ The spense and the world.
Declared and made manifest at the time and houwhen God pleased to reveal it
in my heart, there one truth cannot be ashamed; this is written in my heart
when the world frowns in madness aginst the Lord Jesus.
By James Michel,
1.
His light is in renown this I do see,
His light is in renown this I do see,
His light is in renown, heresy must go down,
True love shall wear the Crown,
It Is well for me.
2.
Justice now is above, it is so to me,
Justice now is above it is so to me,
Justice now is above, reigning in true love.
None can harbor the dove
Truly but he.
3.
Some saints fit in the throne
With such a grace,
Some saints fit in the throne with such a grace.
Some saints sits in the throne, as if it were their own,
But quickly it may be known in every place.
4.
This true love we would have now for to be,
This true love we would have now for to be,
This true love we would have to be eased from a slave,
But then to live so brave truly with thee.
5.
Tyranny that must sall it does appear,
Tyranny that must fall it does appear,
Tyranny that must fall, we shall be merry all.
And then shall rejoice withal, stand nor in fear.
A declaration declared in truth being not ashamed, who is free, to own every
line in this book, now (...) name suscribed in two words of truth which will
(...) his name manifest, for truth is never ashamed of it (...) This is spoken
by
James Michel.
1.
God is our joy, God is our rest,
God is our King
The prince of peace,
This is Gods love to every one,
He shed his blood for all.
2.
And this by men is not understood.
That all are saved by his blood,
His blood was the sacrifice for sin,
Which men no more should begin.
3.
But Antichrist in his dark power
Is held up by men now each hour,
I will dissolve him with love and peace,
For I live in joy in truth and rest.
4.
I am the King that they should see.
The Lord omnipotent I be,
That I will make them
Truly to see I am with them.
Now here I be.
5.
This King of reason is my life,
He Is taking away envy and strife,
For he goes betwixt the Marrow and the bone
So him and us are all but one.
6.
He is the life he is the breath,
He is the bones he is the earth,
He is the truth I speak withal,
He is that spirit which cannot fall,
He is God, he is all in all.
7.
For this true love have envy cast,
And now it is quite at the loss,
To see who now do bare the Cross,
For now this is true loves own host.
To see how sweetly the curse is crossed.
Dear hearts, I shall let you understand in few words, that the fifth song in
the book, entitled, the singing of praises, was a mistake in the printing, and
therefore I thought good to put it in print again, with some addition to it;
and in the 22 song, in that book of the singing of praises, it was not all
printed, for the printer had le^t out ^alf of it, whereby many at it are
troubled, but let them know what they are troubled at, and so let them sit down
in peace,

James Michel.

Indeed I am caused to write again concerning these verses in this Book which
many already have been troubled at, for I know they are a stumbling block to
the stumbler, which is the world, for indeed they do not go as the world would
have them to go, but as their customs is to have verse to every ones mind,
which these are contrary to most men's minds, but they are chosen out from
their hearts to ly in their way to stumble at, who are ready to cath a fall at
them, because they are not one with them to their apprehension; indeed I do
verily believe, as to them, they are no verse, for those that do not enjoy them
nor live in the same light that they are in, cannot make verse of them but
rather would be troubled at them, and cry out against the Author of them, and
so I shall leave them to serious consideration for a cherritable Judgment of
them and so conclude.

To me this is a true return, out of Egypt into Canaan, out of trouble into
peace, out of darkness into light, and out of hell into heaven, and out of
sorrow into joy, and out of torments into rest, for peace is my salvation,

JAMES MICHEL,

FINIS.
