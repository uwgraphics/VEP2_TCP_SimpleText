A SH RT Instruction in the Art of Navigation.
THe art of Navigation is a Science by which through certain rules you may
steer a Shipp over the Seas from one place to another, and is not improperly
divided into two parts, to wit, into ordinary and extraordinary Navigation.
The ordinary Navigation uses no other Instruments, then the Compass and
sounding Plummet, as principally consisting in experience and practice, in
knowledge of Lands and Corners, how they are different in Points and distances
and are known from the Sea, in depths, shoales qualityes of grounds: the
running and falling of Streams! upon what point the Moon makes high water in
every several place and such like which in part are learned from the
information of experienced Pilots, but most out of our own experience.

Extraordinary Navigation uses besides the foresaid ordinary practice diverse
other private Instruments and rules which must be taken out of Astronomy and
Cosmography. It is therefore needful that every Pilot who will use and
practice th^s extraordinary Navigation, must first of all be well instructed
in the principales of the same Arts, that is, that he know and understand the
proportions and devisions of the Sphere of the World, the motions of the
Heavens, especially the eighth, fourth and first together with the Fabrique of
the Instruments, without which knowledge its impossible to accomplish happily,
great and never before sought out Voyages over the Vast Seas. And seeing that
such knowledge may be attained out of good Instruction we have here set down
in this Tractate for the benefit of young seamen who are desiruns to be Pilots
as clear and plain rules as the shortness hereof could suffer.

The first Point. Of the Sphere and the diverse motions thereof.


A Sphere properly is called a Ball, wholly entire and round, whose
superficies and outside is ever^ where alike distant from its center. By that
World Sphoera Mundi, or Sphere of the World, we understand commonly the whole
Ball of the Heavens with all that is therein contained! and it is divided into
two parts Elementary and Celestial the Elementary part has again 4 parts:
the first is the earth, which with the water as the second makes a complete
Ball upon which we dwell. The third is the Air encompassing the earth and the
fourth is the fire, which according to the opinion of Philosophers contains
the space which is between the Air and the Sphere of the Moon. From these
Elements (which are the beginning of all things) which are always subject to
changes, together with the Warmth of the Heavens arise and perish by a
continual change and alteration of the one into the other, all things which
we see and find upon Earth.

The Celestial part (containing within in its Hollownesse the Elementaryes) is
pure shining, Separate and void of all changes, is divided into 8 Spears or
round Hollow Balls, which are called Heavens whereof the greatest always
contains one the other in manner of a Ball, the seven lowest have, but every
one one Star or Plannet, whereof the first (next the Earth) is the Heaven of
the Moon, the second of Mercury, the third of Venus, the fourth of the Son,
the fifth of Mars, the sixth of Jupiter, the seventh of Saturn, and the eigth
of all the fixed stars. The number of these Heavens are known by their
Courses which we see in them round about the Poles of the Zodiaque. The Moon
runs through her Heaven by her own natural course from West to East in 27
days, 8 hours, Mercury Venus and the Sun theirs in a year. Mars his in two
years, Jupiter his in 12, and Saturn in 30 years; The eighth heaven perfects
its own course, according to the affirmation of Tycho Brahe in 25400 years;
These Heavens are turned about all alike in four and twenty houwres on the
Poles about the Axes of the World by the ninth Heaven, which is called the
Primum Mobile, that is the first mover by which Motion in our sight is caused
Day and Night, and the daily rising and falling of the heavenly lights.

The Second Point, Of the Roundnesse of the Earth.
THat the Earth with the Water together makes a round Globe, appears not
only out of experience very clearly, but also out part of the Shadow of
Earth in the Eclips of the Moon. In whatsoever part of the Heaven the moon is
Eclipsed or touched by the Shadow of the earth, that Shadow seems always
round. If the earth were four square, three corned, or of any other form,
then the Shadow of the moon should be also four square, three cornerd or
some other form! For of what proportion any body is, such also must be the
Shadow thereof. And seeing therefore that the Shadow of the earth is always
and on al sides round, the earth itself must alsoo be necessarilly round.

That the Heaven is round we mark from the eye, but is most clearly
perceived from the Circular motions of the heavenly lights, as of the Son
Moon and Stars.

The Third Point that the Earth is in the middle of the World.


THat the earth stands in the middle of the World, may clearly be
understood by what is hereafter spoken: for if so be that the Globe of the
earth stood not in the middle of the World, but that the heaven was nearer it
on one side, it would come to pass, that the stars in their daily courses
should be nearer on one side of the earth then on the other, and by that
means should appear to our sight to be greater on one side of the earth then
on the other: likewise if that part of the heaven next to the earth were a
boveus, we should then see less then half of the heaven according to
instruction of the first Figure: and on the contrary when that part of the
heaven farthest from us were above us we should then see more then half of
the Heaven according to the Instruction of the second Figure. But standing upon
the flatt side of the Globe we see the Stars as well on the one side as on
the other (in whatsoever part of the Heaven that it is) always of one
greatenesse, and it is found by experience, that we always see the one half
of the Heaven, and the other half is hidden from our eyes, from thence it
appears plainly according to the expression in the third Figure. That the
earth stands in the middle of the World: From thence is likewise to be marked
that the Globe of the earth is no more to be likened by the Heavens then a
point without thickness for if the earth had any thickness in respect of
Heaven, we should (standing upon the earth) by that reason not see half of
the Heaven according to Demonstration of the 4 Figure.

The fourth Point, Of the greatness. of the Earth.
ALthough the Globe of the Earth (as is said) in respect of the extraordinary
wideness of the Heaven is no more then a point, nevertheless in respect of
its self it is a great body, having in its Compass 5400 dutch Miles. And
that is known by this means. If you devide the whole Circkle of the Compass
of the earth into 360 parts or degrees, and we find as well by Navigation as
by measuring of Land that such a Degree or part contains fifteen such Dutch
Miles 360 such part being multiplied by fifteen make out 5400 Duth miles.

The fifth Point, Of the Axis and Poles or Axepoints of the World.
IN the Globe of the World is imagined to be a Line, going from one Point on
the side of the Sphere (as a Diameter through the Center) to another Point
right against it on the other side. That Line is called the Axis and the
outermost-ends thereof, or the foresaid Points, the Poles or Axepoints of the
World, the one toward the North, and is called the Northern Pole and the
other toward the South, called the Southern Pole. Upon whichs Poles it is
imagined, that the Sphere is upon its Axeltree daily turned.

The Demonstrastion.


THE Line A.G.B. in this Figure going from the Point A through the Center G as
a Diameter to the Point B right against it shows the Axel of the World and
the Points A and B the Poles, A to the North the Northern and B to the South
the Southern Poles.

The Sixth Point. Of the Aequinoctiall. Line.
IN the midst of the Heavens every where equally distant from both the Poles,
is imagined a great Circle, dividing the whole Sphere into two equal parts
which is called the Aequinoctial, because when the Son comes to or under
that Cirkle which comes to pass the 21 of March, and the 23 of September,
the day and night are in all places of the Earth of an equal length. The
knowledge of this Cirkle is proffitable above all things in Navigation, to know
thereby how far we go either to the Northwards or Southwards upon Earth;
thereby also is reckoned the time and hour of the day, the Declination of the
Son and Stars, and more other proffitable things.

Demonstration.
IN the foregoing Figure A and B, the Poles of the World C D E F, is the
Equinoctial Line in the midst of the Heaven equally distant from both the
Poles A and B, dividing the whole Sphere A C B E into two equal parts as C A
E the Northern and C B E the Southern part from hence is to be noted: Seeing
that the whole Compass of the Heavens is divided into 360 degrees that the
Poles stand from one another 180 degrees and between the Poles and the
Aequinoctiall remains every where on both sides 90 degrees, This Line is
marked in the Sea-cards with a red Line from east to west through the beginning
of the degrees according as they are reckoned as well toward the North as to
the South.

The Seventh Point, Of the Ecliptique Line.
THE Ecliptique Line lies awry over the Equinoctial deviding it in two points
right over against one another in two equal parts, and is also divided by it
in two equal parts, the one lies between the Equinoctial and the North
Pole, the other between the Equinoctial, and the South Pole! Its greatest
Declination on both sides of the Equinoctaill toward both the Poles is 23
degree 31 minutes, and is divided into twelve equal parts, and to each of them
a several sign applied. The Son goes along this Circkle without ever
going out of it and runs through it with its own natural course every
year once, and even as the Poles of the World stand every where alike distant
from the Equinoctial even so has the Ecliptique alsoo its two Poles every
were alike distant from the same.



Demonstration.
IN this Figure as before is said A B are the Poles of the World C D E F, the
Equinoctial G D H F, the Ecliptique Line cutting and dividing the
Equinoctial, and its self alsoo into two equal parts, in the points D and F
which we call the Equinoctial, the one at D the Spring Equinoctial, the
other at F the Autumn Equinoctial, The one half D H F the northern part
lies between the Equinoctial D E F and A the North Pole at most declined
toward F H 23 degrees and 31 /2 minutes: The other half F G D the Southern
part lies between the Equinoctial F C D, and the South Pole B, likewise at
most declined as C G 23 degrees 31 minutes. The North part is divided into six
signs which we call the Northerly beginning at D with the Kimbug signs
toward the North. Aries, Taurus, Gemini unto H. the point of the farthest
declination. From thence with the descending signs of the North, Cancer, Leo,
Virgo, to the Equinoctial Line in F. the Autumn Equinoctial, the southern
part is also divided into six signs which we call the Southerly beginning at
F with the discending signs toward the South Libra, Virgo, Saggitarius until
G the Point of the sartkest Declination toward the South from thence further
with klimbing signs toward the North Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces as far,
as till you come to the Equinoctial line in the Spring Equinoctial D. The
Sun runs through the three first Northerly signs from the 21 of March new
style to the 21 of June New still the other from the 21 of June to the 23 of
September. The first 3 Southerly signs from the 23 of September to the 23 of
December and the other from the 23 December till the 21 of March again. The
Poles of the Ecliptique are M and N, both of them standing every where alike
distant from the Ecliptique G H, and so far from the Poles of the World A,
and B as the Ecliptique is farthest declining from the Equinoctial at H E and
C G.

The eighth Point. Of the Coluri.
THe Coluri are two Circkles, going Croswayes through both the Poles of the
World, dividing each other into two parts in the Poles, and together with them
the whole Globe Equinoctial Zodiac or Ecliptique and all the Paralels in 4
equal parts, the one going through the Points of the Equinoctial is called
the Colurus of the Equinoctials the other through the Points of the Solstices
the Colures of the Solstices. The Son moving these Circles (through its
yearly course in the Zodiac, devideth the year into four parts) as the
Spring, Summer, Autum and Winter.

Demonstration.
IN the foregoing Figure A F B D is the Colures of the Equinoctials, going
trough D and F the points of the Equinoctial in the beginnings of Aries and
Libra and through the Poles A and B, A C G B, M E H the Colurus of the
Solstices in the beginnings of Cancer and Capricornus where the Ecliptique is
farthest distant from the Equinoctial line through the Poles of the World A
and B, and through the Poles of the Zodiac M and N cutting one another through
crossewayes with right corners in the Poles A and B, and deviding the Zodiaque
or Ecliptique in 4 parts, as D H H F F G, and G D, the first of which the Son
wanders through in the Spring, the second in the Summer the third in the
Autumn, and the fourth in the Winter.

These foresaid Circles of the Sphere are all great Circles that is
compassing the Sphere at the widest deviding the same into two equal parts,
there follow now 4 small Circles which devide the Sphere into unequal parts.

The ninth Point, Concerning the Tropickes and the Artique and Antartique
Circles.
THe Tropiques are two Circles, the one northwards and the other southwards
from the Equinoctial and alike wide with the same which through turning about
of the Sphere from the Points of the Ecliptique are farthest distant from the
Equinoctial, and are placed the one to the North and is called the Tropique of
Cancer, and the other to the South and is called the Tropique of Capricornus.

Circulus Articus the Northern Circkle and Circulus Antarticus the Southern
Circkle are reckoned through the running about off the Sphere from the Poles
off the Ecliptique.



Demonstration.
IN this Figure H I, is the Tropicke of Cancer which through the turning about
of the Sphere is written from the Point H the beginning of Cancer is also so
called, because that the Son coming to that point, farthest from the
Equinoctial toward the North, turns then again through the Crabfish
toward the Equinoctial G K is the Tropique of Capricornus, so caused through
the running about of the Spear from the point G, the beginning of Capricornus
of the Goat and is so called because the Son coming to that point in the
farthest from the Equinoctial toward the South, then turns again through
the Goat toward the Equinoctial, N P, is the Artique Circle and M O the
Antartique Circle they are so called through the running about of the Spear
from the Poles of the Zodiaque N and M. These are equally distant from the
Poles of the World A and B as the Tropique are from the Equinoctial Line, to
wit 23 Degrees and 31 Minutes.

The tenth point. Of the Suns Declination.
THe Suns Declination is its distance from the Equinoctial Line, and that is
two fold toward the North and South.



Demonstration.
THe Suns Declination is caused through his course along the Ecliptique Line
thus. Let A be the northern and B the southern Pole of the World C P E the
Equinoctial G H G the Ecliptique Line. The Son coming in the beginning of
Aries on the 21 of March to D, comes also in the Equinoctial Line, has
besides no Declination neither northwards nor southwards, but going forwards
along the Ecliptique from D to H, and coming to K in the beginning of
Taurus, it shall be distant and declined from the Equinoctial Line toward
the north from I to K. 11 degrees and 30 minutes. Going forwards to H, is then
at most declined from P to H 23 Degrees 31 minutes. From thence following its
course from H to F, comes in the beginning of Libra again to the Line
without Declination. Going forwards from F toward G until M, in the beginning
of Sagitarius, it shall be distant or declined from the Line F E toward the
South from L to M, 20 Degrees 13 minutes. Coming to G it is then at its
farthest declination from E to G toward the south, from thence it runs
again to D to the Equinoctial line, perfecting its course in a year.

The Eleaventh Point. How to find the Sons Declination upon every day in the
year.
THe year of the Son (that is the time wherein the Son goes out of a
certain point in the Ecliptique, and turns again into the same) and is not
just 365 days, but about 5 hours and 49 minutes (that is little less then 6
hours more, wherefore it is that we always add after three years to the
South 4 times 6 hours that is a day to the Month February thereby to count the
year or Revolation of the Son into equal days, therefore every such fourth
year is called the Leap-yeare. If therefore you will then set the Sons
Declination by day tables it is needful to make four sundry tables of four
such following years. The foresaid difference of four Revolutions of the
Son come not equally alike with such four years, being with length of time
so much difference in the Declination that it is needful to renew such Tables
every twenty years.

Now to find the Declination of the Son out of such Tables upon every day of
the year it is needful to know two things, the first in what year you are,
either the Leap-yeare, or in the first second or third year after. The second,
when you know the year which of the Tables you must use thereto.

For the first! devide the year of our Lord 1600 by 4 if the devision comes
even out without remainders, such a year is then a Leape-yeare of 366 days,
but if out of the division any number remains, such remainders show you how
much that such a proposed year is after the Leape-yeare.

The first Example.
I Desire to know what for a year 1644, is leaving the 1600, take and devide
the remaining 44 by 4, that comes even out without remainders for 11 times 4
is 44, and from thence I find that the year 1644, to be a Leape-yeare.

The Second Example.
FOr to know what sort of year 1647. is, leaving the 1600. I divide the 47, by
4, and I find tha^ there rest three for 11 times 4 is 44, take that from 47,
and there remain 3, and from thence I find that the year of 47 is the third
year after Leap year.

To know the same without reckoning, consider this following little Table, the
first Column is of the Leape-yeares the second, third, and sourth Column are
the three years after the Leape-yeares.

Leap year. 1 year. 2 year. 3 year. 1644 1645 1646 1647 1648 1649 1650
1651 1652 1653 1654 1655

The second for to know which Table you must use to every year that stands
demonstrated above each of the following Tables.

The first Example.
IN the second year following the Leap year upon the 20 of May, I desire to
know the Sons Declination! I seek in the Tables the Month of May, in the
second year and there under in the first Collumne of the figures the twentieth
day, I find in the second Collumne 20, 4. That is 20 degrees and 4 minutes, to
be the Sons Declination. And seeing that it is between the 20 of March, and
the 23 of September (that the Son is by northwards of the Line) so comes it to
pass that the Declination is Northerly.

The second Example.
UPon the 12 of February in the Leap year, I desire to know the Sons
declination seek therefore in the Table of Leap years toe Month of February,
and count in the first Collumne to the 12 day, and you find there by it 13
degrees and 14 minutes for the Declination of the Son on that day; seeing
that it is between the 23 of September and 20 of March, that the Son goes
by South the Line, The Declination is then Southerly.

Now follow the Tables of the Sons Declination reckoned properly, upon the
length of the earth or Meridian of Englands Landt-End, because that this length
is used most by our Netherland seamen as well in running, upon the Channel of
the Sea, as along the Coasts of France, Portugal and Spain.

NOTA.
LOok how many degrees and minutes the Line is raised above the Horizon; just
so many degrees and minutes are there between the point right over your head,
called the Zenith and the Pole, and thence it follows, that as many degrees
and minutes as there be between the Zenith and the line, just as many are
there from the Horizon to the Pole; that is to say, so many degrees is the Pole
elevated, therefore when we say we are in such a height, we understand that
we are so many degrees on the north or the southside of the line. This rule
and instruction is universal and common through out the whole World both ih the
north and southside of the line.

An Admonition to the Reader.
IF a man would observe the height of the Sun, it is necessary that he know
how many foot he stands above the water, for the higher a man stand the farther
he is from the Horizon, because that from the eye to the Horizon, is 60
degrees, if we stand waterpas, as they call it; but if he stand higher then
the water, as is said, it will be more then 60 degrees to the Horizon; And to
mend this fault, I have here placed a table, thereby to know whether we stand
high, then the water or no; and how many minutes difference it makes, and also
how much nearer the eye the Cross stands, then adding the min. to that which
the Cross stands below the Zenith, so shall you mend the fault, that is to
say, that you see the cross so many minutes downward, look on the table
following.

Example.
In this height above the earth. feet. minutes. 2 1 4 2 8 3 14 4 20 5 27 6 39 7
53 8 67 9 82 10 100 11 118 12 140 13 16^ 14 180 15

LEt your eye be above the water, suppose 27 feet, that the cross may stand
45 degrees from the Zenith (that is beginning to tell from that end where the
eye is) these 27 feet, being sought in the first rank, or Column of the
Table, and you shall find over against it 6 minutes, so much is the Horizon
below, that which they call the waterpas or the surface of the water, and so
many feet must the cross be thrust downward, so will it fall out 45 degrees 6
minutes, where the Cross ought to be.

Of the vapors and exhalations which the Sun, Moon and Stars, as they are
nearer the Horizon do seem to draw up more, as indeed and truth they are.
EXperience teaches, that the lights of heaven, by how much they are nearer
the Horizon, by so much do they seem to be higher then indeed they are; and
by reason of the fumes and damps, which continually arise and as they are
nearer the Horizon, so much are they more thick, and rising by little and
little; they lessen, and at the least are clean vanished, and as we come
nearer the Pole, the vapoers do more and more increase, and for that cause do
the lights seem to be higher than they are. Yea it is found about the height
of 83 degrees toward the north, that the Sun seems to be 40 minutes
higher than in truth it is, this has that famous Astronomer Ticho Brahe
searched out and written in Denmarck, as you may see in this table.

A Table of the rising of the Sun.
Degrees. Minutes. When the Sun is found to be high. 0 34 higher then indeed
it is. 1 26 2 20 3 15 4 13 7 it seems 10 10 7 15 3 23 1 32

A Table of rising of the Stars.
Degrees. Minutes. When the stars are of the hight 0 30 higher ^han indeed they
are. 1 22 2 15 4 they seem 11 7 8 11 5 15 3

The use of this table will we declare by an example and whatsoever is said of
the rising of the Sun, the same may be said of the Stars.

Example.
LEt the height of the Sun be measured; and found to be 7 degrees above the
Horizon, and in the table of the Sun above written, there are 13 minutes
which the Sun seems to be higher than it is, therefore substract 13
minutes from the 7 degrees, there will remain 6 degrers 47 minutes for the
true height of the Sun.

But if we take the distance of the Sun from the Zenith according to this
example, it would be found to be 83 degrees, and then the 13 min. added to
the 83 degrees the product is 83 degr. 13 min. for the true distance of the
Sun from the Zenith, then if we take 83 degr. 13 min. from 90 degrees there
will remain 6 degr. 47 min. as before, and so will it be in all the other.

The 12. Chapter, Of the length and the breadth of the fixed Stars.
THe Stars of the eigth heaven are called Fixed Stars, because (unlike the
Plannets without motion) they stand always fast and fixed in one fashion and
distance one from the other, and are carried about altogether one with the
other by the Primum Mobile: they are marked according to length and breadth.
Their length is a part of the Ecliptique, contained between two half circles,
going both out of the Poles of the Ecliptique, the one through the spring
Equinoctial, or the beginning of Aries, the other through the Stars
themselves. Their breadth is a Bow of the like half Circle between the
Ecliptique Line and the Stars: That is two fold Northerly and Southerly, the
Northerly which are Northwards from the Ecliptique, and the Southerly which
stand Southward from them.



Demonstration.
LEt the Ecliptique Line be G D H. Let N be the Northern, and M the
Southern Pole thereof: F a certain Star. Let two half Circles be drawn
out of the foresaid Poles, the one N D M through the spring Equinoctial to D.
The other through the Star F deviding the Ecliptique in K: that part of the
Ecliptique D K is the length of such a Star, and the Bow or part of the said
half Circle K F is his breadth toward the North, because that it stands by
North of the Ecliptique.

The 13. Chapter, Concerning the right Ascension and Declination of the fixed
Stars.
THe right Ascension of the Stars is a part of the Equinoctial, contained
between two half circles, going both out of the Poles of the World, the one
through the spring Equinoctial, the other through the Stars. Their
declination, being a bow of the like half circle between the Equinoctial
and the said stars. This is also two fold Northerly that which is by north
the Line, and Southerly which stand by South from it.

Demonstration.
IN the foregoing Figure, let C D E be the Equinoctial line. A the North, and
B the South Pole of the world, F a certain Star; draw two half Circles out
of the foresaid Poles, the one A D B through the Equinoctial or beginning of
Aries, the other through the Star marked with F which devideth the
Equinoctial in L. The part of the Equinoctial L D is the right Ascension of
such a Star and the Bow or part of the same Circle L F. his declination
toward the North, or O I from the Star to I toward the South.

The 14. Chapter, Concerning the change of the declination of the fixed Stars.
EVen as the starry heaven in our sight is driven about every 24 Hours by the
Primum Mobile upon the axepoints or Poles of the world from east to west: so
are these also carried about upon the Poles of the Ecliptique Line once in
25400 years, on the contrary from west to east, even as the Sun once every
year. By which the length of the Stars changes every hundred years 1
degree, and 25 minutes, or else every 20 years 17 minutes: but their breadth
that is the distance from the Ecliptique remains unchangeable always the
same. Through the foresaid change of the length (by length of time) changes
also the declination of the one more and also sooner then of the other. Some
are made less, and some grow bigger. Some of them having Northerly declination
become souther, and some others having southerly declination become on the
contrary northerly.



Demonstration.
LEt C D E be the Equinoctial, A the northern and B the southern Pole of
the World G D H the Ecliptique line N M the Poles thereof G the beginning of
Capricorn. D of Aries and H the end of Gemini or beginning of Cancer, let (as
is before said the Star at F its length be in the Ecliptique to L. its
breadth by north of it at L F its northerly declination is then V F. If then
the foresaid star in many years runs in length from F to L parallel with
D H its breadth rests K T even until the soregoing F L but its declination I
T, is more then V F the first because that it being parallel with D H is more
wended from the Equinoctial line. The star at O whose length let it be in
the Ecliptique to Q and its breadth Q O. has southerly declination P O: but
running in length from O to R pararell with Q X its breadth remains X R even
to Q O but its southerly declination R S is less then O P because that it
being parallel with G D is come nearer the Equinoctial. But if the same
star comes to run in length unto Y its declination shall be Y Z by north
the line. That is spoken of the 6 first signs. In the same manner comes to
pass the contrary part in the other 6 signs and thus. In the same figure let
H be the beginning of Cancer D Libra, and G the end of Sagitarius. If a Star
at T having Northerly declination T I runs in length until F, its
declination F V is less then T I, because it is come nearer the Equinoctial,
then if so be that it runs in length until B, its deelination which was
first northerly shall then be southerly from B to D. Through the foresaid
motions of the eigth Sphere changes also the declination of the Northstarre,
which is every year greater, that is, he departs the longer the more from
the Equinoctial, and comes nearer the Pole, which shall endure to the year
of our Lord 2091, then shall he be nearest and no more then 26 minutes, and a
half distant from it and after that time by little and little shall wend from
it, so that 12700 years afterward it shall stand from the Pole 47 degrees and
56 minutes. How this comes to pass may plainly be conceived out of this
manner of Figure.



Let A be the northern Pole of the world in the middle of the Equinoctial B.
D. F. C: N the Pole of the Ecliptique in the middle of the Ecliptique E D G C,
H the Northstarre, its breadth from the Ecliptique is Q H 66 degrees and 2
minutes, and its distance from the Pole of the Zodiaque N H 23 degrees and 58
minutes, they remain always alike even as the breadth and distance of all
fixed Stars from the Pole of the Zodiaque N H 23 degrees and 58 minutes they
remain always one and the same even as the breadth and distance of all fixed
Stars is from the Zodiaque Pole, as heretofore is said. Its length from the
Spring Equinoctial or beginning of Aries for the year 1625. is C Q 83 degrees
and 24 minutes.

Let there be drawn a Circle out of N the Pole of the Ecliptique, as I L K O
H; whose half Diameter let be N H 23 degrees and 58 minutes even to the
distance of the Northstarre from the Zodiaque Pole, therein is closed the
Northpole of the world at A as being less different from the Zodiaque Pole
then the Northstarre. Upon the like Circle the Northstarre takes his compass
about the Pole of the Zodiaque (even as all the fixed Stars in 25400 years,
its distance from the worlds Pole is for the year 1625 A H 2 degrees 42
minutes and shall in the year of our Lord 2091 be come from H to I being
then nearest to the worlds Pole, and stands no further of then 26 minut. going
forwards from I along to L until K it shall then be distant from the worlds
Pole marked with A K 27 degrees and 56 minutes.

But because the Stars keep not always one kind of declination, we have
for the furtherance of Mariners prepared these two following Tables. The one
shows their declination for the year 1645. And the second for the year
1654. Besides the declination there is adjoined the complement of the
declination that is, how wide they stand from the Pole.

By this table you may find the declination of any of these Stars, in the
years between, provided, that you proportion the difference of the
declination to the difference of the time.

Example.
I desire to know the Declination of the tail of the Lion in the year 1650. I
find in the table of the year 1645. 16. gr. 33 min. and for the year 1655.
16. degrees, 30 min. the min. having as much taken from them as the years, I
find 16 gr. 31 min. and a half, lessening declination.

II. Example.
I desire to know the declination of Aldebaran the eye of the Bull in the year
1650. I find in the year 1645, 15 gr. 48 min. and for the year 1655, 15
degr. 50 minut. the minut. having as much taken from them in proportion as the
years, I find 15 gr. 49. min. increaseing declination.

The 15. Chapter, how you may easily learn to know the fixed Stars and at
what time every one of them comes to the South.
HOw needful and profitable it is for a Seafaring man to have knowledge of
the fixed stars and their use, especially in strange voyages, and far
Navigations, that is more then well known to all experienced and understanding
Steerman: moreover, because we have described in the foregoing chapter the
declination of the fixed stares and their distance from the Pole, we shall
here show you a way and fitting means how you shall easily learn to know them
and that perfectly at all times when as every one of them come in the south or
at their height, and are fitting to be used.

First you must know that the way of the Son in the heaven is immovable with
the fixed Stars with the which it is every day once turned about from east to
west without change, but only that the Son does contrary wise run this
foresaid yearly course from west to east Whereby he in his daily course,
comes so far behind, that he in a whole year goes one course less then
the fixed Stars: and that the fixed Stars turn once more about in a year
then the Sunn, so that they every day come 4 min. sooner to the division, that
comes every week to about half an hour and every month 2 hours, which
that it may the better be understood, we will make it evident by an example
taken from the star called Syrius, or Canis Major the great dog, which
always follows a little after the Image of the Giant Orion and his Girdle,
which is called the three Kings, which appear a little over the great Dog,
it is the greatest and clearest of all the fixed Stars, which for the most
part is known unto all Seafaring men, his declination is Southward from the
Line 16 degrees, and 13 minutes.

And it is south upon the 24 of January new style, at ten of the clock at
night. The 23 of Februaty at 8 of the clock at night. The 28 of March as six of
the clock at night. The 30 of April at four of the clock in the evening. The
30 of May at two of the clock afternoon. The 28 of June at 12, of the clock at
noone, even with the Sun. The 28 of July, at ten of the clock before noone.
The 29 of August at eight of the clock before noone. The 1 of October at six
of the clock in the morning. The 12 of November at four of the clock in the
morning. The 1 of December at two of the clock in the morning. The 28 of
December at 12 of the clock at night.

Whereby every man may easily reckon at what hour and time this Star is
south every day in the year, as well in the day time when you cannot see it,
as in the night when we may see it. And if you desire to know the like
touching all the rest of the fixed Stars upon every day in the year, then
mark what was said before, upon what hour of the day before set down, the
great Dog comes into the South, and by the Tables hereafter following,
touching the declination of the Stars, mark how long time the Starte you seek
for, comes into the South before or after the great Dog, and by that means
you shall find the just and perfect time that you desire.

The 16 Point. The Table of the declination of the fixed Stars; and also an
Instruction of the time in which each of them comes into the south, also how
you shall know them.

minut.

These three Kings stand always and appear a little above the great Dog,
whereby they are easily known.

Here do follow some Stars which show themselves in the North, and therefore
by some men may are caled Northstares.
The Stares of the great Coach or Wagon, very servicable and fit for those
that fail far toward the South; they come in the time here following
specified unto their highest, the hinder wheels come into the North to their
highest after Syrius or the great Dog 4 hour. 12 minutes the most Northern
has his declination from the Equinoctial 63 degrees, 41 minutes, and is
distant from the Pole 26 degrees, 19 minutes; the declination of the
Southermost is 58 degrees, 18 minutes, it is distant from the Pole 31 degr. 42.
minutes.

The Southermost of the forewheeles comes into the North to his highest right
over the Pole 5 hours, 5 min. after the great Dog is past the South; his
declination 55 degr. 42. min. in the Northside of the Line, and is distant from
the Pole 34 degrees, 18 minutes.

The most Northern in the fore wheel follows 23 minut. after, and then
comes to his highest; the declination of it is 59 degrees, 1 minute, and it
stands above the Pole 30 degrees, 59 minutes.

The Horse the next to coach comes to its highest in the North, 6 hours, 8
minutes, after the great Dog is gone through the South; it declineth to the
North 57 degrees, 57 min. is distant from the Pole 32 degr. 3 min.

The middlemost Horse comes half an hour after it to the highest; the
declination of it is 56 degrees, 50 minutes, therefore it stands distant from
the Pole 33 degr. 10 minutes.

The uttermost Horse of the coach comes to the highest 7 hours, 4 minut.
after Syrius is past through the South the declination of it is 51 degr. 9,
minut. it is distant from the Pole 21 degr. 51 minutes.

The middlemost and brightest of the waiters declineth to the north 75 degr. 43
minut. is distant from the Pole 14 degr. 17 minutes.

NOTA.
Touching the north Star her declination, and how it is to be used, with the
watchmen is decliniated in the difcourse following.

The Dragons head is formed as this figure declares, the Star most southerly
is the clearest, and comes to the highest in the north 11 hours and 5 min.
after that Syrius is past the South, the declination 51 degrees 37 minut. in
the north-side of the Line; stands from the Pole 38 degrees 23 minutes.

The Image of Cassiopeia shows it self beneath the Pole in this proportion,
the first Star standing in the Chair, comes into the north to the highest 6
hours, 36 minutes before the great Dog, the declination of it is 57 degrees,
12 minut. to the north, and therefore 38 degrees 48 minutes.

Half an hour after follows the Breast named Schedir, the declination is 54
degrees, 36 minutes, and thus it stands from the pole 75 degrees, 24 minutes.

Fifteen hours after that follows the star that stands in the Hipp, in
declined 58 degreet, 48 minutes, so that it stands from the Pole 31 degr. 12
minutes.

Yet 27 minutes later follows that which is placed in the knee, has its
declination 58 degrees, 21 minut. it is distant from the Pole 31 degrees, 39
minut.

The 17 Point. How to find the hour of the day or of the night.
To find the hour of the day at any hight, will be done most readily and
certainly with such a water compass, as is described in the Chapter of the
ebbing and flowing of the Sea; in the night one may find it by the nightdiall,
as this Figure above describes, which has two rondels; the one moveable, the
other immovable, in the lowest which is immovable are the 12 signs of heaven
placed is also the months and days of the year. On the moveable roundel are
the hours, this turns with the gnomen, whose right side answers to the
middle point where there must be a nail with a hole; through which a man may
see. The use of this night dial is this: We set first the foot to the twelfth
hour on the moveable roundel, and to the day of the year, on the undermost
unmovable roundel, and set the Instruments hight, with the lowest corner of
the foot A B, so that it stand water-pas, in such sort, that a man may see the
North-star through the hole of the nail, turning the dial up and down, so
long till the hinder wheels of the great Wagon come into the dial, which
being so, the gnomen shall show the hour on the moveable roundel. And if in
place of the hinder wheels of the Wagon you take the brightest of the
watchtmen, it will be 4 hour. 15 minut. later, as the dial will show, because
the wheels aforesaid of the great cart go so much before the wayters.

Men may find the hour by the ascension of the Sun and the Stars in this
manner; when we see any Star in the South, whose just ascension is known, and
that we know the true ascension that day, then draw the ascension of the Sun
from the ascension of the Star, the remainder we devide into hours by 15, (for
15 degr. make 1 hour) and this will be the right hour of the time, but if the
ascension of the Sun be more then the Stars, in that cause you shall add 360
degrees to the ascension of the Star, and then to as aforesaid.

I. Example.
On the 10 of April, in the evening, in the south, Ise the heart of the Lion,
whose right ascension is 147 degr. the ascension of the Sun on that day is 19
degr. take those from the ascension of the Star, there remains 128 degrees,
and these divided by 15, I find 8 hours, 8 degrees over plus, and for as much
as 15 degrees make one hour, every degree will make 4 minutes, the 8 degrees
over plus, make 32 minutes of an hour, it will be than at that time 8 hours,
32 minutes from the noone tide.

II Exempel.
ON the 5 of November in the night I find in the south the Star Aldebaran, the
south eye of the Bull, whose right ascension is 64 degrees: the Suns right
ascension on that day 220 degr. which is more then that of Aldebaran, therefore
I add to the ascension of the Srar 360 degrees, it makes 424 degrees, the
Suns right ascension being taken from this, there remains 204 degr. which is
the difference between the ascension of the Sun and the Star aforesaid,
which being divided by 15 you shall find 13 hours, 8 degrees, which make 36
minutes, it is then 13 hours 36 minutes from the noone tijde, that is 1 hour,
36 minut. after midnight.

How to find the ascension on any day in the year of the Sun and the Stars,
we have here adjoyneth 2 tables, the one of the Sun, showing from 5 days to
5 days, the Suns ascension, out of which you may easily find the same in
other days. The other for thirty of the primest fixed Stars, both of them
only by degrees, that being sufficient for this business.

The 19 Point. Of the Horizon, or the Circle that boundeth the sight.
WHere the heavens and the earth or the waters seem, in our sight to meet
together, that is called the Horizon, or the Circle bounding the sight, because
our sight ends there, and can go no further by our Netherland Seafarers, it
is also called the Kimmen. This circle devideth the heavens just in two eve^
parts; so that just the one half is seen by us here above, and the other
half can not be seen by us, because it is hidden underneath us, which
happens in this manner. The earth, (as in the first chapter is showed)
stands as a center in the middle of the heavens, the which by reason of the
unmeasurable quantity or largenes thereof, is so far separated from the
earth, that the whole thickness of the Earth in respect of the heavens, is no
more then a point or prick. or at least so little that it cannot be perceived
by our sight and that which by our sight, along upon the Earth or the Water we
can comprehend, (which can not reach further then about three Dutch miles, that
is 10 English miles) seems in our eyes by reason of the space so little, to
be no other then an half Globe falling perpendicular upon a plain, so that
our sight falls in the heaven, as if we stood in the middle point of the
world, and saw-right compass wise, whereby it falls out, that just the half
of the Heaven is seen by us, and the other half is not seen by us, in like
manner as if a man should lay a line over the center of a Circle, then the one
half of the Circle is above, and the other half is just under. All the
heavenly light, as the Sun, Moon, and Stars (by the turning of the
heavens) coming above the Horizon, are seen by us, and going down under it,
go out of our sight.

The Zenith is the point of the heavens directly over our head, and is on all
sides equally distant from the Horizon it is also called the Pole of the
Horizon.

An Explication.
The Horizon is too be considered in The eye being eleva^ed above the water.
The visible Horizon is lower then ^he trues. foot. minutes. 2 1 4 2 8 3 14 4
20 5 27 6 37 7 39 8 53 9 66 10 82 11 100 12 140 13 163 14 186 15 a twofold
manner: according to the true and the visible, the true goes every way right
waterpasse from our sight, that is passes through the Center of the Sphere, as
is said, deviding it into equal parts, is every way from the Zenith 90 degrees
the just fourth parts of a Circle.

The Visible is the uttermost part of the Earth or Water, that our eye can
reach or see, when our eye is just on the flatt or surface of the even Water,
then the true and Visible Horizon are one and the same, but our eye lifted up
above the surface of the Water, the sight falls (over the Globe of the earth)
every where lower then water-passe, and thence it follows that the visible
Horizon is lower than the true, although this be not much material in the Art
of Navigation, for as much as it is recompensed by the refraction of the
visible Horizon. We have added this table, for those that desire to be exact,
where men may see how much the visible differs from the true that being changed
or altered by feet.

Example.
THe sight being elevated above the surface of the waters 14 feet, in the 1
Column, in the 2 Column over against it, you find 4 min. which the visible
Horizon is lower then the true. The sight being lifted 140 feetabout the
Horizon, the visible will be 13 mi. lower then the true.

The 20 Point. Of the Meridian or Middle Circle.
THe Meridian is a Circle in the Heavens, which we must conceive to pass
through both the Poles of the world, right over our heads, and cross wise
through the Equinoctial, and to cut right through the Horizon North and South.
The Sun touching this Circle is at the highest, and then it is just noone, or
the middle time of the day, and likewise the stars when they come upon this
Circle, they are like the Sun) at the highest of the Horizon, and right South
and as soon as they have past it they begin to go downward again.

The 21 Point. Of the height of the Sun or Stars, and what it is.
THe height of the sun or Stars is nothing else but the distance or space
that is between the Horizon and the Sun or Star it self: which to understand
perfectly, you must make, that we suppose a point or prick to be right above
our heads in the Heavens, that is equally distant from the Horizon in all
places, which point is called the Zenith, or the head point: now seeing that
the whole circuit of the heavens contains 360 degrees and that the just half
thereof is seen above the Horizon, it is certain that this point called the
Zenith in all places is above the Horizon 90 degr. whether you turn cast, west
north or south or any other way: now when the Sun rises above the Horizon, and
ascends higher and higher from it, and comes toward this point or Zenith:
we say that as many degrees as it ascended, from the Horizon toward the
aforesaid point or Zenith, that the same is the height thereof, as by example,
when he is risen half up from the Horizon toward the Zenith, then he is 45
degrees and if he be risen a third part from the Horizon then he is 30 degr.
high, and so forth, the like is also to be understood of the height of the
Stars.

The 22 Point. How to measure or find the height of the Sun or of the Stars.


TO find the height the Mathematicians have devised diverse fit Instruments,
whereof there are two that are most used at sea, which are the Astrolabium, and
the common Crosse-staffe, the use of the Astrolabium is plain and well known
unto all men: for holding the instrument by the ring, let the Sun shine through
the holes of the ears, the uttermost part of the Dial (counting from below
upwards shows how many degrees the Sun is risen above the Horizon: as the
former figure plainly shows.



The Crosse-staffe is used thus, you must place the end of the Staff
underneath the eye, then you must remove the Cross too and fro, until the
upper end of the Cross stands even upon half the Sun or Star, and the under
end just with the Horizon, and then the Cross will show you upon the staff,
how many degrees they are in height, so you account after those numbers whereof
ninety stand that the end of the staff that is next to your eye, the
computation going backward from the other end of the staff: for otherwise if
you reckon by those numbers that proceed forward from the end next your eye,
then it will show you how many degrees the Sun or Star stands from the
Zenith, or Head point of the Horizon, as you may see by the figure ensuing.



The 23 Point. How you must make a perfect Crosse-staffe, and how you shall
mark it.
THe Cross staves are oftentimes made the one after the other by imitation, or
patterns, and that many times without judgment or knowledge whether the
pattern be good or not, whereof notwithstanding a man ought to be very
certain, for it is a matter of great importance and therefore I have here set
down two several ways easy to be understood, how to make the same
exquisitely and perfectly upon good reason and good ground.

Make an even smooth board, and paste good paper upon it, then draw a strait
line upon one edge or side thereof, as you see in this figure a ^ine marked C A
D, then mark another line as you see it marked B C, that B C A be a right and
just half square, then take a good pair of Compasses, and set one foot
thereof in the angle marked C, and compass therewith as you see B E A, so that A
E B may be a right quadrant, or fourth part of a Circle, then devide it into
two parts, to E, and then devide the other half (which is A E) into 90 parts,
or degrees as thus: first devide it into 3 parts, and then devide each 3 parts
again into 3, and then it will be divided into 9 parts, which done, devide each
of them into two parts, and those divisions or parts divide into 5 parts, and
then it will be divided into 90 parts: then take a straight line? and lay the
one end thereof upon the Center C, and so forth upon every several point,
which you have divided in the Quadrant and then draw lines from the Center C
through all the foresaid points, as long as the board will contain them, as
you may see in this figure: which done then your instrument is fully made and
prepared to mark your staves there upon. Which to do, with your compasses
take just the half length of your Cross, and set the one foot thereof in the
Center, and put the other at F, and do the like from D right to G, which two
points or pricks draw with a straight line unto each other as you see in the
line F and G, and then mark where the line F G is cut through by the lines that
come out of the Center through the degrees or points of the quadrant: for those
cuttings through, show upon the said line the right marking of your
Crosse-staffe: that is, you must mark your Staff just as you see that these
lines in F G are marked, by the lines that come out of the center and pass
through it, whether the Cross be long or short, you must follow the same
order that you are taught in the figure, the line H I is drawn for a shorter
Cross then the former, and K L for one that is shorter then that, viz whose
half is just so long as the Line C K.

The second manner of Framing your Crosse-staffe much excels the ftrst in
perfection and curiosity, so you divide it perfectly with your Compasses, which
is done in this manner. Upon an hard even board which is pasted with paper draw
a straight line as long as your staff is, and with point compass take the
just half or the length of your Cross, whereunto you mean to mark your
staff, and prick it many times along in the said line as you can: and divide
each of the said lengths into 11000 equal parts, then look upon the table here
after ensuing, which showed you how many of those points or parts you shall
mark for each degree, and that you must do in manner following, from the end
of the staff, which you will make the eye-end prick just the half length of
the Cross, and there make a Cross stroke, from whence prick for every degree
so many of the aforesaid parts as the table ensuing shows you. As for
example, for the first degree prick 176 parts, for the second 355 parts, for
the third 538 parts, for the fourth 724 parts, and so forth: Remembering that
you must prick all the lengths of pricks or parts aforesaid, from the aforesaid
cross stroke, which is marked upon the half length of the Cross into 11000
parts, then devide the whole Cross so, and then take for every degree half so
many as the Table shows unto you. And if you cannot do so, devide half the
Cross into a 1000 parts, and then leave the hindermost letter of the table
out, as where you should for the first degree take an 176 parts, take but 17
parts, leaving the last figure out: but if your crosses be so small that you can
devide the half of them into no smaller then an hundred parts, then leave out
the two last figures in the table. But you must understand that the more parts
that you devide the crosses into, your marks will fall out so much the better
and perfec^er.

The 24 Point. Of the cutting of the Crosse-staffe, and how a man may help and
prevent all the defects of the staff.
THere being a Crosse-staffe well and exquisitely framed, according to the
doctrine of the former Chapter: it falls out, that certain ignorant persens
cutoff a piece from the eye end of the Staff, about a degree or a degree and a
half, or two degrees long, and can give no other reason of that their doing
but that it must be so, and that they have experience that it ought so to be.
But questionless, seeing they prove by their experience that they do not find
their measuring with uncutt staves perfect and right as it should be, the
fault thereof, is not in the Cross staves uncut, but in themselves, for that
they know not how to use the staff aright, nor understand the true ground
thereof. Others that will seem wiser than the former, give a reason thereof: to
wit, that the staff must be cut, because of the hollownesse of the eye, for
that otherwise the staff cannot come to stand, so that the end thereof be
conjoined to the middle point or center of the eye or sight, this reason has
some show of truth, but notwithstanding is alike untrue and erroneous: for the
staff may very well be set, either on the innermost or outermost corner of the
eye, so that the sight of the eye may fall to answer just to the end of the
staff: that this is truth we will prove with good reason as follows,

Set the great Cross with the middlemost upon like degrees to wit, each upon
such as for that purpose are marked upon the staff: then apply the staff (the
Crosses so firmly remaining) unto your eye in such manner (whether it be on
the innermost or outermost corner it is all one) as that you discern the ends
of the Crosses both above and beneath, just over each other, in form as this
figure specifieth. If then you draw strait lines by the ends of of the Crosses
A B and D C they shall meet just in the middle point of your sight. And in
as much as the Crosses are placed upon like degrees, the lines aforesaid shall
meet just upon the end of the staff, seeing that the end of the staff
represents the center of the quadrant whereby your staff is marked.

So then the aforesaid lines or ends of the Crosses answer both just upon the
end of the staff, and also upon the sight, so that it follows necessarily,
and appears evidently: that the end of the staff and the sight meet in one;
or to speak properly, both of them stand just in the center of the quadrant.

Therefore whenever with the Cross staff you will take the height of the
Sun, or of any Star, then observe diligently: how many degrees it is elevated
above the Horizon: and place the two Crosses upon so many degrees: then apply
the staff to your eye in such manner as that you may see the ends of the
Crosses just over each other, according as is taught before: in such form then
as you find the staff to stand to your eye shall you place the staff (taking
away one of the Crosses) when you desire to measure according to such height:
this is a sure rule which will never fail, neither can you possibly miss if
you follow it.

The 25 Point. How to find the height of the Sun by the shadow.
The common Cross staff is a very fit instrument to take the height at Sea,
as well of the Sun, as of other stars, but if the Sun be very high, we
can not use it so commodiously, because the eye can hardly endure the heath and
brightness of it. To avoid this, we may very conveniently take the height of
the Sun by the shadow, in this manner: make a piece or staff 3 or four feet
long, very smooth, half a thumme thick, broad two or 3 thummes, that it may
remain straight, as you see in A B in the midst of the broad side (just at the
half between the upper and nether edge line, draw aright) C D, make a piece
like E with a hole F, that it may be put into the piece A B. and thrust it to
and fro, also thwart over let there be a small hole for the eye like G, in such
sort that when this sliding piece is fitted to the other, the hole for the eye,
may come to stand just by the midst of the line of the piece C D, neither
higher nor lower. Make another piece like H, and in the midst of the same
also a hole for the eye like K, and an hole thwart like I, that so it may be
put on the end of the staff at B, in such manner that it stand not right, but
thwart or corner wise, as the line B D L shows, and that the hole K, may
stand like the other eyehole G, on the piece E) neither higher nor lower then
the line C D, just by the point D, or else you may in place of that eye hole,
cut off the Cross of the lower edge to the line where the eye-hole stands,
(as you may see in the Cross S) at the line XV. make another Cross, a foot
and a half or two foot long, in the form of M N, with a hole at N, through
which it being put into the foresaid piece, that so you may slide it, to and
again, and that it may go softly and certain on it, then make in the lower
part of the hole a brazen scrue which may be thrust under against the piece
and shuft it close to O P. Last of all, make a small Cross as Q, with an hole
that it may be set on the long Cross M N, and fasten it behind with a scrue
so high or low as use requires, in the end toward the fore part make a flat
ear, an No 2
inch, or an inch and a half broad like R S, neither right nor flat but
thwartwise or cornerwise, so that when all these parts are joined together as
they ought, the flat of that ear, and that thwart flat of the sliding-peece H,
may allway remain at like distance, that is, that they make equal angles, or
that they both may stand the one and the other out of the square against the
piece A B, the parts thus prepared, and joined to each other, the form of this
instrument will be like the figure which is marked N. 2. now to mark this
staff fit for use do thus; make an even board about the breadth of the length
of the long cross, and as long as the piece A B, paest on good paper, in the
one corner, draw a straight line like this figure the line A B C, take a pair
of compass and set the one foot in the point A, and with the other make part
of a circle, as wide as the board will permit, like B D E F; keep the compass
open, and set one foot in B, and the other in the circle drawn, as far as it
will reach, as in E, divide the circle B E into equal parts in D, thrust the
white B D, or D E, from E, forward along the circle to F, then drow a line
from F, to A, the angle F A B is a just triangle, and the bow B D E F is a just
quadrant or fourth part of a circle, the parts B D, D E, E F, divide each in
three parts, again into five, so shall the quadrant be divided into 90 gr.
You may divide into less as halfes, thirds, fourths, if you will. The quadrant
being thus divided, lay a ruler, on the end A, and the other end on the point
of the other divisions, and so draw lines from the point A, through all the
other points, as long as they may stand on the board, as is to be seen in the
figure above.

That being done, the preparation is made; to mark the piece, take first the
just wideness with a pair of Compasses, that is between EG, the foremost
edge of the long cross, and A B the outermost edge of the ear, in the little
cross, as in the figure No. 2. and put that on the piece of the point D, on
the left roundell inward toward C, on that point draw a thwart line, from
thence you shall begin to mark, that the wideness between the middle line of
the staff, and the under edge of the ear, which is in the uppermost cross,
as in the foresaid figure No. 2. from F tot A, prick that on the quadrant from
A toward F in H, and from C to G in I, and draw the line H I. Then observe how
all the lines coming from A the center of the quadrant, cutting through this
line, even so must the piece be marked beginning at the point C with 90, 80,
70, etc. But if so doing, you cannot get so many degrees on the staff, as you
desire to have (for your use) then set the little cross a third or fourth part
lower toward the great cross at your pleasere, so that the under edge of the
ear AB in the figure No. 2. may come to stand at MN, then in the place of the
length F A take F M, and thrust it in the quadrant of A toward F into K, and
from C unto L, and draw the line K L, that then will be marked as it ought, by
cutting the lines, coming from the center through the devision of the
quadrant, but you must take a certain mark in the long cross, for to set the
little cross in such manner as you would use both marking. But if you would
make more marks on the same piece, you must slide that little cross more
netherward and then do as was said before, but you may not forget to make
certain marks in the long cross; for to set the little cross well according
to the marking, which you desire to use.

To mark this cross staff from tables more perfectly, draw on an even board
pasted with paper a right or straight line, as long or longer then the staff
that you desire to mark. You shall with the compass take the wideness of the
staff, between the middle line, and the nethermost edge of the ear at the
little cross, as it is in the figure No. 2. F A or F M, or also F O, what
marking soever you desire to follow set that wideness taken as often along
that foresaid line as you can, and each of these lengths you shall divide in
10000 parts, this table in this place shows how many of these parts you shall
appoint for a degree, or a fourth part of a degree, beginning, as is the figure
a foresaid No. 2. from the point C. The first Column of the table shows the
degrees, the second the min. the third the parts, which you must take for the
degrees, and mi. for the first half degree or 30 min. 87, for a degrees, 175.
for 2 degr. 15 mi. 393, but for 6. degrees, 45. min. 1184. parts; but if you
cannot divide so small a breadth as of F E, or F O, into 10000 parts, then you
may divide it into half so many parts, and so you shall take so many parts for
a degree, or part of a degree, if you cannot do that, you shall devide it into
1000 parts, at every time, leaving out one letter in the table, as when you
should take for the first degree 175. take 17, and as near, as you can one
half, for the 8, degrees in the place of 1405, take 140, and so forward.

Lastly, draw two parrallel lines, on the least roundell standing on the
outermost end of the staff, which may be perfectly seen, whereof the one must
go through the midst of the eyhole as O P, the other so much higher that the
breadth of the ear at the little roundell Q R if you make a good breadth
between these two lines of like wideness. it will be so much the more
serviceable for use; this cross staf being thus compleately made. The use of
it to take the height is this: you shall set it with the back toward the Sun
(as you see in this figure here beneath) and look through the sight of the
moveable runpeece, then shall you likewise see the Horizon through the eyhole
of the least unmovable piece, and keep that as straight as you can, but if
you use a cross as in the figure No. 1. is marked with S. then you shall hold
the lower edge VX. right on the Horizon, as you do in the common cross
staff. Then yon shall slide with your hand the long cross to and fro upon the
staff, until the shadow of the ear at the uppermost little cross fall into
the open field, on the least unmovable thin piece on the end of the staff,
just between the two parrallel lines above the sight hole, to wit in such
manner; that you may at oncesee the Horizon through both the sight holes, and
the shadow of the abovesaid ear even above the two foresaid parrallel lines
that being once obtained, the great cross will stand just by the degree of the
true height of the Sun, to wit, according to such marking as the uppermost
little cross (being high or low) is set.

Having found the height of the Sun, if the declinanation be northerly, you
shall substract it from the height found, that is to say, if you are in the
northside of the Sun, that is if the Sun be southerly, but if the
declination be southerly, then you add it to the height found, and so you
shall find the height of the Equinoctial, which being taken from 90, you
shall find the height of the Pole, as by example: Let the Sun, as in the
figure here by standing, be elevated above the Horizon B D 70, degrees, the
northerly declination E D 10 degrees; If you take these from B D 70 degrees,
there remains 6 degrees, the height of the Equinoctial, this being taken from
B Z, or E G 90, there remains E Z, or B G thirty, just at P A the corner of
the Pole.

But if you mark this staff with the number inverted, so that in the place of
90 you set 0 for 80. 10 for 70 20. and so forth, as the common cross staff is
marked ordinarily, which you use toward the Sun, you must then on the
contrary use the northerly declination, and substract the southerly and so at
the first without further marking, you have the height as it is in the figure,
if as in that which went before you to the height of the Sun being elevated at
D 70 gr. you shall in place 70 find on the staff 20 that is not the height of
the Sun from the Horizon B D, but the fulfilling of the height to 90 degrees as
D Z, that is the distance of the Sun and Zenith, if then you join to it the
northerly declination D E 10 gr. that makes together EZ 30 degrees, the
distance of the Equinoctial and Zenith, and just at P A the elevation of the
Pole. In the same manner if the Sun has southerly declination, and is risen
from the Horizon 50. gr. as in S. you shall not find on the staff 50 gr. for B
S, but 40. gr. for S Z the distance of the Sun and the Zenith. Then if you
take S E the southerly declination from S Z 40. there remains E Z 30 degrees,
for the distance of the Equinoctial and the Zenith just at P A the height of
the Pole.

That the unsliding piece should be moveable by the sight it is done for 2.
causes; first that you may slide it netherward or outward as these and sliding
of the great cross requires, secondly, that in soul weather when the waves
go high, you may set it inward (as occasion shall require) for your better
measuring, for where the waves are high and troublesome long instruments, are
not so fit for use as short. This foresaid cross staff is very fit, to take
the height certainly on the firm land, without the use of the Horizon. That
you may do this, you shall lay the staff on a table or any other flat place in
a rightline with the water the eye end directly to the south, and with the
other end, where the thwart sliding piece stands to the north, on two smooth
pieces of wood, so much lifted up that you may slide the long cross too and
again without hinderance, then when the Sun comes directly south, (that is,
when the Sun has equal shadow on each side of the staff, then shall you
slide the long cross too and fro, so long until the shadow of the ear at the
little cross fall just between the two parrallell lines on the thwart cross;
that being done, you shall find the height of the Sun in the staff at the
long cross, which being sound, you shall by that know the height of the Pole
or the distance of the place where you take the height according to the
instructions before laid down.

Here follows the Table by which you must mark the foresaid cross staff.

The first Column shows the degrees, the second the minutes, which are above
the degrees, the third the number of pricks, points, or parts belonging to
such degrees and minutes.

The 26. Point. Concerning the use of the searing.
THe Astrolabiums which men now a days commonly use at Sea, I mean that with
a D^optra, upon which stand two penullen, and are not verry serviceable by
reason of the continual motions of the ships to be used at sea unless the
penullen upon the Dioptra are placed near by one another, for then the
Shipmaisters some times use the Astrolabium in the measuring of the Son.
Nevertheless the Astrolabium can have no such perfection in it, for the
Dioptra in the said Astrolabiums are placed almost 2 or 3 inches at most the
one from the other, and if so be, in a little time, a small fault or mistake
happen in the observation of the shaddows even as through motion of the shipp
it may easily happen, so also must the Dioptra upon the degrees of the Limbus
make a greater mistake and fault.

Therefore have I here set down this figured and drawn Ring which you may let
be made ready or prepared by Messig about one foot or a foot and half wide
and 2 or 3 inches broad. For in the use of it you have no need of a Dioptra
but you let the Son shine through the little holes because the shadow may
the more perfectly and narrowly be observed, so! then let the ring b^ covered
on both sides only that there may be some opening left that so the degrees
which stand marked on the inside may be fitly seen and used.

These degrees fall once more wider one from the other then in the Limbus of
the Astrolabium, because in this the shadow falls out of the circumference;
or out of the sides and not (as it is in the Astrolabium) out of the Center,
and therefore is the whole circumference of the Ring according to the Art of
Geometry divided into 180 degrees, whereas on the contrary in the Astrolabium
the Limbus or round ring encompassing it contains 360 degrees.



The beginning of the degrees begins by the letter O, right even against the
little hole over that which is placed next by the handel: there are 2 little
holes or chinkes made in the Ring through which you let the shadow fall, the
one stands by the letter B, placed about 10 degr. from the pendel E, by which
the ring is hung. The other little hole C. stands just 30 degrees distant from
the little hole. B. Because: when the Sun is not verry high above the
Horison, then we receive the shadow through the little hole C, and then we
begin to count the degrees not far from the letter O, as beforesaid, but from
the letter F, standing right just over against C. just 3^ degrees distant from
O.

This ring being thus made I should think it most fitting to signify the hight
of the Sun, notwithstanding the Shipmaisters now adays use the degree-bow,
which nevertheless are great^ly subject to faults and mistakes.

The 27. Point. Of the breadth of the Lands.
THe breadth of Lands or Countries is no other, then the distance or wideness
that is between the said Lands and the Equinoctial Line, which is reckoned in
a double manner, that is northerly and southerly, to the number of 90. Such
Lands or Countries as lie right under the Equinoctial Line have no breadth:
but such as lie northward from it, have northerly breadth, and they that lie
southerly have southerly breadth.

Example.
The Island of S. Thomas, in the River Gaban in Guiena lies right under the
Line, and therefore has no breadth neither northerly nor southerly.

The Cape S. Vincent in Spain lies northward from the Line 37 degrees, and
therefore the northern breadth of Cape S. Vincent is 37 degrees.

The point of Lizart in England lies northward from the Line 50 degrees,
therefore the north breadth of Lizart is 50 degrees.

The Cape de Bona Esperance lies southward from the Line 34 degrees and a
half, therefore the southerly breadth of Capa de Bona Esperance is 34 degrees
and a half. In like manner you must understand and reckon their Lands,
Countries and Towns.

The 28. Point. Of the height of Lands and Countries, and what it is.
THe height and breadth of Lands and Countries although that in themselves
they are diverse things, yet they are always one like unto the other. Any
Country being situated under the breadth of 30 degrees, lies also in the
height 30 degrees, which by Seafaring men is taken without difference, but
what it is, or what it has in it or signifies few men understand, and yet it
behooveth a seafaring man, that seeks for the height of any Countries, to be
expert therein, for that no man without it can well understand how many
instruments (whether it be Astrolabium, or Cross staff, no nor the
Sea-compasse it self) should well be used: for that these things are all built
upon one foundation, and like a chain hang one upon the other. But it may be
that some man will object and say, that there are many Pilots which do not
well understand such things and yet are able to go directly unto diverse
places, whether they desire to sail: which I confess to be true: but tell me
how many times are they deceived? How many times are they in great doubt and
fear? and how seldom dare they trust unto the height which they have taken or
reckoned, when they are to seek out any Country thereby? how oftentimes has
it heretofore happened, that for want of such knowledge, ships have sailed
out of their way either, behind England, or upon France, which thought to
pass through the channel between England and France, and that in so short and
well known, and common sailed water, as to come out of Spain or France? what
would such men do, if they should pass the Line, and were to seek or find
out certain Islands? Or that after they had sailed up and down the Seas
certain months together, should then seek out for Land? but I am of this
opinion which I know every man will grant that it is much better and more
assured to go away being guided by his own eyesight, then like a blind man
to be led by another, and knows not whether that other sees well or not:
but to come again to our matter, touching the height of Countries, it is no
other but the height of the Pole above the Horizon, that is to say, so many
degrees as the Pole in any Land is lifted up above the Horizon; so much is the
height of such a Country: and this height agrees always with the breadth as
aforesaid. In the 10 Chapter it is showed, that wheresoever a man goes or
turns, always the one half of the Heavens shows it self above the
Horizon and the other half is hidden from us: in the first chapter it is said
that the two Poles stand right one against the other, whereby it is evidently
to be understood, that whenever a man being upon the earth is right under the
Equinoctial line, that then both the Poles of the World, lie right in the
Horizon, one in the south, and the other in the north: and as much as a man
travaileth northward from the Equinoctial line; and wins breadth northerly,
so much the north Pole rises above the Horizon: and the south Pole
contrariwise goes so much under: and on the contrary, as many degrees as a man
goes from the Equinoctial line southward, and wins breadth southward, so
much the south Pole rises above the Horizon, and the north Pole goes so much
under: which may easily be understood by the figure here after following.

In this figure the innermost roundel that turns about, signifies the
Heaven, N the north Pole, S the south Pole, AE the Equinoctial, the uppermost
edge of the half moveable roundell, signifies the Horizon, the one half off
the Heavens is above it, and the other half just under it, the round ball in
the middle signifies the earth, where in you see a little man, that may be
turned upon the earth southward and northward.



Now perfectly to mark and perceive that which is before written, that is to
know what height is, and that it always agrees with the breadth, bring the
little man upon the Earth Globe right under the Equinoctial, that is to say
that it have no breadth, neither northward nor southward, then you shall see
that both the Poles lie just with the Horizon, and that neither of them both
are elevated above it, nor depressed under it, and withal, you shall see that
they that dwell under the Equinoctial have no height or elevation of the Pole,
nor yet any breadth. But if you remove the man so much northward that he goes
ten degrees upon the earth, that is, that he comes ten degrees upon the
north breadth, you shall see that the north Pole shall be raised or elevated
ten degrees above the Horizon in the north, and the south Pole shall go ten
degrees under the Horizon: and if you remove the man upon the earth more
northerly, as thirty, forty, or fifty degrees, the north Pole will also be so
much elevated, and the south Pole to the contrary so much depressed under the
Horizon: so that if you turn the man upon the earth to ninety degrees, then
the north Pole also will be elevated ninety degrees, that is the Pole will
stand right above his head, and the Equinoctial will join with the Horizon in
one circle: that which thus is ^^id of the elevating of the north Pole, is also
in the same manner to be understood of the south Pole: for if you likewise move
the man upon the earth in the figure toward the south, the south Pole will be
elevated above the Horizon, as much as the man in breadth goes southward, and
the north P^le will go so much under the Horizon.

One thing is herein to be noted, that as much as the Pole rises above the
Horizon just so much the Equinoctial goes under it, and when the Pole goes
under, the Equinoctial rises again in equal proportion.

But above all you must mark, that the number of the Poles elevation added to
the height of the Equinoctial always make even ninety degrees, so that when
the Pole is elevated 30 degrees in the north, the Equinoctial is elevated
sixty degrees in the south: but if the south Pole be elevated above your
Horizon twenty degrees, the Equinoctial will be elevated in the north seventy
degrees, which is clearly understood and showed in this manner: we always see
half the Heavens above the Horizon, (as aforesaid) which is twice ninety
degrees, from the south to the Zenith or the point just over our heads, and
from ^he Zenith to the Horizon in the north. Now seeing (...) between the
Equinoctial and the Pole there are always ninety degrees, (as is showed in
the second chapter) it follows that which is beneath the Pole and the
Equinoctial, makes also ninety degrees: therefore when we know the height of
the Equinoctial, and take it out of ninety, that which rests over is always
the height of the pole, this also may be seen in the figure aforesaid.

The 29. Point. Concerning the difference and agreement of the Declination in
diverse places of the earth.
THese Tables of the Suns declination are reckoned upon the Meridian or length
of the earth from the westend of England. Those which are more easterly from
thence, have the lesser declination, when the Sun departs from the Line, and
increases in declination either toward the North or South as well between the
20 of March, and the 22 of June, as between the 23 of September, and the 22 of
December, and the greater declination, when the Sun returns again toward
the Line, whether it be by north or by south the Line as well between the 22
of December, and the 20 of March, as between the 22 of June, and the 23 of
December.

On the contrary, those which are more westerly from thence, have the waxing
declination (that is when the Sun runs from the Line either by North or by
South the Line, the greater declination and the falling declination (that is
when the Sun runs again toward the Line, either by North or by South the
Line, makes the less. That comes to pass by reason of time, thus. Those
which are more easterly have the Sun sooner in the south or in their
Meridian, and therefore is the waxing declination less, and the falling
greater, on the contrary those which are more westerly have the Son later in
the South, and therefore have they the increasing declination more, the
decreasing less.

The first Example.
Concerning those which are more easterly with rising declination upon the 25
of March in the second year following the Leap-yeare I desire to know ^he
Sons declination at noone at Bantam in the East Indies. First I seek upon a
Globe or any other Table, how much more Easterly Bantam lies then the Lands
end of England, and I find it to be about 120 degrees (herein we reckon not
so near upon a degree or two, because such a difference is but little in this
respect) whilst then the Son must have 24 hours to run about the heaven or
the whole earth which is 360 degrees, I seek how much time he must have to
run 120 degrees, and I say thus: 360 degrees ma^^ 24 hours, what makes then
120, facit 8 hours, (...) thence I find that the Sun comes 8 hours sooner
to the South at Bantam then at the Lands end of England that is: That the Sun
is fall South at Bantam, when it is but 4 a clock after midnight at Englands
Lands end. Then I look in these Tables upon the abovewritten 25 of March for
the declination of the Sun, and I find it to be 1 degree 57 minutes, and (out
of the declination on the day following 2 degrees 21 minutes) that the
declination of the Sun at that time in 24 hours increases 24 minutes,
therefore say I: if the declination increase 24 minutes in 24 hours how much
in 8 hours? facit 8 minutes, from thence it is clear that seeing the Sun
runs from the Meridian over Bantam to the Meridian of Englands end, and the
declination rises or increases 8 minutes, that it at Bantam is 8 minutes
less as these Tables declare. The Suns declination is that day at Bantam no
more then 1 degree and 49 minutes by north the Line.

The Second Example. With falling Declination.
Upon the 16 of the same year I desire to know the Suns declination at noone)
at Bantam and I find in these Tables upon that day for the length of England
Lands end 2 degrees 40 minutes, that it decreaseth every day at that time of
the year 24 minutes. Seeing then the Sun (as is said in the first example)
comes 8 hours sooner to the South at Bantam then at Englands end, I say does
the declination decrease 24 minutes in 24 hours, how much makes it in 8
hours? it makes 8 minutes from thence it is known, that seeing the Son
runs from the Meridian of Bantam to that of Englands End, and the
declination falls 8 minutes, and therefore at Bantam is it 8 minutes more,
even as these Tables declare. The declination of the Son on that day is at
Bantam 2 degrees and 48 minutes.

Observation.
From hence it follows: That one and the same Steerman (sailing eastwards to
the Indies, coming upon two such diverse times before the Strait of Sunda, and
would take the height of the Pole according to the Sun of one and the same
corner of Land, and should use these Tables without such caution, he should
(though he thought it well done) thereby (taking one time 8 minutes so much
and the other time 8 minutes too little declination) he should find it to
differ 16 minutes in his height, therefore in long voyages you must think well
upon this.

The third Example. Concerning those which are more Westerly with rising
declination.
A certain Ship coming upon the 9 of October in the third year after
Leape-yeare upon the great South Sea, near the Coast of Peru, the Steerman
desires to know the Suns declination there at noone, he finds (out of a
Globe or any other Table) that that Coast lies full 80 degrees more Westerly
then Englands Lands End. The Sun must then run from the South over Englands end
to the South of the foresaid Coast of Peru full 80 degrees, to which he
requires about 5 hours and an half, so that when the Sun stands there in
the South, it is then from Englands end half an hour past 5 in the afternone.
He finds in these Tables the declination of that day 6 degrees 13 minutes by
South the Line, and (out of that of the following day which is 6 degrees 36
minutes) that at that time in 24 hours the declination rises 23 min.)
therefore shall he say: the declination rises in 24 hours 33 minutes, how
much then in 5 hours and a? facit full 5 minutes, and from thence we find,
that seeing the Sun running from the Meridian of Englands end to heart of the
Coast of Peru rises full 5 minutes, and thereupon the declination on that day
is there 5 minutes more, even as the tables demonstrate. The declination then
on that day on the Coast of Peru is 6 degrees 18 minutes.

The fourth Example. Concerning the falling declination.
Suppose that such comes to pass on the foresaid Coast of Peru on the 8 of
September the same year, these tables point at the declination of that day 5
degrees 46 minutes, and the day following 5 degrees 23 minutes, so as upon that
time of the year in 24 hours time the declination lesseneth 23 minutes. The
Steerman shall then reckon thus, if in 24 hours the declination lesseneth 23
minutes, how much is that in 5 hours and a half, facit full 5 minutes; and
shall from thence find that his declination is there 5 minutes less, as these
Tables instruct, the Sons declination then upon that day is upon the Coast of
Peru 5 degrees 42 minutes, from hence may be understood, what it is which
before is said in the example of the more easterly, that a Steereman when would
look after the Sun on the Coast of Peru upon such two diverse times in the same
place, and would use these Tables of declination without the foresaid care and
caution, though he sail right and well should nevertheless find 10 minutes
difference.

The fifth Example.
Suppose 2 Ships being together depart from these Lands, the one sayleth
eastwards, and comes according to his reckoning upon the 26 of September in
the first year following the Leap-yeare on the other side of the world, I
suppose 180 degre^s, in longitude distant from Englands end, and find in these
Tables the declination of the Sun on that day 2 degrees 0 minutes. The other
ship sayleth westwards, and meets the first shipp at the foresaid place
according to this reckoning not upon the 26 of September but upon the 25, and
finds the declination in these Tables for that day 1 degree 24 minutes, and
so differ as well in the time one day, and accordinglly in the declination 24
minutes, which comes to pass from this, the first sailed toward the
Sunrising 180 degrees, has shortened his time 12 hours. The other sailed with
the Son 180 degrees, has lengthened his time 12 hours, and thereby has had
one night less then the other whilst then the declination at that time
increases in one day 24 minutes, so must he that is sailed eastwards reckon
12 minutes declination less, and he that is sailed westwards must reckon 12
minutes more, as the Tables each and shall have one sort of declination to wit 1
degrees. 12 m. haved.

The 30. Point. How to find the height of the Pole by the Sun.
TO find the height of the Pole by the Sun, one thing is specially to be
marked, to wit, whether you are northward or southward from the Sun, whether
the Sun stands northward or southward from you is easily known, when you
are in such a place upon the earth as is far from the Line, or from the
Sun, but when the Sun is near almost above your head, then you cannot well
see it with your eye, therefore set a compass before you that you may see
where north and south is, then take your Astrolabium, and set it so that the
one edge thereof stand right south, and the other north, and then you shall see
at a hayres breadth, whether the Sun being at the height, stands northward
or southward from the head point or Zenith: if then you will seek the height
of the Pole, when you are on the north side of the Sun, that is, when the
Sun is Southward from you, then take the just height first, and as much as
the declination of the Sun is northward, take it out of your height and that
which rests is the height of the Equinoctial in the south, which subtracted
out of ninety (as in the former Point is declared) then you have the height of
the north Pole.



Example.
In this figure let P be the north Pole, and G the South Pole, E H the
Equinoctial, A B the Horizon, Z the Zenith, and D the Sun: let the height of
the Sun B D be sixty degrees above the Horizon: the northerly declination D E
8 degrees: if then you take D E 8 degrees from B D the height of the Sun,
there will rest B E 52 degrees, which is the height of the Equinoctial, which
taken out of 90 degrees, rests 38 degrees, for the height of the north Pole A
P, as in the 7 Point is showed.

If the declination be Southerly, then add unto the height aforesaid taken:
and then if the addition be less then 90, then look upon the height of the
Line in the south which taken out of 90, as aforesaid, it leaves you the
height of the North Pole.



Example.
Let the height of the Sun be D B 40 degrees, the southerly declination of the
Sun E D 20 degrees, then add E D 20 degrees, to D B 40 degrees, it makes E B
60 degrees the height of the Equinoctial which subtracted from 90, as E G the
distance between the Equinoctial and de south Pole; then there will rest 30
for G B, that is, as much as the south Pole is gone under the Horizon: as
before is showed, so much as the one Pole is under the Horizon, just so much is
the other above it, the north Pole P shall here be elevated thirty degrees.

But if the height of the Sun being added unto the declination makes more
then 90 degrees, then you must understand, that the Equinoctial is northward
from your head just so much as the aforesaid addition is more then 90 and so
consequently the South Pole also shall be so much elevated.



Example.
Look into the figure next following, wherein let the height be D B 80
degrees, and the southerly declination E D 18 degrees, then if you add E D 18
degrees to B D 80 degrees, the height of the Sun there will be 98 degrees, for
B E, seeing then that from the Horizon B, to the Zenith Z (that is the point in
Heaven right above our heads) is just 90 degr. as in the 22 point is taught) it
follows that E the Equinoctial is 8 degrees northwards from the Zenith Z,
and so 82 degr. elevated in the north, above the Horizon: when E A is taken out
of 90 there rests 8 degrees for the height of the south Pole, G above the
Horizon B, then you must understand, that you are between the Line and the
Sun.

How you shall find the height of the Pole, when you are southward from the
Sun.
WHen you perceive that you are southward from the Sun, that is when the
Sun stands northward from you, first (as aforesaid) take the height of the
Sun: then if the declination be southwards, take it out of your height which
you have found, and then you shall have the height of the Equinoctial, which
subtracted from 90, it shows under what height you are, southward from the
Line.



Example.
Behold the figure above standing, Let A D be the height of the Sun in 64
degrees: the southerly declination E D 16 degrees: which subtracted from A D
the height of the Sun, there remains for A E 48 degrees, the height of the
Equinoctial in the north, which subtracted out of 90 then the height of the
South Pole G B will be 42 degrees.

If the declination be northerly, then add it to the height found out, if
then the addition be less then 19 it shows you the height of the
Equinoctial, which taken out from 90, you find the height of the south Pole.



Example.
Look on the figure with his circles as it follows here after, let A D the
height of the Sun in the North be 50 degrees, and D E, the northerly
declination 15 degr. then add E D 15 to D A 50 degrees, t^en you have 65 degr.
for A E is the height of the Equinoctial, then G B the height of the south Pole
is 25 degrees. for as in the 27 Point it is showed, the height of the Equinoctial
E A with the height of the Pole G B always make 90 degrees.

But if the height and the declination of the Sun added together make more then
90, you must note that the Line is southward from you Zenith, as much as that
number is above 90.

Example.
Look on the following figure, let the height of the Sun A D in the north be
84 degrees, the declination E D 21 degr. add them together, then you have A E
105 degrees, which is the distance between the Equinoctial E, and the Horizon
in the north: now mark that A E is 105. and P the Pole, and E the
Equinoctial, are even 90 degr. from each other then it follows that P from A
is 15 degrees, that is the height of the n. Pole above the Horizon, and so much
you must be northward from the Line, and you must also mark that you are
between the Line and the Sun.

How you shall find the height when you are right under the Sun.
IF you understand well the rules before going, then this is easy to be found.
If you be right under the Sun, that is when the Sun is elevated 90 degrees,
then you are even as many degrees northward or southward from the Line, as the
Sun has northerly or southerly declination.

The explication thereof.
Suppose that you find the height off the Sun above the Horizon to be 90
degrees, and that it is declined toward the north 16 degrees, then are you also
16 degrees northward from the Line, and the north Pole shall be so much
elevated.

But if the Sun has no declination, that is, when it stands even in the
Line, then you must understand, that you are also right under the line, and so
both the Poles are on the Horizon without any elevation.

How you shall find the height of the Sun northward in such places where as
it goes not down.
THey that in Summer sail to Moscovia, in the months May, June and July,
coming about the North Cape, find, that the Sun at that time goes not
down there, but is always above the Horizon, so that a man according to the
rules aforesaid, may not only seek the height off the Pole by the Sun, when
it is highest southward, but also when it is northward at the lowest. in this
manner following. Take the height of the Sun with the cross staff, when it is
lowest in the north, and add there to the filling of the declination, (which
is such a number as together with the declination make ninety, or so much as
the Sun stands from the Pole) and you shall find the just height of the
Pole: or if you substract the height of the Sun from his declination then you
shall find how deep the Equinoctial is depressed northward under the Horizon,
or in the south elevated above the Horizon, which subtracted from 90, will
likewise leave the height of the Pole, both these ways I will declare apart.



Example.
Mark the figure afore-going, where let B D be the height of the Sun about the
Horizon, in the north 7 degr. H D the declination of the Sun 20 degrees, then
shall D P the filling of the declination, or the distance of the Sun from the
Pole be 70 degrees: now if you add P D the filling of the declination 70, to
be B D 7, the height of the Sun, you shall find 77 degr. for B P the height of
the Pole.

Another Example.
If you take the height of the Sun A D 7, from H D 20 the declination of the
Sun, there will remain 13 for H B, and so much is the Equinoctial in the north
depressed under the Horizon, which if you substract from H P 90, there
remains for A P, 77 the height of the Pole, as abovesaid.

The 31. Point. How to find the height of the Pole by the Stars.
TO find the height by the Stars which stand near the Equinoctial, you use
them either substracting from or adding thereto their declination, as you do
with the Son. And those which stand near the Poles you must either substract
from or add to their distances from the Pole to their measured height and so
find out the height of the Pole.



The First Example.
Let A B be the Horizon, P the North Pole, E D the Equinoctial, S the
northstarre standing under the Pole, I measure the height of the Northstarre S
B, above the Horizon 46 degrees, and for it I find in the Table the distance of
the Northstarre from the Pole P S, 2 degrees 42 minutes, adding this then to
the height that I find B S and makes together 48 degrees 42 minutes for P B
the height of the Pole.

The second Example.
Let F be the clearest of the waiters above the Poles risen above the Horizon
F B 58 degrees, then his distance from the Pole F B being subtracted 14
degrees 14 minutes even as the foregoing table does teach you there rests for
P B the height of the Pole 13 degrees 46 min. If you come by Southwards the
Line, and will use the Stars near the Northpole, so may you substract the
height (which you find) from the distance of the Star from the Pole, and to
find the depth of the North Pole under the Horizon, even to the height of the
South Pole above it.

The third Example.
Let S be the northermost hinder wheel of the great wagon, his height above
the Horizon in the North B S 20 degrees, which being subtracted from S P,
which is 26 degrees and 14 minutes being his distance from the Pole, here
remains over B P 6 degrees 14 min. which the North Pole is sunk under the
Horizon and to G A the height of the Southern Pole.

Even as the southern Stars being full south are at the highest, so are
likewise the Northern in the north rightabove the Pole at the highest, or
under the Pole at the lowest, this you may well near see by your eye in many
which stand some what far distant from the Pole, too wit, when they stand
either above or below the Northstarre, but not right against it, by reason that
the Northstarre it self by it own turning about the Pole, wendeth either on
one side or other some what from full North, so that when you draw nearer the
North, you must still be measuring to find out the right highest or lowest.

Now to know when the Northstarre is either at his highest or lowest pitch,
still mark well the great wagon, when that comes under the Northstarre, so
that when you let a plummet line hang right against the northstarre, it may
likewise come to hang in the middle between the Wagon and the horses, then is
the Northstarre right at his highest, above the Pole. Or when the Wagon also
comes above the Northstarre, and when you let a plummet line hang through
between the Wagon and the horses, that that also hangs right against the
Northstarre, then is the Northstarre right under the Pole at the lowest, even
as stands delineated in the following Figures.

Thus is the Northstarre right above the Pole.

Thus is the Northstarre right under the Pole.



Or when the Star in the Breast of Cassiopeia comes right above the
Northstarre, then is the Northstarre above the Pole at its highest, and when it
is right under the Northstarre, then is the Northstarre at the lowest under the
Pole, according to the demonstration in these figures hereunder specifyed.



The stars of the great wagon are known to every one. And of the Stars of
Cassiopeia. There are 5 very clear the principal in form, as formerly
stands expressed the second of them that is which is farthest distant from
the Northstarre, and is in the breast, and stands near upon as far from
the Northstarre as the northermost fore wheel of the great Wagon, if you hold
a strait stick upon the sight, mark on end through between the Wagon and the
horses, and mark it in the midst over the Northstarre, and then the other end
shall stretch over the foresaid star called Cassiopeias breast.

The 32. Point. The use of the North star when you take the height by the
wayters which are on the northern hinderwheele of the great Wagon.
FOr as much as many Pilots know not the names of many of the fixed stars,
and therefore follow the use of the north star according to the points of the
compass: we have for the use for these men, made two sorts of tables the one
according to the waters (which we have mended,) the other according to the
northern hinder wheel of the great Wagon, both of them on the four strokes
north, south, east and west, and in as much as in this kind or work the north
star has a different standing in sundry heights of the Pole, we have
calculated the tables agreeing to diverse heights or latitudes from 10 degrees
to 10 degrees as follows.

At the height of 10. degrees.
When the brightest of the wayters stands in the East, then is the north star
under the Pole 1 degr. 28 min. North, then it is 2 degr, 48 minutes under the
Pole. West 1 degree 22 min. above the Pole. South 2 degrees, 18 min. above the

North, the north star is two degr. 12 min. under the Pole. West, the north star
is 33 min. under the Pole. South, the north star is 2 degrees 44 min. higher
then the Pole.

The use of the North star, agreeing with the northermost hinder wheel of
the Wagon.
At the height of 10 degrees.
When the northermost Wheel of the wagon stands in the East, then is the n.
star higher then the Pole 1 degree, 1 min. North, the n. star is two degrees 27
min. above the Pole. West, the n. star is 1 degree, 13 min. lower then the
Pole. South, the n. star is under the Horizon out of sight. At the height of 20
degrees.
The northern wheel of the Wagon. East, the n. star is 54 min. higher then the
Pole. North, the n. star is 2 degr. 27 min. under the Pole. West, the n. star
is 1 degree, 19 min. lower then the Pole. South, the n. star is 2 degr. 27 min.

the height of 60 degrees.
The Northermost hinder Wheel. East, the n. star is 2 minutes above the Pole:
North, the n. star is 2 degr. 26 min. under the Pole. West, the n. star is 2

At the height of 10 degr. the n. hinder Wheel of the great Wagon cannot come
from the Horizon at the same height with the northstarre.

A Declaration of the East, West, South, and Northern Waiters, and of the
great Wagon.
The waiters East, that is when the clearest or middlemost stands toward the
east, and higher above the waiters Horizon then the northstarre, according to
the explication of the first figure.

The Waiters north, that is when the clearest stands right above the
northstarre, even as in the second figure.

The waiters west, that is when the middlemost of the waiters, stands toward
the west, and there withal one high above the Horison, as in the third figure.

The waiters south, that is when the clearest of them stands right under the
northstarre, as in this fourth figure.

In the same manner as of the waiters, so is also to be understood. The East,
West, South and north of the northermost hinder Wheel of the great Wagon
thus:

The northermost hinder Wheel in the north, that is, when the same stands
right above the northstarre, according to explication in the first figure.

The northermost hinder Wheel of the Wagon east, is when as the same stands
eastwards and high above the Horizon toward the northstarre, as in this second
figure.



The same hinder wheel of the Wagon in the south is when it stands right over
the Northstarre even as in the third figure.

And in the West, when it stands Westwards and high toward the Northstarre
above the Horison as is seen in the fourth figure.

The use of the aforesaid Tables.
You must stay till you have the clearest of the waiters, or the northermost
hinder wheel of the great Wagon, upon any of the foresaid Points, then you
take the height of the North star above the Horison. The height being found
with the quessing together. You may then something nearely know the height of
the Pole. Then you can sufficiently find out of the foresaid Tables how much
the Northstarre is higher or lower then the Pole. Is it higher, then you must
substract from, but is it not lower you must add that to the measured height,
and so come to find the right height of the Pole.

These foresaid Tables are reckoned all from 10 degrees to 10, and when you are
between such heights so shall you (coming upon other heights) take notice,
how many degrees you are either above or under these reckoned Poles. And
therewithal how great the difference is between such two, seeing we find,
that have observed it, you take from the difference according to the reason of
the height where you are, less or more from the foresaid numbers, adding that
too or substracting from, even as the cause requires.

The first Example.
In the height of 46 I desire to know how much the North star stands lower
then the waiters stand in the east, observing. How great the difference is
between the height of 40 and 50 degrees, I find 5 minutes increasing, I say
therefore 10 degrees difference in height gives 5 minutes, what amounts 6
degrees to, facit 2 minutes, that being added by the 1 degree 39 minutes which
I find on the Table over against 40 degrees because the difference is
increasing from 40 toward 50 degrees, and so I find it 1 degree 42 minutes.

The second Example.
In the height of 48 degrees, I desire to know, how far the North Star
stands too high, when the most northerly hinder wheel of the Wagon stands
East, the difference in the Table between 40 and and 50 degrees height is 14
minutes lessening, I say therefore if 10 degrees differ in height 14 minutes,
what shall 8 degrees do, facit full 11 minutes, these being subtracted from
38 minutes standing right against 40 degrees height, now because that the
difference of 40 to 50 degrees lesseneth, I find 27 minutes which the
Northstarre stands too high upon the aforesaid 48 degrees.

The 32. Point. Concerning the elevation of the heavenly Lights through the
Damps.
It Is known by experience that Son, Moon, and all the Stars approaching
the Horison, seem also to be more and more high then in truth, they are the
cause whereof we suppose to be the damps, which continually, (through the
warmth of the waters and the earthly moistures) rise from the earth, which how
nearer they are to the Horison are so much the thicker, and thereby the lights
so much the more seem to be higher. The nearer you come to the Pole, so much
the more damps, and thereby the elevation of the heavenly lights above their
places are the greater. The famous Astronomer Tycho Brahe has by correct
observation found it in his Clime in the latitude of 55 degrees 56 minutes even
as these following tables teach you.

The Table of the Suns Elevation.
The Sun high 0 degrees appears 34 minutes higher then it is really. 1
degrees 26 minutes 2 degrees 20 minutes 4 degrees 15 minutes 7 degrees 13
minutes 10 degrees 10 minutes 16 degrees 7 minutes 23 degrees 3 minutes 32
degrees 1 minutes The Table of the Stars Elevation.
The stars high 0 degrees appear 30 minutes higher then they are indeed. 1
degrees 22 minutes 2 degrees 15 minutes 4 degrees 11 minutes 7 degrees 8
minutes 11 degrees 5 minutes 15 degrees 3 minutes

The use of the foresaid Tables of the Elevation.
IF you measure the Sons height above the Horison less then 32 degrees you
must substract so much as the Table teaches you on the number of the height
you have found: If you measure the distance of the Son from the Zenith more
then 58. on the contrary you shall add as much too as the Table besides the
suppliment to 90 from the measured distance from the Zenith, teaches. But the
Sun being more then 40 degrees above the Horison and 50 degrees from the
Zenith, these exaltations and elevations come to nothing.

The first Example.
I measure the height of the Son above the Horizon 4 degrees, the Table of
Elevations of the Son points me the Son to appear 15 minutes higher
then in truth it is, and draw then those 15 minutes off from my measured
height, and I do keep for the true height of the Sun 3 degree 45 minutes.

The Second Example.
I measure the distance of the Sun from the Zenith 74 degrees, the suppliment
thereof to 90 is 16 degrees thereby in the Table of the Son, I find 7 minutes
which I add to the distance I measured and so I find for the right distance
74 degrees 7 minutes.

Even as it is said of the Son, according to the Table of the Son, so must
you also do with the Stars according to the Table of Stars.

The first Example.
I measure in the North upon the lowness of the middlemost Horse on the great
Wagon 7 degrees above the Horison, besides that I find in the Table of Stars
8 minutes, which being subtracted from the measured height, I detain for the
true height 6 degrees 52 minutes.

The Second Example:
I measure the distance from the Zenith of the Constellation which we call the
great Dog 86 degr. the supplement thereof to 90 is 4, even besides that I
find in the Table 11 minutes, which being joined by the distance you found, I
find it 86 degrees 11 minutes.

The 33. Point. Of the CARD.
IT is known to every man, especially to those that derstand the grounds of
Cosmographie, that the earth with the waters make one complete round body, and
therefore it cannot be, that you should set forth the same perfectly in a plane
or Card (either in the hole or in part) but there will be some want, for it
is unpossible to make a plain agree with a round form in all the parts
thereof. So that your common cards many times fail in truth, especial those
that comprehend great and long voyages by sea, and far from the Equinoctial;
but the Maps which are commonly used in this Country, of the Easterly and
Westerly Navigation, are without fault, or at least the errors are so little
that they hinder not.

They are very fit instruments to be used at sea, and our forefathers, which
have invented them, have brought no small profit and utility to Mariners. The
fault of them consists in this, and thus it may be seen: If you would sail a
triangle, the 2 first sides will be sailed on their strokes and distances; but
from the 2 to the 3 place (that is the 3 side of the triangle) it will fail
both on the strokes and distances.

Example.
I sail from the Lizard a straight course to the Islands of Canary, and from
thence again to the Islands of Corvo and Flores, on which foresaid stroks and
distances many Maps are very complete and perfect. But if I would sail again
from Corvo to the Lizard, from whence I first sailed, the Card will show me an
imperfect way, to wit, it will seem farther wide in the Card, then indeed it
is, also it will differ on the points of the Compass: so that you must direct
your course more northerly then that which your Card directs.

In so short a journey, as this above said, it is not much observed, neither
is it worth the observation: but those that sail to the West Indies, shall
soon perceive it; when they set sail, they take their course far to the
south, and there they find their Cards of a fit length, because the Cards are
fitted to it; But in their return, when they take their course northward, they
find the way much shorter then their Cards show them.

This is the cause: All the lines in the Card from north and south are drawn
every where at an equal distance each from other, from the Equinoctial to the
Pole; but on a globe which is made round like the earth, they are not of an
equal distance, but the more northerly they come, so much the nearer they come
each to other. So that two strokes from north to south at the latitude of 60
degrees, are but half so wide from one another, as they are at the
Equinoctial, and at the Pole they touch each other. Therefore two ships being
under the Equinoctial distant from one another two hundred leagues, they may
both sail directly north without hinderance, coming to the height of 60 gr.
but being 100 leagues from each other, and that following the same course, they
would in the end meet each other under the pole, but if you direct such two
ships by a plain Card, they will be always at equal distance, by which it
sufficiently appears, that all places lying far north, are much too wide,
unless they be drawn in, which cannot be done, but you must make other
places more faulty.



The 34 Point. How many miles or leagues you must sail on every point of the
compass before you shall get a degree in breadth of the land.
WHen you sail right south or right north on any one point of the compass, as
from A to B or C, you sail for a degree 15 leagues. And you stay under the
same Meridian. On the point north and by east, or south and by east, as from A
to D or L, you sail for a degr. 15 and a half degrees. And then you are out of
the Meridian whence you sailed, as it were from B to D 3 leagues.
Northnortheast and southsoutheast, as from A to E or M, for a degree 16
leagues. You are from the Meridian whence you sail 6 leagues as from B to E.
Northeast and by north, and southeast and by south you sail as from A to F or
N 12 leagues. You shall be without the same line as from B. to F. 10 leag.
Northeast and southeast, you sail for a degree as from A to G or O 21 leagues.
You are then off the north and south line whence you sail as it were from B to
G or C O 15 leagues. Northeast and by east and southeast and by east, as from A
to H or P for a degree 27 leagues. You are then out of the first Meridian, as
from B to H, or C P 22 leagues. Eastnortheast or eastsoutheast, you sail for a
degree as from A to I or Q 39 and a half league. You shall be out of the
Meridian, as from B to I or from C to Q 36 leagues. East and by north or east
and by south, as it were from A to K or R you sail for a degree 77 leagues and
a half Then are you out of the Meridian, as from B to K, or from C to R. 75
leagues. East or West, as from A to S, you remain between the Pole and
Equinoctial on the self same breadth of the earth or land.
The 35. Point. Of variation of the Compass, and how you shall find the turning
aside of the needle or variation.
THe needle or the style under the Compass, touched with the Lodestone,
draws to diverse places diversely, in some places directly to the north, in
other places it wendeth to the east, and in other toward the west; As for
Example, at the Islands of Corvo and Flores) the most western of the Flemish
Islands. At Helmshuy a little on the west side of the north Cape. About 30
leagues westwards from the south corner of Spitsburg, on the east side of the
Cape of good Hope, at Cabo das Aguilhas, and at other places, as well in the
East as in the West Indies, the needle directs you just north. Westwards from
the Flemmish Islands on the east side of the Cape, at Nova Zembla, on the coast
of Spitsburgh, and on the east side of Cape das Aguilhas on ^ll the Indian Sea,
it stands from the north Westwards, and in the east side of the Flemmish
Islands, on the west side of the Cabo de Bona Esperance and other places more,
it stands from the north eastwards. The variation of the needle is twofold,
to wit, from the north to the west, and from the north to the east, and the
south are again of two sorts, the increasing and decreasing westward, in like
sort the increasing and decreasing eastwards: The increasing eastward and
westward, is, as you sail from east to the west, increasing and diminishing,
that which decreaseth, may he plainly understood by this Example.

1 Example.
If you sail from the Islands Corvo and Flores, where the needle stands right
eastward on the coast of Spain, the needle begins by little and little so
much the more) to wind toward the east, until you have sailed the Strait of
Gibraltar, where it is at the highest (as they hold) 13 gr. that is increasing
northeastering.

From thence sailing along the Middle-lands Sea, it begins to decrease,
until you come at the place, called the Mouth of the Venetian Gulf, where it
vanishes, and the needle again draws directly north, this they call
decreasing north eastering.

2 Example.
If you sail from the Cabo das Aguilhas (where the needle stands directly
north) eastwards to the Indies the needle begins to decline from the north
toward the west, until you come a little on the east side of the Island S.
Brandaon, where it is at the height of 22 gr. or two whole strokes that is
increasing northwestering.

Sailing from thence, you begin to decrease, till you are at the south point of
Celebes, where again the needle draws right, this is called decreasing
northwestering.

For the common navigation from this Country to the east, north, England,
France, or Spain the styles (to direct the Lilly right north) set fast under
the rose, about two third parts from the stroke, from the north to the east.
The stretching and course of the one Country toward the other in the common
Cards, are drawn by such a Compass, so that you may sail it without altering
of the Compass or shaking any other reckoning or account.

In great journies, when the needle declineth sometime to the west, and
sometime to the east, a stroke or two, or more, it is necessary to observe it
sharply, over what side, and how much it stands from the north, that you may
be certain, what course you shall hold in sailing.

To find the declining of the Compass, that is, how much the lilly stands to
the east or to the west, seek first the just north (that by it you may know the
declining) thus make a box quadrangle, or four cornered, and reasonable deep,
as it follows A B C D E F G, in the midst of it under in a glass let the
Compass swim on a pin, so that it be round about at an equal distance
from the box, as S T, divide that on the outermost corner of the Rose into
four times ninety degrees, and lay the needle just under it, even as in the
Compass that you follow in sailing. Within on the one side of the box, which
we call the north side, make a sharp coper or brazen corner or edge, just in
the midst between A and D, lifted upon the side A D, so that the compass may
pass close by it without let, as H, without on the south side B C F G, at the
under corner make a little beam, as F G, about half an inch broad at the
upper-edge, in each side make a hole at I and K, both equally distant from the
flat B C F G, at the under corner make a little beam, as F G, from the one to
the other a right line which may be plainly seen, as I K; at the upper-edge
in the midst between B C, make a pin as long as the underbeame, like L,
and just so far as the line I K on the beam stands from the flat, just so
far make from the flat a scoach in the foresaid pin L, after that make a
string or a smooth cord fast to each end in the foresaid holes of the little
beam as at I K, and with the midst of the foresaid pin at V, so that the
string being stretched hard, may stand at an equal distance from the flat in
all places B C F G, from the point L make a half circle, a little lifted out
of the flat, as M D N, so that the line M N be equally distant at all points
with the upper-edge of the box, or the beam and the line L O (deviding the
half circle into two quadrants) square right on I K, divide the half circle
at the inner corner in twice ninety degrees.

Lastly, make a ring of brass or wood as P Q R, that you may hang the box on
it, that the uppermost flat A B C D may hang Water-compasse, the south side B C
F G, and the edges B F C G, and the Line L O just in the lead, this being thus
prepared, the use follows.

Three or four hours before noone, more or less you shall turn the corner C
G, toward the Sun, so that the shadow of the one side of the string L K may
fall right along the lide, K I, and then look the degree of the Compass which
comes to stand by the brazen edge H, which I suppose to be the 30 degrees of
north and by West, as in the second Figure following at A. At the same instant,
you shall observe the height of the Sun at the shadow of the pin L, in
half circle M O N, or you shall take it more truly and certainly with the
cross staff or Astrolabe, that which we take here to be 25 gr. we set it
down for memories sake. Further you shall stay so long in the afternoon,
until the Sun be come to the same height of 25 gr. then turn the edge B F,
just against the Sun, so that the shadow of the side of the string L I may
fall right along the line I K, and look what degree of the compass comes to
stand by the coper or brazen edge H, which I suppose to be the 30 gr. for the
north, toward the east, as on B, this being so in the midst of the circle A
B, as at C, is the north point which you desire, and if the Lilly be directed
right to it, then has that compass no variation, but directs right north.
But if your taking aforesaid in the afternoon be not fouud the thirtieth, but
the fiftieth degree from the north toward the east, as at D, in such a cause
you shall devide the circle A D, being 80 gr. at E, into two parts, so that A E
and E D may each of them contain 40 gr. which being so, E will be the north
point, and such a compass turns from the north to the west from E to C 10
gr. which is very near a whole stroke. But if in the foresaid taking in the
afternoon the coper or brazen edge has stood 10 gr. on the West side of the
Lilly or flour deluce, as at F, then you must devide the circle A F, containing
20 into two parts at G; so that A G and G F might each of them contain ten
degrees, which being so, G will be the north point, and the Lilly of such a
compass windeth toward the east from the north 20 gr, namely from C to G, and
thus it will be in all other figures. This is to be observed: that you may
take the height before the noon twice, thrice, four times or more, at diverse
heights of the Sun; As for Example: The first time when the Sun is at the
height of 10 gr. the second time at the height 15 gr. the third at 20 gr. and
in the afternoon at the same height and by comparing the one taking with the
other, you shall find how they agree each with other, thus finding always the
same north point, you shall be certain that you have taken it truly and right.

Of the Tides.
IT is known to all experienced Mariners that the ebbing and flowing of the
sea is governed by the Moon, so that every new and full Moon the waters are
higher which they call spring-tydes, and at the quarter of the Moon the waters
are lowest: so that you may know and that certainly by former observation,
(although the true and real cause thereof is yet hidden from us) the hour of
the tide, and on what point or stroke the Moon makes high water in any
particular place, to the great profit and furtherance of navigation.

To know on what stroke the Moon is, it may be done in a twofold manner, by
the sight, or by marking how old the Moon is; to look at some stroke of the
Compass, it may not be done according to the common Compass lying flat or
driving water Compass, because the Horizon divides only into equal strokes,
and shows in what virticall Circle or Azimuth the Sun or Moon stands,
but by a compass that (being lifted up) according to the Superficial part of
the Equinoctial, devideth the Equinoctial in equal parts, as the common
flatt two driving does the Horizon; such an Equinoctial compass is made in
this manner as you see in this figure: where the roundell A B C shows the
flatt of the Equinoctial, the gnomen E D the axeltree of the world. The
foresaid rondel in B marked on both sides, in the inside with the Compass, and
on the edge of the outside with twice 24 hours and in the east and west at L
and M hanging on two pinnes as it were on an axeltree, so that these being
turned up and down, and the gnomen set and the nether end by D and by the
Quadrant F D G, that you may place him at the height of any pole.

If you set such a compass with the bottom water compass, the line H K just
north and south, to wit, H to the north and K to the south, and the lower end
of the gnomen by such a degree of the Quadrant F C, according to the height of
the Pole where you are: there will the roundell A B C, stand even with the
surface of the true Equinoctial, and the gnomen E D with the axeltree of the
world.

The sight on such a Compass, and a common one, differs very much, and by
how much nearer the Equinoctial so much more will the difference be, as will
appear by this example following.

The first Example.
On the height of 50 gr. or thereabout, the Sun being in the beginning of
Cancer in the greatest northerly declination, it is on a common Compass east
at half an hour past seven, and west at half an hour past four, that is:
he goes from the east to the west through the south in nine hours, but from
the west through the north to the east in 15 hours.

The Second Example.
At the height of 30 degrees, he comes little before half an hour past nine
at the east, and a little after half an hour past two to the west, and so it
goes in less then five hours and a half from the east through the south
into the west, but from the west through the north to the east he goes more
then 18 hours.

The third Example.
The Dragonshead being in the beginning of Aries, and the Moon in the
beginning of Cancer, they make 5 gr. more declination than the Sun, and go to
the foresaid height of 30 gr, more then an hour sooner from the east to the
west, then the Sun, to wit, about the space of 4 hours, and again from the
west to the east about the space of 2 hours.

Under the line, the Sun having no declination, rises in the morning in the
east, and rising remains east until he comes to the Zenith and passes
that to the west, and abides so descending west, till he approaches the
Horizon and is according to a flatt driving compass, the one half of the day
east, and the other west, without coming on any other stroke; but it is not so
on such an Equinoctial compass. The Sun and Moon both going always in the
same distance of time over every stroke, to wit, from the east to the south in
six hours, and from the south to the west in six hours, and again from the
west through the north in twice six hours.

The first Example.
Under the Line, the Sun being in the Equinoctial, I set the end of the
gnomen E directly north, the other end D to the south at the upper-edge of the
Quadrant at G on O, the gnomen E D shall lie water Compass, like the axeltree
of the world, and the roundell right in the lead upright like the true
Equinoctial there. The Sun com^ing above the Horizon, the shadow of the
gnomen ^^all direct you to the sixth hour in the east, for the rising, but if
he rise beyond the edge of the roundell, and devideth that in the same time
into equal parts with the shadow, being 45 gr. above the Horizon, the shadow
of the gnomen will direct you to the 9 hour in the south, being ^ome into the
Zenith, the shadow shall fall just on the ^ead at the twelfth hour in the
south, again 45 gr. that is, ^escending half way the west, the shadow shall
be at the ^^ird hour in the afternoon in the southwest, but co^ing to the
Horizon the shadow shall fall on the sixth ^oure in the west.

As this is spoken of the Sun, the same must be under^^ood of the moon in as
much as concerns the points (...) strokes af the Compass.

To reckon by the age of the moon, we have set in the table following under
every stroke two ranks of ciphers, the first are the days of the age of the
moon, or the days past since the moon was new or at the full. The second the
hours and minutes of those days, in the which the moon comes to such a
stroke, and makes at the place standing by high water.

The Second Example.
Eight days after the moon has been new or at the full, I desire to know
when the moon comes to the south, at Embden, or Enckhuysen, and such like
places, makes high water (for there a north and a south moon makes full sea) I
seek under the north and south stroke the 8 day in the 1 column, and by that
in the second 6 hours, 24 minut. on that then shall the moon come to the
north and south at 6 hour. 24 min. and make high water in that place.

The tide 48 min. later every day, that is four or fiv^ parts of an hour,
then if you know at what hour the new or full moon make high water in any one
place, you shall reckon from that first day every day four or five parts of an
hour later, and so you shall find the just tim^ of high water or full sea in
that place.

The third Example.
When the moon is new or full, then it is at Amsterdam and Rotterdam (and
wheresoever a southwest and northeast moon makes full sea) high water at
three of the clock, a day after the new or full moon at three of the clock
24 mi. two days after at four of the klocke and 36 min. and four days after
the new or full moon at six of the clock 12 minutes.

The 37. Point. How to find the age of the Moon.
TO do this without an Almanac, you must know the Epact or Key of the year,
and that you shall find by the Golden number, and the Golden number thus:
look how many years there are past from the year of our Lord, 1500, and these
divide by 19 and what remains is the Golden number of that year, if there
remain nothing, the golden number is 19.

Example.
I desire to know the Golden number of the year 1645, setting the 1500 a side,
I devide the 145 years by 19, I find seven times, and the remainder is 12.
Then the Golden number of the year 1645. is 12.

The Golden number increases every year with the beginning of the year with
one, as in the year 1640, it is 7, 1641 it is 8. and so forth to 19, after
that again 1, 2, 3, etc. The Epact changes every year on the first of March
increasing with 11 to 30, but being more then 30, you must leave that 30 and
the remainder is the Epact. You shall find it by the golden number thus: tell
the golden number on the 3 joints of your thumme, beginning with one at the
lower joints, unto the golden number of your year proposed, if it does end
this kind of telling at the lower joint, then the Epact and the golden number
are all one: but if it end on the second joint, add 10, if on the third joint,
add 20 by the same golden number, that number is the Epact of that year.

Example.
I desire to know the Epact of the year 1645, the Golden number is 12, telling
on the joints of the thumme beginning with one at the lower joint, the telling
ends with 12 on the highest joint, adding 20 to 12, you shall have 32
substract 30 there remains 2 for the Epact of that year.

After the old style, the Golden number is the self same with the new style,
but the Epact is 10 more, therefore if you add 10 to the Epact of the new
style, you shall have the Epact of the old style, as for the year 1645, 10, to
12, (the Epact of the new style) comes 22, this is the Epact of that year
according to the old style.

But to find the Epact without telling, is the golden number to know both
according to the old and new style, look on this table following, where they
are set the one by the other.

Golden Number. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 New Epact. 1 12
23 4 15 26 7 18 29 10 21 2 13 24 5 16 27 8 19 Old Epact. 11 22 3 14 25 6 17 28
9 20 1 12 23 4 15 26 7 18 29

The Epact being known, you shall add it to the number of the months that are
past from March to the month you are in, the same month being reckoned with
it, if this brings forth 30, then is it new moon the first day of the same
month, but as much as is less then 30. so many days you have to the new moon.

Example.
In the year 1641. I desire to know when the Moon shall be new in the month of
August, the Epact of that year is 18, adding to this 6. for the number of the
months since March (the month of August being included) it makes 24, there
want 6 to make it 30, therefore the Moon shall be new 6 days at this, that is
the 6 of August.

The Epact, the number of the month past from March and the day of the month
being added, such a number, (or whatsoever it brings forth, more then 30) it
shows the age of the Moon.

The first Example.
To know the age of the Moon on the 12 of August 1645. I add the Epact 2 to 6,
the months past, and 12 for the 12 days, they make this 20, is the age of the
Moon, but this is to be understood after the new style.

To find out easily without casting up the time of the new Moon, we have here
adjoined an Almanac for 8. years next ensuing, calculated by the meridian of
Amsterdam, showing the day and hour of every new and full Moon, together with
the quarters, the use of it is thus: by the Moon in every month there are two
columns of ciphers, the first shows the day of the month, the second the
hours and minutes of the new and full Moon, to reckon from the noone of the
same day, to the noone of the day following, according to the use and custom
of Astronomers.

Example.
I would know in the year 1645, in the month of July, on what day and hour
the moon will be new, and I find the new Moon on the 22 day, 14 hours telling
from noone tide and this run to the next day in the morning at two of the clock.

To know what day of the week that will be, you must first know the Dominicall
letter of that year, and with what letter each month begins, the Sundays
letter you shall find under the Almanac of each year, the leap year has two,
the first you shall use to the 24 of February, the other to the end of the
year, every month begins with such a letter as this table following
shows: Januarie begins with A February D March D July begins with G August C
Septem. F April begins with G May B June E October begins with A November B
December E

For as much as July begins with a G, you shall begin to tell forward to 5,
and that fall out in E, that is the third day after B, the Dominicall letter of
that year, and so it will be wednesday, and so in all the other. In the Leap
year you must tell both the 24. and 25 on F, because the 25 day and 24 were
added on F.

Pascaarte vande ZUYDER-ZEE, Texel, end vlie-stroom als mede 't Amelander gat.


The first part of the New LIGHTNING SEA COLUMN, OR SEA MIRROR. THE FIRST
BOOK, Of the EASTERN NAVIGATION Containing The description of the north Sea,
the Coast of Holland, Friesland, Holstein, Iutland, Meklenburgh, and Denemarck
to Valsterboen, in the Island of Rugen, and with all the coast of Norway to
Dronten, as also the east side of England and Scotland.
The first Demonstration, Where in Are described the south Sea, the
Vliestreame, the Vlie, and the channel of Ameland.
WHen you sail from Amsterdam to the Fall of Vrck, you must keep the middle of
the channel, in sailing to Tyoort, and from thence over Pampus, Pampus.
with a shipp of great draught, that draws ten foot or more; keep Marcken
church without to the land of Udam, called Schyteldoecks-haven, so long until
that the steeple of Zuyderwouw come past Kinnigherbuert, which are the houses
half way betwixt Schyteldoecks-haven and Durgerdam, go then toward the land
e. until that the New church of Amsterdam come about Durgerdam, keep that so
standing, until that the church of Weesp be come past the House or Castle at
Muyen, so that it do stand somewhat nearer to Muyen then to the House, keep
Weesp standing so, until that Edam come without the east end of Marken. In
this farewaye it is a foot deeper, then if you sailed right through.

For to avoyde Muyen sand: men were wont to bring the houses which were wont to
stand upon Tyoort to the southwards of the Heyligher-stee at Amsterdam, thereby
you may make some reckoning, they are good longst marks: when Monnickedam is
about the west end of Schyteldoecks-haven, and the house at Muyen betwixt Weesp
and the church at Muyen, then are you thwart of Muyen sand. For to sail right
through over Pampus, then keep the steeple of Diemen over or about the point
of Tyoort, so long as you can see Tyoort, that is a right longst mark for to
sail over Pampus.

When you are come thwart of the east end of Marken, go then on northeast, or
somewhat more eastwardly toward the Fall of Urck, which is 7 leagues: when you
are come with in a great league of Urck, you shall meet with a hard sand, The
Houtribbe.
called the Houtribbe, lying southeast and northwest thwart over the Farewaye,
there is no more water upon it, then upon the Flat of Wieringen, or of
Freesland, you shall find alsoo no deeper water there then eight through. When
Enckhuysen lies northwest and northwest and by west from you, then you are
upon the Houtribbe. Before that you come against the sand, you can by night see
the fire upon Urck. When as Urck or the fire is more northerly then northeast
from you, and that you get shoaling, then that is certainly of the Houtribbe:
for so you cannot come too near the Enckhuysen sand. When you come from the
southwards, you are not about the Enckhuysen sand before that the church upon
Urck come without the little village of houses, which is then east and by
south, and east southeast from you: if that then you go away northwest and by
west or westnorthwest you shall run close along by the side of the sand.
With a ship of great draught, bring the church a good way through the houses,
until that it stand eastsoutheast from you, then go bouldly on northwest and
by west or keep Medenblick without the point of the Ven, and so you shall not
come too near neither to sand nor shoale. Likewise if you come from the
northwards, and bring Urck not more eastwardly then eastsoutheast from you,
Marks of Enckhuysen sand.
then you cannot take hurt also of the Enckhuysen sand. From Urck to the buys
upon the Cripple and Hof-stede, the course is northwest and by west with that
course you may run all along unto the souther buy upon Wieringhe^ Flat: in
turning to windwards, you may well bring Medenblick a little within the point
of the Ven, but when as Medenblick is without it, then you are in the right
fareway.

Betwixt Urck and the buy upon the Hofstede northeast somewhat eastwardly from
the steeple of Enckhuysen lies a little plate of hard sand, lying toward the
end of Enckhuysen sand, which is not deeper then the Frees Flat, about to the
eastwards of it, is the deepest water, but about to the westwards of it (by
some called the Katte-gar) you shall be sooner about the High horn, or the
Enckhuysen sand, and it is good for ships that draw but little water.

The thwart marks of the buys, Marks of the buys upon the Hof-stede and
Cripple
both upon the Cripple and Hosstede; are Grootebroeck and Hem (two sharp
steeples) right one in the other, and Warnis, a little sharp steeple in
Freesland to the south side of the Cliffe of Staverne, then you have the length
of these buys, which lie each of them in three fathom, the one on the east
shore, and the other on the west shore upon the tail of the Cripple. There
is in the right fare way, two foot less then five fathom, and soft ground.
When the steeple of Medenblick comes to the northwards of the house of
Medenblick, so far as the house is broad, then you are clear of Cripple
sand, and past it; go then on northwest, and northwest and by north to the
buy upon the Creyl, according as the wind and tide shall be, the right
farewaie there, is deep 5 fathom scarce. Thwart of the Creyl, in sailing out
or about the Cryel, in sailing in, that is a little within the Creyl The Cr^yl.
on the north shore, lies along the reach (toward the buy upon the
Hosstede, a hard sand or plate, called the south Creyl, South Creyl.
upon which there is no more then twelve foot water, at low water, betwixt that
banck and the north shore, it is three fathom deep, and soft ground, and to
the southwards, or the westwards of it, four fathom and an half. When Mirnes,
a little flat steeple in Freesland, comes over a long countrie-house to the
southwards of the cliffe of Staverne, then you come right thwart of that
foresaid plate.

Mark of the Creyl.
The marks of the buy upon the Creyl, are the sharp steeple of Twisck over
the Cornemill to the westwards of Medenblick, and that little flat steeple of
Mirnes to the south side or east side of the cliffe. The right fareway there is
four fathom and an half, and five fathom deep, soft ground, the buy lies in
four fathom, if need require, men may run well a cables length about to the
eastwardes of it.

From the buy upon the Creyl, to the buy upon the Freese plate, Freese plate.
the course is north and by east: When the steeple of Twisck comes a little
to the northwards of Medenblick, then keep them so standing, so long as you
can see it; and then you shall not sail within any shoales betwixt that plate
and the Creyl.

Betwixt the buy upon the Creyl, and the Freese plate, on the west shore,
along the Reach, lies a hard sand, called Monick-sand, Monick-sand.
which men may be foul of, if they run somewhat too far over to the
westwards.

When you are come about the Creyl, you may go on north and by east (with a
ship that draws but little water) over the tail of Broad-sand, right to
the buy upon the sand, called West-worckum, but with ships of great
draughts, you must keep the right farewaye. For to find the deepest water upon
the flat: bring Pendragen, a little flat steeple (standing to the westwards
of Worckum) to the westwards of a little village, which stands alsoo to the
westwards of Worckum, and sail so right with it, that is a good longst mark
of the buy upon the Freese plate, and so you shall run right with the buy,
when as that Warnes and Mirnes come one in the other, to the northwards of
Staveren, then you have the length of the buy, which lies on the west side of
the Plate, you must run along to the westwards of it, there is the deepest
water: when you come from the northwards, you might sail within the
Freese-plate on the east shore.

Being past the foresaid buy upon the plate, go on northnortheast, until
that Pendragen come betwixt the little village and Voorwolde. If that you have
then the cliffe through Staveren, then you have the deepest water upon the
shoalest of the slatt, then men run commonly a little more norherly unto the
buy in the Bight, Buy in the Bight
and along to the westwards of it, which lies right in the farewaye, in
sixteen foot, but along to the eastwards of the buy is the deepest water,
the farther into the Bight toward Freesland the deeper. The mark of this buy,
is the little flatt steeple of Mirnes on to the southwards of Molqueren. Bring
that foresaid little slat steeple in Molqueren, and keep it so standing, and
then you come in the farewaye of the buy of West-worckum, that is a very good
mark, when the buys are taken away.

The old thwart marks of the buy in the Bight, are Mirnes* Molqueren, Hemelum,
and a little long village, when they stand in four parts. Betwixt the buys
upon the Freese plate, and in the Bight, is the shoalest of the flatt. When the
buy in the Bight is on your broad side, then go on north and by west, somewhat
more westerly, unto the buy of West-worckum, Buy of West-worckum
which lies on the east shore in 16 foot at low water, upon these marks: a
little sharp steeple, far within the land, called Harich, comes over a
little village, to the northwards of Hinlopen, called Dertwisch, the right
deep thwart of it is three fathom. The old marks are two villages next to
Mackum, upon the water side, standing northeast off from it, when these stand a
little asunder, one from the other, you see yet two little steeples somewhat to
the northwards of Bolswart, almost one to the other, near about as the other
upon the water side stand asunder, the one is called Idsegahuysen. The thwart
marks are a high house on the east end of Coudom, that comes within a
capstane bars length to the south end of Hinlopen. From thence to the buy
upon Yghelhoeck, Yghelhoeck.
the course is north, the marks there of are, a little sharp steeple with the
first long village to the northwards of Worckum, called Geest, when that little
steeple comes in the innermost swampe of that long village, then you have the
buy, that is a good thwart marck: the longst marks are, the sharp steeple of
Pingom over the flat steeple of Coorenwaert upon the waterside, and Pendragen
to a little house to the northwardes of the village with the swamp, or when the
mil of Staveren stands betwixt the town and the Block-house of Stavern,
these are all good longst marks of the buy upon Yghelhoeck.

From Yghelhoeck to the middle ground the course is north, the right deep in
the Middle ground Middle-ground.
is seven fathom in the farewaye betwixt Westworckum and Yghelhoeck the right
deep in four fathom, soft ground, the east shore is flat and the west shore
steep. The buy of the Middle ground lies upon these marks: the two sharp
steeples Arun and Pingom one in the other about northeast from you: or
Bolswaert right to the northwards of a Country house, to the northwardes of
Mackum, these are good thwart marks of the Middle-ground. The longst marks
are: kinswaert (that is the runner) comes behind the church of Surich, then
you are right in the farewaie. The Church of Surigh stands upon the water
side, upon a point that lies out about northeast and by north from the buy, or
when the flat steeple of Wynaem (to the northwards of Harlingen) comes
betwixt Midlum and the east end of Harlingen, then you are right in the
Middleground, on which side that Wynaem stands nearest, that shore you are
also nearest unto, the west shore is steep; the east shore indifferent flat,
you may run over it in three fathom, and come again in five fathom toward
Friesland. From the Middle-ground outward to the Fly, you can sail within no
tails of sand on the west shore.

Being past the buy in the Middle-ground, then go on northnorthwest unto the
buy upon Swanebalgh, Swanebalgh
which lies in 3 fathom on the east shore, the thwart marks there of are
Bolswaert over a little short house to the southwards of Cornwaert. When you
run over betwixt the buys of the Middle-ground and Swanebalgh on the east
shore more easterly then in three fathom, that you come again in four or
five fathom, you might (in sailing out) sail behind the shoals of Swanebalgh,
or when you are bound in behind the shoals of the Middleground, the west
shore thwart of this, you may sound in four fathom, or three fathom and a
half, over against the buy upon Swanebalgh, on the west shore is good ground
for to anchor in.

From the buy upon Swane-balgh to the buy upon Schuytesand Schuytesand.
the course is north w. somewhat northerly: the thwart marks there of are
Wynaem over the highest part of Harlingen: the longst marks are, Bolswaert the
northwards of the Sluys, which lies to the northwards of Woens: this buy
lies in six fathom on the east shore, upon a tail or point, which you might
sail within when you sail out, the right deep thwart of it is 7 and 8
fathom, the west shore is indifferent flat, which you may sound in 4 fathom,
the e. shore is steep, but a little without the buy it is flat all along
to Keeshoeck, and you may sound it all along unto the Sloot. In sailing up,
you might sail within the w. shore over against Schuytesand, or a little to
the southwards of it in 3 fathom, or 3 fathom and a half into a Deadbalg,
behind a tail of sand, Point of Waert.
called the point of the Waert, but keeping in 4 fathom from that shore, you
cannot take hurt of it. In sailing up with a forfloud, keep the east shore, or
else you should be lightly carried therewith into the foresaid balgh, behind that
Waert, before you should be aware of it. Upon the point of that waert stands
a drift beacon, and 2 to the northwards or the westwards of it, which men do
call the beacons of Claesoomen, and to the southwards of it stands a beacon
upon Dominicu^ plate, or (as the Pilots do name it) Meynsen plate. The marks
for to sail along this long reach are: Mack^^ with a mill upon the water
side, and a village with a li^^^e flat steeple to the southwards of Mackum,
called Idsegahuysen, when Pandragen comes betwixt M^ckum and that village
then you shall go clear of that fo esayd tail or Deadbalg: If Pandragen come
nearest to ^dsegahuysen, then you are too near the foresaid tail or plate or
if Pandragen come nearest to Mackum, then you are too near the east shore.

Keeshoec
From Schuytsand to the buy upon Keeshoeck, the course is w.n.w. or northwest
and by w. according as the wind and tide shall be. In that long reach go
little more then half tides along the deep, the afterfloud and fore-eb fall
thwart over there to the westwards, and the after-eb and fore-floud right
contrary to the eastwards. The marks of the buy upon Keeshoeck, are Franiker
steeple betwixt the mill and the town of Harlingen, or to the mastes of the
Schips which lie in the haven.

T^is buy lies on the east shore, the right farewaye thw^rt of it is 8, 9 and
ten fathom deep.

B^twixt Keeshoeck and Schuytesand, or betwixt the beakons of Claesoomen and
the point of the water lies a little narrow plate along the reach, almost
in the midst of the fareway nearest to the west shore, where upon it is not
deeper then four fathom, or 3 fathom and an h^lfe, when men turn to windewards
they are over it with 2 or 3 casts of the lead.

Westwards from the buy upon Keeshoeck lies the Old-Flye, Old-Flye.
it lies in first s.s.w. and then forth to the buy upon the Nesse in the
Tessel stream. The after flood with the fore ebb fall in very strong into this
channel. In sailing upwards you might sail within it in 4 fathom. The marks of
it are, the steeple of Franiker right to the southwards of the steeple of
Harlingen. From thence outward off unto Schieringshals the w. shore is very
steep, in eight fathom you shall be close by the shore. The fareway betwixt
these buys, and thwart of the buy upon the Ellbow^ is ten and eleven fathom
deep.

From Keeshoeck to Wolfshoeck Wolfshoeck.
the course is first northwest and northwest and by north unto the buy betwixt
them both, by some called the Schor tun and by the Pilots the buy upon the
Ellbowe: Schor tun or the buy upon the Ellbow.
and from thence to the buy upon Wolfshoeck, north, or somewhat more easterly,
which lies in four fathom on the east shore.

From the buy upon Wolfshoeck unto the buy unto Schieringshals Sch^eringshals.
the course is northnorthwest, and north w. and by north according as the wind
and tide shall be. To the northwards or to the eastwards of the buy upon
Wolfshoecke goes up a broad bight southeast far into the grounds, so deep
as the right farewaie, called the Inschot, The Inschot.
coming in you might sail within in seven fathom, the forefloud falls from
Schieringshals very strong into it, and the fore ebb to the contrary, very
strong out of it upon the tail of Schieringshals, where by maine ships are
miscarried.

Schieringshals is a tail of sand, which shoots off from the west shore,
upon it lies a white buy in three or four fathom, coming in from without,
men might sail within it in six fathom, the right deep betwixt Wolfshoeck
and Schieringshals is nine fathom.

From Schieringshals to Longsand, Longsand
the course is northwest, and northwest and by north, betwixt them both on the
w. shore it is shallow water, and the best road of all the Fly stream, there
goes also little tide. The right deep is eight, nine and ten fathom, Longsand
men might sail within it on the east shore, in sailing up, but if they keep
themselves in 7 or 8 fathom, they shall not come too near neither of Longesand
nor Schieringshals. When the eastermost house upon Grindt comes a little to
the northwards of the westermost, then you have even the length of the buy
upon Longsand. From Longsand to the Sloot the course is forth northnorth w. the
right deep is ten fathom, Moncksloot.
or men run along by the beakons upon Crakesand until they come into the
Sloot.

The Island Flyeland is three leagues long, and a land very easy to be known:
upon the east end lie high white sand-hilles, and to the westwards it is a land
full of short low hommocks or knobbs. Upon the west end stands a Church with a
mill to the eastwards of it. From the w. end shoots off a riffe a good ways
into sea. To the westwards of this riffe, betwixt Flyeland and the Eyerland
goes in a deep, called the Westergat, or Westfiel deep, which is not for
great ships, but only for Fisher boats, there is not above 8 or 10 foot
water. Upon the east end stands a mill with a Cape, the which are marks for
to avoid the grounds which lie before the Fly.

The east end of Flyeland, and the west end off Tessel lie eight leagues
asunder.

Eastwards from Vlieland lies der Schelling, der Schelling.
and is about three leagues long. Upon it stand two Churches and upon the west
end thereof it has an high stubbed tower called Branda^ies and by it stands
a Mill, about the middle of the land stands a sharp steeple called Midlands.
East thereof stands another Spire steeple, called the Hoorn: between
Midland, and the Hoorn stands a mill. On the east end there lie little hills
or downs. Upon the west end stands a Light-house upon which there is fire at
night, and two Capes, the biggest serves as a Mark of the eastern Booms
channel and the least for the western Booms-channel.

Stortemelck.
To sail into Stortemelck (that is the Landdeep of Vlieland bring the Cape
that is on the east end of Vlieland and the Lighthouse together, they shall
then stand from you southsoutheast or a little easterly, sail there upon, and
you shall fall right upon the first buy, that lies in five fathom, on the
outermost of the long Bank, the Bank is on the northside reasonable plain,
so that those who come out of the north may run thereby upon the lead in five
or six fathom, and so likewise find the outermost Buy. If need require men may
run over the end of the long bank, but n^^ too far eastwards of the outermost
buy in three ^^^^om or eighteen foot, toward the shore though not eastwards
of the second Buy but a good way westwards, lies right southwards the point of
another small tail, whereupon near the buy is no more then eleven foot
water, between this tail and the long bank runs a Chopp in the ground to
the eastwards off five fathom deep. It happens sometimes that ships
coming over the end of the Long bancke and finding again deeper water, do
think themselves to be in the right depth of Stortemelck, where upon they
luffe but run in the foresaid Chopp in betwixt the two foresaid tails, and
if with a westerly wind not without great danger, and yet must run out again
backwards. Coming out of the west along by Vlieland in four or five fathom,
you shall not miss to run the foresaid outermost buy in sight: He that in the
night falls about Stortemelek let him bring the lighthouse southsoutheast
from him, and run there upon till he come nearer the shore he shall run to
the westwards of the outermost buy, within Stortemelck there lie 7 black buys
with one white buy, sailing in leave all the black on the larboard and run
along the southwards, leave the white on the starboard, even as al other
white buys as well in Booms channel, the letting as upon the Vliestream.

In coming from Stortemelck you must somewhat shun the shore for it has a
shoale right over against the first buy.

The second Buy called the outtermost Drooge dry lies on eleven foot upon
the ridge or the shoalest of the channel south thereof is alsoo not more then
11 foot water, and a little further again 16 foot deep. The third is called
the innermost Drooge dry lies on 16 foot the right depth between both is 3
fathom. The fourth is called Heyckhoeck, between this and the third the right
depth is in five fathom, over against the fourth lies the white Buy on the
strand, hard by runs a little tail from the shore, which you may under
sail when you sail outward to this white Buy, or to the third from without
it stretches eastnortheast in, from the fourth to the fifth almost east, and
further more and more southerly. The fifth buy is called the outtermost corner
buy, the sixth the middlemost corner Buy, and the seventh or last the innermost
corner buy, betwixt the outtermost and middlemost corner buy, the next
outtermost runs a tail from the shore which you may under sail from
without, this grows sometimes almost as far as the Buy, then breaks the
depth by the wall again through and scoures the tail wholly to the north
shore from the innermost buy men run forth along by the strand of Vlieland,
or southward to the buy upon the plate.

The eastern Booms Channel.
To sail into the eastern Booms Channel Coming out of sea or from the
westwards; bring the Cape on the Schelling and the tower of Brandaries
together, they shall then stand south from you, and south and by east run there
upon and you shall find the outermost buy without the Channel in sea upon 4
and a half and 5 fathom, right without and eastwards the outermost point of
the steep grounds they are without upon the northside so steep that you are
hard by them in 12 and 13 fathom, upon them, remains not more then 5 foot
water hard by to the westwards of the foresaid Cape stands a lighthouse where
upon there is light every night. Coming by night out of the east you must hold
the stroke of the shore, and you may run along there by in three fathom till
the fire be right against you, and so still further upon three fathom till you
come to Heyhoeck then is the fire almost east and east and by north from you,
there get you deeper water In four fathom you man run without about the steep
grounds. The eastern Booms Channel is very hard to be sailed in by an
unxeperienced man, it is full of wandering grounds even as by Oesel. The
foreflood falls eastnortheast thwart over the Channel till almost half
flood, before it draws right inwards, contrariwise the fore ebb falls also
westsouthwest thwart over the Channel, till almost half ebb before it
falls right out, therefore it is best with a northeast or easterly wind and
fore ebb. A little eastwards of the Cape and the tower get the east shore,
and so run along thereby upon three fathom, this is clean and flatt wholly
till within Cape and the Tower. The second buy lies within the outtermost
point of the steep grounds, distant from the first about southwest and by
west, the steep grounds are so steep on the end that it is very near it 18
foot deep the east shore is flatt going up, and dries by little and little
from 18 to 16, 14 and 12 foot. Eastwards the second buy the fareway is three
fathom deep, and to the westwards it is five fathom, but not wide, therefore
you may not run too far westwards you should be very suddenly with a fore
ebb upon them they are likewise within very steep. The east shore you may
run so near upon your lead as you will, only with a storm the sea breaks
thereupon quite to the second buy. The second, third, fourth, and fifth buy lie
all upon a row one from another, to wit, southwest and northeast, the third on
the east coast though you may go there a little more eastwards about, the east
coast is there most flatt, and the fareway westwards of the buy seven fathom
deep. The fifth called the buy upon Heyhoeck lies also on the east shore but
nearer then the third in five fathom, these may you also sail to the eastwards
but not far, the fareway westwards these is 7, 8 and 9 fathom deep, till you
come past this buy, you may from without sail in along by the east coast
upon your lead, also by night or dark weather, from thence inwards it is wide
and broad. From Heyhoeck you must sail to Robbegat. Upon the north side of the
Robbegat upon the point of the dry plate stands a beak on in the middle of
Robbegat next the dry plate lies a small shoale; before upon the shoale on the
point in the coming in lies a buy, betwixt that buy or the small shoale and
the foresaid Beacon is the deepest water but you must run in hard by the Beakon
that so you may not be deceived with the stream which falls thwart over the
dry plate below and between this small shoale and the Rosyne plate it is
wider, and the Robbegat stretiches in southwest and southwest and by w. Being
through the Robbegat, run to the strand of Vlieland, and along somewhat near
thereby.

The Western Booms Channel.
To sail into the western Booms Channel coming from the west, bring the
Cape and tower of Brandaries together, that is then east and east and by south
from you, thereupon you must run to find the outermost buy, there is six fathom
water, keep then the Cape and tower so standing till you come to the second
buy bring then the tower a great handspikes length to southwards the Cape and
sail thereupon then you shall sail betwixt a white and black buy, there is it
upon the shoalest 17 foot with low water, from thence you come to six and
seven fathom, and then you come again in the right Booms Channel, on the
northwall it is the deepest, it is wide and broad that you could well vere it
up, the stream runs there of it self right in in still weather.

To sail into the letting, The letting.
coming through the Robbegat, about the Rosyne plate, you must run toward the
buy upon Langesant and forth between the white and black buy, leaving in
sailing up the black on the larboard and the white on the starboard till you
come by the beacons upon the Nakens, you may easly see from buy to buy, sail
then forth along by the Beakons upon the Nakens e.s.e. on till Brandaries
comes hard by Grind but not upon it keep them so standing, and run
southwards on and you shall sail upon the buy on the tail of Hendryck 't
Iaerts plate, these you may under sail on the e. side, Leave them on your
larboard, and run on west away southsoutheast to the last Buy that lies upon
the south point of the foresaid Hendryck 't Iaerts plate. Over against the
Beakons upon the Nakens lie on the southwall two white buys, the most easterly
lies upon the tail which sailing off you may undersayle southwards between
the two last black buys by the west coast is the Ro^de where the ships (which
are bound to Harlingen) set on to lighten.

NOTE.
All the depths here before rehearsed, as well of Stortemelck as of the
Boomkens-gat, are said of the lowest water, at half flood is three foot
deeper, it flows upon these at the foresaid places with a common tide 5 and
an half or 6 foot up and down. The numbers of the depths set down in the
card of the Fly and Ameland-gat, are to be understood of feet: as for
example, by the outer buy of the Boomkens gat stand 66, that are 66 foot, or
eleven fathom, six foot being reckoned for a fathom.

Ameland-gat.
Two leagues to the eastwardes of the Schelling lies Ameland, lying
eastnortheast and westsouthwest four great leagues. Upon the west end of
Ameland stands a Cape, and a great thick flat steeple, called the Hoelme, the
roof of this Church is broken off, but the after front with the roof stands
above the side walls, to the eastwards of the Church of Hoelm stands a mill,
with a house to the westwards of the mill, alsoo a broad flat tower. About the
place where Midlan-church was wont to stand, lie three or four white
sandhilles, which are low, flat, and long, toward the east end it is knobbie
land, with white amongst it. From the west end of Ameland runs off a riff,
almost three leagues into sea, called Born-rif, Born-riffe
which is upon the outer side ver^e steep: come no nearer it then in 12 fathom,
coming from the eastwards you cannot sail within it, but in sailing along
by it in seven fathom, you shall not run a bowls cast along without it.

For to sail into Ameland-gat, coming out of the sea, bring the cape upon the
east end of the Schelling, right over the steeple of Horn, which shall then
stand from you southsouthwest or a little more westerly, sail in right with
them, until that the Cape upon Ameland, and the steeple of Hoelme are one over
the other, then leave the first marks, and sail in upon the second, and you
shall find the outermost buy, which lies somewhat within the outermost point
of Born-riff. Coming from the westwards, run along by the strand of the
Schelling in five, or five fathom and an half at low water, and you shall not
fail to sail right upon the outermost buy, and then the C. and steeple upon
Ameland shall also come one over the other, and stand from you east, or a
little more southerly. Coming along by the Schelling in four fathom, you
shall not sail within the Koggedeeps ground, Kog deep g^ounds.
over against then lies the first buy on the south side of Bornerif, run
along to the southwards of it, keeping the Cape and steeple one over the
other, until you be past the second buy, which lies thwart of the west end
of Kamper sand, K^mpersand.
the farewaye betwixt these two buys is five and six fathom deep.

Being past the second buy, bring the steeple somewhat to the northwards of
the Cape, and go on east n.e. toward the third buy upon Gerritshonden,
Gerritshonden.
for to avoid the plate which lies off from the south side, toward
Bornriff, on it lie two white buys, the first over against the a foresaid
third black buy, the other over against the fourth black buy, lying from the
third about southeast, leave the black buys all on the larboard side, and the
white on the starboard side, and run through so betwixt them both, the plate is
on the north side ^^different flat, so that you may run to it upon the lead,
reckon well your tides, especially be careful of a fore-ebbe, which falls
very strong over that channel northnorthwest into sea over Bornriffe. Betwixt
the second and third buy in the fareway it is eight and nine fathom. Betwixt
the third and the foresaid plate seven fathom. Being past the fourth buy, both
sides are very steep, and the fareway eight, nine, ten, and twelve fathom
deep, go then in southsoutheast, until that the steeple of Holm come over
the south point of Ameland where the boats lie, and then you come in the bight,
where it is on the s. side flat, and good anchoring in 5 or 6 fathom, the north
shore is very steep.

For to sail further into Horsen, go away from the bight eastnortheast along
by the south side in five or six fathom, so long until Heynooms chamber (being
a red tyled house) come a handspikes length to the northwards or to the
eastwards of Hoelm-church, anchor there in five or six fathom, you shall lie
there in good ground, and sheltred for all winds, also there goes little tide;
in this fareway it is twelve fathom deep, the north shore is there very
steep. These foresaid depths (like as also those of the Fly) are said of low
water.

Of the tides.
At Amsterdam a northeast and s.w. moon makes the highest water.

At Horn, Enckhuysen, and at Urck, a north and south moon.

Betwixt Cripple-sand, and the Creyl, a n. and by w. and s. and by e. moon.

Upon the Frieze and Wieringer flat, a n.w. and s.e. moon.

In the Fly and Amelandgat a southeast and n.w. moon makes high water, before
the Fly the flood falls to the eastwards thwart over the grounds, almost
until half flood before it sets into Boomkens gat. Likewise the Ebb to
the contrary falls to the westwards thwart over the grounds, almost until
half Ebb, before it sets right out at the channel. The afterflood turns
about with the fore ebb and fall along Flyeland out at Stortemelck, but the
foreflood runs right into Stortemelck.

Of the depths about these places and in what depths men may see the land.
The Islands Flyeland, the Schelling, and Tessel, men may see in 15 and 16
fathom. Thwart of the Schelling the ground is white sand.

The steep grounds or Petersand and Born-riffe, are very steep on the off
side, close by them it is 12 or 13 fathom deep.

Ameland men may see in 12 fathom, the depth of 13 and 14 fathom runs far
off to seawards, so that men cannot see it in 15 fathom.

Courses and Distances.
From the Fly to the Naes, n. and by e. a little easterly about 85 leagues.
From the Fly unto the Riffe in 16 fathom n. and by e. 66 or 67 leagues. From
Fly to Boevenbergen, the course is n.n.e. or a little more easterly about 69
leagues. From the Fly to Rinkopper, or Numer-deep, n.n.e. or a little more
easterly about 58 leagues. From the Fly to the Island Silt, on the coast of
Iutland, the course is northeast 46 leagues From Born-riffe to the Naes, the
course is north or a little more easterly 82 leagues. From Born-riffe to Holy
Land, northeast and by east 30 leagues. From Born-riffe to Wrangher-oogh,
eastnortheast 27 leagues. From Born-riffe to the Wester-Eems 12 leagues.
Peter-sand, or the steep grounds and Born-riffe, lie n.e. and by e. and
southwest and by west four leagues asunder.

From the Fly to the n.e. end of the Broad fourteens, the course is w.n.w. 8
leagues. From the Fly to Tinmouth or Newcastle, westnorthwest 88 leagues. From
the Fly to Hitland, the course is n.w. and by north, somewhat northerly 156
leagues. From the Fly to Fairehill; northwest and by north about 151 leagues.
From the Fly to Scuytenes, the course is north and by w. somewhat northerly
106 leagues.
How these Lands do show themselves at sea.
Thus shows the Schelling when you sail along by it about two leagues from
the Land.
Thus shows Flyeland when you are two leagues thwart off from it.
Ameland shows it self thus, when you are two leagues thwart off from it.


The second Demonstration, Where in The Scholbalgh, Lauwers, both the Eemses,
the Weser, the Elve, and the Eyder, and other channels of the Sea between them.
SChiermonck-oogh Schiermonck-oogh.
lies from the east end of Ameland east somewhat northerly 3 leagues, it is a
little low plain Island, about 2 leagues long, there stands no special
thing upon it to be known, but upon the west end two capes, with a white
sand-hill, otherwise it is all with low blackish sand-hils, or hommocks, (but
higher then upon the east end) and mingled with white: the east end is a long
flat strand, with little low rough sand-hills. When you bring the two capes
upon the west end one in the other, and run so in, you shall find the
outermost buy, which lies without the channel, at sea, in 7 fathom, or there
abouts. Sometimes there lie two and sometimes three buys in the channel,
which you must leave on the starboardside, and run along to the eastwards
of them, being come within the channel, you shall find also beacons on the w.
shore, which you must follow all along, until you come to Ostmerhorn, where
you may anchor. The lying in, and depths of that channel do alter and shift
oftentimes, and sometimes much within a short time, so that there is no
certainty to be written off it, where unto men might trust.

Four leagues to the eastwards of Schiermonckoogh, lies the Island Rottum,
Rottum.
and betwixt them the little Island the Bosch. A few years past through,
setting off spyrie grass or heath, there was grown two or three handsome
sand-hils, but are now again altogether blown away, and altered into a plain
flat strande, which the sea at high floods does altogether run over.

Betwixt these Islands the Bosch and Schiermonckoogh was wont to go in a
channel of indifferent depth, called the Lawers, which is now most cast too,
by the foresaid strand of the Bosch, which is grown in all along unto the
oogh, so that there is no more remaining, then a narrow and shoale creek.

To the eastwards of the Bosch goes in the Schille, also an altering and
uncertain channel, which is sometimes deep, and sometimes again shoale, and
the channel shifteth too and again, so that there is no certainty to be
written of it, whereunto men might trust.

The Island Rottum is a little Island, about a league and half long, and very
easy to be known, the west end is high and steep, the rest is low land with
some little sand-hills. Upon the east end stand two capes, the greatest or the
runner stands upon the e. end upon the flat strand, the smallest on the south
side of the sand-hill. There stand also two houses upon it, the one upon the
west end, the other in the middst of the Island in a valley.

Borckum Borckum.
is also an Island easy to be known, two great leagues long, it arises
commonly, when you come in out of the sea) in three parts, as if it were three
Islands, when you come from the westwards, it shows it self in four parts,
for with high floods the water runs through in 3 places. The Worcester. Counsel
of Embden has caused to be set upon the west end a high thick steeple, which
men may see far off at sea, on the west side of that steeple stands a little
low church.

From the west end of Borckum shoots off a riffe, a great ways into sea,
called Burckum riffe: To the southwards of it, to wit betwixt Borckum and
Rottum, goes in the wester-Eems, which is the very best channel that lies
in all this coast.

The Old or western Eems.
Bring the Capes upon Rottum together, and they shall then stand southeast and
somewhat more easterly, if you come out of the sea, sail resolutely upon them,
then shall you find the outermost Buy, then shall you have the Tower of Borckum
e. and more southerly from you, and the west end of Rottum southeast and by
south and lies upon the tail of Geltsacks plate, Geltsacks-plate.
there is a white buy with a little flagge and lies upon 6 fathom with low
water and is marked in the Card with the letter a.

From the first to the second, the course is southeast and by south, is marked
with letter b, and is the first black buy upon 7 fathom on the south shore,
let this buy in your sailing in lie on your starboard, and the white on your
larboard, then have you from this foresaid black buy, the tower upon Borckum
east and the Capes upon Rottum southeast and by e. from you, from the first
black buy to the second, third, and fourth buy marked with the letters, c, d,
e, your course is east and by south.

Coming from the w. near the Lauwers or Bossandt, keep the stroke of the
shore upon 5 fathom, till you are past it, sail then freely eastwards on, so
shall you run within through Geltsack plate in five, four, and three fathom,
afterward on eight fathom, and so come by the fourth black buy which lies
in four fathom.

The Borckummer riffe Borckummer riffe.
comes on from without and is flatt on the end, when as the Capes upon Rottum
stand southeast off then come you over the riffe, and shall come upon the tail
of the riff with low water with less then 7 dutch else depth of water for it
is flat and broad, on the inner side it is very high and steep, and shootes
with a breast inwards but you may cast your lead well upon it.

From the fourth buy till within the bending of Rottum the course is
eastsoutheast is marked with f, and lies upon 7 fathom, from this to the buy
upon the high plate and is the sixth buy marked with g, and lies upon 7
fathom, as also to the Huyberts buy h, the course is east and by south when the
Cape upon the south side and the tower come together they stand southsouthwest
from one another, so are you even with the outtermost Huyberts buy, go then
eastsoutheast on to the innermost Huyberts buy marked with i, which lies also
even as the first Huyberts buy in 6 fathom, upon the west side of these buys
you have Huyberts plate which is now divided from Huyberts sand and you may
under sail it with low water, and is in the fareway 12, 13 and 14 fathom
deep, from the innermost Huyberts buy marked with i, to the buy before the
watt, called Steven Ianss buy Steven Ian^s buy.
marked with k, the course is southeast and lies on 8 fathom k, coming
along by the buy on Huyberts plate, you must leave Borckum a little that so
you may shun the Mieuwen tail Mieuwen tail.
which shoots from off the wolds or the south end of Borckum this you may
under sail upon 5 fathom when you come inwards.

Westwards from Steven Ianss buy stand 5 beakons a little to the southwards
there goes the watt (...) north and by east almost as far from Steven Ianss
buy as the innermost Huyberts buy lies from Steven Ianss buy there shoots
out also an out corner or riffe called Ransel, Ransel.
but you may under sail it upon 5 fathom, the marks of this channel and how
to shun the tail or Ransel are these, upon the south end of Borckum lie two
little downs called the Wolden, keep the tower of Borckum on the west side of
those little downs so shall you not sail upon the Ransel, in this channel it
is deep nine and eight fathom.

From Steven Ianss buy to Doecke buy l, the course is eastsoutheast, there find
you (southwards from this buy) a beakon m, called Ruytebaken, Ruyte baken.
this buy lies upon 5 fathom and in the fareway you have 7 fathom deep, the
flood falls very strong behind this buy into Doecke-gat whereof you must
beware, from the buy with the Doeck to the Camper buy the course is
eastsoutheast marked with n, from thence to the buy of Eemshorn marked with o,
the course is southeast lie both upon 5 fathom in the midst of the farewater it
is 7 fathom deep, Marks of the buy of Eemshorn
the Marks of the Eemshorn buy are these when the Cloister of the Dam (being a
flat Church) comes together with Holdwijck then have you the length of the
buy; these marks stand then about south and by west from you, stretching out
from the buy of Eemshorn you shall find on the south shore five beakons sail
about that from thence to the Groningerdike southsouthwest till you get the
Church of Wtwyrde and the Cloister of the Dam together, run betwixt to the
shore of Delftsayl, for being past the buy of the Doecke, then you must
presently sound the west shore as far as Otterdum in 5, 6, and 7 fathom, and
come not nearer them, for it very steep the east coast in sailing up you may
hereabout sound upon six fathom, behind a plate called the Hondt being a hard
sand, and somewhat more inward lies yet another plate called the Pape, also an
hard sand runs through between both the creekes but the west shore is soft
and clay ground as far as Otterdum, you must keep the west shore and follow
the beakons which stand along the shore, this reach stretches southsoutheast
and south and by west and so in the bending along southsoutheast and by the
Groninger land southeast.

For to avoid Reydersand or Iannens sand, Reyder.
that is a plate in the midst of the Eems, betwixt Otterdum and Reyde, where
upon at low water it is ten foot, you must look out for Otterdum a slat
church, without a steeple, standing in Groningerland on the dyke, when you come
thwart of it, edge over to Embderland, to wit, to the Knock, which is a steeple
broken of, standing in the water upon the point, Coming by the Knock, then
run within two cables length along by the north shore unto Loegerhorn, and
then you shall not sail too near the plate. There stands a flat steeple
betwixt the Knock and Loegerhorne, called Gerritswaert, when you can see
through that steeple, or when that steeple and the church come one to the
other, then are you thwart of that foresaid plate.

When you sail up the Western Eems, you must leave all the buys on the
starboard side.

A southeast and northwest moon makes without the Eems the highest water. In
the Balgh a southsoutheast and northnorthwest moon: Before the town of
Embden, a south, or south and by west, and a north or north and by east moon.

The Island Iuyst Island Iuyst.
lies a great league, or a league and a half eastnortheast from Borckum, which
is a little low Island, the west end is a high steep point and gray land, the
east end is higher then the midst. The church stands in the midst upon the
land; the steeple is somewhat sharp, and stands at the east end of the
church for you cannot see the church, but thwart of a low place or valley.
Betwixt Borckum and Iuyst goes in the eastern Eems. From the west end of Iuyst
lies off a riffe two leagues, or 2 leagues and a half west into sea, on the
off side you may sound it in 3 or 4 fathom, to the southwards of it goes in
the eastern Eems.

The eastern Eems.
Run upon the grounds of Borckum in 5 fathom and set the tower of Borckum with
the New Cape (which is of late there made) then will they stand south from you,
or if you come from the west, then keep the tower upon Iuyst east and east and
by north from you, so shall you find the first or outtermost buy in 5 fathom,
from the outtermost to the second the course is east and by north, from the
second to the third eastsoutheast, they lie all in 5 fathom in the fareway, it
is five, six, eight and ten fathom deep.

The end of the Iuyster riff, between the outtermost and the second buy is
upon the innermost side so extraordinary steep and rising up, that you cannot
sound upon it, but more inwards from the second buy it is slatter, there is
good sounding ground, the third buy lies upon the point of Brewers plate
Brewers plate.
on the east side of Borckum which you may under sail, the tail is on the
north side very steep, from the third buy sail yet eastsoutheast on till you
come even with the beacon upon the Hooge-Horn, there is a good road upon five,
six, or 7 fathom, and good lying for a south wind, then with a flood you must
go on east and somewhat more northerly that you may so shun the point of the
foresaid Brewers plate, the Iuyster riff is inwards from the second buy flatt,
so that you may sound in 5 or 6 fathom when you are a little eastwards the
third buy, go then southeast on: the eastern Eems is thereabouts wide and
broad. The east end of Borckum is flatt, then you must not forget to sound when
you sail out or in with a ship that draws much water, and if it be with a
southeast course then come you upon the Conings plate Conings plate.
upon the point or tail of which lies a buy, and upon the plate a Beakon,
this buy and Beakon you must bring on your starboard. To the north in east
Friesland stand two towers one by another of which the one is stumpy and great
and the other low and small, when these towers come with the north end of Bandt
a little Island upon the WATT even one with another, then have you the Buy upon
Conings plate they are good longst Marks, and when Iuyster tower comes
northnortheast from you, they are good thwart Marks of the same buy.

From the buy upon the Conings plate to the buy upon the Westernbalgh the
course is southeast till you get the two Capes upon Bandt together that is the
buy southsouthwest from you, from the first buy upon the westernbalgh to the
second, the course is southwest even as the whole westernbalgh is, you shall
not miss (if you keep both the Capes upon Bandt together) to run out of the
balgh but at last a little more westerly.

From the balgh beacon to the beacon upon Eems-horn the course is south and
north, to sail through the channel from these beacons forth to the Knock the
course is southsoutheast from thence to Loegen east.

About a half league within Juyst, betwixt the beacon upon the High Horn, and
the buy upon Kings-plate on the east side of the Easter Eems lies Memerbalgh.
Memerbalgh.
It lies in most north, that is a good road for small ships, that are bound
to the westwards, or out into sea. Within the balgh he that runs in by the
High Horn shall find good road for small ships, that are bound to the
eastwards, which lies in south.

Coming from the eastwards, you may sound Iuyst riff which is flat on the off
side, without, in the point of the riffe is a shore or Deadbalgh, with 2
points, betwixt them it is 3 fathom and an half deep.

A southsoutheast and a northnorthwest moon makes (without in the Easter
Eems) the highest water.

To the east of Iuyst lies Buys, the shortest and smallest Island that is upon
all this coast. It rises up in two Hommocks, where of the one Hommock, which
is the most easterly is the highest and sharpest.

Betwixt Iuyst and Buys goes in the Buysdeepe: Buysdeep
the Worcester. Counsel of Embden was wont to set it with buys, but it is done no
more, in regard it does so oftentimes shift.

Two great leagues to the eastwards of Iuyst lies Norderny, Norderny
betwixt them both lies that little Island Buys. Norderny is to be known by a
broad flat tower, which stands upon the west end, but sometimes men can
hardly perceive it. About the midst of the Island, nearest the east end lies a
high white sand-hill, thereby it is best to be known. Further the land is all
full of Hommocks. Betwixt Norderny and Buys goes in a channel, called the
Norder-deepe, or Norderny.

A great league to the eastwards of Norderny lies the Island Baltrum, ^^ltrum.
which is about two leagues long, a little shorter then Norderny. Upon this
Island stands no special thing, whereby men may know it: but upon the east
end a high sand-hill, which is sharp above, the west end is low sand-hills.
When the foresaid high sand-hill is southeast and by east from you then it is
round to see to: Upon the west end there goes a swamp through.

Betwixt Baltrum and Norderny runs in a channel, called the Whichterie,
Whichtery.
there is no certainty to be written of it, that men may trust to, sometimes
there is 2 fathom water, and more, and sometimes no more then 4 or 5 foot.

The Island Langeroogh lies a league to the eastwards of Baltrum, which is
sour great leagues long, and has on the off-side a fair strand, and three or
four sand-hilles, where by men may know it, which lie from about the midst of
the Island unto the west end, a good ways one from the other, the tops of them
are plain and slat. Betwixt Langeroogh and Baltrum goes in the Acumy, Acumy.
wherein lie 2 buys. It is no channel for great ships, it lies out along
by the foot strand of Langeroogh, first northeast, and then somewhat more
easterly, but it is not to be trusted to, because it alters and shifteth very
often.

Betwixt Langeroogh and Wrangeroogh lies the Island Spyckeroogh, ^^^^^er^^gh.
which is about a league long. At the e. end there was wont to lie a little
Island, easy to be known, called Luttick Spyckeroogh, which is now altogether
gone. Upon Spyckeroogh stands nothing, whereby men might know it, but it is a
black land, with Hommocks and Nobbes, like to the other Islands: Betwixt
Spyckeroogh and Langeroogh goes in the Oxebalgh. Oxebalgh


Wrangeroogh Wrangeroogh.
lies two great leagues to the eastwards of Langeroogh, which is a great
league long, being a little plain white Island: Upon the east end lie high
broad white sand-hills: Upon the west end the ^arle of Oldenbourgh has caused
to be made a great thick tower, with 2 spires: when they stand one right in the
other, then you are by the outer buy of the Weser; the aforesaid tower, men may
see two kennings off at sea. Betwixt Wrangeroogh and Spyckeroogh goes in the
Harrel, The Harrel.
about southsoutheast, but it is not to be trusted because it shifteth very
often.

The Acumy and Harrell are set both with buys by the Worcester. Counsel of Embden:
These channel serve not but for small ships, like as all the other, lying
betwixt the eastern Eems and the Weser.

The Land lies from Bornriffe to Wrangeroogh eastnortheast and westsouthwest
29, or some will have it 30 leagues.

For to sail into the Jade or Western Weser with a southerly wind, run to
the strand of Wrangeroogh in four fathom, with a westerly wind run no
further then five fathom, and lead it in so by the strand of Wrangeroogh, in 4
or five fathom, until you come a good ways within, or to the end of foot
strand of Wrangeroogh, there you shall find the first buy in 5 fathom at low
water: Menserchurch shall then stand south from you. Thwart of this first buy
the red sand is very steep, which you must leave on the larboard side, and
the buy on the starboard side, when you come in. Thwart of this first buy
comes a tail, shooting off from the south shore, that is the innermost
point of the Stonebalgh, which men might, at unawares sail within, in three
fathom and an half, or four fathom, the first buy is laid upon the point of
this tail. The Stonebalgh goes in to the eastwards of Wrangheroogh the south
side where of is steep, but the north side flat, which men may sound. In this
Balgh it is ten foot deep at low water. From the first buy to the second, and
along to the third, the course is east, the second buy lies in two fathom
and an half: The third, that is the Jade buy, lies in three fathom. upon the
shoalest of the High-waye. It is very uneven betwixt the first and the third
buy, you shall get wise depth of five or six fathom and then again two fathom,
or two fathom and an half.

For to sail from the Jade to the Weser, then sail by the third buy over the
shoalest of the High way on eastnortheast to the Mellembuye, and you shall
find at low water upon the foresaid shoalest place, or by the third buy, no
more water then nine or ten foot, and being over there you shall get again
deeper water, and then you are in the Weser: Reckon well your tides, for the
ebb falls very strong northnorthwest out at the Jade, and the flood to the
contrary, very hard inwards, so that you can hardly stem the tide, when the
weather is somewhat calm, whereof you must be very careful.

For to sail up into the Jade, leave the foresaid third buy on the larboard
side, and go from thence most south up, unto the point of the Dyke, called
Hormerscheel, when you are come by the Dyke, there the Iadeis wide and broad,
without the foresaid Dyke stands a beacon or two, for ships that are bound
over the Wadt: If you will sail further up into the Jade, then keep the west
shore, until you come thwart of the church without a steeple, which stands
by the Dyke, there you must leave the west shore, because of the Aent^n or
Ieppe plate, which shoots off from the Veer, along the west shore, and
sometimes lies dry at low Water. The west shore lies most southeast
somewhat southerly.

A south and north moon makes the highest water upon the Jade, and it flows
with an ordinary tide a fathom and an half up and down.

The Weser.
For to sail up the Weser, come no nearer Wrangeroogh then seven fathom, being
in seven fathom, then edge off from the shore into 11 fathom, and you shall
there find the first buy at the coming into the Weser, lying in seven fathom
upon the tail of the Redsand, Menser Church (that is a flat Church without a
steeple in Vroukens land) is then southsoutheast from you. Being thwart of the
first buy, and that the west end of Wrangeroogh is southsouthwest from you,
then you run over the tail of the Red-sand in five fathom.

From the outtermost buy to the second, third, fourth, and fifth, the course is
due east, which lie all in 7 fathom the south side (to wit the Red-sand)
nearest each a point different from Menser church, so that Menser church lies
from the second south and by east, from the third south, from the fourth south
and by west, and from the fifth southsouthwest. The fifth buy is called the buy
upon the Head, for to know that from all the other buys, there stands a
staff upon it of a half fathom long. With a white knotte upon it. Over
against the buy upon the Head lies a white buy on the white grounds. Betwixt
all the foresaid buys you must reckon well your tides, the flood comes out of
the north west, and falls along over the Red-sand, and the ebb to the
contrary. The right deep thwart of these foresaid buys, in the coming in is
eleven fathom, but thwart of the buy upon the Head, five fathom at low water.

Right before the We lies the Middle-plate, Middle plate.
the Eastermost or the Inn^^side begins right to the northwards of the buy
upon the Head by the white grounds, and lies along the reach of the third
buy, to reckon from without, and is on both sides flat for to sound about. On
the west side of the foresaid plate lies a white buy about from Menser Church,
which you must leave in coming in on the larboard-side.

For to sail from the buy upon the Head, out again to the eastwards of this
plate unto the Elve. Then sound it out about the white grounds, in 4 or 5
fathom, until you be out in the sea.

For to sail further up into the Weser, the course from the buy upon the Head
unto the sixth buy is southeast and northwest. Menser Church shall then lie
from you southwest and by south, the Weser is thwart of it about 20 fathom
deep. From the sixth buy to the seventh, that is, the buy upon the Course, or
the Wapperbuye, or the southwest buy, because Menset Church lies southwest
off from it, the course is southeast. The Jade buy lies about south, or south
and by west from this buy. From the buy upon the Course unto the Mellem buy
the course is yet southeast, which you might sail within ar unawares in six
fathom. Menser Church lies off from it southwest and by west. From the Mellem
buy to the buy upon Bollenziele the course is southeast somewhat easterlie,
you must reckon your tides there very well, because the floude falls
exceeding hard into the west shore. Langworder church lies right south and by
east from that buy upon Bollenziele, Buy upon Bollenziele.
over against it upon the point of the blackgrounds lies a white buy, come no
nearer to it at half flood then four fathom and an half, you might unawares
sail within that point (in sailing in) in four fathom. From the buy, upon
Bollenziele to the beakon upon Bollenziele the course is southsoutheast, or
southeast and by south. Langworder church lies about south from that beakon,
you must leave it on the starboard side, coming in within that beakon upon
Bollenziele is a good road for a westerly wind. From the beakons upon
Bollenziele to the first buy upon the flat, the course is southeast till you
come somewhat beneath the beakon, and then along eastsoutheast. The marks of
the first buy upon the Flat is, when you can see through the belholes of
Langworder steeple, then you are thwart of the first buy, Langworder Church is
then from you somewhat more southerly then southsouthwest. From the first buy
upon the Flat to the second, the course is eastsoutheast. Betwixt these two
buys stand five beakons on the larboard side, upon the black grounds. From
the second buy upon the flatt to the Meyland, the course is southeast and by
south. Being come thwart of Wadnis or the Meyland, sail then close along by the
green shore, until you come within Blixem, there is the road for great ships
that are bound to sea.

Like as upon the Jade, so also upon the Weser a south and north moon makes
the highest water, it flows there also 2 fathom and a half up and down.

To the eastwards of the Weser lie the south grounds South grounds
of the Elve, there go in 2 fair deep Balghs or Creeks of 10, 12, and 13
fathom. The Til, called also Broadbalgh, is the westermost, and lies so far to
the westwards, that men can but even see the New-worke from thence.

If it should happen that coming to the eastwards of the Weser, you should be
beset upon the souther grounds, being a lest shore, and be in danger, then
sail to the south grounds in 4, or 5, and 6 fathom, but not much nearer also,
for they are somewhat steep. When you (running so along by these grounds upon
the same course) shall get 8, 9, yea, 10 or 12 fathom soft ground, Easter Til.
then that is certainly of the Broadbalgh or Wester Till, take then the
sounding of which side that you will, and sound it about by the grounds in 4 or
5 fathom, and you shall find amongst the sands smooth water, and good road,
and may lie sheltered for all winds. The wester Till lies in first
eastsoutheast, along by the north shore it is deepest, on the south shore
you cannot sail within any tails in sailing out, but you may in sailing in:
when you come somewhat further in, lies up more to the southwards: there are
diverse Balgs or channells, where men may sail through that are acquainted.

The Easter Till or Broadbalgh lies betwixt the Wester Till Wester Til.
and the Hondtbalgh, which runs in seven fathom into the eastermost point,
(or the old Schorhorn) that is a tail which lies off a good ways, and which
you might at unawares sail within in seven fathom coming from the westward.
This Till lies in also (like as the other) first eastsoutheast, but a little
further in more easterly. Here also you may take the sounding of which side or
shore that you will.

Being com within, you shall get smooth water of the sands for all winds. In
this channel is not less then 7 fathom water.

The Hondtbalgh Hondtbalgh.
lies right into the westwards of the Steep-buye or Schorhorn. If you will go
in there with small ships for to sail over the Wadt into the Weser, then go
(when you have the Steep buy) in southsoutheast. The Hondtbalgh is without
indifferent wide, keep that course, until you come thwart of the beakons,
which you must leave on the starboard side, you may well sound in about the
off-side of the Schor-horne, but not the west side, by it lie plates which you
might sail foul of in 9 fathom, in coming in, but on the Schor-horne you
cannot do amiss.

Holy land.
The Island Holyland, and the outermost buy in the Weser, lie one from the
other, south somewhat westerly, and north somewhat easterly. When it is clear
and good sight, you may see Holy land, when you lie in the Weser, by the buy
upon the head. Holyland and Bornrisse lie one from the other southwest and by
west, and northeast and by east according to the common opinion, two and thirty
leagues. When you come from the westwards and begin to get Holy Land in sight,
it shows it self with a high reddish steep point, which is slat above. For
to anchor or make road under Holy land, coming from the westwards, then run
to that land in ten or twelve fathom. When you sail toward the south point,
and come somewhat near the land, you shall epsy a rock, like unto a small
tower, close by the high land, called the Monck, Monck.
which is almost so high as the high land. About southsoutheast an English
mile, or a little more from that rock under water. Rock under water
If you keep your self in eight and nine fathom, then you run without this
rock, and cannot take any hurt of it. When the Monck is covered of the other
land, then you are thwart of this suncken rock. When the soresayd Monck comes
a handspikes length, past or without the other land, there is the road; and
good anchoring in ten or eleven fathom, the ground is there fair and clean,
except it be of wracks of lost ships, or lost anchors, which are there may
Lying there in nine, ten or eleven fathom, you have shelter for a
westfouthwest, northwest and north winds. From the point where the Monck
stands by, shoots off a little riffe from the shore, which men may sound
in 3 fathom, you may also run in 5 fathom from the shore, and sail clear
of the foresaid suncken rock, to wit, through betwixt the suncken Rock, and the
little riffe: but if you run into deeper water, to wit, in 7 fathom, you
shall run right upon the suncken Rock. In 8 or 9 fathom you do run about
without the suncken Rock.

From the north side of Holy Land lies off a filthy Riffe, almost a league
into sea so that you cannot come nearer the whole north side, then in nine or
ten fathom. If you will go about to the northwards of Holy land, being come
so far that the east end of Holy land come to be south and south and by east
from you, sail then freely unto the Scholvers point, Scholvers point.
that is a flatt point, which you may sound in five, six, and seven fathom. If
so be that you will run in eight fathom off from it, you shall run above
two great leagues from the shore. The right fareway bewixt the Hever and
Holy Land is not more then nine or ten fathom deep. When you come about the
point to the road, and that Scholvers point lie northeast, and the Rock
southwest from you, there is good lying in five fathom.

Scholvers point is the point where the South Haven South-haven.
lies within, which lies from the high land about east into sea. From the
outermost end of Scholvers point lies a banck of three fathom, unto the point
where the Monck alsoo stands, within it is very good lying for ships of
little draught, that is called the south Haven of Holyland. A southsouthwest
and northnortheast moon makes there the highest water.

Of the Elve.
The Road of Holy land, and the outermost buy of the Elve (called the
Schortunne or the Steep-buye) lie right southeast and by east and northwest and
by west 8 leagues asunder, which lies right to the northwards of the
Schor-horn, that is the outermost point of the New-workes ground, on the south
side of the Elve, the right deep of the Elve runs in along to the
northwardes of it. On the north side of the Elve lie the north ground, which
lie somewhat flat far off to seawardes upon the northwest side. The south end
of the northgrounds, Mirdle of Vogelsand
called Voghelsand, runs from the foresaid buy a good ways west and by
north into sea, with a narrow tail of perfect hard sand, about a half league
broad, which waxes by little and little the farther from the shore the
deeper. Three leagues from the foresaid buy, there is upon it eleven fathom
water, when you sail on north from the steep-buye, you run over it in three
fathom, or three fathom and a half, but it does soon deep again in five,
seven, eight and ten fathom, soft ground, that is in the creek of the North
Elve. North-Elve.
To the southwardes of that a foresaid Voghelsand, in the right fareway of the
Elve (for him that comes from the westwardes) it is also somewhat soft
ground, and fourteen and thirteen fathom deep, to the southwardes of it,
toward the souther or Steep grounds, the ground is again very hard, and the
grounds very steep, you may not come nearer them (especialy by night or dark
weather) then in eleven or twelve fathom, if you come nearer to them, you might
sail foul of the wester Till, or Souther-Broad-Balgh, which runs up to the
southwards into the grounds to nothing.

When you come from the westwards, and sail to the Elve, you shall find
betwixt Holyland and the Weser, and thereabouts somewhat to the eastwards,
depth of twenty fathom, until that you come well half ways to Holyland,
toward the Steenebuye, then it does begin to shoale from eighteen to sixteen
and fourteen fathom, close by the Steep buy it is twelve fathom deep.

If you come by night along by the steep or southergrounds, with a southerly
wind in twelve or thirteen fathom, and go on east and by north, you shall at
last meet with the shoaling of the New-workes-grounds, right to the northwards
of the Hondt-balgh in eight and seven fathom, there you must then let fall your
anchor, for to stay for the day, and you shall find your self not far from
the buy. With northerly winds you must anchor further from the south shore
in the foresaid shoaling in eleven or twelve fathom.

To the northwards of the foresaid narrow tail, or shoaling, which lies off
from Vogelsand, runs in a great bight or Slenck into the norther grounds,
called the Norther Elve, Nor^^^r-Elve.
it is in the going in somewhat within so broad that you may there in turn to
winde-wardes, but within it runs narrow and sharp too; and at last to
nothing, (ending almost against the whitebuye, which lies upon the Elve, upon
the tail of the New-grounds) it is going in more then half ways thirteen and
twelve fathom deep, and soft ground, very much like the right Elve. It
happens oftentimes by dark wether that the shippers (thinking that they are
entered into the right Elve) run in there, sometimes with danger, especially
with westnorthwest winds, for they must come out there back again. When you
sail off from Holyland on eastsoutheast, you shall have depth of twelve or
thirteen fathom, being a league off from it, that you leese the white cliffe
out of your sight, then you shall get one eve depth of thirteen fathom, and
soft ground, all along until you come within the foresaid north Elve. When
you shall perceive that you are entered in there, you may (when the New-worke is
more southerly then southeast and by south from you) run along over the tail
of Vogelsand in five fathom, and so come against the Steep-buye upon the right
Elve.

For to set sail by night from the road of Holyland, the course is southeast
and by east, then you shall run over the foresaid tail of Vogelsand in seven
and eight fathom, and somewhat hard sandy ground. If you then run a little more
southerly, you shall get again twelve and thirteen fathom and somewhat soft
ground, that is the right deep or channel of the Elve betwixt Vogelsand and
the steep-grounds. If you run then more southerly, you shall get again
somewhat hard ground of the souther grounds, which are (as has been here be
foresaid) very steep and hard, when you come near them in twelve or eleven
fathom, you must edge off again from them unto twelve or thirteen fathom, and
along by them toward the steepe-buye, unto the foresaid shoaling of the
New-workes grounds, and there stay for the day light.

When you come by day from Holy Land or from the westwards, and that you get
New-worke in sight of you bring that and the Cape one in the other, and sail
so right in with them, then you shall find the steepebuye, which lies (as
has been already said) toward the south land on the side of the Schorhorne
the outtermost point of the New-grounds in ten or eleven fathom. From the
Steep-buye to the Kool-buye, that is, the second buy, the course is due east,
which lies in eight fathom. Upon the New-work stand three country men's houses,
the middlemost of them, and the steeple of the New-worke come one in the other
when you come to the second buy. The third buy lies in six fathom, from the
Kool-buye east and by north somewhat easterly, but nearest east and by north.
The fourth lies in five fathom from the third, east and by north. Betwixt
these buys a little within the third, runs a deep Creek eastsoutheast into
the New-workes-grounds, called the Kinder-balgh, Kinder-balgh.
which is wide at the entering in, and at half flood well nine fathom deep;
but runs at length altogether dry to nothing. He that comes running
along by the south-grounds, might lightly get in there, therefore the third
buy lies a little further off from the south shore, because men should avoid
that Creek. Betwixt the third and fourth buy on the north side of the deep
lies a white buy in three fathom, upon the tail of the New-ground,
New-Grounds.
which men might sail within, when they come inwards, that you must leave on
larboard side, and all the black buys on the starboard side.

The foresaid white buy and the New-worke lie northnortheast and
southsouthwest one from the other, to the eastwards of it the north side is
very steep. The fifth buy lies in 3 fathom and a half, or 4 fathom, and
lies from the fourth full east.

The sixth buy, that is the point buy, lies in six fathom from the fourth and
fifth due east. In the right deep to the northwards of these foresaid black
buys from the Kool-buy to the point buy in the right fareway, it is all
along six and seven fathom deep. From the point buy to the buy in the
Rosse, the course is southeast which lies in seven or eight fathom, when the
Ros beakon comes to the little steeple of Gron or Groen, then you are thwart
of this buy. Half ways betwixt the point buy, and the buy in the Rosse,
lies yet another buy on the south side, which is there betwixt them both
exceeding steep and needle too. Right east southeast from the point buy over
against the buy in the Rosse, somewhat further inwards, lies a white buy
upon the tail of Romaerl plate, which men might at unawares sail within, in
four or five fathom when they sail upwards. When the little sharp steeple of
Word comes to the westwards of Oldenbroek (that is a church with two spires
upon one steeple) then they are south from you, from thence inwards you may
sound Romaerl plate in six fathom without danger, otherwise it is on the
off-side very steep. From the Ros beakon to Bruns buttell are fiv^ leagues,
betwixt the buy in the Rosse, and the buy upon Romaerl plate begins a sand
lying right in the midst along the fareway about two leagues long, called
Pilgroms-sand, upon it is along no more then two fathom water, or a little
more, upon it lie three black buys, and over against it on the north side, two
white buys, you must sail through betwixt them, along to the northwards of
that sand, being past it, you shall come upon the flat. There lie yet two buys
which you must leave also on the starboard side in sailing up, before you come
to Bruns buttell. All the depths here before mentioned, are reckoned at half
flood.

From Bruns buttell to the buy upon Salfhorne, or Friburger-sand, the Course
is east, and east and by north along by the north-land. From Salts-horne to
the buy against the Steur east and by south, and eastsoutheast, from the Steur
to the buy upon Gringer-oortssand southeast, and southeast and by east, that
lies against Bilenburg more then half ways in the deep. Betwixt this buy
and the buy upon the Steur lies another buy in the fareway. From the buy of
Gringeroort to the buy upon Stader-sand southeast and by south, and
southsoutheast. This buy you must leave on the starboard side. From
Stader-sand to Willems-fliet, or the buy upon the Luye it is southeast, and
southeast and by south, and from thence to the buy upon Terloo eastsoutheast.
From thence to the buy upon Hanneball, the course is east and west. From
Hanneball to the buy upon Blanckenes sand east and east and by north, you must
keep that buy right with a great tree, and then run along by the north
land until you be past the buy.

From Blancknesse sand unto the buy in the bight, the course is eastsoutheast,
and from thence unto the Eeckhout east and by north in the right channel it is
there 3 or 4 fathom deep, there lie the great ships for to lade and unlade.

The Eyder.
Six leagues to the northwards of the Elve lies the Eyder, with many shoals
lying far out without the land chiefly and most on the south side, on the
north side of the deep along by the land of Eyderstee lies a long sand
called the Broad-back, or New-grounds, on the south side lie Blavoort, the Iron
Hendrick, the Hound and Hecksand. To the southwards of Blavoort, and the Iron
Hendrick, about a league to the southwards of the mouth of the Eyder, goes yet
a Deep in called the North pipe, where men may sail in, and come out again by
the Hound upon the Eyder. In this Eyder lie on the south side of the Deep
seven black buys, which you must leave all (in sailing in) on the starboard
side, and on the north shore, which you must leave on the larboard side. The
outermost buy lies from the steep buy right north, and from Holy Land east
or a little mo^e northerly seven or eight leagues. When you fall with the land
with that course you shall espy to the northwards of the Eyder, upon the land
of Eyderstee, a sharp steeple indifferent high, called Gardingen, bring that
over or to the south side of the little sand-hils lying on the north side of
the Eyder, called the Souther-Heads, they shall then stand from you northeast
and by north, or a little more easterly, sail right in with them so, and you
shall fall with outermost buy, when that then the sharp steeple of
Weslinburen, standing to the southwards of the Eyder in the land of Ditmarsen
comes to be east or a little more southerly from you, then you have the
length of the foresaid buy, and then S. Peter's Church upon the Eyderstee to
the westwards of Gardingen, not far from the sea side, shall stand from the
northn. east. Thus, or coming out of the southwest upon the foresaid marks of
Gardingen, and the Souther-heads, you shall run over the shoale of Blavoort,
which men do call alsoo the tail of the Hound, lying off from Blavoort almost
half ways to Holy Land. It is also by some called Blavoort, or coming from
the northwards, bring the foresaid steeple of Weslinburen east or a little more
southerly from you, and sail so right in until that Gardingen comes to the
foresaid southerheads, or that S. Peter's church be northnortheast from you, in
doing so you shall not miss also the outermost buy. From the outermost buy to
the second, third and fourth, it is al one course eastsoutheast the second
lies upon the shoalest of the channel at low water in 16 foot, the the third
in 4 fathom, and the fourth in 5 fathom.

These three last lie along the north side of Blavoort, on the south side of
the deep. In sailing in. You must leave them all on the starboard side, and
run along to the northwards of them. From the fourth to the fifth, that is,
the buy upon the Hound, the course is east, which lies thwart of the Hound,
on a point which lies off from Heckesand, which in coming in, men might at
unawares sail within along to the southwards of the buy, therefore you must
leave that also (as well as the former) on the starboard side, and sail
along to the northwards of it. Betwixt this foresaid buy upon the Hound and
the fourth, lies another buy upon the north side of the deep, upon the
southermost point of the New-grounds, which you must leave on the larboard
side, and run about to the southwards of it. From the buy upon the Hound to
the sixth, the course is northnortheast, and two fathom deep. From the sixth to
the seventh and last buy northeast and by north, and the deep along to the
northwards of it three fathom. Being past the last buy, follow the beakons,
which stand along on the north shore, until you come to Hulck, run close
along to the southwards or to the eastwards of them, for to avoid a tail of
sand, which comes off from the east shore, which men might unawares sail
within into a Dead-creeke. From the Hulck to Schulperzile, the course is east
southeast. In that reach, the beakons stand on the south side upon the
Ballast-plate, and you must run along to the northwards by them, leaving them
on the larboard side. From Schulperzile to Tonningen the course is
northnortheast. Before Tonningen the Eyder is at the shoalest, and at low water
no deeper then one fathom and a half. From thence further in toward the
Newtown called Frederick stadt, there is depth enough.

The depths here before mentioned are all to be understood at low water. From
Tonningen toward Wollersum, the Eyder lies along northeast and by east.
From Wollersum toward Harebleck northnorthwest. From Harebleck toward
Reymers-bode northeast. From Reymers-bode toward Nyenzyle eastsoutheast. From
Nyenzyle to the Nyen-veere south.

Betwixt the fourth buy upon the Eyder and the fifth, that is, the buy upon
the Hound, over against the buy upon the southermost point of the New-grounds,
stand two beakons a little to the southwards of the foresaid two buys, the
westermost upon the east point of the Blavoort, or the Iron Hendrick, and the
eastermost upon the tail of the Hound. Betwixt these two beakons goes in
through a deep southeast or southeast and by east, where you may sail through
along by the beakons upon the Iron Hendrick (which you must leave then on the
starboard side) until you come into the end of the North-pipe, which lies
from thence about west into sea. You may sound in at the North-pipe, coming in
out of the sea by the south shore in 3 and 4 fathom, until you come to the
foresaid beakons, and then about by them northwest, or somewhat more westerly
up unto the Eyder, or else you may run further along by the foresaid south
shore, until you come about the beakon upon Hoedmeersand, and then forth
betwixt the Island Bulheads and Buysen along by the Beakons upon
Hoedmeersand, with many points and bights on to the southwards, and come out at
last upon the Old Elve, about northeast from the New-work against the
New-grounds, which is not well to be sailed, but of those that are there very
well acquainted.

Along by the North shore of the Eyder, close to the southwards of the
little sand-hills, the southerheads, runs in yet a Land-deepe, east and east
and by north in, and comes out again upon the Eyder by the Hulck, that
serves but only for small ships, there remains at low water but five foot.

Of the Tides and Courses of the streams.
Before the Scholbalgh, the Lauwers and the Schille, and before the
Western-Eems a southeast and northwest Moon makes high water.

Before Embden and Delszyle a north or north and by east and a south or south
and by west Moon.

In the Eastern-Eems and Burckumbalgh a southsoutheast and northnorthwest Moon.

Before the Channells betwixt the Eastern-Eems and the Weser, a south and south
and by east, and a north and north and by west Moon.

In the fareway betwixt the Fly and the Elve, the foreflood comes out of the
north sea, and turns about by little and little with the sun, falling the
half tide eastnortheast along the shore, and the ebb westsouthwest.

Before the Weser and Elve, and alsoo in the Eyder a south and north Moon
makes high water. The flood comes there out of the northwest, and the ebb
out of the southeast, and fall very strong over the grounds that lie out there.

Under Holyland a northnortheast and southsouthwest Moon makes full sea.

Of the Depths about these places, and in what depths men may see the land.
Schiermonickoogh men may see in 12 and 13 fathom 4 great leagues without the
land.

Rottum and Borckum men may see in 14 and 15 fathom.

Thwart of Borckum the ground is gross red sand, mingled with some black.

Juyst, men may see in 13 and 14 fathom, 3 leagues without the land it is 12
fathom deep.

Buys and Norderny men may see from the Poop in 12 and 13 fathom.

Baltrum Langeroogh and Wrangeroogh, men may see it in 14 and 15 fathom.

Thwart of Botjadigerland, Reidingerland and Ditmarsen, the grounds lie so
far without the land, that you cannot see the coasts, except you clim be up
into the top.

About Holyland it is deep 7, 8, and 9 fathom, to wit, on the inner side, but
without on the west side 15, 16, 18, and 19 fathom, in such depth you may see
the land of Holyland from the westwards.

The third Demonstration, Where in Are deciphered the Seacoasts of the west
and east side of Iutland: together with the Belt until you are past Laland and
Langeland.
FRom the New-worke, or Steepe-Buy to the Hever, the course is north ten
leagues, when you come about half ways betwixt them both, you shall meet with
the foresaid sand or tail of Blavoort in the depth of two or three fathom. In
this fareway you must be very careful of your tides, that you come not upon
the grounds, which lie far out a seaboard the Land, the foreflood falls there
very strong thwart over the grounds toward the land, and the ebb to the
contrary.

For to sail from Holyland to the Hever, go on northeast somewhat easterly,
or according as the wind and tide shall be, and run toward the grounds,
until you come in six or seven fathom, and then you shall espy a steeple
which is sharp, and indifferent high, called Piel-worme, bring that northeast
and by north from you, a masts length to the southwards of the southermost
Cow-house, upon the little Island Nuball, keep that so standing, and sail
toward it, and you shall so find the outermost buy, from that to the second
buy, go on northeast and northeast and by east; being come to it, Piel-worme
steeple shall stand northnortheast from you. From the second buy along
inwards, the course is northeast and by east. Being come in so a good ways,
you shall find two beakons on the starboard side, upon a dry sand, called the
Quade, there over against comes the north balgh in the right Hever. From the
first beakon to the second and third, the course is east and by north, sail
all along by the beakons, leaving them on the starboard side. To the
northwards of them betwixt the first and third beakon, it is full of sands and
plates, where you might at unawares sail within. By the third beakon comes
the souther ba^gh into the Hever. From that third beakon to the two other
beakons the course is northeast and by east, being past that you shall come by
the green land on the starboard side, there it is a square deep, large and
bro^d channel, from thence you may sail along amidst the channel unto
Hoesem at the bridge, or anchor thereabouts every where, where you will.

Without in the Hever the north side is steep, therefore keep the south side
until you come within the beakons, in the channel is at half flood two
fathom and a half water, and without the channel it is very far flat.
Somewhat without the Hever lies also a banck, whereof men must be careful
when they will sail in there. A south and north Moon makes there the highest
water.

The south balgh goes into the southwards of the foresaid bank the Quade, in
right with the little Island Utto, and along to the northwards of it, it is
from without a league and a half to sail to Utto. From Utto it lies in
along northeast and by north, and comes out into the Hever by the third
beakon.

The north balgh lies in to the northwards of the Hever about east and by
north, or west and by south from Pielworme, right in with the foresaid little
Island Nuball, which you must leave on the larboard side running in along by
it, and so come into the Hever, against the foresaid dry sand, the Quade: you
may also (coming in at the north balgh) sail up to the northwards from the
Island Nuball unto the end of Strand, till you come thwart of a flat Church,
and anchor there behind the shoals, that is a deep balgh or Creek.

Small deep.
Three or four leagues to the northwards of the Hever, lies the Small-deep.
For to sail off from Holy Land toward it, go on northeast and by north, and
run to the grounds, about west and by north, from the Pielworme, the south
end of Ameren shall then be north or thereabouts from you. Seek then to the
south grounds, and sound about by them, and there you cannot do amiss, it is
flat rising ground far without the land. On the north side lie many sands,
shoals and points, that lie out, which men might (without good heed-taking)
sail within: sail in therefore along by the south side north and by east,
northnortheast, and northeast and by north, and so you shall find one shoale or
breach, leave that on the larboard side. If you leave that on the starboard
side, you should run into a dead Balgh or Creek, wherein is at the first at
least 7 fathom depth, but runs at last by little and little to nothing: you
may also run along by that foresaid shoale by your lead, until you come
within it, coming then thwart of the south end of Ameren, you might unawares
sail within the south grounds behind a snare which shoots off from the
grounds of Vooren, therefore keep the south side until that you come thwart
of the Island Vooren.

The Red-deepe.
For to sail in at the Red or Silter-deepe, coming from the northwards, or
out of the sea, run in sight of the Island Ameren. About the midst of
Ameren lies a white round hill, a little higher then the other Hommocks in a
low plain valley. Bring that northeast from you, and run in so right with it,
until you come within the riffe that shoots off from the Voortrap, and
commonly is called Ameren Borne, ^meren-Borne.
and so you connot take any hurt of it, and then you shall have upon the point
of the Riffe not less then three fathom water, and within the same riffe
eleven, twelve, or thirteen fathom. Sail so in until that the north end of
Ameren be north and by east from you, and then run right with the north end of
Ameren, until you come within the dry sand, and there you may anchor where you
please, or sail so far in as you will, and sound it all along by the Riffe.

The Strand of Ameren is a fair Strand without any tails that men might sail
within. When the foresaid hill upon Ameren is eastnortheast from you, and sail
so right with it, then you run too near the foresaid Riffe of Silt, the hill
is then also in two parts, the northermost is then the smallest.

For to sail in at the Red-deepe, or Silter-deepe, coming off from Holyland,
and that you have gotten sight of the land, then bring the north end of Ameren
north and by east from you, until that you be come in betwixt Ameren, and the
Riffe of Silt, run then in along by the Strand of Ameren, until you come
about the north point of Ameren and so along to the eastwards, until that
Ameren lie south and southsouthwest from you. You may not sail into this
channel further to the eastwards, for then you come against the Island of
Vooren but you may sail to the northwards along betwixt Vooren and Silt,
till you come before Lit. In Silter-deepe is upon the shoalest three fathom
water, being over it, there is again eight, nine, ten, and twelve fathom,
there lie two riffes, or bad sands, the one about westsouthwest from Ameren dry
above water, that is, very far flat, to wit, in three, four, or five fathom,
it is called of the Juthes the Borne, or Ameren-Borne, although that it be not
fast to Ameren, for the Red-deep goes in betwixt them both. It is not also
fast unto the Voortraps, or that south end of Silt, although it comes
shooting off from it, betwixt them goes out into sea a deep of about a fathom
and a half, where the fishermen do daily go out through for to fish,
especially those of the Island Vooren, this is the outermost sand that lies on
this coast. They that use this coast much; either for Rypen, or the quarters
thereabouts are very much afraid for this Ameren-Borne when they come off from
Holyland, they find this shoale about westsouthwest from Ameren.

The other sand shoots off from the south end of Ameren, lying about south,
and south and by west into sea along the Land, that is also called by many
the Borne, or Ameren-Born. He that comes off from Holyland, and is bound to
the northwards, need not fear so much for the shoale, for it shoots out most
by the land.

The Haven of List.
About eight leagues to the northwards of Silter-deep lies the Haven of List,
which runs in by the north end of the Island Silt. For to sail in there,
coming from the southwards, run so long to the northwards in six or seven
fathom, that you may see a little Island without the point (which lies within
these outer Islands) upon which stands a house, called Ieurtmans house: when
that house comes a mast length without the point of List, then go in east
and by south, and eastsoutheast, keep those marks so standing, until that
you be within the point off List, edge then up to the southwards about the
point and anchor before the Vuchts house, there it is nine and ten fathom deep.
At the entering of the channel lies a plate or sand, called Haef-sand,
Haefsand.
that you shall leave on the larboard side, when you come in, it is on the
off-side very flat, and good for to sound when you come from the northwards.
For to avoid that when you come from the northwards, edge off so far from the
shore, that the red Cliffe come without the sand-hills, or that you may see it
plainly: Then you may go well over Haef-sand, with a ship that is not of a
very great draught. Likewise when you come out at the channel of List, and are
bound to the northwards, sail so far out that you may see the Cliffe, and
then you may go over the foresaid sand, which lies from the south end of Rem
a good ways into sea.

On the south side of the channel of List lie also two sands or banks along
the shore not very far without the strand, the innermost or northermost is
called Barling-sand Barling sand.
and the outermost, Rust, or Rusting, Rust, or Rusting.
that lies to the southwards almost thwart of the red Cliffe, betwixt these
sands, and the strand of Silt goes in the Land deep. For to sail in there
coming from the southwards, you must seek betimes to the strand of List about
the red cliffe, because of the Rust which lies off from the north end of List
a little without the strand. When that you have the sounding of the shore, and
are come somewhat within that red cliff, there shall meet you a flat from the
shore, which you must somewhat avoid, and then you may sound very well: keep
all along the foot strand, there you can take no hurt of it. From the Inner
point of List shoots off alsoo a little riffe, where of you must take heed.
When that you are come within the Innermost point of List, then you may anchor
where you please. If you will go to Lutke Tonderen, then leave that sand
(which lies to the southwards of Iuresand) on the starboardside, and run
through betwixt them both. He that is bound to Hoesem or Silt over the Wad must
leave that sand on the larboard side. Upon Vooren stand two or three trees,
these you must keep over the westermost church or steeple, and run so along
unto Vooren.

Betwixt the Rust and Barling-sand goes a fair deep channel through called
the New deep, right in along to the southwardes of Rock-sand, Rocksand
that is a shoale which lies to sea-wards of Rust and Barling-sand. For to
sail in at that New-deepe, bring the white cliffe upon Silt east, and east and
by north from you and run in so right with it, and you shall fall right in the
New-deep betwixt these two banks, leaving Rocksand or the Maber on the
larboard side of you, run in so along by Rust, but come also no nearer to it
then in four fathom, until that you come into the Land-deep, but coming
against the shore, and getting shoaling of the strand, run in along by the
foot-strand on inwardes, as is rehearsed in the description of the Land-deep.

Betwixt Haef-sand, or Haes-sand, and the Island of Rem goes in yet a little
Land deep of about a fathom and a half water. The Island Rem is three leagues
long, and very flat on the off-side, so that you shall scarce see that land in
6 or 7 fathom.

Banck of at sea.
About eight or nine leagues a seaboard of the Island Silt lies another banck
along the shore of eight or 9 fathom, and is about two leagues long, about so
long as the Island is. Betwixt this Bancke and the Island it is thirteen
fathom deep, being in nine fathom a sea-board the Island Silt, then lies
Holyland about south from you.

Knuyts-deep, or Riper-deep.
From the channel of List to Knuyts or Ryper-deep the course is north and
south about seven leagues, but Ryper-deepe and Holyland lie north somewhat
westerily, and south somewhat easterly one from the other, for to sail into
Knuyts or Ryper-deep coming from the southwards, run about by the flat of Rem
and Manu toward the south end of Phanu, called souther head, or Souther-heigh,
and so you shall see two C^pes upon a dry sand, somewhat to the southwards of
Southerhead bring those Capes a little through one another, to wit the
innermost or longst a little or a h^ndspikes length to the northwards of the
shortest or outermost, and then they shall stand eastnortheast from you, keep
them so standing, and sail right in with them, and so you shall find the
outermost buy, lying on the north shore in four fathom in the channel,
called Old Ruper-deepe, leave that buy on the larboard side, and then go
inwards east and by north, east, and east and by south unto the second buy,
you must run also about to the southwards of it, for thwart of it comes a
shoale shooting off from the north shore, from the outermost Cape toward the
second buy, which you must avoid.

Or keep the sounding of the south shore called Coersand, Coersand.
and run by your lead first east and by north, then east, and at last east and
by south in by it, you shall find there upon the shoalest not less then ten
foot at low water and common tide; there within it is again 6, 7, and 8 fathom
deep. Being past the Capes, then luffe up to the northwards, about the sand
where the Capes stand upon, and anchor there where you please, there it is wide
and broad, and also deep and steep, so that there you can take no hurt. The
Ryper ships that are bound out, do lie there for to stay for a wind. Behind
the Island Manu it is 6 and 7 fathom deep, there also men may ride, from
thence you may go up the deep to Rypen, but not up along to Ripe with great
ships, close to Rypen the deep ends, so that there is a shoaleneck betwixt
both, where there is no more then 6 foot depth. With small ships you may also
sail about behind Rem toward Iursand, there is a low water about 7 foot water.

Coming from the northwards for to sail into Ryper-deepe, you shall also run
on to the south end of Phanu, until that you shall espy the foresaid Capes,
and go then further as is above taught. This channel is not the best channel
in foul weather, for it is narrow and far off shoale wihout it: but when you
shall be entered into it, you may easily see both sides break, if it blow any
thing hard.

A southsouthwest and northnortheast moon makes here the highest water.

The Growe-deepe.
About northeast, or northeast and by north from the north end of Phanu lies a
little Hill, called Luysbergh: a little to the northwards of it lies a long
plain sandhill, called Langeleg: from thence lies the land toward Zuyder-zyt
westnorthwest and eastsoutheast.

Betwixt the north point of Phanu and Langeleg Langeleg
goes in that Growe-deep. For to sail in there when you come from the
southwards, run along the Island Phanu, and about by the north end of it
(which is far flat.) When as that you get deeper water, you shall see three
or four hommocks about northeast from you, upon the high land with a little
flat steeple, called Holm, or Bruynum. Bring that little Church a cables length
to the northwards of the Hommocks, go in then northeast, and keep the south
shore, until you come within that dry sand, which shoots off from Phanu,
called Smeursand, Smeursand.
you may run to that upon your sight without doing amiss, but leave that on
the starboard side when you come in. The shoares are there abouts both of them
very steep, as well Wisdike, (that is the Plate which lies in the channel)
as also Smeursand, but without the shoares are flat. When you are past the
point of Smeursand, edge then over to Wisdike, and anchor there until that you
have the lowest water, and then you may sail to Hartingen, and go on forth to
Wardt, Wardt.
or Woerdt, which lies eight or nine leagues within the land, the river is
very crooked; upon the which here and there lies a Gentleman's house.

A southsouthwest and northnortheast moon makes there the highest water, and
there it flows with a common tide about a fathom up and down.

From Phanu to Schellingkroegh Schellingkroegh.
it is four leagues, betwixt them lies Zuyder-zyt a little river of eight or
nine foot water. The land betwixt Langeleg and Zuyder-zyt is ragged land with
sand-hilles, and rough, being grown with spirie grass, or heath. If you should
fall with the land at Zuyder-zyt, Zuyder-zijt.
and that you could not lead it into the channel, then choose the land of
Langeleg, you may run to it without danger, keep in two fathom and a half,
and you cannot sail amiss of this Kroegh: sor you may sound this land all
along in two fathom and an half off from Langeleg until you come within
Schellingh-kroegh, but if you run in three fathom or three fathom and a half,
you shall sail without the driesand, and run about a seaboard of the forenamed
Kroegh. Schellingh-kroegh lies in most northwest men lie there within,
sheltred for all winds, like as men do lie at Coningsborough in the Kettell.
If so be that you come from the northwards, and are bound into this Haven or
Kroegh, you may run about by that dry sand in three fathom, when you come by
the innermost point of that dry sand, there shoots off a little tail of
sand, but you may see it well, and keep your self from it: when you come to
the east end of that sand, luffe up about it, until you come into that Kroegh,
and anchor there in two fathom and a foot, it is there very wide, you may make
there a good board, and turn it in to windwards. A southsouthwest and
northnortheast moon makes there the highest water, the farther you come to
the northwards to Iutland, the less tide goes, and the less it flows up
and down.

At the north end of the foresaid dry sand lies the Doodenbergh, Doodenbergh.
that is a short hommock of a Sand-hill, which lies alone. When you are
somewhat off from it, then it lies under the other land, that you cannot see
it, when you come from the southwards or the northwards you may see it. From
the Doodenberg unto that south end of the dry sand, it is all along a fair
strand, and flat ground. For to ride under the dry sand, you may sound about
it coming from the northwards, and get smooth water for a northwest wind, and
also for westerly winds.

A little to the northwards of the Doodenbergh lies the point called the Horn
betwixt Zuyder-zyt and Wester-zyt making there a Horn of the land: to the
southwards of it the Coast lies eastsoutheast and westnorthwest toward the
Growe-deepe: to the northwards of it north, and south toward Wester-zyt.
Wester-zyt is a village lying betwixt the Blawenbergh and the Horn.

About this point or Horn runs off a long banck about twelve leagues
westsouthwest into sea: called Reefshorne, Reefshorne.
or as some do name it Devillhorne, which lies at some places altogether dry,
specially seven or eight leagues from the shore, where it is not deeper then
two fathom and a half, or three fathom a foot less. A ship that sayleth
upon it, men can but even see it from the land it is at the deepest by the
land, to wit four fathom lacking a foot. He that comes there from the
northwards with a ship of a great draught must take very good heed, for it is
upon the northwest side off steep, that men shall have one cast two and
twenty, the next cast fifteen, and the third cast no more then three fathom.

When you fall with the land with Wester-zyt or to the northwards of
Reefshorne, you may sound along by the shore in six or seven fathom, until
you come near the foresaid Horn: you shall then also find another shoale
Riffe, that runs off from the land, called the Owl, The Owl.
which is also very steep on the north side: from the northwards you may not
come nearer it, then in seven fathom. A little to the southwardes of it
begins Reefshorne to run off from the shore, it is there a narrow banck,
you shall not find there less then three fathom, or three fathom lacking a
foot water, at two or three cast, according as it shall blow hard or soft, and
that you shall make your way, and then you shall get presently again five
fathom, and sound it about by that shoale sand, whether you desire to be.

According to the opinion of some, Doggers-sand begins from this banck. When
men set sail early in the morning out of Rinkopper deep, with a southwest
way, and a good northeast wind then they are about four of the clock in the
afternoon yet in nine fathom, whereby it should appear, that Doggers Sand
should have his beginning at this banck.

For to know the land hereabouts: About four leagues to the northwardes of the
foresaid Horn lies a high hill a little from the strand, called the
Blawenbergh, going plain down on both sides, which is somewhat blacker then
the other land, being grown with spyrie grass, to the southwards of this
Blawenbergh lies that fishers village Wester-zyt, betwixt that village and the
Horn lies one Black hommock, and also a Gentleman's house, otherwise the land
is altogether full of hommocks.

Rinkopper deep.
To the northwards of the foresaid Blawenbergh lie three or four low white
Sand-hills, and by the haven of Numen also two great white Sand-hills close one
by the other. To the northwardes of these Sand-hills runs in that Haven of
Numen, the land lies betwixt the haven of Numen, and the Doodenbergh, most
south and north about 7 leagues, all along a fair strand: the best to be
known of this Coast, is the foresaid Blawenbergh and these two foresaid white
Sand-hills.

For to sail into Rinkopperdeep Rinkopper deep
or the Haven of Numen run along by the land of West-zyt, in six or seven
fathom, until that you come to the two foresaid great white Sand-hilles, and
then you shall see upon a low land two capes, upon each of them stands a
barrel: Bring them one in the other, and then they shall stand north, or north
and by east from you, sail in right with then, and you shall find a buy,
excepit it be laid somewhere else. Right before the haven of Numen lies a
Sandplate, named Glad Jaep. Glad Iaep.
For to sail into the souther channel, then leave that plate on the larboard
side, and run in close by the south shore or foot strand (where the aforesaid
white Sandhilles do lie upon) right with the Capes, and there you cannot do
amiss, but run in boldly by it upon your lead, that is the very surest way
of all to sail in along by the strand, when men are careful of the lead.

Being past Gladde-Iaep, run then toward the north shore, you may sail
about by it so close as you will, it is a low plain point, altogether clean
and very steep. When you are come within this point, you may anchor where you
please. This channel lies in most north and north and by east, until you
come within Glad Iaep, and then somewhat more easterly toward the foresaid
point. In this channel goes an indifferent strong tide, because there lies
such a great sound within. It flows there little up and down, no more then
two foot and a half, with a common tide. A southwest and northeast Moon
makes there the highest water. Right to the northwardes of Glad Iaep runs
in another channel, but there is no more but eight foot water.

Further within the Haven of Numen it is Pilots water, but ships that are not
of great draught may well sail up, especially at a low water. The deep
runs along by the strand of Numis keeping along by it, you cannot do
amiss: so soon as you go off from it, you shall be in danger to sail
within the shoares or tails, which lie off from the Wadt toward the land of
Numit, therefore run close along by the foresaid strand of Numit so long,
until that the little Church with a flatt steeple (be about east from you
against the high land of the Holme come to the south side of the highland: then
you are within the tails and sands that lie out, leave then the strande, and
go in northnortheast, and northeast and by north, until that a round hommock
come close to the southwardes, or right over a little blew Church upon the
highland of the Holme. Go then in along northeast and by east until that
the foresaid little blew Church commerh over a Gentleman's house, beneath in the
low land, close to the water. Sail then on north, and by little and little
north and by east, until you come before Rinkoppen, it is there broad, large
and wide, and the right deep two fathom and two foot.

Rinkoppen and the havens mouth of Numen lie four leagues asunder, one from the
other.

To the northwardes of Rinkoppen goes a little river into the land, upon which
lie two little towns, seven or eight leagues in the land, the one named
Hostebro and the other Huysbuy.

A half league to the southwards of Boevenberghen goes in yet another little
haven inwardes out of the sea. named Trosmone, there stand two mastes, you must
keep them one in the other, and run so into it: there lies a little village
within called Trosmonde. From thence you may sail over the Wadt to Rinkoppen.

This little haven is not to be reckoned for a Haven because sometimes it is
cast too, and sometimes there may go in and out again Boats or Crayers and
small ships.

From Rinkopper Deep or the Haven of Numen to Boevenbergen the land lies most
north and south ten leagues, there is all along betwixt them both a fair
strand, with white sand-hills, grown with spyrie grass.

When you sail along by it, you may see the blew double land of Rinkoppen,
(called the Holmes) along over this land.

Betwixt Boevenberghen and the Reefhorne lie some banckes of seven, eight and
nine fathom, and also some that are deeper.

Boevenberg Boevenbergh.
is a long smooth hill, having in the midst a high round hommock or hill, and
upon that hill stands a church with a steeple: when you come thwart to land
with Boevenbergen, it shows it self in three hills, the middlemost is the
highest, upon which stands the foresaid church, with a flat steeple: upon
both sides of that hill stand also other churches, but they are not so high:
you may see the land in thirteen and fourteen fathom, the ground is gross
red sand with some little stones there in.

When Boevenbergen is east northeast from you, it shows it self in a long
hill, with some dale in the midst on the northside, with a church, and also a
church on the south side, and also another hill to the northwards of it.

From Boevenbergen to the Holmes the land lies northnortheast nine or ten
leagues, betwixt them it falls in with a Bight, it is blackland with
hommocks, and sandhilles grown with spyrie grass, here and there stands a
flat steeple in the land.

About five leagues from land lies a bank of ten fathom, but it lasts not
long before you get again deeper water.

The Riffe
Betwixt Boevenberghen and the Holmes lies the great Iuttish Riffe west into
sea, running over it in twelve or thirteen fathom, then lies the Naze from
you, northwest and by north 24 leagues, running over it in seventeen or
eighteen fathom, you may see the land, on the north side it is gross sand, on
the south side stony like as pease and beans.

Westnorthwest from Boevenbergen about eight leagues it is sixteen fathom
deep, gross stony sand ground: ten leagues from the land it is twenty fathom
deep gross stony land, like to pease.

Southwest and by west from Boevenbergen about nine leagues, it is 25 fathom
deep, read and black sand ground that is the ground of Doggers sand.

The Holmes Holmes.
is a plain point, going down steep on the northeast side upon the midst
of the hill stands a square church without a steeple. When that highest of of
the land is southsoutheast from you, and that you can but even see the north
end of it, then it is fifteen fathom deep, gross rough sand, with some little
stones amongst it.

Two leagues northeast, or as some say, somewhat more easterly, off from the
north point of the Holmes: to wit, betwixt the north point and the Holmes,
and the easter point, lies a stone banck (in manner as the Trindell of
Lesolde) upon which there is no more then twelve foot water, so that there
remains about two third parts of the water betwixt that Stonebanck and the
north point, and the other third part betwixt the Easter point and the
aforesaid Stonebanck: there have diverse ships been lost upon it. The
foresaid Easter point lies about four leagues to the eastwards of the Holmes,
and is also a high steep point, as if it where the Holmes. Right thwart of this
caster point shoots off a riffe almost a league off into sea, which you may
sound about in seven fathom. Some say, that men may sail through betwixt that
riffe and the land.

From the Holmes to Robsnot or Robbeknuyt, the course is northeast nine or ten
leagues.

A little to the westwards of Robsnot in the bight toward the eastern point,
nearest to Robsnot stand five churches with flat steeples. There lie also two
blewe lands, betwixt the easter point and Robsnot, in the high, you may see
also a cloven hill or sand-hill before you come to Robsnot. It is there all
along a flat strand.

To the eastwardes of the Holmes goes in a little river called Misdorp.

A little to the westwardes of that white cliffe or of Robsnot goes in also a
little River, where upon lies a little town called Werlom.

Robsnot Robsnot.
or Robbeknuyt is a high round hill, upon the top where of stands a church
with a sharp steeple. The land falls away to the eastwards from this point,
with a great bight toward Hartshals.

Thwart of Robsnot it is far off slatt, fifteen fathom depth is almost three
leagues from the shore.

There also thwart of Robsnot about sour leagues from the shore lies a banck
of nine fathom, lying along the shore.

Thwart of Robsnot lies also a rock about a league from the land.

From Robsnot to Hartshals Hartshals
it is northeast and by east four leagues, there stands a flat steeple
betwixt both, nearest to Robsnot, there you may see the high land of Lackley,
along over that high land.

Hartshals is a long smooth hill, which is at the east end somewhat steep.

Thwart of Hartshals lies a shoale or stony ground, about an English mile from
the shore, upon which (as men say) there have been ships lost, but men do
seldom come near it.

From Hartshals to the Scawe The Scawe.
or Schagen the course is eastnortheast eight leagues.

The land to the eastwards of Hartshals is altogether full of hommocks and
sand-hills, you may see the high land of Lackley also along over this land.
Along these coasts men find none such long plain hills, as are
Boevenbergen, the Holmes, Hartshals and Robsnot.

Somewhat within the point of the Scawe stands a flat Church with a slat
steeple, called Old Schagen, when that is southsoutheast from you, then there
runs off from the shore, a little spitt or shoale, there you must edge
somewhat off from the shore, otherwise it is all along a steep strand
betwixt Hartshals and the Scawe, but you may sound about this little sand in
four and five fathom, so near as you will.

Upon the east end or outermost point of the Scawe, stands a fire beakon,
like a Cape to see too: when the Church is southwest and by west from you, then
are the fire beakon and the steeple one in the other and then you are right
thwart of the riffe of the Scawe, which lies off from the point eastnortheast,
and by north almost a league into sea.

He that comes from the westward, and will sail along by the land, about
the Riffe, must especially be very careful in using the lead, he may take
the sounding of the shore, so near as he will, according as the wind shall
be, in eight, seven, six, five, four, and also well in three fathom, without
doing amiss, he need not to fear: If he be but careful in using his lead,
with a southwest wind, he may sail about it in three or four fathom.

When the fire beakon comes to the east side of the houses of the Scawe, then
you come against the west side of the riffe, when the fire beakon and the
Church are one in the other, then you are on the east side of the Riffe.

When the fire beakon comes about half ways the houses, nearest the west
side, then you are right upon the point of the Riffe, what depth that you have
then you shall keep it still, without finding it shoaler, whether you sail
along southeast or northwest.

He that comes from the southwards, and is bound about the Scaw to the
westwards may not sound the Riffe because the south side of it is steep and
needle too, it is not good to come nearer to it then in twelve, thirteen, or
fourteen fathom, especially by night or dark weather.

Marks of the Scawe riffe.
For to know by certain marks, when you are clear of this Riffe, as well
over the one side as the other, then mark, coming from the westwards, when
the old church and the firebeakon are one in the other, then you come upon the
westside of the Riffe: coming from the southwardes or the eastwardes, when the
old Church comes in the south end of the village, then you come upon the
south side of the Riffe. When the steeple and firebeacon are southwest and by
west from you, then they are one in the other, and then you are thwart of that
Riffe. When the steeple is southwest and southwest and by south from you, then
you are without, or to the westwardes of that Riffe: when the steeple or
firebeakon is westsouthwest and west and by south from you, then you are within
the riffe. This you may set by night, by the compass, and so may perceive
wether you be within or without that riffe, when the Firemaker does fire well.
You may anchor on both sides of the Riffe in seven or eight fathom, and have
room enough to set sail. Some also say, that men may run through betwixt
the riffe and the land: (If need require) in two fathom and a half.

Tides out of the Belt.
Betwixt the Scaw and Maelstrand or Norwaye it is all soft ground, the nearer to
Norway the deeper water. When men come out of the Sound, and are in the
farewaie, and can get no ground in eighteen, twenty, and two and twenty
fathom, that is a sign that they are about the riffe of the Scawe.

When you come about the Scawe from the westwardes, and are bound to the Sound
or the Belt, you must take an especial care of the tide that comes out of
the Belt, which falls commonly out of the Belt toward Norwaye, especially
when the wind has blown a while east or northeast, it can carry a shipp by
night or dark weather under Norwaye, before you should think of it, it did
happen in the year 1605, the three and twentieth of May, that a ship coming
thwart of the riffe of the Scawe, so that the riffe did ly southwest from her,
did drive with calmes in 8 hours, until she came within three leagues near
to the land of northeast, about Harmenshooft five leagues to the westwards of
Maelstrand, so great and strong a current there did shoot along by the riffe
toward the northeast, although it does seldom happen, that the tide does run
there so strong out, yet nevertheless it behooveth men to be very careful,
to consider there of, and to reckon there upon.

From the Scaw to Seabuye the course is south and by west six leagues, there
it is upon the road four and five fathom deep. Betwixt the Scaw and Seabuye lie
the small Helmes four leagues from the Scaw, and two leagues to the northwards
of Seabuye. When you will sail into the Belt, you must leave them on the
starboard side, going on still south and by west until thwart of Seabuy, you
may also sail through betwixt the Helmes and the main land unto Seabuy, if you
will, there is at the shoalest betwixt them 3 fathom water, but about a
seaboard the Helmes, betwixt the Helmes and the north end of Lesou, it is four
leagues broad, and in the channel ten fathom deep soft ground.

The lying of the Helmes, and how men shall come to anchor there, and also of
all depths, shoale and dwale grounds, betwixt the Helmes, the Scaw, and Lesou,
together with the description of the Island Lesow and the riffes that lie out
there about it is described before.

Betwixt Lesou and Seabuy lie many false grounds, which are very uneven of
three, four, five and six fathom the like uneven and shoale grounds, lie also
within or to the southwards of Seabuy, of four, five and six fathom, but the
right channel through betwixt the false grounds of Lesou; and the shoals of
Seabuy is seven and eight fathom deep.

To the southwards of the small Helms and Seabuy, nearer to the maine land then
Lesou, lie also some uneven dwale grounds, upon which there is no more water
then 10, 11, and at some places 12 foot. He that draws but 8 or nine foot
need not fear of them. You may for a need run through the small Helmes.

From Seabuy to Aelburger deep, For to fail into Aelburger deep.
the course is south and by west nine leagues, upon the north side of the haven
stands a flat steeple called Hals, in the havens mouth lies a buy, and upon
the southland stand two Capes, which you must bring one in the other, by them
you shall find the buy, the channel lies in first west and by south, about
a cables length, then you must run up northwest and west right unto Hals, and
run in by the north shore, until thwart of Hals from the south point of the
land shoots off a slat which you must avoid; being thwart of Hals you must
go southwest and by west unto the bight, and in the crooked channel, you must
shun the north shore som^what and then again northwest and by west along by
the north side, unto the second crooked, and then southsouthwest and afterward
westsouthwest unto the town, in the coming in by the buy, it is two fathom.
But for to sail in there, it is best to take a Pilot. By the south shore
goes in also a little deep of six and seven foot.

The town Aelburgh, lies up in the land four leagues, within the river. Also
there lies along this coast to the westwards some bancks, there you must
shun the land somewhat.

When you sail from the Helmes to Stevenshead, through betwixt the dwale
grounds and the flat of Seabuy, you shall meet with a shoale ground, about half
ways betwixt Stevenshead and Seabuy or 5, 6 and 7 fathom. This shoale is
called the Swetering, The Swetering,
and lies about 3 leagues eastwards from Aelburgh deep, the channel there
betwixt them is about ten or twelve fathom deep.

From Aelburgh deep to Haselin, the course is southeast and by east about 20
leagues.

From Aelburgh deep to Stevenshead Stevenshead.
the course is southeast and by south about nine leagues. There betwixt them
the land lies in a great Bay, wherein lie the two little towns Mariacker and
Randersen: Mariacker lies from Aelburgh deep south and south and by west four
leagues, and from Stevenshead five leagues. Betwixt Mariacker Mariacker.
and Stevenshaven lies the River of Randersen, Randerse^.
which runs up crooked far in to the land, unto the little town
Schandelburgh.

Under the wood of Mariacker runs a riffe from the shore, and stretches
near to Stevenshooft by Mariacker near unto the shore it is 12 foot and
further 3 and 4 fathom fair sandy ground, within the riffe it is 6 a half and
7 fathom soft ground a little without Stevenshooft it is stony ground but near
the shore it is sandy ground.

From Stevenshead to Haselin Haselin.
the course is eastsoutheast 13 leagues. Haselin is on the outer side full of
shoales, riffes, and grounds. A larger description of Haselin and Anout as also
of all the foul grounds and shoals, lying thereabouts, you shall find in the
first Demonstration of this book.

A little to the southwardes of Stevenshead lies a little town called
Oruntbuy, Oruntbuy Chalck-grounds.
there lie the Chalck-grounds right before the river of Grimsound in a bay a
little about the point of Stevenshead: that is a sand two or three foot water,
but not far off it, it is ten fathom deep, you may sound them in four fathom.
You may sail up in to Grimsound, unto Grimstee, that is a lading place for
Huyes.

From Stevenshead unto the great Helm Great Helm.
the course is southsouthwest about six leagues. The land lies from
Stevenshead unto the point of Ebeltud southsouthwest seven or eight leagues.
Ebeltud is a little Town, lying within the land thwart of the great Helm.
Betwixt the great Helm and Iutland it is six and seven fathom deep. Close by
Stevenshead, and the point of Ebeltud it is eight, nine and also ten fathom
deep. The great Helm has two Riffes, one upon the northeast side, and the
other upon the southwest side.

From Stevenshead to Siero the course is southsoutheast and south east and by
south nine leagues. Between Siero and Stevenshooft lie some shallowes but
near Stevenshooft there upon it is 3 and 4 fathom deep.

From the southeast point of Syero lies off a riffe toward Rusnes, where you
may anchor behind it.

From the great Helm unto the Island Wero, Wero.
the course is northnorthwest, and southsoutheast, four leagues distant, there
it is four and five fathom deep. From Wero there runs off a shoale unto
Kyholm, and about Kyholme: Kyholme.
and also about the little Island Samps; Samps.
it is also full of shoale grounds, which run off unto the great Island Sampso.

From the great Helm unto the Island Sampso Sampso.
it is southwest and northeast four leagues.

From the north end of the Island Sampso there shoots off a little riffe
north into the sea, you must sound close about by it for to come into the road
of Sampso, when you will anchor there. It is there in the road ten fathom
deep, and you shall be there under the Swan-grounds sheltred for all winds.

From the south end of Ebeltud to Aerhuysen, Aerhuysen
the co^rse is west and by south, and westsouthwest five leagues. It is there
all shoale water of 2 and 3 fathom deep. He that will anchor in the road before
Aerhuysen, let him bring the great steeple in the midst betwixt the two other
sharp steeples, there is the best ground, and good road in three, four, and
five fathom, so shoale as you will. To the southwards of Aerhuysen goes in the
Wedersound Wedersound.
betwixt Jutland and Sampso: he that will sail in there, must be well
acquainted, for it is there all full of riffes and shoals. You may not also use
that fareway by night, by reason of all the sand and shoals, a^ ^lso by day you
must be very careful and circumspect in ^^oking out, For to sail through the
Wedersound.
and not spare your lead, but you may anc^or and have road there every where.
When you will sail through the Wedersound, coming off from the gr at Helm or
Ebeltud, you must leave the Island T^^^s and the Swangrounds on the larboard
side, running all along by the Juttish coast in 2 or 3 fathom, until past
Horsens, or the Island Endelau, which you may not sail to, not come near from
the westwards, by reason of all the grounds, which lie before it on the west
side. It is a narrow channel betwixt Endelau, and the main land, lying from
the Wedersound through the Swan-grounds Swanne-grounds.
south, it is on both sides shoale, and but a creek for to sail through.

When you come off from the Melversound and will sail through the Wedersound,
it is best to run along by the Juttish side until thwart of the river of
Horsens, then you must edge somewhat off there from the land, and sail right
with the Island Tons, and so you run through betwixt the Norther and Souther
grounds, leaving the Island Tons on the starboard side. When you are then past
Tons, you shall run out close by the north point of Sampso, toward the land
of Ebeltud, it is altogether one course from Horsens to Tons, and forth to
Sampso, and the point of Ebeltud, to wit, northeast and southeast eight or nine
leagues.

From Horsens, or that Island Endelaw unto the Melversound, Melversound.
the course is south and south and by west, 7 or 8 leagues. The Melversound is
a deep sound of 20 and 25 fathom, very crooked to come into, it goes in
betwixt Fuynen and Jutland, which are both high lands. From the Island Ebelo
unto Melversound the course is southwest and southwest and by south five great
leagues.

From the road of Sampso to Ebelo the course is south and by west 5 leagues.
From the south end of Sampso to Ebelo Ebelo.
the course is southwest and by south 4 leagues.

From Sampso to Roems Roems.
the course is southeast and by south six leagues. The northwest coast of
Fuynen lies southwest and by west eight leagues. The little Island Ebelo lies
off a league from the same, right before Bowens, but you cannot sail through
betwixt the Island and Fuynen. To the southwards of the Island lies a great
rock under water, betwixt this rock and the Island is the road before Bouwens
Road before Bounes.
in eight and nine fathom.

Betwixt Syro and Wero lies a dangerous riffe, long and broad, lying further
then half way to Syro. When you will run through betwixt the two foresaid
Islands a weather of Russenesse, you must leave at least the two third parts of
the water on the side of Wero, and go in southsouthwest toward Roems, which
is nine leagues distant.

The foresaid riffe is called Haters riffe, Haters riffe.
is on the east side very hard and stony, he that comes from Balt-sack, he
shall run close to the Island Wero, for to avoid that riffe, the channel
betwixt the riffe and Wero is not very broad, and 3 fathom, or 3 fathom and a
half deep. He that comes from Roems or Rusnes, and will sail through Wero
sound, let him bring the great Helm to the east side of Wero, and keep them so
standing sailing on so right with them, he shall (so doing) take no hurt of
Haters riffe. Betwixt Syro and Haters riffe and somewhat more southwardly, the
ground is very uneven of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 fathom. On the south side of Haters
riffe it is good anchoring for northerly winds, in six and seven fathom.

Rusnes and Syro lie northnortheast and southsouthwest about five leagues a
sunder.

From the point of Rusnes runs off a little riffe to seawards, but to the
eastwards of it betwixt Rusnes and Haselyn, lies off a riffe at least two
leagues into sea, which lies dry at the end, and by it, it is very steep,
close along by the end, it is eight fathom deep.

From Rusnes to Spro it is south and by east eight or nine leagues. Betwixt
Rusnes and Spro lies Callenburch, Callenburgh.
which is also a lade place, and about 2 leagues to the southwards of
Callenburch lies a flat along the coast about a league from the shore of
five fathom depth, you must also avoid the south corner of Callenburgh, for
there shoots off a riffe half a league into sea, there is also to the
northwards a long flat along the shore, but not deep to the seawards,
between Callenburgh and Rusnes it is good lying for an easterly wind.

From the east end of Spro runs off a little riffe or ledge of rocks, and
over against it comes also a flat shooting off from the land, betwixt them
both it is four and five fathom deep. Going on the south side of Spro it is
also very foul, more then half a league without the shore. But behind or
thwart of Spro lies Casseur, Casseur.
a fair Haven, where men do lie at the Kay, and let their goods be carried
into the ships, where also it is between both forty, fifty, and sixty fathom
deep, but in the middle of the fareway lie some banks, where there is no more
then five and six fathom water, good strand ground.

From Spro to Langeland the course is south and south and by east four leagues
distant. He that comes along to the eastwards of Wero, through the channel
betwixt Wero and Haters riffe, and will sail to Roems, let him go on due south
and by east, and then he shall run along about an English mile to the
eastwards of the Boltsack, and fall with the land a little to the eastwards of
Roems: likewise he that goes from Roems, or a little to the eastwards of it,
on north and by west, he shall fall betwixt Wero and Haters riffe right in the
fareway. Betwixt Roems and Fuynen you may run through in two fathom, but with
great ships you cannot go through there.

From the north end of Fuynen shoots off a little riff about an English mile
into sea. About a league east and by north from Roems lies a shoale of 3, 4,
and 5 fathom, which is steep, and shoaleth up so suddenly, that a man, not
knowing of it, and finding it so by the lead, should be affrighted at it, To
the southwards of Roems, in the land of Fuynen lies a little town, for to
lade, called Cartemonde. Cartemonde.
The Haven goes in from the eastwards, and it is shoale on the west side,
there lie no buys in the Havens mouth, there is no more water then five, six,
or sometimes seven foot.

From Roems to Spro, the course is southeast 5 leag. Betwixt Spro Spro.
and Knuytshead, it is 12, and 13 fathom deep. But betwixt Roems and Spro, it
is 10, and 11 fathom deep.

Even about to the southwards of the point of Knuytshead in Buyen, lies the
Haven of Nyburgh, Nyburgh
when you are about the point, you run right up to the town, about
northwest, a league, there it is 6, and 7 fathom deep. Men do lie there with
ships to the Kay, and let their goods be carried in what they will.

From Knuytshead to Langeland the course is southeast 4 leagues, and then you
leave Spro lying on the starboard side. From the southwest end of Spro shoots
off a little riffe which you must avoid. At the north end of Langeland lie the
little Islands of the Frissell, The Frissell.
which are round about very foul. From Knuytshead to the Islands Tassing, the
course is south and south and by east four leagues, and then you leave the
Frissell lying on the larboard side, and run through betwixt the Frissell and
Fuynen. If you be bound to Swineburgh, Swinburg
then go from the Frissell to the southeast end of Fuynen, on southsouthwest,
and you shall meet a little Island which you may run about on both sides of
it. Through betwixt Tassing, and that little Island, or you may run along by
the land of Fuynen, until that you come to the little Town of Swineburgh,
which lies over against the Island of Tassing. Over against the point of
Fuynen lies a little Island called Olms, Olmes.
then you must go up to the westwards. You may also run about on the other
side of Tassing, and leave the Island Arr with the foul grounds (which lie
betwixt Arr and the southeast end of Fuynen) on the larboard side of you, it is
no deeper upon these grounds then six foot. Now when as that you shall come by
the little Island Olms, or by the southeast point of Fuynen, then you must (as
before is said) go up to the westwards about the point of Fuynen toward
Woburgh. Upon the south side of these foresaid grounds goes also a Deep
through, west, and west and by south through betwixt the grounds and the Island
Arr: upon this Island Arr lies a little Town called Koping. Koping.
This foul ground is 3 leag. long, and that Island Arr is also 3 leagues long,
they lie both of them east and west, and the Munk Island lies at the end of
these grounds before Woburgh in Fuynen, which has two riffes, the one shoots
off from the southeast end east into sea, the other from the north point
northeast into the sea. When you sail through to the northwards of these
grounds, to wit, betwixt Fuynen and these grounds, toward Woburgh, you shall
also meet with the foresaid Munk, with another little Island or two more, leave
them lying on the larboard side, and run all along by the land of Fuynen, about
west and west and by north. Unto the point of Askens, Askens.
which is about six leagues distant from the southeast point.

From the east point of Askens unto the little Island Toreu, Toreu.
the course is west and by north, and westnorthwest two leagues, and to Areu
westsouthwest 3 leagues, these two little Islands lie one over against the
other, the one on the side of Jutland, and the other on the side of Fuynen, men
run through there betwixt 2 riffs which run off one against the other, it is
there 4 and 5 fathom deep.

To the northwards or westwards of Areu lies the Sound of Haddersleu, Sound of
Haddersleu.
which lies in about west and by south, upon it lies the town Haddersleu two
leagues within the land.

From Areu or Toreu to Melversound the course is northnorthwest five leagues,
which you must run into from the southwards first westwards unto the sound of
Coldingen, Sound off Coldinge^.
being a broad Sound, which goes a league into the land, if you will go
through the Melversound, you must leave it on the larboard side, and go up to
the eastwards unto the town of Melver, where you come then again into a
crooked channel. The Melversound goes out to the northwards with a very
crooked channel, and you come out again upon the broad water to the
northwards of Fuynen, as is before said. You may also sail off from Areu into
the sound of Aelsem along southsouthwest unto Apenrade, Apenrade
and then about behind the Island of Aelsems until you come into the sound of
Flesburgh,

The Melversound and the little Island Areu lie southsoutheast and
northnorthwest one from the other.

To sail out of the Aelsen sound from Areu or the Melversound, then go from
Areu or Toreu unto the Roen The Roe^
eastsoutheast 3 leagues, and then through betwixt the Island and Fuynen, that
is along to the northwards of Roen, for you can not go about to the
southwards of it. The Roen is a bad and shoaly riffe shooting off from Aelsen,
whereunto it is fast, the outer end of it lies dry like Anoutriffe. From the
Roen to Arr or Koping the course is east and by south 5 leagues.

From the south east end of Aelst shoots off a great riffe toward Arr called
the Poles riffe: Poles riffe
you must run betwixt Arr and that riffe, leaving two third parts of the water
on the Aelsen side, and one third part toward Arr, and run on so with the
south end of Langeland, until that you come against Copen.

From Arr to the south end of Langeland, the course is eastsoutheast, four
leagues. And from the Poles riffe to the south end of Langeland, the course is
west and west and by north six leagues. You may run through betwixt Langeland
and Arr to the northwards and come out again into the Belt by Nyburgh: from
the south end of Langeland to Tassing, Tassing.
it is north six leagues; you may sail about Tassing on both sides, and leave
Arr and the foul grounds, lying on the one side of you. Upon these grounds it
is but 6 foot deep.

You may also sail through betwixt the foresaid grounds and Fuynen into the
sound of Aelsen, unto the little Islands of Areu and Toreu, as has been said
here before.

From the little Island Areu to Apenrade the course is south and by west five
leagues. The sound of Apenrade is a broad open sound, upon which lies the
foresaid town of Apenrade.

From the river of Apenrade unto the crooked channel of Sonderburgh, The sound
of Apenrade.
which goes in betwixt the Island Aelsen and the maine land, the course is
east 3 leagues, there you may sail through about behind the Island of Aelsen
to Sonderburgh, and then forth into the sound of Flensburgh. It is very narrow
and crooked betwixt the Island and the maine land, but when you are come
through the narrow and crooked channel into the sound of Flensburg, there it
is broader and larger.

The sound of Flensburgh Sound of Flensburg
goes in betwixt Senderburgh and Holsterland, being a broad sound. He that
will sail in there, must take very good heed of the Holsterside, when you
begin to come betwixt the two lands, and run in along by the land of Aelst,
Calck-ground.
for from Nubell or Holsterland lie off the Chalck grounds half ways the
deep. This sound lies in west and by south until that you come before the
river. There lies in the rivers mouth a little Island on the starboard side,
you must run into the eastwards of it, and go in west and by south and west,
until you come within the crooked channel of the River or Sound, and then you
must go up again southwest then you shall see the town of Flensburgh lie
before you.

To the southwards of the Sound of Flensburgh, lie yet three Sounds or rivers,
where great ships may go into, to wit, the Sley, Nylhofvoert and the Sound of
Kiel, the land lies off from Flensburgh to Kiel south southeast or somewhat
more easterly six leagues.

From Sonderburgh to the Sley The Sley.
the course is southeast and by east four leagues, that is, a broad deep
sound, lying in first about west, and when you are within it; then it runs
in about southwest and by west past Sleeswyke, there also come out many great
ships. The town Gottorpe lies also upon this river.

Betwixt the Sleye and Kiel lies Nylhofvoert, Neylhofvoert.
upon it lies a little town calle^ ^eckelenfoort.

The sound of Kiel Kiel.
is a broad Sound, with lies in about southwest, there you may go in also with
great ships. From Kiel to the west end of Femeren it is east and by north about
eight leagues.

From the Poles riff to Femeren Femeren.
(over the Coelberger Heyd) the course is eastsoutheast 13 or 14 leagues, but
from the south end of Langeland unto Femeren it is south east and by east eight
leagues. The channel betwixt Femeren and Laland is 5 and 6 fathom deep, you
may sail round about Femeren; there it is all shoale ground. Betwixt Femeren
and Holsterland, you may run through in eight or ten foot, there lies a little
town, called Heyliger haven, Heyligerhaven.
where you may anchor with ships of small draughts for to lade wheat or barley.
From the Island Femeren to Gester-rif the course is east and by north ten
leagues. But from Femeren to the Trave of Lubeck southsouthwest ten leagues:
there goes in a good deep for great ships, it is deep upon the banck twelve
foot water.

There is also a great bay and a good haven, where men may lie safe for all
winds, except the northeast and northnortheast winds. From the Trave of Lubeck
to Gester-rif the course is northeast and southwest about nineteen leagues.

Deep of Wismer.
From the Trave of Lubeck to Wismer-deep the course is first northeast and by
east, and then eastnortheast, there goes in a fair deep for all sorts of
ships.

For to sail in at the deep of Wismer, bring the steeple upon the south land
south from you, and sail so in until that the steeple standing upon the east
land, by that eastermost house, comes to the five or six houses, by these
houses stand some trees together, from that east land runs off a little
riffe, lying off northwest and by north from it, when the steeple comes to
those houses, then go in southsoutheast, in that deep is twelve foot-water.
In the Summer there lie two buys in the havens mouth^, the one upon the tail
of the sand that shoots off from the eastland, and the other upon the shoale
ground, you must run in betwixt them. This deep of Wismer lies from Femeren
southsoutheast distant about seven or eight leagues, but from Wismer to Gester
riffe, the course is northnortheast, twelve or thirteen leagues.

About south from Gester riffe lies Rostick, Rostick.
there goes in also a good deep of ten foot, it is there very flatt, you may
sound it in on both sides with the sounding pole. Wismer and Rostick lie about
eight leagues asunder.

Somewhat to the eastwards of Rostick lies a high land called Robbenesse,
Robbenesse.
from it shoots off a great riffe or shoale to seawards, toward Gester
riffe, it is betwixt Gester riffe and that shoale not deeper then twelve or
thirteen fathom. If you ^ome nearest to Gester riffe, then it does shoale up
suddenly, but if you come nearest this shoale, then it shoaleth by little and
little. Gester riffe, as has been beforesayd, is a shoale riffe, and runs
off at least three leagues into sea.

A little too the eastwards of this foresaid shoale lies Barts, Barts.
there goes in a deep of six foot, at the west point goes off a riffe,
which men must avoid.

The Island Langeland is about eight leagues long, and lies south and north,
to the eastwards, over against it lies the Golversound, Golversound.
lying into the northwards of Laland, all along up unto Nestvelt and
Wordenburgh, and comes into the Greensound, and into the Wolvegat, and again
into the east sea: Before the Golversound lie three little Islands the one at
the point of Laland, which is called Wedero, Wedero.
and is also fast to it with a riff, so that men cannot sail through there
betwixt them; to the northwards of it men do run into the Golversound,
leaving that Island on the starboard side: the other two lie to the northwards
of the foresaid Island of Wedero, the one is called Arnis, and the other Ooms.
Arnis Ooms.
Ooms is a little plain Island, but Arnis is the greatest, which lies nearest
to Zealand, and is full of trees. From the Island Ooms, lies off a riffe
southwest to seawards, which is a great league long, and upon the end flatt,
which men may run over by the lead. When you will sail into the Golversound,
you must leave these two Islands lying on the larboard side. The Island Laland
has upon the west point over against the south end of Langeland, a riffe or
Hook, Riffe on Laland.
lying off from Laland at least half ways over the Belt: for to avoid that,
you must run along within an English mile to the eastwards of Langeland; or
when that you leave the two third parts of the water on Lalands side, and the
other third part on the side of Langeland, you shall not come too near it.
When you come from the southwards, and are bound into the Belt, and that then
the steeple of Mascon, which stands upon Laland comes to stand northeast
and by east from you, then you are past that riffe, and lies to the
southwardes of you: It is here in this Channel betwixt Laland and the south
end of Langeland, five, six, and seven fathom deep.

From the south end of Langeland to Femeren the course is southeast and
southeast and by east distant eight leagues.

When as you come off from Langeland and are past the riffe or Hook of Laland,
then the south coast of Laland lies east and west: along by it lies a sand,
which is called the Red-sand, Redsand.
and lies along until before Golversound which runs in betwixt Laland
and Gester.

To the northwards of this sand is a road of fourteen, sixteen, and eighteen
foot water, before the little towns of Aelholm and Roo-buy, Aelholme Roobuye.
where men do lade nuts and Bar^^^.

Betwixt Laland and Gester, thwart of this Red-sand (as has been said) runs
in the Golversound, which men may run into, and come out again into the Belt,
but in this sound or channel there is little depth, there lies a stone banck
within thwart over the channel. The little town Nicoppen lies upon the Island
Falster a league within Gester. Nicoppen Gester rif.
From Gester shoots of Gester riffe, at least three leagues into sea, which
is a shoale riffe.

To the eastwards of Gester riff lies an Island called Bout, Bout.
it is there abouts all shoale water; to wit, three and four fathom.

To the eastwards of Bout goes in the Green sound, Green-sound.
by the little town Stuybekuype, and comes out again into the Belt to the
northwards of Laland: the Green sound lies in about west and west and by north
in three fathom, there lies a shoale on the larboard side of the mouth of the
Sound, called the Tolck, Tolck.
which men must avoid: you must go into the eastwards of it, you may lead it
in along by the land of Meun, in fourteen or fifteen foot, that foresaid town
Stuybekuype Stuybekuyp.
lies about a league within the mouth of the channel.

From Gester riff to Meun, the course is northnortheast seven leagues: but from
Bout to Meun it is northeast about six leagues.

From the Gelversound to Meun, Meun.
the land lies in a bay you may anchor there for a northeast, north,
northwest, and west wind, in five and six fathom.

He that comes out of the Sound, and is bound to the southwards of Meun, may
come so near Meun as he will, and luffe up to the westwards by the point, and
anchor where he please, in five or six fathom. On the north side of Meun you
may also anchor in six fathom, behind a little riffe that shoots off from
the north point, for an east, southsouthwest and westwind, it is there all over
flat, and good ground.

Of the depths about these places, and in what depths men may see the land.
In the Ripe, Eyder and Hever, a south and north Moon makes the highest
water, the flood comes there out of the northwest, and the ebb out of the
southeast, and so run over the north grounds.

In the deep of List or Silt, a south and north Moon makes the highest water,
the flood comes there out of the northwest, and falls very little along
the land, and the ebb to the contrary.

In Knuytsdeep, a southsouthwest and northnortheast Moon makes the highest
water. The flood comes there also out of the northwest and falls, but a
great quarter tide along the land, and the ebb to the contrary.

In the Haven of Zuyder-zyt, the Growe-deepe, the Schellinghkroegh a
southsouthwest and northnortheast. Moon makes the highest water, the flood
comes there also out of the northwest and falls over the Reefshorne toward
the Iuttish Island, and the ebb again to the contrary, off from the land in
the north Sea.

Of the grounds and Depths.
The grounds of the Hever and the banks of the Small deep without Strand and
Eyderstee, lie at least two leagues without the coast of the land.

Betwixt Holyland and Ameren or Strand it is ten or eleven fathom deep, in
that depth you may see both the lands, if you climb up in the shroudes. Strand
is to be known by the steeple of Pielworme, standing upon the south end of
the land: Upon the Island Strand stand more Churches and steeples, but none so
easy to be known as Pielworme.

Ameren is a league and a half long, and has all along low sandhills grown
with spiry grass.

The Island Silt you may see in ten fathom: Upon this Island (nearest to the
north end) lies a high ^^eepe red cliffe, on both sides going sloping down;
upon the south side of the cliffe stands a flat Church, with a low steeple,
and to the eastwards of it another Church, with a high thick steeple called
Heydom. The north end of the Island is called List, and the south end Voortrap.

Island Maelstrand.

Out-rockes, or Paternosters.

Eastnortheast.



THe Paternosters Pater-nosters.
are a great rane of Rocks, which lie far off to seawards from the Coast,
behind them, to wit, on the south side, goes in within the land a broad
sound, upon the south side of it lies a great high round rock or hill, called
Britto. To the southwards of that sound lies the Island of Maelstrand. He that
comes from the Scaw, and desired to sail to Maelstrand, let him go on
eastnortheast, and then he shall get sight of the foresaid hill Britto, which
he shall set eastnortheast from him, and sail so in right with it, until that
he comes by the Pater-nosters, he must leave on the larboard side, and sail
along by them eastnortheast, and east and by north, and then he shall run
in sight of the Island Maelstrand, upon which stands a great stony beacon, or
Warlock, where sometimes stands a mast with a barrel upon it, and sometimes
also there stands none. You may run in on both sides the Island, either about
to the northwards, or to the southwards of it, according as shall be best
fitting for the wind: If the wind be at west or southwest, then you may best
run in at the norther channel, or rif the wind be at south, or southeast,
then it is best to run at the souther channel. The norther channel lies in
by the south side most east and by south, and eastsoutheast, but the souther
channel east and east and by north. When you come within the Island, you may
sail about by it, until you come before the town, which you shall see then
lying before you. Men do Pas caarte vant SCHAGER-RACK vande Pater-nosters aen

anchor there with an anchor to seawards out a head, and make fast a cable out
a stearne on the kaye, lying so with the stearne to the shore.

About the midst, going in at the souther channel, lies a rock above water,
which you may sail about on both sides, but within that rock lies a suncken
rock under water, and to the southwardes of it also a great rock, but a little
further out then the other. There lies also a suncken rock under water by the
Island on the north side of the foresaid rock which lies above water, which
men must be very careful to take heed of. There is every where good anchor
ground. From thence you may sail through within the rocks to Calf-sound,
Calfsound
Bahouse and Nilus.

Calf-sound lies distant from Maelstrand about four leagues. For to sail in
there out of the sea, you must run (...) along to the southwards of a great
rock, whereupon stands a Warder. On the south side of the Havensmouth there
are great rocks, but on the north side all small rocks. When you come within
the rocks about the point of the north land, there you may anchor in fifteen or
sixteen fathom, there is good anchor ground. From Calfsound you may run up to
the southwards, through within the rocks unto the river of Nilus.

Four leagues southsoutheast from Calf-sound, lies the Island Winneu, to the
southwards of it goes in the channel of Nilus or Gottenbergh, which is a
large and broad sound, lying in northnortheast, in 8, 9, and 10 fathom, you
must leave Winneu on the larboard side, and run in betwixt the point of the
main land, called Kalderhead, and the Island little Denmarck, and then in
along by the main land on the south side until past Elsburgh to Gottenburgh,
Gottenburgh.
it is there all clean and clear without any danger that might hurt you.

You may also sail into the northwards of Winneu, then you must leave Winneu,
and also some long rocks on the starboard side, and the through Island, or
little Denmarck, on the larboard side, and then in along by the point of the
mayn land, on the south side, as is before said.

Three leagues southsouthe from Winneu lie Malesound and Consback: Malesound
Malesound.
is a rough Island, which you may sail round about in seven or eight fathom,
under it is also good road. Two cables length westnorthwest from Malesound,
lies a suncken rock under water, and also one even with the water, a bow shot
from the land, whereupon stands a Warder.

Eastnortheast from Malesound lies the haven of Cons-back, Consback
there stand 2 great Warders, each upon a rock close to the land, betwixt them
lies in the haven, it is a fair haven, ten fathom deep, and good anchor
ground, when you come about the low point you shall see Cons-back lie to the
northwards of you.

From Malesound southwest and southwest and by west, a great league to
seawards, lies the foul and dangerous rock Nyng or Nijding: Nyding.
The land upon Nyng is about a half league long. The riffe on the north end
runs till about a league on the land northeast, and is a half league broad,
wholly riffe, with sharp stones. Upon some places eight, seven, five, and four
foot water. The tail, which shoots southerly down, is narrow, and runs
from the land northeast about 2 leagues: There upon is 5, 4, and 3 foot water.
A league and a half without Nynger-Riffe, northwest, men may stay upon 6 and 7
fathom. You may sail through betwixt Nyding and Malesound, or the mayn land,
but it is there all shallow water. Upon Nyding is a fire-beacon, whereupon they
make fire every night.

From Nyding to Watersbergen Watersbergen.
the course is southeast 5 leagues, betwixt them (three leagues to the
southwards of Malesound) lies Monstersound, Monstersound.
that is a river or Sound, which runs up into the land, upon it lie some
towns as Vlymenes, Horn, and Gosewater. From Monstersound 3 leagues to the
southwardes, lies Watersbergen. For to sail in there, you must run in by the
east land. At the point of the Island which lies on the northwest side before
the haven, lies a rock under water, and from the point where the castle
stands upon, lies also a suncken rock, buth which you must avoid, and
therefore run in amidst the channel, betwixt Nydingh.

Great stones.

the foresaid Island and the main land, where the castle stands upon the
point, and anchor when you come within the point right against the castle in 4
or 5 fathom. For to sail into Watersbergen by marks, you must bring Old Boey
to the north side of the castle, and go on northnorthe. there lies a rock
even with the water, which you must leave on the starboard side, and anchor
right against the castle in 4 or 5 fathom as before is said.

Three leagues to the southwards of Watersbergen lies the river of
Valckenburgh. Valckenburgh.
On the north side of the Riversmouth lies an Island, called Murupting, and 3
leagues to the southwards of it, lies an Island, called Tullo, Tullo.
betwixt that Island and Valckenburgh, within the land, lies a high hill,
called Haver, being white to see to, as if it were sandy Land: sea faring men
do name it young Coll, because of the likeness of height and fashion, which it
has like Col, and sometimes it is mistaken for Coll.

Three leagues eastwards from Tullo, lies Helmstee Helmstee
upon a river, but there can go in no ships, but only huyes and boats.

This river of Helmstee lies within a great Inlet about southsouthwest 4
leagues from Swedereur.

Kol over these two Warders s. w. from you.

Swedereur



Two leagues southwards from Helmstee lies the little town, or little castle,
called Laholm, Laholm.
there goes also a little river into the land. A league westwardes from
Laholme lies Bosstadt, these places lie in a great bay.

Swedereur.
Three leagues to the westwardes of Bosstadt lies the Island Swedereur, you
may run in behind it at both sides, for to anchor from the northwardes, it is
there large and broad for to go in: but from the north end of Swedereur
shoots off a little ledge of rocks, you must run along to the northwards
of the rocks, that lie at the north end of Swedereur leaving them on the
starboard side, and anchor behind the Island, betwixt the great and little
rocks in seven fathom, thwart of the little white church of Turcko, so that
the great rock with the two warders at the south end be southwest from you,
and Col stand over the foresaid Rock, there it is best lying, and there you are
landlockt for all winds. If you will run out again to the southwards of it, then
leave the two rocks with the Warders on the starboard side, and run boldy
close about by them, toward Coll.

He that comes off from Anout, and by reason of southerly winds cannot run
a weather Col, let him go from Col northeast and by north toward Swedereur,
and run close about by the two foresaid rocks with the Warders, at the south
end of Swedereur, until he come behind the Island, and anchor, as is before
said, there it is soft ground. A north wind blows there open in.

From Swedereur to Coll Coll.
the course is southwest and by south, betwixt both lies a great baye, upon
which lies that little town Engelholme, where men also may ride.

For to sail from the Scaw to Coll.
From the Riffe of the Scawe to the Island Lesou the course is southsoutheast,
but the point of the Riffe and the Trindel lie due southeast and northwest
eight leagues asunder.

The Island Lesou Lesou.
is compassed round about with foul Dwaelgrounds, riffs and sands, that lie
off. From the southeast end where the Church stands upon, lies off such a
great riffe or shoale from the shore, that about 3 leagues from the land to
the southwards of it, it is not deeper then two fathom, there under it you may
make rode for a southsoutheast wind. Likewise from the southwest point, lies
off such a great shoale, that when the foresaid flatt church is east, and
eastnortheast from you, you cannot come near the land within three leagues.
But the north end you may come so near, that you may have rode under it for a
southerly and southeast wind, in three, four, five, six and seven fathom, the
church being about south from you.

Riffe of Lesou.
From the northeast end lies off also a riffe right toward the Trindel, which
you may sound about, when you sail through betwixt Lesou and the Trindell,
which is the nearer Lesou the shoaler, and the nearer the Trindell the deeper.
Close by the Trindell on the Inner side or west side, it is deep five and six
fathom.

The Trindell Trindel.
is a stony sand-plate, three cornerd, and somewhat long of fashion, it is no
more then four foot deep, and about two Akers of land great, and lies most
along the farewaye, lying from the northeast end of Lesou northeast, or a
little more easterly about 3 leagues distant. On the northeast side of the
Trindell lies always a great buy, whereby you may know it a far off.

Depths about the Scaw.
When the point of the Scaw is northwest and by west about a league from you,
there it is seventeen and eighteen fathom deep, but when the point lies west,
and west and by south from you, about a league, there it is four or five and
thirty fathom deep.

But he that comes sailing about the Scaw, and runs without the riffe in
ten, eleven, or twelve fathom, and goes on from thence southeast, or
southsoutheast, keeps a long while still the depth fifteen and sixteen fathom
at least the space of three leagues, before he get twenty, or five and twenty
fathom. When as that you begin to get again shoaler water of ten, eight,
seven, and six fathom, that goes then through within the Trindell. When as you
shall meet with the foresaid depth of the shoaling, and sail yet further on
southsoutheast, then you must be very careful to use your lead of then,
because of the foresaid shoale, which lies off from the northeast end of Lesou
toward the Trindell, you may run over it (as is said) in five, four, and so
well (in the narrow) in three fathom. When the northeast point of Lesou
begins to come southsouthwest from you, then you come on against the riff or
shoale but when the point is southwest from you, then you are over the shoalest
of the riffe. When the west end of Lesou is southwest, and the church southwest
and by south from you, then you are about thwart of the buy of the Trindell.

Four leagues south and by west from the Scaw lie the smal-Helmes, not far from
the shore, The Helmes.
there are three little Islands, the southermost the Iuttes do call the Deynen
or the Dee, the midlemost Holmes, and the northermost Grasholme, by them lies
yet another little Island. You may sail throug between the southermost and the
middlemost, but then you must run nearest the southermost, through betwixt
them is four fathom water.

Under the Helmes is good road for southeast, southsoutheast and southerly
winds. He that will go to anchor under them, coming from the Scawe, must
run to the strand in three fathom, and run so along by it, in between
the strand and the Helmes, until that he be within the rocks, there he may
anchor, he may also well run through along by the footstrand in 3 fathom.
When the rocks of the Helms are east, and east and by north from you, there is
the road in 4 fathom and 4 fathom and a half. The best road for to ly under the
Helms with small ships, is betwixt the southermost and middle most little
Island, somewhat nearer the main land then the Islands: but for great ships it
is best to lie by the Grasholme.

He that will not lie so far within the Helmes, may also anchor farther out
under the high land of Lacklou, so that the Helms be southeast from him, in
four, five, or seven fathom, there it is also very good lying for south and
southsoutheast winds, in clean ground of small white and black sand.

Betwixt the Scawe and the Helmes in the farewaye it is deep eighteen, sixteen,
and fifteen fathom. Betwixt the Helmes and the maine land, there is at the
shoalest three fathom water. When you come from the northwardes through betwixt
them until you come thwart of the south end of the rocks, there runs off a
little riffe from the Helmes toward the strand, where the great stones lie
called Bourser riffe, but keeping in three fathom, you cannot take hurt of that
riffe. You may well run out again by that south end toward Zeabuy. So that
you may sail round about the Helmes with ships that are not of very great
draughts.

Betwixt the Helmes and Lesou, a good ways from the Helmes, it is 20 and 25
fathom deep, soft ground, but one league from the Helms lie some rocks or
shoals, where of you must take heed.

To the westwardes of Lesou lie the Dwaelgrounds, Dwaelgrounds.
to the northwards of the foresaid riff, that lies off from the southwest
point of Lesou, where the flat church stands upon. Which are very uneven of
three, four, five, and six fathom deep. Of these and more other shoals and
uneven grounds betwixt Lesou and Zeabuy, read the description off the norther
part of the Belt. Rocks betwixt Lesou and the Helmes.


About a league northnorthwest from the west end of Lesou, southsoutheast
somewhat southerly from the point of the Scaw, and eastsouthe. from the little
Helmes, there lie two or three little low Islands or rocks, a little above
water; betwixt these Holmkens, and the Helms, it is twenty fathom, but betwixt
these Holmkens and Lesou five fathom deep, to the northwards of them is far
flat, four and five fathom deep sand ground.

If you will sail by night off from the Helmes or from the high land of Lacklie
toward Lesou with a southwest or southsouthwest wind, then sail no nearer
because of these little Islands and shoals then southeast and by east, with
that course you shall run over those shoals or flats (lying to the northwards
from the foresaid Holmkens) in six or seven fathom, afterward it will be deeper
again, nine, ten and twelve fathom, go then on eastsoutheast so long until
that the east end of Lesou be southwest from you. When that east end begins
to come south and by west from you, then you come on against that flat, or rif,
which shoots off from the northeast end of Lesou toward the Trindell. It
does shoale up from 14, 12, and 10 fathom, unto 8, 6, and four, and also to
three fathom. If you be somewhat near to Lesou, three fathom lasts a good
whiles, and then it will be again deeper, four, six, ten and fifteen fathom,
and then very deep. When that foresaid northeast end of Lesou is southwest
from you, then you are clear of that flat. The Helmes and the Trindel lie east
and by south and west and by north seven leagues asunder.

For to sail within the Trindell.
When you come from the Scaw with a southwest or westsouthwest wind, and that
you will sail through within the Trindel, that is, betwixt the Trindel and
Lesou, it is best that you go such a course, that you may make your ways good
southeast and by south, and then you shall run along about the midst of the
channel, through betwixt the Trindel, and the foresaid low rocks, (which lie
northnorthwest off from the north point of Lesou, and southsoutheast from the
point of the Rif of the Scaw.) At the deepest in this farewaye, betwixt the
Scaw and Lesou, it is 23 and 24 fathom, being past over that, you shall come
against a banck of eight, seven, and six, and also into five fathom. and then
you shall be about due west, or a little more northerly or southerly from the
buy upon the Trindel. Afterward it will be again deeper, if you be in the
right fareway, to wit, seven, eight, ten, and also well twelve fathom.

Not for to sail within the riff, or the northeast point of Lesou, it is good
to run then somewhat more easterly, to wit, southeast or southeast and by
east, until you come against the foresaid riff that lies off from the
northeast point of Lesou, which you may sound, and so run about by it in
five, four, and also three fathom. When the northeast point of Lesou, (that is
the point with hommocks) is south and by west from you, then you come against
the rif, and when that point is southsouthwest from you, then you are right
thwart of the rif, but when the point is southwest from you, then you shall be
past and clear of the rif. Being gotten about it toward Anoute, it will be
deep thirty, five and thirty, and also forty fathom.

He that comes by night about the Trindell, must not spare his lead, on the
outer side, that is on the east side of the Trindle you may not come nearer it
by night, then nine or ten fathom, and then you shall not befarre off from it.

When you sail close along without the Trindell in clear weather, and that
you stand without board, upon the bendes of the ship with your feet by the
water, then you can even see Lesou. If that then in clear weather standing so
without the ship, you cannot see Lesou, when you are about thwart of the
Trindle then you run far enough along without the Trindle.

Depths betwixt Anout and Lesou.
The Trindle and the riffe of Anout lie northwest and southeast, or as some say
southsoutheast and northnorthwest nine or ten leagues a sunder. Betwixt
Anoute and Lesou in the right farewaye it is five and twenty fathom deep, but
to the westwards of it, to wit, right betwixt the Islands Anout and Lesou it is
shoale water; of seven and eight fathom, you may sail there over these flats
and shoals through betwixt Anout and Lesou into the Belt.

Anout is upon the west side very foul, and far off to seawards from it,
lie many uneven dwaelgrounds of two, three and four fathom.

When you sail with a southwest or westerly wind from Lesou to Anout, and
run over the flat of Lesou in three or four fathom, you need not sail on
more easterly then southeast and by east, although it be by night, you shall
with such wind and course run clear enough of Anout. When as that you reckon
to have the length of the riffe, go then on southsoutheast; and south and by
east, for to sail a wether of Coll. But by day or when you can see about you,
not more leewardly then southsoutheast. When you sail off from the foresaid
point of Lesou to Anout, with a southwest or westsouthwest wind, as is before
said and make reckoning to come by night by Anout, then you can not do better;
as to go eight, ten or twelve glass, (according as the wind shall blow
fresh) on southsoutheast, until you come against the shoaling of Anout, and
look for the day, that running not to far to leewards off the point of the
riffe, you may the better get a weather of Col. Likewise, when you come off
from Col with a southwest or southerly wind, and run about a half league
along without Coll, you need not also sail more northerly, then northwest
and by north, that goes also a good way along to leewards of Anout riffe,
and so forth toward Lesou. But when you come with a northeast wind out of the
Sound, or from Col, you must run out close by Coll, if you will sail a
weather of the riffe of Anout.

He that must lie by or turn to windwardes betwixt Lesou and Anout, and is
bound for the Sound, let him keep himself on the west side of the farewaie,
when he is a league or two a weather of Lesou, upon those foresaid flattes, or
four, six, and seven fathom, when as that he begins to come within a
league or two of Anout, there it will be again deeper, but uneven the one cast
at least a fathom more or less then the other, when that you shall begin to
get that uneven ground of sixteen, twenty, and also thirty fathom, then is
Anout yet about three leagues south from you; coming near Anout it will be
very uneven, at one time thirty, and then soon again fifteen, seventeene,
and also twenty fathom.

If you will sail toward Lesou with a southwest wind, coming about the
Riffe of Anout from the southwardes, then go not on more westerly then
northwest. If you go on more westerly, either westnorthwest, or northwest and
by west, then you shall come soon upon the flat betwixt Anout and Lesou, and
shall find first ten, and then by little and little six, five and four
fathom. When that with the northwest way you begin to get Lesou in sight,
then it lies high, that is, the west end about westnorthwest, and the
northeast end, where the riffe lies off, about northnorthwest from you. When
you come so near to Lesou, that you can see the east end out of the top in
clear weather, about northwest from you, Depths by Lesou.
there it is thirty, and four and thirty fathom deep, that lasts so long
until that the foresaid east point be southwest from you, but when that point
is southsouthwest from you, then you are right thwart or upon the point or
shoalest, of the riff, then you shall run over there in three, four, and five
fathom: when that foresaid point comes to be south and by west from you then
you are past and clear of the riffe.

Betwixt Anout and Waesbergen in the farewaye it is deep one and twenty, two
and twenty, Depths thwart of Anout.
and three and twenty fathom, betwixt them lies also a banck of ten twelve,
fourteen and sixteen fathom. When the northermost high hill of Waesbergen is
northeast from you, then the points of Anouts riffes are southwest from you:
but when that hill is northeast and by east from you, and that you be somewhat
nearer Norwaye then the riffe, then you are upon that bank. When you come upon
it by night, then go on south, or south and by east, according as the wind
shall be, and then you shall get again deeper water. There lies yet another
banck betwixt the riffe of Anout and Valckenburgh, which lies along unto
Haland, which at some places is not deeper then eight fathom. When the point of
the riffe is about south and by east, and the high land of Anout is about south
and by west from you four leagues, there lies also a banck of 14 or 15 fathom.

The riffe of Anout Riffe off Anout.
lies off from the northeast point of Anout about eastnortheast a league and
half into sea, and at the end lies dry above water, which is exceeding steep
and needle too. The north side (when you come from the northwardes or the
westwardes) you may sound, and run along by it, in seventeene or eighteen
fathom: but coming from the southwards, you cannot (in no wise) come near it
by your lead, for on the south side close to the Riff, it is thirty, and five
and thirty fathom deep.

On the north side of the riffe, you may anchor at many places in ten, eleven,
twelve, and thirteen fathom. When you anchor in eleven, twelve or thirteen
fathom, so that the firebeacon be southeast and by south, and the high land of
Anout, Road under Anout riffe.
which is the west end, about southwest and by west from you, then lies the
outermost end of the riffe east and by north from you, there is very good
lying for eastsoutheast, southeast, south, and southsouthwest winds. When you
set sail from thence, and are bound to the Sound, then you may boldly without
fear (either by night or dark weather) sail along by the riffe in sixteen,
seventeen, or eighteen fathom, until thwart of the end, keeping in such depth
you can take no hurt of it. Coming by the end, it is four and twenty and five
and twenty fathom deep, but when you come about the point, and begin to go
on southsoutheast, then you have presently close to the riffe no ground in
thirty and five and thirty fathom. The riffe of Anout and Col lie one from the
other southeast and northwest about ten leagues asunder. In clear weather you
may easily see from below both Coll and Anout, when you are betwixt them both.
Depths betwixt Anout riff and the Sound.
For to sail from the riffe to the Sound with a westsouthwest wind, you need
not sail nearer with a ship that sayleth well, then southsoutheast, with that
course you shall sail far enough a weather of Col. Coming near the Coast of
Zealand, that you may sound in fourteen, twelve, ten and eight fathom deep.

Betwixt Anout and Zealand, in the farewaye it is eightteene and twenty fathom
deep. Betwixt Anout and Zealand fifteen and sixteen fathom, but in the farewaye
betwixt Anout and Coll, it is deep twenty, one and twenty, two and twenty, and
three and twenty fathom. To the southwards of the westwardes of it, it is
shoaler, to wit, nineteen, eighteen, and also well fourteen, thirteen, and
twelve fathom, according as you come to the westwards, but toward Norwaye it
is deeper, to wit, four and twenty, five and twenty, eight and twenty, and
also thirty fathom, whereby you may perceive whether you be nearest the Norway
side to the eastward of the fareway or to the westward.

About northwest from Coll four leagues, and southeast and by east from Anout,
there lies a banck of nine, ten and twelve fathom.

Diversbancks.
About east and by south from Anout, so far that you cannot well see it from
beneath, but may see it out of the top and northwest from Coll there lies also
a banck of sixteen fathom, gross sandy ground, as if it where ground of the
riffe.

South and by east about eight leagues from the point of Arnouts riffe,
southeast and by south from the south end of Anout, and west and by north from
Coll about five leagues, lie the Lowsegroundes, Louseground.
upon which is no more then eight foot water. He that comes off from Anout
riffe, being bound for the Sound, and goes not more southerly then
southsoutheast, shall not sail within these grounds, but with a south and by
east course he should fall with them. He that comes out of the Sound, being
bound toward Anout, should (with a westnorthwest course off from the Sound)
also sail within the same, therefore he that is bound with a bare wind from
Anout to the Sound, or from the Sound to Anout, must be careful thereof.

The Island Haselin Haselin.
lies from Anouts riffe south 11 leagues distant, and from Coll southwest and
by west eight leagues, which is on the north side, or outer side very full off
riffes and shoales, but on the south side or inner side toward Zealand it is
indifferent clean, so that you may well have road there. From the east end of
Haselin lies off a Riffe northnortheast and northeast and by north toward
Norwaye three leagues into sea, until within a league near to the
Lowsegrounds: he that must turn to windewardes here, with southerly or
northerly winds, and runs somewhat far over westwardes into the bay, must
be very careful, and take heed there of, because it is there abouts very
uneven of depths, and uneven grounds, and therefore you cannot well come near
then by your lead; but the Coast of Zealand you may come near in 6 or 7 fathom
by your lead.

If it should happen that you must lie by, Depths in the Scawe reach.
in the Scawe reach in long dark nights or mistie weather, then observe these
directions following: If you be betwixt the Scawe and Lesou, then you may keep
your self well bouldly to the southwards or westwards, but use the lead much:
about the Helmes and the Scawe you may come near the shore into ten, twelve
or fiftteene fathom, before you need to east about. If you be by your reckoning
thwart of Lesou, you may come near it in ten or fifteen fathom: But if you be
betwixt Lesou and Anout, there you may run upon the flats in five, six,
seven, eight or ten fathom. If you be betwixt Anout Haselin and Coll, there
you may run to the south shore in fifteen and sixteen fathom, but betwixt
Haselin and Zealand in ten or twelve fathom.

It is best in any wise to keep you rather to the south shore, then to the
Norwaye side, but you must be very careful of your lead, and use it very much.

From Coll to the Island Haselin, Haselin.
it is southwest and by west eight leagues, you may sail through betwixt
Haselin and Zealand, until you come into the Belt: the coast of Zealand is a
fair strand, but between Fishers village and the Castle Kronenburgh, lies a
bank a little half league from the shore of two fathom, and runs with a
riffe to the shore and is four fathom water, as also, to the westwards of
Haselin, there shoots off a riffe to seawards, which you must avoid.

About eastsoutheast from Haselin goes into the Land a great broad sound,
which without at the entrance of it, is a great league broad, there is good
anchoring for a northwest wind in five or six fathom. The Sound divides it
self within the land into three parts, the first or the eastermost, called
Roskildifiourd, Roskildifiourt
goes up southsoutheast unto Rockil, the second, called Isenvoort, Isenvoort
lies into the land south, and south and by west at least 5 or 6 leagues, unto
Isickby and Holbeck: within it is at least two leagues broad, and in the
midst lies a great Island. The third lies to Draecksholme, also at least
five leagues southwest, and northeast, like the coast toward the Belt. The
Coast of Zealand, betwixt Haselin and the Sound is a clean coast, you may sail
along by the Land in six or seven fathom, besides the foresaid riff which
lies between Fishers village there is upon it but four fathom deep, but come
no nearer to it by night then twelve or thirteen fathom, for at some places it
is steep, and shoaleth up suddenly. Where that little new church stands,
thwart of it, it is flat three and four fathom, and to the westwards of that
wood which stands to the westwards of Lapsand, you may come in four fathom
by the shore, without taking hurt, but coming near Lapsand, you must keep
further off from the shore, in seven or eight fathom, or else you should get
behind the point of Lappesand.

Lappesand Lappesand.
lies about an English mile to the northwards of Elsenoore, or the Castle of
the Sound, lying on the west side of the sail way, along the coast of
Zealand. For to avoid Lappesand you must be careful of these marks, there
stands a house to the westwards of the Kings mill, to the westwardes of the
Castle of Cronenburgh, keep the Chimney of that house to the westwards of the
front of the Kings mill, and then you can take no hurt of Lappesand, then run
along by it in six, seven or eight fathom, so long until that the east end
of the Island Ween comes a little without the castle of the Sound, keep that
so standing, and sail so in six or seven fathom, somewhat close along by
the castle, you may plainly see lying through the water all that can hurt you.

For to anchor behind Lappesand.
If you will shift roads out of the Sound, and anchor behind Lappesand, then
sail thwart of the foresaid Kings house called the Caux or Kings mill, so that
it do stand about south or south and by west, or south and by east from you,
anchor there in six, seven or eight fathom, there it is good lying out of the
current and sand ground but if you will anchor in twelve, thirteen or fourteen
fathom, there it is soft ground, and there goes a strong current with
southerly or southeast winds, but you lie there better, in more room, for to
sail inwardes again if it should happen that the wind did suddenly shift out
to the northwest. It happened once to one of may acquaintance, that had
anchored somewhat to the eastwards of the Kings-mill, in six or seven fathom
and the wind did shift in the night to the northwest, when they weighed their
anchor the ship fell toward the land, and before they could get the ship
about before the wind, they did run in three fathom over the point of
Lappesand.

From Coll to Elsenure or the Sound, the course is southeast, and southeast and
by south four or five leagues. About half ways betwixt Coll and Elsenburgh
lie the Swyneboden, Swineboden.
which are some foul rocks, and suncken rocks, which lie off to seawards a
good ways from the land, but when you sail toward the Sound coming from
Col, then keep the Island Ween hidden behind the Castle Cronenburch, and then
you cannot sail foul of the foresaid Swyneboden, when that you are past them,
then run in amidst the channel, for to avoyde Lappesand, or else if you bring
the east end of Ween, then again right without the castle, or keep in seven or
eight fathom from the Sealands side, you can not take hurt of Lappesand, For to
avoid Lapposand.
when you are come within the castle, you may anchor where you please. The
ships do commonly anchor all along by the land until to the southwards of
Elsenure, there it is fifteen and sixteen fathom deep, but with a southeast
wind it is bad lying there.

Toward the Island Ween lies a banck of eight or nine fathom, it is better
lying there, but it is somewhat far from the land.

For to sail out of the Sound.
When you will sail out of the Sound toward Coll, and are come to the end of
Lappesand, then go northwest and by west for to avoid the Swyneboden, until
that Coll be northnortheast from you, then go boldly northwest and by north,
or northnorthwest, according as the wind shall be, for with a northeast wind,
you must run out northnorthwest very close along by Col, for to sail a
weather of the Riffes of Anout and Lesou.

For to sail to Elleboge or Malmuyen, and Landscroone.
If you will sail out of the Sound to Elleboge or Malmuyen, go from Ween
southeast and southeast and by south, and then you shall see the steeple or the
town lying before you, sail toward it, in that farewaye, it is most seven or
eight fathom deep: when you come within the south Holmes, it will be five or
six fathom deep, it does shoale up suddenly, from the seven fathom to five, but
before the town it is shoaler water, you may anchor there in three, four or
five fathom if you will, you may lie also at the end of the Head, in three
fathom, there it is good lying, but with a northwest wind it is a bad road,
for it blows there open in.

If you will run out again to the southwards of the south Holmes toward
Fasterborne or Steden, you must take heed of the south Holmes, which are foul
round about. From the north end shoots off a riffe a great ways: Upon the
east side, at the south end, it lies very far off shoale, there lies also
the Northvliet, Northvliet.
that is a ledge of rocks under water, but you may perceive it through the
water, you shall leave it on the south Holmes side, to wit, on the starboard
side of you: but the Southvliet, Southvliet.
which lies thwart of Old Fasterborne, you shall leave on the larboard side,
and so run through betwixt them, it is in that farewaye at the shoalest four
fathom deep. When you come off from Malmuyen, and that the steeple of
Coppenhaven come to the south end of the South Holmes, then you are past the
Northvliet. When you sail thus there through, you must be very careful to
avoid these foresaid grounds. You may run out also along by the strand of
Schoonen, and leave both the Northvliet lying on the starboard side: you may
sound that strand in four and five fathom, as also the riffe of Fasterborne.

He that will sail into Lands-croone, Lands-croone.
must know that there lies a shoale before the havens mouth, and must run in
about to the southwardes of it: there stands a little church on the north
side, by the water side and a Gentleman's house somewhat farther within the
land, bring that church over the house, and then you are clear of the shoale,
then sail in right with the point, and anchor in three fathom.

To the northwards of old Fasterborne goes in a deep, called Hull or
Hulwater, Hulwater
it is a deep haven for ordinary ships, which goes in most northeast in
three or four fathom; you may sound it in along by the footstrand of old
Fasterborne in three fathom, leaving old Fasterborne on the starboard side, it
is there large and broad enough.

How men shall sail out of the Sound, through the shoales or grounds, and into
the Reefshol.
He that will sail out of the Sound toward the shoales or Grounds, let him
go on south and by east, or he may Sound along by the wood, in five or six
fathom, and then he shall not sail a miss of the norther buy, Norther buy.
for it lies in five or six fathom, on the north end of the Middle ground, to
the eastwardes of the buy, it is seven fathom deep, but in the right farewaye
thwart of this buy, it is nine or ten fathom deep: the marks of this buy
are, when that end of the wood is westsouthwest from you, then you are thwart
of the norther buy, and there stands then a flat steeple, a pretty ways to
the southwards of that wood: there comes also three hommocks to the north
side of the town, these are all marks of the norther buy.

From the Norther buy to the Middle buy, the course is south and by east. When
you come by the Middle buy, then comes the southermost mill on to the
southwardes of the town of Coppenhaven, and the flat steeple comes within a
handspikes length unto the sharp steeple, that are the marks of the Middle
buy, or second buy in the shoales or grounds, it is here eight and nine
fathom deep.

From the Middle buy to the third, Third buy.
and forth to the buy upon Casper Caniell, the course is south and by east.
When the white castle comes over the sharp steeple, they are the marks of
the fourth buy, or the buy upon the Casper Caniell, the third lies at the
south end of the Middleground, it is not there very broad, but steep on both
sides, the deep thereaboutes is seven or eight fathom: If you must turn to
windewards there, you must cast about, so soon as it does begin to shoale, as
well on the one side as on the other.

Buy upon Casper Caniel. Fisher.
The fourth buy lies on the north end of Draecker upon the flat, over against
it lies a rock above water, called the Fisher, east and by north from the buy
there you may well sound the south holme, for it is there shoale water. Betwixt
the third and this sourth buy comes running out a channel from Copenhaven,
which men do call Casper Caniell, or the Kingsdeep.

From the fourth buy or Casper Caniell, to Draker riffe, the course is south,
and south and by east: the land of Draecker you may sound in three, four, and
four fathom and a half.

The Riffe of Draecker Riff of Draker.
lies a good ways without Draker, it lies off a half league east into sea.
The marks of the buy upon Draker-riffe are these. When the steeple of
Copenhaven comes to the southwards of Draker to the wood, then you are thwart
of the buy. The shoalest water that you shall find betwixt this buy upon
Draecker riffe, and the foresaid fourth buy, is five fathom less two foot.
For to sail by night through the shoales or grounds, go from the Island Ween
south and south and by west, so long until that you come thwart of the point
of the wood in four fathom, then keep somewhat off from the shore, and go on
southeast and by east, until that you come in seven fathom, and then forth
southsoutheast, until you be over the Middle ground, the first or northermost
buy, as is beforesayd, lies in five fathom, but you may well go over to the
westwards of it, in three or four fathom, keep then somewhat off, until that
you come in eight, nine, or ten and eleven fathom, and sail then on south unto
Casper Caniell, there it will be by little and little shoaler, to wit, about 8
fathom. Thwart of Draker it is uneven for to sound, the one cast five and the
other four fathom, but go your course, except you knew that you where nearer
the one shore of Draker, or the south holmes, then the other. Without Draker
it will be again 6 and 7 fathom deep. Full southeast from Draecker, about a
good half league lies a stone, three foot under water, and is about 2 rods
length from the great where Cornelis Iansz Buysman, from the streeck in
September 1628 run upon with his shipp.

For to sail into Rifsholl or Copenhaven, coming from the northwards out of
the sound; run along somewhat to the westwards of the Norther buy, for to
avoid the plate, or Middle ground, which lies to the westwardes of the buys
in the shoals, which upon the north end is not deeper then twelve foot, and on
the south end eight, nine, and at some places ten foot deep, all hard stony and
rocky ground, keep the sounding of the shore on the west side in two, three,
or four fathom, so deep as you please, until you come before Copenhaven, on
that side you can take no hurt, it is there broad and wide, and lies in south
and by west; in the midst betwixt the shore and the Middle-ground, it is 5,
6, and 7 fathom deep. If you should turn to windwardes there, then come not
nearer the middleground then in four fathom, but the west shore you may run
to by your lead, as you please.

From the north end of the Island Draecker, runs off a riffe to the
northwards, upon the point of that riffe lies a buy, which men do call the
buy in the Reefsholl, Buy in- the Reefs hol.
leave that on the larboard side, and run in, until you come before the town,
and anchor there. If you come from the southwards, and will sail unto
Reefsholl, then run along to the eastwards of the foresaid fourth buy (which
men do call the buy upon Casper Caniel) then luffe up presently about by it,
and go on northwest into the Kings-deep, unto the buy in Reefsholl, which lie
one from the other due northwest, and southeast: you shall then also see right
out a head, in the northwest within the land a flat steeple right over a great
house or Hospital, that stands close upon the seaside, keep them so one in
the other, and sail right in with them, and so you shall run in right amidst
the channel, it is there in the farewaye five, six, seven, and eight fathom
deep. This Kingsdeepe is somewhat uneven of ground, therefore be careful in
using of the lead, and come not too near the north side; that is the
Middle-ground, which is very foul and rocky: from the south shore (about
half ways betwixt the two s resaid buys) it lies off somewhat shoale, of
that you shall have at one cast five or six, and the other but 3 fathom.

When you come by the buy in the Reefsholl, which lies upon the point of the
norther riffe of Draecker, leave that on the larboard side, and run on south
about by it, unto Copenhaven. Marks of the buy in the Reefshol.
The Marks of this buy are these: there lies a round hommock or great rock
about half a league within the land, when that is right east from you, then it
comes right with a flat steeple which stands about a league within the land,
then you are eventhwart of the buy, or point of the foresaid riffe. These
marks will serve at times when the buy lies not there. A little to the
northwards of that buy lie the great ships which tarry for wind in five or six
fathom, there is good anchor ground.

From the buy upon Draker-riff unto Kuyck, Kuyck.
the course is southwest five great leagues, but unto the riff of Fasterborn,
or Steden, it is south and south and by west 5 leagues, in the fareway betwixt
Draecker and Fasterborn it is six, seven, and eight fathom deep, but between
Fasterborn and Steden, 10, or 12, and 13 fathom, but by Steden deepest.

Under Steden you may anchor as well to the southwards of it, for northerly,
Road under Steden
as to the northwards for southerly winds. If you will anchor for northerly
winds, then run in betwixt Steden and Meun, a good ways into the bay, so that
the steep point of Steden lie about northnortheast from you, anchor there in 8
or 9 fathom, and you shall lie land-lockt for north and northwest winds.

But if you will anchor for south or southwest winds, then anchor to the
northwardes of Steden, so that the southeast point be south and by east, or
southsoutheast, and the northwest point northwest or westnorthwest from you,
there it is good lying in seven fathom, the ground is there small white and
blanck sand. If you will set sail from thence to the shoales or grounds, then
go not more northerly then northeast, so long until that you come by the riffe
of Draker, then run about by it in five fathom.

To the northwards of Steden the coast of Zealand goes in with a great bay
into Kuyck, it is there all to the westwards shoale water in five, six and
seven fathom, and good anchor ground, so that you may anchor every where there
abouts.

The riffe of Fasterborne lies off southwest to Seawards a league and a half.
Marks of the riffe of Fasterborne.
It is a foul stony and rocky riffe, upon the end of it lies a buy in four
fathom. You may run about by it upon your lead in five fathom with small ships
of little draughts. Men do hold for a marck of this riffe that when the
steeple of Fasterborn and the castle come one in the other, that then they are
thwart of the point of the riffe. He that comes from the northwards, and will
sail about Fasterborne with a northerly or northeast wind, and that he will
come somewhat near about the riffe, and comes in five or six fathom, he
must be very quick in using the lead. When old Falsterborne Church comes
half ways to the Castle and the Church of Fasterborne, then begins to come
the worst and shoalest of the riff, that lasts until that Old Fasterborn
church comes to the eastwards of the houses of Fasterborne, before that you
are not past the riffe. If you should luffe up sooner about by it, you should
run in great danger with a ship of great draught, you shall have (coming
against the riffe) the one cast 4 or 5, and then presently three fathom upon
it, all hard stony ground. Therefore it is best with a ship that draws twelve
or fourteen foot, to come no near this riffe then in six or seven fathom.

If (when you come from the eastwards) you will sail about Fasterborne, and
come along the shore with a northeast wind in six or seven fathom, and
Falsterborne is about north, or northnortheast from you, then it shoaleth up
very fast in two fathom, or two fathom and a half. Therefore keep you further
off from the shore in ten or twelve fathom, so long until that the Castle
be northeast, or northeast and by north from you or that old Falsterborne
church come half way to the castle of Falsterborn and Falsterborn church, then
you cannot sail upon the riff from the eastwards, but running about by it in
five fathom, then you must be very careful in using your lead. But if you will
come near the riff in four or five fathom, when old Falster-born Church
comes to thee. end of Falsterborn, you shall run in great danger for to come
on ground. When you come within the Riffe, you may run along by the coast of
Schoonen in four fathom without taking hurt.

He that comes out of the Sound, and is bound to the southwards of Meun, may
come so near Meun as he will, and loose up to the westwards by the point, and
anchor where he please, in five or six fathom. On the north side of Meun you
may also anchor in six fathom, behind a little riffe that shoots off from
the north point, for an east, southsouthwest and west wind, it is there all
over flatt, and good ground.

From Meun to Steden, the course is northwest and by north four leagues,
betwixt them both goes in the Wolf-sound, or Wolvegat, that runs past
Werdenborgh and Nest-veld through the Golversound out into the Belt.

Meun and Fasterborne lie north and by east, and south and by west five leagues
asunder.

Of the Tides and Course of the streams.
In the Scawe reach, betwixt Maelstrand and Waersbergen the stream goes most
still with the wind and it rippleth there sometimes in some places, as if
there were shoals, this you may find in calm weather, if you let a lead sink
to the ground.

By the Scawe the Stream comes most commonly falling out at the Belt
toward the land of Northeast, especially when the wind has blown a while
out of the east or no theast, and runs along by the Norwaye to the
northwardes.

Men coming off from Anout, that will sail by night with a westerly wind,
toward the Scawe: or coming from the westwardes about the Scaw, with a
southerly wind, being bound for the Sound, might soon be carried with this
current under Norway, a good while before they should think or fear of it. Of
this current read further in the first book.

In this farewaye betwixt the Scawe and the Sound, and then from the Sound
until about Fasterborne, it is exceeding necessary that a Pilot (or he to
whom the charge is committed) be very careful in looking out, and be very
vigilant, that he may avoid the multitude of dangers, of shoales and riffes
lying there: the skilfullest and best experienced of all has there enough to
do.

Through the Sound and the shoales or grounds, the stream runs commonly
with the wind, but the most part of the time to the northwards, before the
coming of a hard east wind, or when it has blown out of the east, then the
stream runs still out the northwards.

From the Island of Akersound, Akersound.
to the Sister the course is west and by north 4 leagues, betwixt them lies
the Graswijcke, Graswicke
within the Sisters, lying from Farther east northeast about 7 leagues. When you
will sail in there, you must leave the sharp point on the larboard side,
within lies a round rock, which you may sail about on both sides, thwart of it
is good anchor ground. North from this rock lies a great Bay, fit for ships to
lie in, that tarry for a wind, within lies also a round rock. Men do run in
along by the west land, which lies in first north, and about the Island
northnortheast, they leave the Island on starboard side, and run in
northnorthwest by the west land. To the eastwards of Graswijcke, also betwixt
the Sisters and Akersound lies Shiphill, that is a Haven where men lade Spars
and fat wares.

From the Sisters The Sister.
unto Bast the course is northwest and by west five leagues. Behind the Sisters
to the southwards of the point of Roge, lies the haven of Elffang, 5 leagues.
When you come off from Farther, you go must distant from the Island Farther
northeast and by east five leagues. When you come off from Farther, you must run
through within the rocks, which lie within the Sisters, until you come against
the land, there you shall find a great gray rock, which you must leave on the
larboard side, and the small rocks that lie there within on the starboard side,
and then along about by the westland, and then the haven opens it self, which
is narrow, and within flatt and soft ground.

When you sail from Farther or Bast unto Soen-water, you shall meet with a red
point, betwixt the Soen-water and the Copperwycke. He that is bound into
Soen-water must run along to the eastwards of it, but he that is bound into
Copperwycke must go up along to the westwards of it and leave it on the
starboard side. When that you come within the Lams, you shall epsy a little
Church upon the west-land, there is the lade place of the Copperwycke,
Copperwijcke.
you may sail up from thence to Brakenes. On the north or east side lies
Holmsound, from Farther to the point of Roge the course is northnortheast five
leagues. At the east end of Roge you may anchor, there is a plain strand, you
may run through betwixt the Roge Roge.
and the Calf, but anchor under Fletto, then you must run through within the
two small rocks.

From the Island Farther to the Soen-water, Soen-water.
the course is north, somewhat easterly but from Bast north and by east. The
Soen-water lies in most north. Upon it lie many havens and lade places, most
on the starboard side as you come in. First there is Mos-sound, a Haven that
goes up to the eastwards, and then there is Wykestee, Wykestee
which is a bight behind an Island, afterward Shiphill, Ship-hill.
a sandbay and a very good road, that goes so up along to the northwards
into Anslo, and then it runs about to the southwards into the Bottom.

From the Island Farther Farther.
to Laerwyck the course is westsouthwest four leagues, betwixt them both lies
the little town Tonsbergen in a great Bight. And from Farther to the Island

Bight of Asko, but to the northwards of Bast lies Lowsound.

The Laerwyck Laerwyck
is a great broad Sound, where are many Bights and Lade-places, where men may
lie and lade Firretimber. From the east point lies off a great rane of rocks a
good ways often southeast and by east into sea, and run in almost half the
Sound, called the Larwykes Swines, where of men must take heed. Within in this
Sound it is flat water and shoale, so that far within no great ships can lie
a float.

A league to the eastwards of the Nesse, or east point of the Longsound,
Stavange.
lies Stavange, they are ome outrockes, where men may sail within on both
sides to the eastwards of it lies the Sound of Laerwyck.

For to sail into the Nesse, The Nesse
that is on the north side behind the eastermost point of Longsound (you must
run through betwixt the great rock, whereupon the Warder stands, and the land
of old Longsound, leaving the foresaid rocks on the starboard side, and so
along about that rough Island, until you come into the Nesse, which lies
behind a chindle strand, there you shall lie under a chindle of rocks like
red sand: There lie also some little rocks thwart of that chindle. This is a
good handsome haven, and light for to come into, there it is four and twenty
and five and twenty fathom deep.

The Longsound is one of the fairest havens of all Norway, and lies
northnortheast from Jofferland distant one great league. Before old Longsound
lies a high round rock whereupon stands a great round Warder, Coninxhaven.
for knowledge of this haven. Coninxhaven that is the southermost or westermost
channel of the Longsound, and goes in betwixt the westermost through point
and Conings Island, and then men run along to the eastwards of the Baers,
which lies off from the foresaid rough point. For to sail in there, you must
run in amid channel, and anchor in the Coningshaven in eight and twenty and
thirty fathom.

For to sail through within Iofferland from Westkiell, the Sound lies through
the channel first northeast and northeast and by north, and then
eastnortheast, and afterward again northeast, and then you come to a place
where the sound is somewhat broader, there lies a suncken rock, which you must
leave on the starboard side, and edge to the north shore. Being past that, you
shall come again in a very narrow sound, which lies through most northeast,
and is at some places so narrow, that the yard arms do almost touch the
rocks. Being through that narrow place, you must go northeast and by east,
and eastnortheast, until you come thwart of the Longsound, then you may sail
in there northnorthwest, Road Behind Iofferland.
or sail into the sea as you will: Behind Jofferland you may also anchor in
fifteen or twenty fathom.

From the Baers unto the northermost rocks of Jofferland, that is the
southermost or westermost point of Longsound, the course is southsouthwest a
great league. going southsouthwest from with out the Baers The Baers
then you shall find a third part of water to Jufferland or shoale which you
see quite under water about seven foot. Betwixt them both lie two havens,
Eastkiell and Abbefoord, men sail in there to the eastwards of the outrocks of
Jofferland. From these foresaid northermost out-rocks of Jofferland unto
Eastkiell, it is northwest about a league, but to Abbefoort northnorthwest and
north and by west also a league. Men may (coming from the southwards, or from
Westkiell Westkiel.
) sail through within Jofferland, into Eastkiell, or Abbefoort.

When you come before Westkiel, you may see within the land three high hills,
and also the high land of Long-sound, lying northwards from you, that land is
altogether very easy to be known, he that sees it once, and takes regard of
it, shall know it very well another time, when he comes thereabouts.

A league to the eastwards of Sandvoort lies the haven of Westkiell, a little
to the eastwards of it lies Jofferland. For to sail into Westkiel, Iofferland
you must leave all the great rocks (which lie off from Jofferland on the
starboard side,) and all the foresaid little rocks of Sandvoort, and also a
white holme whereupon a mast stands on the larboard side, and run in first
northwest and afterward northnorthwest and at last north, until you come
about the west point, and then you must edge up northwest to the north side of
the Islands, which ly within the haven, there is a Vosse, or an Overfall of
water, there you may anchor in twenty or five and twenty fathom.

Thwart of Sandvoort lies a banck at sea, which at some places is not deeper
then three or four fathom, and lies along to the eastwards until thwart of
Westkiell.

A great league to the eastwards of Sandvoort lies Longen. For to sail in
there you must leave all the little rocks on the starboard side, and run so
along by the land until you come within the Long-holms which remain on the
larboard side, and then right into the Bight. This is a fair haven, men come
into it from the eastwards.

When you are before Oxefordt and Longen, Marks of Oxeford. and Longe^.
Longhen.
then the Drommels lie about westnorthwest from you.

A league to the eastwards of Oxeford lies Longen before it lies a little
round Island or rock on the east side of the haven, upon which stands a mast
with a barrel upon a Warder. For to sail in there, you must run in close by
that land where the Warder with the barrel stands upon, close along by the
Warder, but there stands a hand on the starboard side of the havens mouth,
which poynteth that there lies thwart of it a suncken rock under water, there
you must edge somewhat off from the shore. Being within there, you may run to
the eastwards again into sea, and come out in the Sound of Sand-voordt.

About a league to the eastwards of Trom-sound lies the haven of Oxeford,
Oxeford.
which is a great broad, and large Sound, lying in first without betwixt the
rock, north. Without in the coming into the westwards of the havens mouth,
lies a long rock, which you must leave on the larboard side, and somewhat past
that long rock lies a suncken rock, which you must leave on the starboard side
and run in still north unto the west point of the land, thwart where of lies a
suncken rock which you must avoid, when that you come then within the west
point, you must sail in northwest and northwest and by north, and anchor on
the north side of the haven, there it is wide and broad, with many bights,
where you may anchor every where in twenty and five and twenty fathom.

About half a league to the eastwards of Maerdow stands a little white
Church upon the sea side, to the eastwards of it goes in the Trom-sound,
Trom-sound.
being a fair Sound. Without in the coming in, stand on the east or northside
two Warders upon a high hill, you must sail in by them, and thwart of them you
may also anchor, and from thence you may sail in further behind the Island
Trom, and the land of Maerdow, until you come into the Sound of Maerdow.

When the Drommels are northwest and northwest and by north from you, Marks of
Maerdow
then you are right thwart of Maerdow. If you run in so out of the sea, right
with the Drommels, you shall fall right with Maerdow, that is a certain mark to
know whether you be thwart of Maerdow, or to the eastwards or the westwards of
it, but when you are close before the land, or before the havens mouth, you
cannot see the Drommels, because they are then hidden of the cliffeland. To
anchor under the Island there is the shoalest water, but with a northwest or
northnorthwest wind, it is not so good to come from thence as out of the
haven, but with an easterly wind it is better to set sail from thence and to
get into sea.

The eastergat lies in westsouthwest there lies a suncken rock on the
starboard side, when you sail in, therefore you must run in close by the
Island. It is not deeper there in the gat or channel then three fathom, but
being come within it, you shall find it deeper, you may anchor there under the
Island in twelve or thirteen fathom, or you may run up to the westwards into
the Sound, as is beforesayd.

For to sail into Maerdow, through within the Mewholmes.
With a bare wind, or otherwise, you may sail also in, to this wester-gat of
Maerdow, to the westwards of Miewholmes, thus: To the westwards of the
southermost Miewholme, not far from it, lie two little rocks, even above
water, and a little further off from in two other rocks which are somewhat
greater, you must run in amidst the channel through betwixt them, leaving
the two smallest lying on the starboard side, and the two greatest on the
larboard side, that channel lies through most north and north and by east.
Being come to the end of the Miewholmes; you may sail up either toward the
northeast behind the Island Maerdow, or westwards into the Haven, as is
beforesayd. There goes sometimes a good tide out of this Haven, and the
westerly winds do blow commonly out of this channel betwixt the high lands
therefore he that will come in here with a westerly wind, must be very
careful, and keep up his top sails, or else he should lightly not be able to
get the haven, but drive out of it against his will.

Thwart of the west end of the Island Maerdow Maerdow
lies a suncken rock under water, whereof you must take heed, when you sail
in thus to the eastwards of the Mieuholmes. When you are come within the
foresaid west point or the Island Maerdow, you may run up toward the
northeast behind it, and anchor in 12 or 13 fathom, or sail up toward the
northnorthwest into the Sound, and anchor there on the west side in 16, 14, or
12 fathom, according as you sail far in. In the going into the Sound, or
haven, it is 34 fathom deep.

The Island Maerdow stands (upon the top of it) full of trees, and round
about it are all bare rocks. On each side of the Island goes in a channel.
The wester gatt or channel goes into the westwardes of the Island, and the
easter gatt to the eastwardes of it. For to sail into the wester gatt, you
must leave the Mewholmes (they are a fow rocks and Islands to the westwardes of
the Island of Maerdowe) on the larboard side, and the Island on the starboard
side, and run in so betwixt them both northwest and by north, but with a
southwest wind, you must sail in northwest. Upon the northermost Miewholme
stands a Warder.

To the eastwards of Hamer-sound, men do go into Kerck-sound, Kerck-sound.
and then a half league more to the eastwards lies the haven of Hesnes. Upon
the land of Hesnesse Hesnesse.
stand two Warders: thwart of them it is very steep, but toward the little
church it is shoaler, to wit, about thirty fathom: the out-rockes there-abouts
are all red of color.

On the west side of the havens mouth lies a suncken rock under water, called
the Koenagle, upon the land stand two little mastes, when they come one in the
other, then you are thwart of the Koenagle. The two foresaid little mastes,
stand upon a gray Holme, leave that on the starboard side, and go so still
inwardes, there it is high land, and the Drommels lie from thence
northnorthwest within the land, there you may sail through within the rocks,
until you come into Maerdow.

To the eastwards of old Hilsound lies Hamer-sound, Hamer-sound.
lying in northnortheast. On the west side of the Havens mouth lies a suncken
rock which you must avoid, and sail close along by the Island, which lies
on the east side of the havens mouth, and anchor behind the Island right
against the Warder, in thirty fathom. The easter-gatt lies to the eastwards of
that Island, in and out northwest, and southeast: upon the west side lies a
rock with a Warder.

To the eastwards of Wolf-sound lies old Hill-sound Old Hill-sound.
but betwixt them both, at the point of the west side of old Hill-sound lies
the Island of Blind-sound, to the eastwards of it lie many great rocks, with
two or three Warders upon them.

For to sail into the old Hill-sound, you must run along to the eastwards
of Blind-sound with the rocks that lie by it, in by the west land, leaving them
on the larboard side, and the foresaid great rocks or Holmes with the Warders
altogether on the starboard side, there are diverse fair sounds, where men may
sail into and anchor in, without taking hurt. You may edge up to the westwards
about the point, and sail through betwixt the Islands, that you can not see
the sea.

On the east side of Reperwyck lies Wolf-sound, Wolf-sound.
before it lie two great Islands, which show themselves in high gray Rocks,
with three or four Warders upon them, whereby you may know them.

Wolfsound is a narrow haven for to sail into, there stand two mastes upon the
west-land, where you must go in close by, leaving them on the larboard side,
and some little rocks on the starboard side, until that you come within the
great Island, whereupon the great Warders stand, there you may anchor, and lie
landlockt for all winds. From thence you may run forth through within the
rocks and come out again into the sea, by the old Hill-sound, or you may run
out also at the Eastergat of Wolf-sound, there stands a great Warder on the
west side of the gat, upon a round high rock, there you may sail out or in by
it where you will.

Reperwijck.
Three leagues to the eastwards of Fleckerie lies Reperwyck, a broad and wide
Sound, lying in north, and north and by west. For to sail in there you must
run in by the land of Wolf-sound (lying on the east side of this haven)
leaving all the rocks (and also where the mast of Wolf-sound do stand upon) on
the starboard side, and all the rocks of Ran-sound on the larboard side, until
that you come to the end, or within in the haven, and then you must edge up to
the westwards about the point, and anchor there, that is a good haven for ships
that are bound to the westwards.

About three leagues eastnortheast from Holysound and eight leagues to the
eastwardes of the Naze, lies the haven and Island Fleckerye, Fleckerie.
you may sail in at both sides of the Island, as well from the westwardes, as
from the eastwards into the haven of Fleckerie. The wester gat of Fleckerie.
The wester gat lies in northnortheast. When you come of from Holysound then
you see open into the Sound, you must sail along by the Rocks without
Holysound, until you come within the Island Fleckerye, and edge then westwards
toward the land, until you come within the Dieveholme, where the gallows
stands upon, and anchor by the west land, in fifteen, sixteen, or twenty
fathom: You must bring out there an anchor a head, and make a cable fast on the
rocks upon the land. You may run from thence to the eastwards of the Island
Fleckerie, out again at the Easter-gatt eastnortheast into sea, and then you
must leave the little Island within the Warders, which lies at the east end of
the Island Fleckerie, with all the great rocks by it on the starboard side,
and all the black holmes on the larboard side.

The Easter-gatt of Fleckerie goes in westnorthwest, betwixt the Island
Fleckerie and the point of Ransound. When you come before it, you may see open
in the Vosse. For to sail in there, you must leave all the black rocks thwart
of the point of Ransound on the starboard side, and the great graye rocks
with the little Island, where the Warders stand upon, on the larboard side,
when as you come then by the forenamed Dievenholme, you must run to the
westwards of it into the Sandbay, aod anchor there, as is beforesaid.

When you are thwart of the Easter-gatt of Fleckerie, then there lies right
thwart from you within the land a high round hill, which men do call the Boat
turned up side down, which lies out above all the lands thereabouts, and
coming from the westwards against Fleckerie, there show also three high
double lands, which by little and little seem to go to nothing toward the
Drommels.

Three leagues eastwards of Scheersont lies the Island called Holysound
Holysound.
whereupon stand two great Warders, you must sail in westwards that Island
along by Geve, which is a great high black cliffe which is the mark to know
the land by, you must leave them in your sailing in on your larboard side, till
you are within then you may anchor under the foresaid Island, thereabouts
runs a great bay in toward the land, where you may sail in, and where many
ships do lade.

A little to the eastwards of Sparrels lies a haven called Scarsound, or
Westrysen, for to sail in there, you must leave Sparrels to the westwards on
the larboard side, and all the great Holmes or rocks to the eastwards on the
starboard side, and run so inwards until you come into the haven.

From the Naze (that is the southermost point of Norwaye on the north sea)
westwards, the coast lies somewhat along by the land of Leest,
westnorthwest; but to the eastwards of it (along without the rocks, until
past the Island Fleckerie) eastnortheast about ten leagues. From thence along
northeast unto the Longsound about 16 leagues. This coast is all along full
of high steep stony hills and without it full of many rocks very strange
to behold, but it has many fair deep Havens, with very good anchor ground,
where in great abundance of timber and boards laden. The first Haven to the
eastwards of the Naze, The kloof Cow and Calfe.
is called the Kloof or the Cow and Calfe, after two high hommockes, easy to
be known, the one somewhat greater then the other, which lie within the Haven
upon the high land, and are so called by the Dutch Schippers. He that will
sail into this Haven coming from the westwardes, shall meet with a great
rock somewhat to the eastwardes of the Naze, called Melyn, where upon is a
Warder, being past that he shall find another outrock, where upon stands also
a Warder, called Sparrels. Betwixt these two outrockes, he must run into this
haven the Kloof. When he comes against Sparrels, there lies a suncken rock
under water, where of he must take heed. Somewhat within Sparrels lies an
other Rock in the farewaye, but above water, which he must leave on the
larboard side. In sailing in so, the haven does open it self, by little and
little, and so shall come against the Kloof: being come within it he must edge
up to the westwards, about the point, and anchor there in a sand baye, in
fifteen or sixteen fathom, so that the two foresaid hommocks the Cow and the
Calfe stand about northeast from him.

Of the streams on these Coasts.
Although the water on these Coasts of Norway does ebb and flow beyond Bergen
as far as Stadt nevertheless it keeps no certain tide, in sometimes of
the year and principally in the Spring time there goes such a strong stream
about west along Norway that a ship having a southwest storm shall not be
able to stem it, when it can bear sail. How nearer you come under the land of
Norway so much the stronger goes the stream. This stream falls out of the
Belt, on against the land from the northeast, and turns so along by the
Coast of Norway toward the north Sea. Read more largely of this in the
description of the Belt.

The sixth Demonstration, In which Are set forth the Coast of Norway, between
the Naze and Schuytenes.
A Little to the westwards of the point of the Naze lie two havens, New and Old
Silloe, or Silleu; some do call these one haven (like as also men may do) and
distinguish it into an easter and westergat or Haven, for men can go with
boats through within the rocks from the one into the other, but not with great
ships.

Silloe.
For to sail into the easter-gat, or New Siloe you must take heed of the
Bishops Boeden, which are a few out-rocks a little to westwards of the point of
the Naze, right before the midst of the Sound, leave them on the larboard
side, and sail in along by the land of the Naze until you come somewhat
within the foresaid Bishops Boede, and then you shall find there also a suncken
rock, which you must avoid, run about to the northwards of it and edge then up
to the westwardes behind the Island of New Silloe, and anchor there against
the white Church within the foresaid rock.

For to sail into the wester-gat, or Old Silloe, Old Silloe
you must run about to the westwards of the out-rocks, and Bishops-Boeden, and
sail right with the south end of the land of Leest; The Land of Leest.
being come by it, run to the eastwards along by it, but take heed of some
rocks, which lie off from the innermost Island on the starboard side, being
there within anchor against the Island, where you please.

From the Naze to the Island Hitteroe, Hitteroe.
or Hittereu, the coast lies along the land of Leest westnorthwest 5
leagues. To the southwards or the westwards of that Island men do sail into
the haven of Windfoord, Windfort
which lies in northeast, but to the northwards of it men do run into
Berg-sound, Berg-sound.
eastnortheast in betwixt the Island and the land.

In that Island is also a good haven, which you must sail into from the
northwards, the havens mouth is not very wide when you are come in within it,
you may edge up to the eastwards or southwards, and anchor there.

Two leagues to the northwardes of Hitteroe lies a haven called Soggendall,
Soggendall.
there lies a little Island before it, within men may anchor, it is a good
road for them which are bound to the southwards. Betwixt them both, not far
without the land, lie two out-rocks along the shore, called Fock-stones, the
one lies a little more to the seawards then the other.

A league to the northwards of Soggendall lies Ekesound, Ekesound
before it lies an Island, which you may sail into on both sides of it, the
southergat lies in northeast; being come in there you must anchor on the north
side of the haven in a bay, there is the best road in eight or nine fathom, the
norther gat lies into the eastwards; being come in there, you may anchor at
diverse places. Two leagues to the northwards of Ekesound lies a haven called
Sirowach. Sierowag.


For to sail in there, coming from the northwards; you must run in right with
the southermost sand bay until you come close by the shore, and then the
haven does open it self, loof up close along by the north shore, then run
up by it to the southwards, and avoid the west point, thwart of it lies a
suncken rock twelve foot under water; being there within, let your anchor fall
in seven or eight fathom, and bring a cable on the west shore, then you shall
lie land-lockt for all winds. This is a good haven for those which are bound
to the northwards.

To the northwards of Sierowach lies the land the Jedder, which lies from
Sierowach first northwest and by north two great leagues to point Walbert, or
Mids-Iedder, and the north four leagues, which is altogether a clean whole
coast, without any dangers or havens, except at the very north end, from which
runs off a little riffe northwest into sea, toward the Veetstone.

The Veetstone Veetstone
is a great rock; lying about two leag. without the land, lying northnorthwest
from Mids-Iedder five leagues, betwixt them both, a great league to the
southwards of the Veetstone, ly some low black rocks, called Rut. When as you
sail from Mids-Iedder on northnorthwest toward the Veetstone, then the
Veetstone does show himself very round, like a haycock, and sailing so, you
might lightly fall with the foresaid rocks of Rut, Rut.
but being a little more to seawards, the Veetstone shows it self a little
longer on the west side, then you cannot take hurt of the rocks of Rut.

About two leagues northnorthwest from the Veetstone lies an Island, whereupon
stands a Church called Whitings eye, Whitings-eye.
but northnortheast from the Veetstone 4 leagues, lies another Island before
the sound of Stavanger, called Sibrichstone. Sibrichstone.


If you will sail into Stavanger coming from the southwards, then sail
through betwixt the Veetstone and the maine land, leaving also the foresaid
rocks of Rut, lying on the starboard side, but you must take very good heed of
that little stone-riffe which lies off from the north end of the Iedder; sail
in so until that the Veetstone do lie southwest from you, then go in
northeast toward the point of Tongenes, which is a long point and low land on
the south side of the Sound.

When as you sail now from the Veetstone toward Tongenes, Tongene^
then you shall see that Island Sibrich stone before the Sound, which does show
it self in two parts, leave that on the larboard side, and sail in by the
point of Tongenes, but there lies a rock off to the northwards from the point:
sail through betwixt the rock and the point, Doeswyk
about east or eastsoutheast into Doeswycke; when you are within the castle of
Doeswycke, there you may anchor. But if you will sail in further before the
town of Stavanger, Stavanger
then leave the Diefholm on the starboard side, and sail in southeast and
southsoutheast before the town, and anchor there where you please.

But when as you come from the northwards, and will sail to Stavanger, then
run through betwixt the Veetstone and the Whitings-eye, and then go on
northeast toward Sibrichstone, and the point of Tongenes, and do further as
has been before taught.

From the Veetstone to Schuytenes, Schuytenes.
the course is northnorthwest five leagues: but from Schuytenes to Sibrichstone
through betwixt Whitings-eye, the course is east, five leagues.

Four leagues west and west and by north to seawards from Schuytenes lie the
rocks called the Outseers. Outseers.


Gaeltje Ians Steerman of Staveren coming from Schuytenes and being about
three or four leagues from it has cast upon eighteen fathom and about eighteen
leagues south and by west sailing, found 38 and 39 fathom and going yet 5
leagues further upon the same course found 24 and 25 fathom, and yet 9 leagues
further sailing south and by west and found 23 fathom water fine sandy ground
and afterward four and twenty and five and twenty.

Of the streams on these coasts.
On these Coasts of Norway off from the Naze, until past Berghen unto Stade,
the water rises and falls, but keeps no certain tide: but from thence
toward Dronten, and to the northwards of it, it keeps tide according to the
moon, like as in other places.

How these lands do lie one from the other and from other lands.
From the Naze to Hitteroe the course is westnorthwest 5 and 6 leagues. From
Hitteroe to Ekesond the course is northwest 4 leagues. From Ekesound to
Sierowach the course is northwest and by north 2 leagues. From Sierowach to
Mids-Iedder, northwest and by north two and a half league. From Mids-Iedder to
Rut northnorthwest 4 leagues. From Rut to the Veetstone north and by west a
league and a half. From the Veetstone to Sybrichstone, northnortheast 4
leagues. From the Veetstone to Schuytenes northnorthwest 5 leagues. From
Sybrichstone to Schuytenes through within Whitings eye west 5 leagues. From the
Naze to Outseers northwest 31 leagues.
Heights.
According to the Judgments of the Mapps the Corner of the Naze lies in 57
degrees 40 minutes. Schuytenes lies in 58 degrees 36 minutes.
How these lands do show themselves at sea.
Thus shows the land of the Jedder, when it is northeast five leagues from
you.
Thus shows the land of the Jedder, when it is eastnortheast 5 or 6 leagues
from you.


The seventh Demonstration, In which is set down How you may sail up into the
Liet of Bergen.
BEtwixt Schuytenesse and Bock goes in the Liet of Bergen. Schuytensse is
about four leagues long, at the south end lie some suncken rocks and foul
grounds; for to avoid them coming in out of the sea, you must keep the top of
Bock a little without the point of Schuytenesse, and then you shall go clear
of them; But if you bring Bock close by or to the point of Schuytenesse, and
sail so right in for to run about close by the point of Schuytenesse, you
shall surely sail upon those foresaid suncken Rocks and foul grounds.

From the south end of Schuytenesse, the Liet lies in first north and north
and by west two leagues to the great Warder, The great Warder.
which is a road so called after four great Warders, which stand there thwart
of it upon the land of Schuytenes, for the knowledge of this road: there lie
commonly the ships that tarry for a wind, being bound either to the northwards
or to the southwards, there it is very good lying in five, six, 7 or 8 fathom,
as well for northerly as southerly winds, you may also anchor to the northwards
of the Warders about a point in five, six, eight, ten and twelve fathom, there
you shall lie landlockt for southerly winds.

A little to the southwardes of the Warders lies a Bay, Coperwijke.
called the Coperwyke, within it is also a good haven for them which are bound
to the eastwards, and will set sail with a west wind: when a easterly or
northerly wind, you can not well shift roads from thence or come out. At the
coming in to this Baye lies a sunken rock, called the Coppernaile, Coppernaile.
upon it stands always a great Pole, where by you may see to avoid it.

Without at the south point of Schuytenes on the east side is also a little Bay
or two, where men may anchor.

A little to the northwardes of Bock, on the east side of the Liet is also a
Bay, called Bock-haven, Bock-Haven.
where men may come to anchor.

All these roads, as also the Coperwycke, are good for those which coming from
the southwardes, by reason of contrary winds can not get to the great Warders.

A little more southerly then the Coperwycke, on the east side of the Liet to
the northwardes of the Bock, lies in north into the land, a Sound, which
shows it self (when you come from the southwardes) much broader then the
right fareway, so that those that are not there very well acquainted, should
not think otherwise, but that it was the right channel, and so should lightly
go up a contrary way. Therefore it is necessary and needful to sail close
along by Schuytenes, and not go off from the west shore, until you come
thwart of Coperwycke, then you shall be within the point of the foresaid Sound.

Pascaerte van't Liedt van BERGEN, Beginnende van Schuitenes tot aen Bergen.


About a great half league by north the great Warder, lies Notou, Notou.
there stands a little white church and some houses, thwart of it in the Bay
is also good anchoringh for northerly winds, and good road for them which are
bound to the northwardes. Likewise se it is good anchoring by north the point
of Notou, for them which are bound to the southwards. Almost at the north end
of Schuytenesse, is also a road, called Sichstreame, where is also good lying.

Sichstream.
At the north end of Schuytenesse lies a little Island, when you sail up or
down the Lies, you can see through betwixt them into sea. At this Island is
alsoo a good road under a rock, or Island, called Wybrants-eye, Wybrants eye.
there it is good anchoring for all winds.

Betwixt that foresaid Island and the maine land, you must sail through a
narrow strait, which is but a little more then a ships length broad; on the
east side where of, which is on the side of the maine land, there lies a
little rock; or suncken rock, therefore you must sail close by the west side
that is close along by the Island for to avoid the foresaid rock.

From Wybrants-eye over the Bommel The bommell.
to the Blocx, the course is northnorthwest, but first somewhat more westerly,
about two leagues, betwixt them both it is on the west side a broken land,
great and little Islands and rocks. About half ways betwixt them both goes
a channel into sea, where men do sail much in and out, and it is clean,
broad, and wide. He that will runn out there (coming from the northwards) may
easily espy it, when he is a half league past the Blocx. On the west side lie
two little Islands or great rocks, which show much greater then the other
rocks, these you must leave on the larboard side, and run out by them
southsouthwest into the sea.

He that will run in here out of the sea, he shall (when he comes to the
end of Schuytenesse) see many little Islands or rocks, he must sail past al
these, until that he get sight of those foresaid two great rocks, and then in
by them leaving them on the starboard side; and so he shall come somewhat to the
southwardes of the Blocx The Blocx
or Longholme into the Lies.

The Blocx are 2 rocks, lying very near even with the water, which you must
leave on the larboard side, in sailing up, and run close along by the east
shore, through betwixt the Blocx and Longholm. Longholm.
Longholme lies a little above the Blocx, within it is a good Haven, where is
good lying. A little to the northwards of it lie 2 rocks more, thwart of them
lies a suncken rock, which you must avoid.

From the Blocx along over the Bommel it is yet two leagues, first north, and
then northnortheast, al along by the land of Bommelhead, the south end of
this land is a high steep point, called Bommel-head to the southwards of it
runs a channel westsouthwest into the sea called Bommell-sound.
Bommell-sound.
This channel is easy to be known, coming in out of the sea. The land of
Bommel-head is about 4 leagues long, and the first long Island to the
northwardes of Schuytenesse, it is altogether low plain land except on the
south end, which is so steep a point, as if it were hewn right off with an
Axe. About the midst between both ends of this Island (on the sea side) lies
a very high round hill, called Sick, Sick.
of fashion almost like a sugerloafe or a man's hat, and lies far above all that low land, which you may easily see at both the ends of this Island, and
also further, where by it is very easy to be known.

For to sail into this foresaid channel out of the sea, you must bring that
steep point of Bommell-head Bommell-head.
east northeast, or somewhat more northerly from you, and sail then toward
it. And then you shall leave a great many little Islands and rocks on the
starboard side, and the foresaid point on the larboard side, and close in about
by it to the northwardes.

A little about this point of Bommel-head, on the Innerside lies a Haven,
called Bommelhaven, there lies a rock before the mouth of it, and also a
suncken rock betwixt that rock and the north point of that Haven: He that will
go in there, must go into the southwards of the rock, in betwixt the south
point and the foresaid rock, leaving the rock on the starboard side of him. So
soon as men are within the Haven, they must let fall their anchor, within it
is broad and wide, and men lie there landlockt for all winds.

At the end of the Bommell lies Munsterhaven Munsterhaven.
in the land of Bommell-head, on the west side of the Lies, even about the
point. This is also a good haven for them which are bound to the southwardes,
and by reason of contrary winds cannot get further, there stands a little
white church thwart of it men must anchor in ten or twelve fathom.

From Munsterhaven to Beulhave it is north an English mile, there is also good
anchoring for southerly winds, Beulshaven.
further it is north, somewhat easterly to Volger-roade, Volger-road.
before it lies a little Island, under it, or by it on the one side or other
men may anchor for all winds. Men may also sail round about it, and run in and
out at both sides of it, if they will.

From Munster-haven to Bremer-holme the Liet lies north, somewhat easterly
about two leagues, Bremer holm
there the Liet is divided into 2 parts, to wit, into the Old and the New
Liet: The old Liet goes through to the eastwards of Bremer-holme and the
Island that lies to the northwards of it, but the new land along to the
westwards of it.

The Old Liet Old Liet.
is not well to be used by them, which are not there very well acquainted, also
great ships that draw twelve or thirteenfoot, may not go through there.

Somewhat more then thwart of the midst of Bremer-holme, in the narrow of the
Old Liet, lies a shoale where upon is no more then thirteen or fourteen
foot water. A little to the northwardes of it on the east shore lies a bay
called Ingesound, where is good anchoring: there lies also a bay on the west
side, half ways betwixt that foresaid shoale and Bremerholm, where men also
may anchor.

The New Liet New Liet
is broad and deep enough. Thwart of Bremer-holme, in the fareway, nearest the
west side lies a sunken rock, where of you must take heed. For to avoid it,
you must mark the Island before Volger road. If you keep it so that you may
see it without the north-poynt of Volgher-roade, then you cannot come too near
that suncken rock: but if you bring that Island behind the foresaid point, so
that you cannot see it, you shall without fail, sail right upon it; you must
observe these marks as well in sailing up as in sailing off.

In the midst of the New Lies lies Ruighe-holme, Ruighe-holme.
there men lie with ships fast unto two Rings: the one is upon the Island,
and the other upon the point to the northwards of it, where they bring out
Cables to.

From the New Lies to the point of Redholme, Redholm.
it is northnortheast a half league, betwixt them both goes out the
Soltmerfioerd westsouthwest into sea, which is a fair broad and large channel.
On the south side lie some suncken rocks, but if you run out amidst the
channel, you can take no hurt of them.

At sea men do know this Soltmerfioerd Soltmerfioerd.
by that foresaid high and round hill Siecke, which is very easy to be known,
and lies two leagues to the southwards of it, about half ways betwixt this
Sound and Bommel-sound. The land on the south side of Soltmerfioerd toward
Sick, are small white rocks, which you must leave on the starboard side, and
run in so amidst the channel eastnortheast, and then you can take no hurt of
those foresaid suncken rocks, lying on the south side of this channel. There
lies also a suncken rock at sea before this Sound on the south side a little
off from the north point of the land of Bommell-head, with hard winds out of
the sea, the sea breaks very much upon it, but it lies at least five or six
fathom under water.

When as you come in there, you have Redholm on the larboard side, and you must
run northeast along by it, until you come about the foresaid point.

From the point of Redholme to the Narrow it is north, and through the Narrow
northnorthwest and north and by west at least a half league. In this strait it
is so narrow, that you can but even turn through it on the west side of the
strayt lies a little Island, thwart of it is good anchor-ground in 13 and 14
fathom.

Reine Knaep.
From the strait to the Reine Knape, the course is northwest, and by north two
leagues: this is a little Island without trees, clean round about, which you
may sail about on both sides.

Thwart of Reine Knaep on the east shore lies Deepesound, a good haven for
them which are bound to the southwards, Deep sound.
the mouth of it is narrow, and also but three fathom deep, but within it is
broad and large, and twenty fathom deep. Along to the westwards of the Reine
Knaep, it is broadest, to the eastwards lies a point, and by it a little
Island you may sail through betwixt the point and the little Island. From the
Reine Knaep to Bagholme, the course is north and by east a great league:
Betwixt them both lie some Islands and rocks, all which you must leave lying on
the starboard side, there you may at diverse places sail through and within
these Islands and rocks, and at last come out again by Bagholme into the Liet,
but it is not to be done but for them that are there extraordinary well
acquainted. Men might lightly get in amongst these Islands and rocks, so that
they should not know how to come out again. At the east side of Bag-holm men
may anchor, but there shoots off a little ledge of rocks from the north end,
whereof they must take good heed.

Crabkerk.
From Bag-holme to Crab-kerke it is north about three quarters of a league, this
is an indifferent haven for southerly winds, but it is little, there can lie no
more then two or three ships.

From Crabbe-kercke to Bock up Ra, it is north, somewhat easterly a league,
betwixt them both runs out the Crosse-sound, or Cruysvoert westsouthwest,
and southwest and by west into sea, which sound is very easy to be known at
sea, by three hills (almost like the Drommels on the east side of Norway, but
not so high) which lie there abouts within the land, which are also called by
some the north Drommels, North-D^o^mels.
when they are northeast, or thereabouts from you, then you are open before the
Crosse-sound. Before the mouth of it lies a little Island nearest the south
side, from which lie off some rocks to seawardes, the broadest and largost
channel is along to the northwards of it you may well also sail through to
the eastwards of the Island betwixt it and the land, but there it is narrow,
yet clean and clear without any dangers. When you are within it, you must go
in along eastnortheast and northeast and by east, and so shall come into the
Liet against Cruysenes, a little to the southwards of Bock up Ra.

Bock up Ra ^ock up Ra.
is a little Island which you may sail about on both sides, along to the
westwards of it is the common fare-way, and also deepest. When as you sail
about to the eastwards of it, and come to the north end of Bock, there it is
very narrow, and there right in the fareway (somewhat nearer the east shore
then Bock) lies a suncken rock, there stands always a pole upon it, for to
avoid it, you must leave it on the starboard side, and run along to the
westwards of it. Betwixt this Rock and Bock, it is no deeper then sixteen foot.
Right to the westwards thwart of Bock lies an other Island, under it you may
also anchor in Bock-lieth. To the westwards of this Island goes through the
Cobbelieth, Cobbeliet
which men do sail through with bare winds, or when they must turn through,
because it is broader then on either side of Bock up Ra.

From Bock to the Wattingstream Wattingstream.
it is north a league, there you cannot sail amiss. If you do not sail
against the land, for there lie no dangers, except at the west shore lies a
suncken rock close by the land, whereupon remains at low water about ten foot
water. Upon the end of Watting stream, the course is north west about a shot of
a cast piece, or a quarter of a league, and then you come thwart of little
Alefioerd, Little Alifioerd.
which is a haven on the west shore, where is good anchoring both for a north
and south wind, under a high round Island, where you shall lie land-lockt. From
thence to the Reestone Reestone.
it is north about two leagues, betwixt them both on the west shore lies
great Alefioerd, Great Alefioerd.
which is also a haven both for northerly and southerly winds, thwart of it the
fareway is about two musket shot broad. The Reestone is a rock under water,
lying by the point, where the two high hills stand, which men do call the
Lethoorns, Lethorns.
these are two high sharp hills, which men may see far off, as they sail up
or off that Lies. Upon the Reestone stands always a Pole, that thereby men
may avoid it. You may also sail along to the eastwards of it, but to the
westwardes of it is broadest, and the right fareway, over against it on the
west shore lies Knorwyck, knorwike.
a haven where men may also anchor.

From the Reestone to Werckenesse, Werckenes.
the course is eastnortheast about a quarter of a league, and then you leave
the Island Asland lying on the larboard side to the northwards of you, in it
lie also two havens where you may also go to anchor, the one called
Struys-haven, Struys-haven. Schoon-haven. Ieltefioerd
and the other Schoon-haven. To the westwards of Asland you may sail to
Jeltefioerd, and run out there about northwest into the sea.

When you come out of the sea into Jeltefioerd, then you come into the
westwards of Asland against the Reestone into the Lies.

At the south point of Asland lies Ielteschaer, Ielteschaer.
a little round Island or rock, whereupon stands a great Iron ring when as
men come up the Lies and with calmes are in danger to be driven with the
current to the northwards along by Asland, then they bring with the boat a
cable fast on it. Men may wend round about the foresaid rock without any danger.

From Werckenesse to Hornesse, Hornesse.
it is east a little distance: when you come by it, you may see the town of
Bergen lie before you, you must anchor before it in the Wage, in 11 12 or 13
fathom.

To the northwards of Asland lies the Island Harle, Harle.
which is about five leagues long; when you come from the northwards, you may
run about it on both sides, and so come into the Waghe of Bergen. The
Harlefioerd goes out about north and by west, and northnorthwest betwixt
Asland and the land of Harle.

How these lands do lie one from the other, and from other lands.
From Schuytenes to Bommelshead northnorthwest somewhat northerly 7 leagues.
From Bommels-head to Cruysoort n.n.w. 9 leagues. From Cruysoort to Harle
northnorthwest 13 leagues. From Schuytenes to the Outseers west, and west and
by north 4 leagues. From the Outseers to Jeltefioerd, or the Wage of Bergen
north. 26 leagues. From Schuytenes to the Fly south and by east southerly 106
leagues. From Schuytenes to the Tessell, south and south and by east, 112
leagues. From Schuytenes to Walcheren south 138 leagues. From Schuytenes to the
Holms before Yarmouth south and by west, or somewhat more westerly 113 or 114
leagues. From Schuytenes to Flambrough head, southwest and by south 104 or 105
leagues. De Cust van NOORWEGEN Vertoonde van Bergen tot aen de hoeck van Horrel.
From Schuytenes to Tinmouth, the course is southwest, 99 leagues. From
Schuytenes to Boeckenes w. and by south southerly, 72 leagues. From the
Outseers to the Fly south and by east, 106 or 107 leagues. From the Outseers
to the rocks Outweers north and by west, somewhat northerly 43 leagues. From
Jeltefioerd or the wage of Bergen to Hitland, west 63 leagues. From
Jeltefioerd, or the Wage of Bergen, to the Northend of Hitland west and west
and by north 63 leagues. From Schuytens to Hitland west and by north, and
westnorthwest, 73 leagues. From Schuytenes to the north end of Hitland
westnorthwest somewhat northerly 80 leagues.
How these lands do show themselves at sea.
Thus shows the Boek, when you are to the southwards of Schuytener before the
Lies.
Thus shows the hill Sick, when you are to the northwards of Schuytenes.


The eighth Demonstration, Where in The Coast of Norway between Ieltefioerd
and the high point of Horrel is showed.
FRom Jeltefioerd, or the Wage of Bergen, to Old, the coast lies
northnorthwest, and north and by west about 16 leagues, that is all broken
land, with many rocks, where men may sail through within them. The Norway
Barks come off from Stade all along through that broken land and rocks, and
within the Island Harle unto Bergen.

About 4 leagues and a half to the southward of Old, lies a great row of
rocks, lying 3 or 4 leagues without the other rocks, thwart off from the shore
to seawards, called the Outweers. Outweers.


Betwixt them and Old lies a good Haven, called Southfoort, there lie 3
Islands before it, where men run in betwixt them both along into the Haven.

Old.
Old is a high rock, a good ways from the land, and loose from the other rocks
by the land, but has some small rocks lying about it, there lies alsoo a row
of rocks, a good ways off from it southwest into the sea.

About northwest and northwest and by north from Old lie 2 rows of rocks,
where of some lie above and some under water. When as you are either to the
northwards or to the southwards of Old, it does show it self with a great
saddle, in 2 hommockes, and going down round on both sides, but being thwart
off, or westwards from it, then it lies in one round hill, almost like Coll.
You may (coming from the southwards) run in about the eastwards within Old,
northeast to Oldesound, and come out again to the northwardes of Old. Four
leagues to the northwardes of Olde-sound lies Kyn, Kyn.
also a great rock, which men may sail round about, and shows it self with
2 sharp Hommckes, almost like a Cowes clawe, or Bishops Myter.

Betwixt Kyn and Old goes a great Sound into the land, upon which lie two
towns, Waldres and Easterdal. Waldres Easterdal.
Northwest and by west from Kyn lie three or four rocks, and also some suncken
rocks under water, Southwest and by west about 3 leagues off from it, lie also
some rocks above, and some under water.

Three or four leagues to the northwards of Kyn lies Ornael, Ornael.
also a great rock, which shows it self in one great high round Hill. Three
leagues, or three leagues and a half to the northwards of it lies the south
point of Stade. But Ornaell and Old lie about north and south 7 or 8 leagues
asunder.

Betwixt Ornael and the south point of Stade S^^de.
goes in a great broad sound, from whence men may sail through within the
broken land to the southwards to Bergen. A little within the south point of
Stade is a Bay, where men may go to anchor, thwart of a sea-beacon, and ly
sheltred for a west wind. North point off Staden.
The land of Stade lies from the south-point to the north point
northnortheast, and southsouthwest which is a whole main coast but full close
along by the shore, with many small rocks, but none that men may sail about
with in them for to have any shelter for the sea. The Norway Barks of all
places to the northwards of it, yea and all those which come off from the North
Cape, can sail all along the coast of Norway unto Berghen, through within
the rocks, except thwart of this land of Stade, Havens on Stade.
there they must run a seaboard through the sea.

Between these two foresaid points are also two little havens where men may
ride, but a little or nothing used.

To the northwards of Stade the Island lies with many Islands northeast to the
broadsound nine leagues. About half ways lies a little Island or rock,
called Swynoe Swynoe.
(that is Hogges-Island) a league from land without the other Islands of
Flowach. When you are close by the north point of Stade, and go on northeast
you run through within that little Island Swynoe, but with a northeast and by
north course about a sea-board of it.

He that is bound to Roemsdall, or into the Sounds of Sudmer, must run into
the Broad-sound, Broad-sound.
which goes in at the ends of the Islands of Flowach east and east and by
south, the outermost of these Islands is called Hassen. When you come to the
end of those foresaid Islands, you shall see east from you about two leagues, a
great high short Island, called Goedeu, Goedeu.
or of some Godsche-saed, and a little to the southwards of it, somewhat
further in a great black rock, of fashlon like a hay-cock, or almost like a
suger-loafe, it is called by the sailors the Cookes-broad: sail in right with
it, but bring not that foresaid rock to or under that Island, but keep it clear
off without it: for else you should surely sail upon the foresaid suncken
rocks, which lie under water at the north side of the broad-sound.

From the Island Goedeu or Godsche-sand runs off also a little riffe, to the
southwards, or toward the southeast from it. When you come by that Island
run about that little riffe, in betwixt it and the foresaid black rock, and
anchor a little within that riffe, under Goedue run not far within it, for
to avoyde a suncken rock, which lies somewhat further in, not far from land,
there stand two little wards upon the shore, a little within the risse, for
knowledge of the road.

Behind, or to the northwards of Godeu lies the little Island Geske: Geske.
upon it stands a little Church on the south side, before it men may also
anchor in eight or ten fathom clean ground.

A little within Goedue, on the east side of Geske lies another Island,
greater then Geske, called Walderoe, Walderoe
on both sides of the southeast point of that Island men may anchor in good
clean ground and lie land-lockt for all winds.

From thwart of Geske and Walderoe lies a great multitude of Rocks northwest
so far into sea, that coming a scaboard by Swynoe with a northeast course,
you should be far within them.

He that comes from the northwards may sail by west along by these rocks
to Goedeu, and leave the a foresaid suncken rocks (lying on the north side of
the Broad sound) on the starboard side of him, and run in about by the point
of Goedue, as has been beforesayd.

You may also run into the northwards of Goedeu, to wit in betwixt Goedeu and
Geske, and anchor within Geske, or under Walderoe, but it is not well to be
done, but for them which are there very well acquainted.

There lie many Rocks, some above, and some under water, whereof men must take
heed. In at the Broad sound is the best and surest.

For to run from Walderoe to Roemsdale, go on to the northwards, along by
the great Islands Luycko, it is in that farewaye, 10, 20, 14, 16, and 18 fathom
deep but even past Luycko runs a stone riffe thwart over the farewaye, on
against the point of the maine land, you must thereabouts edge off from the
Island on the larboard side, and run indifferent close along by that point
of the maine land on the starboard side, and then you run over the deepest of
that Stoneriffe, to wit, in 3 fathom or thereabouts, as soon as you shall be
over it, it is again very deep of 10, 20 and presently an hundred and two
hundred fathom. Run on still by the land on the starboard side, and very
close along by it, and leave all the Islands that lie on the larboard side,
and so you shall come unto the River of Roemsdale.

Toward the southeast from the foresaid Island Goedeu or Godsche-sand goes a
great deep river into the land, to Sickule, Honighpale, and other lading
places more.

How these lands do lie one from the other and from other lands.
From Jeltesioerd or the Waghe of Bergen to the Rocks of Outweers,
northnorthwest, and n. and by west about 11 or 12 leagues. From the Outweers
rock to Old, northnorthwest, and n. and by west betwixt 4 and 5 leagues. From
Old to Cyne n. and by east, and northnortheast 4 leagues. From Old to Ornael
north and north and by east 7 or 8 leagues. From Ornael to the south point of
Stade northnortheast, 3 leagues. From the south point of Stade to the north
point, n. n. east 8 leagues. From the north point of Stade to Swyno or Swynoost
northeast and by north 4 leagues. From Swynoe to the outermost of Flowach, or
the broad sound, northeast and by east 4 leagues. From the north point of
Stade to the Island Hessen, or the Broade-sound northeast 8 leagues. From
Hessen to Goedeu east, and east and by south 3 leagues. From Swynoe along
without the Roemsdaels schares to Boede, the course is northeast and by north
and northeast From Stade to the north-end of Hitland westsouthwest 66 leagues.
From Stade to the east point of Island, westnorthwest, 200 leagues. From Stade
to Greeneland northwest about 330 leag.
Of the Tides and Courses of the streams.
Betwixt Berghen and Stade the water rises and falls but it keeps no
certain tide a southsouthwest, and n. northeast moon makes there most full
sea.

Betwixt Stade, Luyckesound and Boe a southsouthwest and northnortheast moon
makes high Water.

When the south point of Stade lies northeast and by north from you, then it
shows with the land from thence southwards within Ornael, Kyne, and Old,
like as it is pourtrayed in this and the figure following.

The Land about Old

This follows the former figure.

When the point of Stade lies southsoutheast 8 leagues from you, it shows
thus.

figure following, and then you are open before the Broad-sound.
This follows the former figure unto Stade.
The form of Island Luycko, when it is east and by north from you.
Thus shows the Island Goedeu, being east from you.


The ninth Demonstration, Where in The Liet of Dronten is showed.
TO the northwards or northeastwardes from Geske lie (amongst a great many
other rocks and little Islands) five great Islands: the first called Luco,
Luco.
which is a high Island, like as also the second, betwixt these two goes in a
channel about southeast called Luycksound. Luycksound.


Upon the third called Harnsoe Harnsoe.
lies also a high hill, but it is at both ends somewhat low.

The fourth and smallest called Lemsoe Lemsoe.
or the low Island shows it self in 2 or 3 low hommocks.

The fifth called Flemseu, Flemseu.
or the Island, is a great and low Island, but seems little to see to at
sea, because there lies but one hommock upon it (not very great) and of
fashion as the roof or cabben of a Hoye, Roof Island.
or the west end highest within the east point of that Island is a good road
in a bight, where men lie landlockt for all winds.

To the northwards or eastwards of Flemseu or Roof Island, goes in a channel
called Nogwe Fioert, lying in east and by south, at which men may run in to
Roemsdale.

Without these foresaid Islands off from Luco unto Boede, lies a great
multitude of out rocks, great and small, called the Roemsdales Schares.
Roemsdales Schares


Eastwards from the Roof Island, or Flemseu, lies (amongst other rocks and
little Islands) the Island Lever, Lever.
which men may sail about on both sides, whether they be bound outward from
Roemsdale to Beresound or Boe, or inwards from Boe or Beresound, Beresound
and will run through the foresaid Islands.

Beresound is a Haven within some rocks even to the southwards or Westwards of
the point Boe, Boe.
there it is good lying, but not good to come into without a Pilot, or some one
that is there well acquainted.

Boede is an out-point, with a neck or small point of land, fast to the maine
land, along to the southwards of it men may run in and up, to the southwards
to Beresound, or else go to anchor in a bay on the north side behind Boe, by
some houses, where they may lie sheltred for a west wind.

From Boe to Stemmeshest, the coast lies about n. e. and by n. 2 leagues,
betwixt them both about half ways lie many small low black Out-rocks, as if
they were sown along the shore, called the Stoppels, Stoppels.
betwixt them and the maine land you cannot sail through with great ships
without great danger. The Norwaye Barckes run along with in them, and also
anchor there within, under a rock, which is somewhat greater then the rest, and
lies about the middst af the Stoppels (or somewhat nearer the main land)
called the Eartholm.

All the Islands betwixt Broad-sound or Flowach and Boe, belong under Roemsdale.

From Stade to Stemmeshest (or Stemmesnes) the course is along without the
Islands northeast and by n. about six and twenty leagues, the land betwixt them
both is called the Government of Roemsdael.

Stemmeshest Stemmes-Hest.
is a high point easy to be known, it shows it self (when as you get sight of
it, coming from the southwardes or the westwards) in two Hommocks thwart of it
goes in the Liet with diverse entries.

About a shot of a cast-peece from the point lies a black round rock,
altogether alone, not very great, called the black Ox. Black Ox.
Betwixt it and the point goes in an entry, called after the foresaid rock,
also the black Ox, northeast and by east, it is not very wide, and upon the
shoalest 4 or 5 fathom deep at low water, the nearer to the Ox the deeper, and
the nearer to the main land the shoaler water.

A little within the Rock, (the black Ox) lies an other great rock or Island,
pale of color, called White-holme, which you must leave (in sailing) also on
the larboard side, you cannot sail through betwixt it and the black Ox, be
cause from the one to the other it is all full of rocks some above and some
under water.

A little within or to the end of Whiteholm Whitteholme.
lies a sunken rock, Suncken Rock.
which you must leave also on the larboard side.

In calm weather or smooth water you cannot well see it, but when it does blow
any thing hard, you may well perceive it by the breaking of the sea upon it. On
the starboard side within Whiteholm, lies a great multitude of rocks, as if
they where sowed along the shore, amongst these rocks a little within or to
the eastwards of the point of Stemneshest lies Smeerholme, an Island, where
men may ride under, and lie sheltred for all winds, Smeerhelm.
except with e. and northeast winds, which blow there in open, with those
winds you cannot also come out there, neither with southsoutheast, south,
southsouthwest, and southwest winds, you cannot also come in there. You must
sail in there from the northwards, behind the Island. In the going in (which
is not above a cables length broad, 8 or 10 fathom deep) lies a little round
rock, at high water, about a fathom above water, by which you may run about
on both sides.

Northnorthwest about a half league from the black Ox lies also a greater
and broader, but a lower rock, called the Vogel, The Voghel.
which at high water lies a little above water, but with a spring tide the sea
runs along over it. Betwixt it and the black Ox there seems to lie in a
broad and wide channel, but betwixt them it is full of suncken rocks and
soul grounds under water: When it is smooth water, it is in no wise good to
run in there, but in foul weather and with a grown sea, and that you cannot
do otherwise, you might run in there by the breaking of the sea.

Mew-holme.
A great half league northnorthwest from the Voghel lie yet some rocks, lying to
the eastwardes, called the Mew-holmes, betwixt them and the foresaid Rock the
Voghell goes in a broad and large channel, very clean without any dangers,
which (after the Rock is also called the Vogell, there men may see all that can
do hurt. The marks for to find this channel) coming out of the sea are two
hills, very easy to be known, which lie from thence east and east and by
north within the land. The westermost is a hill somewhat low and round of
fashion, Clapmuts and Mangelbergh.
almost like a flat cap, called the Clapmuts. The eastermost is a high steep
sharp Hill, above on the one side with a cut, like as a steep, called
Manghelbergh. When these are one in the other, then they are about east and by
north from you, and then you are also right open before this channel.

For to sail in there, keep these two foresaid hills one in the other, and
sail in right with them east, and east and by north, or (when as you come
within the Vogel) somewhat more easterly, so that you have the foresaid Hills
out a head a little on the larboarde side, until that you come by the main
land, and then eastnortheast along by the shore, (if you be bound to
Dronten) unto the Island Edou or Edoe.

About a league within the Vogel lie two rocks, the westermost is high and
somewhat round, the other is low and also round, and lies to the eastwardes
from the first, toward the land, you shall run with the a foresaid course of
east and e. and by north off from the Vogel, about a shot of a cast-peece
along to the southwardes of the 2 rocks. About half ways betwixt them and
the Vogell, (but nearest the 2 rocks) lie two suncken rocks, Two sunken rocks.
these you leave with the same course also on the larboard side, you may see
the sea always break upon them, except in very smooth Water.

You may also sail through betwixt these two foresaid Rocks and the Mewholmes,
to wit, along to the northwardes of the rocks, until you come into the Liet,
leaving these 2 rocks on the larboard side, and the Mewholms on the starboard
side.

Along to the northwardes of the Mewholmes and those two foresaid rocks lies
also a channel where men may sail through into the Liet, then you must leave
these 2 rocks to the southwardes on the starboard side, and some other rocks
to the northwards of them on the larboard side, and so come also into the Liet.

About three quarters of a league within these two foresaid Rocks, lies a
great suncken rock, right in the midst of the farewaye, which breaks
always, and at low water is uncovered, about which you may sail on both
sides. From this suncken rock to Swegge sound, the course is east, and east and
by north a league, but the Voghel or black Ox and Sweggesound are distant
about three leagues.

Sweggesound Sweggesound.
is a little Haven behind three great rocks, with a little Island of an English
mile long on the east side of it, when you sail along by it, being but a
little off from the shore, you cannot discern this Island from the maine
land, but it seems to be all whole land, he that is not there very well
acquainted, cannot perceive that to be an Island, before that he come close to
it, for to run in behind it. You may sail into Sweggesound either to the
eastwards of that Island, or to the westwards of it, according as the wind
will serve. To the westwards of Sweggesound or the three foresaid rocks, at the
west end of the end of the foresaid Island lie a great multitude of rocks and
foul grounds.

For to sail into the western channel, you must leave them all on the
starboard side, and run in betwixt them and the three foresaid rocks: when
you come to the and of these three Rocks, you must luffe up to the southwards
about by them toward the northeast or north, and anchor there in seven or
eight fathom, there you shall lie landlockt for all winds, but with a storm out
of the west the grown sea can come in rolling there through. You may also
sail in further behind the rocks, until you come in behind the foresaid
Island, in a little narrow Bay, there men do lie in 2 fathom and a half, or
three fathom, and also sheltred for all winds. In this Haven of Sweggesound
the ships commonly do lie there to tarry for the wind. He that is bound to
the westwards, may run out to the southwards of the three foresaid rocks, and
he that is bound to the eastwardes, may sail out to the northwardes, through
betwixt the Land and the Island, but that channel is very narrow and not
above 2 fathom deep.

A half league to the eastwards of Sweggesound lies the haven of Bremsnes,
Bremsnes.
a little quarter of a league within it on the starboard side stands a little
church, with some houses, which you shall epsy behind a point, when as you
are come somewhat within, there dwells the Governor of Normer Leen. Men were
wont to come to anchor there to pay custom, but now the Kings Customer
dwells over against it in little Fossen, so that now at this present, men may
either go there, or to little Fossen for to pay their custom, according as
occasion does serve.

For to anchor before Bremsnes, you must look out for two beackons, which
stand by the church upon the water side, thwart of the innermost is the best
Road, and also the best ground, let your anchor fall there, in twenty,
fifteen, eight or ten fathom, that is near by the shore, for there it is
very steep rising ground, and make you fast with a hawser to the beakons,
there you shall lie landlockt for all winds, you may not anchor any where
thereabouts, then in the foresaid place, by reason of the great depth, and
very steep grounds.

Little Fossen or Fossound is a narrow haven, Little Fossound.
lying to the northwardes, over against Bremsnes, betwixt two lands. In these
two places lie the ships commonly to tarry for the wind, they that are bound
to the eastwards before Bremsnes, and they that are bound to the westwardes in
Little Fossen. Men may also sail from Fossen to the eastwardes, through
betwixt the foresaid land, and come into Stanwixfioerd again in room into
the Lies of Dronten, but it is a very narrow channel, and not well to be done
for them which are not there very well acquainted.

Westnorthwest, from the haven of Bremsnes goes a channel through the rocks
called Flessound, Flessound
after three round Rocks, Three Flessen.
called three Flesse which lie in a row without the east side of this
channel, and thereby is very easy to be known. A little within the three
Flesses, lies a great black flat rock, when you are by or in the Havens-mouth
of Bremsnes, it lies westnorthwest, or somewhat more northerly from you. For
to run out from thence at that channel, sail right with the aforesaid black
rocks, and run to the southwards of it close along by it, leaving it and
the Flesses on the starboard side, (to the norhwards of this flat rock and the
Flesse it is all full of rocks, some above and some under water) you shall then
leave on the larboard side of you two other round rocks, which you shall see
lie about a shot of a cast piece eastnortheast, or north. and by east one from
the other. When you are come without the Flesses, you shall be without all the
rocks, but somewhat to the westwards of them lies a great row of rocks, lying
westnorthwest a good ways into sea, you may run westnorthwest along by
them unto the end: when you are come without the Flesses you may set your course
somewhat more northerly, for to get sea room betimes. In this foresaid channel
there is no danger, that can hurt you, but you may see it. In the offing you
may know this foresaid channel, by the foresaid three Flesses.

The marks for to find Flessound, coming in out of the sea, are two high
Hills, the one called Freekol, Freekol.
lying upon an Island, toward the southeast, not far from Bremsnes, the
other called Northhorne, Northhorne.
lying far within the land. Freekol is a hill with two hommocks where of the
southermost is the smallest and lowest. Northhorne is a hill much higher, with
a sharp top, and lie always white, covered with snow. When this hill and
the foresaid southermost Hommock of Freekol stand one in the other (then they
are southeast and by south from you) and if that you sail in right with then,
you shall without fail fall right open before Flessound. It is a channel of a
shore inlet, and very commodious, as also Grypsound for them which coming
from Dronten, Edou, or any other place in the Lies, and before night cannot
sail to the channels of the black Ox or Voghel, for to run through them
into sea.

About a quarter of a league to the eastwardes of Bremsnes lies
Stangwyxfioird, a large broad sound, at the east point lies a great many
rocks, within lies a Haven, called Hamersound, Hammersound.
you may not come in there but with a Pilot except you be there extraordinary
well acquainted.

A quarter of a league within that foresaid point, on the north side of
Stangwyxfioird, lie two lade-places, Iorianwach and Lynwach, Iorianwach.
Lynwach.
men run in there to the northwardes, behind some rocks, but it is also
Pilots water.

Toward the southeast from Iorianwach, men may sail far within the land,
into diverse sounds, Stangwyxfioird, Schaelwicxfioird, Northfioird, Walsfioird,
Wenningfioird, and other more. Upon the land of Iorianwach lies the mountain
of Toester, in 2 hills, to the eastwardes of it upon the next land lies the
mountain of Stadebuye, also in 2 hills, as Toester. These hills of Toester and
Stadebuy, when you come from the westwardes along the Lies, lie right
behind one the other, and seem then to be no more then one hill, but being
thwart of them in the Liet, or at sea, each shows in 2, which is together
four very high hills, and are commonly called together without difference
Toester Poester. Toester Poester.


Betwixt Toester and Stadebuye runs through a narrow Sound, into the
Northfioird, called Soolsound. Soolsound
To the east of Stadebuye runs also another sound through into the
Northfioird, called Emmersound, within which on the north side, close by the
Northfioird is a lade place, where men do lade good deals.

A quarter of a league in the Liet, to the eastwards of Emmersound, Emmersound.
runs in another sound, at the entry broad and wide within it divides it
selve into 2 p^rts. Sailing in there you must leave Fisholme and the Yellowe
Island on the larboard side, and a rockie Island, called the flat Island, with
many Rocks on the starboard side. The Yellow Island The Yellow Island
is not well to be discerned from the main land, for those which are not there
well acquainted, the end of the Northfioird runs there about behind it, and
makes it an Island the Norwaybarkes run much thereabout behind it. To the
southwardes of the flat Island lies a Rock or little Island, Flatholm.
called Flathome, betwixt them both is good anchoring in 10 or 12 fathom,
landlockt for all winds.

Through this Sound men do run into Eursound, Eursound.
a lade place lying in the Northfioird, there stands a little church on the
west side of the flat Island. Betwixt the little Island is also a good haven,
where men may lie in three, four and five fathom, it is not broad but clean.
To the eastwards of this Yellow Island lies the high land of Dromsnes. Dromsnes
From thence eastwardes, further up into the Liet, toward Dronten or Agenes,
it is most all whole land, and not so broken, as to the westwards of it.

Thwart of the rocks of Hammer-sound (lying on the east side of Stangwyxfioird)
lies a fair channel called Gryp-sound, one of the best channells for to come
in out of the sea into the Liet, it is about a quarter of a league broad, and
goes in close to the eastwardes of the Island Grype.

Grype Gryp.
is a little round Island lying from the Voghell northeast and by east distant
about five leagues, upon it dwell many Fishernen, which go from thence to
sea, to fish upon diverse bancks, of forty, fifty, seventie, eighty, and
hundred fathom, four, five, six, seven, eight and some ten leagues without
the land, which they know to find by marks on the shore. On the north side
of Grype there lie but two or three rocks close to the shore, some say that
thereabout is anchor ground in twelve fathom. On the south or west side, it is
full of Rocks, but they lie most above water. About half ways betwixt Grype
and the three Flesses, somewhat without all the other Rocks, lies a suncken
rock a little under water, he that runs along without these rocks, must be
mindful thereof.

For to go into Grypesound coming in out of the Sea, Grypsound.
you must bring the high Mountain of Toester Poester eastsoutheast from you,
and sail in right with it, and so you shall not sail to run in sight of the
Island Gryp, which is easy to know from the other rocks, by the great many
Fishermens houses, which stand upon it, and upon no other Island nor Rocks
thereabouts, leave that Island on the starboard side, and go in first
eastsoutheast right with Toester, being past the Island Gryp, bring Toester two
points on your larboard bow, and go so in southeast, you shall come into the
Liet betwixt Hammersound and Toester. From thence to the little Island Edou
Edou.
are about four leagues. About three leagues to the westwardes of it, or a
league to the eastwards of Grypsound in the Lies, lies also a suncken rock,
almost even with the water, and almost amidst the farewaye, nearest the north
side, you may always see the sea break upon it, leave it on the larboard
side, and run to the southwards of it, there it is broadest, you may for a
need run also to the northwards of it through betwixt it and the other rocks,
but it is there narrow.

Edou Edou.
or Edoe is a somewhat low plain Island, a league long, and very narrow, which
is the first land out on the larboard side, upon the Liet, that men have
shelter of from the sea, to the westwards of it, there is nothing but broken
land, Rocks and little Islands, where the grown sea comes rolling in
through. Not far from the west end, upon the south side of Edou, stands a
little white Church, thwart of it, or a little to the eastwards of it, men may
anchor in eight, nine, and ten fathom. The shore is steep rising ground: If
men do come near it in four fathom, they shall be presently fast, but the
ground is soft. When as men come from the westwards, and will anchor there,
they must (coming near the west end of the Island) continually feel with the
lead for the anchor ground, and so soon as they feel it, let fall their
anchor, thwart of the aforesaid little white Church, or a little to the
eastwardes of it, so that the little Church come to stand over the houses. When
as they let fall their anchor in 10 fathom, and wending up toward the land,
very out the cable then the ship shall come to lie there in six fathom,
the Liet is thereabouts about a half league broad.

Upon the east end of Edou is also a little haven called Kurow, Kurou.
and it is so little that there can lie no more then two or three ships, there
lies a little black rock not far from the shore, men do run in betwixt
that little rock and the Island, and anchor betwixt them both, there men lie
landlockt for all winds, but the ground there is not clean.

At the east end of Edou lies another Island somewhat long, called Glaseu.
Glaseu.
To the eastwards of it runs a great broad Sound into sea, called
Ramsfioird, but it is known of few. Ramsfioerd.
With northerly winds there comes through a great grown sea into the Lies.

To the eastwards from Ramsfioerde lies the land of Hitteren, two great long
Islands. Norther Hitteren, Highland of Hitteren.
and Souther Hitteren, together about seven leagues long, so that he that
sayleth up the Lies thwart of them, can not perceive otherwise, but that he
sayleth in betwixt two maine lands. At the south end or west end of Hitteren,
which is on the cast side of Ramsfioerd ly two little Islands, called Weroy,
Weroy.
there you may sail in betwixt them, and anchor in good white sand ground, you
may also sail through betwixt the little Islands, along into the Liet, and
then you leave a suncken rock lying on the starboard side by the southermost
little Island.

From the Island Edou to the Highland, or the point of Dromsnes Dromsnes
it is northeast and by east and eastnortheast distant about three leagues. To
the westwards of that point, to wit, betwixt that point and the land to the
westwardes of it called Schipnes, lies a haven called Schaerswycke.
Schaerswyke.
In the mouth of this haven, about the midst of the channel, but somewhat
nearer Schipnes then Dromsnes, lies a suncken rock, which falls dry at low
water, you may run in about it on both sides. A little within the point, on
the south side stands a Countriemans house, before which you may anchor in
five, six or seven fathom, clean rising ground, which you may come near by
your lead. This haven lies about a league more to the eastwards, then
Ramsfioird, on the south side of the Liet, fit for to come to anchor in, for
those which can sail no further by day. To the westwards of this foresaid haven
Schaerswycke along the land of Schipnes, lie many Rocks by the shore, some
above and some under water, therefore you must somewhat shun the southshoare
thereabouts, but the north shore along by Hitteren is very clean. The Liet
is thereabouts a great half league broad.

About five leagues to the eastwards of Schaerswyke, on the north side of the
Lies, lie the two Islands of Lexen, Lexen.
to wit, norther and souther Lexen, which are together about a half league
long. There the Liet lies betwixt both eastnortheast, and northeast and by
east.

In souther Lexen is a baye, before which lies a round rock, making it there
within a fair haven, called the haven of Lexen the best haven of all the Liet.
John Geurtson Boogart of Amsterdam, has (at this own charges, for the
commodity of ships that come there) caused to be made a great Iron ring: men
do anchor either to the eastwardes or to the westwardes of the foresaid rock,
where they will in six, seven or eight fathom, and bring a hawser on the
foresaid Ring, the further men do run into the Bight, betwixt the Rock and
the land, the shoaler it is but all clean and clear ground.

Road under north Lexen.
At the norther end of norther Lexen is also a place, where is good anchor
ground fit for to make road in.

Over against the haven of Lexen lies another haven called Moltow, Moltow.
where the ships do oftentimes anchor in the Harvest or beginning of the
winter, for to set sail with an east wind, because they can hardly get to
sail from Lexen with easterly winds.

A league to the southwards or to the westwards of these havens of Lexen and
Moltow, on the south shore, lies a little Island, whereupon stands a
Warder, called Swanholm Swanholm.
which men may sail round about; under that little Island it is good anchoring
(as well for them which are bound to the eastwards as to the westwards) in 4 or
5 fathom good clean sand ground.

The south side of the Liet off from Schaerswyke along to Hegwyke, (which is
a league and a half, and two leagues by west the point of Agenes) is most
clean with little foul grounds: but from Hegwyke along to Agenes the coast
is foul and rocky. The north side along by Hitteren, is also indifferent
clean, except at the north end lie some rocks called the Terlingen, which lie
somewhat off to the southwards from the shore into the Liet. A little to the
eastwards of Hemnesioird, Hemnefioird.
over against Hemneschell (an Orchard upon a high land) there the Liet is at
the narrowest, and no more then a half quarter of a league broad.

Hemnesfioird lies over against the north end of Hitteren, it is a bay where
many Sawes do stand, and abundance of good Deals are cut and laden.

To the northwards or eastwardes of the Terlingen, at the north end of
Hitteren, in betwixt Hitteren and Lexen, lies a haven called Deepsound,
Deepsound.
the Norway Barks (coming from the southwards) run in there along behind Lexen
to the northwards.

From Lexen to the point of Agenes Agenes.
on the south side, or to Euriland on the north side, the Lies lies along
eastnortheast and northeast and by east 3 leag. Agenes is the northermost point
of the Lies, you must go about by it when you are bound to Dronten.

Betwixt Norther Lexen and Euriland lie two Islands, the southermost is called
Fossen, Fossen.
the northermost Garten, Garten.
to the southward of Fossen you may sail through along into the sea, but not
without a Pilot.

For to sail from Lexen to Agenes, run along by the north shore, which is
the cleanest, the south shore is foul. A cables length or a cables length and
a half to the westwards of the point Agenes, lies a suncken rock not far
from the shore. For to avoid it and more other danger, keep along by the
north shore (but take heed that you run not in to no bights or bays) so long
until that you can see the houses upon Agenes, then sail toward it, and then
you shall not sail within any dangers on the south shore. On the point of
Agenes is also a great Iron Ring for to moore the ships to there by it is
deeper and steep off-going soul ground. For to anchor there you must be very
close by the shore before you shall find ground, and then you must make a
cable fast on the foresaid Ring, close to the shore it is about five of six
fathom deep foul ground.

On the north side of the Liet over against the point of Agenes, lies
Euriland, Euriland.
a flat fair green land, upon it stands a little white Church about an
English mile off from the shore within the land, almost like the little Church
of Edou, thwart of it is a good road clean flat rising sand, and clay ground,
men do commonly anchor there thwart of the first beakon in seven, eight or
nine fathom good clay ground, 16, 17 or 18 fathom men lie far from the shore.

With contrary winds, or that men can not come about Agenes, or taken with the
night, they do anchor most commonly there.

By Agenes there runs out always a great strong current to the westwardes,
and by reason the lands from thence to the southwardes on both sides are very
high, and the wind (being southerly) falls there betwixt then both, always
strong to the northwards, men can not (in sailing up) get any thing there with
turning to windewards, but in sailing off they may get much by the current with
turning to windewards.

A little about the point of Agenes on the starboard side, is a great Bay
called Salva, Salva.
wherein is good anchor ground, and good lying, but with northerly winds it is
very hard to come out there for those that are bound out, or to the westwards.

From Agenes to the point of Rooberg, the Liet lies southsoutheast about three
leagues. About half ways or somewhat more on the west side lies another bay,
called Lenswycke, where men may have road.

Roobergh Roobergh.
is a somewhat flat point, to the eastwards or to the northwards about this
point is good road in six or seven fathom. Road.
A good ways from the shore to the westwards of the point, the Norway Barks
do oftentimes anchor, but the ground there is not clean, and therefore it is
no good road for great ships.

Over against Roobergh lie diverse Bays and havens, as Urkedal, Bursen, Bursen.
Bodwyke Bodwyke
and other more, where many Deals are cut and laden.

From Roobergh to the little Island or Holm of Dronten, Holm of Dronten.
the course is east 3 leagues, when you are a little past Rooberghen, you shall
soon espy it against the high land to the eastwards of Dronten, betwixt them
both it is wide and broad. From the point of Roobergh the land lies up to the
northwards so far that at some places men can hardly see over the water. When
you come by the Holm, you may sail about within it on both sides, you must
bring the Holm to the northwards Rivier van Londen

Pascaarte van ENGELANT Van to Voorlandt tot aen Blakeney waer in te sien is de
mont vande Teemse.

of you, and anchor to the southwards of it in six, seven or eight fathom,
according as you lie close to it or far from it, there is clean clay ground.
The Holm and the Elf, or river of Dronten lie north and south about a shot of a
cast piece assunder, betwixt them both it is every where good anchor-ground,
and depth of 20 and 21 fathom.

About a bow-shot northeast from the Holm lie two suncken rocks, which at low
water are uncovered. When as they are even covered with the flood, then you may
sail in over the shoalest of the Bar into the Elf with a ship that draws
11 foot.

To sail into the Elf of Dronten, it is Pylots water, there stand commonly two
or three masts for beakons, but there is no certainty of them that men may
trust unto, for they are oftentimes shifted: sometimes they stand on the east
side, sometimes on the west side, and also sometimes on both sides. When you
come a ships length or two within the beakons you shall come to a chindely
point on the starboard side, by which you must luff up to the Kay: upon the
Bar it falls with a spring tide almost dry, but within it is deeper.

Of the streams on these coasts.
From Stade to Dronten a south and by east and north and by west moon makes
high water, with a spring it falls a fathom and a half up and down, with an
ordinary tide scarce a fathom.

The tides run not there along the land, but the flood falls thwart on
against the land, and the ebb to the contrary thwart from the shore to
seawards.

The tenth Demonstration, In which The east side of England, is showed, from
the River of London to Wells.
BY two ways men may sail into the river of London, from the southwards
along by the north Forland, and from the northwards along by the Naes. If
you will sail in there from the southwards, then you must first shun the North
Forland, it is there shoale a good ways from the shore, bring the north
Forland also not more southerly from you then southwest, that you do not run on
against the north-grounds, which lie far to seawards. Coming by the land,
run along by it, but come not too near it, that you loose sight of the spyre
of the steeple of Margat behind the land, for then you should come too near
it; but if you keep so far from the shore, that you can see the foresaid
steeple above the high land, or keep it even in your sight, then you cannot
take hurt of the south grounds. Coming thwart of Margat, then you are past the
foresaid shoals or south grounds. Run then boldly toward the shore, and
within two cables lengths along by it, for to avoid the north grounds, which
lie far to the southwards toward the land. Sail on so west all along by
the shore, until that the Reculvers (which are two steeples upon one Church)
come one in the other, and then you shall run in sight of the first buy upon
the Lasts, which lies upon the foresaid marks of the Reculvers, Reculvers
being by it you can also see the other buy which lies like as the first also
on the north side, and over against it on the south side stands a beakon,
there you must sail through betwixt them both, leaving the buy on the
starboard side, and the beakon over against it on the larboard side. From
thence you may with little ships, or ships of little draught, but not with
ships of great draught, at high water run over the Swallow on westnorthwest
toward Sheppy, for it is there shoale water, with ships of great draught you
must run through the Fishers deep toward Black-tayle. You may also run
from Margat with small ships along by the shore upon the lead at high
water even unto the Sheppy, but in sailing, along there you must cast your
tides well, for the flood falls very strong into the Swallow, and the ebb to
the contrary very strong out.

When you come by Sheppy, Sheppy.
run within two cables lengths along by it, for to avoid the tail of the
Spanjard, The Spagniard.
until that you be past Quinsbrough, edge then off from the south shore for
to avoid the Noere, The Nore
which is a sand that shoots off from the south point of the River a good
ways to the eastwards, upon the outermost end where of stands always a
beakon, whereby you may know it. Run along to the northwards of it, leaving
it on the larboard side, and along in the middle of the channel into the
sea-reach for to avoid the grounds which lie off from the north shore, go in
so along toward Gravesend.

To sail with ships of great draughts along by the north Forland up into
the Thames, you must (when you are past the buys upon the Last) sail through
the Fishers deep, Fishers-deep.
toward Black-tayle, which lies from the second buy upon the Lasts, unto the
first buy in the Fishers deep, northwest and northwest and by west, which
lies upon the north side of the sand, which men do call the Spanjard, those
two buys lie a great ways one from the other.

Sailing from the buy upon the Lasts it is a great ways all shoale water, so
that you must run over there with high water, but coming near the buy upon
the Spanjard, it is by little and little deeper water. He that will sail over
here, must reckon his tides well, the flood falls there along toward the
southwest almost thwart over the deep and the ebb to the contrary.

The second buy in the Fishers Deep you must leave on the starboard side, and
the buy upon the Spanjaerd on the larboard side: being past that you come
against the Blacketayle, to the southwards of the Shoebeakon into the right
deep. The cast point of Sheppy shall then lie about south from you. From the
Shoe-beakon the course is southwest to the point of Blacktaile there runs
off a hook which men might (at unawares) sail within (coming from the
northwards) in five or six fathom, but if you keep from the shore in seven
fathom, you cannot sail within it. From Black-taile to the beakon upon the
Noere, the course is westsouthwest, leave it on the larboard side, as before is
said, and run in along the river, in the middst of the channel betwixt
both lands unto Gravesend.

For to sail into the river of London coming from the northwards For to sail
into the river off London from the northwards.
you must come near the coast to the northwards of Orfordnes which is to the
northwards of all the sands, there lie Albrough, Dunwich, Walderswike, Soul
and Covehit, all betwixt Orfordnes and Leystaf. Covehit is a sharp steeple like
as also Leystraffe, but Soul and Walderswyke, Albrough and Orfordnes are flat
steeples Soul Soul.
and Dunwich Dunwich.
lie both upon the high land, betwixt them both is a valley, therein you may
see Walderswike when you are thwart of it Dunwich is the best to be known of
all these foresaid places: it has two flat steeples, and on both sides some
trees. To the southwards of it lies Albrough Albrough
which is also very easy to be known, it has one high flat steeple with three
mills, the two stand to the northwards, and the third to the southwards of
Albrough when you are thwart of it, but sailing to the southwards, they come at
last all three to the southwards of it. The land without Albrough, and to the
southwards of it is very low flat and chindely land.

Betwixt Albrough and Dunwich about half ways betwixt them, lies a Wood which
is at both ends high, and in the midst low with a saddle; this you shall
commonly see first when you fall with the land thereabouts, and is the best to
be known for to know the coast by; the land without it, and to the southwards
is very low flat chindely land. About two leagues to the southwards of Albrough
lies Orfordnes, Orfordnes.
betwixt them both stand also two woods of trees, which show themselves a far
off like castles or towers. Orfordnes is a flat steeple with a thick or broad
castle, which has also athick flat steeple, almost of fashion like the steeple
of Rarop, open above with holes in it like Bellholes.

Before Dunwich you may anchor, there is good lying in eight or nine fathom,
somewhat soft ground. Before Albrough is the best road of all the coast
thereabouts in six and seven fathom.

East from Aelbrough about two league lies Aelbrough Knock, Aelbroug Knock.
this is a sand which at low water is not deeper then seven or eight foot: you
may sound round about it in five fathom, but is not good to come nearer it.
With sea winds you may descerne it plainly by the breaking of the sea upon it;
but with lawderly or westerly winds, and fair weather, the sea breaks not
upon it, he that runs thereby to the northwards with an ebb shall see it
commonly ripple very much upon it, like as upon most of the English bancks, and
not indeed upon the banks, but against them, for upon the shoalest or midst
of the banks is always the smoothest water, like as you find every where.

When as Aelbrough is west from you, and the two steeples of Orfordnes are one
in the other, there you shall find Albrough Knock. These are sure marks of
that sand.

The Whiting, or Whiting sand, is somewhat a long small sand lying before
Orfordnes, and the chindely land to the southwards of Aelbrough, and lies
along the reach, but the south end lies further from land then the north
end, there is at low water not above six or seven foot water upon it. Coming
from the northwards, men sail commonly to the westwards of it, that is through
betwixt the land and Whiting-sand, toward the Naze. Men may also sail along
to the eastwards of it, through betwixt Whiting-sand Whiting-sand.
and the eastermost point of the Court, The Court
or Court-sand, which some do call the Rib.

The north end of the Whiting lies along close to the shore, and lies from
the steeples of Orfordnes southeast and by south, it is so exceeding steep and
needle too, that you shall have the one cast nine, the next cast five fathom,
and then you are no more but a ships length from it, before you can heave the
lead again you should be upon it. When as you sit with the foreship against it,
it is at the stearne five or six fathom deep.

Along the inner-side, it is also every where so steep, that you cannot
sound it, but on the outer side you may run along by it in five fathom
upon the lead, until you come within the sands.

When as you come from the northwardes and will sail through within the
Whiting, you must run close along by the shore, and southwest about by the
point of the chindle to the southwardes of Aelbrough; until you come within
the north point of the Whitinge, when the steeples of Orfordnes come to be
northwest and by north from you, then you are right thwart of the north point
of the Whiting, being within it go again more southerly, to wit, southwest
and by south toward Balsy cliffe.

If you should fall to the southwards of Whiting, or else coming from the
southwards will sail in there to the northwardes, then bring the steeples of
Orfordnes westnorthwest or northwest and by west, but for all not more
northerly then northwest from you, and sail so right in until you come by the
Chindle strand, then run in along by it, as is before said, and then you
shall run far enough along to the northwardes of the Whiting.

For to run into the eastwards off the Whyting.
If you will sail into the eastwardes or the southwardes of the Whiting, then
bring the steeples of Orfordnes northnorthwest, or northwest and by north, or
northwest from you, and sail in so right with them; until that the wood of
trees, that stands upon the next point to the southwardes of Balsy cliffe,
come to Balsy cliffe, which shall then stand about westsouthwest from you,
keep that aforesaid wood to the south side of the cliffe, and sail in
bouldly right with it, and then you shall run right in the farewaye, in
betwixt the Whiting, and the tail of Courtesand but if you bring the foresaid
trees more then a handspikes length without the cliffe, you shall not fail to
run on against the point of the Court. That aforesaid wood of trees is very
easy to be known, because there abouts stand no other trees.

Or bring the steeple of Balsy westsouthwest from you, and sail in so right
with it, until you come by Whiting-sand, in five or six fathom: and lead it
in so by, it upon the lead, until that you come by Balsy, or that you get
deeper water.

When you come near Balsy, whether you be come in from the northwards, or the
southwardes of Whitingsand, you must keep somewhat off from the shore,
because of a litttle riffe or smalltayle, that shoots off from the shore,
thwart of Balsy cliff, which you must avoyde somewhat, with ships of great
draughts, there remains at low water upon it not more then two fathom, you
may commonly perceive it well by the rippeling of the tide.

Fot to sail in at a channel through the Court.
You may also sail into the southwardes, of the Ribbe (that is, the tail of
the Court or Courte-sand) thus: Bring the steeple of Balsy northnorthw. or a
little more northerly from you, and sail in so right with it, and so you shall
run into the northwardes, or through the Court, at a channel of eight
fathom depth, the e. side of this channel is steep, come no nearer it then
eight fathom, but by the w. side you may run in about by the Court, upon the
lead, until you come within the sands.

Balsy.
Balsy has a high flatt steeple, and lies somewhat within the land behind the
cliff, when as you come from the northwards, you may see Balsy to the
northwards or the westwardes, of the cliffe, but you sail it altogether
behind the cliffe, so that at last it comes out again to the southwardes of
it.

For to sail into Harwich.
If you will sail to Harwich being past Balsy, then bring Balsy to that
steep-poynt to the southwardes of Balsy where trees stand upon, keep these
marks so standing, and run so along by the shore, until that you be over
the point of the Chindle, the marks thereof are two high trees within the
land, when they are about northnorthwest from you, then they come one in the
other with the steeple of Harwich, and then you are right over the point of the
Chindle, and then you shall get deeper water, to wit sour and five fathom or
somewhat more against the highest water. Run in then about by the point, the
channel lies in right north, but in the midst of the havens mouth lies a
suncken rockie and stony ground, which you must avoid, you may sail in about
it on both sides, by the one shore or the other, but along by the east
shore it is best, being within it, you cannot sail amiss, or take hurt, if
you do not sail bluntly against the shore: there you may anchor al over,
where you please before the town, in five, six and seven fathom. You may well
also go further into the bight, there it is clean every where. The farewaye
betwixt Ordfornes or Whitingsand and the Naes lies most southwest and by
south, and is six, seven and eight fathom deep, in turning to windewards, you
may run to the shore in 5 and 4 fathom, but close to the sands it is deeper,
to wit, eight nine and ten fathom, the nearer the sands the deeper water.

But for to sail from Balsy to the Naze, The Naze
you must mark the steeple of Balsy, when it comes within a capstane bars
length near to the south end of the cliffe, then keep them so standing, so
long until that the house upon the Naze come over the two fields, which lie on
against the Highland, or come over a black head upon the sea side, sail then
right in with them, until that the steeple of Harwich come to be
northnorthwest from you in the little valley off a redd cliffe, leave then the
first marks, keep the steeple of Harwich in that little valleye, and go on
southsoutheast, until that the third point of the Naze come without the 2
other points, so you shall run through betwixt the Naze and the course, there
remains at low water no more then eight, ten, and at same places twelve
foot water, therefore it is not good to run through here, unless that it be
a quarter flood or with a ship of great draught at half floude, there it is
very uneven ground rockie and stony. The point of the Naze is vere stony,
soul and uneven, the nearer the shore thwart of that point the shoaler, but
the nearer the Sands the deeper.

When that the third point of the Naze comes without the two other points or
the other land, and that it does again begin to deepen off, to wit; 4 or
five fathom then go southwest somewhat southerly, or southwestand by south,
unto the buy upon Longsand. Longsand
Thwart of the Naze is Longsand very steep, so that it cannot be well sounded
with the lead by them that are not there very well acquainted, but somehwat
more to the southwards, you may run along by it in four fathom, and three
fathom and a half, until that you get the buy upon Longsand in sight of you.
The north shore to the southwards off the Naze is also flat, you may run
along by it also upon the lead, without any danger.

The buy upon Longsand lies in 2 fathom and a half at half flood, you must
leave it on the larboard side, and the Buy upon the Spits, Buys upon Longsand
and the Spits.
on the starboard side, which lies a little shoaler, they lie about south and
by east and north and by west, a musket shot one from the other. The course
betwixt the two buys is southsoutheast and northnorthwest, but you must reckon
well your tide, whether you run through there with a floude or with an ebb.
Upon the Spits, The Spits
betwixt the two buys is at half flood at least three fathom and an half, or
almost four fathom, in the right channel, a little to the southwardes of the
buy upon the Spits stand two masts above water, of a lost shipp, which are good
marks. Being over the Spits, the course to Whitakers beakon Whitakers beakon.
is southsouthwest.

About half ways, betwixt them stand also 2 mastes more on the same w. side,
and over against these masts lies a middle plate, whereupon lies a buy on
the w. side: the fareway is along to the westwards of this Middle-plate,
through betwixt that foresaid buy and the mastes.

To the northwards of that foresaid Middle plate, Middle-plate.
goes out a channel by the south side of Longsand, which you may sail out
and in, called the Kings-deepe. If you come from Whitakers beacon, past the
Middle-plate, so far that you get sight of the buys of Longsand or Spits, go
then boldly eastnortheast and northeast and by east into sea, or upon the lead
along by Longsand, but if you should run into sea, to the southwards of the
Middle-plate, you should with an eastnortheast way fall within the hook of
the Mouse. This Kings-deepe Kinghs-deepe.
is a ready channel, and is used almost by all ships for to run out at.

For to sail into the Kings deep.
For to run in at this channel out of the sea, then bring the point of the
Naze northwest from you, and sail in so with it, until that you come near
Goemfliet or Longsand in five fathom, go in then along by it about
westsouthwest and southwest, and by west, and keep the sounding of Longsand;
and so you shall not fail to run in sight of the buy upon the Spitts and the
foresaid masts to the of it.

From Whitakers beacon to the Shoebeacon the course is southsouthwest somewhat
westerly, coming thwarte of the Shoebeakon, then lies the east point of
Seppie about south from you. From the Shoebeakon Soebeakon.
the course is along southwest to the point of Blacktayle, there runs off
a Hook, which men might sail within coming from the northwards: but if you
keep from the shore in 7 fathom, you cannot take hurt of it, but in five
fathom you run within it. The like Hook is also a little to the southwards
of the Shoebeakon, which you might unawares sail within, coming from the
southwardes.

From Blacktayle Blacktaile
to the beacon upon the Nore, the course is westsouthwest. The Nore The Nore
is a sand, lying from the south point of the maine land of the river, far to
the eastwardes, therefore leave the beacon on the larboard side, and go on
west along, amidst the channel into the river, betwixt both the lands, as
here before has been said in the description of the Fishers deep.

From Aelbrough along by Dunwitch to Covehit the coast lies north and by
east somewhat easterly, and south and by west or somewhat westerly five
leagues: but from Covehit to Leystaf north and south two leagues. Aelbrough,
Dunwhitch and the sands lying thereabouts, are descriptt here before.

Betwixt Dunwhitch and Covehit lies the haven of Soul Soul.
which is a little shoale river, a little within it divides it self into three
parts, upon the northermost arm lies Soul upon the middlemost Walderswycke,
and upon the southermost Dunwitch. Dunwich


Covehit has a high sharp steeple, thwart of it lies a banck not far from
land, which falls almost dry at low water, but a half flood you may sail
through betwixt it and the land in 3 fathom, upon the outer side it is very
steep, so that you cannot come nearer it then nine or ten fathom. When the
steeple of Easton is westnorthwest from you, then you are to the southwards of
the banck, and when the steeple of Covehit is southwest and by west from you,
then you are to the northwards of it.

Two leagues to the northwardes of Covehit lies Leystaf, Leystaf.
and two leagues more to the northwardes of it lies Yarmouth. The steeple of
Leystaff is a high sharp steeple, and stands a great musketh shot within the
land from the houses, so that in sailing along you may bring the steeple on
both sides of the houses. Off from Leystaff begin the banck or Holmes of
Yarmouth and lie along to the northwards past Yarmouth, until thwart of
Winterton, there go diverse channels through them, which men may sail through,
upon diverse marks, for these that are there acquainted, you may sail through
within these bancks, For to come with i^ the bancks of Yarmouth
off from Leystaff until past Winterton.

If you will run through from before Leystaf within these bancks, then look out
for the firebeakons which stand by Leystaf, which are two little white houses,
the one stands beneath upon the chindle on the sea side, and the Innermost
upon a little hommock, somewhat farther within the land. When you come from the
southwards, they show themselves to the northwards of the town, but come at
last thwart of it. In the night there is always fired upon then, for to sail
in there also by night. Bring these foresaid firebeakons northwest and by
north, or somewhat more northerly from you and sail in so right with them
either by night or by day, the church of Leystaf comes then to the
southwards of the Town over a Country house by the water side, when you come
against the channel, there is at low water no more then 3 fathom depth, keep
these foresaid firebeakons one in the other, or bring the Innermost rather a
little to the northwards of the outermost, for to avoid a little plate, which
lies on the south side of the Deep, but the channel is indifferent wide, run
until you come against the strand in two fathom and a half or two fathom, so
near as you will or can, and go then up northwardes along by the shore, you
shall then (having sailed a little to the northwards) meet with a flat,
whereupon remains at low water less then two fathom depth, with laden ships,
you must anchor before that flat and stay for high water, it flows there
about eight foot, up and down, so soon as you are over the flat it will be
5, 6, and 7 fathom deep, edge then to the shore, and sail toward it, and then
you come before the Brewehouse, there is the road, where you may anchor in 4,
5, or 6 fathom, from thence northward toward Yarmouth along the shore is all
over good anchoring and good ground.

About an English mile or somewhat more to the southwards of the town
Yarmouth, is the haven of Yarmouth, Haven of Yarmouth
it has two wooden heads, where you must sail in betwixt them both against
the highest water, when the strongest of the flood is spent, at half flood it
is dangerous, because of the strong tide, which should lightly carry you into
the bight, against the shore, (against your will) it is also best to run in
along by the southerhead, there it is deepest. Rode before Yarmouth.
At Yarmouth in the road men do commonly anchor to the northwards of the
haven, right thwart of the town, in 5, six, seven, or eight fathom the nearer
you anchor to the sands the deeper water you shall have, but all good sand and
soft grounds.

If you will sail into the Road of Yarmouth through the Holmes, then bring
the sharp little steeple, that stands to the northwards of Yarmouth within
the land, over the broad castle, or bring the mill to the north side of the
town: keep these marks so standing, and go in so westnorthwest, you shall
find in this channel not less water then eight or nine fathom at half flood,
this channel is called S. Nicholas channel: S. Nicholas channel.
on the north side it is deepest being come in, the road is right before the
town in five and six fathom.

Thwarte or over against the haven of Yarmouth goes also a channel through
the Holmes, for to sail in through there coming from the southwardes then
bring the Souton over the north side of the haven; the great tree betwixt
Northon and that flat little house or castle, sail in right with them, and
keep these marcks so standing, until that you be within the Holms, within them
lies a plate on the starboard side, a little to the northwards of haven,
called the Middle ground, you may sail about it is on both sides, on the
inner side in five fathom, but toward the Holmes, or about to the eastwards of
it in eight and nine fathom.

From Yarmouth to Winterton, the coast lies north and by west and
northnorthwest two leagues.

If you will sail from Yarmouth forth through within the banks to the
northwards, sail a long by the land, and keep the sounding of the shore in 5,
6, or 7 fathom, until that you have the two firebeacons, (which stand a little
to the northwards of Castor) one in the other, sail then right with then,
either by day or by night, (in the night there is fired upon them) you shall so
run over a flat, through betwixt 2 buys, which lie each of them upon a tail of
a sand; sail boldly in with the foresaid firebeacons, until you come again
near the shore, in 5 or 6 fathom, being come by the shore, run then again
along by it, and keep the sounding there of as before, al along until you
com before Winterton.

Thwart of Winterton runs off a dangerous rif, which is dangerous to sail
about by night, if men do come too near it, which is upon the end so steep,
that (in 3 fathom or 2 fathom and a half) you shall not be a ships length off
from it. But when as you (coming from the southwards) keep your self in six or
seven fathom, then you cannot sail so near to it. To the southwards of that
rif upon the land, stands a firetowre, which is very easy to be known, with
a firebeakon, and also a little white house, when these come one in the other,
then you are thwart of the point of the riff.

To the northwards of this riff upon the land stand two white firebeakons,
whereupon there is fired by night, for to avoid this riff. When as you come
thwart of the point, then are these also one in the other, so that these do
serve for thwart marks, and the other to the southwards of them for longst
marks, for those that will sail about it from the southwards. Coming from the
northwards along the shore in 5 or 6 fathom, until you come by the
firebeakons upon the north side, you must keep somewhat off from the shore,
before they come one in the other, or else you should run on against the rif.
When they are one in the other then they stand s. w. and by w. from you, and
when as the high firebeakon to the southwards of Winterton comes to be s.
west, somewhat more westerly from you, then you are thwart of the point of the
rif: you may not also run about far within that riff, for then you should
lightly be foul of the grounds on the eastwards of it, especially when you
come from the northwards for there it is not very wide betwixt them both.

From Winterton to Haesbrough point, the course lies northwest 3 leagues.

Betwixt Haesbrough and the Admiralshouse stands a ruinous tower upon the
strand. When as you keep it and the steeple of Haesbrough one in the other
coming from the northwards, then you run right upon the point of the foresaid
riffe. Four leagues without the land lies Winterton sand, the south end where
of lies about east and the north end northeast from Winterton.

Thwart of Admiralshouse, not far from the shore, lies also a little plate
where no ship can go over, but if you go in six or seven fathom, you cannot
sail too near it, you may also run through in 2 fathom, betwixt this plate
and the land.

From Haesbrough to Cromer, the coast lies along northwest and by west, and
westnorthwest, three or four leagues.

The land lies from Cromer to Bornum first westnorthwest and west and by
north, and then west, and west and by south 9 or 10 leagues.

From Cromer to Blakeney it is 2 or 3 leagues. At Blakeney Blakeney.
stands a high steeple, which you may see along far over the land, when
it comes to the little steeple, then you have the first buy of the channel,
which lies at the south end of the Pole, which is a sand at the west side of
the channel of Blakeney, go from the first buy to the other and along by
them, until you come within the Haven. This is a tyde-haven, where men do lie
dry at low water. Four leagues to the westwards of Blakeney lies Wels, betwixt
them both lies the foresaid shoale, called the Poll and Pyper, Pol and Piper.
there it is shoale far off at sea. At the west end of this shoale, goes in
the Deep of Wels, the beacons that you must sail in along by, stand all
along by the Pyper. When Hoebrom stands eastsoutheast from you, then you
are to the westwards of the Pyper, thwart of it is good road in 6 fathom Wels
Wells.
lies then southeast from you, and the trees stand then also against the
steeple, then you may sail open into the Haven of Wels, along by the
foresaid beakons.

Of the Depths and Shoales about these places and in what Depths men may see
the land.
Five or six leagues north and by east and northnortheast from the north
Forland or from Margat lies a banck, called Kentish-knock, upon it is three
fathom water. Being by it, you may even see the land from below.

Five leagues northeast from this banck, it is twenty fathom deep.

Northeast and by north from the north Forland nine or ten leagues, and about
east from the Naze, eight leagues into the sea, lies a banck called the
Galloper, of five, six and seven fathom depth.

The westrocks is a stony ground, lying between the Court and Long-sand,
whereupon is no more then two fathom water at a half flood.

Without that sand or Harwitch five leagues from the Naze, it is twenty and
two and twenty fathom deep, being there you may see the land.

Thwart of Orfordnes you may see the land from below, in two and twenty fathom.

Five or six leagues without Leystaffe and Yarmouth southeast and east into
sea, it is 27 and 28 fathom deep, there you may see the land.

Four leagues east and by south from land, without the Holmes of Yarmouth
lies a banck, called the Newsand, which is not deeper then two fathom.

Eastnortheast at least 7 leagues from land thwart of Yarmouth, it is 15
fathom, the ground red gross sand with little round stones, being there you
may even see the land from below.

Thwart of Winterton and Cromer 7 or 8 leagues from the land, it is 18 and 19
fathom deep, and there you may see the land.

Winterton sand lies 4 or 5 leagues from land northeast from Winterton.

What moon makes high water at the places.
At the north Forland a north and south moon makes high water.

Within the Thames a south and by east moon.

Before the Thames, at Harwitch and Orfordnes a southsoutheast moon.

At Leistaff and Yarmouth a southsoutheast moon makes high water.

Without the bancks of Yarmouth, and before Cromer, a southeast Moon makes
full sea.

Betwixt the bancks of Harwitch and the Holmes of Yarmouth the flood falls
south, and the ebb north.

Thwart of the banks of Winterton and Cromer the flood falls southsoutheast,
and the ebb northnorthwest.

Of the Tides and Courses of the streams.
From the north Forland the flood falls to the Recolvers, and over the Brakes
westsouthwest, and west and by south.

Without about Good-win toward Kentish-knock, the flood falls north and by
west, and northnorthwest there comes the flood also against it from the
northwards, and meet one another by the Galloper, with very great rippeling and
noise, (whereof this banck is also called the Galloper) and falls to the
westwards into the sands and channels, and also to the eastwards toward
Flanders.

Betwixt the North Forland and Orfordnesse the stream falls without the
sands south and by east, and southsoutheast.

When you are to the northwards of the Galloper, then you can reckon no ebb,
then that which runs along England to the northwards, the streams fall
there all along the coasts. To the southwards of the Galloper, the ebb goes
to the contrary to the southwards, and the flood to the northwards.

Courses and Distances.
From the north Forland to the north end of the Goodwin the course is south and
by east one great leag. From the north Forland to Kentish Knock northeast and
by north and northnortheast 4 or 5 leagues. From thence to the Orfordnesse
north 11 leagues. From the north Forland to the Gallopper northeast and by
north 9 leagues. From the Gallopper to Orfordnes northnorthwest, 9 leagues.

Tessell eastnortheast 37 leagues. From Yarmouth or Leystaff to Walcheren or the
Wielings southeast, and southeast and by south 32 leagues. From the point of
Cromer or Schield, to the Tessell, the course is east 40 leagues.
Of the heights of these lands.
The north Forland lies in 51 degrees 30 minutes. Orfordnes lies in 52
degrees 14 minutes. Yarmouth lies in 52 degrees 48 minutes.

The eleventh Demonstration, Where in The Coast of England and Schotland are
set forth between Wells and the Island Cocket.
BEtwixt Wels and Bornum lies a banck. You may ride under it in five or six
fathom, at half flood there is upon it no more then two fathom water.

He that will sail into Bornum, Bornum.
must go in at high water, and he must bring the steeple against the
Black-house, and sail so in by the beakons, leaving them on the larboard side.
These are all tyde-havens.

From Bornum to Chapel, Chapel.
the course is westsouthwest, 2 leagues, to the northwards of it lies the
Sonck, which is a sand that falls dry at low water. You may sail about it on
both sides of the Sonck The Sonk
unto Lin.

For to sail into the easter channel of Lin, Easter channel of Lin.
then sail about to the eastwards of the Sonck, and bring that wood of trees,
over the point of Sitsein or Suytson, and Chapel cast from you, then go in
southeast and by south and you shall find the first buy, then in south and by
west and southsouthwest and by little and little more westerly; until you come
about the point, there the buys and beakons shall show you the way.

When you come about the point, then you may run through the sands, into the
norther channel, and sail out again by the same into sea, by the buys and
marks that are thereof. This norther channel lies into sea northeast and
northeast and by east, and is very well buyed and beakoned,

Wester-channell off Lin.
You may also sail into the westwards of the Sonck, to wit, south and by east
in along by it and so run to the first buy, and then from the buy along
by the beakons, unto Lin before the town. When you come from the eastwards,
you may well run through within the Sonck, along by the land, close along
by Chapel, and in south and by west unto the foresaid first buy.

For to sail from Cromer or Blakeney to Bostondeep, Boston deep.
you must go on w. and by n. until you come by the land betwixt the Hommer
and Lagernesse. From the Soecke lies a long banck, called the Flats, The Flats.
n. into sea a league, which at low water falls dry at diverse places. You run
with the foresaid West and by North course, (when you are by Cromer or Blakeney
a little without the land) along without, or to the northwards of this banck,
at high water, you may well go over it, the ground on the east side goes up
flat and plain, run boldly to it without fear, until you come in four or
three fathom, he that uses his lead can take no hurt of it, but on the inner
side, that is, on the west side, it is very steep, so soon as you be over the
shoalest, you shall get suddenly deep water, and good sand ground, under it or
within it, it is good riding for easterly winds.

For to sail into Boston deep, For to sail into Boston deep.
through within the Knock or Elle-knock, you must keep the sounding of the
shore in four or five fathom, so long until that the point of Lagernesse be
westnorthwest from you. Betwixt the shore and Elle-knock Elleknock
remains at low water, five fathom in the midst of the channel, but
Elle-knock falls dry at low water. When as Lagernesse is westnorthwest from
you, then go on southeast, through betwixt Elle-knock and the shoale, (which
shoots off from the shore to the westwards of Lagernesse) until that you
get again depth off six or seven fathom, in this going over remains at low
water, no more then two fathom, but it flows there about three fathom up and
down. Being over it, then go on southwest along betwixt Longsand Longsand
and the shoale, which lies off from the shore, there it is deep betwixt
them both 9 and 10 fathom, you may sound both sides, (as well the shoale which
lies off from the land, as Longsand) in five fathom, but the flats is somewhat
steeper then Longsand.

For to sail without Elle-knock into Bostons deep, coming (as is before
said) to the west land, you must look out for the two steeples of Ingoldmills,
Ingoldmills.
standing somewhat to the northwards of Lagernesse, bring them one in the
other, and then they shall stand about northnorthwest from you, keep them one
in the other, and go on southsoutheast, until that the trees upon the point
be by west Lagernesse, come without the point of Lagernesse, and then you
run through betwixt Elle-knock and Dogshead, Dogshead.
(that is a shoale without Elle-knock when the aforesaid trees come a
handspikes length past, or to the eastwards of the point of Lagernesse, then
go on southwest, and then you run right into the deep, betwixt Elleknock
and Longsand, and so you shall find betwixt Elleknock, and the point of
Longsand five fathom depth, being past Elleknock, it will be eight nine and ten
fathom deep.

If you will sail out of the sea into Boston deep, and not along by the
land, as is before said, then bring the foresaid trees a handspikes length
without the point of Lagernesse, which shall then stand from you about
westsouthwest, sail in so right with them, until that the high land within
Lagernesse or Winfleet begin to come even without the point of Lagernesse,
which shall then be from you somewhat more northerly then west, then you are
within the point of Longsand. Or else there stand three little houses on the
sea side, about half ways betwixt Lagernesse, and Ingoldmils, when they come
to be northwest from you, and those foresaid trees without the point, then you
are also within the point of Longsand, go in then southwest betwixt Elleknock
and Longsand, as aforesaid. Alittle past Lagernesse lies a shoale or plate
about the midst in the fareway, but nearest Longsand when the trees upon the
point to the southwards of Winfleet come in the second valley of the high land
within Winfleet, then you are right thwart of this shoale, edge therefore to one
side or other, rather toward the shoale, there is widest, keep boldly the
sounding of the shoale, and run southwest along by it, until that the
steeple of Boston come over the steeple of Butterwyke, Butterwyke.
that is also a flat steeple, but smaller then that of Boston standing in a
wood of trees, thwart of it runs the shoale somewhat off with a point, being
past it, go on westsouthwest all along by the foresaid showld, until that
the great steeple of Boston come over the second mill, there it is good
anchoring by the west shore in five fathom at low water. He that comes there
at low water, must anchor and stay for the tide until half flood, before that
you may not sail further in from thence, and then you shall not also find more
then two fathom upon the shoalest.

From thence the Deep lies in along by the beakons about south to the third
beakon, being past that westsouthwest, and then by little and little, more
westerly and northerly, but run all along by the beakons, leaving them on the
starboard side, at last on north into the River.

Upon the point of the river stands a house, which is a sheephouse, before
that you come by it, it seems as if there were no opening, by reason that it
is al even green land, run in by it, all along by the land, being past it,
the River does open it self. Being come within the points you must run in
betwixt two dikes, a league up until you come before the town, in the river
it is at half flood every where deep enough. When as that you come a little
within the houses of the town on the larboardside, there you must let fall
your anchor and stay until that the water begin to fall, then you shall have
flood enough for to drive to the Kay, there you make fast with one cable, it
does not begin to be ebb there, before that water be fallen three foot.

An east and west Moon makes in Boston deep the highest water, but before
the town an east and by south and eastsoutheast moon. He that comes from
Boston, and will sail out at the deep with a high water, let him look out for
the foresaid high land within Lagernes, when that comes behind the point of
Lagernes, then he may boldly set his course whether he desires to be, either
to the eastwards, northeastwards, or northwards, there is nothing then that can
hurt him.

From Lagernesse to the Hommer it is about seven leagues, most north, betwixt
them both, about a league to the southwards of the Hommer lies a place called
Saltfleet haven, Plate by Saltfleet haven.
a little to the northwards of a sharp steeple called Wilgrip. Thwart of that
foresaid Saltfleet haven, about an English mile from the shore lies a banck
or Sandplate, not very great, which at low water falls almost dry, you must
run about without it, and leave it lying toward the land from you, but yet
for need you may also sail through within it.

For to sail into the Humber For to sail into the Humber.
coming from the northwards, you must sail along by the shore, and run
about by the n. point, but coming by the point you must keep somewhat off
from the shore in 4 or 5 fathom, for to avoid a little tail, which lies off
from the point, being about it, run to the little Island, which lies a
little by west that foresaid north point.

If coming from the southwards you desire to sail to the Humber, then bring
the Pawle Steeple (which is a high sharp steeple standing on the North side of
the Humber) a little by south the North point of the Humber, or over that
foresaid little Island, and sail so right in with it, until that you come by
that little Island, being come by it, leave it on the starboard side and run in
close by it, for to avoid a great Sand called the Bull, which lies off from the
South shore almost unto that little Island. When that you come within that
little Island, then bring the two beakons (which stand upon that little Island)
one in the other, keep them so standing, Road before Grimsby.
and sail so on to the westwards toward Grimsby, you leave the Buy upon the
Bull lying then on the larboard side, and run along to the northwards of it: In
this faireway it is seven and eight fathom deep. You may not come nearer the
Bull then in six fathom. Before Grimsby you may anchor in three or four
fathom at low water, it flows there at least three fathom up and down, a
westsouthwest and eastnortheast Moon makes before the Humber the highest
water. Within the foresaid Island at the north point of the Humber, you may
anchor in three or four fathom: There lie commonly Ships that are bound out,
and tarry for the Wind.

From Grimsby in along to Hull, the course is west northwest to the end of
the Banck or ballast Plate, which you must leave lying on the north side. On
the south side lies also a little plate, there stands commonly a Beakon upon
it, that you must leave on the Larboard side, and run along to the Northwards
of it, being past it, you may run along by the South shore in 3 fathom. The
fareway there is four, five, and six, and thwart of the foresaid Beakon eight
and ten fathom. When you come to the end of the Bank, you must edge up to
the Westwards about by the point on the South side, but there runs off a
Flat which you must avoid. Being a little about that point you shall see the
Town of Hull, lie before you, there you may anchor before it in six, seven,
or eight fathom: An east and west Moon makes full sea before Hull. He that
will anchor upon the ballast plate, let him bring the flat steeple which
stands a little to the northwards or the eastwards of Hull to the high point
of Pawl, and keep them so standing until that he come to the plate, there it
is best for to anchor upon it.

From the North point of the Humber called Spurn head to Flambrough head,
Flambrough head.
the course is northnorthwest nine or ten leagues, betwixt them it is shoale
water of six, seven, and eight fathom deep. Flambrough head has many white
spots and Chalk Hills, especially upon the north side toward Fyley. Flambrough
has a Head or Piere. A league to the westwards of it on the south side lies a
little Town called Burlington, Burlington.
which has also a Piere. You may anchor there in the Baye in six or seven
fathom.

Three leagues by west Flambrough head lies Fyley, Fyley.
in a round baye to the southwardes of a point that lies out, which has a
Pier or Head, where you may lie within it, but it falls there dry at low
water.

Without the head of Fyley lies a rock under water, called Fyley bridge, Fyley
bridge.
betwixt it and the Pier you may well lie a flote with a ship of an hundred
lasts, in five fathom at low water, and have shelter for a northeast and east
wind.

From the point of Fyley to Scharbrough it is northwest two leagues.
Scharbrough Scharbrough.
has 2 Pieres or Heads, where you may run within them at high water from the
southwardes, but at low water it falls there also dry. Men come in there
from the southwards.

From Scharbrough the coast lies along by Robbinhoods bay, Robbinhoods bay
until before Whidbye, most northwest, but past Whidbie the land falls in
westnorthwest, and by little and little more westerly unto the Tees.

Robbenhoods bay is a good road for a southsouthwest and west wind, there men
lie in seven or eight fathom.

Whidby Whidby.
is a tide haven, which falls dry at low water, at the east side of the
haven runs off a riffe of rocks, where of you must take heed. For to sail
in there, you must run in betwixt the two beakons, until that you come in
betwixt the two lands, and anchor there.

From Whidbie to the Teese the coast lies most westnorthwest, and west and by
north, about seven leagues, betwixt both lie Huntley foot and Redcliffe.
Huntley Huntleyfoot.
foot is a high hill, lying on the sea side, about 4 leagues to the eastwardes
of the Tees. Redcliffe Redcliffe.
lies about half ways betwixt Huntleyfoote and the Tees, it is a cliffe of
such very redd earth, that when the sun does shine against it, it is to see
to like redd cloth these two are very good marks, for to know this coast by.

Close to the southwardes of the mouth of the Teese lie three Riffes, which lie
about a half league eastnortheast into sea, which are very foul and stony,
and fall dry at low water, upon the north side they are very, flatt, so that
you may sound about by them, in five, six and seven fathom, but on the south
side are so steep that coming near them, and sounding in thirteen and
fourteen fathom, you should be upon them, before you should be able to heave
the lead the second time.

A league and half to the northwards of the Teese lies Hartlepoole, upon a
point that lies out almost like an Island. For to go in there you must run
into a bight to the southwards of the town with in a head, until you come
against the town, there you shall lie dry at low water.

About half ways betwixt Hartlepoole Hartlepoole.
and the Teese, runs off also a riffe of rocks thwart from the shore a good
ways into sea, come no nearer in then, 5 or 6 fathom. There stands a mill to
the northwards of the town Hartlepoole, if you keep that to the west side of
the town Hartlepoole, then you cannot sail upon that foresaid riff, but if you
bring the foresaid mill a little to the westwards from the town, so that you
may plainly see through be^wixt the mill and the town, then you shall not
fail to sail upon that riffe.

For to sail into the Tees.
For to sail into Teese coming from the northwardes, you must observe these
marks following. A good ways to the northwardes off Hartlepoole, a little to
the southwardes of Sonderland, and a little within the land lie upon the high
land, two hommocks close one to the other, very easy to be known, off fashion
like women's breasts, called the Paps, The Paps.
keep these 2 hommocks even without the point of Hartlepoole, which shall then
stand from you northwest and by north, and sail so on to the southwardes, and
you shall fall before the Tees, and shall not sail to near the sands that lie
out before the mouth of the Tees, and lie off about a half league into sea.

On both sides, as well on the north side, as the south side of the Tees stand
2 little white houses for fire beacons: If you come from the northwardes and
get sight off them, then bring first the 2 southermost one in the other, which
shall then stand from you south and by east, sail right in with them, until
that the other 2 which stand on the north side of the Teese, come also one in
the other, then leave them on the south side, and sail in right with them that
stand on the north side, and so you shall run in amidst the channel, there
is upon the bar, or shoalest, at low water no more then five foot, but it
flows there with a common tide, at least 2 fathom up and down. A southwest
moon makes there full sea. If when you come from the southwardes, you will
sail into the Teese, then bring the innermost of the 2 firebeakons (which
stand on the north side) at least a handspikes length, or the length off a
capstane bar, to the northwardes of the other, and run so westwardes
toward them, until that the two firebeakons on the south side are one in the
other, then sail in right with them, as has been said, until that the 2
firebeakons on the north side come one in the other: when you have them one the
other, run in right with them, until that you come by the north shore, and
then close along by it.

When as that you come so far in past the first fire beakon, to wete, that
you may see Hartlepoole betwixt the 2 firebeakons, there you may anchor in
three, 4, or five fathom, or when Hartlepoole comes betwixt the foresaid
firebeakons, then go southsouthwest, until that you come by the south shore
there it is also good anchoring. Further it is pilots water unto Stockton, for
there within, the deepes do shifte oftentimes, and that in short time, 3, 4,
or 5 times in a summer.

He that will sail in there with northerly winds, and a flood, must reckon
well his tides, for the floude falls strong to the southwardes over the
grounds, and should thereby be lightly carried behind the bank to the
southwardes off the buy, which lies upon the point of the banck.

Besides this foresaid channel there runs yet another channel through the
grounds, which lie off from the north point of the Tees. For to sail in to the
newe-channell.
For to sail in there, you must take mark of the two high lands within the
land, to the southwardes of the Tees, bring them within a handspikes length one
to the other, or bring the Paps to the west side of Harlenope, then shall also
a foresaid two high lands come within a handspikes length near one to the
other sail in right with them, and so you shall run right into that new
channel, along through that a foresaid sand, and come against the buy
(upon the sands, on the south side off the Deep) again in the right
farewaye. When that you get again deeper water, or have the two fire-beakons on
the north side one in the other, then go in toward them, and further as has
been before said.

About seven leagues to the northwardes of the Tees lies the river off
Sonderland, a little to the northwardes off the Paps, which are very good
marks for to know the land by there abouts. When the Paps are southsouthwest
from you, and that you are about an English mile from the land, then you are
right before the river of Sonderland, the ground is there abouts indifferent
clean, but somewhat stony, you may anchor there in 4 or 5, and 6 fathom. On
both sides, as well on the north point, as the south point of the River it is
stony. On the north point stands a beakon in the water, there you must
run in, within a little ships length along by it, being past that you
shall get deeper water, to with, a fathom and a half, and 2 fathom at low
water, but upon the bar remains no more then three foot. With a common
spring and high water there is about 2 fathom and a half, or a little more.

After this aforesaid first depth of a fathom and a half or two fathom, you
shall meet again with a stony floor, about three ships lenghts broad, upon
it is at high water about 11 or 12 foot deep, according as the tides shall
run: being over there, it is again deeper. A little past that is a narrow
place, where a long ship shall scarce be able to wend, within it, it is wide
enough, and very where good anchor ground.

From the Tees to Tinmouth the course is northnorthwest 8 or 9 leagues. Two
leagues to the southwards of Tinmouth lies the point of Sonderland, Sonderland.
but close to the southwards of Tinmouth goes in the River of New Castle. From
the point of Tinmouth shoots off a ledge of rocks, you must sail in by it,
leaving it on the starboard side. The marks for to sail into this River are
two firetowers or firebeakons, which stand upon the north shore, bring them
one in the other, or the innermost (that is the highest) a little to the
northwards of the outermost or lowest, and sail so right in, along by the
aforesaid ledge of rocks on the north side, and so you shall have upon the
shoalest two fathom at half flood, a southwest moon makes there full sea.
The south shore is flat you may lead it in there with the sounding pole, for
ships, that go not deep, in ten foot at half floude. When you come within,
run all along by the north shore, until past the little town Sheels,
edge then over to the other shore, until you come through the crooked reach,
there the river lies up again a little to the n. wards, and then to the
southwards to Hawkes-bill, and about by it to the town New Castle.

Seven or 8 leagues to the northwards of Tinmouth lies the Cock Island,
betwixt them both about half ways lies a River called Bly, Bly.
where the French men do much sail to fetch coal. From the north point of
this river runs off a ledge of rocks a great shot of a cast-peece; about
southeast into the sea, but the south side, and the coast to the southwards of
it, is very clean and sand-strand. Upon the south point stand two beakons: If
you will sail in there, bring them one in the other, and sail right in with
them, and then you can take no hurt of the foresaid ledge or riffe of the north
point. When that you come by or thwart of the outermost of the 2 foresaid
beakons, you shall see there by it another smaller beakon, that stands upon a
little ledge off rocks, that shoots off from the south point, leave that on
the larboard side, and run in along close about northwards of it. The
foresaid ledge of Rocks on the north side remains at high water (a good
ways from the land, and also at a spring-tyde) above water, within it is a
bight, there it is good lying for a north or northeast wind, and there
remains at low water two fathom depth. In the mouth of the River it is with
an ordinary tide and high water about two fathom deep, or somewhat more, and it
flows there two fathom up and down, so that at low water it falls almost
altogether dry.

The Cocket Island, Cocket Island.
is a very little Island, and not high it lies about a half league from the
land, you may come to anchor in it for an east, south, and southeast wind, but
the wind coming to the northwards of the east, makes there a bad road, for
you must lie betwixt the Island and the maine land where you have no shelter
for a north wind. On the south side of the Island the ground is foul, and a
little to the southwards of the Island, runs off a foul ledge of rocks from
the shore, until thwart or past the Island. He that comes from the
southwards, must keep the Coast of Bambrough without the Island, or else he
should not fail to sail upon the point of that foresaid ledge.

Betwixt that ledge and the Island it is also very narrow, so that a man
standing at low water mark upon the rocks of this ledge, should almost be
able to cast with a stone unto the Island. For to sail in there, take heed
unto these marcks here after described: there stands a house upon the sea
side, which is a Salt kettel, and also a Castle somewhat further in within the
land, which does show it self high enough, bring them one in the other, and
then they shall stand somewhat more northerly then west from you, and run so
right in with them, and so you shall run in right amidst the channel betwixt
both, being come within, edge up behind the Island, and anchor there in five
or six fathom.

About this Island there run also many more diverse little Rivers in to the
land, but they fall most dry at low water.

Of the Depths and shoales about these places, and in what Depths men may see
the land.
Thwart of Winterton and Cromer, seven or eight leagues from land, it is
eighteen and nineteen fathom deep, and there you may see the land. Northeast
and northeast and by north from Cromer lies a Bancke, whereupon remains at
half flood no more water, then 4 fathom, from thence you may see the land
indifferent well.

North and by east from Blackeney lies a bancke, whereupon remains at half
flood no more water then five fathom. In eighteen fathom thereabouts you may
see the land. From thence to the point of Chapel it is all shoaly.

About northnorthwest and north and by west from Winterton-sand lies the bank
before Cromer 5 leagues without the coast.

To the northwards of the Humber of Hull, you may see the land in 25 fathom.

Flambrough-head men may see in five and thirty fathom.

Scharbrough men may see from below in five and forty fathom.

Of the Tides and Courses of the streams, about these foresaid places.
Before Crommer a southeast Moon makes high water.

At Blackeney, Wels, Bornum and Lyn, an east and west Moon.

Before the Humber of Hull an eastnortheast and westsouthwest Moon.

From Blackeney to Flambrough-head, the flood falls southeast and the ebb
northwest.

At Flambrough and Fyley, in the Peer a westsouthwest moon makes full sea.

At Scharbrough and Robbinhoods-baye a southwest and northeast moon.

In the Tees and at Hartlepoole also a southwest and northeast moon.

Before the River of Newcastle a southwest and northeast moon makes also the
highest water.

Thwart of Flambroug-head, Scharbrough, the Teese, and also thwart of the river
of Newcastle, the flood falls southeast, and the ebb northwest.

To the northwards of the Tees, the flood falls southsoutheast along the
land, and from the Tees to Scharbrough southeast and by east.

How these lands do lie one from the other, and from other lands.
From Crommer to Blackeney westnorthwest 3 or 4 leag. From Blackeney to Bornum

The twelfth Demonstration, In which The east side of Scotland, is showed, from
the Island Cocket and Orcaneis.
FRom the Cocket Islands to the Staples Staples.
the course is northnorthwest and north and by w. 8 or 9 leagues. The Staples,
they are high Islands and rocks right to the eastwards of Bambroug, lying at
least 3 leagues from the land northeast into sea, a little to the northwards of
them lies the Holy Island. Holy Island.
To the southwards or the westwards of the Holy Island is a baye, where you
may lie landlockt almost for all winds, against the Castle is the best road:
you may also run in there from the southwards, through betwixt the Staples and
the maine land.

Betwixt the Staples and Holy Island lie two suncken Rocks, which at low water
come very near even with the water, the westermost toward the Holy Island,
is called the Goldstone, Goldstone Plough.
the eastermost by the staples, is called the Plough. For to avoid them when
you will sail through betwixt the Staples and the Holy Island, whether you
come from the Southwards or the Northwards, then bring the Steeple of
Teustenbrough over the Castle of Bambrough and keep them so standing, and then
you shall run through betwixt them both, this channel lies so through
northeast and southwest. From the outermost end of the Staples to S. Abbens
head, S. Abbens head.
the course is northwest 8 or 9 leagues.

From Holy Island to S. Abbens head it is northnorthwest 7 or 8 leagues.

To the northwards of S. Abbens-head men do run in unto Lies and to
Edenbrough in Scotland.

S. Abbens head and the Island the Bas lie east and west 4 leagues assunder.
The Island May and S. Abbens head northwest and southeast 4 great leagues. May
and Bas lie one from the other southwest and by west and northeast and by east
three leagues and a half. The Bas The Bas.
is a high round Rock clean round about, which you may sail along by on
both sides. Betwixt the rock and the south shore it is ten and twelve fathom
deep, but the common fair way is along to the northwards of it. Between S.
Abbens head and the Bas it is most part a clean Coast, but without anchor
ground. The Island May Island May.
is greater then the Bas, and also clean round about, except on the east side,
there it is foul.

From S. Abbens head along to the northwest of the Bas, the course is west
and by north and west northwest four leagues, and from by north the Bas to the
Island Inchkieth Inchkieth.
west and west and by north about five leagues. Between the Bas and Inchkieth
by the s. shore lie many Rocks* little Islands and foul grounds, where at
diverse places is road, but are not to be used, but by them which are there
very well acquainted. Inchkieth and Island May lie s. w. and by w. and n. e.
and by e. 7 great leagues asunder. Inchkieth is somewhat a long small Island, a
league to the northwards of it lies an out point on the north coast called
Kingornesse, Kingornesse.
before it and about it lie some little Rocks under water but a little to the
eastwards of the eastwards of the point is good anchor ground and road for
westerly winds. Between that point and the Island May, or the point of Fifsnes
on the north shore lie diverse little Havens, where of some of them do also
yield out coals, but are little or nothing used by the Hollanders. On both
sides of Inchkieth is good ground, and good lying as well for westerly as
easterly winds.

From Inchkieth to Lies it is southeast a league. Before Lies Lies.
about half an English mile from the shore lies a Rock upon which stands a
Mast (with a cross or some other thing of wood upon the top of it) for a
beakon. At high water the Sea flows over it, and at low water it falls dry.
With a spring tide at low water men may go on foot to it. From the east side of
that Rock lies off a Riffe almost unto Inchkieth. You may also run through to
the southwards of Inckieth betwixt that foresaid Riffe and the south shore,
but is not to be done, but by them which are there exceeding well acquainted:
There is altogether full of Rocks and foul grounds. When as you sail in to
the northwards of Inchkieth you must leave the foresaid Mast on the larboard
side, and run about to the northwards of it, and then toward the south shore,
and anchor about half an English Mile by west Lies, and also half an English
Mile from the shore, in 6, 7, or 8 fathom. Lies the Haven Edenbrough are tide
Havens which fall dry at low water.

From Lies to Queens Ferrie Queens Ferrie.
there lie on both sides many Rocks, some above and some under water. In the
Narrow before Queens Ferrie lies a little Island called Inchgarve which you
must run along to the northwards of, on the south side it is with a Stone
bancke (where men may go over at low water) fast to the main Land, along to
the northwards of it, it is clean and deep. Within that little Island lie
Caryn and other places more where men do lade Coals.

Under the east side of the point to the northwardes of Queens Ferrie is good
road in 2, 3, or 4 fathom, according as you lie far from the shore.

A league north from the Island May lies the point of Fifsnes, Fifsnes.
lying from S. Abbens head northwest and by north 4 great leagues. From thence
to Dondee it is northnorthwest five leagues. Dondee Dondee.
is a good Haven which goes in betwixt 2 high Lands, being within men do
anchor before the Town. Farther in upon the River lies another Town called
S. John's, S. John's.
which you may go up to at high water.

Between the point of Fifsnes and Dondee lies also the Baye of S. Andrews,
S. Andrews.
there is all over good anchor ground. Four great leagues north and by e. from
the point of Fifsnes, and northeast from S. Andrews lies a great Rock called
the Inchkap, Inchkap.
which the Sea flows over at high water, and at low water it falls so dry,
that the Fishermen go upon it.

Seven leagues to the northwards of Dondee lies Monrosse, Monrosse
a good Haven, First you must sail in there amidst the channel, and edge up
to the northwards and anchor before the Town.

Over against Monrosse lie three Hommocks which shoot out from the other land,
bring the middlemost and the houses upon the strand together, then shall you
find the middle of the fareway, on both sides of the havens mouth lies a blind
cliffe.

Betwixt Dondee and Monrosse lies an out point called Redhead, Redhead.
about a great League to the Southwards of Monrosse. There stands a high
Tower upon the Land called Abrot.

From Monrosse to Stone Baye Stone-Bay.
or De Torre, the course is northeast and by North four leagues. This is a
deep bay and a good Have^ for those that are bound to the southwardes, where
men may lie Land-lockt with many Ships.

Three leagues to the northwards of it lies Aberdyn: Aberdyn.
In this Havens mouth it is three fathom deep. The west point is somewhat foul,
therefore you must run in by the east land, until you come within the Haven,
and anchor before the Town in four or five Fathom. Up to the northwardes is a
great Bay, but is shoale on both sides. There goes through a little Creek
toward old Aberdyn, which is an old ruinous Town.

From Aberdyn to Boeckenes Boeckenes.
the course is northnortheast twelve or thirteen leagues. Betwixt them both
lies a tide Haven. Boeckenes is a high Hill and lies upon the south side of
the point. To the northwards of Boeckenes lies a Bay as a Haven called Spy Spy.
or Spilaert and right before the shore lies a sand called Ruttenbrugh which
you must take great care thereof as you come from the northwards. From thence
the land lies in west and west southwest unto the Haven of Rosse or Luvernes.

To the northwards of Rosse lies an out point called Cape Tarbate, C. Tarba.
right in the bottom of the Baye betwixt Catenes and Boeckenes, distandet from
Boeckenes about 19 or 20 leagues. In this bay are many havens and sounds,
which are deep enough for to come into with great ships. It is from thence to
Catenes 14 leagues northeast and by north Catenes lies from Boeckenes
northwest and northwest and by north 20, 21, or 22 leagues. From Boeckenes unto
the outermost Orckanes it is north and by west and northnorthwest two and
thirty or three and thirty leagues.

The Orkeneys are one and thirty Islands in number, first Wayets or Elhoy,
which lies next to Scotland, five leagues about the point. About
northnortheast off from the point of Catenes lie two little Islands Pits and
Pichlandscare there you may run through to the westwards betwixt Elhoey and
Scotland.

To the northwardes of them lies an Island called Heynda, with an other Island
called Platta, to the northwardes off Platta lies Mayland or Ponoma. On the
north side of this great Island are all the havens where the ships come to.

Upon the east side of this great Island lies another Island called Kabunsa,
to the northwards of it lies an other Island at the northeast point of the
great Island, you may also run through there toward Papewester, and leave
Sand a lying on the starboard side.

Close to Papewester lies Fara, to the southwards of it is Sirza. To the
eastwards of Sirza and Fara lie two Islands, in the midst of all these
Islands, called Eeda and Chapnoza.

Sanda lies to the northwards of al these Islands, but Papa and Stronza lie to
the southwards of Sanda.

To the eastwardes of Stronsa lies an Island called Cuistella, that is the
eastermost Island of all, the northermost is called Ronalze or Northernase.

Eleven or twelve leagues northwest from the great Island lie two rocks, the
one under water and the other above water, he that comes from the westwards,
must take heed of them.

On these coasts betwixt Tinmouth and S. Abbens-head a southwest and northeast
moon makes high water.

At Lies in the Haven a southwest and by w. moon makes full sea.

The flood falls along these coasts southsoutheast and the ebb

northeast moon.

From Boeckenesse, the flood falls south along the coast toward Lies, and
the ebb north to the contrary.

In this fareway it is deep 40, 50, and 60 fathom, in 45, 50, fathom, you may
see the land. In this fareway in the summer the first Herrings are caught.

How these Lands do show themselves at Sea.
Thus shows Boeckenes when you sail along by it.
In this form shows the land Catenes, when you sail along by it.
Thus shows the northeast point of Orkenes when you sail along by it.
Thus shows the land of Scotland to the northwards Aberdyne, when you sail

The thirteenth Demonstration, Where in Are set forth the Coast of Fayre-hill,
Hitland, and the Islands thereabouts as also the Islands of Fero, and some
Islands behind the northwest Corner of Scotland.
THe Island Fairhill Fairhill.
lies from the east point of the Orcanais northeast, and from Boeckenesse
north and by west about seven and thirty leag.

On the west side of Fairhill is at some places foul ground, but upon the
southeast side is good anchor ground, there you may anchor every where but
there stretches a riffe on the east side of the shore off southeast two
leagues in to sea.

Fulo.
Fulo lies from Fairehill northwest and by north ten leagues, betwixt them
both lies the southermost point off Hitland, lying from Fairehill
northnortheast 7 or 8 leagues, and from Fulo east and by south, 4 leagues.

The southwest coast of Hitland, (to wit from the southermost point to the
northwest point) lies northwest and by north eight or nine leagues. On the
same southwest side, over against the Island Fulo lies a Sand-bay, where men
may anchor, but on the east side of this Bay, it is somewhat foul. From that
northwest or west point off to the north end, the land of Hitland lies
northeast by north, and southwest and by south, twenty or one and twenty
leagues.

Two leagues to the northwards of the foresaid west point lies the Haven of S.
Magnus, S. Magnus.
which is a broad Sound, within it is good anchor ground in sixteen or
seventeen fathom depth, according as you shall be far within the land. On the
north side lies a high rock, where you must run in to the southwards of. And
on the south side lies two or three rocks, which you must leave on the
starboard side, when you sail in there.

Even to the eastwards about the s. point of Hitland, lies a fair Sand-bay,
where you may anchor in twelve or thirteen fathom, from thence to Hanglip, the
course is northeast somewhat easterly 8 or 9 leagues.

Betwixt Hanglip Hanglip.
and the south point lies an Island, which you may sail about on both sides,
within it lies Hambrough Haven, Hambrough haven.
or the Scottish Haven which is a lade place for the Hamburgers and Scots. This
Haven is also called Bremer Haven. There lies also a high steep point to the
southwards of Hanglip, to the southwards of it men do run into Broad-sound,
Broad-sound.
the chiefest Haven of all Hitland, which is deep and has clean ground,
there men do lie landlockt for all winds.

From the Broad Sound lies a Sound in along to the northwards, through the
land, which comes out again into the sound to the northwards, and so makes
an Island of the land whereupon the high hill Hanglip lies. When as you will
sail in there from the northwards, that is to the northwards of Hanglip, you
must run in nearest by the south shore, and edge to it betimes. In this
channel betwixt both lands lie two Islands or rocks, the greatest lies
nearest the north shore, and the smallest nearest the south shore, betwixt
them both lies also a suncken rock, which at low water is uncovered, and at
high water you may know it by the breaking upon it. When as you will sail in
here, you must leave the foresaid greatest Rock, with the suncken rock, on the
starboard side, and the smallest rock on the larboard side, there is upon the
shoalest three fathom and a half water.

Within this haven lie also two havens at the north point, which lie into the
land, where is good lying.

When as you will sail from this foresaid haven through within unto the
Broad-sound, you shall meet, scarce half ways with a rock, from which lies
off a risse toward the west shore thwart of it you must run close along
by the west shore, for to avoid that riffe.

To the northwards of Hanglip* the land of Hitland lies north, north and by
east, and northnortheast, at least north, and at some places you may sail in
through Hitland, especially to the northwards of Walsoeu, where a fair broad
Sound lies northwest through, there is good anchor ground to find at some
places, for these that are there acquainted. From Hanglip to the northeast
point of Hitland, the course is northnortheast ten leagues, there lie some
outrocks called the Outschares. Outscares
From thence along to the north point of Hitland, the course is north about 4
leagues.

A little about the east point goes in a fair haven, called Bloem-sound,
Bloem-sound.
lying in southwest. On the west side lies a long rock, you must sail into
the eastwards of it, and anchor a little within the Haven, it is there within
all clean sand ground, and good lying. Bloem-sound lies in first (as has
been said) southsouthwest afterward south and south and by east, on both sides
is good anchor ground, there you may sail altogether through, and come out
again through Jelle-sound into sea, about the Island Fero.

Names of the Islands of Fero.
The greatest and chiefest Islands of Fero are 12, in number, as Suydro, Sando,
Moggenes, Wage, Stromo, Ostro, Calso, Cuno, Bordo, Wydro, Swyno and Fulo.

The little Islands of Fero are ten, as Littledymen, Stoerdymen, Schuyvo,
Dalsfles, Hesden, Trallo Colster, Moggensholme, the Monck, and the Bishop.
Besides these there are yet some rocks and little Islands, to seven or eight in
number.

The southermost great Island called Suydro, Suydro.
lies most southeast and northwest, about seven or eight leagues. At the
southeast end of this Island lies a high rock, called the Monck, or Sambie,
after the name of the first or southermost haven in Suydro. Betwixt the Monck
Monck Samby.
and the south^^st end of the Island Suydro, is a race or Well, which men must
avoid especially with spring tides.

Upon the west side of the Island Suydro are no havens for to save any ships
in, but it is altogether high steep land. On the North side are maine havens,
where men may sail into and save ships, as Sommersound or Hest, Hofwycke.
Vrobie, Quaelbie or Rane, all broad sounds or havens, a country man or Pilot
can bring you in there every where to your desire.

From the Northwest end Suydro to Moggensholme, Moggenes-holm.
the westermost and outermost Island of Fero, the course is northwest and by
north, and northnorthwest about eight leagues.

At the east end of Moggenesholme lies Moggenes, Mogenes Wage.
to the eastwards of it lies the Island Waghe, and to the eastwards of Waghe
goes in a fair Sound from the southwards off from the Island Sando about
Hesten and the Island Colster, for you may run in about these Islands on both
sides, and leave the great Island Stromo on the east side, and so come into
Waghe. In the midst of the Sound of Waghe, goes up a haven to the eastwards
into the great Island Stromo, there in you may anchor in ten or twelve fathom,
but the Sound is at least twenty fathom deep.

Moggenes and the northeast end Fero lie eastnortheast or a little more
northerlye, and westsouthwest about fifteen leagues assunder. Betwixt them
both lie ten Islands, and betwixt each Island, is a fair broad and deep
Sound where of the fourth off from Moggenes is called Somsound. Somsound.
All these Sounds lie most northnorthwest and southsoutheast through the land,
and upon all these Islands stand Churches, except upon Ostra, which never the
less is a great Island.

From the southeast end of Suydro to Scalhead, Scalhead.
or the southeast end of the Island Sando, the course is north and by west
about five leagues. Betwixt Suydro and Sando lie the little Islands, Little
Dymen, Little Dymen.
Stoer Dymen, Stoer Dymen.
Schavo and Dalsfles.

From Schalhead until within the Island Mulso (lying before Stromo) the course
is north and by west four leagues, there you may every where anchor, where you
will in twenty, thirty or forty fathom. If any man coming in out of the
sea, desires to see a good road or haven under the Islands of Fero, he shall
keep that middlemost great Island Stromo northwest and northwest and by west
from him, and then he shall see upon the midst of the Island Stromo a high
steep hill called Schellinck, which he must sail right in with, and so he
shall meet with that foresaid Island Mulso, a low Island, which you may sail
about on both sides, but it is best for to run in there at the south, under
this Island is all over good anchor ground. Right over against this Island, on
the great Island, lies Torshaven, the chiefest haven of Fero, where all the
trade of merchandise is.

From Torshaven Torshave^
or the Island Mulso to the northeast end of Fero the course is northeast, and
northeast and by east about twelve or thirteen leagues, betwixt them both lie
seven Islands, and betwixt each Island (as has been said) goes a broad Sound
through the land, lying through about northwest a broad through the land, lying
northnorthwest. The north end of Fero is about four leagues broad, and lies
northwest and southeast, and is called Fulo, thwart of it lies the Bishop.

He that desires to sail off from Mulso into Somsound, let him go on
northeast and by north three leag. Fulo.
unto the point of Bordenes, then up northwest off from Bordenes, and then he
shall epsy a Church upon the Island Calso, which he must leave on the
starboard side, The Bishop.
and go in along westnorthwest until he come into the Bight of the Island
Ostro, and anchor there in seventeene or eighteen fathom.

These Islands of Fero lie in a triangle, it is from the southeast end of
Suydro to Fulo, or the north end of Fero northnortheast and southsouthwest 21
leagues a sunder.

From Scotland westwards and to the northwards of Ireland, lie many Islands,
whereof we shall here describe some, with so much perfection, as thereof is yet
known.

The names of the principal Islands Names of the Islands.
lying there are these: Areu, Ila, Jona, Mulla, Bragedull, Hun, Lewis S.
Patricius, S. Maria, S. Colane, S. Petous, Epth, and S. Kilda, these are the
greatest. There are yet some small Islands: as Rona, Ghent, Trauta, Fladde,
Grand Melul, Petit Melul, Stalpan, Cannay, Rum, Egghe, Mule, Cut,
Carndenbrough, Gronsay, S. Karbo, Lismont, Swynoy, Machare, Gegay, Caray, and
Navarsay. All these Islands do lie and belong under Scotland, and are those
which by the Cosmographers are called Insulae Hebrides.

The Island Bar or Rona Bar or Rona.
is the northermost Island lying behind Scotland, and lies from Fulo about
westsouthwest 37 or 38 leagues, it lies by two other little Islands about a
great league one from the other.

The Islands of Lewis lie from Rona southwest distant sixteen or seventeen
leagues, and from the north end of Lewis to S. Kilda, it is southwest and by
west, 16 leagues.

On the east side of S. Kilda is a good road for a west and northwest wind.
This Island lies by the other little Island where of the two are not very
great, upon that which lies to the westwards, you may see some houses stand,
and these two little Islands lie ten leag. to the westwards of the great
Island of Lewis. Upon the coast of Lewis lie also two rows of great rocks,
like as if they where little Islands, lying one from the other south and north
somewhat easterly about 7 or 8 leagues.

The southermost lie by 3 little Islands, but the northermost lie by eight
small little Islands or rocks.

The Island of Lewis is divided into many parts, the which men may sail
through at many and diverse places. Lewis with the Islands belonging to it lie
southsouthwest and south and by west about 29 leagues.

But on the east side goes a broad Sound through of five or six leagues. Men
sail in close by the Island of Lewis, about southsouthwest until past the
Island Cheut.

From thence the Sound lies through betwixt the great Island Bragadull and
Lewis south and south and by west toward the west end of Lewis, called the
Ephts, then you must leave Mulla and Ila, with diverse many other Islands on the
larboard side.

Jona, Ila, Mulla and Bragadul are 4 of the greatest Islands, which are lying
on the west coast of Scotland, and lie close by the mayn land, but there are
many havens and Sounds, so that there you may sail in and about them every
where.

At the northwest point of Ireland lie also some Islands, which you may sail
through and round about them all.

Betwixt Rona and Orkneys lie also some Islands which also you may sail
through betwixt and round about.

He that falls with these Islands must be very careful and circumspect, for
the most part of them are inhabited by wild and savage people.

In Lewis and the Islands thereabout a southwest and northeast moon makes the
highest water and likewise also without the north point of Scotland.

Of the Tides and Courses of the streams.
In Hitland within the havens and Sounds a southsouthwest and northnortheast
moon makes full sea. The flood runs there to the eastwards, and the ebb to
the westwards, especially at the south end and north end of Hitland, and so
fall thwart through the Sounds and havens.

In the Island of Fero a north and south moon makes the highest water.

Under the Islands of Fero go very hard tides, with great turnings, the flood
comes there out of the west and westnorthwest the ebb out of the east and
eastsoutheast and fall so along through the Islands, there you must reckon
your tides there after, when you will sail from the one Island to the other,
there are two wels or Maelstreames, the one at the south end of Suydry, and the
other a league within Scalhead at Quaelnes.

Although the tides do run so strong through these Islands yet nevertheles it
flows not there four foot up and down.

How these lands do lie one from the other, and from other lands.
From Fairehill to the northeast point of Orcaneys southwest 9 or 10 leagues.

FRom the Island Gryp to the Nomen-dals Islands, the course is northeast,
eighteen leagues, but from Gryp to the Island Rust, Rust.
north and north and by east four and sixteen leagues. Betwixt them ly (besides
the Nomen-dals Islands) also the Islands Holyland, Holyland
and Traenoch. Traenoch
Traenoch and Rust lie thirteen leagues asunder. From Rust to Wero, the course
is northeast and by north nine leagues, but to Loffoert northnortheast and by
north three and thirtye leagues. Betwixt Wero Wero.
and Loffoert Loffoert.
lies the Maelstrame, Maelstreame.
where you may sail through, but at still water. By the west point of Loffoert
you may run in, and make road under it. And also you may run through from
thence within betwixt the Islands and the mayn land, all along unto the
North-Cape.

Betwixt the Islands Westerholl, Sanien Sanien.
and Tromsound, Tromsound.
you may also run in at diverse places, and make road. Thwart of these Islands
lie here and there in some places suncken rocks and foul grounds, a great
league and more without the land. He that saileth along this coast, may be
care-full there of.

Of the Tides and Courses of the streams, about these foresaid places.
On these coasts a southsouthwest and northnortheast moon makes full sea. The
flood comes there out off the northwest and westnorthwest, and falls
along Finmark toward the North-cape.

The Maelstream lies in about 68 degrees. The Island Sanien in 70 degrees.
How these Lands do show themselves at sea.
Loffoert east and by south

Rust east and by south from you shows thus.

When the east end of Loffoert is southeast and by east from you, it shows
thus, with the land to the westwards.

When Loffoert is southeast from you 6, or 7 leagues, it shows thus.
When Loffoert is eastsoutheast from you, it shows and the land between thus.
This belongs to the Former.
The east end of Westerholl showed thus, when as you sail along by it, about
7 leagues off from it.
These two figures belong at the crosses one to the other.
Thus shows the land of Sanien, when the 2 high hills upon the east end are
southeast and by south, and the point, with the cliff south and by west from
you 4 leagues. When as the two foresaid high Hills upon the east end are south
from you, then they are right one in the other.


The second Demonstration, Where in Are set forth the Seacoasts and Islands of
Finmarcken, From Sanien to north Kijn or north Cape.
FRom the Island Tromsound to Surroy Surroy.
it is east-northeast somewhat northerly 15 or 16 leag. To the eastwards of the
Island Tromsound goes in the Tromsound betwixt the Island Fogelden Fogelden
and Skyrfeu, Skyrfeu.
as you sail in there you leave the Islands Loppen, Loppen.
and Loppen-kalf Loppen-kalf.
lying on the larboard side without the other Islands, within it are diverse
Islands, bays and sounds, where you may sail in, and seek road, as
Oxefioert, Biurfioert and more other.

Betwixt Loppen and Surroy men do sail through Suyersound and Stiernersound
into the river of Altenbotten, Altenbotten.
and then betwixt them they leave on the starboard side Niussioerd, Oxefioerd
and Langefioerd. On the larboard side about by the west point of Suroy, on the
land of Suroy, lies a Haven, where by is also a Fisher village, both called
Haeswyke, Haeswyck
Suroy is about ten leagues long, and lies on the off-side, eastnortheast.

Nine or ten leagues to the eastwards of the Island Tromsound, about three
leagues without the land and westnorthwest 5 leagues from the west end of
Surroy lies a shoale of rocks a little under water. Showld.
John Huygen of Linschoten in this second voyage to Nova Zembla, in the year
1595 sailed with his shipp upon it in fair weather and smooth water, that the
sheating of his stem was beaten of two ships; but after some beating the
shipp turned off with the strong current. It is to be thought that there lie
more then men can see, or as yet are discovered.

About six leagues east and by north from the east end of Suroy, lies the
Island Ingen, Ingen.
betwixt them both lie also Reef-holme Reefs-holm.
and Shipholme Shipholm
little Islands, which you may sail about on both sides, until under Ingen or
Suroy.

When as you come in betwixt Suroy and Ingen, there lies thwart off from Suroy
toward the other land, a good haven, called Hamerfeest. Hamerfeest.
A little further in lie two high little Islands, and over against them a road
called Slechtnes. Between Hamerfeest and Slechtnes, Slechtenes
before that you get Slechtenes, lies a bay on the land of Suroy, where is
good road in 25 or 30 fathom close by the shore. A little past these Islands
on the land of Suroy, over against the river of Alten, is a good road called
Goeshop Goeshop.
being a fair sandbay.

Between Ingen and the north-cape, or the Island Maggereu lies Homsbuy,
Holmsbuy.
an Island which you may sail round about, having on the northwest side a bay,
called Akefioerd, Akefioerd
where men may make road for southerly and easterly winds, on the southeast
side is a bay called Knaarwyke, Knaarwyke.
where men may make road, and lie sheltred for westerly and northerly winds.

Stappen.


On the south side of Maggereu even about the east point, lies Keelwyck a good
haven. On the same southeast side, by the southermost point of Maggereu, lies
a little Island called Altensoleu, the Sound betwixt that little Island, and
the land of Maggereu is called Maggereu-sound Maggereu sound.
there is good road, and shelter for almost all winds: Men may run in through
Suyer-sound to the westwards of Suroy within Suroy, Ingen, Helmshuy, and other
more Islands to the southwards of them, a long through diverse channells to the
southwards of Maggereu, and come out again into sea betwixt the North-Cape and
North-Kyn.

From the north Cape westwards the coast lies along the Islands west and by
south about 37 leagues, and then from thence westwards, it falls away more
southerly.

Of the Tides and Courses of the streams.
Between Suroye, and the river of Alten a southwest and by west and northeast
and by east moon makes high water.

At the North-Cape a southsouthwest and northnortheast moon.

To the westwards of the North-cape the streams come out of the northwest and
westnorthwest, and fall along Finmarck toward the North-cape.

Courses and Distances.
From the Island Tromsound to the west end of Suroye eastnortheast northerly 15
or 16 leagues. From the east end of Suroy to Ingen east and by north 6 leagues.
From Helmshuy to the North-cape east and by north 6 leagues. From the
North-cape to North-kyn east and by south 11 or 12 leagues.

The third Demonstration, In which Are showed the Sea-coastes between the
North-Cape and the River of Kola.
EAst and by south about 11 or 12 leagues from the north-Cape lies north-Kyne.
Northkyn
From north-Kyne to Tannebay it is eastsoutheast 10 or 11 leagues, between
both, it is all a clean coast, without Rocks or foul grounds, a high steep
craggie land, without any strand.

When as you come sailing along past North-Kyne, toward Tannebaye, you shall
meet first with the point of Slechtnes, a plain point lying out, very easy
to be known: and then Omega a Fisher village, standing on the Sea side, even
there to the eastwards of it goes in the Tannebay, Tanebay.
which is a great deep River which lies in first south, and afterward,
southwest far within the land, and does devide it self into two parts, at the
mouth of the River, it is at last two leagues or more broad, and all over very
deep. He that is bound into the Tannebay, must run in along by the west
shore, because he must lie by the west shore, on the eastside is no road or
place, where men may anchor.

On the foresaid w. side are many points and bays to see to as if they were
roads, but you must sail past them all so long, until that you se on the same
w. shore a round hill, whereupon stands a Warder, a little past that, stand
some Fishermens houses, upon a low hommock, twhart of these houses runs of
from the land a low flatt point, you must run in behind that point, and
anchor before those houses, with an anchor to seaward and a hawser fast on the
land.

A little to the eastwards of Tannebay lies the point, and the land of
Matkorf, Matkorf
from thence to Wardhouse the coast lies southeast and by east, southeast, and
most southeast and by south sixteen leagues, betwixt them there is much high
plain land. Half ways betwixt both, but nearest Wardhouse, Wardhouse.
lies a high hommock upon the high land, to see to like a castle, or Country
house, very easy to be known, being thwart of it close by land, it seems as
if there were a great Sound, where men might sail into Wardhouse are three
little Islands with some little rocks also by them, the southermost is the
greatest of the three, which only is inhabited, upon it is a village of about
300 Norway houses with a castle, it is abouts a half league long, and lies an
English mile off from the land, lying as the coast most south and north,
betwixt both, it is all over deep water. On the south side of this Island,
lies a haven or great baye about half ways the Island, and likewise one also
on the north side, so that these two bays do come so near one to the other
that there remains no more then a narrow chindle strand about a stone cast
broad, dividing so the Island almost into 2, the eastermost part is the
shortest, and highest, the westermost the longest. Close upon the strand, on
the east side of the souther-haven lies the Castle, to the northwards of it,
upon the foresaid chindle stra^d, and about the Bayestrand the houses. In the
souther Bay it is good lying, but the best road is betwixt the maine land and
the Island, about half ways on the side of the Island against a Sandbay,
Road Kilduyn.
and right against the Castle, there is good anchor-ground, in ten or twelve
fathom landlockt for all winds, except for north and south winds, which blow
there right through, yet men have some shelter of some point of the Island. Men
may without fear come in there, betwixt the Island and the Many, either from
the southwards or the northwards, it is all over cleanie and clear, but he
that comes in from the northwards, must run somewhat nearer the Rock, where
the gallows stands upon, then the Island, because thereabouts the Island is
a little foul.

About a shot of a Cast piece northwards from the greatest, lie the two
smallest close one to another, seeming afar off to be one Island, are
together not an English mile long, but high and rocky to see to, there lie also
two or three rocks by them.

On this coast like as at the north-Cape a northeast and southwest moon makes
high water.

From Ward-house to the point of Kegor or the Fishers Island, the course is
southeast and southeast and by south ten leagues.

Betwixt them both is a great baye, wherein are diverse Sounds and rivers,
amongst other the River Pitsing, which is a great fair and large River, where
men may go in with great ships, a good ways within the river is good road,
there is taken and laden much Salmon, but there fall no other special wares.
Southsouthwest from the point off Kegor lie two Islands, to the southwards of
them men do run into Monnick-forde.

Kegor is a fair haven, lying at the north end of the Fishers Island, Kegor or
Fishers Island.
a little without the point; There lie two or three rocks at the north point of
the haven, and also a suncken rock in the midst of the havens mouth; you
leave the suncken Rock, with the other Rocks on the starboard side of you, and
run in by the south shore and edge then behind the foresaid rocks, and
anchor there in seven or eight fathom, the havens mouth lies in southwest, it
is there so good lying as in any havens thereabouts on the coast.

The Danes call this haven Easter-haven, Easterhaven.
there was wont to be the Staple of the Fish, where every one must come to
buy: therefore the Island is yet called, whereon Kegor lies, the Fishers
Island.

It is indeed no Island, but very near: it is fast to the maine land, with
such a very small neck, that the Russes, which come from Kilduyn, or the River
of Kool, and are bound to the River Pitsing, do go along within this land,
and hawle their boats over that small neck, for not to go about a seaboard.

From Kegor to Laus, Laus.
the course is along the shore southeast and by south, somewhat easterly
nine or ten leagues. This is a right plain coast; without points or bays, all
along by Laus to Tiepena, but the south point of Laus lies out a little,
upon which stand two Warders, to the northwards of that point is the haven of
Laus, a fair sand-bay, there is very easy lying for southerly or easterly
winds, but not for northerly winds, the winds between the northermost and
northeast do blow there open in, and make therein a very great hollow sea,
men lie there in twelve, ten and eight fathom, according as they run far
in, the farther the shoaler, but all clean rising sand-ground.

From Laus a little toward Kegor lies a little Island, behind which is good
anchoring for easterly winds, in clean sand-ground, but it is somewhat narrow.

From Laus to Tiepena, Tiepena.
it is a great half league, at the point lie some little rocks, but you
cannot see them, before you be close to them. Tiepena is a fair haven, when
you come from the northwards, you must run so far to the southwards,
along by the shore, until that you see open into it, and sail in amidst
the channel. When as you come from the southwards, the haven opens it self,
being come in, you must edge up to the northwards, and anchor there, there you
lie land-lockt for all winds, there are no dangers which may hurt you, but it
is over all clear and clean sandy ground.

A little about the point, to the southwards of Tiepena, which is on the
southwest side of the Fishers Island is another fair haven, where men may go
to anchor, called Kowens. Kowens.


From Laus to the River of Kola, the course is south and by east and
southsoutheast about ten leagues. But Kilduyn and Laus lie southeast and by
south, somewhat easterly and northwest and by north, somewhat westerly also
ten leagues assnder.

The fourth Demonstration, Where in Are described the Sea-Coastes of Lapland
between the River of Kola and Islands of Swetenoes.
FOr to sail up into the River of Kool or Kola, The River of Kool.
you must go from Laus, or the south end of the Fishers Island toward the
River southsoutheast and south and by east, run about by the high land of
Poden-wolck, and then the River shall open it self very wide. When you are by
the point of Laus, you may see the Island Kilduyn, and the River of Koole, or
the land by it, Betwixt Laus and the River of Koole, is also a great baye.

When as you are in the mouth of the River, it lies in first south and by
west, and then southsouthwest, to that Island, which stands marked with A in
the Card of this, River, and then by little and little southwest and by south,
along by the Island marked with B unto the Train Island then southwest and
by west, and by little and little about the point west and by south, afterward
in west, unto Devils point, over against it lies the White stone, which lies
upon the land, thwart of it is good road. From thence again west and south,
westsouthwest and southsouthwest unto Kool.

When as you come into the River, Road in the River.
and will seek road there, you must keep along by the west shore, being
somewhat within, you shall see a little Island lying close by the shore: from
thence somewhat further about the high point is a Bight or Baye, and in that
Bight a Sand-baye, where men may save a ship without Anchor or Cable, that is
a fair Sand-baye, where men may run in all along.

Along by the north side it is five fathom deep, and clean sand-ground, men
run in there betwixt the two points, but there lies a black Rock in the
narrow, betwixt both shoares, which they must leave lying on the starboard
side, within that rock it three and two fathom deep unto the strand, within
there is fair green fields.

A little without the Baye lie two Islands, where of the outermost or
eastermost is the smallest. When as in sailing up along the River, you may
come by these two foresaid little Islands about half ways to the Island
marked with A, there is also good road, Road three Kings.
at the west shore, you shall see upon the high Land three Warders called the
three Kings, thwart of them is the road.

When you are somewhat past the Island A you cannot see the River any more
open, but it seems to be shut, and close, for that Island by A comes then
under the high land, on the east side.

Under the Island marked with B is also good road Road.
and clean sand-ground.

Likewise is also good road under the Train Island, that is reckoned for the
half of the River, to wit off from the mouth of Kool.

When as you come now a little past the Train Island, where the C stands,
then you shall see out a head a black blewe hill, called the Devils hill,
Divelshill.
it seems meth there, as if the River were close and shut. It is best sailing
along by the starboard side, there you have most all ground close by the
land. There are many Bights, points, and Bays, which are not all to be
described.

On the other side men do not come so commonly, (except it be against their
wills) there seem also to be many bays and roades, and also some little
Rivers. When as you come along by the Devils hill, where the D stands, past
the White stone, then you may see the Klinck-hill on the west side, and almost
all along unto Kool. When as you may see the Klinck-hill, Klinckhil.
there is ground by the west shore for to anchor in, then thereare on both
sides no dangers, but when as you come so far into the place, where the letter
E stands marked, Het eylandt Kilduyn met de Reed nae 't leven ontworpen
leggende op de hoochte van 69 graden 40 minuiten.

De Rivier van KOLA in tgroot besteck.

De Custe van LAPLANDT tusschen de Rivier van Kola en de eylande^ van Swetenoes

there you must somewhat shun the west shore, because of a little shoale
which shoots off from the shore, and keep in the middle of the channel,
until that you come against the Klinck-hill, there you must again go close
along by it, in the midst of the fareway lies an Island of Rocks, Rock.
which at high water is covered, where of you must take good heed.

From the Klinck-hill unto the Robben Island Robben Island.
sail all along by the west shore, the Robben Island is also covered at
high water, but when it is under water, then anchor thwart of the burnt trees.
Thwart of the Robben Island lies a very great rock, as soon as you are thwart
of the high land, look out carefully for it, keep without it, or to the
northwards of it, to wit a bow shot, there is the road, there you may anchor
by the shore so shoale as you please, it is there good lying, and there you
begin to see Kool along by the house. Betwixt the Island Kilduyn and the
River of Kola, somewhat nearer the River than the Island, lies a haven, called
Bliesna Silensi, Bliesna Silensi.
that is so say, the next to Silensi, there you sail in by a round reddish
Hommock, being come within it, you must edge up to the westwards, so that the
haven is altogether shut, and that you can see no sea, you may anchor there so
deep or shoale as you will, it is there every where clear and clean white
sandy ground, and somewhat oazye and soft, there you may also without fear
sail on against the shore in the oaze, and so may save a ship without
anchor or cables.

The Island Kilduyn Kilduyn.
is about two leagues long, and one league broad, and lies westnorthwest and
eastsoutheast along the land, like as also the channel betwixt the Island
and the maine land, which is at some places about a half league broad, and at
some places, narrower, but all over very deep and clean. About the midst,
yet nearest the cast end, is a fair close road, betwixt two points, that lie
out toward the maine land, there men lie under the Island, close to the
shore, before the Laps tents, under the eastermost point, which is a low
plain point, in twelve, thirteen, or fourteen fathom, sand-ground, more to
the southwards, it is very deep you shall soon have fifty and sixty fathom.

For to go into Kilduyn from the westwards.
If you will go to anchor under Kilduyn coming from the northwards or the
westwards, then run about by the west end, in betwixt Kilduyne and the main
land. When you are come somewhat within, you shall espy a little round Island,
there the Channel begins to be narrow, yet it is broad enough for to turn
to windwards through, sail forth toward the southeast end, until you come in
betwixt those two points, and run to the foresaid low point, and anchor there
within the bight, before the cabbens so near to the land as you please, there
you lie landlockt for all winds, as if you lay within a town in a close haven.

For to sail in from the eastwards, For to sail into Kilduyn from the
eastwards.
you must sail in to the westwards by the east end, so long until that you
come by the foresaid low point of the Island, then edge up about it to the
northwards, and run into the foresaid bight, before the Cabbens, and anchor
there in twelve, thirteen and fourteen fathom, that is the chiefest road.

At the north and east end of Kilduyn, betwixt the Island and the maine land,
there is also a very good road, in eight, ten or twelve fathom, where men
may lie sheltered for all winds. Thereabouts is on the Island a good water
place, there the water comes running off from the high land, there men may
go lie by it, and fill their caskes lying in the boat.

You may also anchor under the maine land, betwixt the narrow, and the Road of
Kilduyn, at the place where the anchor stands marked, in the Card. At the
east end of Kilduyn lies also a Fishers village, called Kammen, at a high
point, which is called the Sacrifice point.

From the Island Kilduyn to the point Tiribiry, the course is southeast and by
east about five leagues betwixt them is a great bay. In this bay, a great
league from Kilduyn lies a high Island called Bliesna Olinie, Bliesna Olinie.
which is the next or the nearest Olinie, behind it, under the main land,
nearest the south end of the Island is a good road, where three or four ships
may lie very well.

The lies a round hill, or high Hommock upon the maine land, which shows out
above all the other hommockes*, and is very easy to be known, upon which
stands a high cross of two crosses one above the other, to the northwards
off it lies a flat point, thwart of it lie some rocks along the shore,
which at high water are covered.

At the south end of the Island Olinie, a little from land, lies a rock almost
even with the water, but you may always see it well by the breaking of the
water.

To the Northwards of the Island about an English mile, lies a rock not far
from land, and also to seawards from it a suncken rock, which you cannot go
over at low water.

He that will (coming from the northwards) go to anchor behind Olinie, must
run a good ways to the eastwards of this foresaid rock along to the
northwards of the Island, for to avoid the foresaid rock. Being come behind
the Island, you shall espy the foresaid round hommock with the cross, you must
not run past the cross, but leave it on the larboard side, and sail enclose
by it for to avoid the foresaid rocks, which lie off from the flat north
point, the point with the cross is very clean and so steep, that you might
lie with a ship on against the shore without any hurt.

He that will come into this Road from the southwards, let him run along by
the coaste, which is very clean, until past the foresaid point with the
cross, and edge up close about by it, as is beforesayd.

Men do anchor within the point in seven, six, five, four and three fathom,
deep or shoale as they will, there goes no grown sea at all.

About half ways betwixt the Island Olinie and Tiribiry Tiribiry.
is another haven or great Bay, where men may lie landlockt for all winds.

Tiribiry is a great River and off-water, where is a great Salmon fishing,
there men may go in with great ships, and anchor every where within it where
they will in good sandy-ground, it lies in most south, and afterward more
westerly, the eastermost point lies out more to seawards than the other, so
that it makes a bay, where men ride under for a northwest wind.

Two leagues to the southwards of Tiribiry lies Waronia, which is a great
sand-bay or haven, with at the mouth is narrow, but within it is a broad Sound,
there is also an off-water, where is also much Salmon caught.

Within this bay it is every where good anchoring, shoale water and clean
ground.

Before the mouth of this haven lie three little Islands, behind them is also
good road.

Two leagues or two leagues and a half to the southwards of Waronia lies a
Gabriele, Gabriele.
a tide haven, which falls dry within, so that men may go over there dry at
low water, it flows there twelve foot up and down, a southsouthwest moon
makes high water on this coast.

In the mouth of this haven lie three Islands, two on the north side (which are
the lowest) and one on the south side, that is the highest, you must run
nearest the southermost when as you will sail in there: being come within the
Islands, you must edge up to the northwards behind the two northermost
Islands, and anchor there on the north side of the haven, there it is seven and
eight fathom deep clean ground.

About a league to the southwards of it lies Salensi Daelna, Daelna Silensi.
that is to say, the farther Silensi; but betwixt them both a little to the
northwards of Silensi, lies yet a great indraught which lies in at least two
leagues into the land, and is about so wide as the River Tie before Amsterdam,
there may lie a great multitude of ships, it is there broad and large
enough, and all over good anchor ground.

A little to the northwards of this in-draught lies a little Island, or rock,
somewhat high, about which you may sail within, to wit, through betwixt these
rocks and the land, but may make no road under them.

Salensi Daelna Daelna Silensi.
is a great broad bay, before it lie three Islands, which are to see to gray of
color, as the main land.

To the northwards of these Islands upon the point off the bay stands 3 great
Warders, and a little to the southwards of the Islands, on the main land lies
a steep hill, by which marks this bay is very easy to be known.

If you will sail into this bay coming from the northwards along the shore
by the foresaid great in-draught, a little to the northwards of this baye, you
must look out for these foresaid great Warders, leave them on the starbord
side, and sail in close by them, through betwixt that point and the Islands,
first westsouthwest, somewhat within, and then more southerly, until behind
the Islands, and anchor there in five, six, or seven fathom: you may also sail
further to the southwards into the baye, so deep as you will, there it is all
over clean.

When you come before the channel, it seems to be very narrow, but it is
broad enough.

To the southwards of these Islands is also a channel which is very narrow,
but yet for need you may sail out there. The southermost Island, that is,
whereupon the Fishermen dwell, is fast to the northermost with a shoale,
whereupon is at high water 10 or 11 foot water, but at low water you cannot go
over it.

Two little leagues to the southwards of Salensi lies the Island Daelna
Olinie, Daelna Olinie.
that is to say, the Furthest Olinie, it is an Island almost of Fashion like
Bliesna Olinie, at the north end high, at the south end lower, and upon the end
very steep, it has in the midst, (but some what nearer the south end then
the north end) a low valley, where at high water the sea does almost run
along over it.

Behind this Island, not under the Island, but under the main land, are good
roades.

For to come in from the northwards behind this Island, it is a broad, large,
and very deep Channel, without any dangers, but if you will sail in behind
it (from the southwards) then you must run in close by the Island, for to
avoyde a foul and stony riffe, which lies off from the maine land, half
ways to the Island, and so shoale that it falls dry with the spring tides at
low water.

About half ways the Island, nearest the south end, is a point, lying out
from the main land, twoards the Island, to the northwards of it men do anchor
in 6, 7, or 8 fathom.

When you come in from the northwards, you may (so soon as you come within the
points) lusse up toward close about the point of the main land into a bay, and
anchor there in eight, six, five or four fathom, according as you sail far
in, there it is very easy lying. In these roades under the main land, it is
all clean and flat rising ground, but under the Island it is deep, and the
ground rising very steep, and therefore it is not good anchoring there.

Betwixt this Island Daelna Olinie, and Silensi, lie 3 little black Islands,
where is very easy road under them in 8, 7, and 6, fathom.

From Daelna Olinie to Rind Rind.
are five leagues. Rind is a very fair Haven, before it lie four little
Islands, where men may go to anchor behind them, behind these Islands this
Haven has two bays, upon the point betwixt them both stands a great Cross,
the southermost baye is far the greatest, into it comes also a river or off
water, where men do catch Salmon. The middlemost Island (which is the
northermost save one) is the greatest and highest upon which stands a great
Warder, the northermost is somewhat long and small, and so low, that at high
water the sea runs up a good ways upon it on both sides, and so makes that
Island smaller.

Betwixt that Island and the maine land, or the north shore of the Havens
mouth lies a suncken rock, which you must leave, in coming in, on the
larboard side, and run in close by the main land, this channel is so narrow,
that you cannot sail in it, except you have a large wind, at low water there
remains no more then 9 or 13 foot water.

To the southwards of that great Island, lies another Island that is
indifferent high, and the southermost of them all, betwixt that and the point
of the maine land, lies in the souther channel, which is broad and deep
enough, but when you seyle in there, you must run nearest the land, for to
avoid a suncken rock which lies at the foresaid point of the maine land.

These channells both from the southwards and from the northwards lie in both
along the shoares, when as that you come then within the Islands you may
anchor there all over where you will, there it is broad and large, and every
where clean and clear. Men do anchor commonly under the greatest Island
thwart of the great Warder, and also behind the norhermost Island in five,
four or three fathom there it is very easy lying but with a southeast wind,
the sea comes a little rolling in, but there can go no great sea.

Far within the southermost bay, almost before the river, lies a rock, but
above water. Without the greatest and the southermost Island, lies a little
Island, or great rock, somewhat round, you may sail out and in betwixt the
southermost and the greatest Island, along to the n. wards of that little
round Island, that is you must leave the southermost Island with the outermost
little round Island both on the starboard side, and the greatest Island with
the Warder on the larboard side, when you sail out, this is a very narrow
channel, but very clean and clear, so that there is nothing to be avoided,
but only a little suncken rock, which lies at the north end of the outermost
little round Island, and falls dry at low water, nevertheless it is not good
to use it, except it were for need that you could not do better.

He that is bound into this haven, must run close along by the shore for to
get sight of the foresaid Islands, for by reason that the inner land is high,
the Islands lie so under the land, that men can hardly see them, when they be
any thing far off from the shore.

A half league to the southwards of Rind is another great Bay, or haven,
before it lie two little high Islands upon the northermost stands a great
cross, you may sail in there about on both sides off these little Islands,
and also through betwixt them, and anchor where you will in fifteen, twelve,
eight, or five fathom, deep or shoale, according as you sail far in lie and
there sheltred for all winds, but when the wind is hard out of the sea,
thwart upon the shore, there will come in somewhat a rolling sea, but there
can go no great sea that can hurt you. A little to the northwards of this
haven lies a low long Island close to the shore, whereby you may also know
this coast, you may sail through betwixt this foresaid Island and the maine
land without any danger.

From this haven to the Seven Islands are four great leagues. A little to the
northwards of the end of the seven Islands, lies a fair great sand-bay, where
is also good anchoring for southerly and southeast winds, but not for easterly
winds, with a northeast or sea wind, it is bad lying there for there is no
shelter for them, men do anchor there in twenty, fifteen or twelve fathom,
according as they lie far or near to the shore. The Ruffes call this Bay the
Golden Bay, Golden Bay.
because the strand is of red sand.

On all these foresaid coasts a southwest and northeast moon makes high
water, like as on the former.

The seven Islands Seven Islands.
lie all of them along the shore, the first or northermost is far the
greatest of all, a high Island. The four northermost follow close one to the
other, and lie about an English mile, or a shot of a cast piece, a little more
or less off the land, so that men may sail there through betwixt. The fifth
is a little round Island, and lies nearer to the land, there you cannot run
through within it, which is fast to the land with a shoale of rocks, whereof
some lie above, and some under water. The two southermost lie a good ways to
the southwards of the fifth: betwixt them and the main land you may alse sail
through, you may also run through in and out betwixt these same Islands every
where, except betwixt the second and third off from the northwards betwixt them
both it is foul.

The first Island.
Betwixt these Seven Islands and the main land, goes a strong tide, as well of
flood, as of ebb, whereof men must be very careful.

Betwixt the northermost and the main land is a good road (thwart of the south
end of the Island) under the maine land, there is a fair sand-bay, with an
off-water, where is much Salmon to be caught, but it is not there used.

A little to the northwards of this Sand-bay lies a little Island betwixt the
great Island and the coast, men do anchor to the southwards of that little
Island, thwart of the sand-bay in seven, six, five, or four fathom, so shoale
as they will, there is a very even sand-ground, rising so even as if it were
planed.

Over against the foresaid bay men may make road under the south point of the
Island, thwart of a little bay, there they bring a hawser on land, and an
anchor to seawards in nine-tenne fathom, there they lie somewhat more out off
the tide then in the bay over against it.

Betwixt this great Island and the coast is about two third parts of the
channel toward the main land, flat rising ground, and the other third part
toward the Island Deep; the nearer the Island the deeper unto 18 and 19 fathom.

About half ways betwixt that foresaid little round Island, and the north
point of the gratest Island, stand on the main land some little Lappish
houses, or a little village.

Betwixt the second and third Island, Second and third Island
or nearest thwart of the second, to tell from the northwards, lies yet a
little village, thwart of it is a bay where men may anchor in ten or twelve
fathom all clean sand-ground, but with a south wind there comes in a rolling
Sea, but with northerly winds it is very good lying there.

Thwart of the fourth Island The 4 Island.
on the main land, is also a sand-bay, where is also good road in seven or
eight fathom for a northwest or north wind, but with an east wind it is there
bad lying, that blows there in open through betwixt the fourth and fifth
Island.

Even at the end of the seven Islands is a great Indraught, or bay, which the
Russes call the Shipper, The Shipper.
which is narrow at the coming in, but within indifferent large and wide:
within it is good road in twelve, eight and four fathom clean rising ground,
but with a northeast wind it is bad lying there, that blows there flat in.

About nine leagues to the southwards of the Seven Islands, lies a point
called Siornenos; that is to say; Blackpoynt, it is so called, because it is
very black to see to, there within it the land is high, and goes downwards low
toward this point, almost as Swetenoes.

At this point the land begins to alter inform to the northwards of it the
coast is altogether high, but to the southwards of it all low and even land, so
that thereby you may know (when you sail along this coast) whether you be to
the northward or to the southwards of this black point.

A little to the northward off this point lies a high and great Island a half
league long, which the Russes call Noock Ostrove, Noock Ostrove.
which is the Nail Island, behind it is very good road, you must run in
there from the southwards; from the northwards, you cannot come in there behind
it.

The north end is fast to the main land with a bancke or struck of sand, which
lies most part above water, you may sail in there so far behind it as you
will, and anchor in ten, eight, six or four fathom, the further that you sail
in the shoaler it is, it is very good lying, there and sheltered for all winds.

From the Siornenos, or the black point to Evanekrist, Evanekrist
it is southsoutheast four leagues, that is a point with many crosses, under
it you may make good road for southerly winds.

From Evanekrist to Kletna Kletna.
are yet three or four leagues this is a point whereupon stand also many
crosses, it lies out a little, but not so much as Evanekrist, there you may
have also road for southerly winds, but not for seawards.

From this point to the Islands of Swetenoes or Jockena, Island of Jockena.
it is two leagues.

The fifth Demonstration, In which are set forth The Sea-Coastes of the Mouth
of the White Sea.
THe Islands of Swetenoes or Jockena, there are six in number, whereof the five
lie along the shore about the space of two leagues, the sixth lies within
the other, thwart of the southermost of the five. The three northermost lie one
by the other, as also the 2 southermost parted asunder from the other three the
northermost off all these Islands of Jockena Islands of Sweetenoes Jockena.
lies from the point of Swetenoes due west three leagues, behind it is good
road thwart of the south end in five or six fathom. The point of Swetenoes is
a flat point lying out, to the westwards of it, at the end of those foresaid
Islands, goes in the river of Jockena, where is a great Salmon-fishing. When
you are by Swetenoes Swetenoes
you can see little perfectenesse of these Islands, because the main land is
much higher then the Islands.

He that comes from the northwards, and is bound in to Jockena, For to sail
into the River off Jockena.
must run close along by the shore, for to get sight of these Islands.
Through four several ways you may sail through these Islands into the river
of Jockena: First coming from the northwards, you may sail along by the
shore, through betwixt the shore and the Islands, (which you leave then all
on the larboard side) into the river.

The second pass lies in through betwixt the three northermost, and the two
southermost Islands, that is broad, wide and deep, and also the best channel
off all, it lies southwest, and southwest and by west from the point of
Swetenoes, and lies in most south, when you sail in there, you must run
nearest the southermost Island, because of a suncken rock which lies in this
channel somewhat off from the third Island, at high water you may run over it,
but not at low water.

Being come within these Islands, you shall see the sixth Island, which lies
within the two southermost, you must run about by it, leaving it on the
larboard side; When as you are then a little past that innermost Island; you
come against the high point, and sail in along amidst the channel, betwixt
both lands, there it is shoale water, to wit, five, four, three, to two fathom
and a half, but you may sail in amidst the channel without fear, all
along unto the Lappish-houses, where the Salmon-fishing is, and anchor there
also in the midst of the river, thereabouts lie some suncken rocks, which at
low water are uncovered, whereof you must take heed.

For to have the right knowledge of this channel, you must look out for the
high point, which lies at the west point of the river, within the Islands,
when that is behind the fourth Island (to reckon off from the northwards) and
the point of Swetenoes is northeast, and northeast and by east from you, then
you are right open before the foresaid channel.

Betwixt the two southermost Islands goes also an indifferent wide channel
through, where men can sail in, and so come on against the innermost Island,
which you may sail about on both sides.

Betwixt the Islands and the main land you may also sail through, but that is
a very narrow channel, men sail through it, as if they sailed in along a
ditch betwixt two Dykes.

For need, or if it were in extremity, you might also sail through at high
water betwixt the northermost Island, and the second, and likewise also betwixt
the second and the third, but if you can by any means do better, it is not
good to do it.

Men may anchor at diverse places within these Islands. Betwixt the two
southermost Islands, and the innermost Island, you may have road, where you
may lie sheltred for all winds, and safe from Ice-drifts out of the sea. Within
the innermost Island you must also anchor over against it somewhat further in
against the steep point. At the rivers mouth, on the west shore is a bay
where you may sail in, and anchor so near to the shore as you will, in six,
five, four and three fathom soft sticking ground, there you lie safe from
Ice-drifts. You may also anchor on the east side, right before the steep
point, but there you lie not safe for ice that comes out of the river. The
tide here along these Islands, agrees near with the tide of Swetenoes, it
flows with Spring tides near two fathom and a half up and down.

Behind the point of Swetenoes you may run into the bay, and anchor there for a
north, northeast and east wind, there is clean ground.

From Swetenoes to Lombascho, Lombascho.
the coast lies southsoutheast thirteen leagues. Under Lombascho men may also
go to anchor, but it is not there very good lying, especially with great
ships; the ground there is not clean, and when the wind is out of the Sea,
comes in there rolling very much. The lying of this road stands drawn out
at large in the Card, with the depths set down as it is at high water and
neepe tides: the water falls and flows there at least two fathom up and
down, and at Spring-tydes little less then three fathom, or two fathom and an
half.

Within the point, or in the bight of Lombascho you may not anchor, there
remains not above three foot water, and the ground is stony and foul.

To the northwards of Lombascho lie five Islands lying along the coast
almost half ways to Swetenoes.

Three leagues to the southwards of Lombascho, lies a black steep point,
until that the coast lies of from Lombascho also southsoutheast, but from
that point to Orlogenes, Orlogenes
the course is south 9 leagues, betwixt them there is no place where men may
anchor, but all along a whole coast, clean and steep.

From the point of Orlogenes lies off a stone-riffe a shot off a cast piece
into Sea, which falls dry a great ways at low water, whereof men must take
very good heed.

From Orlogenes to the river Ponnoye, it is six leagues: betwixt them lie the
three Islands. Three Islands.
First from Orlogenes to the two first Islands, the course is south three
leagues, and from thence to Ponnoye southwest and by south 3 leag.

A half league to the northwards off Ponnoye lies the third of the three
Islands, so that the two and the third lie about two leagues asunder.

These Islands are much lower then the maine land, so that they can hardly be
seen or not at all, except you be by the shore, thwart of them you may come
near the shore in seven fathom without danger.

Thwart of these three Islands, and Ponnoy, the mouth off the white sea is at
the narrowest.

About four leagues thwart off to seawards from the three Islands in the
midst of the mouth lies a shoale, which is very uneven and stony, and at
some places with low water comes dry above water, it lies south and north,
first north along the coast, at last north and by west until thwart of
Lombascho, but there along it is deep enough, fifteen and sixteen fathom.
About southeast from Ponnoy it is at the shoalest seven fathom deep. You may
also sail along to the eastwards of this shoale into the white Sea, but
there it is shoale water, uneven and very shoale. The right fareway is along
to the westwards of it, and five and twenty fathom deep.

Ponnoy is a River where at low water remains no more then ten foot water, it
flows there with a spring-tyde three fathom up and down, and with an
ordinary tide 15 foot.

From the three Islands to the Island Sousnowits, which men do call the cross
Island, the course is southwest and by south, or as some do hold southwest ten
leagues, or from Ponnoy nine leagues. All along this coast men may anchor
every where in eight or nine fathom, and with contrary winds stop the tides,
there go strong tides especially in the spring of the year withan Ebb.

Between the three Islands and the cross Island lies a point, upon which
stand also three crosses, one by the other, which men do mistake oftentimes
for the cross Island, but it is much smaller to see to. When you do get sight
of that point, there shows by it, as if there lay a ship before the land
with the topmast-stricke. The right cross Island has upon the north end two
Crosses, and upon the South end three, by all these marks they are easy to be
known one from the other.

Behind the Cross Island you may have road in 6 or 7 fathom, you may sail in
behind it, as well from the northwards as from the southwards, it is there
clean and clear every where, men do anchor, when as the great cross does
stand from them e.n.e. there is the right road.

Southeast and by south from the three Islands, and Ponnoy on the Russe side,
there goes in the Meseens golfe, into which comes a great River, where men
may go up to Kilda, and Kolmogro, and also another, upon which the town Slowoda
lies.

Southeast from Ponnoy lies a little Island in the mouth of the Meseens golf,
where you may have road under for westerly and southwest winds.

The south point of this golf is a low sand-strand, all grown with trees, there
you may also anchor along by the shore, but close by the land; if you lie
somewhat of from the shore in 9 fathom, there the ground is foul, from thence
along the shore to the Blew point, it is al fair strand ground.

From the Cross Island, to the blew or Gray point, the course is southwest
twenty leagues. In this fareway in the mouth of the White-sea, Current in the
mouth of the white sea.
there go sometimes very strong currents, especially in the spring, through
the terrible great freshuts, of the melting of the snow, which falls from
both sides into the White-sea, and runs through this strait into the sea,
with graet whirling and terrible riplings: It happens sometimes that the
current runs there so terrible strong, to the w. wards into the sea, that
with a reasonable gale and full sayls, men can do no more but stem the tide,
where of men must be mindful.

Under the Gray point Gray-poynt.
men may anchor on the south side in ten, eight, or seven fathom, there it is
good lying for easterly winds, a northeast wind comes from the point the
ground is there reasonable good, but not the cleanest.

From the Gray point eastwards to the Meseens Golf the coast is all fair
sand-strand, with some bancks of 2 fathom and an half, and three fathom
along the shore, not far without the land, where sometimes the current
falls over with great riplings.

From the blew point to the river of Arch-Angell, the course is south and by
west fourteen leagues. When as you sail so toward the rivers, you shall then
first espy the land a good ways to the westwards of S. Nicholas, it arriseth
in a long struck, and then there rises more land toward the River, as if it
were a round Island, afterward you shall see the steeple of S. Nicholas, when
that stands south and by west and southsouthwest from you, then you are open
before the mouth of the river of Arch-Angell.

The cape of Candenoes Candenoes.
and Orlogenes lie northeast and southwest 7 and sixty leagues asunder. The
point off Candenoes is very easy to be known, there stand five great crosses
upon it for marks. When as you fall with it, you may very well perceive, that
the land falls away, on the one side to the southwest, toward the White sea,
and southeast on the other side.

About thirteen leagues to the eastwards of the cape de Candenoes lies an
Island, called Morsonowits, Morsonowits.
to the eastwards of it goes a great Baye into the land, but it is very shoale
water, with many shoales and Dwale-grounds. It has heretofore happened, that
some ships have been here lost, thinking that they run into the mouth of the
White Sea, for it a greeth very near with the course, and also with the height
of the White Sea, but it is easy to be know by the land, and to discern one
from the other, for the Russe coast to the eastwards of Candenoes is altogether
a land with Sand-hills, and a flat strand, but the coast of Lapland is high and
hilly. In this Bay goes a River through the land, where you can come through
with Lodges into the White Sea.

Thwart off this Baye, about six and twenty leagues east, and east and by
south from Candenoes lies the Island off Calgoya, Calgoya.
being thirteen leagues long, you may sail round about it, but upon the south
side runs a great riffe along the land: they that come from the eastwards
must avoid it, for it is fast to the west end off the Island. Upon this Island
are great store of Geese, which in the Summer are altogether bare, or naked,
without any feathers, which sit and broad upon one egg, which they have lying
under them, and so do hatch their young one which are there in such
abundance, that the Russes do come there a shore with their Lodges, and lay
a deele or boarde upon the land, and drive the Geese with staves, into their
boats or Lodges, in such abundance, that they salt them into Barrels, in great
abundance.

From Candenoes to the Island Tussara, Tussara.
it is eastsoutheast two and forty leagues betwixt them both goes in the
foresaid Baye. By west Tussera lies the point off Swelgenoes. Swelgenoes.


From Tussara to the River of Colcova, Colcova.
the course is east seven leagues, which is a good River, being twelve foot
deep, but there is no other trade, but that the Russes do come there from
Colmogro and S. Nicholas with Lodges, for to trade there, and to barter their
wares there for Skins and other wares.

Seven leagues to the eastwards off the River of Colcova, lies the River off
Pitsana, Pitsana.
there is but six foot water, and is an unknown place, but a little to the
westwards of it lies a shoale, which you must avoid: Oliver Bruneel in his
voyage from Nova Zembla come on ground there.

About thirteen leagues to the eastwards of Pitsana lies the river off
Pitsora, Pitsora.
which lies in southsoutheast by the east point, and has twelve foot water
the land is there low with Sand-hills, and upon the west side stands a
Pack-house with some crosses. When you come within the River, you must edge up
westwards toward the Pack-house, and anchor there in three or four fathom,
there is a great Haff, or broad water. You must avoid the east side off the
River, which is full of Sands and bancks. The little town of Pitsora lies
about five and thirty leagues within the land, there is great abundance of
costly Skins and Crystal.

Betwixt Pitsora and Waygats lies Oltgyn, Oltgyn.
and without the Land lie two rocks or little Islands, the one called Orangien,
and the other Grave Maurice, you may anchor under them in six or seven fathom.
From the southermost shoots off a little riffe, but you may sound it well in
three fathom.

To the eastwards and to the westwards of these two little Islands is a great
Bay, where it is shoale water, the land runs there round to the point of
Pitsora, all along in a Bay off from Pitsora unto the Waygats. It is from
Pitsora to Waygats northeast and by east 38 or 40 leagues.

Waygats, ^aygats.
which is also called the Strait of Nassaw is Strait where, men may sail
through into the Tartarish Sea, it lies in first about e. afterward northeast
through about eight or nine leagues, about half ways through lies an Island,
^ne^^
which you may sail about on both sides. A little within the point, on the
north side is a fair Baye, which you may sail into so deep as you will, in
five, four and three fathom, good sticking ground along by the east shore
is the deepest water, there you shall lie sheltered for all winds and
Ice-drifts.

Through this narrow or Strait, has been diverse times attempted, or under
taken, for to discover, and to find a way, for to pass along to the
northwards of Tartaria, unto the rich Kingdoms of Cathay and China, and so
forth to the Molucques, but in vain because of the terrible ice that remains
there to whole year through, and can never melt, by reason of the continual
cold.

From the east end of the Strait Waygats to Baye off Oby Oby.
it is eastsoutheast, and southeast and by e. forty leagues. To the eastwards
of it that land lies forth northeast forty leagues more, to the two rivers,
and then yet so forth along northeast but how far it yet unknown.

The West cast of Nova Zembla Nova Zembla.
lies to the northwards off from Waygats to Costintsarck northnorthwest about
three and fifty leagues. To the northwards of it the land falls away, about
north and by east to the point of Langenes, or the States point, further
northnortheast, northeast and eastnortheast to the Island of Orangien, the
northermost part of Nova Zembla, in the height of 77 degrees and an half.

Of the Tides and Courses of the streams, about these foresaid places.
At Swetenoes a s. and n. Moon makes high water.

Along the coasts to the eastwards of the north cape, the floods com out of
the northwest and northnorthwest, and run so along the coasts of Lapland,
unto Orlogonose.

At the three Islands a southwest and northeast moon makes high water.

At Katsnose point an east and west moon makes the highest water.

Before Podessemske and S. Nicholas an east and by s. and west and by north
moon makes the highest water.

At the Island of Nova Zembla a southeast moon makes high water.

From Orlogenes and the three Island, the flood falls into the mouth of the
White Sea, toward the graye point of Catsnose about s.s.w. and southwest and
by west.

But about the point of Catsnose, the flood falls into the White Sea, partly
toward Warsiga and Ombay, and also toward the Podessemske and S. Nicholas.

To the eastwards of Candenoes, toward the Island of Colgoyen, the flood
falls east and by south, as also along the same Island, and from Colgoyen
toward the Waygats, the tide falls east and west. Along Nova Zembla, the
tides turn about with the moon along Rusland, they come out of the west and
westnorthwest, betwixt Candenoes and Pitsora, and fall so along Rusland.

The floods toward Waygats come from Colgoyen and Nova Zembla, and fall
together east and by north through the Strait of Waygats toward the River of
Obye, so that the ebs and floods do keep open the channel of Waygats, that
they are oftentimes without ice, or at least but with ice that drivers in
shoales.

But to the eastwards of the Waygats, the floods come out of the northeast, and
fall so into the Oby, and into the Strayt of Nassaw, there the water rises and
falls, but keeps no certain tide.

Of the Depths and grounds bot to the eastwards and westwards of Waygats.
All the coast along off from Candenoes unto Waygats, men do find a flat
rising ground, the most part sand and soft ground, he that must sail there in
misty weather, must know that in 8 or 9 fathom depth, he is 4 or 5 leagues from
the coast, but when it is 30, 35 or 40 fathom, then he is far enough from the
land. So it is along Nova Zembla, and also over the east side of Waygats, but
when you come before the Strait, it will be shoaler by little and little.

The sixth Demonstration, Where in Are set forth the Sea-Coastes of the whole
White Sea.
FRom the blew point to the river of Arch-Angell, the course is south and by
west thirteen leagues. When as you sail so toward the rivers, you shall then
first espy the land a good ways to the westwards of S. Nicholas, it arises in
a long struck, and then there rises more land toward the River, as if it
where a round Island, afterward you shall see the steeple of S. Nicholas, when
that stands south and by west and southsouthwest from you, then you are open
before the mouth of the River of Arch-Angell.

For to sail into the River of Archangel.
If you will sail in there, then bring the steeple of S. Nicholas a ships
length and a half, or two ships lengths to the eastwards of the Cross
sand-hill, keep them so standing and sail right with them, until that the
wood within come midwayes in the middlemost Podessemske, go on the southwest
and by south, and southwest, for to sail a weather of the tail or shoale,
which shoots off from the east shore, when as then the wood within (that is
the wood upon the northeast point of the River) comes to the southermost of
the two woods, which stand upon the middlemost Island or the Poedessemske, then
you are in the mouth of the channel, right upon the shoalest of the Bar, the
marks of the east tail are, when the wood comes half ways betwixt the
southermost and the middlemost Podessemske, when the point of the southermost
Podessemske is southsoutheast somewhat southerly from you, then you are without
the point of the west grounds. If you bring that point more easterly from you,
you can take no hurt of that point. When you are entered the channel, then go,
as is beforesayd, southwest and by south, and southwest, until that the
steeple of S. Nicholas come a ships length by west the Cross sand-hill, then
further take the sounding of the west shore, and run in by it, toward the
foot strand, and along close by it, without going off from it, until that
you come thwart of the white place, or spot, on the west shore, about the
place where it stands marked in the Card with A. Edge over then from thence
east and by south, and eastsoutheast right to the point of the Wood on the east
shore, and on southeast in along by the east land, close along by the
shore, but thwart of the two Islands which lie on the starboard side, it is a
good ways along the east shore somewhat foul and shoale, where of you must
take heed: but go all along by the east shore, until that you come by the
first River on the larboard side, edge then over again to the west shore
along southsouthwest, until you come to the bight, there it is shoale water
on the east side.

When you are come in the bight, then go on eastsoutheast, and afterward east
and by south toward the Stonereach, Stonereach.
sail through there amidst the channel, along by the buys, which lie in the
midst of the deep, it is on both sides of the buys uneven and rugged.

When as you come against the Stonereach there stands a Fishers house upon
the west shore, by the little River that runs into the land, at the north
end, or west end of the Stonereach, thwart of that foresaid house lies a great
stone under water, which you may sail about on both sides, it lies about the
midst of the fareway, as you come sailing on, men sail commonly about to the
westwards of it, all along by the west shore, like as also through the
Stonereach, for the west side is deep enough, and at some places somewhat soft
ground, but the east shore is full of rocks.

When as you are past the buys, then you must keep off again, somewhat from
the shore. There was wont to lie a little Island at the end of the Stonereach,
but that is of late years altogether scowred away with the Ice. When as you
are now through the Stonereach, the course is first southeast and afterward
southeast and by south until you come in the bight, then go on easts.e. and
keep yet to the west shore, until that you see the town of Archangel,
Archangel.
then sail right toward it, but avoid the point on the larboard side, for it
is foul.

it is about twelve or thirteen leagues most southeast, but the River runs
upwards with many crooked Bights.

of Arch-Angell, then run out by the foot-strand, and keep the sounding of
the west shore. When as you begin to see the steeple of S. Nicholas, then
bring it a ships length to the second or middlemost Podessemske, there lies a
black Hommock upon the strand. The north side of the wood within comes then
over that Hommock, then go on northeast and by north, and northnortheast,
toward the Podessemskes. When as then the wood within comes to the north
side of the southermost of the two woods, upon the middlemost Podessemske, then
you are upon the shoalest of the Bar, but when the point of the southermost
Podessemske is southsoutheast somewhat southerly from you, then you are at the
end of all the shoales, and may go your Course through the sea, where you
please, no shoales shall hinder you.

From the Bar of Podessemske, or from the River of Archangell to the road of
S. Nicholas S. Nicholas.

S. Nicholas, but that is so shoale a river that no ships can go into it, men
must lade them without with Lodges.

About southwest and west and by west from the bar of the river of
Arch-Angell lies the Salt Island, upon it stands a Cloister, and is fast to
the main land. This land lies off from thence to the Cape de Onega, west and
by north.

From the Crosse-Island to Warsiga, the course is west southwest, and west and
by south about four and twenty leagues. Warsiga Warsiga.
is a village, lying on a river, where is a Salmon-fishing, which lies into
the northwards within the land, you cannot come into the River with ships,
there is no more then eight or nine foot water, but must stay without in the
Road before the River, there is clean sand-ground, without any foul ground,
so that you may anchor there without danger, so near or far from the shore,
as you will.

This River men do know (when they sail along the coast) by three high
Hommocks, which are higher then all the other, and almost of fashion like the
three hills by Bayonne in Galicia, to the northwards of it are white sand-hills
with trees upon them. Even by west the three foresaid hommocks goes in the
river.

For to sail from Warsiga to Ombay, the course is along by the coasts a
little west, west and by north, and then westnorthwest, afterward the most
northwest, unto the point of Tauria Point off Tauria.
six and thirty or seven and thirty leagues. About half ways betwixt them,
well so near Warsiga as Tauria lies on the coast a high bare hill, thwart of
it and to the westwards of it lie some bancks, whereof you must take heed.

The point of Tauria is a high steep point full of trees, to the eastwards of
this land, the point falls away into a great Baye far along to the
eastwards. About five leagues to the eastwards of the point of Tauria, lies a
rock, a good ways from land, which is not very great, but very easy to be
known, it shows a far off, as if there sat a great Ape upon it, this rock
the Russes call Tourie Babbe, Tourie. Babbe.
that is to say, Grandmother of the point.

Within that Rock in that foresaid Baye it is all shoale water, uneven and
foul ground, where you may not anchor not have road, but to the eastwards of
the point Tauria you may anchor for westerly and northerly winds, somewhat to
the northwards of the point in the Bight, there it is shoale, but by the point
it is deep, there you must anchor close by the land.

By the west point lies the Island Volna Ostrove, Volna Ostrove.
by the Dutchmen called the Reeme-Island. From the point Tauria to that
Island, the course is northnorthwest, two leagues.

Betwixt the Island and the land of Tauria lies also a little Island, betwixt
these two Islands, you may (for need) sail through with a ship, but it is
very narrow, at the northeast point of Ostrove is road in thirty fathom, then
you lie with the ship, (when she lies wended to the Island) in eight fathom,
so very steep and rising is the ground there.

not very broad but deep, at the coming in it is in the middst four and
twenty, and five and twenty fathom, far within, five or six fathom deep, but
there it is foul. Men do commonly anchor a half league within the river, on
the east side, with an anchor in the middst of the river, sixteen or eighteen
fathom, and with a cable on land, there it is good lying with all winds,
except, with a southsouthwest wind, which blows there open in.

About half a league to the westwards of it lies the fresh River of Ombay,

which is so shoale and foul, that men cannot go in there with ships, except
they be small, and also the Russes are not willing they should come there; for
not to spoil their Salmon-fishing, there is great store of Salmon caught,
which is carried from thence with boats to the ships in the salt river.

From thence the coast lies somewhat along westsouthwest and then upon

THE THIRD BOOK Of the new LIGHTING COLOMNE, OR SEA-MIRROVR, OF THE EASTERN,
and NORTHERN NAVIGATION. Containing The Description of Yce-land, Green-land, or
the Straits of David: likewise the situation of John Mayens Island; and
Spits-bergen: Also the situation of Candenoes eastward, through Wey-gats, to
the Tartarish or Yce-Sea.
The first Demonstration, Wherein Is shovved the passages betvveen Hitland and
Yce-land; and from thence to the Straits of David, or the corner of old
Green-land, now called Staten-hoeck.
FRom hence, or out of Texel to Hitland is the course well enough known to
(almost) all kind of Mariners. But when ye will sail from Hitland to
Yce-land, How a man must sail from Hitland to Yce-land.
your course must be from the South-end of Hitland to the South-west-corner of
Yceland, leaving West-Mana Islands on your right hand: the course is west
north-westward, a half stroke westerly; and east-south-east, a half stroke
easterly, the matter of an hundred fourscore and fifteen dutch miles.

Sailing from the south-west-corner of Yce-land, ye must sail northward on
alongs the wall, the matter of five miles till ye come to the clift of
Rcykenesse; from thence east-south-east hard underland till ye come to the
haven of Hanifioert: Ye can scarcely know that there is a haven here till ye
come to the end of the farewater; but sailing all alongs the wall, till ye come
to a blind Rock A blind Rock.
standing in the middle of the water, and a little Island whereon there is a
house, then ye can see the Bay where the road is: Ye may sail on either side of
this blind Rock, but rather on the north as south side; and so running
inwardly till ye be right opposite to the house, there ye have a good road and
ancker-ground, Road and Anker-ground.
of three, four or five fathoms: Here ye need fear no kind of winds, the west
and west-north-west are the worst, but without danger, because of the clifts
that streatches themselves from the northwall: here ye can have good water
because of a stream that flows through between the mountains on the
north-wall. The Indwellers here be of a reasonable good condition, and brings
aboard fish, stockens and other commodities for a small price, they would
rather have linen as money for their wares; but above all they are most
desirous of burnt-wine. Ye can have here likewise sheep, milk and flesh for
other wares.

The matter of three miles northward from Hanifioert runs several warmwater
rivers into the sea, landwards in, those rivers are so hot that if ye should
put a piece of flesh on a flesh-hook, and let it hang in the water, it is able
to boil the flesh: but on the seashore these waters be lukewarm, so that ye
may either swim or bath your bodies into them.

The Straits of David.
He that would sail from hence, to wit, from the southwest-corner of Yce-land
to Fretum David's, he must set his course westward somewhat southerly, that he
may reach to the corner of the land, the which corner ye can see when ye are
the matter of six or eight miles from the land: coming thither ye can see the
Ice which lies there continually the whole year through: So that in case ye
should set your course more southwardly as is above mentioned, ye should not
attain to the cape. Therefore when ye see both the land and the Ice, ye must
sail along by the Ice, which shall lead you into the corner of the Straits.

The corner of the Strait lies just upon sixty grades benorth the Line, for
the Ice stretches himself according as the wall lies: and when ye come besouth
the Ice, about nine and fifty grades and five and twenty or thirty minutes,
sometimes somewhat southly, sometimes somewhat northly, so shall the Ice lie
north north-westward from you, alike as the wall the Straitward in lies, to
the hight of threescore three grades, and then lies the wall right northward,
till over the threescore six grades and thirty minutes; and then ye come into
the narrow of the Strait, which is about thirty miles broad; till ye come to
the hight of one and seventie grades and thirty minutes: and then ye come in
an open room Sea lying north-west, running round northward toward the east,
and from thence southward again to the above mentioned narrowness.

This Sea runs northward to the hight of seventie and nine grades, where it is
closed by fast land; with a great many bays and rivers most part full of Ice,
which because of the ebbing and falling of waters is driven through the
narrowness of the Strait into the north-Sea, and from thence unto the coasts
of Terra Nova, Terra Nova.
into the great-bay of St. Laurence, after and on the west side of Terra Nova.

The inhabitants of this land on both sides of the Strait, are heathens and
wild men: and therefore are not to be trusted though they give never so many
tokens of friendship. Whatsoever they handle or change with you, they lay it on
the oars wherewith they row their Canoe, they trust no body, and therefore
are not to be trusted, for as aforesaid they lay their wares on their oars and
so delivers it to you. When ye are resolved to go on land, ye must be well
armed, and especially with muskets, for as for swords or Sabels they care not,
because they can reach you with their arrows, or with their Slinges ere ye can
come near them; but if ye happen to kill one or two of them with musket
bullots, the rest should in haste flee from you to their mountains where they
have their abode.

This land from old Green-land be north Yce-land lying southward to the cape or
Staten-hoeck, Staten-hoeck.
and from that corner all along to Fretum David's, and all round about that
inward-sea, is it altogether a fast land, and joined to America, until the
north and north-east of Yce-land; yet it is the opinion of some men, (as
likewise of my self) that it is joined to Spits-bergen, and that because of the
rivers which come from the north foreby Spits-bergen, which rivers ye can
perceive when ye are on the highth of fourscore and three grades, and because
they ebb toward the north, it may be believed that there is a passage, but as
yet unknown.

To know the Land.
Ye can see the south-east coast of Green-land when ye are the matter of six or
eight miles from it; and when ye see it, then ye are hard by the Ice.

Of the Tides and flowing of Streams.
The Streams or rivers come out of the north from Spits-bergen, and flows
alongs Green-land.

They ebb on fourscore and three grades toward the north, and flows toward
the South.

Situation and Courses.

The Heights.
The Cape of Old-Green-land or Staten-hoeck lies on 60 grades The
south-west-corner of Yce-land lies on seventie four grades and 5 minutes. The
Mouth of the Strait of David lies on 71 grades.
THE SECOND DEMONSTRATION which Contains the description of JOHN MAYENS
ISLAND.
John Mayens Island lies from Hitland northward, according to the common
Hollands Compass; or as others say north northwest upon the half stroke: yet it
is better to sail somewhat westlier as to fall a little eastly, because they
must be on the west side of the Neering, for if they fall easterly then they
must needs sail about the north of the same, where they have too great
calmnesse, and sometimes whirlwindes, that fall in a sudden from the mountain
called the Beeren-berg, or in English called the Bears-mountain.

In the Spring of the year on the east side of this Island is not so much ice
as on the north-side. For the sea on the north side, (which is never above ten
miles navigable) is in the Spring commonly always frozen.

The wind blows there commonly out of the Southwest, both harder and oftener
as out of any other place.

In the South-bay, a south-south-east and a north-northwest moon (according to
the common compass) makes a full Sea. The flood flows there from the south
toward the north, and ebbes contrarily.

The first day of August (at the north-end of the aforesaid Island) did the Sun
rise in the northeast with the one half of his body under and the other half
above the Horizon: and the last day of July was he wholly under.

On the North-end of this Island is a very high mountain commonly called the
Bears-mountain, The Bears-mountain.
the which, if ye behold it from the north, seems to be cloven, but if ye
behold it from the east or west side, it seems round, falling as it were
smoothly downward, except at the northeast corner, where it stretches it self
outward.

The North-corner is hilly and rough, it seems somewhat low because of the
high ground that lies about it: from thence the matter of half a mile
southward the coast is hilly, stay and shallow, so far from the wall as a
little canon can carry, is it about 20 fathoms deep: a little more southward is
there a small foot-strand of stony ground, so that upon some places ye could
make shift to bring your chaloup or boat, and this stretches it self the matter
of a mile in length southward.

In or upon this strand there are three Yce-hills The three Yce-hils.
high and stay, those are congealed of the snowwater which falls in the
sommertime from the top of the mountain, two of them lies near to the North-end
of the shore.

From thence further southward is the wall for the matter of a quarter of a
mile, (or scarce so much) hilly and stay, as it is at the north-end, and from
thence is there another shore about half a mile in length, thereon likewise can
ye bring your boat.

From thence come we to the Southeast-corner of the Beats-mountain, which is
likewise hilly and stay as the aforesaid wall, so that it is impossible to come
up on it, at some places higher other some lower, oneven, it is commonly 25 or
30 fathoms high from the water, and within goes it in some place somewhat stay
upward to the Bears-mountain.

At this corner lie some little rocks separated from the land, whereon are a
great many of several sorts of fowls, ye can row to and about these rocks with
your boat: A little about this corner there lie likewise such rocks without the
wall, Diverse rocks.
between these rocks there is a commodious haven, with a little Sand-bay,
Sand-bay.
where ye can easily bring up your boat whilst ye anchor; there ye are freed
from the sea, for it is there commonly calm water, although it storms without.
Ye cannot perceive that there is a haven there till ye be within the rocks;
from these rocks westward about a short mile, is the wall stay and rockie as
before, yet not so high, all alongs the coast is there many sharp rocks
standing as it were out of the wall: from the land off, as well by the shore as
by the stay wall, the matter of a musket shot, or thereabout ye have water
some sixty fathoms deep.

When ye have passed this stay shore, then ye come to a flat ground of black
sand, which is about a mile in length, about a little canon-shot from the wall,
ye have six fathoms water with black sand on the ground, this strand is
commonly called the great Hout-bay, The great Hout-bay.
or Wood-bay, because there is sometimes found much old broken wood: hereby
landwards in lies diverse flat hills of black The black hill.
earth and few stones, here is the land at his smalest, for being on the top of
this hill, and ships sailing on every side of it, ye could make them hear your
voice both at once.

Westward from the end of this great Hout-bay, where the land lies south-west
to the south, is there another rockie wall, alike to the aforesaid, so far as a
piece of canon can carry, further have ye another flat, called the small
Hout-bay, The small Hout-bay.
with an even shore like to the first.

A quarter of a mile Seawards in, by the South-end of that small Hout-bay,
there lies a rock, which to look to seems to be a ship with topsails up: A
rock like a ship with topsails.
hereabouts is it flat water.

Southward from this small Hout-bay, there lie many rocks and hills in the sea,
there is likewise a stay rockie wall; between this wall and the rocks is a
passage that runs in sea south south-east on, called the Bears-gat, The
Bears-gat.
where within four fathoms ye have stonie-ground. Ships could come in to ly
there, but there is no anker-ground.

A mile and a half southwest southerly from the aforesaid rock that seems
like to be a ship, there lies another rock of that same fashion, yet not so
sharp above as the other, this lies but a small canon-shot from the land:
besides this there are many other little rocks (whereon are abundance of fowls)
standing out in a corner: between this and the Bears-gat is the wall rough and
rockie, and sometimes here and there small foot-strands whereon ye cannot come
with your boat: and from thence begins the land to be higher and stonier, for
from the aforesaid corner Seawards in it is rockie and stony, and landwards in
full of hills and mountains; in time of need ye may bring your boat to the foot
of the hills: half a mile further there lies more such rocks, stayly
descending to the water; alongs the shore, so far from land as a small piece of
canon can carry, it is commonly fifty or sixty fathoms deep.

The matter of three miles south and to eastward, from the south or
west-corner, there lies a stone, A Stone.
which at the undeepest has about eleven foot of water, which stone in circuit
is about so big as a man can throw a small-stone.

Lucas Bouwenson from Delfs-Haven has with calm water broken the ruder of his
ship there on; about this stonegoeth commonly a hollow water.

The length of half a mile northeastward from this stone ye have uneven ground,
for casting your sound-lead one time ye can have but seven fathoms, and at the
other time ye can sound five and thirty: from this stone toward the land
falls the ground by degrees off to the depth of six and thirty fathoms and
deeper, yea so far from the wall as a small piece of canon can carry ye have
fourscore fathoms water, with soft clay-ground: but about the stone the ground
is stony and sandy.

Claes Dirckson Seyn from Wijck wrote in the year after our redemption 1616.
that about eleven or twelve miles south south-east from the South-corner of
the Island, he found 35 or 36 fathoms, with black moulie sand, and small
stones.

John Sybrantson Pael-man writes, that south-eastward from the south-east
corner of the Island about two miles he found rockie ground, my neighbor had
once 60, and I had but 30 fathoms, so that it is very uneven there.

About a quarter of a mile northwestward from the South-corner, there stands a
rock high above water, with sundry other little rocks by him, which are
commonly called the seven or five rocks, The seven or five rocks.
when ye come from the north ye can easily pass through between them: hard by
the land there lies a Holmken Holmken.
a little above water.

From these seven or five rocks till near under the wall dries it up from
thirty to five fathoms.

From the southwall north northwest a short mile the land falls out with a
corner, commonly called the Low-south-corner, The Lovv-south-corner.
on the shore is it low, and there lies the sloops that keeps watch.

Between the South-corner and this corner there are several infalls, with a
low shore, commodious for boats to come by, in the infalls is it sandy ground,
six or seven fathoms deep.

Between this and the South-corner lie some small rocks, some above and some
under water: from thence about two canon-shot is the land somewhat crooked to
an infall, which is commonly called, the Bocht of Guinea. The Bocht of Guinea.


From this aforesaid Bocht north-east northward about half a mile, come ye into
the South-bay, South-bay.
a lesser Bocht as the aforesaid, there were wont to stand ten tents in this
bay, for the handling of fish oil, but in one year the sea washed away three
tents, thirteen chaloups, tuns and oily-vessels, pertaining to the chamber of
Amsterdam, it washed away likewise most of the ground whereon they stood,
wherefore those from Amsterdam did delve a large piece of ground the summer
following, whereon they have set two tents.

Before this Bay ye have from nine to fifteen and so forth to eighteen fathoms,
with black sandie-ground, a little further off ye have five and twenty, yea
thirty fathoms, with short stony ground; and again so far as a small piece of
canon can reach ye have fourscore fathoms, and soft ground.

Between the Bocht of Guinea and the South-bay the wall is very stay, stony,
and rockie: when ye ly on fifteen fathoms before this South-bay, then ye can see
through between the land and the Fowlie-rock, or Vogel-klip.

Some two canon-shot from this Fowlie-rock Fovvlie-rock.
into the Bocht there lies a small rock; and on land there is a Red-hill;
Red-hill.
in the aforesaid Bocht there lies a channel, whereon ye may lay four or five
chaloups.

The matter of a mile north-eastward from the South-bay, ye shall find a
little corner, then ye have a gate or entry where ye can row through from the
mountains into a Kolk or depth, there ye have so much room as to lay some
twenty chaloups on; and it is very convenient for the waiting on whales: this
is called of Seamen the Hoepstocks-Bay. The Hoepstocks-Bay.


A large canon-shot from this Hoepstocks-Bay ye shall find a corner where
there are many small rocks, (which are called the Rudsen The Rudsen.
) from thence to the Red-hill the wall is rockie and stony.

The matter of a mile north-east northerlie from the aforesaid Rudsen, there is
an outlying corner, commonly called the Walrush-gate, VValrush-gate.
without or rather at the which there lies the Briellish-steepel, between
these two the land has a great infall, which is commonly called North-bay, and
is the most convenient place of all for the handling of fish-oile.

A quarter of a mile from these Rudsen or small rocks toward the Bocht, there
is a flat place, North-Bay.
which is called the Wood-bay, VVood-bay.
because of this flat the land lies high, this flat is a short quarter of a
mile large, between this and the Walrush-gate there lies a great flat Channel,
whereon lie all the tents and kettles of the chambers of Holland and Zeeland:
this Bocht has a flat sandie-ground, where the ships may lie at anchor on
fifteen or sixteen fathoms water, about a canon-shot from land. In the
fore-sommer the ships lie near on land within the Bay on eight or nine fathoms
water.

From the Briellish-steepel the land lies eastward up, and has for a mile
flat strand, which is very convenient for chaloups to keep watch: the aforesaid
corner of the Walrush-gate is very high and stay toward the sea; at the end of
the aforesaid mile, ye find nothing but rockie stay land without any strand,
(and which is worthy to be made mention of) a canon-shot from thence ye have a
stone, on the fashion of a steepel.

At the end of this aforesaid land a little foreby the steeple, there ye find
a little infall, which is called Mary-Mus-bay, The Mary-Mus-bay.
because that Mary Mus from Rotterdam, of happy memory, was the first that
ever sent a ship there to boil oil: there is a very commodious anker-ground;
for about a canon-shot from land, ye have five, six, or eight fathoms water:
and a far way Seawards in ye have smooth water, likewise ye have a shore fit
for all kind of commodities useable for boiling of fish.

A little landwards in ye have a pool, whereout ye can take fish, yea, ye can
bring your boat from shore into that same pool.

From the east-corner of Mary-Mus-bay the foot of the mountains streatches
themselves in sea, very stay and high toward the west strand or shore.

From the foot of these mountains, setting your course north-east northerly for
the matter of a quarter of a mile, ye have a flat shore, where aforetimes there
has stood a cross on a grave: between those two the land has a great infall;
and hard under wall a stony ground; the wall of it self is flat and sandy, so
that a man might have occasion on several places to boil fish.

The Northwest Corner.

De Noord-westhoec van IAN MAYEN Eylandt.



BEsides this aforesaid Bay two musket shot from land, ye have nine fathoms
depth; off-falling ground to the seventeenth fathom: about a musket shot
further ye have good single sandy ground: but when ye come to have five and
twenty, thirty, or fifty fathoms, there ye have foul stony ground, which
continues till ye come so far in Sea, that ye can see both the corners of the
land: half a mile from the land ye loose the stonie-ground; and again hard
under land, where ye can see the ground, is it stony.

From the cross to the next Yce-hill, is it overall flat sandy ground, and in
some places stony, it is about half a mile broad, and some places are fit to
lay your boats on that keeps watch, but it is not convenient for ankering of
ships, for deepnesse.

From the northwest corner toward the east ye have a stony and stay wall, a
quarter of a mile in length, where ye find a convenient little bay, whereon ye
may set one kettle to boil fish in: but because a short canon-shot from thence
it is well 300 fathoms deep, therefore it is inconvenient for ships to ly there.

From thence runs the wall, well a half mile in length, eastwardly up; at the
end whereof there is a little bay, where ye could set a kettle and lay a boat
on watch, but a short canon shot from the land, is it well three hundred
fathoms deep.

From thence to the north-corner, which is half a mile, on the shore is it
stony, knottie and stay.

On the north-side of this Island the ice lies sometimes so near, that if ye
would sail from hence to Spitsbergen, ye should be forced to set your course
forty, five and forty, yea sometimes fifty miles, northerly about; and
sometimes ye can sail right northwards from this Island well five and forty or
fifty miles, to the height of 75 grades norther breadth, before ye can see any
Ice.

By fair and clear weather ye can see the Bears-mountain when ye are thirty
miles from it. Now adays there are not so many fish taken about this Island as
was wont, because they run now more toward the north then they used to do.

At John Mayens Island the veriation is a stroke and a half northwestward.

Of the Tides and flowing of Streams.
In the South-bay a south southeast and north northwest Moon, according to the
Hollands compass makes high water: the flood flows from the south running
northwards, and ebbes contrarily.

The third Demonstration, Containing The situation of the Bears Island, the
Hoopen Island, as also of whole Spits-bergen for so much as they are northerly
and easterly known as yet.
WHen ye come from the North-cape to the Bears-Island, The Bears-Island.
your course is north northwest and north-west northerly, about 54 or 55 miles,
Syroy Syroy.
then lies right north northwest from the Bears-Island. (Upon the aforesaid
North-cape there are people who lives till they be seventy or fourscore years
old, they never eat any bread, for they live on fish and flesh.)

The Indwellers of the North-cape toward Finmarken say, that that Bay never
freeses, so that they get their living most by taking of fish and drying the
same.

The Bears-Island is reasonable high, ye can row about it in the space of six
hours; at the north-west corner thereof coming within three miles to it, ye can
find ground of forty fathoms, and how nearer the land ye come how undeeper
it is, for within a canon shot to it ye are on 15 fathoms.

Out of the Bears-Island ye can have refreshment of waters although it were for
an hundred ships: there grows likewise brave herbs, whereof ye can make
salate, which refreshes a man extraordinarily: there are also many fowls: ye
find there coals to burn, not unlike to the Scots coals.

At the northeast corner there lies a little Bay, where ye can ly safe after a
little Island, cornerwindes from east southeast to west southwest blows flat
into this bay, but as for other winds ye ly safe; ye can come into this bay at
the south side thereof, at the north-side it is almost fast to a great Island,
except a narrow passage where ye can come handsomely through with a chaloup;
hereabouts is no other Inham to run into in time of storm, but round about ye
have anker-ground; yet ye must ly in open Sea, the ground is durtie, and there
goes a hollow Sea, so that it is not good to anchor there in time of storm: the
flood flows commonly from the south-west toward the northeast: a southwest
and northeast moon make high water: and it flows commonly four foot up and
down. At the time of year ye can take good kods, and haddoks at the
Bears-Island.

The East-coast of Spitsbergen.
FRom the Bears-Island to Hoopen-Island, The Hoopen-Island.
the course is north-east northerly as is suspected two and thirty miles; the
Island is seven or eight miles in length, and not above three musket shot
broad, it lies east north-east, and west southwest, at both sides, so well at
the south as the north: but on the north side alongs the whole Island ye have
good anker-ground, on twenty fathoms, a great half mile from land, on the
southwest end and the northeast end ye have some flat ground, where the
Walrushes use to come, otherwise it is overall stay and ragged, but on the
southside it is overall stony and rockie, and not fit for ankering, of which
ye must take heed: yet ye may sail within half a mile alongs the coast without
danger, but there is nothing on this Island that serves for refreshment.

There has been some who have sailed beyond the Hoopen-Island east
north-eastward 24 miles, but found no land, found abundance of ice, and could
reach no ground.

The Hoopen-Island appears to you as five mountains, whereof the northeast
end is the highest.

At the northeast end of Hoopen-Island there is a valley well a quarter of a
mile in circuit, whereon resorts a great number of Walrushes, yea sometimes it
lies whole full of them: there are likewise an innumerable number of Sea-mews
and other Sea fowls, they fly sometimes in such multitudes, that they hinder
you from the sight of the firmament above your head; so that the land is well
enough to be known by the off and on flying of those fowls seeking food for
their young ones.

From the northeast corner of Hoopen-Island to Black-point, the course is north
westerly, some ten miles; but before ye come to Black-point, on the southeast
side there lies a great many small Islands; from the mast of your ship ye can
tell sixty of them, but indeed there are so many as if they were sown, and
that all alongs the coast so far as ye can see; and that toward the northeast
and west northwest, as we suspect, altogether stones and rocks.

When Black-point Black-point.
is four miles north easterly from you, you see a great Island, in comparison
of the other: when ye are a large musket shot on the south side of this
Island, ye ly on thirty fathoms stitch-ground, it is a stay ground, for the
length of a ship more Seawards in, ye have 60 fathoms; within the aforesaid
Islands toward land, ye can see open in Sea, where the Islands are not so
close together.

A mile further east from the aforesaid great Island, without the low Islands,
there lies a great many blindes in Sea, where ye can have no anker-ground, the
Sea beats much on those blindes when it is high water, yet there is no great
flood.

On the northeast corner of Hoopen-Island there goes as strong a stream as
there does in Texel, the flood comes from the south southwest and runs along
the land. A south-southwest wind makes there the highest water: on the
aforesaid Island is no refreshment to begot, (so far as is yet known, but is
all stony low land: neither can ye see the aforesaid Islands from far. But
Black-point is a very high land, so that when it is fair weather ye can see it
from Hoopen-Island: thereabout ye have thick mists: yea sometimes for the space
of five or six days, ye see not once the Sun, but all thick cold mist.

From Black-point, so lies the coast eastward on, northeast up, so far as ye
can see, to Wijbben Iansons water west northwest, but the whole coast along
lies full of rocks and little Islands, the flood comes out of the south-west
by the Cape on the east side of Look-out, and runs northeastwardly up to
Wijbben Jansons water.

Ye can scarcely lay on by the east side of the Cape Look-out, because of the
Ice that comes from the east of Nova Sembla, and runs along the coast, (as if
it were fast land) like to a bank, so that ye can scarcely come through.

The West-coast of Spits-Bergen.
Look-out, or Kijck^^^.
FRom the Bears-Island to the Cape Lookout or the south corner of Spits-Bergen,
is the course north northwest somewhat westly, about eight and twenty miles.

There lies a stony channel on the southeast cape of Look-out Seawards in well
four miles in length, on some places when the water rages ye can see it beat on
the channel, ye can sail through between this channel and the land, but with
great danger.

From the cape Look-out to the south-end of the foreland, the course is north
northwest six or seven and twenty miles; between both lies Hoorn-zond,
Klock-bay or Belzond, and Yce-zond.

From the cape Look-out to Hoorn-zond the course is north northwest six miles:
it is betvveen both stony and foul ground.

The Hoorn-zond Hoorn-zond.
is a wide bay, and lies without danger of all kind of winds: The English
have their tents standing there, and comes every year to take fish.

Between Hoorn-zond and Klock-river (by others called Belzond, Bel-zond.
) lies the coast northwards westerly and north northwest, all alongs the coast
it is stony and foul, and full of rocks and craigs.

Within the Bel-zond lies sundry rivers and havens, and a little within the
corner on the north side, lies Willem van Muyens haven, VVillem van Muyens
haven.
(that is so called, because Willem van Muyen had fisht there aforetimes) a
little northwards up runs a river landvvards in, which is called the undeep
river, The undeep river.
whereon lies the cold harbor, where aforetimes there have stood some tents: a
little more southerly lies Michel Rinders river, and more southerly from the
aforesaid river lies Sardammer-river, which runs a great way landwards in.

From the Sardammer-river westward, or sailende in through Klock-bay, a little
about the south corner there lies a fair harbor, which because of its
conveniencie is called the Fair-haven, The fair haven.
which is a brave road, and in time of need a man might keep a ship there
without anchor or tow: it is a clean slipperie ground.

From the Klock-bay to Yce-zond lies the coast all northwesterly, and north
northwest, between these two it is durtie and foul, without any bochts or
Infalls, yet when ye come a little about the south corner ye find there the
Green harbor, there is a good road, and ye may freely anchor there, so hard
under the wall as ye please, and that on eight, ten or twelve fathoms water, it
is there every where a clean flat upgoing ground, and ye ly there befreed from
all sorts of winds.

When ye come a little about the north corner ye find the Safe haven, The Safe
haven.
which lies northward up, and sailing a quarter of a mile upward, ye come to a
good road, which is called the Safe-haven; the ground is somewhat stay but
clean, there ye may let anchor fall, on thirty fathoms, and ye ly secure from
all winds.

Farther eastward up, the fare-water runs so far up that never any boat yet
has been at the end of it; for it lies most commonly the whole summer
throughfull of Ice; but if ye shun this north-wall, there is no danger ye need
to fear.

The Yce-zond The Yce-zond.
is a wide river to come into, but when ye come into the Hoorn-zond or Safe
haven, or get into the Yce-zond, and when ye perceive that theyce begins to
come out of the south, ye must make haste to lift anchor, otherwise ye should be
besiedged with Ice, so that ye could not come forth, and chiefly in the
after-sommer.

Whilst ye sail this passage upward, ye shall find a great many Roes, of
which ye can take some: and all alongs the shore ye have such a multitude of
fowls on the rocks, where they breed their Young-ones, that by their dung the
rocks grow, as if it were green: there grows likewise a sort of herb, which is
called Slae, and is alike to scurvie-grasse, the which herb tastes even as
salate, and refreshes a man extremely.

From the Yce-zond to the south-corner of the Foreland, the coast lies
northwest, yet ye must shun the south-corner, because it is a little foul:
there lies a rock southwest from the la^d off seawards in, which is a quarter
of a mile long. The Foreland lies south and north from the south to the
north-corner, or fowlie corner, well fifeteen or sixteen miles in length: a mile
and a half benorth the south-corner of the Foreland there lies two Islands, the
one a canon shot from the other, and as far between them and the wall; on these
Islands there are many thousands of fowls like to Rotgeese, and drakes, there
are likewise a great multitude of eggs to be got: a great mile benorth there
lies a rock of clear white stones (under which there are many great ones) this
lies from the wall seawards in about a mile and a half: three miles beyond the
Persh-Rif, there lies a little Island near under the shore, where likewise are
many fowls and eggs to begot, between both it is reasonable clean, but toward
the wall lies some rocks, wherefore ye must take heed that ye come not too near
to the wall.

About the north-corner of the Foreland, between the maine land ye can cast
anchor on twenty, eighteen, fifeteen, ten, and four fathoms, according as ye
are far into it, but nearest the foreland.

At the fast land lies the Crosse-bay, Crosse-bay.
and somewhat forward southerly within the foreland, there lies the
English-bay, The English bay.
where the English come a fishing.

From the Fowl-corner or north corner of the foreland to the Danes-Island, the
course is northeast northerly, the matter of nine miles: under way lies
Madaleenen-bay, Madaleenen-bay.
where ye have a good road at the south-corner of the bay, but it is high stay
land, and we cast anchor commonly a little within the south-corner, yet ye may
sail a little farther in, and let the anchor fall at the north wall, for ye have
every where good ground on fifeteen, twenty and five and twenty fathoms.

The north-corner of the Madaleenen bay is the south-corner of the English-bay,
Which is stony and foul, and very dangerous for those that knows it not.

From the Madeleenen-bay to Robbe-bay, the course is north north east and south
southwest two miles, between those two there lies a low Island, which is called
the English-look-out, English look-out.
from whence a stony channel lies, in length of a canon shot: ye can come
through this channel, but with great danger.

From the Robbe-bay (which lies on the Danes-Island) to the south-bay, the
course is north north-east about half a mile, we sail commonly benorth the
south-corner of the south-bay, into the bay, but when ye come into the
south-bay, ye must shun the north-wall, for it is foul; in the incoming ye may
go somewhat near the northwall, and cast anchor on ten, fifeteen, sixteen or
twenty fathoms good ground, safe from all winds.

The Hollands or Maurits-Bay.


AT the north-corner of the South-Bay there lies four small Islands, of which
the uttermost is the greatest from the westmost part of those four Islands, to
the Hollands or Maurits bay, the course is east northeast a quarter of a mile,
if ye shun the rocks, ye need fear no danger, except some rocks, otherwise is
it a fair coast, for ye may ly at anchor under two several corners of this bay,
and that a canonshot or two from the wall as ye please, and that on fifteen,
eighteen or twenty fathoms: if ye sail a little south southeast in, ye can see
the Hollands ships lying at anchor before their tents: but if ye would sail to
them, ye must not come nearer the southwall as where ye have seven fathom
water: and then ye come first where the Amsterdams tents are, when ye are there
ye may go as near the wall as you please, yea if there come an Ice, ye may make
your tow fast on land, and need not fear any winds: then come ye to the tents
of the chamber of Middelburgh and Vlissing, likewise where the Danes and others
stands: From the westmost tent there runs a craig off, by the which ye cannot
come, it runs most the whole passage over; and then ye see flat out of the
South-Bay; on the south side of the before said craig there lies sundry little
Islands, as also many stones under water: it were possible to sail from hence
out of the South-Bay to Sea, but it must first be marked with beacons or tuns,
because it is a narrow passage: From the west-most tent out of the South-Bay is
about a mile in length, and is called the Amsterdams-Island, Amsterdams-Island.
because their tents stands there: the place where the tents stand, is about a
musket shot in breadth, after which runs a Kind of water or a still standing
pool.

East southeast and east northerly from the Amsterdams tents lie two
Yce-mountains hard on shore; sometimes the Ice comes down with such a force,
that they make the ships that lie before the tents to stir: The land within
the bay is very high and stay, as likewise it is by the Amsterdams and Danes
Island, although not so high.

At the South-corner of the Hollands-Bay lies a little Island hard under-wall,
called the Devils-Island; Devils-Island.
ye need not fear it, for ye may sail hard by it: From that same corner to the
Vogelsang, the course is east northeast a great mile: The Vogelsang is an
Island, clean round about, for ye may let anchor fall where ye will. From hence
east southeast a canonshot lies the Island met de kloof, or cloven Island: The
Cloven-Island.
so called, because the mountain that lies on shore is cloven, and lies
between the Vogelsang and the aforesaid Island.

Betvveen the fast land and the aforesaid Island, there lie diverse Islands,
who because of their multitude, are called Archepelliga; Archepelliga.
in these Islands are diverse roads to be found for those that are acquainted
there, but none to be had at the fast land.

From the cloven Island to the Island called the Zews-uytkijck, The
Zevvs-uytkijck.
(or Look-out:) the course is southeast easterly about half a mile: between
both there lies a little round Island, called the Geese-Island: The
Geese-Island.
when ye come thither ye must sail through betvveen this and the
Zevvs-kijck-uyt, keeping the Gansen-Island a canonshot from you seavvards in:
at the Zevvs-Island ye have good anker-ground and lies on 20 or 15 fathoms
good anker-ground.

That passage which runs betvveen the Islands and the fast land, ends betvveen
the Zevvs-Island and Moniers-bay: it is possible to sail through the
Hollands-bay, but only for those who are used with those passages.

From the Zevvs-uytkijck to Moniers-bay Moniers-bay.
is the course southeast a half mile, and the passage is almost a quarter of a
mile broad; and on the south side there lies a haven called the Eyer-(or egg)
haven: The egges-haven.
Moniers-bay is not fit to sail into, because it is stony foul and rockie, and
seldom used.

On the east side of the Zevvs-kijck-uyt, in the after-sommer, ye have often
south-west winds with great calmnesse; and in the fore-sommer northerly
winds; although ye have had a good gail at sea: how farther east so much
worse: the flood flows from the south toward the north all alongs the coast:
it flows well eight hours, and ebbes in less then four: All the Ye that
comes with an east wind from Nova-Sembla, comes with a great force along the
northcoast of the cape the Kijck-uyt, into the Hollandsbay; yea so hard that
the ships have enough to do to shun it; this is alvvayes so when ye have often
eastwindes in the fore-year; then it is driven to the west side of the cape the
Kijck-uyt, where the ye lies and swimmeth till it be driven by the
south-floud until the coast of the Fore-land, so that all the bays are filled
therewith, from thence it runs northward on, not knowing whether.

From Moniers-bay to the Red-bay, the coast lies east south-east four miles;
the coast is everywhere foul and stony, hard under Moniers-bay it is a low
land, yet by piece and piece climming upward to the Red-bay: The Red-bay.
the east-corner of Moniers-bay is called the Low-corner.

From the Red-bay to Reene-velt, the course is east south-east five miles; the
coast is not clean, yet ye get anker-ground on twenty or eighteen fathoms
alongs the Reene-velt, yet ye shall find no clean ground.

The Reene-velt The Reene-velt.
is low even ground, in the middle thereof lies a little round-hill, which
when it is from the south south-west from you, ye have all along the coast of
Reene-velt anker-ground, as is aforesaid.

On the east side of Reene-velt there runs a broad sail-water, called the
East-wijck, at the end of which never any has been as yet, this water runs
very far landwards in, and is well three miles broad: on the east-corner of the
Easter-wijck lies the Gray-corner, and lies from Reene-velt south-eastward
three miles, as is aforesaid. The Reene-velt lies from the outmost of the
Islands east south-east ten miles. From Reene-velt north-east northerly four
miles lies the Moffen-Island where are many Walrushes.

From the Gray-corner Gray-corner.
with a south-east course, ye sail to the South-easter-land on, over a bay
which is four miles broad, which bay runs south, and south south-west.

The Easter-land runs east north-east upward, but it is yet unknown how far, it
is a even lane, reasonable high, but of diverse sorts of earth, alike to
Spits-bergen, so that it is thought to be an Island.

The whole west coast of Spits-bergen is wholly high uneven land.

The difference at Spits-bergen is 22 grades north-westerly; when the Sun is
south south-west he is at the highest there, according to the Hollands compass.

In the fore-sommer ye have there commonly easterly, and in the after-sommer
southerly winds.

Likewise on the west coast of Spits-bergen in the fore-year ye have commonly
east and north-east, and in the after-year most southerly winds.

Of the Tides and flowing of Streams.
At the west-coast of Spits-bergen the tide keeps no constant course, but a
flood with a north-east and south-west moon makes the highest water; it
flows with a daily tide five and with a flood six foot.

A south-west and north-east moon makes highest water at the Bears-Island,
the flood comes commonly out of the south-west and flows toward the
south-east.

A south south-west and north north-east moon makes the highest water on the
north-east corner of Hoopen-Island, and it flows there as hard as in Texel:
it comes out from the south south-west, and runs along the coast to the Cape
the Kijck-uyt: the stream flows from south-west north-eastward to Wijbbe
Jansons water.

On the east side of the Zews-uytkijck comes the stream from the south, and
runs to the north; it flows eight hours, and ebbes scarce four.

Of the Depths.
At the north-west-corner of the Bears-Island ye have forty fathoms, and
dries more and more up till ye be within a canon-shot of land where ye have
fifteen fathoms water.

Situation and Courses.
From the North-cape to the Bears-Island the course is north north-west, and
north-west westerly, 54 or 55 miles. From Suroy to the Bears-Island north
north-west 50 miles. From the Bears-Island to Hoopen-Island, north north-east

north north-east half a mile. From Devils-Island to the Vogel-sang, east
north-east a large mile. From the Vogel-sang to the Zews-Uyt-kijck, south-east
easterly a large mile. From the Zews-Uyt-kijck to Moniers-bay, south-east half
a mile. From Moniers-bay to the Red-bay the course is east south-east 4 miles.
From the Red-bay to Reene-velt east south-east 5 miles. From Reene-velt to the
Gray-corner south-east 3 miles From Reene-velt to the Moffen-Island, north-east
northerly 4 miles.
The Hights.
The Bears-Island lies on four and seventie grades and a half.

The Cape the Kijck-uyt lies on six and seventie grades and six and thirty
minutes.

The north-corner of the Foreland lies on nine and seventy grades twenty
minutes.

The fourth Demonstration, Containing A Description of Orlogenes from the Cape
of Candenoes to the west-coast of Nova Sembla and the Weygat.
ORlogenoes and the cape Candenoes Candenoes.
lies severally north east and southwest 35 miles. The corner of Candenoes is
well enough known; there stands 5 great crosses up for tokens, which when ye
come by, ye can perfectly perceive that the land fails you, on the one side
south-west toward the White sea, and on the other side south-east.

About ten miles easterly from Cabo de Candenoes, there lies an Island called
Morsonowits, Morsonovvits.
from thence easterly there lies a great Inham landward in, which is a flat
undeep water, withal a deceitful ground. There has been diverse ships who
have saild amiss here, thinking that they had been in the mouth of the
Whitesea, therefore it is necessary to learn to distinguish the land, for the
Russish coast eastward Candenoes is very sandy, and a flat shore; and the
coast of Lapland is high, and full of mountains. Into this Inham there runs a
river from the land, through the which ye can come in boats to the White sea.

Besides this Inham about twenty miles east and east southerly from Candenoes,
there lies an Island called Colgoya, Colgoya.
which is ten miles in length; ye may sail round about it, but on the
south side thereof lies a craig which comes from the east, that ye must shun,
because it joins to the west end of this Island. There are a great many geese
on this Island, which in the summer time are wholly naked having no kind of
feathers; they lay their egg under their stump or tail, and on that fashion
breeds forth their young ones: there are such multitudes of those geese there,
that the Russes comes with their Lodges or boats to land, and takes of them by
multitudes, and salts them in tuns.

From the Candenoes to the Island Tussara Tussara.
the course is east south-east 32 miles, and between both lies this great ham.
On the west side of Tussara lies the corner of Swelgenoes. Svvelgenoes.
From Tussara to the river of Colcova Colcova.
the course is eastward five miles, that is a good river, and some twelve foot
deep, there is no other traffic there but that the Russes comes from Colmogro
and St. Niclaes with their lodges to change their wares for rough skins.

Five miles eastward from the river Colcova lies the river Pitsana, Pitsana.
which is but six foot deep, and is not well known, a little westerly from this
lies a dry bank which ye must shun. Olivier Brunel coming from Nova Sembla
sat here on ground.

Ten miles eastward from Pitsana lies the river Pitsora, Pitsora.
that runs by the east-corner in, south south-east, and is deep six Holland
yards: the land there is low and sandy, on the west-corner there stands a
Pack-house whereon stands some crosses; when ye come within the river, turn a
little westward up toward the Pack-house, and let anchor fall on three or four
fathoms water, there is a great poole or lake.

Ye must shun the east side of the river, for it is full of sand and banks. The
town of Pitsora lies 26 Dutch miles landward in: there is abundance of costly
skins and cristall.

Between Pitsora and Way-gats lies Oltgijn, Oltgijn.
and without on the land lies two rocks or little Islands, the one called
Oranjen, and the other Graef Maurits: there ye may ly at anchor on six or seven
fathoms. From the south side there comes a sandbed off-falling, where ye have
but three fathoms. On the east and west side of these two Islands there is a
great Inham, flat water; the land lies there in the round to the corner of
Pitsora, all in one Inham: it is from Pitsora to Way-gats north-east easterly
24 miles.

Way-gats, VVay-gats.
which is likewise called the Strait of Nassowen, is a narrow passage through
which ye can sail into the Tartarish sea. It lies first easterly, and then
north-east the matter of six or seven miles, about midway there lies an Island
which ye can sail by on both sides. A little within the corner on the
north-side is a brave bay, Traen-bay.
into the which ye can let anchor fall so deep as ye please, to wit on five,
four or three fathoms, good strong ground; toward the east wall ye have the
deepest water, and ye ly there safe from all winds or Yee-flouds. It has been
assayed at two several times to find away through this Strait, to sail
be-north Tartarie to come to the rich Kingdoms of Cathy and China, and from
thence to Molucquen; but all in vain, because of the great Ye that lies there
the whole year, and never melts, by reason of the constant cold.

From the east end of the Strait Way-gats to the Inham of Oby, Oby.
the course is east south-east and south-east easterly thirty miles. On the
east side hereof the land lies north-east thirty miles more, to the two
norther rivers, and from thence northeast, but how far, is not as yet known

The west-coast of Nova Sembla Nova Sembla.
lies from Way-gat northward to Constint-zarck, north-west about forty
miles. Benorth this falls it north easterly-ward to the corner of Langenesse or
the Staten-hoeck (or States corner) and so forth north north-east, north-east
and east north-east to the Islands of Oranje; the northmost part of Nova Sembla
lies on the height of 77 grades and an half.

Of the Tides and flowing of Streams.
From the east side of Candenoes to the Island of Colgoyen, the stream falls
east and east southerly, as likewise along that same Island; From Colgoyen to
Way-gats falls the stream east and west. Alongs Nova Sembla the streams turns
about with the moon. Alongs Rusland they come from between Candenoes and
Pitsora out of the west and west north-west, and so runs alongs Rusland.

The streams that comes to Way-gats comes from Colgoyen and Nova Sembla, and
falls with the rest east northerly through the Strait of Way-gats to the river
Oby, so by this means the flowing and ebbing of the streams keeps the passages
of Way-gats open, so that they are often without Ice, except boards of Ice that
come from other places driving. But on the east side of Way-gats the flood
comes from the north-east, and falls in the Oby and Strait of Nassow. The water
flows and ebbs there, but keeps no constant course.

Of the depths and grounds, so well on the east as vvest-side of VVay-gat.
Along the whole coast from Candenoes to Way-gats, it is a flat upgoing ground,
most sand and fast ground. If it be mistie weather and if ye have eight or nine
fathoms water, then ye must know that ye are but three or four miles from the
coast: but if ye have 30 or 35 or 40 fathoms, then ye are far enough from land:
so is it likewise alongs Nova Sembla, and over the east side of Way-gats, but
when ye come into the mouth it grows flatter.

The first part of the New LIGHTNING SEA COLUMN, OR SEA MIRROR. THE THIRD
BOOK, Of the EASTERN NAVIGATION Containing The Description of the whole
East-Sea.
The first Demonstration, Where in Are described the Sea-Coastes of Falsterborn
to Schenckenes, and from the Island Rugen to Ryghs-head.
HOw men shall sail about the riff off Fasterborn hat been here before
rehearsed. The coast from Fasterborn eastwards lies most east and east and by
north. First from Fasterborn to Elburgh Elburgh.
are three leagues. If you will anchor before Elburgh, then bring the Cloister
and the Church within a fathom or a fathom and a half near one to the other,
and sail so right in unto the town, you may anchor by it in 4, 3 or 2 fathom
and a half.

From Elburgh to Uytstede are 7 or 8 leagues. Betwixt them both about 3 leagues
to the eastwards of Elburgh, and 5 leagues to the westwards of Uytstee Uytstee.
is a point, off from which lies a shoale, come no nearer it then 8 or 9
fathom. Uytstee lies in a bight, and has a high sharp steeple. If you be
bound thither, then bring the steeple north from you, and then sail in right
with it toward the strand; there stands a red tiled house to the eastwards
of the bridge, bring that house and the end of the bridge one in the other, and
sail in so, and run to the westwardes of the bridge, anchor there in 3
fathom, or two foot less, there is clean sand-ground. When you come from the
west, and are past that foresaid shoale then you may boldly run along by
the shore in 3 fathom and an half, without fear.

Three leagues to the eastwards of Uytstee lies a high point called
Goessebeer, Goesbeer.
from thence to Sandhammer is a league.

From the point of Goessebeer runs off a great shoale far to seawards, and
lies along the coast, unto near Sandhammer, you may sound it in six, eight,
and ten fathom, as you will. When you run over it in ten fathom, then lies
the north-end of Bruntholm about east and by south from you, and the point of
Sandhammer north. Under the Sand-hammer Sand-hamer.
is good anchoring for a west, westsouthwest, westnorthwest, and northwest
wind, in five or six fathom. When you come out of the northeast, you may
run along by this coast, with a northwest wind, in 7, 8, 9, or 12 fathom,
unttill past Goesbeer, for to avoid Brunt-holm.

The point of Goesbeer and the north end of Bruntholm lie northwest and by west
and southeast and by east about five leagues asunder, but Uytstee and the
foresaid north end off Bruntholm lies westnorthwest and eastsoutheast 9
leagues assunder.

For to sail from Falsterborne about to the northwards of Bruntholme you must
go on east, so long until that you have the length of Uytstee, then forth east
and by north, and then you shall sail yet near enough to the point and shoale
of Goesbeer, come no nearer it then seven or eight fathom. But to sail From
Fasterborn to the southwards of Brontholm, the course is east and by south
somewhat southerly two and twenty or three and twenty leagues, and along the
south side off Brontholme eastsoutheast.

The Island Brontholm Brontholm.
is clean round about, except on the southeast point, there runs off a foul
riffe, called Brewers rif, which men must avoid. On the northeast side you may
run along by it upon your lead, without doing amiss, in 12 or 13 fathom,
and along the southwest side in 8 or 9 fathom.

Men may anchor round about Brontholm, Road under Brontholm.
at diverse places, as before Rottum, and to the northwards, before the Castle,
thwart of Sandwick, Suaux and Nex.

Before the Village, betwixt Rottum, Rottum.
and the castle that stands upon the northwest point, is good anchoring for
an east or northeast wind, in thirteen, fourteen, and fifiteen fathom, but not
very clean ground.

Thwart of the Castle it is good lying for an eastnortheast, east, and
eastsoutheast wind in 18 and 20 and also 14 and 15 fathom, sand ground, but
nearer the shore the ground is not vary clean, the nearer to the shore the
fouler ground.

Under the northwest point before Sandwick Sandwick
there is good anchoring for southwest winds, and you may come near unto that
point. From the northwest point to the other point the shore lies
eastsoutheast and westnorthwest.

On the east side is good anchoring before Suaux and Nex: but before Nex it is
not very clean. By Nex Nex.
runs off a little riffe from the shore, which is steep on both sides: but
if you come no nearer it then in ten fathom, you can take no hurt of it: to
the northwardes of Nex lies also a great rock. He that will anchor before Nex,
let him anchor so that the flat steeple which stands above Nex, do stand
betwixt the w. and w. and by s. from him, and that the north point be north
and by west, and the south point be southsouthwest from him, there it is two
and twenty fathom deep, and clean sand-ground. At many other places it is
otherwise stony and rough ground, with southwest and west winds you have there
a weather shore.

The Eertholmes lie from the north-end off Bruntholm east and by north and west
and by south three leagues asunder, and from the southeast end south and north
five leagues. In the Eertholms is a little Haven, but by reason that is not
used it is unknown.

Betwixt the north point of Bruntholm Shoale by Bruntholm.
and the point of Sand-hammer, but nearest to Bruntholm lies a shoale of six
fathom, where sometimes Fishermen do lie to fish it is not very great, but
hard stony ground.

From Sandhammer the coast lies northnortheast and north and by east two
leagues to Somer-haven, this is a round bay, within it is very good anchor
ground. From thence the coast lies about north 6 leagues unto Ahuys. From the
north point of Brontholm to Ahuys, the course is north somewhat westerly about
13 or 14 leagues. But to Hanno north, and by east 13 or 14 leagues.

Ahuys lies upon a river, where sometimes is before the town 10, or 11, and
sometimes also no more then 4 or 5 foot water, according as the water comes
off out of the land, upon it is a great fishing, where in the summer time are
great store of good Else taken. To the eastwardes of the mouth of the River
runs off a stony flat from the shore, and to the southwards of the river a
foul stony riffe, right off from the shore along by the foresaid flat, so
that there lies in a channel betwixt the foresaid flat, and riffe, which is
called the Eastergat.

Through this foresaid riffe lies in a channel until into the Eastergat, on
against the slatte, which is called the Southergat. If you will sail into this
southergat, coming from the southwards, then run to the west shore to the
southwards of Ahuys, until you come in 5 or 6 fathom, and then you shall see
upon the north shore, north and by west or somewhat more westerly from you, a
cape or beacon standing a little from the strand within the land, of fashion
like a mill without wings: Bring this beacon to the west side of the high Hill,
which lies somewhat further into the Land, to wit, even in the going off the
highest of the hill, keep these marks so standing, and sail in right with
them, until that Ahuys comes over that tree, which stands there at the
north end of the wood; or that the white Countrie-church come to the northwards
of the little houses of Ahuys, then go on northwest, or bring that foresaid
white-countrie-church in a little valley, a little to the northwards of an old
ruined castle, where of there stands yet some of the walls upon the north
side of the River, and sail so on, until that Ahuys come to stand in the
midst of the River, anchor there in two fathom and an half, or three fathom,
there is the road there can go no sea. In this southergatt it is two fathom,
two fathom and an half, and sometimes also at least 3 fathom deep.

For to sail into the Eastergat, Eastergat Ahuys.
coming from the southwards keep in six or seven fathom, and run so to the
north shore, and then you run along without the riffe, that lies off by
south the rivers mouth from the west shore until that Ahuys do stand right
west from you, then there comes a great tree to the wood, that stands upon
the west shore, keep that so standing and run in right with it, until that
foresaid countrie-church come to that aforesaid old piece of wall, of the old
ruinous castle, and then right in, as has been before said. Or run in by
the first marks, until within a shot of a cast piece near to the west shore,
and then edge up to the north shore, until that Ahuys come in the midst of
the River, and anchor there, as has been said.

Hanno Hanno.
is a high round Island, which men may sail round about, under it is good road
for south and southeast winds.

Behind Hanno runs up a little River to Self-brough, but serves only for
small ships or Crayers, which go not deep.

From Ahuys to the Rocks the course is east and by south twelve or thirteen
leagues, betwixt them both lie diverse little towns, as Fleholme and Rottenbuy,
Fleholm Rottenbuy.
where men may anchor before, in six, seven, and eight fathom good anchor
ground: And other Havens more, but little or nothing known by Hollanders.
Thwart of Rottenbuye lies a little Rock somewhat off from the land, called
Malqueren, under which men may also ride.

From the north point of Bruntholm to the Rocks the course is northeast
somewhat northerly sixteen leagues, but from the point of Sandhammer
eastnortheast sixteen leagues. If you run along close by the north point of
Bruntholm, you shall run with a north way, along even without the Rocks:
But if you run along close by the point of Sandhammer, and will sail from
thence to the Rocks, you shall with a northeast and by east way fall with the
Land even within them, or to the Westwardes of them.

The Rocks The rocks
are some little rocks together, which men may sail round about, but can have
no Road under them; they lie 3 or 4 leagues distant from the maine land, and
are smaller then the Eartholms.

A leagues or two to the northwards of them lies the Vrouwen of Green Island,
by some called the Rough-Island, and also the Outlyers: It is not so brooken in
it self as the Rocks, and also much greater, off to seawards from it, lie some
rocks, to the westwards of it, it is all full of rocks, some above and some
under water along even fast to the Land, you may sail about within the
Greene-Island betwixt it and the rocks, but no man can do it, but he must be
very well acquainted there, and then also not without great danger. To the s.
wards of it you may also find Road at some places but you must be very well
acquainted, and also not without danger, by reason of the multitude of suncken
rocks and sharp grounds. The east side of of the Outlyers lie from the rocks
northeast and by north. The south end of Oeland Oeland.
is a sharp point, and lies from the rocks east and west about ten leagues
distant. Thwart of it, betwixt the main land and the aforesaid south point of
Oeland, it is about four leagues broad, betwixt them both goes in the
Calmer-sound.

For to sail up into the Calmer sound, then go on from the rocks, or from
the Outlyers northeast, and by east and then you run in betwixt Oeland and
the maine land, upon 14 fathom and sail then northnortheast betwixt them both,
a midst the channel, both the shoares are very foul: but if you come not
nearer them then in 7 fathom, you can take no hurt there.

From the Rocks to Calmer are sixteen leagues: About half ways betwixt them,
northwest from Southerorden the southermost point of Oeland lies the town of
Christianopell, Christianopel.
lately built there upon a little Island by the Kings Majesty of Denmark, and
so called after his name. Thwart of it was wont to lie upon the main land a
little town called Overschare, Overschare.
now it is one with Christianopel, thwart of it lies a ledge of rocks about a
great English mile off from the shore southeast into the sea, come no nearer
it then in ten fathom.

At Christianopel is a haven on the east side, from it lies off a riffe
toward the eastnortheast into sea; therefore he that will sail in there must
come in from the northwards for to avoyde this riffe.

To the northwardes of Christianopel toward Calmer, it is on both sides (as
well on the side of the main land, as on the side of Oeland) all full of rocks
and foul grounds, but you may sound both the shoares: in the midst betwixt
both in the farewaye, it is ten and twelve fathom deep, all soft claye
ground, to the southwards of Christianopel it is deeper, but to the northwards
of Calmer it is by little and little shoaler.

Two leagues to the northwards of Christianopell lies Bercker haven,
Bercker-haven.
there men do lade oaken beams, there within it is good lying, but very bad
for to come in or out, because of the multitude of sunken rocks, and other
foul grounds, which lie before it, about a half league off from the shore to
seawards.

About a league to the northwards of Berckerhaven lies Hosmes ground, Hosmes
ground.
which is a very bad foul ground, lying somewhat farther off from the shore
to sea-wards, then the other rocks which lie along the shore, thereof you
must take heed.

About a league to the southwards of Calmer, and two leagues to the northwards
of Hosmes ground, lies a point called Steensoe, Steensoe.
which is a somewhat high rough and very foul point, a half league long,
lying within, a half league near to the town, to the westwards of it runs
in a great bight, where is good lying also for many ships, but you cannot
come in there, because of the many foul grounds and dangers, except it be
with a very skillful Pilot: upon the west side, over against the point stands
a white house. The King of Denmarks fleet of ships lay there, in the time of
the last siege of Calmer.

When you come so far in, that you leese the south end of Oeland out of your
sight, then you get the Castle of Calmer Castle of Calmer.
in sight, sail toward it but shun the shoares, as has been said here
before. The Castle has four great towers, when the two eastermost of the four
come one in the other, then is the Castle about northwest from you, then you
come by the Grimschaer, Grimschaer
this is a rock easy to be known, upon it stands a mast, with a Barrel upon
the top of it, which lies much nearer the west shore then Oeland, when you
get it in sight, then sail toward it. Thwart of the Grimschaer or Tonholm
lies a sunken rock, about a cables length off from it, and a little more to
the eastwards, upon it is no more then five foot water.

The farewaye is through, betwixt this sunken rock and the Grimschaer about
northeast and by north, sail close along by the Grimschaer, leaving it on
the larboard side, and then the foresaid sunken Rock remains on the starboard
side of you.

Being a little past the foresaid sunken Rock, and Grimschaer, you come then on
against the west end of a long small rock, which lies far to the eastwards,
toward Oeland, and lies almost even with the water, at some places a little
above water, and at some places the Sea runs along over it, edge then a
little up to the northwards, and run about by the point of that rock; Being
past that, you shall meet on the larboard side a low rock, from the which there
shoots off a little tail to the northwards, upon it stands a little
beacon, sail along by it, and being a little past it, then shall the town
lie westsouthwest from you, let your anchor fall there in five or six fathom,
there is the right road. If you come to anchor somewhat northerly in the road,
you must be careful to take heed of a sunken rock which lies not more then
eleven or twelve foot under water.

The Marks of this sunken rock Sunken rock.
are these: When the mills upon the Mulholm are one in the other, with the mill
which stands on the north side without the town, then you are thwart off the
foresaid sunken rock; On both sides of it, as well to the northwards as the
southwards of it, it is deep enough. It is good lying there, almost with all
winds, but a north and by east wind is the worst, which blows there open
in. With ships that go not deeper then six or seven foot, men may come to
lie at the bridge before the town.

You may also sail to the westwards of the Grimschaer: that is, through
betwixt the Grimschaer and the land, with ships that go not deep, but he that
shall do it, must be very well acquainted there, for there it is all full of
Rocks, some above and some under water.

From the south end of Oeland, called Southerorden, The riff of southerorden.
lies off a great dangerous riffe a league and an half into sea, there it is
seven and eight fathom deep, when the Chapel upon Southerorden is northwest a
great league from you, there it is ten and eleven fathom deep; you may sound
about this riffe in eight or nine fathom, but it is not good to come nearer it,
when you can do otherwise, and can pass it.

A half league to the northwards of the Town Calmer, to wit, a little to the
northwards of the road, lies an Island, called Skalloe, Skalloe.
which you must leave on the starboard side, when you are bound from Calmer to
the northwards: It is indifferent clean upon the west side, but from the
Sweeds side there over against it runs off a stone riff, almost unto the
Island. Upon this riffe stands commonly a stone-beacon: it is dangerous to
sail through there, or over that shoale, for one that is not there very well
acquainted: It is also Pilots water.

Four leagues to the northwards of the Calmer, on the Sweeds side, lies an
out-poynt, called Schenknes, or Skegnesse, Skegenes.
thwart of it lies a small Island, called the Baker, The Baker
betwixt this point and Skallo it is very uneven of depths.

The east coast of Oeland is a clean coast, and lies northnortheast, and
southsouthwest.

Off the Island Rughen.
To the westwards of the Island Rugen men do sail up into the Jelle unto
Straelsound. For to sail from Straelsound out along the Jelle, For to sail
out at the Jelle.
go on north, and north, and by west, there lies a Middle-ground, sometimes
there stands a beacon upon it, and sometimes not, leave that on the larboard
side, being past that, sail to the point where the wood stands upon, so that
the town come behind the wood, you shall then see a very high tree, bring that
over the flattest steeple, and keep it so a while standing, going on still
north, and north and by west unto the beacon the Jelle. When as you luffe up
about by it west, then look out for two trees, which stand upon the east
shore, somewhat within the land, bring them a ships length without the highest
tree, which stands upon the shore, and luffe up about the beacon, toward
the buy. In the mouth of the deep lie three buys, which in sailing out you
must leave all on the larboard side, but in sailing in all on the starboard
side. It is not deeper in the mouth of the Deep then six and seven foot, and
also without, it is far of shoale water.

The Island Rugen has four points that lie out, under which men may ride at
diverse places, as Doornbosh, Whitmond, Jasmond and the Peert.

The point of Doornbosh Dornbosch.
lies from the Jelle north distant two leagues, it is high land with a steep
point, men may ride under it for northeast, east, and southeast winds. If you
will anchor there, then anchor in three, four, or five fathom, so that the
steep point stand northnortheast from you, or that the Church stand over the
point, or anchor where about that it shall please you, or shall be best
convenient, it is there all over shallow water and clean sand-ground.

From Dornbosch to Brontholm, the course is east northeast seventeen or
eighteen leagues, but Dornbosch and Fasterbornes Riffe lie northnorthwest and
southsoutheast, fourteen leagues asunder.

From Dornbosch to Whitmont, the course is northeast and by east four leagues.
Betwixt them both goes in a great Bay, where you may run in along by
Whitmondt, and have road there in five or six fathom, for southwest, south, and
also for an east wind.

If you will seek road under Whitmondt Road under Whitmont
for westerly winds, and run about by the point coming from the westwards,
then come not nearer the point, then seven or eight fathom, there shoots off
an uneven shoale, which you must avoid, being come about the point, anchor
there in twelve, thirteen, or fourteen fathom, that is about a league from the
shore, nearer to the shore in seven, eight or ten fathom, the ground is not
clean, in twelve fathom you have gross sand, in thirteen or fourteen fathom
soft ground, so that with hard winds you should need to shoe your anchor, you
lie there also landlockt for a west and south wind.

Iasmond Road under Iasmondt.
lies from Witmond eastsoutheast distant three leagues.

If you will anchor under Iasmond, for a west or westnorthwest wind, then sail
so far about the point, that it come to be northnorthwest, or somewhat more
northerly from you, when you come about the point, you shall see in the
southwest or somewhat more westerly from you, a little thick wood of trees,
upon a plain hill, and on each side of that little wood, a little sharp
steeple, and also a great tree, like as if it were a mill without wings, when
that tree comes to be southwest and by west from you, anchor there in 9 or 10
fathom, there is indifferent ground, according as the ground is there, by the
point of the land, it is about 13 fathom deep.

Or bring the north point northwest, and the other point southwest and by south
from you, and anchor there in ten or eleven fathom, there it is good soft
ground, but it lasts not long, so soon as you find the soft ground you must
let fall your anchor, for the ground is there at many places not clean, or
you must sail far about both the points, there you lie landlockt for a
northwest and north wind, in ten, eleven or twelve fathom, good soft ground.

The Peert, The Peert
which men do also call the great Buck upon Iasmond, is a tuffe of trees or
two, and is a point that lies out with two points, where is betwixt them both
a fair Sand-bay, where in is good lying in four or five fathom clean ground.

Jasmond and the Peert lie southsoutheast and northnorthwest distant four or
five leagues.

To the southwards of the Peert goes in that New-deep, where men do sail
through to Statyn.

THE NEW-DEEPE.


About a league south, somewhat westerly from the Peert lies a point, called
the Ironhead, there lies off a little riffe, therefore you must run along
somewhat without that point, and being a little past that point, you can see
the outermost buy of the New-deep, For to sail into the New deep
wherein lie two buys in the middst of the deep, so that you may sail
along on both sides of the buys, but with ships of great draughts, you must
run close along to the e. wards of the buys, there is the very deepest of the
channel. By the outermost buy it is at the shoalest, there is the bar,
commonly there is 11 foot water, or a little more then 11 foot and a half, and
sometimes also well 12 foot, but in the middst of the Mouth of the deep it is
commonly still 12 foot, and sometimes more.

Upon the Peert lie three high hommocks, the westermost of them is the
greatest, one great round hommock, when you keep that right without the Iron
head, and then run on southsouthwest when you cannot sail amiss, although
there were no buys in the mouth of the Deep.

When you come over the Bar, you shall find again 4 or 5 fathom depth,
being a little over it, you must go on southeast unto the entrance of the Peen,
with that course you leave the Island of the Roeden The Roeden.
lying at least two cables lengths on the larboard side. It is there all over
good anchoring. Right over against Grijpswald lies a little Island called
stobber round about which you may almost sail something more easterly then
Grijpswald lies a little riffe thwart from the shore.

Road under the Roeden.
If you will sail into the Peen you shall epsy (sailing thus right out a head
at the east side of the Peen, two points, keep the eastermost a handspikes
length without the westermost (for to avoid a stony shoale, which runs off
from the west point of the Peen) until that you come before the Peen. Upon the
east shore stand 2 beakons, bring them one in the other, and run so into the
Peen, which lies in first s.w. but in the coming in, there, is no more then 6
foot, or 6 foot and an half water.

If you will anchor under the Island the Roeden, you must be mindful of a
little riffe that lies of from the Roeden to the s.wards, toward the main
land, anchor there, either to the westwards or to the eastwards of it,
accordings as the wind shall be, in 3 fathom, or 2 fathom and a half, so
shoale or deep, as you please, there is the common road for the ships.

The Rough Island Rough Island.
lies from the Roeden northeast and by east distant about two great leagues.

About eastnortheast from the Roeden For to sail out to the eastwards of the
Roeden.
lies also a channel into the Sea, a little to the southwards of the Rough
Island, that is good for to run out with westerly winds, when you cannot come
out at the New deep, and also for those that are bound to Danske, or to the
eastwards. From the Rough Island lies off a little riffe to the southwards,
which you must avoid, and run through betwixt that and the shoale which
runs from the shore, thwart off it is the bar or shoalest off this
channel not less then eleven or twelve foot water, that is a short out let,
being over you shall get presently deeper water. This channel is Pilots water.
Upon the Island the Roeden dwell Pilots, which do bring out ships. The Coast
of Pomeren lies from the New deep to Colbergen east and west about sixteen or
seventeen leagues.

Betwixt them both lie yet two channells, the Swinne, and the channel of
Camin. The Swin Swin.
lies seven leagues eastwards from the New-deepe, which runs through a
little River into the Haff or broad water, right over against the river of
Stetyn. Camin Camin.
lies five leagues to the eastwards of the Swin, upon the east end of the Haff
or broad water of Stetyn: that channel goes through also with a river into
the Haff.

Five leagues without the land, when Jasmond is westnorthwest, or thereabout,
the Peert westsouthwest, and Rough Island south from you, there lies a banck
Banck.
of seven fathom, upon one place somewhat less, and upon another somewhat
more, betwixt it and the land toward Jasmond it is again thirteen, fourteen
and fifteen fathom deep, but to the eastwards of the New-deepe, along by the
coast of Pomeren, it is all shoale water, off four, five, six and seven
fathom, so far into the Sea, that when you can but even see the land of the
Swin, there it is not deeper then seven or eight fathom, without sight of the
land it is twelve and thirteen fathom deep.

The Haven of Colbergen Colbergen.
you must sail into between two heads, until you come before the Town.
Within in the river, right over against the town, lies a Well or Brook which
can give all the country thereabout Salt, off water which they sees, and yet
the water of the river is fresh as Milk, for it is a little water that comes
out of the land. The coast of Pomerland lies from Colbergen to Gashead
northeast and by east and southwest and by west about 13 leagues, betwixt them
both lie two havens more, to wit, Coflyn and Ruwolde.

The haven of Coflyn lies from Colbergen eastnortheast 3 leagues distant. And
from Coflyn to Ruwold, Coflyn. Ruwolde
the course is northeast and by east five leagues. Into the haven of Ruwold, or
the little river, called the Wipper, an indifferent ship may go in. It is from
Ruwolde to Gashead northeast and by east four leagues.

The land lies from Garshead to the Rosehead east and east and by north 20 or
21 leagues, betwixt them lie the havens off Stolp, The Stolp
Liba, and Sernevis.

A little to the eastwards of Garshead lies the haven off the Stolp, which is
a river so called as the town, which runs up to the same town, only for
small ships, although that theredoe indifferent great ships lade.

From Garshead unto Reefcoll it is all a white Strand, and lies eastnortheast
from it four leagues. Reefcoll is a high round hill very easy to be known,
when you come off from Brontholm. From Reefcoll to Liba Liba.
it is seven leagues.

Liba lies upon a great river, called the Osse. From Liba to Sernevis Sernevis
are five leagues, betwixt them lie the three Woolsacks, which are three black
tuffes of trees, where by this land is very easy to be known, a little to the
eastwards of these three little Hommocks lies a long hill which does show it
self (when you come out of the west) on the west end divided into three or
four little hommocks. Seven or eight leagues to the eastwards of the Woolsacks
follows the high land of Rose-head, which is very steep upon the water side.
Betwixt the Rose-head and Reefcoll it is all white strand, and most of the land
grown with trees.

Servenis Sernevis
is a little town lying upon a little off water which with a little river
runs into the Sea, but within, it does spread it self into a great river.
It is from Sernevis to the Rose-head 4 leagues.

You may sound about the Rose-head in 15 and 20 fathom, and also you may well
anchor under the Rose-head, there is better ground then under the Heel. All the
strand off Pomer-land is along the Sea side above all black with trees.

Of the Dephts.
In the fareway to the northwards off Brontholm along to Rye, it is deep
betwixt Oeland and Brontholm five and thirty, six and thirty, and eight and
thirty fathom, but coming against Oeland, so that the south end come to be
northwest and by north, northwest, and northwest, and by west five or six
leagues from you, there you shall find very uneven grounds. Southeast five or
six leagues from Southerorden, are grounds of nine, ten, twelve and sixteen
fathom, in the nine and ten fathom soft ground, that there remains nothing
upon the lead, but in the fourteen or fifteen fathom, it is gross read and
black stony sand ground, almost like Iett. Nearer again to Oeland it is agine
deeper water and farther from the land it is also deeper, but all uneven
ground; the south end of Oeland, being about northnorthwest from you eight
leagues, there it is again sometimes twenty, fourteen and also well ten and
nine fathom in the shoalest deep, all stony ground, that there remains
nothing upon the lead, but in twenty and five and twenty fathom gross redd and
black stony sand. He that sayleth with a northerly wind over these foresaid
shoales, of ten, eleven and twelve fathom, and is bound to Brontholm, let him
go on westsouthwest, for to sail clear of Brontholm, if he reckon to come
against it by night: the Bleecksche side he may boldly run to by the lead in
seventeene and eighteen fathom. The point of Sand-hammer runs far off
flat, at has been said here before, you may run about by it in seven and
eight fathom.

Betwixt the Rocks and Oeland, in the farewaye to Gotland it is eight and
thirty, and nine and thirty fathom deep, easy clay ground.

When Southerorden is northnorthwest, somewhat northerly a league from you,
there it is thirteen fathom deep.

When the little chapel upon Southerorden is westnorthwest from you two
leagues, there it is thirty fathom deep.

When Southerorden lies west two great leagues from you, there it is seven
and twenty, eight and twenty, and nine and twenty fathom deep.

Betwixt Fasterborne and Brontholme it is thirty, and five and thirty fathom
deep, in the farewaye, but when you begin to come near Fasterborne, there it
is shoaler water of fourteen, fifteen and sixteen fathom.

When you (coming from the west) sail along by the south side of Brontholm
eastsoutheast about a league without the land, and that the east end of
Brontholm is east somewhat southerly about two leagues from you, there it is
deep seven or eight fathom gross pale sand, that lasts until that the
foresaid east end be east and east and by north about a league and a half from
you, all in one depth, but when it comes to be eastnortheast from you, it is
fifteen fathom deep, small blackish sand-ground.

Four or five leagues from Brontholme, when the east end (from which
Brewers-riffe runs off) is about eastnortheast or northeast and by east, and
the north end about north, or north and by east from you, there lies a banck
off seven, eight or nine fathom, and lies northwest and southeast more then a
great league long, the southermost end lies about southwest from the east end
of Brontholme. He that meets with this banck by night, may make some guessing
thereby, for to direct his course thereafter, whether he be bound eastwards
toward Reefcoll, or toward Fasterborne.

About two leagues eastsoutheast from the aforesaid east end of Brontholme (to
wit the low sand point) where Brewers-riffe lies off, there it is four and
twenty and five and twenty fathom deep, stony ground.

About four leagues east, somewhat northerly, or east and by north from Meun,
lies a banck off eleven and twelve fathom, which lasts from thence with a
northwest and by west course, until that Meun come to be westsouthwest, or
southwest and by west from you, then it is again eighteen, nineteen and twenty
fathom deep, soft ground.

Fasterborne shall then be northnorthwest and Steden westnorthwest from you,
going on with that same northwest and by west course, you shall then get by
little and little shoaler water, to wit, sixteen and fifteen fathom, and close
by Steden fourteen, thirteen, and twelve fathom. He that comes from
Witmondt or Jasmondt toward the Sound, and runs along four leagues
without Meun, runs along over this foresaid banck, he that finds
himself by night upon it, has a good mark for to make his reckoning there
after.

Betwixt Brontholm and the coast Pomerland, in the fareway, when you can see
Brontholm, it is 26 fathom deep, but so far to the southwards that you can
see the coast of Pomerland, there it is 7 and 8 fathom deep, but without sight
of the land 12 and 13 fathom deep. Along all the coast of Pomerland betwixt
the New-deepe and Rose-head, it is along by the coast 22 and 20 and also well
25 fathom deep.

Betwixt Colbergen and Garshead it is all a flat even strand and ground,
without any bancks. In the fareway betwixt Bruntholm and Reefcoll, it is seven
and twenty and eight and twenty fathom deep, but far to the northwards of it
is at least five and thirty and eight and thirty fathom deep.

Northwest from Reefcoll four or five leagues from the land, lies a banck of
nine, ten, and eleven fathom, when you come from Bruntholm, and Reefcoll
comes to be southeast and by east from you, then you come against this
banck, and ends when Reefcoll is south and by east from you.

From this foresaid banck toward Bruntholm, it is five and twenty, thirty, and
six and thirty fathom deep, soft clay ground, but toward Reefcoll it is
shoaler.

If you cast the lead often, sailing along that coast, you shall find more
banks.

You may boldly sail along this coast by night, or dark weather in eight,
ten or twelve fathom off from Reefcoll until about the Rosehead. Thwart of the
Rosehead it is far flat, and round as riffe ground. When you come past or
about Rosehead it is very deep.

When the Rose-head is southsouthwest from you about a league, there it is
thirty fathom deep, but very uneven and full of bancks, and the ground white
gross sand.

Rose-head being southeast from you, it is eight and twenty fathom deep, with
red stony ground, almost like as if it were riffe sand.

Rose-head being west from you, there it is sixteen fathom deep, and white
sand-ground.

The south end of Oeland shows thus, when it is thwart off from you.
The Eartholms, being northnortheast from you, show themselves thus.
The Eartholms, being east from you, show themselves thus.
In this form arises the Eartholms, being north from you.
Thus shows Whitmont, when you sail along by it, being three leagues off
from it.
Thus shows Jasmond, when you sail along by it, being three leagues from
the land.
Whitmont. Here under is a great bay a league long. Dornebosch.

Thus show themselves Whitmont and Dornebosch, with the land betwixt them both,
when it is about southsouthwest from you, so far that you may but even see it
from below.

The Rose-head. Woolsackes. Reefcol.

Thus shows the land betwixt Reefcoll and the Rose-head, when you sail
along by it three leagues without the land.

Thus shows the land betwixt Colbergen and the Stolp, when you sail along
by it about 2 leagues without the land.


The second Demonstration, Where in The Sea-Coastes between Rygs-head and Der
Winda are set forth.
FRom the Rose-head to the Heel, the course is southeast eight or nine leagues
distant. When you come near the Heel, you are almost ground off in thirty
fathom. On the coast of the Heel close by the land, it is four and twenty and
also thirty fathom deep.

Under the Heel Road under the Heel.
you may anchor in twelve; and twenty fathom close by the land, the ground
there goes off very much. If you be a little off from the land, then you are
ground off, not very far without the land you have no ground in forty
fathom. A league to the northwards off the Heel there runs of a flat from
the land, where you must take heed, when you will go to anchor under the Heel,
you may anchor on both sides of the Heel, but on the innerside it is soft
ground.

From the Heel to Danske before the Wissell, the course is south and by west 5
leagues. If you will anchor before the Wissell, then anchor to the westwards of
the Chests, or the Wester-head in ten or twelve fathom.

But for to sail into the Wissell, or the Danske Deep Danske Deep.
you must look for out the two masts with barrels upon them, which stands
upon the Chests, or the Wester-head, bring one in the other, and sail in right
with them, in betwixt the Chests, but when you are within Termunde, you must
choose the easter shore, for the West shore is flat, when you come before
Boatsams flat, you must choose the side off the Green-shoare, and make there
fast with four hawsers or cables.

The Quinsbrough deep Quinsbrough deep.
lies from the Wissell, or the Chests of Danske east and by north thirteen or
fourteen leagues. From the Rose-head east southeast southerly 19 or 20 leagues,
and from the Heel eastsoutheast easterly 12 leagues.

From the Wissell to the Quinsbrough-deep and al along to the northwards of
it, it is altogether a fair white sandy strand, upon both sides off the deep
stand some withered trees, to see to as if they were burnt, but upon the south
side stand two Capes, or beakons. If you will sail in there, bring the capes
one in the other, when you come in 10 or 8, fathom, and sail in so right with
them, and so you shall run right with the buys, which lie on both sides of the
Deep to 8 or 10 in number, to wit, on each side four or five, sail in
betwixt them, until you come within in the Kettell. There is no certainty to
be written of the lying in of this channel, as also of the the Danske deep,
whereunto men might trust, for by reason of the scouring of the Freshuts, and
with great streaming of the Ice, they do change oftentimes, and sometimes in
short time, but the Lords of the land there have very great care to give
charge, that they be always well set with buys and beakons.

For to anchor in the road without the deep, then anchor so that the point of
Locksteed lie about north and by east from you, there it is eight, nine and ten
fathom deep.

Within the Deep in the Kettell, men do lie to tarry for the wind in three
fathom and three fathom and a half.

For to sail up the Haff go out of the Kettel about e. until you come against
the Heert, and southeast over it and then along the Haff amidst the channel
unto the Haverstrome, the course is most east. Being over the Heert edge
somewhat to the south shore for to avoid that riff which lies off from the
north shore about a third part into the Haffe, to wit; from the point by east
Fishouses there lies a little buy upon it, and come no nearer it then twelve
or thirteen foot. The right fareway is to the southwardes of it fourteen and
fifteen foot soft ground, until about Brandenburgh, from thence further it is
by little and little shoaler twelve, eleven and ten foot upon the Haverstraw.
When you get the steeple of Quinsbrough in sight, then you shall see also by it
a round black little wood; keep the steeple on the north or east side off that
little wood, until that you be past Brandenburgh, then let the steeple come a
ships length to the eastwards of the little wood of trees, and sail so right
with it, till you come by the buys or little trees of the Haverstraw, there
you must run through amidst the channel betwixt them, until you come into the
Pregell which lies up northeast unto the town.

From der Pillo to Quinsbrough are about eight leagues, but to Melven Melven.
it is about 9 leagues, you must also sail up there amidst the channel about
southwest, but the point over against the Pillo, where the castle Terbaly
stands, you must avoid somewhat, which runs far off flat.

Four or five leagues north and north and by west from the Quinsbrough Deep
lies the point of Brusteroort, and betwixt them both Loocsteed, whereupon
stands a Castle with a Church, not far one from the other, and also two
high hommocks or hills, and the land there abouts is all full of trees.

From Brusteroort to the Deep off Der Memell, Der Memell.
the course is northeast and by north sixteen or seventeen leagues. It is there
betwixt them both a fair strand, and the land lies in a great bay. The deep
of Der Memell lies in northeast, and northeast and by east, and is two fathom
deep, within it you come into a great Haffe: you may run to the westwards
about the point, and anchor there where you will.

From Der Memell to Heyligena, the coast lies north and by east four leagues.

From Heyligena to the point of Sevenbergen, north and by east, five leagues,
that is with hommocks and hilly land.

Four or five leagues north and by east from Sevenbergen lies Terlyba.
Terlyba.
There goes into the land a little river, but there can go in no ships,
there is no more then six foot water. On the north side of the river stands a
Gentleman's house or Castle, with a turret upon the midst of it, the north end
of the house is covered with boards, and the southend with red tyles, to the
southwards or the eastwards of it stand also some houses, covered also with
tyles, in betwixt two woods to see to. If you will anchor in the road of
Terlyba, then anchor a little to the southwards of the village so that the
foresaid Gentlemans-house with the turret do stand east and by north from you
in four fathom and a half, and five fathom less two foot, there is the best
road and ground that is thereabouts. When you come out of the sea, and fall
with the land to the eastwards or to the northwards of Terlyba, you shall see
within the land a black wood, and the houses in a ragged valley of Sandhills.

From Terlyba to Derwinda, the course is northnortheast sixteen, or seventeen,
leagues, betwixt them both the land lies in a bight, so that the coast along
by the shore lies not so right, especially four or five leagues by south
Derwinda, there it falls away into a great bight, which men do call
Sackerwyke, Sackerwyke.
and also with more smaller bights and bays toward Terlyba.

About four leagues to the northwards off Terlyba lies a point called
Stickeroort, or Steenoort, Steenoort
thwart there of it is very flat, so that a good ways from the Caarte van
PRVYSSEN en Coerlandt van Rygshooft tot der Winda
land, it is not deeper then nine, ten, and twelve fathom, all stony uneven
ground, of this point you must take good heed, and not come too near it. Anno
1599, in the Spring a man of Hoorn sailed somewhat near to this shoale, and
came on ground upon an unknown rock, and lost shis ship. To the northwards of
it, toward Derwinda thwart off Sacker-wyke it is all clean ground, and far
flat, at many places a good waves from the land not deeper then six and seven
fathom clean sandy ground, good for to anchor in, when you lie by there with a
northeast wind, and can get nothing with turning to windwards. But if you
keep under sail, you may in turning to windwards come near the shore every
where without fear in 4 or 5 fathom.

For to know this coaste off Coerland, For to know Coerland.
then remember these places here under written.

At Derwinda stands a Castle with three Towers, which is covered above with
red tyles, and under it is white, about a league to the southwards of Derwinda,
lies the Bakeovens, Bakeovens
which is next to Domesnes, the best land to be known of Coerland, it arises
first when you begin to see the land, in a white Sand-hill, the top whereof
is full of trees, but when you come so near the shore, that you can see the
other land also then there arises more land with hommockes, so that then it is
not so easy to be known.

About four leagues to the southwards of it in Sackerwyke lies yet a hommock
or hill full of trees with some little hommockes to the eastwards of it, when
you are thwart of Derwinda, you may even see it half ways up to the top, but
not well from below. This hommocke is called by some Duke D'alves Castle, Duke
de Alves Castle.
and lies most alone: the land, as well to the southwards as to the northwards
of it, is most al even and plain land.

About six leagues to the southwards of the foresaid hommock, and 5 or 4
leagues and an half to the northwards off Terlyba, lie also two high hommocks
close one by the other, the land to the southwards of them toward Terlyba, is
to see to far off (when you are thwart of these two hommocks, or somewhat to
the northwards of them) as if it were all broken land, thwart of this about 5
leagues from the land, or when you can but even see the land from below, it is
30 fathom deep.

When you begin to come about Derwinda Banck by Derwinda
within 2 or 3 leagues off the land, there lies a banck of 12, 13, and 14,
fathom: some say that west and by north from Derwinda there should be no more
upon that banck then 5, or 6, fathom water, it is about a half league broad
betwixt the banck and the land a league without the shore, it is again 20 and
24 fathom deep.

If you will anchor before Derwinda, then bring the foresaid Castle about
eastsoutheast from you, then it comes almost behind the high land, anchor in
5 fathom from the shore, there is the best road.

The third Demonstration, Where in Are Described the Sea-Coastes betwixt Der
Winda and Revel, and the Islands of Aland.
THe lying of Derwinda, and how men shall know it, is here before declared.

From Derwinda to Lyserorte, the coast lies northeast and by north four
leagues, and from Lyserorte to Domesnes eastnortheast twelve or thirteen
leagues. When you are thwart of Lyserorte, you can perceive no point, it
seems to be all an even right coast from Derwinda to Domesnes, but coming
from Derwinda or Domesnes, and being a league or two to the eastwards or to the
westwards of it, you can see well that it is a blunt point, lying out. Thwart
of Lyserorte runs off a great uneven shoale, at least two leagues into sea,
but you need not fear of it, you may run over it in four, five or six fathom
by the lead, like as also along all the coast of Coerland from Derwinda,
until about Domesnes.

To the westwards of Lyserort the land has a little bight, there you may
anchor for northeast, eastnortheast and east winds: when it blows hard, and
that you can do no good with turning to windwards, you must bring the point of
Lyserorte eastnortheast from you in seven fathom, there is clean sand-ground
and good lying.

The land betwixt Domesnes and Derwinda is very easy to be known. At the point
of Derwinda it is high, and goes sloping down by little and little to the
eastwards unto Lyseroort: Likewise 3 or 4 leagues by west Domesnes lies a high
blewhill, called the Doembergh, which is steep on the east side, and goes by
little and little sloping down to the westwardes unto near Lyserorte, so that
there two high double blewlands do go down into a valley one against the other,
the low land betwixt both is Lyserorte. Leyserorte.
The point of Domesnes it self is low sandy land, it lies out about 3 leagues
to the eastwards of the foresaid Doembergh: but all that is together full of
trees.

The south end of Oesel Riffe off Oesel.
lies from the point of Domesnes northwest and by west about six leagues a
sunder, there runs off a great Riffe, about south and by west, and
southsouthwest into sea, toward the shoale Lyserorte, called Swalverorte,
Swalverorte.
that is a dangerous riffe, at lest three leagues long, very hard and uneven,
at some places toward Oesell it lies dry above water, and at some other
places it is two, two and an half and three fathom deep. To the westwards of
that riffe lie also many uneven Dwael-grounds a good ways off from the land,
which lie along the coast of Oesel to the northwards, which are at some
places not deeper then two, three and four fathom.

Pas caarte van LIIFLANDT end Oost-Finlandt, van der Winda tot aende hoeck van
Alandt end voort tot Revel.


If you will go to Rye, and coming out of the sea do fall with the land
about Derwinda, then leave not the coast of Coerland, but run about by it
upon the lead, all along unto Domesnes in four, five, six or seven fathom,
according as you have the wind, that you may not fall without, or to the
westwards of that riffe Swalverorte. The channel betwixt Coerland and that
foresaid riffe is fourteen, fifteen and sixteen fathom, but very uneven. The
ground upon the shoale thwart of Lyserorte is at some places also very uneven
for to sound, sometimes six, sometimes eight and nine fathom, the one cast at
least two or three fathom more or less then the other, and that not very far
from the land but you need not fear of it, you may bouldly run to the shore
in four and five fathom.

But if (when you come out of the sea) you are past Lyserorte, and come with
the land to the northwards of it against Oesell, then you have deeper water,
for not far to the westwards without Swalverorte Marks to shun Swalverorte.
it is thirty fathom deep. If you can see Oesel and Coerland, and that the
Doembergh be eastsoutheast or southeast and by east from you, then run on
southeast until you come near Coerland, for to avoid Swalverorte, and then
along by it upon your lead toward Domesnes, as is beforesayd. Or when as you
have the Doembergh eastsoutheast from you, then keep it so standing from you,
and sail in so right with it, and then you shall (without hurt) run along
over the tail of the outermost shoale of Swalverorte, it shoaleth up there
very soon and suddenly from 13 or 15 and nine fathom, but if you bring the
east side of the Doembergh not more southerly from you then eastsoutheast and
southeast and by east then you shall not meet with any dangers of the
Dwaelgrounds, nor of Swalverorte, you shall thus sail along at least three
leagues over the Dwaelgrounds and Swalverorte, over very uneven grounds, the
one cast at least twelve, the other nine, and also well seven, and six fathom,
but go on your course without fear, when as the Inner side, or east side of
the south end of Oesel comes to be north, and north and by east from you,
then you are over the riffe, within all the foul grounds that might hurt you,
when as that you get then 13 or 14 fathom, then sail bouldly without fear
toward Domesnes.

If it should happen, that with a northwest wind, you should fall with the
land to the northwards of Derwinda or Lyserorte, and should fear to come near
the Coast of Coerland, then keep not further off to Sea, then that the east
point of Doembergh be eastsoutheast from you, when as then you bring the east
side of the south point of Oesell northnortheast from you, then you shall run
along over Swalverorte in seven fathom. Betwixt Oesel and Coerland it is
sixteen and seventeen fathom deep. When as Domesnes is southeast and by east,
and the south point of Oesel northwest and by north from you, and that you are
a like near to them both there it is eighteen farhom deep.

From the point of Domesnes runs off also a riffe northeast and by north, or
a little more northerly a league and half into the sea, which is on the east
side very steep, but on the west side somewhat flatter.

When you come from out of the west, and are bound to Rye you may run about
by it upon your lead, in 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 fathom, so near as you will, but
according as the wind and weather shall be, I know of some that have sounded
about it in four, and four fathom and half: but he that will run so
somewhat near about it must be very careful in using of his lead, and not let
it rest.

Not very far from the riffe, on the west side, it is 12 and 13 fathom deep.
When as the point of Domesnes, where the withered trees stand upon come to be
southsouthwest from you, then you come on against the west side of the riffe,
when that point is southwest and by south from you, then you are right thwart
of the point, but when it is southwest, and southwest and by west from you,
then you are about the riffe, and then you may bouldly go on southeast toward
Rye. Domesnes and the Deep of Rye lie southeast and northwest twenty leagues
distant.

About eight leagues to the eastwards or to the southwards of Domesnes runs
off another riffe from a point which you may sound about in five and six
fathom. The land betwixt Domesnes and that point lies about southsoutheast,
and northnorthwest, but to the southwards of it, it falls away to the south;
so that betwixt this point, and the Deep of Rye, there is a great bay, which is
called the Kowerwyck: Kowerwy ke.
somewhat to the southwards of this point in the bay, lies some high land,
which lies from the Deep of Rye w. and by s. and e. and by north. It must be
very clear weather when you can see it, lying at anchor before the deep of
Rye.

When as (coming from Rye) you shall be somewhat to the southwards in the
Koperwike, and come running out there by the shore, this foresaid point has
thus oftentimes been mistaken for Domesnes, because that then you can see no
Land without it, but when as you come about the point, you shall again see the
Land out a head, then you are yet about 8 leagues from Domesnes.

Under the point of Domesnes you may anchor on both sides, as well to the
westwards as to the eastwards. If you will anchor to the westwards of it, then
anchor in 6, 7 or 8 fathom, there you have good sand ground, and sheltred for
east and southeast winds. If you will anchor to the eastwards of it, then anchor
in 6 or 7 fathom, a little within the point of the land, so that the point be
north or north and by west from you, there is good sandy ground, and good
lying for a southsouthwest westnorthwest and northnorthwest wind: the point of
the riffe lies then from you about northnortheast a league and half. If you
will anchor further from the shore, so that the point of Domesnes be northwest
or northwest and by north from you, there it is eighteen and twenty fathom
deep and soft ground.

If that you are coming off from Rye against the riff of Domesnes, you will
sail about it, Road under Dosnes.
then you must run far enough about without it, or if you will take it
somewhat near, you must be exceeding careful in using your lead. It is (as
has been said) very steep on the east side, with a northwest way, (which
runs thwart into the riffe) you shall have the one cast twelve nine, or
eight, and the next cast four, or three fathom, if you fall within the point of
the riffe. But if you have been at anchor under Domesnes, and set sail from
thence and will sail about the riffe, then you may the better run about it
by your lead. Go from thence northnortheast and northeast and by north, that
runs most along by the riffe. When the point off Nesse comes about west
from you, then it will be by little and little somewhat shoaler, you must not
spare your lead, but must sound often. With a northwest course come not nearer
it then in nine ten or twelve fathom. When the point of Nes comes to be
southwest from you, you may run about sound it so in five, six or 7 fathom,
then you come to the east side of the riffe, when that is southwest and by
south from you, then you are right thwart of the point of the riffe, but when
it is southsouthwest from you, then you are about the riffe, go then west
southwest or more southerly toward Coerland, and run along by it, in
five, six or seven fathom (according as the wind shall be) toward Luseroort.

If you sail from Rye with an east or northeast wind, and shall sail by
night about the rif, then set your course so, that you be sure you run far
enough along to the n. wards, or without the Riffe, and keep that course
until that you come near the grounds of Ambroock or Oesel in 15 or 16 fathom,
then you shall be without doubt past the riffe, then go on a while southwest,
until that you reckon the point of Domesnes to be southeast, or somewhat more
easterly from you, then edge up to the coast of Coerland by your lead, and
run along by it, in four, five, six or seven fathom, as has been
beforesayd.

East and by north somewhat easterly eight leagues from Domesnes lies the
Island Round: Round.
you may run round about it by your lead, in six or seven fathom. All along
the southwest side it is all foul and sharp rockie ground, therefore come not
nearer the shore there, then in 6 fathom. Southsoutheast about a halfleague
from the south point lies a little plate, where upon it is not deeper then six
foot, there has once a man beaten off his rudder. It lies betwixt seven and
eight fathom deep, for to avoid that, take thereabouts the sounding of the
shore in five or six fathom, and then you run through betwixt it and the
shore, or else if you keep in eight or nine fathom, then you run about
without it.

If you will anchor under Round Road under Round
for a southsouthwest, southwest or westsouthwest wind, then run about the
southeast point, until you come to the east side, there is a little bay, where
stand a few houses with a chapel, which you can see when you come somewhat
near to the shore, anchor thwart of it in five fathom, so that the chapel
do stand southwest from you, there is the best road under Round, being clean
sandy ground, but when it blows hard the sea comes rouling in. At other
places it is not very clean.

The fareway betwixt Round and Domesnes is two and twenty and three and twenty
fathom deep, and betwixt Round and Duynemond three and twenty and four and
twenty fathom.

From Round to the Deep of Rye, it is southsoutheast, 15 leagues. Before the
Deep of the river Duyn you may anchor in ten fathom, either to the
southwards or the northwards of it, where you please.

The Deep of the river of Rye The Deep of the river of Rye
is Pilots water, as well in sailing up, as sailing off. How men shall sail
there in or out it is not possible to describe, so that men might rely upon
it, for by reason of the continual scowring of the stream, and especially by
some extraordinary great freshuts, and strong drifts of ice, the depths and
shoales do there often shift and change, where of every one that is bound
thither may be mindful of.

From the Deep of Rye to Parno, the course is northnortheast and northeast and
by north five and twenty leagues, betwixt them both, about fourteen leagues
from Rye lies a little town called Lemsael Lemsael.
or Sales, there goes in a little deep of eight foot water. Before that Deep
lies a banck, which you may sail about on both sides, and come within it,
there it is three fathom deep. The Island Kyn Kin.
lies from Sales northwest and by west 7 leagues: from Round east and east and
by north seven leagues, and from the Deep of Rye north and by east about 14 or
15 leagues. It is a little low Island, about 2 leagues long, and has round
about it most foul ground. Betwixt Kyn and the coast of Lyfland it is 7
leagues broad, and the right deep betwixt them both is 8 and 9 fathom deep.

Northwest eight leagues from Round, and north and by east seven leagues from
Domesnes lies Ambrook, Ambrook
that is a little Island, which is round about foul, with sharp stony ground,
and lies two leagues distant from the coast of Oesell. Betwixt Round and
Ambrook but nearest Ambrook lie many uneven Dwael-grounds, Dwael-grounds.
of three, four and five fathom. Ambrook and the south end off Oesell lie
eastnortheast, somewhat northerly, and westsouthwest somewhat southerly about
five leagues distant. Under the south point off Oesell Road under Oesell
on the east side is a good road for westerly winds. If you will anchor there,
then anchor in eight or seven fathom, so that the white Church, which stands
somewhat within the southermost point, do stand west and by south from you,
there is good soft clay ground, and you shall lie sheltred for a west and
westsouthwest wind. The ground is there very even and slatte, when as you get
the seven fathom, and sail toward to land it continues long all one depth of
7 fathom, until you come very close by the shore before it will be shoaler.

It is there all along by the east coast of Oesell flatt ground of three,
four and five fathom.

For to sail from the south end of Oesell unto Arentsbergh through within
Ambrooke, you must leave two thirds of the water on the larboard side towads
Oesell, and one third part on the starboard side toward Ambrooke, there you
shall have about seven fathom water, and soft claye ground, toward the Coast
of Oesell it is full of uneven Dwale-grounds; along by the west side of
Ambrooke you cannot lightly take hurt.

Arentsbergh Arentsbergh.
lies from the south end of Oesel northeast distant eight leagues, but from
the Island Ambrook northnorthwest four or five leagues. Upon the west side of
Oesel, the coast lies off from the south end unto Hondsoorte, with diverse
bays, about northnorthwest and southsoutheast twelve leagues, betwixt them
both lie two lade places, Wyke and Reeck. Along this west coast of Oesell lie
very many uneven and soul grounds, where of men must take very good heed.

Hondtsoort, the northwest point of Oesell, and the point of Dagerorte lie
northnorthwest, and southsoutheast about 8 leagues distant. Betwixt them both
is a great haven there runs also a channel through, but it is so shoale
that no ships can go through, and all over sharp and uneven ground. Upon
Dagerorte Tower upon Dagerorte.
stands a high tower which the Worcester. Counsel of the town of Revell caused
there to be builded, for to know the land by, which men may see on both sides
of Dagerorte far into sea, and also may see it over the land far in the
foresaid baye.

Under the point on the south side of Dagerorte is good lying for north and
northeast winds and clean sand ground^ you may sound about by the point of
Dagerorte in seven or eight fathom, on the north side of the point is good road
for southerly winds.

From Dagerorte to Syburghnes, the coast lies eastnortheast seven leagues.
Betwixt them both, to wit, three leagues from Dagerorte, and four leagues from
Syburghnes, lies a ground, going flat off thwart from the land northwest into
sea, at least five or six leagues, almost in manner as the great luttish
riffe, is first of three, four, five, six and seven fathom deep, and waxes
deeper by little and little toward the Finnish Scheers, where at last it
runs to nothing.

About three leagues without the land of Dagerorte, north and north and by east
from the high tower, there lies a sunken rock which is very steep, whereupon
there is no more then ten foot water: A man of Ossanen has beaten upon it,
which went no deeper then eleven foot and a half, presently after the stroke he
cast the lead, and found five fathom depth. The tower of Dageroort was then
from him south and south and by west.

Syburghnes Syburghnes.
is an out point, with two points, from each of which shoots off a riffe,
betwixt these two riffes is a fair flat sand strand, where you may anchor so
near the shore as you will, in six, five or four fathom.

A little to the westwards of the westermost point of Syburghnes, not far
from the land lies a shoale under water, about so great as a shipp, whereupon
it is not deeper then twelve foot.

From Syburghnes to Oetgensholm, the course is e. and by n. 7 leag. betwixt
them both goes in the Moensound.

To the southwards of Oetgensholm goes in a great bay into the land, where in
lies an Island, and behind it a little town called Hap-sael, there you may
anchor where you will. On the southwest side of this baye, runs off a great
shoale or ledge of rocks at least a great league into the sea, which is very
broad, you may run in along by it into Moensound.

Eastnortheast, and w.s.w. from the east hoeck of Oetgensholm a league in sea
lies a cliff under water whereupon in the year a man of Harlingen is cast.
away.

From Syburghnes to the Oxeholm Oxeholm
and the Grasholm, Grasholm
the course is southsoutheast 4 or 5 leagues, the Grasholm are two little
green Islands, and the Oxeholme lies about a league to the northwards of the
Grasholm, about which you may sail, and anchor round about, a little league
northeast from the Oxholm lies a ground loose from the land, which you must
avoyde, called the wester Grasground, Grasground.
there are two shoales, which are called the Grasgrounds, the other Grasground,
which is called the eastermost, lies over against the Grasholm, toward the
riffe of Hapsael, upon which there is no more then five footwater. He that will
sail into the Moensound, must take heed thereof.

He that will sail off from Oetgensholme through the Moensound Moonsound.
must go on southsouthwest to the Grasholme, and sail in close by it, for to
avoid the Grasground, which lies to the eastwards over against it. From the
Grasholme to the point off the Oesell, where the great tree stands upon, the
course is east five or six leagues. From the Grasholm toward Oesell lie four
little Islands, each about a league one from the other.

When as you sail from Grasholme toward Oesel, you must sail along by
these little Islands, leaving them lying about two or three cables lengths on
the starboard side, until that you come to the land of Oesel, over against the
great tree. In this fareway it is five fathom deep.

When as you come sailing so along past the Grasground, you shall meet with
an Island on the larboard side, to the northwards of it goes in the Deep unto
the Castle of Moensound The Castle of Moon sound.
in three fathom, but sometimes, it is shoaler, for there it is all full of
sands. To the southwards of the same Island goes in another Deep, which you
may sail through, until you come to the end of Oesell, and then you leave the
two little Islands by the south end of Oesell lying on the starboard side. But
the right and best Deep goes from the foresaid great tree, in along by the
land Oesell, which is three and four fathom deep, and at last it will be six,
seven and eight fathom: when you sail along there, you leave the foresaid
two little Islands by the south end of Oesell lying on the larboard side. From
the great tree to the first little Island, the course is eastsoutheast eight or
nine leagues and then from the first little Island to the second south east,
and forth to the end of Oesell east and by south.

From that end or northeast point of Oesell runs off a foul riffe, a great
half league into the sea, called the Paternoster Paternoster.
which you must avoyde.

From this northeast point off Oesell unto Parno, the coast of Lisland lies
eastsoutheast and westnorthwest.

When you come about that point, you may sail into the sea or buy off Rye,
where you will, west and by north to Arentsbergh, southw. or somewhat westerly
to Ambrooke south somewhat easterly to Round, southeast and by south to Kin,
or where you will, the lying of Kin is described here before.

From Kin to Magno and Serckholm all along unto Parno, the course is
northeast and by north eight leagues. Thwart of Magno and Serckhollom Magno
Sterckholm.
it is betwixt Coerland and the Islands, five and six fathom deep, and
along Coerland altogether a fair strand.

Parno Parno.
lies in a great Baye, it is there in the road three and four fathom deep.
For to anchor there, you must anchor so that the steeple of Parno stand
northnortheast from you there is the best road.

Oetgensholme Oetgensholm.
and Syburghnes lie east and by n. and w. and by south seven leagues distant
one from the other.

You may sail round about Oetgensholme, and anchor under it, for northerly and
northwest winds in six or seven fathom but you must beware of the Blind as
before is said.

From Oetgensholm to great Roge, Great Roge.
the course is east four leagues, betwixt them both, a little to the
southwardes of the fareway lies a shoale even above water, which you may sail
round about, but you may not come very near it, because it is stony and
rockie round about it. Great Roge is an out point with two or three white
Chalck-hills, and thereby is very easy to be known. Betwixt this point and
Oetgensholm, somewhat more southerly lies another point, called little Roge
Little Roge.
betwixt it and great Roge, goes a broad Sound into the land of six and
seven fathom depth; but in the end it is shoale There-abouts it is all clean
ground, and good for to anchor in.

From great Roge to the Island Narghen, the course is east somewhat northerly
five leagues.

When you sail from great Roge toward Narghen, you shall find four leagues to
the eastwards of great Roge an other point with two white chalck spots, called
Surp, betwixt it and great Roge, the land falls away to the southwards, into
a great baye. If you will sail to Revell, then sail along by that point of
Surp, toward Narghen, leaving it on the larboard side off you, going on still
east, until you come to the east end of Nargen. Being there by it, then go on
eastsoutheast a league and an half, and then you shall come by the end of the
riffe, which lies off from the Blote Karels, Riffe off the Karels.
come no nearer it then in six fathom. When as the castle of Revel comes
without the Karels, then sail right unto the head of Revell Revell.
until you come to the east side, let your anchor fall there, and then hawl
with the fore-ship or stearne, to the head, and make you fast by four cables,
for the north and northnorthwest winds which blow there flat open in, making
it a lee shore, so that sometimes with such winds there comes in a rolling
sea.

East about 4 leagues from the south end of Nargen, lies the Island the Wolf,
which is about a league long.

Northnorthwest, and northwest and by north two leagues from the west end of
the Island the Wolf, and northeast and northeast and by east from the north end
of Nargen lies a rock under water, called the Revel-stone, although there be
no more water upon then 3 or 4 foot, yet it is in the Summer time with fair
weather, oftentimes so smooth water, that it does not break upon it, and it is
also very steep, so that you may not come nearer it by your lead then in 12
fathom. The marks for to know the place of this Revel-stone Revell-stone.
are these: When the northeast end of Nargen is southwest and southwest and by
west from you, and the high steeple of Revell is a capstane bars length, or a
little more to the westwards off the west end of the Island the Wolf, then you
are right thwart of this rock. The steeple of Revel is also the right south
from you. But when the steeple of Revell comes to the Wolf, The Wolf
and that you are bound to the eastwards, and you are surely past this
Revell-stone, and a good ways to the eastwards of it.

From the west end of the Island the Wolf lies off a riff to the northwards
into sea, about an English mile toward the Revell-stone, upon the end of this
riffe lie five or six rocks a little above water. If you come away from Revell
on north and by west along by the Wolf, then mark the point of Surp, when
that comes even unto the south end of the Island Nargen, then you shall also
have even the length of the foresaid riffe. If you look out then on the
starboard side, and be not sailed very sarre along to the westwardes of the
Wolf, you shall see the foresaid rocks (lying upon the end of the riffe) lie
thwart from you, and then you may run to the northwards about by them in five
fathom without doing amiss.

Betwixt Nargen and the Wolf lies also a stony shoale which is very broad, but
much nearer Narghen then the Wolf, and lies from the south point or Narghen
shoale of Nargen.
about northeast, and from the north point eastsoutheast. Therefore if you bring
the south point of Nargen about southwest or southwest and by south, and the
foresaid north point westnorthwest from you, and that the Wolf lie then free
from the main land, you shall not miss to fall upon this shoale.

You may sail round about Nargen, Nargen.
and also anchor under it for northerly and westerly winds in 10, 12, 14 and 18
fathom.

From Nargen to the Island Wranger, the course is east, seven leagues. The
lying there of you may see in the following directions.

Of the Coast of Finland betwixt the Alands Haffe and Elsenvos.
Betwixt Uxe or Bostell on the coast of Sweden, and the Island of Aland,
Alandts.
goes in the Alands Haff, which men do call the North Bodem, which lies up so
far to the northwards into Finland, that a ship with good fresh way should
scarce be able to sail to the end off it in five days, upon the farthest end
of this North Bodem lies the town Toreu, there Sweden is parted from Finland.

At the outermost rocks off Finland on the Alands Haff lie Islands, Ercke,
Castelholm and Corpe. Ercke Castelholm Corpse.
Ercke is the westermost of all, and the outermost, from thence goes in the
Corpe sound, northeast along thwart off Castelholm and Corpe. Corpe lies
within the other Island, and from Corpe you may edge over into the Liet off
Abbo, which comes running off from Uttoy: you may alsoo sail up into this
channel about behind Lipland, and so come out into the North Bodem.

Uttoy is a great Island, upon it stands a great mast with a barrel for a
beakon, and lies from the Island Corpe east and west about nine leagues. On
the west side of Uttoy Uttoy.
goes up the Liet of Abbo, which lies in first north and north and by east
about three or four leagues, and then you come on against a great Island. And
then it lies in along that great Island northeast unto the the Sound of
Abbo. Abbo.
Abbo lies at the end of that foresaid great Island. This Liet runs up
along to the eastwards through betwixt the rocks about thirteen leagues,
within it lies a rock under water which is a Magnes Magnes.
or Lodestone, also the ground seems to be there of the virtue of the
Lodestone, or when you come thereabouts, the compasses do not stand, but run
and turn without any certain standing still, until that you be at least a
league past it, and then they begin to stand right again. From thence it lies
east and east and by south all along through the rocks unto the Rough Island,
to the westwards of it runs the channel of Luys into the sea, when you are
thwart of it sea, you may see the land of Revel. It is there betwixt them both,
to wit, betwixt the Out rocks and Nargen, or the land thereabouts ten leagues
broad.

The Out-rocks of Luys, and the channel of Uttoy lie east and west about 21 or
22 leagues distant, although it be there betwixt them both all broken land, and
full of rocks, yet nevertheles there are no havens nor channels fit for ships
to come into.

From Luys Luys.
along without the Rocks to the channel of Elsenvos, the course is east and
by north 15 or 16 leagues, but Nargen or the Wolf, and channel of Elsenvos lie
northnortheast and southsouthwest about 16 or 17 leagues asunder.

The fourth Demonstration, Where in The Sea-Coastes between the Wolf and the
outtermost of the East Sea.
THe Island Wranger Wranger.
lies from Nargen east distant 7 or 8 leagues, and 3 leagues east and by south
from the wolf.

Under Wranger is on both sides good road and good anchor ground, especially on
the south side, where there is a Bay, there you may anchor betwixt the two
points in ten, twelve, or fourteen fathom, according as shall be convenient,
and lie sheltred for a northeast and east, and also for a northwest and west
wind. You may sail round about Wrangher, but from some points (as from the
south point, and from the north point) lie off some little riffes, whereof you
must take heed, and be careful in using the lead when you sail about by them.

About an English mile from Wrangher lies little Wranger, Little Wranger.
a little long small Island, lying about northwest and southeast, which is
rocky and foul, especially on the northeast side. From the southeast point
runs off also a rocky riff whereof you must take heed.

On the southwest side is good anchoring for northeast and east winds, anchor
under it so that the southeast point lie about east from you, there is good
lying for northeast and east winds.

From the northwest point runs off also a little riffe, GREAT AND SMALL
WRANGER.
which you may sound about in four, five or six fathom, according as your ship
goes deep, when as you will go to anchor there, coming from the northwards,
or about to the northwards, of the Island.

About a great league north from the east end of Wranger, and two little
leagues north and by west from little Wranger lies a little Island, which by
some is called Kuyken, but commonly is called the Kocxschaer, Kocxschaer.
which is a little bare rock with a Warder upon it, you may sail round about
it on both sides, it lies from the Wolf northeast and by east distant two
great leagues.

From Wranger to Eckholme, the course is east and by south 14 leagues.

Three leagues by west the Eckholms lies an outpoynt to the eastwards of it is
a Bay, called the Monkwyke, there it is good anchoring for southwest and west
winds in 8, 10, or 12, fathom. Betwixt this point of the Monkwyke Monkwyke.
and Wranger lie 3 little long Islands, lying along the coast of Lysland,
about a half league from the shore which are very foul and rocky, and almost
nothing but rocks, whereof you must take heed, otherwise the coast betwixt them
both is clean.

The Island Eckholm Eckholm.
is clean round about, and lies about northwest and southeast, it shows it
self high at both ends and in the midst with a Valley. Under Eckholm is good
anchoring at the northeast side for west and southwest winds in 20, 22 and 25,
fathom, and on the southwest side for easterly winds.

Five leagues to the eastwards of Eckholm lies the Castle Telsburgh, Telsburg.
thwart of it lies off a shoale from the shore, but you may sound it in 8 or
9 fathom. From thence the coast lies along most east and by south unto the
road of the Narve about 15 leagues, it is altogether clean without foul
ground, so that you may also sail along there by night in 8 or 9 fathom
without fear.

Northwards from this coast in the fareway betwixt Eckholm and the Island of
Highland lie the Chalk grounds, Hosts, the little and great Tutters, all of
them with very dangerous foul grounds and shoales. Eckholm and Highland lie
eastnortheast and westsouthwest distant about 10 leagues. About 2 or 3 leagues
east from Eckholm, and also 2 leag. from the main land lie the Chalkgrounds,
Chalckgrounds.
which are foul grounds, almost 3 leag. long under water, and lie to the
westwardswestnorthwest into the sea, and to the eastwards almost to the riffe
of the Hosts. Some say that they are fast to it, so that you should not be
able to sail through betwixt them.

The Hoftes Hoftes.
lies southsouthwest from High-land about 5 or 6 leagues, which is a long
small Island foul round about, with two foul riffes that lie out, the one De
Zeecusten van LIIF LAND T. end Oost Finlandt. van Wolfs-oort tot aen Wyborgh.
lies off somewhat to the eastwards, and the other to the westwards unto the
Chalck-grounds.

Northwards from the Hoftes lie the little Tutters, and 2 leagues to the
eastwards of the little Tutters lie the great Tutters.

The little Tutters Little Tutters.
are two Islands not high but round about rocky, rissy, and foul, they lie
southwest and south about three leagues from Highland.

The great Tutters Great Tutters.
lie from the little Tutters east southeast about 2 leagues, and from Highland
south also three leagues, there lies off from it also a great stony riffe
westwards toward the little Tutters: there lies also betwixt the little and
great Tutters a row of rocks, where of you must take heed when you will sail
through betwixt them.

South and by east about two leagues from the great Tutters lies a shoale of
five fathom. He that will sail to the southwards of these foresaid Islands and
shoales Shoale.
toward the Narve, may be mindful thereof, it lies about four leagues to
the eastwards of Telsburgh: two or three leagues from the shore.

Betwixt the great Tutters and Highland lies a shoale upon which there is no
more then six foot water.

Southeast a great half league from the south end off Highland lies another
shoale of a fathom and half and two fathom deep.

To the northwards off al these foresaid rocky Islands and soul shoales, lies
a little Island whereupon stands a Mast for to know it by, and to descerne it
from the other little foul Islands, that you may come indifferent near to it,
but not too near, for it is also somewhat rocky and foul, but not far off,
it lies from the little Tutters west and by north and west northwest about
three leagues, from the Island Highland southwest and by west at least four or
five leagues, but from Wranger east somewhat southerly eighteen or nineteen
leagues.

He that will sail off from Wranger toward the Narve along to the
northwardes of these foresaid grounds, and does get sight of this little Island
with the mast, may thereby the better know to direct his course but it is not
wisdom to sail through these foresaid shoales, except for them that are very
well acquaited.

The Island Highland or Hooghland, Highland or Hooghland.
is about four leagues long, and a league broad-lying southsoutheast and
northnorthwest. When you come out of the west, it arises in three hommocks, so
high to see to as Coll in the Sea reach, upon the north end and upon the east
side it does stand all full of trees. A little about the north point on the
east side is a little bay thwart of a Boers house, there it is clean ground and
good lying for westerly s.w. winds, somewhat to the southwards of it, not very
far from the shore, lies a great rock above water. At the north end is also
good lying for a southeast wind. Along the southwest side you may also anchor
every where in sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen fathom close by the land for
east and northeast winds.

From the southwest side of Highland unto the road of the Narve, the course is
southeast and southeast and by south about fifteen leagues, and then you run
through betwixt the Highland and the Tutters.

Likewise when as you sail on northwest from the road of the Narve, then you
run along betwixt the Tutters and Highland, but you must be very careful,
and take heed off the foresaid shoales, which ly betwixt them both.

The land of the Narve men do know by three high hills, lying a league to the
westwards, or to the southwards of the road, and a league further to the
westwards stand some little houses upon the high land.

The town of the Narve The Narve.
lies upon a river about two leagues within the land. For to sail in there
men were wont to look out for a long hill, which lies on the south side within
the rivers mouth, and at the east end goes down somewhat steep, with some
high trees to the eastwards of it, then they brought the wooden tower of the
Narve to the northwards of the foresaid trees, and did run in so with it. When
as the eastermost of the three foresaid hills (a league to the westwards of the
rivers mouth) come over a little hommocke, which lies on the water side, then
they were upon the bar of the rivers mouth, there was upon the shoalest ten
foot water, and then they sailed up the river, that was wont (for some years)
to be so, but it is possibly since that time more or less altered, like as it
does oftentimes happen in such rivers.

From the road of the Narve to the Russe-haecks, Russe-haecks.
the course is north and by west five leagues, which lie with many rocks a good
ways off from the shore. The point thwart of it is called the point of
Castrum after a little town (so called) lying there.

From the Russe-haecks north 5 leagues lies a little Island, called Rette
Sarre, Rette-Sarre.
from which there runs off a rif south into sea. From this Island, to the
Summers, the course is north and by west, westerly 4 or 5 leag.

Eastsoutheast and southeast and by east from Highland, and three leagues from
the Russe-haecks lies another shoale, called the Slimme grounds,
Slimme-grounds.
it lies long and small along northnorthwest and southsoutheast, with hard
wind you may see it break in four or five places: when it is west from you
about half a league, there it is two fathom deep to 3, 4, 5 and 6 fathom
uneven ground, some of the rocks of it lie also above water.

From the Russe-haecks to the Rode-hell, the course is northeast and by north
about three and twenty leagues, betwixt them both on the Russe side, run also
diverse rivers into the land, but there it no trade. The land there lies in a
great bight, it lies first from the Russe-haecks unto the River of Nioa, or
Oreschacke eastnortheast about 22 leagues, that parts Rusland from Finland by
a great Mere or water, called the Lading. The Lading.


The strong castle of Noetenburgh lies there also upon a river which lies out
of the Lyslands or east sea into the foresaid Lading. Further the land lies
northwest, about fifteen or sixteen leagues unto the Rode-hell.

For to sail from Revell to Wyburgh.
From a little to the northwards of the Kocxschaer to Highland, the course is
east and by north a little more easterly 23 leagues, with that course you run
along a little to the northwards of it. You may sail about Highland on both
sides, but along to the northwards of it is the right fare-way for these that
are bound to Wybrough. A half league north and by west from Highland lies a
sunken rock under water. For to avoid it you must sail close along by
Highland. Further, the lying of Highland has been described here before.

From Highland to the Summers, Summers.
the course is east seven leagues. Summers is a rock or little Island almost
like the Eartholms, it shows it self in 3 hommocks. A little to the
eastwards off it lie some rocks above water: you may sail about on both sides
of Summers, and also through betwixt Summers and the foresaid rocks that lie to
the eastwards of it: but about to the northwards of it is the right fareway,
you cannot also run along far to the northwards of it, for a half league
to the northwards of it, it is very foul and full of little rocks, some above
and some under water.

From the Summers to the Goeschaer, Goeschaer of great Fishers.
the course is northeast and by north more easterly seven leagues. The
Goeschaer which by some is called the great Fisher is a long and broken Island
of 7 rocks, therefore it is also called the Seven-rocks, it lies not far from
the land, so that you cannot get sight of it, before that you come nearer it,
it shows it self when you shall first see it, in 4 hommocks, as if it were 4
little low Islands, you must leave it lying a half league on the larboard
side, for to avoid a sunken rock which lies off from it southsoutheast a great
shot of a cast piece. When the water is not very smooth, but a little grown,
you may perceive it by the breaking of the water: you may also well sail to
the northwards of this sunken rock, to wit, through betwixt the suncken rock
and the Goeschaer; then you must run indifferent close along by Goeschaer;
when it is northwest and by north from you, then you are past the foresaid
suncken rock, whether that you run along to the northwards or to the
southwards of it. Northwest and by north behind the great Fisher you may
anchor in a good haven, between the cliffes where upon the south Corner of a
cliff there stands a warder, wherein if you lie there you are free from all
Icedrifts.

From the Goeschaer or great Fisher to the little Fisher, the course is
northeast and by east three leagues. The little Fisher is a bare round rock
which lies not far from the land: when you come near it, you may know it
well from the other rocks, because there lie none far from the land alone,
you may sail about it on both sides, but along to the southwards of it is
the right fareway. About a shot of a cast piece southeast, or southeast and by
east from this little Fisher, lies a black rock with the top even above water,
almost like a buy upon the Flyestreame, to see to a far off as if it where a
Seals head. This rock you must leave on the starboard side, and run through
betwixt it and the Fisher but there is a piece of it driven off with a strong
Icedrift so that as many say there is not much fear to be made of it.

He that must turn to windwards thereabouts, let him not come very near this
rock, for men do hold that there lie more rocks by it under water.

Both the Fishers are otherwise clean round about; so that you may also find
road under them.

From the little Fisher to the point Corsnes, Corsnes.
which the Lubickers do call Kruysoort, the course is eastnortheast somewhat
easterly a league. Corsnes is a point going off low of the maine land, not very
clean, which you must leave on the larboard side. To the westwards of Corsnes
lie two little Islands close to the land. Thwart of the point lies a rock
almost like a boat, you may run about by it in four fathom and a half, but
not near. On the east side of that point you may anchor for Westerly winds in
five or six fathom.

About two leagues thwart off from Corsnes, lie very many rocks, some one
fathom, some a half fathom, some more, and some less under water, you may not
go out of the fareway without great fear and danger. It is impossible to
describe all the uneven grounds, the great multitude of rocks and rocky shoales
which are lying thereabouts.

From Corsnes to the Island Rodehell, Rodehell.
the course is northeast and by east about three leagues. Rodehell is a great
rough Island with a saddle in the midst, which you must leave lying on the
starboard side. The north point is a red point, there stand up long staves over
end, like unto a Warder in Norway, you must go close along by them, or you
may run in amidst the channel, according as shall be best convenient, but
you may not go close by the north point over against it (which the Dutch
shippers do call Jan Lambertsons point) because of a stony and steep little
riff which lies of from it, but you may runn about by it upon your lead in
seven or eight fathom, but may come no nearer; the right fareway betwixt then
both is fourteen and fifteen fathom deep.

Betwixt the point of Corsnes and the Rode-hell, it is not without danger to
turn to windwards, especially you must be very careful not to run too far over
to the south wards, but to the northwards, toward the maine land it is
indifferent clean: It is there in the fareway fifteen fathom deep, soft
clay-ground.

For not to miss this foresaid channel; or the north point of the Rode-hell,
then take the mark out a stearne of the little Fisher, bring that even without
the point of Corsnes, and keep it so standing sailing toward the Rode-hell,
and so you shall not fail to fall right before the channel. This is a sure
mark whereupon you may trust. If you fall somewhat to the southwards of the
foresaid channel, you can see opening, but seems to be all whole to the
maine land, so that men (that are not well acquainted) might not know where to
seek the channel, but sailing to the northwards the channel does open itself.

When as you shall be then within the foresaid point of Rode-hell, you may
anchor there where you please, and fetch a Pylot from the land, which may bring
you up to the town Wybrough. It is there within fifteen fathom deep, and good
soft clay-ground.

If you will (being come within the Rode-hell) sail up to Wybrough, then go on
east and by south a shot of a cast piece unto a black point, leave that about 2
cables lengths on the larboard side, for there it is not clean. Being a little
past this black point, then go on northeast, or eastnortheast a half league,
and then you shall come against a great white sand-bay, but before you come by
this sand-bay, you shall meet a rock with a gray stone like a buy upon the
Flyestream, leave that foresaid rock on the starboard side, and the gray stone
on the larboard side, and run amidst the channel through betwixt them both,
there it is three fathom deep. It is in no wise to be done to sail up there
for him that has not been re before, but it is best to anchor a little within
Rodehell and to let him be brought up by a Pylot.

The Coast of Finland betwixt Elsevos, and Wybrough.
The Channel of Elsevos lies from Narghen or the Wolf northeast and by north
and southwest and by south about seventeen leagues, and from Wranger south and
north.

Upon the west side off the channel lies a high round rock, whereupon
stands a mast, or Warder, called Kubben, Kubben.
over against upon the other side of the channel lies a long rock or Island
called Sautum, Sautum.
and an half league to the eastwards of Kubben lies another great round rock
called Mely. Mely.
These three rocks are the best marks to be known of this foresaid channel.

Betwixt Kubben and Sautum lies that channel in from thence northeast until
that you be within the rocks, and then northnortheast and north and by east,
until you come before the river of Elsenvos, Elsenvos.
there you may anchor betwixt the rocks in good anchor ground.

There runs also a Lies through within the rocks, where you may sail
along, and come out again into the sea by Putsfagre, this runs about very
crooked with many bights, but it is Pilots water.

If you will sail to Borgo, Borgo.
then run a league to the eastwards of the foresaid rock Mely, there you
shall find two high bare rocks, called the Tolcken, run in betwixt them
both, but nearest to the eastermost, which is clean and clear close to it,
and lies somewhat further to seawards then the westermost. Westnorthwest from
this eastermost high rock, lies a little rock above water, leave that on the
larboard side. When as then you shall be by this eastermost rock, which you
leave lying on the starboard side of you, then go on northnortheast to
Schoeland, that is a rough Island off from which lie many bare points, all
which you must leave (with the Island also) on the starboard side, then run
along close by these bare points. When you are past them, go then northeast
and by north, somewhat easterly, and so you shall see two other bare rocks,
the eastermost of the greatness off a ship very steep and high, but the
westermost is small, run in there betwixt them: the Sound is called
Cramerpoort. Cramerpoort.
When you are within them, go then in north and by east, and then you shall
presently meet with a great Island called Carmer, Cramer.
leave that on the starboard side, and so you run right on with an other
great Island, called the Hester, leave that on the larboard side, and anchor
betwixt the 2 Islands Cramer and the Hester, there is good anchor ground.

From the mouth of the Sound of Elsenvos to Pelting-sound, Pelting-sound.
the course is eastsoutheast 13 or 14 leagues. Pelting-sound lies in
northeast, there you lie within a great many great rocks, or little Islands,
sheltred for all winds. You may sail from thence through within the rocks all
over where you desire to be, if you have a good skillful Pilot.

From Peltingschares to Putsfagre Putsfagre.
it is 8 leagues. Putsfagre is a great rock, or Island, lying from High-land
northnorthwest distant five or six leagues. About a league south from this
Island Putsfagre lies a suncken rock, which you must avoid. He that will sail
through within the rocks, let him take a Pilot from Putsfagre, that may bring
him through the rocks where he desires to be: you may run in there every
where, and within the rocks it is most all over good anchor-ground.

From Putsfagre to the Epelschares, Epelschares.
the course is east six leagues: these are a great many out-rocks, a little to
the eastwards of them lies a great rock called Quadeschare which you may sail
round about.

From Epelscharen to the Goeschare, Goeschare.
the course is east somewhat northerly 9 or 10 leagues. That, and the lying of
the land, and dangers from thence eastward, has been described here before.

The fifth Demonstration, Where in Are set forth the Coasts of Sweden,
between Oeland and Stockholm.
ABout two leagues more northerly over against it, on Oeland lies Borckholm,
Borckholm Coping wyke.
a little to the northwards of it lies Copingwyke, where men do lade many
Toomb-stones and other stones, with a northerly wind it is bad lying there.

Northwest, or somewhat westerly from Borckholm, about 3 leagues on the Sweeds
side, lies a Haven in the rocks, where men do lade Beams, to the northwards
of it northwest and by north from Borckholm lies Munsteraas, Munsteraas.
that is a good Haven also for very great ships.

From Calmer to the Sweeds-Ioufer, Sweeds-Ioufer.
the course is northnortheast 9 or 10 leagues, this is a round rock, and very
high, you may see it along over Oeland, being a good ways to the eastwards
of Oeland; it is not very great, but clean round about, so that you may anchor
near under it on every side 18 and 19 fathom, but by reason that it is not
broad, there comes in (with hard winds) a rolling Sea.

From the Sweeds Ioufer to the channel of Westerwyke, or Silbuy, the course is
northnorthwest 7 leagues, but from Northeroorden the north-end of Oeland
northwest 8 leagues.

The channel of Westerwyke and Silbuy is called Idesound, Idesound.
after a great rock lying on the north side of this channel, called Ydehoe,
off from it lie many rocks, some above and some under water 2 great leagues to
seawards, which are called Idebanks. Idebancks


He that will sail from the north-end of Oeland toward the barsound, and by
bare winds does come a little to the westwards, without the right fareway, must
be very careful, and take good heed that he get not in amongst them.

For to know the channel of Westerwyke, you shall see a high bare rock, bring
that northwest from you, and sail so right in with it, and then you shall fall
with the land right before it, and then also you shall espy another bare
rock, whereupon stands a Fishers beakon, and also another to the southwards
of it, with a mast, sail in betwixt the two rocks, the channel lies in
northwest and northwest and by north when you are come within them you may
sail along through the rocks where you desire to be, to Silbuy, Strixholm,
Flourbuy, Vrowenberg, Westerwy-up to the northwards to Schelsuyt and other
places more, there it is all clean ground, and 12, 15, 18, and 20 fathom deep.

If you be bound to Silbuy, Silbuy.
then sail up to the northwards or eastwards until you come before the town,
and anchor there in the midst between the rocks in 7, 8 and 9 fathom.

If you be bound to Flourbuy, Flourbuy.
or Vrowenbergh, then sail in west, and west and by north through the rocks
till you come against the maine land, there you may anchor before Flourbuy, or
sail up northwest betwixt the Island of Vrowenbergh and the maine land, and
anchor there in 12 fathom, also you may run through that way until you come to
Westerwyke. Westerwyke.
Westerwyke lies from Silbuy through within the rock west, and west and by
north there it is in the faireway fifteen and sixteen fathom deep.

From Silbuy to Schelsuyr Schelsuyr.
it is north and by west 7 leagues, all along through within the rocks.
Schelsuyr is a good haven, there lies a rock in the havens mouth, about which
you may run in on both sides, and anchor before the town.

To the eastwards of Schelsuyr lies the Hondtsbay and the Green Island,
Hondsbay Green-Island.
there it is also good anchoring. You may run from Silbuy along by it until
you come in the Sound of Southercoppen and Northcoppen.

From the channel of Westewyke to the Barsound, the coast lies along by the
rocks north and by east 9 leag. But from the north end of Oeland to the
Barsound the course is north and by west 15 leagues, go not more westerly, that
you get not into the sunken rocks and foul grounds of the Idebanks.

The north end of Oeland runs somewat far off flat. If you run out close by
Oeland, and sail on north and by west, then you run along far enough
without the Idebancks, and so shall fall with the land about a half league to
the southwards of Barsound Barsoun^.
against a deal of low out-rocks. It seems a far off (by reason of the
multitude of rocks and little Islands to be all firm land, but coming near
it, it is all broken. You shall see there also an Island by which there seems
to be a channel, but you must be further to the northwards, run along by the
coast in 7 fathom, so long until that you see out a head an high out-rock,
these shall be the Heerscharen, Heerscharen.
which are very foul, and lie off from the north point of the channel, a good
ways eastsoutheast into sea, all which you must leave on the starboard side
and run along by them unto the channel.

When as you come out of the sea, you must take very great heed that you fall
not with the land to the northwards of the channel, that you do not run into
the foresaid Heerscharen. When you come before the channel, you shall see 2
Sound or going in, the southermost seems to be the broadest and fairest, but
the northermost is far the best, and lies in northnorthwest.

On the north side of the channel lies a great rock with a beakon upon it,
and somewhat more to the north wards shows a round hill, by all which marks
this channel is very easy to be known, when you are right before the norther
channel, and do see open into it, then sail in n. w. being come in about a
shot of a cast piece, you shall see on the larboardside two little low Islands,
anchor within them in seventeen or eighteen fathom, there you must hire a Pilot
to bring you up, either to Southercoppen, or Northercoppen, where you desire to
be, it is Pilots water. It is from thence to Southercoppen, about ten leagues,
but to Northercoppen eighteen leagues. In the coming in of the Sound is good
anchor ground in ten fathom. Within Caarte van SWEDEN Van Oelandt tot aen
Stocholm.
Caarte vantgat van ABBO, oste VTTOY.

Caarte van STOCHOLMSE Liet.

in the Sound it is broad and wide, and all over good anchoring in 18 and 20
fathom.

About an English mile within the Sound, you leave (in sailing up) the
Taldersound Taldersound.
on the larboard side, there is no more then 6 or 7 foot water, from thence you
edge up north and also northeast a half league, then again west and by south
about 2 league, afterward westnorthwest a league unto Karholm, which is a
Gentleman's house with a mill.

From Karholm to Stickbrough is further west about two leagues, that is a
castle upon a little Island, you must go about to the southwards of it through
a bridge.

From Stickbrough Stickborg
sail up along the Sound, and leave most of all the rocks (which you see) on
the larboard side, except one or 2 a little above Stickbrough, leave them on
the starboard side. About 2 leagues past Stickbourgh stands a Gentleman's
house called Mem, there is the place where men do lade, a half league from
Southercopping.

For to sail from without the the Northercopping, you run in by the Swartbodem
up westwards unto Schenes and Braburch, and along unto the Barwyk the sound
of Northcopping, or else you must come in at the Barsound through within the
rocks into the Brawyke Brawyke.
unto Northercopping but it is not to be done without a Pilot for them that are
not there very well acquainted, for it is Pilots water.

From the north end of Oeland to the channel Nycopping by the Hevering,
Hevering.
the course is due north about 18 or 19 leagues, but if you run close along
by the end of Oeland, you shall fall with the land a little to the westwards of
the Hevering. The Hevering is a great reddish bare rock, whereupon stand 3 or 4
Fishers beacons, heretofore there was wont to stand up on it a barrel upon a
mast, which men might see far of at sea, but it is taken off in the last wars
between the Kings of Sweden and Denmark, now there stands nothing upon it but
some Warders.

Two great leagues to the westwards of the Hevering, to wit, southwest from
it, lie the foresaid rocks called the Swartboden, Swartboden.
which are great rocks, and are sometimes mistaken for the Hevering, you may
sail in also by these Swartboden, and run through within Oxelen and the other
rocks, and come by the point of Hommelwyke into the right sound of Nycoppen.

When you come before the channel of the Hevering, you can at first hardly see
a channel, or any opening, but bring the great rock the Hevering northwest
from you, and sail so right in, and run-in close along to the northwards of
it. In the sailing in you shall see two channells, the northermost is within
full of dangers, so that you cannot go through there. The right channel by the
Hevering it so narrow, that you can hardly turn too and again there.

From the Hevering you must sail in first n. w. a league and half, or 2
leagues, unto a great rock, leave it on the starboard side, and sail about by
it, and go in along n. w. and by north. A little within the foresaid great
rock, thwart of the point of the Hommelwyke, Hommelwyke.
you shall find also a great rock on the starboard side, you may run about to
the westwards of it until you come within the other rocks and little Islands,
and anchor there in 3 fathom soft ground: but if you will anchor there, then you
must shun somewhat the w. end of the great Holm, because of a suncken rock that
lies even without the point of the rock. From that foresaid road unto
Hassellholm the course is yet in along n. w. and north but with ships of
great draught you must anchor before the channel of Hasselholm. From the
Hevering to the Hassell-holm it is in all about 3 or 4 leag.

From Hassell-holm Hassell-holm.
along upwards through the stone reach, it is not deeper then nine foot, you
must also (if you will sail up there) first set the rocks, or suncken rocks
with beakons with your boat or else you should sometimes sail upon some of the
rocks in seven foot depth. The narrowest of the Stone-reach Stone-reach.
is thwart of an Island which you must leave on the starborard side, off from
which lies a suncken rock in the narrow, you must go close along by the
suncken rock, for to the westwards of it is very shoale water. Being past this
stony ground, you shall get oasie ground, where it is not deeper then six
foot; being come over that by the town Nycopping, Nicopping.
it is again eight foot deep, but stony ground. This ships lie without the
town thwart of the beakons over against the Castle, which lyath on the west
side of the river.

From Hassell-holm to the town Nycopping it is about a league first up north
and by w. and afterward west. For one that is unacquainted, it is not easy to
sail up, it is also Pilots water, so soon as you come within the channel,
you can get a Pilot to bring you where you desire to be.

From Nycopping you may sail along through the rocks to the northwards off
Hassell-holm unto Trosa and Telghen.

Landesoort Landsoort
(which is the west point of the Liet of Stockholm) lies from the Hevering
east and by north distant 6 or 7 leagues.

About half ways betwixt both lies a great high rock very easy to be known,
a good ways without the land alone called Hartsoe, Hartsoe.
and a little league to the westwards of Landsoort lie also some foul
out-rocks, called the Heyr-hamer. When as you sail from the Hevering on
eastnortheast, then you run along a little without the Hartsoe, leaving it on
the larboard side. With that coursey, on cannot also sail too near the
Heyr-hamer, Heyr-hamer.
and then you leave it lying also on the larboard side toward the land.

The land to the westwardes of Landsoort lies w. or w. and by north with
diverse great rocks and havens where you may sail into, About a league to the
westwards of it lies a haven within a low rock in betwixt two other low Rocks,
there you must make you fast with cables on both shoares, and with an anchor in
the Sound. Before the havens mouth lies a high round rock, which shuts the
havens mouth.

A little to the westwards off Hartsoe goes in a haven or Deep, where you may
run through with Barks within Elsnap unto Stock-holm.

A little to the westwards of that Deep lies the Sound of Telghen lying in
northwest, almost unto the great Lack de Mell, upon the end of that Sound
lies Telgen, but at the mouth of the Sound lies a little town Torsa.

About an English mile southwest from the point of Landsoort, lie 2 rocks even
with the water, and within these rocks close by Landsoort lies also a suncken
rock. He that comes from the southwardes, being bound to Stokholm, and
falls with the land to the westwards of the point of Landsoort, must take
heed of them; you may sail within these two rocks (lying even with the water)
to wit, betwixt them and the foresaid suncken rock, and also (as Pilots say)
you may sail through within the suncken rock, that is, betwixt the suncken
rock and the main land.

Landsoort and the north point of Oeland lie southsouthwest and northnorthe. a
little more northerly and a little more southerly distant 23 or 24 leagues. If
you sail on northnortheast from the north end of Oeland, you shall fall with
the land right with Landsoort, or a little to the eastwards of it. It is better
to fall with the land somewhat to the westwards of it, then to the eastwards of
it, to the westwards the land is better to be known then the rocks to the
eastwards off it. Therefore when as you will sail from the north end of Oeland
to Stockholm, especially in dark weather, go on somewhat more northerly then
n. n. e. or north and by east, and then you shall run in sight off the
foresaid rock Hartsoe, which is easy to be known.

The Lies of Stockholm goes in northeast by the point of Landsoort. About a
league east from the pointly some black rocks, some above and some under water,
called the Karwasen. Betwixt them and the point, about once so near the
Karwasen, as the point, lies an other black rock, not great called the young
Karwasen, betwixt that rock and the point off Landsoort, men do sail into the
channel of Stock-holm. Close to the point lies also a little Island which you
must leave on the larboard side, and run along to the eastwards of it, a
league northeast from the point lies the Wigstone, W gstone
lying southeast or eastsoutheast thwart off from the shore. This a somewhat a
long rock with tree hommocks, the two westermost are the greatest, and show
like a saddle the eastermost hommock is the smallest, upon it stands a little
walled cape, you must sail along to the eastwards of it, and leave the rock
on the larboard side. You may well sail also about to the westwards of this
Wigstone, it is clean round about, but on the west side it is narrowest,
betwixt it and the land lies also a rock, with a little rock off from it,
which you must avoid.

A league northeast from the Wigstone lies the Middle-stone, M^ddle-stone.
which is a great high rock with a great cliff or saddle, with another great
rock a little to the westwards of it: you cannot sail through betwixt them,
they are fast one to the other with rocks. In sailing up men leave this
Middle-stone on the starboard side, and run about to the westwards of it.

From by east the Wigstone to the Middle-stone, to wit, along to the
westwards of it, the course is northnortheast. About a great English mile east
from the Wigstone, and north from the Karwasen lies another rock, called the
Gomberg-stone G^mberg stone.
and to the eastwards of it another, called Schaeropen. When you sail from the
Wigstone to the Middle-stone, you leave them both on the starbord side.

Thwart of the Middlestone, on the Westland lies the haven of Ramskloof,
^^ms^o^f.
there you may anchor within the rocks. The Middle-stone lies about a half
league southwest from the east point of the Lies, to wit, from the e. point
off the main land, or the Swedes schares, betwixt them both goes in a
channel, called the Danske channel. D^nske-c^annell.
For to sail in there you must avoid the foresaid east point a good ways off
(whereupon stands a mill) and run in by the Middle-stone, for from that point
runs of a great ledge off rocks a good ways to seawards, toward the
Middle-stone. From by west the Middlestone to Elsnap; the course is northeast
three leagues.

When you are a little past the Middle-stone, you come in betwixt the two
lands, and a little within the east point you shall meet with a rock in the
fareway, called the Red-Cow. R^d Cow.
You may sail about it on both sides, but men leave it commonly on the
starboard side, within that rock, that is on the north side you may anchor.

Elsnap El^nap.
is a haven behind two little Islands, where the Kings ships of wart do
commonly lie to tarry for a wind, when they are bound to sea, there it is very
easy lying, when with contrary winds you can neither get up nor down, you can
come in and out there both from the northwards and from the southwards very
conveniently. Coming from the southwards, you can see over the southermost
little Island, the masts of the ships that lie behind it. For to sail in there
behind it, run in about by the s. point of the Island Elsnap behind it, and
then you leave a little black rock on the south side of the havens mouth lying
on the larboard side. Betwixt the two little Islands of Elsnap runs also a
channel through where you may go through with Huyes and small ships. From
thwart of Elsnap, the course is inwards northnortheast about two leagues, to
the Red-holm, Redholm
that is a great Red round rock grown full of trees, to the westwards off it
lies another smaller bare rock, the fareway is there in through betwixt them,
and about a musket shot broad in this narrow it is all over good anchor-ground.
From the north end of the Redholm lies off a great row off rocks unto the east
shore of the Lies, where you must sail through. When as you sail through
betwixt the Redholm and the foresaid bare rock to the eastwards of it, go then
on yet about an English mile further northnortheast until you come thwart of
the fourth channel counting from the Red-holm which lies through the foresaid
row of rocks to the northwards of the Redholm, that is called S. John's
channel, S. John's. channel.
it lies through about northnorthwest, or somewhat more northerly, it is a
short Inlet, run through there. Being through S. John's channel, go again
northnortheast about an English mile to the Red-holm, which is a long rock upon
it stand three barrels upon masts, this you must leave on the larboard side,
and run along to the eastwards of it. From the north point of that Red-holm
Redholm.
runs of a little riffe or shoale, which you must avoid. From the Red-holm
unto the great Daler, Great Daler.
the course is northw. and by north, that is a haven on the west side of the
Liet, there lies a Churchyard within on the land, where the slain Poles
people in the last Polish wars lie buried, Thwart of that Churchyard is a
Sand-bay, there is good anchor ground, like as is all over in that foresaid
haven. At the north point of the haven the great Daler lies a suncken rock
close by the land, called the Saltsack, Saltsack.
upon which is no more ten nine foot water. From the great Daler, the course is
along northeast, a half league unto the little Daler, Little Daler.
which is a high steep rock, the highest that you find amongst all the the
rocks in the Lies, run along to the westwards of it, and leave it on the
starboard side. Over against it on the west side lies another rock, which is
called also the Daler, to the westwards of it, to wit, betwixt that rock and
the main land, is also an opening, where you may sail through. A little within
that foresaid rock on the westland goes in the Hardstick Hartstrick
which is a Sound that lies in first west, and west and by north, a good ways
in, and then northwest and commet into the Lies to the northwards of Waxholm,
by Kings haven. The Kings Majesty has caused to sink some ships in the mouth
of the Sound, so that men cannot go through there with great ships, but only
with little barks. From the little Daler, the course is northnorthwest about a
half league to Steendeur, Steendeur
a great Island, which you must leave on the starboard side, and run close
along by it and so you shall leave a round rock to the southwards over
against it on the larboard side, and sail through betwixt them: this channel
lies through northwest. At the west end of the great Island Steendeur lies a
little black rock, you must run about by it again to the eastwards.

From Steendeur to Kow-haven, Kow haven.
the course is eastnortheast two leagues, that is a rock lying in the broad
Sound, leave it on the starboard side, and sail to the westwards of it along
by the west land unto Berck-haven. Betwixt both about half ways lies a haven,
called the Crosse-haven, there it is good lying for west and northwest winds.

Berckhaven Berckhaven.
lies from Cow-haven northeast and by north distant about two leagues: this is
a haven betwixt two Islands where is good anchoring for all winds, as well for
them which come from Stockholm, and desire to sail to the Northbodem, as also
for them that will sail off toward Landsoort, there is (like as at most
places betwixt the rocks and Islands) good clay ground. When you come from
Kow-haven, and are bound to Stockholm, you must leave these two Islands of
Berck-haven on the starboard side, and run in about betwixt them and the point
of the maine land. From the narrow betwixt Berck-haven and the foresaid point
to Duer-haven Deur-haven.
the course is northwest about a half league. On the southwest side of that
fareway thwart of the point over against Duer-haven, lie two suncken rocks on
each side of the point one, the one on the northwest side, and the other on the
southeastside, commonly there stands upon each of them a little tree for a
beakon.

From the point of Deur-haven unto the Draybome, Draybom
the course is southwest and by west somewhat westerly about a half league, it
is called also the Duer-haven, of from the point with in the Islands until you
come before the buy, along there, and also within the Islands, it is good
lying every where.

The litttle Islands which lie in the channel of the Draybome, you must leave
them on the starboard side of you.

From the Draybome to the Windstream, Windstream.
the course is first north, and north and by west until about half ways,
there you shall find a little Island with a little tree, leave that on the
larboard side, and go from thence in n. northwest to the Windstream. In the
Windstream is a good anchoring by the shore, except in the north end of the
stream, there is no anchor ground. From the Draybome to the Windstream it is
about a league distance.

From the Windstreame to the Seugh, The Seugh.
the course is westnorthwest a half league, that is a chindle or stonebanck
even with the water, run along to the northwards of it, and leave it on the
larboard.

From the Seugh to Scheggen, Scheggen
the course is west and by north a league, run along there by the south
shore. When you come against Scheggen, you shall see upon the point of the
south shore a little round tree, over against that little tree somewhat more
northerly then in the middle off the channel, lies a suncken rock, for to
avoid it you must run nearest the south shore. The reach off Scheggen lies
through west, and west and by south about an English mile, it is narrow, but
has every where anchor ground.

From Scheggen, the course is westsouthwest an English mile to Steck-sound, or
west to Kings-deep, the little Islands on the starboard side, Steck-holm.
as you sail to Steck-sound, are clean round about, so that you may go on
all sides about by them.

Coming close to Steck-sound you shall find a suncken rock a little by south
the fareway. The Steck-sound lies through southsouthwest, it is a short Inlet
about a cables length long.

From Steck-sound unto Waxholm Waxholm.
it is southwest westerly above an English mile. Upon Waxholm stands the
Kings Castle, there all the ships are visited whether they go up or down, the
channel there by it, is paled to so near, that they can shut it with a bar.

From Waxholm to the Wester reach, Wester reach.
the course is westsouthwest and through the Wester reach southwest. From
thence along west to Eeldam, that is a very narrow channel a little more
then a ships length broad.

From Eeldam, Eeldam.
the course is west to Mouseholm, which is about a league from Waxholm, men
leave the high rough Mouse-holm on the starboard side, and run along by it to
the southwards.

From the Mouse-holm Mouse-holm.
to Kings-haven it is a league west, and west and by north all along by the
southland.

From Kingshaven Kings haven.
unto the town Stockholme, the course is northwest, and northwest and by west,
also a league distance along by the shore. When you come before the Town, you
may anchor where you please.

He that falls to leewards, or by any other accident cannot come by Landsoort
into the Liet of Stockholm, Stockholm.
he may sail in more to the northwards through diverse channels. Amongst others
there is one where men may sail into, and come by the great Daler into the
Lies: there goes another in by the Swedes-sand, through it men come by
Berck-haven into the Lies. The knowledge off this channel is a very high
rock, with another that is not so high, thereby to the southwards of it,
betwixt these two rocks goes in this channel, it is very narrow in the
coming in, not above two ships lengths broad. So soon as you come in within
these rocks, you may edge up about by the lowest, which is the southermost, and
anchor under it in very good anchor ground.

From that road in the Swedes sands the Sound goes up first about n. w. and by
north, and n. west, 5 leagues unto Berker-haven into the Lies of Stockholm.
This is a very easy channel as well for to sail in as out, but because it is
not easy to be known, coming in out the sea, it is seldom used.

To the southwards or the westwards off these two foresaid rocks, at the
coming in of this channel, it is all low land. If you come from the
southwards, and run along by that low land, so long until that you begin to
get the high land, you shall also run in sight of these two foresaid hommocks.
About a league to seawards from them, lie three or four small rocks; for to
sail in there you must leave them on the starboard side, and in sailing out on
the larboard side.

From the south-end of Oeland to the south-end off Gotland, the course is
eastnortheast and northeast and by east three and twentye or four and twentye
leagues but to the Karels northeast somewhat northerly seven and twenty leagues.

The course along the farewaie, for to sail from the south end of Oeland
through betwixt Oeland and Gotland, is northeast and by north.

The Island Oeland is twenty four leagues long, and a league and half broad,
when men sail along by it, they may count eighteen toward upon it, which
are all flat: then east coast is a clean coast, and lies northnortheast and
southsouthwest, but about 7 or 8 leagues to the southwards of the north end,
there shoots off a little riffe, thwart from the land a great half league
into the sea, which men must avoid: by it goes in a little haven, where
indifferent ships may go in, otherwise Oeland has no havens.

From the south end of Gotland runs off a foul stony riffe, a good ways
in to the sea, you may run about by it upon the lead in seven, eight and nine
fathom.

The Karels are two little high Islands, lying on the west side of Gotland
north and by west about seven leagues from the south point of Gotland, and east
and w. about a half league one from the other the greatest is called the
great Karell, The great Karell.
and lies a great league from the land the smallest, the little Karell, and
lies about a half league from the shore. When you come from the southwards,
the great Karell shows it self in two hommocks, and the little Karell
Little Karell.
in one hommock, and nearer to the land. Under the little Karell is round about
good road, in eight, nine, and ten fathom, and is round about clean and
clear, without foul grounds. Men do anchor betwixt it and the land, in six
or seven fathom, there it is good lying for all winds, as well for them that
are bound to the eastwards, as to the westwards. He that shall be to the
northwards of Gotland, and shall get a contrary wind, may also anchor under
the great Karell, but under the Little Karell is far the best road. Under
the great Karell men may anchor, on the west and east side but on the north and
south side it is soul, therefore come no nearer it by night, then in eleven or
twelve fathom. Betwixt the two Karels it is thirteen and fourteen fathom deep.

About half ways betwixt the Karels and the south end off Gotland,
southsoutheast from the Karell, lies the haven Boswyke: Boswyke.
thwarte of it runs off a riffe, an the north side of the haven a good ways
from the shore, come no nearer it then in seven or eight fathom. When you are
thwart of the south point, about a half league from the land, and will sail
along to the northwards of Gotland, you must not sail on more northerly then
northwest, as well for to avoid that riffe of Boswyke, as for to sail a
weather the Karels.

Four leagues northeast from the Karel, lies the Island Reefholm, Reefholm
thwarte of it men do run into Westergorte: you may sail and anchor round
about it. A little to the northwards of it lies the northwest point of Gotland.

Two leagues to the northwardes of the high point lies the town Wisbuy, about
seven leagues northeast from the Karell. Men were wont in old time to lie there
behind a great head or Chest.

Wisbuy Wisbuy.
has been in times past a famous merchant town, where was wont to be driven
great trade of merchandise, but it is now through the will of God, altogether
fallen down, and come to nothing. The Hance towns haven a long time there held
their staple. The old Sea laws were made there, and also the old famous
Read-carde. Men may see yet to this day many old ruinous houses of costly
marble and hewn stones, whereby men may partly perceive and Judge, what manner
of staltenisse there has been.

From Wisbuy the coast lies forth northeast and by east toward the end of
Gotland about nine leagues. But from the Karell to Gotshe sand, the course is
northeast one and twenty or two and twenty leagues: there is a little Island,
whereupon dwells no people, and stands full of trees: you may sail round
about it, which has a white strand. From the northwest point thereof shoots
off a little riff, and likewise one from the south point, a good ways off into
sea, toward the north end of Gothland. On every side of Gotsche sand, you may
anchor in six, seven, eight, nine, ten and twelve fathom, all clean and good
anchor ground, but these foresaid riffes you must avoid. It lies
northnortheast six leagues distant from Faro, the north end of Gotland, when
you ly there under it at anchor, you cannot see Gotland.

The Copper stone lies from Gotsche sand north west and by west distant three
great leagues.

Upon the south end of the east side of Gotland stands a high tower, called
Howbrough, and thereafter the south end of Gotland also is called Howbrough. By
it goes in a little river, before which you may anchor in six or seven fathom.

Five leagues northeast from the aforesaid south point lies Heyligh-holm,
which is a good haven, but by reason it is but little used, it is therefore
also but little known.

Two leagues to the eastwards of Heyligh-holm lies the haven of Narwyck, upon
the east side of the Haven lies a long rock, by which you must run in, and
leave another sharp rock on the larboard side, within the haven you may anchor
in four or five fathom.

Two leagues to the eastwards of it lies Sandwyk which is a good haven for a
west, northwest, northeast, and southeast wind, and lies in about north, a
south wind blows there open in: On the east point, (which is a low bare
point) lies a Holme, which is fast to the land, upon it stands a Warder:
From this point runs off a little sandriffe, which you may sound about in
five or six fathom. Within at this Holm is a bridge of Masts which lies off a
little from the shore. If you will anchor there in the Haven, then run in
along by the east shore, until you come within the bridge, and anchor there
nearest shore, so that the foresaid east point do stand southeast, or
southeast and by south from you, in four fathom, four and an half, or five
fathom, there is clean clay sand ground, and very easy lying for west, north
and east winds.

A league to the eastwards of Sandwyck lying the Island of Eastergore,
Eastergore.
about half ways betwixt both the ends of Gotland n.e. from the s.w. point,
this is a bare Island without trees. Under this Island is very easy road for
all winds, as well for them that are bound to the eastwards, as to the w.
wards. Coming from the westwards, or from Sandwyck along by the land, then
is the northw. point, (which is a high bare gray piont) hidden behind a point
of the maine land of Gotland, so that it seems a far off to be no Island,
but coming near it, it opens it self, that you may see large enough thorough
betwixt them: sail in there betwixt them both in the midst of the channel, it
is there clean and clear, but somewhat uneven of ground, to wit, eight, ten,
twelve and fourteen fathom, but you need not fear. If you will anchor under it
for northeast or east winds, then anchor betwixt the land and the Island, so
that the aforesaid bare gray northwest point stand north, and the southermost
east from you, in nine or ten fathom. Or if you will anchor for a south,
southwest, or west wind, then run further in about by that aforesaid bare gray
point, bring it south-southwest from you, and anchor there in seven, eight,
nine, or ten fathom, there it is clean ground of small white and black sand. A
little to the northwards of the Island is a great Bay on Gotland, there you may
also anchor in seven and eight fathom, for westerly winds.

If you will sail in or out, to the northwards of Eastergore then come not very
near the Island, because there lies off a riffe from the east point far into
the sea, which is a great half league without the land, not deeper then two
fathom and a half, stony and very uneven, and is to be throught, that nearer to
the land it is shoaler and fouler. From the southeast side runs off also a
flat, a good ways to Seawards, at some places not deeper then three, four and
five fathom, and also very uneven, whereof you must take heed.

Four leagues north and by east from Eastergore lies a haven, called Sliet or
Sliet haven, lying in north and north and by west, behind some little Islands,
there it is good lying for easterly, westerly, and n. winds. Upon one of the
norther must little Islands stands a ruinous church. You must come in there
along by the shore from the southwards. From thence to Farosound the coast
lies north and by west two leagues.

Farosound you may run into, in two and three fathom water, there stands a
Church with a flat steeple upon the land, From Farosound lies off a foul
dangerous riffe, a league and half, or 2 leagues into sea, called Salfonteyn,
you must take very good heed there of, when you will run about to the
northwards of Gotland.

From Farosound to Gotschesand, the course is north-northeast, about 7 leagues.

Of the Depths and grounds about these Coasts.
Betwixt the south ends off Oeland and Gotland in the fareway, it is uneven for
to sound, sometimes men have two and twenty, three and twenty, and sometimes
again eight and twenty, nine and twenty, and thirty fathom, all black
mingled ground, sometimes stones so great as pease, of color like black earth.

When Howbrough is northnortheast 7 leagues from you, there it is fifteen
fathom deep, stony ground, from thence on northeast 2 leagues, there it is
twenty fathom deep, foul stony ground. Near about the places, so far from
land that you cannot see Gotland, are bancks, where it is not deeper then
twelve fathom. The like uneve^ grounds are also thwarte of the southend of
Oeland, as has been said in the former, but betwixt them both is deeper
water. If you come in the farewaye from Rye to Brontholm betwixt the south
ends of Gotland and Oeland, and must lie by with contrary winds, when you
are in ten or twelve fathom, and then sail toward Oeland, you shall get
deeper water.

If you lie by betwixt Oeland and Reef-coll, and that Reef-coll come to be
southsoutheast and south and by east from you, so far without the land, that
you cannot see it, then you shall get also the like uneven ground of ten and
twelve fathom, read gross stony sand, and also blackish gross sandy stone
ground. If you be nearest to Oeland, you shall get, in ten or twelve fathom
pittes in the tallowe, so that it seems, that those grounds off Oeland do
run over unto, or near Reef-coll. The like grounds and unevenesse do seem to
lie over the sea also from the south end of Gotland toward Rosehead: for when
the south end of Gotland comes to be about north from you, although it be
fourteen or sixteen leagues from you, you shall find depth of sixteen and
twenty fathom soft ground, like as off from Oeland, but if Gotland be more
easterly or westerly from you, you shall have deeper water.

When you are about a league by west the southwest point of Gotland, so that it
be southeast, or eastsoutheast from you about a league, then the Karels lie
about north from you, which you may even see in clear weather, there aboutes
it is shoale water a good ways off from the shore. When the west point or
steep point is about north from you a little to the eastwards or to the
westwards of it, there is ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, and eighteen
fathom deep, a great ways from the land: but when that point comes to be
northeast, eastnortheast, or east from you, there it is above forty fathom
deep.

Betwixt the southwest point of Gotland, and the north point of Oelandt it is
also very deep, so that there you cannot cast ground with forty fathom.

When you are northwest and northwest and by north about two leagues from
Houbrough there you have great redd stone sand, and black stones in it, so
great as beans.

Betwixt Gotland and the Sweeds schares in the farewaye it is four and thirty,
and six and thirty and eight and thirty fathom deep, and close by Gotland
five and twenty fathom.

When the tower of Houbrough is westnorthwest from you, so far as you may see
it from the poope, there it is thirty and one and thirty fathom deep, but
being northnorthwest from you it is shoaler, five and twenty and six and
twenty fathom.

Betwixt Howbrough and Eastergore lies a banck of four and twenty fathom,
gross redd sand, so far without the land, that you cannot see the land out
of the top. To the eastwards of it lies another banck of fourteen fathom gray
and white sand, when you are over it, you shall have no ground in forty fathom.

Two leagues without the land, by west Eastergore, there it is about one and
thirty fathom soft ground.

He that sayleth from Brontholm along by Oeland toward Eastergore, let him
not spare his lead, but sound often for these aforesaid bancks and grounds;
thereby you may well make some reckoning.

If you should make reckoning to come by night with Gotland on the southeast
side, and have no good sight, then come no nearer the land (about the north end
or south end, also by Eastergore) then in twenty or four and twenty fathom,
and so you can take no hurt by night. By day you may come near enough to it at
many places, in seven, eight or ten fathom.

How these lands do lie one from the other and from other lands.
From Houbrough to Eastergore northeast 12 or 13 leag. From Eastergore to
Faro-sound north and by east 7 leag. From Faro-sound to Gotsche sand

The second part of the New LIGHTNING COLUMN, OR SEA MIRROR. THE FIRST BOOK,
Of the WESTERN NAVIGATION Containing The description of the Seacoasts of
Holland, Zealand, and Flanders, from Tessell to the Heads of Dover and Calice.
The first demonstration. Where in Are delineated the Tessel-streame, and the
Channel of the same.
WHEN you sail from Amsterdam to the Fall of Vrck, you must keep the middle of
the channel, in sailing to Tyoort, and from thence over Pampus, Pampus
with a shipp of great draught, that draws ten foot or more, keep Marken
church without to the land of Udam, called Schyteldoecks-haven, so long until
that the steeple of Zuyderwouw come past Kinnigherbeurt, which are the houses
half way betwixt Schyteldoecks-haven and Durgerdam, go then toward the land
east, until that the New church of Amsterdam come about Durgerdam, keep that
so standing, until that the church of Weesp be come past the House or Castle
at Muyen, so that it do stand somewhat nearer to Muyen then to the House, keep
Weesp standing so, until that Edam come without the east end of Marken. In
this fare way it is a foot deeper, then if you sailed right through.

For to avoyde Muyen sand: men were wont to bring the houses which were wont to
stand upon Tyoort to the southwards of the Heyliger-stee at Amsterdam, thereby
you may make some reckoning, they are good longst marks: when Monnickedam is
about the west end of Schyteldoecks-haven, and the house at Muyen betwixt Weesp
and the church at Muyen, then are you thwart of Muyen sand. For to sail right
through over Pampus, then keep the steeple of Diemen over or about the point
of Tyoort, so long as you can see Tyoort, that is a right longst mark for to
sail over Pampus.

When you are come thwart of the east end of Marken, go then on northeast, or
somewhat more eastwardly toward the Fall of Urck, which is seven leagues: when
you are come with in a great league of Urck, you shall meet with a hard sand,
called the Houtribbe, The houtribbe.
lying southeast and northwest thwart over the Fare way, there is no more
water upon it, then upon the Flat of Wieringen, or of Freesland, you shall
find also no deeper water there then eight through. When Enckhuysen lies
northwest and northwest and by west from you, then you are upon the Hout-ribbe.
Before that you come against the sand, you can by night see the fire upon Urck.
When that Urck or the fire is more northerly then northeast from you, and that
you get shoaling, then that is certainly of the Houtribbe: for so you cannot
come too near the Enckhnyse^ sand. When you come from the southwards, you are
not about the Enckhuyse^ sand before that the church upon Urck come without the
little village of houses, which is then east and by south, and east southeast
from you: if that then you go af^ay n. w. and by w. or w. n. w. you shall
run close along by the side of the sand. With a ship of great draught,
bring the church a good way through the houses, until that it stand e.s.e.
from you, then go bouldly on n. w. and by w. or keep Medenblick without the
point of the Ven, and so you shall not come too near neither to sand nor shoale.
Likewise if you come from the northwards, and bring Urck not more eastwardly
then e.s.e. from you, then you cannot take hurt also of the Enckhuysen sand.
Marks of Enckhuysen sand.
From Urck to the buys upon the Cripple and Hofstede, the course is n. w. and
by w. with that course you may run all along unto the souther buy upon
Wieringhen Flat: in turning to windwards, you may well bring Medenblick a
little within the point of the Ven, but when as Medenblick is without it, then
you are in the right fare way.

Betwixt Urc and the buy upon the Hofstede northeast somewhat eastwardly from
the steeple of Enckhuyse^ lies a little plate of hard sand, lying toward the
end of Enckhuysen sand, which is not deeper then the Frees Flat, about to the
eastwards of it, is the deepest water, but about to the westwards of it (by
some called the Kattegat) you shall be sooner about the High horn, or the
Enckhuysen sand, and it is good for ships that draw but little water.

The thwart marks of the buys, both upon the Cripple and Hofstede; Marks of
the buys upon the hof-stede and Cripple.
are Grootebroeck and Hem (two sharp steeples) right one in the other, and
Warnis, a little sharp steeple in Freesland to the south side of the Cliffe of
Staverne, then you have the length of these buys, which lie each of them in
three fathom, the one on the east shore, and the other on the west shore
upon the tail of the Cripple. There is in the right fare way, two foot less
then five fathom, and soft ground. When the steeple of Medenblick comes to
the northwards of the house of Medenblick, so far as the house is broad, then
you are clear of Cripple sand, and past it; go then on northwest, and
northwest and by north to the buy upon the Creyl, according as the wind and
tide shall be, the right farewaie there, is deep five fathom scarce. Thwart of
the Creyl, The Creyl.
in sailing out, or about the Creyl, in sailing in, that is a little within the
Creyl on the north shore, lies along the reach (toward the buy upon the
Hofstede, a hard sand or plate, called the south Creyl, South-Creyl.
upon which there is no more then twelve foot water, at low water, betwixt that
banck and the north shore, it is three fathom deep, and soft ground, and to
the southwards, or the westwards of it, four fathom and a half. When Mirnes,
a little flat steeple in Freesland, comes over a long countriehouse to the
southwards of the clisse of Staverne, then you come right thwart of that
foresaid plate.

The marks of the buy upon the Creyl, Mark of the Creyl.
are the sharp steeple of Twisch over the Cornemill to the westwards of
Medenblick, and that little flat steeple of Mirnes to the south side or east
side of the cliffe. The right fareway there is four fathom and an half, and
five fathom deep, soft ground, the buy lies in four fathom, if need require,
men may run well a cables length about to the eastwards of it.

From the Buy upon the Crippell, which lies upon the east end off the
Cripple-sand, Marks of the beakon upon Cripp e-sand.
three fathom unto the Beakon upon Cripple-sand, the course is northwest and by
west, and northwest. When Lutkebrooke, a small spire steeple comes to Hem
(which is also a spire steeple) then are you thwart of that beakon. From the
Beakon upon the Crippel, unto the souther buy upon Wieringher flat, the course
is northwest and by west, or westnorthwest, according as the wind and tide
shall serve it lies at high water with an ordinary tide in thirteen foot and
a half, Marks of the fouther buy upon the Flat.
the marks thereof are these: Grootebrooke comes betwixt two Hay-stacks to
the eastwards of the five water-mils which stand to the eastwards of Warvers
hoof, that is a long mark in the s. Twisch a sharp steeple to the westward of
Medenblick, comes over Almerdorp, there was wont to be a little flat
steeple, but it is fallen down, and therefore now not so well to be known,
that was a right thwart-marke. Upon Wieringhen stands a cape, bring East
lander steeple, which is a flat steeple upon Wieringen, right over the cape,
and sail so right with it, and you shall come right with the buy. When you are
at the buy, Westlander Church comes then over Cleverstee, and the eight mils
to the eastwards of Medenblick, a little without the Town. For to find the
deepest of the flat coming from the Cripple, you must be careful to look
out for the foresaid marks. If that Twisch come first to Almerdorp, before
Cleverstee come to Westlander Church, then you are to near to Breesand, or the
grounds on the starboard side, these are sure marks for to sail over the
flats, when there lie no buys. Along to the eastwards of the buy is the
deepest water. If you will anchor before the Wieringer flat, then come no
nearer the Flat then when Twisch comes a little to the Northwards of
Opperdoes, or half way betwixt Opperdoes and Almerdorp.

For to sail from the foresaid souther buy over the Gammels to Medenblick, For
to fail over the Gammels to Medenblick.
you must bring the westermost water-mill of the eight (which stand to the
eastwards of Medenblick) a capstone bars length without or to the eastwards
of the Bulwark of the Town, and sail then boldly without fear right in with
them, until that you come into the road where the ships commonly lie, or else,
if you desire to go into the Haven, then sail in right to the northerhead,
there is nothing that can hurt you, But if you must turn to windwards over the
Gammels, and that your ship draws more then eleven foot water, then run not
Further over to the westwards, then that the foresaid Water-mill comes almost
within, or a handspikes length to the foresaid Bulwark, so that yet you may
well see through betwixt them, then cast about, and run over to the eastwards,
so long until Grootebrooke come in the five water-milles, which stand to the
eastwards of Warmershoof, or on to the eastwards of them, so you shall not do
amiss, for it is there broad and wide.

If you desire to sail over the Gammels to Medenblick, when you come from the
Fly, then bring the steeple of Opperdoes over the westermost Water-mill of
five, which stand to the westwards of Medenblick, and run in so right with
them, until that the westermost water-mill often eight (to the eastwards of
Medenblick) come to stand a capstone bars length without the Bulwark, as here
before once already has been said. Having these marks thus, and that it do
become dark, then go on south and south and by east, according as the wind
and tide shall serve, and you shall not do amiss, neither shall you miss the
Town. In this foresaid fair way, there is no less depth then upon the
Wieringher flat, and all soft ground.

When the steeple of Twisch is over the westermost watermill except one of the
five which stand to the westwards of Medenblick, and Grootebroeck, in the
little village, to thee. wards of the five water-mils on the Easterdyke; then
are you in 13 foot from the northwest point of the Crippl, and past the tail
of the Cripple. Upon these foresaid marks, and 13 foot, lies a buy with
three legs, and on the foresaid west shore lie three drift-beakons in 12
foot, and then comes the wester-most water-mill (of the eight which stand to
the eastwards of Medenblick) and so you shall not have less water then upon
the Wieringer flat.

From the Souther-buye to the second or middle buy, For to sail over the
Wieringen flat.
the course is northwest and northwest and by north: but for to find the
deepest water, go first northwest so long until that Ypels-hoofs Church come
over the water-mill, which is called the Bolmill, and then forth n. w. and by
n. When the Cornmill upon Wieringen comes in the swamp off the Oever, then
you have the length of the second Buy, which lies upon the west, or the south
end of a little plate, called the Repel, the fair way is along to the
westwards of it, there being at low water two fathom large, and at high water
scarce three fathom deep. On the west side of the fair way, betwixt the
souther-buye, and the middle-buye, nearest the middle-buy, lies a hard sand
called the Sow, or the old Sow, which on the east side is very steep and
needle to which (in sailing up) men might sail within a point or tail of it:
to the westwards of it shoots off another tail to the northwards, a great
ways toward the Northeast buy. Upon the outermost, or northermost point,
called Seughoort, stands always a beakon. Upon Wieringer upon the Oever
stand two little capes with barrels on them, the one upon the North-end off the
Oever, and the other upon the head, they are so little, that you can hardly see
them: when you come off from the souther-buye toward the middle-buye, then
keep them not one in the other, for if you keep them one in the other, then
you will be very close by the south shore, and shall but even run clear of
the old Sow, but keep the southermost a little to the westwards of the
northermost, and then you shall run along the right fareway, and shall not
take any hurt of the old Sow. When you come near the middle-buy, you must
leave these marks and use them then no longer.

From the middle buy unto the Norther-buye, the course is northnorthwest, when
you come thwart off the norther-buye, then comes Oostlander Church and the
Cornmill both over a little Chapel covered with red tiles, that stand upon
the Oever, thwart off it also stands the foresaid beakon upon Seughoort. By
the Norther-buye it is scarce three fathom deep at high water, the fareway is
along to the westwards off it. When you come by the norther-buye, keep still
the foresaid Northnorthwest course, until that Oostlander Church come to the
northwards of the Sedge-dyke of the Oever, and then you are past the little
plate which lies by the Northerbuye.

When as that Oostlander Church comes from the Sedge-dyke, go then north,
and north and by cast on, to the Nesse. In that Fareway it is broad and wide
the west shore all along unto the Nesse, is very flat, there you cannot take
any hurt, but may boldly run along Cust van Hollant tusschen de Maes end

by it, although it were a lee shore, but the east shore is steep,
especially somewhat farther out toward Iaepvaer, when the great Cape from
Wieringhen stands a great ships length to the eastwarde off the houses upon
the Oever, then you are well to way, and right in the Farewaye, betwixt the
norther-buye and the Nesse. The nesse
When Ypelshoof and Stru are one in the other, there is the road, where men
do lade and unlade, you may anchor there-abouts in the midst of the fareway
in four fathom, the nearer the east shore the deeper. Iaep-vaer is a tail of
sand or plate fast to the shore, which you might sail within where you sail
off, but specially in sailing apwards in 6 or 7 fathom, upon it lies a black
bay. Upon the point of the Nesse over against Iaep-vaer Iaep-vaer
lies a white buy, these lie both in three fathom or three fathom and a
half. In the winter, when the buys are taken away, then in place often white
buy there is set a beakon upon te Nesse. From the Nesse to Vogelsand, the
course is most northwest, therefore when you have gotten the length of the buy
or the beakon upon the Nesse, go then more westerly, northnorthwest, and
northwest, and by north and northwest, unto the Beakon upon Vogel-sand; the
west shore you may sound in six and seven fathom. The marks of this reach are
these, the Mill of Ooster-end: (which is a little village upon the cast end of
Texel) and the Cape which stands upon the dycke; one in the other, then are
you amiddest the Channel in the deep, that is, ten, eleven, and twelve
fathom: when the mill stands somewhat to the southwards, or to the westwards
of the Cape, then are you, by south shore, which is very steep, which (in
turning to windwards) you may not come nearer then in eight or nine fathom but
being past Vogel-sand, Voghel-^^nd.
it grows shoaler, and the east shore very steep. As soon as you find that
it begins to shoale, you must east about, else you should presently be on
against the east shore.

From the beacon upon Vogell-sand, the course is west northwest unto the buy
upon Burg-sand, ^^rgsand
which lies upon the tail of the Share, the marks of it are: the Eyerland
even unto the east point of the Island Tessell, and the Church of the Horn upon
Tessell too Zuyd-haffell, which is a few houses to the northwards of the
Schonce. Or else when you come about Vogel-sand, then keep the foresaid cape
and mill one in the other, until that the foresaid Horn come to, or through
Zuyd-haffell, and then run on, keeping them so: When that Eyerland comes
even to the east point of Tessel, then you have the length of the buy upon the
Burg-sand, you may bring the Horn well somewhat to the northwards of Zuyd
haffell, but in no wise to the southwards of it, for else you should sail on
against the south shore. For to sail from thence to Copevaerders Cope^rders
^^ade.
road, you must keep the Horn to Zuyd-haffell, and sail forth keeping them
so, until you come against Tessell in the road, and anchor there where you
think good. Before Ooster-end it is best for small ships, there it is shoald
water, and there goes little tide, but most ships do anchor before the Geest.

Upon the point of the Bosse The Bosse
lies a white buy in three fathom on the west point of the Balgh, which you
must leave on the starboard side, and run about to the eastwards of it into the
Balgh; and then forth along by the beacons to Wieringhen, you must leave all
the beacons alsoo on the starboard side.

For to sail up from the Helder toward the Wieringeflat, you must go
northeast, or somewhat more easterly, according as the wind and tide shall be,
or else in eight or nine fathom along by the Tessell, until that the Hoorn
come to the northwards of Zuydhaffel, but take heed of the Wieringhen side,
which is so steep there, that you may have twelve or thirteen fathom at one
cast, and should be a ground before you should be able to heave the lead again.

When that the Hoorne comes then to Northwards of Zuyd-haffell, then keep
them so standing, and sail up so to the Vogel-sand, when that the Eyrland
comes even without the east point of Tessell, the^ you have the length of the
buy upon Burghsand, whieh lies on the south shore, upon a tail of sand, which
men may sail within at five or six fathom. From that Buy upon Burghsand, it
is e.s.e. to the Beakon upon Vogel-sand, but sail upon the foresaid marks of
the Hoorn and Zuyd-haffell so long until that you have the Cape upon Tessell,
and the mill of Ooster-end one in the other, then keep the one in the other
leaving the first marks, and sail up so unto the buy or Beakon upon the Nesse,
and so you shall run amidst the channel in the fareway which is 10. 11. and 12
fathom deep. If you bring the mill a little to the Westwards of the Cape then
you shall be close by the south shore, which is so steep, that you may not
come near it, in turning to windwards, then in eight or nine fathom. Being
come about the nesse, then go on south and south and by west, toward ^he buy

TEssell is a long plain Island, whereupon stand 4. Churches, the westermost
has a high sharp steeple, and is called west end, or S. John's, but by the
Pilots it is called the Westen, or the Wambus. To the southwards of that
stands an other sharp steeple, called the Hoorn. The third is called the
Burgh, which stands somewhat more to the northwards then the other two
beforesayd. The fourth is called the Oogh, or the Koogh, which is the
norther-most of them all, without steeple, and is covered with blew slates.

The Eyerland ^^erland
lies close to the east wards, or to the n. ward of the Tessel, and fast to
it, when it flows somewhat high, it is divided of from the Tessel by the sea,
and made to an Island: it shows it self of at sea like a Low Plain little
Island with little hommocks, there stands upon it no more then 2 little houses.

Huysdown Huysdown.
is a short point of land with some white sandhils, where of the greatest and
highest is called the Kyckdowne, or Kykers-downe, the next to the southwards of
it, is called Dirckooms sand-hil, further to the southwards they run flat of by
little and little; and at length to nothing in a flat plain strand. Upon the
east end, called the Helder, lie also some sandy hills, betwixt the Helder and
the Kyck down it is a most-flat strand, with some sandy hills like a dike upon
which (about half way betwixt both) stands the little or the outer most Cape,
the great cape stands somewhat within the land, about east from the Kyckdown.

Huysdowne, or the Marsdeep and the Maes lie south s. w. somewhat southerly,
and northnortheast somewhat northerly about 24 leagues asunder. From Huysdown to
Petten Petten.
the coast lies south and by west four leagues. Petten has a little Church
with a little steeple, and thereabouts you shall see two other little sharp
steeples in the Northland. A little to the southwards of Petten lies the
Hondbosch, a league to the southwards of Petten lies Camperdowne the best land
to be known thereabouts, the north end is a high steep white sand-hill, which
goes sloping down: the southermost part is gray and rough, being grown over
with head, or spyrie grass, to the southwards of it lie many rough hommockes
or sand hills, where sometimes you shall see amongst them a white spot, so that
it is very good to be known. From Petten to Egmont upon the sea, it is three
leagues. Egmont upon the sea Egmont upon the Sea.
is also very good to be known, for it has a thick flat steeple, which
stands like a sail in the sand-hill, and a little to the southwards of it
you may see Egmont-within, which has two high steeples upon the Abbey close
one to the other, whereof the one is sharp, and the other (to wit, the
northermost) is flat, because the spire is lately fallen down. A little to the
northwards of the Abbey stands another steeple of the church upon the old
walls, but it is not so high as that upon the Abbey: so that upon all the coast
of Holland, there is no place so good to be known as this. From Egmont upon the
sea, to Wyck upon the sea, Wyck upon the Sea.
are 3 leagues that is alsoo a flat steeple: when you are thwart of Wyck upon
the sea, you may see Beverwyck a little to the northwards of it, which is a
high thick, and sharp steeple; besides that, you may see alsoo betwixt Egmont
and Wyck upon the Sea Castricom, and more other sharp steeples. From Wyck upon
the sea to Santfort, it is three leagues, Sandfort Sandfort.
has a sharp steeple, with a high fire-beakon, a little to the southwards of
it, in the black sand-hill which shows it self alsoo like a steeple.

To the northwards of Sandfort lies a high white sandhil, along over which
you may see Haerl:, a high square cross Church, which has a high sharp
steeple upon the midst of the Church, and alsoo to the northwards of it, a high
small steeple, called Baecknesser steeple) thwart of it has the coast of
Holland a great Bay. From Sandfort to Northwyck Noortwyck.
upon the sea, are 3 leagues, that is a flat steeple, whereby stands a
fire-beakon. To the northwards of Northwyck upon the sea, you may see Northwyck
within, a flat steeple, whereupon stands a little cap not very high, and upon
the midst of the Church stands a little small tower. From Northwyck to
Catwyck Catwyck
upon the sea, it is a great league, being also a flat steeple, which in times
past has had a spire: to the southwards of it stands a high fire-beakon,
seeming like a steeple: you may alsoo see thereabouts within the land (when you
are not very far from the shore) Catwyck upon the Rhyne, and Reyns-burgh,
and Valckenburgh, all sharp steeples. From Catwyck to Schevelingen Schevelingh.
are 3 leagues, the Quire of Scheveling Church is somewhat higher then the
Church it self: in manner as the Hagues The Hague.
Church: a little to the southwards of that Church stands alsoo a fire
beakon. About half a league within the land, you may see the Church of the
Hague, which is very good to be known, the Quire is higher then the body of the
Church. The Hagues steeple you may see far above any other part of the land.
From Scheveling to the Heyde The Heyde.
it is 2 leagues, and from thence forth to Gravesand, or to the north side of
the Mase, one league. The Heyde is a village without a steeple: but a little
within the sand-hill, stands a flat steeple called Monster. Gravesand

is a high sharp steeple, very good to be known, which stands on the north
side of the Mase. The Brill The Brill.
is a great flat steeple on the south side of the Maes. All this coast of
Holland; frow Huysdown to the Maes, it altogether a clean strand, which me^ may
come so near to as they will, into 4 or 5 fathom,

For to sail from the Copevaerders road out at the Tessel you must go first
southwest or somewhat westerly to the Helder, For to fall out at Tessel.
or run along by the Tessell side in 9 or 10 fathom, until you come near
the Helder, and then go out west close along by the shore of the Helder, and
by little and little somewhat more northerly, until that the capes upon
Huysdown be one in the other, or that the greatest come through the smallest,
to wit, to the westwards of it, and then go out n.n.w. or more northerly or
westerly, according as the wind or tide shall be, until you come against the
northshoare, in 5 or 6 fathom, and run boldly out along by it, until you be
clear out at sea.

When the tower of Wester-end (which men do name the westren, or the Wambus)
comes to be e.n.e from you, or a little more easterly, then you have the
length of Cape and steeples buy, that is, the innermost buy of the Spaniards
channel, which you shall epsy on the larboard side. To the northward of it
lie three other buys, all along the east side of the Keysers-plate, near
upon one course, (to wit, n.n.w. or a little more northerly) which you must
leave (in sailing out) all on the larboard side. The outermost buy lies from
the fourth, north somewhat easterly upon the point of the Keysers-plate, in 22
foot at low water, you may run along to the westward: of it, but not far, for
the Keysers-plate is on the east side unto the outermost end very steep, but
the east shore of the deep is flat, when you come thwart of the foresaid
outermost buy, then lies the Kooger Church right. e.n.e. from you, and the
Capes upon Huysdown are one in the other.

For to find the Spanniards Channel For to sail in at the Spanniards Gh^nuel^
coming from the northwards, you must bring the Capes upon Huysdown one in the
other, or a little through one another, to wit, the runner that is the
southermost and greatest, a little to the eastwards of the other, then they
shall stand s.s.e. from you sail then right in with them, keeping them so, and
you shall sail right upon the outermost buy, or in sight of it, which lies
(as is said) upon the point of the Keysers-plate in 22 foot at low water; when
you come to the buy, the Kooger Church shall lie full east north east from you.
Therefore if you come from the westwards or the southwards then bring that
Church not more northerly then eastnortheast but rather a little more easterly
from you, and sail then right in with it, until that the Capes come one right
against another, or else you should lightly sail upon the Keysers-plate, which
is without upon the north-side very steep. Men may run a little west wards
of the outermost buy, Along to the eastwards of it is it broader.

From the first or the outermost buy, to the second, the course is south,
somewhat westerly, and from thence to the third, fourth, and fifth, which is
the buy of the Cape and steeple, it is al most one course, south south east, or
somewhat southerly, the buys lie along the west shore, men may for need sail
along to the westwards of them, but not far, for the west shore is so
steep, that if a great ship should lie with the stem against it, there
should be at head no more then 3 foot, and by the main mast at least 3 fathom
deep, but the east shore is flat, men may run along by it upon their
lead, until they come within the buys. The buy upon the tail, that is the
innermost buy of the old slenck, lies from the buy upon Cape and steeple,
south and by west, and s.s. west, but the Helder southeast, men may sail from
the buy upon Cape and steeple, rightwith the Helder, without danger, or to the
buy upon the tail, and from thence along by the south shore, which is also
very steep, or right to the Helder, according as shall be best convenient for
the wind and tide. The foreftood falls very strong over the south ground to
the Spaniards channel, till half flood, and the fore-ebbe s.s.e. till half
ebb. The faling of the tide.
The Helder lies from the buy upon the tail, e.s.e. and s.e. and by e. When
you are come near the Helder, run close by it, so to avoid a tail shooting off
from Geest sand, which you may sail within as you come from the sea, there
lies a Buy upon it, which leave on the Larboard side. Being past the Helder,
go northeast; or a little more easterly, or along the Tessels side in eight
or nine fathom, unto the Copevaerders road. The Wieringhen side is steep.

The Slenck.
In The Slenck used to lie six buys, but the sands are grown now so high and
have stopped the passage.

Within the sixth Buy it is wide enough to sail in from thence right to the
Helder east southeast.

To sail out at the Land-deepe, The Land deep.
run along within a bow-shot of the foot strand of Huysdown, and about by the
heads, and you shall not miss the innermost Buy, lying on the shoals, nearest
the west shore in seventeen foot at high, and 13 foot at low water, that
shoaly place is not above 2 ships lengths broad, over it, and alsoo within it,
it is deep enough. Thwart of that Buy shoots off a little tail from the
shore toward the Buy, therefore run close along by the Buy, and leave it on
your starboard side in sailing out. Besides that Buy, there lie 3 other Buys
in the Land-deep, which you must leave all lying to seawards of you, and so run
betwixt them and the shore, when you are past the 4 Buy, you are past all the
shoale, and may sail where you will.

To find the Land-deep coming from the sea southwards, you must sound the
shore in four fathom and a half, and running so by the shore, you shall sail
right with the outermost buy; which dove, come no near the shore else you
should sail within the tail of Arrian Bergers Creek, which shoots off from
the shore, to the south sandhill. Or else if you come from sea with an open
wind, the^ keep the great Cape upon Huysdowne over Dirckooms sandhil, (that
is, a round sandhil a little to the south of Kyck down bur not so high) and
sail so in right with it, you shall then meet with the outermost buy, which
lies at low Water in 4 fathom and a half nearest the Wester-grounds, or the
hakes, leave it on the larboard side, and run in along to the eastwards of
it, betwixt it and the shore, it lies most northeast, and northeast and by
north in, you can take no hurt on either side, if you take heed to keep you
from the shore. Thwart of the Kyckdowne, or coming to the southwards of it,
you must edge a little from the shore, to avoid a shoale which lies near
somewhat off from the shore. When you come to the second buy, then comes the
mill to the Northwards of Kyckdowne, and at the third, the mill and Cane Nels
house come one in the other; which two buys lie in 5 fathom at low water. From
the third to the innermost buy, it is n.e. and by e, run close along to the
east ward of it, to avoid the foresaid little tail of sand, which (thwart of
it) lies off from the shore, and then forth within a bow shot about the
heads, and so along by the strand of the Helder.

Conrerning the Mase, and Goerees Gat.
The Mase is at present but a wide or broad flatt having little change of
depth, which may be sailed with all winds.

When the wind is south, regard the old marks, that is (coming from sea)
before you see the Capes, bring the steeple of Brill which is a stumpy steeple
e.s.e. south from you, To sail in to the Mase with a south wind.
or a little e. or southerly after you have gotten the cape, bring them
together, and run on, or if you bring the Brill steeple a spades length
northwards the tower of Oostvoorn, and run on, you shall then first run the buy
in sight lying in 3 fathom at low water.

From this first buy to the 2 and 3 buy, we sail right upon the Capes. The
second buy lies on 13 and the third upon 11 foot, being there come, the
steeple of Goer: comes a little upon the foot strand of the land of the Brill*
the fourth buy lies much alike with the third right upon the Capes, though a
little more southerly between these buys the shallowest of the Maes is about
ten foot, by the fourth buy it begins to deepe^, with a common low water, it
is about eleave^ foot deep, but with a southerly or s. e. wind it runs
shallower. From thence to the fourth buy it is broad, so that there we may
sail in a reasonable depth. Below the Heydyck or inmost beacon it is much
narrower. The fifth buy lies distant from the fourth e. n. e, and n.e. and by
e. From the fourth buy to the fifth southward along the buys in the right
channel it is deep 14. 15. 16. and 17 foot, and near the fifth buy five
fathom. The sixth buy lies from the fifth e. and by N. in twelve foot, there
along the southward it is 5 and 6 fathom deep, and is called the Pit.
Coming then a little beyond the sixth buy, so comes Maeslandt sluice and
Vlaerding steeple together, keep them so and run forwards so long till you
bring the old head of the Brielin the new head then you may run to the land of
the Briel and so further along the southwall till you come before the Briel
where you may anchor. Now who will run higher up the Mase, let them run all
along the soutwall till he is past the New sluice choose then the Northwall.
From the east end of Roosenburgh there comes a tail off; which you may
undersayle coming westwards. If then (when you are past the heads of
Swartewal) you bring not the Briel steeple without or northward these heads but
keep to the southward, you can not then undersayle it but must run far about
southwards. Full eastward of Heenvliet runs the old Maes in; the Flood falls
there verry hard on, you must take heed that you be not deceived with the
Terwesand, that is a great flatt sand, lying foremost in the midst of the old
Mase, The old Mase.
and that lies a great deal dry at low water, and stretches with a long
small point westwards into the Maes. To shun this, take notice of a bush of
trees; standing on the southwall, a little eastward the old Maes, keep the
steeple of Rotterdam northward that bush, so shall you not sail over that
Tarwesand but if you let the steeple come southward the bush, you shall surely
strike upon the foresaid tail. Northward of the Tarwesand Tarwesand.
is it deep upon whith you may sail in the old Maes even to Dort, therein lie
alsoo two buys, he who will run upon the foresaid Marks of the Roterdams
steeple and the bushof trees so long till the steeple of the Briell comes
together with a tilehouse which stands upon the southside of the east end of
Roosenburgh, and keep that so standinge, so shall he not miss of the buy.
Being past the old Maes we sail in the midst of the water beyond Vlaerding
till we come to the five sluices from thence ye must choose the southwall, and
run along near unto it, till you come over a small sand or bancke, where with
low water there is 11 or 11 and a half foot water how nearer you keep to the
southwall so much the deeper it is, stretching cross the Maes, as soon as you
are past that so keep straight to the Schiedams head, there have you the
deepest water.

Will you sail to Delfs-haven Delfs-Haven.
(being past Schiedam) keep the side of the northwall, and run along thereby
till you come before the haven and anchor there. But if you will go for
Roterdam, run along the Northwall, so long till Ouwerschie and the house of
Spanjen, come together, strike then over, or a little sooner to the southwall,
and along thereby, or bring the steeple of Vlaerding, when you are past the
head of Schiedam over the third house upon the Schiedams head, keep that so
standing, so long till the Mill and the head of Charlois (upon which stands a
little bush of trees) come together, you shall leave a little dry plate lying
half way between Schiedam and Delfs-haven on your larbord and so run
southward of the dry platt under the Haven. Upon this platt lies no more the^
seave^ and upon the bancke near the haven 2 or 3 foot water, and are both
verry steep. Now when the foresaid Mill and Charlois head come together; so
keep them standing till you come near the new head of Roterd; sail the^ to
the City, and there along close in between the City and Platt, there may you
cast anchor.

How you sail the Maes in with a northerly wind.
But if you will sail the Mase in with a Northerly wind you must keep, the
upperwall that so you may have the smoothest deepest water, for by the
Northwall there goes in a depth where a full foot of water and more is the^ by
the buys above written and is called Everskil. To reach this, you must bring
the outermost beacons in the Brill and keep it so standing, till we bring two
bushes of trees on the North side east of it, that is about a goteling shot
northwards the uttermost Buy, bringing the most northerly bush in with the
Delfs steeple so are you then on the northside of Everschil, and the southerly
bush to the Lier then are you on the south side of Everskill, then keep so
long between both till you bring the steeple of the Brill between both the
Beacons (then are you right over against the Hompel) then run again to the
land of the Briel either to the pit or the abovementioned Southergat.

The Goerees-gat.
Betwixt the land of the Brill and Goeree, go in alsoo two channells, the
northermost is called the Quacks-deep, and is not for great ships, but only
for smackes, and small ships: the other is the Goerees-gat. Betwixt these two
channells lies a great plate, called the Hinder, which at low water is not
deeper then five, six, and seven foot. To the northwards of it goes in the
Quacks-deepe, and to the southwards of it the Goerees-gat.

For to find the Quacks-deepe Quacks-deep.
coming in out of the west, you must keep the steeple of the Brill east from
you, and run so in, until that a great country house, (which you shall see
stand alone a little within the point of the Quacke) come to the southermost
sand-hills of the land of the Brill, which shall then stand near about south
east from you, keep that then so standing, and run so right in, until that
Oost-voorn come to the westermost or southermost sand-hills, then run in
along by the strand somewhat more southerly, until that Goeree com to the
eastwards or within the sand-hills, and the^ you shall be past the east point
of the Hinder, which the Pilots call the Buyen, run then toward Goeree, or
to the eastwards, to Hellevoet-sluce, where you desire to be.

For to sail in at the Goerees-gat, Goerees-gat.
you must bring the steeple of Goeree, and the Cape upon the land of Goeree,
one in the other, and then they shall stand east and by south, and
eastsoutheast from you: or if you can not see the cape, then bring the steeples
east and by south, or eastsoutheast from you, according as you shall have the
wind, sail in right with it, until you come hard aboard the strand, and
within a bawles cast in along by it, east and by north, and east in, so long
until that the land do fall away more to the south-wards: thereabouts runs
of from the shore a little tail which men might sail within, in going out,
but not in coming in, there you must edge a little further off from the
shore, being past that, luffe up again toward the shore, or haven of
Goeree, and anchor there before it, or else if you will run up to
Hellevoet-sluce, then bring the mill which stands to the westwards of Goeree,
a little to the northwards of the steeple of Goeree, keep then so standing, and
sail so up to Hellevoet-sluce, and you shall not come near the plate which
lies over against or to the southwards of Hellevoet-sluce.

When you sail in at the Goerees-gat with a bare southerly wind, and that you
can not bring the cape and steeple one in the other, you may bring the steeple
well e. s. east, or a great capstane bars length to the northwards of the cape,
and then run over until you come against the strand, and so you shall run
over the tail of the Hinder in 14 and 15 foot at low water, but when the cape
and steeple are one in the other, you shall not have less then 19 or 20 foot.
Being come over the tail of the Hinder, in the right deep, it is 6, 7, and 8
fathom deep, the nearer the strand the deeper water. A little within the cape,
or almost thwart of it, is the narrowest of the channel further in it is
wider, on hen. side toward the Hinder, it is rising ground, but the south
shore along by the strand is very steep.

Of the tides and courses of the streams, about these foresaid places.
UPon the Wieringer-flat makes full sea a southeast or northwest Moon.

Before Tessel, in Coopvaerders road, an eastsoutheast, and westnorthwest Moon.

Without the grounds or shoals of the Tessell, an east and west Moon makes
the highest water, and in the entering of the Tessel, an east and by south, and
west and by north Moon: but the flood goes a good while longer in. And
likewise runs the ebb also longer out, then the lowest water. When the Moon
is south, or somewhat more westerly, it begins apparently to flow without on
the strand, and likewise upon the shoals.

The fore-flood, and the after-ebbe out of the Tessel, fall both one with the
other n.n. e. thwart over the grounds and channels, and right out at the
Spanjards channel, until half flood: etc to the contrary, the fore-ebbe,
with the after-flood fall right in at the Spanjards channel s. s. east over
the south grounds, and thwart over the Slenk and the other channels, until
half ebb. A little while before half flood, the flood begins to run right
in at the channel, and again a little before half ebb, the ebb begins to
fet right out at the channel. Therefore he that will sail into the channels,
must reckon his tides very well, wherein consists very much. Without before
the channel in the sea, the tide turns about with the Sun, so that when a
ship does lie at an anchor without the channels, and has neither good nor
hurt of the waves of the sea, it should have but a little still water.

In the North Sea the tide falls round, more then half tide, upon the Broad
fourteen, it turns about with the Sun or the Moon, and falls but a
quarter tide right along the sea. Nearer the coast of Holland and Zealand,
the tide falls (whether it be flood or ebb) somewhat sloping toward the
land, but in the midst of the tide, it falls right along the sea, and in
the last of the tide, it sets to seawards, toward the westwards or the
northwards.

Betwixt the Marsdeepe and the Maes in the fareway, the fore-floot comes out
of the north sea, and turns about with the Moon, falling toward the land
northeast, and n. east and by north.

The Fishermen of the Maes say, that when they are out of sight of the land,
they can perceive in calm weather by the turning about of the tide, they be to
the northwards or to the southwards of the Maes. Somewhat to the southwards of
the Maes, the after-flood turns about against the Sun, but to the
northwards of the Maes, is turns about with the Sun, until the last
quarter, and then it sets toward the shore, or the coast next unto it. They
say also, that along the coast of Holland, men have no help of the ebb in
turning to windwards toward the Maes, except they be without sight of the
land, because there go no ebbes by the land when the wind is to the southwards
of the west.

Before the Maes a s. w. and by west, and a n.e. and by east moon makes a
high water.

Before the Brill a s. w. and s. w. and by south, and northeast, and n. e. and
by n. Moon.

Before the old Maes a s. w. and n. e. Moon.

Before Rotterd. a s.w. and by west. and n.e. and by e. moon.

Before Dordrecht a westsouthwest Moon.

In the Goerees-gat, and before Goeree, a s.w. and by south, and s. s. w. Moon.

Before Hellevoet-sluce a s. w. and by south Moon.

Betwixt the Marsdeep and the Maes in the fareway, the foreflood comes out of
the north sea, and turns about by little and little n. e. and n. e. and by
north toward the land.

In the sea thwart of the places, (without sight of land) is a point, or a
point and a half later full sea, the further from the land the later.

Not very long after that the flood begins to go without the Maes, it does
begin also to go into the Maes, but the after-flood falls strong in, and so
likewise in the Goerees-gat. Close before the channels by the land, the tide
turns about with the Sun, so that when the after-flood falls into the
channels, it turns to the southwards, and becomes against a running ebb:
the after-ebbe falls again thwart off to seawards out of the channels.

Of the depths and grounds about these places.
Five or six leagues without the Tessell, lies the Broad fourteens, lying
from thence n. east with a small tail which lies about north from the
Tessell, and n. w. from the Fly, to the southwards it runs with the east
side against Catwyck or Scheveling, but the west side lies off at least 11 or
12 leagues thwart off to seawards from Nortwyck and Catwyck, it is a banck most
of fourteen fathom deep in some places somewhat more or less. Betwixt it and
the land it is again 18. and 19. and to the northwardes 20. fathom deep. When
you come over it about the Tessel or the Fly, and come again in 16 or 17
fathom toward the land, then you shall begin to see the land.

There runs of to the southwards into the sea from the coast of Halland 3
small Banckes or ribs, which are somewhat broad and shoale by the land, and
run off sharp and deep to the end, the first the fishermen call the
Smal-eight, and begins a little to the southwards of Egmont upon the sea: the
second the Wtterrib thwart of Wyck upon the sea: the third and southermost the
Hard, a little to the northwards of Santfoort.

The high steeples of Holland and West-Friesland, as Egmont-within, Wyck upon
the sea, Santfoort and other more, men may see before they can see the
sand-hils five leagues without the land, in 14 or 15 fathom, that is, upon the
south end of the Broad-sourteenes, but Camperdownes, and the sand-hills thwart
of Haerlem, they may see before they can see some of the steeples. The steeples
along the coast are most of them flat, except the Beverwyck, Schevelingen and
Santfoort.

Before the Maes and Goeree men may see the land in 14. and 15. fathom.

The third Demonstration. Which unfoldeth All the Chanells betwixt the Maes and
the Whielings, as that of Goeree, Brewers-have, Zirick-zea, the Veer and the
Whieling.
COncerning the Situation between the Maes and Goerees-gat we have handled
sufficiently in the description of the River Maes. Betwixt the land of Goeree
and Schowen there go in alsoo two channels, the norther most is called the
Kevitsen, (which is only for small ships) the southermost for great ships is
called the Brewers havens channel, Betwixt them lies a great dry sand, called
the Springer, which flows not under, but with very high floods.

For to find the Kevitsen, Kevitsen.
you must bring the steeple of Zierick-zee southeast and by south, or a little
more southerly from you, and then you shall espy upon the land of Schowen,
about the steeple of Zierickzee, a wood of trees, bring that and the foresaid
steeple of Zierickzee one in the other, and run so right in until you come
against the sand, so shoaler so near as you can, and then you run far
enough along to the westwards of the west head. When you come within the west
head, against the sand on the south side, then go in east along by the
foresaid dry sand the Springer, at the end of the aforesaid dry sand shoots
off also a point under water, the which you must sound for: being past that,
run then directly with Brewers-Haven, as is showed in the Card. In this
channel it is upon the shoalest ten foor deep.

The Brewers-Haven.
Before the land of Schowen, thwart of the Brewers haven channel, lie three
banks, the outermost, called the Breebanke, lies a kenning without the land,
upon which it is 7. fathom deep, and again within it, 19. fathom deep, upon
the second nearer the shore, it is five fathom deep, and again within it 7.
fathom deep; the third Called the Ooster, lies close by the Land, and runs
into the eastwards, betwixt Schouwen and the land of Goeree, upon it is no more
then six foot water, when you will sail into the channel of Brewers-Haven,
you must go about to the Westwards of it.

Upon the west end of Schouwen stand two Capes, bring them one in the other,
and run so right in with them, until the steeple of the Renisse (which
steeple is somewhat sharp) come to the Blenck or Wolsack, that is, a high
white sandhill, Renisse Wostack.
(which shows it self out in whiteness high above all the other Sand-hills)
then leave the Capes, and run in by the marks of the Blencke De Cust van
ZEELANDT, Begrypende in sich de gaten als vande Wielingen. ter Veere Ziericzee.
Brouwers haven. Goeree. en de Maes
and Renisse, until that Outdorp, (a little white steeple upon the Land of
Goeree) come to the steeple of Goeree, and so you shall go in betwixt the
Ooster of the larboard side, and the Hill on the starboard side, and along a
little to the southwards of the outermost buy, until you come within the
Ooster. When that Outdorp and Goeree are one in the other, then leave also the
foresaid marks of Renisse, and run in right with Goeree, until that you
come by the second buy; or (if there lie no buys) until that the Bommenee
come a little without the Oxetayle, that is a point of Schowe, lying out a
little to the westwards of Brewers-haven, sail so right in until you are
past the Brewers-Haven. This Channel of Brewers-Haven, is a broad and deep
Channel, very convenient for great ships, he that must turn in or out to
windewards, may run along a good ways on both sides, as well of the
outermost as of the second-buy, but to the southwards of them it is deepest,
and the common fareway. The third buy is a buy with a tail, and lies upon a
point of a tail, which off from the Ooster, which you may not go to the
northwards of, until it were very close along by it: all along by the
strand of Schowen, it is deep and steep, you may run close by it from the
outermost buy unto Brewers-Haven, there is nothing that can hurt you, the
shoalest of this Channel is eighteen or nineteen foot; at least a league
without the land in the coming in betwixt the Ooster and the Hill. Further
inwards it is four, five, six, and seven, and at some places ten and eleven
fathom; as it is showed in the Card by the numbers of Feet, and all at low
water.

The Keel, the Newdeep, the Velt, and the Roompot.
You may run into Zierick-zee through diverse channels, through the Keel, the
Newdeep, the Velt, and the Roompot. For to sail through the Keele, then run in
as is before said of the channel of Brewers-haven, first in by the marks of the
Blench and Renisse, so long until that ter Veer come to the westermost point
of Schowen, called the Hoot, keep them one in the other, or to the other, and
run so in until you come by the strand, and then forth by it, and you shall
find so in the Keel at the shoalest, 18 and 19 Foot, and coming against the
point of the Hoot, four and five fathom. Betwixt the Hoot and the New-sand
(which falls at the east end in some places dry (run all along by the land
of Schowen, until you come thwart of the southermost cape of Schowen, edge
then somewhat off from the shore toward the Baniard, for to avoid a Share
which lies off from Schowen, which you might sail within when you come out of
the sea. There lies a buy upon the point, whereby it is easy to be known: being
past that, run all along by the shore, until you come to Zierickzee:
somewhat within the buy, upon the point of the share, there is lately laid
another little buy for those that will sail that ways out, for that they may
not sail upon the east side of the foresaid share.

The Newdeep
For to sail in at the New-deepe, you must look out for two stone
fire-beakons, standing a little to the southwards of the foresaid Capes of the
Channel of Brewers-Haven, bring the innermost a handspikes length to the
southwards of the outermost, and run then right in with them, and then you
shall run in betwixt the Hill and the New-Sand in sixteen, seventeene, and
19 foot, go in along by the foresaid marks, until that you come by the
strand, and then you come into the Keele. If you bring the firebeakons one in
the other, and sail so right in, you shall then run over the tail of the
Hill in eleeaen or twelve foot. The Hill is a land somewhat flat, which men may
come near to the south side by their lead, but the Newsand is very steep, and
the sea breaks very much upon it. When as you come in by the strand into the
Keel, then run in along by the strand, as is before said in the description
of the Keel.

For to sail in at the Velt, you must observe these marks here under
described: almost upon the southermost end of Schowen stands a Tower alone in
the field, with a cape upon it, called West-schowen, bring that Tower a
capstane bars length to the southwards of the foresaid southermost cape of
Westschowen, The (...)
and run so right in, and then you shall run through betwixt the Newsand
and the Baniard, and shall find upon the shoales (thwart of the outermost
point of the Newsand) twelve and fourteen foot; being past that; there will be
again fifteen, sixteen, and eighteen foot, and by the strand twenty foot
deep. When you come in by the strand, run all along by it until you come
even to Zierick-zee, as here before is said of the Keel, and Newdeepe. When you
run in at this channel, you must take very good heed of the Banjard, which
is very steep upon the north side; close to it, there is three, four, and
five fathom, but thwart of the foresaid strand which lies of from Schowen,
six and seven fathom deep. The New-sand is indifferent flat on the south side,
that you may borrow of it by your lead.

The Veer-gat.
For to sail in the Veer-gat (coming from the northwards) you must keep
West-cappell not to the westwards of south from you, and then you cannot come
to near the Banjaer: but if you bring West-cappel to the westwards of the
south from you, you should lightly sail upon the Baniaert, Marks of the
Baniaert.
run so right with West-cappell, until that Middelbrough come over
East-chappell, then you are to the end of the Baniaert, sail then right with
East-cappell and Middelbrough, until that Cortgeen come through or a great
capstane bars length to the Southwards of West-kercke, they are two Towers
standing in the suncken land, and shall be then about eastsoutheast from you,
keep these Towers so standing, and run in so right with them, and you shall
run in sight of the first buy of the Veer-gat. In the Veergat lie three buys
with two bottomes, of fashion like great Hogsheads, which you must leave all on
the starboard side. Before you come to the first buy, you shall sail by
another buy on the larboard side, lying upon the point of the Polle, The Polle.
which is a point of the Baniaert, that is, a Pear buy, of fashion like all
other sea buys that lie in the Mase or Elsewhere. The foresaid first buy in the
Veergat lies in three fathom and a half. From the first to the second and
third buy, the course is southeast and by east, or somewhat more southerly,
but you may easily see from the one to the other. The second and third buys
lie in two fathom, each upon a point of a plate, called the Maid. Maid.
Over against the third buy lies a shoale called the Unrest, Unrest.
which lies with a longsharpe point toward the third buy, so that it is not
there very broad betwixt them, therefore you must run close along to the
northwards of the buy: betwixt the buy and the foresaid point of the Unrest,
it is not deeper then twelve and thirteen foot, but thwart of the first and
second buy, it is broad and deep enough. Being past the third buy, sail then
right to Ter-Veer. Over against Ter-Veer lies a plate, called the Scotsman,
which you have only to avoid.

If you will go in at the Roompot to Zierick-zee, For to sail in at the Roompot
and that you are come betwixt the foresaid Pear buy upon the point of the
Polle, and the first or outtermost buy of the Veer-gat, then comes Domburgh
to the Hoot, which is a white sand-hill upon Walcheren, almost of fashion like
the Woolsackes upon the land off Schowen: keep them one in the other, and you
shall run along by two buys more, Wolplai^
which shall lie on the larboard side along by the Polle, and you shall see
one buy with a tail lying upon the west point of the Wool-plate* over against
the third buy of the Polle: betwixt these two buys you must run through,
leaving that with the tail on the starboard side, and run about by it to the
eastwards. There lie also two buys with tails, (besides the foresaid) upon
the Wool-plate, you may easily see from one to the other, these you must leave
on the starboard side, and run along to the northwards of them, about
eastsoutheast on, so long till the steeple of Koukercke (upon Schowen) come
even without the point of Schowen, run then in right with that point, and
about by it, and then along by the shore unto Zierick-zee. When as you run
toward the point of Schouwen, then you sail through betwixt two buys more,
the one lying on the starboard side, upon the eastermost point of the Baniart,
or Hooghplate, and the other with a tail on the starboard side, upon the point
of another plate, called Poolvoet, lying betwixt the land of Schowen and
Oresand. All the buys with tails men must leave (in sailing in) on the
starboard side, and those without tails on the larboard side.

The Fishermen run (by day) most about to the southwards of the Poolvoet
plate, and leave the foresaid buy with the tail, then on the larboard side;
that plate is somewhat flat, that men may borrow off it by their lead, but they
must sound quick: but by night they run by Schowen close along by the shore,
which is exceeding steep and needle too.

The Channel betwixt the Island Walcheren and Flanders, hach diverse deepes,
and channels, where men may sail in and out through with great ships, as the
Botkill, the Doorloye, the Splete, and the Wieling. It is commonly called after
one of the chiefest of the same, with the name of the Wielings. The greatest
shoales, betwixt which these foresaid channels do run through, are: The
Rasses, the Rasses The Raen The English Poll. the French Poll.
the Raen, the English Polle, and the Innerbanck. The Rasses lie along the
west side of Walcheren: The Raen to the westwards of it: The English Polle
betwixt them and the coast of Flanders, lying of to the westwards with a long
small, ribb unto thwart of Oostend. The Inner-banck lies betwixt the east end
of the English Polle and Casand, which is also called the French Poll, or the
Ripped.

The Bot-kill.
For to sail out at the Bot-kill, you must run from Flushing within 2 Cables
lengths along by the shore, thorough betwixt the land and the Geer and the
Rasse, the shore is very steep, so that men may come close by it with great
ships without any danger, the Rasses are flat on the cast or the inner side
toward the land. To the eastwards, or to the southwards of Souteland in that
fareway it is 5 and 6 fathom deep, but to the northwards, or to the westwards
it is deeper, and thwart of Westcappel 8 and 9 fathom. When the Church of
Westcappel (which has a flat steeple) comes over the mill, thwart of that
runs a channel through betwixt the n. etc. Rasses w. s. w. into the sea
where remains at low water no less then 2 fathom water, M^rkes of the Botkil.
keep West-cappell and the foresaid mill one in the other, and run out so
by them. When Buys Church comes over the foresaid mill of Westcappell, then
keep them one in the other, and you shall run then right out at the Botkil
through betwixt the n. Rasses on the larboard side, and a sand called Calloo on
the starboard side. In the Botkill is not less then 4 f. and a half depth,
but upon both the Rasses remains at low water, no more then 2 foot and a
half, and upon Calloo 3 or four fathom.

To the northwards of the sand Calloo lies yet a plate called the Quernes,
Quernes.
lying northwards almost until thwart of Domburgh, betwixt them both is a
channel of four or five fathom depth, called the Easter-gat; For to sail out
there, or to find it coming in out of the sea, you must bring Westcappell to
the northermost head, Land-Deep.
which is a head very good to be known, and run out in or thereby. Betwixt the
quernes and the land goes out yet a Land-deep of three fathom and a half. For
to find that coming in out of the sea, you must run to the shore, thwart of
Domburg (which is a sharp steeple) into 3 fathom, or 2 fathom and a half, and
keep the sounding of the shore so near as you please, and run in so along
by the heads, until you be come within, When you come in at any of these
channels, and are come so far to the eastwards, as betwixt Buyens Church and
Soutland, and that you must turn to windwards with an easterly wind, then you
may sail through betwixt the easter Rasses, and the plate to the westwards of
it, called the Geere, and so come out in the broad channel into the Dorloy
and Splete and run so about to the southwards of the Geer unto Flushing.

About 2 leagues without the land of Walcheren lies a long small bank, lying
s. w. and. n. east, called the Stone bank, upon the midst where of there is
no more then 2 fathom, and upon the north-end of it 3 fathom water. He that will
sail in or out at the Botkill, or the channels to the n. of it, the Eastergat
or Land-deep, must sail about either to the northwards or to the southwards of
that Stone-bank: When Middleburgh comes over Domburgh, then are you thwart of
this Stone-bank, but if you bring Middleburgh half ways betwixt Domburgh and
East-cappell, and so sail to the land, then you run along to the northwards
of it. Or else if you bring West-cappell e.s. e. from you, in a black valley of
the sand-hills, and sail so right in, then you run along to the westwards
or the southwards of it. Marks of the Stone bank.
Within the Stone-bank it is again 8 or 9 and at some places 10 fathom deep.
Upon the foresaid marks and course, to wit, West-cappel east souhteast from you
in the black valley, you may sail right in at the Botkil: when that
East-cappell comes then somewhat through Domburgh or to the eastwardes of it,
then you shall get deeper water, go then toward the shore, and so along by
it, as is before said. A little from the south west end of the Stone-bank lies
yet another, but it is not long, called the Oyster-bank, Oyster-banke.
upon it remains at low water about 4 fathom Water.

The Doorloy.
For to sail from Flushing out at the Doorloy with ships that draw much Water,
you must set sail when the Water is flowed an hour or two, for to come with
half flood, or against the highest Water to the shoales, go from Flushing
first along by the shore, and then westnorthwest, until that West-cappell
come within two ships length to the point of the Sand-hill, to wit, that
West-cappel stand so much within the west point of the Sand-hils, bring that
alsoo not further out, not nearer to the point of the Sand-hills, for else you
should sail upon the Raen. When that West-cappell stands so, and S. Anne (a
flat Steeple in Flanders to the westwards of Sluice) stands amongst the east
Sand-hils of Casand, then go northwest and by west out at the Doorloy. When
that S. Anne comes then to the westwards of that foresaid Sand-hill, then
comes the castle of Sluice, under or behind that sand-hill, keep that under,
or right to the east side of the foresaid sand-hils, and then go out northwest
and by west, and you shall go clear of the Raen and the Rasses. If you bring
West-cappell without the sand-hills before that Saint Anne come without the
foresaid sand-hills of Casand, then you shall be to far to the northwards,
and to near the Rasses. Or if you bring Sint Anne without the sand-hills of
Casand, before West-cappell come to the end of the sand-hills, then you shall
be to far to the southwards, and shall come against the Raen, but when you
bring West-cappell to the point of the sand-hill, and S. Annes without the
sand-hills of Casant one as soon as the other, then you are amid the channel
of the Doorloy right in the fareway.

For to find the Doorloy coming in out of the sea.
For to find the Doorloy coming in out of the sea, you must run to the Raen by
the lead, until that West-chappell come within a masts length near to the
Sconce, and sail so right in, or take the sounding of the Raen, and run
along by it, until that S. Anne come to the foresaid east sandhill of
Casand, then go in along s. e. and by east, and you shall soon be over the
shoalest and find deeper water, but you must reckon well your ty^^^ for the
flood falls in to the Doorloy first south (as also the after-ebbe) afterward
s. s. e. and at last to the southwards. Therefore if you will go in at the
Doorloy with a fore-flood, you must go at least e. s. east, or else (if you
should go in upon your direct course) you should lightly be carried against
the Raen. Coming then out of the sea along by the Raen, until that S. Anne
be hidden amongst the sand-hils of Casand, then go on eastsoutheast, until
that Westcappell come within the point of the sand-hils, and then run boldly
right on with Flushing. In dark weather men may sound along by the Rasses;
when that you keep the Castle of Sluice to the eastwards of the foresaid
sand-hill upon Casand, then you cannot take hurt of the Raen, but when the
Church of Sluice stands to the w. side of the foresaid sand-hills, then you
are thwart of the shoalest of the Raen.

The Splete.
For to sail from Flushing out at the Splete, you must go on first (as is
before fayd) w. n. west, until that west-cappell come almost to the point of
the sand-hils, but not without it, or that the steeple of Middlebrough come to
the Inner sand-hill, then go w. s. west, and then you run out at the Splete,
which is more then a great half league broad, and at low water upon the
shoalest 4 fa. and a half deep. Betwixt Soutland and Dyshoeck lies a high
sand-hill, which is at the east end somewhat steep, called the Doorne-hill,
Doornhil.
to the eastwards of it lies another sand-hil, which is somewhat long, not
altogether so high as the Doorne-hil, with a clift or little dale in it, which
does (as it were) divide the long sand-hill in two sand-hills, the southermost
is called the Inner sand-hill, Inner sand hill.
because that to the southwards of it there are no more high sand-hils. When
that the steeple of Middlebrough comes over that Inner sand-hill, or in that
foresaid clift, and keep that over it or in it, then you run out at the
Splete, and can take no hurt neither of the Poll nor the Raen.

Engllsh Pol.
The English Poll is ^epe, but with easterly winds men may borrow of it by the
lead. The Raen The Raen.
is flat on the Inner side as well as on the out side, so that men may sound
out along by it all the Splete when you cannot have sight of the foresaid
marks in dark weather, and it is so broad, that men have an half hours work
for to sail thwart over it, but the English Poll is so narrow, that men may
run over it with four or five casts of the lead. When that Aerdenburgh
comes without the foresaid sand-hils of Casant, then you are past the dry
Raen, Marks of the Raen.
but it lies yet out to the westwards with a great flat, so far to the
westwards, until Bridges comes to the eastwards of Blanckenbrough in the
Gallow sherds, which are high sand-hils to the eastwards of Blanckenbrough,
where in times past was wont a Gallows to stand, then you are past all the
shoales, and may go your course where you desire to be. Blanckenbrough has a
flat steeple somewhat higher (but not so thick) as Liswegen.

From the end of the English Poll lies a long ribbe (about a shot of a cast
piece broad) to the westwards, until past Oostend, The Ripped.
called the Ripped, it is hard sand, and good ancher ground. When Blanckenbrough
stands southeast and by e. from you, there is upon the Ripped at low water six
fathom deep, more to the eastwards toward the English Poll it is shoaler,
but the farther to the westwards the deeper unto the outerbanck thwart of
Oostend. A shot of a cast piece to the northwards of that Ripped it is deeper,
and soft ground. Also when you come toward the south or s. s. e. a shot of a
cast piece over the Ripped, it will be presently a half fathom deeper, and soft
ground, that is, then the other channel of the Wielinge. Therefore when you
come out of the sea, and will sail in at the Splete, edge to the coast of
Flanders, when you are (by your reckoning) past Oostend, and borrow to it by
your lead, until that you get hard ground, and shoaler water, that is then for
certain that foresaid Ripped: having found that in six, seven, or eight fathom,
according as you shall be to the eastwards or the westwards, then edge of again
to the northwards into the sea, until it begin to shoale, and be hard ground;
keep so the sounding of the Ripped until that you find again deeper water and
soft ground, run in then east^^^theast, and edge now and then to the
southwards toward the north side of the foresaid Ripped, until that Bridges
com^eth to Liswegen (being a flat and very thick steeple) or that
Blancken^rough stand south from you, then you come thwart of the point of the
Raen into the Splete. Then bring the steeple of Middlebrough over the foresaid
Inner sand-hill, betwixt Soutland and Dishoeck, and run in right with it, e. n.
e. on, until that the castle of Sluice come to the eastwards of the foresaid
east sand-hils of Casant, sail then right on with Flushing, and so you shall
go clear both of the Raen and the Pols. If it should happen in dark or misty
weather, that you cannot see Middlebrough, then run in by your lead along by
the north side of the Ripped eastnortheast until that you find shoaling and ha^^
ground of the banck, and so you shall run in betwixt the Raen and the banck. The
west end of the Raen is flat, which you may sound very well. In the channel
betwixt the banck, or English Poll, and the Raen, it is soft ground on both
sides, as well toward the Raen, as toward the banck, it does begin to shoale,
and to be hard ground. When Heyst, that is, a high sharp steeple comes to the
firebeakon, thwart of that is the banck, or English Poll at the shoalest, to
the eastwards of that, the banck waxes deeper; Being come past the shoalest,
if you edge toward the banck, you shall find deeper water, and may run over
there at half flood with 18, foot, but it is not good to do it, for not to
sail upon the French Poll, but keep all along the sounding and hard ground
of the banck, and shape your course a little more easterly for to avoid the
Rasses which lie thwart of Soutland, and are steep. When you are come somewhat
further in, go then east on toward Flushing, and you shall not come near any
shoals. Thwart through the Raen goes a Slenck Slenck through the Raen.
where remains at low water, not less then ^ fathom and a half water; for
to find it coming in out of the sea, you must bring Aerdenburgh a little
without the point of the sand-hils of Casand, or Westchappel in Flanders a
little to the eastwards of Knock, sail then right with it, until that you get
deeper water, or that the steeple of Middlebrough come over the inner
sand-hill, and then in along with it. West-chappel in Flanders is a short
flat little steeple, with a little short blunt spire, or cap upon it, but Knock
is a sharp steeple not so high as Heyst.

The Wielinge and inner-Wielinge.
For to sail in at the Wielinge coming in out of the sea you must run on to
the coast of Flanders, (when you are past Oostend) until you come in 5 fathom.
Thwart of Blancken-brough there was wont a few years past to lie a bancke or
share off from the shore, which men might sail within, coming from the
westwards: now there is nothing but a little flat, and Dobbelsand is alsoo
altogether clean gone. Or else you must look out for Liswegen a flat steeple,
and the thickest thereabouts. When the steeples of Bridges, (being called the
Bruggelingen) stand a cables length to the westwards of Liswege^ then are you
yet to the westw. off all the sands, polles, and banckes, keep these steeples
so standing and run on to the coast, until you come over the foresaid Ripped,
and that you find again soft ground, and more depth, until you come in 5
fathom, go then n.e. and n.e. and by east with a flood, or northeast and
northeast, and by north with an ebb (reckon well your tide, which runs
there most e.s.e. somewhat southerly, and w.n.w. somewhat northerly, and the
tide runs but a little hour along the land) keep the steeple Wenduynen
one or 2 ships lengths without the Sconce of Blanckenbrough, so long as you can
see them, and still in 5 fathom; when as Heyst comes then to Bridges, and
Westcapel to Knock, then are you right in the fareway of the Wieling, the
nearer that you are to the bancke of the English Poll, the deeper water you
shall find, except that you have the shoaling of the banck it self. Bridges
must come first to Heyst, or else you should be to far to seawards, or to near
to the English Poll; with a foreflood you may bring them both at once together,
but not with a fore ebb. If you get then shoaling, that is, of the English
Poll, go from thence along the same course, through betwixt the English Poll
and the French Poll, or Innerbanck, that is a hard sand and steep, but the
English Poll is thereabouts flat, which you may sound. When as that the castle
of Sluice comes to S. Lambert (a high flat steeple upon Casand, to the
northwards or to the eastwards off the Sluice) then you are past the French
Poll, Marks of the French Poll.
go then east on right with Flushing, or else observe these marks following:
Liswegen must not come within Heyst, before the Castle of Sluice come to the e.
sand-hil of Casand, but remain without it, or else you should sail on against
the innerbanck, when as that the Castle comes to the sand-hil, go then
boldly northeast and by east and eastnortheast, for to avoid the French Poll,
until that the steeple of Flushing come to the northwards of the Prisongate,
then you get deeper water: go then on east, and east and by south right with
Flushing. There remains in the Wieling, as also in the inner Wieling at the
lowest water, not less then 4 fathom and a half water.

The inner Wieling.
The inner-Wieling lies in through betwixt the innerbank, or French Poll, and
Casant. When you come from the westwards into the Wieling, and are come so
far, that Westchappel come to Knock, and will go in at the inner-Wieling, then
go from thence east and by s. on and you shall espy the buy upon the point of
the Paerd-marck (that is, a sand that shoots off from the east point of Sluice
haven, and is very steep) leave that buy on the starboard side, and keep S.
Lamberts steeple even without the s. sand-hill of Casant or Sluice haven, and
go on n. e. or somewhat more northerly along by the shore, for to avoid the
Krakesand, Krakesand.
when as then the Castle of Sluice and S. Lamberts steeple come one in the
other, then go on east right with Flushing.

Flanders is a Land full of sand-hils and hommocks, with many steeples along
the coast, lying from the Haven of Sluice unto Callice, most w. s. w. and e. n.
east. The first steeple to the westwards of Sluice is S. Anne a flat steeple,
and then Westchappell a little short flat steeple, with a blunt cap upon it.
Heyst to the westwards of them is a long sharp steeple higher then Knock.
Betwixt Heyst and Blanckenbrough, lies Liswegen somewhat within the land, that
is a flat steeple, and the thickest of all the steeples there abouts.
Blanckenbrough is alsoo a flat steeple higher then Liswegen, but not so thick
Within the land from Blanckenbrough stands Bridges, two thick sharp steeples
upon one Church, to the westwards of Blanckenbrough a great half league lies
Wenduynen a sharp steeple.

Of the tides and co^^ses of the Streams.
Before Brewers-haven, a s. s. w. and n. n. e. Moon makes high water.

In the Channel of Brewers-haven a south and by west Moon.

At Ter-Veer a s. s. w. and n. n. e. Moon.

In the Veer-gat a s. and n. Moon.

It is not good to run in at Veer-gat, especially with a southerly or
southwest wind, before that the flood be half spent, for the after-ebbe, and
the foreflood fall thwart over the Baniaert hard in at the Roompot, toward the
land of Schowen, but when the flood is half spent, then it falls right in at
the Veer-gat. When the Moon is southeast, or northwest, then the water is
there already two third parts flowen.

Like as it is here before said of the Mase and the Goerees-gat, so also here
before the channels of Brewers-haven and Ter-Veer the flood turns about with
the Sun, so that the after-flood falls in the channels, and the afterward
turns about to the southwards, and becomes a running ebb, but the
after-ebbs fall right out at the channels thwart into the sea, and then with
the fore-flood about again to the northwards.

Before the Wielings a south and by w. and a s. s. w. Moon makes the highest
water.

At Flushing and Ramekens a s.s.w. Moon.

At West-chappell on the land of Walcheren, a south and north Moon makes high
water. When the water is a half hour fallen, then the tide begins to fall
out there, and when it is flowen a half hour, it begins to fall in: but
before the Botkill it begins to go therefirst an hour before the lowest
water, but it falls long at sea. In the Splete, and over the shoals lying the
abouts; the tide turns about against the Sun, and at last falls in at the
channels. A south and north Moon makes there the highest water. The fore-flood
falls over the shoals there toward the land. When the Moon is about
eastsoutheast, or that the water be about two hours flowen, then it begins
to turn toward the south, first southsouthwest, and then past the south
toward the east, until that the Moon be southsoutheast, and then the flood
falls to the eastwards. When Blanckenbrough stands about southeast and by
east from you, from thence to the eastwards, the tide turns about against the
Sun, but from thence to the westwards, you shall not find the tides to turn
about.

Against Zealand in the fare way a third part of the flood falls toward the
land, and afterward east and by north. Men may see Zealand from the poope in
16 fathom.

Courses and Distances.
From Flushing to Blanckenbrough nearest Westsouthwest, 9 leagues. From
Blanckenbrough to Oostend southwest and by west. 2 leagues. From Flushing to
the north Forland, west somewhat southerly 25 leagues. From the Wielings to
Dover w. and by south 26 leagues. From the Wielings to Lay-stasse or Yarmouth,
north west 32 leagues.

The fourth Demonstration. Which unfoldeth The Coast of Flanders, from the
Wielings to the Heads, about Callice, together with the Coast of England, from
Dover to the north Forland.
BEtwixt Wenduynen and Blanckenbrough stands another little steeple, called
John David's steeple. Oostend lies a great league to the westwards of
Wackerhout. A half league to the west wards of Ostend, lies S. Catelyn, and a
league to the westwards of it is Midlekerck, being a high thick flat steeple.
From Middle-kerck to Newport it is two leagues, there is a flat steeple with a
little sharp steeple. A little to the eastwards of Newport lies our Lady of
Lombardy, a high flat steeple.

From Newport to Broers it is two leagues, and from Broers to Dunkercke three
leagues. The Southkoten is a league to the eastwards of Dunkerck. Dunkerck has
a high flat steeple, with a little sharp steeple. From Dunkerck to Graveling
are three leagues, betwixt them stand these steeples, first little Sinten a
little sharp steeple, great Sinten a thick flat steeple, Mardycke a thick
flat steeple, and S. Georges a high sharp steeple, Graveling has no steeples,
but there stand two mills, one on the Easter-gate, and the other on the west
end of the town. From Graveling to Callice are three leagues. Callice has
many sharp Steeples, where of one is higher then all the rest, and betwixt
both lie these villages most without steeples. First Hooghenpryse and Dasen,
two flat steeples; more Valdam a flat Church with a little spire upon the
midst of it, that is all the knowledge of Flanders. The Coast of Flanders
betwixt Callice and Blanckenbrough, is four and twenty leagues long, or as
some say, one and twenty leagues, and Blanckenbrough from Flushing nine
leagues. So that Flushing is from Callice, at the least 30 leagues, or as some
say 33 leagues at the most.

That which is here said of the steeples and leagues along the coast of
Flanders, is very serviceable and needful as well for that which is before
described of the Wielings, as also fot the sailing into the havens of Flanders,
but especially for the knowledge of the Flemish bancks.

For to sail into Oostend, Oostend.
you must run close to the eastwards of the town into the haven, called the
Gueule on the east point of the haven lies a head, whereupon stands a
beakon, you must run close in by that head, there it is deepest, from the west
side to wit toward the town, shoots of a little flat, whereof you must
avoid that side a ships length or 2, at low water and a common tide remains
in this havens mouth 6 foot, and at high water there is two and twenty foot
water. A little within the haven you may anchor where you will, and at low
water you may lie there with a great ship a float.

Newport Newport
is a tyde-haven, which falls altogether dry at low water and at high water
and a common tide there is 13 footwater, close before the havens mouth is a
bank, which lies from the eastwards of the Haven of Newport over to the
westwards, thwart before the Havens mouth, and at half flood lies dry, and at
high water there comes no more upon it then eight foot water.

He that will go into Newport, must go in from the westwards betwixt the
foresaid banck and the land, For to fall into Newport.
and sail unto the southwards of the banck so long until that the innermost
beakon come even through, or to the eastwards of the outermost, and then run in
so right by them, and in along amidst the channel betwixt the heads. Betwixt
the banck and the land it is on both sides flat rising ground, so that you may
sound the shoares on both sides, but on the north side the banck is somewhat
steep, it is 3 fathom deep close along by it. Within the havens mouth it is
set on both sides of the deep with beakons, where you must run through betwixt,
until you come before the Town, which lies about a Cannon shot from the
seaside. There is fire in the night upon the 2 great beakons, out not longer
then from half flood to half ebb.

From New-port to Dunkercke along by the shore through within the banckes,
it is clean without any foul ground or bancks, and at low water fifteen foot
deep, the nearer the shore the deeper. Thwart of the Cloister Ten Duynen
betwixt it and Broers banck, it is narrowest, which lies not far from the
shore, thwart of it you must go close along by the shore.

The Quade-bancke Quade-banck.
runs of to the eastwards of the head of Dunkercke, at least two leagues to
the westwards ending thwart of the heads of Dunkercke. To the eastwards of the
easter head of Dunkerck me^ may anchor behind this banck, and lie sheltred for
a northwest, north, and northeast wind, it is two fathom deep there at low
water, but in the coming in, it is shoaler. Before the Havensmouth of
Dunkerck, it is 9 and ten fathom deep, and to the westwards of the wester-head
of Dunkerck, 6. 7. and 8. fathom, from thence men may run over the small
banck in three fathom, and come against the Broad bancke. This small bancke
Smal-banck.
lies right thwart before the Haven of Dunkerck, to wit, betwixt Dunkercke and
the Broad-banck.

For to sail into Dunkerck.
For to sail into Dunkerck you must bring the fires within a capstane bars
length one to the other, to wit, the innermost so much to the eastwards of the
outtermost, keep them so, and run in then close along by the easter-head,
the wester-head lies somewhat further of into the sea then the other, thwart
of it lies a sandplate with some pales, therefore you must avoid it, and run
in close along by the easterhead it is a narrow haven, and at high water and
a common tide there comes no more then 12 foot water. In the night they do
fire there as at Newport, from half flood to half ebb, and the lowest
fire-beakon stands next unto the sea.

From the wester-head of Dunkerck runs of a bancke about 2 leagues long,
called the Splinter, The Splinter.
which falls dry at low water at many places, men may sail in by the shore,
behind this banck from the westwards almost to the westerhead of Dunkerck, and
there may come to an anchor in 5, 6, 7, and eight fathom. About half a league
from the foresaid wester-head, there runs a Slenck through the foresaid
bancke, where little Ships may go through at high water.

Graveling Graveling
is also a tyde-haven, where men must go in at high water, there stand two
beakons, which you must keep one by the other, and sail so in betwixt the
heads, on the west side runs off a little riffe, which you must avoid. When
you come from the eastwards along the coast running through Wolbreck Sound,
at the end of the Brakes, (that are the banckes before Dunkerck, and from
thence westwards) then you come against the west point of the foresaid little
riffe or out-sand off Graveling, which lies a good way of into the sea, to the
eastwards of it men run into the Haven of Graveling by night right in with the
fires.

To the westwards of the Haven of Graveling lies a bancke or flat along the
shore, lying a good way of from the land to sea-wards, almost as far to the
westwards as Callice, Newlanden.
called the New-Land, men may run along by it, or over it in five, four,
and three fathom, according as men will.

The haven of Callice Callice.
falls every tide altogether dry, and at high water with a common-tyde, there
is no less then three fathom water. For to sail in there you must keep the
mill (standing on the east corner of the town) right over the easter-head, and
run in so close along by the easterhead, and let the castle lie on the west
side of you, from the wester head runs of a little the riffe, therefore you
must avoid it. When you are come in within the westerhead, you must go up to
the westwards into Paradise, and there lie dry at low water. By night when the
tide serves, there stand two fires, you must run in right with them. It is not
good to come into this haven before high water, because of the exceeding strong
tide that runs in there with the flood, for to avoid the anchors of the
ships, which lie there within. It is there within dangerous and bad lying,
especially with a n. ly wind which blows there open in.

Thwart of from wester-head of Callice lies a bank of two fathom, betwixt the
head or Meyland, and the same bank men may run through in three fathom at
half flood, the bank is two fathom deep. Under Callice cliffe at the east
end, men may anchor in then fathom but at the westend lies a rock under
water, a bow shot from the land. Callice cliffe Callice-cliffe.
lies betwixt Callice and Blanck nesse.

Of the Flemish Bancks.
West from West-cappell, and northwest from Oostend, about nine leagues without
the Coast of Flanders, lies a little plate, whereupon at low water is no more
then two and twenty foot water, in foul weather the sea breaks very much
upon it.

About two leagues from Oostend without the land lies the Trick, The Trick.
or outerbanck, upon it there is no more then fifteen or sixteen foot water.
When S. Catherines steeple comes against Oostend, then you come on against
this banck: betwixt this bank and the heads of Oostend, lies another bank of
three fathom water.

Betwixt Oostend and Newport lie four bancks, all which four begin about
thwart of Oostend, the two nearest to the lands end thwart of Newport. The
other lie all along the land almost to Dunkercke: the first and nearest to
the land is called the Geere, The Geer
betwixt that and the land goes a channel through, of 8. 9. and 10. fathom.

The second called Laland, Laland.
ends also against Newport, betwixt these two goes a channel through of
eight and nine fathom.

The third are two banks one to the other, the eastermost ending half ways:
Laland is called stroom, Stroom
the westermost ending thwart of Dunkerck, is called the Stone-bank Stone-banck.
which has on the east side a hook, which lies to the eastwards, running to
nothing almost against Newport: this bank is three or four fathom, and upon
the east end five and six fathom.

The fourth is alsoo in two banks, the eastermost is called Sandele, Sandele
or Oudemoers bank, Oudmoers Banck.
and the westermost Call bank, Calbank.
of some called alsoo Small bank, which lies along by the Broad-bank: but
that outer end lies at least two great leagues of.

The ships that will go before Dunkerck and cannot get along by Flanders,
do run about without these banks, until they come against Broad-banke, and
then run in along by it 5 or 6 fathom. The Channel is 15 fathom deep, and
every one of these four banks has a dry Poelder. When 2 Steeples (that are
somewhat flat to the southward of Newport) stand a handpikes length asunder,
then are you thwart of these four banks here before mentioned, which are not
deeper at low water then one fathom, and at spring-tydes fall almost dry.

Betwixt all these banks you may anchor in 9. 10. 11. and also in 12 fathom,
you may run over them, in 4 fathom, but when you are to the westwards of them
you shall find it deeper, to wit, 8. 9. and 10 fathom.

The Broers banck Broers banck.
is three cornerd, and lies close by the land thwart of Broers and the
Cloister Ten Duyne^, and lies of from the shore about westnorthwest a league
into the sea, when the Cloister Ten Duynen, or the Broers lies south from you,
then you are at the innermost part of the Broers-bank, you may run through
betwixt the land and this banck, in four fathom at low water; but men do run
commonly about to the westwards of it, when they sail through within the
banks, along the Coast of Flanders.

A little to the westwards of Broers-banck lies the Cams-banke, Cams-banck.
which is three fathom deep, and lies in many Rasses, you may run through
betwixt the land and this bank also in 8. 9. and 10. fathom, and alsoo may
ride there for alt winds. By the land, betwixt this bank and Broers-banck, it
is 5 fathom deep. When you run through betwixt this bank and the land, then
you come along by the Quade bank until you come before the Haven of
Dunkerck. When you are a good ways past the head of Dunkerck, about s. w. from
the Splinter, then you run over a shoale of two fathom, called Wilbaert
Sound, Wilbaert Sound.
being over it you shall have again then, 11 and 12 fa. When Borburger Steeple
comes in the valley of the sand-hill, then you are thwart of this bancke, by
these marks you may sail through these bancks northnorthwest into the sea,
and come against the tail of the Broad-banck in four fathom. When as that you
do edge again somewhat toward the land in twelve, thirteen, or fifteen
fathom; then you may sail through betwixt the Broad and the Small ban^ke, on
eastnortheast, or east and by north until you are past the Cloister Ten
Duynen, or the Broers-Banck, which lies off from the Cloister about a league
into the sea. To the eastwards past this banck it begins to be shoale water
against Newport four or five fathom, being past Newport, you must edge toward
the land, in eight or nine fathom, keeping close to the land, and then you shall
run through betwixt the land and the Geere, (which lies along toward
Oostend:) When you come against Oostend, then you are clear of the bancks, and
then you may run into the sea for to go into the Wielings.

Marks of the Flemish bancks.
There lie yet five long banckes along Flanders. When Graveling is southeast
from you then you are thwart of the south end of these banks: and when Newport
is southeast from you. Then you are thwarr of the north end of them they are
very long, and betwixt each goes a wide Channel through, of eight, nine,
twelve, fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, nineteen, and twenty fathom deep, each
of a several depth.

The outermost or westermost bank called the Cliffe The cliffe
lies from Callice cliffe northnortheast about four leagues and a half, and
is three fathom and a half deep: betwixt this and the other goes a wide
channel throug of three and twenty and 24 fathom deep.

The second called the Ruyting, The Ruytinig.
lies from Callice cliffe northeast and by north about four leagues, and is
there five or six fathom deep, but upon the south end of it, is a Poelder of a
fathom and a half. When the south end of Winocxbergen comes betwixt the two
flat steeples to the westwards of Dunkerck, then are you thwart of this Poelder.

There stand three or four mils to the eastwards of Dunkerck, when the
outermost comes over the east end of the town, that is also a good mark of
this Poelder or shoale, and then the steeple of Dunkerck shall be from you s.e.
five leagues.

Betwixt this and the third goes alsoo a channel through of 12 and 13 fathom

The third, called the Dyke, The Dyke
lies from Callice Cliffe northeast, and is deep four and five fathom, upon
the south and north end of this Bancke are Poelders, the southermost is deep
one fathom, and lies also upon the marks of Winocxbergen about northwest,
somewhat westerly from Dunkerck, and is called the Polder of the Dyke, or
Dyke-Polder, the other Polder or shoale of this bancke is about four fathom
and two foot deep, and lies n. w. from the Cloister Ten Duynen. These bancks
are very dangerous; for the Ruyting lies almost in the fare-way, and at low
water they have no more then two fathom depth.

The fourth banck, called Kettell-banck, lies from Callice-Cliffe northeast
and by cast, and is deep, three, four, five and six fathom. Upon the south
end is a shoale of one fathom water at low water, at spring-tydes these Polders
fall dry. Along by this goes also a channel through of 19 and 20 fathom.

To the eastwards of the Kettel-banck, to wit, betwixt that and the Broad-banck
goes throug a great channel of 19 and 20 fathom.

In all the channels betwixt the foresaid banckes, men may turn to windwards
every where from one bancke to the other, and anchor betwixt the bancks where
they will.

The south end of the Broad-bancke Broad banck.
lies from Callice-cliffe eastnortheast, and has one shoale upon the south
end of one fathom and a half, is throughout three and 4 fathom deep.

The north end is deep 6, 7, and 8, fathom, and lies so far to the northward,
until Newport be northwest from you, or the Cloister Ten Duynen be
northnorthwest 5, or 6, leagues from you.

The Coast of England from Dover to the north Forland.
Betwixt Callice and Dover amiddest in the fare-way, (or somewhat nearer the
French side then the English) lies a narrow bancke of four leagues long,
lying about n. n. east, and southsouthwest along the land of Blackness,
being called the Vaen, and by the Dutchmen called Vrow-sand, of 5, 6, 7, and 8,
fathom depth, and runs to the southwards toward the land of Bulleyn. West
and by south from Callice-cliffe, and south and south and by east from Dover,
is the shoalest of it, at low water not deeper then sixteen or seventeene
foot. On both sides of this banck, as well along to the eastwards as to the
westwards of it, it is 20, 22, 23, and 24, fathom deep. Men may anchor before
Dover for a north and northwest wind, right against the Castle, in ten
fathom, is the best road, and clean ground. For to sail into the Downs from
the southwards, you must run about by the south Forland, within two cables
length along by the land, and anchor thwart of the middlemost Castle in 7, or
8, fathom.

The southermost point of Gooding, and the south Forland lie n. e. and s. w.
asunder.

Betwixt Goodding Goodding.
and the Valley in the land off the north Forland, called Ramsgat. lie two
shoals, whereof the westermost is called the Quernes, and the eastermost the
Brakes.

For to sail from Dover (through within the Goodding, betwixt the Goodding and
the Brakes,) to the north Forlant, you must go on north and by east so long
until that the mill upon the north Forland come to the west side of the Valley
in the north Forland, then go yet north and by east, and northnortheast,
until that the little steeple upon the North Forland come to the East Side of
the foresaid valley, then you shall be to the northwards of the Brakes, and
then the little flat steeple on the south Forland comes too, or right over
the third white Chalck-hill to the Northwards of the south Forland, that is a
direct long mark, for to sail through betwixt the Brakes and Goodding, as
well when you come from the Northwards as from the South-wards.

For to sail through within the Goodding from the Northwards, you must not
come nearer the Brakes Brakes.
then in seven fathom, and set the south Forlant southsouthwest from you, and
sail then so right with it, and then you shall run along the best deep.
When as the flat steeple upon the North Forland stands in Ramsgat ot the
Valley, then you shall be thwart of the Brakes, and when the mill comes in
Ramsgat, you shall be to the southwards of the Brakes.

When you lie in the Downs, and that the inner point of the cliffe of the
south Forland lie southsouthwest from you, then the Quernes Quernes.
lie north and by east from you, and the, end of Goodding n. e. from you.

The north end of Goodding, and the point of the north Forland, lie southeast
and by east and n. w. and by w. a league and a half asunder.

For to come from the northwards into the Downs through betwixt the Brakes and
the Quernes: For to sail through betwixt the Brakes and the Quernes.
there stands a Church upon the high land of the south Forland, to the
northwards of it, which is a flat steeple, and the church somewhat great of
body, and there are 3 Castles upon the strand of the Downs, you must bring the
foresaid Church with the flat steeple right in the midst betwixt the two
southermost Castles, and then you are in the fareway in the middle of the
channel, and that will serve for a leading mark to run through betwixt the
Brakes and the Quernes, and the course lies through s. s. west. If the wind
be southerly, that you must turn to windwards through, run not further over
to the eastwards then that the foresaid church come within 2 ships length of
the southermost castle, for if you should bring them nearer, or together, then
you should run upon the brake, and being cast about run not further over the
westwards then that the foresaid church come within two ships length of the
three for if you should bring them nearer, or together, you should run upon the
Quernes, and these marks will serve to turn to windwards through betwixt the
Brakes and Quernes either from the northwards or the southwards. The Brake is
steep, being 5 s. close along by the side of it, and in the middle of the
channel is but 15 foot at low water, so that it is deeper by this side of the
Brake, then in the middle of the channel. As you turn to windwards, and run
over to the eastwards toward the Brake, as soon as you must cast about, or else
you should be against the Brake: the Querne is flat, but nevertheless as soon
as you find it shoaler (in running over to the w. wards the Querne) then 15
foot, you must cast about again, Thwart marks of a tail of sand, lying of
from the Goodding.
and so turn through. About half a league from the north end off the Goodding
to the southwards, lies of a flat tail or spit of sand to the westwards from
the Goodding, a great musket shot of, and falls dry a good ways of at low
water, which makes the channel there betwixt the Goodding and the Brake very
narrow, the thwart marks of this tail of sand are these: up within the land,
a little to the southwards of Ramsgate, stand 3 or 4 high trees together, when
these trees do come right over the southermost end of the cliffe that lies
alsoo a little to the southwards of Ramsgat, then you are thwart of this
foresaid tail of sand, as soon as you shall be past it, then you shall have
more room to turn to windwards, and may run further over to the Goodding.

For to run about a seaboard of Goodding.
For to sail from Dover without the Goodding to the north Forland, you must
keep the point to the westwards of Dover without the south Forland, and go on
northeast until that the north Forland come n.w. and by west from you, then
you may boldly run to the north Forland, and anchor before Margate, or where
that you shall think it best, but thwart of the steeple, where the mill
stands by, is the best road. Or when the point of the north Forland lies
southsouthwest and southwest and by south from you, there is alsoo good riding
in 8 or 9 fathom. Betwixt Margate and the Reculvers, me^ may anchor every where
in six or 7 fathom at half flood.

Betwixt the Querns and the north Forland men may also run through to Sandwich,
there runs of a little stonebanck from the shore, called the Fourefoot, betwixt
that and the Quernes it is at half flood two fathom deep. The Quernes are
lately grown much less, and shifted, so that the north end of them is
almost gone.

Of the tides and courses of the Streams,
Along the coast of Flanders on the Land, a south and north moon makes full
sea.

In the fareway without the Flemish banckes in the sea, a s. w. moon makes
high water.

In the midst betwixt the heads, a s. w. Moon.

At Dover, a south and north moon.

In the Downs, a southsouthwest moon.

At the n. Forland, a south and n. moon.

Along the Flemish banckes, the fore-flood falls over the banks, toward
the land, about the third part of the tide, afterward along the Land, but
the after-flood falls to the northwards along the sea in the right fareway.

When the flood begins to go there thwart off at sea, then it is already
halfflood on the land, and the water flowen half ways, so that men may go
into all the Havens on the Flemish coast with 5 or 6 foot water.

In the midst through the Heads, the flood falls n. e. and by east, and
the ebb southwest and by west.

Fro. Dover to the n. Forland, the tide falls through within the Goodding n.
and s. over the Brakes and Quernes.

Before Callice and Blackness, the flood falls first one quarter to the
land, afterward n. n. e.

Of the Depths.
In the right fare-way betwixt the Marsdeep and the Heads it is 23 and 24
fathom deep. A little without the Flemish banks 18. 19. and 20 fathom, but
near Goodding, or about the north Forland, it is 26. 28. and also 30 fathom
deep, the nearer Goodding the deeper water.

Being thwart of Goodding in 28 or 29 fathom, you shall not be 2 shots of a
cast-peece from it.

For to sail out of the Marsdeep toward the Head, go not on otherwise then
southwest, and southw. and by south, (but you must be very careful to take
heed of the tides) when you shall reckon to have sailed 40 or 46 leagues, then
edge over to the Flemish banckes until you come in 20 or 18 fathom, when that
you are sure of these grounds, then go on southwest, and at length southwest,
and by west, and you shall come in the midst betwixt the Heads of Callice and
Dover.

Flanders you may see from the Poope in 16 fathom, and then you are within the
point of the Flemish banckes.

Callice cliffe and the south Forland, or the point of Dover you may see when
you are before them in 24 fathom.

The second part of the New LIGHTNING COLUMN, THE SECOND BOOK, Of the
WESTERN NAVIGATION Containing The description of the Seacoasts of France,
from Blackenesse to Ushand, and the Coasts of England from Dover westwards, to
the Lands end the Channel of Bristow, with all the Seacoasts of Ireland.
The first demonstration, Where in Are set fourth the Coasts of France, from
Blackness to the Island Aldernay or Ornay, and From Dover to Beachy.
ABout a great league to the westwards of Callice cliffe lies Blackenesse,
Blacknisse.
a foul out-poynt, thwart of it lie many rocks along the shore. From
Blackness to the River of Bullen, lies the coast south and by east three
leagues, a league to the southwards of the Nesse, the land falls somewhat in
with a fair sandy Baye. In this Baye lies a Fisher village on the coast,
thwart of it in the sandy Baye is a very good road for easterly winds, in 5.
6. 10. 15. and 16. fathom, according as you will lie far from the shore. For
to anchor there, you must bring the steeple of the village over the midst of
the houses. This place is called S. John's road. S. John's Road.
A little to the northwards of that foresaid Fisher village, stands a mill with
some houses, from thence to the northwards you may not anchor, for there the
ground is foul and stony. To the southwards of the Road toward the River of
Bullen, lie alsoo some little rocks along the coast which you must not come
very near to.

Upon the north point of the River of Bullen stands a high thick Tower,
called the Tourd' Order, Tour d' Order.
by sea men the Old Man, Oldman.
a special mark for to know the River by. About an English mile to the
northwards of this Tower, a little mile from the shore, lies a little suncken
rock Suncken rock.
under water where a Huye or Smack may not go over.

Upon the south point of the River of Bullen Bullen.
stands a stone wall, and upon it a great Beakon of a mast, thwart of it from
the south point lies off a little riffe or shoale, that you must shun, and run
close along by the Head, which lies at the north point, and has been there
lately made. When you are come within this Head, you must presently let fall
your anchor and ride there; It is a tyde-haven, there you must go in at high
water, and at low water lie dry upon the chindle. Without, before the River,
lies a banck, men were wont from the southwards to run in over in two fathom
and from the northwards in three fathom but it is now to the southwards deeper
through the scouring of the water along the foresaid Head which is made at
the north point.

From the Oldman, or the River of Bullen to Sum The Sum.
is the course south about eleven leagues, between them lie alsoo two other
rivers, Cauche and Auty, upon the first lie Eastaples and Monstreu, there you
must go in a middle channel at the highest water, within, it falls
altogether dry at low water.

Men may sail into the Sum, For to sail into the Sum.
through two channells, from the east point called the East Down, lies off a
sand thwart before the channel; to the westwards off that riffe lies alsoo
another great banck, between them goes in the Easter-channell. For to sail in
there, bring S. Valery a cables length to the westwards of the west point of
the River, called the Oordell, and run in thereupon, until you come to the
land at that foresaid west point; and from thence close along by it, or as
soon as you get again deeper water over the banck, then turn up eastward
toward the beacons. From the point of the Oordel lies of to the northwards a
little riffe, upon the end of it lies a buy which you must leave on the
starboard side, and run in close about to the northwards of it. From the point
of the Oordell upwards, it is set allongst with beacons, you must run along
close by them, until you come within the point of S. Valery, where you must
anchor, and lie every tide dry. The sands there within do shift so often, that
they are not to be described for always.

For to sail into the western-channell, For to sail into the wester channel.
coming from the east or the north, you must run along by the banks in six
or seven fathom, and not nearer, they are so steep, that a shipp sitting fast
upon them with the fore castle, at the stern has three fathom. Coming toward
the land at the end of the banks, you shall find a buy. Or else if you come
from the west, and bring Crotoye a cables length within the Oordell, and sail
so right in, you shall find the foresaid outermost buy. Besides this, there
lie three other buys, whereof that foresaid buy on the point of the Oordell
is the fourth, and the innermost: You must leave them all on the starboard side
toward the land, and run in along by them to the northwards of them.

These channels and sands there within (all until past S. Valery) Fall at low
water altogether dry, the buys alsoo fall dry, that men may go by them, at
half flood with an ordinary tide there is no more then two fathom Water, it is
not good to go in there before that two third parts of the blood be spent.
With an ordinary tide it flows there five and six fathom, but with a
spring-tyde seven fathom up and down. At high water and spring-tyde, a man may
go over all the banks and sands with eight or ten foot Water five leagues
upwards lies Abbeville.

Thwart of the Sum, it is far off in to the sea shoale water, five, six,
seven, eight, nine and ten fathom, three or four leagues off into sea: He that
comes from the west, and finds himself in dark and misty weather to be
in such shoaling, may be well assured, not to be far from the Sum.

From the Oldman to Diep, the course is southsouthwest 18 leagues, but from the
Sum to Diep southwest and by west eight or nine leagues. About half way
between the Sum and Diep, lies the River of Heu, within it on the north
side lies Tresport, Tresport.
being alsoo a tyde-haven, where men must go in at high water, and at low
water lie dry.

At the east side of the Haven of Diep, Diep
lies a rank of rocks, and from it lies a little riffe of chindle toward
the north, or the west; to the southwards of this riffe goes in the channel,
about southeast in, it is very narrow, and a short inlet, therein lie three
buys in in the midst of the deep, not above a stones cast one from the
other, men may run in on both sides of them; coming to the end of the buys,
they must keep the middle of the channel, and run in between the heads,
until they come within the town, and there make fast with a cable on the
shore. Men may not sail in there before flood, but not at half ebb; at low
water it falls altogether dry, but within at the Town men may ride a float,
at high water there comes three fathom, or at the highest not more then 3
fathom and a half water, there come out always Pilots to bring ships in.

S. Valery, in Caux.
From Diep to Saint Valery in Caux, it is southwest and by west four leagues,
that is alsoo a tyde-haven, where you must go in with high water, it is a
narrow channel, where you go in between to the Heads, there is neither sand
nor bancke before it that can hurt you being come in, you may let your anchor
fall, and make you fast with a cable on the shore. He that has neither cable
nor anchor, may (being come there within) sail his ship on against the shore
in the chindle, and so save his ship and goods without damage.

From S. Valery to Fecam Fecam.
it is w. s. w. four leagues; that is a deep tyde-haven, there remains at
low water little less then 2 fathom water. At the east side of the
havens-mouth lies a bank or plate, men may with small ships sail in
through betwixt it and the land, and so run in, sounding, borrowing it eight
or nine foot along by the east shore, which is flat. For to sail into the
westwards of the plate, you must keep the Tower of Fecam, without the land, or
without the West point of the Haven, and then it shall be southsoutheast from
you, run then upon that mark into the Haven, and then the foresaid sand shall
remain on the larboard side of you, and at half flood you shall have in the
Havens-mouth 2 fathom water, being come in before the town, you may anchor
there by the Western shore in three fathom.

From Fecam to Struysaert Struysaert
it is westsouthwest three little leagues. Without the point of Struysaer lie
two high sharp rocks. From thence to Seynhead it is s. and s. and by west, 2.
leagues and a half.

About northwest from Seynhead lies a bancke, upon which at low water
remains no more than two fathom and a half water: when the town of
New Haven comes without Seynhead, then are you thwart of the back: For to
avoid it, run in close aboard the Seynhead, along until you come within the
first mill, there let fall your anchor in 6 fathom, and stay for a Pilot to
bring you into the haven.

For to sail into the River of Roan.
For to sail into the River of Roan, coming from the north or the east, you
must run close aboard the land to the northwards of Seynhead, and along by
it, so long until the south side of the river come unto the point of
Seynhead, then run in with it, until the land to the westwards of Newhaven
come without Newhaven, sail then unto the Haven of Newhaven. Or el^e, if you
will go without about the bancke or the Rettires, then edge over to the
westwards so far from the land until the river come open, sail then toward
the point of Tochet, and run in upon your lead by it, there is at high water
three fathom, and at low water no more then one fathom. The Rettires is a stony
bancke, lying in the midst of the River of Seine, lying over toward the
point of Honfleur, at low water it falls at some places dry, at half flood
it is to the southwards three fathom, but to the northwards 2 fathom deep. When
the land of Caen is without the point of Seynhead, and you sail then with it,
south on, then you run to the westwards of it, or along without it. Or
else, if you keep Struysaert a handspikes length without the point of
Seynhead, then you run alsoo without it. When the easter gate of New Haven
comes over the easter head, and the easter mill, sail then so on, keeping
them so, then you run in right to the northwards of the Rettires, and alsoo
you can take no hurt of the banck that lies toward Seynhead. At Habell or
New Haven men must go in at a high water, and within lie every tide dry,

The river of Seine must be sailed into upon the tide, when the most, or the
strongest of the flood is spent, then you may sail along by the land upon
your lead, until yo may see in open into the river of New Haven, when then the
souther Castle comes over the easter-head, and the mill; run then right in
upon it, but it is best to anchor half ways betwixt the Castle and Seynhead,
and there to stay for a Pilot: If there come none off, then sail from thence
right with the Castle that stands upon the head, there it is deepest water.

To sail from New Haven upwards toward Roan, is not well to be done without a
Pilot, you must go with the tide through the first travaille or banckes, which
lie from New Haven to Honfleur s. east, along by the souther-land, and from
thence along the north side of the River to Quillebeuf, being come there, you
are through the first travaille. You must alsoo be well advised, and take good
heed for the strong spring by the Normans, called La Bar, which every tide
comes on so strong with the flood, that anchors and Cables have enough to
do to hold a ship: For that and other dangers more, it is not good nor
convenient to sail up the River without a Pilot.

Two great leagues to the southwards of the River of Roan, lies a Tyde-Haven,
called Tochet, Tochet.
on the west side of the entry stands a beacon, by it you must go in, or you
may sound it in by the Eastershoare. Southwest, or southwest and by south from
the point of Seynhead, about six or seven leagues off, lie many banckes, a good
ways in sea, you may sail on both sides of them (as well to the eastwards as
to the westwards) into the Fosse of Caen, Fosse of Caen.
which lies in most south, and lies in a Baye. At the west side lies a
chindle, where men may ride within it, it is wide and broad, and sandy strand,
the East land is sand-hills, and far flat in six and seven fathom, there men
may go in, sounding with the sounding Pole.

From Seynhead to Cape de Barfleur, or Cape de Schierborough, Cape
Schierborough.
the course is West and by north nineteen leagues. About four leagues to the
eastwards of it lie the Islands of Saint Marquis, men may sail round about
them, but it is not there very clean.

A league to the westwards of the Island of Saint Marcus lies La Honge S.
Marcus La Honge
a flat Tower, to the westwards of it lies the point of Barfleur, betwixt both
is a great baye, where men may lie in six or seven fathom land-lockt for a n.
n. west wind. A northeast wind blows there open in.

From the north-poynt or C. de Barfleur (which lies northnorthwest from you,
Suncken-rock.
when you lie in the road) lies off a banck or little riffe, yet a ship may
go over it. Northeast a league and a half off from the foresaid point lies a
rock under water, where ships may not go over.

From C de Barfleur to Schierborough it is northwest and by west four leagues,
that is a little Tyde-haven. To the westwards of the point of Barfleur lie some
foul grounds, if you keep the high land of Schierborough without the Cape de
Wyck, Cape de Wyck.
you shall not come too near them.

Before Cape de Wyck is a good road in six fathom, a little to the east-wards
of the two high rocks in a sand-bay.

Before Schierborough lie some rocks, or little Islands, which are clean
round about, to the westwards of it lies a Tyde-haven, called the Fosse of
Moberille, before it on both sides lie 4 or 5 high rocks, at high water men
run through betwixt them, and so into the Haven. A great league and a half
to the westwards off it, lies Cape de Hague.

Two leagues west and by north from Cape de Hague Cape de Hague.
lies the Island Aldernay or Ornay, betwixt them goes the Race of Blanckert
through.

The Coast of England.
Road under the Nesse.
The point of Dongie nesse lies from Dover south west and by west distant 8
leagues. At the east side of the Nesse in Romans Bay, thwar, of the
Romans-Tower, is a good road for west and s. west winds: For to anchor there,
run so farte in the Bay, that the point of the Nesse be south and south and
by west from you, anchor there in about 7 or 8 fathom; you may alsoo anchor on
the west side of the Nesse, for a northeast wind, so that the point lie east
and by north from you.

For to sail in to the Camber of Rye, Camber of Rye.
coming from the west, you must keep Beachy without the point of Fairlee, and
run so toward the Nesse, and beingh come in fair by it, run in without two
Cables length along by it, unto the end of the Nesse, then edge up to the
westwards, and leave the beakons upon the starboard side, until you come
before the Castle Camber, that stands upon the souther chindle, there you may
anchor in four and five fathom: From thence along even unto the Town of Rye,
it is all set with beacons, which stand along by the east side of the Deep,
unto the Daries, which at low water fall dry. In sailing unto Rye you must leave
all the beacons unto the starboardside, and run indifferent close along by
them.

Road under the Beachy
The point of the Nesse and Beachy lie west south west, and eastnorth east
distant 7 leagues. Beachy is by the seven white Cleeves, the best known land
that a man can see any where. To the eastwards of Beachy men may anchor for
westerly winds in six or seven fathom, so that the point besouth, and south
and by west from you.

Of the Tides and Courses of the Streams.
Before Callice and Blackness, the flood falls first one quarter to the land
afterward n. n. e.

Betwixt Blackness and Bulleyn, the flood falls n. and by east by the land,
but a seaboard in the offing northeast. A south and south east moon makes
there the highest water.

Betwixt Bulleyn, Diep, and before the Sum, the flood falls first one
quarter to the land; afterward north east and by east, and the ebb southwest
and by west.

Betwixt Diep and Struysaert without the land in the Fareway, the flood falls
northeast and by east, and the ebb southwest and by west.

At New Haven, and in the River of Roan a southeast Moon makes a high water.

From Struysaert to Caen in the Fosse, the flood falls southsouthwest, and
the ebb northnortheast. Before the Haven of Caen a southsoutheast makes high
Water, within the Haven a south and by east Moon.

At Marckell, la Honge, Barfleur, Sherborough, and C. de Hague by the shore, a
south and by east moon.

From Seynhead to Barfleur, the flood falls by the and east and by north, and
the ebb west and by south. But in the channel a seaboarde the land, the flood
falls away eastnortheast, and the ebb west southwest.

At Cape de Hague by the shore, a south and by e. Moon makes high water.

In the Race off Blankert a north and by east, and south and by west Moon. The
flood falls through the Race northeast, and the ebb southwest.

In the midst betwixt the heads a south w. Moon.

At Dover a south and north Moon.

Betwixt Dover and Dongie Nesse, and likewise thware of the Nesse, a s.s.w.
Moon makes full sea.

In the Channel of Winchelsea, a south and by east Moon.

At Beachy by the shore, a s.s.e. and n.n.w. Moon.

In the Fareway thwart of it, a south and north Moon.

From Dongie Nesse to Dover, the flood falls n. e. and by east, and the ebb

Of the Depths.
Callice cliffe and the south Folland, or the point of Dover, you may see when
you are before them in 24 fat.

To the southwards of the Oldman, or Tour d' Order, lies the high land of
Eastaples, which is very good to be known, because thereabouts is no land so
high. When that is n.n.e. from you; and you be thwart of the Sum, it is there
deep 8 and 9 fathom.

Upon the land of Sum toward Diep, stand many sharp towers, and some milles
and trees, and has all along the coast a sandy strand.

Before Diep, men may see the land in twenty and two and twenty fathom.

About four leagues without Struysaert it is deep 20 fathom.

Between Diep and Seynhead stand alsoo many sharp towers, trees and houses
upon the land. Struysaert is best to be known on a great rock like a high
Tower, thwart of it in the fareway it is deep 16 and 17 fathom.

About C. de Barfleur and Sherbrough four leagues from the Island, it is deep
thirty fathom.

Barfleur is a high point, below upon the white land stands a flat Tower, two
milles, and some little houses, and to the westwards of it is more white land.

Upon Cape de Hague stands a Castle, with a little turret; a little to the
eastwards of it in the land stands a sharp Tower. Two leagues to the
eastwards off it lies Sherborough with a flat steeple.

Betwixt Winchelsea and Picardy in the midst of the Channel it is deep 26
and 27 fathom, upon such depth men may see Fayerley and the land of Dover.

Without Beachy thwart of the seven Cleeves it is deep 28 and 30 fathom.

The Race of Blanckert.
through. Aldernay or Ornay Ornay.
is about three leagues long, and lies east and west. The east end is clean,
men may sail reasonable close along by it, but the west end is very foul:
There lie some little Islands close by the west end, being passed them, men may
sail toward Iarsey without any fear.

To the southwards of the foresaid little Islands at the west end lies of a
ledge of rocks within it, on the south side it is clean, except at the south
point, that is also foul. He that will anchor on the south side of Ornay,
must be mindful thereof, and anchor a little to the eastwards of the Tydehaven.

From the west end of Ornay lies a great multitude of rocks west and by
north, and westnorthwest off three leagues into the sea.

Upon the outtermost and westermost end, lies a great high rock with many
other smaller rocks about it. Half ways betwixt this great rock and Ornay
lies another great rock, but not so high as the foresaid westermost, from it
lie off a multitude of rokes toward the outermost, which fall dry at low
water, but at high water many lie under water. These two great rocks are
called by the French Les Casquettes, and by the Dutch the Kiskassen, and by the
English the Caskets. Catskets.
Close by the west end of Ornay, toward the Caskets, lie other two great ranes
of rocks, called the Barroches. Barroches


From the east point of Ornay to the east end of Garnesey (about to the
southwards of Ornay) the course is westsouthwest, 9 leagues; but from the
Caskets to the west end of Garnsey southwest and by south, 6 leagues.

Road under Garnsey.
If you will anchor under Garnsey (coming from the Caskets) then run on to
the northeast point of Garnsey, and so far to the eastwards of it, until you
get sight of the castle that stands upon the rock on the east side of
Garnsey. Or if you come about to the westwards of the Caskets, then go on
southeast, or somewhat more southerly, until the northeast point of Garnsey be
south and by west from you, sail then toward it, till you shall come in sight
of that foresaid castle upon the rock. Bring that over the south point of
Garnsey, and sail in upon that mark, betwixt the Island Arem or Harm; and
Garnsey, until you come by the foresaid Castle, betwixt these Islands it is on
both sides full of rocks, where of you must take good heed, especially on the
larboard side toward Arem, when you are come by the castle, you may anchor
within or without it, where you please, without the Castle in 12 or 13 fathom,
or within the Castle) that is betwixt the Castle and Garnsey) in six or seven
fathom at low water, It does flow there six or seven fathom up and down, which
men must reckon upon.

Under the south side of Garnsey men may ride for northwest, north, and
northeast winds. If you come from the west, or from the Caskets, you must
run close about by the southwest point, called C. de Gruse; and along by
the south side of the Island, well half ways the Island, and anchor there
where you think good, in eighteen or nineteen fathom. If the wind shift to the
southwest, or to the westsouthwest, then you may run about by the south point
unto the foresaid Castle* and anchor there either without or within it, as here
before is said. From the aforesaid south point, lies off a little ledge of
rocks, where of some rocks lie above, and some under water, these you must
avoid when you sail about by it.

South and by west, and southsouthwest about eight leagues from Garnsey lies a
great ledge of rocks, more then a league great, called Rockeduves. Rockeduves.


About 2 leagues southeast from Garnsey lies the Island Sarck, Sarck.
there men may anchor round about it in five and twenty, six and twenty, and
seven and twenty fathom. From the north end lie of some Rocks, where of some
lie above, and some under water. At the south end hereof lie alsoo some rocks,
but all above water.

Betwixt Garnsey and Sarck lie two other little Islands, Arck and Arem, Arck,
and Arem.
or Harm, there men may sail through betwixt them.

The Island Iarsey from Garnsey southeast distant 7 leagues, round about this
Island are good roades at diverse places. All along the north side men may
anchor in 10 and 11 fathom. At the same north side, somewhat within the west
point, lie some great rocks, a good ways of from the shore, called the Pater
nosters, Pater noster.
or Pierreleg. At the southwest point lie many rocks which lie of a great
ways into the sea, to the northwards of them, to wit, betwixt them and the
westermost point, at the west side of Iarsey men may anchor at diverse place in
ten, eleven and twelve fathom. At the south side of Iarsey is also a good road
for a northwest and w. n. w. Winds. At the east side lies Saint Catherines
baye, S. Catherines Bay
there is alsoo very good road for westerly winds.

The west end of Iarsey and Saint Maloes, or the Island Sisember before S.
Maloes lie south and by east, and north and by west, eight or nine leagues
asunder. About half way betwixt both right in the fareway, lie a great number
of high rocks together, which contain in circuit in sailing about, seven or
eight leagues, Mankies Rocks.
called the Mankierrs, they lie far toward Iarsey, some above and many under
water, so that it is not without great danger to run through betwixt Iarsey
and the Mankiers.

When men will sail through the Race of Blanckaert, bound for S. Maloes, they
run commonly through betwixt Sarck and Iarsey, may alsoo sail to the eastwards
of all the Islands and shoals along the coast of Normandy, toward S. Maloes
in manner as follows.

When men come a little past the C. Voorha, they shall meet (thwart of the
Island Iarsey) with three or four high rocks, called Le Beuf, Le Beuf.
men may run to the westwards of them, and so through betwixt them and the
Island Iarsey, or else to the eastwards of them along by the mayn land, even
as they will, toward the riffe of Mortefaim, that lies upon the coast of
Normandy southsoutheast, 8 leagues from Cape de Voorha.

Over against, or thwart of the Riffe of Mortefaim, lies a rane of rocks
lying east and west more then a league in length, called Beufkin, Beufkin.
at the east end many of them lie above, and at the west end most of them lie
under water. Men must sail through betwixt them and the riffe of Mortefaim
that are bound for Granville.

Betwixt the foresaid rocks Beuf and Beufkin, lies another great rane of
rocks, called Eckerof, Eckero^
which lie of from the southeast point of Iarsey toward Granville; you must
leave all these rocks on the starboardside, and run along to the eastwards
of them.

From the riffe of Mortefaim to Granville, the course is southsoutheast, and
from bufkin southeast 4 leagues.

Cape de Voorha and Granville G^anville.
are two points that lie without the other land. About the south point of
Granville lie two or three little rocks; along by them men must run in within
a Pier or head, where the ships lie dry at low water. Betwixt cape de Hague,
and Granville men may see upon the land many little houses, mills, and trees,
as they sail along by it. A little to the southwards of the riffe Mortefaim
stands a Church with two steeples, called Quotanse. All along this whole
coast is every where good anchorage in 6 or seven Fathom, especially a little
to the southwards of Cape de Hague.

About two leagues west from the point of Granville lies another great rane of
rocks two great leagues long, lying east and west, called La Shausee, La
Shausee
betwixt them and the point of Granville men must sail through that are bound
for Concalle or S. Maloes.

About five leagues to the southwards of Granville, in a great baye, lies an
Island before the river of Avrantie about a league without the land, called
Mount de S. Michiel, Mount de S. Michiel
upon it lies a Castle, or little town, called S. Michiel, with a high Tower
which men may see at sea. This Bay is to the southwards of Granville, within
the rocks of Concalle, very flat and rising ground, from thirteen, ten,
eight, six and four fathom to one fathom, so that at low water the Bay
falls so far dry, that from the strand men see no sea nor water.

From Granville to the point of Concalle, Concalle.
the course is southwest 5 leagues, from that eastwards lie three rocks, under
which men may anchor in ten fathom. For to sail to the town men must run in
betwixt the point and the foresaid rocks. It is betwixt them both eight and
nine fathom deep. Before the town it is shoaler water. To the north-wards of
the Town lie other two rocks, there men may also anchor under in 5 and 6
fathom water.

From the outermost rocks by the point of Concalle until you come before S.
Maloes, the course is west, and west and by south 5 leagues.

Before the haven of S. Maloes, lies an Island, called Sisember, S. Maloes
Sisember.
upon the west end thereof stands a mill, and upon the east end a church with
some little houses being a Friery, coming out of the sea, you can but even
scarce see the Church, but being within the Island you may see it better,
because it stands on the southside of the Island. A great shot of a east
piece to the eastwards of Sisember lies a great high rock, called the
Meuwstone: Meuwstone.
betwixt them and Sisember it is all full of rocks and stones, which at high
water lie most under water: there is a little channel betwixt them both, which
the French men use with their small shipping, through betwixt the rocks, but
is not to be used with great shipping, neither by them that are not very well
acquainted with it.

Betwixt the Meuwstone, and some other rocks to the eastwards off it, lies in
a channel south and south and by east, called la Congie. La Congie.
For to sail in there you must run in close aboard to the eastwards of the
Meuwstone, southeast and by east right in with the town, until you be gotten
in two third parts of the distance (between the Meuwstone and the Town) from
the Meuwstone, and are one third part of the distance from the Town, that is
when the Meuwstone is twice so far from you as the Town, then you shall see by
the northwest point of the Town two great rocks, about a cast piece shot from
the foresaid point; upon each rock stands a little house, the outermost is
the smallest, and is called the little Be, the nearest to the Town is the
greatest, and is called the great Be, The l^ttle and great Be.
sail then toward them, and run in about them within a cables length of them,
but keep that course so long, until that the little Tower (that stands a
little to the southwards of the town upon the point) come over the tower of
Bore a little to the eastwards of Saledoor, keep them one over the other, and
sail so in, unto the south end of the town, where the mils do stand, then
you shall see there upon the rocks two beacons, run betwixt them through at
high water, until you come within the town, at the eastside, the ships lie
moored with sour cables, dry at low water, two fast on the town, and two upon
the sand. Betwixt these two foresaid beacons, to the southwards of the town,
and thereabouts, is the ground sharp, rockie and stony, therefore men must
take heed not to stay there at low water, or to ground there, but within on the
east side of the town it is clean sandy ground, there may the ships lie a
ground without danger.

A little within, or to the southwards of the foresaid rock the little Be, men
may anchor in five or 6 fathom water at low water, so that the towet of Bore
comes little to the eastwards of the little Tower upon the point to the
southwards of the Town, that road is called by the French La Ranse, The Road La
Ranse.
there men commonly first anchor, and stay for high water, for to go in about
to the southwards of the Town. It sloweth here at S. Maloes, and thereabouts,
seven fathom up and down with an ordinary tide.

From the west end of Sisember, lie off alsoo a great many rocks along to the
westwards, more then a great shot off a cast piece, at the end of them goes in
the Wester-channell of S. Maloes, east and by north in. For to sail in there,
you must look out for a sharp little Tower, that lies somewhat to the
northwards or to the eastwards of S. Maloes, within the land called Pellemy,
when you have brought that east and by north from you, then you shall see upon
the shore right against it, a great black rock, which for Blackenesse shows
it self without all the other rocks thereabouts, and thereby is very easy to
be known: Bring that rock and the foresaid little Tower one to the other and
sail so right in until you come thwart of the Island Sisember, or else that
the little Tower (upon the point to the southwards of the Town) come to the
Tower of Bore, to the eastwards of Saledoor, sail then toward the road of
La-Ranse to the southwards of the little Be; or else if it be high water, you
may run in upon the marks, and then in about to the southwards of the Town,
as here before is said.

When you sail into this western channel, you shall leave on the starboard
side a high rock (called the Schoorsteen) with more other rocks to the
westwards of it, which at high water are most of them over flowne. On the north
side, that is on the larboard side, lie alsoo many rocks, whereof many of them
are overflowne at high water, and also many remain above water.

Yet a southern channel More, a Southern channel.
lies in by the land to the southwards of the rock of S. Antony, upon marks
that men may see a stearne the ship, but it is not used but with small ships.

About half ways betwixt the western channel of S. Maloes, and C. de
Farela, lies a stony banck Stony banck.
under water. A little to the westwards of C. de Farela, lies a great rock.
When you will sail from C. de Farela toward S. Maloes, and that you keep the
foresaid rock right upon the point of Farela, you shall so (without fail)
sail upon the Stone-banck: but if you keep the rock hidden under or behind the
point, then you shall sail along to the southwards of it. Or else if you
keep it without the point (so that you may see through betwixt it and the
point) then you shall sail along to the northwards of it. The foresaid rock
is a good mark for to know Cape de Farela by.

S. MALOES.

De Haven van S. Malo



Four leagues west from S. Maloes lies a great Sandbay, where men may lie
landlockt for all winds: Men use to anchor within a great rock, right against
a mill and some trees.

About two leagues northwest from that Sand-bay lies the Cape de Farela,
Farela.
which is alsoo called Cape de Late, after the Castle de Late, that stands to
the eastwardes off the point, there is a good Road for west and southwest
winds.

Two great leagues northwest from the entry of the Haven of S. Maloes, lies
the Oysterbanck, ^yster^^nck.
there under it men may anchor in 6 or 7 fathom.

To the westwardes of Cape de Farela unto the northend of the Island Briack,
Briack.
the course is west and by north nine or ten leagues. Two leagues from the land
west from the Cape lies a great rane of rocks above water. Between the
foresaid Cape and the Island Briack lie the Havens or Rivers of S. Brieux ^
Brieux.
and S. Benit. S. Benit


The Island Briack is two leagues long, and lies southsouthwest and
northnortheast, when you come from the east, you shall see two mills upon it,
and betwixt them a high round hill, with a little house upon it: you may sail
round about this Island, and may make roades on every side where you will,
although round about it here and there lie some rocks, yet it is all over good
anchor-ground. A good ways off from the northeast point lies a rock, called
Souffe, and at the north end lies a ledge of rocks under water, where of you
must take heed.

A great league westsouthwest from Briack, three or four leagues a seaboard
the land, lie the out-rockes, called the Pickeles, men may sail round about
them also, but to the eastwards of them toward the main land, lie many
suncken rocks.

Four leagues to the westwards of Briack lies the Port Blanck upon a great
river, called Lantrilliers, Portblank Lantrilliers seven Isles.
to the eastwards of this haven lie off many out-rockes.

To the westwards of Port Blanck, lie the Sept Isles, or seven Islands, lying
from the Pickels distant five leagues east and west. A league to the
southwardes of them lies the Green land, there you may ride round about it.
Between the seven Islands you may not sail through, but to the southwards of
them, betwixt them and the Green Island Green Island.
goes a broad channel through. From the eastermost Island lies off a foul
riffe to the southwards, upon the outermost end of that riffe lies a rock, as
a good mark for to sail about the riffe. Northwest from the west end of the
seven Islands, lies alsoo a suncken rock, which at low water may be seen. Men
may alsoo sail along by the coast from Port Blanck, within to the
southwardes of the Green Island, and come out again into the sea to the
westwards: from thence northwest off into the sea, lie the Triacle Pots,
Triacle. Pots.
these are great fear full out-rockes, which lie spread wide and broad
westsouthwest from the seven Islands, and four or five leagues a seaboard the
land.

Betwixt the Triacle Pots and the seven Islands lies the River of Laminoe, R.
Laminoe.
to the westwardes of the Green Island: For to sail in there, men must take
good heed of the northeast point, which is foul.

Thwart of the seven Islands, upon the maine land, stands a Church with a
high steeple, called Our Lady of the Clearness, thereby men may know them.

Thwart of the Triacle Pots stands alsoo a high Tower, thereby men may know
when they are near them, but it must be very clear weather before men can
well discern it upon the land.

He that comes by night or dark weather from the Fourne, or Ushant, and is
bound to Saint Maloes, let him not go with a southerly wind, to the
eastwardes of east-northeast, or northeast and by east with a westerly wind,
so long until he has the length of the Triacle Pots, that they be on his
broad side. The flood falls southeast within the Triacle Pots and the seven
Islands, and should by night easily draw a ship toward them. By day, or when
there is sight, there is no such danger.

Within the Triacle Pots lies the tide haven of Saint John de Doy, two leagues
to the westwards of the Green Island, and two leagues to the eastwards of
Morlions, men may sail from thence through the rocks unto Morlions, and
anchor in five and six fathom at low water.

To the westwards of the Triacle Pots lies a great rock, the eastern entry of
Morlions Morlions.
lies from it southwest and by south distant two leagues, but the western
entry lies from it westsouthwest and west and by south four or five loagues,
that goes in by a great long ragged rock. This entry men may sail in south,
and south and by west, unto the castle of Morlaix; Morlaix.
being about the castle they may run through the rocks again to the eastwards,
and run out again at the eastern entry northnortheast, and north and by
east into sea, according as the tide shall be, the flood comes there out of
the northwest.

If a man would go from Morlaix to Morlions, he may go on east through the
rocks, and so sail to it: It is all broken land, and there remains at low
water five fathom depth.

If you are bound to S. Paul de Lion, S. Paul de Lion.
you must run right with the great rock, with the two horns or Sadle, and so
close along by it: being past it, edge to the land upon the strand lies a
village, called Plempoll, sail right with it, and along by it, to the
eastwards of it goes in the river. These are all tyde-havens, but betwixt the
rocks of the Morlions, and the Islands Bay, it is at low water deep enough
for to save a ship.

The land of S. Paul de Lion is double land, upon S. Paul's Church stand two
sharp steeples. The Island Isle de Bas, lies thwart before it, upon it
stands two stakes, to see to a far off like milles. Upon the east end of
that Island lies a very high ragged rock, when you are to the eastwards of
this rock, you shall see two sharp steeples a little one from the other, these
are the steeples of Plempolle: you may also then see the Castle of Morlaix,
lying southeast from you, upon a high rock.

The foresaid outermost long ragged rock of Morlaix, lies from the top of the
Island Isle de Bas, Isle de Bas
east and east and by south three or four leagues. Men may sail along by
the maine land within and through these rocks, until they come to the seven
Islands, they are all great bays, where inmost places is good anchor ground.

Five great leagues north and by east of Isle Bas and southwest and by west 27
leagues, from the Caskets, lies a dangerous rock or Cliffe called Roche
Blanch, Roche Blanch.
and lies from seven Islands westnorthwest 9 leagues.

Within the Isle de Bas lies the town of Roskow, Roskow.
you may sail into the haven of Roskow on both sides of the Island.

For to sail into the eastern channel, when you are passed by the high rock
with the saddle, or two horns called Le Taureau, and come by the land, betwixt
the east point of the Island, and the point of the maine land over against it,
you must sail still keeping the middle of the channel. It is in this channel
7 and eight fathom deep. Being come within the point of the Island, you must
run in about by it, west and by south, and west on until you come about
half ways within the Island, and anchor there in eight or nine fathom. And
then Roskow shall lie south and south and by east from you.

If you will sail into the western channel* you shall see to the westwards
of it, close by the maine land two great long rocks. From the point of the
maine land, a little to the eastwards of the eastermost long rock, lies of a
riffe from the land, which makes the west side of the channel, you must run
in southeast betwixt that riffe and the west point of the Island, and when you
come within the point of the Island, you must edge up northeast unto the
midst of the Island, and anchor there as here before is said.

From Isle de Bas along to the Fourne or Ushant lies the coast westsouthwest
16 leagues.

From the Island Isle de Bas unto the Fourne, (the outermost or westermost end
of the maine land of Britaigne) the course is westsouthwest, and west and by
south thirteen leagues. About half ways betwixt them both lies Obbevrack,
or Abberwrack.

About a league northwest without the rocks of Obbevracke or Abberwracke
Abberwrack.
lies a rane of Rocks under water. They that by night will sail or turn to
windwards from the Fourne or toward the Fourn, The Fourn.
let them not come thereabouts nearer the land then in 45 fathom.

A league to the eastwards of the Fourne, and all along the coast even unto
the Fourne, lie many long black ragged Rocks, in many places appearing like
Villages, these are called the Ovens, within them on the maine land (which is
not very high) men shall see (sailing along by them) many white sand-bayes,
and here and there some little houses, whereby the foresaid land thereabout is
very easy to be known.

The Fourne and Ushant Ushant.
lie westsouthwest and eastnortheast distant two great leagues. Ushant shows
it felfe at sea at the south-end low, and at the north-end going up sloaping,
upon the midst of it stands a little flat Tower, by which marks it is good
to be known.

Of the Tides and Courses of the streams,
At Cape de Hague by the shore, a south and by e^ moon makes high water.

In the Race of Blanckert a north and by east, and south and by west moon. The
flood falls through the Race northeast, and the ebb southwest.

In the Islands also a north and by east, and south and by west moon makes a
full sea. Men cannot well reckon the tides there: because they have diverse
courses about the Islands, but for the most part northeast and by north. A
quarter of the tide, the flood falls thwart into the Caskets.

In Garnsey a north and by east, and south and by west moon makes full sea.

At Concalle and Granville a westnorthwest moon.

At S. Maloes an east and west moon makes high water.

The flood falls in there at the western channel, and goes out again at
the eastern channel, men must reckon there upon when they will sail into
these channels.

From the Island Briack in the bay of Benit, the flood falls southeast, but
in the fareway eastsoutheast, and westnorthwest.

At the east side of the Island Briack in the road southsoutheast. An east and
west moon makes there the highest water.

Betwixt the Island Briack and Garnesey, a westsouthwest moon makes full sea,
the flood runs there eastsoutheast, and the ebb westnorthwest.

On the coast, and within the Caskets, the tide runs continually against the
Sun, so that it is there never still water.

Betwixt Sept Isles, or the seven Islands, and Garnsey in the fareway, a
westsouthwest moon makes full sea.

Betwixt Briack and the seven Islands, an east and by north, and west and by
south moon makes full sea. The flood fulleth there east and east and by south.

Betwixt the seven Islands and the outer rocks of Morlions, the flood falls
in south east within the Triacle Pots toward the Green-Island, but in the
fareway in the offing, east and east and by north.

At Morlaix and S. Paul's a west and by south Moon; makes the highest water,
but in the fareway in the offing thwart of it, a southwest and by west, and
westsouthwest Moon.

At the Isle de Bas makes high water a west and by south Moon.

In the fareway there in the offing, the flood falls e. n. e. and the ebb w.
s. w. and so likewise from thence all along the coast of Bretaigne, unto the
Fourne or Ushant.

At Abberwrack an e. n. e. and w. s. w. moon makes full sea without Ushant a
westsouthwest, and eastnortheast moon, and within the Trade a s. w. and by w.
moon makes full-sea.

Of the Depths about these places, and in what depths men may see the land.
Upon Cape de Hague stands a Castle, with a little turret; a little to the
eastwards of it in the land stands a sharp Tower. Two leagues to the
eastwards off it lies Sherborough with a flat steeple.

The Island Ornay is upon the west end high with a steep going down point: The
east end is hilly, or with hommocks, but lower then the west end, in sailing by
it, men may see upon it a Tower or two with some mills. Upon the north side of
the Island lies a white hill like a sand hill.

To the northwards of the Caskets, two leagues from land it is deep 35 and 40
fathom.

Betwixt the Caskets and Garnesey it is 35 and 40 fathom deep, most all stony
ground.

Northwest about four leagues from Garnesey is a pit where it is 80 or 90

Betwixt Ornay and Iarsey it is deep 20 and 25 fathom.

In the fareway of Jarsey, Rockduve and the Island Briack, it is deep 20 and 25
and 30 fathom.

About the Triacle Pots along the coast it is 45 and 50 fathom deep, in such
depths men may see the land thereabouts. By night it is not good to come nearer
that coast and the seven Islands, then in 45 fathom.

Thwart of S. Paul de Lion, and the Isle of Bas, five leagues from the land it
is deep 45 and 50 fathom.

Thwart of Abberwrack 5 leagues from the land, it is deep 50 and 55 fathom.

The Backovens, or the land of the Fourne, men may see in 50 fathom.

Ushant being about south from you, you may see in 50 fathom.

The third Demonstration. Wherein Are delineated the Coasts of England, from
Beachy to Port-land.
TO the Westwards of the point of Beachy, thwart of the west end of the 7
Cleeves, right against the Chindle, where men run along by into new Haven,
men may alsoo anchor in 7. 8 or 9 fathom.

A league and a half to the eastwards of the point of Beachy, nearest e. n e.
from the point lies a little sand, upon which there is at low Water and
spring-tydes scarce two fathom.

At the west end of the seven Cleeves lies the River of Cuckmer-Haven, or
New Haven, New Haven.
which has two entries, the westermost entry lies in by the west land, but is
not to be used, but only with very small shipping, it falls altogether dry,
the eastermost is commonly the best, and lies northwest and by west in, there
is at high water with a common tide not more then seven, and with a
spring-tyde, 14 or 15 foot water; within, the ships lie every tide dry: But
before the village they remain a float, there they moore with four cables
fast on 2 green shoares. Upon these entries men cannot well make any reckoning,
they keep no certain depth, when it blows a storm out of the south, they
are oftentimes cast too with a chindle, and opened again with a freshut.

Shorum.
Shorum is a tyde-haven, where is at high water and spring-tydes 18 foot water,
but at low water there remains no more then 3 foot water, so that then it
flows 15 foot up and down. With a common tide at high water there is 12 foot
and at low water 3 foot depth. The towin Shorum lies a little English mile
within the haven, ships (that draw but 8 or 9 foot water) can lie a float a
little beneath the town at low water, or else they lie dry every where.

When you come from the eastwards from Beachy or New Haven along by the shore,
you may see open into the Haven, before you come thwart of it: But coming from
the westward, you shall not see it open before you come right before it,
because the west point lies somewhat further out then the east point. From the
west point runs off a little tail, but at high water you may run in
along over it, otherwise you must run in by the east shore. Upon the east
point stand 2 beacons, which you must bring one in the other, and run in so
right with them until you come by the n. shore, and then in along by the
foresaid north shore.

At Shorum sometimes there are builded many great ships of 3 or 400 tons.

About six leagues to the westwards of New Haven lies Arundell, Arundell.
a tyde-haven, where a ship may go in at half Flood, you must go in thereby
the west land north east in. In the entry it is two, and betwixt the two lands
3 fathom deep at high water: But within the Haven remains at low water 4 and
5 fathom: There you must anchor before the village.

Five leagues west s. w from Arundell, and 13 leagues west and by south
somewhat westerly from Beachy, lie the bancks or shoals of the Owers Owers.
under water, a great league and a half a seaboard the land.

About 2 leagues e. n. e somewhat easterly from the south side of the Owers,
and two little leagues south from Arundell lies a shoale of rocks and
chindles, called East-borough-head, Eastborough-head.
as great as an aker of land, which falls (at low watet and springtide) dry,
otherwise it comes not above water, close to it, it is 15 fat. deep. They
that sail off from the haven of Shorum, and are bound to the westwards, must
not go more westerly then s.s.w, until they come in 18 fathom, before they set
their course more westerly, for fear of this shoale. About an English mile n.
w. from this foresaid shoale, lies alsoo a sunken rock, whereupon at low water
it is no more then 5 or 6 foot water.

About half ways, betwixt Arundell and Selsey, runs of a ledge of Rocks
thwart to the southwards from the shore, obut an English mile and a half into
the sea, called the Bogners, whereof some of the rocks fall dry at low water,
but the outermost are always under water.

The shoals or banks of the Owers, The Owers.
lie about 4 leagues to the eastwards of Wight, and lie of a league and a half
from the land, thwart of them stands a tower in the land, when that is north
north west from you, then are you thwart of the southermost part of the shoale;
And if you keep the Culver cliffe Culver-cliffe.
of Wight west and by north, and west northwest from you, coming either De
Custen van ENGELANDT, tusschen Fierley en Poortlant: ^ock hoese van Ornay
gelegen zyn.
from the east or from the west, you can take no hurt of the Owers, you may run
along by them in twelve fathom upon your lead, without danger. If you sail
away from the east end of Wight, east and by north, and east north east, you
shall run in 12 fathom along over the east end of them. He that is there well
acquainted, may also sail to the northwards of them, through between the land
and the Owers.

Betwixt the Owers and Portsmouth goes in a great sound or haven, within lies
the town of Chichester. Chichester.


On both sides of the Island Wight men may sail within it, and there come to
anchor either under S. Ellens or before Newport where they will.

For to sail into the Eastwards of Wight you must bring the eastern castle
that lies to the eastwards of Portsmouth over the Lyme-kilne (that is, a white
spot in the land to the northwards of that castle) and keep them so one over
the other, until that the Culver cliffe come, within or under the northeast
point of Wight. Then bring the Lyme-kilne over the east end of Portsmouth, and
keep them so until that the castle to the westwards of Portsmouth come to
the wood: Thus doing you shall come near neither plate nor sand, to take any
hurt of them, and you shall come so by little and little before S. Ellens
Church. When the Church comes two ships lengths within the red point, then
you shall not come too near the riffe at the point. Or-else if you cannot see
the Lyme-kilne, then keep the Castle to the westwards of the Culver cliffe,
until that S. Ellens Church comes a ships length without the point of the
Island, go then boldy northwest in, and you shall not come too near the
riffe; And then bring the square Tower betwixt the east end of Portsmouth, and
the Castle: When the Castle to the westwards of Portsmouth comes to the east
side of the Wood, then you shall not (as here before is said) come too near
either the plate or the sand, to take any hurt of them.

When the eastermost white spot stands a ships length to the westwards of the
Castle, then you are to the eastwards of the riffe, and when the Culver cliffe
is covered or hidden behind the, n. e. point of the Island, the^ are you also
within the riffe. The marks of the little plate Marks of the plate.
are these there stands a square tower within the land, and a castle on the
water side to the eastwards of Portsmouth, thwart from it lies the foresaid
Lime-kilne: when that comes to the eastwards of the foresaid Castle, so that
you may even see through betwixt them both, the are you upon the little plate
which at low water is not deeper then 10 foot: then stands the castle to the
westwards of Portsmouth at the west side of the Wood. But when the foresaid
square tower comes to the west side to the foot of the Castle and the Castle
by west Portsmouth to the west side of the Wood, there it is deep at low water
upon the little plat 12 foot.

When the square Tower stands betwixt the east end of Portsmouth, and the
Castle even betwixt the Lyme-pit and the Tower, and the Castle by west
Portsmouth in the west side of the Wood, there it is at high water, ten
fathom deep.

When Saint Ellens Church lies southwest and by west from you, then lies the
southeast end of the plate northeast and by north from you, and the west end
north and by east.

From the point of the road of Newport eastwards lies abroad sand along the
shoale, called No mans-land, No mans-land
which falls almost dry at low water, it is so steep, that half a cables
length off from it, it is twelve fathom deep: upon the high land of Wight
thereabouts stand two or three mills. If you come near the shore, that the
foresaid mills be hidden behind the foresaid high land, you shall not miss
to come a ground against that foresaid sand, but so long as you can see these
mills you shall go clear of it.

The Road of the Cowes is the best Road in Wight. Over against, betwixt that
and Calshot Castle, lies a hard sand nearest the north shore, lying from
thence to the westwards along the fareway, almost so far as thwart of
Newton, called the Brambles: The Brambles.
at low water and spring-tydes it falls almost dry, and then the sea breaks
much upon it: to the northwards of it goes alsoo a channel through, but it is
not to be used, but with small shipping.

For to sail in at the west end of Wight, you must run right in with the
Needles, For to sail in at the Needles.
(they are high sharp Rocks as Masts lying at the West end of Wight) bring
then the innermost point of Wight, or the Castle that stands upon the chindle
over against that point, called Hus castle a little without, or to the
northwards of the Needles, sail in there upon, until you come to the Needles,
leave them then on the starboard side of you, and run in within a cables length
along by them for to avoid the bancks which lie off from the chindle to the
northwards of the Needles, of the west end of Wight almost to the Needles.
Betwixt the bancks called the Swingels, and the Needles, it is not very broad,
and at low water 5 fathom deep. When you sail in here, you must cast your
tides well. The fore-flood falls strong upon the bancks. When you are then
come within the Needles, then edge a little more off from the shore unto Hus
Castle that stands upon the Chindle, for to avoid some Rocks which lie
along by the Island under water. Being come within the Castle or Chindle,
there it is wide and broad, leave two third parts of the channel on the
larboard side, and one third part on the starboard side, sail so in until
you come before the village Newton, and anchor there in nine or ten fathom, or
else sail forth (if you will) about the point of the Cowes, and anchor there
before the haven of Newport in ten or twelve fathom, there is the best Road,
and the best lying of all the Roades in Wight. The Haven or Road before
Newport lies from the foresaid Hus Castle upon the Chindle northeast and by
east, and eastnortheast about two leagues asunder.

From the Needles of Wight west and by south about three leagues, lies the
point of Saint Albons-land, called Peverell point, Peverel point.
from it lie off some little Rocks to the eastwards. A little too the
northwards of that point is a Bay, called the Bay of Sandwitch, Sandwitch Bay
there is a good road for them that are bound to the Westwards; If you will go
to ride there coming from the westwards, you may take the sounding of Saint
Albons land, and run aboard the point in four or five fathom at a half
flood, and you shall take no hurt of those little rocks. Being gotten about the
point, edge by it up to the westwards toward Sandwitch. A little to the
northwards of Sandwitch in the Baye, lies a round Hommock, and thwart of it
somewhat within the land stands a mil; bring that mill to the south side of
the round Hommock, and sail so in until you come in four or three fathom,
and anchor there so deep or shoale as you will, there it is good lying for
southwest winds.

A little league north and by east from the foresaid point, right west from the
Needles of Wight, lies another point, called Handfast point, Handfast point.
to the northwards of it lies a lit^^e Town, called Studland, before it is
alsoo a good road. Upon the outermost part of that point, is a hole through
the land, where men may see through, and a little without the point stands a
high steep rock like a Mast, almost like the Needle at the west end of
Wight. For to come to ride before Studland: Studland.
you must sail about the second point, with the hole or the steep rock, in
four or five fathom, and go in westnorthwest toward Studland: a little to
the southwards of it lies a little valley, bring that westsouthwest from you,
and go toward the shore, in four or three fathom and a half, there is the
best road, and lying there, you may see the foresaid hole in the point.

A league to the northwards of that foresaid point with the hole, lies the
haven of Poole, Poole.
for to fail in there, coming about the foresaid second point with the steep
rock, you must go on northwest, or somewhat more northerly, and then you shall
see right a head of you, a high flat hill, which stands higher then any other
land thereabouts, keep that betwixt the two shoares, and run in so right with
it. If you must turn toe and again, then spare not to use your lead, and
run not further over to the westwards, then that the flat hill come to the
west-land, so soon as it begins (as it were) to touch it, you must cast
about, or else you should be fast aground: And after you have cast about, run
not further over to the eastwards, then that the foresaid high flat hill
comes even to the east sand-hill, which is a high, gray, and sharp sand-hill,
lying at the East side. If you keep these foresaid marks in this manner, you
shall have there going in at half flood water enough, there remains upon the
shoalest at low water, ten and eleven foot, but it flows there no more then
five foot up and down. It flows there twice in a tide. A southeast and
northwest Moon makes there full sea: Also a south and by east and north and
by west Moon once more, that comes to pass by reason of the sore-ebbe that
comes out of Wight. When you come within the entry, go then northnortheast
on, and keep the beacons that stand on the east land on the starboard from
you, and run indifferent close along by them. The shoares are on both sides
steep, and the channel is not wide, without the channel it is shoale or
flat. This is Pilots water.

From the west end of Wight to the point of Portland, Portland.
the course is westsouthwest, eleven leagues, but from Dunnose, the southwest
point of Wight, west and by south thirteen leagues.

Road under Portland.
If you will go to anchor under Portland (coming from the west, then come
within two cables length, or a shot of a cast piece about by the point of
Portland, and being come about the second point, edge up to the westwards
until you come before the castle, and anchor there in 7. 8. 9. 10. or 11.
fathom, so that the point of Portland do lie south and by east, and
southsoutheast from you, there you shall lie landlockt for a south and south
and by east wind. With a southwest and a s.s.w. wind, men must be very
mindful of terrible rippeling of the race of Portland, which begins a
little to the westwards of Portland, and ends a little to the westwards of S.
Albons. The ground in that race is also very uneven, and shoale, sometimes
seven, otherwhiles ten, and also fifteen fathom deep.

About a league to the northwards of the road of Portland lies a little Town,
called Waymouth, Waymouth.
with a tyde-haven, before it men may anchor in four or five fathom.

The fourth Demonstration. Wherein Are Showed the Coasts of England, from
Port-land to the Lizard.
FRom Portland to Exmouth, the course is westnorthwest thirteen leagues;
betwixt them both lies a little Island close by the land called Cob. I. Cob.
Befote Exmouth men may ride (at the south end of the Chindle, which lies
before the haven) in seven or eight fathom, so that the rocks of Tomanstones
do come to lie south and south and by east from you, there it is good ground,
and landlockt for a south wind.

Five leagues south, and south and by west from Exmouth lies Torbay, Torbay
and lies from Portland west, and west and by south distant thirteen leagues.

TORBAY.


For to go into the road of Torbay, you must bring the West point south and
by east, and southsoutheast from you and anchor there in 7 or 8 fathom, you
shall lie land-lockt for south and southwest winds. At the northeast side of
the bay is alsoo a tyde-haven, before it, it is good anchor ground in four or
five fathom, according as you will lie near or far from the shore.

Three or four leagues southwards, or to the westwards of Torbay, lies the
Haven of Dartmouth, Dart^outh.
which has a narrow entry, lying in betwixt two high lands, upon each side of
the Haven stands a little Castle, in time of wars they were wont to shut it
over with a chain, on the Westside stands a little Church on the high land.
For to sail in there coming from the Steart or from the westwards you must
run in along by the wester-land, so far to the eastwards until you bring
the kay of the village (that lies on the east side of the haven) in the
midst of the entry of the Haven, and sail so in, keeping the midst of the
Haven betwixt the two lands, and you must be very ready with the boat (if
there should come any sore flangs from of the high land) for to row in. Being
come in, edge over to the west side, before the Brewhouse, and anchor there in
ten or twelve fathom, or before the village on the east side where you please.

At the east side of the Range lies a suncken Rock, the marks for to avoid it
are these. To the eastwards of Dartmouth is a red point, which below by the
water is black, and in the red lies a white stone, when the white stone
comes over the black point, then are you thwart of the suncken rock, but if
you see the kay of the village and do as before is said, then you shall not
come too near that suncken rock to take any hurt of it.

Betwixt Dartmouth and the Steart, nearest to Dartmouth stands a spire
steeple indifferent high and white, called Tackman, that is a very good mark
to know the haven of Dartmouth by.

The Steart Steart.
lies from Dartmouth southwest distant three leagues. Under the point of the
Steart at the east side is a good road for westerly winds, betwixt the little
Church that stands upon the high land, and the point of the Steart in ten
or eleven fathom, so that the point lie southwest from you.

A little to the eastwards of the westermost point of the Steart lies a haven,
called Salkom, Salkom
when you come from the west, it shows it self open, the west side of it is
ragged and the east side goes sloping down, close to the westpoynt lies a
rock, or a rane of rocks, therefore you must give it a good birth, and leave
the rocks on the larboard side: Further, you may see all breaks that can do
you hurt. Being come within the point, you can take no hurt of either of both
shoares. Upon the bar or shoals of the entry, remains at low water with a
spring-tyde, not less then eleven foot water, and again within it is at least
three fathom deep.

Seven leagues to the westwards of the Steart lies the sound of Plymmouth, at
the outermost east point of the sound lies a high round rock, called Mewstone,
Plymmouth Mewestone.
the west point is called Ramehead, betwixt them both goes in the sound
Plymmouth north northeast in, it is broad and deep. A little to the northwards
of Ramehead is a fair sand-bay, where men may anchor close under the land, in
nine and ten fathom. Two leagues south a little easterly from Ramehead, lies a
Rock above water, called Eddystone. Eddystone.
The point of Plymmouth lies from the Eddystone North and by east, and
Northnortheast, distant about four leagues. In the sound, by the land of
Plymmouth, lies a little Island, which is fast to the west side with a riffe
or rane of Rocks under water, so that men must sail along to the eastwards
of it, whether they be bound into Catwater, Catwater
or into Hamoase the west harbor. If you will go into Catwater, then run in
betwixt the Island, and the point on the east side in with the land of
Plymmouth, until that you see Catwater open on the starboard side of you, go
then into the eastwards betwixt the point of Plymmouth, and the foresaid east
point on the starboard side of you, leaving the most part of the channel on
the starboard side of you, until you come within the point, and anchor there
right against that high steep norther-land, there is at low Water with an
ordinary tide four and five Fathom deep.

When you sail into Catwater, you must take heed, and give a good birth to the
souther point of the entry of Catwater, for there lie off to the foresaid
point, a ledge of Rocks under water, near about two cables lengths from the
Land, and upon the point of the ledge or shoale, lies a buy, where is at
half flood about twelve foot water, which buy you must leave on your
starboard side in going into Catwater, and when you have Catwater altogether
open, you may run into the eastwards, leaving (in the entry of the harbor) two
third parts of the channel on the starboard side, as before is said, because
the south shore is somewhat flat off, there lying a sandy bancke, which
reaches to the second point of the south shore of Catwater.

A little to the eastwards of that foresaid little Island, lies a rock under
water, upon which is at low water not deeper then two fathom. For to sail
within the Island, you may go into the eastwards, or to the westwards of the
rock according as occasion shall serve. If you will sail into Hamoase, to the
westwards of the rock, then take the sounding of the Island in four or five
fathom at low water, and run in so by it, until that the Fisher Village (lying
to the northwards a little within the land) come in the west side of the valley
on the north shore, then are you to run through between the Island and the
rock, and to the westwards of the rock. Within the Island upon the land of
Plymmouth, stands a wall or hedge, when as you see that onendling, and the
chapel of the foresaid Fisher-village comes to the north-side of the Valley,
and Catwater comes open; then do you run over the Rock. Between the
Island and the maine, men may anchor in twelve and thirteen fathom.

If you be bound into Hamoase, Hamoase.
you must run in between the Island and the land of Plymmouth, and then in
amiddest the channel between the two Lands, until that the entry of Hamoase
be open, run then into the northwards, as the channel leads, until you come
in about the west point, and anchor there in sixteen, fifteen, and twelve, or
ten fathom. In the narrow it is fifteen, sixteen, seventeene, and also twenty
fathom deep, and between the Island and the maine, eight, nine, ten, and
twelve fathom.

About half a cables length to the eastwards of the Passage way going into
Hamoase, lies a suncken rock under water, The German a suncken rock.
called the German, about two great ships lengths from the shore, and at low
water has not above four foot water upon it. And when men do come any thing
near this foresaid suncken rock going into Hamoase, either with the flood or
the ebb, the tide will set them right upon it, if it be calm. Therefore to
avoid it, men must (with calm weather) give this foresaid suncken rock a good
birth, until they bring the houses of the Fisher-Village, (called the
Stone-house) open of the easter-poynt of the Passage way, and then run in
over toward the north shore, until they have hidden the Island in the
foresaid eastern point of the passage way, for to avoid a suncken Rock Suncken
Rocks.
that lies off to the eastwards from the North point of the Beach on the
West Side of the Passage way, a half cables length off, and then run amids
the channel into Hamoase. Upon this foresaid suncken Rock at low water, is not
above 3 or 4 foot water.

In the sound of Plymmouth, not far to the northwards of the Mewstone, lie
two or three suncken rocks, Suncken Rocks.
upon which remain at low water not more then three or four fathom water, the
marks of them are these: To the eastwads of Plymmouth stands a Tower with a
Mill, and to the Westwards of the foresaid little Island stands a Gentleman's
house, when the little tower or turret of that house comes over the point on
the west side of the Island, and the foresaid Tower and Mill to the eastwards
of Plymmouth come one over the other, then are you upon the innermost suncken
rock or shoale, which it at low Water four fathom deep. But when the point
of Hamoase comes even without the point to the westwards of the Island, and
the foresaid Tower and mill alsoo one in the other, Then are you upon the
outermost rock, where it is at low water and spring-tyde three fathom and a
half deep.

From Ramehead west and by south five leagues, lies Foy, and betwixt them on
the coast lies a little Island, a little to the eastwards of a point, called
Talland-poynt, thwart of West-Louwe, called Louw-Island, Low-Island.
you may anchor there to the easterwards of the Island in 5 or 6 fathom.

Foy Foy.
is a broad haven, where a ship may go in at a half flood, at the east side of
the haven stands a little church with a little steeple, and on the west side
a white church, somewhat greater then that upon the east land with a square
steeple at the west end of it.

For to sail into Foy, you must have at least a half flood, and run in
midst the channel betwixt the two points, and being come within, then choose
which side you will, but the most water is by the west land, between the
stakes and the Tower that stands upon the west land. Being come within the
Stakes (as you come in by the west land) then bear somewhat off presently from
the west shore, almost into the middle of the channel, nearest to the west
shore, until you come before the Village that lies on the west side, there
is a deep docke, where a ship that draws sixteen foot water may lie a
float at low water. In the said dock may 3 or 4 ships lie.

If (when you come in by the east land) you desire to be in the foresaid docke
or poole, then sail in until you come within the stakes, and then edge over
off from the east-land until you come nearest the west land, for to avoid a
Flat, which lies by the east shore along the haven, and begins against
the first house of the West-Village. If it should happen, that you could not
lead it in with a sail, then let your anchor fall without the stakes, and warp
in with hawsers, until you come into the foresaid poole.

You may also sail so far in, that you may see a wall on the west side of
the haven, where lies a village behind it. A ships length to the southwards
of that wall, it is good lying by the east land, being moored by four cables,
there may alsoo a ship ride a float that draws sixteen foot water. You may
also sail further in along by that Swach that lies on the west side,
wherein the mill stands, but come not too near the north point of the Swach,
for there by it, lies a rock under water, being past that you may moore your
ship in the midst of the channel, there is best lying for ships that draw
much water.

Four leagues southwest and by west from Foy, lies the point of Dodman,
Dodman.
and two leagues to the westwards of it lies the Haven of Falmouth. The point
of Dodman is double Land with a round hill, which to the westwards goes
sloping down, somewhat toward the west end stands a mill with a sharp
tower, and some little houses upon the land, somewhat to the westwards, men may
see the castle of Falmouth upon a round Hommocke against the high Land. This
land is very easy to be known when you come from the west, or from the Lizard.

Upon the west point of the haven of Falmouth Falmouth
stands a Castle upon the high land and in the entry nearest the west side,
lies a great rock above water, you may sail about it on both sides, at the
inner side of the east point lie also some rocks off from the shore. For to
sail in there to the eastwads, along by the foresaid Rock, you must run
in within two cables lengths, along by the eastland leaving the foresaid
rocks on the starboard side, and the great rock on the larboard side, and so
sail right in with the high land that lies on the west side within the haven.
Within in the haven stands on the Land a white Chalkye spot, also a little
wood of trees, keep them over the North point of the foresaid high west-land,
and sail so right in with them, keeping them so until you come near them,
you shall find so at half flood, upon the shoalest, not less Water then five
fathom, and that betwixt the foresaid Castle upon the west point, and the
easter Castle that stands on the eastside, within the haven, over against it,
or a little within the Castles. When you shall then come by that foresaid high
west-land, run along by it, unto the north-end of the same, and anchor
there in twelve, thirteen, or fourteen fathom. You may also from thence edge
over toward the east land, and anchor there under or behind the banck; that
lies off from the eastern Castle along the middle of the haven, in six,
seven or eight fatham: the banck falls almost dry at low water, and is soft
ground, so that the ships sit in the oase, when they come there a ground.

For to sail into the westwards of the foresaid great rock, you must take the
sounding of the west land, where the Castle stands upon, in five or six
fathom, being somewhat within the rock, run (as before is said) toward the
west-land. To the westwards of the rock, it is in that channel six and seven
fathom deep at half flood, but in the channel to the eastwards of the rock,
seven and eight fathom.

Four leagues south and by west from Falmouth lies the east point of the
Lizard, betwixt them both lies a haven, called Helford, Helford.
which is little used for ships.

At the south side of the haven lies a steep point, and on the north-side a
low sharp point. Within the haven on the south side, stands a Gentleman's
house beneath at the strand, and upon the hill stands a tuffe of trees, you
must keep these one in the other, and run so amiddest the channel into the
entry of the haven. On the north side stand also 2 or 3 trees, these come a
masts length to the westwards of a little house that stands in a white sandy
bay, there upon you may sail in alsoo amidst the channel; it is a short
inlet, being come within, you may anchor in six or seven fathom. Upon the
south side stands also a sharp Tower, and upon the north side a little
Castle upon the steep land.

The Lizard has three points, the northermost is called the Blacke-head, from
that to the second the coast lies southwest and by west, and along to the
third about westsouthwest, or west and by south: from the second or middelmost
point, lie to seawards some rocks a cables length, or a cables length and a
half off, called the Staggs.

To the northwards of the northermost, or eastermost point of the Lizard,
betwixt Helford and the foresaid point lie some rocks a great league off from
the land, called the Mannackles, Mannackles.
south and by east from the harbor of Falmouth, and eastnortheast from the
foresaid Blacke-head, where of many of them are above water at low water, and
some of them at high water remain uncovered. Betwixt them and the shore it is
very foul and rocky, so that men cannot run through betwixt them without great
danger.

He that comes out of Falmouth, and is bound to the westwards, must not go
more southerly with an ebb then southsoutheast, or southeast and by south
according as the wind shall be, for to run clear of these foresaid.

The fifth Demonstration. Where in Are delineated the Coasts of England, from
the Lizard, and the Lands-end, to the C. of Cornwall, the Sorlings and the
channel of Bristow.
The Lizard.
THE Lizard is a low point, where some rocks lie off from it, upon the south end
stands a Tower, and upon the high land toward the n. end stands another
tower which is sharp.

About five leagues northwest from the Lizard, lies a great Baye, called
Mounts-Bay, Mounts-Bay.
at the west point of that bay lies a little Island, whereupon stand 2 little
short towers like beacons, on the east side in the bay lies another high
little Island, whereupon stands a Castle, called S. Michaels Mount S.
Michaels Mount.
on the east side of this Baye, lies a great ran of rocks, which lie off
into sea a league from the land, whereof men must take good heed in dark
weather, from thence to the southward toward the Lizard the coast is all
along full of rocks, but these lie not so far off from the shore.

For to sail into Mounts-Bay, coming from the Lands end, or from the Lizard,
and being to the westwards of the foresaid rane of rocks, you must run in
right with the little Island called Saint Michaels Mount, so long until you
come within a half league of it, then edge up to the westwards toward the Bay,
until that you see that foresaid little Island, with the 2 little short towers
at the west point, leave it on the larboard side, and run in close along to
the northwards of it, for it is very clean, but leave the castle a great ways
on the starboard side, being foul about it. Being come within the little
Island at the west point, you shall see within it a great sandy baye, anchor
there in seven or eight fathom. Eastsoutheast and southeast winds do blow
there right open in, for all other winds you lie there landlockt.

(...).
Four le^gues to the westwards of Mounts-Baye lies the Lands-end of England,
and lies from the Lizard w. n. w. distant nine or ten leagues. About a league
s. e. from the Lands-end and half a league without the land, lies a suncken
rock, which at low water comes even above water. Thwart off that rock
stands a Church upon the land, when you can but even see that over the high
land, then are you thwart of the foresaid rock, to wit, even as far from the
land as the rock, but when the Church is hidden behind the high Land, that you
cannot see it, then are you nearer to the land then the rock, or within the
rock toward the Land, and so you shall go through betwixt it and the Land.

Upon the Lands-end of England lie two round hills, when you get sight of them
you shall see upon the highest a sp^re tower, coming somewhat nearer, you
shall see upon the outtermost end, in the low land, another spire Tower, there
by is the Lands-end reasonable well to be known. The ground is thereabouts
whitish sand, with red sand, and mingled with shells.

From the Lands-end unto the C. of Cornwall, or to the little Island Bresam,
lies the coast most north about 5 leagues.

Rocks ^n the Lands end
At the Lands-end lie some rocks, you may run in within them as well to the
northwards as to southwards, and come to anchor in 8 or 9 fatho^: to come in
there from the southwards it is narrowest, and ten fathom deep: from the
northwards it is best and broadest, and eight and nine fathom deep; but on the
left side close to the north point of the Lands-end lies a suncken rock,
which you must avoid when you sail in there.

Silly.
Silly lies from the Lands-end westsouthwest distant eig^t leagues, but from
the Lizard west, sixteen or seventeen leag^es.

Between the Lands-end and Silly lie the Seven-stones Seven stones.
west and west and by south four leagues from the Lands-end, and north east,
and by east and e. n. e. almost 3 leagues from Silly, that is, a rane of rocks
which come not above water, but always breaks upon them.

Southsouthwest and southwest and by south 3 leagues from the Lands-end, and 5
leagues cast from Silly, lies also a sharp rock, called the Gulf, The Gulf
which comes at half tide above water, and is round about indifferent clean.

F^r to sail unto Silly.
Silly is divided into diverse Islands, along the west side lies a great
multitude of rocks, men may go in there through diverse channels or sounds, but
the souther channel is the best. About the midst of the entry of that sound
or channel, lies a suncken rock, men may go in on both sides of it, but to
the eastw^rds of it, it is broadest and best. For to sail in there coming
from the east, you must run along by the east land in eight or nine fathom,
and you shall so run along to the eastwards of that foresaid suncken rock,
which lies against a sconce a little without the castle. The marks to avoid
this Rock, are two rocks which lie on the west side within the haven, the one
(to wit the innermost) is somewhat greater then the other. If you bring them
one in the other, or the northermost a little to the eastwards of the
southermost or the smallest so that you may even see through between them, and
sail so right in, keeping them so, you shall so sail far enough to the
eastwards of the Rock. If you come from the southwards or the westwards, and
are bound into Silly, then run toward the east-land so long until you
bring the two foresaid rocks within the haven, one in the other, or even
through one another, sail then so in, and then you shall run (as before is
said) clear of the foresaid suncken rock, thwart of the sconce. At the inner
point of the Island, at the east side of this southern channel, lies another
suncken rock, whereof men must take heed. For to avoid it, you must run so long
to the northwards, upon the marks of the foresaid two rocks, until you may
see the little Tower in the sandy Bay, then go to the eastwards, unto the Bay,
and anchor there in eight or nine fathom. When you come near Silly upon the
south side, you shall see a square Tower in the sandy bay or valley, and to the
westwards many little Islands and rocks. The ground of Silly is somewhat stony
with some red shells.

Of the Depths and many sorts of grounds before and in the channel between
Silly and Ushant, and thereabouts.
Southwest and by south from the Seames Seames.
seven leagues it is deep 72 fathom, the ground pale, white course sand, like
small fretted little stones, with little pieces of queens shells with gray flat
little stones, and white glistering needles, sail from thence north and north

About two leagues southwest from the Seams it is deep 52 fathom, the ground
there is white, yellow rough, and somewhat longish sand, with a little red
small shelly sand, with many gray crompeld things, and some small with
glistering points of needles. If men did find there 70 or 80 fathom, they
would judge it to be good channel ground.

westsouthwest from the Lizard, or thereabouts, it is deep 95 fathom, the
ground red, yellow, and black sand, with small white round shelly sand, and some
little pieces of shells, and queen shells, with some pieces of thin shells.

Three and thirty leagues west and by north from Ushant and 27 leagues
southwest and by south Silly, in 95 fathom, the ground is gray, red and yellow,
mingled with small black sands, with dark, red, white, and yellow pieces of

in 90 fathom, the ground is small white rough, and somewhat long sand, mingled
with a little red and yellow, and some glistering little things like needles,
with two or three pieces of white gray shells. If you go on from thence
northeast and by north, until you come in 55 fathom, there the ground is
yellowish, white course shelly sand, with white pieces of shells; then you may
see Silly lie nine or ten leagues north or somewhat more westerly from you.

Westnorthwest from Ushant Ushant.

o^sie, mingled with small black sand. In some places of the same depth it is
white gray oasie small sand* with pieces of thin white shells amongst it, with a
little piece or two like parings of cheese: this ground cannot be gotten up
with candle tallow, or other hard tallow upon the lead, but with soft tallow,
or butter. In these depths you have no where such oasie ground as there,
whereby men may well know that they are on the back side of Silly or England,
to wit, west from Silly.

West from Silly S^lly.
7 leagues, it is oasie gray sand with 2 or 3 little pieces like parings of
cheese.

Seven or 8 leag. s. s. w. from the Lizard in 16 fathom, the ground is white
gross with a little red sand, with little shells, and little glistering white
things like needles. Nine or ten leagues south and by west from the Lizard, in
60 fathom, the ground is yellow pieces of shells, and gray pieces of soft flat
stones like parings of cheese, with some red pieces of shells, without any sand
therein.

South west and by west from the Lizard Lizard.
and southsouthwest from Silly Silly.
19 leagues, it is deep 78 fathom, the ground gray, yellow, and red shelly
sand, with red, yellow, and blue pieces of shells, with queen shells, and a
piece or two like parings of cheese, or like pieces of Oyster shells, with alsoo
two or three glistering little things like needles, in the height of about 49
degrees, and 30 minutes.

Fifteen or sixteen leagues southwest and by south from the Steart, Steart.
in 57. or 58. fathom, the ground is full of pieces of all manner of shells, and
queen shells, with a little yellow and white shelly sand, with many sorts of
little stones, and gray little pieces iike parings of cheese, with some
crumpled, and some not crumpled, but little glistering things like needles, and
little things like maggots that are in Bacon.

South southwest from the Steart, Steart.
sixteen leagues, in 53 fathom, the ground is white reddish shelly sand, with
pieces of queen shells, with red gray little stones.

South west from the Steart 8 leagues, it is deep 40 fathom the ground gray and
red shelly sand.

South southwest from the Steart, 13. or 14 leagues, it is deep 47 fathom, the
ground pale muddy sand, with little long things, and little stones.

A great kenning south southeast from the Staert, it is deep 40 fathom, the
ground red sandy clay with pits in the tallow.

Southwest eleven or thirteen leagues from the Steart, Steart.
in fifty fathom, the ground is white and yellow small shelly sand, with some
pieces of white shells, with gray and crumpeld, and alsoo glistering little
things like needles. In fine, he that sounds much, gets many and diverse
sorts of grounds and sometimes great change in little distance of place. But he
that sounds and finds white shells, with little things like strawes and
needles, it is certain that he is nearest to Ushant: but if he find brandy
ground, or black little stones mingled with white little things, then is he
nearest to Silly.

He that sounds thwart of Ushant, Marks of Ushant and Silly.
and finds small white sand, and little shells, and small little things oasie
and white. Ushant shall then lie north east from him. If he find long small
little things like needles, then shall Ushant lie southeast from him. But if he
be not sure of these grounds, then he shall bear to the northwards. And if he
find deeper water then he is toward the Seams, but if he find it shoaly,
then he is in the entering of the Channel to the northwards of Ushant. If he be
between Ushant and the Seams in 70 fathom, he shall find the ground to be
small little stones like black sand of the earth: or else if he find the
ground to be great red sand, then he must stand to the northwards, until that
he find the white sandy ground, and long small things then he may hold himself
certain to be in the entering of the channel.

From the Lands-end of England to the C. of Cornwall, the coast lies north
about 5 leagues, but Silly and the foresaid Cape lie southwest and northeast
distant about 9 leagues. By the Cape lies a little Island or Rock, called
Bresam, I. Bresam.
betwixt it and the Cape men may sail thorough.

From the Cape of Cornwall unto the little Town Saint Yves, S. Yves.
lies the coast about east and by north, and east northeast five or six
leagues. Saint Yves lies upon the west point of a great Bay, which is about
two leagues broad. At the East point of the Bay lies a little Island, there
lies off from it a great ledge of rocks, a great half league thwart off into
sea, where of many of them come at half ebb above water, therefore he that
comes off from the Cape of Cornwall, and will sail along the coast toward
Stoupert or Padstow, must keep off (thwart of this ledge) at least a great
league from the shore, because of the foresaid rocks. Betwixt that foresaid
little Island at the east point of the Bay and the maine land, it is also at
many places rocky and foul, so that one that is not there very well
acquainted, may not sail through there without great danger. In the Bay of
Saint Yves is on both sides good sandy ground, where men may anchor all over,
and come so near the shoares as they will. At the West side of the Bay at the
Town, is a head where small ships and Barks do go in within it, and lie
there succored for northerly winds, but great ships may not do so, they
must anchor without in six or seven fathom.

From Saint Yves to Hartland point, the course is northeast seventeen or 18
leagues, betwixt them both about half wa lies the point of Stoupert, to the
eastwards of it lies Padstow Stroupert Padstow.
in a Bay, where is a very good road in seven or eight fathom. At the west side
of that point lies a suncken Rock under water, and upon the point a great high
rock, to the westwards of that point toward Saint Yves, are many white sandy
and chalky bays along the shore, whereby the coast there is very easy to
beknowne.

Hartland point.
Hartland point is a point that lies out, four leagues north from it lies the
Island Londey, which is somewhat a long Island, it lies most north and by
west, and south and by east. At the east side of that Island men may ride for
Westerly winds in 14 and 15 fathom, but on the west side the ground is foul.

Four leagues to the eastwards of Hartland point eastsoutheast from the south
end of Londey, lies the sound of Biddeford, Biddeford
being a broad haven, where many ships do sail in and out. A little within
the mouth of the haven, it divides it self into two rivers, upon the
westermost on the starboard side lies Biddeford, and upon the eastermost on
the larboard side lies a town called Barnestable. Barnstable


From the point to the northwards of Biddeford Haven, unto Ilfercombe the
course is e.n.e four leagues, that is a haven where remains at low water 3
or four fathom deep. Before the haven is also good road, in 8 or 9 fathom at
half flood.

Eleven or 12 leagues to the eastwards of Ilfercombe, Ilfercombe.
lie two little Islands, about two leagues north and south one from the other,
called the Holmes, the northermost is called the Flatholm, and the southermost
the Steepholm, Flatholm Steepholm.
betwixt Ilfercomb and the Holms (somewhat nearer the Holms then Ilfercomb,
lies a little town called Mynehead, where many ships do lade.

In the fareway betwixt Ilfercomb and the Holmes, on the English side; on the
one side, and the banks on the Welsh side; on the other side, in the midst
of the channel it is deep 30. 25. 20. 18. 16. and 15 fathom, the nearer the
Holmes the shoaler water. When men come from the westwards within the Island
Londey, then they may see the Land on both sides, to wit, of England and Wales.
The English coast even from the C. of Cornwall to the Holmes is altogether
clean, but the coast of Wales is most all foul and shoaly, from the Island
Caldy unto Bristow, with many banks, sands, and riffes that lie off. The
Holmes and the Island Londey lie west southwest, and east northeast, distant 19
leagues.

He that will sail from Londey to Bristow, must run along by the English
coast, until that he come within the point of the Naes, for to avoid
Naes-sand, and then forth along through between the Holmes, leaving the
Steepholme on starboard, and Flatholme on the larboard side. Men may alsoo with
little ships, of small draught, sail about to the southwards of the
Steepholme, but it is there so shoaly, that there remains at low water no
more then two fathom water: Under Steepholm Ro^d under ^^eephol^.
men may anchor where they will, in four or five fathom.

He that comes off from the Naes, and is bound to Bristow, must stand over to
the Steepholme, and run along to the northwards of it. It lies from the Naes
eastsoutheast about seven leagues.

For to sail through between the Holms, For to sail through between the Holms
the right and best fareway, you must sail nearest the side of the Flatholme,
there it is deepest, with an open wind men may sail along so near by it
without any hurt, that they may cast with a stone upon it. Within, or to the
eastwards of the Holmes, lies shooting off from the eastland, a great shoale,
lying off with a great tail toward the west which (coming from the west) men
might easily sail within. For to avoid it, you must set the Flatholme (when
you are passed it) southwest from you, and keep it standing so, until that
you shall have sailed about a great league, look out then for a little Island,
that shall then at the east shore lie near about thwart from you, upon it
stand two mils, and above upon the maine land stands one mill. When the mill
that stands upon the high land comes to the west end of that foresaid
Island, you shall be past the foresaid tail of the English grounds, and
cannot sail within it, go then e.n.e. along by the English grounds, which
are flat, so that you may sail along by them upon your lead in 3 or 4
fathom so near as you will. When then the mill that stands upon the high
land, Marks the English ground.
comes between the foresaid two mills which stand upon the little Island,
then shall you be altogether past the English grounds, run then boldly toward
the English coast, and so close along by it, as you please, toward Passis or
Portshut point. From the Flatholm to Passis point in the right fareway, it is
deep 14 and 15 fathom. The Welsh side you must shun, and take very good heed of
it, because it is very uneven and full of steep banks that are needle to,
which at many places do fall dry at low water, you may not come nearer that
coast then in 12 fathom, for (sailing toward it) you shall have at one cast
ten fathom, and before you can heave the lead again, you shall sit fast,
along from Flatholm till you come to Bristow. About Passis point men do
anchor in Kings road Kings ro^d.
which is between the point and the river of Bristow, nearest the river there
is good clay ground in 8, or 9, fathom. They that are bound into the river are
brought in by the Pilots. Men may from thence also sail in along by the
coast to the River of Severne, which is also like the River of Bristow, a fair
River to sail into.

For to sail from Bristow to Londey, you must go away from Passis point w. s.
w. until that the Flatholm do come to bear southwest from you, or else until
that the three foresaid mills upon the south land do stand a like far one
from the other, to wit, that which stands upon the high land, do stand in
the midst between the other two, sail then right with the Flatholme, and
very close along to the southwards of it, and being passed it, go then forth
westsouthwest unto the Island Londey.

About 3 leagues to the northwards of Flatholm lies the Town Cardief Cardief.
in Wales, being a tyde-haven, before it is a good road, as well for ships that
are bound to the westwards as to the eastwards* where men may lie land locked
almost for all winds, to the eastwards and to the northwards of it lie many
sands and banks, which fall dry at low water, and so that they make men
landlockt for northeast and by east winds. He that is bound into the road
before Cardief coming from the west, must run in betwixt Flatholm and the
point of Cardief, lying somewhat to the southwards of Cardief, and being come
about the point, then to the northwards up along by the shore unto the road.

Close up to the point of Cardief, to wit, to the westwards of it, lie two
little Islands, the one next to the point, is called Silye, and the westermost
Barrey: Silye Barrey.
Betwixt Silye and Flatholme lies a rock, southeast and southeast and by east
from the point, which must be avoided when you will sail through there unto
the road of Cardief. When it is high water you may sail over all that which
at half ebb comes not above water.

About five leagues west from the point of Cardief lies the Naes, The Naes
to the westwards off it the land falls away first about northwest, then
afterward southwest, or southwest and by west, and so makes a great bay
betwixt the Naes and Worms head, where there are very good roads for west,
north, northeast, and east winds.

From the Naes a little from the shore lies a great bank called Naessand,
Naessand
which lies off from thence west and by south, and westsouthwest at least five
leagues into sea. From Wormshead likewise lies off a banck which is very
steep, called Helwix, Helwix.
about four leagues southsouthwest, and southwest and by south into sea, they
that come from the eastwards, and will go to ride in the Bay betwixt the Naes
and Wormeshead, run along close by the point of the Naes, through betwixt
the Naes and Naessand, likewise they that come from the westwards, and are
bound in there, may run through close along by the point of Wormshead and the
Helwix, it is betwixt them both about an English mile broad. He that comes
out of the sea, may come in between the foresaid sands or bancks, it is there
wide and broad.

Worms head.
Wormshead is a point lying far out, appearing a far off almost like the
Oldhead in Ireland, but it is above or under, and goes sloping down toward
the north, it has in many placey chalky spots, whereby it is very easy to be
known.

About 4 leagues to the westwards of Wormeshead lies the little Island Caldy,
Caldy.
where upon stands a white Tower, showing off at sea like a white sail,
which is set there for to know the land by.

Betwixt this Island and the point of Wormshead, the land falls away with a
great bay to the northwards, unto Carmarthen and Tinbuy, in this Bay it is all
over good anchor ground for to ride. On every side of the Island Caldy men may
alsoo anchor, and have shelter for all winds. A little to the northwards of
Caldy lies a rane of suncken rocks, called the Wullox. Wullox.
He that will sail about to the eastwardes of the Island, to Tinbuy, may
run close about by it, up to the westwards, through betwixt the Island and
the suncken rocks, leaving them on the starboard side, or else he may run
along alsoo to the eastwardes and to the northwards of the suncken rocks
leaving them on the larboard side, and so then also to Tinbuy, and anchor
there before the Town in five or six fathom. To the eastwardes and to the
northwardes of the foresaid rocks, it is also good anchorage in six, seven,
or eight fathom, it is there all clean ground, and far of shoale water. Men
may alsoo sail through to the westwards of the Island Caldy, (which is between
the Island and the point of the maine land) to Tinbuy, but it is there narrow,
yet clean, and deep enough.

River of Carmarthen.
The river of Carmarthen lies from the Island Caldy northeast and by north
distant about four leagues, the channel for to fail in there, lies in
eastnortheast, on the east or the south side lies a great Banck which lies
off far from the shore, and on the off-side goes off flat. For to sail in
there men may sound it in along by the east or north shore, until they be
over the shoalest of the bar, there is upon it at half flood about foureteen
foot water, and being over the bar, it will be again four fathom deep, or
thereabouts, then they may run in forth by their lead along by the south
shore, until they come within the river.

Four or five leagues to the westwards of the Island Caldy, lies Saint Gawens
point, S. Gawens point.
the south point of Wales, by some called the White point. About half an
English mile southsouthwest from this point, lies a suncken rock, called the
Crow, The Crow
whereof men must take heed.

Two leagues to the westwards of S. Gawens point lies the haven of Milford,
Milford-haven.
a broad and wide sound, lying in at the entry northeast in, being come in
within the points, men may go up to the northwards, eastwards, and southwards,
unto diverse places and roades. About by the north point, men may sail unto
Daleroade, there it is good lying in three fathom and three fathom and a half
at low water. When men come a little within the south point in the open of
Milford haven, there lies a little Island or rock like the Newstone by
Plymmouth, being past that, a little, they may run to the southwards, into a
bay, where they may lie landlockt for all winds.

A little to the westwards of Milford-Haven lie two little Islands the
southermost is the smallest, called Stocholm, Stockholm.
and the northermost Scaline. Scaline.
About two leagues northnorthwest or northwest and by north from thence, lies
the Island Ramsey, Ramsey.
there betwixt them has the land a great Bay, called the Broad-bay. Broad.
Ramsey lies at the north point, and Scaline, at the south point off the Bay,
there in along the shore is good riding for north, northeast, east and
southeast winds, in 7. 8. and nine fathom. Upon the North point of this Bay
lies a little Town, called Saint David's S. David's
to the northwards off lies the Coast of Wales along Northeast unto Cardygan.

About 2 leagues west and by south to seawards from the Island Scaline, and 3
leagues southwards from Ramsey, lies that little Island Grasholm, Grasholm
which is a round clean rock, and about four leagues off from it lie also two
little Lands, which are foul, called the Smalles. Smalles.
The lying of them, with the dangers there of, you may read in the description
of Ireland.

On the northwest side of the Island Ramsey lies the Bishop with his Clearks,
Bishop with his Clearks.
these are rocks that lie off to the northwards and southwestwards of that
Island a good way to sea. About five leagues northwest or somewhat northerly
from Ramesey lies another great rock, called Mascus, Mascus.
which is all round about foul, with many suncken rocks. He that comes to
sail thereabouts, or to lie by, must take very good heed of them.

The Island Ramsey, or the north point of Wales, and the southeast point of
Ireland, lie about eastsoutheast, and west northwest distant 16 leagues.

Padstow, the ground is sharp and rocky, but nearer the land it is all sandy
ground.

Betwixt S. Yves and Hartlands point are many white chalky hills along the
coast, especially near by Stoupert or Padstow, whereby this coast is to be
known.

In the channel betwixt the Holmes and Bristow, it is deep 12. 13. and 14
fathom, and men may see the land on both sides.

The sixth Demonstration, Where in The Southeast and east coast of Ireland is
described between Corckbeg and Hedenhoo or Houth.
FRom the Lands end of England to Waterford, the course is northnorthwest with
that course you shall fall right with Waterford. But from Silly to Waterford,
the course is north and by west, somewhat northerly forty leagues: betwixt both
it is all oasie and soft ground. Nine or ten leagues in the ossing from Ireland
lies a sand banck of forty fathom deep, where commonly fishermen lie to fish,
that is a certain mark of the distance of the land, The hill of Dongarvan.
when you find it in clear weather, and when there is good sight, then you
may see the high mountain of Dongarvan.

If you sail from the Lands-end of England with a north west course 43 leagues
so shall you fall before the River of Corckbeg, Corckbeg
it is there a good way upwards with a low water 7. 8. and 10. fathom water.

B^ll^^^tton Isle.
Four leagues to the eastwards of Corck-haven lies an Island, called
Ballecotton, within it men may ride for westerly and southerly winds, in
four, five, or six fathom. Corck and Iochull lie eastnortheast and
westsouthwest, distant seven or eight leagues.

The haven of Iochull Iochul.
is a broad haven, where men must go in at high water, by the east land it
lies in northwest and northwest and by north. The west side is a sandy strand
al along to the town.

About a league south and by west from the havens mouth of Iochull, lies a
little Island called Chapel: Cappel-Isle.
under it on the east side is a good road. He that comes before Iochul at a
low water, may go under that foresaid Island to ride there, and stay for the
last quarter flood, then there is four fathom water upon the banck. At the
west point of the Havens mouth lies a rock within it. About half ways to
the town stands a Priory, before it men may ride they may also edge over to
the eastland, and then run up the River. De Zuyd Oost zyde Van YERLANDT Van
Dubling tot aen to Eylandt Corkbeg.
Within it is three, four and five fathom deep. From the east side lies a
rane of rocks, at least half ways over in the havens mouth, a little without
the rocks it is at low water no more then five or six foot water, but at high
water it is deep enough.

Four leagues to the eastwards of Iochull, lies Dongarven haven, betwixt both
lies an out point; a little to the eastwardes of it stands a high black
Tower, called Ardimore, Ardimore
which may be seen well four leagues at sea, within it is a bay, which is a
good road for westerly winds in seven or eight fathom.

Dongarvan.
Dongarvan is a narrow tyde-haven, the mouth off the haven is full of rocks, and
at low water it falls dry, men must go in there at high water, and run
in through betwixt the rocks, it lies in northnorthwest, within it is deep
enough. The town Dongarvan lies upon the west side of the haven. From
Dongarvan to Waterford are eight leagues.

Within Dongarvan, northnorthwest landwards in, lies the mountain of Sleges,
which men do call the high mountain of Dongarvan, or Cape de Quin, C. Quin.
or Caray Quin, it showed it self with three exceeding high hommockes, far
above all other lands, thereabouts, men may see it at sea along a great part
of the south coast of Ireland.

When you shall have that mountain northnorthwest from you, and sail in right
with it, you shall fall right with Dongarvan.

When you shall have it north from you, and sail in right with it, then you
shall fall with Iochul; being northnortheast, then you shall fall with Corck,
but when it shall be n.w. and so run in, you shall fall with Waterford.

The haven of Waterford Waterford.
lies about five leagues to the westwardes of the s. east point of Ireland,
being called Carnaroort, the coast betwixt both lies eastnortheast and w. s.
w. and shows it self in the ossing, within the land, with high hills two
and three double one above the other, but by the sea side it is all low land,
where you may see many flat Towers upon it, as you sail along by it. The
east point of the haven is a low rock point, but it is clean, upon it stands
a high white flat Tower, called the Tower of Waterford, Tower of Waterford.
which you may see far off at sea, and is a perfect mark to know this haven
by, there stand many more flatt Towers to the westwards along the coast, but
this is better to be seen then all the rest, because it is white and higher
then the other. The west point is a high and foul point, there lies a shoale
soutsoutheast off into sea, from it the channel is broad and clean, without
it, it is eleven and ten fathom deep, and in the havens mouth seven fathom, and
somewhat further in six fathom, it lies in north and north and by west,
within this river within the east point is a good road in four or five
fathom, a league within the rivers mouth there lies on the west side a steep
point, from thence begins a shoale lying to the northwards along the
shore unto the steep point of Passage, and shoots over from that point with
a tail, toward the east shore. Passage is a village where men pass over,
lying on the west side of the river, a little to the northwardes of the
foresaid steep point.

Betwixt that village, and that point on the west side is a good road very fit
as well for them that are bound out, as for them that are bound up. In sailing
up you must take heed of a little shoale that lies off by castle (standing on
the east side of the river) somewhat thwart over, the River downwards, at high
water there is no more then two foot water upon it, a man that looks for it,
may see it, it is also flat that a man may sound it. About half a league
northwards up the river from Passage, there goes another river westwards up to
Waterford.

About half ways betwixt the haven of Waterford and the point Carnaroort, lie
2 little Islands about half a league from the shore, called Saltees, The
Saltees.
the southermost is the greatest and lies distant from the Tower of Waterford,
directly cast almost three leagues. Betwixt these two Islands, you may sail
through in five, six and seven fathom, but you must keep nearest the smallest
or northermost Island, for to avoid some suncken rocks that lie at the north
end of the great Island, and at low water are dry.

From the northermost or smallest Island of the Saltees toward the maine
land, lies off a ledge of rocks where men were wont to go over on foot, but
now may sail over. For to sail betwixt the Saltees and the main land, you
must leave two thirds of the distance of water from the Islands; and one third
part from the maine, and you shall have at low water about two fathom deep.

About a half league without the southermost Island of the Saltees, lies a
rock above water, called Kinbegh, Kinbegh,
and s. west about so far from it, and s. and by west from the south end of
the Saltees lies a suncken rock, called Kimor, Kimor.
of the bigness of a ship, it comes with half ebb even above water, it is
so steep that a man may lie with a ships side against it, and have 14 fathom
water, so that a man (without any danger) may sail along by it, as near as
he will. A man may also (if need require) sail through betwixt Kinbegh and the
greatest Island of the Saltees, but a seaboard of all is best and securest.

To the eastwards off the rock Kinbegh, southeast from the greatest Island of
the Saltees, lie also some suncken rocks called the Frailes, The Frails
which may be seen at low water, there men may also sail through within them.
Northeast from the Saltees lie also rocks, the southermost is called the Tuns,
and the northermost the north rock. Tuns and northrock


Northnortheast from the greatest Island of the Saltees, or from Kinbegh, and
s. west and by s. from Carnaroort, lies one rock above water, called
Blackrock, Blackrock
that is clean and clear round about, so that a man may sail round about it
freely, without fear of danger. But a quarter of a league eastwards from it,
lies a suncken rock called the Barrel, Barrel.
of that a man must take heed.

Under the Islands of both the Saltees, a man may ride, under the greatest at
the n. west side nearest the north end: the mark or knowledge of the road is,
a black rock like a boat turned upside down, Road under the Saltees.
right against that you must anchor in seven, eight or nine fathom, there it is
good sandground, and landlockt for an eastsoutheast, southeast and a south
wind, a southwest wind blows along the shore. If you anchor nearer the
shore in 5 fathom or there about, there it is rough ground.

Under the smallest Island a man may ride at the east side in 7 or 8 fathom, so
that the north point of the Island lie n.n. west from you, there you shall lie
near the land-lockt for s. west and n. west winds.

From the point of Waterford the shore lies to the eastwardes, within the
Saltees, eastnortheast, until Carnaroort, with many bays, and all oasie and
black sandy. A man being acquainted there, should at a need in many places
find good roads, there is nothing that can hurt you except a little foul
place a little to the. w. ward of Carnaroort close by the shore.

He that comes out of Waterford, For to avoid the foul grounds of the
Saltees.
and will go about to the southwards of the Saltees, must not go more easterly
then e.s. east, for to go clear of the foul grounds, which lie to the
southwardes of the Saltees, and when the Saltees shall be north of him, then
lies the course from thence to the Tuskar, directly northeast, or a little
more easterly. But for to go along without the Tuskar, a man must go at
least northeast and by east to go clear of him.

The Tuskar Tuskar.
is a great black smooth rock, lying like unto a ship turned up-side down, but
is about twice so great, at the north side of it lie also two small rocks
under water. The Tuskar lies from the point of Gr^noore s.e. and by east, and
e.s. east, distant one league: from the Saltees n.n. east, four leagues and a
half, from Black-rock also east northeast, two leagues and a half, and from
the Lands end of England n. and by west.

Southeast and by south about ten leagues from the Tuskar, lie two little
Jslands close one by another, about four leagues from Grasholme, called the
Smaels, Smaels.
at high water and spring tides the water flows over them, the northermost is
called Scakum, and the southermost is called Kamey, there lie off in the sea 2
little shoals from them, the one north-northwest and the other southsoutheast.
Betwixt the Smals and Grasholme lies also a ledge of rocks, which at low
water may be seen above water. It is not without great danger to go through
betwixt them both, especialy with calmes, by reason of the tide that runs
very strong there through; an eastsoutheast moon makes high water without the
Smaels.

From the Tuskar east and by south about eight leagues, lies also a great
rock, with many small rocks round about it, called Mascus. Mascus rock.
He that comes from England and will sail toward Ireland, must take great
heed thereof, especialy when as through westerly or northerly winds he shall
be driven a little to the eastwards of the course.

Road under Carnaroort.
For to anchor under the point of Carnaroort, coming from the west, you must
take heed to come no ne^rer the shore then in six fathom, until that you
shall be passed by the high hill that lies to the westwards of the point, when
you shall, have brought out the mill to the eastwards the length of a capstane
bar, then you may anchor in 9 fathom. There is very good riding.

From Carnaroort to S. Margets bay, the shore lies along northeast one
league, it is betwixt both rocky and foul, but the foul ground lies not
far off at sea. For to keep clear without it, you must keep so far off the
shore that you may see the topps of the double land within about the cliffe
land and you need not fear, but if you come so near the shore that the
double land within be covered of the foremost cliffe land, or that thereby it
get out of your sight, you shall then surely sail upon the foresaid rocks.

By S. Margets Bay upon the foresaid land stands a Gentleman's house in the
hills, when you have brought that with the mill that stands within, one in
the other, then you may go into the road, and leave the rocks which lie
above water half ways over the bay, either on starboard or larboard of you,
anchor there in five or six fathom, sandy ground.

About s.f.e. from S. Margets Bay off at sea, lies a suncken rock, that at
low water lies dry, called Caliach, Caliach.
for to avoid it, take heed unto these marks: when you come from Carnaroort,
and have Black rock with the great Island of Saltees one in the other, and keep
them so, and then sail on northeast, you shall go right upon this suncken
rock. For to go to the southwards of it then keep black rock with the
smallest Island of the Saltees one in the other, Marks for Caliach.
or else for to go to the northwards of it, keep Blackrock without or to the
eastwards of the great Island, and then you shall not need to fear any danger
of this suncken rock.

From S. Margets bay to the point of Grenore, lies the coast northeast half a
league.

The point of Grenore is not very high, but steep and flat on the top, Riffe
of Grenore.
off from it goes a shoale about a quarter of a league into sea east and by
south, of very rocks and stones, the which at low water falls dry a good
ways off the shore. The ships coming from the southwards that are bound for
Dublin or washford, go in commonly betwixt the Tuskar and the foresaid rocks
of Grenore, for to come within the banck or sands. Oftentimes they go into
Waterford for to hire a pilot to bring them up. For him that will be his own
Pilot, we will describe all the marks that are to be taken heed of, as well
for to sail into Grenore, as also into the deep or haven of Washford, as they
are now at this time, and hereby do advise men that they do not always
continue so, because by reason of the floods, the channel does shift, and
stretch it self out more northerly, and also waxes deeper.

Coming out of the sea about a league or two near unto Grenore, you shall see
the high ragged double land high above the point of Grenore, which (as is
aforesaid) is not very high, but flat on the top. By that said high ragged
double land within, men do know the entrance of the channel of Washford. When
men do come from the southwardes and the eastwardes. When you have sight of
the point of the Grenore, you may boldly go right with it, until that said
double land do show it felfe, by estimation, but a man's length above the point
of Grenore, a shows this figure.

The high land over the point of Grenore.

The stat foore land of Grenore.



Then are you far enough from the shore, not to be in any danger of the
shoale of Grenore: Or else you may fit you self that you come no near the
shore then in six or seven fathom: but yet for need a man may borrow of the
shoale in five fathom, or four fathom and a half, but you must also take heed
that you go not so far off from it, that you have more the eight or nine
fathom depth, otherwise you should come to near the banck that lies to the
northwardes of the Tuskar, which on the inner side is very steep and needle
too, upon it is no more then twelve foot water, and close by it ten fathom
deep. If that you keep the foresaid ragged high land (as is before said) a
man's length above the land of Grenore, and so sail to the northwardes, so long
until you bring that same high land without or to the northwardes of the
steep point of Grenore, then are you yet right against the shoale and must yet
sail to the northwardes, keeping the mill that stands next unto the point of
Grenore, so that you may see the top of it even right over the steep point of
Grenore. When you keep it so, Greenbay
you shall not be in any danger of the shoale or riffe. Then as soon as you
see a castle (which stands a little without the strand) come without the
point of Grenore, then may you boldly sail toward it, by your lead, into the
Bay of Grenore.

The said mill stands upon the land of Grenore, a little within the land, that
may serve for a mark for not to come too near as well to the shore as also to
the shoale or riffe, for if you come not so near the shore that you loose the
mill out of your sight, but keep so far off, that you keep sight of it, then
do you keep far enough from the shore, and from that rocky shoale or
riffe. Then when the mill shall come to lie southwest and southwest and by
south from you, then you are even passed the shoale or riffe, go then n.w. and
by west, and northwest, according as the wind and tide shall be into the Bay
of Grenore.

Or else you may observe another mark: Sail on so long north, until that you
see a long black house come out to the westwards of Grenore, upon the low land,
the which shows like a black rock upon the land: then you may luff on
toward the shore in four or five fathom along by the riffe, and run in so
until that you get six or seven fathom, and presently afterward shall be
eight or nine fathom deep, but then afterward is it shoale by little and
little, as you come near the shore.

If you have a large wind: then sail so long to the northwards until you see
another little black house come out without the point, sail then unto it, you
shall (so doing) have no danger of the riffe.

In the Baye it is shoale water, you may lie there so near the shore as you
please, in six, five, four, and also three fathom, and there you can get a
Pilot to bring you to Washford.

For to sail out off Grenore bay.
For to sail out of the Bay of Grenore, you may run out so close by the shore,
that you may see but the wings of the mill over the Foreland, and so go on
east southeast into sea along by the riffe, or according as the wind and
tide shall be, so long until that you may see thee roof of the mill, then
you may go larger, and by little and little go more southerly, and then you
shall see it ripple upon the riffe.

For to sail too washford
For to sail out of the Bay of Grenore toward Washford with a ship that
draws little water, you may boldly run along by the shore, and sail
through betwixt the Haenmans path and the Souder, that is a channel where at
high water and ordinary tides is eight foot water; but with a spring-tyde
there is ten foot water.

The Haenmans path is a dry sand, which makes the south side of the channel
of Washford, lying off from the Souder.

The Souder that is the south point of the maine land of Washford haven.

But if your ship go deeper, then you must (sailing out of Greenbay) go
further off from the shore, Schoale washford
for to come without the sand that shoots off from Haenmans path, yet you
must also take heed that you go not to far there-off, for if you come so far
off in ten fathom, you shall come too near unto the banck that lies without,
which is on the inner side very steep and needle too, therefore go no further
from the shore then in seven, eight or nine fathom, but coming somewhat more
northerly about Haenmans path, then you may well go off into ten and eleven
fathom; also you may not come nearer Haenmans path then in seven fathom.

If you desire to be upon the bar of Washford and to leave the shoale of
Haenmans paths, to wit, to go to the northwards, then take heed unto these
marks: At the north side of the channel of Washford lies a high hill with a
round hommock, which is to be seen over the Foreland, and a little castle in
the low land, a little above the strand, appearing as if it were against the
land; bring that round hommock a little to the northwards of the castle, and
sail so in, but bring not the hommock within or to the southwards of the
Castle, for then you should be in danger of the sand of Haenmans paths,
unless it were by need, and with a bare wind, then you might borrow so near
to bring them one in another, and so to sail in, but it is best to keep them
somewhat out one from another, to wit, the little Castle to the southwards of
the hommock.

If it should happen that you could not see these foresaid marks well, nor
discern them, then you may go about the sand of Haenmans paths by your lead
in seven fathom without any danger.

For to know then when you are far enough sailed to the westwards, or are past
Haenmans path, and are open before the channel, you shall see in the
south-land a little Castle that stands about four leagues in the land within
the strand, in the side of the high land of Washford, about southwest and by
west from you, when that shall be upon that point from you, and that it
stands betwixt the two northermost little sand-hills that are upon the foot
strand of the Soudre (which is upon the south shore) then are you past
Haenmans paths; sail in then upon the marks of that little Castle, and the
little sand-hils over the bar of the haven; there it is at high water about
sixteen foot deep.

As soon as you are past the outermost flat at the point of Haenmans paths,
you shall go somewhat nearer to Haenmans paths, although it be very steep,
that the tide does not bring you upon the tail of the north-ground where the
mast stands, that is a foremast of a ship that is there lost, and lies there
suncken into the sand, by the sore-mast the north grounds are very steep and
needle to, but without and within very flat going up.

In this channel and upon the Bar an east and west moon makes highest
water: but the flood runs yet afterward a half tide strong by the channel
to the northwards; so that when it is highest water in the channel and upon
the Bar, yet runs the tide thwart over the channel, therefore a man must
keep him so near to Haenmans paths, as is said, that is the cause that tail
of Haenmans path is cast up still more and more to the northwardes, and that
the channel now lies out more to the northwards then it was w^nt to do: And
yet hereafter it is like that it will stretch it self more to the northwards,
so that the foresaid m^rkes (by all likelihood) will not continue certain
alwaye^. Even as the flood after the highest water, runs yet a half tide or
3 hours strong (in the channel) to the northwards, so also runs the ebb a
half tide to the southwards after the lowest water, but not so strong as the
flood.

Being over the shoalest of the Bar, you shall have three and a half, and
four fathom, and in the channel betwixt the north grounds and Haenmans paths
against the mast 5, fathom depth, run in by Haenmans paths, all along
until you come to the foot strand, and then edge over to the north shore, for
to avoid the grounds which lie to the westwards above the Soudre, you may
borrow of the shoale on the north side by your lead, into ten or eleven foot,
according to the draught of your ship. In the right deep of this edging over,
you shall have at high water, fifteen foot depth.

The mark of this edging over is a white little castle that stands on the
north side of the haven in the valley of the Land, when that comes over the
steep point of the innermost Island to the two that lie by the nor^^ shore,
and seems to be about a man's length hig^, then you may boldly run in n.w.
with it, until that ^ little chapel within the Land, and to the southw^rds
of Washford (a little or about a cables length to the northwards of that other
forenamed little Castle on the north side of that high ragged land, that has
served ^^r a mark to sail over the Bar) comes over a b^ack hommock that
you may see upon the high land, a little to the southwards of the Castle of
Washford, when you shall have brought these marks one in the other, edge then
over again to the south land upon the marks for then you shall be above the
sands of the Soudre; and with that course also shall not be in danger of the
tail of the sand that shoots off from the point of Passage, which is on the
north side, but it is there broad and large, that a man may there turn to and
again, it is altogether shoale water, of 10 and 10 foot and a half at high
water. Sailing up upon these foresaid marks, you sh^^l come about the distance
of the shot of a Cast pee^^ without the castle of Washford to the south shore
sail then in along by it, and keep on the sounding of the shore until you
come within the castle, there you may anchor, and shall find there about 3
fathom water; For a man that is there unacquainted, it is best to anchor there,
because before the town lie some suncken rocks; he that will lie before the
town, must (right against the kay, or the head of the market) go a good ways
off the shore, because of a sunken rock that lies thereabouts, and go right
against the west end of the town, and anchor there in 3 fathom, or thereabouts.

To the southwards of the sands, that lie to the westwards or above the Soudre,
goes a dreeke through, there is more water then in the edging over to the
northwardes of the sands. The mark sor to sail through there, is: That you
keep the highest hommock of the hi^^ ragged land (behind Washford) right over
the castle of Washford* but there can be nothing gotten by it, with say^ing
through there, in regard you must nevertheles go over the shoalest, after that
you are passed the sands of Soudre, to wit, over the foresaid depth of ten and
11 foot.

For to sail out from Washford, with a ship that goes deep, you may not lade
deeper then ten foot, or ten foot and a half for to come over the foresaid
shoale; you shall then sail about to the northwards of the shoale that lies
within, or to the westwards of the Soudre, and go in and anchor betwixt the
shoale and the Soudre, there you shall be landlockt for all winds, except for
the southwest wind you have little shelter, you shall therefore bring out your
best anchor, in the southwest, and the other in the northeast, because that the
winds that come out of the south w. over the land, do not put you upon the
north grounds. There at the Soudre, you may take in the rest of your lading, it
is a league from the town.

If you will anchor before the Bar of Washford for to stay for the tide, you
must anchor a little to the northwards of the Bar, and go off somewhat until
you have 8 fathom, there it is clean sandy ground.

In the night there are two fires made upon the Soudre for the Fishermen for to
come in by night, by the Haenmans paths, he that will sail in by them, must
keep the highest fire a little to the southwards of the other, for to avoid
the north grounds.

Besides the deep along by the Haenmans paths, the Fishermen have a little
channel that goes out close by the north shore, it is there about 6 foot
deep at high water.

Channel through the banks before washford
Erom the Bar of Washford a man may sail east and by south, and west and by
north out and in through betwixt the banks into sea, or out of the sea, that is
a large and broad channel.

For to sail from the Bar of Washford within the sands through toward
Dublin, you must keep the sounding of the shore, and run along by it in
six, 7 or eight ^athom, you shall so sail along about a cables length from
the shore, which is very clean without any danger, so that any man (having but
a little knowledge of the Land) may sail there along by night, only you must
take heed not to go further from the shore then in 7 or 8 fathom, for not to
come foul of the banks, which are on the innerside very steep and needle too.

When you have sailed to the northwardes along by the shore, about two
leagues from the Bar, you shall see three white spots or rocks in the
sand-hill, a little to the northwardes thereof stands a piece of a wall, much
like a pillar of a Church: Right against this pillar, a great English mile from
the shore, begins a sand, called the Rusch and Ram, lying from thence
along the shore to the northwardes, you may sail about it on both sides,
but it is best to keep the shore, and to run through there within in six
or seven fathom, as is said out of fear of the outtermost banckes, which are
very steep, and therefore cannot be sounded; Therefore men do seldom use to
sail there a seaboard of this sand.

Right against this forenamed Rusch and Ram, the shore makes a Bay unto the
point off Glaskarrick, when you are so far is this point, then you are past
the foresaid sand.

Point of Glaskarrick. Channel th^^ugh the banks before Glaskarrick.
The point of Glaskarrick is a low point, a little to the northwards of it
stands a castle.

When you are without the banckes in the north channel, and desire to come
within the banckes, then keep that castle (if you can get sight of it) a
little to the northwards of the low point, and run boldly right in with it,
unto the land, without fear of the grounds, there is a good channel, through
the banckes; you shall not find less depth then 15 or 16 fathom, until you
come to the shoaling up against the shore. This Channel lies in northwest.

For to sail from Glaskarrick to Dublin, run all along by the shore (which
is somewhat full of Bays) and keep you (as before) in eight, seven, or 6
fathom. Two great leagues to the northwards of Glaskarrick lies a sand, a
great half English mile from the shore, called the Glaskarmen, the ground is
very uneven betwixt both. But nevertheles run through within that sand and keep
the sounding of the shore, but not so far from it, that you come into ten
fathom, for then you should sail close along by the Glaskarmen, Glaskarmen.
which is very steep, and about two English miles, or a half Dutch mile long.

One English mile to the northwards of Glaskarmen lies the point of
Arkelohead. Arkelohead.


Sailing through between the shore and Glaskarmen, to the northwards, a man
may see 2 points, to wit, Mizanhead and to the northwardes of it Wicklohead.
Marks for to avoid the Glaskarmen.
If you keep Wicklohead even within the point of Mizanhead, then you can take
no hurt of the Glaskarmen. But if you would sail a seaboard of the Glaskarmen,
then keep Wicklohead a good ways without the Mizanhead, and so run along
a seaboard of it, and you can take no hurt of it: But if you keep the point of
Wicklohead but even without the Mizanhead, you shall not fail to sail upon
the Glaskarmen.

At the north point of Arkelohead lies a little stony ledge very steep and
needle to. A man must take good heed of it (coming from the northwards) and
bound to the southwards, Ledge at Arkelohead.
and then must come no nearer it then in five fathom, toward the shore lie
some little rocks above water: when you come from the northwards; and those
little rocks are westnorthwest from you, then are you passed it, to wit, to
the southwards of that ledge; and then you may again borrow of the shore,
upon the lead, commonly men do keep so far of the shore, that they can
take no hurt of the foresaid ledge.

At the north side of the point of Arkelo is a fair sandbay, Baye Arkelo.
there is a good anchor ground, and all over good riding in 8, 7, or 5 fathom,
in this bay are good store of herrings caught.

Right against Arkelo runs also a channel through the banckes into the sea.
For to sail into the channel before Arkelo.
For to sail in there out of the sea, look out for a round hill within the
land; bring that westnorthwest, or west and by north off you, and sail then in
there boldly, keeping it so. But if you bring the round hill west of you, and
sail so in, you shall sail upon the point of the north grounds, it is in
that channel about seven or eight fathom deep.

About an English mile to the northwards of the point is the river of Arkelo
but very shoale, at high water there comes no more then six foot water.

The coast of Washford unto Wickelo lies most north and by east, a little more
easterly: But he that will sail without along by the banckes or sands, must
not go more northerly then northnortheast, for to avoid the grounds which lie
about Wickelo, 3 leagues off from the land. And to the southwards the south
grounds lie scarce a league from the shore, there not long since a pilot
keeping bad reckoning run without the sands along north and by east, and
sailed thwart of Arkelo, behind a tail of sand that lies off from the north
to the southwardes, and he lost his ship. Arkelo lay from them (when they sat
upon the sand) west and by south.

About two leagues to the northwards of Arkelo lies Mizanhead it is a black
head. Betwixt Mizanhead Mizanhead.
and Arkelo in the fareway it is eight and 9 fathom deep, it is also between
them both along the whole coast, good anchoring and clean ground.

From Mizanhead to Wicklohead Wicklohead.
it is also 2 leagues, but this reach is shorter then the other to Arkelo.

One English mile to the southwards of the point of Wicklo, lies a little rock
close by the shore, called the Wolf, Wolf.
it comes at half tide above water, the Fishers boats run through within it,
but it is not to be done with ships.

Right to the southwards of Wicklohead, somewhat further out then the point,
lies also a rocky sand, called also the Horse-shoe, Horse-shoe.
close unto the point, about south and by east from it a man should for need
(when he cannot do better) sail through there within it, but he must be very
well acquainted with it, or else not well to be done; without, it is more
certain and best going off somewhat to the deep. If you keep the point of
Brahead a little without Wicklohead, then you can take no hurt of it, or if you
keep the high inner land, so that you may even see it above the land of Wicklo,
and go not altogether hidden behind it, then you go there without it in 5
fathom. The point off Wicklo is steep and stony with a double top little hill,
within stands a little chapel, when you can see that through the saddle off
the hill, then you are right against it, and have it on your side; the village
of Wicklo lies to the northwards off the point in the Bay, there is a little
haven, which at high water has ten foot water.

In the Bay the ground is so hard and chindell, that the anchors do not hold
there, but without the Bay somewhat far from the shore, toward the Banckes,
the ground is somewhat better.

Channel through the banks thwart off Wicklo.
Thwart of Wicklo alsoo is a channel through the bancks for to sail that out
or in, keep the Castle of Wicklo, that you may see it open of the point,
thereupon you may boldly sail out or in.

Fourteen English miles from Wicklo lies the point of Brae, a high steep
stony point, and the high land there about on the sea coast.

Betwixt Wicklo and Brae lies out a flat point with a little Fisher village,
called Nicastell, there (sailing along) you have four, five and six fathom
deep, but from the flat point unto the steep point of Brae, it is well 14
fathom deep, the land lies there about north and north and by west.

Within the land lies a high hill, off fashion like a sugarloafe, Sugarloaf
that is the farthest in the land off the three hills, which they call the
Vineyards, when you have them through one another, and are northwest, and so
keep them, then may you boldly thereupon run through the banckes into sea, or
out of the sea, by these marks you may come in within the banckes that is a
very large and broad channel.

Thwart from that foresaid Sugarloafe to the southwards of Brae lies a bancke
that is not deeper then 4 fathom, very stony and sharp ground.

Brahead.
Braehead is very steep, likewise also the ground by it, is 10 fathom deep
close by the shore, to the northwards of the point lies a little tyde-haven,
there stand the houses called Brae on the north side.

From Braehead to the Island Dalke Island Dalke.
(lying at the s. point of the Bay of Dublin) the course is n. and by w. 4
English miles, there betwixt both goes in a bay.

At the n. e. side of the Island Dalke lie some rocks, lying along the maine
not far from it. Men sail within the Island through and leave all the rocks and
the Island lies to seawards.

The Sound betwixt the Island Dalke and the maine land, is called the Sound of
Dalke, the sound of Dalke.
it lies northnorthwest, and north and by west through, it is 7, 8, and nine
fathom deep, men may anchor under the Island, nearest the Land, there is good
sandy ground, or somewhat further in, there lies a round rock, nearest to the
maine land, there men may make fast a Cable on it, and an anchor thwart of the
channel, toward the other rocks, because of the tides, for the tide runs
there very strong through. A s. f. e. and a s. and by east wind blows there
right in, but in regard it is there very narrow, there can go no great sea,
with a south east wind you are landlockt of the Island, and a south wind
comes off the maine land.

From the Island of Dalke, until you are passad the village of Dalke, the
shore lies northwest and by west, before the village you have some succor
for a south east wind, the wind being more easterly, you lie in the open sea.
You lie there in 8 or 9 fathom, the nearer the Island the deeper, the place is
called the Berton road; Berton road.
you may not anchor further to the westwards then before the village: to the
westwards of the village the ground is foul and sharp.

The north point of the Bay of Dublin, called Houth Houth.
or Hedenho, is a very high point, it seems a far off as if it were an
Island, but it is fast to the maine land with a small and very low neck: To
the northwards of it lie the Islands Yrelands-eye and Lambey, those may be
seen (being to the Southwards of the point Houth, and being before the
entrance of Dublin) over that foresaid small neck of Land.

From the Sound of Dalke to the Bar of Dublin, the course in n. n. w. the
fareway it is deep 9, 8, 7, 5, and four fathom how nearer the Bar the shoaler
water. When you sail up, you must keep the westermost Rock that lies
without at the Island of Dalke, a handspikes length open of the Island, or the
other rocks, and shall so come before the entrance, without hav^ng ^^y let or
hinderance of the sand. Or you may ^ayle more to the eastwads right toward the
low la^d of the norther shore, and then by your lead along by it to the
^^rre.

If you come from the northwards, you may run in close about the point of
Houth by your lead, and then all along by the norther shore, until you come
to the mouth of the Bar, there along it is the deepest water, but toward
Dalck it is shoaler. From the south shore runs of a great tail of sand,
almost unto n. shoa^e. To the no^thwards of it goes the deep in. Upon that
tail a little within the point stands a beakon of a mast, made by the
Englishmen called the Paersing. Pae^sing.


For not to come too near this foresaid sand, coming from the southwards,
Marke^^ (...)
look out for the Island Yrelands-eye, keep that so, that you may but even see
it over the low land close after unto the high land of Houth, so you can take
no hurt of that sand. When the Tower of Sa^nt Patrickes in Dublin which
stands on the land side of Dublin, comes right over that beakon the
Paers^^g, then are you yet right against the point of the sand which shoots
out a good way to the northwards o the Paersing. For to go clear of that, you
must run so far to the northwards, until the Paersing comes ^ight over a
little Castle with three turrets, or little towe^s, which stands to the
southwards to the town, or when the Paersing comes betwixt that foresaid
little Castle and the town, then are you above the point of the sand, then go
in west and by south until you come over the shoalest of the Bar, there is
at spring tide 15 or 18 foot water, but at low water and ^eep tide, not more
then 6 foot, you may sound it on both sides. When you are over the shoalest of
the Bar, then anchor within the sand by the beakon in Poelbergh, Road in.
Poelberg
there it is at high water 4 fathom deep. The mark of this road is, that you
bring that before written hill like the Sugarloafe that here before is spoken
of, and serves for a mark for to sail by into the Channel of Wicklo) over
another lower hill, then are you in the best of the road, bring out your best
anchor in the southwest, against the blowing of the s. w. winds, which
sometimes come pouring down there very strong out of the s. w. over the high
land, and the other in the northeast. At low water the sands lie dry there
round about the road. Road by ^lanta^e


Men may alsoo anchor somewhat further in, at the north side of the sound,
right against a village called Klantarie in a pool, where at low water
remains 9 or 10 foot water: but round about the ship (as it is in most places
of the haven) it does fall altogether dry, so that there a ship has but even
room to wind up to and again. Men do moore there south southeast and n. n. w.
A, s. e. and n. w. Moon makes there the highest water.

If the ships that come there be any thing great, they must stay in Poelbegh,
close before the Town it is very shoaly, and falls at low water altogether
dry: with an ordinary tide men cannot come before the town with a ship that
draws 5 foot water, but with a spring tide with ships that draw 7 or 8 foot
water.

At the north side of the river, a little further out then the town, right over
against Ringsend, lies a little Island, within it is a fit place to make ships
clean.

The sands or banks that lie along this east Coast of Ireland from the
Tuskar unto Dalke, are on the outside, or on the east side very steep and
needle too, so that men may not come nearer them then in 24 and 25 fathom, in
20 fathom men are close by them, they are not deeper at some places then in one
fathom, or one fathom and a half: but at the north end by Dalke, about two
fathom and a half, and three fathom deep, all stony ground, and lie on the
off side along n. n. east, and s.s. west, at the nor^h end they lie about 8
English miles from the land. If you are bound for Dublin, Ma^k^ for (...)
w^^h^ut the banks
and will go without these sands, run then so far to the northwards, until you
can see the little Island (Irelands-eye) without the point of Houth or
Hedenhoo, run then right on to Houth or Hedenhoo, and then you shall take no
hurt of the north grounds.

Of the Tides and Courses of the streams.
Betwixt Corckbey, along the Coast before Waterford into the point of
Cornaroort, the Island falls along^t the Coast e. n. e. and the ebb w. s. w.

At W^terford an east and by north, and west and by south moon makes high
water.

Without the land in the fareway betwixt Silly and Ireland, a southwest and by
west moon makes high water.

In the channel or entrance of Washford, an east and west moon.

The flood runs there to the northwardes, after high water a half tide, and
the ebb contrariwise to the southwards, a half tide after low water, but not
so strong as the flood.

On the east Coasts of Ireland to the southwards of the bay of Dublin, a
southsoutheast and northnorthwest moon makes high water.

At Dublin a southeast and northwest moon.

The flood runs from the Tuskar without the banks along betwixt Ireland
and England northnortheast, and the ebb southsouthwest.

On the Coasts a southsoutheast and northnorthwest moon makes high water.

The flood comes here from the southwardes, and also from the northwards,
about the north part of Ireland, and meet one another about right against
Carlingford, where they stop one the other. The ebb contrariwise falls (to
the northwards of Carlingford) to the northwards, and (to the southwards of
Carlingford) to the southwards.

Of the Depths.
From Corckbey to the eastwards unto Waterford men may see the land in 24
fathom, the most part of the s. Coast of Ireland, men may see it in 35 and 40
fathom. Jn 35 fathom you shall not be far from the land, therefore come no
nearer Ireland by night then in 40 fathom.

The seventh Demonstration, Wherein is Delineated the north east Coast of
Ireland between Hedenhoo or Houth, to Hoornhed.
THe n. point of the Bay of Dublin called Houth, is round about clean, so that
a man may anchor round about it. To the northwards of it lie the Islands of
Irelands-eye Irelands-eye.
and Lambey Irelands-eye is the smallest, it lies betwixt the aforesaid point
Houth and Lambey: At the west side of it stands a little Chapel, right
against it, you may ride. At the s. end lies of a stony riffe which must be
avoided. Right over against that Island in the maine land lies a haven for
small ships, at a little town called Malcheall. Malcheall


Under Lambey Lambey
you may ride upon the n. side for a southerly wind, in 12 and 13 fathom, but
for a sea wind, you must shift, unto the west side by a Gentleman's house, and
anchor there, but it is not very good lying there, because always there
comes in a great sea.

About 6 leag. n. w. and by n. from Lambey, lies the haven of Drodagh, betwixt
them both (nearest Lambey) close by the land lie rocks, called the Skires.
About 2 miles to the northwards of Lambey lies a great rock called Rock a
Bill, you may run round about it on both the sides.

Drodagh Drodagh.
has a narrow crooked haven, which is not good to come into without a Pilot,
or some one that is well acquainted with it.

Four or 5 leagues to the northwards thereof lies the haven of Dondalk, which
is very shoale, and little used, at low water a man may go over a foot.

North and by west about 11 leagues from Lambey, seven leagues to the
northwards of Drodagh, and two leagues from Dondalk, lies the haven of
Carlingford: Carlingford.
the north point of that haven is somewhat foul and rocky, but you may go in
about it by your lead: the s. point is very foul with rocks and suncken rocks,
which you must shun, and run in by the northern shore: Some say that men
may run in through betwixt the rocks and the souther point with small ships,
but it is not without danger. When you are within the suncken rocks, you must
run over to the souther shore, and in along by it, until you come before
the town of Carlingford, and anchor there in six, seven, or eight fathom, so
shallow as you will; you may sail in upon the oase and save a ship without
anchor or Cables. Green-Castle Greene-Castle.
lies at the n. e. side of the haven, 2 miles from Carlingford.

About 7 leagues n. e. from Calingford, lies a point called S. John's point: S.
John's point.
betwixt both about half ways lies the mount of Carlingford, a high Mountain.
From S. John's point lies of a ledge of rocks, whereof you must take heed. A
great league to the northwards of S. John's point, lies Arglas, Arglas.
from thenceforth to the haven of Strangford it is 3 small leagues.

From the north point of the haven of Strangford, lies off a foul ledge of
Rocks. A little off from the south point lies a suncken rock, which at half
ebb comes above water. For to sail into this Haven, you must leave this
suncken Rock on the larboard side, and go to the northwards of it, but must
take good heed of the foresaid ledge at the north point. A man may also go in
through to the southwards of the foresaid suncken Rock, betwixt it and the
point (but to the northwards of it) is the best and the broadest Channel.
Somewhat further in lies also another suncken Rock at the northeast side,
that must be left on the starboard side in going in. When you come so far as
Audleys Castles, De Noord-oost zyde van YERLANDT Van Caap de Hoorn tot aen
Hedehde en als mede hoe to van Schotlandt gelegen is.
there you may anchor or run in about the point on the larboard side, and
anchor there under it.

About a league and a half to the northwards of Strangford lie the Rocks
Southrocke and Northrocke, of them read as follows.

From Strangford Haven to the Northwards lies the coast forth n.n.e. one
league unto a point which some do call the point of Arglas, others the point
or head of Molines; from thence falls away the coast unto the Bay of
Knockfergus northnorthwest.

By the foresaid point of Arglas or Cape of Molines, Point of Arglas. C. de Mo;
lines.
to wit, to the northwards of it, two little miles, lie two great rocks: the
southermost is called the Southrocke, Southrock.
it lies about two mile, to the Southwards of the Northermost, called the
Northrocke. Northrock.
From the south end of the southrocke lies a ledge of rocks at the least two
miles off, also one from the northeast point a great ways northeast off into
the sea. The north rock is a great plate of rocks, whereof many at high water
are under water. There goes also from it a foul ledge off unto the land, so
that a man may hardly sail through betwixt the rocks and the maine land,
except a man be extraordinary well acquainted. But betwixt the northrock and
the southrock goes a fair broad Sound through, where men may well turn too
and again, and at many places may anchor, it is all over good clean sandy
ground, 6, or 7, and 8 fathom deep.

From the east side of the southrocke unto the Islands at the east point of the
bay of Knockfergus, called Koppen, or Kopland Isles, the course is North
northwest or somewhat more northerly, about six leagues: for when men sail
from the east side of these Islands to the southwards, with a s.s.e. way, they
go far enough without the north and Southrocks. There betwixt them both lie
diverse more little Islands, rocks, and suncken rocks, and shoals, for the which
men must take good heed when they will come near by the shore.

The Kopland Isles lie about an English mile from the land, they are upon the
off side to seawards, clean, but from the inner side there goes off some
ledges and foul ground, in the midway there going through it is 5 and six
fathom deep, but it is best to go without, except for them that are well
acquainted. The n. point of Knockfergus, lies distant from the Copland Isles 3
or 4 leagues n.w. or somewhat northerly, for which a s.e. course from the north
point toward the fore said Islands, that goes far enough without them.

The bay of Knockfergus Bay of Knockfergus.
is a great broad Sound; About 3 leagues inwards in the Bay w. from Copland
Isles, is the road before Knockfergus, there is good anchor ground in 3 fathom
and a half. Somewhat more further out toward the n. point also on the n. side
of the bay stands a Castle, called Mousehils Castle, by it is a sandy bay,
where is good anchorage, as well for great ships as small, for the n. and the
n.w. winds, but a southwest wind makes a bad road in these places.

A little to the northwards of the North point of the bay of Knockfergus, lies
a little Island called Kow, Kow island.
from thence lies the Coast of Ireland forth northnorthwest, about 9 or 10
leagues unto the Islands of Raghleens. Betwixt them both lie the 9 Maids one
great league without the land, The Maids
and two great leagues to the northwards of the Bay of Knockfergus, they are
great Rocks, that lie but little above water, or low rocky little Islands, and
a multitude of rocks under water about them, that lie off so far to the north
north east, that men cannot come near them within 5 or six English miles.
There go some Creekes through the soul grounds, where men (for need) might
sail through, but it is no wisdom to go about it, when there is no need, and
that men can do better. Not very long since, there came a man (by night
unacquainted) there in, and ran through only upon the sight of the breaches
of the water, and got through without any hurt, but not without great fear and
danger. He that comes off from the fair Forland, must (at least) go South
east and by east, sor to run along clear of these foul grounds. From the
west side also lies off a little tail of a ledge of Rocks toward the land.
Further, it is there clean, that men may sail through there within, but men
must not come nearer the Maids, then about half channel betwixt them and the
maine, but the maine land so near as they will, which is both clean and
clear, with many Bays, where men may every where anchor, yet here and there
lie some Rocks, but they are all above water: There is nothing that can hurt
you, but men may easily see it.

A great league to the northwards of the north point of the Bay of Knock
fergus, and a half league south southwest from the Mayds, lies a haven called
Old-fliet Old fliet.
For to know it when men come from the Northwards, they shall see two flat
little Towers, the one somewhat higher then the other, like as if men saw a
ship with maine sail and foresayle, without top or toppe-sayles: these stand
upon the northside of the Bay.

At the south point lies a small round little Island or rock called the Knee,
Island Knee.
a special mark for to know this Bay; Men run in there amidst the channel.
But when you come from the southwards, and get sight of the little Island Knee,
then run in close about it.

From Old-fliet to the northwards unto fair Forland, the coast is very clean,
that you may sail close along by it, boldly without any fear, except you
run far off from land, without the foresaid Maids toward the Scottish
coast.

Fair Hid, or Fair Forland Fair Fotland.
is the outermost north east Point of the maine land of Ireland, and lies a
little to the southwards of the Island Rachleens, so that this point and the
east point of Rachleens lie near about south and north one from the other.

At Rachleens, or Fair Forland the north east point of Ireland, come Scotland
and Ireland nearest one to the other. The Rachleens is an Island that men may
sail round about, either to the Northwards or to the Southwards, as they will
according as it happens best convenient with wind and tide. At the southwest
side is a fair bay, where is good lying almost for all winds. When men come
from West it seems to the southwards of the Rachleens to be close without
any opening, because the eastermost point of Irelands Fair Forland, lies
somewhat further out, behind the Rachleens, but when they come nearer betwixt
them, shows it self open by little and little. On both sides are the shoares
flat and clean, so that men may anchor there where you will, either by the
coast of the maine land of Ireland, in 8 or 9 fathom, or in the bay under the
Jsland in clean sandy ground. Over against the Rachleens, close by the maine
land, lies another little high Island, called the Lambs Lambs Island.
or sheeps Island, to the southwardes of it betwixt it and the main, men may
not sail there about it, but betwixt it and the Island Rachleen it is broad
enough.

From the Rachleens unto the Skires Portrush, the course is w. s. w. distant 7
leag. About 2 leag. to the e. wards off it, in the maine land, lies Porto
Belletrie, a bad road for great ships, the ground is there foul and sharp.

Betwixt Porto Belletrie and Skires Portrush, nearest unto Skires Portrush, lie
the Chickens, Chickens.
these are suncken rocks, which may be sailed about on both sides, for to come
to anchor under Skires Portrush. Skires. Portrush.


The Skires Portrush is a rocky Island, it has on the south side a fair bay,
where you may lie in six and seven fathom, clean and sandy ground land-lockt
for all winds, except for the eastnortheast wind, which blows along the
shore there open in. For to come under this Island from the east, you must go
close along by the shore off the maine land, for to shun these foresaid
suncken rocks the Chickens. It is there all over clean and clear: or else if
you were minded to go without, or to the southward off the Chickens, for to
come under the Island, you must shun the East point of the Island, because of a
suncken rock that lies a little off from the east point of the Island. At the
northwest side of this bay is also a small narrow channel, where you may sail
through.

A little to the westwards of Skires Portrush lies the Bant-haven, Bant-haven.
there along you may sail up unto the new Town Colran, it is a bad channel
to come in, as well by reason of the strong freshoale that comes out, as also
because it is very shoale: with ships that draw 8 foot water, you must have
at least 3 quarters of the flood before you can go in.

Three leagues n. west and by west from Bant-haven, or west and by north from
Skires Portrush, lies the haven of Loughfoile, Loughfoyle.
before it, lies a great plate of sand called the Touns, which lies from the
west point of the haven a great ways to the northwardes off from the shore,
when the wind is out of the sea, it breaks very much upon it, with small
ships that draw little water, men may sail into Loughfoile haven at high water
to the southwardes of the Touns, betwixt the Touns and the souther-poynt,
called Magillions point; but it is there very uneven, and at full sea there
comes no more then eight foot water, but along to the westwards of the
Touns, it is very deep, men may sound about the Touns on the off side in four
fathom.

For to find the Channel that lies into the westwardes off the Touns,
(coming from the east, or along by the Touns) you must look out for a
little sandy Bay, that lies on the west side, even within the north-poynt of
the river under the high land; bring it so, that you may see it open of the
foresaid north-poynt, and sail in there upon, until you come by the land, and
then run in along by it southwest until you come right against
Greencastle. If you come from the west or the north, you may boldly without
fear run along the shore, and about the point upon your lead, without
coming near the town, you may see any thing that might do you hurt, coming
by Greencastle, there may you anchor so that you may see Withcastle without the
point of Green-castle, there you may lie within the Towns, sheltred for winds
out of the sea.

Road in Loughfoyle.
For to sail up from Green-Castle, you must run up along by the west shore
by your lead, and shun the little sands that lie here and there along that
side, until you come past With-castle, right against the three trees, there is
the ordinary road.

Betwixt Green-castle and With-castle nearest unto Green-castle goes a Creecke
ot Slencke through the grounds, unto the eastern shore, which is as deep or
deeper then the right fareway unto With-castle. When men come off from
Green-castle, they must take good heed not to go far off from the western
shore. lest they fall into that Creek.

How men shall sail from the foresaid road forth up unto the Town Derry,
they may perceive or mark by the card.

From Lough-foile-haven unto the Islands Enesterhul Islands Enesterhull.
(by some called Monsterhul) the course is northwest four or five leagues,
these are small black Islands or rocks, not very high above water, and lie a
little off the northermost point of Ireland, called Enistom, a high plain
land, and very good to know for him that has once seen it. Betwixt the
Islands and the point men may sail through, but not-without great danger for
them that are not very well acpuainted with it, because off much foul ground
and shoals that lie betwixt them both. Under the foresaid point Eniston, on the
west side, men may anchor for easterly winds, or else to stop the tide.

From the Islands Enesterhull unto Lough-Swilly, Lough-Swilly.
of some called Locksillie, the course is southwest 5 leagues, that is a fair
haven. For to sail in there: men must shun the west side, and go in along
by the casterne shore: The land about Lough-Swilly is the highest land of the
whole north coast of Ireland, and thereby it is also very good to know, for
those that (coming out off the north) do fall with the lands there abouts.

Four or five leagues westsouthwest, or somewhat westerly lies a large broad
haven, called Sheepeshave^, but it is at some places foul ground, within it
men may lie landlockt for all winds. The west point lies out, called Hornehead,
Hornehead.
or Cape de Horn, Cape de Horn.
upon it is a hill with two hommockes in fashion like two horns and there
after the point is named.

At the west side of this point, men may ride and anchor within the rocks for
easterly winds. Betwixt Lough-Swilly and sheepshaven lies also a Bay, where
men may anchor, but the ground is not very clean, and right against it in the
offing, half a league from the land, lies a ledge of rocks, which at high
water are under, and at low water lie above water, may (for need) run through
betwixt it and the land, but without it is best and surest.

The Coast of Scotland.
The haven or sound of Loughrean Loughgrean.
or Loockreen in Scotland by the poinr of Galloway, lies distant from Fair
Forland the n.e. point of Ireland, e.s.e. about eleven leagues, but the point
called Cantir, lies distant from Loockreen n.w. and s. e 9 leagu there betwixt
them both goes up a great broad sound northeast in, called Dunbritain Firth,
through which men sail up unto Glass kow in Scotland.

The sound of Lookreen you may sail in, Dubritaine Firth.
and a good ways you may turn in to and again for to anchor there within for
westerly wind, if you do come no nearer the Gores on either side then in
four fathom, you can take no hurt: You may anchor somewhat in, by the second
high point on the east shore in ten or 12 fathom.

About seven leagues to the northwards of the point of Galloway in the foresaid
great sound, lies a high sharp Island, clean round about, of fashion al most
like unto a pook of Hay, called Ailza, or Elzee, there you may boldly sail
round about, Elze Island.
it is there round about it, and close by it 18 fathom deep.

From Elzee northwards six leagues lies also another little Island, close by
the east side of the great Island Arren, called Lamblash, or Lamb-Isle,
Lamb-Isle.
clean also round about, there you may sail round about it, and anchor under
it for all winds in ten, twelve, or thirteen fathom, to wit, within it,
betwixt the Island and the great Island of Arren.

North and by east and northnortheast two great leagues from Lamb-Isle, lies
an Island by the point of the maineland called Commer-Isle; Commer-Jsle.
on the east side of it betwixt the Island and the maine land, you may sail
through in to a fair bay, Bay of Commer-Jsle.
where men are landlockt for all winds. and from thence may sail forth unto
Dunbrittaine, or into the river Glaskow. The foresaid Island Commer-Isle lies
from the Island Elzee, about north and by east. For knowledge of this Island,
when men come off from Elzee, or from the southwardes toward this Island, men
shall see a great castle on the east side of the maine about a great league to
the southwards of Commer-Isle, and also a little castle, a good ways to the
northwardes, close upon the water side, that stands right to the southwardes
of the Island Commers-Isle, or the sound that lies there into the eastwards of
it, upon the same Island stands alsoo a little castle close to the water
side. Run in betwixt the Island and the maine land, about northnortheast in,
and leave the Island a great cables length on the larboard side, and the main
land on the starboard side you must shun more, because of a great ledge that
lies off from it toward the Island, and somewhat more northerly. Having
gotten clear of the end of this ledge run then right toward the maine land
into the bay, or sound, and anchor there in ten fathom, right against a stone
house with an ore hard thereby, it shall be then a stearne your ship about 7
fathom deep, and there moore your ship well.

For to sail out of the Sound of Commer-Isle, toward Glaskow, To sail from
Commer Jsle to Glaskow.
go first northwest and by north unto by the point of the Island, that is, to
the westwards of you, and then north, along by it, then by little and little
more easterly, at length northeast, run so all along by the easterland,
without leaving of it, you shall not sail to come to the sound of Glaskow.
Coming by the point run close about by it first eastnortheast, east, and
east and by south, at least eastsoutheast, all along by the southern shore,
you shall then see a castle somewhat a head upon the souther-land, close upon
the water side, with two tuffes of trees upon the high land right eastsoutheast
from the castle; keep that foresaid castle between the tuffes of trees, and
sail in there upon, so shall you run right, along the deepest of the Creek,
there is at high water five fathom, and at low water three fathom. From the
north shore lies off a great shoale, which lies over the Sound more then two
third parts from the norther shore; toward the south shore it falls dry at
the lowest water, there fore men must shun the norther shore, and run
along by the souther shore. There stands a white castle upon the south
shore, right against that begin the foresaid sands. In the Creek it is soft
ground, but toward the sand the ground is hard, therefore when you feel by
your lead that it is somewhat hard, that is a token that you come too near the
shoals, sail then so forth upwards to Dunbrittaine, there lies a little
Island on the south shore, which is at low water fast to the Island when you
shall be past it about two Cables length, then anchor there in five at high
water.

A south and by west moon makes there the highest water.

Of the Tides and Courses of the streams,
At Dublin a southeast and northwest moon.

The flood comes here from the southwardes, and also from the northwardes,
about the north part of Ireland, and meet one another about right against
Carlingford, where they stopp one the other. The ebb contrariewise falls (to
the northwards off Carlingford) to the northwards, and (to the southwards of
Carlingford) to the southwardes.

On the coast of Ireland from the Southrock and Northrocke unto the Copland
Isles, a southsoutheast and northnorthwest moon makes full sea. But to the
northwardes of it a southeast moon.

On the Island off the Ragleens and Skires Portrush an eastsoutheast and
westnorthwest moon.

The slood comes there out of the west, and falls through betwixt Ireland
and Scotland: from the cape Cantir to the mull of Galloway, southsoutheast,
unto the Island Man, there floods out of the south and north do mere one to
the other. The ebb contrary wise falls along the coast northnorthwest
betwixt Ireland and Scotland to the westwards unto the Ocean sea.

At Englistoun in the Sound of Glaskow, a s.west moon makes full sea.

In the haven of Loughfoile an east and by s. and west and by north Moon
makes full sea. The flood comes there out of the west and northwest.

At the Islands Enesterhull, and in sheep haven an east and west Moon makes
full sea. The flood comes there out of the west.

Courses and Distances.

The Islands of Enesterhul at the northermost point of Ireland lies in 55
degrees and 10 or 12 minutes.

How these Lands do show themselves at Sea.
Sound point of Dublin Island Dalke. The point Houth. Island Lambey.

When a man comes from the southwards, thus shows the Bay of Dublin, with
the point Houth, and the Island Lambey to the northwards of it.

The Island Lambey shows it self thus, when it is from you northwest and by
north one league off.


Thus shows the land a little to the southwards of Carlingford, when this
high point is northwest from you about five leagues. He that will go into
Carlingford, must go in close by the shore.
The land to the northwards of Carlingford shows it self thus, when the
northermost point is north and by west from you 5 or 6 leagues.
S. John's point shows thus, when it is 4 leagues northwest from you.
Thus shows the point of Scotland over against the Bay Knockfergus, called
the mull of Galloway, when men sail along by it, 1 league without the land,
and that the northermost and the low point is n. e. from you, and the
southermost s. e. from you. Under the north point it is on both sides good
anchoring in 10 or 12 fathom, for southerly and easterly winds.
The Island Elzee in the great bay of Dunbrittain shows it self thus.
The Island Lamblash, or Lamb Isle on the e. side of the Island Arren shows
it self thus, being 2 leag. off from it.
The Island Commer Isle lying before the sound of Dunbrittaine, or Glaskow
shows it self thus.
Thus shows Cape Cantyr, when it is from you northwest and by west about 7 or
8 leagues.
Isle Man shows thus, when you are 4 leagues southeast from it.


The eighth Demonstration, In Which Are showed the northwest Coasts of Ireland,
from Hoornhead to Slynehead.
WEstnorthwest about two leagues from C. de Horn or Hornhead, lies the Island
Tore, to the southwards of it lie three Islands, called the Islands Balenesse,
men may sail through to the southwards of Tore Island, Tore Isle.
to wit,, betwixt Isle Tore, and the Island of Balenesse, Islands Balenesse.
and alsoo within the rocks.

From the Island Tore to the Isles of Aran, Islands of Aran.
the course is s. w. 6 or 7 leagues, betwixt them both, not far from Island
Aran, lie some high rocks, called the Staggs of Aran. Staggs of Aran.
Along all that coast betwixt Horne-head and the Islands of Aran, is good
anchor ground all over.

For to come to anchor under the Islands of Aran, coming out of the North,
run along by that great Island, leaving it on the starboard side, until
you be within it: go then toward the southwest, and anchor on the southeast
side, there is the road. Men may also anchor in the Islands over against it
toward the maine, in diverse places, and lie landlockt for all winds.

Upon the northwest point of Ireland, a good ways landwards in, lies a high
hill, of fashion al most like a Sugarloafe, which is seen in clear weather
before any other land, at least nine leagues at sea: When that hill lies east
and by south from you, then sail in in right with it, you shall not miss to
fall right with the great Island Aran.

Erom the Island Aran unto the point Telling-head, called by the Irish cape de
Telling, or Tellin; Cape de Telling-Telling-head.
the course is southsouthwest eight or nine leagues. Three or four leagues to
the northwards of C. de Telling lies an Island, called Raigleene borne.

At the Cape Telling lies a little Island, half a league from land, men may
sail through betwixt the Island and the cape, boldly without any danger.

To the southward of C. de Telling, to wit, betwixt the Cape and the Stagges of
Broadhaven, lies the land with a great bay, where in lie many good Havens, as
Tilling-haven, Kilbegh, Dungall, Ballashaven, Slego, Endrigo and Moye.

From the Cape of Telling unto Kilbeg Kilbegh.
lies the coast e.s.e. about four leagues: betwixt both, about one league and
a half from the cape, lies Telling-haven, a round bay with good sandy ground,
there may about 30 ships lie, west and southwest winds do blow there open
in, for all other winds men are there landlockt.

Kilbegh, or Kalebegh is also a fair round bay, but it is very narrow at the
coming in of it: When men are a little from the shore, it seems to be all
close withhout any opening. About half a league to the westwards of this bay,
aquarter of a league from the land, lies alittle Island, which is very low and
plain at both ends going plain down, that is a good mark to know this
foresaid bay, men may also sail through betwixt the Island and the maine, if
they will. When you come out of the west, De Noordwest zyde van YERLANDT.
Beginnende van Capo de Hoorn tot aen Schynes, often Slyne-head.
and are passed that Island, then go near the shore, which is clean and
clear, and go freely close aboard of it. until you shall see this bay open,
and then sail boldly in, without any fear, betwixt the two shoares there is
nothing (neither in the going in, neither within in the bay) that can hurt you,
if you do not sail upon the shore. When you shall be come in anchor where
you please in 5, 6, 7, or 8, fathom, so shoale or deep as you will, on the
north side within the bay stands a little Castle.

About a little league to the eastwards lies another Bay within some rocks,
called Mackswyns bay; Mackswyns bay
but it is not to go in, except men be very well acquainted, they must go
betwixt the rocks in until they be gotten in, there they may save a ship
without cable or anchor.

A great league to the southwards of Kilbegh, lies a long lying out point,
called S. John's point S. John's point.
right west from that point, a quarter, or a little half league, lies a great
Rock under water, whereupon the sea breaks with great noise. Betwixt that
rock, and the point of S. John's point, men may sail boldly through, it is
there clean and clear.

About 2 great leagues to the eastwardes of that foresaid point S. John's point,
lies the Haven of Dungall, Dungallhaven.
into the southwards. For to sail in there, you must first shun the easter
shore, which is very foul with dry plates and Rocks. When you are come right
against a little castle that stands on the north side, right against it lies
off a little riffe from the shore, that you must avoid also. And when you are
come about the point of that riffe, you must go over again to the northside,
for the south side is there slat and shoale Betwixt Saint John's point and
Dungall-haven along the coast is all over good anchor ground.

The Haven of Moy Moy.
has at the coming in a broad bay, in it lie some rocks. For to sail in
there, you must leave them all on the west side, that is, on the starboard
side, and run toward little sandy Island, that has at the north end a little
riffe, you must go into the westwards of it, and leave that Island on the
larboard side. Even within that foresaid Island lies another little round
green Island, that must be left on the starboard side, so soon as you shall be
right against it, you must let fall your anchor, for a little further it is
shoale and hard sandy ground, the greatest anchor must be brought toward that
foresaid long small Island, and the small anchor toward the little green
Island, it falls there at low water always dry. If you will go from thence
before the Town Moy, you must light your ship to 8 foot, for to come through
betwixt the long small Island, and the s. grounds, there is at high water with
an ordinary tide no more then 9 foot water; being come over the neck, you shall
come into a poole before the town Moy, there you may ride a float at a low
water. In the road against the Island it is 15 or 16 foot deep.

The Stagges of Broad-haven Staggs of Broad haven.
are Rocks that lie to the northwards a league or a league and a half a
seaboard of the point, to the northwards of Broad-haven.

Broad-haven lies in s. and by west, in the sound lie 3 or 4 rocks, these must
be left on the larboard side, and run in there along to the westwards, until
you come within the haven.

A great league to the westwards of Broad-haven lies an out point southwest
from the Staggs. From thence lies the coast along to black-rock s.s.w.
Black-rock Blackrock
is a great high black-rock with more other rocks by it, and lies from the
foresaid point s.s.w. distant about 6 leagues, and about a leag. northwest from
the out point Acklehead.

Acklehead Acklehead
is a very high point, and shows itself a far off like an Island with
agreat Saddle, thereby it is good to be known. Within this point lie also 2
exceeding high hills which together with the point men shall see first at sea
before any other part of the land, so that the point does show it self first
like three Islands. Men may sail through betwixt Acklehead and Blackrock;
coming from the southwardes men do leave Acklehead on starboard. and
Blackrock (with the rocks thereby a seaboard) on larboard, and the course lies
through betwixt them both n.n.e. and n. and by east unto the point of
Broad-haven, it is there large and wide.

To the n.wards and to the e. wards of Acklehead, lie diverse havens, where it
is good riding, a little to the n. wards of Aclehead, you may run into the w.
wards, betwixt the low land to the n. wards on the larboard side, and the high
land of Acklehead on the starboard side a great ways in and anchor in 7 and 8
fathom, landlockt for all winds and from thence may come out again to the n.
wards, or else may come out into the sea again to the s. wards round about the
land of Acklehead.

From Acklehead to Slynshead (by the seafaringmen called Twelve-pence:
Slynshead Twelve-pence.
because the land does show it self in 12, round hommocks) the course is
southwhat easterly 11. leagues, betwixt them both lie three Islands before a
great bay, the northermost or next to Acklehead is called Clear, this has a
high hill on the n. end that is very steep, and at the south end it is slat
going down. The second or middlemost is called Boche, wihin it is a road for
those that are bound to the southwards, where men may anchor in four fathom:
The southermost is called the Horse.

Betwixt Acklehead and Twelve-pence lies within in the land, a very high hill
like a Sugerlorfe, called S. Patricks-hil, Patricks-hil.
or by some Don Patrix that may be seen far at sea and shall be seen long,
altering it self by the cliffe land, as men sail along the coast to the
northwards, or to the southwards.

From Sleynshead, or Twelve-pence unto the sound of S. Gregory's, before the
bay of Galloway, the course is s.e. nine leagues.

The ninth Demonstration. Where in is Contained the Description of the west
Coast or point of Ireland from Slynehead to Corck Bey.
FRom Slynehead until you come before the Bay or great inlett of Galloway the
course is southeast nine leagues, where lie three great Islands, called the
Islands of Aron, ^slands of Aron.
the southermost is greatest, the channel betwixt the northermost and the
middlemost, is called the sound of S. Gregory, S. Grego^ies sound
which is on both sides clean without any foul ground, so that men may turn
in too and again from the one Island to the other, without fear of taking any
hurt. The north side of the middlemost Island is nothing else but fair steep
rocks: when you are come within the Islands, you must shun the middlemost,
because of a little riffe that lies off it.

Men may also sail to the northwards of the northhermost Island, into the
great Bay of Galloway, likewise also to the southwards of the southermost, to
wit, through betwixt the southermost Island, and the maine land, but that
Island is foul at the south end of it, and therefore you must run in along
close by the south shore, or at least leave two third parts of the channel
toward the Island, as well in sailing in as sailing out.

Somewhat within the Islands, on the south side lies a high black point,
called Blackhead, Blackhead
you must bear in to it, and along by it in, whether you come in at the
souther channel, or through S. Gregory's sound, or else in at the norther
channel, for the north side of the bay is foul and rocky. About 2. great
leagues n.e. from Black-head, lies an Island, called Motton-Ile, under it on
the east side you must anchor in a poole, in 5, or 6, fathom.

You cannot sail furthet up to the northwards into the River with ships, but
only with boats. A northeast and southwest moon makes there full sea, and it
flows there so strong in the baye, that the rocks which at low water are
above water, at high water you may sail over them; at low water of
spring-tydes, the grounds fall dry w.s. west from Motton-Isle, Motton-Isle.
a great league and a half off, most all rocky and foul ground.

When you sail from Blackhead toward Motten-Island you must take heed of the
north side, and edge over most toward the south side. About half ways
betwixt them both, lies a plate or ledge nearest the north side, you must go
in along by it to the southwards.

From the Bay of Galloway to Lupishead Lupishead.
at the n. point of the Haven of Limbrick, the course is s. s. west, 11 or 12.
leagues. About half ways betwixt them both, lies a little Island that is
foul round about with ledges of Rocks that lie of to seawards a league and a
half a seaboard the land.

To the southwards of the point Lupishead goes in the Haven of Limbrick. Haven
of Limbrick
Four leagues eastnortheast within the foresaid point, lies an Island, called
Seatrick, Seatrick.
you must sail along without it to the southwards, and leave it on the
larboard side in sailing up. At the east side of that Island is a good road.
About half ways betwixt that Island and Lupishead, lies a shoale which you
must shun, and sail along to the southwards of it. From the Island Seatrick
unto Limbrick, are more 12, or 13, leagues, first from thence to the Island
Quoine 4 or 5 leagues, there are two little Islands, you must sail close
along to the northwards of them: from thence eastnortheast unto a great rock,
called the great Beef, The great and little Beefrocks
and then southeast unto another great rock, called the little Beef.

When you are come before the town in the Haven, you must make fast on the
Castle with three or four Cables. For there goes a very strong tide as well
of flood as of ebb. An eastnortheast Moon makes there full sea.

From the Haven of Limbrick to the haven of Smerrick Smerrick
the course is southwest eight er nine leagues, betwixt them both lies the
coast with a gtear Bay, where in lie some little Islands, called the Hoggs.

A little to the eastwards of Smerrick lies Sinbrandonhil, Sinbrandonhill.
a very high hill, which lies in hight very much above all other lands
thereabouts, they that come out of the sea from the westwards, shall see that
hill first before any other Land, and thereby easily know it: Men may see it at
sea in the offing. 12. 14, and sometimes 16 leag. off, according as the weather
is clear.

Four or 5 leagues westsouthwest from Smerrick, a little off from the land lie
4, or 5, Islands, being high round Hills and rocks called the Blaskeys,
Blaskeyes
with some other rocks and little Islands about them. The Sound betwixt them
and the maine land, is called the Sound of Blaskeyes, lies through nearest
n.n.w. and s.s.e. He that is bound to the Northwards, may anchor at the south
side before the sound for westerly and northerly winds, and not be in-bayed
upon any lee shore: For if the wind shift easterly, he may either go
through the sound, or else: go about a Seaboard the Blaskeys. If the wind
shift westerly or southerly, he may run through the Sound, and further his
voyage. There runs through a very strong tide, as well of the flood as of
the ebb, which must be considered.

Six leagues to the southwards of the Blaskeyes lie three great Rocks called
the Skellocks, Skellocks.
the eastermost about a league, and the westermost two great leagues a seabord
the land, when you come from the southwards and see them first, they show like
sails of ships. Betwixt the Skelloekes and the Blaskeyes goes in a great
broad Bay deep into the land, called Dinglebay, Dinglebay.
with diverse havens in it.

About a league and a half from the Sound of Blaskeyes lies a haven called
Ventrie, a great league to the eastwardes of it another called Dingle, or
Dingle Couch, it lies north and by west in at the west point of it lies a
rock called the Crow, The Crow
which is clean round about, so that men may sail round about it on both
sides, without taking any hurt, at high water with spring tides, it flows
even under water. This haven of Dingle and the Skellockes, lie north east and
by north, and southwest and by south distant eight leagues.

Northeast from the Skellockes, southeast from the Sound of Blaskeyes, and
south and by east from the Ventrie, lies a haven at the east end of the Island
Valentia, called Begenny, Begenny Haven.
which lies eastsoutheast in, you must give the east point of the Islands a
birth off, because it is foul, and lies a good ways off: there lies also a
suncken rock on the Island side, which you must take heed of when you are come
within the entry of the haven, you must go east and by north unto the road;
which is right against a red cliffe that lies on the south side.

The Skellockes and the Cape Dorsey lie northwest and southeast, Six leagues a
sunder, betwixt them both goes in also a great broad Sound, northeast in,
wherein lie many Islands, havens and roads.

C. Dorsey
C. Dorsey is an Island within, which men sail and ride under. For to go in
there from the southwardes, you must give the east side a birth, that is, the
side of the maine land which is soul, and run in along by the side of the
Island, until you be come within, and anchor there.

Bull, Cow Calfe rocks.
Whithout the Cape Dorsy lie three great rocks, the outermost or the westermost
is called the Bull, the middlemost is called the Cow, and the other the Calfe,
they are clean round about, so that men may sail there through between them,
without fear of any danger, there is nothing that can hurt but men may see it.

About six leagues eastsoutheast from C. Dorsey lies the point Mizanhead,
Mizanhead.
betwixt them both goes in a great Bay or river deep into the land (with
diverse havens and roades) called the Bantry.

A great league to the northwards off Mizanhead, lies a point, Three Castles.
called the three Castlehead, upon it stands three flat Towers, but you-can
hardly see them except they be near the land, also a great league more to the
northwardes, lies a small point, called Sheepshead. Sheepshead.
Betwixt these two points goes in a great broad Bay, called Dounams Bay, there
is norhing to do nor to fetch, but it is a fit place too save ships, and all
over good anchor ground.

From Sheepshead to beerhaven, Beerhave^.
the course is north and by west, or somewhat westerly about two great leagues,
it goes in between an Island on the east side, and the main land toward C.
Dorsey on the west side, it is about a great musket shot Broad, the foresaid
Island on the east side is called the Island of Beer-haven and is about two
leagues long. For to fayl in there you must keeep the mid way, in the entry of
the haven it is clean, without any foul ground: after you are come in, there
stands on the larboard side a ruined castle, and a little further are two
little rivers, Road in Beerhaven
close one by the other, betweeen these 2, little rivers stand some
Fisherhouses. Men may sail into the foresaid little rivers, they are deep
enough, but commonly men do anchor before them, or by that fore said ruined
castle, or else somewhat further in, it is all over good anchoring, and clean
ground, except right against the foresaid little rivers, lie some rocks, about
the middle of the channel, which at high water are under, and at low waterlye
above water, these only must be shunned, but men may go on either side of
them. Somewhat further in the Bay stands another castle, called Oldcastle,
from thence men may sail along to the northwards of the Island Beer-haven,
and come out to the eastwardes into Bantry. The Sound on the north side of the
Island is large, broad clean, 13. 12, and ten fathom deep. The east point
of the Island is a sharp point, and very foul, there lies of a ledge of
rocks, where of some lie under water and some above water, at low water but the
side of the main is clear and clean. In this entry lie also 2 great rocks
high above water, but clean round about, men may run through between these
rocks, or to the southwards, betwixt them and the foresaid ledg of rocks or
also to the northwards along betwixt them and the maine land, as well in
coming in as in sailing out, there is no danger more then men may see.

From Beerhaven to the north point of the Island Whiddy, The Whiddy
lies the Bantry e.n.e. and northeast and by e. 6 or 7 leagues: over against
Beer-haven in the midst in the farreway, it is deep 40, 36, and 30 fathom,
within the Island, 15 and 16 fathom, but further in toward the Island Whiddy,
it is again 20 and 25 fathom deep: men may sail round about the Island
Whiddy, (which is about a league long) but to the northwards it is best.

For to sail in about to the northwards, or to the eastwardes, men may go in
close by the north or east point, but a little within the point, lies alittle
ledge of rocks, a little musket shot off from the shore, which at high water
lies under but at half ebb begins to come above water, that only is there
to be shunned, being passed that, you may anchor all over. About that foresaid
point lie two small Islands, by the greater men may sail along on both sides
of it, either within it or without it, until you come before a
Gentlemans-house which is white, upon the Island Whiddy, and anchor there
against it in 3 or 4 or 5 fathom, so deep or so shallow as men will, according
as men desire to ride near or far from the shore, it is there all over clean
ground.

He that will sail into the s. point of the Whiddy, For to sail in to the
southwards of Whiddy.
had need be very well acquainted it is there to the southwardes between the
Whiddy and the maine land, at most places foul and stony. From the west side
of the Whiddy, lie also some foul ground and rocks, somewhat off the Island to
seawards, some above, and some under water.

To the southwards of the Whiddy upon the maine land stands a Friery or
Abbey, The Abeby
called by the Irish the Abbey, right against it* is the common road, and it is
very good ground in 4, 5 or 6 fathom, according as you shall ride far or
near to the shore, to the northwards lies a little Island so low in the
midst, that at a spring tide the sea flows over, and devideth it in two.

A little league to the eastwards of the Abbey lies a little town upon a
little river called Balgobben. at high water men may go up there with their
boat, but at low water it falls dry.

A great league from the east point of the Whiddy, westnorthwest, lies a haven
called Longerf, Longerf
when you shall sail from the foresaid point toward it, you shall meet
right in the fareway, about half ways over a great rock, which men may sail
about on both sides, but it is best on the off-side is clean and clear, but
on the inner-side lies some foul ground. He that will sail through on the
inner-side, had need to be very well acquainted. The foresaid haven of Long-erf
lies n. n. west: Even within it in the entrance on the starboard side, lies
some foul ground, which at low water (at the Spring tides) may be seen dry,
these must beshunned, or else it is there within all over good anchoring and
good ground, there is no more danger, but men may see it.

When a man is near the Island Whiddy, about the midst of the Bay, he cannot
see the land without the Island Beerhaven on the west side of the Bay, because
it falls a way so along to the westwardes.

From Mizanhead unto C. Clear, the course is east and by south distant seven
leagues. About three leagues within or to the eastwards of Mizanhead, northwest
from C. Clear, lies a haven called Croock-haven. Grooke-haven.
He that comes from the east, and is bound in there, must run along by C.
Clear, up about it to the northwards, so far until het may see through into
sea to the northwards of the Island of C. Clear, as through a hole, and set
then his course westnorthwest, keeping that foresaid hole (to the northwardes
of C. Clear) open, then he shall fall right with Crookhaven, which lies in w.
s. west. And there he may anchor before the little twon in three fathom, and
two fathom and a half. It was wont heretofore to be deeper there, but it is
spoiled most by casting of ballast, men may also anchor further out then before
the town, there it is deeper, and all over clean ground.

Two little leagues west and by south from C. Clear, Fastney-rock.
lies a high steep rock laone in the sea* called Fastney, which shows at
first sight iike unto a sail, north 3, or 4, leagues, from this rock lies a
haven, called School-haven. School-haven.


A little to the eastwardes of the Island of Cape Clear lies another Island,
called Isle Sherk. Isle Sherk.
To the eastwards off it, betwixt that Island and the maine land goes in a
haven called Baltemoore haven: It is somewhat narrow at the mouth of the haven,
but within the mouth of the haven, but within the mouth of the haven it is
large and broad, there may you anchor on both sides where you will, and lie
land-lockt for all winds. On the west side within the haven stands a Friery,
close before it you may anchor in five and 6 fathom? in the midst of the
haven, it is six and seven fathom deep. A little to the northwardes of the
foresaid Friery stands a castle upon a point. In the mouth of the haven lies
a suncken rock, nearest to the east side, and within in the midst of the
haven lies a rock, which at high water lies under, and at low water lies
above water, there is nothing else that can hurt. A little to the eastwardes
without the haven, lies another rock six or 7 ships lengths from the shore.

For to sail through within the Islands of C. Clear.
To the northwards of the Island of the Isle Skercke, men may go to the
westwards through betwixt Isle Shercke, and the Island Spain, and come out
again into sea by C. Clear, but it is to be done only with small shipping,
and yet not without danger. Betwixt Isle Sherke and Spain, is at half flood
not more then 12 or thirteen foot water. At diverse other places betwixt these
Islands, it is rocky and shoale, so that it is not good to go through within,
except men be very well acquainted, and yet at high water and spring tides.

A little league too the eastwards of Baltemoore lie the Stagges, Staggs.
an English mile from the shore, they are five or six high steep rocks.
When men come from the eastwards along by the shore, and get first sight of
them, they are like unto some spirie towers together, men may sail through
betwixt them and the maine land, it is there large and broad enough.

Northeast about 2 leagues from the foresaid Staggs, lies Castle-haven,
Castle-Haven.
without it on the east side lies a little Island, you must leave it on
starboard side in sailing in, and another little flat Island on the larboard
side, that lies so close to the land, that at low water men may go dry foot
over from it to the maine land. Whithin the haven stands a little Chapel,
when you will sail in there, you must run in right with it, close along by
the foresaid little Island on the east side: When you are come in, thwart of
the Chapel, you shall see a Castle on the west side, over against that Castle
you may anchor in 12 fathom.

From Castle-haven unto the Oldhead, the coast lies most eastnortheast and w.
s. west, but C. Clear and the Oldhead lie northeast and by east, and e. n.
east distant 14 leagues.

About half ways betwixt Castle-haven and the Oldhead lies a high point,
called by the Irish, Kedonetedo, Kedonetedo.
there by it on the west side is a good haven, called Clandore: Clandore.
For to sail in there, you must run in along close aboard by that foresaid
high land on the east side; for to shun a rane of rocks that lies on the w.
side, and lies off somewhat toward the east side, when you are come in, you
may anchor before a Castle in 5, or 7 fathom.

The Oldhead or C. de Velho, is a point that lies out far without the other
land, the outermost south end of it is very high and steep, when you are come
along the shore from the east or from the west, and see it first, it seems
to be an Island, upon the top of it stands a ruined castle with three
Towers, whereof the middlemost is the highest. On both sides of this outlying
point men may anchor so deep or shoale as they will.

About two leagues north and by east from that point lies the haven of
Kinsale, Kinsale.
lying in northnortheast, you may sail in there, keeping the middle of the
channel, there is no danger, neither without not in the harbors mouth, but
one suncken rock close by the east point. When you come in from the Oldhead, or
from the southwardes, and you keep an old ruined castle (that stands within
the haven on the east side) even without the Innermost east point of the haven,
then you shall not come near that rock to take any hurt of it. About a great
half league to the eastwardes or the havens mouth, lie two great black rocks,
the one somewhat further from the shore then the other. When you come from the
eastwardes, and you will go in close about the east point, and you keep the
southermost (that is the greatest) right on the east point, then you shall go
through betwixt the suncken rock and the point: But if you keep the
northermost (or the smallest) a little without the foresaid point, so long
until you have brought the foresaid old ruined Castle, without the innermost
point, then you shall go along without it, and then in the midst of the
channel along by the eastern shore. A little past that foresaid old ruined
Castle, stands a Castle on the west side upon a point, there lies off a
shoale, which must be shunned, and therefore you must keep close along by the
easter shore, until you be gotten about the shoale of the Castle, and then
westwardes up unto the Kay of Kinsale, there you may anchor in eight or nine
fathom, and lie landlockt for all winds. The town Kinsale lies a little to
the northwardes in a bay, where it is oasie soft ground part where of falls
dry at low water.

Four leagues to the eastwardes of Kinsale, lies the haven Corck, betwixt
both about a league to the westwardes of Corck, Corck.
you shall see (sailing along the coast) two steep hommockes like Towers in
the land, not far one from the other: these are notable marks for to know the
coast. When you are thwart of the eastermost, you may see the havens mouth of
Corck, that lies in n. northwest; within it is wide and broad, and goes up
into the land with a broad river. On the east side, somewhat within is a point,
where lies off a ledge of rocks, which must be shunned. There over against on
the west side, somewhat far in, lies another point with an old ruined
castle, there also lies off a shoale, to the northwardes of it, men go about
to Corck. Within that Castle lies a little tide haven in a sandy Bay. Within
the haven lies an Island, where men do sail round about, and at the south
side there of may ride. It is in this Haven of Corck at low water, 7, 8 or ten
fathom deep.

A little without the east point stands an old ruined Castle upon the low
land, and somewhat further eastward, a square Tower in a valley. A league to
the eastwards of the havens mouth stands a Tower upon a high point, close to
the water side, with ten or twelve thatcht houses by it More over, a league
futher east, by a smooth point, lies a long rock grown about with green,
upon the east side of that point stands a flat tower, further, it is to the
eastwards all low land, unto the point of Jochul.

The second part of the LIGHTNING COLUMN, OR SEA MIRROR. THE THIRD BOOK, Of
the WESTERN NAVIGATION Containing The description of France, Biscay, Gallissia
Portugal, and Algarve, from Heyssant to the Straights of Gibralter.
The first Demonstration. Where in Are showed the coasts of France, from Ushant
to the Island of Bell, Jsle or Boelin.
THe Four and Ushant Ushant.
lie westsouthwest and eastnortheast distant two great leagues. Ushand shows
it self at sea at the south-end low, and at the north-end going up sloping,
upon the midst of it stands a little flat Tower, by which marks it is easy
to be known.

For to sail through within Ushant, the course from the Fourne to S. Matthews
point is s. s. e. 4 leag. At the point of the Four lie two rows of little
Rocks, and to the southwards of them along the Coast lie three other heaps
of rocks, each of them about an English mile one from the other: run along
within two Cables lengths by the foresaid rocks at the point, which is much
nearer the east side, or the maine land, then Ushant, for to shun the norther
Haghels, Haghels.
which do lie betwixt Ushant and the foresaid rocks or Ovens, or else if you
keep S. Matthewes Abbey in the low valley to the eastwards of Conoort, and
sail so right with it, then you run through nearest the east side, and in the
midst of the channel, betwixt the foul ground and the Rocks, until you
come thwart of Blanck-bay, Blankbay.
or near Conquets-oort, there stands a mill upon the high land alone, when
it is east from you, then the souther Haghels souther Hagels.
lie west and by north from you, and the norther Haghels Norther Haghels.
northwest and by west: there is also a high flat piece of land, a little to
the Abbey of S. Matthewes, the top if it being even and plain, like unto a
long plain house, when that comes even without the point Conquets-oort, and
the foresaid mill be east and by south, and eastsoutheast from you, then lie
the north Haghels west and by south from you, so that when the foresaid mill is
east thwart from you, then are also the Haghels west thwart from you. When
Halman Halman.
or Hayman hill (that is a high rock lying at the east end of Ushant) comes
over the northwest end of the northermost Mollens, by the French called
Cheminees, then are you also thwart of the Haghels.

He that must turn to windwards from the Fourne toward Conquer, or S.
Matthews point, let him make use of these marks: In the point of Conquet
haven, or Conquets oort, Conquets oort.
are two valleys, the one is great, that is the westermost, and one little that
is the eastermost, in manner as is here pourtrayed.

S. Matthews Cloister Conquets oort.


When you run over to the eastwards toward the land, and that the Abbey of
Saint Matthewes comes a Capstane bars length to the eastwards off the
smallest valley, according as is showed in this figure, then it is time to cast
about: and when you run over to the westwards toward Ushant, and that the
foresaid Abbey off S. Matthewes comes a little without the point off Conquet
Haven, you must also cast about, for when the foresaid Abbey comes two
ships lengths without the foresaid point then are you close by the Haghels.
The Norther and the Souther Haghels lie a bout a shot of a cast piece distant
one from the other.

Two or three Cables lengths thwar ttfrom the point off Conquet haven, or
Conquets-oort to seawards lies a sunckenrock, which with a spring tide comes
above water, called the Vintner, The Vintner.
by the French le Bell. For to avoid it coming from the northwards, or from
the Fourne, and being come from the foresaid marks (of S. Matthews Abbey in
the great valley of Conquets-oort) unto close by Conquets-oort, then run close
about by it, along within a Cables length of the point, or keep the Abbey of
S. Matthewes even without the point of Conquet-oort, and so close about it,
within a cables length, as before is said, and then you shall leave the Vintner
a Cables length or two on the starboard side of you, and can take no hurt of it.

When the little Church upon the point off Conquets-oort is east from you, then
is the Vintner west right thwart from you, or else when that the Souther-houses
off Conquet, begin to come without, or to the point off Conquet, then you
have also the Vintner upon you side, west and west and by south from you, a
little shot off a cast piece.

If you sail into Conquet-haven, Conquet-haven.
then run about the point within a cables length, as is before said, until
you see the haven open, then you come against the Fenestiers, Fenestiers
which are rocks that lie off about a Cables length from the East land of
Conquet-haven under water. For to avoid them, run along by the norther
shore, until you come within the Hav^^. Betwixt the Fenestiers and the blanck
Moines Blanck Moines.
(that are rocks by Saint Matthewes point) is a good Road under the Abbey of
S. Matthewes, as well for them that are bound to the northwards as to the
southwards. If you will go into this road coming from Conquets-oort, then run
right with the blanck Moines, until that the Abbey of Saint Matthewes be
eastsoutheast from you, sail then toward it until you come before the Abbey,
and anchor there in 6 or 7 fathom.

About a league to the eastwards of S. Matthewes point, toward Breast, lies a
suncken rock, about hal^e a shot of a cast piece from the north shore. If you
will sail into Brestwater, then go from S. Matthewes point away east and by
south, and eastsoutheast, and keep the north-end of the Southermost Mollens,
without S. Matthewes point, so long, until that the mill upon the north-land
come to the northwards of the trees, then you sail along to the southwards
of the foresaid rock, and so doing, you can take no hurt off it, but if you
bring the south end of the Mollens near or to S. Matthewes point, you shall
not fail to sail upon it.

For to sail to the northwards of the foresaid Rock, you must run from S.
Matthewes point along by the North-land, and keep the southermost Mollens
hidden behind the great Rock that lies off from S. Matthews point, and sail
then right with the west point of Bartrams bay, until that the foresaid mill
standing upon the North-land, comes to be northwest and by north from you,
and the trees stand northnorthwest from you, then shall you be past the
foresaid Rock, but to run along to the southwards of it, is best and
broadest. For to sail forth along to Breast (being past the foresaid rock)
you must run forth within two cables lengths along by the north shore. A
little within the east point off Cordon, or Claesdownes, lies a rane off
Rocks, about the midst of the channel in the mouth of Brest-water, which at
low water lie above water, and at high water are under water, called the
Baginne, Baginne.
you may run along on both sides off it, but to the northwards of it, is
best, when the south point of Brestwater comes over the point off Crodan,
then are you thwart of the foresaid Bagyne, which lies about two cables
lengths from the north shore, run along to the northwards of it: When the
Breast comes without the point, sail then so right to it, you must anchor
there with an anchor to seawards in eight or nine fathom, and with a cable a
shore fast on a tree: When you come within the Bagyne, you may edge up to the
eastwards, or to the southwards before the river of Landerneau or Lefou, Lefou.
and anchor there under the south-land, in ten, twelve, or thirteen fathom.
Before the little town old Croidan. Brest-watet, or the river of Landerneau,
lies in most eastnortheast, and it is Pilots water, he that is bound in
there, may take a Pilot to bring him in where he desires to be: It flows
there with an ordinary tide, three fathom up and down, a southwest and by
west, and northeast and by east moon makes there full sea.

If you come to anchor within Breast, you must pay for anchoringe ten soubs, and
for it you shall get a ticket off freedom. If it should happen that you should
loose your ship upon Britaigne, you might there with challenge your goods,
else they are unfree.

Bartrams bay ^artrams-^^y.
lies about two leagues to the eastwards of S. Matthewes point, a little
league past the foresaid suncken rock, there is good anchoring for a north, and
northeast wind in 10 and 11 fathom.

Over against Bartrams bay lies Croidan Croidan.
or Claesdownes from S. Matthewes point, southeast distant about 3 leagues, it
is a great bay. For to sail from S. Matthewes point to Croidan, you must keep
the southermost Mullens even without the black Moines (that are the Rock
without S. Matthewes point) and go away east and by south, and e.s.e. until
you come before the bay, and may see open into it, then you shall see a
Chapel, or little Church stand upon a chindle, run in right with it, anchor
thereabouts, in 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, fathom, there is the best road.

The Mullens Mullens.
are the rocks which lie there to the southwards of Ushant, and to the
westwards from Saint Mathews point. Betwixt them and Ushant lies a channel
northeast and southwest through, which is in different large and broad, and
deep enough, there remains at low water 6, and 7, fathom water. He that
comes from the northwards, and cannot sail a weather of Ushant and the
Mullens, by reason of the flood may run through here, or he that comes out of
the sea, and with northerly winds, cannot sail a weather off Ushant, may with
a flood run through here, and so further his voyage, when men run through
here, either in or out, and keep the middle of the channel betwixt both lands
they can take no hurt.

From S. Mathews point to the race of Fontenay, or the Keyser and Lavender, the
course is south and by e. 6 leagues, betwixt them both lie diverse, rocks where
of men must take good heed, as the Hen with the Chickens, the Collier, the
Falconers, Scheminckelborrowes and other more. The Hen Hen
with the Chickens, Chickens
and the middlemost Falconer or Foukenisse, lie from S. Mathewes point s.e. and
by east distant a league and a half, but the Collier lies from S. Mathewes
point s.s.e. also a league and a half.

The Falconers, Falkoners
or Foukenessen lie from the west Point of Croidan about w.s.w. an English
mile. The innermost or southermost Falconer The southermost Falconers
lies from the northermost s.s.e. about a half league, or two shots off a
cast piece, and from Croidan s.w. and by south, and is coverd at high water.
North n.e. a cables length from it, lies another suncken Rock, which at low
water may even be seen. To the westwards of the northermost Falconer lies
also a suncken rock which at low water may even be seen.

The Hen The Hen
lies from the Falconers w.s.w. about 2 cables lengths, or a shot off a cast
piece, it is a round sharp rock, it is round about it deep and clean, in 6
and 7 fathom. The Chickens Chickens.
are two sharp little rocks, which at low water may even be seen, and lie
about the shot off a Base northnorthwest from the Hen, and west from the
northermost Falconer.

The Scheminkel broughs Scheminkelboroughs.
lie to the southwards off the Falkoners, men may run through betwixt them in
ten fathom, to the point of Croidan, there is good road and anchor ground.

If you will sail from S. Matthewes point to the Race of Fontenay, you must
go away south and by east, and bring the mill off Fenestiers, which stands
upon the east point of Conquet-haven, over the point off Saint Matthewes, a
little to the westwards off the Abbey, and keep them so standing so long as
you can see them, and you shall not come to near the foresaid Rocks, to take
any hurt off them. When as then you come to the Keyser and Keyserinne, first
give the Keyser Keyser
a birth, because off some suncken Rocks which lie off from the East side of
it under water. From the southwest side of the Lavender runs off Lavender
Race off
a soul ledge of rocks, called the Calfe, there the tide falls very strong
over it, with very great rippeling. This Channel off the Race of Fontenay,
Fonteney
lies through betwixt the Keyser and Lavender s.s.w. and n.n.east He that will
sail through here, must be very careful to cast his tides well, for it runs
most thwart over this Race, so that with a southwest wind, and an outfall or
ebb, and also with calmes, it is very dangerous to come into this Race.

A little to the southwards of the Keyser, lies the east end of the Seames,
Seam^s.
and lie from thence at least three or four leagues w.n.w. into sea. A great
league northwest from the west point off the Seames, lies a suncken ^ock,
where of men must take heed.

And westsouthwest about two leagues from the Seames, lies a row of rocks,
like a bancke, whereupon it is not deeper then seven fathom, but betwixt the
rocks and the Seams, it is 50 fathom deep.

Betwixt the Seames and Ushant the broad sound Broad-sound.
lies in e.n.e. to S. Matthewes point, and from S. Matthewes point w.s.w. 5
leagues into sea.

To the eastwards of Fontenay, or the Lavender, lies the Frieze Bay, Friese bay
there men may anchor for a southeast and east wind, in good anchor ground.

To the eastwards of the Frieze Bay, lies Boldavids Bay Boldavids Bay.
a broad deep sound, lying into the land east northeast. At the e. side of that
haven lie 2 little Islands or Rocks, where men may anchor round about them, and
lie sheltred for all winds.

From the Race of Fontenay to the Pens, the course is southeast somewhat
easterly about 10 or 11 leagues, betwixt them both lies Oldyarne, Oldyarne
a good Haven, about 7 leagues east southeast from Fontenay. Thwart before the
entry of it lies a bank where men may run about it on both sides in 6 fathom.

The south point of this Haven is flat, therefore run in along by the north
point, there is at low water not less then 3 fathom depth. From Oldyarne to
the Pens it is s.e. and by south.

If you will anchor before Port Kapstand, you must anchor in 12 or 13 fathom,
before the village that stands upon the high land, about half ways betwixt
the point of the Race, and the great sand-bay of Oldyarn, where the little
sharp Tower does stand, the point of the Race shall then lie from you about
northnorthwest, and you shall then lie a great half league from the land,
further off from the shore it is rocky and foul ground, as some say. There
have some nevertheless come to anchor there by night in 3 or 4 leagues from
the shore in 25 fathom, but have not received any hurt neither of cables nor
anchors.

The west end of the Seames, and the Pens, lie southeast and by east, and
northwest and by west, distant about 13 leagues.

The knowledge of the land betwixt Fontenay and Oldyarne, are two round hills,
which men do call the sheets, Sheet.
or Slaeplakens, to the westwards of them stand two Mills. It is a very ragged
point, and by these foresaid marks very good to be known. Men may see them
without the Seames in 55 fathom.

From Oldyarne to the Pens lies the coast southeast and by south 5 leagues.

The Pens The Pens
are very easy to be known, for him that has seen them once: upon the
southeast end stands a thick flat Tower; a little to the westwards of it
stands a sharp tower, and somewhat more to the east wards against the high
land, stands a village apprearing like a castle, upon the east side there of
stands a flat tower, and there close to the land lie 2 great rocks.

The pens lie off from the maine land, southeast two leagues into the sea.
For to sail in there, you must come in there from the eastwards, and run
along by the strand of the maine land, leaving all the rocks on the larboard
side, until that you come to a great rock, which you must leave on the
starboard side, and run about to the southwards of it (being past it, edge
within it up toward the Northwest, and you may anchor there a little within,
in three fathom at low water, lying there, you can see no sea, but at high
water the sea comes very much tumbling in through the Rocks: You may go away
from thence at high water southeast through the Rocks into sea, but you must
take very good heed, because it is there full of Rocks where of some are above
water, and some under water. Without the foresaid great Rock in the coming in
of this haven, it is at least ten fathom deep, so that for need men might well
save a great ship there.

From the Pens to the Glannons Glanons.
or Glenant, Glenant.
the course is e.s.e. with that course you shall run along to the southwards
of them. Within the Glanons lies a Haven, called Binds, Bindet.
at the east point of that Haven it is full of rocks. For to sail in there,
you must take heed unto these marks: there stand two Mills far within the
land, bring the eastermost of the 2 over a little castle that stands upon a
point within the Haven, and run in, keeping them so n. and n. e. and by east
in, and then you cannot take hurt on neither of both shoares, and being come
within the haven, anchor before the Town.

A league southwest from Gloylend or Glenant, by the Dutchmen, called the
easter-Penmarkes, lies a great Rock under water, but is good to be espied, in
regard the sea always breaks upon it; as well within as without this Rock it
is 40 fathom deep.

When you come of from the Pens, with an e.s.e. course, you shall run along
far enough to the southwards of it. About 2 leagues the eastwards of Glenant,
lie the Islands of Muttons, Moutons-Jslands.
by the French called Isles aux Moutons, you may sail through betwixt them and
the main land, unto Groy or Blavet, also you may anchor within them in 10 or 12
fathom, betwixt the land and the foresaid Islands, which are clean upon the
north side.

Betwixt the Island Mutton and Glenant lies a rock, for to avoid it (for them
which will sail through there betwixt them) they must leave one third part of
the channel toward Glenant, and the other two third parts toward Mutton, and
then they may boldly run through there without fear.

From Mutton to the Island Groy Groy.
the course is east and by south, upon the outer side of Groy stand 3 or 4
mills, the east end of it goes steep down, and the west end sloping and flat
down, thereby it is good to be known. Under Groy is good anchoring for a s.w.
wind in six or seven fathom: Under the n.e. point also is a good road for a
w.s.w. and n.w. wind, there is very good anchor-ground. At the s.w. end
runs off a foul ledge, where of men must take good heed.

Within the Island Groy lies the Haven of Blavet, Blavet.
which lies in about northwest in 4 and 5 fathom. Upon the west side of this
haven stands a high sharp Tower called Quinperly, from the east point
runs off a great ledge of rocks, called the Baers, within it on the east
side of the entry of the Haven lie two suncken Rocks, also on the west side a
Rock with a hole, which at half ebb is uncovered, whereof men must take very
good heed in the coming in; Men run in along by the west land, for to eschew
the foresaid suncken rock and foul grounds. The marks for to sail in there
are these, there lies a little Island within in the midst of the haven,
which you may see when you are without the Haven. To the eastwards of that
little Island upon the maine land, stands an Abbey; bring that Abbey right to
the east point of the haven, which lies within the Baers, and sail in with
it, until you come thwart of the east point within the Baers, and run in
about by it: being within it, there it is wide and broad, you may anchor there
before the foresaid little Island in 5 or 6 fathom, there it is at low water 3
or 4 fathom deep, or else men commonly run in about, by the point, until
they come in the oaze.

From the Pens unto Bell-Isle, the course is eastsoutheast twenty leagues,
but from Groy to Bell-Isle it is souhsoutheast five leagues. Bell-Isle has at
the northwest end a steep point, lying out with a great saddle, thereabouts
stand also some little houses, and the end goes very steep down.

When as Bell-Isle lies n.n.e. from you, Road to know Bell-Isle.
the west end shows it self in three parts: the westermost where of is a
great rock, which flows at a very high water almost under at the east end
there divides it self off also a great rock: by these foresaid marks it is
indifferent well to be known, men may see Bell-Isle out of the sea in 55
fathom. At the s. side lie off many rocks and little Islands.

If you will seek a road under Bell-Jsle, Road un^^r Bell-^^le.
then you must give the Northwest end a good birth, off from it lies a suncken
rock under water, a good ways from the land: being come within it, sail then
within two Cables lengths along by the land, within a Base shot about by the
North point, until you come before the village with the little sharp Tower,
called Paul's, there stands a castle upon the point to the westwards of the
foresaid little Tower, anchor within that point in nine or ten fathom, there
you shall lie landlockt for a south, southwest and northwest wind. If it blow
more northerly, you must shift, and run before the east end (which is about
half a league broad) and anchor there in ten or eleven f^thom. This Island
lies about southeast and northwest according as the wind blows. men do
shift there from one road to another, it is there every where good rid^ng.

Within the Island Bell-Jsle, to wit, betwixt Bell-Isle, and the maine land lie
many little Islands, where at diverse p^aces men may sail through to the Rivers
of Vannes, or Morbeam, Roche, Barnard, and the river of Nants, called the
Lo^re. Of these Islands are three the principal, the east^^most is called the
Cardinal, ^^ ^^nal
the east point where of, and the e. point of Bell-Isle lie one from the ^^he^
direct east and by north, and w. and by south about 4 leagues. The middlemost
is called by some also the Cardinal, or else together with the eastermost the
Cardinals. This has a good Haven on the north side, going in by a great Rock.
^^ndbank
From the n.w. point of the northermost, runs a sandy strand unto the maine
land, against the point betwixt Blavet and Morbeam, so that men cannot sail
there betwixt that and the maine, but at high water it is most covered, and at
low water it lies most dry, at low water men may go over there on foot from
the Island to the maine land.

He that comes from the west, and is bound to Morbeam, Roche Barnard, or
other places thereabout, must run to the southwards of it, if the will not
sail about to the southwards of Bell-Isle, he may sail through betwixt the
northermost and the middlemost Island, and also he may sail through betwixt
Bell-Isle and the foresaid Islands, about to the eastwards of the Cardinal.
The channel there betwixt them both, is about a league broad and clean, it
lies through e.s.e. and by east, men may run along by the Cardinals either
by night or by day, in 8, 9, and 10 fathom, all clean sandy ground.

For to sail through betwixt the weste^most, which is fast at the north end
with the strand to the maine land, and the middlemost Island, the course is
from the n.w. e d of Bell-Isle e.n.e. A little from the east end of the
foresaid westermost Island, lies a great round rock, which you must leave on
the larboard side, and run along by it, within two or three Cables lengths,
and then you shall leave on the starboard side to seawards of you a g eat many
rocks, some above and some under water, which lie toward the other Islands,
which you must give a greater birth to, then to the foresaid great rock. From
this foresaid channel to the river of Morbeam, or S. Jolms, the course is n.e.
or n.e. and by e. or else if you run about to the eastwards of the Cardinal, and
are bound to Morbeam, then go away from the east point of the Cardinal first
n.w. and n.n.w. and you shall have then in that fareway 8, and 9, fathom depth,
go then by little and little more northerly right with the point, which lies
to the westwards of S. Jolms, there runs off the said point of S. Jolms, a
ledge or riffe of rocks almost a half league into the sea, which you must
give the west point a birth, to and run in along by the east shore, which is
flat, and lies from the Tower of S. Jolm to the River of Vannes n. w. and s.e.
but you must be sure to reckon your tide well in this Channel, for it runs
in and out the River of Vannes so strong that you cannot sail in with an ebb,
although it blow a storm, likewise does it to the contrary with the flood,
therefore you must sail in there with a still water. At the middle point where
the river does devide it self in two (whereof the one runs to Vannes, and
the other, to Auray) lie many rocks, the most part under water, which you leave
on the starboard side when you are bound to Morbeam or Auray, and on the
larboard side when you are bound to Vannes when you are come from so far
within, that the Tower of Morbeam is w. from you anchor there in the middlest
of the haven, in 9 fathom, and then shall Auray the innermost little Tower lie
n.n.w. from you, and the other little Tower north and by e. but the point of
Mayland e.s.e. The west shore thwart of it is very steep, oasie and soft, you
can take no hurt of it, although you sailed right against it.

The east point of the Cardinal, and the entering off the Haven of Morbeam lie
northnorthwest and s.s.e. one from the other.

Of the Tides and Courses of the streams.
Without Ushant a westsouthwest and eastnortheast moon, and within the Trade a
southwest and by west moon makes full sea.

At S. Matthewes point, a southwest and northeast Moon makes highest water.

Jn the broad Sound, betwixt Ushant and the Seames a w.s.w. and e.n.e. moon
makes the highest water: The flood falls very strong upon Ushant, and to the
southwards of it through the Mullens. Thwart over the Trade, toward the
Backovens. Likewise in through the Broad Sound unto Breast. Also along by S.
Mathews point toward the Fourne, or Backovens, with great rippeling. He that
comes sailing about Ushant, must reckon thereupon.

In the Race of Fontenay a southwest and by south, and northeast and by north
moon makes full sea. The flood falls very strong through betwixt the Keyser,
somewhat thwart over toward the Lavender, with very great rippeling over the
Calfe, (that is the ledge of Rocks, which lies off from the Lavender) and from
thence forth north, and north and by west inwards to S. Mathews point: With
calms men must take very good heed not to be miscarried away with the current.
With stormy weather out of the north or south, it is not without danger to come
in this channel, especially with an ebb or out-fall.

On these coasts of Britaigne, and the Islands there abouts, a southwest and
n.e. moon makes the highest water: but within the havens, rivers, indraughts,
and bays, a s.w. and by w. and n.e. and by e. Moon, or a point later,
according as the havens or rivers do lie deep in the land. Men do not reckon
there any setting or running of the streams, for the flood comes (through
the swelling of the great Ocean) right against the coasts, and so runs only
into the havens, the Ebb contrariwise goes thwart from the shore to
seawards, when it falls so that men cannot perceive any course off streams
except it be a little through, or about some points off Islands.

On these lands, as on all the coast off Britaigne, a n. e. and southwest moon
makes high water, and within the havens, rivers and in-draughts, a point or
two later according as they lie far within the land.

On the Coasts and Islands a s.w. and northeast moon makes high water,
within the Havens and Rivers a point or two later, according as they lie far
within the land.

Of the Depths about these places, and in what. depths men may see the land.
The Backovens, or the land of the Four men may see in 50 fathom.

Ushant being about s. from you, you may see in 50 fathom.

Southwest from Ushant 5 or 6 leagues off it is deep 75 fathom, and then you
may see the land from the poop.

In the Broad Sound it is 45 fathom.

A little without the Seames, about a league, it is deep 50 fathom.

Men may see the Seames and the Sheets, or Slaeplakens in 60 or 65 fathom.

Betwixt Ushant and the Seames in the fareway it is deep 55 fathom.

Thwart of the Pens and the Glanons men may see the land in 55 and 60 fathom.

Bell-Isle men may see from below in 55, but under the top in 60 fathom.

FRom the east point of the Cardinal to the River of Roche Barnard, the course
right northeast: there lies a little Island about half ways betwixt the
Cardinal and the foresaid river ot rather nearer the Cardinal then the River
(for when men are by the River, they can but even see the foresaid little
Island) men run with the foresaid course of northeast close along to the
westwards, of that little Island, and shall fall a little to the northwards of
the river, run then within a Cables length along by the shore unto it,
until that the river do open it self, and then sail in amids the channel,
and give the rocks a birth that lie at the easter shore. Being come within the
rocks, you may anchor there, or else sail on against the shore on the
starboard side, and so may save ship and goods without anchor or cable, if
there should be such need. At low water with an ordinary tide, there is about
eleven, and with a spring nine foot water; with an ordinary tide it flows
there about a fathom, but with spring 2 fathom up and down: the entering of the
river lies in east and by south. A little to the eastwards of the rivers
mouth, lies a great rock which at high water is covered.

He that comes from the River of Nantes, and is bound to Roche Barnard, and
is not well acquainted there betwixt both, let him run so far to seawards
of the Cardinal (when he is to the westwards of the Four) until that he run
about a seaboard of that foresaid little Island (lying half ways betwixt the
Cardinal and the River of Roche Barnard) then goes he surely clear of all the
foul ground and other dangers, men may sail close along by it to the
westwards, but to the eastwards, of it lie many Rocks and shoals.

He that will sail along to the eastwards or to the northwards of it, must
leave about 2 third parts of the water to the Island, and one third part
toward the land, and so run through betwixt them, but must look out well.

Betwixt the rivers of Roche Bernard and Nantes, lies Old-downes, Croisill, or
Croswyck, and Poelgem. Croswyck Croswyck
has two points, within the northwest Point lies the great village of
Croswyck, which has a thick tower, and there is a great in draught like a
haven, where men may go to anchor in five, six or seven fathom: to the
westwards of it stands also a flat Church upon the high land. The land of
Olddownes Olddownes.
lies a little to the northwards of the Church. Poelgem Poelgem.
is a village to the eastwards of Croswyck, with a high sharp Tower.

About two leagues from the land southwest and by south from Croswyck, and west
and by southsoutherly from the e. point of Poelgem, lies a great bank, called
the Four, The Four
which at some places falls dry at low water, and lies from BellIsle near
about east and lies the longest way southwest and northeast.

If you will sail from Bell-Isle to the river of Nantes, For to sail into the
River of Nantes.
then go away from the east end of the Cardinal, or from the eastermost rocks
that lie of from the Cardinal, directly e.n.e. toward the west point of
Croswyck, for to sail a weather of the foresaid Four, so long until it begin
to shoale, and that the sharp tower of Poelgem comes against the highest of
the east point of Croswyck, then you run along to the northwards of the
foresaid banck, go then e.s.e. or according as the wind is east and by south,
and e.s.e. unto the Rock with the hole, called Pierre-perce, Pierre-Perce.
but so that you come not very near (at low water) the land somewhat to the
westwards of Poelgem, for it is not clean along by it. Betwixt the Four and
the point of Croswyck it is in the fareway 8, 9, and 10 fathom deep.

From the point of Poelgem eastwards lie some little Islands and Rocks, which
are very foul, come not very near them, nor the shore thereabouts. If it
should happen that you should turn to windwards, for at low water there
falls many of the rocks dry, when you come near the rock with the hole) then
run along to the northwards of it, and run in very close by it, leaving it on
the starboard side of you for to avoid the foul grounds, which lie off from
the point of Poelgem toward this rock. Close along by this rock it is four
fathom deep. Being past this Rock with the hole, then run all along by the
north shore, unto S. Nazare S. Nazare
in three or four fathom at low water, but you must take heed of a rocky
point, somewhat to the westwards of S. Nazare, the marks thereof are these:
There stands a mill upon the high land, somewhat far within the land, when
that comes over a countrey-mans house, which stands below by the river,
then are you thwart of the rocks, being past them, keep yet the north shore,
and run along by it, until you come within the point of S. Nazare, and
anchor there in 6 or 7 fathom. In the midst of the river betwixt the foresaid
rocks with the hole, and S. Nazare, lies a row of Rocks, called Les Porceaux,
Les Porceaux.
these come at half tide above water: Because of them, and also more other
shoals, lying in the river, you must run all along by the north shore I as
is before said.

Somewhat within S. Nazare upon the north-land stands a sharp Tower when that
comes without the south land, then you cannot take hurt of the foresand
rocks, run along to the northwards of them, a little to the eastwards of them
lies another shoale of Rocks, where men may run about the eastwards of it with
great ships, it is there very shoale water along to the point; being within
the point, men may anchor, as is said, in 6 or 7 fathom. To the eastwards of
Saint Nazare lie two other villages, and there betwixt the Villages it is very
shoale, and stony ground, there men must borrow over the souther shore, but
when you are half ways to the eastermost Village then you may well sail
right on with the point of the Village, until you be past it, but against that
eastermost Village on the s. side, upon the point, lies a banck, called Pynbut
Pynbut.
which, lies at least half ways over in the River, but men may run through
betwixt the point and this bancke in 5 or 6 fathom, this is the road for
ships that are bound out to sea.

A league further in, in the midst of the river lie two stony banks in the
fareway. At Pelerin Pelerin.
is the lading place, 2 leagues from Nantes, where the good are brought off
with Lighters from the ships, but from S. Nazare to Nantes, or Pelerin, it is
Pilots water, which men do commonly take in, by the above named sharp Tower,
called S. Nazare, S. Nazare
where men (when they are within it) may anchor in 10, or 12 fathom, and stay
for a Pilot.

For to run into sea from S. Nazaro, along to the south wards of the rock
with the hole, you must run first along by the north shore, as is before
said, until that you come without the second point of the River, edge then off
from the north land to the midst of the River; and sail a good ways about
to the southwards of Pierre-perce, when as you can see the Rock (which lies
to the northwards of Pierre-perce) without the point, there it is deep 4
f^thom and a half, and when as Pierre-Perce is n.n.west, and north and by west
from you, then you come thwart of the Rock, and there you find deeper water,
to wit, 5, 6 and at least 7 fathom, but when you come in the fareway of
Pickeliers, then you get 10 or 12 fathom water.

Banks before the Loiret.
Before the River of Nantes lie many bancks, but at half flood men go over
them, the south point of the river of Nantes lies from the North point
Northnorthwest and southsoutheast 4 leagues asunder, to the southwards of it,
the land lies in with a great indraught, and there men do run into the Bay.
These uneven banks in the river of Nantes, are very unlike, sometimes men sound
in 15 fathom, and presently afterward but 7 or 8 fathom.

But to sail from Bell-Isle to the bay or Armentiers Armentiers.
you must go e.s.e. until that you see the Abbey of Armentiers to the
eastwards of the trees, which stand within the land over the same Abbey, then
go on e. and by n. so long until that the Abbey come within the castle of
Armentiers, then are you within the Moncks leg. Go then again e.s.e. until
that you be within the rock of Pierremen, Pierremen.
you may go about it on both sides, and when that you can see the Grave open,
then you may anchor in 7, or 8, fathom, and row a shore to fetch a Pilot, it
is Pilots water. From Bell-Isle to Armentiers, the course is eastsoutheast
about 12 or 13 leagues asunder.

From Armentiers to Use, or Heys, it is south and by east 7 leagues, and from
Bell-Isle to Use or Heys, southeast 16, leagues. The Island of Pickeliers
Pickeliers
lies right before the point of Armentiers. Betwixt Armentiers or Pickeliers
and Use, it is an uneven fareway, with many shoales and banks from 4, 5, 6, and
7 fathom Upon Use Heys or Use.
stands a sharp tower and some little houses or mills, whereby it is very
easy to be known. It is in the fareway betwixt Use and Bell-Isle 35, and 40
fathom, but when men are within the fareway, it is 25 fathom deep.

Under Use it is not very good riding, the sea comes always so rolling in,
as if the water came through under the Island, at the northend it is shoale
water, the road is, when the Church steeples is southwest from you, in 8, or 9,
fathom; but men lie there not sheltred but only for a south west and w.s.w.
wind, and it does ripple there always very much.

From Use to the Killiats, or to the Island of Saint Martens, the courses is
eastsoutheast twelve or thirteen leagues. Betwixt both lies the Baerges of
Olone about half a league off from the land of Poictou, and east and by south
seven leagues from Use in the right fareway, and in regard that it is nothing
but Rocks and stones, therefore it is not good to come near them in dark
weather, men may sail round about them, and at low water they are uncovered.
If you will sail from Use, unto the Killiaets, or unto the tail of Aise,
through within the Barges, then sail on first east, and being within the
Baerges of Olone, sail to the land of Poicton, which lies from Olone to Saint
Martens Island eastsoutheast, and from Olone to the Pickelliers northwest.

From Olone to the Killiaets the coast lies most eas^southeast four or five
leagues. For to sail into the Killiaets, For to sail into the Killiats:
which is in along to the northwards of the Island of S. Marten, in betwixt
the foresaid Island and the main land of Poictou, you must go in somewhat
more northerly then the middle of the channel, or leave two third parts of the
channel toward S. Martens Island, and one third part toward the main land.
Along by the Island of S. Martens it is uneven, and somewhat full of bancks;
come not too near also the main land, for there lie off also some banckes,
but you may borrow of them by your lead. Go in along, as before is said,
Marks of the banck before S. Martens.
until that the Church of S. Martin be southsouthwest from you, then you shall
be past the banck which lies north from S. Martens, and lies off from the
shore somewhat to the westwards of Saint Martens, there is, a hard steep
stony bank, which shoaleth up suddenly. For to avoid it when as you must turn
too and again with an easterly, or a northeast wind, you must not bring the
little Tower of Hars in the Village of Loy, but when the little Tower of Hars
comes to the first, or northermost house of Loy, then you must cast about,
for then you come against the banck, where remains at low water about a
fathom depth, and at high water about four fathom. When the foresaid little
Tower of Hars comes against a mill which stands at the south end of Loy,
then are you within the Bank, to wit, betwixt the Bancke and S. Martens. When
S. Martens comes to be s.w. and by south, and s.s.w. from you, then you may
boldly sail over the end of the bank toward S. Martens, you shall find there
at low water and spring tide at least 3 fathom or sixteen or seventeen foot,
also one cast or 2 but 12 foot then it is all soft ground, as also before S.
Martens, but the bancks are hard, and with spring tides there remains little
water upon them. Before S. Martins you may anchor in 4, 5, or 6 fathom.

For to anchor before S. Martins, For to anchor before Saint Martens.
you must anchor so, that you may see open into the haven, and that the point
of the Abbey, and the Bosse do stand the length of two capsta nebars one from
the other, there is with spring tides at low water three fathom and a half,
but at high water six fathom and a half deep.

When you sail into the Killiats, as before is said, it is 12, 11, and 10
fathom deep, but being come so far that the Tower of S. Martins begins to
stand s.w. from you, there it will be by little and little shoaler, and then
you may well edge toward the Island in five and four fathom, it shoaleth then
suddenly up, and will be from ten, quickly five, and four fathom.

If you will go over the banck that lies off from the Abbey with a ship
that draws much water, then you must stay so long that it be half flood, for
at low water there remains no more upon it then three fathom, or a foot or
two more: when it is somewhat flowed, then you may well go over with a great
ship. When the little tower of Hussou comes to the north end of the Island
Urck, or Tivalenes, then are you upon the shoalest of the bank, but when the
little. Tower comes over the south end of that little Island, then it
begins to deepen again.

The marks for to keep the deepest water, when you run over the bank are
these keep the great Tower of Rochel a handspikes length to the southward of
the wood of trees, which stands upon the northermost high land, and run so
over the banck, it is there all soft ground.

If you will anchor before the Abbey within the bank, then run in 6 or 7
fathom and anchor there.

But if you will not anchor under S. Martens, but will sail forth toward Burnt
Island, then bring that foresaid little tower of Lussou over the little house
that stands upon the little Island Urck, and keep it so standing, and then
you can take no hurt of the Laverdyne.

The Laverdyne Laverdin.
is a rane of rocks together a musket shot long, which lies off from the east
point of S. Martens Island, about an English mile, and with spring tide at low
water is uncovered. Betwixt it and the Island of S. Martens men may sail
through, there is depth enough. The marks of the Laverdyne are these: When you
come in at the Killiats, and sail through betwixt S. Martens Island and the
Bosse, and you come to see the great Tower of Rochell even without the point of
the Bosse, then are you right thwart of the Laverdyne; which lies then s.w.
from you, it is there betwixt them both not very wide: or else when the
foresaid great Tower of Rochel stands even without the point of Bosse, and
the North point, of the Plom a ships length without the south point (which is
the north point of the Bosse) then are you right upon the Laverdyne, therefore
when Rochell comes a ships length to the southwards of the Bosse (when you
come in at the Killiats) then are you past the Laverdyne, and you may boldly
go on s.e. and s.e. and by south toward Burnt-Island.

Porthus Portus.
is a broad and wide channel, lying in through betwixt S. Martens Island and
Oleron, and lies from Use s.e. and by e. distant about 15 leagues. If you will
sail into Porthus, then run in betwixt both lands e.s.e. but much nearer S.
Martens Island, for to avoid the banck of Oleron, which is a foul ledge of
rocks, at the n. end of Oleron, come no near it by night then in 12 or 13
fathom.

When you come then by the east end of S. Martens Island and are bound to
Rochell, or else will anchor under the Bosse bring the great Tower of Rochel a
ships length without the Bosse, so you can take no hurt of the Laverduyn. You
may anchor under the Bosse in 5 or 6 fathom soft ground, so that the point do
lie north from you. Or else if you will anchor under the Abbey of S. Martens
Island, then run in upon the foresaid marks, so long until that the foresaid
Abbey come without the s. point of the same Island, sail then right with it
and then you shall leave the Laverduyn far enough on the larboard side of you.
And being come near the Abbey, anchor a little to the aestwards of it in 5, 6,
or 7, fathom, there is the road for ships that are bound out.

When you go into Porthus, and will sail to the Burnt Island, then run in
(as before is said) until you come near the east end of S. Martens Island:
thence the course is south east, and by east, or from the Bosse south or south
and by east, or with a westerly wind south and by west unto that Island.

When you sail so near Burnt-Island Burnt-Island.
that the Tower of Voorn, or the Four, comes over the Burnt-Island, there you
may cast your ballast over board, it is there 12 fathom deep.

If you must turn to and again with a southerly wind from the Bosse to the
Burnt-Island, or from Burnt-Island to the Bosse, then come not to near the
land of Rochell, there lie diverse stony banckes along the land, a good ways
from the shore, where of you must take heed. When Rochell is hidden behind
the south point which lies over against the Creek, there lies a stony
bancke, upon which remains not a fathom of water.

If you will sail into the river of Sherrant, then run about to the
southwards of Burnt-Island, you may also sail about to the northwards of it,
and sail in by the Tower of Voorn, or Four. At low water this river falls
dry, at least 4 leagues within the land. For to sail from Burnt-Island to
Burwage, you must sail away s.s.e. and keep the little Tower of Heers to the
westwards of the wood, so long until the tower of Voorn or le Four, come over
the little red-tyled house, that stands rpon the s. side of the river of
Sherrant sail then in s.e. and by little and little s.e. and by east until
that Pront (a village that lies upon the strand) comes to the n. wards of
Soubise, when as then Soubise comes within the foresaid village, and the mill
above the village, then you shall be against the point of Oysterbanck:
Oysterbancks.
go then in along s. e. and by south, and bring that outermost little Tower
of Heers, over the outermost sandy place, where the gallows stands by, keep
them so standing, and sail in s.s.e, when as then the little Tower of Heers
comes to the east side of the valley, whicb is in the wood, then keep that
sharp little Tower right over the east side of the valley of the wood, and
sail in so into the Creek, or river of Burwage. At Burwage was wont not to
stand a house, where now is a strong fair Town, being builded so within 70 or
80 years past.

The Bannier lies along the land of Oleron, and lies until within
Burnt-Island, at low water it is uncovered, and the tail of it lies far to
the northwards. If you should turn out from the Creek toward the Burnt Island,
then bring the Tower of Rochell not without the Burnt-Isand, before you come
thwart of it, because of the Baniard, Baniard.
and the^ you shall take no hurt of it.

At the south end of Oleron, betwixt Oleron and the land to the southwards of
it, is yet another channel, where men may sail in and out, called the
Mamme-sound, deep enough for great ships, it lies in from out of the sea east
and by n. being come there within, there runs up ariver southeast toward
Sales, where men do lade salt, being past that, to the other point of the
Mamme-sound, Mamme sound.
lies a plate, where of men run to the northwards upon these marks: you must
keep the mill that stands upon the lands of Oleron over the trees and so you
shall run to the northward) off the plate, there is the road for them that
will lade salt at Oleron or Olderdon.

But if you will run in through, and out again, then you must fail so far
to the eastwards, until that Sales come over the trees, which stand within
Merven, for to avoid the tail or riffe that shoots of from Oleron: when
Sales comes over the trees, sail then north and by w. on, the Burnt-Island,
but bring Duke Charles Tower to the s. wards of the Burnt-Island, for not to
sail within the Banniard. When the little Tower of Heers comes to the wood
keep it then so standing until Rochell comes over the north side of the
Burnt-Island sail then out at the Portrush. There shoots of also a riffe
from the west end of Saint Martens Island, Riffe at S. Martens Island.
where of you must take heed.

About south, or a little more westerly, thirteen leagues from the Island Use,
southwest and by west from the Island S. Martens, and w.n.w. or somewhat more
northerly from the river of Bordeaux, lie the Rocks of Rockedon, or Rochebon,
Rocks of Rochebon
of some called Urkamia, in form of a Trevet or Brandize. The southermost of
the three is the shoalest, whereupon remains at low water about 2 fathom
depth: At the southeast side the ground is black little stones, and at the
northeast side white sand, but you may not come near them by your lead sound
by them.

A little to the westwards, not far from the foresaid rocks, lies yet
another rock, where upon is at low water 5 fathom water, nevertheless with a
storm the sea breaks terribly upon it.

Of the Depths ahout these places, and in what depths men may see the land.
Bell-Isle men may see from below in 55, but under the top in 60 fathom.

Without Use it is 35 fathom deep, and then men may see the land from below:
when it is clear weather men may see it in 60 fathom.

Westsouthwest from Use about 9 leagues you shall find 45 and 46 fathom, the
ground is full of fine small stones as great as course sand and verry steep.

The land of Olone men may see it from below in 25 and 30 fathom.

S. Martens Island and the north end off Oleron men may see in 28 and 30
fathom. When men get sight off S. Martens Island, they shall see upon it a high
Tower, with a high house, and upon the strand a mill with four or five high
sand-hills. Upon Oleron men shall see a high spire Tower upon a red point,
where men shall see some trees stand over it and to the southwards of it, is at
2 or 3 places ragged sandhills.

The third Demonstration, Which Contains the Description of the River of
Bourdeaux to S. Sebastiaen or Coninx reed.
FRom the Band or Crage off Oleron to the Tower of Cordan, or the Po^e-head, or
the mouth off the River off Bourdeaux, called the Garrone, the land lies south
s.east; and s. and by e. 13 leagues.

To the northwardes of the mouth of the river of Bourdeaux, lie five or six
high white Sand-hills, but to the southwards off it, it is somewhat low land,
black little Sandhilles, being grown with spiry grass.

From the Tower of Cordan off to the northwards, toward the high Sand-Hills,
which lie upon the north land lies a sand-bancke, called the Piper, Piper.
men may sound along by it on the west side in seven fathom, but upon the
northend it is very steep, and not far off it is twenty fathom deep.

From the north-point off the River runs off to the southwards, a sand
called the norther Asses, and to the southwards of it lies another sand,
called the souther Asses, Norther and souther Asses.
through betwixt them both, and also along to the southwards of them, men
sail into the River.

If you will sail into the River coming from the northwards, then you may run
along by the shoale in 12 and 13 fathom, until that the tower of Cordan
stand southeast and by east from you, run then right in with it, through
betwixt the norther and souther Asses. until that the high white sandhil upon
the north point of the river stand northnortheast from you, men may so (coming
from the northwards) run in also about by the norther Asses, by your lead,
until that the Tower come to be southsoutheast, and southeast and by south
from you then go toward the Tower, and when the foresaid high sand-hil come
to be northnortheast or northeast and by north from you, sail then right in
with it until that you have the sounding of the land, run then in along by
it, toward Messie, that is the point where all the mils stand. When you shall
sail thus toward the high sand-hill, and that the Tower of Soulack comes a
great fathom to the northwards of the Tower of Cordan and the little mill of
Royan Royan.
then are you also past the Piper, and may run in right east without fear
toward Royan, but you must reckon well your tide, for the flood falls thwart
over the Asses toward the Tower off Cordan, and the ebb in the contrary.

In this foresaid channel through betwixt the Asses remains at low water 3
fathom water upon the shoals.

For to sail into the river along to the southwards of the Asses, coming
from the northwards, (that is, the best channel) you must do thus: Bring the
Tower of Soulacke east from you, or somewhat more northerly, and sail in so
right with it until the tower of Cordan be north and by east, and north north
east from you, Royan shall then stand north east from you, or else if you come
from the southwards, then bring the tower of Cordan north and by east, and
north n.e. from you, and sail in so right with it until Soulack come to be
east from you, Royan shall then stand n. e. from you sail then right toward
it, and coming near it, sail to the point of Messie.

When you are now within the Rivers mouth, and come right against the point of
Messie, that is the point where the Mills stand upon, then edge over toward
the broken Castle, called Chastillion, Chastillion
south east and by south, that is, eight leagues from Messie, and then forth in
along by the south land, south east in unto Pouliack, Pouliac^
which is two great leagues.

In the fareway betwixt the Piper and the point with the Mills, or Messie, it
is 10, 11, and 12 fathom deep, but out of the fare-way, either on the north
side, or south side, it is shoaly, to wit, five, six, seven, and eight fathom,
you must run along close by the point of Messie, there it is 22 fathom deep.

When as that Royan comes to the west point, where upon the mills stand keep
it so standing, and go away south east and by south toward Chastillion, it is
in this fareway almost all along 5 fathom deep, but coming near the north or
south side, it is shoaly, and at the nortst side it is full of sands, where
also men may well sail through that are acquainted.

From Chastillion to Pouliack Pouliack.
it is 2 great leagues s. east, the course is as before is said, and it is
there deep 4, 5, 6, and 7 fathom. Over against Pouliack in the midst of the
River lies a little Island to the eastwards, men must run about it, right in
with Bloy, but there men must go over with the tide, for it is there at low
water but a little more then one fathom deep.

When you are before Pouliack, and will sail to Bloye, then let the water
first flow an hour, and then you may well go over with a ship that draws
nine or ten foot water. The marks for to sail along in the deepest water
of this reach, are these: there stands a Mill half ways betwixt Bloye and
Rocktaw, keep that without the new wall of Bloye, and then you shall run in
the deepest of the Channel.

Before Bloye Bloye.
it is again three or four fathom deep, run then along by the north land
in three, four, and five fathom. When you come before the River which lies up
to the eastwards called Dordoigne, then sail first right with the midd^st of
the second Island, and leave it on the starboard side, and go indifferent near
along by it, until that you be over against or past the Gallows, which
stands upon the east point of the River: and then again along by the north
land unto the four little houses. From thence you must edge over to the high
tower of Dublot or Pigeonhouse, coming thwart of it, you must presently edge
over against to the east side, to the hight near Lermond; in that edging over,
you shall run through betwixt a stone bank on the larboard side, and a
shoale sand-plate on the starboard side, over a bank called the Pace, The pace.
which is the shoaliest of all the river, there remains at low water a little
less then a fathom. Being come over the Pace to the east side, go then in
along by the east shore, until you be past Lermond, then sail again over
to the west side, right with the houses of Charterhouse, and then in all
along by the west shore, until you come before the town of Bourdeaux, in
that crooked reach betwixt Larmond and Charterhouse it is 5, 6, and 7 fathom
deep, and before the town 4 and 5 fathom.

When men will sail out of the river of Bordeaux, they must stay at Royan
until they have good weather, and a sore-ebbe to run out with: in running out,
keep the high sand-hill north north east from you, so long until that the
tower of Cordan be south east and by east from you, then you may sail out
through the Asses northwest and by west into sea.

From Cordan, or the river of Bourdeaux, unto Arcachon, the coast lies s. and
n. twenty leagues, it is all low sandy land, betwixt them both lies a
tyde-haven called Anchises men may go in there well at high water with great
ships.

Before the haven of Arcachon, or Arcason, Arcason.
lie three shoals, men may sail into the northwards of them, and also into the
southwards of them: the norther entry goes in betwixt the north point and the
northermost shoale, but it is narrow and not deep. The souther entry lies to
the southwards of all the shoals by the souther point, in betwixt two shoaly
sand-bankes, where of the one lies off from the southermost shoale, and the
other from the south point of maine land, s. west and by w. in to the sea. The
land to the n. wards of this haven is altogethet somewhat low sandy land
without trees, but to the southwards of it they are all somewhat high sand-hils
without trees also, but coming before the havens mouth, you shall see within
in the land many trees. When you come out of the sea either from the northwards
or the southwards, near about this havens mouth, you shall easily aspy the
foresaid banks on both sides of the souther entry, by the breaking of the sea,
and you may borrow of them by your lead, as near as you please, they are very
clean and flat. Upon the sandhils within the haven mouth, stand two great high
masts. If you will sail in there, For to sail in to the haven of Arcason.
then bring the two Masts one in the other, and then they shall stand north
east and by east from you keep them one in the other, and sail in so right
with them, and you shall so sail in betwixt the two foresaid banks, and at
low water you shall not find less then two fathom water, but at high water
you shall have five and a half, and six fathom water, go in so upon the
marks, until you come within the shoals, and to the end of the shoale sand on
the larboard side. Being gotten in within it, you must luffe up about by it,
and go then on north until you come to the point, which you shall see on the
starboard side, but give that a birth, because there runs off a tail, there
is in that reach no less then ten, eleven, or twelve fathom deep. Being come
about that point, you may then sail in close along by the land on the
starbord side, which lies east south east, or you may anchor there in sixteen,
fifteen, twelve, and ten fathom, or further in about the second point, in two
and three fathom. Over against the first pont, on the north side, it falls
very far dry, a great ways within.

From Arcason to Bayone, Bayone.
the coast lies south and north sixteen or seventeen leagues. The Rivers mouth
of Bayone lies in betwixt two plain strands e.s.e. and east and by south, and
sometimes more easterly or northerly, by reason of the shifting and altering of
the sands before the Rivers mouth. Upon the land on the south side of the
channel, stand two masts, these you must keep one in the other, or the
innermost a little to the northwards of the outermost, and run so in over the
Bar or shoaliest place, until you come against the south point, and then in
along by it. Upon the foresaid Bar is at high water and Spring tide, at
least three fathom, with an ordinary tide two fathom and a half, but at low
water no more then 3 foot water. When you come about the point, you must sail
up to the southwards, keeping about the middle of the channel along the
river, or rather nearest the west side, for to avoid some foul ground and
shoale, that lie on the east side, and anchor before the town in four, five,
or six fathom. This Bar and this River is Pilots water.

A little within this Bar on the north side of the river lies up to the
northwards, a great water within, of 7 leagues long, and falls out into Sea
by Cabritton. Along that great water the ships were wont to sail up to
Bayone, but it is now upon the south end at the river of Bayone, almost
altogether paled too, so that there can but small barks go through, for to
keep the better the Bar of Bayone deep with scowring through of the water.

From the Bar of Bayone to S. John de Luz, S. John de Luz
the course is south and by west 4 leagues, there is a fair Bay, where men may
ride in five, six, seven, or eight fathom, according as they will lie far
in, clean sandy ground, at the end of the Bay is a little tyde-haven, where
upon lies the town on the west side. At high water, and with an ordinary
tide, there comes nine foot, but with a spring twelve foot water, at low
water it falls altogether dry, so that men may go over there with dry
feet. A little within the west point of the Bay is also a little Dock, where
there is a foot water more then in the foresaid tyde-haven, but it falls also
dry at low water.

This Bay is very good to know by these marks that hereafter are written: It
lies right in the Bight, to the eastwardes of it lies the land north and by
east toward Bayone, and to the westwardes of it the land falls away
southwest nnd by west, and southwest toward Fonteravia. Upon the east point of
the Bay stands a white Fire-tower, which men may see far off, especially
when the Sun shines upon it, then it shines very white more then the other
land. Upon the west point stands a flat white house a little ways upon the
high land, to the westwardes of the Bay it is upon the sea side gray and
bluish land. Alsoo the high hill of S. John de Luz, is a good mark for to
know this Bay, which remains in sailing in, lying somewhat to the eastwardes,
or on the larboard side. This foresaid hill of S. John de Luz shows it self
out in height above all other hills thereabouts, and thereby is very good to
be known above upon the top it is somewhat flat, as is demonstrated in the
rising of the lands. Upon this foresaid hill stands a Chapel, from whence
men may see into four Kingdoms: France, Spain, Navarre, and Arragon.

About two leagues southwest and southwest and by west from S. John de Luz, lie
the rocks called the Pignons of S. Anna, Pignons of S. Anna
not far from land: a league to the westwards of them lies the Bay of
Fonteravia, being a fair Bay.

At the west point of the Bay lies the C. Figure, a high point, upon it
stands a castle, and to the southwards of it a little chapel. At the point
of this cape lies a rock a little ways from it, but the sea cannot run
through betwixt them, except it be with very high floods, it breaks a little
through. At the east side of this bay lie two high rocks, and thwart of them
lie also some low rocks a good ways off from the land. For to avoid them you
must sail in by the west point for to come into this Bay, and being within it,
you may anchor in eight or nine fathom, but so that the foresaid great rock at
the C. Figuer stand northnorthwest from you, there you lie in fair sandy
ground, and landlockt for a northwest wind. The Kroonenbrough Kroonenberch.
lies about half ways betwixt S. John de Luz and this foresaid Bay of
Fonteravia.

A little league to the westwards of C. de Figuer, lies Passage Passagie.
also a fair haven At the west side of the havens mouth, which is very narrow,
lies a round rock, so that it is evil to come in there with an ebb, but with
a flood it is better, without it is very clean, without any shoale or foul
grounds, but only the foresaid round rock. The town lies a little within
the haven on the w. side, where men do lie before it in 7 fathom.

Two great leagues to the westwardes of Passage, lies S. Sebastians, betwixt
both is also a sand-bay in a bight, where there goes up into the land a shoale
little river, where come in many Barks.

The haven of Saint Sebastians S. Sebastians.
is good for to come into, men do run in there betwixt two little castles,
where of the eastermost is the greates, standing upon a high hill. The
westermost is a little square Tower, and lies upon a little Island, or rock.
In the havens mouth being narrow, betwixt the two foresaid little Castles,
lies a rock, which at low water is six fathom deep, and when it is a storm
out of the sea, it breaks always upon it, and lies nearest the east-land,
by the west-land it is deep ten fathom. Now for to avoid the foresaid rock in
coming in, there comes an Abbey to the eastwards of the westermost Island,
and a liitle Tower. If you keep them one in the other, then you run into
eastwards of it.

For to anchor without S. Sebastians in the road, you must keep the high hill
which lies upon the point of Cape Figuer, without the foresaid eastermost
castle, there you may anchor, but if the same come to be hidden behind the
castle or Island, then you may not anchor in the road of S. Sebastians. When
you are come through the narrow within the rock and the castles, then you may
anchor at the east side under the great castle, there is the best road. Within
the foresaid castle goes up a little water, men may go at low water on foot
from the easter castle along a high strand upon the maine land, unto the
Town, which lies behind the foresaid high hill with the Castle, yet the
strand at high water is covered; it is a bay, and within before the town it is
deep five, six, and seven fathom, at the west side under the little Island,
men may not anchor, because it is flat and shoale there.

He that will go forth from thence into S. Sebastians. let him run in, keeping
the middle channel, betwixt the two Islands, and let him leave the little
Island where upon the chapel stands on the starboard side, running in so
right against the first or the second wall of the town, and anchor there, the
boats or shallops shall come aboard of him, and help him into the haven
betwixt the walls.

A league to the westwardes of S. Sebastians, lies a sandbay, where men may
anchor so deep and so shallow as they will.

Of the Tides and Courses and streams.
Like as on all the coasts of France, so also at the mouth of the River of
Bordeaux, makes high water a s.w. and northeast moon.

In the Haven of Arcason a southwest and by west and a northeast and by east
Moon makes high water, but the flood draws almost an hour longer in then
the water flows.

On all the places, and before all the havens of these coasts, a southwest and
northeast moon makes the highest water; but within the ha^ens about a point
later, according as they lie deep within the land, like as on the coasts off
Brittaigne Poictou, and Gascoigny. Men reckon here also no failing or setting
of the streams. But the streams fall here thwart off and on.

Upon the coast of Biscany we find no running of streams, but a southeast and
northwest moon makes over all the coasts the highest water, and within the
Rivers a point less.

Of the Depths.
The land against the River off Bordeaux men may see from the poop in 30
fathom, and the Tower off Cordan in 27 fathom.

Betwixt Arcason, and S. John de Luz men may see the land in 30 fathom, when
about Bayone, they shall see Cabritton, Bayone. Bedert, and S. John de Luz,
almost all flat Towers.

Being before Passage, men may see also the point C. Figuer, and S. Sebastians,
the land lies in there with a great Bay.

About C. de Figuer lies a high hill, which at the southwest end is very
steep, and goes very long slopeing down toward the north.

When men are before S. Sebastians 7 or 8 leagues without the land, then it
rises somewhat long, and at the west end steep and hollow, but when men come
close by the land, then it is very high and steep.

When men are 8 leagues without S. Sebastians, then may they see the eastermost
or gratest castle upon the high hill, and alsoo the little Island to the
westwards of it.

The fourth Demonstration, In which The Coast of Biscaye from Coninx reed to
the Island S. Cypriaen, are delineated.
From S. Sebastians to C. de Martinchaco, the course is w.n.w. 13 leagues.
Betwixt them both lie the roades Gateria and Deva.

Gateria Gateria.
lies from S. Sebastians west and by north, and w.n.w. distant 7. leagues,
being a fair round sand-bay, where is good riding for westerly winds, men lie
there within the west point right before the Town in fair sandy ground, a
north wind comes right from the point. This bay is commonly called
Kings-haven.

Along the coast of Biscay, betwixt S. John de Luz and Gateria is every where
clean ground and good ankoring in 20 fathom.

From Gateria to Deva it is a league and half to the westwardes: which is an
off-water that comes out of the high-land.

Two leagues to the westwardes lies the point of Cape Martinchaco.

About thirteen leagues westnorthwest from S. Sebastians, lies the Cape de
Martinchaco, a little to the westwardes of it is a good tyde-haven, wherein
lies a little Town about a league within the land, upon a river which comes
out of the high land. A little to the westwards of Cape de Martinchacol, lies
a great rock fast to the land, and a little to the westwardes of the same
another: upon the point called Punte de Avillanes. Southwest and by west from
Martinchaco lies the haven of Barmea, Barmea.
a fair great Bay, the easter point is foul, therefore men must give it a
good birth, and run in along by the west side, when they are gotten in it is
large enough, there they may anchor where they will.

To the westwardes of Barmea, lies also Placentia Placentia.
upon a little River, the town lies a little within the land. There are all
tyde-havens.

From Cape de Martinchaco to Bilbao, (where betwixt lie the foresaid havens of
Barmea and Placentia) it is s. southwest and southwest and by south 6 leagues.

From Placentia to Bilboa it is two leagues westsouthwest and west and by
south. Bilbao lies upon a great river along which there comes of much
Iron, it is a good haven, but it lies not far in, by reason of the Bar
which lies thwart over the haven, where men must go in with high water.

At the east point of Bilbao Bilbao.
shoots of a riffe, which men must avoid, there lie also some rocks under
water. It is a high steep point, and is white to see to.

Within the riffe that runs off from the point, men may anchor in seven and
eight fathom, betwixt the point and the Piere on the east side, there the
Pilots come off which bring up the ships; and there men lie land-lockt far a
northwest wind. From this foresaid point or road to the Bar or river mouth
of Bilbao, it is a league and half s. and by west, which lies in by the west
land, there stand five or six houses upon the w. land, when the two westermost
houses come one in the other, or when you may see through the two eastermost
houses, which stand within in the land, then are you upon the Bar or shoale,
then go in south and s. by east right with the Castle Portugalletto, and
along close by the Castle, and anchor a little within the Castle for a west
wind. But when you are before the Bar, the Pilots come off and bring you to
the Town.

When you lie without in the Bay, then you may see Mount Anthony lie w. and by
north from you.

From the point of Bilboa to Castro, Castro.
the course is w. 5 leagues, that is a good haven for 6, 7 and 8 fathom depth.
The narrow of the haven lies in south, in 10 fathom. But further in the river
toward the town, it is not deeper then 3 or 4 fathom.

From Bilbao to the hill of S. Anthonies, M. S. Anthony.
it is w. and by north nine or ten leagues. From Castro to Laredo, the course
is west distant five leagues, upon the west side lies the foresaid hill of S.
Anthonies, which is a high hill, men may sail in close along by it until
they come about the east point; within it is wide and broad, and a fit haven
for great ships, there men may anchor in seven or eight fathom. To the
eastwards over against the hill of S. Anthonies, in the midst of the sound,
lies a rane of rocks under water, Suncken Rocks.
where men may sail in about it on both sides, men may easily espy them,
because it does always break upon them, within them is the road for ordinary
ships, a little before the haven, which is built with a wall. But the great
ships, lie a little further off in 6 or 7 fathom depth. On the south side of
the haven is a little tyde-haven, from the same there comes a great riffe
shooting off from the east side, toward the hill of S. Anthonies; within it is
two fathom water right before the village, from the village comes a tail of
sand, lying thwart out, within it at low water it is a fathom deep. In the
midst of the sound it is nine fathom, and at the point of Saint Anthonies 20
fathom deep.

From S. Anthonies hill to Cape de Kesgo C. Kesgo.
it is west and w. and by s. 2 leagues, that is a great Cape lying to the
eastwards of S. Andero: thwart of it is clean ground.

From Cape de Kesgo to the west point of S. Andero. it is w. and by s. 5
leagues, a little to the s. wards of the point of S. Andero, S. Andero
upon the e. point of Sardinis, is a sand-bay, there is good anchoring in ten
fathom.

From C. de Kesgo to the haven of S. Andero, the course is w.s.w. distant 2
great leagues. S. Andero lies within a Bay, there lies an Island before the
haven, men may go about it on both sides, it is deep 8 and 9 fa. but to the s.
wards of the Island it is deep 5, 6, and 7 fathom, according as men will come
near to the strand, the haven lies in first w.n.w. The Island lies a great
league within the bay: from the east point of the haven, unto the west point of
the land, it is south and north about a great league. S. Anthonies and the west
point of S. Andero, lie one from the other e. and w. about 5 leagues.

For to know the land when you fall with the land about Laredo, Laredo.
you must know that on the w. side of the haven of Laredo, lies the hill of S.
Anthonies, which is a very high hill, which men may see very far from the e.
and the w. and a little above the town of Laredo, men may see alsoo a sharp
hill like the point of a Diamond, or the point of a two hand sword, further it
is about Laredo very high double land, two, three, and at some places four
double. The hill of S. Anthonies does arise in two high hommockes, with a
valley or saddle in the midst betwixt them both within in the land lie also
two high hills with sharp topps. Above and to the w. wards of S. Anthonies,
lies a piece of land judged to be about two leagues long, which lies in five
hills, the eastermost is the lowest, and rise all higher and higher toward the
west, so that at the last to the westermost is the highest, which goes off
somewhat flat downward toward the west. Betwixt that eastermost hill and S.
Anthonies, lies a bay about a league long, called the Bay of Port, Bay of Port.
men cannot see these foresaid hills when they are close by the land, but they
must be a good ways off to seawards.

To the westwardes of these foresaid hills lies an other piece of land, which
at the east end is highest, and goes sloping off toward the west end,
almost like Portland. Betwixt that point and the five foresaid hills, lies an
other sand-Bay, where abouts stand some little houses, but by it lie many
rocks and foul ground. There abouts within the land lies the foresaid high
round sharp hill in form like the point of a sword.

S. Andero has but few hills that are easy to be known but when men are
before the haven, then they shall see to the eastwards of the town, a Castro
upon a high hill, in form like a Sugerloafe, or a hay-cock, and to the
eastwards of it is much double land of two and three heights double. But when
men come about the Cape de Kesgo, then they shall see presently the castle upon
the west land.

From S. Andero to Cape de Pinas, the course is w. or a little more no^therly
31 or 32 leagues. Betwixt them both lie these havens following.

First the haven of S. Martin, S. Martin.
or Settevilles, Settevills.
a tyde-haven lying east and west 4 leagues from S. Andero.

From thence to S. Vincent S. Vincent
alsoo a tyde-haven is five leagues distant: the haven goes in on the e^st
side; from the west side comes shooting off a ^^^le riffe, and in the midst
of the havens mouth lies a little Island, where men may go in on both sides.

From S. Vincent to Lhanes, Lhanes.
a tyde-haven, the course is west 2 or 3 leagues. Upon the west side of the
haven stands a little Church: and a little within the haven, lies a middle
plate or sand, men must go in on the w. side of the sand: these are all narrow
havens, and but little known.

From Lhanes to Rio de Sella, the course is w. 5 or 6 leagues: betwixt them
both lie along the coast many rocks, and within them many sand-bayes, where
men for need might save ships.

He that will go into Rio de Sella Rio de Sel^a
must look out for a mast which stands upon the east land close by the same men
must go in, the west side is within foul, within the mast men must anchor
before the village: this is also a tyde-haven.

From Rio de Sella to Villa Viciose Villa Viciosa.
it is west, 9 leagues, this is also a tyde-haven, but is clean, the havens
mouth lies in s.s.e. and s.e. and by s. close along by the west point of the
land, the east side is foul unto the midst of the haven: there lies a rock
with a plate right in the midst of the haven, which at low water fall dry: so
soon as men are within that rock, they must anchor within the rock; upon the
west side lies the town, men may alsoo sail up to it, and anchor there in
the shoale water.

S^x leagues to the westwards of Villa Viciosa lies the out-poynt of Sanson,
Sanson.
to the eastwards of it lies a little Island, where upon stands a little
Tower. Betwixt Sanson and the foresaid little Island is a good road in six or
seven fathom.

At the west side of Sanson is alsoo a good road right before the little haven
of Sanson in 6 or 7 fathom.

To the westw^rdes of Sanson lies Gion Gion.
with a Piere or Head that is paled off, under the which the Fishermen which
dwell there, lay their barks.

A great league to the westwards of Gion lies the Bay of Tores, a good road
for a southwest and west wind in 8 and 9 fathom. Upon the point stands a high
tower.

Three leagues to the westwards of Tores Tores.
lies Cape de Pinas, where many rocks lie off to seawards, at least a half
league of, some do say that men may sail through betwixt the point and these
rocks.

From the cape de Pinas C. de Pinas.
lies off a rane of rocks, lying at the least a half league into sea, some
say that men may sail through betwixt the point and these rocks. But a little
within or to the westwards off the Cape de Pinas, lies a great rock, betwixt
that rock and the land men may sail through.

When men are within the Cape de Pinas, then lies Avilles three leagues from
thence southsouthwest which is a good tyde-haven, where a great ship may well
go in at half flood, alsoo there is a good road before this haven in 6 and 7
fathom.

For to sail in there, men must go in by the e. land, the west-land is far
off shoale, there stands a little Chapel upon the east-land, men must sail
in close by it, and anchor a little ways within two rocks that lie on the
east side, a little within the havens mouth. The town lies a league further
up. From the west point runs off a riffe, and lies inwards along the
haven, toward the town, so that it is there very shoale on both sides. On the
west side without the haven in the bight, lie 2 great rocks right before the
little Church in the Sand-bay, men sail round about them, but it is not very
clean: but without the rocks good anchor ground in 7 or 8 fathom, over against
the little Church that stands against the high land.

From Avilles Avilles.
to Luarca Luarca.
is 6 leagues and from Luarca to Ribadeus w.s.w. 6 leagues, and from Aviles to
Ribadeus s w. and by w. 12 leagues.

From the east point off the havens mouth of Ribadeus, Ribadeus.
lies off a ledge or riffe off rocks toward the w. shore, you may found in
about it in four fathom, or four fathom and a half: or else if you keep the
little town Castropoll even without the point, so sail right in with it, then
you shall not come too near the foresaid ledge, but you shall sail far enough
along to the westwards off it. The w. point shows it self when you come in
out of the sea, like an Island; upon it at the nor^h end stands a flat tower,
almost like the tower in the Groyne, but not so great. About thwart off that
Tower lies a suncken rock a little ways from the land, you must look out for
it, and take heed off it, when there comes in any great sea, you can easily
espy it by the breaking of the sea upon it, but not with smooth water: at the
very lowest water it comes even with the water. The w. shore is foul and
rocky: there runs off to the southwards of the fotesayd Tower also a foul
ledge or riffe off rocks, at least half ways over the havens mouth, and at
the side of it you cannot use the lead. When you are past the ledge or riffe
that lies off from the east shore, you must run in about it, and edge in
somewhat to the e. shore, and sail in along by it until that you are past,
or come to the end of the foresaid ledge or riffe off rocks, which lies off
from the west shore, as soon as you shall be past it, you must luffe up
about it toward the west shore, for to give the e. shore (within the havens
mouth) a birth, which is a great ways within very flat or shoale, but on the
w. side it is deep water. There stands a little Tower on the w. shore a
little within the point, where the riffe lies off, which you shall see when
you are come within the west point, and run along by the riffe, when you get
that little tower w. or thwart of you, then are you at the end of the riffe,
then you must sail toward that little Tower, until that you come to the w.
shore, and run in along by it, until you come before the Town, there you
must lie with an anchor to seawards, and with a cable fast on the rocks.

A little league to the w. wards of Ribadeus lies a tyde-haven, he that
comes from the w. along by the shore thwart of it, should lightly think
that to be the haven of Ribadeus, but it is light to discern from it by these
marks following. On both sides of this tyde-haven are the coasts all high
land, but on both sides of the havens mouth of Ribadeus, it is low land. Also
there lies a high sharp hill and very easy to be known, which arises out
above all other hills thereabouts, which may be known at least 7 or 8 leagues
off, upon it lie some heaps of stones appearing like little houses when that
you have that hill s.s.w. from you, sail in so right with it, then you shall
be with the land right before the havens mouth of Ribadeus.

Northwest from Ribadeus about 8 leagues, lies the Cabo de Brilo, a little to
the westwards of it lies the little town Viverus. Viverus.
To the westwardes off the Bay off Cyspriaen (where men may anchor in ten
fathom) lie two great high rocks: w. north w. from these rocks about a half
league lies the Island S. Cyprian, right before the haven of Viverus, whereby
this haven is easy to beknowne you may sail about on both sides off this
Island into the haven off Viverus, in all along in the middle of the channel
south and south and by w. until you come before the town, being within, you
may anchor where you will either on the e. or w. side, it is there shoale water
of 5, 6, 7, and 8 fathom, according as you run far in.

Of the Tides and Courses and streams.
Upon the Coasts of Biscay we find no runnings of streams, but a south e. and
north w. moon makes upon the whole coast the highest water, but within the
Rivers a point later.

The fifth Demonstration. Which Delineateth the Seacoasts of Gallissia and
Portugal, between the Island of S. Cypriaen, and Camina.
FRom the havens of Viverus or from the Island S. Cyprean to C. de Ortegall,
the course is w. and by n. nine leagues.

Betwixt both, a league to the westwardes of Viverus, lies the little town of
S. Marcus with a Bay, there men may anchor in 7 or 8 fathom, and ride for a
s.s. w. and w. winds.

Two great leagues to the westwardes of S. Marcus lies the river of Caryns,
there is also good anchoring, and from thence forth unto the Castle of
Ortegall; all the coast along it is there every where clean. From Caryns to
Ortegall, the course is northwest, five leagues. Ortegall is a great point
lying out, to the eastwards of it, men may lie land-lockt for a northwest,
w.southwest, and south wind, thwart of the castle is the best road, there men
may anchor in 8 or 9 fathom: When men come from the e. Ortegall is easy to
beknowne, they shall see the castle stand against the high land.

About a league northnorthwest into sea from the C. de Ortegall, C. Ortegall.
lies a great rane off rocks: betwixt them and the foresaid Cape, men may
sail through in ten fathom.

From the Cape Ortegall to the C. Prior, the course is southwest ten leagues:
betwixt them both lies a Town called Sedaira, by the Dutch Shippers called
Siverus, Siverus.
which has a deep haven lying in southeast. The north side off the haven is
rocky and foul, which you must avoid, and run close in by the westland, which
is a high land; along by it is 12 fathom deep, within the havens mouth it is
ten fathom deep, you may sail in until you come before the town, and anchor
there in 6 or 7 fathom.

Five leagues to the westwardes of Sedeira lies the C de Prior, C. Prior.
which is a very ragged hill, to see to a far off, as if it where full of
people.

Three leagues from the Cape de Prior, lies the haven of Ferroll: betwixt them
both lie two little sand-bayes, the southermost (where in stand some little
white houses) is the greatest, and lies a little to the northwardes of the
north point off Ferroll; when you come near the Baye, the haven begins to
open it self, it lies e.n.e. and e. and by n. in, amids the channel betwixt
two high lands: when you come in, you must presently edge up to the northwardes
by the north point and anchor there a little to the westwardes of the village
it is flat and rocky ground,

When you come from the west, or from the Groyne, and will sail into the haven
of Feroll, For to sail into Ferol from the southward.
then go away from the little Island S. Blasius north, and north and by west,
and run a good ways about, without the south point of Feroll; which is very
foul and rocky until that you see the haven open, go then yet so far to
the northwards of the southwards of the south point, until that the haven do
shut again, and run then right in with the foresaid greatest sand-bay, where
in stand the two or three little white houses to the northwards off the haven,
until that you be within the south point, and the foul grounds which lie off
from it; sail then right to the north point of the haven, and along by it
toward the south side, until that haven do open it self again, and run
then (as before) along in the midst of the channel. This haven is so
narrow in the coming in, that you may cast a stone upon the land on both
sides, and in that narrow it is 20 fathom deep. When you are in the havens
mouth, you may see through betwixt the Island Sisarga, and the maine land to
the s. wards of it.

To sail from Feroll to the Groyne, For to sail into the Groyne.
the course is south, and south and by west 3 leagues, when you come near the
westland, you must give it a birth, at least of four or five Cables lengths,
because it is not very clean. When you come by the point where the Castle
stands upon you shall see then also a little Island with a little house upon
it, you may sail along by it within a half cables length, and run about
by it up to the westwardes, until you come before the Fisher village, and
anchor there in six, seven, or eight fathom.

From Cape de Prior to the Groyne, the course is south and south and by west
five leagues.

Eastnortheast from the foresaid Island where the Castle stands upon, goes
in a Sound southeast, five or six leagues within the land, to Bitanze, Haven
of Bitanze.
where you may anchor on the west side under a row of rocks, in 10 or 12
fathon, al^o you may sail so deep in, that you can see no sea.

To the northwards of that Sound, over against the point of the Groyne, lies
also an other haven or Sound, called Ponte de Mas, Ponte de Mas.
on the north side lies a row of rocks, where men run along to the
southwardes of them: men may also sail there so deep in, that they can see no
sea. A good ways within lies a great bridge over the river.

He that comes from the west off from the Island Cisarga and is bound into
the Groyne must give the north point, or the west point of the Groyne (where
the tower stands) a birth of 4 or 5 cables lengths, as before is said, which
point is rocky and foul far from the shore, and run then eastsoutheast, and
southeast about by the point, and afterward s.s.e. unto the little Island
with the Castle and about by it, as is before said.

The little Island Cisarga, Island Cisarga.
of the Dutchmen called Cesarie, is foul round about, and lies from the point
of the Groyne, due east and west distant 7 or 8 leagues, from the haven of
Feroll west and by south, from the C. Prior w.s.w. and southwest and by west,
and from the C. de Ortegall southwest, and southwest and by west 18 or 19
leagues.

From the Island Cisarga south and by west, and s.s. west lies Queres, Queres.
a good haven also for great ships, the west shore is clean, but the east
shore is foul, therefore men must sail along by the west shore, when they
are betwixt the two lands, then they must go in amids the channel, unto the
point, and then run up to the westwardes a great half league in, and anchor
there in 7, 8, and nine fathom.

From the Island Cisarga southwest and by west, and w.s.west 12 leagues lies
the east point of Monsie, called Cabo de Bylem, C. de Bylem.
which is a high steep point, with many ragged rocks lying of loose from the
land, where of the greatest, being like a tower, does show it self black, and
is called the Munck.

There lies also a great rane off rocks right before the haven or sound of
Monsie, southwest and by south from the Munck, at least two or three cables
lengths long, but the innermost end of it lies from the Monck south and by
west. When men fall with the land of Monsie, it is all double land, about the
Cape de Finesterre lies a high white sand, lying in within the land sand-bay.

Also men may see coming about the C. de Finisterre a ragged hill which
runs along so far to the southwards that men may see it before the Mores.

Caarte Vande custen van Galissien tusschen 't Eylant van S. Ciprian en Camina


He that is bound in for Monsie, M^^s e.
coming from Cisarga, must go in close along by the C. de Bylem, or Bellem:
this point is altogether a ragged high sharp land of steep rocks, as before is
said, and when you are by that point, then you must keep the Cape de Coriane a
ships length without the C. de Koto, so long until that the Church of S.
Maria come without the point of Monsie; run then in at the easter channel
s.s.e. upon these marks, until you be past the Church, then you shall see a
row of rocks, run in behind or within them, and anchor there before the
village of Monsie in 5, 6, or 7 fathom When you sail thus from the cape de
Bylem to Monsie, then the rocks (which lie in the midst before the Haven)
remain about an Engelish mile to seawards on the west side of you.

For to sail in at the wester channel, The Wester channel off Monsie.
you must go in e. s. e. indifferent near along by the land, and when the
foresaid Ladies Church comes without the point, then you must sail toward
the Rocks, which lie before Monsie, as is be foresaid, and anchor within the
rocks in 7 or 8 fathom, but run not too far in, because there shoots off
a shoaly riffe along the Haven, where off you must take heed.

The easter channel The easter channel of Monsye
is better to come into, then the wester channel, sail not into Monsie before
that you see the foresaid Church without the point, you may also anchor on the
n. side off the haven in 5, 6, or ^ fathom.

To the s. wards of the village of Monsie is a ^ay where the foresaid riff or
shoale lies before, lying e. n. e. at least 2 cab^es lengths along the Haven.

Out Ladies Church and the Munck lie one from the other n. and by e. and s. and
by w.

Southwest from the cape de Bellem 3 leag lies the Cape de Coriane. C. de
Coriane.


From cape de Coriane it is south and n. three leagues to Cape de Finisterre:
betwixt the two capes is Sand-bay where men may anchor to the e. wards of a
great rock in six or seven fathom. This is a great Bay which goes in far into
the land. At the n. side of this Bay lie rocks under water, where of men must
take heed.

About a league to the eastwards of cape de Finisterre on the south side, lies
the Haven of Seche Seche.
or Corcovia, Corco.
and is called by the Dutch Schippe-masters, Corck Bayone. Bayone.
Betwixt this Haven and the cape lie two sand-bayes, the first, or that which
is next unto the cape, is the greatest, and by the second goes in this Haven
north, in eight and nine fathom. On the east side of the Haven lies a great
Rock, and about southsouthwest off from that Rock, almost in the midst of
the Haven, lies a suncken rock under water: but run in north until you espy
the town on the west side, and anchor there in six or seven fathom. Within
upon the River lies also a Village, or little town, about n. northeast from
you.

From cape de Finisterre to the Haven off Mores, Mores.
the course is s.e. 5 great leagues, when you come about the Cape de
Finisterre, you shall see a high ragged hill which runs so far to the
southwards, that you may see it also before Mores, that is a good mark for to
know the land by thereabouts.

When the foresaid ragged Hill is N. e. from you, then are you thwart of Cape
de Finisterre, and then the hill Monte Lauro, which lies upon the n. e. point
off Mores, lies e. n. e. from you, that is a high cloven hill which is also
good to know.

Southeast three little leagues from the Cape de Finisterre, lies a rane of
rocks under water, and eastsoutheast about two leagues from these rocks, lie
also some rocks above water a little to the northwards of Monte Lauro, or the
Sound of Mores, and lie from Monte Lauro west and by s. Also there lie a deal
of rocks to the s. wards of this Sound of Mores, and right in the midst of the
Sound lies also a suncken rock about s.e. off from Monte Lauro.

He that will sail into Mores, he must bring Monte Lauro northeast and by north
of him, For to sail into Moers.
and sail in so right with it, and then he shall not come too near the foul
ground or dangers: when he comes then by Monte Lauro, he shall see the
foresaid rocks lying out to the northwardes off Monte Lauro, he must leave them
as alsoo the point of Monte Lauro two or three cables lengths on the larboard
side of him, and sail in so along by them, until that he come past the
second point; leaving the sunken rock (which lies in the midst of the Sound)
on the starboard side of him: and when the fisher village which stands to the
northwards off Monte Lauro comes to stand altogether bare, then he is within
the sunken rock which lies in the midst of the Sound south and by east
easterly from the e. end of the foresaid Fisher village.

When you come by the second point, you must run in about it within a cables
length, and edge up to the northwards, until you come before the village, or
up to the westwards before the town, where you please, and anchor there in 12
or 13 fathom.

If you will sail into Rio Roxo, For to sail into Rio Roxo
then run about without the rocks, which lie to the southwards of the Mores,
and go in southeast and by south, until that you come before the Haven of Rio
Rosso, or Roxo, then you shall see a great many off rocks, lying off from the
north land, almost unto a great rock, or Island, called Salure: betwixt these
rocks that lie out there, and the Island Salure, you may well run through
about to the northwards of the Island, but it is very narrow, by reason of the
aforesaid rocks, which lie of from the north land, therefore sail about to
the southwards of the same Island, indifferent close along by it, leaving it
on the larboard side, or to seawardes of you until that you see the Sound
open, and then run in keeping the middle of the channel, unto that Island
Roxo, which you shall see lie in the midst of the haven, when you come near
it, you may anchor under the s. land, there are two Sand-bayes, where is good
anchor ground.

About two leagues southwest from Rio Roxo lies a suncken rock, John Claesz.
Bors of Sardam, did sail upon it, and there lost his ship the 20 of February
1613. in the night.

From Rio Roxo, or the Island Salure, unto Ponto Vedra, Ponte Vedra.
or the Island Blydones, the course is southsoutheast four leagues, betwixt
them both it lies an Island called Monte Carbela; M. ^^rbela Blydones.
within it, is three fathom deep. Right before the haven of Ponte Vedra lies
the Island Blydones, which men may sail round about. On the north side it is
not deeper then five or six fathom. There lie also within the Sound, on the
north side two rocks called the Boos or Oxen. On the south side of Blydones is
the right fareway for to sail into Ponte Vedra, this haven lies in northeast
until within the Island; somewhat further in the midst on the haven lies also
another little Island, which you must also go to the southwards of, therefore
go in eastnortheast along by south-land, until that you see the flat tower
which stands upon the south-land, and then you must run over a banck, right
on with the point of Ponte Vedra, within it lies the town, twhart off the
flat tower men may anchor in 8 or 9 fathom: This haven is at some places four
fathom deep.

Five leagues to the s. wards of the Islands of Blydones lie the Islands of
Bayone, Islands of Bayone.
when men come in out of the sea, right with them, then these Islands do seem
to be all gray and black rocks, and lie to see to, as if they were three
Islands, although that the sea do run through them, but at one place, betwixt
each is a saddle or valley.

Within the land along over these Islands, men shall see two high hills very
easy to be known, the eastermost has three high hommocks, and the westermost
two with valleys betwixt the hommocks; a little to the eastwards off the
eastermost hill men shall see a white. Abbey stand against the high land,
whereby this land is very easy to be known.

You may sail within these Islands of Bayone either to the northwards For to
sail into Bayone. From the northwards.
or to the southwards; but at the north e. point of the Islands lies a rock
under water, about a cables length off from them, where of you must take heed,
and anchor in 10, 11, or 12 fathom on the east side of the Islands.

He that will sail in to the northwards, must run in betwixt the Islands and
the maine land, keeping near about the middle off the channel, but nearest to
the Islands until that the Sound off Vigo, or Cannas be open, and then sail
in to the eastwards there is a broad Sound, where men may anchor on both sides,
to wit, on the south side before Vigo. Vigo
and on the north side before Cannas Cannas.
in twelve or thirteen fathom.

Also men may sail further in about the south point of Rondella, where men may
save a ship in the oaze, without anchor or cables.

At the point of Vigo lies a little Island, he that comes in to the
northwards of the Islands, and is bound in for Bayone, may sail through
betwixt that little Island and the point Vigo, right in with Bayone, to wit,
a^^^^st a little to the westwards of the point, until he ^^me before the
town, and anchor there in 4, 5, or 6, fathom.

Betwixt that foresaid little Island, and the point of Vigo, it is at high
water 4 fathom and a half, and at low water three fathom and a half deep,
men must (sailing through there) give the point off Vigo a birth, because of
some suncken rocks that lie off from it. When as men lie in the road before
Bayone, in 5 or 6 fathom, they may see the Islands of Blydones through betwixt
the foresaid point of Vigo, and that little Island.

From that same little Island lies to the westwards another little Island or
rock, betwixt them both it is foul, so that men cannot sail through betwixt
them, and from that westermost little Island lies a foul riffe ot ledge of
rocks, s.w. off toward the point of the land off Bayone, where of men must
take very good heed, whether you come from the n. wards and will sail through
betwixt that riffe and the Islands off Bayone, or else come in from the s.
wards, betwixt the Islands and the maine, and will go in for Bayone.

That riffe lies at low water in many places dry, the outermost rocks
thereof, and the point of Bayone, where the Castle stands upon, lie southeast
and southeast and by east, and northwest and northwest and by west an English
mile asunder, therefore he that comes from the northwards, and will go into
Bayone to the westwards off that riffe, that is betwixt the riffe and the
Islands let him go so long to the southwards, (...) that the Castle of Bayone
come to be e.s.e. and (...) by south from him, and sail then toward it, (...)
then he shall run far enough along to the southwards of it.

At the south end of the Island of Bayone, lies a great rock, with a deal of
small rocks round about it, men may sail very close along by them, but at
high water the outermost rocks lie under water, where of men mus^ be mindful,
close by the rocks it is 20, and 25, and 26, fathom deep. From the point of
the maine land over against the south end of the Islands, runs off a ledge
of rocks, whereupon it breaks very much, when the sea is grown, where of also
men must take heed.

When you come from the southwards, or out of the sea, and will sail in for
Bayone, about to the southwards of the Islands with a southerly or southwest
wind, then run right with the south point of the outermost land of Bayone,
Island of Bayone.
until you come near about a half league of the land, and the^ along by
the shore, unto the outer point on the south side of the coming into the Bay,
where that foresaid riffe runs of, which lies off low, give that riffe a
birth, and run in betwixt it and the foresaid rocks at the end of the Islands,
northeast, or eastnortheast in, according as you shall come in out of the sea;
leaving the riffe on starboard, and the rocks with the Islands on the larboard
side until that you come to the end, or to the n. wards of the riffe, the
north end, or the outtermost point of that riffe at the s. point, and the point
Bayone where the Castle stands upon, lie nearest e. and by north, and w. and
by south a little league asunder. When as then you have the foresaid riffe (on
the south side) upon your broad side, or else are too the northwardes of it; and
that the Castle do stand east, or thereabouts from you, go then right in with
the Castle leaving that foresaid other riffe (which lies off southwest from
the little Islands at the point of Vigo) on the larboard side of you. If you
bring the point of the Castle not to the southwardes of e. s. e. then you
cannot take any hurt of the northermost riffe.

The outer rocks of that northermost riffe, (which shoots off from the two
foresaid little Islands) and the riffe which shoots off from the south point
of the land of Bayone, where men must sail through betwixt lie one from the
other southwest, and southwest and by south, and northeast and northeast and by
north about an English mile asunder. When you come near the Castle, then come
not very near the shore, which is not very clean, and when, as then you come
thwart of the innermost point of the Castle before that you begin to see the
Town of Bayone, from behind the point, you must look well out before you: for
from that same innermost point, and from the Castle, there lies off a suncken
rock about half a cables length from the foresaid point, whereupon remains
at low water no more then nine or ten foot water, keep therefore (thwart off
it) somewhat off from the point. When as you begin to see the Town off Bayone,
then luffe up suddenly south and sail before the Town, and anchor there in
five or six fathom, where you please, or else that the points of the Castle
come against the westermost Island of the two which lie off from the north
point of the Bay, or point of Vigo, there it is good oasie ground that holds
well, set your anchors when you moore, northwest and southwest, the best anchor
to the southeast; from thence over the high land you shall have commonly the
hardest winds.

If you must turn too and again into the bay, For to sail into Vigo or Cannas
from the southwards.
then take very good heed, when you run off from the Castle, that you run not
to far over s.s.e. right before the Town, s.e. and by east, and e.s.e. from
the road about a musketshot, lies another sunken rock, which at low water is
even uncovered, it lies a small cables length off from a little point in the
south point of the Bay, whereupon stands a little house, appearing a far of
like a great green rock; you must be very careful of it; especially when you
run over toward the southsoutheast.

But he that is bound into Vigo or Cannas to the south wards of the Islands,
shall sail in betwixt that southermost Island and the point of the land of
Bayone, all along in the middle of the channel, northeast, or northeast and
by north in, at least two great leagues, keeping the norther haven two ships
lengths open, so long until Cannas come to the north-land without the point of
Vigo: and then he must leave the point of Vigo on the starboard side of him,
and run in (keeping the middle of the channel) betwixt the northland and the
Town Vigo, and anchor there either before Cannas or Vigo, where he pleases
in ten or twelve fathom,

A little to the northwards of Camina, lies on the coast a high steep hill,
above in the top with a clift or saddle, being called S. Rego, S. Rego.
it is almost of fashion like Monte Lauro, but at least once so high again,
this hill is a very good mark for to know the places thereabouts About half
ways betwixt this hill and Bayone, lies an Abbey upon the side of the land,
that is also a good mark for to know Bayone for him that comes from the
southwardes, but the chiefest marks are the two foresaid high Hills within
Bayone, the one with two, the other with-three hommocks, when that with the
three valleys or saddles is e.s.e. from you run in then right with it, you
shall not fail to fall with the land, right with the Islands.

Five leagues to the southwards of the Islands of Bayone, lies the haven of
Comina, a broad haven, where you must go in (with great ships) at the highest
water. In the havens mouth, which lies in northeast and by east, lies a rock
nearest the south side; close to the northwards of this rock, is the deepest
water, for to sail in or out. Within in the haven, on the north side, lies a
little Island, and upon it stands a little Tower, you must keep that over the
Tower, which stands upon the north land, and so must run in right with them.

In this havens mouth is at half flood two fathom water.

At the north side of the haven it is altogether shoale water, and very rocky
and foul: there shoots off a ledge of rocks or riffe where of me^ must take
good heed.

Of the tides and courses of the streams.
On these coasts, as on the former, a southwest and northeast moon makes
high water.

A southwest and northeast moon makes full sea at the foresaid places, on the
seacoast, and within the havens a point later.

A northeast and southwest Moon makes on these coasts full sea, like as on all
the coasts lying on the great sea, there go also no streams along the
land, because (through the swelling off the Ocean sea) the flood comes right
on against the coasts, and falls right in and out at the Havens.

the description here under following.

The Cape de Finisterre shows it self with the land to the southwards of it,
as is pourtrayed in this and the figure following, when the Ragged hill
stands east from you 3 or 4 leagues, and then you shall see the land to the

The sixth Demonstration, Where in Are showed the Coasts of Portugal, from
Camina to Passage.
SEven leagues to the southwards of Camina lies Viana Viana.
upon a river. From the north point lies off a ledge off rocks thwart over
before the mouth of the river, and upon the south shore, stand two
Fire-towers. If you will sail in to this river off Viana, coming from the
northwards, or out of the sea, then ran so long to the southwards until that
the two foresaid Fire-towers upon the south side of the rivers mouth, come one
to the other, and then run in right with them toward the strand, until that
the little Tower upon the north-land come over the two houses; keep them one to
the other, and run then to the rock with the mast, and sail along close to
the eastward of it, and then you run in along over the Bar or the shoalest
of the rivers mouth, there is at low water with an ordinary tide two fathom
depth. When you are past the foresaid rock with the mast then you shall see yet
a head another rock with a mast or beacon, which lies on the north side of the
river: run in like wise close along to the southwards of it, and afterward
indifferent close along by the north-land, until you come before the Town,
there runs of sometimes a little riffe which you must give a birth to, and
anchor before the town. When you lie before the town, there lies a little
Island to the southwards of you, where upon stands a little Chapel: to the
westwardes of that little Island lies a great Bank, which at low water is
uncovered, behind that banck it is five and six fathom, and before Viana
seven, eight, and nine fathom deep; when you come in, they may run in about to
the southwards of this foresaid Banck, and come out again before the town, by
the little Island, where the little house stands upon.

When you come in about a bow shot within the second rock with the mast, there
you may well let fall your anchor and bring Cables on the south shore, and
moore there by four cables.

Men may anchor without in the road in 12 fathom, there is the cleanest ground
for to take in a Pilot. It is a narrow and dangerous bar for to come into.

From Viana to Port a Port, the course is south and by east 12 or 13 leagues,
betwixt both lies Villa del Conde, Villa del Conde.
seven leagues from Viana and from Metelyn. Villa del Conde is a broad haven,
before the haven mouth lie many rocks, where men may sail in about them on
both sides, to the northwards or to the southwards of them it is five and six
fathom deep; further in lies a banck thwart over the haven of two fathom at
high water: within in the haven it is 3 or 4 fathom deep, on the n. side it is
all full of rocks, which lie most under water, but on the south side it is
deepest and surest, and good lying in five and six fathom.

Four leagues to the southwardes of Villa del Conde lie out the great rocks,
Rocks.
called Lesons, Lesons.
right before a little Broad haven of two fathom depth, called Metelyn, and
southwest from the south point of the foresaid rocks Lesons; about a half
league to seawards, lies a suncken rock under water: betwixt the land and the
Lesons it is 6 and seven fathom deep.

A league to the southwardes off the rocks Leson lies Port a Port. Port a
Port.
From the north point of the rivers mouth lie off many rocks, almost thwart
over the channel. For to sail in there, you must run in close along to the
southwardes of the outermost rock, even so near by it that you may cast with a
stone upon it. There stands a little Chapel upon the north shore right
against the rock with the cross, and also a little white house upon the north
shore somewhat further up upon the river, bring them one in the other, and run
in so right with them until you be past the Castle. In sailing in so, you
shall not find less upon the shoalest of the Bar, then 17 or 18 foot water
at half flood, and shall not come too near a suncken rock, which lies
without in the rivers mouth, somewhat nearer the south shore the^ the north,
whereupon there remains at low water no more then 11 or 12 foot water. Being
within the Castle, go then right toward the rock with the cross, and so
close along to the southwards of it, that you may reach it with a boat hoock,
or else you must run in three or 4 ships lengths to the the southwards off it,
or along by the south-land, until you be past the rock with the cross, for
to avoid a suncken rock, which lies thwart of it a little to the southwards of
it, and at low water is no more then eight foot under water. Being a little
past the rock with the cross, go then up along in the middle of the
channel, until you come thwart of a great white Tower upon the north-land,
there you may anchor in 4 or 5 fathom, or sail before the Town, here it is 3
and 4 fathom deep. A little past the rock with the cross is a shoale,
whereupon remains at low water no more then 11 foot water, so that with
ships that draw 12 foot water, men must stay for high water, it flows
there six foot up and down with an ordinary tide.

On the south side of the river goes in also a Land-d^ep to the southwards of
the foresaid suncken rock, which lies in the rivers mouth, where the Pilots
sometimes bring ships in and out, that is a good channel, and oftentimes it
is east too again of the sea, so that there is no certainty to be written of
it, that men should trust upon.

From Port a Port to Avero, the course is south, ten leagues: betwixt them both
it is all along a clean sandstrand, where men may be bold to come near the
shore every where in ten or twelve fathom.

Within the land upon the high land lies a black hommock in the land, when
that lies eastsoutheast from you, then you are open before Avero: when you
cannot see the black hommock Carmole, then lies there a rough sand-hill to the
northwards of the Bar, when that is thwart of you, then are you a half
league to the northwards of the Bar of Avero.

If you will sail in over the Bar of Avero, and that you come before it in
six or seven fathom, then take heed to three beakons made off mast, which
stand upon the south-land, bring them one in the other, and sail in so right
with them east and by south, and e.s.e. in over the bar, there is coming in,
at half tide, no more then two fathom water, until rhat you come by the
beakons, you shall so (being come within the points) sail along by a dry
sand on the larboard side, edge then up northnortheast, and northwest about by
that foresaid dry sand, until you come close to the norther land, and run in
by it, and then you shall leave all the other shoals on the starboard side,
until that you see the river open, and then you shall see a little house upon
the strand on the west side, go then from thence up into the river, east and
by south, and eastsoutheast, keeping the middle off the channel betwixt the
two lands, until you come before the Saltponds or Avero, where you may lade
your ship with salt.

The Coast of Portugal about Viana, is very easy to Cust van PORTVGAL to

be known, by the foresaid hill of S. Rego, which is exceeding high, and
lies on the sea side: the high land of Viana lies two or three double within
it.

Betwixt Viana, Villa del Conde, and Port a Port, men shall see along the
coast many towers and little houses, Villa del Conde men shall see at sea like
a great Town,

The River of Port a Port men may know by the rocks Lesons, they are very high,
and lie a little to the northwardes of the River.

The Cape de Montego is a high point, and within it in the land are high
mountains. The Cape is sometimes taken to be the Rock, but is easy to be
discerned from it, because of the Burlings, which lie here to the s. wards, and
to the n. wards of the rock.

The Cape de Montego lies from Avero s.s.w. distant 7 leagues: a league to the
southwards off it lies Pissage, or the River of Montego, a broad haven. From
the Cape de Montego runs off a foul ledge of Rocks, a good ways from the
shore, which men must avoid. Under the Cape men may ride for northerly wind^
in 7 or 8 fathom a northnorthwest wind comes right from the point, for
southerly winds men may anc^or to the southwards off the river of Montego.

From the south point of the river runs off a sand riffe when you sail in
there, and that you come in out of the sea, it shows as if you might sail
in^o the s. wards of that riffe, but it is not to be done: you must sail into
the northwards of it. Upon the north point stands the little village S.
Catharina, and a little to the northwards of it a Fisher village, called
Buarcos. Upon the north side within the havens-mouth stands a lime kilne,
with a wood of Fig Trees, when you bring them one in the other, and then sail
so right in with them, you run in right in the channel, there is sometimes no
more then twelve or thirteen foot water at a half flood: you may not
certainly trust to the description of this haven; for in regard it is there
sand-ground, it does shift sometimes with the great Freshut that come off the
River, and alsoo with storms out of the sea. From Cape de Montego to Peniche,
or Nova Lisbona, (at the Cabo del Fisiron, which is the point within the
Burlings) the course is southwest and by south ten leag. there lies of a rock
from the point, to the southwards of it is a great bay, where men may run in
behind it with barks, and lie landlockt. In that bay lies a little town
against the high land called Artogie, a little to the southwardes of the Cape
del Fisiron lies a high round hommock, which the Dutchmen call young Roxent.

From the cape Montego to the Burlings; the course is s. w. 12 or 13 leagues.
Behind the Burlings is a good road and anchor ground, under the great Island
before the Hermitage, there you may anchor in ten fathom, you may come in there
from the northwards or from the southwardes, it is there broad and wide, and
very where clean.

Of the Tides and Courses and streams.
A southwest and northeast Moon makes at all these places (on the sea side)
high water, and within in the havens a point or two later according as they lie
far within the land.

As on all the coasts of Portugal, even so here alsoo on these coasts a s. w.
and n. e. moon makes the highest water.

A s.w. and n.e. Moon makes on these coasts full sea, within the havens a

The seventh Demonstration, In which The sea Coasts of Portugal, from Pissage
to S. Uves or Setubal are deciphered.
FRom the south point of the River runs off a sand-riffe; when you sail in
there, and that you come in out of the sea, it shows as if you might sail
into the southwardes of that riffe, but it is not to be done: you must sail
into the northwards of it. Upon the north point stands the little village S.
Catharina, and a little to the northwards of it a Fisher village, called
Buarcos. Upon the north side within the havens-mouth stands a lime kilne,
with a wood off Fig Trees, when you bring them one in the other, and then sail
so right in with them, you run in right in the channel, there is sometimes
no more then twelve or thirteen foot water at a half flood: you may not
certainly trust to the description of this haven; for in regard it is there
sand-ground, it does shift sometimes with the great Freshuts that come off the
River, and also with De Cust van PORTVGAEL Het Zuydlyckste deel, Beginnende van
Pissage tot aen S. Vues alias Setubal.
storms out of the sea. From Cape de Montego to Peniche, or Nova Lisbona, (at
the Cabo del Fisiron, which is the point within the Burlings) the course is
southwest and by south 12 leagues, there lies off a rock from the point, to
the southwards of it is a great bay, where men run in behind it with barks,
and lie landlockt. In that bay lies a little town against the high land called
Artogie, a little to the southwardes of the cape del Fisiron lies a high round
hommock, which the Dutchmen call young Roxent.

From the C. Montego to the Burlings, the course is s. w. twelve or thirteen
leagues. Behind the Burlings is a good road and anchor ground, under the great
Island before the Hermitage, then you may anchor in ten fathom, you may come in
there from the northwards or from the southwardes, it is there broad and wide,
and every where clean.

From the Burlings to the Rock, or Roxent, the course is south and by east, and
southsoutheast sixteen leagues, but from the Cape del Fisiron (behind the
Burlings) to the Rock, the coast lies south and north fifteen or sixteen
leagues. The Rock or Roxent is a point of land, very easy to be known,
although you be a great ways off, yet you shall always see the sharp hommock
of the Abbey of Syntra.

A great league to the eastwards of the point of Roxent, or the Rock, lies the
road of Cascalis, Cascalis.
where men may lie land-lockt for a northwest, north, and northeast wind, in
12 or 13 fathom, so deep or shoale as they will. A great league to the eastward
of Cascalis, lies the point of S. Julian, or S. Gillians S. Gillians or S.
Gilliens
whereupon stands a strong castle, that is the north point of the River of
Lisbone, the norther channel of the River goes in within a bowls cast
along by it.

For to sail into the norther channel, For to sail in at the norther
channel.
you must run in, along within the length off a mast along by the foresaid
point, but coming before the castle of S. Gillians, you must edge somewhat
over toward the Carrick deep, for to avoid some foul ground and rocks, which
lie on the east side of the Castle. Being past that a little, you may luffe up
again toward the northter shore and sail along by it to Restiers, and so
forth even to Lisbone, men do commonly anchor before the Village of Bolyn in
twelve or thirteen fathom. Men must take heed not to come into this channel
with calm weather, and with an ebb, which falls very strong upon the
norther Cachops: this channel of S. Gillians lies in east and by south; being
within, you must sail up e. n. e. and n. e. and by east, and when you come
against the Abbey at Restier, then you must edge somewhat over toward the
south-land, else you must keep the northland along.

For to sail into the Carrick deep, For to sail in at the Carrick deep
you shall bring Cascalis, over the west-poynt of Roxent, and keep it so,
until that the little Tower (which you shall see stand above the Abbey at
Restiers) come over the white Abbey which stands the farthest from Restier,
to wit, over S. Katherines Abbey or Cloister, go then north, and n. e. and by
n. in keeping these marks standing thus, until that you come within the point
off S. Gillies, and then go in along by the north-land to Restiers within
the Castle, and anchor there where you think it best. Upon these marks you
may sail in and out at the Carrick deep. If you come from the westwardes and
will go in to the Carrick deep, then bring Cascalis over the west end of
Roxent, and sail so about the norther Cachops, until that the Town off
Lisbone come within two ships lengths near to the southside of the River, and
then further in northeast and by north, when as then you shall see the sand-bay
within the point of S. Gillians, then are you in the righ fareway.

But if it should happen, that you could not see the town, or the little
Tower, then keep the sand-bay (which lies within S. Gillians point north e.
land by north from you and sail so n. e. and n. e. and by north in, and take
the sounding of the norther Cachops in eight or nine fathom: when you begin to
come against S. Gillians point, sail then indifferent close along by the
northland, as is before said.

He that will turn out or in to the Carrick deep, must bring the foresaid
little tower that stands within the land, a ships length to the s. wards,
and a ships length to the northwardes off the foresaid Abbey or Cloister off
S. Katherines, and then cast about every time, and so turn too and again out
and in.

Also come not with calmes in this channel, (neither bound inwards nor
outward) with an ebb, for it falls very strong over the east end of the
Cachops.

If you will run out at the Carrick deep, you must look out for the foresaid
little Tower: when it comes out from under that high land, bring it then a
little to the westwardes of the second white Abbey or Cloister, and go away
southwest and by south, and then the little tower shall come to the Cloister.

But if you must turn out too and again, then you must be very careful of
your tides, for the streams fall strong over the Cachops, so that it is very
dangerous with calmes to come in or out at those channels, but especially in
sailing out with an ebb, for it falls thwart over the Cachops.

From Roxent to S. Uves point, the course is southeast and by s. 10 leag. that
is also a apoynt easy to be known, by a high round hill which lies on it, also
men shall see the top of the castle of Sisembre upon a flat hill like a great
top or ridge of a country house.

S. Uves point is called Cape de Pitcher* and by the Dutchmen Cape de Spichel,
a little to the southwards about the point, is a rent or clift in the land,
before it is good riding in 9 and 10 fathom. Before Sisember men may also
anchor in 15 or 16 fathom.

Of the Tides and Courses and streams.
On these Coasts, as on the former, a southwest and northeast moon makes
high water.

A southwest and northeast moon makes full sea at the foresaid places, on the
seacoast, and within the havens a point later.

A northeast and southwest Moon makes on these coasts full sea, like as on all
the coasts lying on the great sea, there go also no streams along the
land, because (through the swelling off the Ocean sea) the flood comes right
on against the coasts, and falls right in and out at the Havens.

lies Saint Uves, there lies a great bancke before the havens mouth. Beneath
the high land upon the water side, stands a white Castle, when that is
northnortheast from you, then are you right before the havens mouth.

If you will sail over the bancks into S. Uves For to sail in over the Bank
before Saint Uves.
coming off from C. Pitcher, or S. Uves point, then keep the west point off
Sisember a ships length without the east point, and go then east, and east and
by north on, until that the castle of Palmelo which stands above S. Uves,
comes in a valley over the foresaid white Castle upon the water side. Sail
then northnortheast right in with them, until you come within the Castle that
stands upon the waterside, and then in along within a cables length by the
north-land, northeast, and by east until you come before the town off S.
Uves, or Setuball. But when the Castle of Palmelo comes under the land, that
you cannot see the same any more, there Cust van ANDALVZIA, En Algarve,
Beginnende van Capo de Spichel tot aen het Clif.
stands alsoo a white house on the north-side of the Castle that stands on
the water side, keep that then so standing, and run in right with them, until
you come within the white Castle, and go then in (as before is said) along
by the north-land, until you come before the Town of Saint Uves, and anchor
by the same Town, before the Fisher village, in six or seven fathom. Upon the
bancke is at half flood three fathom and a half water, when you sail in over
it, you shall find at least 7 diverse shoals. There goes in also a channel
along by the south-land, but that is only for barks: betwixt the souther
channel and the righ deep lie the banckes at some places so shoale, that they
lie almost above water.

For to find the deepest water in sailing out over the banck off Saint Uves,
with ships that draw much water, do thus: when you sail out from the white
Castle, then bring the foresaid white house over the north-side of the Castle,
that stands on the waterside, so that you may see directly through betwixt
them, and keep them so standing, until Saint Uves point begin to come without
the east-poynt of Sisember, then bring the white house to the south side of the
Castle, and run so out, you shall have there the deepest water. But when you
can see that Castle of Pelmelo, that is a direct longst mark for to run over
the bancke: And then that white Castle must be from you n. northeast northerly.

It is from Saint Uves point to C. de S. Vincent south somewhat easterly 29
leag. betwixt both are no known havens. Salines ^alines.
a little river lying half ways, is also unknown.

From S. Uves to Cape. S. Vincent, the coast lies most south and by west about
32 leagues, betwixt both lie some high steep hills, which men do call the
Salines, which are very good marks for to know this coast by, but above all
serve for the knowledge of this coast of Algarve, or of the Cape de S. Vincent,
the Vighebergen, or Mount Chigo, which lie within Lagos and may be seen far
off at sea. A half league to the northwardes of C. S. Vincent lies a high
cliffe in the land, that is somewhat whitish, and higher then the other land;
when you see that, then you are by the cape de S. Vincent. Upon the point of
the cape stands a broken Abbey or Cloister, and close by the point lies a
high rock, being called by the Dutch sailors Monninck strand.

A little about the point of the Cape S. Vincent men may anchor in a sand-bay,
for a n. and n.w. wind in twenty fathom.

Road under Cape S. Vincent
About the second point, to the eastwardes off the Cape, is another Sand-bay,
there is a good road for a northwest and north wind in 14 or 15 fathom. From
the Cape de S. Vincent to Cape S. Mary's, or Faro, it is east or a little more
southerly ninteene or twenty leagues: betwixt them both lie Lagos, or Laves,
and Villa Nova. From Cape S. Vincent to Lagos, it is east and by north six
leagues, there is a tyde-haven through betwixt the rocks, behind a strand of
chindle, which falls dry at low water, men may alsoo ride there for a
northwest, westnorthwest, and north wind, in ten or twelve fathom.

Villa Nova Villa Nova.
lies about four leagues to the eastwards of Lagos; betwixt both, 3 leagues
from Lagos, and one from Villa Nova, lies a suncken rock, whereoff men must
take heed. Villa Nova, is a good haven, it lies in north, and north and by
west, at half flood you shall have there two fathom water within in the haven
on the east side lies a little Island or rock, and upon it stands a Tower or
little house, also there stands upon the land a great mast with a barrel upon
the top off it: when the little Tower, or little house, and the mast come one
in the other, then you must sail right in with them into the haven, along by
the east-land until you be past the little Tower, the west side is flat and
shoale, when as you come by the mast, then you must go up to the westwardes
before the Town of Villa Nova, there you may anchor in four or five fathom.

From Villa Nova to Faro, Faro.
or cape de S. Maria, it is about 9 leagues. Upon the strand stands a
fire-tower and from the point shoots of a riffe which men must avoid; into
the haven off Faro men must go in from the eastwards, it lies west, and
westnorthwest in, and they must leave the tower on the larboard side, and run
in two or three fathom; being within, they may anchor over against the Town
off Faro under the Island in three fathom, it is upon the bar at half flood
2 fathom deep.

The Cape S. Mary's shows it self at sea (when you first see it) in one
round hommock, which is a good mark for to know the whole coast of the Condado
by.

Five leagues northeast and by east from Cape S. Maria or Faro lies Tavila,
that is a crooked shoaly Bar, which almost every year does shift, and is
not to trust to for to sail into it, unless it were first beakond, or set
with buys, it is at half flood scarce two fathom deep men lie there a little
within the sand-hills in four fathom.

From Tavilla to Ayemont, the course is eastnorth e. 5 leagues.

Ayemont is a deep Bar, and one of the best havens in the whole Condaet, it
lies in northwest by the eastland, at half flood it is three fathom deep,
there lies some shoals before the havens, the marks thereof are these There
stands a tree upon the east side, of the haven or-rivers mouth when Ayemonte
comes right against over the tree, then are you to the eastwards off the
shoals or sands, which lie before the haven, then you must go toward the foot
strand, and lead it in along by it northwest, and northwest and by west,
when you you are within, you must go up to the northwards before the Town, or
if you will go before Port Maria; the northwest course will bring you there;
within, it is wide and broad, and six or seven fathom deep.

There goes in alsoo a haven by the westland, where men come in, right out of
the sea, but that by the e. land is the best.

From Ayemont to Leepe, Leepe.
or S. Michaels, the course is east and by north seven leagues. Leepe has
uncertain bars which oftentimes shift, where men may not trust themselves to
sail into without a Pilot, the Bar that goes into the e. wards of the
great Island, is held to be the best. from thence they must go up to the
westwardes toward Taron, and the River, and so come to Leepe, and there they
take their lading in before the deep.

The Bar of S. Michaels Saint Michaels.
was wont to run thwart over into sea and to be at half flood three fathom
deep, and before S. Michaels five fathom: from thence men may com through
within over the shoals at high water into the River at Leepe. Also men were
wont to come in by Taron; Taron.
but for certainty it is needful to take in a Pilot for these Bars.

From S. Michaels to Palos, Palos.
or Saltees, Saltees.
the course is east and east and by south 7 leagues, here men sail into the
great Condaet, this haven goes in at the west end of the Rooduyn; thee
stands a great broad tree to the westwards off that white cliffe, that you
must keep over a red sand-hill, like as if it were red earth: this sand-hill
goes sloping down: Run in upon these marks unto the strand, about north
and north and by west, then shall the Tower Odier which stands above Wolves,
Wolves.
come over the east side of the havens mouth, keep them so standing, and sail
along by the strand, without 2 cables lengths until you come about the
point, and then you run up north to Palos or northwest to Wolves, and anchor
there in six or seven fathom.

It is deep there within, six, seven, and also three and four fathom in
sailing up according as men do sail far up, or else not, this Bar is upon
the shoalest at half flood three fathom and a half, but within it is five
fathom deep.

There comes also a channel running out of the sea betwixt the sands, then
Wolves comes to the east side of the havens mouth, and men sail n. n. w. in;
when they are within the havens mouth, then they must do as before is said.
This channel is three fathom deep.

For knowledge of the land hereabouts you shall understand that at the west end
of the Roduyn, lies a white steep land, cliffy, being reddish earth or
chalk: he that falls there with, may think that he is by the havens mouth of
Saltees, upon it stand some little bushes of trees, else the land is all without
trees, reddish sand, therefore called Roduyn, or Red sand-hill.

Of the Tides and Courses and streams.
A southwest and northeast Moon makes at all these places (on the sea side)
high water, and within in the havens a point or 2 later, according as they lie
far within the land.

As on all the coasts of Portugal, even so here also on these coasts a
southwest and north e. moon makes the highest water.

A s. w. and n. e. Moon makes on these coasts full sea, within the havens a
point or two later, according as they lie far within the land.

A n. e. and s. w. Moon makes high water at the C. S. Vincent, and at the
Cape S. Maria, also on the coasts lying betwixt them both.

But to the eastwardes on the Condaet makes full sea a s. w. and by s. and s.
s. w. moon.

then sail along the red sand-hils, so long until that you get the town of
S. Lucas in sight about e.s.e. from you, there lies a white cloister to the
eastwards of the town, against the high land, and there stands a great tree
upon the high land, bring the tree even to the northside or the cloister. so
that you may almost see through betwixt them but not over the Cloister, keep
them so standing, and sail right in with them, and so you shall not come to
near the rocks to take hurt of them, and you shall have upon the shoalest at low
water and neepe tides, 3 fathom, and at high water 22 foot, or scarce 4 fathom.
When the Castle of Chipiona and the Church begin to come one in the other,
then you come to the first rocks or shoals, when the Church and Castle are
right one over the other, then they stand southsouthwest from you, then you are
upon the shoalest of all, but when the Castle with the Church come again one
through the other, then you get again deeper water, 3 fathom and a half, and
4 fathom at low water with a neepe tide, sail in along upon the foresaid
marks of the cloister and the tree, but take good heed that you bring not the
tree over the Quire, at the south end off the cloister, for you should then
come very close to the rocks, rather bring the tree a little to the northwards
of the cloister, for you can not lightly take hurt of the red sand-hils, but
you may borrow off them upon your lead in 3, and 4, fathom. There stands also a
mill to the eastwards of the town, take heed that you bring not that also over
the round Cloister that stands a little to the eastward beneath at the town,
but keep them a handspikes length asunder, and then you sail in the best deep.
But if the foresaid mill, and that round Cloister come one in the other when
you sail in, then you shall (without sail) come upon the rocks or shoals When
you are within over the shoalest, sail then toward the strand of S. Lucas,
until that you see altogether open into the river, for to avoid the riffe that
shoots off from the n.w. point of the river, sail on along by the shore
and anchor before the little Church with the crosses (which stands below in the
sand hills) in 5, 6, or 10, or 12, fathom, so near as you please Men may also
turn our at this same channel with indifferent ships or barks, but they must
take good heed, it is not there very broad.

For to sail along by Sipiona.
There goes in also a channel by the land of Sipionen or Chipiona, for to find
it, you shall sail in within two cables lengths near by the foresaid land,
until that you be within the second shoale, then you must edge somewhat off
from the land, until you come upon the foresaid marks off the Cloister and the
great tree, then you must run in along upon them, as is before taught. The
river of S. Lucas is easy to know, by the Rooduyn, or red sand-hills which lie
to the westwards of it.

From Sipione to Cales Males, the course is s.e. 9 leag. Cales Cales.
is known by the mountain off Granade, when that is eastnortheast and east
and by north from you, sail then right in with it, and you shall not sail to
fall right before Cales. At the point off Sipona lie many rocks above water,
and betwixt the point of Sipiona Cales. Four leagues from Sipiona lies Rotta,
there shoots off a great ledge of rocks from the point.

He that will go into the bay of Cales, For to sail into the bay off Cales.
let him run in right with the rocks which lie on the west side of the Bay,
being called los Puercos, Los Puercos.
and within two cables lengths in all along by them in 6 or 7 fathom, until
he come before the town of Cales, and anchor there so deep as he pleases, in
8, 10, 12, or 15 fathom, the faireway lies in most eastsoutheast and southeast
and by east.

There lies a rock under water, called the Diamant, Diamant.
about n.n.e. and n. e. and by north from the Puercos, a great half league.
When S. Katharins chapel upon the northland is e.n.e. from you, then are you
thwart of that rock, there is at half flood 3 fathom water upon it, the marks
off this rock are these: Marks of the Diamant.
When Mary Church comes over the north end of Cales, (that is a Cloister
which stands without Cales) there stands also a house upon the hill, where
men go along by, when they go to Sheres, when that house comes over the
chapel which stands upon the water side: to the westwards of port Marie:
when these marks come together one in the other, then you should sail upon
the foresaid rock, there is upon the shoalest of it at high water, 3 fathom and
a half water upon it. But set the two high hills which are to the southwards
of the way of Sheres, that they be a little asunder, and that they do not
come one in the other, then you cannot sail upon this rock. The Puercos rock
lie from the north-poynt off Cales about half a league. He that lies before
Cales in the road, has Puntall south from him, or there abouts, according as
he lies near to Cales. But to the southwards of Cales lies a rock, come not
nearer that then in seven fathom.

The Bay of Cales is wide and broad, men lie there in 5 and 6 fathom, the
northwest wind comes there open in. If any man therefore would go further in
behind Puntall, let him go in southeast betwixt the point of Port Real and
Puntall, and run up about the point of Puntall, there men lie land-lockt for
all winds: there me^ may lay their ships dry a ground for to make clean. He
that will go into the Creek, must take a Pilot, and run up into the water of
Port Real leaving the little Island on the larboard side, and then Herod's
Creeck shall open it self, and there he must sail up keeping the middle of
the channel, till he come before the Saltheaps.

For to sail from Cales to the Strait, To sail from Cales to the Strait.
men must go away south, and south and by east to the C. de Trafalgar and then
they shall run far enough without the bancke or rocks which lie off s. east
from Cales. From the point of S. Sebastian to Cape de Trefalgar, which is the
north point of the Strait on the west side it is s. s. east, ten leagues. About
two leagues to the northwards of the Cape, lies Conil, there is a fair
sand-bay, where men may anchor in 12, 13, and 14 fathom clean ground.

He that desires to sail into the Strait of Gibralter coming from Cales,
let him go from the point of S. Sebastian, which is the westermost point of
the Island Cales, south and by east, southsoutheast, toward the Cape de
Trafalgar, until he be a good ways without the land for to avoid the Spanish
coast which is foul: there lies of west and by south from the Island Tariffe,
Riffe off Tariffe.
a banck of stones 2 leagues, or two leagues and a half into sea, whereupon is
eight, nine, or ten foot water, when it blows hard, men may see it break.
The foresaid point of S. Sebastians, and the Cape de Trafalgar lie ten leag.
asunder.

When you are then somewhat without the Cape de Trafalgar, and set your course
s.s.e. and s.e. and by south then you shall fall with the land off the Barbary
coast, within the Cape de Spartell, about thwart off Tanger, Tanger.
lying in a great bight and sand-bay. Upon the west point of this bay of
Tanger, stands a Castle somewhat high, and yet somewhat higher upon the high
land, stands a little watchtower: but to the eastwards of Tanger stands
alsoo an old ruinous watchtower, whereby Tanger is very easy to be known.
From Tanger to Ape-hill, the coast lies most e.n.e, and e. and by north, is
the right course for to sail through the Strait. If you will sail into the
Strait by night, then keep to the Barbary coast, which is very clean, and
there you can take no hurt: but the Spanish coast is foul, as is befote said.
They that will sail along by the Spanish coast, they must go close along
by the shore, and run through betwixt the Island Tariffe and the foresaid
foul grounds, close along by the Island, or else must keep far off from
the Island, for to run along without the shoals; but in the midst, near
a like unto both lands it is best.

Three leagues to the eastwards of the Island Tariffe lies the point of
Cabrita, Cape de Cabrita.
being the west point of the great Bay of Gibraltar over against the hill of
Gibralter: a little to the w. wards of it, is a good road for a n. e. wind, in
12, 10 and 8 fathom, not far from the shore, thwart off a great rock, which
lies close upon the water side, a little to the eastwards of the fire-tower: A
little to the westwards of that fire tower which stands upon the foresaid
point, is a fair sandstrand, betwixt the two towers there you shall lie smooth
for the western grown sea.

At Gibraltar is a fair Bay almost like a haven: if you will anchor in the bay
of Gibraltar, then sail so far into it, until that innermost point of the
hill of Gibralter, do stand east from you, thereabouts it is deep 5 or 6
fathom, and clean ground: toward the mill it is shoal water of 3 fathom. Men
lie there in the Bay landlockt for a w. wind, a s. wind comes from the point
of Gibraltar hill, but a southwest wind that blows there open in. From thence
are brought good wines.

Bay off Gibraltar.
When you will set sail from the road of Gibraltar with an easterly wind, it is
good to bear up somewhat before the wind toward the west shore, and then
forth out along by the lee shore, for the easterly winds do fall with such
whirling and fore-slaughes from over the high land of Gibraltar, that you shall
be hardly able to get out of the Bay along by the high land. When you come
from the eastwards, and will sail out through the Straits, and that you are
somewhat near to the Spanish coast, then you must be very careful, for that
you bring the hill of Gibraltar, against the high land of Barbary, and in
regard the land to the northwards of Gibraltarhil is low, it seems (to look
to) to be nothing else, then as if there were the opening of the Straites. It
has heretofore happened, that some which have so mistaken it, have sailed into
the bay, thinking it to be the opening of the Strait, and so have lost their
ships there. Therefore it is very needful, that men take great care not to
mistake them selves of the hill of Gibraltar, and if men do take heed of it, it
is easy to be known.

Estepona lies 5 leagues to the eastwards or to the northwards of Gibraltar,
betwixt them both stand diverse firetowrs upon the coast, there is clean ground
for to anchor. If you will anchor to the eastwardes of Gibraltar, by the next
tower of Gibraltar, then bring Gibraltar southsouthwest from you, and anchor in
25 fathom, there is clean ground, and blacksand but if you will anchor by the
second firetower, there is a valley, and there you may fetch water, and anchor
in 20 or 22 fathom, there is a valley, and there is also clean ground, and
better lying for to set sail with easterly winds, for those that are bound out
of the Strait. Before Estepona, men may anchor in 14 fathom, that is a place
for to lade fruit and wines; 5 or 6 leagues to the eastwards of it lies
Marveles, betwixt them both stand 5 watch towers upon the coast.

From Gibraltar to Marveles, Marveles.
the course is n.e. and by north distant 12 leagues, if you will anchor at
Marveles, then you must look out for two Pack-houses which stand upon the
strand and a great square watchtower close to the eastwardes off the foresaid
Pack-houses: bring the gate of the town so, that you may see through betwixt
the Pack-houses and the watchtower, and anchor there in nine or ten fathom.
Right before Marveles, the ground is not clean. About a shot of a Cast piece
to the westwards of the town, men may fetch fresh water.

From Marveles to Fangerola Fangerola
it is 5 leagues eastnortheast betwixt them both stand also 5 watch-towers.
Fangerola is a castle; and has a fair sand-bay, there is good anchor ground
in 7, or 8 fathom, a flat rising ground, men may lie there landlockt for a
westsouthwest wind.

From Fangerola to C. de Mol, C. de Mo^
the west point of Mallaga, the course is forth eastnortheast two great
leagues: but from the west point of Mallaga to the town of Mallaga, the course
is northeast and northeast and by east 4 leagues, it is there betwixt them both
a fair strand, where men may anchor all along in 10 or 12 fathom.

Mallaga Mallaga.
is known by these marks: There stands a Castle to the eastwards upon the
high land, and there come two walls downwards toward the sea to another
Castle which lies by the waterside. Before that same Castle is now the road,
that which was wont to be the right road, is now altogether spoiled by casting
of ballast.

If you will anchor in the road before Mallaga, then anchor in 10, 11, 12, or
14 fathom, thwart off from the head, if that the head come to lie from you
north and by east, there is very good ground, the anchors hold there well, also
men lie there out of danger for the Moors.

Velez Mallaga lies from Mallaga east and by north distant 7 leag. betwixt
them both men may anchor all along by the shore. About a league to the
westwards of Velez Mallaga stands a little Castle; before it is good
anchoring in 10 or 12 fathom. By the next Tower, to wit, the next to the little
castle, there is fresh water to be gotten on the land.

The town off Velez Mallaga Velez Malaga.
lies about a leag. within the land; but upon the strand stands a great
Packhouse appearing like a castle.

If you will anchor at Velez Mallaga coming from the westwards, then you must
give the west point a birth; there lies off a bancke a good ways into sea by
the watchtower which stands below, to the westwards of Velez Mallaga: but if
you run along by the shore in ten, or eleven, fathom, without The Coast of
Spain from Malaga to Modril.
coming nearer the shore, then you can not take any hurt in the foresaid
bank or riffe. When as the town of Velez Mallaga comes a little to the
eastwards of the foresaid Packhouse or tower which stands upon the strand,
then Anchor in 12, ten, or eight fathom, it is there all clear and clean
ground.

From Velez Mallaga to Almunecar, the course is east, 15 or 16 leagues, betwixt
them both it is all clean Coast, men may anchor there under all the points
which lie betwixt them both.

Two great leagues to the westwards of Almunecar lies a point, whereupon
stands a fire-tower, under is a good road for a west wind.

If you will anchor at Almunecar, then anchor to the westwards of the rock,
where the little chapel stands upon in twelve fathom, there is good ground,
and shall lie there landlockt for an east and westnorthwest wind.

Salobrena lies from Almunecar four leagues to the eastwards, that is a
little Town with a little Castle, and lies upon a hill a little about the
east point of Almunecar and right before Salobrena lies a little Island, he
that will anchor there must anchor to the westwards of it, there he shall lie
landlockt for a northeast wind, and also for a west wind, then he shall have
succor of the e. point of Almunecar. Men may also well anchor to the eastwards
of that little Island, but too the westwards of it is the best road, there lie
also all the ships, they may anchor there in fourteen and fifteen fathom,
clean soft ground, in sixteen fathom they shall lie somewhat too far out.
Men may (if need so require) run through betwixt the foresaid little Island,
and the maine land betwixt them both there is about sixteen or senventeen foot
water, and the little Island is round about clean, so that men may run very
close along by it without fear.

Two great leagues eastwards from Salobrena in the same bight, a half league
from the sea side within the land lies Modrill, which has two Churches and
some trees, thereabouts upon the water side stands a square tower.

If you will anchor at Modrill, then anchor before the foresaid square tower,
which stands upon the water side in twelve or thirteen fathom, so that you
may see the little Tower upon the east point even without the other point,
there is clean ground, men lie there landlockt for an eastwind, but a south
east and a southwind make there (like as at all places on these coasts) a lee
shore. A little to the eastwards of Modrill lies the point, called Cape de
Sacrastijf.

The Coasts of Barbary.
For to sail out of the Bay of Gibralter to Tetuan, then run over south and by
east, about close by the point of Seuta, especially with a westerly wind, you
should otherwise be carried away so with the current, which then commonly runs
to the eastwards, that you should fall too far to the Leewards. Coming then
about by the point of Seuta, you shall see out a head a black point called cape
Porkes lying south from the point of Seuta. When men lie in the Bay of
Gibraltar, they may see the foresaid cape Porkes C. Porques.
along over Seuta: which is a point very easy to be known, sail toward that
point, and with a westwinde luffe up so near as you can. When you come about
that point, then you shall begin to see Tetuan, which lies up against the high
land, a great league within the land: run then so far to the s. wards, until
that the east end of the town come right over a little round hommock, which is
upon the high land within. In the midst off the town stands a black tower,
and in the innermost land of al within, lie three little hills, which do (as
it were) look over the outermost inner land, bring the three little hills over
the foresaid black tower, and anchor then so far from the shore that the
first little hill of the high land to the southwards of Seuta toward cape
Porques, come a little without Cape Porques, there it shall be sixteen fathom
deep, and good soft ground. Marks of the Road before Tetuan.
If you anchor otherwise then upon these foresaid marks you shall have bad,
stony and sharp ground. It has happened that some ships have anchored there,
but their anchors fell so into the rocks, that they could not weigh them again,
but must hew of their cables, and leave their anchors behind them. Therefore
if you come off from the point of Cape Porques, then be care full that you
bring the foresaid first little hommock (which lies a stearn of you in the
bight of Seuta to the southwards of Seuta) a little without the Cape Porques,
and so keep sailing to the southward, and keep heaving of the lead continually
without ceasing until that you get the soft ground, so soon as you shall
feel it, let then presently your anchor fall, for the place where the soft
ground is, is not two cables length in compass great.

Tetuan lies from Seuta about six leagues, and three or four leagues to the
southwards of it lies a point, called Cape Tetuan, C. Tetuan
whereupon stands a tower. He that has never been at Tetuan, might easily be
mistaken by that point, taking it to be cape de Porques, the sooner because
that some say that Tetuan at least nine leagues to the southwards of Teutan. It
has happened that ships have sailed unto this point, and have so run past
Tetuan, therefore it is best that men go not too far from the shore either
by night or by day for to get the cape Porques certainly in sight.

The Bay off Tetuan betwixt the Cape Porques and Cape Tetuan, is a sand-bay
altogether of sand-strand with low hommocks here and there upon the seaside,
which a far of seem as if they were ships, but the ground thereabouts is
altogether foul, except such a place as before is said. Betwixt the Cape
Porques and Seuta it is also a fair sandstrand; but thwart of it is all good
ground.

The Coast of Barbary in the Strait of Gibralter, lies from Seuta to Cape de
Spartell west and by south, and westsouthwest eight or nine leagues. But the
Cape de Spartell, and Cape de Trafalgar on the Spanish side, lie north and by
west, and south and by east eight leagues asunder.

From Cape de Spartell to Arzila, Arzila.
the coast lies south and by west seven leagues, betwixt them both along the
seaside, it is all low land, with some points and high land within, with a
white sand-hilly strand. A little to the southwards of the point of Cape de
Spartell, men may anchor for easterly winds in twelve or thirteen fathom,
clean sand-ground, but so soon as the wind does shift to the west they must
be ready to get under sail, lest they be inbayed upon a lee shore.

About a league to the southwards of the Cape lies a little hommock upon the
low land, by the water side, which shows (in sailing by) like a broken
schonce or castle.

Arzyla is a little walled town, lying upon the water side, and has a little
bard haven, which men do sail into at two places through a row of Rocks,
which lies before it, the northermost channel is the deepest, but both of
them are not fit but for small ships. Being come within the rocks, men do
anchor betwixt the town and the rocks.

From Arzyla to Alarache, the coast lies also south and by west eight leagues,
it is altogether a clean coast with some rocks on the shore, the land betwixt
them both is somewhat higher them betwixt Arzyla and the Cape with high land
within. About an English mile to the southwardes of Arzyla stands a tower,
and somewhat further to the southwards, upon the high land, stand some little
houses, but men cannot well see them, except they sail close along by the
coast. Betwixt Arzyla and Alarache, but somewhat nearer Alarache then Arzyla,
lies on the sea side, a high white cliffe which is very easy to be known,
betwixt that cliffe and Alarache stands upon the high land a very high tree,
with some other trees by it, when men come from the northwards along by the
shore, that great tree seems to be a tower, yet somewhat to the southwards
stands an other great tree, but not so great as the other: when men begin to
come near to Alarache, or else by the southermost great tree, then the foresaid
greatest tree does hide it self behind the land. These are all very good
marks for to know this coast by, betwixt these two places.

Alarache lies with a great Castle upon the south point of a river, which is
very shoale and crooked, the north point is a low point going flat off, and
within it, on the n. side of the river stands also some buildings. Before the
river lies a bar of quicksand, which lies off from the north point, where
ships may go in over with a spring tide, through a Creek, else it is but for
Barks and Friggats: men may anchor before it in the Road in 16, 17, and 18
fathom.

Alarache Alarache.
is under the command of the King of Spain, and is little or nothing used
either by English or Dutchmen.

He that saileth along this coast, must not come very close to the shore,
unless it were with a hard Levand, or easterly wind, with calm weather there
goes sometimes a very great grown sea out of the west or northwest, so that
sometimes men can hardly get off from the shore.

From Alarache to Old Mamora the caost lies south and by west and
southsouthwest betwixt seven or eight leagues, it is low land with sand-hills
with few places that are easy to be known, all along even to Mamora.

He that comes out of the sea, and falls with the land, here on this coast,
shall perceive little knowledge of the land, unless he fall with some of the
inha^^ed places. This Old Mamora was wont also to be a haven, but is now
altogether cast to of the sea.

Of the tides and courses of the streams.
Before the Condaet on the coast a southsouthwest and northnortheast moon
makes high water.

Before Palos Moguer and Wolves makes full sea a s. and north moon.

Before the river of S. Lucas, and at Cales before the bay makes full sea a
southwest and by south and northeast and by north moon.

At Cales in the Bay makes high water a southsouthwest moon.

The ebb falls without the Puercos to the southwardes toward the Straet,
and the flood toward the land to the northwards: but for the most part, the
flood falls thwart in to the land, about the havens.

In the narrow of the Strait makes high water a southwest and by south moon.
The current runs more to the westwardes then to the eastwards; when it is
fair weather there goes commonly 4 hours flood to the eastwards, and eight
hours ebb to the westwards, but the most part of the time according as the
wind is, and at sometimes the current runs so strong, that it rippleth as
if there where shoals.

The second part of the New LIGHTNING COLUMN, OR SEA MIRROR. THE FOURTH
BOOK, Of the WESTERN NAVIGATION Containing The description of the Seacoasts
of Barbary, Gualata, Arguyn, Genehoe, and the Flemish and Canary Islands
together, from the Straight of Gibraltar, to Capo Verde.
The first Demonstration. In Which Are showed the Coasts of Barbary from old
Mamora to C. de Geer, together with the Flemish Islands.
FRom Old Mamora to Mamora, Mamora.
the coast lies along south and by west and southsouthwest 7 leag. Before
Mamora is a high broad sandstrand, and is not easy to know, when you are
somewhat off the land The best knowledge thereof is this: When you come from
the northwards along the shore, you have all high land within, that you come
leese when you come before Mamora, and when you come from the northwards, you
cannot see the river of Mamora open before you be past it, by reason that it
lies into the eastwards, and the n. point is low. When you come somewhat close
by the shore, you shall see upon the high land in the Castle of Mamora (which
the Spaniards have built there for the defense of the place) a very high mast
or stake, which you may see indifferent far off, and when it is clear weather
you may see also the high thick Tower of Salley to the southwards stand against
the land. Before the river lies a Bar which with a Spring has 16 and 17
foot, and sometimes more water, the Bar is oftentimes altered by the sea. In
the spring it lies in commonly e.s.e. and there abouts. In the later part of
the year it lies in more easterly by the casting up of the sea out of the n.
In the Summer the winds blow along the coast, the most part of the time out
of the north, which causes that the current runs there to the southwards,
and in the winter they blow much and strong out of the southwest and
southsouthwest In the winter men must be very careful to get of betimes when
the wind begins to come to the south, or s.e. then it is time to get of,
for then commonly it shifteth to the s. w. and w. s. w. with foul weather, but
when it comes about again to the westnorthwest or northwest, then it is like
to be good weather again.

The road before Mamora Road before Mamora.
is about a league from the land in 18 and 20 fathom, there is clean
sandy-ground.

From Mamora to Salley the coast lies s.w. and by s. and s.s.w. six leagues,
bewixt them both it is low plain land, and sandy-strand, with double land
within, which is so even and smooth, as if it were planed over. From Mamora not
half ways to Sally, the strand cease, and from thence forth to the
southwards it is a shore all of black steep ragged rocks with little hills,
so that men cannot judge (when they are somewhat off the land) that it is
double land within, by the plains of it. When you are a league or two past
Mamora, then you may see very plain the high thick Tower of Sally, and when
you see the foresaid rocky shore you may be sure that you are past Mamora,
that steep ro^^y shore continues from thence, until past Fedalle, (...)
^etwixt Fedalle and Sally is here and there a place of white strand, betwixt
the rocks, but to the northwards of Salley it is not so, but nothing else then
perfect rocks.

The Town of Salley Salley.
has a little Tower, and lies upon the n. side off the river, which is a low
plain point of sand. The Castle has also a little Tower, and lies over
against upon the s. point of the River, which is a high rocky point. There
goes a wall round about the high thick Tower, and lies upon a point on the s.
side within the River. Before the River is a Bar which oftentimes with storms
out of the sea does alter and shift, and is cast too, sometimes the channel
runs by one of the two points, and sometimes again right in the midst of
the rivers mouth. He that will anchor before Salley, let him bring the
foresaid high thick Tower (which stands within on the River) on the point of
the castle, to wit, over the south point of the River, which shall then stand
from him near about south e. and anchor there in thirty, eight and twenty, 24,
20, 18, or 16 fathom, so near or far off as he will there is clean black
sandy-ground, nevertheless that the shore thereabouts is so full of rocks and
stones. Being come to anchor there men must shoot a shot to cause the Moors to
come off. From Salley to the Island Fedalle the shore lies along s.w. and
by s. about 9 or 10 leagues. betwixt them both lie here and there in the
sand-strand, long black rocks (as before is said) so that oftentimes men might
take it to be Fedalle. Fedalle.
The best marks for to know Fedalle by is a wood of trees about a league to
the northwards off Fedalle, which stands below upon the land, and shows
like a barn. When you come sailing along close by the land, you shall see it
above upon the land, but when you are somewhat off from the land, then you
shall see the land within above the wood of trees, (or Barn as men do
commonly name it for the likeness of it) also there lies a little round
hommock about 4 leag. to the northwardes of Fedalle, which you shall see above
the rest of the land, when you are somewhat off from the land, but when you
come close by the land, it hides it self also behind the double land. The
coast betwixt Salley and Fedalle, is very plain and smooth double land, so that
there is not another such hommock more betwixt them both, as that foresaid
hommock, and in regard the coast thereabouts is altogether so plain, without
any places easy to be known, therefore men must take the more special heed
unto such small marks, for not to sail past the place where they are bound
unto.

Betwixt the foresaid Barn or wood of trees and Fedalle stands also a
ruinous little Town fallen down, in a rough wood, called Monsor, Monsor.
when you sail along close by it, you shall see yet some pieces of walls of
it.

Road under Fedalle.
To the s. wards of Fedalle the land is again higher, and where the high and
low comes together, it does make a clift, thereby the Island of Fedalle is
easy to be known, when that clift is s. s. e. from you, then is Fedalle thwart
of it also s. s. e. from you. If you will go into Fedalle, then run right
with the foresaid Barn, or wood of trees, until you come within a league, or
somewhat near to the land, and then along by it, and so you shall not miss
the Island Fedalle, but run in betwixt it and the maine land, when as you
come by the north point of Fedalle, then anchor betwixt the strand and the
foresaid n. point, but much nearer the Island Fedalle then the strand in 6, 7
or 8 fathom, so that you come to lie with your ship so far in, that the
foresaid point of the Island do lie n. n. w. from you, then lies the foresaid
Barn e. n. e. from you, and Monsor a handspikes length to the n. wards of the
Barn or wood of trees; you may also anchor in 12 fathom, so that the point of
Fedalle lie w. and by s. from you.

This bight within the Island Fedalle, is a very bad place to lie in, for
although you lie there so, that the point of the Island lie (...). and n. and
by w. from you, and with a Cable on t^^ Island, nevertheless the grown sea
comes so hard rolling in about the point of the Island (when the wind is
westerly) that you might rather desire to lie in the open sea, then within the
Island. From the n. point of Fedalle shoots off a ledge or riffe of rocks a
Musket shot into sea, the most o^ them lie high above water; within the Island
it is very flat toward the strand, the Bay on the land is a fair sandy
strand, there men may get ballast from the shore, but they must be very
careful to stand upon their guard, for there are dangerous people.

Depths and grounds about Fedalle.
Before Fedalle, to wit, to the northwards off it, thwart of the wood of trees,
and along to Salley, it is all showld water a league or two from the land,
all along that distance it is not deeper then 23, 24, and 25 fathom clean
sand-ground, thwart of into sea from Fedalle it is also of the same depth, but
foul ground.

He that will trade at Fedalle must anchor somewhat far in, for they have
there no Boats, men must fetch the Moors aboard with the Boat.

Upon the n. point of Fedalle lies a high hommock, which shows a far off
when men come in, as if it were a castle fallen down, but it is nothing else
then rocks. At the s. end of Fedalle men may go over on foot at low water to
the maine land, but at high water the sea washes through at 2 places, it
flows there 7 or 8 fo. up and down,

Three leagues s. w. and by s. and s.w. from Fedalle lies an old ruinous town
fallen down close upon the strand called Anafee, ^^fee.
it is a long town with many towers. amongst the rest one high thick tower
almost like the tower of Salley, but men must be indifferent close by it
before you can see it. When you are thwart of Anafee, you may yet see the wood
of trees to the northwards of Fedalle, which stands then to see to from far
as a sail in the water, 2 leag. to the southwards, (or rather to the
westwards) of Anfee, or Anafee, is a steep point with red cliffs, which seem a
far off as if they where houses such spotters me^ shall find at diverse places
on the coast.

From Anafee to Azamor Azamor.
the coast lies s.w. and by w. westerly 18 leagues betwixt them both lies
another fallen place called Lyones. Azamor has a point lying out on the east
side, when you come sailing along the shore from the northwards, Azamor
lies then about or behind that point upon the strand, but stands high. A
little past Azamor lies a river, and thereabouts are some towers in the
lowland.

Three little leagues to the westwards of Azamor lies the town of Masagam,
Masagam.
on a white strand close by the sea side this town is inhabited by the
Portugals, or Spanjards, it has no towers, and shows to see to off at sea,
in white spots against the land. When you are thwart off from it, you shall see
to the s. wards the high tower of Tyro Tyro.
(which is a town fallen down about 2 leag. to the w. wards of Masagam) almost
like the tower of Anafee. A little to the w. wards of Masagam, at the w. point
of the Bay, shoots off a ledge or riffe of rocks, almost a league off into
sea, whereof the rocks at high water, lie most under water, and at low water
are uncovered. He that will anchor there and is not well acquainted, must take
in a Pilot, which may bring him to a place where is good anchor ground, for
although that it be a great Bay, yet nevertheless there are few places where
the ground is clean; but is at many places foul, so that but few ships should
be able to lie there in clean ground, when you lie in the right road, then
lies the e. point of the Bay e. and the w. point about n.w. from you.

About a leag. to the w. wards of Tiro lies a steep point when you come from
the e. wards along by the shore, you shall see no more land without the
point, until that you come near it, when you begin to get it upon your broad
side, then there comes out to the westwards a great square cliff, which is
very easy to be known, and is whitish with reddish spots, and seems a far off
as if it were a wall. This point is called after that white point, C. Blanco.
C. Blanco.
About 3 leag. to the w. wards of this C. Blanco, stands a little tower upon
the highland, near by a valley called Casa Cavalgera, Casa Cavalgera.
and 2 leag. more to the w. wards lies upon the high land another little house
called Emindra, Emindra.
but you must be close by the land before that you can see it. From the
foresaid C. Blanco to the C. Cantin, the coast lies west s.w. and s.w. and by
w. about 9 leag.

The C. Cantin C. Cantin.
is an even plain point, when you are to the n. wards of it, it shows flat
toward the w. and going off toward the sea: there stands a fire-tower upon
it, but very small, that sometimes you can hardly see it. If you come from the
northwards, or from C. Vincent, and are bound to Saffia, then set your course
south and s. and by east, and then you shall fall with the land 4 or 5 leag. to
the e. wards of C. Cantin, or if you sail a more westerly course you shall
run till you come in the height of 32 degr, and a half, and then the C.
Cantin shall lie due e. from you, it is better to fall a little to the
eastwards of the C. then to the w. wards of it, because the winds blow there
most common northerly. If you fall to the eastwards of the C. the coast lies
there s.w. and by w. and w. s. w. and it is even plain land. About 10 leag. to
the e. wards of the C. lies that little town Tyro, with a high white tower
upon the sea side, and 5 or 6 leag. more to the westwards (betwixt Casa
Cavalgero and C. Cantin) you shall see a little bight or Bay, thereabouts lie
upon the strand by the water side, great black rocks, which show as if they
were wrakes of ships, and then forth along to the C. it is a fair flat sandy
strand. From the C. shoots off a ledge of rocks somewhat off into sea, which
men must avoid when they sail about the Cape.

From C. Cantin to the north point of Saffia, the coast lies s. or somewhat
more westerly, 5 or 6 leag. betwixt them both it is a steep rocky land without
sandy strand, but above upon it plain and even. A league to the southwards of
the C. lies a riffe or shoale by the shore, by some called the Gold-banke and
lies about a league off from the land: at sometimes of the year there is much
fish to be taken.

To the southwards of the Bay of Saffia Saffia.
is high uneven, and most of all double land, but to the southwards of it, it
is even and plain, thereby men may easily perceive or discern whether they be
to the northwards of Saffia, or to the southwards of it.

If you will anchor in the bay For to anchor in the Bay.
or road before Saffia, Saffia.
then bring the north point (whereupon stands a tower) a little more westerly
then n. from you, and anchor then in 18 fathom. Or if you will anchor further
in the Bay, then bring the foresaid north point n.n.w. or a little more
northerly from you, and then the northermost of the two north points shall be
a ships length without the southermost or the next unto you run then so far
to the southwards until that the tower were men do land with the boats (which
is a high square tower standing below even within the wall of the town) come
right over a tower which is fast to the wall, which comes off from the Castle
above to the southwards, so that the foresaid thick tower below come right
over the Haven, betwixt the point where the castle stands upon the water
side, and the rocks where men go in betwixt. Or else anchor that the high
Castle of Saffia stand e. and by s. and e.s.e. from you, there it is 16, 17 and
18 fathom deep, good fine sandy ground. You may also anchor so far within in
the Bay in 15 and 16 fathom, that the north point come to be n. w. and n. w.
and by n. from you. These are the Summer road, in the Winter you men must
anchor further from the land in 28 or 30 fathom, there the ground is course
sand. Men may boldly run in before Saffia into the road by night, there is
nothing that they need to fear, which may do them hurt, but the land.

About two leagues from Saffia, lies the south point of the bay, which is a
low point that lies out, and two leagues to the southwards of it lies another
steep rocky point without sandy strand. By it goes in the River Tansit up into
the land unto Marrocos.

From the point of Saffia to the Island Mogodor, the coast lies southsouthwest
19 or 20 leagues.

Against the northeast end of the Island Mogodor, Island Mogodor
there shoots off from the maine land, a great row off rocks; being hard
sharp rocks, whereof the outtermost or those that lie next to the Island
Mogodor, lie high above water: He that comes from the northwards, and will
sail in behind the Island Mogodor, must run in betwixt the Island and the
foresaid rocks, close in along by the Rocks. It is there in coming in,
betwixt the Island and the Rocks five fathom deep. Within the foresaid Rocks
lie also some other Rocks on the larboard side, which at high water are under
water, and at low water are uncovered. When you come to the end of them, you
may luffe up about by them toward the maine land, and anchor there within them
in 3 fathom at low water, there is good sand-ground. But yet nevertheless it
is not there very good lying, for by reason of the breaking of the Sea upon the
foresaid rocks, there goes sometimes a great Sea, so that it is not good lying
there with a storm, but further in, under the Island it is good lying in two
fathom and a half. From the south-end of the Island lies off a little riffe
toward the maine land almost to the foot strand, and to the s. wards off that
foresaid little riffe, lies a bancke off from the maine land almost a league
off into sea. If you will sail out at the south end, then run along by the
shore of the maine land, until that you be about the foresaid riffe, and run
out then upon your lead along by the banck, and then you shall presently get
deeper water, of 4, 6, 8, and 10 fat. then you may sail there, where you
desire to be:

From the point of Saffia to C. de Geer, C. de Geer
the course is southsouthwest about 43 leagues but from Mogodor the same course
is about 22 or 23 leag. It is there betwixt them both a fair flat sand-strand,
with double land, which at some places is very high.

About 8 leagues to the northwards of C. de Geer lies a point called C. de
Taffalana, C. de Taffalana.
under which men may ride in good sand-ground for east and northeast winds.
The C. de Geer is lower then the land to the northwards of it, and falls to
the southwards flat off into sea, which men shall first perceive when they come
within 3 or 4 leagues of it. About 4 leagues to the northwards of the Cape
lies a high Hommocke within the land, and further northwards the land is yet
higher; but when you come thus from the northwards near C. de Geer, Riffe ^^^^e
you shall see no more land to the southwards of it. When you come to the point
you must give the riffe a birth that lies off from it, and run about by it,
and then forth southeast and by east, and southeast 7 or 8 leagues to S. Cruz,
Roa^ fore S. Cruz.
and then you shall see the Moors Castle stand on the high land: thwart of it
lie a row of Rocks, about a Calliver shot in length, else it is all a clean
and clear coast. For to anchor there in the Bay, run so far into the Bay,
that the foresaid Moors Castle stand north from you, and the Christians
packhouses northeast, there it shall be deep (to the southwards or the
foresaid row of Rocks) 7 and 8 fathom, the north point or C. de Geer, shall
then be from you northwest and by west, there is the best road. In the Summer
time you may anchor nearer to the shore, until you come in six and seven
fathom. When you sail from C. de Geer toward the play or the Road, you must
be careful to keep close aboard of the land of the Cape, and run along by
it, nutill you come before the Castle. If you run far off from the shore,
you shall with northerly winds (which blow there much) be constrained to come
in n. e. and n.n. e. again for to recover the shore, therefore it is best to
keep close aboard the high land. He that should come into the road here by
night, must not (upon a certain great forfeiture) come nearer the shore then
in 12 or 14 fathom.

In this Road men must be very careful and ready with their anchors, the
smallest bower must be always laid out for the wind which blows off the
land, and the other anchors to Seawards. The shoot anchor must be always
ready against a storm (which men may very well perceive before by the swelling
or rising of the sea) to bring it out in the southwest. Also it is needful to
keep the foresayle to the yard, for to help themselves with it the best that
they can if it should happen that they should be forced from their anchors.

In this Bay is much fish to be taken, when men lie there in the road, they
take their turns to go out to fish.

From the C. S. Vincent south-west and by west 140, leagues, and from the Cape
de Finisterre southsouthwest and southwest and by south 232 leagues, lies the
Island Porto Santo lying southeast and northwest upon each end of this Island
lies a great rock. The road is on the s. w. side, to the eastwardes of the
ragged rock, before a little haven where men may lie landlockt with boats.

The Island Madera lies from Porto Santo Porto Santo.
s.w. 16 leag. s. wards from the east point of Madera, Madera.
lie 3 small rocky Islands, being called the Serters, Serters.
the northermost is the smallest, and lies about a league from the land from
the foresaid point, the southermost is the greatest, and lies 4 leag. from the
land. He that comes from the n. wards, or from Porto Santo, may sail through
betwixt them and the point of Madera, it is there betwixt them broad and wide,
and also clean and clear every where, only at the foresaid e. point of
Madera lies a suncken rock, whereof men must take heed.

At the s. side of the Island before the town S. Cruz C. Cruz.
is a good road in 20 fathom, but before Fonsiall is the chiefest Road for to
lade: to the westwards of the Town lies a great rock with a cross, called
the Lion, by it is the best lying in 30 or 40 fathom.

At the southwest west side before Marasilo is also good anchoring in 16 or 18
fathom. In all these foresaid places is good ground for to anchor in.

Betwixt Madera and Teneriffe lies the little Island Salvages, Salvages.
to wit, south from the Serters forty leagues. North from the northeast point
off Teneriffe seven and twenty leagues, and northnorthwest from the northeast
point off Great Canaries, forty, or two and forty leag. it lies s. w. and
northeast and is about a half league long. The s. w. end of Salvages is foul
far off into sea, therefore run rather about to the eastwards of it then to
the westwards. Three or 4 leagues s. w. from that point, amongst other Rocks,
lies one great rock which shows a far of like a sail. Under the s. e. side
of the Salvages is a good road for a n.w. and west wind.

Madera and the Island S. Michaels Saint Michaels.
lie n. w. and s. e. 135 leagues distant. At S. Michaels, the road is at the s.
w. side of the Island, when you come about one of the two points, either from
the east or west, then you shall see two little towns. Before the westermost,
called Punte de Gada, Punto de Gada.
or Punt Alagato, is the Road in 20 and 25 fathom.

Before the eastermost little town lies a little Island, betwixt that and the
land of S. Michaels it is 5, 6 and 7 fathom deep. Betwixt these two little
towns, the coast lies w. n. w. and e. s. e.

From S. Michaels to Tercera, Tercera.
the course is n. w. and by w. four and thirty leagues. Under Tercera the road
is on the s. side of the Island, to the westwards of the rocks, right before
the town Angra, Angra.
betwixt two points that lie out, upon each of them stands a Castle for
defense off the ships which lie there in the Road, the westermost of the 2
points lies a good ways further out to seawards then the eastermost, and has
upon the end of it, two very high, called Brasil, when you come out of the sea,
either from the eastwards or the westwards, it seems a far off as if it
were asunder from the land. These two foresaid hills upon the point off Brasill,
are so high, that in clear weather man may see from thence 16 or 17 leagues
far off into sea. Upon it stand 2 pillars, which men may see every where in
the town Angra, and a watchman thereby for to keep watch, and to give them of
the town warning of the ships that come about the Island. As many ships as
he sees come from the westwards or the southwards, that is, from the
West Indies, Brasill, or the Portingals Indies so many Flags he sets up upon
the Pillar toward the west, when he sees more then five ships, then he
sets up a great Flagge, which signifies a whole Fleet. Likewise he does
the same upon the other Pillar toward the east, for the ships which he sees
come from the east, from Portingall or from the northwards, so that there
cannot a ship come thereabouts, but men may see it presently by that token in
every corner and street of the Town.

He that comes from the eastwards, or the northwards and is bound into the
Road of Tercera, For to sail into the road of Tercera.
let him run fair by the land off the east point, and along by it unto the 2
little Islands, called the Ilheos, which lie a little to the eastwards of the
road, about a bow shot one from the other. Men may run along to the
southwards off these Islands, or to the northwards of them, as they will, and
also betwixt them both. Betwixt these little Islands and the maine land of
Tercera, it is a great cannon shot broad, and 15 and 16 fathom deep, through
betwixt the little Island it is 5 and 6 fathom deep clean sand-ground.
Somewhat to seawards of these little Islands, lie 3 or 4 rocks above water,
called Los Frayles. L^^ Fray^es.
Being past these foresaid little Islands, you must sail to the westwards,
until that you come near to the foresaid point of Brasill, a little to the
eastwards of it you must anchor before the town of Angra in 10 or 12 fathom, or
else men lay their sea-anchor commonly in 16, and their smaller anchor toward
the land in 8 or 9 fathom. Men lie there landlockt for a s.w. and n.e. and also
for an e.n. e. wind, but a s.e. wind blows there flat open in. On the w.
side of the point of Brazill is also a great sandy Bay for to anchor in. Before
a village, called S. Martin.

Three leagues to the eastwards of the Town Angra, lies a bight, called Porto
Judeo, there the Spaniards landed with their forces, when they took in the
Island from the Portingals.

He that will sail from Tercera to Fayall, let him set his course w.s.w. to
the E. point of S. Georges, which is from thence ten leag. asunder. Further,
betwixt the Pico and S. Georges through to Fayall are 16 leagues, it lies most
w.n.w. through betwixt them and the Island Fayall lies to the westwards of the
Island of the Pico a great league asunder off from it.

He that will anchor in the Road of Fayall, let him anchor right before the
Village of Fayall in 14 or 15 fathom, there is sandground; but there goes a
hard tide of flood and ebb.

On the s.w. end of the Island Fayall lies a little haven for to sail in
there, you must run in by the s.w. point, so long about by the shore, until
that you see the haven open sail along about by the s.w. point until that
you come in the narrow, bet^^xt the rocks which lie of from the w. side, so
soon as you come within the rocks let presently your anchor fall in 5 fathom,
and bring your hawsers on the e. side on land fast to the pales, which are
there made for the purpose: the haven is little so that men may lie in it with
no more then with 4 or 5 ships. Further in it is shoale water.

De tyhavens Porto de Naos en Porto de Cavallos aen de Zuydoostzyde van Lacerota



The second Demonstration, In Which Are to be seen the Canary Islands.
THe chiefest Islands of the Canaries are 7 in number, Lancerota, Forteventura,
or Porteventura, great Canaries, Teneriffe, Gomera, Palma, and Ferro. The
Island Lancerota lies from Cape S. Vincent southsouthwest distant about 165
leagues. It has one haven upon the northeast end, betwixt the two Islands
Alagranca and Gratiosa, where men may come in from the northwards and lie
landlockt for all winds, it is deep there 10, 15, and 20 fathom, and they may
sail out again to the southwards along by Lancerota. At the east side of
Lancerota is a good road before the Town of Lancerota, there lies a banck to
the northwards of it, which men must avoid, and run about to the southwards of
it, there they may anchor in 10, 11, and 12 fathom: on the same southeast side
lie also two bad havens a great shot of a cast piece one from the other, the
northermost is called Porto de Naos, and the southermost Porto de Cavallos,
which we have demonstrated in a large volume in the northwest corner of this
card, and showed the depths with number of feet at high water and springtide.

Porto de Naos, the deepest of these bad-havens, goes in northwest and by
north betwixt two ledges of rocks, there stand two beacons of heaps of
stones, in manner as the warders of Norway, which you must bring and keep one
in the other, and sail so right in through betwixt the two foresaid ledges of
rocks. The shoalest of the Bar betwixt the two ledges of rocks, is but a
short space, a great ships length long and is deep at high watet 17 foot,
and at low water seven foot, so soon as you shall be over, it will presently
be 20, 24, 26, and 28 foot deep, then you must edge up n. and then presently
northeast and anchor behind the rocks which lie to the northwards of the
Bar, in the Channel the ground is rocky, hard, and uneven. If a ship should
come to strike there, it should presently be broken. The ledge is so without as
it is within, very steep, so that you may come very close unto it, where the
anchors stand marked, it is altogether clean sandy ground, 30 and 34 foot deep
at high water with a sea wind there can go here a great sea, but that
happens seldom, for the winds; do blow most out of the n. and n.e. and
therefore it is almost always there smooth water. This haven is very narrow
betwixt the rocks; which lie to seawards of you and the shore, it is but a
little more then a great cables length broad, and from the havens mouth to the
main land about a Cables length and a half. The Havens mouth also is not
broad, but at high water the rocks do flow a good ways on both sides under
water, which at low water again are uncovered.

Betwixt Porto de Naos and Porto de Cavallos lie two little Islands, the
northermost is the greatest, at high water men may go through with boats
within the Islands, into Porto de Cavallos, but not with ships for at low water
it falls dry there within. Upon the southermost little Island stands an old
Castle fallen down, which heretofore has been spoiled by Englishmen. From
the south side of that little Island shoots off a riffe, and to the
southwards or the w. wards of it lies in the Bar, which is very narrow, not
above ten fathom broad, upon the maine land stand also two little beakons, as
at Porto de Naos, which you must bring one in the other, and sail so right in.
At high water and springtide there is no more then twelve foot water, or an
half foot more, the ground in the havens mouth is also hard, and nothing else
then rocks, where you must go in over but within it is clean sandy ground
where you may lie a ground without any danger, with a ship that draws ten
or eleven foot water. At the highest water the most part of the rocks on both
sides of the Havens mouth, lie under water, so that at many places men may go
over them with boats. At low water there remains in this Havens mouth no more
then a foot, or a foot and a half depth, so that a ships boat cannot go in;
within men lie landlockt for all winds, and although it blow very hard, yet
the water is always smooth. In both these havens a south and by west and north
and by east moon makes high water. Near the Havens there are no houses where
Spaniards or Moors do dwell, then only by Porto de Cavallos a little Church,
where they have Mass said on Sundays, when ships lie there. Men go from
thence betwixt the Mountains to the town, which lies 3 leag. from thence. He
that will come here must provide himself with fresh water, for there is very
seldom fresh water to be gotten. Upon this land there grows neither fruit nor
wine. In some good years it gives out Wheat, Bally, and Orsilly, the
Inhabitants are Moore under the command of the King of Spain.

Betwixt Lancerota and Forteventure lies a little lIsand called Isle de Lobos,
which is on the outer side, to wit, on the n. west side, very foul. Men may
anchor on both sides of that Island in 15 or 20 fathom, also in six fathom a
shot of a cast piece southwest and by west from the west point off the Island,
there men may lie land-lockt for all winds, except for a northnorthwest and
southeast winds. The coast of Forteventura is at the northeast end very foul,
with many riffes that lie out, whereupon the sea does break exceedingly.

The Island of great Canaries lies from Forteventura west 19 or 20 leagues
distant. The road there lies, at the east side of the Island, behind the n.e.
point, thwart off a Castle that stands upon a Chindle. The foresaid northeast
point, is a very high point, with a long small and low sandstrand fast to the
other land, so that when it is five or six leagues northwest or southe^st from
you it seems to be an Island asunder off from the other land. If you desire
to go in there into the road, then sail about by that northeast point, along
by the Isolettes, leaving them on the starboard side of you until that the
Castle do lie near about northwest and by north from you, anchor there in
eight, nine, ten, or twelve fathom, then lies the north point northeast and by
north and the south point southsoutheast from you.

At the south end of the great Canaries is a fair sand-bay called Maspalomba,
there is a good road for southerly winds, and fresh water to be gotten.

The north point of the great Canaries, and the northeast point of Teneriffe
called Punte de Nago, lie westnorthwest, and eastsoutheast distant 21 leagues.
In Teneriffe is a road on the southeast side before the town S. Cruz, there is
a fair sand-bay, a little to the northwards of the town is the best road in
20, or 24 fathom, and then Punte de Nago, the northeast point of Teneriffe
lies northnortheast from you, and the south point south and by west. When the
Pico of Teneriffe is westsouthwest from you, then are you open before this road
of S. Cruz, and when you lie in the road of S. Cruz, you may see the Island of
great Canaries southeast from you about 13 leagues.

On the northwest side of Teneriffe lies the road of Garrichica, from the
northeast point Punte de Nago westsouthwest and southwest and by west eight or
nine leagues; He that will anchor before Garrichica, let him anchor to the
westwards of the rock with the cross called the Lion, so that the foresaid
rock do lie southeast and by east and southeast from him, then he shall lie
right before the town, and may see right into the street of the town, through
the Cloister of S. Dominicus, there is clean ground in 36 or 40 fathom, the
Pieck lies then over the w. side off the town, nearer to the land, or to the
rock then in 35 or 36 fathom it is not clean, and westwards toward the riffe
Lapania it is also foul ground. This is a dangerous road, therefore every one
that comes here, must be very careful to have their anchors, cables, and
sails very preedy and ready for to shift roads as soon as it begins to be a
storm.

There is also a little haven before Garrichica, where men may lie with a few
ships. For to sail in there, you must have a Pilot. On the west side of the
havens mouth lies a rock under water, but the sea breaks always upon it,
you may anchor within in the haven in five or six fathom, and must bring two
anchors out a head to seawards, with a cable on the rocks, and an anchor out a
stearn, on the land, so that the ships cannot wend too and again, the ground is
there foul, you must buy up your cables with buys and cask for to keep them
from the ground. This is a good haven in Summer, then it is commonly good
weather, but in the winter it is not good to com in there with a ship, for the
grown sea out of the n. west comes running in there sometimes so forcible and
strong, that it is not possible to hold a ship, although she had to anchors
out. It has happened certain years past that there was lost in the same haven a
great many ships; and a great many houses of the same town washed away with
the great water.

Betwixt Garrichica and the east end of Teneriffe, are three lading places more
for to lade wine at, as Maramela Relecho, and Oratama.

At the southwest end of Teneriffe lies also another little haven or Bay where
is much wines laden called Adessa, there is also good lying except it be with a
s.w. wind, which blows there open in.

From Teneriffe to the Island la Palma, the course is westnorthwest twenty
leagues. On the southeast side la Palma, lies a fair Bay, with a town and
lade-place called S. Cruz. He that comes from the northwards, and desires to
anchor in the road, let him run so far in the Bay until he be to the
southwards, or past the head, or the bridge, and anchor there in 25 or 30
fathom. In winter time men must not anchor so near the strand, because of the
southeast or southsoutheast winds, for then they should lie too near the
strand. Men lie there moored with two anchors for the sea wind, with a small
anchor out a stearn for to keep the ship right in the road there lies to the
eastwards of the town a high white rock with a cross, there is the best road.
A little to the northwards of the town, is a fair sand-bay, there is good
anchoring in 20, 30, or 35 fathom, according as men will lie far off, the Road
is called the Rammell road. When men lie in the road of Palma, they may see the
Pieck of Teneriffe lie eastsoutheast from them. The Island Palma is very high
and full of trees, whereby it is easy to be known.

On the southwest side of la Palma is another place, where men lade wines
called Tassa Corda.

About 5 leagues west from the west end of Teneriffe, lies the Island Gomera,
which has on the n. e. side a good haven of 10 fathom deep, where is good
lying almost for all winds, better then in any of the other Islands, but there
is nothing to lade: Men may alsoo anchor without before the haven in 20 fathom,
but they must shift roads there as at Garrichica.

The road of Adessa in Teneriffe lies right over against it, east off from it
about 5 leagues.

The road of Palma lies from this haven in Gomera northwest and by north 16
leagues.

The Island Ferro lies from the Island Palma south and by west, distant 13
leagues.
