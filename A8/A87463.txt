A Declaration of King James, made in Scotland, Anno Dom. 1585. Concerning
Church Government.
FOr so much as here are some evil affected men, that go about (so far as
lies in them) to invent lies and calumnies to stain and impair the Kings
Majesty's fame and honor, and raise brutes as if his Majesty had declined to
Papistry, and had made many Acts to derogate the free passage of the Gospel,
good order and discipline in the Church, which brutes are nourisht and
entertained by rebellious subjects, who would gladly cover their seditious
enterprises under pretext of religion, albeit there can be no religion in such
as raise armor and disquiet the estate of their native Sovereign, and
perjuriously have contraried the Oath bond and obligation of their faith,
whereunto they have sworn and subscribed. Therefore that His Majesty's
faithful Subjects be not abused with such slanderous reports, and His
highness good and affectionate friends in other Countries may understand the
verity of his upright intentions, His Majesty has commanded this brief
declaration of certain of His Majesty's Acts of Parliament held in May 1584. to
be published and imprinted, to the effect, that the indirect practices of such
as slander His Majesty and his laws, may be detected and discovered.

IN the first Act, His Majesty ratifieth and approves the true profession of
the Gospel, sincere preaching of the word, and administration of the
Sacraments, presently by the goodness of God established in this Realm; and
allows of the confession of the faith set down by Act of Parliament the first
year of His Majesty's reign: Like as His Highness not only professes the
same in all sincerity, but (praised be God) is come to that maturity of
judgment, by reading and hearing the Word of God, that His highness is able
to convince, and overthrow by the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, the
most learned of the contrary sect of the Adversaries: So as Plato affirms that
Commonwealth to be most happy wherein a Philosopher reigns, or he that
reigns is a Philosopher: we may much more esteem this Country of Scotland to
be fortunate, wherein our King is a Theologue, and his heart replenisht with
the knowledge of the heavenly philosophy, for the comfort not only of his good
subjects and friends in other countries, but of them that profess the Gospel
every where, he being a King of great expectation, to whom his birthright has
not only destinate and provided great Kingdoms, but much more His Majesty's
virtue, godliness and learning, and daily increase of all heavenly sciences,
do promise and assure him of the mighty protection of God, and favor of all
them that fear his holy name.

IN the second Act, his Maj. royal authority over all estates both spiritual
and temporal is confirmed, which act some of malice and others of ignorance,
do traduce, as if his Maj. pretended to be head of the Church, a name which His
Maj. acknowledges to be proper and peculiar to the Son of God the Savior of
the world, who is the head, and bestows life spiritual upon the members of
his mystical body, and he having received the holy spirit in all abundance
makes every one of the faithful partakers, according to the measure of faith
bestowed upon them, of the which number of the head Christ His Maj.
acknowledges himself to be a member, baptized in his name, partaker of the
mystery of the cross and holy communion, and attending with the faithful for
the coming of the Lord, and the final restitution of Gods elect. And
notwithstanding his Maj. surely understands by the scriptures, that he is the
principal member appointed by the law of God, to see God glorified, vice
punished, and virtue maintained within his realm, and the sovereign judgment for
a godly quietness and order in the commonwealth, to appertain to His
highness care and solicitude: which power of his highness certain ministers
(being called before His Maj. for seditious and factious sermons, and stirring
up the people to rebel against their native King) would in no wise acknowledge,
but disclaimed His authority as an incompetent Judge; and especially one Mr.
Andrew Melvile, an ambitious person, of a salt and fiery humor, usurping the
Pulpit of Sandrois, with out any lawful calling, and privy at that time to
certain conspiracies against His Maj. went about in his sermon upon a Sunday,
to inflame the hearts of the people, by odious comparisons of His Maj.
progenitors and council. Albeit the duty of a faithful preacher of the
Gospel, be rather to exhort the people to the obedience of their native King,
nor by popular sermons, which has been the decay of great commonwealths, and
has greatly in times past disquieted this Estate. The said Mr. Andrew called
before His highness answered, he would not be judged by the King and his
Council, because he spoke the same in a Pulpit, which Pulpit (in effect) he
alleged to be exempt from the judgment and correction of Princes, as if that
holy place sanctified to the word of God, might be a color to any sedition
against lawful authority without punishment: His Maj. (being a most gracious
Prince) was unwilling to use rigor against the said Mr. Andrew, if he had
humbly submitted himself, acknowledged his offense and craved pardon; but he
(afraid of his own guiltiness, being private to diverse conspiracies before,
fled into England; whose naughty and presumptuous refusing of his Highness
judgment, was the occasion of the making of the 2d. Act; That none should
decline his Highness Authority, in respect that the common proverb is, that Ex
malis moribus bonae leges natae sunt: that is, Of evil manners good Laws
proceed; And indeed intolerable arrogance in any Subject called before his
Prince, professing and authorizing the same truth to disclaim his authority;
neither do the Prophets, Apostles, or others, conducted by the Spirit of God
minister the like example: For it is a great error to affirm (as many do)
that Princes and Magistrates have only power to take order in civil affairs,
and that Ecclesiastical matters do only belong to the Ministry; by which
means the Pope of Rome has exempt Himself and His Clergy from all judgment of
Princes, and has made himself to be Judge of Judges, and to be judged of no
man: whereas by the contrary, not only by the examples of the Godly
Governors, Judges, and Kings, of the ancient Testament; but also by the new
Testament, and the who^e History of the Primitive Church,; in the which, the
Emperors judged over the Bishops of Rome, deposed them from their Seats,
appointed Judges to acknowledge and decide in Causes Ecclesiastical, vindicate
innocent men as Athanasius from the determination of the Council holden at
Tyrus, and by infinite good reasons, which shall be set down (by the grace of
God) in a several Work, shall be sufficiently proved: But this appears at
this present to be an unprofitable question, which has no ground upon their
part, but of the preposterous imitation of the pretended jurisdiction of the
Pope of Rome; For if there were any question in this Land of Heresy, whereby
the profound Mysteries of the Scriptures behoved to be searched out, His Maj.
would use the same remedy (as most expedient) which the most godly Emperors
have used, and his Maj. following their example, would convene the Council of
learned Pastors, that by conference of Scriptures the Truth might be opened,
and Heresy repressed. But (praised be God) we have no such controversies in
this Land, nor has Heresy taken any deeproot in the Country; but certain of
the Ministry joining themselves to Rebels have traveled to disquiet the estate
with such questions, that the People might enjoy a sinister opinion of his Maj.
upright proceedings; Neither is it his Maj. intention to take away the lawful
and ordinary judgment in the Church, whereby Discipline and good order might
decay, but rather to preserve, maintain, and increase the same. And as there is
in the Realm Justices, Constables, Sheriffs, Provosts, Bayliffes, and other
Judges in Temporal matters; so His Majesty allows that all things may be
done in order, and a Godly Harmony may be preserved in the whole Estate. The
Synodall Assemblies by the Bishops, or Commissioners (where the place is
vacant) to be convened twice in the year, to have the ordinary trial of
matters belonging to the Ministry and their estate, always reserved to His
highness, that if they or any of them do amiss, neglect their duty, disquiet
the estate, or offend in such manner and sort, that they in no wise pretend
that immunity, privilege and exemption, which only was invented by the Popes
of Rome, to tread under foot the Scepters of Princes, and to establish an
Ecclesiastical tyranny within this country, under pretext of new-invented
Presbyteries, which neither should answer to the King, nor Bishop under His
Majesty, but should have an infinire jurisdiction, as neither Law of God nor
man can tolerate; which is only His Majesty's intention to repress, and not
to take away any godly or solid order in the Church, as hereafter shall appear.

THe fourth Act of His Majesty's foresaid Parliament, discharges all judgments
Ecclesiastical, and all assemblies which are not allowed by His Majesty in
Parliament, which Act especially concerns the removing and discharging of
that form late invented in this land called the Presbytery, wherein any number
of Ministers of any certain precinct and bounds accompting themselves all to be
equal, without any difference; and gathering unto them certain Gentlemen and
others of His Majesty's subjects, usurped all the whole Ecclesiastical
jurisdiction, and altered the Laws at their own appetite, without the
knowledge and approbation of the King or the estate; a form of doing without
any example of any Nation subject to any Christian Prince. The peril whereof
did so increase, that in case in due season it had not been repressed and
forbidden by His Majesty's laws, the same had troubled the whole country, and
it being tried by His highness to be the overthrow of His Majesty's estate,
the decay of His crown, and a ready introduction to Anabaptisme, and popular
confusion in all estates, His Majesty has countermanded the same. And that the
Reader may understand the danger thereof by many inconveniences, which thereby
ensued in this Land; I will only set down one, whereby ye may understand what
peril was in the rest. The Ambassador of France being to return home to his
own country, the King commanded the Provost-Bailifs and council of Edinburgh
to give him the banquet, that he might be dismissed honorably, according to the
amity of ancient times betwixt the two Nations; This command was given on
Saturday by His highness, and the banquet appointed to be on the Monday: A
number of the foresaid Presbytery understanding thereof, convened themselves
on Sunday in the morning, and presumptuously determin^d and agreed, that the
Ministers of Edinburgh should proclaim a Fast upon the said Monday, where their
several Ministers one after another made three diverse sermons, invectives
against the Provost-Bailiffs, and council for the time, and the Noblemen in
the country who assisted the banquet at. His Majesty's command. The foresaid
Presbytery called and persued them, and scarcely by His Majesty's authority
could be withheld from excommunicating the said Magistrates and Noblemen,
for obeying only His highness lawful command, which the law of all countries
called jus gentium, requires toward Ambassadors of foreign countries: And
not only in this, but innumerable other things, their commandment was
opposite directly under pain of Excommunication, to the Kings Majesty and His
laws, which form of doing engendered nothing but disquiet, sedition and trouble,
as may manifestly appear, in that the special authors of the inventing,
promoting and assisting of the aforesaid pretended Presbyters, have joined
themselves with His Majesty's Rebels; and flying forth of the Realm in respect
of their guiltiness, have discovered what malicious practices were devised
amongst them, if God had not in time provided remedy. The other form of
judgment which His Majesty has discharged, is the general assembly of the
whole Clergy of the Realm, under pretense whereof, a number of Ministers from
several Presbyteries did assemble, with some Gentlemen of the country, whereof
some for that time malcontents of the State, sought that color, as favorers
of the ministry; by which they have practiced many enterprises in the Realm;
where there was no certain law in Ecclesiastical affairs, but all depended
upon the said general convention, where the laws of the Church were alterable
after the plurality of votes, which for the most part succeeded to the most
unlearned of the multitude: This general assembly, amongst other things, did
appoint and agree with His Majesty's Regents in His highness minority, that
the estate of Bishops (which is one of the estates of the Parliament) should be
maintained and authorized, as it is registered in the books of council, and
subscribed by the Commissioners for the time: which order was observed many
years, and Bishops by their consents appointed to the Diocesses, where within
this late time in assemblies holden at Dundee and Glascow respective, the
foresaid Ministers and assemblies, took upon them contrary to their own
handwriting, to discharge the estate, and to declare the same to be unlawful
in their pretended manner: And there commanded the Bishops of the Country, to
lay down and leave their Offices and jurisdictions, and that in no wise they
should pass to the Kings Majesty's Council or Parliament, without commission
obtained from their Assembly; That they should vote nothing in Parliament or
Council, but according to their acts and injunctions: And further, they
directed their Commissioners to the Kings Majesty, commanding him and the
Council, under the pain of the censures of the Church (whereby they understood
excommunication) to appoint no Bishop in times to come, because they had
concluded that estate to be unlawful. And notwithstanding that which they
would have dejected in the Bishops, they concluded to erect in themselves,
desiring that such Commissioners as they should send to Parliament and
Council, might be authorized in place of the estate, whereby it should have
come to pass, that whereas now His Majesty may select the most godly, learned,
wise, and experimented of the Ministry to be on His Majesty's Estate, His
highness should have been by that means compelled to accept such as the
multitude by an odd vote of the most unlearned should have appointed, which
could not tend but to the overthrow of the realm, whereof that Estate has been
a special stay: After they had discharged Bishops, they agreed to have
Superintendents, Commissioners, and Visitors, but in the end they decreed that
there should be no difference amongst the Ministers, and imagined that new form
of Presbytery, whereof we have spoken before: Neither was there any other
appearance that they should have stayed from such daily alterations in the
Commonwealth, which could not but continually be disquieted, where the law of
conscience (which they maintained by the sword of cursing) was subject to such
mutations at the arbitrament of a number, whereof the most part had not greatly
tasted of learning: After the foresaid assembly was accustomed not only to
prescribe the law to the King and State, but also did at certain times appoint
general Fastings thoroughout the realm; especially when some factioners in the
country were to move any great enterprise: For at the Fast all the Ministers
were commanded by the said assembly to sing one song, and to cry out of the
abuses (as they termed it) of the Court and State for the time: whereby it is
most certain, great alterations have ensued in this land; until at the good
pleasure of God, and his blessing toward His Maj. the pretext of the last Fast
was discovered, and His highness delivered from such attempts: whereby His
Maj. has been justly moved to discharge such conventions, which might import
so prejudicially to His Estate; but especially. His Maj. had no small occasion.
Whereas the same assembly being convened at Edinburgh the day of did authorize
and avow the fact perpetrate at Ruthuen in the taking of His highness most
noble person: The which deed; although His Maj. with the advice of His States
in Parliament has counted to be treasonable, the said assembly (esteeming
their judgment to be the sovereign judgment of the realm) has not only
approved the same, but ordained all them to be excommunicate who would not
subscribe and allow the same: So the Acts of this Assembly, and the Acts of
Estate directly in civil matters, with which the Assembly should not have
meddled; it behoved His highness either to discharge himself of the crown, or
the Ministry of that form of assembly, which in very deed in it self, without
the Kings Majesty's license and approbation could not be lawful. Like as
general Councels at no time could assemble but by the command of the Emperor
for the time. And our King has no less power in his own realm, then any of
them had in the Empire; yea the Bishop of St. Andrews had not in time of Popery
power to convene the Bishops and Clergy out of his own Diocese, without
license impetrate before of His highness most noble progenitors of good memory,
and the causes thereof intimated and allowed: Notwithstanding that His Maj.
intention and meaning may be fully understood, it is His highness will, that
the Bishop or Commissioner of any Diocese or Province, or part thereof, shall
at their Visitation appoint in every parish (according to the greatness thereof)
some honest, virtuous and discreet men, to concur and assist the Minister, and
to have the oversight and censure of the manners and behavior of the people of
that Parish: And that there be any notable offense worthy of punishment, that
the Bish. and Com. be advertised thereof, who shall have an Officer of arms to
concur with his decree for the punishment of vice, and execution to follow
thereupon; that they who contemn the godly and lawful Order of the Church, may
find by experience His Majesty's displeasure, and be punished according to
their deservings.

And further, his Maj. upon necessary occasions which may happen by diverse
manners of ways amongst the Clergy, upon humble supplications made to his
Highness will not refuse to grant them license to convene: to wit, the
Bishops, Commissioners, and some of the most virtuous, learned, godly of their
Diocese, where such Ecclesiastical matters as appertain to the Uniformity of
Doctrine, and conservation of any godly order in the Church, may be entreated
and concluded in his Maj. own presence, or some of his Maj. honorable
Council, who shall assist for the time; where if necessity so require a
public Fast throughout the whole Realm may be decreed, and by his Maj.
Authority proclaimed, to avoid the eminent displeasure and danger of the wrath
of the Lords judgments, which is the right end of the public Humiliation, and
not under pretext thereof to cover such enterprises as have heretofore greatly
disquieted and troubled the Peace of this Commonwealth.

THe XX. Act, ratisieth, and approves, and re-establisheth the estate of the
Bishops within the Realm, to have the oversight and jurisdiction; every one in
their own Diocese, which form of government and rule in Ecclesiastical affairs
has not only continued in the Church from the days of the Apostles by
continual succession of time, and many Martyrs in that calling shed their
blood for the Truth; but also since this Realm embraced and received the
Christian Religion, the same estate has been maintained to the welfare of the
Church, and quietness of the Realm without any interruption while within these
few years, some curious and busy men have practiced to bring in the Ministry
an equality and purity in all things, as well concerning the preaching of the
Word, and ministration of the Sacraments; as likewise in discipline, order and
policy: The which confusion his Maj. finding by most dangerous experience, to
have been the Mother and Nurse of great factions, seditions, and troubles
within this Realm, has with the advice of his Highness Estates, maturely, and
advisedly concluded the said pretended party in discipline, order, and policy
in the Church to be no longer tolerate in this Country, but the solicitude and
care of my Churches of one Diocese, to appertain to the Bishop and
Commissioner thereof, who shall be answerable to His Majesty, and Estates, for
the right administration and discharge of the office of particular Ministers
within the bounds of their jurisdiction: For as it becomes his Majesty (as
Eusebius writes of CONSTANTINE the Great) to be a Bishop of Bishops, and
universal Bishop within his realm, in so far as His Majesty should appoint
every one to discharge his duty; so His highness cannot (his country being
large and great) take him to every Minister that shall offend and transgress
against duty, or quarrel with the whole number of the ministry; but it
behooves His Majesty to have Bishops and overseers under him, that may be
answerable for such bounds, as the law and order of the country has limited
and appointed unto every one of them: And that they having access unto His
Majesty's Parliament and Council, may intercede for the rest of the brethren
of the ministry, propound their griefs unto His highness and the Estates, and
receive His Majesty's favorable answer therein: The which form does preserve a
godly harmony, unity, peace and concord in the estate, and a solid order in the
Church. As contrariwise the pretended equality divides the same, and under
pretext of equality, makes some of the most crafty and suitable dealers to be
advanced and enricht; and in pretending of purity, to seek nothing but their
own ambition and advancement above the rest of the simple sort: And
notwithstanding that His Majesty has re-establisht the said estate, it is not
His highness will and intention, that the foresaid Bishop shall have such
full power, as to do within his Diocese what he pleases; For as His Majesty
cannot allow of a popular confusion, wherein as the proverb witnesses, Nulla
tyrannis aquiparanda est tyrannidi multitudinis; that is, No tyranny can be
compared to the tyranny of a multitude, having power in their hands: So on the
other part, His Majesty's will is, that the Bishops authority in any grave
matter, be limited and circumscribed to 13. of the most ancient, wise and godly
pastors of his Diocese, selected forth of the whole Synodal assembly of the
Province, by whose advice or at the least the most part thereof, the grave and
weighty affayrs of the Church may be conducted and governed to the glory of
God, and quietness of the realm: Further, it is His highness will and express
commandment, that their Bishops and Commissioners twice in the year; to wit,
ten days after the Pasche time, and the sixth day of September, hold their
Synodall assemblies of every Dioces, for the keeping good order therein: And if
any be refractory or a contemner within their bounds, of the good order of the
Church, they may be declared unto His Majesty, and punished in example of others
according to their deservings. Neither is it His Majesty's meaning or
intention, that such Bishops or Commissioners as shall be appointed, shall
receive their only and full Commission of His Majesty, without admission
ordinary by such as are appointed to that effect in the Church, but having His
highness nomination, presentation and commendation, as lawful and only
patron, they to be tried and examined that their qualities are such, as they
are able and sufficient to discharge their cure and office; and if it shall
happen any of the said Bishops or Commissioners to be negligent in their
Office, or to be scandalous or offensive in their behavior life and manners in
any time coming, it is not His highness will, that they shall be exempt from
correction, notwithstanding of any privilege of His highness Estate, counsel
or Parliament, but their labors, travails, diligence, and behavior, to be
tried in the general assembly, not consisting of a confused multitude, as it
was before, but of such worshipful persons as is heretofore prescribed in His
highness own presence, or His Majesty's deputies to that effect: Last His
Majesty gives Commission to the said Bishops or Commissioners at their
visitations to consider, in what part of the country the exercise or
interpretation of the Scriptures by conference of a certain number of the
ministry within that bounds may be most commodiously, in the fifteen days: For
as His Majesty inhibits all unlawful conventions, which may engender troubles
and contentions in the Country, so His Majesty is well affected to see the
ministry increase in knowledge and understanding, and by all means to fortify
and advance the same; wherein His Majesty's commandment is, that a grave,
wise, and sage man, shall be appointed President, who may have the oversight of
that bounds, and be answerable therefore to the Bishop his Council and Synod,
and he to be respected reasonably for his pains at the modification of
stypends, that all things may be orderly done in the Church, peace and
quietness maintained in the realm, and we delivered from the appearing
plagues, and the blessing of God continued, to the comfort of our posterity.

And in the mean time, His highness inhibits and expressly commands under the
pains contained in His Majesty's Acts of Parliament, and all other pains
arbitrall at His Majesty's sight and counsel: That no Minister take in hand to
convene themselves for the foresaid cause, without the appointment and order
taken by the said Bishops or Commissioners, whereby His Highness may be
certainly informed, that the foresaid Ministers convene not, to meddle with any
civil matters, or affairs of Estate, as was occasioned before, but only to
profit in the knowledge of the Word, and to be comforted one by another in the
administration of their spiritual Office, which His highness wishes them
faithfully to discharge; and then to call to God that His Majesty may in a
prosperous reign enjoy good and long life, and continue and increase into the
fear of the Almighty.

The Kings Majesty's intentions.
HIs Majesty's intention is, by the grace of God, to maintain the true and
sincere profession of the Gospel and preaching thereof, within this Realm.

2 His Majesty's intention is, to correct and punish such as seditiously abuse
the chair of truth, and factionsly apply or other wise bewray the text of the
Scripture to the disquieting of the Estate, and disturbing of the Commonwealth,
or empairing His highness or Councels honor.

3 His Majesty's intention is, if any question of faith or doctrine arise, to
convocate the most learned, godly, wise and experimented Pastors, that by
conference of Scriptures the verity may be tried, and heresy and schism by
that means repressed.

4 His Majesty's intention is, that for keeping good order in every Parish,
certain to be censors of manners of the rest, be appointed at the visitation of
the Bishop, or Visitor, who shall have His Majesty's authority and Officers of
Arms concurring for the punishment of vice.

5 His Majesty's intention is, to maintain the exercise of prophecy for the
increase and continuing of knowledge in the Ministry, in the which a wise and
grave man selected by the Bishop or Commissioner at the Synodall assembly shall
preside; and render an account of the administration of that bounds where the
exercise is holden, For which cause some respect of living shall be had to him
who sustaineth the burden.

6 His Majesty's intention is, not to derogate unto the ordinary judgment of
matters of the Church by the ordinary Bishops, their Councels and Synodes, but
if any of them do amiss and abuse their callings, to take order for the
correcting, amending and punishing thereof.

7 His Maj. intention is, not to hinder or stay any godly or solid order
grounded upon the word of God, and order of the primitive Church, but that the
Ministers of the word, meddle only with their own calling, and judge not
temerariously of the state.

8 It is His Maj. intention, that the Presbyteries consisting of many Ministers
and Gentlemen at Landwart, or otherwise, be no further tolerated within this
Realm, but the exercise and jurisdictions of the Churches to be in the hands of
the Bishop or Commissioner, and their Councels or Synods.

9. His Maj. intention is, that the Bishops or Commissioners convene not any
general assembly out of the whole realm, without His Maj. knowledge, and
license obtained thereunto, which upon supplication His highness will not
deny, that an uniform order may be conserved in the whole realm, the Bishops
and their diligences there tried and examined, and the complaints of every
particular heard and discussed.

10 It is His Majesty's intention, to assist this assembly himself, or by a
Nobleman of his Council his Deputy.

11 It is his Maj. intention, that when any parish finds necessity of a Fast,
they intimate the occasion to the Bishop or Commissioner their Council, that
they may understand that the cause is lawful: Likewise the Bishop of the
Diocese finding lawful occasion, may with his Council, prescribe a public
humiliation there.

12 It is his Majesty's intention, that a general Fast throughout the whole
realm, shall not be proclaimed but by His Majesty's commandment, or by that
general Council, wherein His Majesty or His highness Deputy be present.

13 It is His highness intention, that the Bishops in the Realm in every
Diocese, with their Council, preside into the Ecclesiastical government, but
as is said, with a Council, that both tyranny and confusion may be avoided in
the Church.

14 It is His highness intention, that Commissioners be directed universally
throughout the whole realm to establish a godly order, and that his Majesty's
Commissioners take order presently for the translation of such Ministers, whose
travels they esteem may more conveniently and profitably serve in another place.
