The Loyal Subjects Jubilee, or Cromwels Farewell to England, being a Poem on
his advancing to Ireland, July the 11. 1649.
It Is high contempt not for to Fast and pray,
And hold as blessed Saint Cromwels Holy day,
The Devils a Saint, if he deserves to be
One for his Machivillian Treachery.
Insatiate Monster, that does swallow down
At once a Kingdom and a glorious Crown,
Whose splendour dazzled Mortals while it stood
On Charles his head, but dimmed since dipped in blood
May every stone that did adorn it round,
As witnesses against thee once be found,
And weigh thee down to Hell, thou horrid fell lion,
To have reward for this thy grand Rebellion.
But first thy progress into Ireland take,
And see what preparations they will make,
(To entertain thee) for that end a day
Weel set apart, and for thee this we will pray;
Come ye grim Furies of the Stigian Lake,
With hideous cries, and make the welking shake,
Rouse Charon up, winds, Seas, and all implore,
To waft this Rebel to the Irish shore,
Where such a Feast prepared for him shall be,
The like at Grocers-Hall he never did see:
Ormond chief Cook will be to please his pallet,
And send a fiery Bullet for a Sallet,
Which shall such terror to his Saintship bring,
And make him cry, would he had spared our King;
The blood methinks does startle in his face,
That he no rest can take in any place,
His Exits come, Ireland the Stage must be,
Where he must act his latest Tragedy,
Where he his life shall spend in discontent,
And bid farewell to Englands Parliament.
May thy horses founder, thy Soldiers weary grow
Upon their march they can no further go,
Or if march on upon the Irish sight,
Take to their heels, and finely give thee flight,
And may this noise of their most eager running,
Still make thee think that Charles the II coming
To claim his due with a victorious hand,
And purge all Rebels from his English Land.
May the day look black, and soon convert to night,
Only thy ruby Nose to give thee light;
And that thou may to shipping safely get,
Hell for thy lifeguard shall the Furies set,
Charon thy Ferry-man shall be, and once being ore,
May thou nere come to vex the English shore.
Finis.
