A Declaration of the Lords and Commons now Assembled in PARLIAMENT.
WE the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, Having taken into serious
consideration, the present State and Condition of imminent danger, in which the
Kingdom now stands, by reason of a malignant Party, prevailing with His
Majesty, putting Him upon violent and perilous ways, and now in Arms against
us, to the hazarding of His Majesty's Person, and for the oppression of the
true Religion, The Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, and the Power and
Privilege of Parliament; all which, every honest man is bound to defend;
especially those who have taken the late Protestation, by which they are more
particularly tied unto it, and the more answerable before God, should they
neglect it: Wherefore, we finding our selves engaged in a necessity, to take up
Arms likewise, for the defense of these, which otherwise must suffer and
perish; And having used all good ways and means to prevent extremities, and
preserve the peace of the Kingdom (which good endeavors of ours, the malignity
of our enemies has rendered altogether successelesse and vain;) Do now think
fit to give this account unto the World, to be a satisfaction unto all men, of
the justice of our proceedings; and a warning unto those, who are involved in
the same danger with us, to let them see the necessity, and duty which lies
upon them, to save themselves, their Religion, and Country; For which purpose,
we set out this ensuing Declaration.

THat it appears by the Answer which His Majesty has given to the humble
Petition for peace, presented unto Him by both Houses of Parliament, and those
demands which He makes, That the design which has been so long carried on to
alter the frame and constitution of this Government, both in Church and State,
is now come to ripeness; and the Contrivers of it, conceive themselves arrived
to that Condition of strength, That they shall be able to put it in present
execution.

For, What else can be signified by the demanding of Hull, the Fleet, and the
Magazine to be immediately delivered up, All our preparations of force to
cease, And the defensive Arms of the Parliament to be laid down, And the
Parliament to be adiourned to another place; then, That we should out of the
sense of our own inability to make resistance, yield our selves to the cruel
Mercy of those who have possessed the King against us, and incited Him to
violate all the Privileges, and revile the Persons and Proceedings of the
Parliament; or else, if (as it cannot be otherwise conceived) we do not grant
what is so unreasonable and destructive, forthwith to bring on that force which
is prepared against us, by the concurrence and assistance of Papists, an
ambitious and discontented Clergy, Delinquents obnoxious to the justice of
Parliament; and some ill affected Persons of the Nobility and Gentry; who out
of their desire of a dissolute liberty, apprehend, and would keep off the
Reformation intended by the Parliament.

These Persons have conspired together to ruin this Parliament, which alone
has set a stop to that violence so long intended, and often attempted, for the
Alteration of Religion, and subversion of the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom.

How far we were plunged in a miserable expectation of most evil days, and
how fast this growing mischief prevailed upon us before the Parliament, needs
not now be declared, It being so fresh and bleeding in every man's memory.
Religion was made but form, and outside; and those who made conscience to
maintain the substance and purity of it, whether Clergy, or others, were
discountenanced and oppressed, as the great Enemies of the State. The Laws were
no defense, nor protection of any man's right, All was subject to will, and
power, which imposed what payments they thought fit, to drain the Subjects
purse, and supply those necessities, which their ill Counsels had brought upon
the King, or gratify such as were instruments in promoting those illegal, and
oppressive courses. They who yielded and complied, were countenanced and
advanced; all others disgraced and kept under: That so men's minds made poor
and base, and their Liberties lost and gone, they might be ready to let go
their Religion, whenever it should be resolved to alter it: Which was, and
still is the great design, and all else made use of, but as instrumentary and
subservient to it.

When they conceived the way to be sufficiently prepared, They at last resolved
to put on their Masterpiece in Scotland, (where the same method had been
followed) and more boldly to unmask themselves, in imposing upon them a Popish
service Book, for well they knew the same Fate attended both Kingdoms, and
Religion could not be altered in the one, without the other. God raised the
Spirits of that Nation to oppose it, with so much zeal and indignation, That it
kindled such a flame, as no expedient could be found, but a Parliament here, to
quench it.

This necessity brought on this Parliament, and the same necessity gave it in
the beginning power, to act with more vigor and resolution, then former
Parliaments had done, And to set upon a Reformation of the great disorders,
both in the Ecclesiastical, and Civil state; which drew a more particular
envy, and odium upon it, then was usual to the generallity of Parliaments; and
was a cause, that those, who had swallowed up in their thoughts, our Religion
and Liberties, and now saw themselves defeated by this means, bended all their
endeavors, and raised all their forces to destroy it.

First, Whilst the Scottish Army remained here, they endeavored to incense
the two Nations, and engage their Armies one against the other; that in such a
confusion as needs must have followed, the Parliament might not be able to sit;
and those forces destroying one another, might open some opportunity for them
to gain their ends upon both Kingdoms; and that then, as their need, so the
being of the Parliament might cease: The wisdom of the Parliament prevented
that mischief, and composed those great differences betwixt the King and the
Kingdom of Scotland. That plot failing, they endeavored to turn the English
Army against the Parliament: This was discovered, the chief Actors fled, and
the danger avoided. Then they labor to stir up the Scottish Army against us;
But such was the faithfulness and affection of those our Brethren, that they
could not effect it.

After this they carry the King into Scotland, to try if a party could be there
raised, to suppress first, the good party in that Kingdom, and so strengthened
from thence, the better to compass their intended purpose here. At the same
time, The Rebellion in Ireland, an egg likewise of their hatching, breaks out.
But their plot failed in Scotland; yet upon hopes of success there, Such
preparatives were here, and such recourse of ill affected Persons to this Town,
That the Parliament thought it necessary for their own security, to have a
guard. The King upon His return instantly dismisses that guard, and puts
another upon us, which produced such ill effects, as we were glad to dismiss
them, and rather run any hazard then have such a guard.

Thus left naked, Presently some Members of both Houses are unjustly charged
with Treason; and the King comes with a Troop of Cavaliers to the House of
Commons, to fetch those away by force, whom be had caused to be so unjustly
accused; The greatest violation of the privileges of Parliament, that ever was
attempted, and so manifest a destruction of the right of the Subject, which is
only preserved by Parliament, That the City of London took a pious and generous
Resolution, to guard the Parliament themselves. Which so grieved and enraged
those wicked Persons, who had engaged the King in that last, and all those
other designs and practices against the Parliament, That they make him forsake
Whitehall, under pretense that His Person was there in danger, A suggestion as
false as the Father of lies can invent.

Then do they work upon him, and upon the Queen, persuade her to retire out of
the Kingdom, and carry him further and further from the Parliament, and so
possess him with an hatred of it, that they cannot put words bitter enough
into his mouth, to express it upon all occasions; They make him cross,
oppose, and inveigh against all the proceedings of Parliament; encourage and
protect all those who will affront it; take away all power and authority from
it, to make it contemptible and of less esteem then the meanest Court; draw
away the Members, commanding them to come to him to York, and in stead of
discharging their duty in the service of the Parliament, to contribute their
advice and assistance to the destruction of it; endeavor to possess the
people, that the Parliament will take away the Law, and introduce an Arbitrary
Government; A thing which every honest Moral man abhors, much more the Wisdom,
Justice, and Piety of the two Houses of Parliament; and in truth such a charge,
as no Rational man can believe, It being unpossible so many several persons,
as the two Houses of Parliament consist of, about six hundred, and in either
House all of equal power, should all of them, or at least the major part,
agree in Acts of Will and Tyranny, which make up an Arbitrary Government; and
most improbable, that the Nobility, and chief Gentry of this Kingdom, should
conspire to take away the Law, by which they enjoy their Estates, are protected
from any Act of Violence, and Power, and differenced from the meaner sort of
people, with whom otherwise they would be but fellow servants.

To make all this good upon the Parliament; and either make the Kingdom believe
it, or so awe it, as no body shall dare say the contrary; force is prepared,
men are levied, and the Malignant party of the Kingdom, as was before
specified, that is, Papists, the Prelaticall Clergy, Delinquents, and that
part of the Nobility and Gentry, which either fear Reformation, or seek
preferment by betraying their Country, to serve the Court, have combined, to
bury the happiness of this Kingdom, in the ruin of this Parliament; and by
forcing it, to cut up the freedom of Parliament by the root; and either take
all Parliaments away, or which is worse, make them the instruments of slavery,
to confirm it by Law, and leave the disease incurable.

That done, then come they to crown their work, and put that in execution,
which was first in their intention, that is, the changing of Religion into
Popery and Superstition.

All this while the two Houses of Parliament have with all duty and loyalty
still applied themselves unto His Majesty, and labored by humble prayers, and
clear and convincing Reasons and Arguments in several Petitions, to satisfy
him of their intentions, the justness of their proceedings, their desire of
the safety of His Royal Person, and of the Peace of the Kingdom.

And only to preserve that Peace, and prevent the pernicious practices of these
Incendaries, (such as the Lord Digby, who at first persuaded the King to get
into some strong place, that He might there protect those, whom he styled the
Kings Servants, but in truth such as do divide Him from His Parliament and
Kingdom, and might be revenged upon His Parliament, where he said Traitors bare
that sway, And who in the mean time promised he would do him service abroad,
which by his own Letters appears to be the procuring of supplies against the
Kingdom and Parliament, with which he himself said he would return, as since
he has done disguised, with store of Arms, in the Ship called THE PROVIDENCE;
And who had attempted upon the Kings first going from White Hall, to raise some
numbers of horse and foot, under the color of a Guard for His Majesty to be
the foundation of an Army against the Parliament, which then failing, has
since taken effect, and shows what was then in their thoughts, before Hull, or
the Militia, or any thing else of that nature was in Question) the Parliament
thought fit to secure Hull, least it might be a receptacle of such ill-affected
persons, and of what aid could be gotten from Foreign parts; the Fleet under
the Earl of Warwick, to defend the Kingdom, and prevent such mischief from
abroad; the Magazin of Arms, that they should not be employed against Us; and
the Militia of the Kingdom in such hands, as the Parliament might confide in,
to suppress commotions within our selves.

And how necessary all this was to be done, the succeeding designs and
practices upon them, all do sufficiently manifest; And great cause has the
whole Kingdom to bless God, who put it into the heads and hearts of the
Parliament, to take care of these particulars. For were these pernicious
persons about the King Masters of them, how easy would it be for them to
master the Parliament, and Master the Kingdom? And what could we expect but
ruin and destruction from such Masters, who make the King in this manner
revile, and detest Us and our Actions; such, who have embarked Him in so many
designs to overthrow this Parliament; such, who have so long thirsted to see
Religion and Liberty confounded together?

Let the world now judge, what more could be done by Us, then we have done to
appease His Majesty, and regain His Grace and Favor, if (after the presenting
of such a Petition as the last was, so full of submisse, humble, affectionate
desires of Peace, so full of Duty and Loyalty, as we thought malice it self
could nor have excepted against it, And having received so sharp a return,
such expressions of birternesse, a justification and avowed protection of
Delinquents from the hand of Justice, Demands of so apparent danger, such
manifestations of an intention to destroy Us, and with Us the whole Kingdom;
and this more clearly evidenced by their subsequent Actions, even since these
Propositions have been made unto Us from His Majesty, overrunning several
Counties, compelling the Trained Bands by force to come in, and join with
them, or disarming them, and putting their Arms into the hands of lewd and
desperate persons, thereby turning the Arms of the Kingdom against it self) it
be not fit for Us, not only not to yield to what is required, but also to make
further provision, for the preservation of Our selves, and of those who have
sent Us hither, and entrusted Us with all they have, Estate, Liberty, and
Life, and that which is the life of their lives, their Religion, and even for
the safety of the Kings Person now environed by those, who carry Him upon His
own ruin, and the destruction of all His People: At least to give them
warning, that all this is in danger; That if the King may force this
Parliament, they may bid farewell to all Parliaments, from ever receiving good
by them; and if Parliaments be lost, they are lost: Their Laws are lost, as
well those lately made, as in former times, all which will be cut in sunder,
with the same sword now drawn for the destruction of this Parliament.

Then, If they will not come to help the Parliament, and save themselves,
though both they and We must perish, yet have We discharged Our consciences,
and delivered Our Souls; and We will look for a reward in Heaven, should We be
so ill required upon Earth, by those of whom We have so well deserved; which We
cannot fear, having found upon all occasions such real Demonstrations of
their love and affection, and of their right understanding and apprehension of
Our and their common danger; Especially now, that the Question is so clearly
stated, and that it appears that neither Hull, nor the Militia, nor the
Magazin, are the grounds of the war, which is so furiously driven on against us,
by a Malignant party of Papists, those who call themselves Cavaliers, and other
ill-affected persons; but so far forth only, As the Parliament and all the
Members of both Houses, and all other persons who have showed themselves
forward for the defense of the sincerity of Religion, the Laws and Liberties of
the Kingdom, and the just power and Privileges of Parliament, are preserved
and secured thereby.

For the many designs upon the Parliament above mentioned, The attempts to be
possessed of Hull, and of the Magazine, by sending thither Captain Leg a
Delinquent to the Parliament, for having had a hand in the treasonable practice
to bring up the Army against us, and the Earl of Newcastle in a disguised
habit, which was a pursuance of the Lord Digbies advice, and the endeavoring
to raise forces under pretense of a Guard to the Kings Person in the winter,
All this before we meddled with Hull, or Magazin, or Militia, show plainly that
Our Act in securing them, was not the cause of the Kings taking up Arms, and
exercising hostility upon His Loving and Loyal Subjects, which was in the
thoughts and endeavors of those about His Majesty, who then had, and still
have the greatest influence upon His Counsels, before We thought of Hull, or
Militia, or any thing else of that nature; And, that our resigning of them now,
would not prevail with Him to make him lay down His Arms, and return to His
Parliament, and gratify the earnest and longing desires of His People, to
enjoy His presence, favor, and protection: But that, if He could recover
(either by Our Resignation, or any other way) pieces of so much advantage to
Him, and weakening to Us, use would be made of them to Our infinite prejudice
and ruin, The intention being still the same, not to rest satisfied with
having Hull, or taking away the Ordinance of the Militia; But, to destroy the
Parliament, and be masters of Our Religion and Liberties, To make Us slaves,
and alter the Government of this Kingdom, and reduce it to the condition of
some other Countries, which are not governed by Parliaments, and so by Laws,
but by the will of the Prince, or rather of those who are about him.

Yet willingly would we give His Majesty satisfaction in these particulars
(and so have we offered it) could we be secured, that disarming our selves, and
delivering them up to His Majesty, (as the sword of Justice is already put
into the hands of diverse Popish, and other ill-affected persons, by putting
them into the Commissions of the Peace, and other Commissions, and putting out
others that are well-affected) so we should not for our own destruction put
the Military sword into the hands of those evil Councillors, and ill-affected
persons, who are so prevalent with His Majesty, Papists many of them, or very
late Converts, by taking the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, for which,
they may very well have a dispensation, or Indulgence, to be enabled thereby to
promote so great a service for the Popish cause, as to destroy the two Houses
of Parliament, and through their sides, the Protestant Religion.

But we have too just cause to believe and know, considering those continued
designs upon Us, and the composition of the Kings Army, and of His Counsel at
this time, that these things are desired, to be made use of to Our destruction,
and the destruction of that which we are bound by Our Protestation to defend,
and woe to Us if We do it not, at least do Our utmost endeavors in it, for the
discharge of Our Duties, and the saving of our Souls, and leave the success
to God Almighty.

Therefore we the Lords and Commons are resolved to expose our Lives and
Fortunes for the defense and maintenance of the true Religion, the Kings
Person, Honor and Estate, the Power and Privilege of Parliament, and the just
Rights, and Liberties of the Subject, And for the prevention of that
mischievous design, which gives motion to all the rest, and has been so
strongly pursued these many years, The altering of our Religion, which if God
in his mercy had not miraculously diverted, long ago had we been brought to the
condition of poor Ireland, weltring in our own blood and confusion.

And we do here require All those who have any sense of piety, honor, or
compassion, to help a distressed state, especially such as have taken the
Protestation, and are bound in the same duty with us unto their God, their King
and Country, To come into our aid, and assistance: This being the true cause
for which we raise an Army, under the Command of the Earl of Essex, with whom
in this Cause we will Live and Die.

FINIS.
