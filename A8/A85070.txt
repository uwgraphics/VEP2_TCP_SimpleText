The faithful Lovers Downfall: OR, The Death of Fair Phillis Who Killed her self
for loss of her Philander.
Phillis for loss of her Philander,
Through each Grove does wander;
Until she hears by fate he is slain,
Which causes her so to complain:
O're-whelm'd in tears, she does conclude,
To end her life, which soon ensued;
For with her fatal Dagger, she
Stabbed to the heart, sets Sorrow free;
Dying with patience, braving Fate,
That to her Love did her translate.
To a Pleasant New Playhouse Tune: Or, Oh! cruel bloody fate.


AH! cruel bloody Fate,
what can thou now do more?
ah me! it is too late,
Philander to restore:
Why should the Power above persuade
poor Mortals to believe,
That they guard us here,
And reward us there,
yet all our Ioys deceive.
Her Dagger then she took,
and held it to her Breast,
And with a Dying look,
these words she then expressed:
Philander, ah my Love, I come,
to meet thy Shade below,
Oh I come, she cried,
With a Wound so wide,
there need no second Blow.
Oh! too Cruel now,
to take my Love away,
Could thou no time allow,
nor grant one moments stay?
Snatched from my arms, and gone so soon
dread Tyrant this I crave,
All the fearfullest Rage
Thou can engage,
and scorning thou should save.
Since Philander is gone,
wounds bleed apace, she cries,
No comfort shall be known,
to Phillis now she sighs:
Be gone my former joys, be gone,
griefs my acquaintance are,
Cruel Powers above,
That still do cross Love,
and drive us on Despair.
How often in this Shade,
have we expressed our joys,
And sighing Vows have made
which cruel Fate destroys:
Oh me, I faint, yet his Loved Name,
recalls my fading Soul,
To think of the bliss,
And the Happiness,
we had without Control.
Oh my dear Love, make room,
unto the Elysium Fields,
Thy Lovesick Phillis comes,
which spring of pleasure yields:
Where fate no more has Power,
to blast our sacred flame,
Nor cruel Stars depose,
Such a happy Bliss,
As in Paradise,
bright Angels do disclose.
My Love on wings of Time,
thy bleeding Phillis flies,
Since in thy Blooming prime,
you are slain, thy Phillis dies:
Farewell fond world and all thy joys,
I here beneath the Shade,
Upon the fair Earth,
That gave us first Birth,
will for ever now be laid.
And think it happy now,
beneath this pleasing fate,
As Love commands to be,
and bless my happy state:
Then she sighs, whilst streams of passion
breath from her fainting Breast,
Soiled her tender Limbs,
At which Crimson streams,
whilst death each part possessed.
My Shepherd now I come,
and will no longer stay,
I have delayed too long,
too long I have been away:
Since Death has proved unkind, he now
for it shall make amends,
In spite of fate,
Shall be mine, though late;
and make us ever friends.
Once more I come, and then
she fell upon the ground,
So raises her self again,
and with a dying swound,
Complained so sore of cruel fate,
wishing all Lovers just,
That they for ever
Might endeavor,
to fulfill Loves trust.
From Crimson Veins her blood
ran streaming down the flour,
Vnmoved she saw the flood
and blessed her dying hour:
Philander, ah Philander, still
the bleeding Phillis cries,
She wept a while,
And she forced a Smile,
then closed her eyes and dies.
FINIS.
