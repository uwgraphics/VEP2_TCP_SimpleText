at Westminster: TOGETHER With their Humble ADVICE Concerning Church Government
And Ordination of Ministers.

LONDON, Printed for Robert Bostock, at the Sign of the Kings Head in Paul's
Churchyard.

THE Confession of Faith, Agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines at
Westminster, To be a part of the Uniformity in Religion between the Churches of
Christ in the three Kingdoms.
CHAP. I. Of the holy Scripture.
ALthough the light of Nature, and the works of Creation and Providence, do so
far manifest the Goodness, Wisdom, and Power of God, as to leave men
unexcusable Romans 2 14. 15. Romans 1. 19, 20. Psalm. 19. 1, 2* 3. Romans 1. 32. with
chap. 2, 1.
; yet are they sufficient to give that knowledge of God and of his Will, which
is necessary unto salvation 1 Cor. 1 21. 1 Cor. 2 13, 14.
. Therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and in diverse manners, to
reveal himself, and to declare that his Will unto his Church Heb. 1. 1
; and afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the Truth, and
for the more sure establishment and comfort of the Church against the
corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the world; to commit
the same wholly unto writing Pro. 22 19. 20, 21 Luke 1. 3. 4 Romans 15. 4 Mat. 4.
4, 7 10. Isai. 8 19, ^0.
: which makes the Holy Scripture to be most necessary 2 Timothy 3 15. 2 Pet. 1 19.
: those former ways of Gods revealing his Will unto his people, being now
ceased Heb. 1. ^. 2.
.

II. Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written; are now
contained all the Books of the Old and New Testament, which are these:

Of the Old Testament.
GEnesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers DeuteronomiE Joshua Judges Ruth I. Samuel II.
Samuel I. Kings II. Kings I. Chronicles II. Chronicles Ezra Nehemiah Esther Job
Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes The Song of Songs Isaiah Jeremiah Lamentations
Ezekiel Daniel Hosea Joel Amos Obadiah Jonah Micah Nahum Habbakkuk Zephaniah
Haggai Zechariah Malachi
Of the New Testament.
The Gospel according to MAtthew Mark Luke John
The Acts of the Apostles. Paul's Epistles to the Romans Corinthians
Corinthians I. Corinthians II. Galatians Ephesians Philippians Colossians
Thessalonians I. Thessalonians II. To Timothy I. To Timothy II. To Titus To
Philemon
The Epistle to the Hebrews. The Epistle of James The first and second Epistles
of Peter. The first, second, and third Epist of John The Epistle of Jude The
Revelat. of John.
All which are given by inspiration of God, to be the Rule of faith and life
Luke 16. 29. 31. Ephesians. 2. 20. Rev 22. 18: 19. 2 Timothy 3. 16.
.

III. The Books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of Divine inspiration, are
no part of the Cannon of the Scripture; and therefore are of no authority in
the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other
humane Writings Luke 24. 27, 44. Romans 3. 2. ^ Pet* 1. 21.
.

IV. The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and
obeyed, depends not upon the Testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly
upon God (who is Truth it self) the Author thereof: and therefore it is to be
receive,d because it is the Word of God 2 Pet. 1. 19, 21. 2 Timothy 3. 16 1 John
5. 9 1 These. 2. 13
.

V. We may be moved and induced by the Testimony of the Church to an high and
reverend esteem of the holy Scripture 1 Timothy 3. 15.
. And the heavenlinesse of the Matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, the
majesty of the Style, the consent of all the Parts, the Scope of the whole
(which is, to give all glory to God,) the full discovery it makes of the only
way of man's salvation, the many other incomparable Excellencies, and the entire
perfection thereof, are Arguments whereby it does abundantly evidence it self
to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance
of the infallible truth, and Divine authority thereof, is from the inward work
of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word, in our hearts 1 John
2. 20, 27. John 16. 13 14. 1 Cor. 2. 10, 11. 12. Isa. 59. 21.
.

VI. The whole Council of GOD concerning all things necessary for his own
Glory, man's salvation, Faith, and Life, is either expressly set down in
Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture:
unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of
the Spirit, or traditions of men 2 Timothy 3 15. 16, 17. Gal 1. 8. 9. 2 These 3. 2.
. Nevertheless we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to
be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the
Word Ioh. 6. 4^: 1 Cor. 2, 9, 10, 12.
: and that there are some circumstances concerning the Worship of God, and
Government of the Church, common to humane actions and Societies, which are to
be ordered by the light of Nature and Christian Prudence, according to the
general Rules of the Word, which are always to be observed 1 Cor. 11. 13, 14.
1 Cor. 14, 26. 40.
.

VII. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike
clear unto all 2 Pet. 3. 16.
: yet those things which are necessary, to be known, believed, and observed for
salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or
other, that not only the Learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the
ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them Psalm. 119
105. 130.
.

VIII. The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the Native Language of the people
of God of old, (and the New Testament in Greek, (which at the time of writing
of it was most generally known to the Nations) being immediately inspired by
God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all Ages, are
therefore Authentical Mat. 5. 18
; so as, in all Controversies of Religion, the Church is finally to appeal unto
them Isa 8. 20 Act. 15. 15 John 5. 39 46.
. But, because these Original Tongues are not known to all the people of God,
who have right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the
fear of GOD, to read and search them John 5. 39.
, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar Language of every Nation
unto which they come 1 Cor. 14* 6, 9, 11, 12, 24, 27, 28.
, that the Word of GOD dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him in an
acceptable manner Col. 3. 16
; and, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope Romans 15. 4
.

IX. The infallible Rule of Interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture it
self: and therefore, when there is a Question about the true and full sense of
any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one) it must be searched and known by
other places that speak more clearly 2 Pet. 1. 20, 21. Acts 15. 15, 16.
.

X. The Supreme Judge by which all Controversies of Religion are to be
determined and all Decrees of Councels, Opinions of Ancient Writers, Doctrines
of men, and private spirits, are to be examined; and, in whose Sentence we are
to rest: can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture Mat. 22.
29. 31. Ephe. 2. 20. with Acts 28. 23.
.

CHAP. II. Of God, and of the holy Trinity.
THere is but one only Deuteronomy. 6. 4. 1 Cor. 8. 4. 6
, living, and true God 1 These. 1. 9 Ier. 10. 10.

; and withal, most just and terrible in his judgments Nehem. 9. 32. 33.
, hating all sin Psa. 5. 5, 6.
, and who will by no means clear the guilty Nah 1. 2, 3. Exodus 34 7.
.

II. God has all life John. 5. 26.
, glory Acts 7. 2.
, goodness Psalm. 119. 68.
, blessedness 1 Timothy 6. 15. Romans 9. 5.
, in, and of himself; and is alone in, and unto himself all-sufficient, not
standing in need of any creatures which he has made Act. 17. 24, 25.
, nor deriving any Glory from them Job 22. 2, 3
, but only manifesting his own glory, in, by, unto, and upon them: He is the
alone Fountain of all Being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things
Romans 11 36
; and, has most Sovereign Dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or
upon them whatsoever himself pleases Rev. 4. 11. 1 Timothy 6. 15. Dan. 4. 25, 31.
. In his sight all things are open and manifest Heb. 4. 13.
, his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature Romans
11. 33, 34. Psalm. 147. 5.
, so as nothing is to him contingent, or uncertain Act. 15. 18. Ezekiel. 11. 5.
. He is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his
commands Psalm. 145. 17. Romans 7. 12*
. To him is due from Angels and men, and every other creature, whatsoever
worship, service, or obedience he is pleased to require of them Rev. 5. 1^, 13,
14.
.

III. In the Unity of the Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance,
power, and eternity; God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost 1 Ioh.
5. 7. Mat. 3. 16, 17 Mat 28. 19. 2 Cor. 13 14
. The Father is of none, neither begotten, nor proceeding: The son is eternally
begotten of the Father Ioh. 1. 14, 18.
: The Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son Ioh* 1. 15,
26. Gal. 4. 6.
.

CHAP. III. Of Gods eternal Decree.
GOD from all eternity did, by the most wise and holy Counsel of his own Will,
freely, and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass Ephesians. 1. 11 Romans 11.
33. Heb. 6. 17. Rom 9 15, 18.
: yet so, as thereby neither is God the Author of sin Iam. 1. 13. 17. 1 Ioh 1. 5
, nor is violence offered to the will of the Creatures, nor is the Liberty or
contingency of second Causes taken away, but rather established Acts 2. 23 Mat.
17, 12. Act. 4. 27, 28 Job 19. 11. Pro. 16. 33.
.

II. Although God knows whatsoever may, or can come to pass upon all supposed
conditions Act. 15. 18. 1 Samuel 23. 11 12. Mat. 11. 21, 23.
, yet has he not decreed any thing because he foresaw it as future, or as that
which would come to pass upon such conditions Rom 9. 11, 13, 16. 18.
.

III. By the decree of God, for the manifestation of his Glory, some men and
Angels 1 Timothy 5. 21. Mat. 25. 41.
are predestined unto everlasting life, and others foreordained to
everlasting death Romans 9. 22 23. Ephesians 1 5, 6 Prove. 16. 4
.

IV. These Angels and men thus predestined and foreordained, are
particularly, and unchangeably, designed, and their number is so certain, and
definite, that it cannot be either increased, or diminished 2 Timothy 3 19. Ioh.
13 18.
.

V. Those of mankind that are predestined unto Life, God, before the
foundation of the world was laid according to his eternal and immutable
purpose, and the secret counsel* and good pleasure of his Will, has chosen,
in Christ, unto everlasting glory Ephesians. 1. 4, 9 11. Romans 8. 30 2 Timothy 1. 9 1
These. 5* 9
, out of his mere free grace and love, without any foresight of Faith, or good
works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature,
as conditions, or causes moving him thereunto Romans 9. 11 13 16. Ephesians. 1. 4, 9.
, and all to the praise of his glorious grace Ephesians. 1. 6. 12
.

VI. As God has appointed the Elect unto glory, so has he, by the eternal
and most free purpose of his Will, foreordained all the means thereunto 1
Pet. 1. 2 Ephesians 1. 4, 5* Ephesians. ^. 13
. Wherefore they who are elected, being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ
1 These. 5 9. 10. Tit. 2. 14
, are effectually called unto faith in Christ, by his Spirit working in due
season, are justified, adopted, sanctified Romans 8. 30 Ephesians. 1. 5 2 These. 2. 13
, and kept by his power through faith unto salvation 1 Pet. 1. 5
. Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified,
adopted, sanctified and saved, but the Elect only John 17. 9 Romans 8. 28 to the
end John 6. 64 65. John 10 26. John 8. 47. 1 Ioh. 2 19.
.

VII. The rest of mankind God was pleased, according to the unsearchable
counsel of his own Will, whereby he extends, or withholds mercy, as he
pleases, for the glory of his Sovereign Power over his creatures, to pass by:
and to Ordain them to dishonor and wrath, for their sin, to the praise of his
glorious justice Mat. 11. 25* 26. Romans 9. 17. 18, 21, 22. 2 Timothy 2. 19. 20 Jude
5 4. 1 Pet. 2. 8 Romans 9. 20. Romans 11. 33 Deuteronomy. 29. 29
.

VIII. The doctrine of this high Mystery of Predestination is to be handled
with special prudence and care s, that men attending the will of God revealed
in his Word, and yielding obedience thereunto, may, from the certainty of their
effectual Vocation, be assured of their eternal Election t. So shall this
Doctrine afford matter of praise, reverence, and admiration of God 2 Pet. 1. 10
^ Ephesians. 1. 6 Romans 11. 33
, and of humility, diligence, and abundant consolation to all that sincerely
obey the Gospel Romans 11 5, 6, 20. 2 Pet. 1. 10 Romans 8. 33 Luke 10. 2^
.

CHAP. IV. Of Creation.
IT pleased God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost Heb. 1. 2 John 1. 2 3 Genesis 1. 2
Job 26. 1^ Job 33. 4.
, for the manifestation of the glory of his eternal power, wisdom, and
goodness Romans 1. 20 Ier. 10. 12 Psalm. 104. 24 Psalm. 33. 5* 6
, in the beginning, to create, or make of nothing, the World, and all things
therein, whether visible or invisible, in the space of six days, and all very
good Genesis 1. ch Heb. 11. 13. Col. 1. 16. Acts 17. 24
.

II. After God had made all other Creatures, he created Man, male and female
Genesis 1. ^7
, with reasonable and immortal souls Genesis 27 with Eccle. 12. 7. and Luke 23.
43 and Mat. 10 28.
, endued with knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness, after his own
Image Genesis 1. 26 Col. 3. 10 Ephesians. 4. 24
, having the Law of God written in their hearts Romans 2. 14 15.
, and power to fulfill it Eccl. 7. 29
: and yet, under a possibility of transgressing, being left to the liberty of
their own will, which was subject unto change Genesis ^. 6. Eccles. 7. 29
: Beside this Law written in their hearts, they received a command, not to eat
of the tree of the Knowledge of good and evil which whiles they kept, they were
happy in their Communion with God Genesis 2. 27 Genesis 3. 8. 9, 10. 11, 23.
, and had Dominion over the creatures Genesis 1. 26, 28.
.

CHAP. V. Of Providence.
GOD the great Creator of all things, does uphold Heb. 1. 3
, direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, actions, and things Dan. 4. 34 35.
Psalm. 135. 6. Acts 17 25, 26, 28 Job 38, 39, 40, 41. chapters.
, from the greatest even to the least Mat. 10 29, 30, 31.
, by his most wise and holy Providence Prove. 15. 3 Psalm. 104. 24
, according to his infallible foreknowledge Acts 15. 18 Psalm. 94. 8, 9, 10, 11.
, and the free, and immutable counsel of his own Will Ephesians. 1. 1^ Ps. 33. 10, 11
, to the praise of the glory of His Wisdom, Power, Justice, Goodness, and
Mercy Isa. 63. 14 Ephesians. 3. 10. Romans 9. 17 Genesis 45. 7 Psalm. 145. 7
.

II. Although in relation to the foreknowledge and decree of God, the first
Cause, all things come to pass immutably, and infallibly Acts 2. 23
: yet, by the same Providence he orders them to fall our, according to the
nature of second causes, either necessarily, freely, or contingently Genesis 8. 22
Ier. 31. 35 Exodus 21. 13 with Deuteronomy. 19. 5. 1 Kings 22 28, 54. Isai. 10. 6, 7
.

III. God, in his ordinary Providence makes use of means Acts 27. 3^* 44.
Isai. 55. 11, 12. Hos. 2. 21, 22.
, yet is free to work without Hos. 1. 7 Mat. 4. 4 Job ^4. 10.
, above Romans 4. 19, 20, 21
, and against them at his pleasure 2 Kings 6. 6. Dan. 3. 27
.

IV. The Almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite goodness of God so
far manifest themselves in his Providence, that it extends it self even to
the first Fall, and all other sins of Angels and Men Romans 11. 32 33, 34 2 Samuel 24. 1 with 1 Chr. 21. 1. 1 King. 22. 22, 23 1 Chr. 10. 4, 13, 14. 1 Sa.
16. 10. Acts 2. 23. Acts 4. 27, 28.
, and that not by a bare permission Act. 13. 16
, but such as has joined with it a most wise and powerful bounding Psa 76. 10
2 Kings 19. 28.
, and otherwise ordering, and governing of them, in a manifold dispensation, to
his own holy ends Genesis 50. 20. Isa. 10. 6. 7, 12.
: yet so, as the sinfulness thereof proceeds only from the creature, and not
from God, who being most holy and righteous, neither is, nor can be the Author
or Approver of sin Iam. 1. 13, 14, 17. 1 Ioh. 2. 16 Psalm. 50 21
.

V. The most wise, righteous, and gracious GOD does oftentimes leave for a
season his own children to manifold temptations, and the corruption of their
own hearts, to chastise them for their former sins, or to discover unto them
the hidden strength of corruption, and deceitfulness of their hearts, that
they may be humbled 2 Chr. 32* 25, 36, 31 2 Samuel 24. 1.
: and, to raise them to a more close and constant dependence for their support
upon himself, and to make them more watchful against all furure occasions of
sin, and for sundry other just and holy ends 2 Cor. 12 7. 8, 9 Psalm. 73.
throughout Psalm. 77. 1, 10, 12 Mar. 14. 66 to the end, with John 21 15; 16, 17
.

VI. As for those wicked and ungodly men, whom GOD, as a righteous Judge, for
former sins does blind and harden Rom 1. 24 26, 28 Romans 1^, 7, 8
, from them he not only withholdeth his Grace, whereby they might have been
enlightened in their understandings, and wrought upon in their hearts Deuteronomy. 29. 4
: but sometimes also withdraws the gifts which they had Mat. 15. 12 Mat. 15.
29
, and exposes them to such objections as their corruption makes ocasions of
sin Deuteronomy. 2. 50 2 Kings 8. 12. 131
: and with all, gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the
world, and the power of Satan Ps. 81. 11, 12 2 These. 2: 10 11, 12
: whereby it comes to pass that they harden themselves, even under those
means which GOD uses for the softning of others Exodus 7: 3, with Exodus 8. 15,
32. 2 Cor. 1. 15, 16. Isa. 8. 14 2 Pet. 2. 7, 8 Isa. 6. 9, 10. with Acts 28.
26, 27.
.

VII. As the providence of GOD does in general, reach to all Creatures; so
after a most special manner, it takes care of his Church, and disposes all c
1 Timothy 4. 10 Amos 9 8 9. Romans 8. 28. Isa. 43. 3, 4, 5, 14.
things to the good thereof.

CHAP. VI. Of the Fall of Man, of Sin, and of the Punishment thereof.
Our first Parents being seduced by the subtilty and Temptation of Satan,
sinned in eating the forbidden fruit Genesis 3. 13. 2 Cor. 11. 3
. This their sin, God was pleased, according to his wise and holy counsel to
p^rmit, having purposed to order it to his own glory Romans 1^. 32.
.

II. By this sin they fell from their original righteousness and communion
with God Genesis 3. 6, 7 8. Eccles. 7. 29. Romans 3. 23.
, and so became dead in sin Genesis 2. 17 Ephesians 2. 1,
, and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts of soul and body Tit. 1.
15, Genesis 6. 5. Ier. 17. 9. Romans 3, 10, 10 19.
.

III. They being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed
Genesis 1. 27. 28, and Gen 2. 16, 17. and Acts 17 13. with Romans 5. 12, 15, 16, 17.
18, 19. and 1 Cor. 15 21, 22, 45
, and the same death in sin and corrupted nature, conveyed to all their
posterity descending from them by ordinary generation Psalm. 51. 5 Genesis 5. 3.
Job 14. 4. Job 15. 14.
.

IV. From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed,
disabled, and made opposite to all good Romans 5. 6. Rom 8. 7. Romans 7. 18. Col.
1. 21:
, and wholly inclined to all evil Gen 6. 5. Gen, 8 21. Rom 3. 10, 11, 12.
, do proceed all actual transgressions Iam. 1. 14, 15. Ephesians. 2. 2, 3. Mat. 15.
19
.

V. This corruption of nature during this life, does remain in those that are
regenerated 1 Ioh, 1. 8, 10. Rom, 7. 14, 17, 18, 23. Iam. 3: 2 Prove. 20. 9.
Eccles. 7. 20
: and, although it be, through Christ, pardoned, and mortified, yet both it
self, and all the motions thereof are truly and properly sin Rom 7. 5, 7, 8,
25. Gal. 5. 17.
.

VI. Every sin, both Original and Actual, being a transgression of the
righteous Law of God, and contrary thereunto John 3. 4
, does, in its own nature, bring guilt upon the sinner Romans 2. 15. Romans 3. 9,
19.
, whereby he is bound over to the wrath of God Ephesians. 2. 3.
, and curse of the Law Gal. 3. 10.
, and so made subject to death Romans 6. 23.
, with all miseries spiritual Ephesians. 4. 18.
, temporal Romans 8. 20. Iam. 3. 39.
, and eternal Mat. 25. 41. 2 These. 1. 9.
.

CHAP. VII. Of Gods Covenant with Man.
THe distance between God and the Creature is so great, that although
reasonable Creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet they could
never have any fruition of him as their Blessedness and Reward, but by some
voluntary condescension on Gods part, which he has been pleased to express by
way of Covenant Isaiah 40. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Job 9. 32, 33 1 Samuel 2. 25 Ps
113. 5, 6 Psalm. 100. 2, 3 Job 22 2, 3. Job 35. 7, 8 Luke 17. 10 Act 17. 24, 25.
.

II. The first Covenant made with Man, was a Covenant of Works Gal. 3. 12
, wherein Life was promised to Adam, and in him to his posterity Romans 10. 5 Rom
5. 12 to 20.
, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience Genesis 2. 17 Gal. 3. 10.
.

III. Man, by his Fall having made himself incapable of Life by that Covenant,
the Lord was pleased to make a Second Gal. 3 21* Romans 3. 20, 21. Gen 3. 15.
Isa. 42. 6
, commonly called the Covenant of Grace: Wherein he freely offers unto
sinners Life and Salvation by Jesus Christ, requiting of them Faith in Him that
they may be saved Mark. 16 15, 16. John 3. 16. Romans 10. 6, 9. Gal. 3. 11
, and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto Life, his holy
Spirit, to make them willing, and able to believe Ezekiel. 36. 26, 27. John 6. 44,
45.
.

IV. This Covenant of Grace is frequently set forth in the Scripture by the
name of a Testament, in reference to the death of Jesus Christ the Testator,
and to the everlasting Inheritance, with all things belonging to it, therein
bequeathed Heb. 9. 15 16, 17. Heb. 7. 22. Luke 22. 20. 1 Cor. 11. 25
.

V. This Covenant was differently administered in the time of the Law, and in
the time of the Gospel 2 Cor. 3. 6, 7, 8, 9.
: Under the Law, it was administered by Promises, Prophesies, Sacrifices,
Circumcision, the Paschal Lamb, and other Types and Ordinances delivered to the
people of the Jews, all fore-signifying Christ to come Heb. 8. 9 10 chapters.
Romans 4. 11 Col. 21. 1, 12 1 Cor. 5. 7
, which were for that time, sufficient and efficacious, through the operation
of the Spirit, to instruct and build up the Elect in Faith in the Promised
Messiah 1 Cor. 10 1. 2, 3, 4. Heb. 11. 13 John 8. 56
, by whom they had full remission of sins, and eternal Salvation: and is
called, the Old Testament Gal. 3. 7, 8, 9, 14.
.

VI. Under the Gospel, when Christ the substance Col. 2. 17
, was exhibited, the Ordinances in which this Covenant is dispensed, are the
Preaching of the Word, and the Administration of the Sacraments of Baptism, and
the Lords Supper Mat. 28 19, 30. 1 Cor. 14 23, 24, 25
. Which, though fewer in number, and administered with more simplicity, and
less outward glory, yet, in them, it is held forth in more fullness, evidence,
and spiritual efficacy Heb. 12 22. to 28 Ier. 31. 33, 34.
, to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles; Mat. 28. 19 Ephesians. 2. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
; and is called the New Testament Luke 22. 20
. There are not therefore Two Covenants of Grace, differing in substance, but
one and the same, under various dispensations Gal. 3. 4, 16. Romans 3 21, 22, 23,
30 Psalm. 32. 1 with Romans 4. 3, 6, 17, 23, 24. Heb. 13. 8. Act. 15. 11.
.

CHAP. VIII. Of Christ the Mediator.
IT pleased God, in his eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus,
His only begotten Son, to be the Mediator between God and Man Isa. 42. 1 1 Pet.
1. 19, 20. John 3. 16. 1 Timothy 2. 5
; the Prophet Acts 3. 22
, Priest Heb. 5, 5, 6
, and King Psalm. 2. 6 Luke 1. 33
, the Head, and Savior of his Church Ephesians. 5. 23
, the Heir of all things Heb. 1. 2
, and Judge of the World Acts 17. 31
: Unto whom He did from all eternity give a People, to be his Seed John 17. 6
Psalm* 22. 30 Isa. 53. 10
, and to be by him in time Redeemed, Called, Justified, Sanctified, and
Glorified 1 Timothy 2. 6 Isa. 55. 4, 5 1 Cor. 1. 30
.

II. The Son of God, the second Person in the Trinity, being very and eternal
God, of one Substance, and equal with the Father; did, when the fullness of
time was come, take upon Him man's nature John 1, 1, 14. 1 John 5. 20. Phil. 2.
6. Gal. 4. 4
, with all the Essential properties, and common infirmities thereof, yet,
without sin Heb. 1. 14, 16, 17. Heb. 4. 15
: being conceived by the Power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin
Mary, of her substance Luke 1. 27, 31, 35. Gal. 4. 4.
. So that, two whole, perfect, and distinct Natures, the Godhead and the
Manhood, were inseparably joined together in one Person, without Conversion,
Composition, or Confusion Luke 1. 35 Col. 2. 9 Romans 9. 5 1 Pet. 3. 18 1 Timothy 3.
16
. Which person, is very God, and very Man, yet one Christ, the only Mediator
between God and Man Romans 1. 3, 4 1 Timothy 2. 5
.

III. The Lord Jesus, in his humane nature thus united to the divine, was
sanctified and anointed with the holy Spirit, above measure Psalm. 45. 7 John 3.
34
, having in him all the treasures of Wisdom and knowledge Col. 2. 3
: in whom, it pleased the Father, that all fullness should dwell Col. 1. 19
: to the end, that being holy, harmless, undefiled, and full of grace and truth
Heb. 7. 16 John 1. 14
, he might be thoroughly furnished to execute the Office of a Mediator, and
surety Acts 10. ^8 Heb. 12. 24 Heb. 7. 22
. Which Office he took not unto himself, but was thereunto called by his Father
Heb. 5. 4, 5
, who put all power and judgment into his hand, and gave him commandment to
execute the same Ioh. 5. 22, 27. Mat. 28 18 Act. 2. 36
.

IV. This Office, the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake Psalm. 40. 7, 8.
with Heb. 10. 5. to 11 John 10. 18 Phil. 2. 8
: which that he might discharge, he was made under the Law Gal. 4. 4.
, and did perfectly fulfill it Mat. 3. 15 Mat. 5. 17
, endured most grievous torments immediately in his Soul Mat. 26. 37 38. Luke 22
44. Mat. 27 46. Mat. 26. 27 chapters.
, and most painful sufferings in his body b: was crucified and died Phil. 28.
: was buried, and remained under the power of death; yet saw no corruption Act.
2. 23, 24, 27. Act. 13. 37. Romans 6. 9.
. On the third day he arose from the dead 1 Cor. 15. 3, 4.
, with the same body in which he suffered John 20. 25, 27.
, with which also he ascended into Heaven, and there sits at the right hand
of his Father Mark. 16 19.
, making intercession Romans 8. 34 Heb. 9. 24. Heb. 7. 25.
, and shall return to judge men, and Angels, at the end of the World Romans 14.
9, 10. Acts 1. 11. Acts 10. 42. Mat. 13. 40, 41, 42. Jude v. 6. 2 Pet. 2. 4
.

V. The Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience, and sacrifice of himself, which
he, through the eternal Spirit, once offered up unto God, has fully satisfied
the justice of his Father Romans 5. Heb. 9. 14. 16. Heb. 10. 1, 4. Ephesians. 5. 2 Romans
3. 25, 26.
, and purchased not only reconciliation, but an everlasting inheritance in the
Kingdom of Heaven, for all those whom the Father has given unto him Dan 9.
^4, 26. Col. 1. 19, 20. Ephesians, 1. 11, 14. John 17. 2. Heb. 9. 12, 15.
.

VI. Although the work of Redemption was not actually wrought by Christ till
after his Incarnation; yet the virtue, efficacy, and benefits thereof were
communicated unto the Elect in all ages successively from the beginning of the
world, in, and by those promises, types, and sacrifices, wherein he was
revealed, and signified to be the seed of the Woman which should bruise the
Serpents head; and the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world: being
yesterday, and to day the same, and for ever Gal, 14, 5. Genesis 3. 15. Rev. 13.
8. Heb. 13. 8.
.

VII. Christ, in the work of Mediation, acts according to both Natures, by
each Nature doing that which is proper to it self Heb. 9. 14. 1 Pet. ^. 18.
: yet, by reason of the unity of the Person, that which is proper to one
Nature, is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the Person denominated by the
other Nature Acts 20. 25 Ioh 3. 1 ^ Ioh. 3. 16.
.

VIII. To all those for whom Christ has purchased Redemption, he does
certainly, and estectually apply, and communicate the same Ioh. 6. 3^, 39. Ioh.
^0. 15, 16.
, making intercession for them 1 Ioh. 2, 1. 2 Rom 8. 34
, and revealing unto them, in, and by the Word, the mysteries of salvation Ioh.
15 13 15. Ephesians. 1. 7, 8, 9. John 17. 6.
, effectually persuading them by his Spirit, to believe, and obey, and
governing their hearts by his Word and Spirit John 14. 16. Heb. 12 2. 2 Cor. 4.
13. Romans 8. 9. 14. Romans 15. 18, 19. Ioh. 17. 17.
, overcoming all their enemies by his Almighty Power and Wisdom, in such
manner, and ways, as are most consonant to his wonderful and unsearchable
dispensation Psalm. 110. 1 1 Cor. 15. 25, 26. Mal. 4. 2, 3. Col. 2. 15.
.

CHAP. IX. Of Free Will.
GOD has endued the Will of man with that natural liberty, that is neither
forced, nor by any absolute necessity of nature determined to do good or ev^^
Mat. 17. 12. Iam. 1. 14. Deuteronomy. 30. 19
.

II. Man, in his state of Innocence, had freedom, and power, to will, and to do
that which was good, and well-pleasing to God Eccles. 7 29. Genesis 1 26.
; but yet, mutably, so that he might fall from it Genesis 2. 16, 17. Genesis 3. 6
.

III. Man by his fall in^o a state of sin, has wholly lost all ability of Will
to any spiritual good accompanying salvation Romans 5. 6 Romans 8. 7 John 15. 5
: so as, a natural man, being altogether averse from that good Romans 3. ^0 12.
, and dead in sin Ephesians. 2. 1. 5 Col. 2. 13
, is not able, by his own strength, to convert himself, or to prepare himself
thereunto Ioh. 6. 44, 65. Ephesians 2 ^* 2. 3. 4, 5. 1 Cor. 8. 14 Titus 3. 3, 4, 5.
.

IV. When God converts a sinner, and tanslates him into the state of grace; he
freeth him from his natural bondage under sin Col. 1. 13 Ioh. 8. 34, 36
; and by his grace alone, inables him freely to will, and to do that which is
spiritually good Phil. 2. 13 Romans 6. 18, 22.
; yet so, as that by reason of his remaining corruption, he does not perfectly,
nor only, will that which is good, but does also will that which is evil Gal.
5. 17 Romans 7. 15, 19, 21,
.

V. The will of man is made perfectly, and immutably free to good alone, in the
state of Glory only Ephesians. 4. 13 Heb. 12. 23 ^1 John 3. 2 Jude v. 24
.

CHAP. X. Of Effectual Calling.
ALL those whom God has predestined unto life, and those only, he is pleased
in his appointed and accepted time, effectually to call Romans 8. 30 Romans 11. 7
Ephesians. 1. 10, 11
, by his Word and Spirit 2 These. 2 13, 14. 2 Cor 33. 6
, out of that state of sin and death, in which they are by nature, to grace and
salvation by Jesus Christ Rom 8. 3 Ephesians 2. 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 2 Timothy 1 9 10
; enlightening their minds, spiritually and savingly to understand the things
of God Acts 26. 18 1 Cor. 10. 12 Ephesians. 1. 17, 18
; taking away their heart of stone, and giving unto them an heart of flesh
Ezekiel. 36. 27
: renewing their wills, and by his Almighty power determining them to that
which is good Ezekiel. 11. 19 Phil. 2. 13 Deuteronomy. 30. 6 Ezekiel. 36. 27
, and effectually drawing them to Jesus Christ Ephesians 1. 19 Ioh. 6. 44, 45
: yet so, as they come most freely, being made willing by his grace Cant. 1. 4
Psalm. 110. 3 John 6. 37 Romans 6. 16, 17, 18.
.

II. This effectual Call is of Gods free, and special grace alone, not from
any thing at all foreseen in man 2 Timothy 1. 9 Tit. 3. 4 5. Ephesians. 2. 4, 5, 8 9.
Romans 9. 11
, who is altogether passive therein, until being quickened and renewed by the
holy Spirit 1 Cor. 2. 14 Romans 8. 7 Ephesians. 2. 5
, he is thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace offered,
and conveyed in it Ioh. 6. 37 Ezekiel 36. 27 Romans 8. 9 Ioh 5. 25
.

III. Elect infants dying in infancy, are regenerated, and saved by Christ,
through the Spirit Luke 18 15. 16. and Act. 2. 38, 39 and John 3 3. 5. and 1
John 5. 12 compared,
; who works when, and where, and how he pleases John 3. 8
: So also are all other elect persons who are incapable of being outwardly
called by the Ministry of the Word 1 John 5 12. Acts 4 12.
.

IV. Others, not elected, although they may be called by the Ministry of the
Word Mat. 22. 14
, and may have some common operations of the Spirit Mat. 7. 22 Mat. 13. 20 21.
Heb. 6 4. 5.
, yet they never truly come unto Christ, and therefore cannot be saved Ioh. 6.
64, 65, 66. Ioh. 8. 24
: much less can men, not professing the Christian Religion, be saved in any
other way whatsoever, be they never so diligent to frame their lives according
to the light of Nature, and the Law of that Religion they do profess Acts 4.
12 John 14. 6 Ephesians. 2. 12 John 4. 22 John 17. 3
. And, to assert and maintain, that they may, is very pernicious, and to be
detested 2 Ioh. v. 9 10, 11 1 Cor. 16. ^^. Gal. 1. 6, 7, 8.
.

CHAP. XI. Of Justification.
THose whom God effectually calls, he also freely justifies Romans 8. 30 Romans
3. 24
: not, by infusing righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, and
by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous; not, for any thing
wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ's sake alone; nor by imputing
faith it self, the act of believing, or any other Evangelicall obedience, to
them, as their righteousness; but by imputing the obedience and satisfaction
of Christ unto them Romans 4. 5, 6, 7. 8 2 Cor. 5. 19 21. Romans 3 22, 24, 25 27,
28 Titus 3. 5, 7 Ephesians. 1. 7. Ier. 23, 6. 1 Cor. 1. 30, 31 Romans 5. 17 18, 19
, they receiving, and resting on him and his righteousness by faith, which
faith, they have, not of themselves, it is the gift of God Acts 10 44. Gal. 2
16. Phil. 3. 9 Act. 13. 38, 39 Ephesians. 2. 7, 8
.

II. Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, is the
alone instrument of Justification John 1. 12 Rom 3. 28 Romans 5. 1
; yet is it not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all
other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but works by Love Iam. 2. 17 22,
26 Gal. 5. 6
.

III. Christ by his obedience, and death, did fully discharge the debt of all
those that are thus justified, and did make a proper, real, and full
satisfaction to his Fathers Justice in their behalf ^om. 5. 8, 9, 10, 19 1 Timothy
2. 5, 6 Heb. 10. 10, 14. Dan. 9 24. 26. Isa. 53. 4, 5, 6. 10 11, 12
. Yet, in as much as he was given by the Father, for them Romans 8. 32
; and, his obedience and satisfaction accepted in their stead 2 Cor. 5. 21 Mat.
3. 17 Ephesians. 5. 2
; and, both, freely, not for any thing in them; their justification is only of
free grace Romans 3. 24 Ephesians. 1. 7
, that, both the exact justice, and rich grace of God, might be glorified in
the Justification of sinners Romans 3. 26 Ephesians. 2. 7
.

IV. God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect Gal. 3. 8 1
Pet. 1. 2 19, 20 Romans 8. 30
, and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again
for their justification Gal. 4. 4 1 Timothy 2. 6 Romans 4. 25
: nevertheless, they are not justified, until the holy Spirit does in due
time, actually apply Christ unto them Col. 1. 21, 22. Gal. 2 16. Tit. 3. 4, 5,
6, 7.
.

V. God does continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified Mat. 6.
12 1 John 1. 7. 9 1 Ioh. 2. 1 2
: and, although they can never fall from the state of justification; yet, they
may by their sins, fall under Gods fatherly displeasure, Iuke 22 32. John 10
28. Heb 10 14.
and not have the l^ght of his countenance restored unto them, until they
humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and
repentance Psalm. 89. 31 32. 33 Psalm. 51. 7, 8 9, 10, 11, 12 Psalm. 32. 5 Mat.
26. 7^ 1 Cor. 11. 30 32. Luke 1. 20
.

VI. The justification of Believers under the Old Testament, was, in all these
respects, one and the same with the justification of Believers under the New
Testament Gal. 3. 9 13, 14. Romans 4. 22, 23, 24 Heb. 13. 8
.

CHAP. XII. Of Adoption.
ALl those that are justified, God vouchsafes, in, and for his only Son
Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of Adoption Ephesians. 1. 5
: by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and
privileges of the children of God Gal. 4. 4^* Romans 8. 17 John 1. 12
, have his Name put upon them Ier. 14 9 2 Cor. ^. 18 Rev. 3. 12
, receive the spirit of Adoption Romans 8. 15
, have access to the Throne of Grace with boldness Ephesians. 3. 12 Romans 5. 2
, are enabled to cry Abba, Father Gal 4. 6
, are pitied Psa. 103. 13
, protected Prove. 14. 16 Mat 6. 30 32 1 Pet. 5. 7
provided for i, and chastened, by him, as by a Father Heb. 12. 6
: yet never cast off Lam. 3. 31
, but sealed to the day of redemption Ephesians. 4. 20
, and inherit the promises as heirs of everlasting salvation 1 Pet. 1, 3, 4.
Heb. 1. 14
. n Heb. 6. 12


CHAP. XIII. Of Sanctification.
THey who are effectually called, and Regenerated, having a new heart, and a
new spirit created in them; are further sanctified really and personally,
through the virtue of Christ's death and resurrection 1 Cor. 6. 11 Acts 20. 32
Phil. 3. 1^. Romans 6. 5, 6
, by his Word, and Spirit dwelling in them John 17 17 Ephesians. 5. 26 2 These. 2. 13
: the domininion of the whole body of sin is destroyed Romans 6. 6 14.
, and the several lusts thereof are more and more weakened and mortified Gal.
5. 24 Romans 8. 13
: and they, more and more quickened and strengthened in all saving graces Col 1.
11 Ephesians 3. 16, 17, 18, 19
, to the practice of true holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord 2
Cor. 7. 1 Heb. 12. 14
.

II. This Sanctification is throughout, in the whole man 1 These. 5 2^.
; yet imperfect in this life, there abides still some remnants of corruption
in every part 1 Ioh 1. 10 Romans 7. 18 23. Phil. 5. 12
: whence arises a continual, and irreconcilable war; the flesh lusting
against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh Gal. 5, 17 1 Pet. 2. 11
.

III. In which war, although the remaining corruption, for a time, may much
prevail Romans 7. 23
; yet through the continual supply of strength from the sanctifying Spirit of
Christ, the regenerate partdoth overcome Romans 6 14 1 John 5. 4 Ephesians. 4. 15, 16
: and so, the Saints grow in grace 2 Pet. 3 18 2 Cor 3 18
, perfecting holiness in the fear of God 2 Cor. 7. 1
.

CHAP. XIV. Of Saving Faith.
THe grace of Faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to the saving of
their souls Heb. 10. 39
, is the Work of the Spirit of Christ in their hearts 2 Cor. 4. 13 Ephesians 1. 1^,
18. 19 Ephesians. 2. 8
; and is ordinarily wrought by the Ministry of the Word Romans 1^ 14. 17
: by which also, and by the administration of the Sacraments, and Prayer, it is
increased and streng^hened 1 Pet. 2. 2 Acts 20. 32 Romans 4. 11 Luke 17. 5 Rom 1.
16, 17.
.

II. By this Faith, a Christian believes to be true, whatsover is revealed in
the Word, for the authority of God himself speaking therein John 4. 42 1 These.
2. 13 1 John 5. 10 Acts 24. 14
; and, acting differently upon that which each particular passage thereof
contains; yielding obedience to the Commands Rom 16. 26
; trembling at the threatenings Isa 60. 2
, and embracing the promises of God for this life, and that which is to come
Heb* 11. 13 1 Timothy 4. 8
. But the principal acts of saving faith, are, Accepting, Receiving, and
Resting upon Christ alone for Justification, Sanctification, and Eternal life,
by virtue of the Covenant of Grace John 1. 10 Acts 16. 31 Gal. 2. 29 Acts 15. ^1
.

III. This faith is different in degrees, weak, or strong Heb. 5. 13 14. Romans 4
19, 20 Mat. 6 30 Mat. 8. 10
; may be often and many ways assailed, and weakened, but gets the victory Luke
22. 31, 32. Ephesians. 6. 16 1 Ioh. 5. 4, 5
; growing up in many to the attainment of a full assurance through Christ Heb.
6. 11, 12. Heb. 10 22. Col. 2. 2
, who is both the Author and finisher of our faith Heb. 12. 2
.

CHAP. XV. Of Repentance unto life.
REpentance unto life, is an evangel^call grace Zec. 12. 10 Acts 11. 18
, the Doctrine whereof is to be preached by every Minister of the Gospel, as
well as that of faith in Christ Luke 24 47. Mark. 1 15. Acts 20 21.
.

II. By it, a sinner, out of the sight and sense, not only of the danger, but
also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins, as contrary to the holy
nature, and righteous Law of God; and, upon the apprehension of his mercy in
Christ to such as are penitent, so grieves for, and hates his sins, as to turn
from them all unto God Eze. 18. 30, 31. Eze. 36. 31 Isa. 30. 22 Psalm. 51. 4 Ier
31. 18. 19 Joel 2. 12, 13 Amos 5. 15 Psalm. 119. 128 2 Cor. 7. 11
, purposing and endeavour^ng to walk with him in all the ways of his
Commandments Psalm. 119 6, 59, 106 Luke 1. 6 2 Kin 23. 25
.

III. Although Repentance be not to be rested in, as any satisfaction for sin,
or any cause of the pardon thereof Eze. 36, 31, 32. Eze. 16, 61 62, 63
, which is the act of Gods free grace in Christ Hos. 14. 2 4 Romans 3. 24 Ephesians.
1. 7
yet is it of such necessity to all sinners, that none may expect pardon
without it Luke 13 ^, 5. Acts 17* 30, 31 Romans 5. 21
.

IV. As there is no sin so small, but it deserves damnation Romans 6. 23 Mat. 12.
36
; so there is no sin so great, that it can bring damnation upon those who truly
repent Isa. 5^. 7 Romans 8, 1 Isa: 1. 16, ^^
.

V. Men ought not to content themselves with a general repentance, but it is
every man's duty to endeavor to repent of his particular sins, particularly
Psalm. 19, 13 Luke 19. 8 1 Timothy 1, 13 15
.

VI. As every man is bound to make private confession of his sins to God,
praying for the pardon thereof Psalm. 51. 4, 5, 7, 9, 14 Psalm. 32. 5, 6
; upon which, and the forsaking of them, he shall find mercy Pro. 28. 13 1
John 1. 9
: so he that scandalizeth his Brother, or the Church of Christ, ought to be
willing by a private or public confession, and sorrow for his sin, to
declare his repentance to those that are offended Iam. 5. 16 Luk 17. 3. 4 Josh.
7. 19 Psalm. 51 throughout.
, who are thereupon to be reconciled to him, and in love to receive him ^ Cor.
2. ^
.

CHAP. XVI. Of Good Works.
GOod Works are only such as God has commanded in his holy Word Micah. 6. 8
Romans 12 2 Heb 13. 21
, and not such as, without the warrant thereof, are devised by men, out of
blind zeal, or upon any pretense of good intention Mat. 15. 9 Isa. 29. 13 1
Pet. 1. 18 Romans 10 2 John 16. 2 1 Samuel 15. 21 22, 23
.

II. These good works, done in obedience to Gods Commandments, are the fruits
and evidences of a true and lively faith Iam. 2. 18 22.
: and, by them believers manifest their thankfulness Psalm. 1 16 12, 13 1 Pet.
2. 9
, strengthen their assurance 1 John 2 3. 5 2 Pet. 1 5, 6, 7 8, 9. 10
, edify their Brethren 2 Cor. 9. 2 Mat. 5, 16
, adorn the profession of the Gospel Tit. 2. 5, 9 10, 11* 12. 2 Timothy 6. 1
, stop the mouths of the adversaries 1 Pet. 2. 15
, and glorify God 1 Pet. 2. 12 Phil. 1. 11 John 15. 8
, whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto Ephesians. 2. 10
; that, having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end, eternal life
Rom 6. 22
.

III. Their ability to do good works, is not at all of themselves, but wholly
from the Spirit of Christ John 15 4. 5 Ezekiel. 36. 26* 27
. And that they may be enabled thereunto, besides the graces they have already
received, there is required an actual influence of the same holy Spirit, to
work in them to will and to do, of his good pleasure Phil 2. 15. Phil. 4 13 2
Cor. 3. 5
: yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to
perform any duty, unless, upon a special motion of the Spirit; but, they
ought to be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them Phil. 2.
12 Heb. 6. 11, 12 2 Pet. 1 3, 5, 10, 11. Isa. 64. 7 2 Timothy 1 6 Acts 26. 6, 7.
Jude v. 20. 21
.

IV. They, who in their obedience, attain to the greatest height, which is
possible in this life, are so far from being able to supererogate, and to do
more then God requires, as that they fall short of much which in duty they are
bound to do Luk 17. 10 Neh. 13. 22 Job 9 2, 3 Gal. 5. 17
.

V. We cannot, by our best Works merit pardon of sin, or eternal life at the
hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between them and the
glory to come; and, the infinite distance that is between us and God, whom, by
them, we can neither profit, nor satisfy for the debt of our former sins Romans
3. 20 Romans 4. 2. 4, 6 Ephesians 2, 8 9 Tit. 3. 5, 6, 7 Romans 8, 18 Psalm. 16 2 Job 22,
2*3 Job 35. 7, 8
, but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are
unprofitable servants Luke 17. 10
; and, because, as they are good, they proceed from his Spirit Gal. 5. 22, 23
; and as they are wrought by us, they are defiled, and mixed with so much
weakness and imperfection, that they cannot endure the severity of Gods
judgment Isa. 64. 6. Gal. 5. 17 Rom 7. 15* 18. Psalm. 143, 2. Psalm. 130. 3
.

VI. Yet notwithstanding the Persons of Believers being accepted through Christ
their good works also are accepted in him Ephesians. 1. 6 1 Pet 2. 5 Exodus 28. 38 Genesis
4. 4 with Heb. 14.
, not as though they were in this life wholly unblamable and unreproveable in
GODS sight Job 9. 20 Psalm 143. 2
; but that, he looking upon them in his Son, is pleased to accept, and reward
that which is sincere, although accompanied with many weaknesses and
imperfections Heb. 13. 20 21. 2 Cor. 18 12. Heb. 16 10. Mat. 25 21, 23
.

VII. Works done by unregenerate men, although, for the matter of them, they
may be things which God commands, and of good use, both to themselves, and
others 2 Kings 20. 30, 31 1 Kings 21 27. 29 Phil. 1. 15, 16, 18
: yet, because they proceed not from an heart purified by faith Genesis 4. 5 with
Heb. 11 4. Heb. 11. 6
; nor are done in a right manner, according to the Word 1 Cor. 13 3 Isa. 1. 12
; nor, to a right end, the glory of God Mat. 6. 2, 5, 16.
; they are therefore sinful, and cannot please God, or make a man meet to
receive grace from God Hag. 2. 14 Tit. 1. 15. Amos 5. 21, 22. Hos 1. 4. Romans 9.
16. Titus 3. 5.
. And yet their neglect of them is more sinful, and displeasing unto God Psalm.
14. 4. Psalm. 36. Job 21. 14. 15. Mat. 25. 41, 42, 43, 45. Mat. 23. 23.
.

CHAP. XVII. Of the Perseverance of the Saints.
THey whom God has accepted in his Beloved, effectually called, and sanctified
by his Spirit, can neither totally, nor finally, fell away from the stare of
Grace: but shall certainly persevere therein to the end, and be eternally saved
Phil. 1. 6 2 Pet. 1. 10 John 10 28, 29. 1 John 3. 9. 1 Pet. 1. 5. 9
.

II. This perseverance of the Saints depends not upon their own free will, but
upon the immutability of the Decree of Election flowing from the free and
unchangable love of God the Father 2 Timothy 2. 28, 19, Ier. 31. 3.
; upon the efficacy of the merit, and intercession of Jesus Christ Heb. 10. 10,
14. Heb. 13, 20, 21. Heb. 9. 12, 13, 14, 15 Romans 8. 33, to the end. Ioh. 17.
11, 24. Lu. 22. 32 Heb. 7. 25.
; the abiding of the Spirit, and of the seed of God within them John 14. 16,
17. 1 Ioh. 2. 27. 1 John 3. 9.
; and the nature of the Covenant of Grace Ier. 32. 40.
: from all which arises also the certainty, and infallibility thereof Ioh. 10.
28 2 These 3. 3. 1 Ioh. 2. 19.
.

III Nevertheless, they may through the temptations of Satan, and of the
World, the prevalency of corruption remaining in them, and the neglect of the
means of their preservation, fall into grievous sins Mat. 26. 70, 72, 74.
: and, for a time, continue therein Psalm. 51, title and verse 14. 1 Isa. 64. 1,
7, 9. 2 Samuel 11. 27
: whereby they incur Gods displeasure i, and grieve his holy Spirit Ephesians. 4. 30.
, come to be deprived of some measure of their graces and comforts Psalm 51. 8,
10. 12. Rev. 2. 4. Cant 5. 23, 4. 6.
, have their hearts hardened Isa. 36. 17. Mark 6. 52. Mark 16. 14.
, and their consciences wounded Isal. 32 3. 4. Psalm. 51. 8.
, hurt, and scandalize others 2 Samuel* 12. 14.
, and bring temporal judgments upon themselves Psalm. 89. 31 32. 1 Cor 11. 31.
.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the assurance of Grace and Salvation.
ALthough hypoctites and other unregenerate men may vainly deceive themselves
with false hopes, and carnal presumptions of being in the favor of God, and
estate of Salvation Job 8 13 14. Mich. 3 11 Deuteronomy. 29 19. John 8 41.
: which hope of theirs shall perish Mat. 7. 22, 23.
: yet such as truly believe in the Lord Jesus, and love him in sincerity,
endeavoring to walk in all good conscience before him, may, in this life, be
certainly assured that they are in the state of grace 1 Ioh. 2. 3 1 Ioh. 3. 14,
18, 19, 22, 24 1 Ioh 5. 13.
, and may rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, which hope shall never make
them ashamed Romans 5. 2, 5
.

II. This certainty is not a bare conjecturall and probable persuasion,
grounded upon a fallible hope Heb. 6. 11, 19.
: but, an infallible assurance of faith, founded, upon the divine truth of the
promises of salvation Heb. 6. 17, 18.
, the inward evidence of those graces unto which these promises are made 2 Pet.
1. 4, 5, 10, 11. 1 Ioh. 2. 3. 1 Ioh 3. 14 2 Cor. 1. 12
, the testimony of the Spirit of Adoption witnessing with our spirits that we
are the children of God Romans 8. 15, 16
: which Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance, whereby we are sealed to the
day of redemption Ephesians. 3. 13, 14. Ephesians. 4. 30. 2. Cor. 1. 21. 22.
.

III. This infallible assurance does not so belong to the essence of faith, but
that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties before
he be partaker of it 1 John 5. 13. Isa. 50. 10 Mark 9. 24. Psalm 8^. throughout
Psalm 77. to verse 12.
: yet, being enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given
him of God, he may, without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of
ordinary means, attain thereunto 1 Cor 2. 12 1 Ioh. 4. 13 He 6. 11, 12 Ephesians. 3.
17, 18, 19.
. And therefore it is the duty of every one to give all diligence to make his
calling and election sure 2 Pet. 1. 10.
: that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the holy Ghost, in
love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulnes in the duties of
obedience, the proper fruits of this assurance Romans 5. 1, 1, 2, 5. Romans 14. 7.
To. 15. 3. Ephesians. 1. 3. 4 Psalm. 4. 6, 7 Psalm. 119. 32
: so far is it, from inclining men to loosnesse 1 Ioh. 2. 1, 2 Romans 6. 1, 2.
Tit. 2. 11, 12, 14. 2 Cor. 7. 1. Romans 8. 1, 12 1 John 3. 2. 3 Psalm. 1 30. 4. 1
John 1. 6, 7.
.

IV. True believers may have the assurance of their salvation diverse ways
shaken, diminished, and intermitted, as, by negligence in preserving of it, by
falling into some special sin, which wounds the conscience, and grieveth the
spirit: by, some sudden, or vehement temptation, by Gods withdrawing the light
of his countenance, and suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness,
and to have no light Can. 5. 2, 3, 6 Ps. 5. 1 6, 12, 14. Ephesians. 4. 30, 31. Psa.
^^, 1, to 10. Mat. 26. 69, 70, 71, 72. Psalm. 31. 22. Psalm, 88. throughout Esa.
5. 10.
: yet are they never utterly destitute of that seed of God, and life of faith,
that love of Christ and the brethren, that sincerity of heart, and conscience
of duty, out of which, by the operation of the Spirit, this assurance may, in
due time, be revived 1 Ioh. 3. 9 Luke 22. 32 Job 13. 15 Psaim 73. 15 Psalm. 51.
8, 12
: and by the which, in the mean time, they are supported from utter despair
Mich. ^. 7, 8, 9. Ier. 52. 40. Isa. 54. 7, 8, 9, 10. Psalm 22. 1. Psalm 88.
throughout.
.

CHAP. XIX. Of the Law of God.
GOD gave to Adam a Law, as a Covenant of Works, by which he bound him, and all
his posterity, to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience: promised
life upon the fulfilling, and threatened death upon the breach of it: and
endued him with power and ability to keep it Genesis 1. 26, 27 with Genesis 2. 17*
Rom 2 14, 15 Romans 10. 5 Romans 5. 12. 19. Gal. 3 10, 12. Eccles. 7. 29 Job 28. 20
.

II. This Law, after his fall, continued to be a perfect rule of
righteousness, and, as such, was delivered by God upon Mount Sinai, in Ten
Commandments, and written in two Tables Iam. 1. 25 Iam 2. 8, 10, 11, 12. Romans
13. 8, 9 Deuteronomy. 5. 32 Deuteronomy. 10. 4 Exodus 34. 1
: the four first Commandments containing our duty toward God, and the other
six, our duty to man Mat. 22 37 38, 39, 40.
,

III. Beside this Law, commonly called Moral, God was pleased to give to the
people of Israel, as a Church under age, Ceremonial Laws, containing several
typical Ordinances; partly of Worship, prefiguring Christ, his graces,
actions, sufferings, and benefits Heb* 9. chap Heb. 10. 1 Gal. 4. 1, 2, 3. Col.
2. 17.
; and partly, holding forth diverse instructions of moral duties 1 Cor. 5. 7 2
Cor. 6. 17 Jude ver. 23
. All which Ceremonial Laws are now abrogated, under the new Testament Col. 2.
14, 16, 17. Dan. 9. 27 E^h. 2. 15, 16.
.

IV. To them also, as a body Politic, he gave sundry Judicial Laws, which
expired together with the State of that people: not obliging any other now,
further than the general equity thereof may require Exodus 21 Chapter. Exodus
22. 1 to 29: Gen 49. 10 with 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14 Mat. 5. 17 with ver. 38, 39. 1
Cor. 9. 8, 9, 10.
.

V. The Moral Law does for ever bind all, as well justified persons as others,
to the obedience thereof Romans 13. 8, 9, 10. Ephesians. 6. 2 1 John 2. 3, 4, 7, 8
: and that, not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also in
respect of the authority of God the Creator, who gave it Iam. 2. 10. 1^
. Neither does Christ in the Gospel, any way dissolve, but much strengthen
this obligation Mat. 5. 17 18, 19. Iam. 2. 8. Rom: 3. 31.
.

VI. Although true Believers be not under the Law, as a Covenant of works, to
be thereby justified, or condemned Romans 6. 14 Gala. 2. 16 Gala. 3. 13 Gala. 4.
4, 5 Acts 13. 39 Romans 8. 1
: yet is it of great use to them, as well as to others, in that, as a rule of
life informing them of the will of God, and their duty, it directs, and binds
them to walk accordingly Romans 7 12, 22, 25. Psalm. 119. 4, 5, 6. 1 Cor. 7. 19
Gal. 5. 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
: discovering also the sinful pollutions of their nature, hearts and lives
Romans 7. 7 Romans 3. 20
: so as, examining themselves thereby, they may come to further conviction of
humiliation for, and hatred against sin Iam. 1. 23, 24, 25. Romans 7. 9, 14, 24.
: together with a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and the
perfection of his obedience Gal. 3. 24 Romans 7. 24 25. Romans 8 3. 4.
. It is likewise of use to the Regenerate, to restrain their corruptions, in
that it forbids sin Iam. 2. 11 Psalm. 119 101, 104, 28.
: and the threatenings of it serve to show, what, even their sins, deserve; and,
what afflictions, in this life, they may expect for them, although freed from
the curse thereof threatened in the Law Ezra 9. 13 14. Psalm. 89 30, 31, 32, 33,
34.
. The promises of it, in like manner, show them Gods approbarion of obedience,
and what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof Levit. 26. 1 to
14. with 2 Cor. 6. 16 Ephesians. 6. 2. 3 Psalm. 37. 11 with Mat. 5 5. Psalm. 19 11.
; although, not as due to them by the Law, as a Covenant of Works Gal. 2. 16
Luke 17. 10
. So as, a man's doing good, and refraining from evil, because the Law
encourages to the one, and deterreth from the other, is no evidence of his
being under the Law, and, not under grace Romans 6 12, 14. 1 Pet. 3. 8, 9, 10,
11, 12 with Psa. 34 12, 13 14, 15, 16 Heb. 12. 28, 29.
.

VII. Neither are the forementioned Uses of the Law contrary to the grace of
the Gospel, but do sweetly comply with it Gal. 3. 21
, the Spirit of Christ subduing, and inabling the will of man, to do that,
freely and cheerfully, which the will of God, revealed in the Law, requires to
be done Eze. 36. 27 Heb. 8. 10 with Ier. 31* 33.
.

CHAP. XX. Of Christian Liberty, and Liberty of Conscience.
THe Liberty which Christ has purchased for Believers, under the Gospel,
consists, in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning W^ath of God,
the Curse of the Moral Law Tit. 2. 14 1 These. 1. 10 Gal. 3. 13
; and, in their being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan,
and Dominion of sin Gal. 1. 4 Col. ^. 13 Acts 26. 18 Romans 6. ^4
; from the evil of afflictions, the sting of death, the victory of the grave,
and everlasting damnation Romans 8. 28 Psalm. 119. 71 1 Cor. 15. 55, 55, 56. 57
Romans 8. 1
; as also, in their free access to God Romans 5, 1, 2
, and their yielding obedience unto him, not out of slavish fear, but a child
like love and willing mind Romans 8, 14, 15, 1 John 4 18.
. All which, were common also to Believers under the Law Gal. 3. 9, 14.
. But under the New Testament, the liberty of Christians is further enlarged,
in their freedom from the yoke of the Ceremonial Law, to which the Jewish
Church was subjected Gal. 4. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 Gal. 5. 1 Acts 15. 10, 11.
: and in greater boldness of access to the Throne of Grace Heb. 4. 14 16.
Heb. 10 19, 20. 21, 22
, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of God, than Believers, under
the Law, did ordinarily partake of 1 John 7 38, 39 2 Cor. 3. 13, 17, 19
.

II. God alone is Lord of the Conscience Iam. 4. 12 Romans 14. 4.
, and has left it free from the Doctrines and Commandments of men, which are,
in any thing contrary to his Word: or beside it, if matters of Faith, or
Worship Acts 4. 19 Acts 5. 29 1 Cor. 7. 25 Mat* 23. 8. 9 10. 2 Cor. 1 24. Mat.
15. 9
. So tha^, to believe such Doctrines, or to obey such commands, out of
conscience, is to betray true liberty of conscience Col. 2. 20 22. 23. Gal. 1
10. Gal. 2. 14 5. Psalm. 5. 1
: and the requiring of an implicit faith, and an absolute and blind obedience,
is, to destroy l^berty of conscience, and reason also Romans 10 17. Rom 14 23
Isa. 8. 20 Acts 17. 11 John 4. ^^ Hos. 5. 11 Revel. 13. ^^. 16, 17 Ier. 8. 9
.

III. They, who, upon pretense of Christian Liberty, do practice any sin, or
cherish any lust, do thereby destroy the end of Christian Liberty, which is,
that being delivered out of the hands of our Enemies, we might serve the Lord
without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our
life Gal. 5. 13 ^ Pet 2. 16 2 Pet. 2 19* John 8. 34 Luke 1. 74. 75.


IV. And because the Powers which God has ordained, and the Liberty which
Christ has purchased, are not intended by God, to destroy, but mutually to
uphold and preserve one another; They who upon pretense of Christian Liberty,
shall oppose any lawful Power, or the lawful exercise of it, whether it be
Civil or Ecclesiastical, resist the Ordinance of GOD Mat. 12. 25 1 Pet. 2. 13
14, 16 Romans 13. 1 10 8. Heb 13. 17.
. And, for their publishing of such Opinions, or maintaining of such Practices,
as are contrary to the light of Nature, or to the known Principles of
Christianity, whethe concerning Faith, Worship, or Conversation; or, to the
Power of Godliness; or, such erroneous Opinions or Practices, as either in
their own nature, or in the manner of publishing or maintaining them, are
destructive to the external Peace and Order which Christ has established in
the Church, they may lawfully be called to account, and proceeded against by
the Censures of the Church Romans 1. 32 with 1 Cor 5. 1, 5, 11, 13. 2 Iohnver.
10. 11. and 2 These. 3. 14. and 1 Timothy 6, 3, 4, 5. and Tit. 1. 10 11 13. and

CHAP. XXI. Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath Day,
THe light of Nature shows that there is a GOD, who has Lordship and
Sovereignty over all, is good, and does good unto all, and is therefore to be
feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in, and served, with all the
heart, and with all the soul, and the might Rom 1. 20 Acts 17. 24 Psalm. 119. 68
Ier. 10. 7 Psalm. 13. 23 Psalm 18. ^ Romans 10. 12 Psalm 6. 2. 8 Ios. 24. 14. Mark
12. 33
. But, the acceptable way of Worshipping the true GOD, is instituted by
Himself, and so limited by his own revealed Will, that he may not be worshipped
according to the imaginations and devices of men, or the suggestions of Satan,
under any visible representation, or any other way not prescribed in the holy
Scripture Deuteronomy. 12. 32. Mat. 1^. 9. Acts 17. 25. Mat. 4 9. 10. Deu. 4. 15. 10
20. Exo. 20. 4 5, 6. Col. 2. 23
.

II. Religious Worship is to be given to GOD the Father, the Son, and Holy
Ghost; and to him alone Mat. 4. 10. with Ioh. 5. 23 and 2. 2 Cor. 13. 14
; not, to Angels, Saints, or any other creature Col. 2. 18 Rev. 19. 10 Romans 1.
25
: and, since the Fall, not without a Mediator; nor, in the mediation of any
other, but of Christ alone John 14. 6 1 Timothy 2. 5. Ephesians. 7. 18 Col. 3. 17
.

III. Prayer, with thanksgiving, being one special part of Religious Worship
Phil. 4. 6
, is, by GOD required of all men Psalm. 65 2
; and, that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the Name of the Son John
14. 13. 14. 1 Pet. 2. 5
, by the help of his Spirit Romans 8. 26.
, according to his Will Ioh. 5. 14
, with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and
perseverance Psalm 47. 7 Eccles. 5. 1, 2 Heb. 12. 28 Genesis 18. 27 James 5. 16.
Iam. 1, 6, 7 Mark 11. 24. Mar 6. 12. 14. 15. Col 4. 2. Ep. 6. 18
; and if vocal, in a known tongue Cor. 14. 14
.

IV. Prayer is to be made for things lawful 1 Ioh 5, 14
, and for all sorts of men living, or that shall live hereafter 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2
Ioh. 17 20 2. Sa. 7. 29 Ruth 4. 12
: but, not for the dead 2 Samuel 12, 21 22. 23. with Luke 16. 25, 26 Rev. 14, 3
, nor for those of whom it may be known, that they have sinned the sin unto
death 1 Ioh. 5. ^6
.

V. The reading of the Scriptures with godly fear Act. 15. 21 Rev. 1. 3
, the sound Preaching 2. Tim. 4. 2
, and conscionable hearing of the Word, in obedience to God, with
understanding, faith, and reverence Iam. 1. 22 Acts 10. ^5 Mat. 13. 19. He 4.
2. Isa. 66. 2
; singing of Psalms with grace in the heart Col. 3. 16 Ephesians. 5. 19 Iam. 5. 13
; as also, the due administration, and worthy receiving of the Sacraments
instituted by Christ, are all, parts of the ordinary Religious Worship of God
Mat. 28. 19 1 Cor. 11. 13 to 29. Acts 2. 42
: Beside Religious Oaths Deuteronomy. 6. 13 with Neh. 10. 29.
, Vows Isa. 19. 21 with Eccl. 5. 4, 5
, Solemn Fastings Joel 2 12 Esther 4. 16 Mat. 9. 15 1 Cor. 7. 5
, and Thanksgivings, upon special occasions Psalm. 107 throughout Ester 9. 22
, which are, in their several times and seasons, to be used, in an holy and
religious manner Heb. 11. 28
.

VI. Neither Prayer, nor any other part of Religious Worship, is now under the
Gospel, either tied unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is
performed, or toward which it is directed John 4. 21
: but God is to be worshipped every where Mal. 1. 11 1 Timothy 2. 8
, in Spirit and Truth John 4 23, 24
: as in private Families Ier. 10. 25 Deuteronomy. 6. 6, 7 Job 1. 5 2 Samuel 6. 18 20. 1
Pet. 3 7. Acts 10. 2
, daily Mat. 6. 11
, and in secret, each one by himself Mat. 6. 6 Ephesians. ^. 18
; so, more sol^mnly, in the public Assemblies, which are not carelessy, or
wilfully to be neglected, or forsaken, when God, by his Word or Providence,
calls thereunto Isa. 56. 7 Heb. 10 25 Prove. 1. 20, 21, 24 Prove. 8. 34 Acts 13
42 Luke 4. 16 Acts 2. 42
.

VII. As it is of the Law of Nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time
be set a part, for the Worship of God: so, in his Word, by a positive, Moral,
and perpetual Commandment, binding all men, in all ages, he has particularly
appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him Exodus 20 8,
0, 11 Isa. 56. 2, 4, 6, 7.
: which, from the beginning of the World to the resurrection of Christ, was the
last Day of the week; and from the Resurrection of Christ, was changed into the
first Day of the week Genesis 2. 2, 3 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2 Acts 20. 7
, which, in Scripture, is called the LORDS Day Rev. 1. 10
, and is to be continued to the end of the World, as the Christian Sabbath
Exodus 20. 8. 10. with Mat. 5 17, 18
.

VIII. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, after a due
preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do
not only observe an holy rest, all the Day, from their own works, words, and
thoughts about their worldly employments, and recreations Exodus 20. 8 Exodus 16.
23, 25, 26, 29, 30 Ex. 31. 15, 16, 17 Isa. 58. 13. Nehem. 131 16, 17, 18, 19,
21, 22
, but also are taken up the whole time, in the public and private Exercises
of his Worship, and in the duties of necessity, and mercy Isa, 58. 13 Mat. 12.
2 to 13
.

CHAP. XXII. Of lawful Oaths and Vows.
A Lawful Oath is a part of Religious Worship Deuteronomy. 12 20
, wherein upon just occasion, the person swearing, solemnly calls God to
witness what he asserteth, or promises, and to judge him according to the
truth, or falsehood of what he swears Exodus 20. 7 Levit. 19. 12 2 Cor. 1. 23 2 Chronicles. 6 22, 23,
:

II. The Name of God only, is that by which men ought to swear; and, therein
it is to be used with all holy fear and reverence Deuteronomy. 6. 13
. Therefore, to swear vainly, or rashly, by that glorious and dreadful Name;
or, to swear at all, by any other thing, is sinful, and to be abhorred Exodus
10. ^ Ier. 1. 7 Mat 5. 34, 37 Iam. 5. 12
. Yet, as in matters of weight and moment, an Oath is warranted by the Word of
God, under the New Testament, as well as under the Old Heb. 6. 16 2 Cor. 1. 2^
Isa^. 6^. 1^
; so a lawful Oath, being imposed by lawful Authority, in such matters ought
to be taken 1 Kings ^. 31. Neh 13 25. Ezra. 10 5.
.

III. Whosoever takes an Oath, ought duly to consider the weightinesse of so
solemn an Act: and therein to avouch nothing, but what he is fully persuaded is
the truth Exodus 20. 7 Ier 4. 2
. Neither man any man bind himself by Oath to any thing but what is good and
just, and what he believes so to be, and what he i^ able, and resolved to
perform Gen 24. 2 3, 5, 6. 8, 9.
. Yet is it a sin, to refuse an Oath touching any thing that is good and just,
being impose^ by lawful Authority Number. 5. 19 21 Neh. 5 12. Ex^d. 22 7, 8, 9,
10, 11
.

IV. An Oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of the words, without
equivocation, or mental reservation Ier. 4. 2 Psalm 24. 4
It cannot oblige to sin: but, in any thing not sinful, being taken, it binds
to performance, although to a man's own hurt 1 Samuel 25 22. ^2, 33, 34 Psalm. 15. 4
, nor is it to be violated, although made to heretics, or infidels Ezekiel 17 16,
18, 19 I^sh 9. 18. 19 with 2 Samuel 21, ^


V. A Vow is of the like nature with a Promissary Oath, and ought to be made
with the like Religious care, and to be performed with the like faithfulness
Isai. 19. 11 Eccles. 5. 4, 5, 6. Psalm. 61. 8 Psalm. 66. 13, 14
.

VI. It is not to be made to any Creature but to God alone Psalm. 76. 11 Ier.
44. 25, 26.
: and, that it may be accepted, it is to made voluntarily, out of Faith, and
conscience of Duty, in way of Thankfulness for mercy received, or for the
obtaining of what we want: whereby we more strictly bind ourselves to
necessary duties: or, to other things, so far, and so long, as they may fitly
conduce thereunto Deuteronomy. 23. 21, 22, 23 Psalm 50. 14 Genesis 28. 20, 21, 22 1 Samuel
1. 11 Psalm. 66. 13, 14. Psalm. 132 2, 3, 4, 5.
.

VII. No man may Vow, to do any thing forbidden in the Word of God, or what
would hinder any duty therein commanded: or which is not in his own power, and,
for the performance whereof, he has no promise of ability from God Acts 23.
12, 14 Mark 6. 26 Numb 30. 5 8. 12, 13.
. In which respects, Popish Monastical Vows, of perpetual single life,
professed Poverty, and Regular Obedience, are so far from being degrees of
higher Perfection, that they are superstitious and sinful snares, in which, no
Christian may entangle himself Mat. 19. 11, 12 1 Cor. 7. 2. 9 Ephesians. 4. 28 1 Pet.
4. 2 1 Cor. 7. 23
.

CHAP. XXIII. Of the Civil Magistrate.
GOD, the supreme Lord and King of all the World, has Ordained Civil
Magistrates, to be under him, over the people, for his own Glory, and and the
public good: and, to this end, has armed them with the Power of the sword,
for the defense and encouragement of them that are good, and for the punishment
of evil doers Romans 13. 1, 2, 3, 4 1 Pet. 2, 13, 14.
.

II. It is lawful for Christians to accept and execute the Office of a
Magistrate, when called thereunto Pro. 8. 15. 16: Romans 13 1, 2; 4
: in the managing whereof, as they ought especially to maintain Piety, justice,
and Peace, according to the wholesome Laws of each Commonwealth Psalm. 2. 10, 11,
12 1 Timothy 2. 2 Psalm. 82. 3, 4 2 Samuel 23. 3 1 Pet. 2. 1^
: so, for that end, they may lawfully now, under the New Testament, wage War,
upon just and necessary occasion Luke 3. 14 Romans 13. ^4 Mat. 8. 9, 10 Acts 10.
1, 2 Rev. 17. 14
.

III. The Civil Magistrate may not assume to himself the administration of
the Word and Sacraments, or the power of the Keys of the Kingdom of heaven 2
Chro. 26 18, with Mat. 18. 17 Mat. 16, 19 and 1 Cor. 12. 28, 29 Ephesians. 4. 11, 12.
1 Cor. 4. 1, 2. Romans 10 15. Heb 5. 4.
. yet, he has Authority, and it is his duty, to take order, that Unity and
Peace be preserved in the Church, that the Truth of God be kept pure, and
entire, that all Blasphemies and Heresies be suppressed, all corruptions and
abuses in Worship and discipline prevented, or reformed: and all the Ordinances
of God duly settled, administered, and observed Isa. 49. 23 Psalm. 22. 9 Ezra. ^.
23, 25, 26, 27, 28 Levit. 24. 15 Deuteronomy. 13. 5 6. 12 2 Kings 18. 4 1 Chro. 13 1
to 9. 2 Kings 23. to 26 2 Chro. 34. 33. 2 Chronicles. 15. 12. 13.
. For the better effecting whereof, he has power to call Synods, to be present
at them, and to provide that whatsoever is transacted in them, be according to
the mind of God 2 Chro. 9 8, 9 10, 11 2 Chronicles. 29 30. Chapters Mat. 2. 4, 5
.

IV. It is the duty of People to pray for Magistrates 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2
, to honor their persons 1 Pet 2 1^
, to pay them tribute and other dues Romans 13. 6, 7.
, to obey their lawful commands, and to be subject to their Authority, for
consciencesake Romans 13. 5 Tit. 1. 3
. Infidelity, or difference in Religion does not make void the Magistrates just
and leg^ll Authority, not free the people from their due obedience to him 1
Pet. 2. 13, 14, 16
: from which, Ecclesiastical persons are not exempted Romans 13 16. Kings 2 35.
Acts 25 9, 10, 11 2 Pet. 2. 1, 10. 11 Jude ver. 8 9, 10, 11
, much less has the Pope any power and jurisdiction over them, in their
Dominions, or over any of their people; and least of all, to deprive them of
their Dominions, or lives, if he shall judge them to be Heretics, or upon any
other pretense whatsoever 2 These. 2. 4 Rev. 13. 15, 16, 17.
.

CHAP. XXIV. Of Marriage, and Divorce.
MArriage is to be between one Man and one Woman: neither is it lawful for any
man to have more then one Wife, nor for any Woman to have more then one
Husband, at the same time Genesis 2. 24 Mat. 19. 5, 6 Pro. 2. 17
.

II. Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of Husband and Wife Genesis 2 18
, for the increase of mankind with a legitimate issue, and of the Church with
an holy seed Mal. 2. 15
, and for preventing of uncleanness 1 Cor. 7 29
.

III. It is lawful for all sorts of people to marry, who are able with
judgment, to give their consent Heb 13 4 1 Timothy 4. 3 1 Cor. 36 37, 38 Gen 24.
57, 5^
. Yet, is it the duty of Christians to marry only in the Lord 1 Cor. 7. 39
. And therefore such as profess the true reformed Religion, should not marry
with Infidels, Papists, or other Idolaters: Neither should such as are godly be
unequally yoked, by marrying with such as are notoriously wicked in their life,
or maintain damnable Heresies Genesis 34. 14 Exodus 3^. 16 Deuteronomy. ^. 3 4 1 Kings 11,
4. Neh. 13. 25 26, 27. Mal. 2, 1^ 12 2 Cor. 6. 14
.

IV. Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of Consanguinity or Affinity
forbidden in the Word ^evit 18 Chapter. 1 Cor. 5. 1 Amo. 2. 7.
: Nor can such incestuous marriages ever be made lawful by any Law of man, or
consent of Parties, so as those persons may live together as man and wife Mark.
6. 18 Lev. 18. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.
. The man may not marry any of his wives kindred nearer in blood, then he may
of his own: nor, the woman of her husbands kindred, nearer in blood, then of her
own Levit. 20, 19, 20, 21.
.

V. Adultery, or fornication committed after a Contract, being detected before
marriage, gives just occasion to the innocent party to dissolve that contract
Mat. 1. 18, 19, 20.
: In the case of Adultery after marriage, it is lawful for the Innocent party
to sue out a Divorce Mat. 5. 31, 32.
: And after the Divorce, to marry another, as if the offending party were dead
Mat. 19. 9 Romans 7. ^, 3
.

VI. Although the corruption of man be such as is apt to study arguments,
unduely to put asunder those whom God has joined together in marriage: yet,
nothing but Adultery; or such wilful desertion as can no way be remedied, by
the Church, or Civil Magistrate, is cause sufficient of dissolving the bond of
Marriage Mat. 19. 8, 9. 1 Cor. 7. 15. Mat 19. 6.
: Wherein, a public and orderly course of proceeding is to be observed: And,
the Persons concerned in it, not left to their own wills and discretion, in
their own case Deuteronomy. 24. 1, 2, 3, 4.
.

CHAP. XXV. Of the Church.
THe Catholic or Universal Church which is invisible, consists of the whole
number of the Elect, that have bin, are, or shall be gathered into one, under
Christ the Head thereof; and is, the Spouse, the Body, the fullness of Him that
fills all in all Ephesians. 1. 10, 22, 23 Ephesians. 5. 23, 27. 32 Col. 1. 18
.

II. The visible Church, which is also Catholic or Universal, under the
Gospel (not confined to one Nation, as before, under the Law) consists of all
those, throughout the World, that profess the true Religion 1 Cor. 1, 2 1 Cor.
12 12 13. Psalm. 2. 8 Rev. 7. 9 Romans 15. 9 10, 11, 12
; and of their children 1 Cor. 7. 14. Acts 2 39. Ezekiel. 16. 20, 21. Romans 11 16.
Genesis 3. 15. Genesis 17. 7
: and is, the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ Mat. 13. 47 Isa. 9. 7 ^ Ephesians. 1.
19
, the House and Family of God Ephesians, 2. 15
, out of which there is no ordinary possibility of Salvation Acts* 2. 47
.

III. Unto this Catholic Visible Church, Christ has given the Ministry,
Oracles, and Ordinances of God, for the gathering, and perfecting of the
Saints, in this life, to the end of the world: and does by his own presence and
Spirit, according to his promise, make them effectual thereunto 1 Cor, 12 28.
Ephesians. 4 11, 12, 13 Mat. 28. 19, 20. Isa. 50. 21
.

IV. This Catholic Church has bin sometimes more, sometimes less visible
Romans 11. 3 4. Rev. 12. 6, 14.
. And particular Churches which are Members thereof, are more or less as pure,
according as the Doctrine of the Gospel is taught and embraced, Ordinances
administered, and public worship performed more or less purely in them Rev. 2.
3 chapters. 1 Cor. 5. 6, 7
.

V. The purest Churches under Heaven are subject both to mixture, and error 1
Cor 13. 12. Rev. 2. 3 chapters. Mat. 13. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 29, 30, 47
: and some have so degenerated, as to become no Churches of Christ, but
Synagogues of Satan Rev. 18. 2 Romans 11. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22
. Nevertheless, there shall be always a Church on Earth, to Worship God
according to his will Mat. 16 18 Psalm. 72. 17 Psalm. 102. 28 Mat 28. 19 20
.

VI. There is no other Head of the Church, but the Lord Jesus Christ Col. 1. 18
Ephesians 1. 22
: Nor can the Pope of Rome, in any sense be head thereof: but is, that
Antichrist, that man of sin, and Sun of Perdition, that exalts himself, in
the CHurch against Christ, and all that is called God Mat. ^3. 8, 9, 10 2 Thessalonians. 2. 3, 4 8. 9 Rev. 13. 6.
.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the Communion of Saints.
ALL Saints, that are united to Jesus Christ their Head, by his Spirit, and by
Faith, have fellowship with him in his graces, Sufferings, Death, Resurrection,
and Glory 1 John 1 Ephesians 3. 16, 17 18 19 John 1. 16 Ephesians. 2 5, 6 Phil. 3. 10 Romans
6. 5, 6 2 Timothy 2 12
: And, being united to one another in love, they have communion in each others
gifts and graces Ephesians. 4. 15, 16. 1 Cor. 12 7. 1 Cor 3. 21, 22, 23 Col. 2. 19.
, and are obliged to the performance of such duties public and private, as do
conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward man 1 These. ^ 11.
14 Romans 1 11, 12 14. 1 John 3. 16 17, 18. Gal. 6. 10.
.

II Saints by profession are bound to maintain an holy fellowship and communion
in the worship of God: and in performing such other spiritual services as tend
to their mutual edification Heb. 10, 24 25. Acts 2. 42, 46 Isa 2 3 1 Cor. 11 20
: as also, in relieving each other in outward things, according to their
several abilities, and necessities: Which Communion, as God offers
opportunity, is to be extended unto all those, who in every place call upon the
Name of the Lord Jesus Acts 2. 44 45. 1 John 3. ^7 2 Cor. 8 9. chapters. Acts
11. 29, 30.
.

III. This Communion which the Saints have with Christ, does not make them, in
any wise, partakers of the substance of his Godhead, or to be equal with
Christ in any respect: either of which to affirm, is impious, and blasphemous
Col 1. 18, 19. 1 Cor. 8 6. Isa. 42* 8 1 Timothy 6 15 16. Psalm. 45 7. with Heb. 1.
8, 9.
. Nor does their Communion one with another, as Saints, take away, or in fringe
the title, or propriety which each man has in goods and possessions Exodus 20.
15 Ephesians 4 28 Acts 5. 4.
.

CHAP. XXVII. Of the Sacraments.
SAcraments are holy Signs, and Seals of the Covenant of Grace Romans 4. 11
Genesis 17. 7, 10
, immediately instituted by God Mat. 28. 19 1 Cor 11. 23.
, to represent Christ, and his Benefits; and, to confirm our interest in him 1
Cor. 10, 16. 1 Cor 25, 26. Gal. 3. 27.
: as also, to put a visible difference between those that belong unto the
Church, and the rest of the World Romans 15. 8 Exodus 12. 48 Genesis 34. 14
: and, solemnly to engage them to the Service of God in Christ according to his
Word Romans 6. 3, 4. 1 Cor. 10. 16, 21.
.

II. There is in every Sacrament a spiritual relation, or Sacramental union,
between the Sign and the Thing signified: whence it comes to pass, that the
names, and effects of the one, are attributed to the other Genesis 17. 10 Mat. 26.
27, 28. Tit. 3. 5
.

III. The grace which is exhibited in, or by the Sacraments rightly used, is
not conferred by any power in them: neither does the efficacy of a Sacrament
depend upon the piety, or intention of him that does administer it Rom, 2. 28,
29. 1 Pet. 3. 21
, but, upon the work of the Spirit Mat. 3. ^^ 2 Cor. 12. 13
, and the word of institution, which contains, together with a precept
authorizing the use thereof, a promise of benefit to worthy receivers Mat. 26.
27, ^8. Mat. 28. 19, ^0.
.

IV. There be only two Sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord, in the Gospel,
that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord: neither of which may be
dispensed by any, but by a Minister of the Word lawfully ordained Mat. ^8. 19 1
Cor. 11. 20, 23. 1 Cor. 4. 1 Heb. 5. 4
.

V. The Sacraments of the Old Testament, in regard of the spiritual things
thereby signified, and exhibited, were, for substance, the same with those of
the New 2 Cor. 10, 1^ 2, 3, 4. ^
.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of Baptism.
BAptism is a Sacrament of the New Testament, Ordained by Jesus Christ Mat. 28.
19
, not only for the solemn Admission of the party Baptized, into the Visible
Church 1 Cor. 12 13
: but also, to be unto him a sign, and seal of the Covenant of Grace Romans 4.
11 with Col. 2. 11, 12
, of his ingrafting into Christ Gal 3. 27 Romans 6. 5
, of Regeneration Tit. 3. 5
, of Remission of sins Mark 1. 4
and of his giving up unto God through Jesus Christ, to walk in newnes of life
Romans 6. 3, 4.
. Which Sacrament is, by Christ's own appointment, to be continued in his
Church until the end of the World Mat. 28. ^9 20.
.

II. The outward Element to be used in this Sacrament is Water, wherewith the
Party is to be Baptized, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost, by a Minister of the Gospel, lawfully called thereunto Mat. 3. 11
John 1. 33 Mat. 28. 19, 20.
.

III. Dipping of the person into the Water, is not necessary: but, Baptism is
rightly administered, by pouring, or sprinkling Water upon the person Heb 9. 10,
19, 20, 21, 22 Acts 2. 41 Acts 16. 33 Mark. 7. 4
.

IV. Not only those that do actually profess Faith in, and obedience unto
Christ Mark. 16, 15, 16. Acts 8. 37, 38.
, but also the infants of one, or both believing Parents, are to be baptized
Genesis 17. 7 9. with Gal. 3. 9, 14* and Col. 2. 11, 12, and Acts 2. 38, 39. and
Romans 4. 11, 12 1 Cor. 7. 14 Mat. 28. 19 Mark. 10. 13, 14, 15, 16 Luke 18. 15
.

V. Although it be a great sin to contemn or neglect this Ordinance Luke 7. 30
with Exo. 4. 24, 25, 26
, yet Grace and Salvation are not so inseparably annexed unto it, as that no
person can be regenerated or saved, without it Romans 4. 11 Acts 10. 2. 4 23, 31,
45, 47
: or, that all that are Baptized, are undoubtedly regenerated Acts 8. 13, 23.
.

VI. The efficacy of Baptism is not tied to that moment of time, wherein it is
administered John 3. 5, 8
: yet, notwithstanding, by the right use of this Ordinance, the grace promised,
is not only offered, but really exhibited, and conferred, by the Holy Ghost, to
such (whether of age, or infants) as that grace belongs unto, according to
the Council of Gods own Will, in his appointed time Gal. 3. 27 Tit. 3. 5. Ephesians
5. 25, 26 Acts 2. 38. 41.


VII. The Sacrament of Baptism is but once to be administered unto any person
Tit. 3. 5.
.

CHAP. XXIX. Of the LORDS Supper.
Our Lord Jesus, in the night wherein he was betrayed, Instituted the Sacrament
of his Body and Blood, called the Lords Supper, to be observed in his Church,
unto the end of the world, for the perpetual Remembrance of the sacrifice of
Himself, in his Death: the sealing all benefits thereof unto true Believers,
their Spiritual nourishment and growth in him, their further engagement in, and
to, all duties which they owe unto him; and, to be a bond, and pledge of their
Communion with him, and with each other, as members of his mystical Body 1 Cor
11 23, 25. 26 2. Cor. 10. 16. 2^, 21 2 Cor. 12. 13
.

II. In this Sacrament Christ is not offered up to his Father: nor, any real
Sacrifice made at all, for remission of sins of the quick or dead Heb. 9. 22,
25, 26, 28
, but only a Commemoration of that one offering up of Himself, by Himself, upon
the Cross once for all: and a spiritual Oblation of all possible praise unto
God, for the same 1 Cor. 11 24, 25, 26 Mat. 26, 26, 27.
: So that the Popish Sacrifice of the Mass (as they call it) is most
abominably injurious to Christ's one, only Sacrifice, the alone Propitiation
for all the sins of the Elect Heb. 7. 23, 24, 27. Heb. 10. 11, 12, 14, 18.
.

III. The Lord Jesus has, in this Ordinance, appointed his Ministers to
declare his word of institution to the people, to pray, and bless the Elements
of Bread and Wine, and thereby to set them apart from a Common to an Holy Use:
and, to Take, and Break the Bread, to Take the Cup, and (they communicating
also themselves) to give both to the Communicants Mat. 26 26, 27, 28 and Mark.
14. 22 23, 24. and Luke 22. 19, 20. with 1 Cor. 11 23, 24, 25, 26
; but, to none who are not then present in the Congregation Acts 20. 7 1 Cor.
11. 20
.

IV. Private Masses, or receiving this Sacrament by a Priest, or any other,
alone 1 Cor. 10. 6
, as likewise, the denial of the Cup to the people Mark. 4. 23 1 Cor. 11. 25
26, 27, 28, 29
, worshipping the Elements, the lifting them up, or carrying he about for
adoration, and the reserving them for any pretended religious use, are all
contrary to the nature of this Sacrament, and to the Institution of Christ Mat.
15. 9
.

V. The outward Elements in this Sacrament, duly set apart, to the uses
ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that truly, yet
Sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name of the things they
represent, to wit, the Body and Blood of Christ Mat. 26 26. 27, 28
, albeit, in substance and nature, they still remain, truly, and only Bread and
Wine, as they were before 1 Cor. 11 26, 27, 28 Mat. 26. 29
.

VI. That Doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of Bread and Wine,
into the substance of Christ's Body and Blood (commonly called
Transubstantiation) by Consecration of a Priest, or by any other way, is
repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to common Sense and Reason;
overthrows the nature of the Sacrament, and has bin, and is, the cause of
manifold Supertitions, ye, of gross Idolatries Act. 3. 21 with 1 Cor. 11. 24
25, 26 Luke 24. 6, 39.
.

VII. Worthy Receivers outwardly partaking of the visible Elements, in this
Sacrament 1 Cor. 11 28.
, do then also, inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and
corporally, but Spiritually, receive, and feed upon Christ crucified, and all
benefits of his death: The Body and Blood of Christ being then, not corporally,
or carnally, in, with, or under the Bread and Wine; yet, as really, but
Spiritually, present to the Faith of Believers in that Ordinance, as the
Elements themselves are to their outward senses 1 Cor 10 16
.

VIII. Although ignorant, and wicked men receive the outward Elements, in this
Sacrament: yet, they receive not the Thing signified thereby; but by their
unworthy coming thereunto, are guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord to
their own damnation. Wherefore, all ignorant, and ungodly persons, as they are
unfit to enjoy communion with him, so are they unworthy of the Lords Table;
and, cannot without great sin against Christ, while they remain such, partake
of these Holy Mysteries 1 Cor. 11 27, 28, 29 2 Cor. 14, 6 15. 16
, or be admitted thereunto 1 Cor. 5. 6 7, 13 2 Thessalonians. 3 6, 14, 15 Mat. 7. 6
.

CHAP. XXX. Of Church Censures.
THe Lord Jesus, as King and Head of his Church, has therein appointed a
Government, in the hand of Church Officers, distinct from the Civil Magistrate
Isa. 9. 6, 7 1 Timothy 5. 17 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12 Acts 20. 17, 28. Heb. 13 7. 17, 24 1
Cor. 12. 28 Mat. 28. 18, 19, 20.
.

II. To these Officers, the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are committed: by
virtue whereof, they have power, respectively, to retain, and remit sins; to
shut that Kingdom against the impenitent, both by the Word, and Censures; and
to open it unto penitent sinners, by the Ministry of the Gospel, and by
Absolution from Censures, as occasion shall require Mat. 16. 19 Mat. 18. 17,
18. John 20 20, 21, 22, 23 2 Cor. 2. 6, 7 8.
.

III. Church Censures are necessary, for the reclaiming and gaining of
offending Brethren, for deterring of others from the like offenses, for purging
out of that Leaven which might in fect the whole Lump, for vindicating the
honor of Christ, and the holy Profession of the Gospel, and for preventing the
wrath of God, which might justly fall upon the Church, if they should suffer
his Covenant, and the Seals thereof to be profaned by notorious and obstinat^
offenders 1 Cor. 5. Chapter. 1 Timothy 5. 20 Mat. 7. 6 1 Timothy 1. 20 1 Cor. 11. 27
to the end, with Jude ver 23.
.

IV. For the better attaining of these ends, the Officers of the Church are to
proceed by Admonition, suspension from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper for a
season; and, by Excommunication from the Church, according to the nature of the
crime, and demerit of the person 1 These. 5 12. 2 These. 3. 6, 14, 15 1 Cor. 5.
4, 5 13. Mat. 18 17. Tit. 3. 10
.

CHAP. XXXI. Of Synods and Councels.
FOr the better Government, and further edification of the Church; the^e ought
to be such Assemblies, as are commonly called Synods or Councels Act. 15. 2 4.
6.
.

II. As Magistrates may lawfully call a Synod of Ministers, and other fit
Persons, to consult and advise with, about matters of Religion Isa. 49. 23 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2 2 Chronicles. 19 8, 9, 10. 11 2 Chronicles. 29 30. Chapters. Mat. 24, 5.
Prove. 11. 14
: So, if Magistrates be open Enemies to the Church, the Ministers of Christ, of
themselves, by virtue of their Office; or, they, with other fit persons, upon
delegation from their Churches, may meet together in such Assemblies Acts 15. 2
4, 22, 23, 25
.

III. It belongs to Synods and Councels, ministerially to determine
Controversies of Faith, and cases of Conscience, to set down Rules and
Directions for better Ord^ring of the public Worship of God, and Government of
his Church; to receive complaints, in cases of Male administration: and,
authoritatively, to Determine the same: which Decrees, and Determinations, if
consonant to the Word of God, are to be received with reverence, and
submission; not only, for their agreement with the Word, but also for the
Power, whereby they are made, as being an Ordinance of God appointed thereunto
in his Word Acts 15. 15 19, 24, 27, 28 29. 30, 31 Acts 16. 4 Mat. 18. 17, 18,
19, 20.
.

IV. All Synods or Counsels, since the Apostles times, whether general, or
particular, may err; and, many have erred. Therefore, they are not to be made
the rule of Faith, or practice; but, to be used as an help in both Ephesians 2. 22
Acts 17. 11 1 Cor. 2. 5 2 Cor. 1. 24
.

V. Synods and Counsels are to handle, or conclude nothing, but that which is
Ecclesiastical: and are not to intermeddle with civil affairs which concern
the Commonwealth, unless by way of humble petition in cases extraordinary;
or, by way of Advice, for satisfaction of conscience, if they be thereunto
required by the civil Magistrate Luke 12 13, 14. John 18. 36
.

CHAP. XXXII. Of the state of men after death, and of the Resurrection of the
dead.
THe Bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption Genesis 3. 19
Acts 13. 36
: but, their souls (which neither die, nor sleep) having an immortal
subsistence, immediately return to GOD, who gave them Luke 23 43 Eccles. 22. 7
: the souls of the Righteous, being then made perfect in holiness, are
received into the highest Heavens, where they behold the face of God, in light
and glory, waiting for the full Redemption of their Bodies Heb. 12. 23 2 Cor 5,
1, 6 8. Phil. 1. 23 with Acts 3 21. and Ephesians. 4. 10.
. And the souls of the wicked are cast into Hell, where they remain in torments
and utter darkness, reserved to the Judgment of the great Day Luke 16. 23 24.
Acts 1 25 Jude v. 6, 7 1 Pet. 3. 19
. Beside these two places, for souls separated from their bodies, the Scripture
acknowledges none.

II. At the last Day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed 1
These. 4. 17 1 Cor. 15. 51 52.
: and, all the dead shall be raised up, with the self same bodies, and none
other, although with different qualities, which shall be united again to their
souls for ever Job 19. 26 27. 1 Cor. 15 42, 43, 44
.

III. The bodies of the unjust, shall, by the power of Christ, be raised to
dishonor: the bodies of the just by his spirit, unto honor; and, be made
conformable to his own glorious Body Acts 24, 1^ Ioh. 5. 28, 29 1 Cor. 15. 42
Phil. 3. 21
.

CHAP. XXXIII. Of the last Judgment.
GOD has appointed a Day, wherein he will judge the World, in righteousness,
by Jesus Christ Acts 17. 31
, to whom, all power, and judgment is given of the Father Ioh 5. 22, 27.
In which day, not only the Apostate Angels shall be judged 1 Cor. 6. 3 Jude
verse. 6 2 Pet. 2. 4.
, but likewise all persons that have lived upon earth, shall appear before the
tribunal of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds;
and to receive according to what they have done in the Body, whether good or
evil 2 Cor. 5, 10 Eccl. 12. 14 Romans 2. 16 Rom 14. 10, 12. Mat. 12 36, 37.
.

II. The end of Gods appointing his Day, is for the manifestation of the glory,
of his Mercy, in the eternal sal^a^ion of the Elect; and, of his Justice, in
the damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked, and disobedient. For, then
shall the Righteous go into everlasting Life, and receive that fullness of Joy,
and refreshing, which shall come from the presence of the Lord but, the wicked,
who know not God, and obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into
eternal Torments, and be punished with everlasting destruction from the
presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power Mat. 25. 31 to the end
Romans 2. 5, 6 Romans 9. ^2, 2^. Mat. 25 21. Acts 3. 19 2 Thessalonians. 1, 7, 8, 9, 10
.

III. As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded, That there shall be a
Day of Judgment, both to deter all men from sin, and for the greater
consolation of the godly in their adversity 2 Pet. 3. 11, 14. 2 Cor. 5 10, 11,
2 These 1. 5, 6, 7. Luk 21. 2^, 28 Romans 8. 23 24, 25 g Mat. 24. 36 42, 43, 44
Mark. 13. 35 36, 37. Luke 11. 35, 36 Rev. 22. 20
: so, will he have that Day unknown to men, that they may shake off all
carnal security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour
the Lord will come; and, may be ever prepared to say, come Lord Jesus, come
quickly, Amen.

thereof Ezekiel, 36 27

, but growing up to perfection 2 Cor. 7. 2 Phil. 3. 12, 13 14
.

Q. Whence arises the imperfection of Sanctification in believers?

into many sins Romans 7. 18. 23 Mar. 14, 66 to the end. Gal. 2. 11, 12
, are hindered in all their spiritual services Heb. 12. 1
, and their best works are imperfect and defiled in the sight of God Isa. 64. 6
Exodus, 28, 38
.

Q. May not true beleivers, by reason of their imperfections, and the many
temptations and sins they are overtaken with, fall away from the state of Grace?
A. True Believers, by reason of the unchangeable love of God Ier. 31. 3
, and his Decree and Covenant to give them perseverance 2 Timothy 2. 19 Heb. 13.
20 21 2 Samuel 23. 5
, their inseparable union with Christ 1 Cor. 18. 9
, his continual intercession for them Heb. 7. 25 Luke 22. 32

.

Q. Can true believers be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of
grace, and that they shall persevere therein unto salvation?
A. Such as truly believe in Christ, and endeavor to walk in all good
conscience before him 1 John 2. 3
, may without extraordinary revelation by faith grounded upon the truth of Gods
promises, and by the spirit enabling them to discern in themselves those graces
in which the promises of life are made 1 Cor. 2. 12 1 Ioh. 3. 4 18, 19, 21, 24
1 John 4. 13 16 Heb. 6. 11, 12
, and bearing witness with their spirits, that they are the children of God
Romans 8. 16
, be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and shall
persevere therein unto salvation 1 Ioh. 5. 1
.

Q. Are all true believers at all times assured of their present being in the
estate of grace, and that they shall be saved?
A. Assurance of grace and salvation not being of the essence of faith Ephesians. 1 13
, true believers may wait long before they obtain it Isa. 50. 10 Psalm. 88.

manifold distempers, sins, temptations, and desertions Psalm. 77. 1 to 12 Cant.
^. 2, 3, 6 Psalm. 58. ^^ Psalm. 31. 22 Psalm 22. 1.

.

Q. What is the Communion in Glory with Christ, which the members of the
Invisible Church enjoy in this life?
A. The members of the Invisible Church have communicated to them in this life,
the first fruits of glory with Christ, as they are members of him their head,
and so, in him, are interessed in that glory which he is fully possessed of
Ephesians. 2. 5. 6
; and, as an earnest thereof, enjoy the sense of Gods love Romans 5. 5 with 2
Cor. 1. 22
, peace of conscience, joy in the holy Ghost, and hope of glory Romans 5, 1, 2
Romans 14. 17
: as on the contrary, the sense of Gods revenging wrath, horror of conscience,
and a fearful expectation of judgment, are, to the wicked, the beginning of
their torments which they shall endure after death Genesis 4. 13 Mat. 27 4 Heb.
10. 27 Romans 2. 9 Mat. 9. 44
.

Q. Shall all men die?
A Death being threatened as the wages of sin Romans 6. 25
, it is appointed unto all men once to die Heb 9 27
, for that all have sinned Romans 5. 12

Q. Death being the wages of sin, why are not the righteous delivered from
death, seeing all their sins are for given in Christ?
A. The righteous shall be delivered from death it self at the last day, and
even in death are delivered from the sting and curse of it 1 Cor. 15 26, 56
Heb, 2. 15
, so that, although they die, yet it is out of Gods love Isa. 57. 1, 2 2 Kin.
22. 20
, to free them perfectly from sin and misery Rev. 14. 13 Ephesians. 5. 27
, and to make them capable of further communion with Christ in glory, which
they then enter upon Luke 23. 43 Phil. 1. 23
.

Q. What is the commnuion in Glory with Christ, which the members of the
invisible Church enjoy immediately after death?
A. The communion in glory with Christ, which the members of the invisible
Church enjoy immediately after death is, in that their souls are then made
perfect in holiness Heb. 12. 23
, and received into the highest heavens 2 Cor. 5. 1 6, 8 Phil. 1. 23 with Acts
3. 21. and Ephesians. 4. 10
, where they behold the face of God in light and glory 1 Ioh 3. 2 1 Cor. 13. 12
, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies Romans 8. 23 Psalm. 19. 6
, which even in death continue united to Christ 1 These. 4 14
, and rest in their graves as in their beds Isai 57. 2
, till at the last day they he again united to their souls Job 19. 26 27
: whereas the souls of the wicked are at death cast into hell, where they

.

united to their souls for ever, shall be raised up by the power of Christ 1
Cor. 15 51, 52, 53 1 These. 4. 15 16, 17 Ioh. 5. 28, 29
; the bodies of the just, by the Spirit of Christ, and by virtue of his
resurrection, as their head, shall be raised in power, spiritual,
incorruptible, and made like to his glorious body 1 Cor. 15 21, 22, 23, 24 43,
44 Phil. 3. 31
, and the bodies of the wicked shall be raised up in dishonor, by him, as an
offended Judge Ioh. 5. 27, 28, 29 Mat. 25. 33
.

Q. What shall immediately follow after the resurrection?
A. Immediately after the resurrection shall follow the general and final
judgment of Angels and men 2 Pet. 2. 4 Jude v. 6, 7, 14, 15 Mat 25 46

against them Mat. 25. 41 42, 43
; and thereupon shall be cast out from the favorable presence of God, and the
glorious fellowship with Christ, his Saints, and all his holy Angels, into
hell, to be punished with unspeakable torments, both of body and soul, with the
devil and his Angels for ever Luke 16. 26 2 These. 1, 8, 9
.

Q. What shall be done to the righteous at the day of Judgment?
A. At the day of Judgment, the righteous, being caught up to Christ in the
clouds 1 These. 4 17
, shall be set on his right hand, and there openly acknowledged, and acquitted
Mat. 25. 3^ Mat. 10 32
, shall join with him in the judging of reprobate Angels and men 1 Cor. 6 2, 3
, and shall be received into heaven Mat. 25. 34 46
; where they shall be fully and for ever freed from all sin and misery Ephesians 5.
27 Rev. 14. 13
, filled with unconceivable joys Psalm. 16. 11
, made perfectly holy, and happy both in body and soul, in the company of
innumerable Saints, and holy Angels Heb. 12. 22 23
, but especially in the immediate vision and fruition of God the Father, of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and of the holy Spirit, to a^l eterni^y 1 Ioh. 3. 2 1 Cor.
13. 12 1 These. 4. 17 18
: and this is perfect and full communion which the members of the invisible
Church shall enjoy with Christ in glory at the resurrection and day of
Judgment.

Having seen, what the Scriptures principally teach us to believe concerning
God; it follows to consider, what they require as the duty of man.
Q. WHat is the duty that God requires of man?
A. The duty which God requires of man, is, obedience to his revealed will
Romans 12 1, 2 Mic 6. 8 1 Samuel 15. 22
.

Q. What did God at first reveal unto man as the rule of his obedience?
A. The rule of obedience revealed to Adam in the estate of innocence, and to
all mankind in him, beside a special command, not to eat of the fruit of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil, was, the Moral Law Genesis 1. ^6 2^ Romans
2. 14, 15 Romans 10. 5 Genesis 2. 17
.

Q. What is the Moral Law?
A. The Moral Law is the declaration of the will of God to mankind, directing
and binding every one to personal, perfect, and perpetual conformity and
obedience thereunto, in the frame and disposition of the whole man, soul and
body Deuteronomy. 5, 1, 21, 32, 33 Luke 10. 26, 27 Gal 3. 10 1 These. ^. 13
, and in performance of all those duties of holiness and righteousness which
he owes to God and man ^uk. 1 75 Acts 14. 16
; promising life upon the fulfilling, and threatening death upon the breach of
it Romans 10. 5 Gal. 3. 10, 12
.

Q. Is there any use of the Moral Law to man since the fall?
A. Although no man, since the fall, can attain to righteousness and life by
the Moral Law Romans 8. 3 Gal. 2. 16
, yet there is great use thereof, as well common to all men, as peculiar either
to the unregenerate, or the regenerate 1 Timothy 1. 8
.

Q. Of what use is the Moral Law to all men?
A. The Moral Law is of use to all men, to enfo^m them of the holy nature and
will of God Lev. 11. 44 45* Lev. 20. 7, 8 Romans 7. 12
, and of their duty, binding them to walk accordingly Mic. 6. 8 Tim. 2. 10, 11
; to convince them of their disability to keep it, and of the sinful pollution
of their nature, hearts, and lives Psalm. 19, 11 12 Romans 3. 10 Romans 7. 7
; to humble them in sense of their sin and misery Romans 3. 9 23
, and thereby help them to a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ Gal.
3. 21 22
, and of the perfection of his obedience Romans 10. 4
.

Q. What particular use is there of the Moral Law to unregenerate men?
A. The Moral Law is of use to unregenerate men, to awaken their consciences
to fly from wrath to come 1 Timothy 1. 9 10
, and to drive them to Christ Gal. 1. 24
; or, upon their continuance in the estate and way of sin, to leave them
inexcusable Romans 1. 20 with Romans 2. 15 Gal. 3. 10.
, and under the curse thereof e.

Q. What special use is there of the Moral Law to the regenerate?
A. Although they that are regenerate, and believe in Christ, be delivered from
the Moral Law as a Covenant of works Romans 6. 14 Rom 7. 4. 6 Gal. 4. 4, 5
, so as thereby they are neither justified Romans 3 20
, nor condemned Gal. 5. 23 Romans 8. 1
; yet, beside the general uses thereof common to them with all men, it is of
special use, to show them how much they are bound to Christ for his fulfilling
it, and enduring the curse thereof in their stead, and for their good Romans 7.
24 25 Gal. 3. 13, 14 Romans 8. 3, 4
; and thereby to provoke them to more thankfulness Luke 1. 68, 69, 74, 75 Col.
1 12, 13 14
, and to express the same in their greater care to conform themselves
thereunto as the rule of their obedience Romans 7. 22 Romans 12. 2 Tit. 1. 11. 12,
13, 14
.

Q. Where is the Moral Law summarily comprehended?
A. The Moral Law is summarily comprehended in the ten Commandments, which
were delivered by the voice of God upon mount Sinai, and written by him in two
Tables of stone Deuteronomy. 10 4. Exodus 34. 1, 2, 3, 4
, and are recorded in the twentieth Chapter of Exodus; the four first
Commandments containing our duty to God, and the other six our duty to man
Mat. 22 37, 38, 39, 40
.

Q. What rules are to be observed for the right understanding of the ten
Commandments?
A. For the right understanding of the Commandments, these rules are to be
observed.

That the Law is perfect, and binds every one to full conformity in the whole
man unto the righteousness thereof, and unto entire obedience, for ever; so as,
to require the utmost perfection of every duty, and to forbid the least degree
of every sin Psalm. 19. 7 Iam. ^. 10 Mat. 5. 21 to the end.
.

That it is spiritual; and so, reaches the Understanding, Will, Affections,
and all other powers of the soul, as well as words, works, and gestures Romans 7.
14 Deuteronomy 6. 5 with Mat. 22, 37* 38, 39 Mat. 5. 21, 22 27 28, 36, to the end.
.

That one and the same thing, in diverse respects, is required or forbidden in
several Commandments Col. 3 5 Amos 8. 5 Prove. 1. 19 1 Timothy 6. 10
.

That, as, where a duty is commanded, the contrary sin is forbidden Isa. 58. 13
Deu. 6. 13 with Mat. 4, 9, 10 Mat 15. 4 5, 6
; and, where a sin is forbidden, the contrary duty is commanded Mat. 5. 21, 22,
23, 24, 25 Ephesians. 4. 28
; so, where a promise is annexed, the contrary threatening is included Exo. 10.
12 with Prove. 30, 17
; and, where a threatening is annexed, the contrary promise is included Ier. 18.
7, 8 Exodus 20. 7, with Ps 15 1, 4, 5, and Psalm. 24. 4, 5
.

That, what God forbids, is at no time to be done Job 13. ^, ^ Romans 3. 8 Job
36, 21 Heb 11. 25
; what he commands, is always our duty Deuteronomy. 4. 8. 9
, yet every particular duty is not to be done at all times Mat. 12. 7
.

That, under one sin or duty, all of the same kind are forbidden or commanded,
together with all the causes, means, occasions, and appearances thereof, and
provocations thereunto Mat. 5. 21 22, 27, 28 Mat. 15 4, 5. 6 Heb. 10 24, 25 1
These. 5. 22 Jude v. 13 Gal. 5. 16 Col. 3. 21
.

That what is fo^bidden or commanded to our selves, we are bound, according to
our places, to endeavor that it may be avoided or performed by others,
according to the duty of their places Exodus 20 10 Lev. 19. 17 Genesis 18. 19 Josh
24. 15 Deuteronomy. 6. 6, 7
.

That, in what is commanded to others, we are bound according to our places and
callings to be helpful to them 2 Cor. 1. 24

who, as he brought them out of their bondage in Egypt, so he delivers us

A. The Reasons annexed to the third Commandment in these words [the LORD thy
GOD] and [for the LORD will not hold him guiltiesse that takes his name in
vain Exodus 20. 7
] are, because he is the LORD and our GOD; and therefore his name is not to be
profaned, or any way abused by us Levit. 19. 12
; especially, because he will be so far from acquitting and sparing the
transgressors of this Commandment, as that he will not suffer them to escape
his righteous judgment Ezekiel. 36. 21 22, 23 Deuteronomy. 28. 58 59 Zech. 5. 2, 3, 4

thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle nor thy
stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the LORD made heaven and
earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore
the LORD blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed x Exodus 20 8 9, 10, 11
it x.

Q. What is required in the fourth Commandment.
A* The fourth Commandment requires of all men, the sanctifying, or keeping
holy to God, such set time as he has appointed in his word; expressly, one
whole day in seven, which was the seventh from the beginning of the world to
the resurrection of Christ, and the first day of the week ever since, and so to
continue to the end of the world; which is the Christian Sabbath Deuteronomy. 5. 12
13, 14 Genesis 2. 2. 3 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2 Acts 20. 7 Mat. 5 17, 18 Isa. 56, 24, 6, 7.
, and in the New Testament called the Lords day Rev 1. 10
.

Q. How is the Sabbath, or Lords day to be sanctified?
A. The Sabbath or Lords day is to be sanctified, by an holy resting all the
day Exodus 20* 8, 10
, not only from such works as are at all times sinful, but even from such
world^y employments and recreations as are on other days lawful Exodus 16 25.
26. 27, 28 Neh 13, 15 16, 17, 18, 19 21, 22 Ier. 17. 21, 22
; and making it our delight to spend the whole time (except so much of it as is
to be taken up in works of necessity and mercy Mat. 12 1 to 13
) in the public and private exercises of Gods worship Isa 58. 13 Luke 4. 16
Acts 20. 7 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2 Psalm. 92. title Isa. 66 23 Lev. 23. 3
: and to that end we are to prepare our hearts, and with such foresight,
diligence and moderation to dispose, and seasonably to dispatch our wordly
business, that we may be the more free and fit for the duties of that day Exodus
2. 8 Luke 23. 54, 55 Exodus 16. 22 25, 26, 29. Neh. 13. 19
.

Q. Why is the charge of keeping the Sabbath more specially directed to
governors of families and other superiors?
A. The charge of keeping the Sabbath is more specially directed to governors
of families, and other superiors, because they are bound not only to keep it
themselves, but to see that it be observed by all those that are under their
charge; and because they are prone oft-times to hinder them by employments of
their own Exodus 20. 10 Josh. 24. 15 Neh 13. 15 17 Ier. 17. 20, 21 22 Exodus 23.
12


Q. What are the sins forbidden in the fourth Commandment?

, all, profaning the day by idleness and doing that which is in it self sinful
Ezekiel. ^3. 38
, and by all needles works, words, and thoughts about our worldly employments
and recreations Ier. 17. 24 27 Isa 58. 13
.

Q. What are the Reasons annexed to the fourth commandment the more to enforce
it?
A. The Reasons annexed to the fourth Commandment the more to enforce it, are
taken from the equity of it, God allowing us six days of seven for our own
affairs, and reserving but one for himself, in these words, [Six day^s shall
thou labor and do all thy work Exodus 20. 9
;] from Gods challenging a special property in that day, [The seventh day is
the Sabbath of the LORD thy GOD Exodus 20. 10
] from the example of God, who in six days made heaven and earth the sea and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; and from that blessing which
God put upon that day, not only in sanctifying it to be a day for his service,
but in ordaining it to be a means of blessing to us in our sanctifying it;
[Wherfore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it Rom 20. 11
.

Q. Why is the word Remember set in the beginning of the fourth Commandment?
A. The word Remember is set in the beginning of the fourth Commandment Exodus
20. 8
partly because of the great benefit of remembering it; we being thereby helped
in our preparation to keep it Exodus 16, 23 Luk 23. 54 56 with Mar. 15. 42 Neh
13. 9
, and in keeping it, better to keep all the rest of the Commandments Psalm. 92
title with verse. 13. 14 Ezekiel. 20, 12. 19. 20
, and to continue a thankful remembrance of the two great benefits of Creation,
and Redemption, which contain a short abridgment of Religion Genesis 2. 2, 3 Isai.
1. 8, 22 24 with Acts 4. 10, 11 Rev. 1. 10
: and partly because we are very ready to forget it Ezekiel. 21. 26
, for that there is less light of nature for it Neh. 6. 14.
, and yet it restrains our natural liberty in things at other times lawful
Exodus 34. 21
; that it comes but once in seven days, and many worldly businesses come
between and too often take off our minds from thinking of it, either to prepare
for it, or to sanctify it Deuteronomy. 5. 14 15 Amos 8. 5
; and that Satan with his instruments much labor to blot out the glory, and
even the memory of it, to bring in all irreligion and impiety Iam. 1. 7 ^er.

professing faith in Christ, and obedience to him, are in that respect within

performed by us all our life long; especially in the time of temptation, and
when we are present at the administration of it to others Col. 2. 11, 12 Rom 6.
4. 6, 11
, by serious and thankful consideration of the nature of it, and of the ends
for which Christ instituted it, the privileges and benefits conferred and
sealed thereby, and our solemn vow made therein Romans 6. 3, 4, 5
, by being humbled for our sinful defilement, our falling short of, and walking
contrary to the grace of Baptism and our engagements 1 Cor. 1. 11 12, 13 Romans
6. 2. 3
, by growing up to assurance of pardon of sin, and of all other blessings
sealed to us in that Sacrament Romans 4. 11, 12. 1 Pet. 3 21.
, by drawing strength from the death and resurrection of Christ, into whom we
are baptized, for the mortifying of sin, and quickening of grace Rom 6, 3 4. 5
, and by end eavouring to live by faith Gal. 3. 26, 2^

, as those that have therein given up their names to Christ Acts 2. 38
, and to walk in brotherly love, as being baptized by the same spirit into one
body 1 Cor. 12 13, 25, 26, 27
.

Q. What is the Lords Supper?
A. The Lords Supper is a Sacrament of the New Testament Luke 22. 20

Sacrament of the Lords Supper?
A. Christ has appointed the Ministers of his word, in the administration of
the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, to set apart the bread and wine from common
use, by the word of institution, thanksgiving, and prayer, to take and break
the bread, and to give both the Bread, and the Wine to the Communicants, who
are, by the same appointment, to take, and eat the Bread, and to drink the
Wine, in thankful remembrance, that the body of Christ was broken and given,
and his blood shed for them Cor. 11, 23 24 Mat. 26. 26, 27, 28 Mar. 14. 22, 23,
24 Luke 22. 19, 20
.

Q. How do they that worthily communicate in the Lords Supper, feed upon the
body and blood of Christ therein?
A. As the body and blood of Christ are not corporally or carnally present in,
with, or under the Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper Acts 3. 21
, and yet are spiritually present to the faith of the receiver, no less truly
and really then the elements themselves are to their outward senses Mat. 26. 26
28
, so they that worthily communicate in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, do
therein feed upon the body and blood of Christ, not after a corporal, or
carnal, but in a spiritual manner, yet truly and really 1 Cor. 1. 24 25, 26,
^^ 28, 29
, while by faith they receive and apply unto themselves Christ crucified, and
all the benefits of his death 1 Cor. 10 16
.

themselves before they come unto it?

come to the Lords Supper?

: in which case (because promises are made, and this Sacrament is appointed,
for the relief even of weak and doubting Christians Isai 40. 11 29. 31 Mat. 11.
28 Mat. 12. 20 Mat. 26. 28
) he is to bewail his unbelief Mar. 9. 24
, and labor to have his doubts resolved Acts 2. 57 Acts 16. 30
, and so doing he may and ought to come to the Lords Supper, that he may be
further strengthened Romans 4. 11 1 Cor. 11. 28
.

Q. May any who profess the faith, and desire to come to the Lords Supper, be
kept from it?

consciences, they are to wait for the fruit of it in due time Psalm. 123. Psalm.

, and that even to infants Gen 17, 7, 9 Acts 2. 38. 39 1. Cor 7. 14
; whereas the Lords Supper is to be administered often, in the Elements of bread

humble Advice of the Assembly of Divines, now sitting by Ordinance of
Parliament at Westminster, Concerning Church Government.
The Preface.
JEsus Christ, upon whose shoulders Isa. 9. 6, 7
the Government is, whose name is called Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God,
the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, of the increase of whose
Government and Peace there shall be no end, who sits upon the throne of David,
and upon his Kingdom to order it, and to establish it with Judgment Mat. 28.
18, 19, 20 Ephesians. 1. 20 21, 22, 23 compared with Ephesians. 4, 8, 11. and Psa. 68. 18
and Justice, from henceforth even for ever, having all power given unto him in
Heaven and in Earth by the Father, who raised him from the dead, and set him on
his own Right Hand, far above all Principalities and Power, and Might and
Dominion, and every Name that is named, not only in this World, but also in
that which is to come, and put all things under his feet, and gave him to be
the head over all things to the Church, which is his Body, the fullness of him
that fills all in all; He being ascended up far above all Heavens, that he
might fill all things, received gifts for his Church, and gave offices
necessary for the edification of his Church, and perfecting of his Saints.

Of the Church.
THere is one General Church visible held forth in the New Testament, 1 Cor.
12. 12, 13, 28. together with the rest of the Chapter.

The Ministry, Oracles and Ordinances of the new Testament, are given by Jesus
Christ to the General Church visible, for the gathering and perfecting of it in
this life until his second coming, 1 Cor. 12 28. Ephesians. 4. 4, 5. compared with
verse. 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16. of the same Chapter.

Particular visible Churches, Members of the General Church, are also held
forth in the New Testament, Gal. 1. 21, 22. Rev. 1. 4. 20. and Rev. 2. 1.
Particular Churches in the Primitive times were made up of visible Saints, viz.
Of such as being of age, professed faith in Christ, and obdience unto Christ;
according to the Rule of Faith and Life taught by Christ and his Apostles; And
of their Children, Acts 2. 38, 41. Acts 2 verse. last, compared with Acts 5. 14.
1 Cor. 1. 2. compared with the 2 Corinthians. 9. 13. Acts 2. 39. 1 Cor. 7. 14. Romans
11. 16. and so forward, Mark 10. 14. compared with Matthew. 19. ver. 13, 14. Luke
18. verse. 15, 16.

Of the Officers of the Church.
THe Officers which Christ has appointed for the edification of his Church,
and the perfecting of the Saints, are,

Some extraordinary, as Apostles, Evangelists, and Prophets, which are ceased.

Others ordinary and perpetual, as Pastors, Teachers, and other
Church-Governors and Deacons.

Pastors.
THe Pastor is an ordinary and perpetual Officer in the Church, Jer. 3. 15, 16,
17. Prophesying of the time of the Gospel, 1 Pet. 5. 2, 3, 4. Ephesians. 4. 11, 12,
13.

First, It belongs to his office;

To pray for and with his flock, as the mouth of the people unto God, Acts 6.
2, 3, 4. and 20. 36: Where Preaching and Prayer are joined as several parts of
the same Office, Jam. 5. 14, 15. The Office of the Elder, that is the Pastor,
is to pray for the sick, even in private, to which a blessing is especially
promised, much more therefore ought he to perform this in the public execution
of his Office as a part thereof, 1 Cor. verse. 15, 16.

To read the Scripture publicly, for the proof of which;

1. That the Priests and Levites in the Jewish Church, were trusted with the
public reading of the Word, as is proved, Deuteronomy. 31 9, 10, 11. Neh. 8. 1, 2,
and 13.

2. That the Ministers of the Gospel have as ample a Charge and Commission to
dispense the Word as well as other Ordinances, as the Priests and Levites had
under the Law proved, Isa. 66. 21. Mat. 23 34. where our Savior intituleth the
Officers of the New Testament whom he will send forth by the same names of the
Teachers of the Old.

Which Propositions prove, that therefore (the duty being of a moral nature) it
follows by just consequence, that the public reading of the Scriptures
belongs to the Pastors Office.

To feed the Flock by Preaching of the Word according to which he is to teach,
convince, reprove, exhort and comfort, 1 Timothy 3. 2. 2 Timothy 3. 16, 17. Tit. 19.

To Chatechise, which is a plain laying down the Principles of the Oracles of
God, Heb. 5. 12. or of the Doctrine of Christ, and is a part of Preaching.

To dispense other divine Mysteries, 1 Cor. 4 1, 2.

To administer the Sacraments, Mat. 28 19, 20. Mark 16. 15, 16. 1 Cor. 11 23,
24, 25. compares with 1 Cor. 10. 16.

To bless the People from God, Number. 6. 23, 24, 25, 26. compared with Rev 14. 5
(where the same blessings and Persons from whom they come are expressly
mentioned) Isai. 66. 21. Where under the names of Priests and Levites to be
continued under the Gospel, are meant Evangelicall Pastors, who therefore are
by Office to bless the People, Deuteronomy. 10. 8. 2 Cor. 13, 14. Ephesians. 1. 2.

To take care of the Poor, Acts 1^. 30. and 4. 34, 35, 36, 37. and 6. 2, 3, 4.
1 Cor. 16. 1, 2, 3, 4. Gal. 2, 9, 10.

And he has also a ruling power over the Flock as a Pastor, 1 Timothy 5. 17. Acts
20. 17. and 28. 1 These. 5, 12. Heb. 13. 7. 17.

Teacher or Doctor.
THe Scripture does hold out the name and title of Teacher, as well as of the
Pastor, 1 Cor. 12. verse 28. Ephesians 4. verse 11.

Who is also a Minister of the Word as well as the Pastor, and has power of
administration of the Sacraments.

The Lord having given different gifts, and diverse excercises according to
these gifts, in the Ministry of the Word, Romans 12. 6, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12, 1, 4, 5,
6, 7. Though these different gifts may meet in, and accordingly be exercised by
one and the same Minister, 1 Cor. 14. 3. 2 Timothy 4. 2. Tit. 1. 9 yet where be
several Ministers in the same Congregation, they may be designed to several
employments, according to the different gifts in which each of them does most
excel, Rom: 12. 6, 7, 8. 1 Pet. 4. 10, 11. And he that does more excel in
exposition of Scripture, in teaching sound Doctrine, and in convincing gain
sayers, then he does in application, and is accordingly employed therein, may
be called a Teacher or Doctor, (the places alleged by the Notation of the Word
does prove the Proposition;) Nevertheless, where is but one Minister in a
particular Congregation, he is to perform, so far as he is able, the whole work
of the Ministry, as appears in the 2 Timothy 4. 2. Tit. 1 9: before alleged, 1 Timothy 6* 2.

A Teacher or Doctor is of most excellent use in Schools and Universities, as
of old in the Schools of the Prophets, and at Jerusalem, where Gamaliel and
others taught as Doctors.

Other Church-Governors.
AS there were in the Jewish Church Elders of the People, joined with the
Priests and Levites in the Government of the Church (as appears in the 2 Chronicles. 19. 8, 9, 10.) So Christ, who has instituted a Government, and
Governors Ecclesiastical in the Church, has furnished some in his Church,
beside the Ministers of the Word, with gifts for Government, and with
commission to execute the same when called thereunto, who are to join with the
Minister in the Government of the Church, Romans 12. 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12. 28. which
Officers reformed Churches commonly call Elders.

Deacons.
THe Scripture does hold out Deacons as distinct Officers in the Church, Phil
1. 1. 1 Timothy 3. 8. whose Office is perpetual, 1 Timothy 3. 8. to verse 15. Acts 6.
1, 2, 3, 4. To whose Office it belongs not to preach the Word or administer the
Sacraments, but to take special care in distributing to the necessities of the
poor, Acts 6. 1, 2, 3, 4. and the verses following.

Of particular Congregations.
IT is lawful and expedient that there be fixed Congregations, that is, a
certain company of Christians to meet in one Assembly ordinarily for public
Worship. When Believers multiply to such a number, that they cannot
conveniently meet in one place, it is lawful and expedient that they should be
divided into distinct and fixed Congregations, for the better administration of
such Ordinances as belong unto them, and the discharge of mutual duties, 1 Cor.
14. 26. Let all things be done unto edifying, and verses 33. and 40.

The ordinary way of dividing Christians into distinct Congregations, and most
expedient for edification, is by the respective bounds of their dwellings.

First, Because they who dwell together, being bound to all kind of Moral
duties Deuteronomy. 15, 7 11
one to another, have the better opportunity thereby to discharge them; which
Mat. 22. 39 Mat. 5, 17
Moral tie is perpetual, for Christ came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfill
it.

Secondly, The Communion of Saints must be so ordered as may stand with the
most convenient use of the Ordinances, and discharge of Moral duties without
respect of persons, 1 Cor. 14, 26. Let all things be done unto edifying, Heb.
10, 24, 25. James 2. 1, 2.

Thirdly, The Pastor and People must so nearly co-habite together, as that they
may mutually perform their duties each to other with most convenience.

In this company some must be set apart to bear Office.

Of the Officers of a particular Congregation.
FOr Officers in a single Congregation, there ought to be one at the least,
both to labor in the Word and Doctrine, and to rule, Prove. 29, 18. 1 Timothy 5,
17. Heb 13, 7.

It is also requisite, that there should be others to join in Government, 1
Cor. 12, 28.

And likewise it is requisite, that there be others to take special care for
the relief of the poor, Acts 6, 2, 3.

The number of each of which is to be proportioned according to the condition
of the Congregation.

These Officers are to meet together at convenient and set times, for the
well-ordering of the affairs of that Congregation, each according to his Office.

It is most expedient, that in these meetings one, whose Office is to labor in
the Word and Doctrine, do moderate in their proceedings, 1 Timothy 5, 17.

Of the Ordinance in a particular Congregation.
THe Ordinances in a single Congregation, are Prayer, Thanksgiving, and singing
of Psalms, 1 Timothy 2, ver. 1. 1 Cor. 14, 15, 16. The Word read (although there
follow no immediate explication of what is read) the Word expounded and
applied, Catechizing, the Sacraments administered, Collection made for the poor,
dismissing the people with a blessing.

Of Church Government, and the several sorts of Assemblies for the same.
CHrist has instituted a Government, and Governors Ecclesiastical in the
Church, to that purpose the Apostles did immediately receive the keys from the
hand of Jesus Christ, and did use and exercise them in all the Churches of the
world upon all occasions.

And Christ has since continually furnished some in his Church with gifts of
Government, and with commission to execute the same when called thereunto.

It is lawful and agreeable to the Word of God, that the Church be governed by
several sorts of Assemblies, which are Congregational, Classical, and Synodical.

Of the power in Common of all these Assemblies.
IT is lawful and agreeable to the word of God, that the several Assemblies,
before mentioned, have power to convent and call before them any person within
their several bounds, whom the Ecclesiastical business, which is before them,
does concern, proved by Math. Chap. 18.

They have power to hear and determine such causes and differences as do
orderly come before them.

It is lawful and agreeable to the Word of God, that all the said Assemblies
have some power to dispense Church Censures.

Of Congregational Assemblies, that is, The meeting of the ruling Officers of a
particular Congregation for the Government thereof.
THe ruling Officers of a particular Congregation have power authoritatively,
to call before them any member of the Congregation, as they shall see just
occasion.

To enquire into the knowledge and spiritual estate of the several members of
the Congregation.

To admonish and rebuke.

Which three branches are proved by Heb. 13. 17. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12, 13. Ezekiel. 34.
4.

Authoritative suspension from the Lords Table, of a person not yet cast out of
the Church, is agreeable to the Scripture.

First, Because the Ordinance it self must not be profaned.

Secondly, Because we are charged to withdraw from these that walk disorderly.

Thirdly, Because of the great sin and danger, both to him that comes
unworthily, and also to the whole Church, Mat. 7. 6. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 6, 14, 15. 1
Cor. 11. 27. to the end of the chap. compared with Jude, verse. 23. 1 Timothy 5.
22. And there was power and authority under the Old Testament, to keep unclean
persons from holy things, Levit. 13. 5. Numb. 9. 7. 2 Chronicles. 23. 19.

The like power and authority, by way of Analogy, continues under the New
Testament.

The Ruling Officers of a particular Congregation, have power authoritatively
to suspend from the Lords Table a person not yet cast out of the Church.

First, Because those who have authority to judge of, and admit such as are fit
to receive the Sacrament, have authority to keep back such as shall be found
unworthy.

Secondly, Because it is an Ecclesiastical business of ordinary practice
belonging to that Congregation.

When Congregations are divided and fixed, they need all mutual help one from
another, both in regard of their intrinsecal weaknesses and mutual dependence;
As also, in regard of enemies from without.

Of Classical Assemblies.
THe Scripture does hold out a Presbytery in a Church, both in the first
Epistle to Timothy, Chap. 4. verse. 14. and in Acts 15. verses 2, 4 6.

A Presbytery consists of Ministers of the Word, and such other public
Officers as are agreeable to, and warranted by the Word of God, to be Church
Governors, to join with the Ministers in the Government of the Church, as
appears, Romans 12. 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12. 28.

The Scripture does hold forth, that many particular Congregations may be under
one Presbyterial Government.

This Proposition is proved by instances.

First, Of the Church of Jerusalem,

This appears thus.

First, The Church of Jerusalem consists of more Congregations then one,

By the multitude of Believers mentioned in diverse,

Both before the dispersion of the Believers there by means of the persecution
(mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, Chap. 8. in the beginning thereof)
witness Chap. 1. verse 11. and 2. v. 41, 46, 47. and 4. 4. and 5: 14. and Chap.
6. of the same book of the Acts, verses 1, 7.

And also after the dispersion, Acts 9. 31. Chap. 12. ^4. and Chap. 21. ver.
20. of the same book.

Secondly, By the many Apostles and other Preachers in the Church of Jerusalem;
And if there were but one Congregation there, then each Apostle preached but
seldom; which will not consist with Chap. 6. verse 2. of the same book of the
Acts of the Apostles.

Thirdly, The diversity of languages amongst the Believers, mentioned both in
the second and sixth Chapters of the Acts, does argue more Congregations then
one in that Church.

Secondly, All those Congregations Acts 8. 1. and Chapter 2. 47. compared with
Chap. 5. 11, and 12. 5. and 15. 4. of the same book.

Secondly, The Elders of the Church are mentioned, Acts 11. 30. and 15. 4, 6,
22. and 21. 17, 18. of the same book.

Thirdly, The Apostles did the ordinary Acts of Presbyters, as Presbyters in
that Kirk, which proves a Presbyterial Church before the dispersion, Acts 6.

Fourthly, The several Congregations in Jerusalem being one Church, the Elders
of that Church are mentioned as meeting together for acts of Government, Acts
11. 30. and 15. 4, 6, 22. and 21. 17, 18. and so forward, which proves, that
those several Congregations were under one Presbyterial Government.

And whether these Congregations were fixed or not fixed, in regard of Officers
or Members, it is all one as to the truth of the Proposition.

Nor does there appear any material difference betwixt the several
Congregations in Jerusalem, and the many Congregations now in the ordinary
condition of the Church, as to the point of fixedness required of Officers or
Members.

Thirdly, Therefore the Scripture does

Secondly, By the instance of the Ephesus, for,

1, That they were more Congregations then one in the Church of Ephesus,
appears by Acts 20, 31. where is mention of Paul's continuance at Ephesus in
Preaching for the space of three years, and Acts 19, 18, 19, 20. where the
special effect of the Word is mentioned, and verse 10, and 17, of the same
Chapter, where is a distinction of Jews and Greeks, and 1 Cor. 16. 8, 9. where
a reason of Paul's stay at Ephesus until Pentecost, and verse 19, where is
mention of a particular Church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla then at
Ephesus, as appears Acts 18. 19, 24, 26. all which laid together does prove,
that the multitudes of Believers did make more Congregations then one in the
Church of Ephesus.

2. That there were many Elders over these many Congregations, as one Flock,
appears, Acts 20, 17, 25, 28, 30, 36, 37.

3. That these many Congregations were one Church, and that they were under one
Presbyterial Government, appears, Rev. 2. the first six verses, joined with
Acts 20. 17, 18.

Of Synodical Assemblies.
THe Scripture does hold out another sort of Assemblies for the Government of
the Church beside Classical and Congregational, all which we call Synodical,
Acts 15. Pastors and Teachers, and other Church Governors (as also other fit
persons, when it shall be deemed expedient) are Members of those Assemblies
which we call Synodical, where they have a lawful Calling thereunto.

Synodical Assemblies may lawfully be of several sorts, as Provincial,
National, and Ecumenical.

It is lawful and agreeable to the Word of God, that there be a subordination
of Congregational, Classical, Provincial, and National Assemblies for the
Government of the Church.

Of Ordination of Ministers.
UNder the head of Ordination of Ministers is to be considered, either the
Doctrine of Ordination, or the Power of it.

Touching the Doctrine of Ordination.
NO man ought to take upon him the Office of a Minister of the Word without a
lawful Calling, John 3. 27. Romans 10. 14, 15: Jer. 14 14. Heb. 5 4.

Ordination is always to be continued in the Church, Titus 1. 5. 1 Timothy 5. 21,
22.

Ordination is the solemn setting apart of a person to some public Church
office, Numb. 8. 10, 11, 14, 19, 22. Acts 6 3, 5, 6.

Every Minister of the Word is to be ordained by imposition of hands, and
Prayer with Fasting, by those Preaching Presbyters to whom it does belong, 1 Timothy 5. 22. Acts 14. 23. Acts 13. 3.

It is agreeable to the Word of God, and very expedient, that such as are to be
ordained Ministers, be designed to some particular Church or other Ministerial
charge, Acts 14, 23. Tit 1, 5. Acts 20, 17, and 28.

He that is to be ordained Minister, must be duly qualified both for life and
Ministerial abilities, according to the rules of the Apostle, 1 Timothy 3, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 and Tit. 1, 6, 7, 8, 9.

He is to be examined and approved by those by whom he is to be ordained, 1 Timothy 3, 7, 10, and Chap 5, 22.

No man is to be ordained a Minister for a particular Congregation, if they of
that Congregation can show just cause of exception against him, 1 Timothy 3, 2.
Tit. 1, 7.

Touching the Power of Ordination.
ORdination is the act of a Presbytery, 1 Timothy 4, 14.

The power of ordering the whole work of Ordination is in the whole Presbytery,
which, when it is over more Congregations then one, whether those Congregations
be fixed or not fixed, in regard of Officers or Members, it is indifferent as
to the point of Ordination; 1 Timothy 4, 14.

It is very requisite that no single Congregation that can conveniently
associate, do assume to it self all and sole power in Ordination.

1. Because there is no example in Scripture, that any single Congregation
which might conveniently associate, did assume to it self all and sole power in
Ordination, neither is there any rule which may warrant such a practice.

2. Because there is in Scripture example of an Ordination in a Presbytery over
diverse Congregations; as in the Church of Jerusalem, where were many
Congregations, th^se many Congregations were under one Presbytery, and this
Presbytery did ordain.

The Preaching Presbyters orderly associated either in Cities or neighboring
Villages, are those to whom the imposition of Hands does appertain for those
Congregations within their bounds respectively.

Some other particulars concerning Church Government, do yet remain unfinished,
which shall be, with all convenient speed, prepared and presented to this
honorable House.

TO THE Right Honorable THE Lords and Commons Assembled in PARLIAMENT, The
humble Advice of the Assembly of Divines, now sitting at Westminster,
Concerning The Doctrinal part of Ordination of MINISTERS.
NO man ought to take upon him the office of a Minister of the Word John 3, 27*
Romans 10, 14, 15. Jer. 14, 14. Heb 5, 4.

Ordination is always to be continued Titus 1, 5, 1 Timothy 5, 21, 22.

Ordination is the solemn setting apart Numb. 8, 10, 11, 14, 19, 22. Acts 6, 3,
5, 6.

Every Minister of the Word is to be Tim. 5, 22. Acts 14, 23. and 13, 3.

The power of ordering the whole Tim. 4, 14.

It is agreeable to the Word of God, Acts 14, 23. Tit. 1, 5. Acts 20, 17, and
28.

He that is to be ordained Minister, Tim. 3. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Tit. 1. 5, 6, 7, 8,
9.

He is to be examined and approved of Tim. 3, 7, 10. and 5, 22.

No man is to be ordained a Minister for a particular Congregation, if they of
that Congregation can show just cause of exception against him, 1 Timothy 3, 2.
Tit 1, 7.

Preaching Presbyters orderly associated, Tim. 4. 14.

In extraordinary cases, something extraordinary Chron. 29. 34, 35, 36. 2 Chronicles. 30. 2* 3, 4, 5.

There is at this time (as we humbly

The Directory for Ordination of Ministers.
IT being manifest by the Word of God, that no man ought to take upon him the
Office of a Minister of the Gospel, until he be lawfully called and ordained
thereunto: And that the work of Ordination is to be performed with all due
care, wisdom, gravity and solemnity, we humbly tender these Directions as
requisite to be observed.

First, He that is to be ordained, being

Which being considered by the Presbytery,

The Rules for Examination are these.
1. That the party examined be dealt withal in a brotherly way, with mildness
of spirit, and with special respect to the gravity, modesty and quality of
every one.

2. He shall be examined touching his skill in the Original Tongues, and his
trial to be made by reading the Hebrew and Greek Testaments, and rendering some
portion of some into Latin; and if he be defective in them, enquiry shall be
made the more strictly after his other learning, and whether he has skill in
Logic and Philosophy.

3. What Authors in Divinity he has read, and is best acquainted with; and
trial shall be made in his knowledge of the grounds of Religion, and ability to
defend the Orthodox Doctrine contained in them, against all unsound and
erroneous opinions, especially these of the present age; of his skill in the
sense and meaning of such places of Scripture as shall be proposed unto him, in
cases of Conscience, and in the Chronology of the Scripture, and the
Ecclesiastical History.

4. If he has not before preached in public, with approbation of such as are
able to judge, he shall, at a competent time assigned him, expound before the
Presbytery such a place of Scripture as shall be given him.

5. He shall also, within a competent time, frame a discourse in Latin upon
such a common place or Controversy in Divinity as shall be assigned him, and
exhibit to the Presbytery such Theses as express the sum thereof, and maintain
a Dispute upon them.

6. He shall Preach before the People, the Presbytery, or some of the Ministers
of the Word appointed by them, being present.

7. The proportion of his gifts in relation to the place unto which he is
called, shall be considered.

8. Beside the trial of his gifts in Preaching, he shall undergo an examination
in the Premises two several days, and more; if the Presbytery shall judge it
necessary.

9. And as for him that has been formerly ordained a Minister, and is to be
removed to another charge, he shall bring a Testimonial of his Ordination, and
of his abilities and Conversation, whereupon his fitness for that place shall
be tried by his Preaching there, (if it shall be judged necessary) by a further
examination of him.

In all which he being approved, he is

In the last of these three days, appointed signify, that such a day a
competent number of the Members of that Congregation nominated by themselves,
shall appear before the Presbytery, to give their consent and approbation to
such a man to be their Minister, or otherwise to put in with all Christian
discretion and meekness what exceptions they have against him, and if upon the
day appointed there be no just exception against him; but the people give their
consent, then the presbytery shall proceed to ordination.

Upon the day appointed for Ordination,

After the Sermon, the Minister who now to be ordained concerning his faith in
Christ Jesus, and his persuasion of the truth of the Reformed Religion
according to the Scripture; His sincere intentions and ends in desiring to
enter into this Calling; His diligence in Praying, Reading, Meditation,
Preaching, Ministering the Sacraments, Discipline, and doing all Ministerial
Duties toward his Charge; His Zeal and Faithfulness in maintaining the Truth
of the Gospel, and Unity of the Church against Error and Schism; His care that
himself and his Family may be unblameable and examples to the Flock; His
willingness and humility in meekness of Spirit, to submit unto the admonitions
of his Brethren, and Discipline of the Church; And his resolution to continue
in his duty against all trouble and persecution.

In all which having declared himself, professed his willingness and promised

Which being mutually promised by the People, the Presbytery, or the Ministers
sent from them for Ordination, shall solemnly set him apart to the Office and
Work of the Ministry, by laying their hands on him, which is to be accompanied
with a short Prayer or Blessing, to this effect.

Thankefully acknowledging the great mercy of God, in sending Jesus Christ for
the redemption of his people, and for his ascension to the right hand of God
the Father, and thence pouring out his Spirit, and giving gifts to Men,
Apostles, Evangelists, Prophets, Pastors, and Teachers, for the gathering and
building up of his Church, and for sitting and inclining this man to this great
Work; To entreat him to fit him with his holy Spirit, to give him (who in his
name we thus set apart to this holy service) to fulfill the Work of his Ministry
in all things, that he may both save himself and his people committed to his
charge.

This or the like form of prayer and carry themselves to him as to their
Minister in the Lord, according to their solemn promise made before; and so by
prayer commending both him and his Flock to the Grace of God; after singing of
a Psalm, let the Assembly be dismissed with a Blessing.

If a Minister be designed to a Congregation, England, which we hold for
substance to be valid, and not to be disclaimed by any who have received it;
Then there being a cautious proceeding in matters of Examination, let him be
admitted without any new Ordination.

And in case any Person already ordained Scotland, or in any other reformed
Church, be designed to a Congregation in England, he is to bring from that
Church to the Presbytery here, within which that Congregation is, a sufficient
testimonial of his Ordination, of his life and conversation while he lived with
them, and of the causes of his removal; And to undergo such a trial of his
fitness and sufficiency, and to have the same course held with him, in other
particulars, as is set down in the rule immediately going before touching
Examination and Admission.

That Records be carefully kept in the

That no Money or Gift, of what kind

Thus far of ordinary rules and course of Ordination in the ordinary way; That
which concerns the extraordinary way, requisite to be now practiced, follows.
In these present exigences, while we any with safety sent unto them for such a
solemn trial as was before mentioned in the ordinary Rules, especially when
there can be no Presbytery near unto them, to whom they may address themselves,
or which may come or send to them a fit man to be ordained in that
Congregation, and for that people; And yet notwithstanding, it is requisite
that Ministers be ordained for them, by some; who being set apart themselves
for the work of the Ministry, have power to join in the setting apart of
others, who are found fit and worthy. In those cases, until by Gods blessing
the aforesaid difficulties may be in some good measure removed, let some godly
Ministers in or about the City of London, be designed by public authority; who
being associated, may ordain Ministers for the City, and the Vicinity, keeping
as near to the ordinary Rules forementioned, as possible they may; And let this
association be for no other intent or purpose, but only for the work of
Ordination.

Let the like association be made by

Let such as are chosen or appointed for the service of the Armies or Navy
London, or some others in the Country.

Let them do the like, when any man shall duly and lawfully be recomended
