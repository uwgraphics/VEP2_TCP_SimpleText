THE NEW LETANIE.
FRom an extemporary prayer, and a godly ditty,
From the churlish Governor of a City,
From the power of a Country Committee.
Libera nos Domine.
From the Turk, the Pope, and the Scottish Nation;
From being governed by Proclamation:
And from an old Protestant, quite out of fashion.
Libera etc.
From meddling with those that are out of our reaches,
From a fighting Priest, and a S^uldier that preaches;
From an Ignoramus that writes, and a woman that teaches
Libera etc.
From the doctrine of deposing of a King,
From the Directory, or any such thing:
From a fine new Marriage without a ring.
Libera etc.
From a City that yields at the first summons,
From plundering of goods, either man's, or woman's;
Or having to do with the House of Commons.
Libera etc.
From a stumbling Horse, that tumbles ore and ore,
From ushering a Lady, or walking before:
From an English-Irish-Rebell, newly come over.
Libera etc.
From Compounding, or hanging in a silken halter,
From oaths and covenants, and being pounded in a mortar,
From Contributions, or Free Quarter.
Libera etc.
From Moldy bread, and Mustie beer,
From a Holidayes fast, and a fridayes good cheer;
From a Brotherhood, and a she Cavileer.
Libera etc.
From Nich. Neuter, for you, and for you,
From Thomas Turn-coate that will never prove true,
From a reverend Rabbi that is worse then a Jew.
Libera etc.
From a Country Justice that still looks big,
From swallowing of the Italian fig;
Or learning of the Scottish Jigge.
Libera etc.
From being taken in a disguise,
From believing of the Printed lies;
From the Devil, and from the Excise.
Libera etc.
From a broken Pate with a Pint pot,
For fighting for I know not what;
And from a friend as false as a Scot*
Libera etc.
From one that speaks no sense, yet talks all that he can,
From an old woman, and a Parliament man:
From an Anabaptist, and a Presbiter John.
Libera etc.
From Irish Rebels, and Welsh hubbub-men,
From Independents, and their Tubmen;
From Sheriffs, Bailiffes, and their Clubmen.
Libera etc.
From one that cares not what he says,
From trusting one that never pay'th:
From a private Preacher, and a Public Faith.
Libera etc.
From a vapouring Horse, and a Roundhead in Buffe,
From roaring Jack Cavee, with money little enough:
From Beads, and such Idolatrous stuff.
Libera etc.
From Holydaies, and all that is holy,
From May-poles, and Fiddlers, and all that is Jolly:
From Latin, and Learning, since that is a folly.
Libera etc.
And now to make an end of all,
I wish the Roundheads had a fall;
Or else were hanged in Goldsmiths-hall.
Amen. Benedicat Dominus.
FINIS.
