ANNOTATIONS UPON THE LATE PROTESTATION: OR, A TRUE CHARACTER of an
affectionate mind to King and Parliament.
Fear God and honor the King.
HEre is a command from above by the Supreme power touching himself and his
Lieutenant, which Lieutenant of the Lords being his Majesty, whose power
coming from above, and being Viceroy to the Supreme, he is to be obeyed in all
just commands in obedience to the highest powers, For the powers that be, are
ordained of God, and they that shall resist the powers, resists the Ordinance
of God.

And S. Peter teaches us in his first Epistle second Chapter, ver. 13. That we
should Submit our selves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether
it be to King as Supreme, or unto Governors as the two Honorable Houses of
Parliament, which are called by the King and set up by him for the punishment
of evil doers, and for the reward of them that do well: For so is the will of
God that with well-doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.

Now for he whomsoever he be that shall set himself against the Parliament a
pleader and great pains taker for the King and Commonwealth, who by them were
chosen and with their approbation to stand to their judgment what they shall
in their wisdoms do in our behalf, I say, he that shall set himself in the
least manner to wrong a member of that Honorable House of Lords or Commons in
their lawful employments by either of the Houses for the honor of God, and
his Religion, safety of his Majesty's person, and the good of his country is
an absolute traitor.

For he that will first choose his advocate and then betray him, touches the
apple of Gods own eye, and it were better for him that a millstone were hanged
about his neck, and he cast into the depth of the sea.

How mad then are those Cavaliers who are without grace or the fear of the
Almighty, which no doubt but are borne in some shires or counties of this
Kingdom, and have both Knights of their shires and Burgesses of their
Corporations to stand for their good and welfare as well as for the good of the
very wives of their own bosom, and children of their own bodies, we must not
then kill these men, seeing we have chosen them for our substitutes in
Parliament, we must not hurt them, God forbid we should; and they that shall go
about or attempt, or advise upon such ungodly actions, tending to the wrong of
his blessed Majesty or the Parliament, now shall they think or look to
escape the vengeance of Eternal fire, for S. John in his first Epistle, Chap.
3. ver. 15. says, Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer, and ye know
(says he) that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him; and in the
second Chapter of the same Epistle he says, If any man love the world, the
love of the Father is not in him, and if the love of the Father is not in that
man that loves the world, then surely the Father hates and abhors that man
that will set upon his neighbor, brother or countryman, and kill him out of a
mere love to the things of this world, and for the things of this world,
absolutely the men of these courses love not God nor his Religion, if they say
they do, they are liars; S. John in his first Epistle, Chap. 4. ver. 20. so
says, For he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love
God, whom he has not seen? Now to run against the 6. Commandment of God
Almighty wilfully is no small sin, and to kick against so strong a thorn
issuing from so great a hand.

And whosoever he be, that shall not grant his Majesty his right, and that
which does truly belong unto Caesar is an absolute enemy to the King and
Commonwealth, and a sower of sedition, for our Savior Christ himself says,
Give unto Casar that which is Caesar's, and to God that which is Gods, that is
that which belongs to the Lord in his due Worship, and that to him must be
given; and that which is the due of the people, they ought to have by the very
same rule of our Savior Christ: for he that would have Caesar have his due,
wills also that God in his members should have their right also, the one as well
as the other, the Lord is so merciful that he would have both have their due
rights without going together by the ears, and they that do otherwise are
Pharisaicall like, making a question what belongs unto Caesar, and what not, as
if people being masters in Israel and knew not these things, which if they did
not, then they were not liable to the censure of our Savior Christ, who
tells all and every one that knows the will of his master and does it not,
shall be beaten with many stripes; and what simple Gentleman is there in
combustion and in traitorisme, setting his Majesty against the Ordinance of
Parliament, but is sensible of a Conviction by law and guilty of high treason
against the State, and that most palpably; for he that will choose his friend in
trust for him in Parliament, in hope of his fidelity to him, as well as for
his own self, wife and children, and if any of these men or counties shall
rise up against any of his or their Parliament men advocates, or any of his
neighboring counties advocates and Parliament men, and not be content to stand
to the judgment of their best endeavors, and to help them against all their
opposites and against unequal and unworthy persons, they are much to be
blamed, and traitors to the State, who will not justify and assist the Houses
of Parliament in their Councels and judgments against all opposition, contrary
to the Law of the Kingdom.

And Saint Paul for his part he wishes them to be marked that are the cause of
the division both in the Church and Commonwealth, and they that trouble the
true Protestant Religion, the way to everlasting life; the very same Apostle
wishes, they were even cut off.

And to trample upon the Crown, which God forbid any one should, it is to touch
the Lords anointed, and there is an express command against this from the
Lord, who says, Touch not mine anointed and do my Prophets no harm: and no
honest man will do this, that is, to wrong his Majesty, for if his Majesty
has not his immunities, how shall we be settled in our proprieties.

It is against reason and civil honesty for Judges to take all the right that
is due to them to be sure, and not to allow their Neighbors their just rights
and privileges. Or is it equity for a Taylour to look on one side of him,
where his hell is under his shopboard to throw his piece of silver-cloth, he
has over and above his Masters work, and not look on the other side of him
to think it is his Customers, he must not take it, which to do is blindness
without seeing honesty.

Now for as much as his Majesty and the Parliament has tied themselves each to
other in an Abraham-like Covenant, not to pass the limits of their own bounds,
in which they have set and tied voluntarily their own selves, and has erected
to all the world in print a Protestation to that purpose and both parties
interchangeably by solemn vows and promises in the presence of Almighty God
has vowed to stand fast and to stick in honor each to other, till life shall
depart; and that they will hold the one to the other for better for worse, for
richer for poorer, goods and all laid down in the Covenant of their promise one
for the other, for the maintenance of the true Protestant Religion, and both
their Honors, safety, and Privileges each of other: And if these two new
betrothed turtle Doves by so solemn a vow made between themselves, shall peck
one at another, as they begin too much to do, (God of his mercy help them) and
be impatient one with another, and not keep their bills out of another eyes,
they will too much wrong themselves, like man and wife who quickly and too
often forget themselves in their matrimonial Contract, and by their long
jangling at last part, and lay the key under doors and run away. So if the
King and Parliament shall forget their so serious Protestation, vow and
profession one truly taken for and in the behalf of the other, in declaration
of the tenderness of honor and true affection each to other, and now not
bearing one with another in love, nor submit in this pleasant knot of agreement
in mind each with the other like Abraham and Lot, this were deplorable, (says
the Divine) and wonderful. Here the Uncle for quietness sake submits his
honor in his hoary hairy head to his green headed Nephew with a motion that
there may be no falling out because (said he) we are Brethren.

So his Majesty and his Honorable Houses of Parliament what an easy matter
were it for these two Turtle Doves, sympathizing in affection, say but so much
as Abraham and Lot did one to the other, and why, because by faith surely
Brethren in Christ; all then would be ended if but this spirit of humility
were in them both. There was a very low submitting spirit between the Scots
and us, and shall not there be the like between his Majesty and his nearest
people; will his Majesty be worse to his own and best loving people than the
Scots. And if we shall fall out upon earth will not the Father in Heaven be
angry, who has sent his Gospel of peace amongst us teaching of us that if
possible, we should have peace with all men, will it not then displease the
Lord that we have learned no more Religion, nor be no more endued with faith
and patience, but go together to shed the blood one of another, to the shame
of our Nation, and hissing to other Kingdoms, let it not be told in Gath, nor
published in Ashkelon. These beginnings of war on neither side are fruits of
the Spirit, it may be thought, for the fruits of the Spirit are love, patience,
meekness, forgiving one another, forbearing one with another. And let it be
remembered what Abner said to Joab, shall the sword devour for ever, how long
will it be ere thou call back the people from following of their Brethren,
know thou not that it will be bitterness in the end? so it is wished by the
people of the Lord, that blood touch not blood. And Sir Benjamen Ruddyards
speech is excellent to this purpose and worthy of note, the Parliament
undoubtedly will not do amiss to hearken to those grave lines and worthy
speech of his.

H^s first Speech was for Religion, and the settling of the Church of God, in
the very first place of all but it is not I think a man may be bold to say,
followed.

Now his second Speech is against shedding of blood, the defiling of the Land.
To have a whole Land desiled with blood, a most wonderful and deplorable
thing; and Christians blood is of a deep dye, were it amiss then if green
heads would take gravitie along with them in all their actions, who most
resemble the Image of their maker, and hoary hairs is a crown of glory being
found in the way of righteousness; and to hear a grave old religious and wise
Gentleman speak and giving advice and instruction, it is as it were, if
seriously considered, God Almighty himself in a Crown of glory giving good
counsel to the younger. Was it not the Lord himself spoke with the people of
Israel in the mouth of Moses; and was it not the Lord in Joseph spoke unto his
Brethren concerning his bones, and was it not the Lord in Solomon which spoke
unto the people concerning the building of a house to his name; and certainly
it is the Lord that speaks from the mouth of wise and grave righteous men to
the younger sort to learn wisdom.

And if a Crown of glory shall not be heard speak who can one better hear;
Green heads desire to be heard, some for their own ends, and some for their
own applause in the world, but an ancient grave man speaking, questionless
looks not either for favor, or affection in the right hand or on the left but
strait forward because he is going forward to God Almighty to receive his pay
for the pains of his labor whose works shall follow him.

And so much for the hearing of gravitie: Now for that we have taken a
Protestation, every one ought seriously to consider the burden of a vow is upon
us, and that vow too, in which is included that we should endeavor and study
the peace of the three Kingdoms, and yet notwithstanding now so solemn
Protestation in the sight of God and man, touching amity and peace in this our
Kingdom, yet there is a thousand times more rumors of wars now then before
our Protestation. What were we like Peter, strong in the faith when we made
this Protestation, and now when we should stick close to it, be weak like Peter
not remembering we have made a Covenant with the Lord, not only to hate
Idolatry and to decline from it as much as in us lies, but also includes the
undertakers thereof every one that he should study and labor for peace so much
as in every one of us lies, and seriously consider of our Protestation, and be
ever and always, now and then looking upon it, and look up unto our Savior
Christ as he looked back upon Peter, and pray to him that we may keep our
resolution.

And it is very good for the Cavaliers about the King seriously to consider of
it and so to do, or otherwise any that shall attempt his Majesty to take up
arms against his Parliament, and ask themselves if they have not taken the
Protestation, if not, it were good they did, and not divide themselves against
the body of the Kingdom by flattering of his Majesty to go against his
Parliament; and they that have taken it, let them consider a vow is upon them.

Apparently the Marquess of Harford and Lord Paulet has broken down the
ridges of their so serious Protestation, in breaking of his Majesty's peace in
falling upon the Yeomanrie in Somersetshire. Now what more displeasing to God
Almighty than breach of Covenants and of peace one to the other, when they
shall take the Lord to be a witness against them of their untruths one to the
other; then what a case are those Gentlemen in, (let them call themselves to
remembrance, that are with the King and the Marquess o^ Harford and the Lord
Paulet, who have broken the Covenant of peace before God and the people; and
them that do intend the least thought of dishonor to the Kings Parliament,
have they not seriously taken the Protestation, in which is included the peace
of the Kingdom, honor of Religion, King and Parliament, and the vow and
protestation taken for the honor of the one, is the same vow and protestation
for the honor of the other; and they that shall vow, and yet in show hold for
the honor of the head, and not the body, dishonours the head by flattery, by
endeavoring to set it off from the body by seditious and evil counsel, and
they that go about any such thing, do greatly dishonor their Country and
Kingdom, whose own houses by sin is laid wast, so they would have others
also; For the Head has called the body politic of the Kingdom together,
desiring the same to be joyn^^ to its head for its help, comfort and lifting of
it up in his straits, who was ready to fall, and weary with holding up, looking
upon the Scots, like Moses hands against the Amalekites, that Aaron and Hur was
feign to take the pains for him to hold them up; and now the Aarons and the
Hurs of our Kingdom being called upon the Mount, I mean to the Parliament, to
consolate and lift up the head of our Sovereign, and so long as our Aarons and
Hurs are upon the Mount, and our Head and Sovereign lies his head upon their
shoulders they by the blessing of God will bear him out of the bitter waters of
Marah, and sweet shall be his rest. I will flatly forbid the bloodthirsty
Cavaliers say so much, upon whom if his Majesty repose, is to be feared it will
be but a pillow of briars and thorns bespattred with blood. Now if there be any
that shall be so ungodly that has taken this Protestation for the honor of
King and Parliament, and yet shall perform but half his vow, and half his
worship and honor, but to one instead of both, who have indeed inseparably
united themselves by their solemn vow and Protestation which no way they can
reverse, and seek to take away his Majesty's favor and affection from his
Aarons and Hurs, and from reposing upon his own Parliament, persuading of his
Majesty to hearken to the dammee blades of the time, the way of undoing his
Kingdom, they may go and take Ananias and Saphira by the hand, and it is
thought some have tasted of the same sudden death they did; And my Lord
Marquess, it is conceived, has very hardly leapt this pit-fall, and if Paulet
escape and many more, they have great cause to magnify the mercy and patience
of God toward such wretches.

And for Kings, Solomon he says, It is an abomination for them not to hold and
keep Covenant, vows and Protestations. And has not Spain made her self
more hateful to the Kingdom of England and other Nations, nay to the very
Heathen by the breach of her truce and Covenants, then ever otherwise she would
have done, this verifies the truth of the word of the Lord, which says, It is
odious for Kings to lie. And in the 5. of Eccles. it is said, It is better for
a man not to vow, than to vow and not to pay, for God takes not pleasure in
such kind of weak Protestations, nor people who are rashly taken up with the
mouth, and no more think upon them with hearts, but bids us pay that which we
have vowed; And I pray God we may all so do, and that the Lord may delight in
us to do us good.

And this by the way, he is the true hearted man that is for the King and
Parliament, and all other are merely insinuating and wicked flatterers, aiming
at a little deceitful favor to accomplish their own ends, which at the best
is bad enough, as my Lord of Straffords was, who with all his deep council
holding so much against the Commonwealth, and endevoring to bring in an
Arbitrary government, contrary to the liberty of the Subject, went to the grave
without his head, a wise man would think it a very fair example to keep out of
Princes books, and be not so vile as to advise Kings against their Subjects,
from whom they have under God their daily bread both King and ill flatterers
too, therefore the Commonwealth ought to be loved not hunted nor laid in
ambush for: And if the Kings blessed Majesty and his honorable Houses of
Parliament did but seriously consider of their new Matrimonial knot and
Covenant in which they have so solemnly tied themselves by their own free
vows and joint consents each to other, and what faithful Protests and
Promises they have made one to the other and for the other, which I beseech God
of heaven they may do, and lay the Protestation both of them to their hearts,
and but weigh their actions one as well as the other, and their words together,
it will surely cause no more falling out, but a nearer uniting of Prince and
people together in love, when they shall look and fresh call to remembrance
what new Covenants the Head and the members have made for the honor and
safety one of another, all which may be easily done in laying of the
Protestation in print before them, then fall out they cannot, nay with leave
they dare not.

A Protestation is taken, and vows are made on both sides, but are they not
cast behind the back, and out of sight out of mind. I remember the Minister
said when the people were a taking the Protestation, that they should each of
them buy one of them, and stick them up in some places of their houses, which
I conceive from him was after the manner as God commanded the Israelites to do
with his Laws, to the end that they might be ever now and then a looking upon
them; that so they might better remember and think upon them in the field, and
in the house, what a solemn vow, promise and Protestation they have taken in
the presence of Almighty God that thereby they might be the better put in
mind to keep them: and when this shall be seriously pondered and considered
of, with Cain, though he longs to have his fingers knockle deep in his brothers
blood, as some have had too too much already, could be able to separate Ruth
from Boaz, Shem from Japhet, the King from his faithful Ones the Parliament;
the Royal Head from so amiable a body, ecce signum, their pains and money
with the hazard of their dearest blood, and sequestring of themselves from
their dear wives and sweet Children, to attain and win, and bring home their
beloved King who is led away by the wild boares of the Forest, to the
mountains of Lebanon, Shinar and Hermon, where they keep him in the Lions den
and among the mountains of the Leopards.

Notwithstanding the body Politic has wooed along time the Head to come in
and to be joined to the same, that it may not be miscarryed, nor lose out of it
that rich glistering Diamond which yet praised be God sticks fast to it, even
Ireland.

I remember very well what a Scottish Minister said in Delph long since, and I
cannot hold it in, That when a King or people refuse to hear Council and
advice, and refuse the harkning one to the other to be advised one by the
other, it was he said a sign God had appointed some destruction there, I
beseech God it be not so now here among us, for the King will neither hear nor
be advised by his Council, nor his Council will not hear nor hearken to the
several Declarations of the King, but be at so great distance one from off the
other, as if they were afraid one of another, and no body praised be God is
about to hurt them, if they would be but quiet between themselves, and it is
deplorable to think how that the King and Parliament has vowed and sworn each
to other in love, and yet should so quickly in one twelve months forget, as
they seem to do, their solemn tie one to another, and in stead of being true
and faithful friends each to other, begin to wrangle between themselves near
daggers drawing and about that too which should be for both their safeties
against our enemies, even the Militia, God of heaven help us, is the cause of
our combustion, and God forbid that that which the Lord has appointed us for
our preservation should be for our destruction.

Now the way to prevent the mischief is that all the Counties of England join
as one man, not crossing nor wrangling one with another, but as you did all
Petition for the Militia to the Parliament for the setting of your Counties in
a posture of safety for the defense of his Majesty in these troublesome times,
and the Kingdom, so you would beseech his Majesty's favor not to be against
nor go about to cross his Parliaments proceeding, who studies night and day
for his good; and call in his Commission of Array which makes the disturbance,
and his mad Cavaliers which break his Majesty's peace, and will beggar his
Majesty, if he be not careful of himself; as his Majesty, I hope, will
beggar the Papists who lend him money to undo himself, and if they could
would have him fight against the Protestants, his loving Subjects, which into
my heart it cannot enter, that so pious and so gracious a King will do
ungracious actions too, nay he cannot do it belonging to God, for the Child of
God cannot sin, and Paul in the Romans says, he shall not, for he there
says, Sin shall not have dominion over him, where now is then the simple
Papists vain hopes.

These things most humbly are studied not that the chief Cedar of this our
Lebanon our gracious King, and the other attendant lower Cedar knows not what
is made in Promises, Vows and Protestations each to the other, and is past
between themselves, but this is humbly, as Saint Peter in another case
speaks, to put high and low, rich and poor in remembrance knowing we must
shortly all leave this tabernacle as the Lord Jesus Christ has showed himself.

Let us therefore in the fear of the Lord cast away strife, anger, envy,
debate, hatred, bickering, with jeering one at another, and bear one another
burden in love, and so fulfill the Law of Christ, and be joyful Head and
members all one in another, and rejoice together, and I say rejoice.

The truly well affected to the honor and happiness both of his sacred
Majesty the King, and both Honorable Houses of Parliament, humbly so prays

T. L.

FINIS.
