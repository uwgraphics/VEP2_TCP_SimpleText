A Coppie of verses against Lilly
In lilium bardum Astrologastrum
Lilius est quidvis, est bardus, perditas, audax,
Est mendax, afinus Lilius astrologus
Demonstret nomen te mendacissime Lili
Nomine bis mendax dicere, req magis
Istis quid levius quibus est pro numine nomen
Mendacis, magis est qui levitate levis
How vain, how light, how foolish and how naught
Are all that praise thee and thy books have baught?
Candida mi Lili non sunt tibi lilia nomen
Uix inter vepres nomen habere potes
To call you Lilly more it were a scorn
Your name's a nettle thistle brier or thorn
Your head your pen'e your tongue does prick and sting
More then does nettle prier or any thing
To Lilly now all men may well say Phy
Because your name says twice to you ye lie
But i^ you say you have an L in more
Then add ye fifty lies to two before
Thus lies for weeks make up a good new year
O brave what Almanacker have we here.
