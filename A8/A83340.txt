Parliament.
THe Parliament being desirous that good Order and Discipline may still be
continued in the Army, to the end, that the Soldiers thereof may not any wise
be an Oppression to the Country; And whereas diverse Officers of the Army, whose
Regiments, Troops and Companies are Quartered in several Counties of this
Nation, do still continue here about the Town, and absent from their respective
Charges, Do therefore hereby Require all such Officers of the Army forthwith to
Repair to their respective Charges, and not to Depart from them without
Special* Order from the Lord General. And in Case that any of the Regiments,
Troops, or Companies of the Army are Removed from the Quarters last Assigned
them, without Order from the Lord General; The Parliament does Require such
Regiments, Troops and Companies to return forthwith to their said last Quarters
formerly Assigned them, or to such other Quarters, as shall be Assigned by
Directions from the Lord General. And the Parliament does further require, that
such Regiments, Troops or Companies as are not removed, do continue in the
Quarters last Assigned unto them; and none of them to remove from thence,
without the special Order of the Lord General in that behalf.
