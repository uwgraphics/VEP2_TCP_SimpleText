Die Martis, 30 Maii. 1643. A Declaration and Ordinance of the Lords and
Commons in Parliament, for the better securing and settling of the Peace of the
County of Kent, and for enabling them to associate with the City of London, or
any other Counties adjacent.
THe Lords and Commons now in Parliament assembled, being certainly informed,
and by sad experience finding it true, That diverse Papists, Traitors,
Delinquents and other persons ill affected to the King and Parliament, have
Traitorously combined and associated themselves in this Kingdom, for the utter
extirpation of the true Protestant well affected party therein; And for that
end have raised and daily do raise great Forces both of Horse and Foot, and
have plundered, spoiled, and destroyed multitudes of His Majesty's good
Subjects, using also their utmost endeavors to bring in to their assistance
Forraigners of their own Faction, All which if not speedily prevented will
utterly subvert the true Protestant Religion, (which is their chief design)
the Laws of the Land, the privileges of Parliament, and the Liberty of the
Subject: For the timely preventing and withstanding of which mischievous
designs, the well affected of the County of Kent, have been and still are
desirous to have a considerable moveing body of Horse and Foot raised and
maintained at the charge of the said County, and to enter into association for
the mutual defense and preservation of the peace of the said County, and of
all those that shall join with them therein: The said Lords and Commons do
thereupon declare that they hold it a thing most fit and necessary for the
present state of the kingdom, and security of the said County of Kent; And do
ordain and declare, and be it ordained and declared by the said Lords and
Commons, that the Lord Lieutenant and Deputy Lieutenants, Colonels, Captains,
and other Officers that are or shall be employed in the said County of Kent,
the County and City of Canterbury, and Cinqueports, with their members, and all
other well affected persons inhabitants in them, or any of them, shall and may
associate themselves each with other, and with all those who shall enter into
the said Association; And that the said Lord lieutenant and Deputy Lieutenants,
or any seven or more of them, for the foresaid ends and purposes, and also for
the forcing and compelling refractory persons to yield obedience unto the
Orders and Ordinances of either or both Houses of Parliament, shall have full
Power and Authority, and are hereby authorized to raise, arm, and maintain a
moving body of Foot, consisting of one Thousand or more Volunteers, whereof
none to be of the Trained-bands; and one or more Troop or Troops of Horse
which now are or hereafter shall be subscribed or otherwise provided within the
said County, whereof none also are to be taken out of the Trained Forces: And
also to nominate, constitute, and appoint a Major General over the said
Forces, and to give full power and authority to the said Major General, in
case of sickness or disability of body, from time to time constitute and
appoint in his stead such trusty and able person as he shall think fit to be
his Deputy, and in his absence to do all things belonging to the Office of a
Major General: And the said Lord Lieutenant, and Deputy Lieutenants, or any
seven or more of them, shall be, and are hereby authorized to Constitute and
appoint Colonels, Lieutenant-collonels, Serjeant-maiors, Captains, and other

thereof, and therewith to give or cause battle to be given to all such Forces
as are or shall be raised against, or without authority or consent of both
Houses of Parliament, or that shall make or endeavor to make any Invasion,
Rapine, Tumult, or Insurrection, or shall plunder, pillage, or destroy any of
His Majesty's good Subjects, And all and singular such persons, their
abbettors, and adherents, to invade, resist, put to flight, pursue, suppress,
