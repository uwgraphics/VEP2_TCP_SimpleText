A Copy of a Letter from an Officer of the Army in Jreland, to his Highness the
Lord Protector, concerning his changing of the Government.
My Lord,
I Do not at all doubt but that your Highness will wonder to receive a letter,
and of this length, from so mean a person; but when you shall be pleased to
weigh that, no man who is not too mean to be calumniated, can be too
inconsiderable to defend himself; I make no question but you will think this
boldness a necessity, and so pardon it: It is now near five years since I left
England in your Company, and under your Command, ever since which time I have
constantly resided with my charge here, one bare month excepted, for which
space I had leave to dispatch some affairs in England. Now for that my
Superiors here do refuse at present to give me permission to wait upon your
Highness in person, as also that I have small hopes otherwise, that your many
weighty employments can ever admit me to be heard by you at large, I have
presumed to write these few lines, beseeching you to believe the contents of
them, as proceeding from an unfaigned heart, and to take a measure of me and my
principles from hence, and not from such Clandestine reports as may possibly be
Justill'd into your Ears, by those that are my Enemies, and will be yours,
when they shall have prevailed with you, to disgrace those that have bin
oldservants to the cause of liberty, and to your person, and to put your self
wholly at their mercy and discretion, whose deep policy has made them desert
their country for this last five years, dureing which time they have been
little less then Martyrs to Charles Steward, and his interest: My Lord, I
cannot answer to these objections against me, for which I am traduced to your
Highness, because I yet never heard them in particular, nor is there any charge
against me that yet I can learn news of, only a rumor speaks me disaffected to
your present power, and so not fit to be trusted any longer, to give answer to
this, it would be necessary to understand the drift of this government we are
now under which I protest I cannot, I mean, whether we are in the way to a
glorious Commonwealth for which we have engaged, and to which the great power
which you are Possessed of, may make us much nearer, if you please, or upon a
transition, thinking the case of our liberty desperate, from a free state, to a
lasting settled Monarchy, when it shall appear to be the latter, I shall not at
all conceal my disaffection, nor desire to retain my employment, that may
give me a relation to that government, to expose which my life has been so
often hazarded, and my hand and my heart to so many solemn declarations against
it, which together with mine own light and reason, would haunt and persecute
me, like so many revenging furies, if I should dare to harbor an apostate
thought of being isntrumental to revert, as if it was nothing in the eyes of
God and Good men, to imbrew two Nations in blood, to execute a great Prince, to
destroy so many considerable persons and families, who now all beg their bread
in foreign Lands, and to take the food out of the mouths of the poor, and
their beds from under them for taxes and impositions, and all this to the
intent to support that liberty which nature has bestowed upon mankind, and
then to make no more use of the most miraculous mercies of God, and the
precious blood and ^^ars of so many worthy and religious Patriarks, then to
make them isntrumental to pull down a Legal Monarchy, for being somewhat too
tenatious of certain power prejudicial to common freedom, and at the same
time to set up, and introduce without form of law, justice, or consent (no not
of the army it self as is suggested) an arbitaary boundless power solely
subservant to the exorbitant will and unsupportable ambition of one single
person, and that for ever, who is to have thirty thousand men, who are not to
be disbanded, nor the money for their entertainment laid or altered by
Parliament, these are to be his Janissaries, and their work to inslave the
people in these nations, to the lusts of their grand Senior. For if he have
any foreign emergencies he may raise more: what hardhearted men were those in
Parliament, who thought the Earl of Stratford worthy of death, for telling the
late King, he had an Army in Ireland, which he might employ to reduce his
subjects here to their obedience, and how severe were these grave and learned
lawyers, who judged that speech treason, even at the Common Law, and now think
it none for themselves, to act in seats of Judicatory, execute laws, and hang
men, and yet have no power to authorize them therein, but what is derived from
such another trick, as that Earl would have then played; to be short, if I
should examine that paper cal^ed the Government, I should hardly find a line in
it, which is not destructive to our cause and liberty, so that it appears
plainly to be a Monarchy bottomed in the sword, or to come nearer the right
name, a Commonwealth established in a Lord Protector, and thirty Thousand men,
these considerations my Lord, do prevail with me, to believe that your
Highness do not intend to continue this form of government upon us, but have
assumed the power for a time, that you may be able to accomplish the work of
Liberty amongst us, which the Parliment consisting of diverse Persons, of
several and different capacities, was not able to establish, and this seems
more probable to me, not only from your own Oaths, protestations, and
excellent principles against Monarchy, but even from the consideration of the
ticklish and slipperie Posture in which al Monarchies do stand, who have no
foundation of their right and Government, but an armed force; how often have
the P^eto^ian bands, the Turkish and Rushian Armies proved more fatal and
tyrannical to their own princes, then to their poor oppressed vassalls, and it
seems to be agreeing both to divine justice, and humane reason, that an armed
multitude, which by the preswasions of one man, has broken all the bonds of
Law and conscience, to serve his interest, and inslave their country; should
when the tide of their fancy or passion turns, think themselves as well
absolved and disingaged from all reverence and obedience to their own Captain.

Since I have said thus much it will be needless to speak more in praise of a
free state, for that the best and most limited Monarchies are but perpetual
contests between the interest of Mankind, and that of one person, each striving
industriously which shall ruin and undermine the other, and in that Government
flattery and unworthy insinuations are turned up Trump, without which noe man
can win in such a game, which gives a plain reason why the most virtuous
Princes, as Marcus Aurelius, Antonius Pius, and others, could never make their
people so; the interest of their Government being wholly contrary thereunto;
for if the principle of virtue and justice should be sown, and come up, they
would have that growth and increase, which would in short time overtop the
interest of one person, and so destroy the state; as has been seen by the
experience of those Governments which have erected themselves out of the ruin
of Monarchy, where the Prince has been so unadvised, to suffer his people to
attain to riches, and so get good education, for that the great concernment,
or reason of state in Kings and Tyrants, is to keep mankind poor and ignorant,
which the Greeks and Romans understood well, when they styled those nations who
lived under the command of one man, Barbarians, just point blank contrary to
this, are the principles and maxims of a Commonwealth, which is the nursery of
virtue, valor, and industry, where no Court whispers, no pimping projecting,
or such arts, can bring advantage to those who practice them, but only a
public spirit expressed in just and honorable actions, must advance and prefer
persons to the highest offices and employments, this lays a foundation for the
constant succession of g^n^^^us and worthy Patriots, this makes a people rich
and free, ^^pp^e at home, and formable abroad, and history, which is the best
reason in this point, will plainly show, that the worst and meanest of
commonwealths, have been more rich, powerful and populous, then the same
Country could ever be under a Prince; I take the most factious and corrupt
estate in story; to have been that of Fl^rence, yet did that Commonwealth for
many years together give Law to Italy, and when they had war with part of their
own Territories, as Pisa, and its Country, did for many thousand years
maintain sixty thousand men, whereas the same Dominions now under a Duke, with
the addition of the state of Sienna, is not able to raise or maintain twelve
thousand men; for when the present Prince was necessitated in the year one
thousand six hundred and forty three, to make an inconsiderable war against
the Pope in company of Parma, Modena, and the Venetian, and that for but one
summer, he was reduced to such extremity, that he has been forced to sell his
Galleys, and wholly to neglect the Sea, and yet those people that are left in
his Dominion, are much more oppressed by impositions, then in the days of
liberty; I will not speak of England, because it was never yet a Commonwealth,
though it has past a civil war, and all other sufferings which belongs to a
Change, yet this must and will be said, that all those actions of Honor, which
our Kings for six hundred years have performed, did not bring more renown; nor
so much advantage to these Nations, as the achievements of the same People
when they had no Prince, and but the Name only of a free state; and if for our
sins it be decreed that we shall never be so; I dare almost prophecy that the
actions of succeeding Monarchies will not outdo, nor perhaps not Equal these,
and then Posterity will have leave to think, that all the wisdom, valor, and
activity of these Nations was not residing in one single person; but I have
dwelt too long upon this, and shall only conclude, that if all Kingdoms be
near their period and ruin, when the subjects under them grow rich, wise, and
capable of understanding their own good, and contrariwise, that Commonwealths
do not decay, but when their people in general grow poor; and ignorant, and
the riches of the Nation comes to be engrossed by a few, who by that means can
buy voices to get into command, and then bribe soldiers to uphold them in
their ambitious designs, to inslave their Country, the poverty and
abjectness of the people, making them fit for the impression; then it must
necessarily follow, that those in whose hand and power it is to settle and
establish what form of Government they please, ought to improve that power for
erecting a Free State, or a Commonwealth; this is the case of your Highness,
who besides your oaths and trust, have this obligation more, that you know, and
are persuaded in your conscience, that this is a more excellent form then
Monarchy, as you have thousand of times expressed your self, and particularly
in that Declaration which you composed here, and published when you entered the
Province of Munster, 1649. in which you have most excellent and unanswerable
Reasons for a Popular Government, which shall make me say no more of this
business; but come to bring it to our present condition, because it is
Alleged (and indeed to that we owe this Change, which has brought upon us so
much distraction and unsettlement, that we were not capable being a free state,
And so that you by necessity have been forced upon these Courses, to prevent
confusion) I am not ignorant, that nothing is more commonly said and believed
amongst the Vulgar, then this Error, and it is besides industriously fomented
by some subtle grandees, who knows their great Riches, titles, knavish
cunnings, and such useless Qualities, will not prefer them to that dignity and
Eminency in such a Government, as they hope to enjoy under a Prince, whom they
can sooth and flatter, I must confess, to look upon the present humor of the
People, as they are divided into factions, and animated against the Parliaments
managing affairs, a rational man might believe, that as their passions do
hinder them from seeing the advantage of a Comonwealth, so they would likewise
hinder them from Obeying it; but those who shall consider on the one hand their
punctual Obedience, not only to all laws, but even to these ordinances, which
are now called so, and that undoubtedly against their Judgment, as well as
their affections; and on the other side their genuine inclinations, and before
this war, when they were free from factions, and in Puris naturalibus, to
freedom, which was plainly seen by their joining unanimously with the House
of Commons, in their contest against their King: I say whosoever shall observe
that, must needs say, that a small force joined with Good Principle, and honest
Governors, will soon reduce them to their natural disposition and temper
again, If thirty thousand men can support this Government, then ten thousand
might maintain Freedom, which would quickly come to subject by it self
without any force at al; which al states do, that are Established upon a right
Basis, viz upon the natural temper and humor which the posture and condition of
the people puts them into, if they be poor and low, Monarchy may serve their
turn, if rich, they would look to have share, Rule and magistracy themselves:
whosoever then would, found a Government which he intends not, shall subject by
force (for if he do it, matters not what he makes it) might above all things,
observe these accidences, which ruind the precedeing state, for every form of
Government which crumbles and falls to ruin, by the weakness of its own
pillars, must have a new fabric, or mend the old, one just in the place, first
break, if it be capable of it, and whosoever shall look back into the turns
and revolutions of state; will find, that all changes in Government have been
mending of old frames, or making of new ones, and as Legislators or Senats,
have gone to the root of nature in this, have not palliated or patched up the
cure, so Nations have been happy or unhappie, free or slaves, governed by
force continually, or by consent, and states durable, or short lived, is true,
that our unhappiness is that great alterations seldom come without intestine
wars, it being hard (especially in populous and flourishing Cities, to bring
the multitude to give so great a power to one man as is necessary to redress a
disordered State, and for that men are generally short sighted, and cannot
foresee great inconveniences till they are too late to remedy, but by force,
this makes the cure oftentimes miscarry, as in the case of the Gracchi at Rome,
and of Agis and Cleomenes at Sparta, in both which examples, there was an
endeavor to reduce those two excellent States, to their first principles, but
it was too late attempted, when the corruption was grown to too great a
height, which if they had found, and would have been contented to erect a new
form more suitable to the inequality of men's estates at that time, they might
possibly have succeeded, if not to have introduced so good and excellent a
model as they fell from, yet one able to have prevented the ruin and slaverie
which soon after befell both these people; not to make the business longer, I
will instance in the example of our own Nation, the first history of which,
(it is not esteemed fabolous) is that we were invaded and conquered by William
the Norman, who either ruled by his own will, or made the Law rule, which he
gave at his own pleasure; his French Lords left posterity behind them, who in
process of time grew so rich and powerful, that they did not think it fit to be
governed by the discretion of one man, but believed, they might deserve and
share in rules themselves, for there is nothing more fundamental by nature,
then that those who possess a land will desire, and by all means attempt to
govern it, which is the true reason of what was alleged before, viz. That it
is against the interest of a Monarchy, to let his subjects grow rich; from this
contest of the Lords, with succeeding Kings, began the Barons Wars, and in the
close of them our Government, by Kings, Lords, and Commons, wherein, although
the Commons were named, it will be found (if we look into Records, that they
had little share, except to help bear up the Lords, whose Blew-coats they wore
against the King) and it will likewise appear, that they were never
discontented at their small proportion, and the reason is the same with the
former, viz. that either they possessed no lands at all, or else he held them
as servants to their loving Lords and Clergy, so that this State was founded
with great wisdom, upon the very condition of the People, which had it
continued the same it then was, could never have been shaken, but by a foreign
war; but all great bodies are well politic as natural, receive great
alteration and corruption, and though in good mixtures they commonly tend to
decay and ruin, yet where the Crasis is bad, there may be accedents which may
incline to amend it, and that without the knowledge of the parties, who are the
subject matter of the change, and as Wine changes it self by working, so many
times the natural humor of a Nation tends from the corruption of a Monarely, to
the erecting of a Popular State, though whilst they are in motion, they may not
possibly understand whether their own impulse does incline and lead them, this
will prove to be the case of England; for when Henry the Seventh had
established himself King, and saw plainly that he did owe his acc^ssed to the
Crown, more to the favor of those Lords who assisted him, then either to his
own Sword or Title, he began to consider in how ticklish a posture he stood,
whilst it was in the power of any small number of Lords to set up, or pull down
a Sovereign at their will, and upon this contemplation he made it his whole aim
and work to lessen and debase the nobility, that he might have the less to
apprehend in his newgotten royalty, by which he laid the foundation of
destroying his Posterity, not considering at all that the Lords could not be
diminished, but by advancing and enriching the Commons, whose desire of power
must necessarily increase accordingly, which if they could obtain, it was
then obvious that they must strike not at this or that Prince, but at the very
Root of Monarchy it self, as being a thing useless wholly to them, and indeed
inconsistent with their Government and interest: Henry the Eight continued in
the same policy, and amongst many other accidents of increasing the power of
the Commonwealth, to the settling the Militia in Deputy Lieutenant, it
happened in his days that religious houses being taken away, most of the Lands
and Mannours belonging to them, some for moneys, others for Donations, fell
into the hands of the Commons; this was the first time they began to bear up
with the Lords, who since have been abased and impoverished by many accidents,
as by finding a means to cut off Intailes, whereby it came to be in the power
of those who were in present possession, to sell their posterity and revenues,
and so to ruin the Lords who succeeded them, (which estates too) being most
what spent in Court vices and luxury, lost the interest of the Peers in their
Countries, and made them contemptible to the whole Nation, and slaves to the
Citizens, who by their prodigalities grew into great wealth, and possessed their
lands; about this time trade beyond Sea increased, and abuses in the Law
growing up, made that a wealthy profession, so that incensiblie foundations of
great families amongst the Commons were laid, whilst the Lords grew daily to
decay, and that which brought them to nothing at last, was doubtless the Scotch
race of Kings, who whether by design, or for want of prudence, is not known,
made so many worthless persons Peers here, as well Scotch as English, and those
too for the most part so inconsiderable in point of estate, that the people did
universally detest the Government, as we may observe by the constant
unquietness of their Representors in Parliament, there scarce having been one
in the two last Kings raigns, which were not dissolved abruptly by them, so
little complying were they to his Government: Now though I am no ways ignorant
that the dissentions which happened between those Kings and their Parliaments,
had very good ground on the peoples side, as the taking away grievances, and
the like, yet the natural cause (and which was a long time collecting) was the
height of the Commons, and the meanness of the Lords, and the King, who had by
this time sold and given away all his revenues; and this too will appear to
have been the original of these civil wars, for although the last action, which
drove us into it, will ever be acknowledged to have been the Kings
misgovernment, yet as we are apt to say in Malignant fevers, that the last
excess we made drove us into it, though the body had been gathering that
pestilential Mass many years before; so in this case the essential and natural
cause of this State disease, was much longer in collecting, then the
Ship Money, or the Loan; and this is clear, for that the people did support
much more then those from their Prince and Landlords too, whilst they were
poor, and never did stomach to be governed, even arbitrarilie, by those upon
whom they were necessarily to depend in point of estate and subsistence, it
being then, my Lord, so clear and evident, That the riches of the people in
general, is the natural cause of destruction to all Regal States: I desire to
bring this to our present discourse, and will beg leave to ask your Highness
leave, whether the Commonaltie of England be grown poorer then they were when
this was began, or rather, whether they are not become so much more rich, as
the Lands and Mannours of King, Bishops, Dean and Chapters, and of all the
great Delinquent Lords, together with Free-farm Rents, could make them; if this
be granted, it must be then concluded, that we are farther off from a capacity
of being governed by Monarchy again, then when we first began this quarrel; so
that you see that it is so far from being true, that the Nation of England is
not fit at all to be a Commonwealth, that indeed it is wholly impossible to
make it any other, without an excessive force and violence; so that my Lord, if
your Highness shall yet resolve to detain from us our liberties, with which you
were entrusted, you will not only offend against your own Oaths and
Principles, against common right and justice, but even against God and nature
too, for that it will be impossible for you to mend this frame where it first
brake, except you can take from the people their estates, and confer them upon
old or new Lords, which will be hardly safe for you to attempt, it has been
my unhappiness to make this discourse somewhat too long for a letter, but I
have been forced to rove too far into the nature of Government in general,
before I could show the principles of a Free State, and how near we are to it,
if you please, so near, that the Cavaliers themselves in their hatred to the
Parliament, and now to your self, do fully manifest, that they abhor all
Superiors, and are impatient to be governed by others; and this very humor in
them, is a secret impulse toward a Commonwealth, which although they do not
now understand to be so, yet they would soon do it, if they had what they
immediately desire, for I am fully persuaded, if their Darling Charles
Stewart could be brought in by them, and all his opposers wholly rooted out,
he would not be able without a standing Army to maintain the old Government,
even amongst his own party, so much is the case altered now, and so strong and
natural the motives which draw toward Liberty. I must confess these
speculations were no part of the cause which induced me first to take up arms
first for the Parliament, but did come into my thoughts since by discourse,
what I did originallie look at, was the justness and honesty of the cause, the
excellency of liberty, the glory of advancing and promoting the interest of
mankind, the making my Nation more wise, valiant, happy, and honest then
before, as well as more free, which I cannot yet despair of whilst I see you
alive, whose noble and unwearied endeavors to that end, can never be
forgotten, when the King, the Scots, and half the Parliament combined against
us, you could not be daunted, when your own Grandees would have persuaded you
out of those principles, you would not be circumvented, but did often say, that
toward the attaining of a just and upright Government, an ounce of honesty and
resolution, was worth a pound of sneaking policy: Oh let not those men who
have suffered for your enemies get that upon you, by soothing your ambition,
which they could never do by opposing your reason, let not those instruments,
who have deserted the cause of liberty, be now made use of to destroy it, and
by advising you to purge the Armic, make those Janissaries, whose glory it was
once, they would not acknowledge themselves to be Mercenaries, put not your self
upon the discretion of those whose love is not to you, but to Monarchy, and
when they shall have made you a while the instrument of their ambition and
avarice, will in the least adversity look back to the old line again, which
they scarce ever yet offended, and when that shall be understood by Charles
Stewart and his Hectors, and that there shall be nothing standing in their way
hither, but your life, the ancient asserters of liberty being laid by with
shame, and those who were once outed for opposing it, stepped into their places,
in how hazardous and desperate a condition is that life of yours like to be,
which has been hitherto so precious to all the honest party in these Nations;
Consider therefore that those Grandees are like fire and water, good servants,
but very dangerous masters, let them do your drudgery, but let them not steer
your counsels, trust this Nation with their freedom, posterity with your fame,
and God for a reward; we know we cannot be free without your help, till we have
undergone a thousand confusions in the way, our factions will not suffer us to
agree in any thing, except you lead us into that frame which will fit us, and
to make which, you may find persons enough to assist you, if you please to seek
them; and who knows but that the wise providence of God, seeing the failings of
the Parliament has permitted you to assume this great power, to that end, do
not offend that God whom you have so often called to witness of the integrity
of your heart; Consider, that if you will not build us up that fabrique of a
Free State, you must be the first to lose your own liberty; do but weigh the
fears and the uncertainties you will be in, whilst you live, and the almost
inevitable necessity that your pesterity must be destroyed when you are gone,
as well as ours, or let this prevail with you, at least to make us a
Commonwealth, because you can make us nothing else; if you believe your self
not safe without this power, pray consider how many plots and designs there
were against you when you were our General, and how many nights sleep you brake
then in examinations, nay remember, if during the Trial of the late King, you
did not walk the streets often with one servant, or without one, whereas now,
new Troops and Regiments must be raised, and the old recruited, and all thought
too little to preserve you* and yet the lives of all the honest Patriots in
England were then wrapped up in yours, as much as now, and their interest more;
but if yet after all rhis, that detestable poison of ambition, and desire of
domination, have taken so far possession of you, that no Antidote can expel
it, and that nothing will satisfy you, but to destroy that liberty which you
were appointed Guardian to; and to outdoe him whom you have pulled down and
executed: I must profess to all the world, that though I shall ever
acknowledge that I owe much of my being settled in the principles of freedom,
which I now adhere to, to your former excellent discourses, and most excellent
actions; yet that I cannot find any thing in my conscience that will persuade
me to change with you, but shall vvash my hands from the guilt and infamy of
your ways, and vvithall lay down my commands, and all other relations to
your Government, that so I may deliver you from the apprehensions, which I
believe you are in, that you cannot find a specious pretense to discharge me
from my employments, though the series of your former behavior in that kind
toward your friends, makes me believe you will be soon provided of a cause
to lay me by, for you have hitherto (as I may so say) rid so fast, that you
have seemed to be mounted rather upon Posthorses, then those which were your
own, leaving them still at their stages end, and taking fresh ones; one while
none but Barkley Leg and Ashburnham must serve your turn, and the King must
either be brought in, or it must be thought so, soon after, when his head
comes to be cut off, the Levellers must when that is well over, the
Presbyterian must be Courted till the war of Scotland be ended, and their nest
fired; next to this an expedient in Religion must be thought upon, and a
Committee for Propagation appointed, into which, as into the Ark, all kind of
creatures must enter, soon after this Blackfriers men must be encouraged to
cry this down, and the Parliament too, for going on too fast with it, and for
not reforming the Laws, till at length they being preached ripe for
destruction, the members of Parliament must be removed, and such honest godly
persons chosen to succeed them, as may make the people forget Monarchy; but
these are presently cashiered too, for endeavoring to perform what they were
called for, as if they had been summoned only to beat a Commonwealth out of
the Pit, and serve for a foil for the new Monarchy; next, because we have no
more varieties of fashions or instruments, we must revert to our Monarchical
Grandees again, these are now the only wise men, for having distrusted you,
and foreseen all this, the only firm States men, for sticking to their
principles, these must now be called the honest party, whilst those who were
so the last year are styled factious fellows, and to make this relish the
better, there must be sought out instruments of an inferior capacity to the
Grandees, who never had any other principles then fear and avarice, and who
never disdained to be flatterers in any age, I mean Divines and Lawyers, whom
the late fright they were in for Tithes and Reformation, has made them now
more supple then formerlie; the first of these must now preach up tyranny, as
much as ever they have done liberty, they who once said the people, or the
Saints, were the Lords Anointed, must now recant that Doctrine, and say its
the Lords Protector, and must even prostitute the Jus Divinum of their
Ordination it self, to an Ordinance of your Highness, and for the latter, they
must make that just and honorable in you, which they thought. Treason in the
Earl of Stafford; those who condemned Ship Money, must cry up the monethlie
Taxes in their Circuits and charges, and such who scrupled Councel-Table Orders
formerlie, must now swear to, and judge by such Laws, as you can make a dozen
in an hour, without the trouble of twice reading or engrossing, nay, the same
persons must be a High Court, and hang men for striving to oppose Monarchy to
day, who yesterday did the same to them who would have brought it in: But my
Lord, we will have patience to expect the end, it will be that which must give
the denomination to all this, which if it terminate in liberty, will be
esteemed prudent policy, if in the contrary, it will have another name; but
least your Highness should think, that either my self, or any honest man here,
do place our hopes of a good issue to this business in the next Parliament, as
you call it, I will presume to disabuse you in that particular, and give you
that which I conceive to be the judgment of the world concerning it, at well
as mine: First, then my Lord, it is understood to be a creature of your will
and power, the definition of the places, the qualification of the persons, the
summons, and all other incidents belonging unto it, deriving themselves wholly
from you, and your assumed office, so that if there be a flaw in the justice of
legalitie, of that which is the foundation, what can be hoped for in the
superstructure? it might be objected in the next place, the people having
already chosen a Parliament, which have not received any formal, (or as it was
once called) legal determination, could not be in a capacity to choose another,
because this would seem to grant, that any prevailing violence might, even in
that sense of Law, dissolve a Parliament; but I leave this as that which comes
too near Treason; another thing which renders the whole scrupellous is, that
your Highness should think the people fit to have a share in Government, and
give Laws, and yet should make your self so far Paramount to them at the same
time, as to confine them by the Instrument and Indentures, what power they
shall delegate to their Trustees, if the original of all just power be in the
people, as we have been taught by the Parliament, how comes there to be a
Jurisdiction superior to theirs, which must command them what to do with that
power, and what instructions to give those who represent them? but if that
Doctrine be not true, what need they be disturbed in their harvest work, to
choose and send needless Ciphers up to London? and why cannot you rather, either
as you do now, make Laws still with the consent of the major part of seven
men, or without it, or else take the pains, as you did lately, to name the
persons, to be summoned your self, this had savoured of much more ingenuitie,
and would have made us hope this deplorable estate we are now in, had been to
last no longer then till you, with the advice of wise and honest Patriots, had
been able to frame a moddle of present freedom for us, whereas things standing
thus, there are sad apprehensions, that the countenance of a Parliament, and
not their counsel, is sought for, and that specious pretense to deceive the
vulgar are more aimed at and desired, then either the present good of the
Nation, or any design of settlement for the future, and reallie what advantage
could have been expected from the last Parliament, if the King, which called
it, had incombred it with an Indenture, that they should have power only to
have secured his ends, but not to alter the Government, though he had taken
them man by man, and murdered them, and doubtless this must be a president for
all Kings and other usurped Powers, which shall succeed in England, to put all
their Commands, Lusts and Projects into writing, and deliver them for a lesson
to the people at their choice, till they have made their Indentures as long as
Drury House Conveyance, till such time as the people of those Nations, like the
Natives under the Spaniard in the Indies, shall be capable of no other office
or employment, but to summon and bring in their fellows to the mines, and make
them slaves; one advantage more toward tyranny in this business is, that
those blocks laid in the way, will discourage many wise and honest Patriots,
from suffering themselves being elected, and so the credit and reputation of
this new Junto, will be as small as its Authority, only this will render
them somewhat more fit to serve the end for which they are appointed, viz.
either to confirm this power as it is, or settle the old Royalty in your line,
or else perhaps find out some mungrell expedient, by which they will seem to
retrench some part of this arbirrary Sovereignty, and by that means, as much as
in them lies, authenticate the rest; but the truth is, they do perform all that
by summoning in; and not only so, but make all these poor blind people who
elect them, to submit themselves to a voluntary slavery, by owning an authority
destructive to their freedom, for either those they send, must not attempt to
do them any service, or if they do, be perfidious and break their trust, since
the only call they can pretend to, is the peoples choice, and even by them they
are confused by an instruction to approve this Government, and so undo all
that has been building up toward our Liberty for these fourteen years: Next
my Lord, because it is Commonly reported here that your Highness intends to
resign your power, entirely and absolutely into the hands of those men when
they are met, I will crave leave to say a word to that, to the end, you may
perceive that there are some honest people even in Ireland who are undeceived
in that point. First then they Conceive you may, as well and justly Resign it
to your Council, they being equally your Creatures, and then they observe the
falacie of Leaving those men free, whom you have Caused to be bound ere they
came there, and with such Chains as you your self cannot loosen, no more then
a Foraigne Prince can Give an Ambassador sent from hence Authority to Negotiate
beyond his Commission, and those bonds which you have Laid upon them are
concerning the very Essence of our Liberty, viz. the Government by one Person,
which you were once so fully persuaded of that you said in your Declaration
here, that you did believe that God was entering into a contest with Kings and
Priests, and would very suddenly open the eyes of the Nations, so that within
few years, there should not be either left in the whole world. Cease then, my
Lord, to Flatter your self any longer with an Opinion that the well affected
people of any of these Nations will think any better of your Monarchy then they
now do, when you shall seemingly have Laid it down to those men who have no
power for any thing, but to restore it to you; and who are besides a product of
your own will. A Civil Army Raised by your self to handle the Estates of your
people, as the other perhaps do their persons when they are purged and fitted
to the principles of A Turkish Empire, and possibly you had this, this thought
when you made this Modle, that because it was probable (and it fell out since)
that the Most wise and honest part of the Gentlemen of England would not suffer
themselves to be persuaded to come into your Council, nor own your Govenment,
therefore you would make the people of that Nation your Lictors, who should
send you four hundred men bound hand and foot to perform your commands, and who
should have power to tax, poll, and oppress them, but not the least shadow of
any to relieve them: And here I cannot chose but touch at one thing often
alleged; and it is, that if you do rightly and duly administer justice, the
Nation will be happy that you took this power, for it matters not who Governs
so they Govern well, for my part I wholly dissent from, and detest this
opinion, and do conceive it to have been invented first by some Lawyer or other
flatterer, merely to satiate their present Apostasy, for if it will be granted
that there is in the most pure and incorrupt part of mankind, a natural
instinct or inclination to Liberty in Government (which is for ought I know)
the only thing that distinguishes them from beasts for that the creature has
no Reason, or no Religion, cannot infallibly be said by us as it can, that they
never attempt to rule themselves by Laws but suffer a Monarchy over them, to
be either in the strongest of themselves, or in us, without ever attempting to
assert their freedom) then it will likewise be confessed that it is a vile and an
unnatural Passion in us which makes us prefer estate, much more a little quiet
or ease, before that liberty which is so essential to us, and for this I have
the example of all those excellent Persons and Nations whom their own hazards
and adventures in this behalf have styled so in the universal esteem of all
mankind; indeed if the contrary to this were true, it would follow as Mr.
Goodwin holds, that any Person who believes in his conscience that he could
govern better then others do, might, nay is bound to use all means to attain to
power, and acquire the Government, the consequence of which will be that if any
man will call his Ambition Conscience, no known Laws, no Constitution of
Estate, no Common Right, in fine nothing divine or humane ought to stand in
this way. I dare go yet farther and affirm that nothing can be more pernicious
to these Nations at this present, then for you to govern well, for it would
Palliate the assumed Power, and so hide it from the just indignation of this
age, and prove like the guilding of poisonous pills, or Painting of Sepulchers,
and be a bribing us out of our Rights and Liberties with a seeming justice,
nothing but this can Iull asleep so many Patriots, who have been often awakened
with Drums and Trumpets, to adventure their lives against a Tyrant; neither
indeed could any other thing then the just and happy Reign of Augustus Caesar,
have given the last defeat to the Roman liberty, or made way for those Monsters
who succeeded. You see then my Lord what a business you have undertaken, when
you have made it the interest of honest men to wish that you may commit all
Excesses, and use more violence, break more Laws and ties, in carrying on this
arbitrary Sovereignty then you have done in the assuming of it. My Lord, I
beseech your Highness to pardon the length of this Letter, which could not
well have been made shorter, for that the intention thereof is to evince,
first, that to continue this present government upon us or any thing like it,
would be most injurious in you, not only because it is most contrary to your
own trust and Oaths but even against common right and justice, and in the next
place that there is no necessity of a new erected Royalty, the nature and
Condition of those Nations being so proportionable to a Commonwealth that we
are no way fit to receive any other form, but by an outward force and violence,
besides that we have spent our blood and fortunes for it, and in the last place
to show that we are not easily deluded into a belief, that either the next
assembly or any expediencies that arise from thence have any right or
likelihood to mend our conditions; I shall next give your Highness a short
account of my self, and then humbly take my leave. I took up Arms with the
first in the quarrel of the Parliament, not as a mercinary, as not having
before my eyes the temptation of my Masters pay or the spoil of their enemies,
but purely and solely out of a conscientious desire to free my Nation from
slavery and oppression, and having confirmed my judgment in this, I did
examine my zeal and resolution, and believed it had enough of both to hazard my
self, for such a cause; in which expectation I thank the Lord, I have not yet
found my self deceived; How I have behaved my self since I came under your
command, it would seem vanity for me to relate, if my former and present usage
did not make it necessary for me to say that for my Justification, which I
should never have said for boasting; this excuse makes me bold to lay before
you some of my services, as well as my personal discouragements: your Highness
may please to Remember, (here some particulars are left out which would detect
the person who wrote the letter) notwithstanding all which I am yet satisfied
to go on with my employment here, and to be faithful in it, as being for the
advancement of the Common Cause and against the Common Enemy, and yet if I were
assured that you did intend to perpetuate upon us this slavery (after you had
disolved the Parliament, for an imputation of endeavoring to perpetuate
themselves) I should have many scruples against serving you in Scotland,
whither we are very liable to be transported; for what Reason is there that we
should not give them leaves to be Governed by their Native King, and whom they
had received by their Parliament? and at the same time seek to impose upon
them by force another Prince of our Nation, whom we had chosen for them, or
rather had chosen himself, what can you think my Lord the just God, who has
been used to deside upon appeals would do in this quarrel, if they should have
recourse to him with faith and prayer? Alas my Lord you do not consider how
much these thoughts do weaken the hands and hearts of those poor righteous and
precious souls, who are yet left in the Army and who pour forth their tears
and prayers daily before the Lord on your behalf, that you may find mercy in
this day of your temptation, that so they may not be traduced to have slain so
many men as Bravoes to your designs, and that you would make use of the Great
power you are now possessed of to settle and transmit to succeeding ages a state
of Lasting freedom which a small trouble and force would accomplish, whereas
this Government must be eternally supported by violence, no unnatural things
being permanent without it, or if this cannot be, their prayers and desires are
that you would summon a free unlimitted Parliament (consisting of such that
have not forfeited their liberties) not bound or fettered by Indentures, and
devesting your self of all power and Command, you would leave the whole sway
and Government to them, and swear the Army to obey them, by this means the
Nation would either enjoy their liberty, or have the choice and imposition of
their own yoke; nor is there any Reason except you will do one of these, upon
which you can excuse the dismission of the Parliament, for that it was within
their power and design to make Indentures in the behalf of Liberty, which would
have had an unquestionable Authority as well as a more Noble end, then those
you have compelled for the Contrary; If you shall wholly refuse all things of
this kind, and obstinately resolve to go forward in your way you now take,
you will want the hands, hearts and prayers of all Gods people in these
Nations; and though the principles of some of them may not give leave as
private men to make you any further opposition, yet they will wash their own
hands, and deliver their own Souls, and beseech the just God of Heaven and
earth, who has appeared so visibly and Miraculously for this Cause of freedom,
and whom no hypocrosie can deceive, no false Oaths, nor tears prevail upon
to judge between you and these poor oppressed and deluded people, but if yet
you shall Answer their hungry expectations of Liberty; you will give Glory to
God, increase to his Church, flock and Religion, which has been grievously
dishonored by those actions, Immortal fame to your self, safty to your
Posterity, happiness to mankind, and will have the lives of many thousands
entirely at your service and Command, and amongst the rest that of

Waterford this 24 June 1654. Your most humble and most faithful Servant R. G.

POSTSCRIPT.
REader, that this letter should not be exposed to public view so long after
the date thereof, I hope will not possess thee with any prejudice against it
the honesty and reason of the tract and faithfulness of the Author to that
good old principle of common justice, equity and liberty, secured in the most
noble form of government, viz. The peoples representative may commend it to
thee, indeed that has been the Axletree of the cause which God so signally
blessed us in, and since it was broken (although upon pretense of going faster
on in the obtaining of our liberties) has blasted us, wherein that saying is
verified Melius in via claudicare quam extra viam currere. It was the design of
the old, so it is of the new Court, to estrange the people from, and work them
out of love with Parliaments, many honest well meaning men being too much led
away with that mistake. The Author mentions his fear of the last
Representative not of their judgment in, and affection to the public cause
of liberty, but by reason of that restriction in the indenture framed to serve
the intrest of the present Protector. But indeed the Gentlemen deserve an
honorable esteem from all English men, who though they could not do the good
desired by us, and doubtless intended by them, yet would not do us the evil
(which a powerful party endeavored to court and threaten them unto) in
perpetuating by any act of theirs our vassalage to the present Grandees, or
revoke those acts which makes it treason for any single person to assume the
supreme Magistracy. I shall only add this as the earnestly desire of myself
and of many who are friends to the good old cause, that the Lord would be
pleased to guide us in the attayning of a free Representative, which may assert
our liberties, and secure them to posterity, which will be a glorious answer to
the faith, prayer, expense of blood and treasure, both of the godly and
likewise of the rest of the freeborn people of England who have been faithful
to the common cause of justice and liberty.

FINIS.
