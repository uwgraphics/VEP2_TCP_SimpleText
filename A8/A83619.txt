Die Jovis 24o. Martii. 1641.
WHereas the Bill of Tonnage and Poundage is this day expired, and a new Bill
past both Houses for the continuance of those payments, until the third day of
May, which cannot as yet receive the Royal assent, in regard of the
remoteness of His Majesty's Person from the Parliament. Which moneys to be
collected by that Bill, are to be employed for the necessary guarding of the
Seas, and defense of the Commonwealth: It is therefore ordered by the Commons
now assembled in Parliament, that the several Officers belonging to the
Custom House, both in the Port in London, and the out Ports, do not permit
any Merchant or other, to lade or unlade any Goods or Merchandises, before such
persons do first make due entries thereof in the Custom House: And it is also
declared by the said Commons, That such Officers upon the respective entry made
by any Merchant, as aforesaid, shall intimate to such Merchant, That it is the advice of the Commons for the better ease of the said Merchants; And in regard
the respective duties will relate and become due, as from this day; That the
said Merchants upon entry of their Goods, as usually they did, when a law was
in force to that purpose, would deposite so much money as the several Customs
will amount unto, in the hands of such Officers, to be by themaccompted to his
Majesty, as the respective Customs due by the said Bill, when the said Bill
shall have the Royal assent; Or otherwise His Majesty refusing the passing
thereof, the said moneys to be restored upon demand unto the several
Merchants respectively.
