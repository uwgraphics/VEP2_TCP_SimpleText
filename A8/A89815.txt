LONDON, Printed by Richard Cotes, 1647.

A NARRATIVE PRESENTED To the Right Honorable the Lord Major, Aldermen, and
Commons of the City of LONDON, in Common Council assembled.
WHen the Body receives a wound, the Chyrurgion that cures it, if he do it
not soundly and effectually, it afterward proves as dangerous, and as
expensive, as if remedies had never been applied; this Kingdom has at present
many wide and gaping wounds, (and some of them old sores which continually
break out) which if not skilfully handled, may breed a long distemper in it,
and perhaps at last lose much of its strength, and get a halting that may prove
incurable; Look but back, and you shall see a War betwixt the King and
Parliament, in which was much blood spilt, to the great grief of all true
English men, who cannot but wish this War had never been, and that some more
moderate way had been found out to have reconciled these differences, rather
then to see it effected with the loss of their dearest friends and estates,
and to enjoy no settlednesse to this day; which when it was hoped might have
come to some issue, here appears another rent 'twixt the Parliament and the
Army, that in all likely hood may prove as dismal as the former, if not looked
unto with judgment, and an order put for a speedy remedy. What the Army does
set forth is very fair in all or most particulars, and I doubt not if things
were estated according to what they propose, the Kingdom may prove famous and
flourishing: What is most stumbled at, is liberty of Conscience, and demanding
the Members out of the House. For the first, they do it in a moderate way, and
charity will construe the best; and truly if in point of Ceremony only, and
not in fundamental grounds they differ, I do not see how men can well be
forced against their Conscience, so long as in all kinds else they be
regular, without any self-pretences, and without birternesse and hatred. For
the second, there is none I think that means well, is against their desire,
that any who is suspected (and consequently impeached) by them, but shall be
brought to his trial: The difference only is, whether they shall be tried by
the Common Law of England, or by the high Court of Parliament now fitting; they
are Parliament men, and, therefore (as the case now stands) the Parliament are
their Peers: Also when the King would have had the five Members out of the
House, it was then the sense of the whole Kingdom, that it was a breach of
Parliament; if it were so then, it will be the same now; I question not, but by
the interposition of your mediation, this may be brought to take place, that
all those whom they have named may be tried by the Parliament; for there is
great hopes that the Honorable House will do Justice, even to the cutting off
its own Members, (if they be unsound) for the cure of the Commonwealth; and it
cannot be but a pleasing sight to the people, to see good justice done on such
against whom proof is made, that they have abused the high trust reposed in
them, and no less joyful will it be to see others (if no offenders) to come
off with credit and reputation; and whereas most loving and friendly Letters
have been sent you from the Army, wherein they in a most full manner express
their love to the City in particular, (which for my part I believe is
unfaigned) and withal desire you not to be against them in their proceeding
according to their Declaration in any way of opposition, etc. I cannot but
persuade to the same, only I wish that in a prudentiall way you would be so
ready as to be able to withstand all attempts whatsoever may be made, and that
such a course may be taken, that the City lie not open to be surprised at
pleasure, in case the Common Soldier should desire that such a thing be
exploited. I do not in the least degree question the integrity of those
Gentlemen that subscribed the Letters sent to this City, yet they are but
single men, and cannot (as they have confessed) rule the multitude altogether
as they desire; witness their fetching of the King from Holdenby without their
knowledge, for which they gave a Reason, that it was absolutely convenient, and
that must suffice; Who knows if they may also judge it convenient at one time
or other to come to the City, and (when once entered) to be tempted to plunder?
But it may be said against this, What if they should do so? are 20000 men
able to prevail in so populous a City, to go away foot-free, without their
due punishment one man out of every third house will make a number sufficient
to cut all their throats: do you think they love themselves so little, as to
attempt such a thing? To which I answer, that 20000 men for their number are
not so considerable, as for their quality; all of them are armed men, and come
prepared for the feate, and are a compact body, and can do their spoil, and
return again; yet a greater thing (then what 20000 men from without can do)
may be feared, which is the having well-willers, (though not abettors) within
the City. And what is worst of all, is, that many thousands of indigent and
unruly people among us, will take this advantage, and plunder equally, if not
beyond what the Soldier can do in this way; upon this cannot be expected
less then firing of houses, and bringing all into disorder and confusion; but
I hope, and verily think the good temper of the Army is such, as none of these
things will come to pass in the least degree, yet it is but reason you should,
notwithstanding, be in a posture of defense against all events, setting forth a
Declaration of the sincerity of your intentions, (as the Army has done) which
course none within or without the City can with reason disallow of. I will not
admit my most intimate friend, of whom I have had most real trials into
secrets that concern properly my self, nor will I leave my casket of Jewels
open, where none but he and I do come, for fear that opportunity should give
him occasion to break that bond which is betwixt us; nor will I leave my
money-bags open, in the way where those of my household are only to pass,
(although I never found them but faithful) for fear they should be tempted to
do amiss; but if my Jewels be locked up, and the bags put in the Chest, I
shall administer no occasion of losing my friends love, or stagger in the
fidelity of those of my house; Your being in a posture of defense, is the
taking away the temptation, and consequently of the evil which may follow it;
if I get out of these comparisons, into some of a higher nature, you will find
that betwixt Princes that are in the strongest league, there is jealousy if
one do but raise forces, (though with no intent of the least prejudice to the
other with whom he is at peace) the other will be so provided, as to be able in
some good measure to withstand that Invasion, (if intended against him) which
when time has declared it to have been needless, yet none can say but it was
providence, and notwithstanding this, there is no exception taken on either
side at what was acted or done, nor can the Army justly except against your
putting your self in a posture of defense, for your Declaration will show the
candor of your intentions.

But when all this is done the least part of the wound is cured, there stands
open yet the satisfying the debts of the Kingdom due to the Army, and other
Soldiers, and to the Scots, and other ways: It were very good if a Compute
could be made what is owing and what is to be found at present to enable
toward payment; and to consider what is the yearly In-come of the Excise,
Customs, etc. that one being considered against the other, it may be known
how long that burden must be borne, and in the mean time that all exorbitant
fees may be taken off, and a competency allowed which may sufficiently
countervaile the pains any one takes, and no more, the rest will help to
discharge the public debts.

There is also not only a great burden of cost, but of violence on this poor
Kingdom, by Committees of all parts of the Kingdom; you cannot but have
complaints of every side, of the abuses and wrongs they have done, they have
been slow of hearing when they should do Justice, or make Repayment of any
money missaid, although most authenticke proofs have been given, and the
delays have been more tedious then the first wrong: but they have been
infinitely nimble in catching at the least show of information against any man,
and have made no dainty of doing Justice (in their sense) against such men with
a great deal of Dexterity; but O how hard it is for these men to right an
Innocent when it plainly appears they have wronged him, and how untoward it is
for them to untread the steps they have gone in? truly he that has received
remedy against this wrong, may be accounted as single as it is said the Phoenix
is in the world, or as rare as a black Swan; It will questionless be a great
satisfaction to all England, if these Committees may be brought to give a just
account of all they have received, and that honest men by them wronged, (under
pretense of doing service to the State, when indeed they had only selfe-ends)
might have leave to right themselves in a lawful way; I do verily believe
that so much naughtiness would be proved against the most part of them, as
your ears would tingle to hear them; This is another grievance to the
Kingdom, which if removed, would be a means of much quiet over all the Land:
But this is not all, there is another thing, (which I propose to the
consideration of your wisdoms) to be done for the future quiet and good of
this Kingdom, (for if we endeavor only the appeasing and accommodating of
the present, without looking to what may ensue, we shall not be clear of our
troubles, fears or charges) which is the bringing in of the King on such
conditions, as may be Honorable for him, and safe and profitable for the
Kingdom; that we may be happy in His Government, and He rich in our Love; and
that he may be feared abroad, as much as beloved at home. I believe many may
at first startle, and object against this, when they consider things past, but
let them well weigh all circumstances, and it will be seen that there cannot
be a more effectual remedy for our present disease; and it will also avert
from us the evils that are threatened, if the King be not brought in; for first,
but look to the affections of the people every where, and you will find that
their hearts are toward their King, all those that wished ill to his cause,
are for the most part now most affectionate to his Person; in the City likewise
you may observe the same, they generally say and find, that it appears
plainly they were evil instruments that led him away, but that now there is no
fault to be found in Him, the worst that is pressed against Him is the not
signing the Propositions, which his Magnanimity cannot suffer him to do; those
which may stand with his Honor he refuses not, but no private man would be
brought to desert his friend, so far as to condemn him to death because he
stood firm by him, (though in playing an ill game) much less can the generous
mind of a Prince be brought to do it; you have found by experience that what
the peoples mind most inclines unto, at last takes effect; and this is as
likely as any thing else, and peradventure (if your wisdoms do not take the
opportunity whilst it offers) it may be (by means which neither I nor you do
know or can imagine) brought to effect, at such a time when there will be no
opportunity, (as now) of making such wholesome and safe conditions for the
peoples good, as now there is; Therefore if a good accord were made with the
King, we should soon find, (and that sensibly) the benefit of it. For,

It will be a means of allaying all division among us.

It will excuse infinite and vast Sums which must be disbursed if division
enter once among us, for at last the Public must bear all the burden.

It will be a means of keeping the Scots our Brethren from coming in, which
you may perceive they have an intention to do, by their proceeding ever since
the King was taken from Holdenby: and how chargeable their coming will be you
are not Ignorant of: and although their money, and consequently other moneys
have been Leavyed in a way that at present seems not burden some, yet it is a
way that keeps the Excise longer on foot, and consequently a yoke of too long
a continuance on the necks of English men, who are altogether unfit to plough
with such harness, and it is pity but the best way should be thought on for a
speedy period unto it, rather then any manner of way to admit of any thing,
that may in the least degree threaten a prolonging of it further then already
it needs must.

Now that I have explained my self as you see, I shall contract all into a few
heads, humbly desiring that a favorable construction may be made of all what
I have and shall deliver, and that it may be taken in the sense as I desire to
be understood, that is, to endeavor the making up of all breaches, and the
quenching of all sedition and heartburning among us, and taking away the
causes, and that righteousness and justice may take place: and if I have any
particular end of my own, or other respect then the public good, and the
peace of England, I do desire Almighty God not to give me my portion in a
better Kingdom then any I can expect here on earth. Having thus cleared the
way for your good opinion of me, I proceed to the heads of what I have proposed.

I. That your wisdoms would reflect and consult whether it be not needful for
the City to be ready in a posture of defense against all what may offer,
setting forth your declaration for the satisfaction of all the Kingdom. II.
Whether it be not convenient and most necessary for the ground of our quiet, to
Petition the Parliament, and to deal with the Army, that the King may be
speedily admitted upon Honorable and safe Conditions. III. Whether it be not
fit to Petition the Parliament, that a Compute of the Public debts, and the
In-comes also of the State may be made, and what there is in being to make
satisfaction, that the Kingdom may in some good measure, be satisfied how
long the Excise may last, (which in some parts of the Kingdom costs more then
half of the value, in the very Collection (by which means the Parliament gets
hatred, and the State little benefit:) also that those Members that have had
Offices of profit in the Public, whether it be convenient to put them in
mind, that they hasten in the Moneys so received into Guild Hall, according to
the Votes of the self-denying Ordinance lately passed; which Moneys will serve
(in part) to defray these necessary charges the present occasions require. IV.
Whether it be not very needful to Petition that the Committees may cease, and
that they give in their accounts, and that it may be permitted to those that
find themselves wronged, to have recourse against them: for it is presumed that
what they have done (in many particulars) in name of the State, has not been
so applied, but to their private uses; there can come no discommodity by it,
for if they have been just, and acted no farther then Law and a good
conscience, the Law will then clear them; If they have defrauded the State,
there will be money discovered for the public, (in case it do not belong to
any wronged party) or if they have wronged and undone men and families by
oppression and injustice, no good man but would give his consent, that they
should smart for it, and become an example to posterity to perform their trust
more justly. V. Whither it be not convenient to Petition the Parliament, that
some speedy message, be delivered to the Scotte Commissioners, declaring your
desires that our Brethren the Scots would not think of coming into this
Kingdom with an Army, till they see further cause or more ground for it. VI.
Whether your mediation and interposition to the Parliament be not behooveful,
that the armies desires may be granted so far as they tend to the good of the
Kingdom, and that they would concede for the trial of whom the Army does
accuse, in a Parliamentary way; and also whether the like mediation with the
Army be not to be used, (for the sweetning of their distastes) by devising
some honest and lawful means of rayfing their pay, and endeavoring to take
of all kind off bitterness, that things may be brought to an end, in the
least rigid way as may be; so that at last an act of oblivion may be set
forth, that all men may be secured from their fears, which will in a short
time bring us again in our right temper of loving one another as for merly.
These Lines are in all humble manner tendered to the grave consideration of
this wise Council, by a true-hearted and well-affected Englishman, (with a
submission to your judgments either to add unto, or to take from it, as your
judgments shall think most fit) for the taking off these eminent dangers and
charges that threaten us, and for the settling of a sure and substantial peace,
till when it is hard to be resolved whether the work of Ireland can go forward
or backwards; but that effected, we may well hope (through the mercy of God) to
hold up our heads again, and to be able to reduce to due obedience that bloody
Nation. Had I been in place to have spoken, I would have saved the labor of
writing, but my abilities are not such, as to make me worthy to sit there; or
had time but permitted for the collection of hands, (for the desires of many
thousands in this City go along with it) you should have had it presented in a
Petitionall way; but the occasion being pressing, I thought all time too long
till I had expressed my duty to my Country, in the manner as you see: If I do
not name my self now, I desire it may admit of the most favorable
construction, it shall be sufficient to me, if I may be conscious to my self
of doing any good to my Country, without seeking applause for the same; the
nearest way to do it, is to persuade (if it be possible) that you would be
Moderators betwixt the Parliament and the Army, and withal Mediators, it is a
fit work for so noble a City; as you are eminent, so is the Work; as you have
been potent in the War, so you may be powerful in making peace; take
encouragement to undertake it, and doubtless God will give a blessing to your
pious intentions.

This Narrative was thus directed, To his much respected friend Mr. George
Thomason Stationer at the Rose and Grown in Paul's Churchyard. June, 24. 1647.

Sir, Mr. George Thomason. you are in earnest manner desired to present this
enclosed according to direction, if possible, with your own bands, I doubt not
but the Relation of the contents in the Common Council (to whom it is
addressed within) when read, will make you think your pains not ill employed,
for there is nothing in it but what each true Englishman wishes and desires.
