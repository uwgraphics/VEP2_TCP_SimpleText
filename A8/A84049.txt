THE EPITAPH Of the most Renowned and Illustrious Capt. WILLIAM BEDLOE.
STay Passenger! I am no common Stone,
The Dust's not Vulgar which I lie upon:
This is the Mighty Captain Bedloe's Grave,
Now honest Protestant, though once Popish Knave,
Who falsely Men out of their lives did Swear,
And with his Tongue more Men than Hands did fear:
That nimble Weapon he would so finely use,
That He Three Kingdoms with it did abuse:
Noll's Sword did do no more; Yet this great Wight,
(As once the Giants,) did against Heaven fight:
False Oaths on Oaths he laid, the Bulk did rise
Into a Teneriff of PERJURIES;
On which base Mount he stood, add Heaven did dare,
At the Old Bailey too and Impious War;
For who false Oath does take, at that bold hit,
Does in the face of his Creator spit;
Such Christians who should be his Friends, do use
Crist worse, then did his Foes the Jews:
They knew not what they did when He did Die,
These knowing Christians do Christ Crucify
With loathsome Oaths, which more prevails
On's Sacred Virgin-flesh, then did the Nails
Which pierced his Hands and Feet when He did Die,
To save this Villain on Mount Calvery:
But Heaven's asleep, at which Mortals wonder,
Fearing he has forgot against Sin to Thunder;
Or else this Fiddlers Son could never have Died,
The Peoples Sorrow, almost Deify'd:
Who as their second Savior they Bewail,
And have forgot He once did Horses steal.
No, no; we Judge according to our Sense,
Which cannot futhom Ocean-Providence,
Which Buoys those up who in it boldy strive
(...) u^e,
That He Three Kingdoms with it did abuse:
Noll's Sword did do no more; Yet this great Wight,
(As once the Giants,) did against Heaven fight:
False Oaths on Oaths he laid, the Bulk did rise
unto a Teneriff of PERJURIES;
On which base Mount he stood, add Heaven did dare,
At the Old Bailey too and Impious War;
For who false Oath does take, at that bold hit,
Does in the face of his Creator spit;
Such Christians who should be his Friends, do use
Crist worse, then did his Foes the Jews:
They knew not what they did when He did Die,
These knowing Christians do Christ Crucify
With loathsome Oaths, which more prevails
On's Sacred Virgin-flesh, then did the Nails
Which pierced his Hands and Feet when He did Die,
To save this Villain on Mount Calvery:
But Heaven's asleep, at which Mortals wonder,
Fearing he has forgot against Sin to Thunder;
Or else this Fiddlers Son could never have Died,
The Peoples Sorrow, almost Deify'd:
Who as their second Savior they Bewail,
And have forgot He once did Horses steal.
No, no; we Judge according to our Sense,
Which cannot futhom Ocean-Providence,
Which Buoys those up who in it boldy strive
To Swim, but Drowns who in it needs will dive;
Although his Body under Marble lies,
His Soul in living Flames, still living Dies;
And when Gods Judgement's over for our Sins,
Then, then, his Wrath against his Comeradeas begins;
Which when those Perjured Villains cannot skip,
He Will burn the Rod which once his Child did whip.
Reader, Pass on, and in thy Heart when gone,
With horror write, what is here now writ in Stone.
