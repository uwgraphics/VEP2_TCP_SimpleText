A DECLARATION OF The bloody and unchristian acting of WILLIAM STAR, and JOHN
TAILOR OF WALTON, With diverse men in women's apparel, in opposition to those
that dig upon George-hill in Surrey, etc.
UPon the 11. day of June 1649. four men only being fitting and preparing the
ground for a winter season, upon that Common called George-hill, there came to
them, William Starr of Walton, and John Tailor, two freeholders, being on
horseback, having at their heels some men in women's apparel on foot, with
every one a staff or club, and as soon as they came to the diggers, would not
speak like men, but like bruit beasts that have no understanding, they fell
furiously upon them, beating and striking those four naked men, beating them
to the ground, breaking their heads, and sore bruising their bodies, whereof
one is so sore bruised, that it is feared he will not escape with life.

These four men all the time were quiet and patient, willing and resolving to
deliver up their lives unto their Creator at that time, knowing no other, but
that the others purpose was to murder; and it is believed, when those furious
devils Tailor and Starr went from them, they thought they had been dead, in
regard they left them feeble, and weak, and sore wounded, lying upon the
ground, yet after some time recovering strength, three were able to rise and
walk, the fourth that is in danger of his life was brought home in a cart,
being not able to move: yet very cheerful all of them in spirit, not willing
to seek revenge, but have committed their cause to him that judges righteously,
to whom vengeance belongs, resolving as soon as their bodies are well, to go on
in that righteous work: and if the Father have purposed that the life of their
bodies must be sacrificed, to justify this cause, they find a quiet and
contented willingness to submit to his will. One thing may be observed to set
forth the malicious wickedness in Tailor and Star, which is this:

These four men desired that they would bring them before their Law to answer
in justification of the work, yet those devils, with the men in women's
apparel, would not agree to that, but fell on, beating with their long staves
upon their bodies without mercy, a testimony sufficient that this cause of
digging is just and good, in regard of the furious and bloody actings of men
against such as carry on the work with love and patience, which is a strange
thing in a Christian Land, and done by such men as are professing Christians;
considering withal, that these diggers do only make use of the Commons, seeing
they have paid taxes, and given free quarter; and therefore by the Law of
contract, ought to have freedom therein, as well as the freeholders have
freedom in their Enclosures; the diggers declaring, they will neither meddle
with Corn, Cattle, nor enclosure Land, but only in the Commons; and that they
are ready to answer to all the Laws of the Land as Defendents, but not as
Plaintiffs. Surely this fury in the freeholders declares plainly, that they
got their Lands, both they and their Fathers, by murder, violence, and theft,
and they keep it by the same power, in regard they will not speak like men, but
fight and devour like beasts. Well let the world take notice, that we that do
justify this cause of digging, have obeyed the Lord, in setting forward this
work of endeavoring to bring the earth into a Community, and we have peace and
purposes to go on, and we are lively witnesses, and shall be at the day of
Judgment, against these and all others that have and may so furiously oppose
us; and rebelliously fight against the Prince of Peace, the great Savior that
is now spreading himself in the earth to bring all things into a oneness, and
to deliver the Creation from bondage.

Right understanding and peace among brethren, is the strength of a Land,
ignorance and fury brings shame and destruction. England is a Land, wherein the
Power of the most High has greatly declared his Power, both in casting down
the pride of many men's hearts, and making them subject to righteousness, and
in casting down the bodies of some that were proud oppressors to be as dung to
the earth, dashing one power against another, changing times and customs, and
therein trying the sincerity of many that make a great show of love to him.

Every one that seems to prevail over another, says, God gave him the
victory, though his conquest be tyranny over his brother, making the King of
Righteousness the Author of sorrows, and comfort, not knowing the distinction
between the power of darkness and the power of light: Victories that are got
by the sword, are but victories of the Murderer, and the joy of those
victories is but the joy of Caine, when he had killed his brother Abel; the
Dragon has fought against the Dragon, and one part conquered another, and
great joy has been amongst the Midianites for those victories, and the King of
Righteousness has been a looker on, and suffered them to break each other to
pieces, that his power at last might come in.

But now O England know this, that thy striving now is not only Dragon against
Dragon, Beast against Beast, Covetousness and Pride against Covetousness and
Pride, but thou now begin'st to fight against the Lamb, the Dove, the meek
Spirit, the power of love, and wilt not willingly suffer that Prince of Peace
to have a house to dwell in upon earth, (which is humane bodies) but seekst to
imprison, beat, kill, or else to withdraw all assistance of favor from them:
Well, thou have rejoiced in thy former victories one beast over another, and
thou have had, and may have seeming victories over the Lamb, and may rejoice;
but know, that this stone (which is alone) against whom thou have begun to lift
up thy heel, shall grind thee to powder. Love suffers under thy fury, love
suffers under thy hypocrisy, under thy pride, careless, covetous,
hardhearted, self-seeking children. Love bears all things patiently, he suffers
thee to reproach, to fight, to oppose, and to rejoice in doing those things.
Love secretly seeks thy preservation, but thou openly seek his destruction,
and glories like a man that has put off his armor at every seeming show of
victory: but the battle between the Dragon and the Lamb is begun in the midst
of thee, and a few years now will let all the world see who is strongest, love
or hatred, freedom or bondage.

Therefore thy battles now are not as they were, for now the Lord, the Prince
of Peace comes to save thee, and thou fight'st against him as an enemy, and
wilt not be saved by him, he calls for Peace, thou cal'st for war, he calls to
Freedom, thou cal'st still for bondage, he says put up thy Sword and live in
love, thou say draw the Sword against all that will live in love. Well,
England take thy course, but know for all this thou shall come to Judgment.

FINIS.
