A DISCOVERY OF THE Intentions of the Army, under the command of the Lord
FAIRFAX, more then probably collected out of some words used on Saturday the
first of July 1648. by one in Southwarke, who is well known to be very
intimate with the said Army, and is a great Agent for them. Which words are
truly and faithfully related here below, and were occasioned by a Discourse
between the said Agent, and an honest Loyal Subject, who so well loves his
King and Country, that he wishes all that shall read or hear this, to
consider of it, and compare it with the Actions of the said Army; and judge
what a sad condition our most Royal Sovereign and his Kingdoms are in, if
this Army should prevayle; which God forbid!
The Words are these: That if the King were now in the Army, they would murder
him.

That when the Army has beaten Colchester, and all the rising Counties, they
will go to the house of Commons, and pull out one hundred of them, and put in
others of their own choosing, and then will they divide and share the Kingdom
between them.



IT is therefore desired, that the people of this City and Kingdom, would take
notice of the merciless dealing that is used toward his Majesty; in that
notwithstanding so great evidence that has been made of the truth of that
horrid and hellish plot to take away the life of his Majesty by poison, or
otherwise, and the strong presumptions that Colonel Hamond, entrusted with the
custody of the Kings person, was privy to the design, as is intimated in the
Letter of Mr. Osborne to the Lord Wharton; The King is yet still left in the
hands of the said Col Hamond. No course taken for the trial of Rolph, nor for
the further discovery of this hellish plot, nor yet to prevent the execution of
the same or the like, upon the person of the King; but rather encouragement
given to the proceeding therein, by letting the Lord Wharton, who is accused
as guilty in concealing the business, go free.
