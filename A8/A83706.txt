THe House of Commons, upon late Information received from their Armies in
Ireland, have tenderly considered the great extremities they are in, with their
constant resolutions to proceed in that work, notwithstanding all difficulties;
and thereupon, having now laid a certain foundation of credit for the
encouragement of their Forces there, do Order, That it be published to morrow
the 28. of August, 1644. in the several Churches in and about London, That the
Adventurers do meet on Friday at Two of the clock in the afternoon at
Grocers-Hall, where a Committee of the House of Commons is Ordered to meet
them, for the present raising of some provision on this foundation of Credit,
for the relief of those who stand so resolutely for maintenance of the common
Cause; And all the Ministers in London, and within the Lines of Communication,
are then to recommend the success of this affair unto God in their prayers with
Thanksgiving, for Gods great Blessing on their late endeavors; And to stir up
the several Adventurers, not to fail of this meeting, as they tender the good
of Ireland.

27. August. 1644.
ORdered that this Order be forthwith printed and published, and carefully
dispersed:
