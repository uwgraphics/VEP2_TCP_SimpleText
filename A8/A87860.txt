TO HIS VERY LOVING FRIENDS, The High Sheriff, and Justices of Peace of the
County of SURREY.
GENTLEMEN;
IT is now some months since that the Protestation taken by the Lords, and
House of Commons, was sent down into the Country, with an expectation that it
should be generally taken throughout the Kingdom, for a testimony of their
good concurrence with the Parliament, but through the remissness of some of
those that had the care of recommending it to others, very many there be that
have not hitherto taken it. Now the House of Commons having discovered many
dangerous designs plotted against the Parliament; and especially that of the
fourth of this instant January, which had it taken effect would have stricken
not only at the Privileges, but the very being of Parliaments, as will more
appear by the Declaration herewith sent unto you, which the House desires you
to publish throughout all parts of the County, Have thought fit once again to
recommend the taking of this Protestation; And have therefore commanded me in
their Name to desire you the High Sheriff, and the Justices of the Peace of
that County, to meet together in one place as soon as possibly you may, and
there to take the Protestation your selves; and then dispersing your selves
into your several Divisions, that you will call together the Minister, the
Constables, Churchwardens, and Overseers of the poor of every Parish, and
tender unto them the Protestation to be taken in your presence; And to desire
of them, that they will very speedily call together the Inhabitants of their
several Parishes, both Householders and others being of Eighteen years of age,
or upwards, into one or more places, according to the largeness of their
Parishes, and to tender unto them the same Protestation to be taken in their
presence, and to take the names of those that do take, and do refuse to take
the same Protestation, and to return them unto your selves at such time as you
shall appoint, which the House desires may be so speedily, as that you likewise
may return such Certificate, as you receive from them, to the Knights and
Burgesses serving for that County, if the same County be within sixty miles of
London, before the twentieth day of February next; And if the said County be
above sixty miles distant from London, then before the twelfth of March next,
wherein the House desires your greatest Care and Diligence, as a matter very
much importing the good both of the King and Kingdom, which being all I have
in command, I rest

Your very loving friend WILLIAM LENTHALL, SPEAKER.

SIR,
I Have lately received a Letter from the Speaker of the House of Commons now
assembled in Parliament, the Copy whereof is abovementioned: I desire you,
according to the directions in the said Letter, to meet with the rest of the
Justices of Peace (to whom I have written to the same purpose) and my self at
Kingston in the Town Hall there on Thursday being the tenth day of this instant
February, by nine of the Clock in the fore-noon, to perform that which we are
thereby required.

Your very loving friend
2. Febr. 1641.
