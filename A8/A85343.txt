To the Lord General Fairfax.
My Lord,
THis plain Pamphlet was written partly for your sake, and those under your
Command, that you may at length consider what necessity lies upon you, to
secure your selves, and settle this Kingdom by an humble, honorable, and speedy
reconcilement with His Majesty. Know this, that what I have written here, is
written courageously, and without respect of Persons: And because the truth of
it is of so universal concernment, that it requires the perusal of all sores
of men within the Kingdom, I have sent it abroad in a more homely style than
usual, that it may find entertainment in the meanest capacities.

The reason that induced me to make this Address unto your Lordship is,
because it aims principally at your Interest, who are the Captain of that
Army, which hitherto has lengthened our miseries by breach of Faith with the
King, and Kingdom: And though I am apt to believe (as well as others) that you
had the least share in that odious and abominable design of imprisoning our
Sovereign; yet the world knows you may (if you please) and is almost
persuaded you will, become the happy instrument of his deliverance. It is the
humor of our own and other Nations to talk, as if the Military Affairs were
swayed wholly by your Lievtenant-Generall. I cannot tell how far he and his
potent Party may have wrought upon you heretofore by specious Arguments, or
presumed to act many Extravagancies at such a time when you could not safely
oppose them; but this I assuredly know, that they are all laid upon your score,
and that now is the time wherein you may quit scores, and become your self,
who of your self (I am confident) are endued with such excellent principles of
honor, reason, and resolution, that you cannot but do like your self, having
so fair an opportunity.

Nor is it may opinion only, but the hope and persuasion of many gallant men,
which yet retain some thoughts of honor concerning you, for your bravery and
civility in your Conquests. Oh, let not the memory of them (which may be
applauded in aftertimes, though not for the Cause, yet for the gallant
performance) be obliterated by sinister and prodigious undertakings! Remember
that you stand in the rank of Nobility, and may transmit this honor with the
addition of greater, unto your Posterity; acquit then your self nobly, and let
not the fountain from whence you derived your honor, be thus profaned, and
vilified by the very filth of the people. Consider the miseries that must fall
upon your Country, by an Army of hungry Strangers now ready to invade us:
Imagine that the eyes of the Nation are upon you, as one that may prevent all,
or at least shorten their abode here, by uniting with his Majesty. Banish that
accursed Principle of not trusting an injured Prince, which becomes none but
implacable and incorrigible Traitors. See that such Terms be propounded unto
him, that may not clash either with his Conscience or Honor, that it may appear
unto all men, you desire Peace at his hands, who is the most peaceable, pious,
gracious Prince living. But if you entertain other Counsels, know that you
will be looked on by the people, as the cause of all those desolations which
shall befall them; and the time of Revenge will come, (from above) wherein you
shall with sorrow, confess your neglect of this honest Advice, given from a
private hand, that would think it an honor to kiss yours, if your Lordship
please first to kiss Majesty's, upon just and honorable conditions.

Good English: OR, Certain Reasons pointing out the safest way of settlement
in this Kingdom.
Drawn from the nature of the aims, and Interests of the several parties
engaged; and as the case now stands, this second day of May, 1648.
First, by reasons drawn from the Interest of the Royal Episcopal Party.
HIs Majesty must owe the ruin of his affairs, to the emulation of his
Superior Officers, and the security and intemperance of the Inferior. The
Houses (though Conquerors) must attribute the great deficiency and instability
of their affairs, to private Interest and Faction; the very Twins of all
popular engagements.

The Factions are divided into these two notions, Presbyterian, and
Independent; both of them humors inconsistent with the true temper of the Body
Politic of England: And they may fitly be compared unto two poisons of a
contrary quality, which maintaining a war within the Body natural, vex it with
many dire symptoms, to the disturbance of the whole Economy; and never rest,
till being evacuated by some strong Purger, or else tired out by re-action, the
strife ends: And so nature recovering her first vigor, reduces the Body into
its former state.

Such as the event in this case, is in the body of man, the like may we expect
at length, to be the issue of these counter-workings of the two venomous
Factions, within the bowels of this Land. For, it must needs be, either that
in long running they will tire out each other; or else the Constitutions of the
people not being able to bear them any longer, they may at last be vomited out
of the Nation. But rather than the Kingdom should be tormented, in expectation
of the issue of so pernicious a Conflict betwixt those two extremes, it were
convenient, his Majesty, as a third party, should speedily clap in, to balance
the one against the other, or else conquer both; there being but these two
ways to end the Controversy.

Touching the Conquest of both (though it be the farthest way about) he has
one maine advantage which may carry him through with the work; and that is the
large Empire which he yet holds in the hearts of his people, which is
exceedingly confirmed and daily augmented, by reason of those intolerable
burdens that lie upon them; the sense whereof makes them look upon the King,
as their companion in misery, and on the two Factions, as the Fountains from
whence all these evils flow.

As for Foraine aids, it is confessed, the Affairs of Christendom are at this
time so disposed, and every Potentate so exhausted, or engaged, that some want
leisure; others, ability to assist him: And others that have both ability, and
leisure, yet refrain out of some particular Reasons of State. The Spaniard
has his hands full every way, and has more cause to seek to repair
himself, than assist others: The French are his Invaders; the Portugalls,
Revolters; and the Neapolitans, Rebels.

The French are busy in maintaining what they have gotten, and seeking after
more: But if they were at leisure, little might be expected from them, unless
it were to foment our differences, and as they first helped to unsettle us, so
still to keep us from settling, that England (which is the ballancing power of
Europe, and her King Arbiter orbis Christiani, the Arbitrator in all
differences of Christendom) being broken by her own strength at home, might
have none to spend abroad, to hinder that prodigious design, wherein the late
successes of the French have heightened them to become Rivalls and Competitors
with the Spaniard, for an Universal Monarchy.

Denmark has enough to do in repairing those ruins, which were brought on
them by the late Swedish Incursions.

The Hollanders esteem it a safe way to conform themselves ever to the
prevailing party in England, seeing they have a great part of their livelihood
by Indulgence from the English Nation: Moreover, though at first they esteemed
the Match of the Prince of Orange with the eldest daughter of England, as a
matter of much honor; yet now they look upon it as a business that in time
may prove of ill consequence; fearing so great an alliance might dispose the
Prince to aspire, and establish a greater Interest of his own, than is meet for
a Member of a Republike, if Monarchy were at its height again in England. And,
further many among the Dutch, supposing that the Grandees here aim at the same
form of Government with themselves, do flatter themselves in conceit, that
such a neighborhood would be willing to admit of a nearer friendship and
complication of Interests, than can be hoped for from a Monarchy, though there
be far more reason to suspect the contrary.

So that we see how little his Majesty may expect from any of his Neighbors:
And truly, it is no small part of our happiness in the midst of these
distractions, that we have had, and are like to have, so little of their
Company.

The hopes then of his Majesty's restitution being wholly founded upon the
affections of his People, and bounded within his own Dominions, let us take a
view of each within their station. The Scots seem to be divided among
themselves; some pretend absolutely for his Majesty; others, only upon
condition of signing the Covenant etc. In Ireland a Cessation will open a way
for supplies out of that Kingdom. In Wales, they are in arms already for his
Majesty, and all the Royal Party in England wait but for an Opportunity in the
same way, to free themselves from their present vassalage, under the power of
the Independent party in the Houses; wherein likewise the Presbyterian party
are as much concerned as any, seeing the other of Brethren, are become their
bitter enemies, and would show them as little courtesy, as others, were it not
to stop the mouths of their leading men at home, and in hope to work upon the
prime Presbyters in Scotland.

What the Refult of the Scottish resolutions will be, is yet not certainly
known. If the pretending royal party there carry an Engagement simply for the
King, no doubt but the Royallists here joining with them, they may finish the
work by subduing both the Factions: But if they bring in a mixed Engagement, for
the King and the Covenant (which we have great cause to fear,) I conceive the
Royallists ought not to join with them, but to expect and endeavor a Close
with the Independent party; who will be forced for their own safety, to wave
their high-flowne Resolutions, and bethink themselves of a Compliance with his
Majesty; which ought rather to be sought after and embraced (as less dangerous
to the royal Prerogative) than a close with the Presbyterian.

Touching the probabilitv and convenience of a Compliance betwixt his Majesty
and the Independent party, in case the Scots engage for Presbytery, I shall
endeavor to fortify my opinion by undeniable Reasons: But first give me leave
to manifest the great danger of closing with the Presbyterian Party, though
accompanied with never so many specious pretenses.

That a Scottish Engaging for the Covenant (resolved on, as it seems) will be
clearly destructive to Monarchical Interest, I shall prove in several
particulars. First, because they aim thereby at the introduction of
Presbytery, and the over-turning of Episcopacy, the maine pillar of Monarchy,
as it has ever been esteemed in this Nation. And therefore it was, that all
the Kings of England, from time to time, have so willingly sworn, to grant and
to preserve unto the Bishops, and to the Churches committed to their Charge, all
Canonical privileges, and due Law and Justice, and to protect and defend them
etc. And King JAMES, who had long experience of the sad effects of the
alteration of that Government in the Church of Scotland, was so fully convinced
of the near relation betwixt Episcopacie and Monarchy, that he left this for
a sure Aphorism to his Posterity, No BISHOP No KING. For, it having been of so
long continuance here, and deeply rooted in the Laws of this Kingdom, it must
needs be that a change in the one, will work an alteration in the other.

Secondly, The Truth hereof was so well known to the Masterbuilders of this
Reformation, whose Aim appears now to have been ab origin (how contrary
soever their Pretenses were) for an alteration of the civil government; that
they first began their work with pulling down of Episcopacie, that in the
ruins thereof they might lay the foundation of their new design.

Thirdly, It is very apparent of what ill consequence, the extirpation of
Episcopacie will be to his Majesty, seeing it is a means to clip the Crown of
a very considerable part of its Revenues, which by the Laws of the Land, are
annexed thereunto; as the collation of Bishoprics and Deaneries; the first
fruits and profits of their Lands and Revenues, during their vacancies; the
first fruits and yearly Tenths out of all Ecclesiastical Promotions; and
sundry other privileges, profits, and emoluments, arising out of the State
Ecclesiastical.

Fourthly, to engage for Presbytery, is to endeavor the introducing of a
Democraticall form of Government, which is directly incompatible with a
Monarchy; and as it cannot stand with the power of our government, so it
withstands the Honor of our Governer, debasing the Majesty of Monarchy into a
popular parity, without respect of his most sacred Person.

Fifthly, by engaging for Presbytery, they labor to erect a power in the State
Ecclesiastical distinct from that of the Civil: for it is a Maxim among all
Presbyters, and we find it pleaded for at large in the Confession of Faith
agreed upon by the Assembly at Westminster (which as yet the Houses have been
more wise than to confirm) that there ought to be a power in the Church
distinct from that of the Civil: which Tenet of distinction must be the same
in effect with that of the Church of Rome's supremacy; seeing, those which now
plead for a power without the Civil, will not be long before they arrive to
such a height of presumption, as to act above it, or against it, in pursuance
of their own designs. It will be a hard matter to keep such a Governmeut
within its limits, in any Commonwealth, and therefore with much difficulty
will it submit to be governed by a free Monarchy; especially a Democracie of
this new Nature, which makes the same Persons civil Subjects, and
ecclesiastical Superiors.

Sixthly, it is not like that Presbytery should prove the Mother of Peace,
considering that she was born the Daughter of sedition, and has ever since
been nursed up by Tumults and Rebellion. For, Geneva was the Land of her
Nativity, where M. Calvin was her Father; and no doubt, considering the state
of those Affairs and conditions of men, among whom he was conversant, it was a
commendable invention, and very necessary for bridling the tumultuous Humors in
a free City; And so far we may believe he intended it, yielding to a popular
Parity, and not as an universal perpetual form of government for all reformed
Churches.

Seventhly, it is observable, that this ill weed has grown in none but
popular gardens, in some parts of France and Germany, till some seditious
Planters and Waterers, caused it to spring up among the Thistles of Scotland:
And of what sad consequence it has proved to Monarchical government in that
Kingdom, let the world judge: For, the Foundation of it was laid in the ruin
of our King's Grandmother, and the superstructure continued, to the perpetual
discontent and vexation of his Father, till he was most happily possessed of
the Crown of England; Nor could he have been secure here, but that by his
great wisdom he staved it off: And now at length, the Faction having with
great subtilty gotten footing in this Kingdom, we see at this day, how fair a
stroke it has given toward the ruin of his Son, our most gracious Sovereign,
and his whole Posterity. For, though he languish now under the power of the
other Faction, yet the first design of war was laid in and by Presbytery, and
his Majesty suffered Restraint first under the Presbyterian power; whose
audacious carriage toward his Person, in hope to tire him out of his noble
principles, taught others so much impudence, as to endeavor to serve their
ends upon him, by a close imprisonment.

Eighthly, seeing His Majesty is resolved to keep so close to his Principles,
(as is well known unto all the world) that he will never yield to the
extirpation of Bishops, what then may we expect from a Presbyteriall
Engagement, but that when they have made use of the King's Name to quell the
Independent Faction, as the Independent did to quell them, they will upon his
Majesty's refusal of their demands, (which he has ever declared to be against
his conscience and honor) return again to their old vomi^, and either keep
his Majesty in the same condition he now is, or worse, till they can settle
themselves and their pernicious Presbytery, past all hope of remedy? And then
(perhaps) he shall be called out of prison to be manacled in his Throne, as his
Father was in Scotland, who could never act, but when they pleased to let him;
and then only according to their Directory of Kirk and State.

From hence (I conceive) we may positively and plainly affirm, that the Issue
of a Presbyterian Engagement (though ushered in with never so many specious
pretenses for his Majesty) will be utterly destructive to the Royal Interest
of this Kingdom: And therefore if the Scots come in upon such terms, the
Royal Party ought not to engage with them, nor to countenance them, but to
expect, and endeavor a Compliance with the Independent, as I shall further
illustrate by reason.

First, though some may object that it cannot stand with his Majesty's Honor to
comply with those, that have already abused his inclination in that particular:
yet if they duly consider, what urgencie lies at present upon his Majesty, and
how little hope there is of any better way of restitution, they may conceive it
far more politic to obey necessity, than stand upon nice Punctillo's of
honor; which I must confess a Prince in prosperity ought to have regard unto,
ad conservandam Majestatem Imperii; but if once he be trampled under the feet
of fortune, ceremonious respects must be laid aside, to Court the first
Opportunity, which reason shall point out, for a deliverance.

Secondly, if it be objected, that the Independent party have a design for
alteration of government, I answer, so I believe the Presbyters have too; only
here is all the difference betwixt them, that the Independents would not have a
King so much as in Name, the Scots Presbyters would have no more but the Name
of a King: The one aims downright at an Aristocraticall form of Government;
the other pretends to maintain Monarchical Government, yet actually destroys
the very Principles of Monarchy. And as for the Independent, it is clear by
their imprisoning of the King, their declaring against him, and to settle the
Kingdom without him, that they have had, and still may continue a design to
change the Kingly Government, and (in plain terms) declare themselves Free
Sates, if by any means they can allay the Scots: But there being little hopes
of that, we may guess how unable they are to maintain their Station, having
over-strained the sinews of the City, and the heart strings, of the Country;
and so it is probable they will scarce be so hardy as to venture, to stand upon
their single legs, against the stream of a general dis-affection at home,
and an invasion by their opposite Faction from abroad; but may, when there is
no hope of carrying on their design any longer that way, retreat with
moderation toward His Majesty.

Thirdly, seeing it is dangerous, in case the Scots come in for Presbytery,
that the Royal party should engage with them, it is all the reason in the
world they should with speed endeavor an Agreement with the Independent: For,
if Presbytery receive a foil from the Independents, then they will undoubtedly
be heightened with confidence to prosecute their design against Monarchy, and
(perhaps) in time attain so much power, as to establish themselves: And on the
other side, if Independency receive a foil from the Presbyters, then
Presbyteriall Government will usurp over Monarchy; both which inconveniences
will be prevented by a timely close with the Independent. For, there is no
other way to reestablish his Majesty, unless we suppose his Party able to
carry it by force of Arms against both the Factions: which (if it were
possible) cannot be effected without length of time, extreme difficulty, and
the sad consequences of a Second War.

Fourthly, an Agreement with the Independent is the only way to hinder a Second
war. For, They being Possessed of all, or most of the places of strength in
this Kingdom, and backed besides with an Army, it must needs be, that an
Engaging against them, cannot be carried on to a Conquest, but through a Sea of
Blood, and a general devastation: whereas an union betwixt them and his
Majesty, contracted upon moderate, just, and equitable grounds, in relation to
his Majesty's Interests and due Rights, and the People's Birthright, will be a
means not only to prevent the aforesaid Mischeife; but so quell the
Presbyterian Party in England, that they shall not be able to countenance any
Scottish designs: And so, if the Scots do attempt an Invasion upon any Pretense
whatsoever, the War will be brought home to their own doors.

Fifthly, seeing there is a necessity of some form, it is probable the
Compliance will extend so far, as to let us have Bishops again. And there is so
much the more hope, in regard the Independents have not yet absolutely agreed
to the settling of any one particular way of Church Government; the execution
of all Ordinances hitherto in relation to Presbytery, being permitted merely
out of policy to pacify that Faction for a time, and not out of any respect
to the Government it self; which they look upon as far more destructive to
liberty, and which brings in ten thousand such Inconveniences and Pressures, as
are not incident in a well-regulated Episcopacy.

Sixthly, if it be objected, that there is little hope of the Independents
yielding to Bishops, seeing they have been as deeply engaged in the sale of
their Lands, as ever Presbyters were; it must be considered, that what they
have done in this kind of Robbery, was only (as their elder Brethren the
Presbyters, gave them example) in order to their Design for alteration of
Government; which now being forced to quit (as anon I shall prove) by
invincible necessity, some other ways may and must be taken for the
satisfaction of the soldiery than by the Goods of the Church. And then
likewise it will be no hard matter to make our purchasing Cormorants, to vomit
up all their sweet Sacrilegious Morsels.

Lastly, though most of the Royal Party are rendered wholly averse to a Close
with the Independent Party, as Persons not to be dealt with, by reason of
their gross Juglings with his Majesty; yet give me leave to say, that as their
Ambition, avarice and overweening confidence, were the causes of their
declining those fair Proposals and Pretenses of their first Engagement,
supposing that then they had an Opportunity to do what they pleased; so now
being deceived in their expectations, and having found by experience, that they
are not able to go through with their Design; and it being clear also (as I
shall manifest) that they have no hope of Safety, or, continuance in this
Kingdom, but by a Cordial Close with his Majesty, we have little or no Cause
to fear a second Baffle upon sophistical Pretenses, in time to come;
especially if his Majesty's wisdom be laid in the Balance with their
Necessity.

And so for these Reasons I conceive, we may boldly affirm; that as the royal
Party ought by no means to admit of an Engagement with, or for Presbyterte (
though set on foot with the fairest Pretenses:) so their true Interest at
present is to seek, and embrace a timely discreet Compliance with that Party
Paramount of this Kingdom, which they call Independent.

II. Reasons drawn from the Interest of the ruling Independent Party.
WHen first his Majesty became a Prisoner to the Independent Party, the Kingdom
(as well as himself) was filled with great hope of such a mutual Compliance
betwixt him and them, as might usher in the long-desired settlement of this
distracted Nation: Our expectations in this particular were exceedingly
heightened by the many specious Declarations, Representations, and Proposalls,
sent abroad from the Army; which promised much, in relation to the just Rights
of his Majesty, and his Royal Posterity, and the true satisfaction of all
Interests, as well as their own; together with many glorious pretenses of
moderation toward those of the Royal Party, and the easing of all burdens
which lay upon the Subject.

These were indeed most rich and glorious pretenses: And without controversy
this way of Compliance was at that time their true Ineterest, and had they
prosecuted it according to their Proposalls, they had laid a stable foundation
of their own and the Kingdoms future happiness. But they, forsaking the true
paths which led to Peace, immediately fell a wandering from these Principles in
such an erroneous course, that as the wiser sort of men foresaw, so themselves
now begin to fear and feel, the fatal consequences of their wretched
dissimulation; which is like to bring no less sorrow upon the Ringleaders of
that Faction, than it has done already upon their Fellow Subjects, and their
Sovereign.

The Reasons which induced them to deal so perfidiously with his Majesty, were
(no doubt, as I mentioned before) Ambition and Avarice; as has since appeared
by their seizing all places of profit, in the hands of themselves, and their
Kindred, and Creatures: And also by their gross and palpable designings for a
change of Monarchical Government. Upon a Change (for certain) they were all
resolved; but what new form to introduce in the place of it, was unknown, and
is as yet at this day, even to the principal among themselves. For, as the
Cause at first was split into the two Factions of Presbyterian and Independent;
so this of Independency is sub-divided into that Party which is commonly called
Independent, and the other Party, most rightly called Levellers. The Grandees
of that Party commonly called Independent, are some of the superior Officers of
the Army, and Members of either House; the greatest part of whom are visible in
the State-Committee at Derby-house: And though when his Majesty was first
imprisoned, they then pretended, and would still seem, to be one in design
with the Levellers, yet time has manifested their aim to be at an
Aristocraticall Form of Government, and (in plain terms) to declare themselves
and their select Confederates FREE STATES.

The other Party called Levellers, consist only of some Colonells and
Commanders of Inferior Rank in the Army, with whom are joined some few Members
of the Commons House, and a confused Rabble of Sectaries in the Army, City, and
Suburbs, and some parts of the Country. Their aim is at a Democraticall form
of Government; investing the power wholly in the people: So that this wild
Faction ex professo, are enemies alike both to Monarchy and Optimacy, and will
be governed neither by Kings, nor States.

Hence it was, that as soon as his Majesty was juggled away into the Isle of
Wight, the superior Officers, in order to their State-designe, saw there was a
necessity of crushing the Levellers Party, after that they had served their
ends upon them, by drawing them into an engaging upon the same pretended common
Principles with themselves. And therefore their first work was with all speed
to dissipate the Council of the Army, contrary to their first engagement, and
surprise them with a new engagement at Ware, destructive to the other at
New Market; whereinto the Soldiery were partly allured by soothings, and
partly driven by terror, one of their fellow soldiers being condemned for
resistance, by a Council of War, and shot to death before their faces at the
general Rendezvous.

The Levellers Party being thus quelled, there remained yet one Rub more in the
way to this new STATE, and that was the Presbyter Party: As for the Royal
Party, they were crushed already, undone for want of their Estates, or by
unmeasurable Compositions to regain them, and their King reduced to a forlorn
despicable condition of imprisonment, so that it was presumed, he or they could
have little hope, or means to revive again: There remained then only the
Gulf of Presbytery to sail through to their desired Haven.

They knew very well, that the Breasts of the Presbyterians boiled high with
indignation and revenge against them, as their contrary Faction, that had
overawed and subdued them by force and subtilty, to become possessors of what
was once theirs, and share in the glory of that new Government, which had been
designed, and devoured in hope long before, by the Presbyters: Therefore the
Presbyterian being a potent Faction, by reason of the great interest it has in
the City of London, and their near union with Scotland, and indeed the major
Party in the House on their side, if it were not overawed; they judged it
necessary to bethink themselves of some way to pacify the Presbyterians. To
this end they first fell to bribing of the grand Presbyterian-sticklers in the
House, either with sums of money in recompense of pretended losses, or of
Arreares, or else with great Offices, which staid their stomachs, and held the
rest of the Presbyters in suspense, upon hope of the like in time according to
their merits.

As for the Scots, it was with high confidence presumed, that they might be
taken off upon good valuable Considerations; wherein the aspiring States have
not been wanting by prodigious Offers, though all will not prevail.

As for the City, if after the pacifying of the Presbyterian in the House, they
could likewise have made sure of the Scots connivence, the Presbyterian Party
of Londoners must have fallen of course, as not able to stand out by themselves.

And so here now we have a full view of the Design of the present ruling
Independent Party: For, if after they had crushed the Levellers, they could by
any means have made sure work with the Presbyters at home and in Scotland,
then there had been nothing betwixt them and home, but his Majesty and his
posterity, who being all of them at their Disposition and power, besides the
Prince, and he not likely to receive much comfort by succor from foraine
Parts, I leave the world to judge, what should have been the consequence of
their wretched design.

But since it appears (and themselves are now persuaded in their hearts,) that
God has otherwise determined concerning his sacred Majesty, and his numerous
flourishing posterity; seeing their last hopes fail them, and they begin to
languish in the Close of their Work, certainly it is high time to retreat,
before the Door be bolted against all hope of Pacification; and it must needs
be their true Interest, to recall his Majesty, to let him Treat with freedom,
and bethink themselves of some necessary expedients toward an honorable,
equal, and perfect reconciliation; as the only means, of safety to
Themselves, comfort to their afflicted King, and peace to these distressed
Kingdoms; which I shall endeavor to prove by strength of Reason.

First, though it be a Maxim among godless Statesmen, never to trust Princes
whom they have highly offended: yet if the Independent Grandees should have no
other assurance upon Agreement, than his Majesty's bare word for their
Jndempuity, I am confident they might trust him; it being a known Principle
ingrafted in his nature, not only by moral Impression, but also by Christian
persuasion, to forgive those that have persecuted him, and dispightfully ^used
him: For, undoubtedly, the whole Course of his life has manifested him (if men
would lay aside their Spleen, and but speak their Consciences) to be of a
most gracious inclination, equal to any of his Predecessors, and an exact
pattern of true Clemency to succeeding Generations.

Secondly, there is no doubt, but that upon Terms of Agreement, his Majesty
will condescend to give any real assurance for their security that shall in
reason be required; that is, so it extend not to the Infringement of his just
Rights and royal Prerogative: For, it must be ever supposed, that where an
Accommodation is intended betwixt adverse Parties, there must be a
Condescension on both sides, wherein the ordinary Principles of right Reason
and Equity must be the Rule: For, if either side keep to any one extreme, the
old enmity will never want Fuel, and so the very Pretenses of Accommodation
will be utterly destroyed, and end in more furious flames of Dissension.

Thirdly, there is a necessity of their Compliance with his Majesty, because
the hatred of the People is so great, that if once they receive a Foil upon
Battle; there is little possibility of recruiting, when the Hearts and purses
of both City and Country are shut against them: And therefore it were madness
for men to set their whole Stock at one Cast, and hazard the fortune of
themselves and Friends, upon the uncertain, chance of one single Conflict;
whereas wise men, before they pitch upon Enterprises of so high a Nature, cast
about rather how to repair themselves upon occasion of loss, than dream
altogether of Victory: For, such a provident Jealousy usually leads men to
fafety, whilst the consident imaginary prosperity of Fools destroys them.

Fourthly, None can have greater cause of Jealousy touching the success of
their own Affairs, than the present ruling Grandees now have: For, besides
the instability of their condition in respect of contrary Humors and parties
ready to engage against them at home, it is visible, that they will be invaded
from abroad. The Covenant-Faction of the Scots are concerned in point of
Interest, to wage war against them, for the restoring of their party again in
England; and his Majesty's Party in Scotland will not (as indeed they ought
not) stand neutrall: And though they have great hopes here, that the difference
between his Majesty's Party and the Covenanters there, touching the Nature of
an Engagement against England, may rise so high, as by busying them against
each other, to keep them from engaging this way at all; yet rather than suffer
things to remain at this pass in England, it is evident they will supersede
all bandyings among themselves, and consider of some middle way, wherein to
manage their Counsels and resolutions, to be revenged upon the Independent
Usurpers. Besides, it is very observable, that the late falling away in
Ireland, may from a cessation, proceed to a perfect Peace with the Irish, and
then both join in one against the Houses for the restoring of his Majesty. In
the mean time, the Cessation will make way for Supplies and auxiliary Forces
out of that Kingdom, to join with any discontented Party in this; where it is
evident, that the People are so far exasperated, that they will join with the
Scots, Irish; yea, or the Turk, upon hope of freeing themselves and restoring
their King, rather than continue in thraldom, at the will and pleasure of their
present Lords and Masters.

Fifthly, though the Houses have voted the sending of Forces over to hold play
with Inchiquin in Munster, and so to divert his intentions from England; yet
People are not so silly, but to see, they are so far unable to raise, or keep
up an Army in that Country, that they want wherewithal to maintain their own
in this. And moreover, they are now in so ill a condition to spare men, that
they dare not part with any considerable piece of this Army to reduce the
Welsh, for fear that if themselves were left naked, they might be surprised
unawares; knowing this, that there is no sitting, without a powerful Army to
guard them; whereof they are not a little conscious, as appears by drawing up
the major part of the Army, into Quarters, at a near distance about the City.

Sixthly, as they have innumerable causes of fear from others, they will find
little ground of security even among themselves: For, if we consider the
constitution of the Army, in the several parts of it, it appears to be an
aggregate of differing interests, opinions, and persuasions; among whom the
Grandees have the less numerous party, being over-ballanced by the Levellers,
and others of the inferior Officers and private Soldiers, whom we may reckon
as men of fortune, who continue in the Army, not out of any devotion or
affection to the Cause, but only for subsistence, and therefore being rather
affectionated to his Majesty, will be ready (as they receive opportunity) to
show themselves in his service. And as for the Levellers, though all the
industry in the world be used, to pacify them from the remembrance of former
injuries, and draw them in to a conjunction with the Grandees, against the
King, and the Scots; yet it is probable they will never sell their blood and
fellow subjects at so vile a rate, as to purchase a sure dominion for such
tyrannical Masters; who, when they have helped them to do the work, will be
ready (as they did before) to crush them, and pay them their wages, with
perpetual slavery.

Seventhly, their Party is very inconsiderable at Westminster, the House being
no longer theirs, than whilst they overawe it by force, as themselves well
know: so that if it happen, the Scots come in, the Presbyterian party being
once backed with an Army, will soon out-vote them. And then the time will come
on, wherein they shall be called to an account for all their forcible attempts
upon the Houses and the city; and those Members that went and joined with them
therein, be brought upon the stage for breach of trust, and have the shame of
High Treason retorted upon themselves, and their August-Ingagement.

Eighthly, by a timely agreement, they may settle an Interest with his Majesty,
to make themselves certainly great; forasmuch as it is possible both their
Interests may stand together (with discretion) entire, by the restitution of
Bishops, and upon assurance given for liberty of conscience, within sober
limits.

Lastly, his Majesty is the very basis of peace, and the balancing power to all
Parties in this Kingdom, and without him no settlement can be expected; and
with whatsoever side he joins, that will assuredly prevail. To manifest the
truth thereof, let it be remembered of what concernment his compliance was to
the Independents, in subduing their opposite Faction both in the Houses and the
city, while he resided among them in the Army. And as by this means, at that
time, they advanced themselves to the height of fortune; so now that they are,
in the eyes of all the world, in a declining condition, they may (if they
please) give a check to the triumph of their Presbyterian adversaries, by
applying themselves more cordially and sincerely to the same way of compliance
with his Majesty. This will be a means to oblige him, and his Party so far that
all injuries being buried in oblivion, the people gladded by the return of a
long desired peace, the old enmity and malice will be soon abated, and the
Royal Party and themselves strengthened in one, by an addition of the whole
Body of the Nobility, Gentry and Commonalty, against all Presbyterian
encroachments, either within, or without the Kingdom.

From all which we may sum up this conclusion; that as his Majesty is obliged
in point of interest to wave all Presbyteriall Engagements, and endeavor an
agreement with the Independent: so likewise it appears, that the true interest
of the Independent Party is, with all speed to recall those prodigious Votes of
Non-Addresse, and apply themselves unto his Majesty, with such moderate
desires, that may stand as well with his honor, as their safety, and be a means
to remove all jealousy and distaste betwixt him and them; and upon just and
necessary grounds lay a sure foundation for a lasting peace.

III. Reasons drawn from the Interest of the Presbyterian Party in England.
WHence it was, and for what ends, the design of Presbytery was first brought
into this Nation, Time the mother of Truth has at length fully manifested:
for, as the pretenses of it were high and glorious, so the issue has been
fallacious and dishonorable, and to it we must ascribe the original cause and
continuance of all our miseries.

That it arrived to such a hight in the opinions of many, as to be cried up for
the only pattern of Government under the Gospel, must be imputed to the blind
zeal of some, and the deceitfulness of others, rather then the intention of
its founder, Master Calvin: For it does not appear that he ever stretched his
model so far, as the necessity and universality of a divine right; but seems
only to have hewn part of the building out of the rock of the Scriptures,
according to the literal signification, and pieced up the residue by politic
and prudentiall rules, such as he conceived might sound nearest the Text, and
serve most conveniently to cement the disjoynted members of that broken and
tumultuous Commonwealth of Geneva, into an entire and well compacted body.

It was no sooner lick't into form there, but (as it is the fate of all things
new) it began to be much extolled and admired, and the fame thereof spreading it
self in England (as well as in other parts) wrought in many of our Countrymen
an itching desire to go thither, and observe the manners and customs of the
Government; where, of Spectators they soon became Proselites, and returning
home with new affections and opinions, had an evil eye upon the ancient
Apostolical government of Episcopacy, which they prosecuted with invective
Libels from the Press and Pulpit, as Antichristian; in the mean time extolling
their new Diana, in hope to bring better advantage thereby unto themselves,
then they could hope to attain under the government of Bishops: and in process
of time, their Doctrines being brought into reputation by the addition of an
artificial and counterfeit piety, they stole away the hearts of many
well-meaning people throughout the Kingdom, whom they poisoned with
disaffection to the present Government. So here was the rise of the old
Presbyters, which passed heretofore under the names of Non conformists, or
Puritans.

Manifold were the Bickerings which they had with the Bishops during the reigns
of Queen Elizabeth and King James; yet the Faction was then kept under hatches
by great care and policy, as it was likewise all the former part of the reign
of our gracious Sovereign CHARLES, though the humors began to work more
strongly then ever; insomuch, that having gained a party in every Parliament;
which presumed to insist upon very high particulars of Government both in
Church and State, and question such Officers of both as stood in the way of
their design, his Majesty was necessitated, by reason of those audacious and
factious proceedings, to a frequent dissolution of Parliaments; which though
they publicly exclaimed against, yet inwardly they were glad enough of it,
working advantage thereby, to scandalize his Majesty, in the opinion of the
people, as one utterly disaffected to Parliaments, and that intended to govern
altogether by an arbitrary power.

This and other Scandals were treasured up against the time, wherein they hoped
to have occasion to use them; but having often tried their own single strength
to be too weak to shake the Government, then the Grandees of the (...), not
knowing otherwise to repair their broken fortunes, began to have recourse unto
the Scots, a people as needy as themselves, and who (it was presumed) would be
glad to entertain any occasion to mend their Fortunes, and establish an
Interest in this Nation: Besides, their hope was the greater to thrive among
the Scots, because they were a people that had been discountenanced and
discontented by the Bishops, and had embraced the same form of Government that
was aimed at by themselves, and therefore could not but be willing to
contribute their best assistance toward the settlement of it in England.

Therefore the motion was no sooner made from hence, but it found joyful
entertainment in Scotland, and Counsels were mutually imparted by the grand
Presbyters on both sides; and in fine it was agreed, that Reformation should be
the stalking-horse to the whole Design. The aim of the Scots therein, was the
gaining of Treasure, and an union of interest with England: The aim of the
English Presbyters, was the quelling of their Oppsites at Court, and
supplanting them in their Offices, the destruction of Episcopacy, and with it,
of Monarchy; and the enriching of themselves with the Wealth of the Kingdom,
the Revenues of the Crown, and the Goods of the Church; all which become a prey
unto that monster of Presbytery, till it was wrested out of their jaws, by the
new brethren of the Independent party.

By which brief draught of Discourse it appears, that as a great part of the
Commons of England have been drawn in upon religious pretenses to the faction
of Presbytery, to serve worldly ends; so now that the hypocrisy and
dissimulation of those proceedings is manifest unto the world, without doubt
the true interest of all honest-meaning Presbyters in England is the very same
with that of the Nation in general, to seek peace and ensue it, to quit all
considerations of siding or faction, to open their eyes and see how they have
been deceived, to loath the vanity, and prevent the misery of all engagements
in and for Presbytery; to endeavor simply the restoring of his Majesty, and to
join with any for that end, but with none that are contrary; and also to
content themselves with a regulated Episcopacy, for these following Reasons.

First, seeing it is most true, that there can be no settlement in this
Kingdom, but by a compliance with the royal interest, it is altogether
impossible to expect peace, if a design be still cherished for the establishing
Presbytery because of that absolute antipathy (or incompossibility) betwixt
Monarchical and Presbyteriall Government, as I have manifested before: God and
Belial, light and darkness may as soon agree together; and therefore it must
not be expected, that his Majesty should yield up his Honor, Conscience and
Crown, in sacrifice to so pernicious a rival in his Prerogative.

Secondly, if there be a fresh engaging for Presbytery to crush Independency,
what more hope of peace have we when this prevailing party shall be down, and
the other up again? are we not where we were before? shall not his Majesty
remain as liable as ever to the old vexatious Popositions? and have not the
Presbyters of the Kirk told us plainly beforehand, that they are resolved, he
shall sign all their desires before his resolution to the exercise of his
Regal power? what then may we expect from Presbytery, after all the miseries
and desolations of a second War, but that his Majesty shall remain in durance,
as he did at Holdenby, or does now in the Island, without all hope of remedy to
himself, or end of those intolerable oppressions lying upon this afflicted
Kingdom?

Thirdly, it being clear, that the design of a Presbytery has been carried on
merely for the private ends of particular men, what madness is it for men that
pretend wisdom, Religion and godliness, to hazard themselves and their
Estates, to draw on the guilt of innocent blood by embroyling their fellow
subjects, and infringe their Obligations to their Sovereign, by prostituting
their consciences, purses and endeavors, to serve the ambition of a few, whose
practices (when they are invested with power) will be (as they ever have been)
to make them share with others in the common calamity at present, and intaile
slavery upon their Posterity for ever?

Fourthly, Presbytery wheresoever it settles, is destructive of liberty, by
reason of that popish trick taken up by the Presbyterian, in drawing all
secular affairs within the compass of their spiritual jurisdiction: and this
they do by means of that awe wherein they hold the consciences of the
Magistrate and People; the one being liable as well as the other, by
excommunications and suspensions, to be exploded as scandalous sinners, when
they please to pronounce them such; as appears by that large extent of their
Authority in judging of scandalous sins, which reaches almost to every action
of humane life: so that all the rest of the Kingdom, besides their favorites
(from the King to the Beggar) must stoop like asses, to be ridden by a few
ambitious Priests, and Lay-ignoramuses.

Fifthly, a regulated Episcopacy must be the only government for this Nation,
in regard it is most suitable to the constitution of the Monarchy, and the
Laws of the Land (whereto through continuance of time it has a very near
relation) and also to the humors and good liking of the people, insomuch that
the Brethren of the contrary way after all their art, industry and persuasion,
have found by experience, that it is impossible to force any other upon them;
therefore without all controversy, a Bishop mortified and pruned of his
superfluities, moderated in the jurisdiction of his Court, and the compulsive
power, and assisted by the Clergy of his Diocese, will in the end appear to be
the most excellent Governor.

Sixthly, if any Presbyter object, that he has sworn to the extirpation of
Bishops, he may do well to consider the unlawfulness of such an Oath, it
having never been enjoined by any lawful authority, but expressly without it,
and against it; and moreover, to the destruction of that which is lawful, viz.
the government of the Church, confirmed by the Laws of the Land; which appears
also by the undoubted testimony of ancient Records and later Histories, to have
been continued with an universell, uninterrupted, unquestioned succession in
all the Churches of God, and in all Kingdoms that have been called Christian
throughout the whole world, for fifteen hundred years together, without any
considerable opposition made against it; and which, if it be not of divine
right, has a fairer pretension, and may lay a juster title and claim to a
divine institution, then any other form of Government can do: and therefore it
having been worthily of such esteem in all Times and Places, and established by
Law, certainly an Oath binding to extirpate it without Law and against Law, is
utterly unlawful, and so rather to be repented of, then stubbornly maintained.

Seventhly, by standing out for a Presbytery, they give the more hopes and
encouragement to the Independent party, to persist in a way of obstinacy
against his Majesty, and oppression of the Subject; because it will be a means
to hinder a cordial joint engaging betwixt the Presbyters and the Royal
party, and inflame the old enmity, to the destruction of each other, whilst
Independents gather strength and opportunity to triumph in the ruins of their
division; whereas by a speedy compliance with his Majesty's interest, they may
quell the pride of Independency, and either fetch them down to a composition
with his Majesty; or in case they continue perverse, be surely enabled to
expel them out of the Kingdom.

Lastly, by a sincere, absolute close with his Majesty upon rational grounds,
they do no more then what the prevailing party among their Brethren the Scots,
pretend to engage for (and truly, if their intents be otherwise, they will
find but cold entertainment in England;) therefore if the Presbyters of
England would but acquit themselves like reasonable men, the work of restoring
his Majesty might be done without the Scots, and all those miseries and
inconveniences be avoided, which must certainly follow the admission of a
foreign Army; which, besides the pressures that they must bring upon the
exhausted Northen parts, will expect a large retribution of Treasure for a
reward of their engaging, and (perhaps) not depart in quiet, but upon such
Terms, as may be exceedingly prejudicial and dishonorable to the English
Nation.

From hence I once again infer, the true interest of the Presbyters, is to
counter-work the Independents in their interest, which they now drive against
his Majesty; and to this end, to quicken themselves to a joint engaging with
the royal party, as the only means to beat down the ambition of the ruling
Grandees of the Independent party, to prevent the miseries of a
long-languishing War, with the in conveniences of a Scottish incursion; and
also to procure the speedy settlement of the King in his just Rights, and the
Kingdoms in firm peace and tranquillity.

IIII. Reasons drawn from the interest of the City of London.
This great and populous City is the epitome of the Kingdom, whereof as it is a
member, it has the same common interest with the whole; yet being more
excellent then any other part, by reason of the dependence of the rest upon it,
as being the principal Fountain of Traffic; and also by reason of its
abundance of Wealth, the grand Privileges of their Charter, and the multitude
of their Revenues and Inhabitants, they have much the greater share in the
common interest of the Nation; which is, Peace and Prosperity.

The special interest of this City is a free trade, as well within, as without
the Kingdom: The only enemy thereto is a civil war, which destroys
commerce betwixt man and man; whereof the Citizens have had sad experience
these tumultuous times by the decay of Trading, the like has not been many
hundred years. So that the only way to recover again, is to endeavor after a
happy Peace; and seeing there is no possibility of attaining it, but by an
establishment of his Majesty, I shall present them with a few Considerations.

First, they may do well to remember, how they were cheated heretofore with
religious pretenses into an Engagement against his Majesty, and how that the
whole Kingdom must owe its ruin and desolation to their warlike preparations
and Contributions. Therefore as it has been their unhappiness to have the
first hand in driving away the King, and un-setling the Kingdom; so let them
account it their honor, to be active and industrious in bringing him back
again, and to settle him in peace on the throne of the Kingdom.

Secondly, in effecting this, they ought to have respect only to the Royal
Interest, without the mixture of any factious engaging whatsoever, under
pretense of Covenant, etc. lest while they seem to act in the behalf of his
Majesty, they unawares drive on the design again of some particular Faction,
instead of the Public Good, and so leave open a Gap still to Division.

Thirdly, in case that the Scots come into this Kingdom again, the Citizens
ought to see very narrowly to the Principles of their ingageing, ere they
condescend to supply, or countenance them, secretly or openly. If they come in
with the old cheat of Reformation, Covenant and Presbytery, it will be the
wisdom of the City to consider, that this will be but a new Onset to the
first design of Scottish incroaching upon English Interest, and the maintaining
of a Faction to serve the ends of Scotland, and the ambition of a few Scotified
English, whose Aims have been and are, to share Dominion with the Scots, to
the dishonor and prejudice of the Nation, and the ruin of Monarchy, the
alteration of Church Government (how speciously soever set forth) being but a
business subordinate to the private ends of particular Grandees among the
Laity and obscure Rabbis of the Clergy.

Fourthly, they may be pleased to observe, that the Game played hitherto betwixt
the two Factions of Presbytery and Independency, has been only which of them
should be our Riders; and its to be supposed now that all the struggling of the
Presbyterians against the present ruling Grandees, is not by dismounting of
them to free us, but only to get themselves again into the Saddle, that they
may domineer over King and Kingdom, and then what comfort will the City or
others reap by all their pains and expenses? Therefore it concerns the
Citizens to look well before they leap, and not to be deluded any longer with
the stale pretenses of a glorious Reformation; the end whereof is nothing else
but oppression and confusion both of King and People.

Fifthly, the Citizens may do well to consider, what little benefit they are
like to gain unto themselves, in lieu of all that mischief that they will
bring upon King and Kingdom, if the Presbyterian Faction shall prevail
again. It may be it will somewhat tickle them for a time, to be revenged on
the Independent party; and it is like they shall have their Members out of the
Tower, and be put into the repossession of that and their Militia, so long as
they employ all to the behoof and benefit of the Faction. But if the
Presbyter-Citizens shall after a little time, upon the discovery of the
Inconveniences brought upon the whole Kingdom, by the standing out against his
Majesty, in point of Presbytery, begin once to grow discontented and weary of
their new Masters, they may surely expect to be served the same measure that is
now meted unto them by the Rulers of Independency; it being a Rule with all
Usurpers, no longer to countenance any that they have drawn into their Party,
then they are willing to run on with them in Design; but if once they begin to
flag, to bury all their former merits in oblivion; also to reckon them as
enemies, and use them accordingly.

Sixthly, if they shall discover themselves so far, as to engage again for
Presbytery, let the Design be attended with never so many pretenses of loyalty
toward the King and his Posterity, yet it being clear notwithstanding, that
such an Engagement would be destructive to the Royal Interest, his Majesty and
the Royal party can look upon them no otherwise, then as absolutely
disloyal, and resolved to continue their Rebellious courses. And then if it
shall so happen (as probably it may) that there be a Compliance betwixt the
Royal and Independent Party, the Door will be in a manner bolted against any
accommodation betwixt them and his Majesty; and then by the union of those two
Powers before named, the Pillars of their Faction (both Scottish and English)
being sh^ken, and driven out of the KINGDOM, They will remain wholly at his
MAJESTY'S mercy, touching the forfeiture of their Charter and Privileges, etc.
and give him opportunity to bethink himself of such ways and means to quell
their Pride, and such means as may secure himself and his Successors from the
rage of all turbulent and seditious humors in time to come.

Seventhly, the Citizens ought to bestir themselves with such alacrity, and
give such testimonies of their loyalty, as may serve to abate the career of our
Independent Grandees, who will otherwise never be brought down to a compliance
with his Majesty: and to this end, it will be their wisdom to pretend high
toward an engaging any way, rather then endure them at this pass any longer;
but still notwithstanding to reserve within themselves a cordial tender
respect to the true interest of his Majesty: Moreover, if the case shall so
stand, that an agreement be concluded betwixt his Majesty and the Independents
(which certainly will be happiest for this Nation, if it can possibly be
effected) then the Citizens ought not to let their spleens boil with the
remembrance injuries received from this Faction; nor flatter themselves with
imaginary benefits, which they suppose they might enjoy by advancing the other
but lay aside all emulation and respect of faction on the one side or the
other, and be ready to applaud any course, which his Majesty shall judge most
convenient for the composing of these unhappy differences.

Lastly, since the restoring and selling of his Majesty is the only way of
true peace, then in case the Independents should continue obstinate (to the
last) against any agreement, it concerns all the honest and wise men of London,
to be wary upon what terms they admit of a Scottish engagement, and not to be
drawn in as they were formerly; but rather to observe the motions and
directions of the royal party, and conform themselves wholly that way, as
being the safest, honestest and most honorable, because free from faction and
by-ends, and which has for its sole end, the restitution of his Majesty and
his royal Posterity, the preservation of the Church, and the establishment of
true Religion, Peace and Liberty throughout his Majestes Realms and Dominions.

V. Reasons drawn from the Interest of Scotland.
The People of England being fully satisfied, that the design for alteration of
Church Government, under pretense of Reformation, was first set on foot by the
English and Scottish Grandees, merely for ambitious, worldly ends and respects;
and the Scots having had sufficient experience of the stoutnesse of our English
stomachs, that they will by no means digest the Presbyteriall government, and
since it is looked on by all knowing men, as absolutely inconsistent with, and
destructive of Monarchy, without doubt it concerns the Scots to bethink
themselves of some other way whereby to settle an Interest and Inter-course with
this Nation, than by introducing a Presbytery, where it is so extremely
distasted, by the generality of the People.

That there is no way for the Scots to settle a beneficial and lasting
Interest here, but by an absolute and sincere Close with the Royal Interest, I
shall manifest by several Reasons:

First, if they come in, and declare (in a mixed manner) for the King and the
Covenant, they give the world to understand, that they come but to Act the old
Cheat over again, seeing the Covenant (though there be words in it mentioning
the Honor and happiness of the King and his Posterity) would prove (in
effect) the destruction of both: For if it works not an absolute change of
Government in the State, as well as the Church; yet it is clear, that it will
regulate it into a posture far beneath the dignity and condition of a
Monarchy. Therefore upon such Terms, they will lose that assistance, which
otherwise they might have from the Royal Party in England.

Secondly, by so declaring, they will draw the Curtain now placed betwixt them
and us, and give a perfect discovery of their Intentions; and we shall
conclude, that their aim is no wise at the good of his Majesty, but only to
serve their own corrupt Interests. And we shall believe they bring in an Army
for no other end, but to back their Party of Presbytery in the House and the
City, so to crush the opposite Faction of Independencie, and then by removing
the King to one of his Houses, reduce him and the Affairs of the Kingdom in
Statu quo prius, as when he was at Holdenby; where he shall languish in the
condition of a Prisoner, as long as he lives, or (at least) as long as they
reign; it being resolved on before hand, that he shall not be restored to the
exercise of regal Power, till he have signed their Desires, and Propositions;
which his Majesty has so often declared to be against his Honor and
Conscience. And then what may the Presbyters expect, but that the enraged
People, having been so often deluded, and tired in expectation of a Settlement,
will take the first opportunity to rise all as one Man, to banish them and
their Faction out of England, and upon their ruins restore both Prince and
People, to their former Liberty?

Thirdly, it seems not to be the Resolution of the Covenant-Abettors only in
Scotland, but it is declared by that Party which pretends highest for his
Majesty in Scotland, and delivered in by them, in their Answer to the Desires
of the Kirk; That they resolve ^o^ to put into his Majesty's hands, or any
other, such power, whereby the Ends of the Covenant may be obstructed; but that
his Majesty shall before any Engagement, give assurance under Hand and Seal,
for himself and Successors, to agree to certain Acts, injoyning the Covenant,
Presbbyterian Government, etc. and never to endeavor the change thereof. Which
resolution of theirs gives us cause to suspect; that all the Bickerings
heretofore between them and the Kirk, were but mere ventilations, acted on
purpose to make the world believe some high Design on foot there in the
behalf of his Majesty, and to feed the Royal Party with hopes of great
matters from Scotland, that being held in suspense, they might remain the
less active, and give the Scots a more plausible and easy Ingresse into
England.

Fourthly, such a Resolution (if it once come to a public Declaration) will
make men apt to believe, that under his Majesty's name, those royal Pretenders
do Act some particular Interests likewise, rather then that of his Majesty
and the Public. And further, seeing Hamilton is the Chief among them, it
cannot be judged very improbable that He (who is a convicted Person, for
aspiring to the Crown of Scotland, and who was so bold in the days of his
Majesty's prosperity, as to attempt it, and to that end (the better to compass
his Design) had a hand in widening the distance betwixt his Majesty and the
two Houses, and also in imbroyling the two Kingdoms) should take opportunity
now in his Majesty's lowest condition, and the present Division, to weave in
his own ambitious Interest, in hope to bring his Affairs unto perfection. I
cannot accuse him; but if the Priestly Faction and his, do close with each
other upon Covenant considerations, it is a shrewd suspicion: The agreement
betwixt them (in plain Terms) is this; That if HAMILTON serve the
Presbyterian Design in England, the Presbyters of both Kingdoms shall (in
requital) connive at his doings, or assist him in his design upon the Crown
of Scotland; and so his Majesty shall become a Sacrifice to the Covetousness
and Pride of his malicious Adversaries.

Fifthly, by an immediate and absolute Engagement for his Majesty, such
jealousies as these will be quite taken away, and the hearts of the English so
inclined and obliged to the Scots, that they will hezard both Lives and Estates
in their assistance, and be willing by way of re-tribution, not only to
dis-burse toward the satisfaction of their Arreares, but yield also, that his
Majesty shall gratify them with such other Rewards and special Indulgences
of Grace and Favor in this Kingdom, as may tend highly to the Honor and
Advantage of their Nation, even far beyond what they may gain by advancing
their Presbyterian Interest; seeing it will be a long time ere the Kingdom can
that way be stated, by reason of the contrary working humors, which will be
ready to break out ever and anon into new Insurrections; whereby the faction
will be so continually busied at an excessive charge, and the People so
impoverished, that they will not be more unwilling then unable to raise such
vast sums, as are necessary for their satisfaction; at most, not the tithe of
that proportion which they may receive suddenly from the hands of the King, and
with the love of the Kingdom.

Sixthly, let not the Scots flatter themselves with a conceit of seeling their
Presbytery amongst us, whether we will or no; for though they may do much by
the strength of their faction, yet both English and Scots of that gang may
consider, that the English are a valiant and generous people, impatient of the
yoke; and though they may be beaten down for a time, yet if the Kingdom were
divided into twenty parts, seeing (I am confident) at least nineteen of them
are against Presbytery, it cannot be in reason imagined, that a few voting
Punies, relying merely upon Scottish Arms, should be able to trample down the
spirits of this our magnanimous Nation for ever; but rather, that when they
have smarted again under Presbyterian-tyranny for a time, they may recollect
themselves with so much courage and success, as will enable them to drive away
the Scots and their faction, and confine the last seen of war within the
limits of Scotland, where it had its Original.

Seventhly, though they may rely much upon a Party in the City, yet the
Citizens eyes being well opened, to see that they have been made but
stalking-horses to other men's private ends, and been gul'd out of so many
millions, only to purchase slavery unto themselves, dishonor unto their City,
and destruction to their Trades, (which cannot be recovered again but by a
settled peace) the Scots may guess how little countenance or assistance they
are like to obtain at their hands, except they so declare for his Majesty, as
that they may receive assurance of his speedy restitution; without which, they
are generally convinced, there can be no hope of Peace unto the Nation.

Lastly, if it should so happen, that the Scots play false with his Majesty,
and drive both him and the Independent party to extremity, it is probable they
may unite upon reasonable considerations, and mutual compliance betwixt both
their interests: and then that Party being fortified by an addition of the
Royal, which (wheresoever it fides) brings in the affections of the whole
Kingdom, it is very possible, the Scots may not only be defeated in the hopes
of that large Dominion, and those golden mountains which they promised unto
themselves here, by an establishment of Presbytery; but also be forced to pack
home again, without so much as one superstitious cross, to requite them for
the pains they have taken in the work of Reformation; and (perhaps) draw
revenge upon themselves, for all those affronts and injuries done unto his
Majesty and the people of England, and renew the old antipathy with perpetual
enmity betwixt the Nations.

From all which, give me leave to sum up this Conclusion in a word, that the
Scots have no way to restore an Interest again in this Nation, but by waving
the corrupt interest of Presbytery, and engaging absolutely for the Royal
Interest of his Majesty, as the only means conducing to the weal and benefit
of both Kingdoms.

Nemo desperet meliorum lapsis.
Miscet haec illis, prohibetque Clotho
Stare fortunam. --
