To the High Court of Parliament of England, Scotland, and Ireland:
The humble Petition of Richard Ford, Nathaniel Manton, and Thomas Papillon, of
London, Merchants.
SHOWS,
THat your Petitioners taking notice that the fishing Ships lately returned
from Greenland, had taken only two Whales, whose Oil and Finnes are but a
drop to that Ocean which the necessary occasions of this Commonwealth require:
Your Petioners presumed that this Honorable House, would for this season
suspend that Law which prohibites the Importation of those Commodities from
Foreign parts; and in confidence thereof did presently cause to be bought in
Holland, a very large quantity of Oil and Finnes, earnestly awaiting the
Resolution of this Honorable House thereupon: And in the mean time having an
offer made them by one Thomas May, Agent for Major John Harris, of a certain
License, which they both pretended the said Harris had obtained from his
Highness, the Lord Protector and his Honorable Council, for the free
Importing of 1500 Tunns of Whale Oil and Whale Finnes by him or his Assigns,
they did pay unto the said Harris 900l. upon the exhibiting and assignment of
the said License before the Commissioners of the Customs: And did thereupon
give order to their Factors in Holland; presently to lade for this Port of
London 200 Tunns of Oil, and 100 Tunns of Whale Finnes, and for the Port of
Hull one other hundred Tunns of Whale Oil, in confidence that they should
enjoy the benefit of the said License.

But your Petitioners have since understood and are satisfied, that the said
pretended License was never signed by his Highness, but forged by the said
Harris and his accomplices; and the said Harris notwithstanding his Highness
order to apprehend him, being fled and escaped with the said money, your
Petitioners are in apparent danger, not only to lose the said 900l. which they
have paid, but also to their utter ruin to incur the penalty of the Law
upon all that very considerable quantity of Oil, and Whale Finnes aforesaid,
when they shall arrive, of which they are in daily, expectation, and therefore
do humbly pray, in regard that they cannot seasonably countermand their orders,

That it may please this Honorable House, to take their sad condition so far
into your gracious consideration, as to afford them such relief and protection
for their said goods against the rigor of the Law, as to your wisdoms shall
be found most agreeable to equity, and the pressing exigencie of their case,
that they and theirs may not at once be ruined in their innocence, by the
wretched circumvention of so notorious an Impostor.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc.
