The Forlorn Lover: DECLARING HOW A Lass gave her Lover three slipps for a
Teaster,
And married another a Week before Easter.

To a pleasant new Tune.


A Week before Easter,
the days long and clear,
So bright is the Sun,
and so cold is the Air,
I went into the Forest
some Flowers to find there:
And the Forest would yield me no Posies.
The Wheat and the Rye,
that grows so green,
The Hedges and Trees
in their several coats.
Small Birds do sing
in their changeable Nots,
But there grows no Srawberies or Roses.
I went into the Meadow,
some time for to spend,
And to come back again,
I did fully intend;
But as I came back,
I met with a Friend,
And 'twas love was the cause of my mourning.
I loved a fair Lady,
this many a long day.
And now to requite me,
she is married away,
Here she has left me,
in sorrow to stay,
But now I begin to consider,
I Loved her deer,
and I loved her well,
I hated all people,
that spoke of her ill,
Many a one told me
what she did say,
But yet I would hardly believe them.
But when I did hear
my Love was in the Church,
I went out of my Seat,
and sat in the Porch.
I found I should falsely
be left in the lurch,
And thought that my heart would have broken.
But when I did see
my Love to Church go,
With all her Bride-Maidens,
they made such a show:
I laughed in conceit,
but my heart was full low,
To see how highly she was regarded
But when I saw my Love,
in the Church stand,
Gold Ring on her finger,
well sealed with a hand,
He had so sedued her
with House and with Land,
That nothing but Death can them sever,
But when her Bride-Maidens
were having her to Bed,
I stepped in amongst them,
and kissed the Bride,
I wished I might have been
laid by her side:
And by that means I got me a favor.
When she was laid in Bed,
(dressed up in white)
My eyes gusht with water,
that drowned my sight
I put off my Hat,
and did bid all good-night^
And adiu my dear sweeting for ever
Oh dig me a Grave,
that is wide, large, and deep,
With a root at my head,
and another at my feet;
There will I lie
and take a long sleep,
I Will bid her farewell for ever.
She plighted her Faith,
to be my fair Bride,
And now at last has
me falsely deprived,
I Will leave off my wrath,
and wish God be my guide,
Do save me from such another.
I pity her case,
much more then my own,
That She should embrace,
and join hands in one.
Whilst I am her True-love,
and daily do groan,
My sorrow I cannot smother.
Though Marriage has bound her,
she is much too blame,
And though he has found her,
her Husband I am;
Hereafter 'twill wound her,
that she put me to shame.
When conscience shall be her accuser.
Two Husbands She has,
by this wild miscarriage,
The one by a contract,
the other by Marriage:
She does her whole Family,
grossly disparage,
But I will not plot, to misuse her.
Beware all Young Men,
of Arts, or of Trades,
Choose warily when
you meet with such Maids,
You Would better live single,
alone in the Shades,
Then to love such an abuser.
