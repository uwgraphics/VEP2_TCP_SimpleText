A FRACTION IN THE ASSEMBLY: OR THE SYNOD IN ARMS Being a punctual Relation
of their set meeting, upon the 25. of April in this present year of our
Computation 1648 at a tavern in LONDON, where the purposes of those reverend
Fathers, were piously discovered by themselves, in a mutual conference by the
strength of a Dinner, and in the truth of wine: Their disagreement, upon the
question: their falling out upon that; and how they were parted: with other
mixtures of sad and merry accidents being all passages very remarkable: and
curious observations, which the Author, as a general well-wisher, delivers
here to the worlds view- And he hopes satisfaction.

London Printed in the year, 1648.

AS once Olympian Jove: put Juno by
And wise Minerva, Gave bold Mars the lie
Touching Troyes fate: when limping Uulcan scorus
To keep heavens peace: and with ungrateful horns
Butts at his freindly Rival: Even such odds
Tainted of late our sublunary Gods
The sacred Synod: which we mortals call
The viols of Heavens wrath: O Troy: thy fall
Phoebus lamented: but in Englands dust
What hand writes pity, as if all were just
For patience has endurd: vengeance convince
These of their guilt and Charles that Godlike Prince
Let his white Truth prevail: our story cooles
Whose Lard seems learning: and her fat rich fools
Fed high with pension dinners: Whose mere close
Would burst an Elephant: well now speak prose,
Friends what you see, believe, here is no lie
For when this chanced, the Authors self was by

PRay be not so angry Gentlemen; For that weighty misfortuns, whose Relations
are to the public, should be known and considered, I deny not, seeing
otherwise, how shall men declare their modest sorrowings in matters nearly
concerning them, or study their prevention, In the future, If they be ignorant
of them: All this without the rack: or hanging by the great toe, with the head
downward like A dancer of the Ropes; or any other inquisition torture, is
confessed freely: but this is it that I say. why should one poor beast, be forced
to carry the burden for a whole Kingdom: because Mrs. such a one: She is a
Widow.
the Mistress of the Tavern where this famous accident befell, with her whole
family, have taken the Covenant, or Oaths of secrecy with these fathers,
Confessors; to hide it from honest men, and so keep the world in this, like
other things in ignorance and infidelity; must I therefore, weep my self into
a Transformation: Be made a new river, as some have been before me, as you may
read in the History of Miobe and others, in Ovids unerring Chronicle of his
Metamorphosis or be turned into a frogge, for over-laughing my self, When J
have a mind to jest out my greifes: And all this because, I only, had the
fortune to be by -- I say, there is no reason for it: no, there are more Asses
in England besides me; let the matter be communicated: that every Lucius
taking up his own load, we may Jogge on like contented Market-Women, or
Citizens wives to their Country houses, fairly, and easily together: to what
use serve Ambages amongst friends, or why should the Author with tedious
Apologies Cuffe his story into tears; because he thrusts her back, and
restraines her appearing, Even now, when by all visible signs, she has A
mighty mind to discover her self, take it therefore amongst you, which in few
words befell thus.

Upon St. Marks day the 25. of April the holiness whereof is much envied by
our Libertines of England, because the superstitious Romans, observe it: half
a dozen of our Synodicall Presbytery, peiced with just as many Independants, to
make up the number, though of several colors, had a mind to condogge together.

Their meeting was at a Tavern in London, not a strecht mile from the Old
Exchange: which to cover the Nakedness of a prime Damsel, the daughter of the
house, and it is thought the loadstone of that society, shall for the present be
namelesse.

After an humble Thanksgiving, for their arrival at terra florida And that
being such, who by sins of an unrecoverable miscreancy, had tempted Heaven and
Earth to destroy them, yet, the stones in the streets, had not risen up against
them, either to break their shins or their Necks in that their pilgrimage,
concluding with an admiration, what providence that should be that still
continued to protect them: Impenitent sinners, they seated themselves at a
large round Table in a very fair Room, and calling for fine Angelica which
shall be her name here, after a brief catachizing touching the state of her
virginity, and how the pulse of her Concupiscences did beat, whereof she was
much comforted to hear them tell her, all flesh was guilty, she received from
them a blessing upon the lip, and they from her fair hand, the cup of
Salutation, which that pretty Leman presenting with wine and sugar, they did
her reason first, and then tossed it of freely one to another.

The joining of two rounds together, engendered a discourse delivered by a
Doctor, in these words following, Brethren, we are here condo^^^d together: As
it were, to peck up a few Crummes of Consolation from this our mutual enjoying
one of another: in the plenty of the Creature, which we presently expect, called
Meat, Wine, and Women: Renowned Subjects of the three first miracles: of
these, we may feed till we burst again, for our purses are full, the people
our friends, And therefore the House is likewise ours, while we, whom the
profane of the Land call evil spirits, shall please to possess it, But
first, let us advise, and unscruple our souls, least any thing by chance,
should lie pinching us in that tender place, to the hurt of our present or
future tranquillities: If any of you doubt, let him only question, And be
resolved.

The motion was applauded, and thus trod upon the very heel by another, then
are we quoth he, the most miserable of all men, if vox populi, carry it is old
credit, for that calls us the Incendiaries of the Nation: It says, that weekly
preaching have advanced Rebellion, Murder, Theft, Confusion, and every evil
work: That we have brought contempt upon the Gospel; That outwardly we
contest as opposits, but secretly are agreed to nourish divisions so long, like
the Scotts, we have gathered all business into our discussing, that we may
Judge and determine all things as chief moderators in matters of conscience,
and so, by degrees, steal the Sovereignty from King and People, and Plant it
in our selves, the Clergy.

That neither we, nor any Authorized by us, or lawful Ministers, because we
have forfited our calling by the double breach of those two Oaths, Allegiance
and Supremacy, which bound us to the King: who when he has vanquished his
toiles, will, they say, have us baited in Beares-skins, for playing to much the
Foxes, as first to Drill him into a snare; And then set Dogs to worry him; not
those of a Generous kind, but mangy Mungrell Currs, called Mildmay, Martin,
Haman, and our selves, to whom they say, the Rogue last named is only Turn-key;
but we his Jailours, that may free him instantly, if we would but sweeten the
polluted Air with pure Divinity. And from wounded hearts in penitential
Pulpits, Ingeminate to Heaven, and men, our hearty sorrowings for the high
Crime, of our Sovereign Lords unjust and violent Captivity, first caused by
us, and now contrived by our connivences; in fine that all our fasting Prayers,
are abominations, because our hands, they say are full of blood, neither can
they hear our preaching, if they would, the Keys of -- keep such a noise and
rattling at our Girdles, all which render us worse then Baals Priests, or the
600. false Prophets that prophesied lies, and persecuted the good men of God.
These Imputations that bold Vox Populi that presumes to call Infinite thousands
of Men, The Chair man's Answer is all their Resolutions.
Women, and Children, nay, our own Consciences forsooth, for Witnesses; he
swears are no slanders, but bleeding truths, which so wounds my thoughts, and
consumes me in this very minute, that if your Sack here were not perfect
Charinco, and the smell of our approaching Dinner restorative. I should verily
faint, and drop out of this Land of the living, and your Good Companies which
would much greiue me; to grope out uncertain chances in another world, where
it is ten to one, they serve not God after our manner; so, he sipt off his Cup:
was pledgd round, and thus satisfied by the Chaire-man.

Brother: we must suit the behavior of our Actions to the disposition, or
humor of their causes, which command ours at this time, to observe the posture
they now stand at: The people indeed exclaim, I say their cries are just, for
by us, a Cloud is brought upon their Laws, Liberties, Estates, nay persons and
all this by preaching, yet if this present momentary ill, conduces to their
future good eternally: who should these beetles thank, but us; Bitches have
clogs: which we take off, to make them happy, if the silly Irrational Cattle
could but understand it, however, we, that know it necessary are bound to
practice it, for all their goods.

This Generation must suffer, for the sins of those past, and all that are to
Come: The next by our endeavors, shall shine again, with a Government so pure,
and like heaven, that Angels shall seem to be beguild, and love to live, at
least converse with men as formerly, mistake me not, I mean with us here in
England: As for the Scotts, lately our Brethren, they are revolting poor
Rogues, not worthy now, nor ever able to entertain such Guests: Let not these
Nitts disquiet you Mr. -- to make you throw of the Dublet of your first
resolutions, If a rampant lowse, or two, chance to trouble you, yet never
unbutton for the matter, only tell me where they bite, i will help you to a
remover strait: come heers the Man, he was thanked, pledgd, and should have
been encountered with a reply, but as the word was sallying out of the
Respondents Lips: it was forced to recoile by a whole file of Dishes, which just
then presented upon them, The falling on was furious; they came suddenly to
pell mell, And slasht it without mercy.

You will ask paradventure, how I came to know all this; I Will tell you: A
friend and I had agreed over night to meet at that very Tavern about 10 this
morning, I kept my appointment, but my friend, as the fashion is, failed me. I
with a pint of the purest before me, sell a sleep, and was, it seems, as well
forgot by the house as my self, till the entrance of so many, and so near me,
with the shuffling of legs and feet, started me in such a fright, as had there
been a chimney in the room, I had certainly appeared at the top in a trice,
and rather crept out that way, to shift for my self, then stood to the mercy
of that Corporal, and his Squadron, for so I strongly fancied these to be,
that came to search for malignants; of which outlawed family, my own a
King-heart told me verily, that I was a forlorn Brother; well, the Divill a
Chimney was there, or a hole bigg enough, for Tom Thumb to have hid himself
in; there was no remedy: I composed my fears the best J could, and settled my
self, to listen their sitting discourse, but especially the sight of them
thorough a clift in the wainscot, which only divided us, for it was in the next
a room, so confirmed me; that I drove care away to kill catts, and sat
prancking it upon my bench, as proudely, as St. George did upon his Beast,
after he had killed the Dragon. Having given you this satisfaction, you are
bound in conscience to read on, and believe every word as follows. We left
them at dinner at the Tables end, sat the fatt Mistress of the House, with a
face appearing like a full Moon; by whom there shined her daughter, the fair
Angelica, whose brightness so stellified the room, that those elders could
do nothing else for a while, but drink, and dart glances, feathered with
wanton language at her, which she retorted like another Venus, till her Tongue
traveled tantivie, and more then a Canterbury pace, and never Stopped till Mr. --
Assaulted the Chaireman, whose place the Mistress had borrowed very freshly with
some fragments of the first question.

That although what he had uttered, was profound and undeniable, yet he was
still to seek in two maine particulars; first of the Church differences which
he ever held real, till then, next touching the King: who being a Just: Good:
Gracious: Mild: Merciful: Magnanimous: Valiant: Pious: Wise Prince: in his
opinion he deserved Nobler usage, and to be at liberty: The Doctor replied it is
true; you have not flattered him in all this Glorious Charecter for, it is his
due; which is Attribute we owe to all: nay, the very Proverb commands it for
the Devil, yet to the King we must deny, this, under the Rose here, weel give
it him, amongst our selves, but not publicly, for know: The government by
Kings, and that we aim at, which is to exalt the Church above it, are
incompatible: If we, submitting to the equity you speak of, which pleads hard
for the King: should replant him, you should quickly perceive, what wild fruits
that foolish Honesty would bring forth: The awful office of Bishops would
certainly flourish again; Then pray what would become of us: marry, I Will tell ye
-- if we escaped hanging, even presently be farted out of the Land, perhaps into
that Jakes of Scotland, like some griping disease among the Gutts, or the wind
Colic of the Kingdom: which they begin already to call Us: No if we wish our
own utility, and the Churches Honor, we must heap Pelion upon Ossa, raise such
a mount of scandals in the Kings way, as may bar his return for ever, as being
too high for all his patience or vindications, to climb over, for example.
There Is Anthony Mildmay, a dear Proselyt of ours. I can never call thee Rogue to
mind, but me thinks, I wish my hands were stroaking his zealous heart, and
chasing it into new designs for us: This precious villain, in a Letter to
that Saint his Brother, some call him Serpent, because he stings the King that
cherisht him: I confess an offense that would damme him, were he not a Son of
the Cause, and we his defenders, charge his Majesty with several expressions
in discourse, which he calls Tyrannies, and Inveighing against him, with the
extremest tartness of a depraved Pen exposes him to a malevolent censure, now
we perceiving how the slave betrayed his Master, by poisoning the Innocence of
his language, and meaning with wrested constructions of his own, which we well
knew were false; Though we Admired the fellows Impudency, yet we cherisht his
Information for the reason aforesaid: and made special uses of it, to our own
eternal advantage, as we Imagine, and the Kings final detriment: This which
we hold far better, then an Act of oblivion or Indemnity, meets your fears of
after questionings, and calls them Trivial.

Touching your second doubt of our pretended Church differences Brethren, that
the condition of state Affairs is sometimes such as forces us, that manage
them, to a deceptio visus, A piece of Hocus, to benight men's Eyes at noone, and
falsify their object for their ruin. We present somethings to the public
view just as they are, others not so, but as they seem to be by our direction:
we are not to sentence any evil desperate, whose remedy is in our selves, one
famous trick of pure conveyance carried it, for we, the Synod first, and then
the Parliament, pretended to divide, we preached, writ, disgraced one another
to the uttermost, which wanted no success, for the silly people, just as we
imagine d, cozened with empty face of anger, ran presently to sides, and
quickly wound the quarrel up to such a height, as to avoid the crushing of a
party when the weight should fall, the continuance of an Army was resolved
upon, and so by their own mis-prisions, counted necessary, which fitted our
desires just: This plot, thus wisely laid, was likewise fortunate, for being
thus seemingly opposite, we can open our pack by turns, now the Presbyterian,
then the Independent, and pass our wares at what price we please upon the
shallow world, which receives all our brocage, [as some disparage it] it the
second hand, paying truly the dear rates of many thanks, and Reverence, not
from any skill of their own to judge, but as we adorn it, with a gloss, and
praise it.

Thus you see, those our Sons of Westminster, Observe the confession.
and London obey our contrivings: Our servants Fairfax, and Cromwell, like Esau
and Nimrod, smell strongly of the field, and savor rank of the blood we command
them to spill in hunting: and lastly, we, the Sages of Europe, and Englands
Reverendissimoes, do keep unity, as well as we can, and concord in a Golden
band, I mean amongst our selves being always careful that neither of our
parties outweigh the other, but both to lie so hard upon the King and his
followers, that we wonder, by what virtue or miracle they live.

This, I have told you, is the very heart of the affair, which these
dotterells of the Laity are not to search into, but you the Sons of Eli, and my
dear Iockey's must dive into the bottom of this or any other secret, wherein
my art can pleasure you.

After this Oration, he watered his dry palate with a shower of White wine, to
which he was very devoutly affected, and liquored his tongue to make it
fruitful for more flowers of Rhetoric: That done, he demanded their opinion
of what he had offered one, whose hands I marked were no unprofitable Servants
to his stomach for in the interim of this long parley they had stored the
Magazine of his belly with a months provision at least, for fear of a famine
from Kent and other Mutinous Counties, entreated the Chaireman to excuse them,
forasmuch as they had not been at leisure to hearken to his Tale, which
notwithstanding, they were confident, was all true from the beginning, to the
end of the last syllable: it being no more possible for him to err, then the
Popes holiness: To whose two Chaires, Infallibility, was equally annexed in
assurance whereof, A black fellow, very like Mr. Marshall, and sure I think
it was he, taking up a weighty Boll, brim-full of Sack, offered to drink to any
man in the Company that would pledge him, and be of his opinion; his challenge
was received immediately by another: what replied a third, that they say,
seldom spoke a true word, but in his Drink, is not this in the Devils name, a
trick of the beast, to tell the people of a Cock and a Bull, and bind them to
believe all the stories in Chawcer for Articles of Faith: pray what is this, but
Implicita fides: the very bumbaste father of Ignorance.

Brother, answered the Chaire-man, That ignorance you despise so much, is, being
rightly conceived, the true and sober parent, not only of devotion toward
Heaven, but of reverence to us: of which last Jewel it behooves us to have a
more tender care, then of the other: Oracles were admired of old, because, dark
and stupendous, let a Riddle be once expounded, and every fool will tread upon
it: I tell you again, they must not be able to fathom our depth, it is
sufficient for them, to practice obedience, and for us, to embrace the example
of our witty forefathers of the last Trent Council, who when they added new,
and strange Articles, all contradiction to those, was death, for a crime called
by them, Haeresy; and now by us Felony, Mark this Confession which is true.
especially about the Ius Divinum, of our Presbyterian Government, never known
till Calvin, by whom to speak Truth, it was first broached, to get the man a
name, and please the humorous palate of the hare braind people.

Oderant si metuunt, Let them hate me so they fear me, was the Motto of a
Tyrant, A Tyrannous Motto, allowd by the Synod.
and yet in my judgment a sentence more Divine, then any of Catoes: we must
compel the vulgar Adoration to us, As the Devil does the Indians, Appear in
mild shapes to those that love us, or submit willingly, but be formidable to
the rest: you see how these Goats desert us daily, and are not their revolts
sufficient to excuse our cruelty, nay though we damned them after death -- O
how I am taken with your grave politics, -- and stand amazed at the profound
mystery of Prophesies: Machiavell cry I, was a sprightly Gentleman, within
Duce Ace, as wise as the Devil, if not wiser: and Mother Shipton, As vast in
her divinations, and as Authentic an Author as any Sybill of them all: he
drank to em, expecting an Applause -- but it would not serve his turn, for
being holyday as I told you, the Wine had kindled Bonefires in their brains,
they valued neither him, nor his Chair, and his language had so offended one,
that he told him plainly he took him for Barabas, The Father of Insurrections,
not half so honest as a Brewers Clark, whose false Tally was always sworn to
Cozen either the Master or his Customers, The Prolocutor, who to my thinking,
raved, hearing this, and fearing worse: called all the Godly of both parties to
side with him, if he were affronted further by that -- ly -- ing Rascal, I
think he would have said, but the lie was returned into his Throat, before he
could get out the rest, and had almost choked him, being rammed down by three
great Teeth of his own, which were driven from their Pallisadoe, by an assault
and battery.

He that gave this blow, I marked to be a man, whose face was so dyed in the
Grain of Claret, that his plump Cheeks lookd for all the World, like a couple
of flowing Wine-bagges, which in a moment were emptied, by a quick response
from the Chaire-man, that with a cast of his Office, hit him so home and
hardily, as drew the Vintage in his face through the Spigot of his Nose, and
laid him flat upon the ground, like a bunch of Grapes new pressed.

This Patroclus had an Ajax, that bestird him, who mowed down the Chaireman at
one swing with a pottle Pot, All hands were excercis'd in a moment, And by a
rare method or keeping due time betwixt feet and fists, No man could take them
for any other then professed dancers, that were notably skillful in observing the
Decorum of A brawle: The fray was silent, sharp, and short, for the house,
chiefly Angelica, came running up, and parted them: They returned to their
seats: smiled, at the Captiousnesse of great spirits, and called for a Gallon of
Nepenthe, a reconciling Drink, which they swallowed liberally, and were
friends: The next Act was voiding the Table of all things, but a fair Cloth, a
miraculous great Pie, plenty of wine to cleanse their mouths, and Tobacco to
foul them again.

Their wits went now a wool-gathering, from Learning the Reverend wagges, would
needs grow wanton with a piece of divination, What quoth one, if these Devils
in Kent and Essex, should get the better of our Saints in the Army, and so
demand the Angels, in our two Houses: And then those spirits of the middle
Region, the Londoners, in whose power I confess it lies to dispatch the
business in few hours, should deliver them up, What would then become of us
all; -- The chaire-man whose custom it was to fall upon the kernel of the
business, for you see, he opened the shells as fast, as any Wesell can crack
nuts, New England
replied instantly, That all would prove indifferently well, for let it rain
Dogs, and Cats, we, said he, will recover our old sanctified plantation, in
despite of them, our sublimer Saints: As Lenthall, Martin, Mildmay, and the
rest shall step aside into their several ports in Neighbor Nations, where
they may unite the forces of Treasure, and craft, of both which they have a
large stock, as occasion shall invite them, to toss new balls and make Engand
wild by the fire of another new War, This would be meritorious you know.

All in Good time, went on the Objector, If we as you say, are able to cry,
noli me tangere, when danger is ready to fasten, yet what will become of the
fry, that have borne up our weak flights, upon the strength, and reach of
their long winged votes, and have all this while sided with us, for these not
being of the cabinet Counsel, will it is like, know nothing of the bogge, till
they best fled in it.

They are good for nothing else, answered the Chaireman, but to be regarded,
like Bills, and Bonds out of date, bundled up together for wast papers, and
reserved only for posterior uses, -- As they have voted with us, from the
beginning without judgment, or against conscience, so let them eene be hanged
for us at last, That's all I care.

Now you speak of that, said another, I am within an Inch of death with
laughing: when I but think of that great Animal Pembrook, a fellow that
appears amongst the Lords in the upper house as the Devil did in Heaven, in a
shuffling way, having indeed, no privilege to be found in any place, where
wit should dwell, -- Lord, what a Legacy of nonsense, that Buffoone, will
bequeath to the jeering Malignants when they are throug'd together to behold
him, as he stands upon his degrees, for he has lately been at Oxford ye know,
to preach his own funeral sermon at some selected Gallows, for it is verily
thought, that party, if they can but finger him, will never honor such a
keckshaw with the solemnity of a Scaffold, This Earl says another, should be
always thrown upon Tumults to pacify them, for let him talk what he list to
displease the people, he is sure, they cannot all knock out his brains, for
these not only he, but all the rest of the Peers, have delivered up to the
single custody of Viscount Say, a crafty Merchant that has sealed them up from
all men's uses, but his own, which makes their Honors sit with empty Noddles,
from whence they say, The higher House is called an Hospital of fools, and in
subjection to the lower who for this very reason are to be their Guardians.

To this point they came; neither did these mountains of discourse want their
valleys, into which I will not trouble your descent, let it suffice us over
looking many inferior passages of the day to walk on still keeping the higher
ground till we arrive at Eleaven at night, which finishes the tragedy, and
dismisses the spectators.

Eleaven was the hour, till which time, though I had not eat a bit, yet I was
not fasting: I confess I fed not, like other men at the mouth, but by the eye,
and ear abundantly my nose too, came in for a share, which thrusting out of
my Casement, snuft up the hot steam of their broth and baKte meat, which
nourisht me exceedingly.

They were now high flown: Bacchus had crowned all their temples with
vermillion: his own colors which are commonly purchased at a drunken rate,
and looking thorough their own eyes, now turned into multiplying Glasses, they
strongly fancied the huge pie before them to be full as big as London within
the walls, this once falling into apprehensions already distemperd: they stepped
into a higher degree of madness, The wonderful power of drink,
for an Independent started up and swore it was London it self, showing the
Arms, which said he, you may behold blazoned here upon one of her gates [he
meant the Lid, where indeed they were Gallantly flourished] and therefore I and
my companions, embracing the opportunity, will now beseige, and take it, for
this we know is the maine design of the Army, and all the well-affected party.

They grew from words to Action, and prepared in earnest, some to destroy,
others to defend it: The battery was feirce, many a sadd blow was discharged
at the Pie that fell heavily upon one face or other, in a word, the Independent
party prevaild, and the Chaire-man their Leader, beating down the walls by
force of Arms, the Cart of his stomach was the first that wheeld in, whereof
himself being Charioteer and Guide, he bore down all before him, and did a
terrible execution with his own hand.

The fortifications being quite leveld, professed friends fell to the plunder,
like Enemies; never did poor Citizens suffer persecution: and devouring with
so much strange patience, not a Groan, nor sigh, it seems remembering their
faults against the King they silently confessed all these punishments just,
well, extremes cannot last allwaies, the Conqueror tired with the labor of
his own cruelty, This was don by the Cook-maid and A Drawer as themselves told
me since, when they perceivd I knew the matter.
was willing to pardon the miserable surviving relics, which beginning to
observe, they found them to be a Cluster of Froggs, well do and seasoned:
The men were amazd, and the Women scrietched like Owls to see the
Metamorphosis, and kneeling down in a cold perplexity, they confessed themselves
to those Ghastly Fathers, in Terms Auricular, that as they never hoped to see
Heaven, it was as sweet a Woodcock pie, as ever kissed the Lips of a modern
Apostle: fear became fury: They gave all Pies they said to the Devil, it was
a City they looked after, whose Inhabitants conquered by them, were first turned
into Frogs, by Art Magic, and now at the best, made but Woodcocks by the
Sorseresses.

Two only of the Twelve persuaded Peace, and in Scripture phrases but could not
be heard, for all spirit of meekness bad forsaken them, yet being conscious in
themselves, that they all had a smackering in Nicromancy, which they studied
more then divinity, they fell into a suspicion, that some one among them, had
done this, to put a trick upon the rest; but the Chaire-man, that snorted like
Bucephalus, Alexanders horse, in whom the fire of the first disdain was
freshly kindled, being before but raked up in a dissembled pacification, would
needs press the business in tempestuous language upon him, that had first
stricken him, who likewise grudging at him with a fervent emulation thus
retorted: that rather he himself was the man, for who knew not him to be
always drawing lines of infernal communication, spending most of his time in
familiar conference with a certain Devil, whose name he had forgot, finally,
he Affirmed him to be one that surmounted Faustus in Magic, and could make
babies of those two learned Friars, A terrible blow.
Bacon, and Bungey. The brazen head had spoke his last, for at this word the
War broke out again; one Cuffe from the Chair upon the others Right Ear,
made his head face quite about to the left shoulder, without hope, ever to see
right forwards again: This mortal chance engaged all the Company, who fell
aboard, and battered one another without mercy: It seemd to rain Cloaks and
Hatts, The maine battle.
while Ruffs, bands, and Cassocks, were dismembered like the Frogs they had
eaten, and flew up and down as if they had been alive.

One there was amongst the rest, that had entertained the Time and Company,
with a long discourse in praise of Reebahs sober Legacy to his Sons, whose very
near Kinsman he proved himself to be, at the distance only of 2019.
Generations, which he assured them was all, and all the reason he knew, why
that language of Hebrew seemd to him more natural then this of his own mother
Tongue: being as he offered to make it appear, descended, ab originali, from
the Jews, and drawing his pedigree in straight line, from Caiphas his Chamber
keeper: Malchas told the wench that made fires in the high Priests Hall, the
very fame, that made Peter deny his Master, He had Records to witness it.
which two he protested were Married together: This Gallant, by way of pure
imitation would drink no Wine, but had so drowned himself in a River of Ale, as
getting into the middle of the room, and staring upon that wild crew, with
Goggle-eyes, he stood there fixed, as if some body had turned him into A Pillar
of Malt, never to be removed, till the furious Chaire-man by the trial of Feet
and Fists, quickly found him to be a dirty Moveable, and kicked him out of the
room.

Another that waited his opportunity, and seemd to pity the Damsel because he
saw her in dismay, led her meekly into a dark Closer in a corner of the room,
where clinging about her like jvy, he recoverd her by the virtue of frication,
reclaimd her Haggard smiles, and made her feelingly merry: her absence was
quickly resented by one, that loved her dearly, who ungrappling from a Vessel
that had boorded him, gave them Chase by the sent, and found that Rabbin
pluming his pullet instead of a Partridge, confounded with Jelousie he bellowd
out a rape, untwined their embraces, and flew upon his Rival like a Cat
A-mountaine, his roaring compelled the rest to take notice of him, and being
all in charity with the Nymph, which I believe was none of Dianaes, they took a
minutes truce, and ran to her rescue, where they discovered their Pigeon all to
be ruffled, and the two enraged Combatants upon the Ground: clawing one another
like a couple of Curry-combes.

I am not able to express the Chair man's fury, whose peculiar darling she
was, his anger groand, and he foamd at the mouth, and grew so insolent that he
invaded friend and foe; at that instant high midnight appeared amongst them an
old man or a little fellow not so tall as himself by the head, for he wanted
one, I would feign have seen his face but could not for the reasons aforesaid,
yet I think it was the Martyr Land, his hands armed with whips; scourged that
Martial Crew into admirable discipline, and it seems, his blows smarted, for
they friskt up and down the room like Morris dancers, The first that fled in
this dreadful vision, was Angelica, who running down stairs fell flat upon
her face, at the bottom of them with her Train, smock and all about her
ears, and exposing a pair of lovely buttocks, to the view, lay So as if she
had been dead by their dispaires, two Doctors followed her at the heels; one
fell upon her right, the other upon her left hanch, which being white, pubble,
and sweet, they kissed them close with their cheek, and fell fast asleep, The
Chaireman himself came last, which flying from his tormentor, tript likewise
upon the Virgin, and ran his nose directly into her Moonshine, Those Heroes
above terribly affrighted and tyrannically lasht, dropped down suddenly into a
Trance, and all was silent. The Mistress had gotten her load and sat below with
eyes fast locked, the Servants had likewise their shares, and presented
themselves the true family of night, upon whom Morpheus had cast the charm of
a leaden slumber.

I, that was not with out my shiverings at this midnight spectacle, and not
delighting in such cruelty grasped the occasion: opened my door softly and
stepped upon the stage, where I saw such wonders acted: It was paved with
cloakes, the candles, which signified that that spirit was not evil never went
out, but gided me to several wines which well brewed with sugar, I powered down
plentifully. I seizd upon a light and saw how Ruffs, Coats, cloaks and beards
lay strowed up and down, as thick as rushes: sacrilege, I rememberd to be a
sin, and therefore touched none of those babilonish garments, least I should
seem to be guilty of it and rob their Church, but glided gently down, and
could hardly bridle my laughter, to see how those Doctors lay like Church
leeches, sucking at the breech of the body politic, and certainly they hit
upon the right vein, especially he in the midst that had the best share by
ods, for she had evacuated as freely in his face, as if he had been newly
giving her a Glister, which made the Grinning Chaireman look like a
Gould-finder when diving into the bottom of his office he comes up again with
his prey in his teeth, Jn a word, leaving these spiritual Fathers consulting
with the flesh I unlocked the street door, shut it again, went speedily to my
lodging, and as suddenly to bed, yet not till I had scribled down a few notes,
as helps to facilitate the next days labor, and because I reputed it an
unpardonable Error to betray the least dram of so deserving a passage to
unthankful forgetfulness.

FINIS.
