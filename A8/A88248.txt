THE RESURRECTION OF John Lilburne, etc.
HAving many and strong compulsions, from the measure of the light of the Lord
now shining clearly within me, and raised up now to a good degree of life and
power in my soul, to make a public declaration in print, of my real owning,
and now living in, (in my present attained to measure) the life and power of
those divine and heavenly principles, professed by those spirituallized people
called Quakers; at my owning of which, all my old and familliar friends (in a
manner) are so much troubled and offended with me for, and my great adversaries
so jealous of the real intentions of my heart within me, at my so doing, and
by that measure of the Light of JESUS shining in my soul, I am now directed and
guided to entitle it as aforesaid, and here at this place (as an introduction,
before I come to the main thing of that which through the strength of God I
have now to say) to insert here the copies of the very two first Letters, that
ever I writ of note, after the great and glorious power of God had seized upon
my soul, to let in the real beginnings of convincement into my soul, of my
spiritual blindness, deadness and emptiness, and by which I came to see a clear
glimps of that spiritual fullness that was, and really is, in the divine and
heavenly declared principles of the aforesaid precious people: The first Letter
being to my wife, take in these following words.

Dover-Castle the fourth day of the tenth month, 1655.
For my deer and loving wife Elizabeth Lilburn, at her friend George Wades
(house) a Cook, at the Sign of the Sun near Guild Hall, and Lawrence Lanes end
in London, these with speed deliver.
My dear heart,
WHat in a great measure my temper of spirit was before thy coming to me, I in
its measure communicated unto thee, by the copy of my letter to Luke Howard,
which I have here enclosed thee at thy leisure to peruse: And what
distemperedness my earthly spirit was in, at, and toward thee, at thy and my
last meeting upon Saturday, the tenth of November last, I need not to repeat
unto thee, being (I believe) it is fresh enough in thy own memory.

And the frame of my heart, after thy reconciliation and mine (so far as God
has given me the spirit of discerning, and searching it) I in no small
proportion in reallity discovered to thee.

And since my departue (upon Wednesday the 21. of November last) se^ting
my-self seriously to a deep and weighty consideration of that work that my soul
longed for a new to be a traveling in; And giving fullness of scope to that
divine and heavenly voice of God speaking plainly in my heart, unto which I am
truly able to set my seal to, that it is that spirit, or power of the Holy
Ghost, or true Comforter, spoken of Joh. 16.7, 8. that convinces, or reproves
the world, or the carnal, or first, or fallen nature in me, of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgment, and is that eternal and everlasting spirit of
truth, that (embraced and closed with) leads my soul by its divine and strong
power, or attractive drawings, step by step in its measure and degree into
truth, and in my heavenly fathers good time, I doubt not but it will establish
and build me up in truth, Ioh. 16.13. and mould me into a real conformity in
life and power (in real and substantial enjoyment) to the ways of truth, of
light, and life, be they never so difficult to the flesh, carnal man, or
fallen, or first nature in me, or never so full of the cross, or self-denial,
or giving up my own reason, understanding, will, wisdom, and affections, to be
crossed and crucified by the Will and Wisdom of JESUS, the anointed above
measure of the Father, and to be guided or led on by him the living life,
light, or power in all the sons of men, that have the greatest degree, or least
of sparks of divine or heavenly light, shining within their dark, (in their
small degree or measure) or enlightened, inlivened souls, in their larger degree
or measure.

I have, since I see thee, read extraordinary much of those two volumes which I
showed thee, containing both almost seventeen hundred pages, of the writings of
those preciouseft (though most contemptible) people called quakers; the truly
beloved objects of my soul. And this at present, (because I rather now heartily
desire to live in the possession, power, or life of truth in my soul, then in
the bare profession, notion, or talk of it) I shall, and can in sincerity say
to thee, that my soul has been amazed, and even confounded by them; not as
Herod by John Baptist preachings was, for fear of eternal wrath (or loss of his
Tetrarch-ship by, or) for his sins, which to avoid made him reform, and amend
many things, Mark 6.20. but of real breakings, or shame of soul, that so
glorious a Talent, as my Lord and Master (by the clear, lively, and powerful
breakings in of his divine and heavenly light into my heart) long, and many
years ago bestowed upon me, should by me (or my first, and carnal wisdom) be
most ungratefully, and unfaithfully, like a lighted candle put under a bushel,
or hid, or buried in the earth in me, in obscurity and darkness: Or, that my
soul should by the will and wisdom of the first nature, ambitiously (
Adam-like) eat anew upon the tree of Knowledge of good and evil, and thereby
covet to be esteemed something amongst the sons of men, (more then the Divine
Wisdom would have me) with that measure or degree I had attained to; and
therewith be with it (like the unbelieving Jews, the type in the flesh) or the
first (or mean in its degree or measure, to what I ought to have thirsted
after) outgoings of the divine and heavenly teaching, and instructing spirit,
or voice of God in, or unto my soul, willing and content to sit down in the
wilderness, or journeying way to Canaan; and not with precious Joshua and Caleb
(the spiritual anti-types in that particular, or in another particular, the
outward types, of the spiritual traveling anti-types, the seed of God under
the Gospel, into Gods spiritual rest in himself) be willing, longing, and
desirous, by faith in the strength of God, (resting as the old Israelites after
the flesh ought to have done, in his faithful and powerful promise of
carrying me on) through all difficulties, self-denyals, crosses, and hardships
whatsoever; to travel into the spiritual Kingdom, or heavenly Land of Rest,
that God in the naked enjoyment of himself has prepared for (and at this very
day I believe has experimentally and really bestowed the clear enjoyment of,
upon many of) his Ransomed ones, contemptibly and scornfully called quakers.

I say unto thee, the real (and close applied home unto my soul by the spirit
and power of life from God, that now aloud again speaks within me)
consideration of the premises, or that which is foregoing, and that people afar
off, ( yea, ignorant idiots, fools and profane As is clearly proved by the
printed speeches of several of the prisoners in Northhampton and Eversham
Goals.
ones) in comparison of my being so nigh at hand so many years ago, to the
clear and full possession of the spiritual Land of Canaan, should enter into
the glorious Kingdom of God, or that clearness of Rest, Peace and Union in, and
with him, that now clearly to my spiritual understanding they iajoy, and there
bring forth the ripe fruits of spiritual old age in comparison of me, of
Praises, Honor, and Glory to the Lamb: and to the ancient of Days, that
clearly sits upon the Throne in their hearts, as having judged down, conquered,
and overcome, within them, all their sins or spiritual enemies, and caused
them to triumph over them, as in his strength, divine and heavenly power,
reigning and ruling as King and Lord over them.

O, I say unto thee again, the real sight (in its measure and degree) and
spiritual consideration of these things, since I last see thee, for diverse
hours in several nights, one after another, when my God denied sleep unto my
outward eyes, and caused my soul to be awake with himself, and to be really
exercised in an interchange of Divine conference, contemplation or parley with
him, has even caused my soul to weep, sigh, and mourn within me before him,
and in his strength and almighty power to indent with him, and now in good
earnest to engage in my soul, or spiritual man, to be obedient to his heavenly
and divine voice, speaking clearly in me, and to follow him (least I should now
by any longer resistance, totally quench his divine drawings) through the
denial of my own (or natural reason) will, wit, wisdom, desires and affections,
and with a real weanedness from worldly or fleshly honor, applause, glory,
riches, or creature-fulness, yea, even to a final denial of father, kindred,
friends, my sweet and dearly beloved (by me) babes, or thy own self, who viz.
thy self, for many years bypast, I must avow it before the Almighty in
sincerity and truth, has been to me the greatest and dearest of all earthly
delights and joys.

And now therefore look about thee in good earnest, and see what thou have got
to thy self, as to the flesh, by thy eager desires, and strong endeavors to
bring me back again into England; for the day of thy real, strong, and full
temptation and trial, never came upon thee till now, if God give thee not by
degrees the fullness and compleatness of spiritual and heavenly strength and
ability to bear it, and go through it. For my part I am now in reallity and
truth, in the clearly, lively, or evident seeing of the wisdom, and loving hand
of a tender and indeared eternal father, in stripping me naked of all earthly
and created excellencies, and taking my outward Estate, and profitable worldly
Employment, and all my worldly glory from me, and graciously, and supportingly
leading me through the valley of Baca, Psalm. 84.6. or tears, outward dangers,
and death, for now almost four years together, and seperating fromme for a long
time, that wonted delight that used to be betwixt thee (my old and real I doll)
and me; and at my coming to this place, clearly unrobeing me of all and every
one of my old friends, and familiar acquaintance, that were any way fit, or
able to do any thing for me; and thereby hedging up my way, that I must,
whether I will or no, in spite of my teeth, once again give ear to the serious
and plain voice, call, or counsel of the most High, speaking in, and unto my
soul.

And so in much mercy and indeared loving kindness, as he did in my great
straits in the Bishops time, provided and sent to me a poor despised (yet
understanding) Priscilla, to instruct me in, or expound unto me the way of God
more fully, or perfectly; (whom I am compelled now to tell thee, I shall love
respect therefore, the longest day I live upon the earth, let her continue by
whomsoever to be judged never so rigid or contemptible) so here at his place he
has also provided for me an Aquilla, (being a contemptible, yet understanding,
spiritually knowing, and single hearted Shoemaker) to do the same now to my
spiritual, and no small advantage, refreshment, and benefit, by means of all
which I am at present become dead to my former busling acting in the world, and
now stand ready with the devour centurion or captain, spoken of Act. 10. to
hear and obey all things that the lively voice of God speaking in my soul shall
require of me, upon the further manifestation of whose glorious presence, my
heart with a watching fear and care desires to wait, and to walk faithfully,
and tenderly, and humbly in that measure of Light already received, and out of
the strength of indearedness of love, and tenderness of affection, that has
long in times bypast, dwelt in me toward thee and of late in much sincerity
is renewed unto thee again; I have with the same eternal, wel-wishing of
thy-spiritual happiness, as I do my own, ordered Giles Calvert to send unto
thee several of those printed pieces of the quakers, that in the serious
reading of which have been most convincingly, instructive unto my soul; amongst
which I have judged in the first place James Naylor (that strong, or tall man
in Christ) his Something in answer unto (thy and my indeared friend) John
Jackson (that tall Cedar in great profession of Religion) his book called,
Strength in weakness, (which book the last Post I received from thee) in the
reading of which piece of James Naylors, I must set my seal to it, that there
goes along in the breathings out of it a great deal of the quickening life and
power of the spirit of God, and unto it are annexed several pieces of that
precious and divine soul, William Deusbury, the Lords now, or late glorious
prisoner, in Northampton common goal, (to whose precious and heavenly spirit,
although I never see his face, mine in indearedness of love is glued unto)
whose books is called, The discovery of the great enmity of the Serpent against
the Seed of the woman, and his discovery of man's return, have been pieces in my
reading of them seriously, that by the power of the Almighty has spoken home
to my soul I have ordered to be annexed unto them (as I remember) as many as
makes them ten in number; and then twelve more in another volume principally
for answering Objections, I have ordered to be sent unto thee, which I hope
thou will receive (before this come to thee) bound up in that method that J
have directed.

And now my dear love, for whom my soul travells with God for thy eternal good,
with the same sincere heartedness as for my own, hoping that thy late out-fall
and mine was but for a set season, that so as divine Paul in another sense
speaks, Phil. 15. thy reconciliation and mine again might now remain firm in
love for ever.

I therefore earnestly entreat thee, not to much cumber thy self in thy many
toilings and journeyings for my outward liberty, but sit down a little, and
behold the great salvation of the Lord; and if by any means possible thy spirit
can be made free to it, retire thy self but for one week, or the like, into thy
own chamber (as being sequestered from all thy friends and acquaintance) and
with as much seriousness and deliberation read this, and the forementioned
precious books, with the letter that thy and my indeared, spiritual, and
faithful friend, Luke Howard, yesterday sent unto thee (as the real out goings
of the measure of the spirit of God in his heart toward thee) as I have often
and deliberately read thy last Post-letter to me, Dated at VVhits-Hall, upon
Wedneseday the 28, of November last, and often wept for joy and gladness of
heart, at that they honest exhortation to me, at the last and of it in those
words, viz. My Dear, Retain a sober patient spirit within thee, which I am
confident thou shall see shall be of more force to recover thee, then all thy
keen m^tal has been; I hope God is a doing a work upon thee and me too, as
shall make us study our selves more then we have done.

O my dear Love, I am deeply already entered into my part of it: The mighty
power of God enable thee to get in too, and also to go through thine, and
effectually to go cheerfully and willingly along hand in hand with me, which
abundantly would render thee more amiable, lovely, and pleasant in mine eyes,
although thou were then clothed in rags, then thou could be to me in thy
drawings back, or standing still where thou wast when I last see thee, though
therein thou were clothed all over with rich, and outwardly glistering earthly
Diamonds, and in the greatest of earthly prosperities.

I am sorry for that hard portion thou tell me thou had in going from me,
in thy dangerous traveling upon the Thames, and I desire to bless God for thy
deliverance from so nigh a death.

I am also sorry thou art so straightly put to it for money, but to live upon
God by faith in the depth of straights, is the lively condition of a Christian:
O that thy spirit could attain unto it!

According to thy desire in thy Letter, and my own present genius or frame of
Spirit ( which now can contentedly feed savourily upon bread and cheese, and
Small-Beer alone) for saving of money. I have discharged my old Nurse, and
borrowed 20. s. to give her to carry her toward her husband, and by her have I
sent these lines to deliver to thine own hands.

Of which, poor ignorant soul, I must say this to thee in truth, that although
the woman, in my clear understanding, be but wholly in the first nature of
fallen mankind, yet she has been in the hand of God, an instrument of much
service, (honesty performed) faithfulness, and tender compassion to me, in the
day of the greatest and unparalelled extremity of my outward desires in the
Isle of Jersey, for which, in her station, I must value her as long as I live,
and if ever outward prosperity in any competent degree be my portion, really
requite her; therefore I expect from thee, if she have occasion to use thee,
that thou be tender and respectful to her for my sake.

And for my Liberty, about which thou so weariest and spendest thy self and
earthly strength, as thy Letter acquaints me with thou do, I can say no more
to thee then what was contained in my Letter, directed to thee, and Dated Nov.
21. last, (which I gave here to thy own hands) but that I am in my present
temper of spirit, ready really with Peter at the sight of the glorlous
transfiguration of Christ, to say, its good being here (for me) for here in
Dover Castle, through the loving kindness of God, I have met with a more clear,
plain, and evident knowledge of God and my self, and his gracious outgoings to
my soul, then ever I had in all my life time, not excepting my glorying and
rejoicing condition under the Bishops, and now the pangs and traveling throes
of God are powerfully afresh upon my very heart, and therefore now in my own
will, I could rather wish thee and my sweet Lambs to be with me here, then I at
present with thee and them where thou art, yet submissively and heartily I say,
and can say, the Will of my heavenly Father be done in me, by me, and for me;
in whose Will I leave thee and thine, with all thy and my friends, and rest,

From Dover-Castle, the place of the present enjoyed delightful dispensations
of the eternal, everlasting love of God unto my soul, the 4th. day of the 10
th. month, 1655. Thine in the strength of renewedness of true love, John
Lilburn


The forementioned second Letter, take in these following words.
Dover-Castle, the fifth day of the tenth month, 1655.
For my indeared friend William Harding, commonly called Mayor, at Weymouth in
Dorcetshire, these deliver.
Kind friend,
SInce my arrival here, I have often been desirous in my own spirit, at large
to have writ to thee, but hitherto by a power above me, I have been hindered,
and yet am, as to the particular aforesaid; only now I thought it not only
convenient to acquaint thee, but am thereunto compelled to tell thee, that
meeting here with one of those precious people called quakers, of which people
thee and I at the Isle of Iersey had much talk of, and getting into my hands
two Volumes of their printed papers, amounting to about seventeen hundred
pages, I have with seriousness of discourse, and serious reading therein, been
knocked down off, or from my former legs, or standing; and giving scope to my
true teacher and guide, the light of God speaking in my soul, I am become at
present dead to my fallen, or first natures reason, wit, wisdom, and desires,
and also totally become dead to my old busling ways in the flesh, and now in a
great degree or measure, am struct down dead to the very earth within me, and
by that light which gloriously with in my soul has shined round about my
first, or corrupt nature within me, I am like Paul with astonishment and
amazement, Act. 9. fallen down flat at the feet of Jesus, and hearing a voice
speaking within me, to persuade me for my good and benefit, to become willing
to be guided and directed by the heavenly wisdom of Jesus my Anointed; I have
thereupon given up my self wholly to be guided by his divine teachings shining
within me, before which I now stand ready to give ear to what by it shall be
told me, being willing and desirous to have the scales fall further from the
blind eyes of my soul, that they may be further opened; and that a power
therewith may come in to my soul, from the Holy Ghost, which may enable me in
the strength thereof, to redeem my lost, and misspent bypast precious time,
and not now to consult with flesh and blood in my daily taking up the Cross of
Christ, and following him whithersoever he shall by his call, or heavenly
Divine voice within me, lead me.

I say, I am compelled from a power within me, at this present time, in brief
to tell thee these things, and to require thee from God, to give ear to that
true convincing light, that clearly speaks in thy conscience, and by the
assistance thereof to strive with the first, or fallen nature yet ruling in thy
soul, and lay aside that greatness of wit and earthly wisdom that thou have
attained to, and in that measure of Light that long since thou have received,
withdraw into thy private Closet, and seriously meditate upon these brief
lines. And being thou in my late conversing with thee, told me, thou had
read, or had sent me down from London most of the Quakers Books; Let me in
love to thy soul, earnestly entreat thee, with seriousness to read over (strong
and tall in Christ) James Nayler, his sheet of paper, entitled, Something
further in answer to John Jacksons book, called, Strength in weakness; (which
John Iackson is my indeared friend, and old and long acquaintance, and a
greater professor of Religion now, then ever thou thy self in all thy zeal once
was; therefore in him thou may plainly read thy own condition) and that
precious prisoner of the Lords in Northampton Goal, William Dewsbury, his two
books, the first and excellentest of which is called, The discovery of the
great enmity of the serpent against the seed of the woman: and his other book
is entitled, The discovery of man's Return: and the Lord by his almighty power
set them home to thy soul. I heartily desire to return thee my hearty thanks
for all thy kindness and tenderness manifested to me at Jersey, in our passage
from thence, and at thy own house: so with my hearty salutations presented to
thee, and all thy friends that were with me at thy house at Weymouth. I desire
to let thee know, that by my moral, honest, careful, and industrious old Nurse
Elizabeth Crome (who by reason of shortness of money with me, I am forced and
compelled to part with) I have writ thee a few lines in her behalf, entreating
thy countenance and favorable respect to the old (and real serviceable to me
in my great distress in Jersey) woman; in case in things that are just and
righteous before God, she desire thy favor, and what thee, or thy friend and
mine, Edward (commonly called Lieutenant) Tucker, in that particular does for
her, I shall thankfully look upon as actions done to thy souls

From Dover-Castle, being a place wherein God has more clearly then ever
before, opened the eyes of my understanding, the 5. day of the to month, 1655.
Faithful, hearty, and real wel-wishing friend, John Lilburn.


With which forementioned main or principal thing that I have now to say, I
thus proceed, and go on with it; and here in the especial presence of the Lord
declare, that by that present measure of light now born up in my understanding,
and moving in my soul at this very time, I am here compelled to let the Reader
(whosoever he be) to know, that as I have long understood from my wife the
original of my foregoing Letter to her, she conveyed to the hands of Oliver
Cromwell himself, and at his Sonin Law's desire, Charles Fleetwood (my old, and
sometimes much familiar greatly obliging friend) gave him a copy of it, and
notwithstanding the clear declarations of a sincere (changed in measure) heart
in the said Letter, at the penning of which, I had then lost all manner of
ability to consult with one grain of Machivel, or humane deceitful policy,
having then the very dreadful, and aweful, immediate, convincing, judging, and
burning up power of God upon my soul; yet upon my said writing, and my wifes
disposing, as aforesaid, of my said Letter, many and great jealousies arise
upon me at White Hall, at the strange politic contrivance of my (largely
reputed by them) politic heart in my turning quaker, (of which I had several
ways exact information) which it seems out of humane fear, took that powerful
impression upon my poor weak wife, as that, as I judged by her Letters to me,
troubled the poor afflicted Woman at the very heart, and compelled her by
writing in a vehement manner, to press me to sign such an engagement as George
Fox did, (the Copy of which I have seen and read) and sent it up to Oliver
Cromwell to secure him from his pretended fears of my politic endeavoring to
craw the temporal sword against him; unto which for many reasons having then no
manner of freedom in the earth to do it ( George Fox though even then a
precious man in my eyes, his particular actions being no rules for me to walk
by, unless I lived in the very same life and power of Spiritual enjoyments that
he did, and had the very self-same motions in spirit from God, that led him to
a freedom and ability to do such, and the like particular actions) I therefore
then ceased it, and did it not; and if I had then done it for my own particular
human ends, as to avoid further persecution, and the like, I had in so doing
been an outside pharisaical imitator, and the greatest and basest of
hypocrites, which sin alone is the height of Gods Mat. 24.51. Rev. 3.15, 16.
See Mat. 6.5. and 23.13, 14. Luke 11, 44.46. etc.
abhorrance, for although I must before the Lord now truly avow, that the said
Letter was a true and faithful (without fraud or guile) declaration of as real
and spiritual a power of God in its measure, seizing upon my soul, for my
conviction of my spiritual blindness and sinfulness, as ever seized upon Paul's,
declared in the 9 of the Acts, or any man's that ever breathed upon earth, yet
betwixt the Winter-storms and fierce tempests of conviction, (or rather the
beginning of it) and the pleasant Sunshine, dewey, and springing days of growth
into a measure of refreshment, there is a vast difference; and therefore then
the true occasion, or real ground of all outward war and humane busling contest
being not taken away, or absolutely crucified or subdued at the very Root in my
soul, if then I had signed such an engagement, I had clearly gone beyond my
souls then living and real seize, and thereby ran presumptuously and
wickedly beyond my measure, and so had tempted the Lord my then present Leader,
and spiritual guide, and abominably sinned against him.

But now in my already attained growing up measure, having the experimental
witness of God within my 1 John 5.10.
self, that I am already truly and really attained, in substantial, and
witnessed within me, real truth, with the young men in Christ, spoken of by the
Apostle 1 John 2.13.
John, to a good measure or degree, in overcoming the wicked one within me, so
that now I am able to witness in truth and righteousness, that the true grounds
or real occasions of all outward wars, and all carnal bustings, and all
fleshly st^ivings within me, is in a very large measure, or degree, become dead
or crucified within me: wen true grounds and real occasions, of all the outward
iron and steel sword war in the world, and all the wicked and fleshly
forerunners of it and dependants upon it, truly rises from its fountain, the
raging power of sin, or lust within, in carnal, and unregenerated,
unsanctified, and unjustied (before God) men's hearts, as is plainly and truly
witnessed by the apostle Jam. 4.1, 2, 3, 4.
James in these words, From whence comes wars and fightings among you? come
they not hence, even of your lusts, that war in your members? ye lust, and have
not; ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain; ye fight and war, yet ye
have not, because ye ask not. Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss
that you may consume it upon your lusts. Ye Adulterers and Adulteresses, know
you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God: whosoever
therefore will be a friend to the world (that spiritual Kingdom of Satan in
unsanctified men's souls) is the enemy of God.

And therefore Christ, the true Lord of the soul, and the true Head-Master, and
King of that heavenly spiritual kingdom (as the Devil or Prince of the air, is
the Head-Master, King, or God of the Kingdom of this world, in the hearts of
the children of unsanctified, and unjustified, disobedient Ephesians. 2.2.3.5, and

Kingdom is not of this world, if my kingdom were of this world, then would my
servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my
kingdom not from Joh. 18.36.
hence; and therefore it was when Judas betrayed this spiritual King, Christ,
into the hands of his murdering enemies, and that his servant Simon Joh 18.10.
Peter stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and stroke a servant of the
High Priests, and smote off his ear; that this spiritual King, Lord and Master,
cured the wounded man, although he was his Luke 22.50 51.

further saying to him, For all they that take the Sword [mark it well] shall

Christ. And therefore the Spirit of Christ, this spiritual inside-King,
dwelling in the Apostle Paul, declares, that there is no fellowship betwixt
righteousness and unrighteousness, nor no communion betwixt light and darkness,
nor no concord betwixt Christ and Belial, nor no harmony betwixt the true
believer (that knows Joh. 17.3.
God) and the infidel, (and such are all they that truly knows not 1 Thessalonians. 4,

Idols? for ye are (says he to the true knowers of God in Corinth) the Temple
of the living God, as God has Levit. 26.12.

Almighty. And therefore it is, that the very same Divine Spirit that dwells in
this Spiritual King Jesus, speaking in the Apostle John, requires all his
Spiritual and true Subjects, not to love the world, neither the things that are
in the world, for, if any man love the world, (that Kingdom of Satan the Prince
of Darkness, as) the lusts of the Flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of
life, is not of the Father, but is of the world; and the world (and the
vanities and empty pleasures of it) passes away, and the lusts thereof; but he
that does the will of God, abides for 1 John 2.15, 16, 17.

Yea, the contrariety is so great betwixt the foresaid two Kings and Masters,
that whatsoever in the King, or Ruler in the Kingdom of the world, (or fallen,
or unrenewed man) and the Subjects thereof, is esteemed highly, or excellent,
is an abomination in the sight of Luke 16.15. See chap 6.24, 25, 26. Mar.
13.13. Joh. 5.41.44. and 7.17, 18. and 8.50.54. and 11.41, 43. and 15.19. and

God: And therefore this Spiritual King, having purchased all his Subjects and
Servants with a glorious price (as the greatest demonstration of love) of his
own blood, by his spiritual Command requires them not to be the servants of 1

pleaser, avowing himself, that if he were a man-pleaser, he should, nor could
not be the servant of Gal. 1.10. see 4.3.9, 10.11. and 5. 1 Col. 2.8.30.22.
Christ.

And therefore the same Apostle, by the infallible spirit of the Lord, requires
the Spiritual Subjects of this Spiritual King Jesus, to present their bodies a
living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which (says he) is your
reasonable service; and be not conformed to this world (the kingdom of the
prince of darkness) but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that
ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of Romans 22.1,

King Christ, and dwells in him, he becomes a new creature, and old things in
him are past away, and all things in him are become 2 Cor. 5.17.
new, spiritual, and savory; yea even his very thoughts, and his words are
found few and divine, his behavior righteous and solid, his deeds upright, and
free like God from all respect of Mat. 3.34.37, 39, 40, 41, 45, 46, 48. and

persons: and although there be such a perfect and absolute contrariety betwixt
all the laws and constitutions of these two Kings or Masters, and a continual
and perpetual war betwixt the Subjects thereof, yet the weapons of the warfare
of Christ's Spiritual, Heavenly, and glorious Kingdom, handled and used by his
Servants and true Subjects, who although they do walk in the flesh, yet do they
not war after the flesh, and therefore their weapons of warfare are not
carnal, but mighty through God; to the pulling down of strong holds, casting
down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts it self against the
knowledge of God, and brings into captivity every thought to the obedience of
2 Cor. 10.3, 4, 5.
Christ: The Armor of Proof of these Spiritual warring Subjects and Soldiers
of this spiritual glorious King, is to have their loins girt about with truth,
and having on them the Breast Plate of righteousness, and their feet shod with
the preparation of the Gospel of peace; above all, taking the Shield of Faith,
wherewith they shall be able to quench the fiery-darts of the wicked, and
taking the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the word
of Ephesians 6.13, 14, 15, 16.17.
God; which Spiritual Sword, or Word of God, is quick and powerful, and sharper
then any two edged Sword, piercing, even to the dividing asunder of soul and
spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
intents of the heart; neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his
sight, (who is this Spiritual sharp Sword, or eternal and everlasting Word of
God that indures for ever) but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of
him with whom we have to Heb. 4.12, 13.
do. With which Spiritual Sword this spiritual conquering Lord and King,
pricked and wounded to the very heart three thousand of his enemies at once, by
the Ministration of his single Spiritual Soldier, the Apostle Peter, which
made them bitterly to cry out for a Plaster, and a Physician to heal and cure
Act. 2.37.41.
them: which spiritual Sword is the only and alone weapon that this glorious,
conquering, spiritual King uses to fight withal against all enemies, the
powers of the Prince of Darkness of this world; and with which only and alone
he conquereth and Rev. 1.16. and 2.12.16. and 19.15.21. Hos. 6.7.
overcomes carnal Weapons of any kind whatsoever, having no place, nor being
of no use at all in his spiritual Kingdom, for his Subjects are to love their
enemies, to do good unto their haters, and to resist or requite their evil

in Gal. 6.10. and 1 These. 3 12^ and 5.14, 15. 1 John 4.16, 17.
love, and to be holy as God is 1 Pet. 1.15, 16.
holy, and perfect as he is Matt. 5.48.
perfect, and therefore not in the least to draw temporal weapons against their
enemies; for among the true and real Saints of the Lord in the mountain of the
Lord, where the Lord himself is the inward and soul-teacher and instructor of
his people and Subjects in his own ways; there all the temporal swords are to
be beat into plowshares, and their earthly spears into pruning hooks, and no
more using of carnal swords, or so much as learning of earthly war, is to be
exercised amongst Isa. 2.2, 3, 4, 5.
them, but they are to walk in the pure, holy, and peaceable light of the Lord,
which shall and will lead the sanctified, justified and redeemed soul to advance,
or set up the innocent, harmless, peaceable lamb-like nature, or seed of
Christ, to become Lord and King in the heart, of, and over the Lyon-like
warring; devouring, and destroying-wicked nature of the serpent, the devil, and
satan, within man, yea in the Gospel-mount of God, or the spiritual kingdom of
Christ (under the Gospel Dispensation) the habitation of the true Saint of God;
The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall ly down with the kid,

spiritual Kingdom, inhabited by the spiritual subjects, or true Saints of

Lights, or Rudimentall Ordinances) shall be no more thy Light (says God) by
day, neither for brightness shall the Moon give Light unto thee: but the Lord
shall be unto thee an everlasting Light, and thy God thy glory. Thy Sun shall
no more go down, neither shall thy Moon withdraw it self, for the Lord shall
be thine everlasting Light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. Thy
people shall be all Righteous, they shall inherit the Land for ever, the branch
of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. A little one

In all which consideration, I say, I have now the faithful and true witness
in my own soul, that the Lord himself is become within me, the Teacher of my
soul, and inabler of me to walk in a measure of his pure ways and paths; yea,
and so clear a teacher within me, is he already become unto me, as that I with
confidence believe my inward Teacher shall never now more be removed into a
corner; but is, and shall be as a continual voice speaking in my ears; This is
the way, walk in Esa. 30.20, 21. see chapter 24.18, 19. and 35.7, 8. and 42.2, 3,

by it into living power, to be raised up, and enabled to live in a pure measure
of Righteousness; and by which inward spiritual teachings, I am, I say again,
led up into power in Christ, by which I particularly can, and do hereby
witness, that I am already dead, or crucified, to the very occasions, and real
grounds of all outward wars, and carnal sword-fightings and fleshly buslings
and contests; and that therefore I confidently now believe, I shall never
hereafter be an user of a temporal sword more, nor a joyner with those that so
do. And this I do here solemnly declare, not in the least to avoid persecution,
or for any politic ends of my own, or in the least, for the satisfaction of
the fleshly wills of any of my great adversaries, or for satisfying the carnal
will of my poor weak, afflicted wife; but by the special movings and
compulsions of God now upon my soul, am I in truth and righteousness compelled
thus to declare, that so I may take away from my adversaries all their fig
leaf-covers, or pretenses of their continuing of my every way unjust bonds; And
thereby, if yet I must be an imprisoned sufferer, it may from this day forward,
be for the truth, as it is in Jesus: Which truth I witness to be truly
professed and practiced by the savouriest of people called quakers: And to this
my present declaration, which I exceedingly long and earnestly desire to have
in print, and for which I know that I can cheerfully and assuredly lay down my
life, if I be called to witness the truth of it, I subscribe my outward name

From my innocent, and every way causeless captivity in Dover-Castle, the place
of my souls delightful and contentful abode, where I have really and
substantially found that which my soul many years has sought diligently after,

the week, being the 4th of the 3d. month, 1655. JOHN LILBVRN, the new, or

AN APPENDIX TO This second Edition of my foregoing Resurrection Declaration.
AN Appendix to this second Edition of my foregoing Resurrection Declaration,
directed to the serious and single-hearted Reader, whom I desire to let know,
that in my reading of my own foregoing lines in the first Impression, I found
diverse mistakes or errors, committed by the Printer, the greatest of which I
judged to be in the very last line of it, in the Date of the Year, which he
has made 1655. but in my Copy it is 1656. which, with all the rest of the
mistakes that I can find, I have with my own hand amended in a printed Book,
and sent it up again the second time to be impressed. And being it was my
former order it should have no Title page at all, but the Title printed close
in the very same page that the matter begins in, that so the Reader might have
it at as cheap a rate as its possibe by the Bookseller to be afforded him. And
being I find in the second Impression there will be two or three pages of
white paper, I am therefore extraordinary desirous to fill them up at least
with two late Epistles, which I judge very pertinent for my old, affectionate
and faithful (though stumbling, and offended at me) friends, to see and read,
that so they may more fully see and read, that I have not of late taken up my
present principles without grounds and foundations in the Rock of ages, the
Lord Jesus Christ, that eternal and everlasting word of God, and divine and
heavenly light of the world, or fallen and sinful man, in whom was, and is
life; and the light was, and is the life of Ioh. 1.4.
man; which light, or life, is the living, quickening, holy, or tender part of
man. Which everlasting word of God, by whom all things were Ioh. 1.1, 2, 3.
made, I aver, is the divine and true light, that, in measure, inlightneth the
soul of every man whatsoever, that comes into the Ioh. 1.9. and 8.12. and
12.36.46.
world; and is that reproving, judging; and condemning witness of God, and for
God, that resides in the dark hearts of Jew and Greek, circumcision and
uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond and free; where the light Christ is
all, and in all, and died for Ioh. 16.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 26.

all, and infallibly leads all into the light of life, that (...) the light
within them, love it, obey it, and perseveringly abide in it; and condemnation
it is to all and every one of those that reject and despise it: And that he
has endowed my soul with an understanding, flowing from a fountain of light,
life, and power, able to make out to the least grain of mustard seed (or
measure) of spiritual understanding, those things which I have already attained
to; the Copy of the first of which two letters, take in these following words.

Dover-Castle, the 18th. day of the 3d. Month, 1656.
For his beloved Friend, Elizabeth Hunniwood, Wife to Edward Hunniwood, at her
House at Eventon, in the Parish of Elmstead in Kent, these deliver.
Beloved Friend, Elizabeth Hunniwood,
THe late friendly visit of me by thy Husband, in thy Fathers Name, and thy
own, has to me demonstrated a continuation of a measure of that former
greatness of friendly and indeared familiarity, that has been betwixt thy
Father, John Maynard, thy self, and me; and having the convenience of this
Bearer, Martha Gardner, the Wife of Robert Gardner thy neighbor, and Sister to
my Civil-Marshal, or now Jailer, William Spicer, I have freedom in my own
spirit by her, to visit thee thus with a few of my lines, and in them to
enclose two of my late printed books, (in which there are some few Printers
errors) one of which is for thy self, the other for thy Husband, in the serious
reading of which, thou will meet with the clear declarations of the Lords
gracious, and refreshing shinings in, by his divine light, of late into my soul.

That ripeness and greatness of wit that is in thee, may, it may be, lead thee
out to judge them foolishness; but let me in the wisdom of God ( to which all
man's excellentest of wisdom is mere 1 Cor. 1.20, 25, 27. and chap. 2.6, 7, 8,
9, 10, to the end. and 12.3. and 15.50. Romans 8.7, 8, 9, 10. Gal. 4.3, 6. Jam.
4.4. and 1 John 2.15, 16, 17.
foolishness) truly tell thee, there is no other way given under heaven to know
the will, Joh. 1.12.
or to have revealed to the soul the mind of the Eather, but by hearing,
heeding, obeying, loving, and following the light of Christ shining in the
soul; which light of Christ in its measure, is that grace, favor, or love of
God that brings (shows, or discovers) salvation, that has appeared to
all Tit. 2.11, 12. see Romans 15.18. and 1 Cor. 15.22. and 2 Cor. 15.14, 15. Ephesians.
1.23. and 4.6, io. Col. 1.20. and 3.11, and 1 Timothy 2.4, 6. and 4.10. and 1 John
2.2.
men, teaching them, or us, to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.

Yea, Christ is that true light, that inlightneth every man (in a measure) that
comes into the world; which divine and heavenly light, shines in the dark
hearts of fallen man, although the darkness is not able to fathom or comprehend
Joh. 1.5.9. and 5.40.
it; but to as many as receive it, and perseveringly follow and abide in it, it
leads them step by step up into a living power, to become the sons of God; yea,
to be freed from darkness, and heart-blindness, to walk in the light of life,
where there is no occasion of stumbling, but where the light is as clear as the
bright shining of a candle; yea, as the light that is in God himself, in whom
is no darkness at Joh. 8.12. and 11.9. and 12.36, 46. and 2 Cor. 4.6. Ephesians. 5.8,
12. and 1 John 1.5, 6, 7. Luke 11.36. see Joh. 14.15, 16, 17, 26. and. 16.7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 25. Matt. 11.27. Luke 10.22. Act. 4.12. and 10.43.
and 13.38, 39.
all.

Whether thou can receive any thing of this yea or nay, it will not add much
to me, nor diminish nothing at all from me; but know thou, my old beloved
friend, that all thy present greatness in the world, and all thy excellency
and quickness of wit, and mere outside greatness of religious, notional
profession, are but all as a blast of empty uncomprehended wind, that certainly
and swiftly passes away, but the light of (...) indures for ever, and makes
infallibly and completely happy that soul that minds and loves it, and
patiently and abidingly Joh. 6.40, 4^, 46, 47, 51, 54, 56, 57, 60, 63, 66. and
7.17. and 8.12, 30, 31. and 12.26, 36. and 13.35. and 14.15, 21, 23, 24. and
15.1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 4, 16 Acts 5.42. Heb. 3.14. and 5.9. and 1 John
2.6, 10, 14, 17, 24, 27, 28. and 3.6, 14, 24. and 2 John 9.
follows it.

Yea, and on the contrary hand, is the eternal, sure, and certain condemnation
of all those that despise, reject and contemn it, according to that faithful
and true saying of the Spirit of Joh. 3.19.
God: And this is condemnation, that sight is come into the world, (the hearts
of fallen men, infidels, or unbelievers) and men loved darkness rather then
light, because their deeds were evil: and therefore, there Verse. 36.
it is further said, he that believes on the Son, (the true light, and eternal
and everlasting word of Joh. 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
God) has everlasting life; and he that believes not the Son, (the true and
infallible light of God in the soul of every man) shall not see life, but the
wrath of God abides on him: And further, says the light himself, ( that
lights every man that comes into the Joh. 1.9.
world) to the wicked, and hard-hearted, unbelieving Jews, ye will not come to
me that ye might have Joh. 5 40.
life; although he plainly told them, the true and real way for them to be the
children of light and life, was by their believing in the Joh. 12.36, 46.
light; and therefore he requires and commands them to take heed that the light
in them be not Luke 11.34, 35. see Matt. 6.22, 23. Joh. 9.5. and 11.9, 10. and
12 35.36. see Romans 2.19. and 2 Cor. 4.4. Ephesians. 5.8, 11. Col. 1.13. and 1 These.

darkness, which it soon becomes to be, when the light which leads up to
purity, holiness and righteousness, is rejected, contemned, and despised, and
the voice or motions of the Serpent in the heart, is minded, hearkened to, and
followed; which voice or motions of the serpent in the heart, leads out into
slaying the motions of the just within; yea, even into the spiritual death and
rebellion against God, by which the creature in time comes to be heart-blinded,
and so by degrees to be given over to a reprobate sense, and to have the
conscience, of tender part of it, seared with a hot iron, so that it becomes
past feeling, so that the soul thereby comes, yea, even to be void of common
understanding, and destitute of natural affections, know nothing, but

My Wife and Babes are lately come down to live at Dover Town, but she being
there absent now from me, I can only in my own name salute thee and thy
Husband: If thou have any freedom to write to me, I should be glad to hear from
thee: And so in my Light and Life I rest:

first day of the week, being the 18. day of the 3d. month, 1656. Thine, as thou
art one in love and obedience to that true light, that now in much brightness

Robert Barrington,
BEsides those many and wrangling Encounters and Assaults, that I have of late
had, from several of thy mere outside Form, which they profess without life or
power, true Administrator, or right Subject, having also perverted that
sometimes Ordinance, or Divine Institution of God (VVater-baptism) from its
primitive forerunning end of Christ, the real sum and substance of all Shadows,
Figures, Rudiments, outside-Ordinances, and Types; yea, and of all the Prophets
(whereof John the Baptist was one) Administrations; to make it now all in all,
as though damnation were the absolute portion of him that has by faith never
so much communion in the spirit with the souls true spiritual food, the
spiritual Jesus Christ, the true and real light of the world, (or of all fallen
mankind) if he be not water-dipt in your mere empty, outside, vain,
traditionall, humane, invented (as you use it) form, which you falsely and
untruly call Baptism: I say I have, besides all aforesaid, from thee of late
received by VV. S. one of thy own Congregation, a Message to this very effect:

That by my turning Quaker, (as we are commonly called) I had denied the faith.

And therefore, although my late condition, or that first beginning of growing
measure, (to which through riches of mercy I have attained to) has much
required of me a silent, still, quiet, home-dwelling, patient waiting Esa.

upon God, (as having the declaration of a promise of blessedness annexed to
it, to be upon all those that so do) rather then to spend my then present
stock, or attained to portion, in running out in Pen-contests and
controversies, though for truth; but notwithstanding now to take away thy
reproach from the truth, and thy ordinary and continued blasphemy (as my often
information tells me) by thy self cast upon it, I do hereby truly tell thee, I
have of late within these very few days, been in spirit much compelled, merely
for the truths sake, (to which, according to my measure, to the very death I am
bound, as I am called to bear witness to) to endeavor to vindicate it from the
said reproaches: And whiles^ I was strongly meditating with the Rock of my
strength, the Lord Jesus Christ [the pure inlightner of my soul] is handed out
unto me, a necessity to revise anew for the Press my foregoing Declaration;
unto which, by way of part of an Appendix, I have had much impression upon my
spirit, to insert a few substantial lines unto thee in it, in truths behalf,
purely flowing from the dictates of that measure of Light, life and power; now
brought forth, and born up in my understanding, by which I am in a measure
enabled, truly and really to know Luke 24.44.45. comp. with Joh. 20.21, 22.

2 John 7.8.
the things of God, as they are in Jesus; and by which I am guided at this
present time thus further and substantially to express my self to thee, Robert
Barrington, viz. That the very, first Principle of all true Religion, is the
Light of Christ; without the real knowledge, embracing, and being guided by
which, I do here in the strength, presence, and power of the Lord, (my light
and life) aver, thou know, nor can not truly know without it, any thing of
God at all; no, no more then the devils know Matt. 8.28, 29. Mark. 1.23, 24,
25. and 3. 11, 12 and 5.2.5, 6, 7. Luke 4.33, 34, 35.41. and 8.27, 28. and
10.17. Act. 16.16, 17, 18. and 19.13, 14, 15, 16. Ja. 2.19.
acknowledge, and confess; or, then the high Priests, the Scribes, and
Pharisees, or Jews did know, that put Christ to death; who not only had the
Scriptures commonly and publicly read amongst them, but also many of them
believed the words spoken by the sound of the fl^^hly mouth of Christ, and yet
not minding the measure of Christ within them, he tells them plainly; they were
of their Father the Act. 13.26, 27, 28. chapter 3.12, 13, 14, 15. and 4.1, 2.5,
6.11, 12.17, 18. and 5.17, 18.21.28.40. and 6.13, 14, 15. and 7.1.37, 38.51,

And therefore I further lay down this as a positive Position, which through
the strength of God, I shall not only be able, by the Letter, or Witness
without me, viz. the Scripture, or Declaration Luke 1.1. Acts 1.1. and 10.37.

of the word of God, clearly to maintain against the ablest man whatsoever,
that speaks with a tongue that can, or shall oppose it; but also to lay down my
very life, by virtue of that measure of living power or life, already raised
up, or dwelling in me, for the defense of it: That is to say,

That the very principle of all true religion is, [without the knowledge of

This I send unto thee at the present, thus in print, without sending it in
writing to thee at all; because although much disturbance, or outside trouble
of late I have had by the blasphemous Scriblings* sent unto me, by, and of thy
brother, Jeremiah Elsreath, who after he had sent me in writing his 31.
confused and ignorant quaeries, etc. in his after-daring, and greatly provoking
Letter, the 19th. of the first month last bypast, he requires my Answer, etc.
in writing to them, boastingly saying, to me, etc. I shall answer you all, and
upon desire, procure the approbation of a sufficient number of hands, to make
the (his said) Answer a general act: And although he had a particular Reply to
his Answer to deceased [in Colchester Goal] James Pa^nels forty three quaeries
to the Water-Baptists of Fenstanton in Cambridge, etc. recorded in that
excellent and very much useful Book of his, called the VVATCHER, page 32, 33,
34. and a particular Answer to his own thirty one quaeries, and that from an
able and savoury soul, commonly called Richard Hubberthorne, which I did write
out fair in my own hand, and sent it to your Congregation by my faithful
Friend, Luke Howard, where, with much ado (long since I have understood it from
him, etc.) he got it publicly read; but yet, for any thing I can hear, thy
brother, Jeremiah Elsreth, keeps it privately and closely in his pocket, and
dare not be a man of his word to answer it, or Reply upon it; but is, as I
hear, going to sea, as formerly he has done, to take the wages of
unrighteousness again, for preaching out of his old bottle, the lying frothy
inventions of his own corrupt, and mere carnal heart, to a company of Sea men
aboard a Man of War: and therefore seeing he is likely to persevere in not
performing his said solemn Promise, given under his own hand; and seeing thou
thy self to Luke Howard, as he has often told me, declaredst by thy own mouth
to him; thy avowing Jeremiah Elsreths foresaid thirty one quaeries, in the last
of which he calls the Doctrines of declaring God within, and Christ within, and
Spirit within, and Baptism within, and Law within, etc. to be monstrous and
Satanicall Doctrines: And seeing thou perseverest upon all opportunies, with a
spirit of gall and wormwood, to reproach, persecute, and blaspheme the truth of
God, as it is in Jesus, truly professed by those savoury souls that thou
call quakers: I am therefore by the measure of God dwelling in my soul, at
this time thus compelled, and thus enabled to write to thee, requiring thy
answer to these my lines to thee, that so as God shall come in with renewedness
of strength and ability into my soul, according to his Esa. 40.28, 29, 30, 31.
recorded promise, I may in the face of the Son endeavor before the sons and
daughters of God, for to manifest my faith to be founded upon the sure Rock of
Ages, the Lord Jesus, by replying upon thee, and so stop thy, and thy said
brothers blasphemous mouths against the pure truth of God: And therefore as a
witness bearer to this I subscribe my name as known unto thee to be only,

From Dover-Castle, this 25. of the third month, 1656. John Lilburns.
