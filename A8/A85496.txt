TO THE Studious, and Ingenious READER.
TWO things (usually) make new Books famous; the Name of the Author, and the
Approbation of the Judicious: neither of these are here wanting; for thou see
that this Book (as part of its Title) challenges the Name of that Learned, and
Judicious Clerk, John Gouldsborough; A Name so well known (even in this our
Age) that I should but trifle away time, in multiplying words, to tell thee
what he was, and to enlarge upon his worth; and also discover (too much) mine
own weakness, by endeavoring to prove so known a Truth, that it is by all
(already) taken for grantld. For the second, I am assured, that the Copy has
been communicated to the view of many knowing men in the profession of the
Common Law, whose unanimous consent in a fair Testimony of the excellency
thereof, has been not only a chief cause of the now making it public, but
also of heigthning the Publishers hopes, that this Book will be perused with
as much content, and received with as general an Applause, as any thing (of
the like nature) that these latter years have afforded; And that his great
care and hazard in this his Edition may receive thy candid construction, and
himself reap (if not a fruitful) yet (at least) a saving return, for his
better encouragement to adventure further (hereafter) in this kind, for thine,
and the public good. For thy further satisfaction know, that thou have not
here a spurious deformed Brat, falsely fathered upon the name of a dead man, too
too usual a trick, played by the subtle Gamesters of this Serpentine Age; but
thou have presented to thee, though I cannot say the Issue of the Learned
Gouldsborough's own Brain, yet I dare say, the Work of his own Hand; and that,
which were he living, he would not blush to own. A Work, I say, not roughly
drawn, and cast by, in neglected Sheets, till time should give leave for the
perfecting thereof, but carefully transcribed (by himself) in a fair
Manuscript, destined (as it should seem) either for the Press and public
view, or to be preserved as a precious Jewel, to be (privately) made use of in
succeeding Ages. That this is true, there want not many living Testimonies, of
persons of worth, who do, and have very good reason to know his Handwriting,
that, if need required, might be produced, to say as much. I shall add but one
thing more, and that in brief is this, As the Author was very careful in
Transcribing and Correcting his Copy, that he might leave it fair, and entire
to Posterity; so has the Publisher spared neither pains nor cost in the
Printing thereof, that the Book may not come foul, and imperfect, to the hands
of thee, it is courteous, and ingenious Reader.

WAst war brought by Constance Foster, Wast.
and another, against Lessee for years, in effect the case was such; A man
makes a Lease of certain Lands, 44 Ed. 3. 34. b. 46 Ed. 3. 22. 28 Hen. 8. 19. a.
excepting all manner of Woods, the Lessee cuts down Trees, and he in Reversion
brings an Action of Wast, and by the opinion of the Court, the Lessee is not
punishable in Wast; for they were never let; and therefore the Plaintiff is
driven to his Action of Trespass at the Common Law.

2.
THe Sherif returns in a Writ of Right four Esquires to make the panel,
Return.
and does not say that there be any Knights, it was said by the Court, that he
ought to return them which be, and that there be no more.

3.
WAst was brought for digging in Land, Wast.
and taking away Oaks; the Defendant pleaded in bar, That the Queen by her
Letters Patents under the Great Seal of England, granted unto him, that he
might dig for Mines of Cole in the Land, and prayed that it might be entered
verbatim; and a Grant under the Seal of the Exchequor was entered; whereupon the
Plaintiff Demurred: Now came Walmisley, and would have amended it, and by the
opinion of the Court, he cannot amend it after the Demurrer be entered, Demurrer.
but Judgment shall be given for the Plaintiff, if he show no other matter.

4.
A Man seized of Lands in Fee, Devise and sale by Executors.
Devises to his Wife for life; the Remainder to his Son in tail, and if his
Son dye without issue of his body, that then the Land shall be sold by his
Executors, and makes two Executors, and dies; the Wife dies; one Executor
dies; the Son dies without issue; the other Executor sells the Land; and
Gaudy the Queens Sergeant moved whether the sale be good or no, and it seems
to him that the sale is good, and vouched the Case in 30 Hen. 8. Brook, Devise
31. And now lately, it was adjudged in the King's Bench, where a man did Devise
his Lands in tail, and for default of such issue, that the Land shall be sold
by his Sonnes-in-law, and dies, having five Sonnes-in-law; the one dyed, the
others sold the Land, and this was adjudged a good sale.

Anderson It seems the sale is not good; for if one make a Letter of Attorney
to two to make Livery and Seisin, Livery.
if the one dye, the other cannot do it: So if one grant the Office of
Stewardship to two, the one of them cannot hold Court alone: Stewardship.
And if one of them may sell, to what intent was the Statute of 21 Hen. 8. cap.
4. that those which take the Administration may sell?


Windham The Statute will not prove the case, but it seems the sale to be
naught; And there is a difference where one gives an interest to two, and when
he gives but an authority; Interest.
for an interest may survive, but an authority cannot. Authority.



Rodes to the same intent, and cited M. 4 and Eliz. fol. 219. a. and 177. and
210. and 371.

5.
BAttery, Battery.
by Webster against Pain, the Action was laid in London, and in truth the
Battery was committed at Uxbridge in Midlesex, the Defendant pleaded that such
a day and year at A. in the County of Huntington, 11 H. 4. f. 3. 11 H. 4. f.
61. 22 H. 6. f. 33. 21 H. 6. f. 9. 9 E. 4. f. 46. 43 E. 3. 23.
the Plaintiff made an assault upon him, and the hurt etc. absque hoc, that he
is guilty in London. Snag moved that the Traverse should not be good.

Anderson Will you have him to say, absque hoc, that he is guilty? that he
ought not; for by the special matter he has confessed the Battery, and you
will not deny, but that if his Plea be true, he has good cause to bar the
Plaintiff; wherefore if we shall not allow this Plea, we shall take the
Defendant from his remedy to plead, which God forbid: And in 2 Ed. 4. fol. 6.
b. In Trespass the Defendant showed special matter in London, where the Action
was brought in Midlesex. Tota Curia, Nelson Prothonotarie has showed a
president in 2 Ed. 4. where such a Plea as this was pleaded, wherefore the Plea
is good.


6.
NElson, Trespass.
Prothonotary, brought a Writ of Trespass against another, in effect the case
was thus; The Abbot of Westminster was seized of Lands, Unity of possession of
Common*
to which he had common in the Lands of a Prior; afterward, by the Statute of
Dissolutions, as well the Lands of the Abbot, as of the Prior, were given to
King Hen. 8. And after that, the Dean of Westminster had a grant of the Manor
which the Abbot had, and Nelson had the other Manor which the Prior had, into
which a Tenant of the Deans put his beasts, 11 H. 4. 5. 14 H. 4. 24 E. 3. 25.
Br. Extinguishment 14 Ass. pl. 20.
claiming Common, as once it was in the hands of the Prior, and Nelson brought
his Action of Trespass. Walmisley moved that the Tenant should have his Common.

Peryam Is this a new case? It has been adjudged heretofore, that by the union
of possession the Common is gone.


Anderson to Walmisley Have you any reason why the Common shall not be gone?


Walmisley No, my Lord, if the Statute will not help us; for the Statute is,
that the King shall have it in the same plight as the Abbot had it, and the
Abbot had Common, ergo, etc.


Windam So is the Statute, but the Statute does not say, that it shall continue
so in the hands of the King, and it is impossible that it shall continue in the
hands of the King as it was in the hands of the Abbot, therefore the Common is
gone.


Rodes assented.

7.
MOor brought a Quare impedit, Quare impedit.
and after Judgment had a Writ to the Bishop of Norwich, and at the alias the
Bishop returned, that after the awarding of the first Writ, and before the
receipt of the second, the Queen had presented the same Defendant by her
Letters Patents, who is admitted, instituted, and inducted, so that, etc.
Shuttleworth moved that the Ordinary might be amerced for his evil Return; for
when he had Judgment to Recover, he ought to have the effect of his Judgment;
for else it shall be in vain to sue a Quare impedit, and thereupon he avouched
the case in 21 Hen. 7. 8. and 21 Eliz. 364. Dyer, that the other Clerk shall be
removed.

Anderson the Return is not good; for me seems in a Quare impedit, when one
which has title Paramount presents, Title Paramount en qu. imp.
hanging the Writ, then allthough the Plaintiff has Judgment to Recover, yet
his Clerk shall not be removed; but if it be under, or after the title of the
Plaintiff or Defendant, then his Clerk shall be removed; and here he has
returned, that the Queen has presented the same man which is Defendant, and
therefore he shall be amerced.


Windham to the same intent, and cited the case of Long, 5 Edw. 4. fol. 115. b.
Rodes cited the case in Fitzherbert, Quare non admisit, fol. 47. k. and Bassets
case in 9 Eliz. Dyer, Alit. en pr. quod reddat.
fol. 260.

Anderson In a Praecipe quod reddat, if the Sherif return upon the habere
facias seisinam, that another has recovered by title Paramount against the
Defendant, and has execution, he shall be amerced.


Peryam How does it appear to us, that he which the Queen has presented, is
the same Defendant?


Shuttleworth By the Return.


Peryam No, Sir; and therefore it is good to be advised:


And after Windham doubted for the same cause. Et adjornatur.

TRistram Ayscough, Dower.
and Eulaleia his Wife brought a Writ of Dower of the endowment of her first
Husband; the Defendant pleaded in bar, that an Annuitie was granted to her
first Husband and her self, in recompense of her Dower, which she after his
death accepted; and the Plaintiff replied, quod recusavit praedict. annuitatem,
after the death of her husband.

Gaudy The Plea is nor good.


Anderson Your intent is, Disagreement in pais.
for that she disagreed in the Country, and not in a Court of Record, that the
disagreement shall not be good; but I think not so: for if she say in the
Country, that she will not have the said Annuity, this is a good refusal; and
if she once disagree, she can never agree afterward (quod tota Curia
concessit) but peradventure recusavit is no good pleading.


9.
FRancis Windham, Quid juris clamat.
one of the Justices of the Common Pleas, brought a Quid juris elamat against
the Lady Gresham, to have Attornment of certain lands comprised within the note
of a Fine levied to him by one R. Read: The Lady pleaded, that certain persons
were seized of those Lands, and held them of King Hen. 8. by Knights service,
and enfeoffed W. Read, and the Lady then his Wie, to have and to hold to them
and the heirs of the husband, who devised the reversion after the death of the
Lady to the said R. Read in tail, the remainder, etc. and that the said R. Read
levied the Fine, etc. whereupon Windham demurred in Law.

Gaudy The Plea is not good for diverse causes; the one is for the pretense of
the Tenant, for that the Lands were held by Knights service, the Devise is void
for the third part, so that therein the Conisor has nothing, but she does not
show who had the reversion of the third part, which she ought to show, and
thereupon he vouched 30 Ed. 3. fol. 7. and 34 Ed. 3. quid juris clamat. 14 E.
3. Fitzh. Quid juris cl.
The Defendant said that he held not of the Conisor, he ought to show who had
the inheritance; and 30 Hen. 6. fol. 8. in Wast brought by Radford. Another
cause is, for that in the end of her Plea she demands Judgment, Eisdem.
si pro eisdem duabus partibus, she ought to Attorn, and she does not speak of
any two parts before, and therefore it is not good, and vouched 7 Ed. 6. in the
Comentaries, Parliament held praedict. 28 Ap. and 9 Edw. 4. bona praedict. J.
S. and does not speak of any J. S. before. Then for the matter in Law, for that
the Conisor was but Tenant in tail, this notwithstanding it seems she ought
to Attorn, and thereupon he cited the case in 48 E. 3. fol. 23. in per quae
servicia, and 24 E. 3. Tenant in tail of a reversion of a Manor levies a Fine,
the Tenant for life ought to Attorn. And 3 Ed. 3. quid juris, etc. It is there
ruled, that Tenant for life shall Attorn upon a Fine levied by Tenant in tail;
and therefore she, etc.


And by the opinion of the Court, the exception, si pro eisdem duabus partibus
made the Plea evil without question, and therefore gave judgment for Windham,
that he should have Attornment, but they said nothing to the other points.

10.
SHuttelworth came to the Bar, Verdict.
and showed how an Ejection firm was brought of an entry into certain Lands,
the Defendant pleaded not guilty, and thereupon the Jury found, that he entered
into one moity, and not into the other; and this he alleged in Arrest of
Judgment.

Anderson It seems that Judgment shall not be given; for this is an Action
personal, and is not like to a Praecipe quod reddat.


Rodes It seems the contrary by 21 Edw. 4. fol. 16. b. and fol. 22. see there
the case intended.


Anderson The cases are not alike.


11.
IN the Exchequor Chamber before all the Justices, etc. the case was such, John
Capell gave the Manor of How-Capell, and Kings-Capell in the County of
Hereford, to Hugh Capell in tail, the remainder to Rich. Capell in tail, with
diverse remainders over; the Donor dies, Hugh has issue, William, and dies,
Richard grants a rent charge of fifty pound to Antony his son; William sells
the Land to Hunt by fine and recovery with Voucher, and dies without issue,
Antony distreineth for Arrearages, and the Tenant of Hunt brings a Replevin,
and A. avows the taking, whereupon the Plaintiff demurs in Law.

Fenner It seems that the Avowant shall have Return; and first I will not
speak much to that which has been agreed here before you, that a Remainder may
be charged well enough; for by the Statute the Remainder is lawfully invested
in Richard; and I agree well that no Formdone in a Remainder was at the Common
Law, and so are our Books, in 8 Ed. 2. and Fitzh. in his Not. brev. says,
that it is given by the equity of the Statute. At the Common Law there was no
Formdone in discender, now it is given by the Statute of Westminster 2 cap. 1.
For in novo casu erit novum remedium apponendum. And I have taken it for Law,
that when a thing is once lawfully vested in a man, Lawful vesture.
it shall never be divested without a lawful Recovery; and here the Recovery
does not touch the Rent; and I think that allthough the Remainder was never
executed in possession, yet the Grantee of the Rent shall confess and avoid it
well enough. The Fine is not pleaded here with proclamation, and therefore it
is but a bare discontinuance, in proof whereof is the case in 4 of Ed. 3.
Tenant in tail makes a discontinuance, Distress per grantee, before entry of
the grantor.
yet he in Reversion may distrein for his service. And if there be Tenant for
life, the Reversion to a stranger, and he in Reversion grant a Rent charge,
Tenant for life is disseised and dye, the Grantee of the Rent shall distrein,
allthough that he in Reversion will never enter: And so if Tenant in tail, the
Remainder to the right heirs of I. S. make a Feoffment in Fee upon the death of
the Tenant in tail without issue, Droit heir de I. S.
the right heir of I. S. shall enter well enough: And he put Plesingtons case
in 6 R. 2. Fitzh. quod juris clamat 20. and 8 R. 2. Fitzh. Annuity 53. And the
case in Littleton, and Dyer fol. 69. a. pl. 2. and 22 Ed. 3. fol. 19. One grant
a Rent charge to another upon condition that if he dye his heir within age,
Rent chapter sur. cond.
that the Rent shall cease during the minority, yet his Wife shall recover her
Dower when the heir comes to full age, Dower.
Perk. 327 Which cases prove, that allthough the estate whereupon the grant is
be in suspense when the grant ought to take effect, yet the grant shall take
effect well enough; and if Tenant in tail, and he in remainder had joined, this
had been good clearly. And 8 Ed. 3. and 43 Ed. 3. Tenant in tail to hold
without service, the remainder to another to hold by service, if Tenant in tail
in this case had suffered a Recovery, and dyed without issue, I think the Lord
(in this case) shall distrein for the service, then I suppose that the fine in
the principal case shall not exclude the Grantee from his rent; for there is a
difference between jus in terra, Jus in terra. Prox. advoc.
and jus ad terram; for I think that no fine shall defeat jus in terra, and 26
H. 8. fol. 3. a. b. if I grant you proximam advocationem, and after suffer the
Advowson to be recovered, the Grantee shall falsify in a Quare impedit, Then
whether this recovery shall avoid the rent or no, and I think no; for this case
differs, and now the recovery is had against Tenant in tail, for the remainder
here is out of him by the fine, and in the Coni^ee, and the recovery does not
disprove the interest before, for 8 Hen. 4. fol. 12. recovery against Tenant in
tail who dies before execution sued: And 44 Ed. 3. recovery of the rent is not
a recovery of the homage, Rent and homage.
unless it be by title: And here there is not any recompense to him in the
remainder, and therefore there will be a difference in this case, and where
there is a recompense, Annuity for Tithes.
fol. 7. Hen. 6. if a person grant an Annnity for Tithes, Nomine paenae
it is good, but if there be a nomine paenae, it is not good; and 7 lib. Ass.
an Annuity granted until he be promoted to a benefice, Promotion to a benefice.
it ought to be of as great value as the Annnity, and 26 Edw. 3. the Church
ought not to be ligitious; and 22 Ed. 3. two men seized in Fee-simple exchange
for their lives, etc. and 14 Hen. 4. the King may grant a thing which may
charge his people without, Rent for a release.
etc. And 44 Ed. 3. rent granted for a release by Tenant in tail, is good, and
shall bind and charge his issue. And so he seems that the Avowant shall have
return. Walmisley to the contrary; For first it has been held, that the charge
at the beginning is good, and so I hold the Law, bnt how, Charge contingent.
or in what manner, that is the question. 38 Ed. 3. If Tenant for life be, and
he in reversion grant a rent charge, it is good; but it shall be quando
acciderit. 33 lib. Ass. and 5 Ed. 4. fol. 2 b. But this case is out of the
Books remembered; for there the remainder nunquam accidit, and therefore shall
never be charged; for as I hold when he in remainder charge, he charge his
future possession, and not his present interest; Sci fa. de rem. View.
for if a Sci. fa. should issue to execute this remainder, he shall demand the
Land, and before the remainder falls he has but quasi jus, Attornment al
rent chapter Priority.
which is not corporal, neither ought it to be put in view in Assise; and 21
Hen. 6. a. Tenant of the Land shall Attorn upon the grant of a rent charge; and
33 Ed. 3. Priority shall hold place when the remainder falls, and not when it
is granted, 17 Ed. 2. and Dyer Tr. 23 Eliz. pl. 1. Then, Sir, when the
foundation out of which the rent is issuing is gone, the rent is also gone;
and therefore let us see what authority Tenant in tail has in the remainder.
At the Common Law, there was no Formdone in descender or remainder; and the
Statute of W. 2. cap. 1. provides but for two persons, viz. he in reversion and
the issues; but Formdone in remainder is taken by the equity. 50 Ed. 3. If
Tenant for life be, the remainder in tail to another, the remainder in fee to
the Tenant for life, and he makes wast, Wast. Bargain de remain.
Tenant in remainder shall punish him: and Fitzh. not. br. fol. 193. a. Cui in
vita, by a wife which was Tenant in tail upon the alienation of her husband:
And I think that if he in remainder bargain his remainder that it is void, and
he cannot grant to another that he shall dig in the soil, for by 2 Hen. 7. he
in reversion cannot do so. 12 Ed. 4. Recovery suffered shall bind the issue. 7
Ed. 3. no attaint lies for him in remainder of a verdict given against Tenant
for life, Null attaint pur tenant in rem.
then in this case he in remainder cannot enter, and the Grantee shall not be
in a better estate than his Grantor, and then if he shall never enter, frustra
est illa potentia qua nunquam reducitur in actum. The reason for the grant is
good; for when Tenant in tail dies without issue, he in remainder shall be in
by the first gift in proof whereof is 33 Hen. 6. he in remainder shall be in
ward; Ward.
and in 11 Hen. 4. in Formdone in descender, Formdone.
he shall say that the possession was given to his father. Prebendary.
And a Prebendary cannot charge before induction. Ioyntenants.
But if two Jointenants be, and the one charge all, and the other disclaimeth,
the charge is good from the beginning: And the Recoverer here is not under the
charge; for allthough he has that estate which he in remainder should have if
Tenant in tail had not aliened, yet is he a mere stranger, and in by another
title, 10 Ed. 3. If two Jointenants be, Charge per Ioyntenant.
and the one charge, this is good, conditionally that he which charge shall
survive. And if Tenant pur auter vie charge and die, occupans shall hold it
discharged: So in this case; for he is not in of this possession. Moreover,
there is a mischief if this charge be good; for then the Land may be charged by
two several persons at once, which shall not be suffered; but yet if cestui
que use charge, and the Feoffees charge, both are good, for the one is by the
Common Law, Charge per cest. que use and Feoffees.
28 Ed. 3. 10. b. and the other by the Statute Law. So if Lessee for years
charge, and he in reversion charge, and after Lessee for years surrender; but
this is in several respects, and I put this case for Law, Chapter per lessee, and
per enreversion.
that if he in the remainder bind himself in a Statute Merchant, Stat. Merch.
per test. en rem. ne charge le poss.
this shall not charge the possession. And if in this case he will grant the
rent over, none ought to Attorn, and therefore void; and Littleton says, that
he in remainder shall not falsify; No attornment. Falsifying.
and 26 Hen. 8. the Grantee of lessee for years shall not falsify; for the
nature of falsifying is properly to find a fault, wherefore it should not be
good; and what fault can he find in this case? surely none. Successor lie per
confession.
4 Hen. 7. 1. a. and 20 Hen. 6. Abbot confesses an Action, the Successor is
bound: And further, it is within the Statute of 27 El. for fraudulent deeds;
and we need not to plead the covin; for the Statute is general, Fraudulent
faits.
and vouched Wimbish case in the Comentaries, and so the Replevin is
maintainable.


And after at the motion of the Justices the Defendant agreed that the Plaintiff
should amend his Plea, and allege the Covin. Et adjornatur until Michaelmas
Term following, because there were so many Demurrers hanging to be argued in
Trinity Term next. But afterward judgment was given against the Rent charge.

12.
KIng Hen. 8. gave certain lands to Sir Edward Bainton, Trespass.
Knight, and to the heirs males of his body engendered, who had issue Andrew and
Edward, and dyed. Andrew afterward convenanted with the Lord Admiral Thomas
Seymer, that he would convey an Estate of those Lands to himself for life, the
remainder to the Lord Seymer in Fee; and in like manner the Lord Seymer
convenanted to convey an Estate of other Lands to himself for life, the
remainder to Andrew Bainton in Fee. Afterward Andrew Bainton levied a Fine,
and executed the estate according to the covenant on his part. Afterward the
Lord Seymer, before performance of the covenant on his part, was attainted of
High Treason, and all his Lands forfeited to King Edward the sixth, who dyed
without issue, and the Lands descended to Queen Mary, to whom Andrew Bainton
sued by Petition, and showed how she had those Lands to the disinherison of him
and his heirs: and Queen Mary, by her Letters Patents, ex certa scientia, and
ex mer^ motu, etc. granted to Bainton all those Lands and Tenements which he
had covenanted to convey to the Lord Seymer, and all reversions thereof, in as
ample manner as she had them; Et ulterius ex uberiori gratia sua she granted
all reversions, claims, and demands, qua ad manus suas devenerunt ratione, etc.
aut in manibus suis existunt, aut existere deberent. Afterward Andrew Bainton
levied a Fine of those Lands to one Segar in Fee, and dyed without issue; then
Edward Bainton entered, and Segar brought his Action of Trepass.

Puckering It seems that the entry of Edward Bainton is congeable, and so the
Action not maintainable. First let us see what passes by this Grant of Queen
Mary to Andrew Bainton; and then whether a Fine levied by Tenant in tail, the
reversion being in the Queen, be a bar to the tail by the Statute of 4 Hen. 7.
The first Fine as it is pleaded is not pleaded with proclamations, and
therefore but a discontinuance, and remains but as at the Common Law. At the
Common Law before the Statute of D^nis conditionalibus, a Fine levied was a bar
to all men; for all Inheritances were Fee simples, then by that Statute it was
ordained, Quod neque per factum, neque feofamentum, of the Tenant in tail, the
issue should be barred. After which Statute, as I intend, the Law was such,
that when Tenant in tail levied a Fine of such a thing as he might discontinue,
and the Fine executed in possession, allthough the words of the Statute were
Ipso jure sit nullus, yet the issue was put to his Formdone; but if it were a
Fine Executory, then by the death of the Tenant in tail the issue was remitted,
and the Fine void: But now by the Statute of 4 Hen. 7. the Law is made
otherwise; and for that here it is to be granted, that he cannot discontinue
the estate tail, because the reversion is in the King, as it was now lately
adjudged in the Exchequer in the case of Gillebrand, ergo, here the estate does
not pass to the Feoffees by the first Fine, when he took an estate again to
himself for life, the remainder to the Lord Seymer in Fee, but a Fee simple
determinable, then when the Lord Seymer was attainted, Queen Mary had such an
estate as the Lord Seymer had, which was a Fee determinable, and she had
another Fee absolute in jure Coronae: After when he sued by Petition he did not
show to the Queen what estate he had, nor what estate the Queen had, but that
it was to the disinherision of him and his heirs; then the Queen grants
reversionem inde adeo plene libere and integre as she had it, or as it came to
her by the Act of Parliament. And I think when the Queen gives by general
words, she does not give any special Prerogative: And for that 8 Hen. 4. fol.
2. A grant to the Bishop of London to have catalla, etc. and 9 Eliz. 268. in
Dyer, the case of the Duchy of Cornwall, and 8 Hen. 6. the King pardons all
Felonies, this is no pardon of the Outlawry, and especially when the Queen has
two interests it shall be construed beneficially for the Queen, as 9 Edw. 4.
Grant of an Office where the Grantee was no denison, see there Baggots Assise,
and 38 Hen. 6. the King grants Land to J. S. for the life of himself and J. D.
and after grants the reversion upon the life of one of them. And further the
case in Dyer, where Queen Mary grants in Manerium de Bedminster in Com.
Somerset, 5. 13 El. fol. 306. a. Then, Sir, the Patent is, that the Queen
intendens dare congruum remedium in praemissis, etc. and when he iueth to the
Queen by Petition, Petition certain
all titles ought to be in the Petition. 3 Hen. 7. and 1 H. 7. a Latin case,
the case of the corody, and this is in nature of a Petition, and therefore ought
to be certain, then the Patent is, Et ulterius ex uberiori gratia sua concessit
omnes reversiones quae ad manus suas devenerunt ratione actus Parliamenti, etc.
aut in manibus suis existunt, vel existere deberent, etc. and they are not to
be expounded so largely, as to make the reversion to pass; for if those words,
ratione, etc. were before admanus suas, etc. or after in manibus suis existunt,
then it cannot be intended but the reversion shall not pass to Bainton. Now
when in manibus suis existunt come after these words, References.
ratione, etc. for references are to be intended according to the meaning of
the parties, Devise.
29 lib. Ass. and 14 Eliz. Dyer. Devise of all Acres, except a Lease for 30
years: And those words, aut existere deberent, ought to have some relation,
ergo, it ought to be intended, quae in manibus suis existunt ratione
attincturae, etc. and this will not make any grant of the reversion. For the
meaning of the Queen was, because Bainton had no recompense of the other Lands,
No use.
to give him these, for no use was in him by the covenant of Seymer, as it is
agreed 1 Maria fol. 96. so nothing passed but that which was in the Queen by
reason of the atteynder of Seymer. For the other matters; I think that A.
Baynton is not Tenant in tail by the grant again; but admit him so, yet he
cannot discontinue, neither is he bound by the Statute of 4 Hen. 7. for the
Statute does not extend but to such things which are touched by the Fine, and
things which are not touched do not pass, as Commons, Rents, Ways, Claim per
lessee pur^ans. alit. postea si soit en post.
etc. Br. Fines, 123. 30 Hen. 8. fol. 32. And it has been adjudged in Sanders
case, 21 Eliz. that Lessee for years need not to make claim within five years,
and vouched the opinion of Br. tit. Fines 121. accordingly, that the issue
shall not be barred. And as the King is privileged, so are his possessions,
allthough that afterward they come into a subjects hands. General restraint.
And where one has a special Grant allthough a general Restraint come after,
if he do not speak specially of this, the Grant shall be good in many cases,
as 19 Hen. 6. fol. 62. the Parson of Edingtons case, Br. Patents 16. and the
case of the Abbot of Waltham, 21 Ed. 4. fol. 44. Br. tit. Exemption 9. and in
19 Hen. 8. it was doubted if the issue of a common person should be barred,
ergo, the issue in tail, the reversion being in the King, is not barred. And
the Statute of 32 Hen. 8. is general, as well for those which were of the gift
of the King, as others; and therefore afterward there was another Statute
made, which excepted those which were of the gift of the King, as it was before
the Statute of 32 H. 8. and it was a vain thing to make this Statute of
Exception, if it were a bar before by the Statute of 4 H. 7. And for authority
I have a report delivered me by a Sage ancient in the Law, that in 16 and 17
El. in Jacksons case, where Lands were given in tail, the remainder to the King
in fee, the Ten^nt in tail levied a fine after the Statute of 32 H. 8. by the
opinion of the Court, Difference per enter rem. and reversion in le Roy.
this was a bar, but the Court then said, that otherwise it should be if the
reversion were in the King, as our case is, wherefore seeing there is neither
discontinuance, nor bar in the case his entry is congeable, and the Action not
maintainable. Walmisley to the contrary; I will agree that it is not any
discontinuance, yet he may admit him out of possession if he will, as in 18
Edw. 3. Where Tenant in tail, the Reversion in the King, makes a Lease for
life, and has two Daughters and died, and Lessee for life was impleaded, and
upon his default the two daughters prayed to be received, and so they were; and
as me seems the Petition made by him to the Queen, shall not prejudice or
hinder the Grant, ex mero motu^, and vouched 3 H. 7. fol. 6. the Priors case.


Note that Puckering then said privily to Shuttelworth, is not the book
contrary to that which he has vouched? for he vouched the Book contrary to
that which Puckering had done before.

Shuttelworth No, Sir, but the record is contrary to the Book, quod nota, and
when she grants ex certa scientia, it shall be taken beneficial for the
party, 1 H. 7. 13. omnia debita released to the Sherif, and 29 Ed. 3. the King
seized the lands of a Prior alien, etc. Difference per enter interest and
prerogative. Touts droits poss. per fine. Fine puis disseisin ou discont. alit
de recovery.
and there is a difference between the cases put, and this case; for when the
Queen makes a Grant, all matters of interests may pass by the words, but
matters of prerogative, as in the cases put by my brother Puckering, cannot
pass, for they are not within the words, but interests are. To that which has
been said, that he was not seized of any estate tail, this is not any argument;
for if he had three rights, by the Fine all are gone and passed to the Conisee;
for if he be disseised, or discontinue, and then levy a Fine, this is a bar,
but otherwise it is of a recovery; Lessee pur^ans en reversion and poss.
diversity.
for that is no bar, but of an estate tail. And as to the case of Saunders,
that lessee for years need not to make claim, the case was not so, but the case
was of a lease inreversion, and he had never entered, and therefore it was but
as a common, or a rent; but if it be a lease in possession, he is bound, as in
Zouches case. Then because the King is in possession, it has been said that it
is no bar; but this seems to be no reason; for the Statute began with the
King, and the Preamble seems to induce it; and the third, saving of the
Statute, is by force of any gift in tail, so this is general: And because he
cannot discontinue, therefore can he not make a bar? Non sequitur: For he
cannot discontinue, and yet a Fine levied is a good bar; and the Statute of 32
Hen. 8. does not impair this opinion, but it was to take away the doubt moved
in 29 Hen. 8. Allthough indeed the Law was all ways clear in the case, as it
was agreed by all the Judges in Stowels case; and the words of the Statute of
34 Hen. 8. that the recoveries shall be no bar, does not extend but to the
words going before, as in the case in Dyer, that a man had not done any act but
that, etc. And the Queen in this case has not any prejudice; for she shall
have the rent with the reversion: And as for Jacksons case; that makes for me;
for the question of the case there was, that the remainder shall be gone, and
we ought not to take regard to that which is said indirectly in the case, but
the point of the Judgment is the matter; and for authority it is direct in
Dyer, fol. 26. pl. 1. and therefore it seems that the entayl is barred; and
so the action maintainable.


Anderson You have well argued, but for any thing that I see, none of you shall
have the Land; Grant.
for the Queen is deceived in her grant, and therefore the Patent is void, and
then it shall be seized into the Queens hands: And therefore you had best to be
advised, and we will hear what can be said for this point at another day. And
note, that it was said by the Justices, 3 Costs in forcible entry.
that if a man recover in a Writ of forcible entry, upon the Statute of 8 Hen.
6. by confession, or by default, he shall recover his treble costs. 22 Hen. 6.

ONe Colgate brought a Replevin against Blyth. who avowed the taking, Replevin.
and thereupon they were at Issue in Kent, and the Jury found a special
Verdict. The case in effect was this; Husband and Wife are seized of Lands in
right of the Wife: And she by Indenture in her own name agrees that a Fine
shall be levied, and limits the uses by Indenture. After the Husband by another
Indenture agrees that a Fine shall be levied, and limits other uses, and
afterward a Fine is levied by them both; now whether the uses limited by the
Husband shall bind the Land of the Wife in Perpetuity, The Jury prayed the advice of the Court, etc. For if they be good, they found for the Plantif, if
not, then they found for the Defendant.

Shuttleworth Sergeant It seems that Judgment shall be given for the
Plantif; For the use limited by the Husband, shall be a good limitation in
Perpetuity, Rent chapter ou Lease per feme covert.
and first the Wife only cannot limit any use, for her Acts are of no Validity.
And therefore if a Wife grant a Rent charge, or make a Lease, and the Grantee
enter, this is a Disseisin, and 43. Ed. 3. Deeds given by a Feme Covert are
void. and 17. lib. Ass. a Wife levies a Fine Executory, Fine executory
executed. per feme covert.
sur grant and render, as a sole Woman, and after a Scire fac. Is brought to
Execute this Fine, the Husband shall extort the Execution, and if it were a
Fine Executed, then it is a Disseisin to the Husband. Use quod.
For an use is a Declaration how the Land shall continue in Perpetuity, and the
Feoffees are nothing but Instruments, or Organs to convey the use, for the Land
yields the use and not the Feoffees; then when the Wife which is under the
Power of her Husband, Limitation per infant quaere.
limits an use, this is void, for I hold for Law, if an Infant limit uses, and
after levy a Fine, and do not Reverse it during his Nonage, yet the limitation
shall not bind him, and so of a man non compos mentis. Non compos mentis.
And so it was ruled in the Court of Wards, where a natural Idiot made a
Declaration of uses, and levied a Fine accordingly, Idiot natural.
that yet it shall be to the use of himself. And then in our case the
Limitation by the Wife cannot be good, but her Will depends upon the Will of
her Husband, and the expressing of the use by the Husband shall be good.
Estate, disseisin, and assumsit al feme.
For if an Estate be made to a Wife, if the Husband seven years after agree,
it is good, and so it is of a Disseisin to a use, so ofan Assumpsit to the
Wife, 27 Hen. 8. in Jordans case, and 1 Hen. 7. in Doves case, and in a
Pra^cipe quod reddat, the default of the Wife shall be the default of the
Husband, Default del feme.
because she is Compellable to the Will of her Husband by the Intendment of the
Law. 21. lib. Ass. A man seized of Land in Right of his Wife, makes a Feoffment

and would have made Livery, but the Wife would not agree to the Livery, yet
notwithstanding the contradiction of the Wife, the Livery was Adjuged good. and
33 Hen. 6. Husband and Wife are Plantifs in an Assise, Nonsuite del feme.
and the Husband would Prosecute, but the Wife would be Nonsuite, the act of
the Husband shall be accepted, and the act of the Wife rejected. So if the
Husband will make an Attourny and the Wife will dissavow him, Attourny.
yet he shall be their Attourny. And as I think this Limitation by the Husband
shall bind the Wife in perpetuity: Case per fine and indentare Difference.
Juris clamat.
For if the Husband make a Lease of the wifes Land for 100 years, the Wife may
avoid it after his death; but if after they both Levy a Fine, the Lease shall
be good-for ever. And 11 Hen. 4. He in Reversion, and one which has nothing,
Levy a Fine, and quid juris clamat shall be brought against them both. And as I
conceive it, it shall be counted her folly, Reentry per condition.
that will take such a Husband as will Limit such uses. For if a Wife has an
Estate in Land, upon condition for not payment of Rent that the Feoffor shall
reenter, if she take a Husband, which does not pay the Rent, whereby the
Feoffor or his Heirs reenter, the Estate of the Wife is utterly defeated. And
in 4 Ed. 2. A woman Tenant takes a Husband, Cessavit.
who cease by two years, whereby the Lord brings a Cessavit, and
recovereth the Inheritance of the Wife, she shall be bound. And this appears
in Fitzh. in Cui invita. 21. And it shall be so if the Wife has but a
Freehold, Wast.
as it is in 3 Ed. 3. A woman Lessee takes a Husband, who makes Wast, whereby
the Land is recovered, and 48 Ed. 3. fol 18. Husband and Wife sell the Land of
the Wife, this is only the sale of the Husband; but if after they Levy a Fine,
this shall bind the Wife. And for express Authority it is the case in Dyer,
Jointure.
fol. 290. a pl. 2. And so it is a Common case if a man seized of Lands, takes
a Wife who has a Jointure in his Land, and he makes a Limitation of uses, and
after they both Levy a Fine, this shall be the Limitation by the Husband,
because it shall be intended that the Wife consented, if it does not appear to
the contrary. Whereby the Declaration of the use here by the Husband, shall be
good to bind the Wife, and therefore Judgment ought to be given for the
Plantif. Fe^ner to the contrary, for here the Inheritance is in the Wife, and
where the Husband limits further than he has Authority, there the Law shall
make a Declaration of the uses, for the Husband cannot Limit uses of that which
he has not, 21 Ed. 3. A man takes a Wife seized of Lands in Fee, Atteynder del

and before that the Husband was entitled to be Tenant by the Courtesy, the
Wife was attainted of Treason, Homage.
the Land shall be forfeit; and 44 Ed. 3. He shall not make Homage, Conusans.
before he be entitled to be Tenant by the Courtesy. 12 R. 2. Conusans shall be

to which there is a Villain regardant, the Villain Purchases Lands, the

otherwise it is where a man is Lessee for years of a Manor, to which, etc. For
he shall be seized of the Perquisite in his own Right. Divorce.
12. lib. Ass. If he be Divorced, his Estate is gone. Lease and Rent chapter
diversity.
And I agree to the case, put by my Brother Shut. Where the Husband makes a
Lease for years, and after he and his Wife levy a Fine, there the Lease shall
be good, but if the Husband grant a Rent charge, and after he and his Wife Levy
a Fine, I do not agree that this is good, for in the first case the Conisee
found one which had an Interest in the Land, but not in the last. Then, Sir,
here the Husband has no power to Limit the use for the Land of his Wife to
endure for ever. Feoffee al use.
28 Hen. 8. The Feoffece to use at the Common Law, Limits an use to a stranger,
this Devesteth the first use, but if he limit is to cestui que use, then it is
an ancient use, and not new. And so it is if Tenant for life, and he in
Reversion levy a Fine, this shall be to the use of him in Reversion. 2
Loyntenants.
And so if two Joyntenants be in Fee, and they limit several uses, this shall
be good according to their limitations for the Moities of either of them, and
for no more. And if Husband and Wife levy a Fine to the use of the Husbands
Son, Fits del baron:
yet this is to the use of the Wife, but if he be the Wifes Son also, then
this is a good consideration, and the use shall be accordingly. And these cases
I put to this intent, that when a man limits an use which is repugnant, Use
repugnant.
or further than he has Authority, the Law shall make a Declaration of the
same use, for Bracton says, Nemo potest ad alterum plus juris tranferre, quam
ipse habet. And I take the Law, if Husband and Wife levy a Fine of the Lands of
the Wife, and render back to the Wife in Tail, Fine levy de terres del feme
O^e r^eder al feme en tail.
and the Husband dye, and the Wife discontinue, that this is not a Purchase of
the Husband within the Statute of 11 Hen. 7. And so it was here adjuged in 18.
of Eliz. in Alexanders case. And I agree to that which has been said* that the
Wife only cannot limit uses; but because the Jury has found for ^he Defendant,
if the limitation by the Husband be not good (as I think it is not) then
Judgment shall be given for the Defendant. Concessum.

WIlliam Knight, Eject. firm.
as Eessee for yeas to Sir John Fortescne and Rich. Thikston Gentleman, brought
an Executione firm against W. Bre^h, of one Mesnage with the Appurtenances in
Themilstreet in the Parish of St. James Clarkenwell, the Defendant pleaded not
guilty, and the Jury appeared at the Bar, and Evidence given on both sides; And
at the length the Plantif Demurred in Law upon the Evidence given for the
Defendant, Demurrer al evidence.
and thereupon the Jury were discharged. And now Gaudy the Queens Sergeant came
to the Bar, and demanded Judgment for the Plantif, The case.
and rehearsed the case in this sort. The Prior of St John's of Jerusalem in
England by deed Indented, A. 29 H. 8. Devised a Mesuage called the high House,
13 Cotages, one Stable, and 14 Gardens, for 59 years to one Corda^l, rendering
5. l. 6. s. 11. d. viz. For the 13 Cotages, iij. l. And for the high house
xiiij. s. and for the Stable xx. s. and for, etc. And if it happen the Rent to
be behind by three months, then the Prior to reenter; after by an act of
Parliament, An. 31. Hen. 8. the Priory was given to the King, and he Vested in
actual Possession thereof, with all Conditions and Covenants etc. as the
Lessor had. Afterward the King 29. Sept. An. 36. by Letters Patents gave the
St^ble to the same Cordall, and one H. Audley in Fee, and the Reversion of the
other Parcells descended to the Queen which now is, whereupon 8 die Maii, An.
23. Issued a Commission out of the Exchequer to enquire, si praedict. Cordall
and assign. sui perimplevissent and performassent omnes conventiones and
promissiones, fact. and reservat. super praedict. Indent dimissionis and
praemissis fact. etc. And the Commission was retourn'd in Michaelmas Term
after, and it was found that the four usual Terms in London are the Feasts of
St. Michael, the Birth of our Lord, the Annunciation, and the Birth of St. John
Baptist, for the Rent was to be paid, ad quatuor terminos Anni infra Civitatem
London usuales. Vsuales terminos.
And further by the same Jury, being a Jury of Middlesex, it was found that 37.
s. 5. d. ob. Part and Parcel of the said Rent, were behind not paid, by three
Months next after Michaelmas last past before the taking of the said
Inquisition. Cordall made Burnell his Executor, and died. Burnell granted all
the Term to Brech the Defendant. Afterward the Queen 5 Augusts An. 23. (which
was before the return of the Inquisition) and before any Entry or Seizure made
by her, or by any other, to her use, granted the high House to Sir John
Fortescue and Thekston in Fee, and they entered upon Berch and made the Lease to
the Plantif for three years, etc. And first it is to be considered if they be
several Rents in this case or no; Several Rents.
because he says, viz. For the high house 14. s. etc. For that I take the Law
to be very strong, Co^cessum per Fenner, Rodes.
that they be several Rents, for allthough that he says first, requiring 5.
l. 6. s. xj. d. which is an entire sum, yet when he says afterward, for the
high House so much, and for the Stable so much, etc. This makes a severance,
and for that I will remember the case in Dyer, fo. 308, Feoffment per deux.
so I hold the Law, if a Feoffment be made by two, rendering xx. l. a year, viz.
x. l. to the one, and x. l. to the other, these are several Reservations; but
because I hold the Law clear in this point, I will speak no more to it. Another
matter is when the Commission issues to enquire of all Covenants and Promises
contained in the Indenture to be performed by Cordall, Conc. per Rodes. Lease
sur condition en un proviso.
if the finding by the Jury be contained within these words, Covenants and
Promises, etc. And I think they be; for if a man make a Lease to one for years,
and if it happen the said Rent to be behind, that then it shall be lawful to
the Lessor to reenter, as I think this is a Proviso for the Rent; so the case
in 22 Hen. 6. A Lease was made for years, Rent an agreement.
rendering Rent, the Lessee is bound to perform all covenants and agreements; if
he do not pay the rent the obligation is forfeit; Co^cess. per Fenner.
for the payment of the rent is an agreement: So in this case the proviso does
extend to the payment of the rent. And as for the exception which was taken,
viz. That the Jury find that 37 s. of the rent was behind, and do not say
expressly, for the house which is now in question, I hold that a vain exception;
for when they have found that more was behind than that which was now in
question, allthough that it be in generality, yet it is good for the
particularity; and for that matter I could remember many cases, but I will not
doubt of a matter (as I think) without doubt. But for the condition, which is
the great matter of the case, First, the condition is vested in the King, by
the express words of the Statute and, Condition.
as I think, grant of parcel shall not extinguish the whole condition. In the
case of a common person the condition shall be utterly gone, and so are our
Books; otherwise, peradventure, I would doubt of that also; but because the
Book is so, in Dyer 14 Eliz. fol. 309. I will speak no more of it; but the case
of the King differs from a common person; Rent charge to the King. rent seck.
for as he is the Head, and supreme Governor of the Commonwealth, so he is the
superior in Prerogatives and Preheminences. 13 Ed. 3. and 14 Ed. 3. A rent
charge granted to the King, he shall distrein for it in all the lands of the
Grantor: and 8 Hen. 5. if a rent seck comes to the King, he shall distrein for
it, and yet it is called seck, because no distress is incident thereto: And
there the principal case was of a Fieri facias. No demand by the King.
and 2 Hen. 7. the King shall not demand his rent. But it has been said, that
because conditions go to the destruction and determination of estates, Cond.
strictly taken.
that therefore they shall be taken strictly; to which I agree; but not in the
case of the King, as in Bro. Apportionment 23. and 168. and so are the
presidents in the Exchequer, if a man be bound in a Statute Merchant, and after
the Conisor enfeoffes the King of parcel of the land, Conisor enfeoffes le Roy.
and enfeoffes a stranger of another parcel, and afterward the Statute is
forfeit to the King by atttainder, the King shall have execution against the
other feoffee: And in many other cases the King is privileged, especially in
things entire: For if there be two Coparceners, and one be in ward to the King,
Entire presentation.
he shall have the entire presentation of all. And in this case, I think, that
before the condition shall be destroyed, that the Patent made to Cordall shall
be void; for it is not ex certa scientia, and mer^ mot^, but it is general,
and it was not the intent of the King to take away the entire condition: And
allthough the King grants the reversion, yet the condition which was once
vested in the King, as I think, remains in him still; for in 31 Edw. 3. an
advowson descended to three persons, and the youngest is in ward to the King,
and he granted it to Queen Philip his Wife, Advoson to 3 parceners.
and she granted it over to the Earl of Arundell, who granted it to the eldest
parcener, the Church became void, the King had the presentation; for when the
King was possessed of the wardship of the youngest, he was entitled to present
for all; and when he granted the ward over, this did not divest the title of
the two eldest which was vested in him before: and 37 Hen. 6. the Grant of the
King upon a false suggestion is void; False suggestion
and in Littleton, he shall have account against Executors; and yet the Law is
clear, Account.
that an Action of Account will not lie against Executors; and so for all those
Reasons Judgment shall be given for the Plaintiff. Several reser^ations.
Fenner to the contrary: And first, I agree that they are several
reservations; and so is the case which has been remembered in 8 Ed. 3. A Lease
was made of eight Acres of land, reserving eight shillings of rent, viz. for
every Acre 12 d. thi^ is several; and to that which has been said, that the
condition is a proviso, I deny that; for a proviso, Provisio quid sit
as me seems, either is in the affirmative, that a thing shall be done; or in
the negative, that it shall not be done; but here it is neither directly
affirmative, nor negative, and therefore they have found it without commission;
Agreement.
but I confess that agreement extends to rent, 22 Hen. 6. and 14 Hen. 8. then
the Jury which was of Mtdlesex have found the four usual Feasts in London,
viz. St John's, etc. and this as it seems they cannot do, because it is a
thing in another County; especially they being but an Inquest of Office.
Further, they have found that 37 s. was behind at one Feast, and this is
impossible; for then the entire rent should amount to 7 l. And further, the
Lessors have purchased the reversion, before the return of the Inquisition and
Commission, and then the Queen cannot be entitled, because she has not the
Freehold; for it has been adjudged here, that if a man fell his lands, and
afterward makes livery thereof, and after inrolls the sale, this shall not
have relation to the date of the deed, because it takes effect by the livery
which was before the inrolment: And 8. Edw. 3. Feoffment puis atteynder.
A man attainted of Treason makes a feoffment of his land after he is restored,
yet he shall not have the land; yet if he had not made the feoffment, he should
have been restored to the land with the mean profits. Then if the King grants
the reversion, if he shall have the condition remaining, and I think not; for
the King has it by express words of the Statute, as the Prior had it; and if
the Prior had granted parcel of the reversion, De percell de Reversion.
the entire condition had been gone, and the King shall be in the same case;
for Cessavit is given by the Statute of Westminster 2. cap. 21. eodem modo as
in the Statute of Gloucester, cap. 4. This does not ly of an estate tail, no
more than a Cessavit by the Statute of Glouc. 8 Ed. 2. And so I think Judgment
shall be given for the Defendant.

De Term. Trinitat. Anno xxviij. Eliz. Reg.
1.
ROd^s Justice Judgment shall be given for the Plaintiff. First, I agree that
they are several rents; and yet this question does not go to the overthrow of
the Action; in proof whereof both great reason and authority is copious: For if
the Lessor had entered into parcel, this had not suspended the entire rent; or
if the reversion of parcel thereof were granted, this shall carry no more than
that which is granted; (and so it was held by the Justices) when it was granted
to Cordall. Parcel entered into.
And 2 H^n. 6. if I reserve an entire rent, and the Lessee will pay but
parcel, etc. and 17 Ed. 3. fol. 52. by Sharde. and 11 Ed. 3. lib. Ass. If I
make a Lease of two Acres, reserving for the one Acre x. s. to me and to mine
heirs; and for the other Acre x. s. generally: And Dyer, fol. 308. b. and Lib.
Ass. pl. 23. If three Coparceners be, and rent be reserved for equality of
partition, but one Scire fac. shall be brought; for it is brought but upon one
record; 1. Scire fac.
and Littleton pl. 316. but one action of debt for Tenants in common, but
several Avowries; so I hold that they be several rents in this case, and yet
but one condition: And for that let us see if by grant of parcel, the entire
condition be gone. In the case of a common person, it is all gone, as it was
adjudged here in Hill. last, where a man makes a Lease for years, reserving xx
l. for rent, Sum in gross, and rent reserved upon cond.
and also a sum in gross of xxvl. was to be paid to the same Lessor, upon
condition, if the rent, or sum in gross were behind, then a re-entry to be
made. Afterward the Lessor took an Estate back again of parcel of the term,
the sum in gross was not paid, and it was adjudged that he shall not take
advantage by the condition; for when he took an estate back again, the rent was
suspended, and then for the sum in gross he shall not re-enter, because the
condition was entire; Cond. entire.
but all though that the case of a common person be so, yet the Princses case
differs; for she shall have her Prerogative; and for the Pre-eminence which the
Queen shall have, I refer you to the argument of Justice Weston in the case
of the Lord Barkley: Coment.
And that the Queen shall have her Prerogative in a condition, I will remember
the case of the Abesse of Sion, and 38 Hen. 6. and 21 Hen. 7. the King may make
a feoffment in fee upon condition that the Feoffee shall not alien, Feoffment
in fee upon cond. reservation.
and 2 Hen. 7. and 35 H. 6. he may reserve a rent to a stranger; and 21 Eliz.
the Queen grants her debt to another, and he in reasonable time will not
prosecute, the Queen may take it again, gain, Gr^^t of a debt
and may sue: And also Cranmers case, where King Hen. 8. gave lands to the use
of him for life, and after to the use of his Executors for twenty years, Rent
charge after atteynder.
after he was attainted, the Queen shall have this rent as a rent charge, and
yet she had the reversion before. And in reason it seems the Queen may
apportion her condition; for if this condition by the grant to Cordall shall be
avoided, four principles shall be overthrown; for it is a principle That the
King shall not be deceived in his grant. 2. Item, that when concourse and
equality of titles come together, 4 Principles for the King.
that King shall be preferred. 3. Item, in entire things he shall have all. 4.
Item, that his grant shall not extend to several intents or purposes: For the
first, if the King be deceived Release several.
this shall be void. 6 Hen. 7. release of all demands. 11 H. 7. 10. release of
all action, and yet in those cases there is matter of interest and not
prerogative, and yet nothlng passes if she be deceived. For* the concourse of
title, 4 Ed. 6. a man makes a feoffment in fee, upon condition that the feoffee
shall Treason.
and 44 Ed. 3. per Thorp, tenant of the King, etc. he shall have the rent
again: And for the case of the Lady Hales in the Comentaries, where lands
descend to a villain. For entireties, 44 Ed. 3. The. King sole founder.
19 Hen. 6. he shall have the entire obligation where the one obligee is
outlawed: Obligation.
and in 11 Hen. 7. and 2 R. 3. two are indebted to the King, Release to the
oblige.
and he releaseth to one of them, then his grant shall not inure to two
purposes, Bagg^ts Ass. And so if the King give lands to his Vill^in.
Then for the third matter, when the commission issues to enquire of all
covenants and provisoes, if the condition be within those words; and for that
point I think that the Plaintiff shall recover; for allthough it be not within
the words, yet the commission is general after; but yet I hold that is within
the words, 21 Hen. 7. fol. 37. per Fineux. If I let land for term of years,
rendering, etc. I shall have debt or covenant at my election: and Dokerayes
case, 27 Hen. 8. Proviso is a condition, and so it was held here in the case of
the Lord Cromwell and Andrews. Then when the Jury found that 37 s. 5 d. ob.
were behind, if this office be good or no? and in my conscience that which is
good, shall be taken for the Queen, and the rest shall be void; for offices
between party and party may be void for uncertainty, as the case is in Dyer, 3
and 4 Eliz. Office in Beverley, etc. fol. 209. Or they may be avoided for
falsity, Proviso is a condition.
1 M. Culpepper fol. 100. b. Or for insufficiency, as in my Lord of Leicesters
case in the Comentaries, Offices void.
but this is only for the Queen, and therefore shall be taken favorably, and
therefore I will ^ompare it to a verdict where surplusage is found, 3 Hen. 6.
Plene administravit, Superplusage in a ^erdict.
and the Jury found that they have more than Assets. 47 Ed. 3. the Jury found
that he which prayed to be received had nothing in the land, where the issue
was joined, whether the particular tenant had a fee. And 39 Hen. 6. 9.
surplusage in an Inquisition. and 5 Hen. 5. fol. 2. Resceit.
Cobhams case, where they found a Divorce in Kent, etc. Inquisition.
Also, Sir, Offices may be good for that which is certain and void, for that
which is uncertain, and good for the King, and not for a subject, Strenes case,
in 15 Edw. 4. and 14 El. Office found after the death of the tenant by the
curtefie, and 29 H. 8. Br. tit. Office devant Escheetr, 58. Dyer.
And if a commission be awarded, and the lury say, that d^ quo tenetur
ignorant, then a melius inquirend. shall go forth* but if they say, per quae
servicia ignorant, then nothing shall be done, but it shall be intended Knights
service, and so is the experience of the Exchequer. And here they have found
that more was behind, ergo, they have found that so much was behind, Quia omne
majus continet in se minus. Then if this be within the Statute of 18 H. 6. c.
16. And it seems that it is not; for that Statute as I think is but an
exposition of 8 H. 6. and that speaks of Leases by Treasurer and Chancellor,
and for that see the case of the Duke of Suffolk 3 and 4 Ph. and Mar. Dyer,
fol. 145. And so I think for all these causes judgment shall be given for the
Plaintiff. Peryam Justice to the contrary. For the first matter, I agree that
they be several rents for the viz. here does expound the matter, and when the
viz. may stand with the premises, Videlice^.
then it is good, and otherwise not, and for that the case in 17 lib. Ass.
which has been vouched, Difference between an annuity and a rent charge.
and disseisin of one is not disseisin of the other rent: And there is a plain
difference between an annuity and a rent service, because for an annuity it is
the book in 29 Edw. 3. fol. 51. and 29. lib. Ass. 3 Parceners, and rent
reserved for equality of partition, etc. vouched by Rodes; but if I grant you
xl s. out of my Manor, viz. x s. out of parcel in the tenure of A. and x s.
out of another parcel, Rent limited out of an entire manor.
this is void; for first there was a grant out of the entire Manor, 9 lib.
Ass. yet this is one lease, and but one reversion, and but one condition, and
the condition is entire, and that is well proved by the express words of the
condition (totaliter reentrare) and this proved by Winters case in 14 El. and
Rawlins case adjudged, Totaliter.
where the sum in gross was behind, Dyer.
the case vouched by Rodes, Cond. is undevidable.
33 Hen. 8. in a common persons case it cannot be divided, neither by title,
nor by the act of the party. If surrender be made of parcel, Surrender of
parcel.
the rent shall be apportioned, but the condition is utterly gone: Dyer.
But peradventure it will be objected* that in 17 Eliz. the condition there was
divided, where he aliened parcel with the consent of the Lessor, and the other
parcel without consent, and in that the Lessor entered for the condition
broken; Cond, ^pportioned.
I grant this case, and yet this does not prove that a condition may be
apportioned; for the reason in that case is, when he made such a condition, the
condition extended but to that which he aliened without license, and to no
more, and so I hold the Law where a lease is made of twenty Acres, with
condition, Eviction.
etc. and parcel is evicted. And warranty at the Common Law cannot be divided;
for if two Coparceners were who had warranty to detain, Garr^nty.
and they made partition, the one could not vouch without the other, V^u^her.
and therefore she should pray in aid, and then both to vouch Paramount, and so
the Statute which gives p^^tition between Joyntenants saves their warranty,
otherwise it were gone. And so if two Joyntenants make a lease for years,
reserving rent upon condition, Partition of a (...)
and after they make partition (as they well may, having the reversion and the
freehold in them) I hold the Law clearly, that the one nor the other shall
enter for the condition broken: Then in the case of the King, I hold the Law
that it shall not be apportioned; and yet I agree that the King shall have his
Pre^^gatives for his present lands and goods, Prerogative.
but he shall never have Prerogative when wrong shall be done to any man. Rent
charge app^rtioned.
If the King have a Rent chage, and after Purchase parcel of the Land charged,
it shall be apportioned, 21 Hen. 7. he may well condition that his Feoffee
shall not alien; for in those cases there is no prejudice to others, but all
those cases run upon other grounds. And in Bartlets case, the King is bound by
the Statute of donis conditionalibus, for it was a wrong that the Donee at the
Common Law should alien the inheritance. And this case as me seems is not
within the concourse of Title, C^^^^urse of ^itle.
as my Brother Rodes has argued, neither is the King deceived as has been
said. For when the King enters, he shall be seized in pristino statu suo, Dyer.
and this is a principal reason in Winters case; and 16 Eliz. a person makes a
Lease reserving Rent, upon condition, that if it be behind and lawfully
demanded, that then he shall re-en^er, De^and.
after the reversion comes to the King, he shall not ma^^ demand, I agree well
thereto; the reason is, because the demand is a thing which goes to the person
of the King. Then, Sir, the Statute is, that the King shall have it as the
Prior had it, which is meant of the estate and not of the person of the King:
Then, Sir, it is impossible that the King should have the land as the Prior had
it, ut in pristino statu suo, if he do not utterly defeat the grant made to
Cordall; then here the condition is gone, The Kings grant against the Law is
void.
but not by any grant as it has been moved, but by the operation of the Law:
And 49 Ed. 3. the King grants that lands shall be devisable, it is void,
because it is against the Law; and it is against the Law, that a condition
should be apportioned, ergo, the King shall not apportion it. But admit this
question against me, then let us see what title the Queen has by this
commission. First, the commission is to enquire if Cordall his Assigns and
Farmers have performed all covenants and provisoes contained in the Indenture;
Proviso.
as for that I hold the law clear that they have au^hority, by those words, to
enquire of the condition, but for other reasons I think the Commission void.
For the Commission is to enquire per bonos and legales homines de Com. nostre
M^dd. and it does not appear here that the Jurors were of Middlesex, and
therefore the inquisition is not good. Further, Several and spespecial finding.
they have found a thing in another County, and this they cannot find, but I
hold that the Jury in one County, may find the general issue in another
County. Also I hold that when the party cannot plead that which is the great
matter of the Action, they may find it in an another County because the party
cannot plead it, as in 9 Ed. 2. in debt against Executors, etc. And for these
reasons I hold judgment is to be given for the Defendant.

RIchard Heydon, Misre-cital in Letters, Patentt.
Gentleman, demands against Benjamin Ibgrave, Gentleman, the third part of 40.
Acres of Land with the appurtenances, in three parts to be divided, in Sarrot
in the County of Hartford, as his right and Inheritance, and to hold of our
Lady the Queen in Capite, and Lays the Esples in the time of Ed. the sixth,
and that such is his Right he offers himself, etc. And the aforesaid Benjamin
put himself upon the great Assise whether it be his right or no, etc. And now
the Assise made by the four Knights appeared at the Bar, Challenge.
Snagg Sergeant for the Plantif, we challenge A. B. for that, etc. Nelson chief
Prothonotary and all the Court, you cannot challenge, because it was made by
the four Knights, and the Assise is now at the Bar.

Snagg well Sir, then we will give evidence.


Anderson for whom are you?


Snagg for the Plantif.


Anderson then you shall not give evidence first, for the Tenant affirms that
he has more right, Evidence.
and that ought to be first proved.


Rodes and all the Court So it was here ruled five years ago in Nowells case,
and thereupon Puckering gave evidence for the Tenant, that it was Parcel of
the Manor of Sarrot, which Manor the Tenant has, and this was granted by the
Counsel of the Defendant. And in conclusion upon the evidence given, the*
Defendant would have had the Tenant* to have Demurred upon his evidence, and
discharge the Inquest, but the Tenant would not; in effect this was the doubt.
K. H. 8. by his Letters Patents, gave among other things, all the Lands which
were in the Tenure of one Whyton, and demised to Johnson in the Parish of
Watford. And it was true that the Lands were in the Tenure of Whyton, but not
demised to Johnson* Misre-citall.
and also they were not in the Parish of Watford; if this shall be helped by
the Statute of Misrecitall, and not Recital, is the question, and the party
did not aver that the intent of the King was to pass this Parcel now in
question to the Patentee, and the opinion of all the Court, was, that it is not
within the Statute clearly, but they said to the Jury, that they may find all
this matter if they will, or otherwise say what they will. And thereupon after
they were agreed, they came again to the Bar, and then all the Court told them,
that yet they might give a special Verdict. The Jury said we are all agreed
that the Tenant has more right to hold these Lands as he now holds, then the
Demandant as he demands them.


Anderson then are you discharged, and as I think you have done well.


So they gave their Verdict according to the opinion of the Court for the
Statute of Misrecitall, and yet Peryam was well content to have them give a
special Verdict, and the Demandant was demanded, who appeared, and thereupon
Judgment final was given for ever against him.

3.
ONe Tirrell brought an Action of Debt against a Hundred in Essex, H^e and Cry.
for that he was robbed and made hue and cry according to the Statute of
Winchester, the. Defendant pleaded that he was not robbed, and a full Jury
appeared at this day, and upon the giving of the evidence Shuttleworth moved
for the Defendant, that it appeared by the Plantifs own evidence that the money
was my Lady Riches, and that the Plantif was but her receiver, and then as he
thought the Action should have been brought by the Lady, and not by Tirrell.

Anderson in my opinion without question the Action is well brought, for when
he had the money, and was robbed; the money was taken from him, Receiver.
and he was her receiver, and Vouched a case in 3 Ed. 3. where a man takes my
Corn from me, and after, etc. the King shall have it, and so of money, for it
cannot be known from other money. Rodes to the same intent, for if my servant
be possessed of my goods, and be thereof robbed, Appeal.
he shall have an appeal.


Windham I have seen that a man sent his servant to London with money, and he
was robbed coming from thence, and the opinion of the Court was, that the
servant should have an Action against the Hundred.


Peryam So I think clearly,


whereby the Jury found for the Plantif.

4.
THe Quare impedit by Moor was moved again, and the opinion of the Court was,
Quare impedit.
that the Bishop, as well for his contempt in not retournig the first Writ, as
for his evil retourn made upon the second Writ (for it appeared that he which
he said was inducted of the presentation of the Queen, was Defendant in this
Action) should be amerced, and so he was amerced at x. l. and a new* Writ
awarded to admit the Clerk of Moor.

5.
AN Action upon the case was brought in the King Benchs for saying that the
Plantif was a forging knave, Slander.
and a Verdict given for Plaintiff. And it was spoken in arrest of Judgment,
Gaudy Justice inchit capiat per billam, for the Action is not maintenable.

6.
WAlmysley came to the Bar and showed how Lennard Cust^s b^evium, had brought
an Action of Trespass against another, the Defendant justified, by reason that
Sir Christo. Heydon was seized in Fee, and infeoffed him, Feoffment.
and gave a color to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff replied that Sir Christofer
Heydon died seized, and it descended to his Son, who enfeoffed the Plaintiff.
Absque hoc, that C. H. enfeoffed the Defendant. And the Jury found a special
Verdict, viz. That C. H. was seized and made a lease for years to the
Defendant, and afterward by his Deed containing dedi, concessi, and
confirmavi, gave it to the Defendant and his Heirs with Letters of Attorney to
make livery; if this were a Feoffment or but a confimation was the doubt.
Feoffment.


Walmysley It is but a confirmation when it is by deed and has words of
confimation.


Anderson Then by your reason, he in Reversion cannot enfeoffee his Lessee for
years by deed, as he may without deed, but I think the Lessee is at liberty to
take it as a Feoffment, or as a confirmation.


Walmysley Sir I think that when the Lessee takes the deed, immediately this is
a declaration of his meaning, to have it as a confirmation, by your favor.


Anderson And by your favor, when the Lessor shows his meaning, to make
livery, and the Lessee his meaning, to accept livery, and livery is made
accordingly, is not this an express declaration that he will take it by the
livery? and shall this livery be idle? no Sir, and see Bracebridges case in the
Commentaries, where Tenant in tail makes a bargain and sale, and makes livery,
and within six months Enrolls it, this is adjudged a discontinuance, and yet
the bargain and sale is not any discontinuance, and if you well mark the cases
you shall find but little difference* Disseisin.



Walmysley If Tenant in tail be disseised, and it is agreed between the
disseisor and the disseisie, that the disseisee shall make a Feoffment to the
disseisor, and make such a deed as this, the disseisor shall not have election
to take it as a Feoffment. Anderson and tota Curia, the cases differ, for
thedisseisee has not any power to make a Feoffment.


Walmysley Well, will you give us a day to argue this matter, and the other.


Feryam For the other if you will.


Walmysley No Sir, if this point be no hotter than the other.


Peryam The other is cold enough.


And so the Court held the Feoffment good clearly. And they laughed upon
Lennard, because he had profited so well by his action.

7.
LAnds were given by fine, to one Jones and his Wife, and to the Heirs of Jones
upon his Wife engendered, the Remainder to one Owen in Fee. Scire facias.
Afterward Jones only without his Wife suffers a Common Recovery with Voucher,
Recovery.
the Wife dies, Jones dies without Issue, and Owen brought a Scire facias to
execute this fine, and the Tenant pleaded the Recovery in Bar.

Snagg the Recovery is good to Bar Owen: For if there be a sufficient Tenant,
against whom the Praecipe is brought, then is it good. And as I think here the
Husband is a sufficient Tenant. The case in 16 Hen. 6. in a purchase to the
Husband and Wife, during the Coverture there are no Moities, and the case in 23
Hen. 8. Meuies.
Recovery against Husband and Wife where the Wife is Tenant in tail, and they
Vouch over, it shall be a Bar to the intail, vide Bro. titulo Recoverie in
value. 27. and yet the Husband had nothing but in right of his Wife, so in this
case.


Walmysley to the contrary. For if the recompense here does not go to the
Estate of him which brought the Scire facias, then it shall be no Bar, and in 9
Edw. 4. an Action was brought against two Executors, when there were four, and
a Recovery had against them two, the other shall falsify, for that they had
equal Authority, Falsifying of recovery per executors.
and here the Husband and Wife have equal Authority, and 10 Ed. 4. the Wife
shall have an Assise, if a Recovery be had only against the Husband, and 2 Ed.
4. he in Reversion prayed to be received, Resceit per def. de un Joint.
he shall plead that the Tenant held jointly with another, and the reason is,
if he should be received only upon the default of one of them, then he cannot
have his recompense over Paramount, Grant de reversion de un Joint.
and 18 Hen. 6. 1. and 13 Edw. 3. Husband and Wife Ioyntenants for life, and he
in Reversion will grant the Reversion of the Husband only, this is void, for he
has not any such Reversion. And here the Estate of Husband and Wife and he in
Remainder is all but one, and then the Estate of the Husband only, is not the
same Estate, and the case in 23 Hen 8. vouched by Snagg, seems to make for
me, for the reason wherefore he shall be barred is, because the recompense
goes according to the Estate which the Wife had, and then it is reason that he
shall be barred, but in the same case, if the Husband survive, it is said in
the same Book, that the Issue shall be at large, for that the recompense goes
to the Survivor, but let it be as it may be, the reason of the case is for the
recompense. And I think, Com. 5. 14.
that this case here will be proved by Snowes case in the Commentaries*
Recovery had against Husband and Wife, where the Wife had nothing, all the
recompense shall be to the Husband. 10 Edw. 3. Dower brought against husband
and wife, Dower:
and the husband vouch to warranty, etc. and 38 Ed. 3. Praecipe against Tenant
in tail, and 8 Eliz. in Dyer, fol. 252. where the husband was tenant for life,
the remainder to the wife in tail, the remainder in fee to a stranger, and a
recovery suffered; and about 15 El. was a case in the Exchequer, where lands
were given to Norrice and his wife, and to the heirs of the body of Norrice,
Remainder.
the remainder in fee to a stranger, and a recovery suffered against Norrice,
he in remainder was attainted, and Norrice and his wife were dead before, and
by the opinion of Sanders then chief Baron, Recompenses.
the moity shall be forfeit by the atteynder: And recompenses are but as
exchanges; Exchange executed.
and Bracton calls them Excambia; and I think if an exchange be executed in
the one part, and not in the other, it is not good, and so I think the recovery
shall be no bar.


8.
IN a Writ of Dower brought, Jointure.
Gaudy Sergeant showed how that the husband of the demandant had given certain
lands to her in lieu of her Jointure, upon condition that she should make her
election with in three months after his death, and she made her election to
have the Jointure, and now she had brought her Writ of Dower against the heir
by covin, Covin.
and he has confessed the Action, to the intent that Thynne who had a lease
for years of the first husband should lose his term, and prayed aid of the
Court.

Fleetwood for the demandant There is not any such Jointure as you speak of;
for that which was given to the wife was but a lease for years, and that (you
know) cannot bar her of her Dower.


Rodes Justice* If the case be so, then is there no cause to bar her of her
Dower; for a lease for years cannot be a Jointure. Ease for years.



Quod Peryam concessit clearly, and said that the Jointure ought to be a
freehold at the least, or otherwise it is no bar to the Dower, whereby Gaudy
moved another matter.

De Term. Mic. An. Reg. Eliz. xxviij. and xxix.

AN Action upon the case was brought for calling the Plaintiff false perjured
Knave; Jeofayle.
the Defendant justified, because the Plaintiff had sworn in the Exchequer that
the Defendant had refused to pay the Subside, where in truth he had notso done.
The Plaintiff replied, de injuri^ sua propria absque tali causa, the Action was
brought in London, and there it was tried for the Plaintiff, and great damage
found; and this matter was alleged in Arrest of Judgment because the trial
was in London, whereas the Perjury was supposed to be made in the Exchequer:
Trial local.
The Court said, that the matter is tryable in both Counties; and it was
answered again, London cannot join.
that London cannot join with any other County.

Anderson Then is your Issue vicious; for when an Issue is tryable by two
Counties, if they cannot join, then ought you to make such an Issue as may be
tried by one only. And by all the Court, this ought to have been tried in
Middlesex, for there the Perjury is supposed to be committed, whereupon the
Issue is taken.


Peryam to the Sergeant of the Plaintiff See if you be not aided by the Statute
of Jeofayles.


Walmisley It has been always taken, that if the trial be evil, it is not
aided by the Statute of Jeofayles.


Peryam Then are ye without remedy; for you shall have no judgment.


Et sic fuit opinio Curiae.

2.
Gaudy came to the Bar, Joyntenancy.
and showed how a man devised his lands to his two Sons, Partition.
and their heirs, and they had made partition by word without writing: 18 Eliz.
350.
Tota Cur^a, What question is there in it? the partition is naught without
doubt.

Rodes It has been adjudged here, that if the partition be of an estate of
inheritance, it is not good by paroll. Joyntenant by devise.



Gaudy But I think that when a man devises his lands to his eldest Son, and
his youngest Son, in my opinion they are Tenants in common, because the eldest
son shall take it by descent.


Peryam But I think not so; for if a man make a gift in tail to his eldest son,
Devise in tail of an heir.
the remainder in fee, etc. Is not he in by the devise?


Gaudy This is another case.


Peryam In my case he shall take by the devise for the benefit of the issues,
and in your case he shall it take by the devise for the benefit of the
survivor, and therefore I think that they are Joyntenants.


Anderson There is but small doubt but that they shall be Joyntenants; and
there is authority for the case:


And this at length was the opinion of the whole Court.

3.
IN an Action of Debt for Rent, Apportionment.
it was said by Anderson, If a man make a lease of years reserving rent, and
the Lessee for years make a feoffment in fee of parcel of the land, the rent
shall be apportioned.

4.
FEnner came to the Bar, Alien.
and said to Anderson, that in his absence he had moved this case. An Alien
born purchases Lands, and before office found, the Queen by her Letters
Patents makes him a denison, and confirms his estate, the question is, who
shall have the lands?

Anderson The question is, if the Queen shall have the lands of an Alien before
office found?


Fenner True, it is, my Lord.


Anderson I think they are not in the Queen before office, and then the
confirmation is good.


Rodes It seems that he shall take it only to the use of the Queen, Neis
purchase lands.
and then the confirmation is void.


Fenner In 33 lib. Ass. is this case; If the Neise of the King purchase lands,
and takes a husband who hath^ issue by her, and she dye, he shall be tenant by
the courtesy.


Anderson and all the Court denied that case of the Neise.

Fenner I have heard lately in the Exchequer, that an English man and an alien
purchased lands jointly, Joint purchase by an alien.
and the alien dyed, it was adjudged that the other should have all by
surviving.


Anderson, and all the Court Surely this cannot be Law; for it is a maxim,
Nullum tempus occurrit Regi.


Peryam If the Freehold be in the Alien until office found, Trespass.
if a trespass be committed, who shall punish it? for he shall have no Action.


Fenner That is true; and so it is of a Monk if he be a disseisor, Monk.
and yet the freehold is in him.


Shuttelworth And so it is of a person atteinted, Atteynted person.
and yet before office found the freehold is not in the Queen.


Rodes It is, Dyer 11 Eliz. fol. 283. Feoffment to use.
If a man enfeoffee an Alien and a Denison to his use, that the Queen shall
have the moity, whereby it seems that the confirment is void.


Anderson I hold this rule for certain, that in every feoffment there is
feoffer and feoffee; and if there be a feoffee, he must of necessity take, where
by I think the confirmation is good.


Rodes Is this case hanging in this Court.


Fenner No, Sir.


Windham Wherefore then do you move it in this Court?


And afterward the question being demanded of Shuttelworth by diverse
Barristers, he made answer; Truly in my opinion it is not in the Queen before
office found, and therefore I think the confirmation is good. Quaere.

5.
AN Attorney of the Common Pleas brought an action of debt against another,
Misdemeaner.
whereupon he was arrested in the Country, and when he came to London, the
Attorney caused him to be arrested in London for the same debt, and this was
showed to the Court, and the Attorney called, to whom Anderson said, if a man
be sued here for a debt, and after be arrested in another Court for the same
debt, the penalty is fine and imprisonment, and that is both the law and the
custom of this Court, wherefore then have you done this? surely we will send
you to the Fleet for your labor.

Attorney I beseech you, my Lord, consider my estate.


Anderson I have well considered it, and that is, that you shall go to the
Fleet, and therefore Warden of the Fleet take him to you.


Windham We will punish such gross faults in you more severely than in others,
because you are an Attorney here, and your fault is so much the greater, by how
much you are skilful in the law and customs of this Court, wherefore you shall
go to the Fleet.


De Term. Mic. Anno xxix. Eliz.
1.
IN the case of Sellenger, Annuity.
it was said by Anderson, and agreed by the Court, that if a man grant an
Annuity out of Land, and has nothing in the Land, that yet this shall be good
to charge the Grantor in a Writ of Annuity; and in the same case it was also
agreed by the Court, that if a man grant an Annuity to a Woman, who takes a
Husband, and after Arrerages do incur, and the Wife dye, so that the Annuity is
determined, that the Husband shall have an Action of debt for the Arrerages, by
the Common Law.

Shuttleworth This is not remedied by the Statute of Arrerages of Rents, and
then at the Common Law it is but a thing in Action.


Peryam An Annuity is more than a thing in Action.


Windham He may grant it over, and so the opinion of the whole Court was, that
debt was maintenable.


2.
AT the same day it was said by Anderson, Executor.
and not gainsaid, that if an Executor plead ne unque administer come executor,
yet afterward he may take the Administration upon him, and well enough be
Executor.

3.
IN a Replevin by Bosse against Hawtrey, Trial by provise.
they were at Issne, Termino Mic. An. 28. and 29. And Bosse had a venire facias
in Termino Mic. retournable in Termino Hill. and after in Termino Hill. took an
alias retournable in Termino Pasch. and so awarded it in the Roll of Mic. to
the intent that the matter should not be tried at the Assizes in Kent, and
thereupon Hawtrey which was Avowant, moved the Court and prayed expedition,
whereupon the Court caused the Roll to be brought in, and notwithstanding that
it was a Roll of Mic. Term, yet because it was awarded the same Term, they
mended the Roll, and awarded the alias retournable the same Term of Hill.

4.
WYlgus brought an Action of Trespass against Welche quare clausum fregit.
Travers.
Welche said, Trin. 28. Eliz. rot. 537.
that I. W. was seized and enfeoffed May, and so conveyed a title to himself,
the Plantif replied that A. his Auncestor was seized, and so the Land descended
to him, Absque hoc that I. W. was seized, and upon this Issue the Court was
moved.

Anderson the seisin is not traversable, but where it is material, and
therefore clearly the Traverse is not good;


but Fenner cited a book in 2* Edw. 6. that the Travers shall be good, but he
stood not much upon it. Snagg 27 Hen. 8. 4. Bro. pleadings 1. is contrary, but
the opinion of all the Court clearly was that the Travers is not good.

5.
A Man makes a Feoffment in Fee to the use of himself and his Wife, VVast.
and alterius eorum diutius viventis absque impeticione vasti durantibus vitis
ipsorum, the Husband dies, if the Wife shall hold without impeachment of wast
or no was moved by the Sergeants. And the opinion of all the Court was, that
she shall not be impeached of Wast, because of the severance, but otherwise if
it had been Jointly.

6.
FUlwood brought an action upon the case against Fulwood, Action upon (...)
case.
and declared that whereas a motion of marriage was between the Defendant and a
Widow in London, in consideration that the Plaintiff should give his assent,
that the Father of those Fulwoods should convey to the Defendant all his Lands
and Chattells, the Defendant promised to pay the Plaintiff such a sum of money
as their Father should assign* Ac licet that the Plaintiff had given his
consent, and that their said Father had assigned him to pay 37. l. yet the
Defendant, etc. and he pleaded non assumpsit, and it was found for the
Plaintiff, and now Fenner spoke in arrest of Judgment for four causes. assensum
suum daret, so that he is at liberty to give his assent or no: and so no ac
licet the Plaintiff, etc. and in facto that he gave his assent. The third is,
that he does not say that he gave his assent when the Father had those Lands
and

Shuttleworth To the contrary, we have alleged in deed, that he gave his
assent, and that is as much as if he had said in consideration that he gave his
assent. And allthough that the conveyance be to both, yet it is in tail to
them, and so the inheritance given to both. And therefore that which you allege
is against you.


And the Wife of the Defendant being in Court was very importunate, whereupon
the Court moved an agreement, and the Plaintiff was content upon condition that
the Defendant would enter into bond, but the Defendant seemed unwilling by his
silence.

Anderson We have made stay to the intent to do the Defendant good, and he
will not be content when more than reason is offered him, wherefore let
Judgment be entered for the Plaintiff.


7.
IN a replevin by Gybson against Platlesse, Revocation of a Will.
the Defendant made Conusance as Baylif to Anne Wingfield, and the Issue was
whether the Land descended to Anne Wingfield, Norfolk Trin.
as Daughter and Heir to I. W. and upon evidence this was the case. 28 Eliz.
rot. 2^30.
The said I. W. was seized of the Lands in question, and diverse other Lands,
and by his last Will devised all his Lands and Tenements to Anthony Wingfield
of London Goldsmith in Fee; and after and before his death, he made a Feoffment
in Fee of the same Lands which he had devised to the same A. W. and when he
sealed the Feoffment he demanded, will not this hurt my Will, and it was
answered again that it would not, and he said, if this will not hurt my Will, I
will seal it, and then he sealed it, and a Letter of Attorney to make livery,
and in some of the Lands the Attorney made livery, but not of the Lands now in
question, and after the Testator died, now if the Devisee shall have the Lands
or no, was the question; for if this Feoffment be Revocation of the Will, then
the Devise is void. And it was said by the Counsel of Anne VVingfield, that it
is a Revocation. For if the Testator had said that this shall not be his Will,
then it had been a plain Revocation, quod fuit concessum per Curiam, and then
the making of the Feoffment is as much to say, as that the Will shall not
stand: but it was answered by the Court, that it appeared that the mind of the
Testator was, that his Will should stand, and when he made the Feoffment this
was a Revocation in Law, and if no Feoffment had been made, there had been no
Revocation in Law, and there is no Revocation in deed, for he said if this will
not hurt my Will, I will seal it, and allthough that the Attorney made livery
in part, Feof^ent perfect in part.
so that the Feoffment was perfect in part, yet for the Lands in question,
whereof no livery was made, the Will shall stand, Will.
for a Will may be effectual for Part, and for Part it may be revoked, and the
Court told the Jury that this was their opinion, and thereupon the Jury found
accordingly, that the Land did not descend to A. VV. quod nota. And Fenner who
was of Counsel with the Plaintiff, before the coming again of the Jury to the
Bar, said to the Counsel of the Defendant, that the Law was clear against
them. Also he said to diverse Barresters afterward privately, that in the case
of Sergeant Jeofres it was adjudged, that where one had made his Will, and
after one of his friends came unto him, and demanded of the Testator if he had
made his Will, and he answered no. And he demanded again, will you make your
Will, and he answered no, and yet this was adjudged no Revocation.

8.
ONe Lea of Essex, Privelege.
was sued in an Action of Battery in the Common pleas, Battery.
and upon non culp. pleaded, it appeared upon the evidence, that the Defendant
and others had thrown daggers at the Plaintiff, and grievously hurt and maimed
him in outrageous manner, and Peryam said to the Jury that they ought to
consider, that the Plaintiff was put in fear of his life, and had one of his
hands maimed, and what damage he had sustained by his Mayhem, and that they
ought to give damage as well for the fear and assault as for the Mayhem, and
when the Jury was gone from the Bar, the Defendant caused the Plaintiff to be
arrested in the Kings Bench, for a battery done to him by the Plaintiff before,
and this was showed to the Court, and thereupon they sent for Lea, and were
grievosly offended with him, for they said that when a man is sued here,
Privelege de Court.
he ought safely to come and go by the privilege of this place without vexation
elsewhere. And Lea pleaded that he was ignorant of the Law, but the Court
answered that ignorantia juris non excusat, and therefore they said that they
would punish him, and discharge the other. Then the Plaintiff said that he had
put in bayl to the arrest, and the Court answered, if you had not done so we
would have discharged you, but now we cannot, but they commanded Lea to release
his arrest, or otherwise he should smart for it, Fine.
and Lea was well content to do so.

Anderson yet you shall pay a fine here also, for otherwise we shall be
perjured, wherefore because you are ignorant, you shall be fined at vj. s. and
Lea paid the vj. s. incontinently, and went for to release his arrest.


Rodes You have escaped well, therefore let this be a warning.


9.
BEtween Smyth and Lane the case was such. Copyhold Mith. 27. and 28. Eliz.
Rot. 1858. Radford.
A. was a Copyholder in Fee according to the custom of a Manor, whereof the
Queen was Lady. And she by her Letters Patents let the Copy hold to B. for
years, and he granted his Term to the Copyholder, if by this the Copyhold be
determined or no was the doubt. And it was agreed by the Court and all the
Sergeants, 28 H. 8. 30. b.
that if the Lease had been made immediately from the Queen to the Copyholder,
then it had been a plain determination, but some put a diversity because the
Patentee was not Lord of the Manor,

Peryam I think the Copyhold is not gone, for when the Copyholder has an
interest in possession, and the other in the Freehold, and the Patentee grants
his interest to the Copyholder, what surrender can this be?


Anderson I will not have it a surrender, but I will have his interest to be
determined. For when he is a Copyholder, this is by Custom, and when the Land
is left, this is by the Common Law, and when this is granted to the Copyholder,
surely he shall not have both. For he cannot have a Copyhold in the Land, and
have the Land also, wherefore in my opinion the Copyhold is gone.


Peryam Peradventure by the grant to the Patentee the Rent shall pass if there
be any, but it shall be hard to make it a determination of the Copyhold, for
they are two distinct and two several interests.


Anderson By the grant made to the Patentee the Rent shall not pass, for he
has no Reversion.


and adjornatur.

A Quare impedit was brought by Specot and his wife against the Bishop of
Exeter, Pasch. 28 El. rot. 2091.
and declared how A. F. was seized of the Manner to which the Advowson is
appendant, and presented, and devised the Manor to his wife now one of the
Plaintifs, and she after took to husband Specot, and then the Church became
void, and they presented their* Clerk, and the Bishop disturbed them. The
Bishop pleaded that he claims nothing but as Ordinary, and that the Church is
with cure of souls, and confesses the title of the Plaintiff: And that they
presented, but he alleged in bar, that he examined their Clerk, and upon the
examination, Invenit eum fore schismaticum inveteratum, so that by the Law of
holy Church he could not admit him. Whereupon the Plaintiff demurred in Law.

Shuttelworth The Plaintiff ought to recover. Certainty.
First, I agree, that if it had been alleged in certain wherein he had been a
Schismatic, this had been a sufficient plea to excuse him, but as this is, it
is otherwise. For a Schismatic is he which divides and separates himself from
the Religion and the Faith established. Schismatic.
But this plea is insufficient for the uncertainty, and therefore in 38 H. 3.
fol. 2. Fitzh. Quare imped. 124. The Earl of Arundell brought a Quare impedit,
and the other said, that he presented one to him who was perjured for certain
causes, Perjury.
and showed for what, whereby he was not a person capable, and so it should be
in this case; and in 12 Eliz. Dyer fol. 293. he ought to set down the
disability of the Clerk, Notice of disability certain.
and give notice to the Patron. And also in Dyer 9 Eliz. fol. 254. the Bishop
refused the Clerk because he was a haunter of Taverns and unlawful* Games,
Tavern and gaming.
etc. Et ob^ea and diversa alia criminafuit criminosus and inhabilis, etc. And
there the Plea was thought not good, Evil in it self.
because that the faults alleged were not evil in their own nature, Evil
forbidden.
but by the prohibition of the Law. And also the Plea was naught, because he
had not showed what the other faults were. And the reason wherefore the
Ordinary ought certainly to allege what faults the Presentee has, is, because
the Patron may present another unto him, who is not infected with the same
faults, and how can the Patron tell that his Clerk is disabled for such a
fault, when he does not know certainly what the fault is? Then if the Plea of
the Ordinary be insufficient, whether he shall be a disturber by his evil
Plea, Disturber by evil pleading. Trial.
and it seems that he shall; for so is the Book in 14 Hen. 7. fol. 21 b. and.
5. Hen. 7. 20.* Also for another reason the Plea is not good, for it is too
general for the trial; and all though that it may be said that it shall not be
tried by a Jury, but by the Metropolitan, as perchance it shall be, yet it is
too general; for how can he know wherein he is a Schismatic, Ravishment of a
Ward.
so that he may examine him thereof? as in Ravishment of Ward, supposing that
the Infant holds of him by Knights service, 12 H. 8. f. 6. a. f. 11.
it must be showed in certain by what service: And also in the case of Winbish
the Plea was not good, because he did not show in certain how she was heir to
the other; Coment. f. 42. b.
and so I think the Plaintiff ought to recover.


Walmisley to the contrary: And it seems the Plaintiff shall be barred; First,
when a Parson is presented to the Bishop it appears fully that the examination
of him appertains fully to the Bishop, Examination.
as it is expressed in the Statute De Articulis Clers, de ideoneitate personae
present at ae ad beneficium Ecclesiasticum pertinet examinatio ad judicem
ecclesiasticum, and ita hactenus usitatum est, and fiat in futurum. For the
cure of the Parson is the cure of the Ordinary, as it is expressed in 32 Hen.
6. He shall say to him, Accipe curam tuam, and curam meam. Then if we shall be
driven to show wherein he is a Schismatic, and I think not; for the Book of 38
Ed. 3. fol. 2. which is vouched against me, is with me; Perjury.
for there he showed before what Judge he was perjured, which is very
necessary; for if it be not before a Judge it is no perjury; but there he did
not show wherein he was perjured: Also he said, that in 12 Eliz. in the Bishop
of Norwich's case, the opinion of Walsh, Manners, Learning, difference.
that those things which touch the manners of the Clerk, shall be tried by the
Temporal Court, but that which touches the learning or sufficiency of the
Clerk, shall be tried by the Spiritual Court. And in vain it shall be to
allege wherein he is a Schismatic; for this Court cannot judge of it, in proof
whereof he cited the Statute of 2 Hen. 8. Schism.
And he defined a Schism to be Recens dissentio congregationis jure aliquo, but
an Heretic is he which has a habit therein, Heretic.
and is invetorate; so he concluded, that Schismaticus inveteratus est
Haereticus, and Haereticus est Schismaticus inveteratus; and he defined
inveteratus to be, qui est multi and veteris usus in malitia. And if the Bishop
had said that he was an Heretic, he should not need to show wherein, and for
that he cited the case in 9 Edw. 4. 24. Bro. Deposition 5. Deposition.
Where a Deposition of A. was pleaded, there he ought to show before what
Judges he was deposed, but not wherein. And what is the reason that he must
show before what Judge it was? Surely, because this Court may know to what
Court to write; and also the case in 11 Hen. 7. fol. 8. Bro. 9. of the Union
of Wamborough, where it is pleaded, that concurrentibus hiis, etc. and also he
cited 8 Ed. 4. 24. where a divorce was pleaded, causa consanguinitatis prout
patet in recordo, and yet well: And also he cited the opinions of Fitzherbert
and Shelley, 27 Hen. 8. 14. that an Action upon the case does not lie at the
Common Law, Heretic.
for calling one Heretic, because the Judges at the Common Law cannot discuss
it, and he granted the cases put by Shuttelworth, Matter issuable.
that where the matter is issuable, there it ought to be certain, but not as
this case is where it shall not be tried by a Jury; And that which has been
said, that the Archbishop cannot examine him, because he knows not wherein he
was a Schismatic; this is not so, for the Bishop which accuses him may inform
the Archbishop, so that he may be well advised thereof, and so I think judgment
shall be given against the Plaintiff.


Anderson I doubt if the Writ be well brought in the name of the Husband and
Wife: Advowson in right of the wife.
For if the Husband have an Advowson in right of his Wife, and the Church
become void, and the Husband dye, the Executors shall have the presentation;


and the Sergeant said that there be many Books in that point.

Anderson I know it well, but I doubt of the Law in the case. Also I would
have you to argue if this be within the Statute of Demurrers, in 27 Eliz. For
if this be not matter of substance, then it shall go hard with the Plaintiff;
therefore let it be argued again another time.


11.
ONe Brook was Plaintiff in a Replevin, Copyhold.
the Case was such: Tho. Speek was seized of a Manor, in which were Copyholds
according to the Custom, and the place in which the taking was supposed, was a
Copyhold; and the said Tho. Speek being so seized, took to wife one Anne B. and
died seized, after whose death the said A. in the time of King Edw. 6. demanded
the third part of the Manor for her Dower, by the name of Cent. Messuagiorum,
Cent. Gardinorum, tot acr. terrae, tot acr. prati, etc. and was endowed
accordingly of parcel of the Demesns, and parcel of the services of the
Copyholds, and after she granted a Copyhold, and if this be good was the
question; for if she had a Manor the Grant was good, and otherwise not. And
the opinion of all the Court clearly was against the Grant; for when she
demanded her Dower, she was at liberty to demand the third part of the Manor,
or the third part of Cent. Mes. Cent. Guard. Cent. acr. etc. and when she
demanded it per nomen Cent. Mes. etc. Manor a corporation.
she could have no Manor: For a Manor cannot be claimed except by his name of
Corporation, as Anderson termed it, and not otherwise; and then Cent. Mes. and
Cent. acr. etc. cannot be said a Manor; and then the Grant of a Copyhold by
her which had no Manor was utterly void; and this was the opinion of the Court
clearly. Quod not a.

12.
SHuttelworth showed how one Knight was Plaintiff in a Replevin, Visne. (...)
Ass. pl. 42.
and they were at issue upon a prescription for Common in Newton appendant to
land in another place, and the venue was of Newton only, and it was found for
the Plaintiff, and he prayed his judgment, for the trial may be in the one
place as well as in the other, as in annuity where the seisin is alleged in one
County, Annuity.
and the Church in another, it may be tried in any of the Counties.

Anderson But we think otherwise, for it ought to be of both places, when the
matter arises in both; and if they had been in several Counties, Counties
join.
the Counties ought to have joined.


Shuttelworth So is 10 Ed. 4. fol. 10. But our case being after a verdict, I
think we ought to have judgment.


Anderson and Windham The verdictdoth not amend the matter, if it be mis-tried,
as this case is. Rodes agreed that it was a mis-triall, Mis-trial.
and therefore evil, and that mis-trialls are not helped by the Statute of
Jeofayles.


Shuttelworth I agree to that, if you say that the trial is not good.


Windham So we say. New Venire facias.



Then Shuttelworth advised his Client to take a new Venire facias.

13.
WAkefield brought a Replevin against Costard, The Lord.
who avowed for damage fesaunt. Comptons case.
and the Plaintiff prescribed for Common, that all the inhabitants of Dale,
except the Parson and infants, and such a house, Prescription for Common.
have used to have Common in the place. The Avowant said that the house
whereunto the Plaintiff claimed Common, was built within thirty years last
past, and if he may have Common to this new house by prescription or no was
demurred in judgment in Michaelmas Term, and then Shuttelworth argued for the
Plaintiff that he should have his Common by prescription, but not of common
right. And Gaudy argued for the Avowant, that the Plaintiff shall not have
Common, because the prescription is against all reason, that he should have
Common time out of mind to that which is but of thirty years continuance: And
also he excepteth the Parson, and infants, and such a house, and by the same
reason he may except all, which is not good. Then one of the Judges said that
if this be good, Ancient inhabitants.
hereafter there shall be no Common for the ancient inhabitants. Improvement.


Peryam By such a prescription he shall for ever bar the Lord from improving
any Common, Common entire,
which is no reason.


Anderson All Common is entire; for if a man have Common to three Mesuages, and
he infeoffee one man of one Mesuage, and another of the second, and another of
the third, the Common is gone. And by this reason also the new house cannot
have Common. And now this Term Gaudy demanded of the Court if they were
resolved in the point.


Anderson* We are all agreed that the prescription is utter^y void; for it is
impossible to have Common time out of mind for a house which was built within
thirty years, and then he commanded to enter judgment, if nothing were said
to the contrary by the next day.


Shuttelworth We have said all that we can say, my Lord.


Anderson Then let judgment be entered against the Plaintiff.


14.
SNagg showed how the Earl of ^Kent had brought an action of debt against a
Londoner for rent behind, Grant.
and showed how the Countes^* of Derby was tenant in Dower of this land, and
took to husband the Earl of Kent, and that Henry Earl of Derby had granted it
to the Earl of Kent habendum after the death of the Countess for certain
years, and he showed how the grant was made by the name of a reversion also,
Lease in reversion, Grant in reversion, difference.
and that the Tenant had attorned, and alleged the death of the Countess. And
the Court said that the Attornment is not necessary, for it is but a lease in
reversion, and then no rent passes thereby.

Anderson If you had been privy to the case of Talboys in the King's Bench, you
would not have moved this doubt.


Peryam It is also the very case of Throckmorton in the Commentaries.


Snagge But here in my case he has granted it by the name of the reversion
also, and then the reversion will carry the rent.


Curia Then is your grant void; for a man cannot grant his reversion, habend.
after the death of another; and therefore, quacunque via data, you shall have
no rent.


And thereupon Snagge conticuit cum rubore.

15.
MOunsay was Plaintiff in debt upon an obligation against Hylyard, Jeofayle.
and the Defendant pleaded the Statute of Usury, because it was made for the
sale of certain Copperas, and he took more than was limited by the Statute, and
that it was made by shift and chevisance, and other matter he alleged to prove
it within the Statute; the Plaintiff replied, that it was made upon good
consideration, and traversed the delivery of the Copperas, which was an evil
issue clearly, Issue mis^oyned.
and it was found for the Plaintiff, and this was alleged in arrest of
judgment, and yet for that there was an issue tried, allthough it was
mis-joyned, the exception was disallowed, and judgment was given for the
Plaintiff.

16.
AN Action of Debt was brought upon the Statute of Purveyors, Issue.
because he had cut down Trees against the form of the Statute of 5 Eliz. The
Defendant pleaded not guilty, and it was moved that this was an evil issue;
for he ought to have pleaded nil debet; and the Court commanded him to plead
nil debet.

17.
WAlmisley showed how the Lord Anderson is Plaintiff in an Action of Trespass
against Wild, Aid prier.
who was Tenant for life, and they were at issue, and the Venire fac. issued in
Michaelmas Term, and now this Term the Defendant prayed in aid, which he said
he ought not to do, be^^use they have furceased their time; for they ought to
pray it when the Venire facias is awarded, or otherwise they shall not have it;
and he cited for that purpose 15 Edw. 3. And the Court was of the same opinion,
that he ought then to pray it, or not at all.

18.
A Writ of Error was brought upon a judgment given in London, ^orfeiture.
and this was the case; Sir Wolstan Dicksey Alderman, brought an Action of Debt
in London against Alderman Spenser for rent behind upon a Lease for years made
to Spenser by one Bacchus, who afterward granted the reversion to Dicksey, and
the Tenant attorned, and the rent was behind, etc. Spenser pleaded in bar, that
before the grant of the reversion to Dicksey, Bacchus was seized, and showed
the custom of London, to make inrolments of deeds indented, and then showed
that before the bargain to Dicksey, he bargained the reversion to him by
paroll, and so demanded judgment, si actio, etc. and this plea was entered
upon record, and hanging this suit, Dicksey entered into the Land for a
forefeiture of the term, because he had claimed a Fee simple, and Spenser
re-entered with force, and his servant with him, but not with force, and
thereupon Dicksey brought an Assisse of fres^ force against them in London, and
all this matter was there pleaded, and adjudged that it was a forfeiture of the
term, and the Jury gave damages, and the Court increased them, and the
judgment trebled as well the damages increased as the others, and also the
Judgment was quod praedicti defendentes capiantur, etc. Increase of damages.
and thereupon Spenser brought a Writ of Error, and assigned Error in the point
of the Judgment, because it was no forfeyture. And also because the Damages
increased by the Court were trebled. And also because the judgment was
Capiantur where but one was a Disseisor with force, and therefore it should be
Capiatur.

Shuttleworth There is no forfeyture made by this Plea before trial had
thereof. Wast.
For if in Wast the Defendant say that the Plaintiff has granted over his
Estate to another, this is no forfeyture, so in Cleres case, if he say that
another is next Heir, this is no forfeyture. Quid juris clam.
And in 26 Eliz. here was a case in a quod jur^s clamat, the Defendant pleaded
an Estate tail, and after at the Assizes, he confessed but an Estate for Life,
and yet this was no forfeiture.


Curia None of us do rememember any such case here.


Walmisley Surely the case is so, and I can show you the names of the parties.


Anderson I will not believe you before my self, and I am sure that I never
heard of any such case.


Peryam If any such case had been here we would have made a doubt thereof, for
there are Authorities against it, as in 8 Eliz. and 6. R. 2. Plesingtons case.


Shuttleworth Also theyhave said that the fresh force was brought infra
quarentenam, silicit quadraginta septimanas, Quarentenae. Scilicet a surplusage.
and the quarentena is but 40 days.


Curia That is no matter, for the silicet is but surplusage, and so no cause of
Error.


Shuttleworth If a man disseise another without force, he shall not be taken
and imprisoned, and therefore for this cause the Judgment is erroneous, and
also the costs increased are trebled, and therefore erroneous, Aydin Trespass.
and cited 22. Hen. 6. 57.


Anderson In an Action of Trespass, If the Defendant pray aid of a stranger,
this is a forfeiture, and if it be counterpleaded, yet it is a forfeiture, then
shall the denial thereof make any change in the case? surely no, Proper acts.
in my opion. And I say that Acts which come from himself are forfeitures,
Collateral.
but Collateral Acts, Difference,
as in the case of Wast are not.


Walmisley In 22 Ed. 3. 13. the Tenant said that the Grantor has released unto
him, the Judgment shall be but that he shall Attourn. And also he cited 3 Ed.
3. and 33 Ed. 3. and 18 Ed. 3. and 36 Hen. 6. and 34 Hen. 6. fol 24. to prove
that it shall not be a forfeiture before trial. Quid juris clamat.



Anderson If one who has no Reversion, bring a quid juris clamat against
Tenant for life, this is a forfeiture of his Estate, and as you have said, if
in VVast the Tenant plead the Feoffment of the Plaintiff, or non dimisit, true
it is that these are no forfeitures, for you know well enough that a Feoffment
is no Plea, and then it is void, and to say non dimisit is no forfeiture.


Peryam The Judgment given in Plesingtons case is not well given, for it ought
to have been, quod pro seisina sequatur si volunt. as in the case of Saunders
against Freeman, and he cited 10 Edw. 3. fol. 32. to that intent.


Wyndam The doubt which I conceive is for that he pleads a custom in London for
the inrollment of Deeds indented, and he shows that his bargain was by parol,
and therefore void, and then no forfeiture, as if in Trespass a man prays aid,
as by the Lease of I. S. and in the conclusion prays aid of I. N. this is
void. Praying in aid.



Anderson Allthough that it be so, yet the pleading is, that he bargained the
Reversion, and then this is good by parol in London, therefore there is no
doubt in that point.


Walmisley The Books in 15 Ed. 2. and 25 Ed. 3. Import^ that Judgment ought to
be given before any forfeiture can be. Forfeiture before Judgment.



Curia Without doubt he may take advantage thereof before Judgment, as well as
after, if the plea be entered upon record.


Wyndam For the point of capiantur, the Book is in 2. lib. Ass. Pl. 8. Br.
imprison. 30. and in 9. lib. Ass. and 12. lib. Ass. Pl. 33 Br. imprison. 40.


Anderson Two may be Disseisors, Present Disseisor, absent, Differance.
and the one with force and the other not, as if I command one to make a
Disseisin, and he makes a disseisin with force, and also if one enter with
force to my use, and after I agree, he is a Disseisor with force and I am not
so, and those cases will answer the Books of Assizes, for in those cases they
were present, Present*
but in these not, and so I hold that he which is present when force is made,
is a Disseisor with force.


Then it was moved if the Statute of 8 Hen. 6. does extend to fresh forces.

VVyndam It does extend to them by express words,


and Fleetwood cited a case in 44 Edw. 3. 32. that an Attaint lies of fresh
force. Then for the other matter of trebling of damages increased, the Court
made no doubt but that they shall be trebled, and they said that so it was
lately adjudged here in a case of Staffordshire.

19.
PUckering showed how an Attaint was brought upon a false Oath made in a
Replevin, Challenge.
where the Defendant made Conusance as Bayley to one Hussy, and in the Attaint
surmise was made that the Sherif was Cosen to Hussy, and thereupon prayed
Process to the Coroners, and Puckering moved that no Process should issue to
the Coroners, for Hussy was not party to the Attaint, and then this is but
matter of favor, and he cited 3 Hen. 7. And all the Court accorded with him,
that it is but matter of favor only, and no surmise to have a Writ to the
Coroners, but VValmisley would have put a difference between Lessee for years
and a Bayley, Lessee pur ans.
for as he pretended, in the case of a Bayley, it shall be a principal
challenge, but not in the other case; but all the Court was against him, and
that it is no principal challenge in the one case nor in the other. The last
day of the Term it was moved again, and the Court was of the same mind as
before.

20.
IN a Quare impedit, Adverson.
it was said by Anderson, and agreed by all the Court, that if a man make a
Feoffment in Fee of a Manor without deed, and without saying (with the
appurtenances) yet the Advowson shall pass, and cited 15 Hen. 7. where it is
adjudged that it is parcel of the Manor, and lies in Tenure.

21.
IN an Action of debt Anderson cited a case which was before him at the Assizes
in Somersetshire, Pleading.
an Action of Battery was brought in London, and a Justification made in
Somersetshire, Absque hoc that he was guilty in London, and the Plaintiff
replied de injuria sua propriae absque tali causa, and Anderson said that a man
shall never plead, de son tort. demeasne: where the matter arises in a Foreign
Country.

22.
AN ejectione firm was brought by Clayton against Lawson, Bar.
the Defendant pleaded in Bar, a Recovery had in the Kings Bench against the
Lessor of the Plaintiff. And Fenner moved that it should be no Bar no more than
in Trespass.

Anderson I think it to be a good Bar. For this Action is as strong to bind the
possession, as a Writ of right is to bind the right.


VVyndam I think it is no Bar no more than in Trespass.


Anderson This is more than an Action of Trespass, for in this he shall recover
his Term.


Rodes This case was moved the last Term, and the opinion of the Court then
was, that it was a good Bar.


Fenner True it is, if it were between the parties themselves; but here the
Plaintiff is but Lessee to him which was Barred.


Anderson Allthough that it be so, yet he claymeth by the Lease of him which
was Barred, and during the Lease of the other his Lessor could have no right,
and what shall he have then?


Fenner That which is between the parties cannot be an* Estoppell to the
Plaintiff here which is but a stranger. Estoppell.



Anderson I know that he shall not plead it by way of Estoppell, but he shall
conclude Judgment si Actio,


Peryam If in an Assise a Recovery in another Assise be pleaded in Bar, Assise.
he shall not conclude by way of Estoppell* but Judgment si Actio, and there
he is driven to a higher Action, and so here; and the Law shall never have end,
if after a man is Barred in his Action, he may bring the same Action again,
therefore I think it a good Bar, and that he is driven to a higher Action.


VVyndam Lessee for years can have no higher Action.


Anderson and Peryam If one which has a Lease for years and no more, Tenant
for years disseisor of tenant in Fee simple.
enter upon him which has a good title, he is a disseisor of all the Feesimple.


Wyndam If two claim by Lease from one man, and one brings an Ejectione
Firm, and is Barred, what Action shall he have then?


Anderson None, for he has no Right.


VVyndam That is hard.


Anderson What Action shall he have which is Barred in Formdone? surely none.


Fenner This is another case.


Anderson Aliquantulum incensus, truly it is a plain case that he shall be
Bared, whereunto Peryam and Rodes agreed clearly.


23.
IN a praecipe quod reddat, View.
the Tenant demanded the view, and an habere facias visum issued, and the
Tenant came not to the Sherif to take the view, it was said by the whole Court,
that the Sherif may ret^urn, that none came to take the view, and he shall
never have the view again.

Anderson The habere fac. visum is the suit of the Tenant, and then when he
does not come to take the view, this is a default, and then good reason to
exclude him from the view.


Gaudy Such a retourn was never seen before, and therefore it is to be noted,
the case was between Ho^ and Hoo for Lands in Norfolk.


24.
John Wise Man of the Inner Temple, Apportionment.
brought an Action of debt against Thomas VVallenger, the case was this. A man
seized of three acres of Land in Fee, makes a lease, reserving xxx. s. of Rent,
and after devised the Reversion of two acres to a stranger, and the third acre
descended to the Heir, and he brought an Action of debt for xij. d. being
behind, and Puckering moved if they were agreed of their judgment in the case.
Rent extinct by the grant of part of the Reversion.


Anderson If a man let two Acres of Land rendering Rent, and grant the Reversion
of one of them, all the Rent is gone, as it is in Dyer, and at the Common Law,
before the Statute of W. 3. there was no apportionment, and the Statute
speaks of no such apportionment as this is.


Rodes Surely no Book in all the Law will warrant this apportionment.


Fenner Yes Sir, 5 Ed. 3. If a man have a Rent of xx. s. and grants parcel
thereof, and the Tenant Attourns, this is good.


Rodes This is another case. But show us the case which was in the Kings Bench
against the next Term.


and adjornatur, but the Plaintiff said then to diverse Barresters that such a
case was adjudged with him in the Kings Bench. Pasch xxviij. Eliz. Rot. 341.
between* Wiseman and Brewer, and another case in the Common place, London,
Rogers versus Hunt, Pasch. 16 Eliz. Rot. 1544.

25.
A Quare impedit was brought by Beverley against Cornwall, Vtlary.
which was the Presentee of the Queen, and the Plaintiff had Judgment to
recover, and now the Queens Sergeant showed that the Plaintiff is outlawed, and
prayed that he Writ to the Bishop might be stayed, and that they may have a
scire facias for the Queen, to show wherefore she shall not have Execution of
this Judgment.

Walmysley This cannot be debated now, for the Plaintiff has no day in Court,
after Judgment, and this is but a surmise.


Curia The Record here before us testifies that he is outlawed.


VValmysley Yet it is but their surmise that he is the same person.


VVyndam In debt upon an Oblig: If the Plantif be outlawed, the Queens
Sergeants may pray the debt for the Queen; and yet this is but a surmise. And
the opinion of three Justices was (for Anderson was absent) that they ought to
stay Execution, but how* Process shall be awarded, or if a Scire sacias shall
issue against the Plaintiff or no, they would be advised for the course thereof,
but Peryam thought that they might have a Scire facias against the ancient
Incumbent.


4.
A Quare impedit was brought by Gerard, Travers.
and declared that his Ancestor was seized of the Manor, to which the Advowson
is appendent, and presented, and died seized, and the Manor descended to him,
and so he ought to present, the Defendant pleaded in Bar, that the Ancestor of
the Plaintiff was joint ly seized with his Wife, and that she survived, and for
default of her Presentation the Lapse accrued to the Bishop, who did collate.
Absque hoc that he died sole seized, and it was moved by Gaudy that the
Traverse shall be naught, for he ^ad sufficiently answered to him before. And
the opinion of the Court (Anderson being absent) was that the Traverse is void,
because he had confessed and avowed him before, and cited 5 Hen. 7. 11. 12.
Bro. tit. Traverse sans ceo 13.

27.
BYngham brought an Action of debt upon an Obligation against Doctor Squire,
Cond. impossible.
and the Condition was, that if the Defendant did obtein a good grant of the
next avoydance of the. Archdeaconry of Stafford, so that the Plaintiff might
enjoy it, that then, etc. and the Defendant pleaded that he had obtained a good
grant of the next avoydance, and in truth so he had, but the ancient Incumbent
was created a Bishop, whereby it perteined to the Queen to Present, so that the
Plaintiff could not enjoy it, and therefore the Plaintiff moved the Court that
the Defendant should amend his plea, and the Court (Anderson absente) commanded
him to do so, for it seemed unto them that the Obligation was forfeit. Gaudy
moved for the Defendant that when the Archdeacon was made a Bishop, the
avoidance perteined to the Queen by her Prerogative, so that it was become
impossible, but nevertheless he took day to amend his Plea.

De Term. Pasch. Anno Eliz. xxix.
1.
THE First day of this Easter Term, Sir Christopher Hatton, Knight, late
Vicechamberleyn to the Queen, and Captain of the Guard, rode from his house in
Holborn, the Lord Burghley Lord Treasurer being on his right hand, and the Earl
of Leicester on his left hand, and the Gentlemen Students of the Inner Temple
attending upon him, (because he was one of the same House) and with great Honor
he was brought to Westminster Hall, and there in the Chancery sworn Lord
Chancellor of England, according to the Patent and Seal delivered unto him the
Sunday before.

2.
THe Queen brought a Quare impedit against the Incumbent and the Bishop,
Abatement.
the Bishop pleaded that he claimed nothing but as Ordinary, and thereupon
Judgment Formal was given against him, The incumbent dies.
sed cesset executio, etc. the Incumbent pleaded in bar, whereupon they were at
issue, and this issue depending, the Incumbent died, and now Gaudy moved if the
Writ should abate against the Bishop or no? and VVyndam and Peryam clearly that
it shall abate; but if the Plaintiff had averred the Ordinary to be a disturber,
then Judgment should have been executed; but now he claiming nothing but as
Ordinary, and thereupon Judgment given, which is but conditional upon the
Plea of the Incumbent, it seems that the Writ shall abate, for there is none
now to plead against the Queen; But if the Bishop had been averred to be a
disturber, Patron.
then it had been othe^wise, and Peryam resembled it to the case of 9 Hen. 6.
where it is brought against the Patron and the Incumbent, and the Patron dies,
or the Incumbent, the Writ shall not abate against the other. But they
commanded him to move it again, when the Lord Anderson was present.

3.
EJectione Firm was brought by King against King and others, Surrender.
who pleaded not guilty, and now the Jury appeared, and the Plaintiff declared
upon the Lease of one West. Gaudy for the Defendant showed that before the said
Lease, West had made a Lease for six years, so that during that time this
Lease could not be good: the Counsel of the Plaintiff confessed the said Lease
for six years, but said further that it was surrendered. VVyndam demanded where
that surrender was made, and it was answered in London, and the Land lay in
Essex. Was the surrender (said VVyndam) made in London, Out of possession.
and he out of possession, and the Land in Essex? What surrender call you this?
And the Justices laughed at this evidence, and so did the Sergeants for the
Defendant, concluding that it was not good without question. And so the
Plaintiff was Nonsuite, and the Jury discharged incontinently.

4.
SHuttleworth showed how Hurleston was Plaintiff in an Ejectione Firm, Trave^s.
and declared upon the Lease of one Pinchine, to which the Defendant said, that
before P. had any thing etc. one E. Roberts was seized in Fee in right of Faith
his Wife, and so being seized, made a Lease to the said P. If the said E. R. so
long should live, whereby P. being possessed, made a Lease to the Plaintiff, and
showed that the said Roberts was dead, and the Defendant as servant to the said
Faith entered and Ejected him, now he demanded what he should Tra^erse in this
Plea.

VVyndam This is a shifting Plea.


Peryam Is this Plea true?


Shuttleworth No Sir.


Peryam Then you may trice him upon this Plea, for you may Traverse the seisin
in the right of his Wife without doubt, or you may Traverse any other part
thereof,


and VVyndam and Rodes agreed clearly thereunto for the seisin (Anderson
absente)

5.
AN Action of the case was brought upon an Assumpsit, Jeofayl.
the Defendant pleaded non* Assumpsit, and the issue was found for the
Plaintiff, and now Gaudy spoke i^ arrest of Judgment, because the Plaintiff had
alleged no place of the Assumpsion, No Place of the assumpsion.
and he said that when an Issue is mis-tried, it has been adjudged here that
it is not helped by the Statute, and here is no place alleged, whereupon the
Trial may be.

Peryam The opinion of many has been, that the Statute shall be taken most
strictly, but in my opinion it shall be taken most liberally, so that if a
verdict be once given, it shall be a great cause that shall hinder judgment,
wherefore allthough no place be shown, yet when it is tried and found, it
seems, that he ought to have judgment; and so was the opinion of the Court,
Anderson absente.


6.
AN Action upon the case was brought in Staffordshire by Whorwood against
Gybbons, Consideration.
how in an account between them, the Defendant was found in Arrerages, and in
consideration that the Plaintiff differreret deem solutionis debiti praedicti
per parvum tempus, the Defendant did assume to pay it, and upon Non assumpsit
pleaded, it was found with the Plaintiff, and it was alleged in arrest of
judgment, that this was no consideration. And the opinion of the whole Court
(Absente Anderson) was, that insomuch as the Proviso was made by him by whom
the debt was due, that it is a good consideration, and that it is a common
course in Actions upon the case against him by whom the debt is due, to declare
without any words in consideratione. And allthough that Gaudy moved that parvum
tempus may be three or four hours, or days, which is no consideration, yet for
the cause alleged, the Court said that they saw no cause to stay judgment.

7.
AN Action upon the case was brought for these words, Scandal.
Thou do harbor and maintain Rebels and Traitors; and the issue was found
for the Plaintiff, and the judgment was entered by the Pregnotary; yet
notwithstanding Walmisley moved the Court to have regard unto it, for the
Action was not maintainable; for if a man ke^p Thieves, and do not know them to
be Thieves, he is in no fault, and an Action for these words will not lie, and
the Plaintiff has not averred that the Defendant said that the Plaintiff knew
them to be Traitors.

Peryam The Action in the King's Bench was, that the Plaintiff kept Thieves; and
there if there be no such averment, the Action is not maintainable, Maintain.
but here is the word Maintain, and that word implies a thing prohibited, and
therefore not sufferable, and therefore I think the Action is maintainable, and
by the opinion of Windham, Peryam, and Rodes the Action was well brought
(Anderson absente propter agritudinem.)


8.
AN Action upon the case was brought by Richard Body against A. Consideration.
and declared that whereas Kary Raleigh was indebted to Body in 14l. and the
said A. was indebted to Raleigh in 50l. in consideration that the said K. R.
allocavit eidem A. 14l. and promisit ei ad exonerandum e^ndem A. de 14l.
parcel praedict. 50l. the Defendant did assume to pay to the said Plaintiff the
said 14l. and the Court was moved if this were a good consideration to bind the
Defendant, And the opinion of all the Court (Anderson absente) was, that the
Consideration was good, for that he was discharged of so much against Raleigh,
and Raleigh might also plead payment of the 14l. by the hands of the Defendant.

9
AN Action of Assault and Battery was brought, Assault.
and the Defendant was condemned by nihil dicit, and a Writ to enquire of
damages went forth, and then the Attorney of the Plaintiff died, and another
Attorney without Warrant prayed the second Judgment and Execution, Warrant.
if this shall be error or no it was moved by Fenner; And the Court gave their
opinion that if in an action after Judgment the Attorney dye, a new Attorney
may pray Execution without Warrant, but in this case because that he died
before the second Judgment, it seems that he ought to have a Warrant of
Attorney, for the first Judgment is no final Judgment. And the Pregnotaries
said, that if after the first Judgment one of the parties had died, the Writ
should abate, quod fuit concessum per curiam. And also Fenner moved that this
shall not be within the intent of the Statute of Jeofayles which speaks of
Verdic^^, Verdict.
for this shall not be said a Verdict; whereto the Court agreed, for a Verdict
is that which is put in issue by the joining of the parties.

10
A Woman brought an action, Covenant.
and she Covenanteth that she shall not do any act, to repeal, to discontinue,
to be nonsuit, or countermand this action, and hanging the Writ, she takes a
husband, whereby the Writ abateth. Now Fenner moved if she had broken the
Covenant.

VVindam If one be bound that he shall not attorn and he make an Attornment in
Law, Attornment.
the Obligation is forfeit without question. Assignment.



Rodes. If I be bound not to make in Assig^ment of such a thing, and I devise
it by my will, this is a forfeiture, as it is in 31. H. 8.


Fenner there is a case in Long 5. E. 4. If one be bound to appear at the
Sessions, etc. and. I am to make a plea in this case, and I would know your
opinions.


Windham You may plead according to the truth of your cause, for that shall
not change the Law, therefore plead what you list.


11.
DEbt was brought upon an Obligation, Condition.
the Condition was to perform Articles contained in an Indenture, and one
Article was, that the Defendant Sir William Drury should plead the general
Issue, or a^issuable Plea, or such a Plea in quo staret aut persisteret, within
seven days next ensuing. The Defendant said that he pleaded such a Plea, and
showed what, and averred that it was sufficient, and issuable within seven
days. The Plaintiff demanded judgment if to this Plea he shall be received,
for he appeared in Michaelmas Term, in which he ought to have pleaded, and took
imperlance over unto Hill. Term, And Fenner showed, that in truth an issuable
Plea was pleaded, and drawn in paper in Mich. Term, and the Plaintiff replied,
and the Defendant rejoyned, and the Plaintiff surrejoyned, and the^ by ass^^t in
Hill* Term all this was waved, and an imperlance of the other Term entered
forfear of a discontinuance; and now he would have the Obligation of five
hundred pound forfeited by this. And the opinion of the Court (Anderson
absente) was, that the Obligation (...) was forfeit, for the Plea ought to have
been entered of Record^^ (...) be bound in an Obligation to appear here at a
certain day, Appearance entered.
allthough he do appear at the same day, yet if his appearance be not entered
upon Record, his Obligation is forfeit.

Peryam If the Plaintiff deny that he did not plead a sufficient Plea, this
shall be trued by the Record, and how can that be, when it is not entered of
Record* But the Court said further, that it was hard that he should have the
forfeiture; and said that there was great negligence, and oversight in the
matter.


Peryam You may plead all this matter specially, and how by his assent the Plea
was waved, and peradventure his assent (if any thing) will help you.


12.
PArtition was brought between Coparceners, Estrepment.
and hanging the Writ the Tenant made Wast, and Gaudy moved the Court for a
Writ of Estrepment.

Peryam] Where you are to disprove the interest of the Tenant, Estrepment will
lie, but here you confess an equal interest in him, how then can you have it?


Whereunto Windham agreed; and after it was shown how they were Tenants in
common, whereby his motion was at an end.

13.
NOte that in the Starchamber this. Perjury.
Term it was over-^uled by the Lords, that if in an Action at the Common Law, a
man wage his Law, allthough that he make a false Oath, yet he shall not
therefore be impeached by Bill in the Starchamber; and the reason was, because
it is as strong as a Trial. And the Lord Chancellor demanded of the Judges, if
he were discharged of the debt by waging of his Law, and they answered, yea.
But (...) said, that it was the folly of the Plaintiff, because that he may
(...) his Action into an Action of the case upon an Assumpsit, wh^^ in (...)
Defendant cannot wage his Law.

14.
AT another day in the Starchamber between Hurlestom and Glaseour, Conspiracy.
it was overruled by the Lords, that if a Jury at the Common Law give their
verdict, Perjury,
allthough that they make a false Oath, yet they shall not therefore be
impeached by Bill in the Starchamber: But if any collateral corruption be
alleged in them, as that they took Money, or Bribes, a Bill shall lie thereof
well enough. And also in the same case it was ruled, that where Glaseour had
brought a Bill of Conspirary against Harlestone, and others, and diverse of the*
Jury, for that they had indicted him of Perjury, that before the Indictment be
traversed, or otherwise avoided by Error, he cannot have a Bill of Conspiracy,
because this shall quash the trial at the* Common Law, and shall prevent it.
And also before a man be acquitted, a Writ of Conspiracy does not lie for him
by the Law.

De Term. Trinitat. Anno xxix. Eliz. Reg.
1.
THe Quare impedit brought by Specot and his Wife was moved again by Gaudy,
Quare imp.
and it seemed to him, that because the Bishop did not show in what thing he
was a Schismatic, the Plea was therefore uncertain, and so insufficient, and
he cited 33 Edw. 3. 2. and 9 Eliz. Dyer 254 b.

Anderson If he had certainly showed in what thing he was Schismaticus
inveteratus ut ea occasion inidoneus sit and inhabilis, etc. This had been a
good Plea without doubt, but as it is here, sure it is no Plea; for it is even
as if he had said, that he was criminosus,


whereunto all the other Judges agreed.

Anderson All that I doubt is, whether this be helped by the Statute of
Demurrers 27 Eliz. For otherwise the Plea is insufficient without doubt.


Gaudy The Statute helps only matters of form, and this is the substance of
his Plea, that he is a Schismatic.


Anderson Allthough it be the substance of his Plea, yet it is but form to
plead it certainly. And if one demur generally to a double Plea, Double plea.
it is not good at this day, and so here.


And so was the opinion of Peryam, and the other Justices by their silence
seemed to agree thereunto, yet they gave day to the Sergeants to argue this
matter. And Peryam said that he would help the Plaintiff in the best sort that
the Law would suffer him; for the Bishops are grown so presumptuous at this
day, that they will make question of all the patronages in the Realm, and if it
be against their pleasure, none shall have his Presentation. And also now
Anderson was agreed that the Action was well brought in the name of the Husband
and Wife, allthough he had once moved to the contrary. Also in this case it
was moved, Demurrer is a confession but of things sufficiently alleged.
that by the Demurrer it shall be confessed, that the Plaintiff Clerk was a
Schismatic: Whereunto Anderson said, that if a thing be sufficiently alleged,
it is confessed by the Demurrer, but otherwise not.

2.
A Replevin was brought by Broad against Hendy, Replevin. of his own wrong.
the Defendant made Conusance as Baylif to the Queen for Rent behind, whereunto
the Plaintiff said, De son tort demeasne sans tiel cause, and the Court was
moved whether this be a good Plea, and by the opinion of three Judges it is no
Plea in a Replevin (Anderson absente) but in Trespass it is good,
notwithstanding that it was objected at the Bar, that there is a diversity in
our books taken, that when the Action is brought against the Baylif, there it
shall be a good Plea, but not against the Master. But the Court overruled it;
for in a Replevin he ought to make a title.

3.
THe Queen brought a Quare impedit against the Bishop and Themas Leigh
Incumbent, Discontinuance.
and they both pleaded severally special Plea^, and so it depended, whereupon
Fenner showed the Court that the Queen did not prosecute the Suit, but let it
depend still, and therefore he prayed that she might be called Nonsuit: But all
the Court, The Queen cannot be Nonsuit.
and the Pregnotaries said, that the Queen cannot be Nonsuit.

Fenner Shall we then which are Defendants always be delayed?


Peryam After a year passed you may have it discontinued, but she shall not be
Nonsuit. And in the case of a common person the Plaintiff may discontinue it
within a year, but the* Defendant cannot discontinue it until after a year.


4.
WAlmisley moved for Judgment in the case of Kimpton. Common extinct by
purchase.


Rodes We have given Judgment already.


Walmisley No, Sir, I have not heard of it:


Peryam What is the case?


Rodes The case is this; a man was seized of a 140 acres of land, and had
Common appurtenant to them in 46 acres of land, and the 46 acres of land were
in the occupation of several men, viz. two in the occupation of A. and the
rest in the occupation of B. and he which had Common purchased the said two
acres, now if this entire Common be extinct or no, so that they which were
Tenants of the residue of the 46. acres shall take advantage thereby was the
question. And all the Justices said that they were agreed of this case long
ago. For allthough that the acres be several, and in several occupations,
yet the Common concerning that is entire, and so by purchase of parcel it is
extinct.


Rodes Surely I have noted my book that Judgment is given, and so I supposed
that it had been.


5.
SHuttelworth moved that whether a Lease is made to a man o^ his own Land by
Deed indented, Estopple.
this is an Estopple, whereto the Court agreed. But Windham and Peryam said,
if the Lease be made for life by Indenture, Liv^ry.
that yet this shall be no Estopple, because the Lease takes effect by the
Livery, and not by the Deed; but Rodes did not fully assent to that; Anderson
was absent in the Sta^^ chamber.

6.
DEbt was brought by Lassels upon an Obligation, Hill. 1^ Eliz. tot. 1 511.
with condition, that if the Defendant did personally appear in the King's Bench
such day, Stat. 23* Hen. 6
that then etc. the Defendant pleaded the Statute of 23 H. 6. and said that he
was taken by the Plaintiff being Sherif then, by force of a Latitat, and that
the Bond was not made according to the Statute: For being made for his
deliverance, this word (personally) was inserted in the condition more than is
in the Statute. And it seemed by three Justices (Anderson absente) that if it
were in such an Action where a man may appear by Attorney, that then it shall
be void; but now the question is whether the party ought to appear in proper
person by force of a Latitat or no; And some said yea, and some said no. And
the Plaintiff showed a Judgment given in the Kings bench for Sackford against
Cut. where Cut. was taken by a Latitat, and made such an Obligation as this
is for his deliverance, Sackford being Ballivus sanct. Etheldred^e in Suff. and
adjudged for the Plaintiff that the Obligation was good. And this was in the
King's Bench, Mic. 27 and 28 Eliz. Rot. 575. but Peryam doubted of that
judgment; for peradventure he might appear by Attorney; Ideo quare; for that
was the reason of the judgment given in the King's Bench, as it was said,
because he could not appear but in proper person.

7.
AN Action of Trover was brought for Goods, Jeofayle.
and the Defendant pleaded a bargain and sale in open Market, thereupon they
were at issue, and found for the Plaintiff; and now the Defendant spoke in
arrest of judgment, because the Plaintiff had showed no place of conversion; No
place of conversion.
yet notwithstanding by the opinion of the Court the Plaintiff shall have his
judgment by the Statute.

Peryam If in Debt upon an Obligation he do not show the place, 36 El. rot.
266.
yet if the Defendant plead a collateral bar, as a release, or such like,
judgment shall be given for the Plaintiff notwithstanding, by the Statute, if
it be found for him by Verdict.


8.
THe case of Beverley was moved again at this day, Utlary.
how the Queen had brought a Scire facias against him, to show wherefore she
should not have the Presentation.

Walmisley It seems that she shall not have the Presentation; for allthough
we have recovered our Presentation, Disseiser outlawed.
yet before execution we have but a right. As if a man be disseised, and after
outlawed, he shall not forfeit the profits of the land. And also she has
brought a Scire facias, and this will not lie, except for him which is party,
or privy.


Peryam After that you have recovered, it is a chattle, and then forfeited by
the Utlary.


Anderson The judgment that he shall recover, does not remove the Incumbent,
and as long as he remains Incumbent, the Plaintiff has nothing but a right.


Then Peryam said to Walmisley, argue to that point, whether he has but a
right or no, but for the other point, that she shall not have a Scire facias,
for want of privity, that is no reason, Recoverer in debt outlawed.
for in many cases, she shall have a Scire facias upon a Record between
strangers.

Anderson If I recover in debt, and after am Outlawed, Recovery in quare
impedit.
shall the Queen have this debt?


Windham If I recover in a Quare impedit, and dye, who shall have the
presentation, my Executor or my Heir?


Sed nemo respondit.

Curia It is a new, and a rare case, and therefore it is good to be advised:


VValmisley Whatshall we in the mean time plead in bar to the Scire facias?


Curia Demur in Law if you hold the matter insufficient.


VValmisley Sow will.


9.
ONe Combford was robbed within the Hundred of* Offlay in Staffordshire, Hue
and Cry.
and he and his servant pursued the Felons into another County, and there one
of the Felons was taken, and the Hundreds did nothing. And now Puckering moved
that he might have an Action against the Hundred, Plaintiff a Hundreder.
allthough that he himself was resiant within the same Hundred; Hue and Cry by
strangers.
but the opinion of the Court was against him; for they said that if a stranger
make Hue and Cry, so that the Felons be taken, the Hundreds are discharged.
Another question he moved, because that but one of the Felons was taken. Qua^re.
But qu^re what was said to that; for I heard not.

10.
FRancis Ashpool brought an Action against the Hundred of Evenger in Hampshire,
Hue and Cry.
for that he was robbed there. And the Jury found a special Verdict, viz. that
he was robbed after the setting of the Sun, and per diurnam lucem, and that
afterward the same night he came to Andever, which is in another Hundred, and
there gave notice of the robbery, and the morning following, the men of Andever
came into the Hundred of Evenger, and there made Hue and cry about ten a clock
in the morning, and that there were many Towns nearer to the place where he was
robbed than Andever was, and also within the same Hundred of Evenger, and that
the Melafacters escaped, Robbery after Sunset.
the first was, if he which is robbed after the Sunset, shall have the benefit
of the Statute, and the other was, if he had made Hue and cry
or whether any Hue and cry be needful. And Walmisley argued that he which is
robbed after the Sunset, shall be helped by the Statute, for they are bound to
keep watches in their Towns to take night-walkers. And to the second he said,
that the Statute does not speak of any Hue and cry, but only recens insecutio,
and that ought to be done by the Hundreders.

Shuttleworth to the contrary; No distcess.



and that it ought to be in the day, and cited Stamf. fol. 35. and after the
Sunset it cannot be said to be day. For the Lord cannot then distreyn for his
Rent per 11 Hen. 7. 4. nor demand Rent, for he is not bound to be there after
the Sunset, and he vouched Fitz. titulo core. 302. but at this time the Judges
seemed to hold for the Plaintiff.

Anderson The Countries are bound by the Statute to keep their Country in such
sort, so that men may safely travel upon their way.


So that at this time the Court held that he should be aided by the Statute,
and also that no Hue and cry was necessary or convenient to be made by the
party, but they were not resolved, and therefore they gave a day to have it
argued again.

11.
AN Action upon the case was brought for these words, Normans case.
thou would have stolen a piece of cloth, or else thou would have
delivered it to my Wifes Daughter, and thou art a thief and an arrant thief,
and I will prove it, and upon not guilty pleaded, it was found for the
Plaintiff. And the Defendant spoke in arrest of Judgment, because the former
words proved but only an Intent, Words.
which was no Flony, and the last words shall be referred thereunto, and
therefore the Action not maintenable. But now Shuttleworth moved for Judgment
for the Plaintiff, because the last words are sufficient by themselves, and
shall not be referred to the former, because they were spoken absolutely by
themselves, and so was the opinion of three Justices (Anderson absente)

Rodes Otherwise it is if the words had been, Therefore.
and therefore thou art a thief.


12.
Samuel Hayles brought an Action of debt upon an Obligation, the Condition
was, that if the Defendant did pay to the Plaintiff 40. l. within twenty days
after the retourn of one Russell into England from the City of Venice in the
parts beyond the Seas, that then, etc. and the Defendant pleaded in Bar, that
Russell was not at the City of Venice, whereupon the Plaintiff demurred in Law,
and at this day the Record was read and clearly per 3. Justices (Anderson
absente) it is no good Plea. For in such cases, where parcel is to be done
within the Realm, and parcel without the Realm, they ought to plead such a
Plea as is triable in this Realm, and therefore they commanded the Sergeant to
move for Judgment when Anderson was present, and so he did the last day of the
Term, and Judgment was given for the Plaintiff by all the Court.

13.
IN Trespass by Moor against Hills, Attornment
the Defendant pleaded that the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, made a Lease
t^ one Pain, who, made Leases out of it, first to A. for certain years rendering
Rentand after the end of that Lease, then to B. rendering Rent; and afterward
sold all the entire interest to the Defendant, to whom the second Lessee (which
had no possession) Attorned; Possession.
And the Plaintiff moved that he might plead a better Attornment, for this is
not good, because it is no Attornment. And so was the opinion of the Court, and
therefore they gave him day to amend his Plea, or else let a Demurrer be entered.

14.
Upon a wager of Law, Payment by estranger.
it was said by Anderson, that if I am bound to you to pay you a certain sum of
money, and a stranger deliver you a Horse by my assent, for the same debt, this
is no satisfaction. So if I be indebted upon a simple contract, and a stranger
make an Obligation for this debt, the Debtor cannot wage his Law, for this does
not determine the Contract. Et nullut dedixit.

15.
BEtween Pierce and Davy this was the case. Legacy.
A man covenants with I. S. to pay to A. B. and C. every of them x. l. at the
age of twenty four years, and makes an Obligation to perform the Covenant; And
afterward makes his Will in this sort. Item, I will that every one of my Wifes
Children, viz. A. B. and C. shall have every of them x. l. at their several
ages of 21 years, in performance of my Bond and Covenant, in that behalf made
at the time of my Marriage, and not otherwise, and dies. Then A. B. and C. sued
in the spirittuall Court, Prohibition.
for these Legacies, and Pierce brought a Prohibition, and they prayed a
consultation, and the Court seemed to incline to their demand, because they
were all strangers to the Covenant, but yet they would not absolutely grant it;
And afterward in Termino Pasch. 30. it was moved again, and then the Court
doubted, because it was not given as a Legacy, allthough that it was payable
before, for that it was given in performance of the Covenant, and not
otherwise, and Anderson and Rodes said precisely that a consultation should not
be granted, sed alii haesitabant. But yet they all thought it good reason and
conscience that it should be paid, wherefore they compounded the matter, and
gave day to Pierce to pay the money, and 2 pound 8 pence, to them which had
sued in the Spiritual Court for their costs. The same Testator also devised
diverse sums of money to his Wife, to pay to the said A. B. and C. in
performance of his Covenant, who had the money accordingly. And in debt brought
upon the Obligation for the same Covenant the Executor pleaded plene administr*
(...).
and upon the Evidence all this matter appeared, and the opinion of the Court
in the Exchequor was, that it shall be assetz. and so adjudged there.

16.
BUrnell of Shrewsbery was robbed in Buckinghamshire, Hue and cry.
and thereupon he brought his Action against the Hundred, who pleaded not
guilty, and the Jury found a special Verdict, viz. that he was robed the day
and year specified in the Declaration, but in another place within an other
Parish than he had alleged, but they found also that both the Parishes were
within the same Hundred, and thereupon they prayed the advice of the Court. And
three Justices (Anderson being in the Starchamber) held clearly that the
Plaintiff shall have Judgment, and they said, that so was the opinion of my
Lord Anderson also, for it is not material within what Parish he is robbed,
so that it be within the same Hundred.

17.
RIchard Hamington Administr. of the goods and Chattels of Isabell Oram brought
an Action of debt against James Richards and Mary his Wife, Future charge by
possibility.
Administraterix of the goods and Chattells of Laurence Kydwelly, upon a bond
for performance of covenants, and the case was such. Tenant for 31 one years
devises to his Wife as long as she shall be sole and Widow, the occupation and
Profits of his Term, and after her Widowhood expired all the Lease and interest
to Reignold his Son, and dies, and the Wife has the Term by force of the
Devise, and he in the Reversion by Indenture bearing date. quinto December. An.
Mari^^ primo, did give and grant, bargain, and sell, all that his Tenement to
the Wife and to her Heirs for ever. And also did covenant to make further
assurance, and that at the making thereof, it should be discharged of all
former Bargains, Sales, Titles, Rights, Joyntures, A Feoffment. to her and
after also.
Dowers, Morgages, Statutes Merch. Statutes Staple, intrusions, Forfeitures,
Condemnations, Executions, Arrerages of Rents, and all other charges, (except
Rents and Services which shall be due after, etc. to the chief Lord) And
afterward he made and levied a fine; And after the Wife married, and then the
Son entered, and the Administrator of the Wife brought debt upon the Obligation
against the Administrators of him in Reversion, and averred that the Land at
the time of the Feoffment was charged with the said Lease of 31 years.

Walmisley It seems that Judgment shall be given for the Plaintiff, because
it was not discharged at the time of the Feoffment. For in the Commentaries a
man Devises his Term to his Wife until his Son come to full age, Com. fo. 539.
after at his full age the Son shall have it, so that there it was chargable to
the Entry of the Son hereafter. And here allthough that it be not presently
charged, yet when there is a charge arise, the Covenant is broken. And for that
in 8 Eliz. a man bargains and sells Land, Rent charge future.
and Covenants that it shall be discharged of all charges, and he had granted a
Rent before to begin twenty years after, when the Rent begins it shall be said
a breach. And this is not like the case in 3 Hen. 7. 12. b. Where Tenant in
Tail disseiseth the Tenant of the Land* etc. And so I think Judgment shall be
given for the Plaintiff.


Fenner to the contrary,


and here the Term was extinct by the grant end sale, and then the Feoffment
void, and therefore no charge, and thereupon no charge at the time of the
Feoffment, and for that he cited 42 Ed. 3. and 11 Hen. 7. 20. where Tenant in
Dower infeoffs the Heir without deed, etc. so here, in that she took nothing by
the Feoffment, there was no charge at the time of the Feoffment. And this
possibility of a remainder does not make an interest, and thereupon he cited 8
Ed. 3. 3. Fitz. resceipt 35, Resceit upon Cond.
where Tenant for life lets the Land to one upon condition, that if he dye in
the life of the Lessor, that it shall retourn to the Lessor, etc. upon such a
matter he may be received, and he cited for that the case of Wheler, 14 Hen. ^.
fol. 17. and a title suspended is no title, 3 Hen. 7. 12. and 30 Ed. 3. Lease
for life upon condition, that if the Rent be behind, then he shall retain the
Land, etc. and he said that the opinion of B^omley in Fulmerstons case was
contrary thereunto; but yet he said in 3 Eliz. he has a report which was
adjudged contrary to the opinion of Bromley. And also he cited 50 Ed. 3. that
a man shall not have the Rent and the Tenancy of the Land also. And so it
seemed to him that the Plaintiff shall be barred.

18.
THE case of Fr. Ashpool was moved again by Fenner, Hue and cry.
and it seemed to him that the Plaintiff ought to make Hue and cry, for as he
said it has allwaies been the manner of pleading, and also it has been
allwaies parcel of his issue to prove. Also he argued that he should not have
remedy by the Statute, post occasum solis; For Stamford says expressly, that if
a man be robbed in the day, that he shall have remedy, and the day shall be
said but from the rising of the Sun to the fall thereof, for the words of the
Statute are, that the Gates of the walled Towns shall be shut, ab occasu usque
ad ortum solis, and then if the Gates be shut, and that walled Town be within a
Hundred, how can they make Hue and cry? And the case in 3 Ed. 3. is not like to
this case, Fresh suit by the Hundreders.
for there it was enquired and found of the Dozen.

Anderson The fresh suit mentioned in the Statute, ought to be made by the
Inhabitants, and not by the parties, and I am of your opinion, that Hue and cry
was at the Common Law, but what of that? But look the Statute, and there is no
word of Hue and cry. And the Statute of 28 Ed. 3. is an exposition of that
Statute, and there is no mention thereof, but Fresh suit is there mentioned,
which ought to be made by the Inhabitants. And by those Statutes it seems
clearly that the Inhabitants ought to guard the Country in such sort, as men
may safely travel without robbing. And for the night, Sir, we ought to
construe it, as it is most reasonable, and about the setting of the Sun is the
common time of robbing, and therefore if this shall not be intended by the
Statute, nothing shall be intended; and allthough the walled Towns cannot
pursue, Walled Towns may keep the* ways.
yet they may keep the ways so, that no robberies shall be committed, and this
is both day and night as I think. And if a man be slain in the robbery so that
no Hue and cry can be made, I doubt not but the Country shall answer for the
robbery, A man is robbed slain and bound.
and so if he be bound: And if Hue and Cry ought to be, when ought it to be?
For if a man be bound two days together, he had as good make no Hue and cry,
as make Hue and cry afterward, and yet I hope you will agree that this man
shall be relieved by the Statute; which case was agreed by all the Court.


Peryam The day without doubt is after the Sunset. Day after Sunset.



Rodes cited the case of waging Battle in an Appeal in Stamford. And so by
agreement of all the Justices, Judgment was entered for the Plaintiff; but
Fenner said privately, that in his conscience it was against the Law; yet
notwithstanding all the Judges were clear in opinion, and the Sergeants of the
other part also.

So that it seemed to the Judges, that no Hue and Cry is necessary by the
party; for they all agreed that the Country ought to be kept so that no
Robberies be committed. And Anderson and Rodes affirmed precisely, that it is
not necessary, and the other agreed in the reason thereof, and said that it is
not mentioned in the Statute, but said that the ways ought to be kept so that
men may travel safely, or otherwise it is against the Statute.

19.
IN a Writ of False Judgment brought against the Mayor, Trial.
Sherifs, Citizens, and Commonalty of Norwich, it was moved where the Issue
shall be tried, and per Curiam it shall not be tried there, but yet the Action
may be used there. And in the same case it was demanded, Summons.
if the Sherif may summon himself, and the Court answered that he could not,
and Peryam said that so it has been adjudged here many times.

20.
THe ^ast day of the Term the matter of Lassels was moved again, and it seemed
to Anderson that the Obligation is void, in that there is an express form
limited by the Statute, and this varying from the form in substance, is void;
for in his opinion he excludes the party from his advantage given him by the
Statute. But all the other Justices held opinion against him; for they said,
that a man ought to appear in proper person upon a Latitat, which Anderson
denied, and said that the Latitats are not but of threescore years
continuance, which the other day Peryam had affirmed, and he seemed to mislike
with the Latitats. And the Sergeant moved for their resolution in the case.

Anderson All my Brethren are of opinion against me, wherefore take your
judgment accordingly. And so judgment was entered for the Plaintiff.


21.
GAwon brought Debt upon an Obligation against White, Traverse.
with condition that if the Defendant suffer the Plaintiff his Tenants and
Farmers to enjoy such a Common, that then, etc. And the Defendant pleaded
conditions performed, and the Plaintiff assigned for breach, that he did not
suffer A. B. his Tenant to enjoy, etc. Absque hoc, that he performed the
condition. And it was said by the Court, that this Traverse was not good, no
more than if one be bound to perform the covenants in an Indenture, and the
Defendant pleads that he has performed all, generally, if the Plaintiff assign
his breach, he shall not say further, Absque that the Defendant has performed
the covenants; for so much he had said before. But Walmisley would have put a
difference between the cases, because in the one there were diverse covenants to
be performed, but not so here.

Anderson If a man plead a Plea which is sufficient of it self, and take a
traverse also, you will grant that this Plea is not good, quod fuit concessum,
and this Plea had been sufficient of it self only, quod fuit concessum, ergo
the traverse was not good without question.


Et sic opinio totius Curiae.

22.
GOverstone brought a Replevin against B. Rent charge
who avowed the taking for a Rent charge granted to him by the Duke of Suffolk,
And this was the case, The Duke was seized of three parts of a Manor, and
granted a Rent charge to the Avowant; And one Pole was seized of the fourth
part; and Hatcher purchased the Dukes three parts, and the part of Pole also,
and demised a fourth part to the Plaintiff; but the Sergeants could not agree
whether it was Poles fourth part, or otherwise the fourth part generally; and
as it seemed to the Court, if it were the fourth part of Pole, then the Avowry
is not maintainable; but otherwise if it were the fourth part generally. And
after in Michaelmas Term the case was rehearsed again, and it was that he
demised eandem quartam partem to hold at will. And all the Justices agreed that
it shall be discharged, because it was never charged, allthough once he might
have distreined in all the Manor; Union of possession.
for that then there was no fourth part, for all was alike in the hands of the
purchaser, but now when the fourth part is in the hands of a stranger, it is no
reason that it shall be charged.

Walmisley But the Tenant at will has nothing but the profits by the way of
taking, Tenant at will.
and not any land; but if Hatcher had made a Feoffment, then I agree that it
shall be discharged.


^eryam And as well shall Tenant at will take the profits in his own right, as
long as the will does continue,


wherefore judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

23.
LEssee for years, Wast.
the reversion in fee to Constance Foster, and the Lessee granted over all his
term and interest to A. B. Pasch. 18 El.
reserving and excepting all trees growing in and upon the premises, Rot. 420.
the Lessee makes wast and destruction in the trees, and C. F. brought Wast
against the assignee, and if this action will lie or no, was the question,
wherein it was disputed, whether this exception and reservation made by the
Lessee be good or no; for if the reservation be void, then the action will lie
well against the Assignee, and thereupon these cases were put, to show both
what interest the Lessor and Lessee have in the Trees, viz. 33 Hen. 8. 2 Hen.
7. 42 Ed. 3. 21 Hen. 6. 46. 27 Hen. 6. Wast in Slatham, and 2 Eliz. fol.
Danseyes case, and 7 Hen. 6. and 12 Ed. 4. but to prove the reservation void
Fenner took this ground, That thing which a man cannot grant, he cannot
reserve; and the Lessee cannot grant the Trees, ergo, he cannot reserve them.
And afterward judgment was given for the Plaintiff, for default of pleading on
the part of the Defendant; but for the matter in Law two Judges were against
the other two, so that they could not agree.

De Term. Mic. An. Reg. Eliz. xxix. and xxx.
1.
AN action of Debt was brought by Bret against Andrews upon an Obligation
indorced with condition to stand to the arbitrament of A. B. Request.
who did arbitrate that the Defendant should pay to the Plaintiff xx^l and
appointed no certain day of payment; and the Defendant in pleading confessed
the arbitrament; but he said further, that the Plaintiff did never require him
to pay it, and thereupon the Plaintiff demurred in Law, and upon reading of the
Record, the Court held clearly, that it was no plea, because the Defendant at
his peril ought to make payment within convenient time, and the Plaintiff
needs not to make any request. And Anderson commanded to enter judgment
accordingly.

2.
FEnner moved this case, Possibility of Interest.
a man devises lands to his Wife for term of her life, and if she live until
his son come to the age of 24 years, that then he shall have the lands; and
if she dye before he come to that age, that then I. S. shall have it, until
his son come to that age, and dyed; then I. S. dyed before the wife, and
after she dyed before the son came to 24 years, if the Executors of I. S.
shall have the land until the son come to that age or no, was the question.
And the opinion of all the Court was, that they shall not have it, because
their Testator had never any interest vested in him.

Fenner But here was a possiblity of an interest.


Curia But that is not sufficient.


Rodes cited the case of Bret and Rigden in the Commentaries. Grant.


Anderson If I grant you, that if you pay me xxl. at Easter, then you shall
have an Annuity of xl s. to you and your heirs, if you dye before Easter, now
your Heir shall never have it, and so in this case.


3.
THatcher recovered in an Assise of Novel disseisin against Elmer for Lands in
Hackney in Middlesex, Redisseisin.
and after Elmer re-disseised him, and Thatcher re-entred, and Elmer disseised
him again. And Fleetwood moved the Court if Thatcher may have re-disseisin,
because that after action accrued to him he had re-entred.

Anderson What is the Judgment in this Action? Judgment.
Surely it is not that he shall recover any land, but double damages, and that
the Defendant shall be taken, and shall make a Fine; wherefore forasmuch as he
shall recover no land, the entry into the land cannot purge the offense and
wrong, which is made punishable by the Statute; and so was the opinion of the
whole Court.


And the Court then held opinion likewise, that if a man be disseised, and
after reenters, and is disseised again, Assise.
that he ought to have an Assise of the last entry, and not of the first, 27
Ass. pl. 42.

ONe Powell was sued in the Common Pleas, Privilege.
and as he was coming to Westminster, he was arrested in London, and thereupon
had a common Writ of Privilege surmising that he was coming to retain Counsel;
and Walmisley prayed that he might be examined whether he did so or no, but the
Court would not.

Walmisley It is no reason that if he be going about other matters he should
have the privilege of this place.


Curia A hundred Writs have been allowed without any examination.


Walmisley In 10 Hen. 6. and 4 Hen. 7. such an examination was made.


Anderson But that was not de rigore Juris,


and all the Court refused utterly to examine him. But Walmisley said privily,
that it was against the Law.

5.
DOrothy Millington brought Debt against J. Burges for 9 l. and declared that
he bought certain Oad; Wager of Law.
and the truth of the case was, this Oad was sold to him upon condition, that
if she did not prove it to be good and sufficient, then he should pay nothing
for it, and all this was disclosed by the Defendant upon his Wager of Law.
Detinue.


Windham If the case be so, then you may wage your Law,


and it was said, that she must have detinue for the Oad.

6.
IN an Avowry made by the Lady Rogers, Title in avowry.
it was said by the Court (Anderson absente) that it is sufficient for the
Avowant to plead his Freehold, but if the Plaintiff will traverse the same, he
ought to make himself a title. Nelson Pronotary, so are all our Presidents.

Peryam It is not sufficient to make it of his own seisin, but he must make it
Paramount his own seisin.


7.
WAlmisley moved for Judgment in the case of Richard Hanington for the
Plaintiff. For he said that it was not clearly discharged, because of the
possibility of the charge ensuing, allthough the charge were not then presently
executed; in proof whereof, he said that it is not all gone by the acceptance
of the Feoffment, and then it is a bargain, for a Lease for years is a bargain;
for there he has quid pro quo. Also it is a Title, as in Nichols case in the
Commentaries: And then allthough he had nothing which he could release, because
it was casual whether it shall happen or no, yet now when it happens it is a
charge ab initio, and thereupon he cited 9 H. 6. where one which had nothing
but a possibility may maintain. And so where a man makes a Feoffment, and
covenants that it shall be discharged, as here; and afterward his Wife
recovers her Dower, the Covenant is broken, and yet it was but a possibility.
And 8 Eliz. where a man covenants that it shall be discharged, and he had
granted a Rent charge to begin twenty years after, this was not discharged.
Fenner argued to the contrary for the reasons moved by him before.

Peryam Here allthough it be no charge at the time of the Feoffment, yet it is
not discharged; for if it were discharged, then it shall never be charged
afterward.


And so was the opinion of all the Court (Anderson absente) and after at the
end of the Term when Anderson was present they were all agreed that it was an
encumbrance, and not discharged of the encumbrance, and therefore they gave
Judgment for the Plaintiff.

8.
IN Avowry by John's of Surrey Esquire, Tenure.
it was said by Anderson for Law, that if a man before the Statute of quia
emptores terrarum, makes a gift, and reserveth to himself upon every alienation
the value of the Land by a year, this shall be adjudged according to the value
of the Land at the time of the tenure, and not that whereunto it is enhau^ced
at this day, for a tenure ought to be certain when it is made.

9.
^Aven brought Debt upon an Obligation against Stockdale who pleaded non est
factum, Statute 23 H. 6
and the Jury in Norfolk found this specially Verdict, that the Defendant was
sued by the Plaintiff, and made a Bond to the Plaintiff endorced with Condition,
that if the said S. did personally appear in the Queens Majesty's Court called
the Kings bench, and then and there make answer to such matter as the Plaintiff
should object against him, the said Plaintiff giving him warning, that then,
etc. And the Plaintiff was neither Sherif nor Sherifs Officer, for the pretense
of the Defendant was to avoid it by the Statute of 23 Hen. 6. And now the
Plaintiff prayed Judgment.

Anderson The case is no more than this; A man is bound to another to appear at
his suit in the King's Bench, and does not so, if this Obligation shall be
avoided, and I see no color to avoid it; for it is not within the Statute,


and all the Judges agreed clearly, that it is not within the Statute, and
therefore they gave Judgment for the Plaintiff.

10.
BLosse brought Trespass vi and armis against Halmon for taking of his Goods,
Possession.
the Defendant pleaded not guilty, and the Jury found a special Verdict, that
the Plaintiff at the time of the Trespass supposed was of the Mystery of the
Grocers, and that the Defendant was his servant, and put in trust to sell res
and mercandisas detempore in tempus in shopa sua existen. and he took those
goods and carried them away, etc. and they prayed the advice of the Court. The
doubt was because the action was vi and armis, whereas the Defendant had the
custody, or if this shallbe called a custody. Shuttleworth for the Plaintiff,
and he cited the case in Littleton fol. 15. if I deliver my sheep to compost
your land, Sheep.
and you kill them, I shall have trespass, whereto the Justices agreed, and
held clearly that he shall have this action well enough. Auctority.


Peryam he has but an auctority only, and not any custody or possession. v. 2.

TRespass by Foster against Pretty and his wife, Title.
who justified that I was seized and made a lease to them for years, etc. the
Plaintiff replied de son tort demeasne, Absque hoc that he leased, etc.

Peryam Will you take a Traverse and not make your self a title?


Curia without question you ought to make your self a title, otherwise it is if
the Defendant claym a Common, or such like, and no possession of the land.


11.
BRet Plaintiff against Shepherd, Appara^ce.
the Condition of the Obligation was to appear at his Suit in the King's Bench,
and upon Condition performed pleaded, Trial by the Record.
the issue was found for the Plaintiff. And now he spoke in arrest of judgment,
for that the trial ought to have been by the Record, and not by the Country.
And so was the opinion of the Court. But Radford Pregnotary said that the
trial was good enough, for it may be that he appeared there, and yet there is
no Record made thereof; to whom it was answered, that then it is no appearance
if it be not recorded; and Radford replied, suppose that there is not any such
suit there? how then can it be recorded? but the rule of the Court was ut
supra, for then the Obligation seems to be single.

13.
THe case of Calgate against Blyth was now again argued by Fletewood for the
Plaintiff. And first he said that the limitation by the Wife is not good, for
which he took this ground, that always when a man shall gain a fee simple by
matter of conclusion of Record, that he shallbe seized to his own use, And here
the Husband had a fee by conclusion by the fine, and therefore his limitation
good only. Carill.
And there upon he put a case reported by Carill, who was a grave man, Fine
levied
and very learned in the law. That if Husband and Wife levy a fine to B. who
rendereth to them again for life, the reversion shall remain in the Conisor to
his own use, Also he put another case put by Baldwin in the time of H. 8. Grant
of all Estate.
that a man seized in right of his Wife grants totum statum suum to another,
the grantee shall have it no longer than during the life of the Husband if his
Wife overlive him, but if she have issue by him, then he shall have it during
the life of the Husband absolutely. Fine.
And if two tenants in common in^eoff B. Fe^ff^^ent.
in see to their use, they are then tenants in common of this use, Diff^^^n^^
per Tenants ^n common.
but if they levy a fine to B. to their use, then they are Joyntenants. And in
Queen Mary's time a parson of a Church, by license of his patron and ordinary
levied, fi Parson levies a F^e.
a fine of a portion of his Rectory, and it was adjudged that it shallbe to his
own use in his natural capacity; Bishops.
the same law is if a Bishop levy a fine, and he cited 1^. H. 4. 1. the first
case, and so he prayed judgment for the plaintiff. Anderson chief justice
rehearsed the case, and first he said that the Wife without her Husband cannot
limit the use without doubt, And here the case is no more, but whether the
husband may limit the use without the privity of his Wife, and I think it a
strong case that he cannot. Notice of a use.
If Husband and Wife have an use, and they grant it over to one who has notice
of the Use, this shallbe to the use of the Wife again; What a use is.
and he defined an Use to be an intent and trust to convey lands, and cited 6.
H. 7. and that when the interest of the inheritance is in the Wife, Fine.
if Husband and Wife levy a fine, this shall be to to the use of the Wife, for
the use arises out of them which give the land, and not by the Conises or
Feoffees, for they neither grant nor give the use, Feoffment by he Husband
alone.
and then it shall be to the use of the Wife again. But if the Husband alone make
a Feoffment, this shall be to his own use, and the Wife after his death shall
be driven to her action. And if the wife had been privy or assenting to the
limitation, Assent without naming.
although she had not been named, yet it should be a good limitation, but the
Jury have found that she was not privy; And a case was here adjudged, Indenture
after a fine levied.
that where a fine was levied, and the limitation made after by Indenture, that
this shall be to the use of the Indenture, if there be no other against it; but
in this case it is found expressly by the Jury, that she never agreed, which
does impugn that which otherwise should be intended; then now the case is no
otherwise but that a fine is levied, and no use is limited, but if the fine had
been levied, Silence is an agreem^ni.
and the Husband only limited the use, and nothing else had been done against
it, then it should have been to the use limited by the Husband, because it
should have been intended that the Wife had consented thereunto, and so I think
judgment shall be given against the Plaintiff.

Windham I am of the same opinion, and it seems that their difference and
disagreement in the limitation is the cause that both the limitations are void.
First let us see who has auctority to limit the use? surely the principal
owner of the land has the principal auctority to limit the use, and here the
Wife is the principal owner, What a use is.
and therefore has chief power to dispose of the use; And, Sr. the use is the
chief profit and commodity of the land, and cannot be severed from the land, no
more than the shadow from the body, and this was the reason of the Statute of
27. H. 8. which draws the possession to the use, and not the use to the
possession, for the use is the principal, for by the common law by bargain and
sale enrolled the land shall pass without livery, Bargain and sale.
for this was a contract for the use, and then the law shall make the land to
pass, The Law erects. the use.
and whithersoever the use is now carried, the land and possession shall
follow, but when the Law carries the use, it is to the owner and proprietary
of the Land. The mothers heir.
For if a man seized of Lands on the part of his Mother, levy a fine thereof,
the use shall pass according as the land shall, because the law carries the
use. And here the Wife cannot limit the use without her Husband, and therefore
that is void, but yet it is good to this intent, to show her disagreement.
Silence Consent
And if the Husband limit the use, and she does not disagree, the law intends
that she consents thereunto, because she has joined in the fine. Sale in
London by Husband and Wife.
And therefore in London, sale of the lands of the Wife by deed enrolled by the
Husband only is good if she assent, or if she do not disagree. And although
that she shall not be examined concerning the use, yet the Law will not have
her defrauded of her land by joining in the fine, without her consent to the
use; for by that means every Wife may be defrauded of her land by joining in a
fine, which were a great inconvenience, and contrary to this ground in Law,
that the Husband cannot dispose of the Wifes lands without her consent. And
although that if the Wife had not showed her agreement or disagreement, then it
should have been to the use limited by the Husband, yet here she has showed
an express disassent, and so by their variance, both their declarations are
void, Quare impedit.
as in a Quare impedit by two, if both make several titles, both shallbe
barred, and so judgment shallbe given against the Plaintiff. No Use limited.



Peryam to the same intent. First it is a plain case that if a Husband and Wife
levy a fine and limit no use, then the use is to them as the land was before,
Use what it is.
for the use is the profit of the land, and the Wife alone cannot limit the
use, for during the coverture she has submitted her will to the will of her
Husband. Silence.
And if they both levy a fine, and he only by Indenture limits uses,
Limitation after fine.
if she do nothing, then his limitation is good, and the case of Vavisour
adjudged here that a limitation after the fine is good. And here the Husband
has limited the use to himself for life; Who shall limit uses.
and afterward they both agree in the limitation, now if the residue in which
they agree shall be good? I will show my opinion therein likewise, because that
also may come in question hereafter. And I think that this shall not bind the
inheritance, for it is a ground in Law, that limiters of uses shallbe such as
have power interest and auctority of the land, and no further; As if Tenant for
life and he in reversion join in a fine, Fine.
Tenant for life shall limit but for his life, but here by the death of the
Wife the ability of the Husband is gone, for he had no issue by her, and
therefore his use shall be gone also, for otherwise it should be a great
inconvenience; but if they had joined in the limitation, then the inheritance
of the Wife had been bound, Inheritance. shall be bound by agreement.
and so it is if the Law can intend that she had agreed; And to say that the
Conisees shall take it from the Husband and Wife, and therefore the Wife to be
concluded, is but small reason, for she may confess the Record well enough, as
appears by the case of Ear and Snow in the Com. and no man can limit uses
further than he has the land, and here the limitation for the inheritance
after the death of the wife cannot be good, and for their variance both are
void. And so I think judgment shallbe given against the Plaintiff. Rodes to the
same intent, for the Jury has found that the Wife did not agree, and this
special finding shall avoid all other common intendments. Intendment.
And the intendment of the party shall overthrow the intendment of the Law, and
he cited Ear and Snowes case, where it was found that the wife had nothing.
And he cannot limit uses farther than he has estate in the land, and therefore
judgment shall be given against the Plaintiff.


Anderson then enter judgment accordingly.


14.
AN Action upon the statute of Hue and cry was brought against the hundred of
Dunmow in Essex, Robbery in the night
and the Jury found a special verdict that the Plaintiff was robbed about three
a clock in morning before day light, and thereupon prayed the advice of the
Court, And now all the Judges were agreed, that for because the Robbery was
done in the night, and not in the day, therefore the Hundred shall not be
charged, and they commanded to enter judgment accordingly.

15
BEtween Cogan and Cogan the case was, Copulative.
that the Defendant had sold certain land sown with oad to the Plaintiff, and
that if any restraint shall be by proclamation or otherwise, that it should not
be lawful to the Plaintiff to sow and make oad, then he should have certain
money back again, and after proclamation came that no man should sow oad within
four miles of any market Town, or clothing Town, or City, or within eight miles
of any Mansion House of the Queen, and the Plaintiff showed the Land was within
four miles of a Market Town, and because he did not averr that it was a
Clothing Town also, the Defendant demurred in law, And all the Judges held,
that he had showed sufficient cause of his Demurrer, for the meaning was to
restrain by the proclamation as well all manner of market Towns, as those
market Towns which were clothing Towns. And after Puckering showed that the
restraint was only from sowing oad, and not from making, and their Contract
was that if any restraint should be from sowing and making, in the copulative,
whereby he thought the Plaintiff should be barred, quod Curia concessit.

16.
BEtween Cock and Baldwin the case was, Pas. 29. Eliz.
that a lease was made for 21 years to one Tr^w penny and Elizabeth his wife,
Rot. 1410.
if he and she, Copulative.
or any child or children between them lawfully begotten, should live so long;
And after they were married the wife died without issue; if the lease be
thereby determined or no was the question? because it is in the conjunctive (he
and she) and now one of them is dead without issue; and this case is not like
Chapmans case in the Commentaries; where one covenants to infeoff B. and his
heirs, for there it is impossible to Emfeoff his heirs as long as B. Lease to
a for life
shall live, and therefore there it shall be taken in the disjuctive and the
same Sergeant said that if A. Lease for life of 2
lets land to two for life, if one dye, the other shall have all by survivour,
because they took it by way of interest; Difference.
but if I let land to two to have and to hold for the lives of two other, if
one of them dye, the lease is gone, quod fuit concessum, and here the lease
shall be determined by the death of one, because so was the intent.

Rodes the meaning seems to be conrrary, for by the (or) which comes
afterward, it appears that they should have their lives in it.


Peryam Anderson and Wyndham said that it appears by the disjunctive sentence
which comes afterward, that the intent was that the lease shall not be
determined by the death of one of them, and the reason which moved the Lord
Anderson to think so was, because the state was made before the marriage, and
so it is as a jointure to the wife, and therefore not determined by the death
of the one.


And after they all gave judgment accordingly.

17.
WAlgrave brought trespass quare vi and armis against Somersetbeing Tenant at
will, Trespass vi and armis against Tenant at Will Wast.
and the Defendant demurred in law whether such an action will lie against him
or no, it was for cutting down of trees, And at this day Anderson rehearsed the
case, and said that they were all agreed, that the action will lie well enough
vi and armis, for otherwise he shall have no action, for wast is not
maintainable, and Littleton says that Trespass lies, and so seems the
better opinion, in 2 E. 4. 33. for otherwise this being a common case, it shall
be a common mischief; And he commanded the Pregnotary to enter judgment for
the Plaintiff.

18.
Snagg moved to stay Judgdment in the case of Blosse, Property.
and he cited 2 Ed. 4. 4. If the servant of a Mercer take his goods, Trespass
will not lie, (sed vide librum) and he cited 3 Hen. 7. 12. that it shall not be
Felony in a Shepherd or a Butler.

Windam If he had imbezeled the goods, it is Felony, and for the case of 3 Hen.
7. it is Felony without question, Property.



quod fuit concessum.

Anderson The servant has neither general nor special property in the goods,
Taking Embezeling.
and he shall have no Action of Trespass if they be taken away, and therefore
if he take them, Difference.
Trespass lies against him, and if he imbezell them, it is Felony,


wherefore he commanded to enter Judgment for the Plaintiff.

19.
THomas Taire and Joane his Wife brought an Action of Wast against Pepyat, Pas.
25. Eliz.
and declared how that the Defendant was seized in Fee, Rot. 602.
and made a Feoffment to the use of himself for life, Wast.
and after to the use of the Mother of Joane in Fee, who died, and it descended
to her, and after the Defendant made Wast, etc. The Defendant pleaded that he
was, and yet is seized in Fee, Absque hoc that he made the Feoffment in manner
and form, pro ut, etc. And the Jury found a special Verdict, that the
Defendant made a Feoffment to the use of himself for life, but that was without
impeachment of Wast, the Remainder in Fee as before. And the Plaintiff prayed
Judgment, and the doubt was, because they have found their issue, and more,
viz. that it was was without impeachment of Wast.

Anderson Whether it were without impeachment of Wast or no, was no part of
their issue, and then the Verdict for that point is void, and the Plaintiff
shall have Judgment.


Windham The doubt is for that they have found that the Defendant, is not
punishable, and where a Verdict discloseth any thing, whereby it appears that
the Plaintiff ought not to Recover, Judgment thereupon ought to be given
against him; As in detinue, the Plaintiff counts upon a Bailment by himself,
Bailment.
and the Jury finds, that another Bailed to his use, the Plaintiff shall not
Recover.


And a Sergeant at the Bar said, that the issue, is not found.

Anderson That which is found more than their issue is void, Assise.
and therefore in 33 Hen. 6. where the Tenant in Assise pleades null Tenant de
franktenement nosme en lasise and ^i tro^^ ne so it. etc. and the Jury found
that he was Tenant, but that he held jointly with another, and there the
Plaintiff Recovered, and so he shall here.


And at length by the opinion of all the Court, Judgment was entered for the
Plaintiff; for he might have helped the matter by pleading.

16.
IN debt by May against Johnson, Payment.
the Condition was to pay a 100. l. to Cowper and his Wife, and by all the
Court, if he plead payment to Cowper alone, it suffices, for payment to him
alone suffices without naming the Wife.

15.
IN a Quare impedit by Sir Thomas Gorge, Avoydance.
against the B. of Lincoln and Dalton Incumbent, the case was that a Manor
with an advowson appendant was in the hands of the King, then the Church becoms
void, and after the King grants the Manor with the advowson; now the question
was, if the Patentee shall have this presentation, or the King? And all the
Judges held clearly that the avoydance does not pass, for it was a Chattell
vested in the King, and they cited 9 Edward 3. 26. and Dyer fol. 300. but
Fitzh. not. br. is contrary. fol. 33. 11.

22.
DEbt was brought by Goore Plaintiff for 200. l. Bailiwick.
upon such a Bill; Be it known unto all men by these presents, that I, Ed.
Wingfield, of H. in the County of Midd. Esquire do acknowledge my self to be
indebted to William Goore, in 200. l. for the payment whereof I, mine Heirs,
and Assigns, do license the said G. to have and use the Baliwick of Dale; to
the use, etc. until, etc. the Defendant pleaded in bar, that the Plaintiff had
used the said Bailiwick, and said no more, nor at what place he had received
the money; and Suagg moved that the Plea was not good, because he had not
showed the value, which he ought to have done: Value.
and the Judges were of the same opinion, and they said moreover that this Plea
is not good in bar of this specialty, for payment is no plea upon a single
Bill, License.
and he might have brought his Action upon this Bill, without using the
Bailiwick; for this License is no Condition. and (...).

AN Ejectione Firm was brought by Dorothy Michell against Edmund Dunton,
Covenant.
and the case was this. A man makes a Lease for years, rendering Bent upon
Condition, with a Covenant that the Lessee shall repair the Houses, with other
Covenants. And after he devises the same Lands to the same Lessee for more
years, rendering the like Rent, and under the like Covenants, as in the first
Lease; the remainder over to another in Fee, and dies. Then the first Lease
expires, and the Lessee held in, by force of the Devise, and did not repair the
Houses, so that if the first Lease had been in esse, Condition.
he had broken a Covenant, now if this shall be a Condition, so that he in
Remainder may enter, was the question.

Shuttleworth This is a Condition, for he cannot have an Action of Covenant,
and then the intent was, that it shall be a Condition. But all the Court was
against him, and that the intent was not so, for the words are (under like
Covenants) which words do not make a Condition, allthough they be in a Will.


Anderson The nature of a Covenant is, (...)*
to have an Action, and not to enter, and so all the Court held it no Condition.


And Per^^^ said, that (under like Covenants) were void words, and therefore
Judgment shall be given against you.

2.
PUckering the Queens Sergeant moved, Fee determinable.
that one Adams was indebted to the Queen in a great sum which was stalled to
pay yearly so much, until all werere paid. And for security he levied, a a
fine to William Lord Burghley Lord Treasurer, and others that they should stand
seized to the use of Adams until he made default of payment of the said sum,
and then they should stand seized to the use of the Queen until she were
satisfied and paid, and then to the use of Adams and his Heirs; And after
Adams by deed enrolled, sold the Land to a stranger in Fee, and after the said
stranger failed in payment of the said yearly sum, whereby the Queen seized the
Land, and so continued until she was satisfied, now the question was, who
should have the Lands, Adams, or the Bargainee?

Anderson Ifyou will take the case according to the words, it is short, tell
me, what Estate had Adams by this Limitation?


Puckering A Fee determinable.


Anderson How then can the Bargainee have it when the Estate is determined?


Puckering But the Fee was limited to Adams and his Heirs. Possibility cannot
be granted, nor released.



Anderson This is but a possibility which cannot be granted over. And if I were
a Chancellor, Adams should not have the Land, but upon the words I tell you my
mind, and alii Justie. conticuerunt.


3.
DAniel Bettenham Plaintiff against Debora Harlackendon; Reversion upon a devise.
the case was this, one Harlack was seized, and devises it to the Plaintiff for
years, the Remainder to the Defendant being his Wife for life, and provided
that the Lessee should pay the Wife xx. l. a year for Rent, at two Feasts, and
after the Plaintiff failed of payment, whereby the Wife entered for the Condition
broken.

Anderson Wherefore may not a man make Reservation upon a Devise?


Peryam A man may reserve to himself or to his (...), but this is to a stranger.


Anderson Every man which takes by a Devise, is in, in the per by the Devisor,
quod fuit concessum, wherefore then shall not this be as a Reservationto the
Devisor, and as a grant of the Reversion to the Wife.


Gandy. If it shall be a firm in gross, Sum in gross.
yet I think that she ought to demand it, which she has not done.


Anderson and Rodes denied that case clearly, and that the contrary has been
adjudged,


Anderson If I Devise Lands to a man for years, rendering Rent to me and mine
Heirs, Devise of a Reversion after a Term.
And after I Devise the Reversion, he shall have the Rent as incident to the
Reversion.


Peryam This may be agreed, but the cases are not like.


and adjornatur.

4.
IN debt by Rostock, Waging of Law.
the case was, that the Plaintiff and, another made a Contract with the
Defendant, and the Plaintiff alone brought the Action and Walmisley moved the
Court, if the Defendant may wage his Law, for it is not the same Contract, and
he cited 20 Hen. 6. account before Auditors, where it was but before one
Auditor, he may wage his Law, and 35 Hen. 6. is an express case in the point.
And so was the opinion of the Court. Anderson absente.

5.
A Writ of Entry sur diss. Voucher.
was brought by Sir Thomas Sherly, against Grateway, who vouched one Brown, and
he entered into the Warranty, saving to himself a Rent issuing out of the same
Land, and this was allowed by the Court, and the Voucher was in a Writ of entry
for a Common Recovery to be had.

6.
EDward Smith brought his Action of the case against Winner, Slander.
for words, viz I was robbed of goods to the value of 40. l. and they were
stolen by Smith and his Household (ipsum Edwardum ac quosdam Eliz. xuorem ac L.
F. servientem ejus muendo) and the issue was found for the Plaintiff. And the
Defendant spoke in arrest of Judgment, because S. alone brought the Action.
But all the Court said, that the Action is well brought, for the slander is
several. And Peryam that if (...) a man say that three have robbed him, Vno
flatu.
and name them, uno (...), every of them may have a several Action.

7.
IN an Assise by Thatcher where he was Redisseised, Redisseisin
the Redisse^^ was found in part, and thereupon the Court was moved, if
Redisseisin will lie, in as much as it is not but of part, and the Writ is, if
he be Redissesitus de ^odem tene^^nto, then Redisseisin lies; but the Court
held that Redisseisin lies of part, and that he shall recover damages, as they
are assessed by the Jury, and not by the (...). Then it was moved, if
Redisseisin lies in Middlesex or (...) Fleetwood says, that the ancient
Expositors have taken it, that it does not lie there, because it is not coram
lustic. itinerant but all the Court held the contrary. And Walmisley said, that
there be Writs in the Register accordingly.

8.
THe Earl of Kent brought debt upon an Obligation indorced with Condition, Time
convenient.
that if the Defendant do permit the Plaintiff his Ex^cutor^s and Assigns not
only to thresh the Corn in the Defendants Barn, but also to carry it away,
from time to time, and at all times hereafter convenient, with free Egress and
Regress, or else to pay 8 l. upon request, that then, etc. and in truth the
Defendant permited the Corn to be there two years, in which time, Mice and Rats
had devoured much of it, and then the Defendant threshed the Residue, and the
Earl brought his Action, and there was a demurrer entered.

Walmisley the Bond is not forfeit, for the Earl has not taken it out in time
convenient, for he ought to take it in time convenient, and time convenient is
that which is not prejudicial to any person, (which the Justices privily
denied,) and here it is a prejudice to the Defendant, if the Plaintiff will not
carry away his Corn, and thereupon he cited many cases, that things shall be
done in time convenient, Arbitrament.
as in 21 Ed. 4. arbitrament ought to be made in time convenient.


Anderson Your cases are by act in Law, but here you have bound your selves,
and the Condition is (at time convenient) and if he will come in the night, or
on the Sabbath day, this is no convenient time, but allthough that he come in a
long time after, yet it may be (at) time convenient, and the words are not
(within) time convenient, and so was the opinion of the Court.


And Windham said, that if it had been (within) time convenient, there would
have been a difference.

9.
MIchael Hare and 3 others brought an Action of Trespass quare clausum fregit,
Trespass.
and Assigned the place in sixteen Acres of Land called Churchclose, Contents
of a new assignment.
and the Defendant pleaded not guilty, and the Jury found a special Verdict,
that Churchclose conteyneth fixty Acres, whereof those sixteen were parcel,
and that diverse men were seized of diverse other parcells of the said close,
and that Hare only was seized of the said sixteen Acres, in which, etc. and
exposuit eas to the three other Plaintifs to be sown, and that he should find
half the seed, and they three should find the other half, whereby the Land was
sown accordingly, and that the Bore of Okely came and destroyed the Corn. Sed
utrum, etc. And the doubt rested upon two points, 1. because the Verdict says,
that it contains sixty Acres, and so shall be intended not the same place,
and the Court varied in opinion thereof, insomuch that the sixteen Acres are
found to be within the close containing sixty Acres, but for the 2 which was,
that they all four joined in quare clausum fregit, and it appears that three
have nothing there, Verdict shall abate the Writ.
but that Hare is sole seized, And for that, the Court held opinion that the
Verdict shall abate the Writ, for the Defendant cannot break their close where
three of them have nothing, but Hare only.

Rodes A Case has been adjudged a where Che^ey brought Partition against Bury,
Partition.
who pleaded that they did not hold in Common, and the Jury found that he and
his Wife held in Common, and yet the Verdict abated the Writ.


Windham You will all grant that the other three have no interest in the Land
(quod Walmisley concessit) how then can they have quare (...) fregit?


Fenner Executors shall have quare clausum fregit, Executors.
and yet they have no interest in the Land.


Rodes There they have an interest for the time.


Anderson Here is but a bargain, and no interest, and then the three have no
color to bring Trespass, quare ela^sum fregit.


10.
THe Quare impedit brought by the Queen against the Bishop of Lincoln was
demurred in Law, Avoydance.
and now the Record was read, and day given over to hear the Arguments, but
(...) said, that it is all one case with that which has been adjudged here,
viz. that the Queen has title of Lapse, and does not present, but the Patron
presents, and after the Church becomes void by the death of the Incumbent, that
now the Queen shall not present; but the Court answered, Difference between
Death and Privation.
that there the avoydance came by death, but here it comes by privation, and
whether this will make a diversity was the question.

11.
HArper brought Trespass against Spiller and Drew, Estate.
upon not guilty pleaded, a special Verdict was found, and the case in effect
was this, F. gave Lands to a woman, to have and to hold to her, and to the
heirs of F. of the body of the woman engendered; what estate the woman had was
the question; and now the Record was read, and day given over to argue it.

12.
SHuttleworth moved the Court, Amendment.
and showed, that one Brokes by had brought a Quare impedit against the Bishop
of Lincoln, and others, and the Writ was, suam spectat donationem, and this
word ((...)) was omitted, and he prayed the Court that it might be amended, and
he cited 11 Hen. 6. 2. where it was (imaginavit) and it should have been
(imaginat. fuit) and 13 Hen. 7. where the test was omitted, and the Court took
time of advisement, and at length by the opinion of all the Justice it was
amendable, and then a Clerk of the Chancery came into the Court of the
Common Pleas, and amended it.

13.
IN an Avowry for an Amercement in a Leet, By-law.
a Prescription was made for making of By-lawes, and Peryam said that every
By-law ought to be made for the common benefit of the inhabitants, and not for
the private commodity of any particular man, as J. S. only, or the Lord only.
As if a By-law be made that none shall put in his beasts into the common-field
before such a day, this is good; but if a By-law be made, that they shall not
carry hay upon the lands of the Lord, or break the hedges of J. S. this is not
good, because it does not respect the common benefit of all: And Windha^^ said,
that some Books are, that they shall bind no more than such as agree to them.

14.
HAre brought Debt against Curson for a great sum, Capias utl^gatum.
and Process continued until Capias ^tlog. And the Plaintiff moved the Court
that the Sherif might be commanded to execute the Writ, because they doubted
thereof, and the Writ was delivered to the Sherif in Court; and he said that he
would do his endeavor, but Curson has long kept his house, so that he cannot
come at him.

Peryam You may take the power of the Country with you, and break his house,
and take him out; for so it has been adjudged here,


which the Court granted.

15.
PUckering showed how an Action of Debt was brought against an Administrator,
Asset^.
who pleaded plens administra^it, and thereupon the Jury found a special
Verdict, that certain Obligations made by the Testator to the value of a
hundred pound were forfeit, and the Administrator took in the said Bonds, and
gave his own Bond for the Debt, and retained the money in his own hands,
besides which, etc. he had nothing, etc. and if that hundred pound shall be
liable to this Action of the Plaintiff, they prayed the advice of the Court; and
by the opinion of Windham and Peryam it shall not be Assets, because the
property is changed in giving his own Bond for the same, Payment with Proper
r^^ds.
and it is, as if he had paid the Debts with his own goods; but if he had
compounded for less, Surplusage.
then the surplusage should have been Assets. But Rodes was of a contrary
opinion in the principal case, forasmuch as he had paid no money, but only
given his Bond for in and Anderson was absent at this day. And after at another
day, the case was moved again by Shuttelworth, and then he showed that for part
thereof the Administrator had given his Bond, and for another part his promise,
Promise,
and he said that this is no payment but a composition, and therefore no change
of property.

Anderson For so much as he has given his promise, I think it not good,
because that by this promise this first debt being due by Bond is not
discharged, but for so much as he has given his Bond for, I hold it good
enough, because the first Debt is discharged thereby, allthough that the
Obligation be made to a stranger, Estranger.
by the appointment of the Debtee, and also before the Debt due; for by this
the first Debt is gone.


And Windham and Peryam were of the same opinion, that the Debt was discharged,
and that it should not be Assets in his hands, but Rodes doubted thereof, and
it was adjorned.

16.
JOhn Cleyton brought an Ejectione firm against Lawsell and Lawsell
Defendants, Abatement.
and after a Verdict found for the Plaintiff, and before Judgment one of the
Defendants died, and the Writ was adjudged to stand good against the other.

17.
IN Debt by Saunderson, Wager of Law.
the Defendant pleaded nil debet per legem, and in truth the money was due to
the Plaintiff, but the Plaintiff was also indebted to the Defendant in the like
sum, and before the Action brought, they were agreed, that each of them should
be acquitted against the other, and thereupon the Defendant would have waged
his Law, Concord.
and Anderson and Peryam doubted much whether he might do so, or no; for an
accord without satisfaction is no plea^ and Debt cannot be discharged by
paroll; No discharge by word.
but Rodes said that it is good by consent of the parties, and so said some
Sergeants, and Fenner cited 11 Rich. 2. tit. Bar. 242. where a man has a Rent
by way of Retainer, and Rodes cited 22 Hen. 6. and 37 Hen. 6. Payment by way of
Retainer.

18.
EDward Sibill brought Debt against George Hill, Rent suspended.
for Rent reserved, upon a Lease for years, and the Defendant pleaded, that the
Plaintiff had entered into part before any rent due, and the issue was, expulit
and amovit and adhuc extra tenet, whereby it is plain, that entry into part
suspends all the rent. And in Hill. Term before in the like case for rent
reserved, Pleading.
the Defendant pleaded nil debet per priam. and he would have given in evidence
an entry before any rent due, and per Curiam, he could not do so, but ought to
plead it, ut supra; for it does not maintain the Issue, no more than in the
case of Wast, 12 Hen. 8. 1.

19.
IN a Quare impedit by Agnes Kemp against the Bishop of Winchester, Joint
Advowson.
Anderson told the Jury upon the Evidence given, that if there be four
Joyntenants of an Advowson, and one of them grants over his interest, this is
good, and the survivor shall not hold place. And Windham and Rodes did not
gainsay it; and Peryam was absent, but Fenner spoke against it, because it is
a thing entire, but Anderson clearly to the contrary.

20.
CUnuy brought an Action of Debt upon an Escape against Sir James Harrington
Sherif of the County of Huntington, Escape.
who pleaded that the Plaintiff dedit concensum eidem Jacobo, that the prisoner
should go at large, whereby he did so.

Walmisley He ought to plead it by way of license, and not by consent.


Curia The Plea is good without question, and he may take issue thereupon.


21.
Tailor brought an Action upon an Assumpsit against Fulham for payment of
money, Release by word.
and the Defendant pleaded that after the Assumpsit, the Plaintiff released to
him all Assumpsits, and this he pleaded without Deed, and the Court said that
this Plea is not good, and they commanded Shuttelworth to demur to it, and they
would give him expedition; and he demurred to the Plea; and Anderson was very
angry with the Sergeant which set his hand to the Plea.

22.
Jane Plain was Plaintiff against Sams, Tenant by courtesy.
and the Jury found a special Verdict, viz. that one Jane Plain the Mother was
seized in fee, and had issue Elizabeth and Jane now Plaintiff, and by Indenture
upon consideration of natural affection to her two Daughters, covenanted to
stand seized to the use of Elizabeth in tail, upon condition following, viz.
that the said Elizabeth the heirs of her body or their Assigns should pay to
Jane (now Plaintiff) thirty pound within one year after the death of Jane the
Mother, or within one year after that Jane (now Plaintiff) should accomplish the
age of eighteen years, and for default of issue in Elizabeth, the remainder to
Jane (now Plaintiff) in tail; Elizabeth takes a Husband, and has issue of her
body, which dies without issue, and Elizabeth did not pay the thirty pound
within the year after the death of Jane the Mother; and then Jane (now
Plaintiff) came to the age of eighteen years, Disability of performance.
and after Elizabeth dyed within the year after that Jane came to the age of
eighteen years, without issue, and after the year passed, and no money was
paid, whereby the Plaintiff entered, and if the Husband shall be Tenant by the
courtesy, was the question; and upon the motion, the Court was clear in
opinion, that he shall be Tenant by the courtesy; for the condition was gone;
because Eliz. dyed within the time which she had limited to her for performance
thereof. And Anderson said, that if an estate be determined by limitation, this
will not avoid a Tenancy by the courtesy, Limitation, condition, difference.
but otherwise it is if the estate be determined by a condition; for this shall
relate to the defeasance of the estate.

23.
EJectione firm was brought by Stapley against Lark, Use.
and upon Evidence the case was, that Feoffees seized to the use of B. before
the Statute of 27 Hen. 8. by consent of B. made a Feoffment to another and his
heirs, to the use of the said Feoffee and his heirs, and the Feoffee had notice
of the first use; now if he shall be seized to his own use or no was the
question, and all the Justices held, that he shall be seized to his own use,
because the use was so expressed upon the Feoffment. And so is the Law if the
second Feoffment had been in consideration of money, Consideration of money.
allthough no use had been limited, yet it should have been to the use of the
Feoffee and his heirs, and not to the first use.

24.
IT was the opinion of three Justices, Disseisin.
that if a man levy a Fine, sur conisans de droit come ceo que il ad de son
don. etc. and after continue possession, that yet he is a Disseisor, and not
Tenant at will or sufferance, and that a Praecipe lies against him.

De Term. Pasch. Anno xxx* Eliz. Reg.
1.
IN a Writ of Annuity, it was the opinion of the Justices, that if one grant a
Rent charge to B. which is paid to him, Rent charge.
and after B. grants it over to C. and the Tenant of the Land attourneth, that
now C. shall not have his election to make this an Annuity, but ought to take
it as a Rent charge.

2.
THomas Michell brought debt upon an Obligation against Stockwith and Andrews,
Seal fall off after issue.
and the Jury found a special Verdict, viz. that after the issue joined, and
before the nisi prius, the seal of Andrews was fallen off, and si, etc.

Windham A case has been adjudged here, that where a Bond was delivered to the
Custos brevium to be kept, and the Mise broke the seal, Custos brevium.
and the Court adjudged that the Plaintiff should be at no prejudice thereby.


And here insomuch that no fault was in the Plaintiff, the Court awarded that he
should recover, and Judgment was entered accordingly.

3.
WIghtman is Plaintiff against Chartman. Conjunctim.
And the case was this, two were bound in an Obligation and quilibet eorum
conjunctim, and the Action was brought against one alone, and the opinion of
the Court was, that it is not maintainable, by reason of this word conjunction.

4.
WAlmisley moved concerning the Quare impedit brought by the Queen And he
thought that she shall recover, Avoidance.
for the avoidance is by Privation, and the same party is presented again, and
and if these shifts may be used, the Queen shall never have a Lapse, for then
the Incumbent shall be deprived, and the same Incumbent presented: Fenner to
the contrary, and said that where her title is restrained to a time, there she
shall have no Prerogative, to the prejudice of a third person, nor to alter
their Estates. And for that in 1 Ed. 3. if the King have a Lordship and Rent,
and he grant the Lordship over, and retain the Rent, and after the Land
escheats, the Rent is gone, The year day and Want.
as in the case of a common person, and the Queen shall have the year, day, and
Wast; but if Tenant for life die, she shall not have it; Dower against Guardian.
And in Dower against the Guardian, if the Heir come to full age the Writ shall
abate.

5.
AN Action upon the case was brought for calling the Plaintiff Bankrupt,
Bankrupt.
and a Verdict passed for the Paintif. And now Shutleworth showed in arrest of
Judgment, that the Plaintiff had not declared that he was a Merchant, or of any
Mystery or trade. And the Court held the Declaration insufficient for the same
cause, and made a rule for stay of the Judgment accordingly.

6.
IN a Replevin brought by Mary Colthirst against Thomas Delves, Descent of a
third part.
it was agreed by three Justices (Anderson being in the Starchamber) that if a
man have Lands held in chief to the value of 60 l. that he may Devise Lands to
the value of 40. l. if he suffer the rest to the value of 20. l. to descend to
his Heir; And therefore they overruled it upon evidence to the Jury, that where
one Barners was seized of the Manor of Toby, in the County of Essex, and was
also seized of the Manor of Hinton in the County of Gloucester, Entire Manor.
and all those were held by Knights service in chief, and devises the Manor
of Toby to his Wife for life, that his Heir at the Common Law shall have no
part thereof, if the Manor of Hinton amounts to the third part of all his
Lands. Also they overruled, that if a man after Marriage convey a Jointure to
his Wife, and die, that after the Wife may refuse the Jointure, Refusal of
Jointure.
and demand her Dower at the Common Law. Also that by refusal in the Country,
she may wave her Jointure, and hold her to her Dower, and that this is a
sufficient Election. Also they held that if a man makes a Jointure to his Wife
during the Coverture, Devise for Jointure.
and after by his Testament devises other Lands to her in stead of her
Jointure, that she may refuse the Jointure, and hold her to the Devise, and
that this shall be good by the Statute, (and yet Gaudy moved to the contrary,
because the Statute is, that she may refuse the Jointure and hold her to the
Dower,) but the three Justices overruled it clearly, and said, that such was
the meaning of the Statute, No wayving after agreement.
but they agreed, that if she have once agreed to the Jointure, that she cannot
waive it afterward. Also they agreed that if a Wife do once refuse her
Jointure in her own house amongst her servants, and not to the Heir, that yet
this is a good Refusal. And Peryam said for Law, that where a Jointure is
conveyed to the Wife during the Coverture, Refusal by bringing Dower.
and after the death of her Husband she say nothing, but brings a Writ of
Dower, that this is a good Refusal, and so he has seen in experience.

7.
AN Action upon the case was brought by John Cuttes against an ancient
Attorney of the Court, Slander.
for these words, viz. John Cutts was one of those which robbed Humphrey
Robbins. And they were at issue, and it was found for the Plaintiff. And it was
alleged in arrest of Judgment, that the words were spoken in Queen Mary's
time, as appears by the Declaration. And yet the opinion of the Court was,
that he should have his Judgment, allthough peradventure robberies were
pardoned by Parliament after that time.

8.
CArleton brought Entry sur disseisin against Carre, Abatement for part.
who for part pleaded that he had nothing but in Right of his Wife, not named,
etc. and so demanded Judgment of the Writ, and for the rest he pleaded in bar,
and they joined issue for both, and the Jury appeared at the bar, and found
both the issues for the Defendant. And now the question was, whether the Writ
shall abate for all or no, because for part it was found that the Defendant had
nothing but in right of his Wife, or whether it shall abate but for this part
only? And Shuttleworth argued that it should abate for part only, and he
resembled it to Joyntenancy, in which case it shall abate but in part, and he
cited Dier. 291. and 7 R. 2. titulo joint. 8. and E. 1. titulo brief 860.
Several Tenancy.
And VValmisley said, that it was more like to a several Tenancy, in which
case all shall abate, as in non tenure; but Peryam said to him, put a case,
where several Tenancy shall abate all the Writ.

Anderson Joyntenancy, and seized in right of his Wife is all one to this
effect and intent, Joyntenancy.
for in Joyntenancy he confesses that he is sufficient enough, but that
another has right as well as himself also. And so where he confesses that he
is seized in right of his Wife, he confesses that he is Tenant, but that
another ought to be named with him.


Peryam True it is, that there is no difference concerning this purpose and
intent, and if the Recovery be had against the Husband sole, he shall be bound,
And at length, all the Justices agreed, that the Writ shall abate but in part,
and that Judgment shall be given for the rest, and so for that residue the
Judgment was, nihil capiat per breve. vide 3 Hen. 4. 2. 13 Eliz. fol. 301.


9.
AT this day Walmisley prayed Judgment in the Quare impedit for the Queen.
Lapse.


Anderson we are all agreed that the Queen shall have Judgment for the reason
of the mischief; For otherwise, when the Queen has a Lapse divolved unto her,
one shall be Presented, and afterward deprived, so that the Queen shall never
have her Lapse. And it differs much from the case of that avoidance which
comes by the Act of God; for this is by the Act of the party, and the refore
Covenous. And so let Judgment be entered for the Queen.


10.
A Writ was (ad respondendum I. S. and Fidei uxori ejus) and the Defendant
pleaded in abatement of the Writ, because the name of the Wife was Faith in
English, therefore they pretended that it should be Fidi.

Rodes I know a Wife which is called Troth in English, and she was called
Trothia in Latin, and it was good.


And all the Court adjudged this Writ good here.

11.
AN Action upon the Statute of Winch. was brought against a hundred in
Gloucester, Hue and (...).
and the Jury found a special Verdict, viz. that the money was delivered to a
Carrier of Bristow, to be carried to London, who packed it up; And as he was on
his journey, certain Malefactors came to him, in an another Hundred, and there
took his Horse and Pack, and led him into a Wood, within this Hundred, against
which the action is brought. And if this Hundred be guilty or no, they prayed
the advice of the Court; And all the Justices agreed, that this was a robbery
in the first Hundred, and not in the second, for upon the first taking he was
robbed; but if the Carrier had led the Horse himself, Possession.
then it should be adjudged to be in his own possession, and no robbery until
he came into the second Hundred, and if a man have money, and the Malefactors
take him in one Hundred, and carry him unto another. Hundred, and there Rifle
him, this shall not be a robbery in the first, but only in the second Hundred,
for he is allwaies in possession, per totam Curiam, and Judgment was given
accordingly. So of the purse picked in the Kings Bench, and the thief taken
with the manner, but a key being fastened to the purse, still stuck in the
pocket, and 2 Justices against two, that the man was still in possession of his
purse, and so no robbery.

12.
WAlmisly showed, Termor.
how a woman brought Dower against her two daughters and another, and in truth
the third was but a Termer, and the Wife has no cause of dower but that this
was only to make the Termer to lose his term, for they all have made default
at the grand cape, and now he prayed to be received, and showed cause that the
Husband made a lease for years, and after the Lessee levied a fine to the
Lessor, and they granted and rendered back again to the Lessee for the same
years rendering the same rent, and the Statute of Gloucester is, if the Farmour
have, etc. that is, if he may have covenant, as in 19 Ed. 3. and here he may
have covenant, Ejectione firm.
and prayed to be received, and showed his plea.

Shuttleworth You are at no mischief, for you shall have an ejectione firm if
you be ousted, where she has no cause of Dower.


Walmisley But we shall be put out of possession, which shall be no reason.


Anderson I hold that a Termer may falsify by the Common law. Falsify.



Shuttleworth But his lease is after our title of dower. Lesser may plead
destruction of dower.



Peryam although that it be after, yet if he have matter which goes in
destruction of the Dower, he shall falsify well enough, as if she have title of
Dower and five years pass after the fine levied.


And Anderson and Peryam said that the Statute of Gloucester was made that a
Termer should not be put out of possession, but here the Termer is named, ideo
quare, And after at another day Shuttleworth moved it again, Resceit of the
party to the Writ.
and said that the Termer shall not be received, because he is named in the
Writ, and the Court was of the same opinion then, but they said that he might
plead special non tenure.

Shuttleworth first he ought to save his default, for he comes in upon the
grand cape. Rodes by 33 H. 6. 2. he may plead non tenure before default saved
by Prisot there.


Shuttleworth Then I shall have judgment against the two which made default at
the grand cape. Conusance



Curia you had best be advised, lest the Writ should abate by non tenure of
parcel. Cemurier



Shuttleworth by my Conusance of non tenure of parcel, Difference.
all shall abate, but if I demurr upon his plea, then it shall abate but for
one parcel.


13.
LEonard White brought a Formdon in Discender, and declared of a gift in tail
made to his father, Estoppell.
who died, and the land descended to the elder brother of the Demandant, who
also died without Issue, and so conveyed to himself as heir in tail, etc. The
Tenant pleaded that the elder brother had Issue a Daughter, who levied a fine
to him, and he relied upon the fine and proclamation. Inducement does (...)
make a plea double.


Walmisly this Plea is double, the one is the Issue, the other the fine.


Curia forasmuch as he cannot come to the one without showing the other, it
shall not be double, and also here he relieth upon the Estopple, vide 18. E. 3.
25. Tit. Guard. per Wylly.


14.
A Formdon in descend by three brethren for lands in Gavelkind, they were at
Issue upon Assetz descended to the Demandants, Assets in Gavelkind.
And the Jury found a special Verdict, that the Father of the Demandant was
seized of those lands, and by his Testament devised them to his three sons
now Demandants, and to their heirs equally to be divided, And if this shall be
said a descent to them or no was the question, because the Law would have done
as much, and therefore it shall be said Assetz. But all the Court held the
contrary, and that they shall be joynt-Tenants or Tenants in common, and then
they shall not be in by the descent, and so no Assetz; and Anderson said, that
if a man devise to his son and heir in tail, he shall not take it by descent.

Peryam if a man may have any more benefit by the Devise than by the descent,
then he shall take by the Devise, Eadem lex per Curiam if he devise his lands
to his two daughters and heirs, they shall be joynt-Tenants and no
coparceners, e contra if he have but one son or one daughter only.


15.
IN the Exchequer Chamber all the Justices of the Common Pleas, and the Barons
of the Exchequer, Venus.
were assembled according to the Statute of 27. Eliz. to reform errors in the
Kings bench. And Smaleman of the inner Temple showed how an Action of Debt was
brought upon an Obligation against one Cheney as administrator, who pleaded
plene administravit, and the action was laid in Barkshire at Newbery, and the
Plaintiff averred that the Defendant had Assetz at Westwood in the same County,
and the venire facias was of Newberry, whereas it should have been of Westwood.
And this he assigned for Error, And all the Court agreed una voce that it was
Error, and so the judgment was reversed, but the Assetz being transitory might
have been assigned at Newbery.

17.
ANother Writ of Error was there brought by the Lord Seymour against Sr. John
Clifton upon a judgment given against him, Amendment.
and assigned for error that the judgment was quod recuperet versus Edward.
Seymour, and did not say praedict. Edward. Seymour. And all the Justices agreed
that this was amendable, And so the first judgment was affirmed.

18.
ANother Writ of Error was there brought upon a judgment which Rawlyns had to
recover lands in the Kings bench, Rent suspenpended.
and the Case was such. A man makes a lease of ten acres for ten years
rendering rent upon a Condition; the Lessee grants 5. acres thereof to a
stranger for five years; and after grants the residue of the years in the five
acres to the Lessor. And after the Lessee broke the Condition, whereby the
Lessor re-entred; and if he may do so, or if the Condition was suspended, or
no, was the question, because he accepted a future interest in parcel; Future
interest. Tenant wayves
for it was adjudged in the Kings bench that the Condition was not suspended,
and now this was assigned for error, And all the Justices (except. Anderson and
Peryam) held that it is not suspended before he had entered by force of his lease

Anderson If I make a lease (as here) upon Condition and waive the possession,
this may be suspended before his entry.


Cook This is another case.


Peryam But the reason thereof comes well to this case; And afterward
because the said two Justices dis-assented from the rest, it was adjourned over.


19.
ANother Writ of Error was there brought upon a judgment given in the Kings
bench. Trover.
And Cook the famous Utter-Barrester of the Inner-tem moved this question to
the Justices. If a man lose his goods, which come to the hands of another, and
he converteth them to his own use, and after the owner dye, Day and place of
conversion.
whether his Executors shall have an action of the Case for this Trover, and
whether he ought to show the place and the day of the Conversion, or no; And
the Counselors at the bar said that he ought to show both, for so it was
adjudged, where an Alderman of London brought an action upon the Case against
oue Staynsham upon Trover of an Obligation, and it was found that he had broken
the seals, etc. and because he did not show the time and place of the
Conversion, he could never get Judgment. And now the Justices were of the same
opinion, but yet Anderson seemed to doubt.

Peryam Executors at the Common Law shall not have Trespass for a Trespass done
in the life of their Testator, and the doubt is if they shall have an Action
upon the Case.


Manwood if a man has another in Execution for debt, and the Jailer suffer him
to escape, and after the Recoverer dies, shall his Executors have an action
against the Jailer?


Cook No.


Peryam So it seems. But Anderson Manwood and VVindam clearly to the
contrary, and that they shall have debt upon this Escape.


Cook But not an Action upon the Case at the Common Law; and here by his own
showing he might have Trespass vi and armis, and therefore not this action.


De Term. Trinitat. An. Reg. Eliz. xxx.
1.
RAlph Heidon brought a Writ of Right against Smethwick and his Wife, Droit.
of two parts of forty Acres of Land in Surret, and they pleaded that one
Ibgrave was seized, and devised it to his Wife, now one of the Tenants for term
of her life, the remainder to Benjamin Ibgrave in fee, Praying aid in an Assise.
which was his heir, and dyed, and they prayed in aid of B. I. who came and
joined to them, and thereupon they came and pleaded to the grand Assise, and
the first day of this term the Assise appeared, and sixteen were sworn, whereof
four were Knights, and the residue were Squires and Gentlemen, and the title
was all one, as before in T. 28 Eliz. for this same Ibgrave was Tenant in that
other Action for the third part. And the opinion of all the Court clearly, that
it is not aided by the Statute; for there is not any certainty in the Grant;
Name certain.
but if he had given it a certain name, as green Acre, then allthough he had
mistaken the Parish, yet it had been good enough.

Peryam The Assise may go their way, and they did so, and after they being
agreed came again to the Bar, and the Demandant was called, and did not appear,
whereby the Tenant prayed the Court to record the Nonsuit, and it was done.


Curia All is one as if he had appeared; Non-suits.
for this Nonsuit is peremptory for ever; the issue being joined upon the mere
droit, aliter if the issue had been joined upon any collateral point.


2.
IN Trespass by Blunt and Lister against Delabere they were at Issue' and now
the Inquest appeared ready to pass. Challenge.


VValmisley This Inquest you ought not to take, for it is favorably made by
the Sherif, which is within the distress of one of the Plaintifs, and showed,
how the Sherif held certain lands of a Manor now in question, whereof Lister
has possession, and also has certain lands for term of years of him; and the
Plaintifs moved that he ought to take one cause only. 1 Cause.



Curia He may allege both; for the challenge is, that he is within the
distress, and the allegations are but evidence to prove it; and then the
Plaintiff said, not within his distress, whereupon the Court appointed Tryers;
and the Defendant said that all the Jury are favorable, Tryors refused.
and prayed Tryers de circumstantibus.


Gaudy That cannot be, but only in an Assise, and cited 9 Edw. 4.


Curia We cannot appoint other Tryers in this case but only of the Jurors,
wherefore let the fourth and seventh be Tryers, but you may refuse them, and
take others if you will,


and thereupon the Defendant refused the fourth whereby the third was
appointed, and they found the Array favorably made, and therefore it was
quashed.

3.
A Recovery was had by Arthur Mills against Sir Owen Hopton, of diverse lands
twelve years passed, Amendment
and by the negligence of the Attorney, Warranty of Attorney.
no Warrant of Attorney was entered for him, and now suit was made to the
Justices that it might be entered; and they all consented thereunto, and so it
was entered incontinently; but first the party made a corporal Oath, that he
had retained an Attorney, and that this was the negligence of his Attorney.

4.
IN the Exchequer chamber Cook showed that a Writ of Error was brought between
Bedell and Moor, Arbitrament.
and said that there was an Error in the Record, Error not assigned.
which was not assigned, and prayed that it might be examined, allthough that
it was not assigned, because that it appeared in the Record, which was agreed
to by the Court. And then he showed the case, that two had submitted themselves
for all quarrels ultimo die Novembris An. 24. to stand to the Arbitrament of
two others, and they Arbitrated that the Plaintiff in this Writ of Error, should
release to the now Defendant all Actions which he might have against him until
the 24 of June then next following, which was half a year after, and because he
had not performed this, an action upon an Assumpsit was brought, and Judgment
given for the Plaintiff, and all the Justices agreed that this was Error,
because that this thing arbitrated was out of the submission, and so void; for
they have no authority to arbitrate that which is not submitted unto them,
Submission.
and the submission is only of things passed, and not to come; but because
that the Defendant had not heard of this Error before, therefore they gave him
day. Afterward the case was moved again; and Anderson said that damages
recovered do not lie in arbitrament. Damages recovered.


Peryam Amongst other things they will lie well enough, quod Anderson non
negavit. But they all said, that they may well assume upon consideration, and
an Action will be maintainable for it.


5.
THomas Mounson Esquire, Term extinguished.
son and heir apparent to Sir John Mounson, Knight, brought an Action of
Trespass against West, who pleaded not guilty, and upon Evidence it appeared,
that Sir John Mounson had an estate for years, the Remainder in tail to the
Plaintiff, with diverse Remainders over, and the Lessee made a Feoffment to
diverse, and a Letter of Attorney to others, with commission to enter into the
lands, and to seal the Feoffment, and deliver it in his name to the use of the
said Thomas and his heirs, and another by commandment, or Letter of Attorney
of the said Thomas entered in his name. And the Court held this a good
Feoffment, notwithstanding that both the Lessee and the Attorney were
disseisors; Disseisors.
for it is good between the Feoffor, and the Feoffee; for they said that by the
Feoffment to the use of him in the remainder and his heirs, if he in remainder
enter, he is remitted, and the estate for years is gone implicatively; Freehold
joined to the term. Morgage.
for Peryam said, that in all cases where the Freehold comes to the term,
there the term is extinguished. And therefore if a man morgage his reversion to
the Lessee for years, and after perform the condition, yet the Lease for years
is utterly extinguished: And the Evidence on both parts was very long, and the
chief matter was, whether a Deed were forged by Rob. Mounson lately one of the
Justices of the Common Pleas; by which Devise lands were conveyed to him by
William Mounson his Father, whose heir at the Common Law Sir John Mounson is,
viz. the Son of Roberts eldest brother, and the Deed was showed by West, and
it was perished with Mice, all the Seal, and part of every side; but yet by the
last Will of the said William Mounson, and by diverse other proofs, it was
evident that the Deed was good, and but little in effect was showed to prove
the Deed forged; Misdemenour.
yet the Jury went together, and tarryed there all night, and in the mean time
some of them had victuals with them; for one had Cheese, and another had
Pruens, another had Pippins, and another had an Orange, but he which had the
Orange swore that he brought it only for the smell, and therefore he was
excused; and he which had Pruens, had given half a Pruen to one of his
companions, which eat it, and he which had Cheese had eat thereof, therefore
all those which had victuals, Fine and imprisonment.
were fined at 40 s. and they which had eaten at 5 l. every of them, and all
committed to the Fleet; but because they were agreed, therefore the Verdict was
taken, and the Verdict was given for the Plaintiff, viz. that the Deed was
forged by Justice Mounson, and the Verdict taken de been esse, and all this
matter commanded to be entered; for the Justices doubted whether it were a good
Verdict. This matter was moved diverse Terms afterward, and at the last
adjudged a good Verdict.

6.
IN an Ejectione firm by Ashby against Laver for Lands in Westminster,
Countermand.
it was said by all the Justices to the Jury, that if a man has a Lease, and
disposes of it by his will, and after surrenders it, and takes a new Lease,
and after dies, that the Devisee shall not have this last Lease, because this
was a plain countermand of his Will.

7.
IN Trespass by Johnson against Astley, it was said by the Justices to the
Jury, that if there were a Chauntery in reputation, allthough it be none in
right (as if it be gone by disseisin) yet the Queen shall have the Lands.

8.
AT Serjeants-Inne in Fleet Street, Rent suspended.
the Justices of the Common Pleas, and Barons of the Exchequer, were assembled
for diverse Errors in the King's Bench, and the case of Rawlins was moved again,
and Anderson and Peryam retained their former opinions, and Peryam said, that
he would differ from all the cases of collateral conditions, Feoffment upon
condition.
which may be put; for he said that if a man make a Feoffment in fee of 20
Acres of land, upon condition, that if he pay to the Feoffee xx l. at Easter,
that then it shall be lawful for him to re-enter, allthough that he be
re-enfeoffed of 10 Acres, yet he ought to perform the condition, because it is
collateral. But Cook the famous Utter-barrister said, Truly it has been
adjudged to the contrary, and I was privy to it; for when he took as high an
estate again as he had before, by that the condition is confounded, and the
case of the Corody in 20 Ed. 4. will prove this case.

Rodes I see no diversity.


Peryam It is collateral there, but so it is not here, but afterward those
two Judges changed their opinions, and so the first Judgment was affirmed.


9.
BRown recovered against Garbrey in an Assumpsit, Consideration.
and thereupon Garbrey brought a Writ of Error, and assigned for Error, that
there was no Consideration; for the Declaration was, that whereas there was a
communication between Brown and a woman, for Marriage between them, that the
Father of Brown had promised to the Wife, that if she would marry his Son, he
would make a Feoffment of his land to the use of himself for life, and after to
the use of them two in tail, the remainder, etc. and that Garbrey assured to
the Wife in consideratione praemissorum, that if the Father did not do so,
then he would give the Wife a hundred pound; ac licet, the Father did not give
to them in tail, secund. agreament. praedict. yet Garbrey refused, etc. And
Cook moved that this should be no Consideration; for the communication of
Marriage was not by him, but between strangers to him; but if the Father had
assumed in consideration of Marriage, then that should have been good against
the Father; but against Garbrey it is ^o otherwise than as if one promise to
you to Enteoff you, and I say that if he do not so, then I will give you a
hundred pound, this is without consideration, and so here. But the Justices
held the contrary, and that the consideration is good; for in considerations
praemissorum, is in consideration of the Marriage, as well as of the refusal of
the Father; and also it was alleged, that Garbrey was Cosen German to Brown,
and therefore, etc.

Anderson If a communication be between two, and the Father promise to make a
Jointure, and a stranger say that if the Father will not, then he will do it,
this is a good consideration; and there is no necessity to be so curious in the
consideration; for that is not traversable. Consideration executory traversable.
But Cook said, that if it be Executory, then it is traversable.


Another Error Cook assigned, because they had not alleged a not performance in
the Father; for the promise of the Father was to make a Feoffment to the use,
etc. and they aver that allthough that he did not make a gift in tail, which
cannot be the same thing which the Father should do; for an estate to use in
tail, and a gift in tail is not all one. But the Justices held it good, for by
the Statute of 27 H. 8. the use is executed, and so the estate executed. Also
the Declaration was that he had not made a gift in tail secundum agreamentum
praedictum. But Cook moved that it should not be good, for if a man be bound to
make an estate to another in the per, and he make it in the post, this is no
performance, and here by the Statute he is in, in the post, and the not
performance is alleged to be, because he did it not in the per, and says, that
he which is in by the Statute, shall not vouch, for he is in, in the post, and
he cited Winters case, which was not denied; but Peryam said, that
considerations in actions upon the Case, and Conditions, are not all one.

9.
IN the Kings bench the case was such, Coppyhold.
John Kipping being a Copiholder, devised it to his Wife for life, the
Remainder to William his son in Fee, and made a Surrender to that use, and the
Wife is admitted generally, General admittance.
now if this be an admittance of him in Remainder also, was the question. And
Godfrey argued that it was not, for it is not like to the case of descent,
where the reversion should have descended, for in this case William cannot
Surrender before admittance, but he agreed that one which has it by descent
may surrender before admittance for in that case it shall be said possessio
fratris, Surrender.
but when it is by purchase then that cannot be surrendered, whereof admittance
ought to be, Meseu.
because the Lord ought to have a fine of him, and therefore he likened it to
the case in 18 E. 4. where the Mesne graunts the Mesnality for life, the
remainder in fee, and the Tenant attornes to the Tenant for life, if he had
cause of acquittance against the Mesne this shall not be an attornment to him
in remainder; so here, if this shall be good to him in remainder then is the
Lord without remedy for his fine. Vesting of a remainder.
But Cook the famous Utter-Barrister argued to the contrary; for the Remainder
vested when the particular estate vested, or else it shall never vest, but it
shall not be void, ergo it is excuted when the particular estate, etc. And
therefore he said clearly that an admittance of the particular Tenant is an
admittance of him in Remainder, and that the Lord cannot have his fine, if it
be agreed that the Heir may surrender before admittance, Scire facias upon a
fine.
and yet the Lord ought to have a fine of him. And in 7 Ric. 2. Fitzherbert
scire facias 3. where Tenant for life sueth execution, this is an execution for
him in Remainder. Audita quaerela
And in Fitzherbert. Na. Br. fol. 201. where one devises for life, the
Remainder in tail, and an ex gravi querela was sued, this shall serve as well
for Tenant in Remainder as for Tenant for life, Attornment.
and 18 Ed. 4. 7. and the time of Ed. 4. Fitzherbert Attorn. 21. that
attornment to the Tenant for life is good to him in Remainder and VVeldons case
in the Commentaries, Assent to the Devisee.
that assent to the Devisee for life, is an execution of the devise to him in
the Remainder.

11.
THe case of the Resceit was moved again, Resceit.
and Shuttleworth said, that he cannot be resceived because he is named in the
Writ, And said, that he had searched all the books, and there is not one Case
where he which is named in the Writ, may be resceived.

Anderson What of that? Reason.
shall not we give judgment because it is notadjudged in the books before?
we will give judgment according to reason, and if there be no reason in the
books, I will not regard them.


Shuttleworth He is at no mischief here, for in 33 H. 6. the Tenant came at
the grand cape, and said that he had nothing, Nihil habet.
and the Court said that it was no plea, for if he has nothing he can lose
nothing, And so here, if he be ousted where he has good right, Reentrie.
he may re-enter, and falsify the recoverie.


Peryam But he shall be put out of possession, which is a mischief and remedied
by the Statute.


Shuttleworth I hold clearly that a Termer cannot falsify at the Common Law,
because a term was not regarded.


Peryam The books doubt thereof, but Anderson seemed to assent to Shuttleworth,
and that the Covyn shall be traversable,


which Peryam denied clearly, and said that he ought to averr the Covyn.

12.
A Man was condemned in an action of Debt, and brought an Audita querela upon a
release, Supersedeas.
and had a supersedeas.

Peryam If the Sherif take him before that he has notice of the Writ, although
it be after the Test, yet it is well done, but otherwise of an Utlary.


But Fenner and Walmisley held to the contrary, and Fenner said that he had
seen a President to the contrary.

13.
AN Action upon the Case was brought against Matthew late Undersheriff of
Hampshire, Declaration double.
that where an Execution was directed to him, by virtue whereof he had taken
goods to the value of the execution, and sold them for less, and that he has
not returned the Writ; and upon this Declaration the Defendant demurred in law,
because it was alleged to be double. But Fenner held the contrary, and said,
that an Action upon the Case is like to an Action of Covenant, where a man may
show all the covenants broken.

Curia If the one matter be depending upon the other, it shall not be double,
and here all is, Dependence is not double.
for not retourning of the same Writ.


Wherefore Fenner said, that he would not amend his Declaration, let the other
Demur if he would, (sed quaere) for the Declaration ought to agree with the
Writ.

14.
A Writ of false Judgment was brought upon a Judgment given in a Court of the
Deane and Chapter of Westminster, Administrators.
in an Action upon the case brought against one as Administrator; And did not
show by whom the Administration was committed, which he ought to have done by
32 Hen. 6. and 35 Hen. 6. 50. a. and the Assumpsit was laid to be in
consideration that Assets came to the hands of the Defendant, And whether this
were a good consideration, was another doubt, and it was not averred that the
Administrators had goods sufficient after the Debts and Legacies were paid. And
at this day it was held, that when an Action is brought against an
Administrator, it need not be showed; but in an Action brought by them clearly,
they ought to show it. And for the other matter, whether the Plaintiff needed to
aver that they had Assets besides the Debts, etc. it was said, that this ought
to come and be shown on the other part. And for that Woodwards case in the
Commentaries was cited. And the next morning Puckering showed, that he had a
report of a Judgment given in the Kings Bench, that it is not necessary to
show that they had Assets besides the Debts and Legacies, etc. And therefore he
prayed that the Judgment may be affirmed. And so it was, for Rodes had seen
the report of Puckering, according to his saying, and testified the same,
whereby Judgment was here given against the Administrator, Anderson being in
the Starchamber.

15.
IT was agreed by all the Justices, Herriot.
that for a Herrio^ service, the Lord cannot distrein out of his Fee, no more
than for a Rent, but he may seize a Herriot Custom out of his Fee.

16.
A Man was outlawed, Vtlary.
and the Sherif returned the Proclamation (tali die omnes and singulas
proclam. fieri feci) And did not show that such a day he made the first, and
such a day the second, etc. and this was assigned for Error, and prayed that
the Utlary night be reversed, and so it was.

17.
FLeetwood showed that this case came in pleading. Rent-service.
A man had a Rent service payable at the Feast of St. Michael, And on
Michaelmas day he died about ten of the clock in the morning; now he demanded
whether his Heir or his Executor shall have the Rent?

Anderson Has he not all the day to pay it? and upon condition to pay such a
sum, he may tender it any time before Sunset.


Peryam But if the party accept the payment in the morning, it is good.


Curia If it be a case in this Court, you ought to demur as your case is, and
not to be thus Politic.


18.
A Writ of Error was brought upon a Judgment in the Kings Bench, Abatement.
and one of the parties died, hanging the Writ; And the Court held this to be
an abatement of the Writ, and that he ought to purchase a new Writ.

De Term. Mic. Anno Reg. Eliz. xxx. and xxxj.
1.
AFormdon was brought against Haselwood and Haselwood, Abatement.
and the one took the Tenancy of the one Moity, Dier 3. and 4. Phil. and Mar.
134.
Absque hoc that the other had any thing therein, and pleaded in abatement of
the Writ, and the other took the Tenancy of the other Moity, and vouched.

Shut. Shall I maintain my Writ, or answer to the Bar of the other?


Tota Curia You must needsmaintain your Writ.


Anderson Where the pleading is such, as your Writ cannot be good, there it is
a ground that you ought to maintain your Writ; Praecipe quod reddat.
but if a praecipe quod reddat be brought against two, and the one plead
Nontenure, and the other accepts the entire Tenancy, Absque hoc, etc. and does
plead in Bar, there you may answer to the Bar, because there peradventure the
Writ is good, notwithstanding; As if a Writ be brought against the Feoffor and
Feoffee upon condition, or Morgagor and Morgagee; and so there is a diversity.


2.
IN a Quare impedit brought by the Queen against the Archbishop the disturber,
Vtlary.
and the Incumbent, the disturber pleaded, that long time before he had any
thing in the Advowson, by whose Utlary the Queen is entitled, King Ed. 4. was
seized of the Honor of Haststings, and granted it to the Lord Hastings in Fee.
and further granted omnia bona and catalla omnium teneutium ejusdem honoris
sive manerii residentium and non residentium qui forent utlagati, etc. and so
conveyes the Honor by descent to the now Lord Hastings, and did not aver that
he which was Utlawed, Averment.
was a Tenant of the Honor.

Curia It is not good without doubt, for otherwise he is not within compass of
the Grant, and therefore a day was given, by which, if the Defendant did not
show better matter, the Queen should have Judgment.


3.
IN the Kings Bench Anne Bucher brought an Ejectione Firm against Auncell
Samford, Devise.
and other Defendants, Gloucester.
And upon not guilty pleaded, Hit. 30. Eliz. rot. 188.
the Jury found a special Verdict, viz. that William Samford was seized of the
Manor of Stone-house in the Parish of S. whereof the Tenements in demand were
parcel, and of diverse other Tenements within the same Parish, and within a
place known in the same Parish, which is neither Town nor Hamlet, called Ebney,
in which Samford had a Tenement, which has Lands time out of mind perteining
thereunto, lying as well in Ebney as in Stone-house, which Tenement is in the
Tenure of one Bucher by Copy of Court-roll, according to the custom of the
Manor, Afterward William Samford devises to his Brother, after the death of
Bucher, all that my Tenement with the Appurtenances wherein Bucher dewlleth in
Ebney, Now the question was, whether the Lands in Stone-house perteining
thereunto shall pass or no? And the famous Cook argued that it should pass, for
this word Tenement refers to his dwelling which is in Ebney, and not to the
place where the Lands lie, And therefore he said that words ought to have
relation, ut ne impediatur sententia, sed ut res magis valeat quam pereat,
Quare impedit.
and he cited 4 Ed. 3 in a Quare impedit quod permittat praesentare ad
ecclesiam de Mourton Majorem, and the Defendant demanded Judgment of the Writ
for false latin, because of Majorem, and yet it was adjudged good, for it shall
be referred to ecclesiam, and he cited 19 Ed. 3. and 3 Ed. 4. Also it passes
by this word appurtenances; for there was such a Chambridgshire case here
within this Twelvemonth, where a man gave instructions to another to make his
Will in this form, I will that B. shall have my House, with all my Lands
thereto apperteining; And the other made it in these words, I devise to B. my
house, with the Appurtenances; and it was adjudged that the Land should pass by
this words Appurtenances. For allthough that in late Books, Lands shall not
pass by this word Appurtenances, yet this is good authority to prove that they
shall pass, as 7 Hen. 5. 41. and T. 21 Ed. 3. 18. Also Wills shall be taken by
meaning, and here upon this devise 4. l. Rent is reserved, and the ancient Rent
is but 45. s. and if the Land should be racked, it is all worth but v. l. a
year, and because they are held in Capite, therefore by the Statute we shall
have but two parts. And it cannot be intended that it was his meaning to have
us pay 4. l. for the Lands in Ebney, Value.
which are not worth so much, therefore sometime the value is considerable in a
Will, and cited 4 Ed. 6. and 7 Ed. 6. and so he thought the Plaintiff ought to
recover. And at this time the Court seemed to be of the same opinion, for they
gave day over to the Defendant, at which day, if nothing were said, Judgment
shall be given for the Plaintiff.

4.
Gaudy prayed Judgment in an Action of Trespass by Hambledon against
Hambledon, Survivor.
the case was such. H. was seized in Fee, and had issue, Mic. 29. and 30
three Sons, Eliz. r^t. 2325.
John, William now Plaintiff, and Richard now Defendant, And by his last Will
devised Lands to John, and to the Heirs Males of his body engendered, and
devised other Lands to William in like sort, and other Lands to Richard in like
sort, And that if any of his Sons died without issue Male, that then the
Survivor shall be each others Heir, Afterward the eldest died without issue
Male, And if William shall have all his part alone, or else he and Richard
between them, was demurred in Law, and day was given over to argue it.

5.
WAlmisley showed how an Action was brought by Berdsley against Pilkington,
Impounding.
upon the Statute of 2 and 3 P. and Mary, for driving a Distress out of the
County, And showed the truth of his case, that the Distress was taken in the
Hundred of Offlay in Staffordshire, and the City of Lichfield was sometime
within this Hundred, And by Letters Patents of 1 Mariae, the City was made a
County of it self, and he which took the Distress impounded them within a pound
in the County of the City of Lichfield; now whether he has incurred the
penalty of the Statute, or no, was the question? And because the Court had not
a Statute Book there, to see the Preamble, therefore they would give no
resolution.

Anderson The meaning of the Statute was, because the Bailif of the Hundred
might make deliverance. Also I think it is within the compass of the Statute,
because the City was a County severed before this Statute made.


And the Sergeants at the bar said, Same Hundred.
that the party may drive the Distress as far as he will within the same
Hundred, but he ought not to drive it above three miles without the Hundred.

6.
John Slywright exhibited an information upon the Statute, Champerty.
for buying of Titles, Pasch. 30. Eliz. rot. 1532.
against Page, and declared how Joane Wade demised to Page for 60 years; the
Defendant pleaded not guilty; And now a Jury of Sussex appeared at the bar. And
upon Evidence it was moved, ^if a man have a lawful Title to enter into Lands,
Lawful title.
but has not been in Possession, and he enters and makes a Lease for years
thereof, if this be within compass of the Statute.

Anderson It is within the Statute, for the mischief was, that when a man had a
Title to Land, he would let it to another, to have maintenance and imbracery,
and make contentions, and Suites, for remedy whereof the Statute was made. For
if a man have a Title, he may recover according to his Title. Recovery.



Peryam The mischief has been truly recited, and therefore it is reason to
restrain such bargains. But if a man Recover by Formdon or Cessavit, and make a
Lease, this is not within compass of the Statute, A pretended Right.
allthough that he has not been in Possession by a year; and in my opinion the
Plaintiff need not prove that it is a pretented Right, because the Statute
expounds what is a pretented Right, viz. if he has not been in possession.
And so I have delivered my opinion before this time.


Anderson If a man has not been in Possession, and comes to me, and says,
that he will make me a Lease, and demands if I will take it, and I agree
thereto, whereby he makes me this Lease, Ignorance.
if I do not know that he has not been in possession, I am not within the
Statute.


And then the Defendant showed that he was brother of the halfblood to the Wife
of the Lessor, whereby he might take the Lease well enough. For Fleetwood cited
6 Ed. 3. if one brother maintain the other, this is not within the Statute of
Champerty, which case the Court agreed, this is for special cause. vide
statut. de articulis super cartas. Maintenance Champerty Difference,


Anderson One brother may travel for another, and maintain him, but if he take
a Lease of him, he is within the Statute of 32. Hen. 8. for this is a general
mischief, and the mischief is as great, if the brother take a Lease, as if
another take it, The case.



quod Periam coucessit clearly, but because it was the case of the Defendant,
the Jury found a special Verdict, viz. that the Lands were conveyed by the
Husband of Joane Wade, to the use of himself and his Wife in Tail-speciall, the
Remainder to the Husband in generall-Tail, the Remainder to the Wife in Fee,
and after the Husband Enfeoffed diverse men thereof, and the Feoffees continued
in Possession diverse years, After the Husband died, and then the Wife by
indenture sealed and delivered, of the Land, made a Lease to Page which knew
all this matter, Knowledge.
from the fifth day of Jenuary last past, for 60 years, if the Wife should live
so long, and that the Wife was Sister to Page the Defendant by the Mother, and
found the value of the Land as if it should be sold, and they prayed the advice
of the Court, etc.

And the morrow after, the like information being brought against the woman
being Lessor, the like Evidence was given, and the like case found.

7.
FEnner moved this case to the Court. Recovery.
An Alien born purchases Lands in Tail, the Remainder to a stranger in Fee;
The Alien suffers a Common Recovery to his own use in Fee, And after an
Office is found of all this matter, if the Remainder shall be to him which had
it before or no was the question.

Anderson I think the Queen shall have a good Fee-simple, Tenant sufficient to
the praecipe.
for if there be a good Tenant to the praecipe, then is the Remainder gone, and
you will not deny but that he is Tenant sufficient before Office found.


Fenner True, Sir, but when the Office is found, by relation thereof the
Recovery is avoided. Relation.



Anderson Truly the Office has relation for the Possession of the Alien, but
it has no such relation to say that the Alien never had it, for then the Queen
shall not have it; but if the Alien were Tenant sufficient at the time of the
Writ brought against him, then the Remainder is utterly gone.


And all the Justices said that it is a strong case that the Queen shall have
it, and that the Remainder is gone. And Rodes cited 27 Ass. fol. 50.

8.
PLympton brought an Action of Trespass against Dobynet, Copyhold.
the Defendant pleaded, that the place in which, etc. is Copyhold, and pleaded
a Grant to Southey, which granted it to him, etc. The Plaintiff replied, that
long time before the Grant pleaded by the Defendant, Alice Gooding was Lessee
for life, secundum consuetudinem manerii. etc. and that the Custom is, that the
Lord may grant Copies as well in Reversion as in Possession. And that in 5
Eliz. the Lord Morley being Lord of the Manor, The Lord Morleys case.
granted to him a Copy in Remainder before the grant made to Southey, which now
came in Possession, and that he entered, until, etc. The Defendant rejoyned
that there is a custom in the Manor, that the Lord may grant Copies in
reversion, with the agreement and consent of the Tenant in possession; and if
any Copies be granted, without consent of the Tenant in possession, that then
there is such a custom, that such Grants shall be altogether void, absque hoc,
that they are devisable modo and forma, etc. whereupon the Plaintiff demurred in
Law.

Walmisley This Plea of the Defendant is repugnant; for by these words, If any
be granted, he implies, that there is such a custom; and then when he says
absque hoc that there is such a custom, this traverse is void, and the Plaintiff
shall have Judgment, by 9 H. 6.


Also he argued that this custom shall be void, and cited 19 Ass. the case of
the command of St John's, and 2 Hen. 4. and 19 Eliz. Custom what it is.
the Ejectione firm by Bill anu Attorney; and he defined usage to be,
Constitutio ex diversis actionibus saepius iteratis. Shuttelworth argued to the
contrary, and cited 37 Hen. 6. the case of Common, and 26 Ed. 3.

9.
Gaudy the Queens Sergeant rehearsed the case of Beverley in this manner;
Utlary.
Thomas Beverley brought a Quare impedit against the Ordinary, and Gabriell
Cornewell the Incumbent, which was in, of the presentation of the Queen; and
upon pleading, there was a Demurrer entered up, and before that was discussed,
Beverley was Outlawed at the suit of another, The Case.
in an Action of Debt; then Cornwell resigned his Benefice, and the Queen
presented him again, whereupon he was instituted and inducted; Then Beverley
brought a Writ of Error in the King's Bench, and reversed the Outlary, because
that he was named of Hamby, where there were two Towns of the same name, and
neither of them without an addition, and now he brought a Scire facias to
execute his first judgment against Cornwell, who pleaded all the matter in
bar, and it seemed to him that the Plaintiff shall be barred; for by the Outlary
of the Plaintiff, the presentation was forfeited to the Queen, allthough that it
was but a thing in action, and thereupon he cited 2 Hen. 5. where a man had a
Patronage with his Wife, Patronage in right of his wife.
and was Outlawed, etc. then, if by the reversall of the Outlary, he shall be
restored to the presentation; and he said that he shall not, for that it was a
thing once lawfully executed, and vested in the Queen, and he cited 4 Hen. 7.
where a man is attainted by Act of Parliament, etc. Also the opinion of Brian
there, is a strong proof of this case. And further he said, that he was of
counsel with a case in 26 Eliz. Restitution after a Scire fa^^
where Debt was brought by Hanmer against Luddington, and the Defendant was
condemned, and a Fieri facias issued to the Sherif, who by virtue thereof sold
a term of the Defendants, and levied the money thereupon, and afterward the
Defendant brought a Writ of Error, and refused the Judgment, the question was
if he shall be restored to his term; and it was adjudged, that he shall not,
but only to the money for which it was fold, because the sale was once good,
and so he thought that the Plaintiff ought to be barred.

VValmisley to the contrary: For in our case, Patronage.
when the Queen presents, she has gained a Patronage to her self, until we
recover it again, and this is the case of Ratcliffe, in 35. For so long as the
Incumbent which is presented continues by that Induction in possession, so
long he which presented him is Patron, Possession.
per Collow, in 20 Ed. 4. and by 46 Edw. 3. tit. Incumbent. and 19 Ed. 3. tit.
Quare impedit. If the King bring a Quare impedit, and has title to recover,
yet the other is Patron until his Clerk be removed, a fortiore where the Writ
is brought against the Incumbent of the King, he is Patron until he be
removed, then if nothing shall be forfeit to the Queen, then it is to be
considered, because the Queen has presented the same Defendant of new, whether
he shall be removed or no, Acts done hanging the Writ.
and it seems clearly that he shall, because he claims under this estate,
and this is done hanging the Writ; and no act done hanging the Writ shall
extort the Plaintiff from his execution, and surely the Writ is hanging until
execution be done; and he cited 31 Hen. 6. Attorney.
If one make an Attorney, he shall be Attorney until execution be done; and 21
Hen. 7. if the Defendant resign, and a stranger is presented, hanging the Writ,
yet the Plaintiff shall remove the stranger, Presentment.
and 20 Eliz. in Dyer accords with that, notwithstanding that some there held
the contrary: If he come in by title, by money:
And to the like purpose is the case in 11 Hen. 4. of traverse of an Office.
Then for the Outlary that was avoydable by Plea, Plea by the Statute.
by the Statute of 2 Hen. 5. per the Books, in 22 Hen. 6. and 38 Hen. 6. Then
if by the Outlary reversed he shall be restored, and it seems that he shall;
for a man shall see a great difference between this case and the cases put: For
if a man in an Action deny his Deed, and therefore pay a Fine to the King, if
after he reverse the Judgment, yet he shall not be restored to the Fine,
because it is a by-thing, and a thing collateral, and therefore he denied the
opinion of Brian, Collateral thing
in 4 Hen. 7. for it cannot be Law: But if a man be indebted to me, and after I
am Outlawed, and then the King releaseth this debt, Release of* the King of the
debt of one outlawed.
and then I bring a Writ of Error, and reverse this Outlary, I shall be
restored to my action again. And here he has shown to us a piece of cunning;
for when he pleads the Outlary in us, he has pleaded the Record specially, for
otherwise we would have said, Special pleading.
null tiel record, and then it being reversed it should have been certified for
us, as there is a case in Dyer. Then here, allthough that be in by a new
presentation, yet all the words of our Writ are true in this Scire facias; but
I grant that Executors shall have a Qnare impedit for a disturbance done to
their Testator. Executors shall have a Quare impedit.



Anderson The case in Dyer is thus reported, That I when I was the Queens
Sergeant, and Gerrard now Master of the Rolls, then being Attorney of the
Queen, were of opinion that the Clerk of another shall not be removed, and
concerning that matter, I held then, as I do still, that in some cases the
Clerk shall not be removed, and in some cases he shall; for if he come in under
the title of the Plaintiff, Title peramont.
and since the same, then he shall be removed, but if he come in by title
Paramont he shall not be removed; and here, for that this is done hanging the
Writ, it seems that he shall be removed: For if a man bring a Praecipe, and
hanging the Writ the Tenant alien, yet the recovery is good against him, Tenant
in a Praecipe aliens.
and shall also bind every one under him.


Peryam That point is clear enough, but the question is if by the Outlary the
Plaintiff has forfeited his presentation to the Queen? For if it be so, then
this is a new title for the Queen.


Anderson What reason is there in that? when it was an apparent practice of the
Defendant to resign; for otherwise she could not have presented, Plenarty.
the Church being full before.


Peryam The practice is not good without doubt, but what is the Law?


Anderson The Law is, that the Defendant by his resignation, shall never extort
the Plaintiff from his execution.


Peryam The point is if by the Outlary the Queen have a new title, by reason of
the Plaintiff, and I doubt much thereof, if by the judgment she shall have the
presentation.


Anderson I am resolved that there is not any color in the case, but what say
you?


Rodes Truly I hold that the Plaintiff shall remove the Clerk.


Windham And in my opinion it is clear enough, that by the reversall of the
Outlary the Plaintiff shall have his presentation. Reversal.



Anderson Then let Judgment be entered for the Plaintiff.


Peryam In the name of God, if you be agreed against me.


10.
A Writ of Partition was brought by Henry Tannworth, Partition.
and Christian Tannworth, against John Tannworth their elder brother; for lands
in Hawlesteed, alias, Elsted in Leichestershire, because that Halsteed is
parcel of the Soak of Rothelay, wherein there is such a custom, Members of a
Mann^r.
that the lands shall equally descend to all the heirs males, and in giving of
evidence, Walmisley said that the members of a Manor are other Towns in which
the Manor extends, and Puckering said, Soak quid.
that at this day the Queen may make a Soak: For it is nothing else but a
Precinct, to which diverse Manors come to do suit; and as a great Leet
containing diverse other Courts; and the Evidence was strong for the Tenant; for
he showed by plain proof, that this was never parcel of the Soak, allthough
that it was within the ancient Demeasne of Rothelay, Domesday.
as it was proved by the Book of Domesday, which was there shown, and a Clerk
of the Exchequer read it (for other Clerks could not) and he said, and so said
the Sergeants; and the Tenant delivered to Anderson and Peryam an ancient Book
of the time of Ed. 2. for their remembrance, wherein, in 4 Ed. 2. in a nuper
obiit, it is said, that if the Lands which have been departible and departed,
come into the Lords hands by Escheat, they shall not be departible in his
hands, Partible lands Escheat.
vel in manibus alicujus alius perquisitoris non possunt partiri. And he said
that such was the opinion of Sir Thomas Bromley the last Lord Chancellor upon
hearing of the matter there; whereby when the Jury came to give their Verdict
the Plaintiff was Nonsuit.

11.
SHuttelworth showed how Robert Hughson brought an Action of Debt against B.
Office of the Court.
as Administrator of F. and declared upon a simple contract made by the
Intestate, Pasch. 30 El. rot. 421.
and the Defendant pleaded plene administravit, and it was found by Verdict
against him. And now in arrest of Judgment the Defendant alleged, that the
Action is not maintainable against him upon a simple contract. And Shuttelworth
thought that now he is past that advantage, because he did not show it in
pelading, and cited the opinion of Cottesmore in 13 H. 6. And whether the Court
ex officio ought to bar the Plaintiff or no was the question.

Rodes It appears to us judicially that no action will lie upon a simple
contract against Executors or Administrators, wherefore then ought the Plaintiff
to have Judgment?


Shuttelworth Because by his Plea he took upon him notice of the contract, and
by 46 Ed. 3. where the Administrator was privy to the retainer of a servant, he
was charged by a simple contract.


Rodes Here he did not take notice, and in 15 Edw. 4. The Court ex officio,
abated the Writ.


Shuttelworth This is by Littleton only.


Rodes The case is ruled, and Littleton gave Judgment; so is the case in 11
Hen. 4. where an Action upon the case is brought against an Inne-keeper, A
common Ianholder.
if he be not named Hospitator, allthough he plead in bar, yet we ex officio
ought to abate the Writ.


Peryam If he be no Hosteler, the Action lies not against him. And if an
Action of Debt be brought, and do not show the place of the Obligation, if the
other plead a release, this is good enough.


Shuttelworth So is 18 Edw. 4. A De^d not showed in Court.



and 6 Hen. 7. Rodes If a man bring an Action, and the Defendant plead in bar
by Deed, and do not show the Deed, and the other pleads in bar, and does not
except thereunto, but they were at Issue, this is Error; for we ex officio
ought to have adjudged it evil; and so is the Book in 22 Hen. 6. or 28 Hen. 6.
and I can show the case.


Then Shuttelworth said privily to his Client, I doubt we shall do no good by
our Action. (Anderson being then in the Star Chamber.) After at another day
Anderson rehearsed the case, and said, it appears to us, that Executor or
Administrator cannot be charged upon a simple contract, and the Court ex
officio ought to stay the Judgment, and the Writ at the first ought to have
been abated, and this is reason, and so is the Book in 15 Edw. 4. and then by
the assent of the other Judges he gave Judgment accordingly.

12.
RObert Johnson is Plaintiff against Jonathan Carlisle in an Ejectione firm;
Fine.
and upon not guilty pleaded the Jury found a special Verdict, Hill. 29 El.
rot. 824.
that William Grant was seized in fee of the Lands now in question being held
in Socage, and devised them to his Wife for term of her life; and when John his
son came to the age of 25 years, then he should have those Lands to him and
to his heirs of his body engendered, and dyed; afterward the said John before
that he came to the age of 25 years levied a Fine thereof in fee, and after
came to 25 years, and had issue a Daughter, and dyed, and after the Wife dyed,
then the Daughter entered, and made a Lease to the Plaintiff; the question was
no more, but whether this Fine levied by the Father before any thing was in
him, shall be a bar to the Daughter.

Rodes The question is if the Daughter may say that her Father had nothing in
the Land at the time of the Fine levied? and so by this means Fines shall be of
small force.


Windham and Peryam We have adjudged it lately in Zouches case, that the Issue
shall not have this averment. Parties and privies shall have no averment.



Shuttelworth for the Plaintiff If it were in Pleading, I grant it well, but
here it is found by Verdict.


Curia This will not help you; for by the Fine the Right is extinct.


Windham When my Lord Anderson comes, you shall have a short rule in the case.


Shuttelworth Too short, I doubt, for us.


After at another day Shuttelworth moved the case again.

Anderson May he which levied this Fine avoid it by this way?


Shuttelworth No Sir.


Anderson How then can he which is privy avoid it?


Shuttelworth By Plea he cannot.


Anderson The Verdict will not amend the matter.


Fenner If I make a Feoffment upon condition, Feoffment upon condition.
and after levy a Fine of the same land to a stranger, and after I re-enter for
the condition broken, the stranger shall not have the land.


Curia We have given Judgment clearly to the contrary in the case of Zouch.
And your opinion is no authority.


13.
A Writ of Dower was brought by John Hunt and Joan his Wife, late the Wife of
Austin, Dower.
for the third part of Lands in Wolwich; the Defendant pleaded that the Lands
are Gavelkind, Trin. 30. Eliz. rot. 156.
And that the Custom of Gavelkind within the County of Kent is, that the Wife*
shall have the Moity during her Widowhood, according to the Custom, and not any
third part according to the Common Law; upon which Plea the Defendant demurred
in Law; Negative pre^cription.
And one question was, whether this Prescription in the Negative be good with
the Affirmative; And the other doubt was, if the Wife may wave her Dower by the
Custom, and take it according to the Common Law. And the Justices held the
Prescription good enough, being in the Negative with the Affirmative.
I^^eritance.


Windham This Custom shall bind the Heir and his Inheritance, and by the same
reason it shall bind the Wife and her Dower;


which Peryam granted expressly. Rodes was absent, and Anderson spoke not to
that second point. But all the Court agreed clearly that as this Custom is
alleged, she shall be barred of her Dower. And so they commanded to enter
Judgment accordingly; but if the pleading had been in the Affirmative only
without the Negative, then the second point had come in question.

14.
WAlmisley prayed the opinion of the Court in this case. Extent.
The Sherif extends Lands upon a Statute Staple, and whether the Conusee
shall b^ said to be in Possession thereof, before they be delivered to him or
no?

Anderson Allthough that they be extended, Refusal.
yet the Conusee may refuse to receive them.


Walmisley True Sir.


Anderson Then has he nothing in them, before he have received them, for he
may pray, that the Lands may be delivered to the Praisors, according to the
Statute of Acton Burnell.


Windham Your meaning is to know, if the Rent incurres when the Land is in the
Sherifs hands, if you shall have it?


Walmisley True Sir, that is our very case.


Anderson Then this is the matter, whether you shall have the Rent, or the
Conusor, or the Queen, but how can you claim it?


Windham The Lands are in the Queens hands.


Peryam The Writ is, Cape in manum nostram.


Rodes This is like to the case of disceit, where he shall not have the mean
issues. So as it seemed to them, Disceit.
the Conusee shall not have it, but they did not say expressly who should have
it.


15.
TRespass quare clausum fregit, was broug^t' against two, the one appeared,
Simul cum Dyer 239.
and the other was outlawed, and the Plaintiff declared against the one only,
who by Verdict was found guilty, and now Walmisley spoke in arrest of
Judgment, that he should have declared against them both, or against the one
simuleum, etc. But the Court thought that this was helped by the Statute of
Jeofailes, but at this time they were not resolved.

16.
A Special Verdict was found, Disability of the Devisor at the time of his
death.
that a Woman sole was seized of certain Lands held in Socage, and by her last
Will devised them to I. S. in Fee, and after she did take the devisee to
Husband, and during the Coverture she Countermanded her Will, saying that her
Husband should not have the Land, nor any other advantage by her Will, and then
died. Now whether this be a sufficient Countermand, so that the Husband shall
not have the Land, was the question.

Shuttleworth For as much as she was Covert-Baron at the time of her death,
therefore the Will was void, for a Feme-Covert cannot make a Will, and a Will
has no perfection, until after the death of the Devisor.


Gaudy In Wills, the time of the making is as we^l to be respected, Taking a
Husband is no Countermand of the Wife.
as the death of the Devisor; And then she being sole at the time of the
making, allthough that* afterward she took a Husband, yet this is no
Countermand, and so is Bret. and Rigdens case in the Commentaries.


Anderson If a man make his Will, and then become non compos mentis, Not of
sound mind.
yet the Will is good, for it is Common that a man a little before his death,
has no good memory.


Shuttleworth I do not agree the Law to be so,


and so Rodes seemed to agree, but Anderson affirmed as before.

Windam I do not doubt but such a Will shall be good.


Rodes If a man make his Will, and after do become non compos mentis, and then
live three or four years after, Long life makes difference.
it is no reason that such a Will shall be good, and he cited 3 Edw. 3. it in.
Northt. for this case.


Gaudy If the Proviso in the Statute of Wills had not been, then every Will
made by a Feme-Covert should have been good.


Tota Curia That is nothing so, for allthough the Proviso had not been,
Reasonable construction.
yet the Statute should have had a reasonable construction.


But for the principal case, the Court was not yet resolved. After at another
day, Gaudy moved the case again, and held strongly, that by taking of a
Husband; this is not Countermanded, and cited 2 R. 2. and then during the
Coverture, she has s^bmitted her Will to her Hu^band; For by 3 Ed. 3. it in.
Roteland she cannot devise to her Husband, whereby he concluded that the Will
is good. Shuttleworth to the contrary, because she has no ability at the time
when it should take perfection, and every Will ought to have three things,
Inception, Progression, and Consummation. And he cited Bret. and Rigdens case.

Anderson I am of my first opinion that this Will is not good, for I think
this Countermand by the Wife is sufficient, ^^u^termand by one not of found
mind.*
and if non compos mentis say that he does revoke his Will, this is a
sufficient Countermand. And whereas it has been said, that a Feme-Covert has
no Will; Sir that is not so, for she has a Will in many cases, Wills of fe^e
(...)
as if she be Executrix she may make a gift, etc. So if I be bound to do such
an Act, if such a Feme-Covert will consent, in this case if the Husband only
consent, it is not sufficient, but the Wife ought to assent also. And if this
Will shall be good, then this mischief will ensue, that after a Will is once
made, the party shall have no power to control it, Controlement.
therefore I think the Will is not good.


Wyndham I am of the same opinion. For a Will is not perfect until after the
death of the Devisor, No countermand
and when she is disabled at the time of her death, the Law says, that such a
Will is void. But I think that a Feme-Covert cannot Countermand her Will, for
the same reason which does disable her to make a Will, does also disable her
to Countermand that which is made before; for by 3 Edw. 3. Consummation.
which was cited before, she cannot devise to her Husband, and by the same
reason she cannot Countermand that which is devised to her Husband; but because
the Wife was not a person able at the time of the Consummation thereof,
therefore it is not good. Mar^iage no countermand.
Peryam to the same intent. First the Marriage is not any Countermand, and for
the case in 2 R. 2 I think it good Law. And I have allwaies taken this
diversity, that if a woman grant the Reversion after Tenant for years,
Reversion.
and before Attornment had she take a Husband, that this is a Countermand, but
if that it be a Reversion after Tenant for life, then it is no Countermand, For
in the first case his Title of Tenant by the Courtesy begun by the
intermariage, Allthough that it was not consummate before issue had; And it
seems a clear case that a Feme-Covert cannot Countermand a Will, for she
cannot make a Will. And whereas it has been said by my Lord, that a woman has
a will, Will by custom^ or by some by-matter.
true it is; but that is either by custom, or by reason of some by-matter, as
in the cases put. But Wills ought to take effect at the time of the death, and
if then she be disabled, it is not good; for it is not consummate before; as if
there be Husband and Wife, and the Husband be seized of Lands in Fee, and levy
a Fine thereof, and then dye, and after the levying of the Fine five years
pass, yet she shall not be Barred; but if after the death of the Husband five
years pass, she is barred by a Fine, because her title was not conmsumate
until after the death of the Husband, whereby etc. Rodes to the same intent,
for if I devise the Manor of Dale as it is iu the Com. for etc. and then have
nothing in it, but afterward purchase it, Perfection.
now it shall pass, which proves that the perfection of a Will is at the time
of the death, and in 39 H. 6. a man devised lands, and before his death was
disseised, Disseisin after Will.
nothing passed by the Will, because it was no Will, until death; and here in
our case because she was disabled at the time of her death, it is void.


Anderson Then let judgment be entered accordingly.


17.
A Proclamation was directed to the Sherif of Cheshire against John Hockenhall,
Proclamation.
and the Writ was returned, Tale die ad comitat. meum tent in le Shirehall etc.
Dyer fol. 206.
proclamationem feci, ac eodem die ad generalem Sessionem etc. proclamationem
feci etc. And now this matter was pleaded in avoidance of the Utlary to reverse
it, because those proclamations were made one day, whereas the Writ was (tribus
seperalibus diebus etc. And the Sherif was amerced to forty shillings for his
evil retorn. And at another day he was amerced to other forty shillings
because he had returned diverse Writs in Secretary hand, Secretary hand.
And commandment was then given to the Custos brevium, to receive no Writs
returned in Secretary hand, for the Court said that writing in Secretary hand
would be so worn in a dozen years that no man can read it.

18.
HOcker brought debt upon an Obligation against Gomersale and his Wife
Executrix of the last will of Henry Gooderd ^^perdict. Common intendment.
Hen. Gooderd de London Tailor, Trin. 30. Eliz.
And they pleaded in bar a recoverie had against them in the Kings bench as
Executor testamenti H. G. nuper dicti H. G de Land. Rot. 2^03.
Barber Surgeon, whereupon the Plaintiff demurred, And the Defendant did not
aver that the said G. Tailor and G. Barber Surgeon was allone person, and
they also omitted this word praedictum, And whether this were good or no was
the doubt, And it seemed to the Justices that it was not good, although it was
alleged that it shall be intended all one person* and then if a plea in bar be
good to common intent, it is good enough. And thereupon John Pastons case was
cited in 21 H. 7. Where it was Westmonasteriu^, and does not say praedictum,
Common intent what it is.
yet it shall be intended the same Westminster. mentioned before. Whereunto the
Court answered* that here by common intent he shall not be intended the same
person, but rather to the contrary, For common intent is that which shall be
intended more strong than any other, and not that which rests indifferent, As
if a man Plead a Feoffment in fee, it shall be intended that the Feoffer was of
full age, but here common intent is that he was another person, because Barber
Surgeon, and Tailor, are diverse functions by common intent, And as to the
case put, by common intent it shall be intended the same Westminster. because the
place is so notorious, that common intent will nor intend any other. But Peryam
would not grant that case of 21 H. 7.

At another day Gaudy said that they have a President in 16. Eliz. where an
action was brought here against the Administrator of Francis Fitzherbert
Mercer, And they pleaded likewise a Recovery in the Kings bench against them as
Administrator of F. F. Grocer, and allowed for good, and in 10 H. 7. wast is
brought and does not say, praedict. and yet good

Peryam For the cases in 10. H. 7. and 21 H. 7. It was all in one Plea, but it
is not so here.


And for his President Anderson and Peryam said that they would not regard it,
if it do not appear that Exception was taken thereunto if the Presidents be
shown for matter, Matter (...) Form (...) Presidents.
but if they be shown for form then otherwise it is.

Anderson If I. S. bring a Praecipe against me, and I vouch I. S. it shall not
be intended the same person, ^oucher.
if he do not say expressly that he is the same person, therefore a Fortiori
here it shall not be intended the same person.


Afterward the next Term Shuttleworth argued again that it shall be intended
the same person, but all the Court was against him, and so they gave judgment
for the Plaintiff.

19
FEnner showed how Bartholmew Brooksbie has brought a Quare impedit, A thing
in action released.
and declared how A. was seized of the advowson in fee, and granted to him and
another the next avoidance, and after the church became void, and the other
released to him all his right etc. and the Defendant disturbed him. And after
they pleaded to issue which was found with the Plaintiff, and this matter
alleged in arrest of judgment, that the Release was void, and then he has no
cause of action, for when the Church became void, then it was a thing in action
or actionary, and therefore could not be granted over by 28 H. 8. Interest
shall survive.
and by the same reason it cannot be released, as 1 and 2 P. and M. and 2 and 3
P. and M. in Dyer.

Anderson If it be an interest it shall survive, and by the same reason it may
be released, And it shall go to his Executors, wherefore then may it not be
released?

TIsdale, Maintenance.
one of the Attorneyes of the Common pleas, brought an Action upon the Statute
of Maintenance against John al Tree in Chancery lane, for Maintenance in a
Spiritual Court; and by all the Court, an Action is not Maintainable for
Maintenance in an inferior Court; for this word, alibi, being in the Statute,
was expounded to be meant of the Kings Court only, and in the argument of the
same case, Drew remembered the Court of a Judgment given there in the like case
for one Constantine of Wiltshire.

2.
BEtween Brown and Lother an Action was brought in the Spiritual Court,
Consultation.
for these words, Thou art a forsworn Knave* for thou made a false account
when thou were Churchwarden, and thereupon the Defendant brought a Prohibition,
supposing the discussing of Perjury to belong to the Temporal Court, and upon
the opening of the matter to the Court, the Plaintiff had a consultation,
because the Perjury was supposed to be committed, about the execution of his
Office of Churchwarden, which does belong to the Spiritual jurisdiction: But
otherwise it had been if the Perjury had been supposed to have been committed
concerning a Feoffment or other Temporal act, per Walmisley and Owen.

3.
BRoughton against Flood, Amendment
the original Writ was returned by Needham, Esquire, Sherif, and his Christian
name left out. Williams moved the Court to have the Christian name of the
Sherif put into the Writ, but the Court denied it, because the Record was made
up, and likewise by this means they should make an Outlary good, which was now
erroneous.

4.
IN an Advowry the Defendant says, Venue.
that locus in quo, etc. is parcel of the Manner of Dale, and avows for suit
of Court, the Plaintiff by replication says, that locus in quo, etc. is parcel
of the Manor of Sale, and makes to himself a title, absque hoc that it is
parcel of the Manor of Dale, and the Venire facia^ was of Dale only, and
upon motion all the Court adjudged that it ought to have been of both Manors,
and made a rule for stay of Judgment after Verdict. This was the case of
Atwood of the Middle Temple.

5.
IT was said by Anderson and Owen, Prohibition.
that a Prohibition will not lie after a sentence in the Spiritual Court, and
that if the Libell be for such a matter as may be determined in the Spiritual
Court, no Prohibition will lie, unless some Plea be pleaded by the Defendant in
that Court, which the Judge will not allow: For if a Suit be in the Court of
Admiralty upon a contract made upon the Sea, and the Defendant pleaded a
release, or a gift, after the coming to Land, that Court may enquire and try
this issue; the like for Tithes, 2 Rich. 3.

6.
IT was said by Drew in the Argument of the case between R^the^^^ and Green,
Common.
that if a Commoner take a Lease of one Acre, out of which his Common is
issuing, that his whole Common is suspended; Rent.
also where a Lease for years is, rendering Rent, and for default of payment a
re-entry, if the Lessor grant the reversion of one Acre, Condition.
the whole condition is gone: Also that an entry by the Lessor into any parcel,
suspends the whole rent during his occupation, and Anderson said, that there is
no Common by common right, but Common appendant.

7.
ADams brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation against Oglethorp,
Restitution.
the Defendant pleaded that after the making of the Obligation, Trin. 39 Eliz.
(...). 1803.
the Plaintiff was attainted of Treason for Coining, and pleads the Attainder at
length; the Plaintiff confesses the Attainder, and says, that afterward the
Queen by Letters Patents did pardon him, and did restore unto him omnia bona
and cattella sua, and thereupon the Defendant did demur in Law, the question
was, whether Debts by specialty be included in those words.

8.
EVeling against Leveson Executor of the Testament of Walton, Assets.
in effect the case was this; The Queen was indebted to Walton in a hundred
pound for Muskets and Callivers delivered into the Tower, for which money
Walton took a Debenter from the Queen in the name of a stranger, and afterward
dyed, and made Leveson Executor, who procured the stranger to release and
surrender the former Debenter to the Queen, and took a new Debenter for the
same hundred pound to himself, this was adjudged no Assets, nor devastav^t in
the hands of the Executor Leveson upon a special Verdict, but otherwise it
should have been if the first Debenter had been taken in VValtons own name, for
then it had been a devastavit by the Executor.

9.
BAcon Plaintiff against Selling in an Ejectione firm, Assets de judgment.
the original bare test 13 Aprilis An. 39. and the Plaintiff declared upon a
Lease made to him 22 Apr. An. 39. Trin. 39 Eliz. rot. 1345.
so that it appeared to the Court, that the Plaintiff brought his Action before
he had an interest in the Land, and by all the Court a Rule was given for stay
of Judgment after a Verdict; but afterward the Plaintiff came, and showed that
after Improlance he filed a new original.

10.
HEnry Earl of Lincoln brought a Scandalum magnatum against one Michelborn for
these words, Scandalum magnatum.
viz. The Earl of Lincolns men by his commandment did take the Goodt of one
Hoskins by a forged Warrant, etc. And the Earl recovered great damages by
Verdict, and now it was spoken in arrest of Judgment, that the words were not
sufficient to maintain the Action, because it was not averred that the Earl
knew the Warrant to be forged, and of the same mind was the Court at this time.

11.
WIlloughby brought an Action of Debt against Milward, Debt.
and declared that the Defendant bought Timber of him for ten pound, solvend.
modo and forma sequenti, viz. five pound ad festum Pasch. proxime sequentem,
and says nothing when the other five pound should be paid, and the Plaintiff
recovered the whole ten pound by Verdict; and now it was spoken in arrest of
Judgment for the cause aforesaid, but yet by all the Court it was good enough;
for the Law intends the other part of the money to be due presently, if no
certain day of payment be alleged.

12.
Kitchen brought an Action of Debt against Dixson, Debt.
Executor of Craven, Mich. 36 and 37 El. rot. 1028. or 1021.
the Defendant pleaded (ne unques Executor.) and the Jury found a special
Verdict, viz. That Craven in his life time made a Deed of Gift of all his Goods
to Dixson, and they found likewise that this Deed was to defraud Creditors,
against the form of the Statute, and that the Defendant by color of this Deed
did take the Goods after the death of Craven, and if this Deed was good, then
they found for the Defendant, if not, then they found the Defendant was
Executor of his own wrong, and so for the Plaintiff, and by all the Court
Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

13.
IT was said by Drew (arguendo) That if the Grantee of a Rent charge release
parcel of the Rent to the Grantor or his heirs, Rent charge
the residue may be apportioned, and the Land shall remain chargeable still for
that residue, but if he release in one Acre parcel of the Land charged, then
all the Rent is gone.

14.
IT was said by Glanvile in the argument of the case* between Cromwell and
Andrews, Provis^.
that a Proviso in a conveiance to be performed on the part of the Lessee,
implies a re-entry, allthough there be no special words of re-entry, but
otherwise it is when it arises on the part of the Lessor, and Vouched
bendlowes case, where there was a Covenant going between the Habendum and
Proviso. But where the Proviso stands substantively, as where I grant a Rent
charge, Proviso that he shall not charge my person, Condition.
this is no Condition but a Qualification. Also where a Feoffment is made upon
Condition to grant me a Rent Charge payable at Easter and Christmas, if the
grant be not made before the first Feast which shall next happen, the Condition
is broken, and he put a difference where the Condition must be performed by
none but himself, and where it may as well be performed by his Executors, as
himself. And Drew said then, that if there be a Feoffment upon Condition to
Re-enfeoff the Feoffer, there ought the Feoffor to make a request, otherwise if
it be to enfeoff another.

15.
SMith against Bonsall, Common.
in effect the case was such; In an Action of Trespass the Defendant pleaded
his Freehold, Hill. 39. Eliz. rot. 1753.
and the Plaintiff replied that A. was seized of a Yard-land, to which he had
Common of Pasture for all manner of Beasts Levant and Couchant upon the same
Yard-land, and of the Moity thereof did enfeoff the Plaintiff; the question was,
whether this Common may be apportioned, or else it be extinct altogether. In
the argument whereof Drew said, that Common sans number cannot be granted over,
because if it should be granted to a rich man, he may surcharge the Common
then, and leave none for the rest of the Commoners, so of estovers uncertain,
for so the Grantee may burn all the Wood, (quod Walmisley concessit) and he
vouched 17 Eliz. in Dyer, that a Commoner may purchase parcel of the Land* out
of which his Common is issuing, Purchase,
after that it be improved by the Lord, and not extinguish his Common thereby.
And he said, that if parcel of the Common be enclosed, Enclosure.
a Commoner ought to make but one gap to put in Cattle; but Anderson said,
that he may make as many gapes as he will. And it was said by Anderson and
Beamont, Appendant may be apportioned.
that Common appendant cannot be for all manner of Cattle, but only for such
^attell as compass the Land, and that such Common may be apportioned into
twenty parts, Append. quid.
as any Common certain may be.

Walmisley and Owen If my Land to which I claim Common belonging, can yield me
stover to find a hundred Cattle in Winter, then shall I have Common in Summer
for a hundred Cattle, in the Land out of which I claim Common, and so for more
or fewer proporitionably, which they did expound to be the meaning of pertinen.
Moity of a Manor.
levan, and cuban.


Walmisley If I grant away the moity of my Manor, we shall both keep Courts,
so if I be disseised of a Moity, or that the Moity be in Execution by elegit,
and we shall both have Common, and in apportionment of Common respect ought
allwaies to be had to the quality of the Land unto which it is alloted.
Copiholder.
And a Copyholder may prescribe for Common in the Lords Land within the same
Manor by usitatum fuit, but, if he claim any other Common, he must lay the
prescription in the Lord.

WAlter Ascough prisoner in the Fleet, Appearance.
was brought to the Common place bar by hab^as corpus, to the intent to have
him appear to an Original in debt brought against him; And being demanded by
Goldesburg Clark, whether he were the same party against whom the Original was
brought, confessed it, but denied to appear to the Action: Br^^ke^ Prothonotary
said, the Court ought to record his appearance, confessing himself to be the
same person; but the whole Court said this was no appearance, whereby he was
remanded to the Fleet; And Tamworth the Plaintiff proceeded to the outlary
against him.

2.
PRice brought an Action of Trover against Sir Walter Sands; Frandulent deeds.
Trin. xxxviii. Eli.
And this was for finding of Corn. And the first point of the case was, That a
man had a Lease in Reversion, and granted it to another by fraud, and his
Grantee granted that over to Sir Walter Sands, bona fide. And if this Grant
over bona fide being derived out of a Fraudulent Estate shall be void, per the
Statute of 27 Eliz. or not, was the question.

Harris Sergeant It seems the Grant to Sir Walter Sands to be good; And not
within the Statute of 27 Eliz. For 33 He^. 6. 28. If a man make a Feoffment in
Fee by Collusion, to the intent to defraud the Lord of the Wardship; And after
this Feoffee by Collusion make a Feoffment over, bona fide, Now the Lord is
without remedy, for the Collusion is gone. And in this case there is an
ignorance in Sir Walter Sands, the which is not wilful, and for that it is
not punishable: Notice.
But if the other had taken the profits, so that the purchaser might have
notice, there it should be otherwise. The ^ cause was, non constat whether the
Grant were before the Statute of 27 Eliz. or not. For if it were before, then
the party shall not answer the mean profits. Also a third matter is, ten
years of the Term was granted for money; But when he granted the Residue of
the Term and no Consideration expressed, Consideration expressed.
then there shall be no, consideration intended. And if there were no
Consideration given, he is not helped by the Statute: For that helps a
Frandulent Conveyance against purchasers for Consideration given or paid, Et
non constat that any thing was paid by the Plaintiff. Also it appears that
Sir Walter Sands was in possession at the making of the Statute. Also here
the party is charged with a special fraud; And the other says, that it was
made bona fide. And this is a good course of pleading without any Traverse, per
4 Ed. 4. 24.


3.
HUgh Hall brought an Action upon his case for words, and declared, Slander.
that where he himself was robbed of diverse parcels of Cloth, per quendam
ignotum; and made his integrity and endeavor to apprehend the said thief,
praedictns tamen defendens praemissorum non ignarus dixit de praefato Hugone,
viz. Hugh Hall has received three parcells of his Cloth again of the thief;
And if I receive any hurt henceforth, I will charge him with it. And by
Judgment of the Court the words are not actionable.

4.
THe Lady Willoughby Wife to the late Sir Francis Willoughby, Caveat.
sued in the Chancery as Administratrix of her said Husband, against Percivall
Willoughby, which had married one of the Daughters of the said Sir Francis; And
the Defendant pleaded, that before any Administration committed to the said
Plaintiff, he himself put in a Caveat in the Spiritual Court, hanging which
Caveat she has attained these Letters of Administration, Appeal.
whereby the Defendant has appealed, (...) which appeal is not yet determined,
for which he demanded Judgment if hanging this appeal the said Plaintiff shall
be received to sue in this Court as Administratrix. And it seemed to Egerton
then Lord Keeper of the great Seal, that the Defendants plea is good to stay
the suit until the appeal be determined; But not to be dismissed out of the
Court, Appeal, Er^^^* Difference.
no more than an excommunication. And he said there is difference between an
appleal in Spiritual Law, and a Writ of Error in our Law: For by the
purchasing of a Writ of Error the Judgment is not impeached until the Record
be rehearsed; But the very bringing of an appeal is a suspension of the first
Judgment in the Spiritual Court for the principal matter, but not for the
costs, and for to prove that he cited 2 R. 2. Quare impedit 143. and vide 27 H.
6. Gaud. 118. and. 2 M. 105. and Dyer 7 Eliz. 240.

5.
IN the Chauncery a special Verdict was returned upon an extent, Execution
upon an exte^t of a Remainder.
And the case was this; that there was Tenant for li^e, the Remainder in Tail,
and the Tenant in Remainder in Tail made a Statute Staple, and after granted
his Remainder. And after the Tenant for life died, (...) Bull (...).
and the Grantee of the Remainder entered; And whether Execution shall be sued
of this land upon the said Statute, insomuch that the said land was never in
Demeasne in the hands of the Co^^so^, (...) ^ames (...).
and so not extendable in his hands, was the question. And Sr. Thomas Egerton
Lord Keeper of the great seal said, that before that time there had been a
difference taken between a Remainder and a Reversion depending upon an estate
for life: For to a Remainder are no services due nor incident, and for that it
is termed Seck; But a Reversion has services incident, and those may be
extended, and by consequence the Reversion when it comes in possession. B^t
it seemed unto him that all was one, for one may charge a Remainder when it
happens, as well as a Reversion; and a Statute is in the nature of a charge.
Cook the Queens Attorney said there was no question in the Case; for albeit
there was some scruple made in 33 H. 8. B. 227. yet the Case is without
question: for if he in the Remainder make a lease for years, to commence at a
day to come; Yet if he grant over his Remainder, the Grantee shall hold that
charged with his lease; And every Statute is a charge Executory. By which the
said Lord Keeper awarded that there should be a liberate made to the Conusee,
upon the retorn above.

6.
OVerton brought an action of Debt against Sydall. Debt by a Successor against
an Executor after assignment.
And the case was, that Prebendary made a lease for years rendering rent, and
the Lessee died, and the Executors of the Lessee assigned over the Term, and
the Successor of the Prebend brought an action of Debt against the Executors
for rent due after that they had assigned the estate over, and the opinion of
three Justices was that the action would not lie. But Popham the chief Justice
held the contrary: For the Successor is privy to the Contract of the
predecessor; And so the Executor to the contract of the Testator.

7.
SHerborn against Lewis, Trin. 39. Eliz.
The case was that the Hospital of Donington was founded by the name of
Minister Dei pauperis domus de Donington; The name of a Corporation mistaken in
a lease.
And they made a lease in English by these words, Minister of the Almes-house
of God of Donington besides Newbery. And whether there be such variance between
the name of the Foundation, and this name by which the lease is made, to make
the lease void, or not, is the question.

Cook Attorney general seems that the misnomer in this case makes the lease
void, for the place of the Foundation is misnamed, and the place is the most
material thing in the Foundation that may be, and for that if that be mistaken
all is void. And yet he agreed that small variances in such Corporations shall
not hurt. Small variances.
For Almeshouseand poor-house does not make any material variance, for they
are all one in substance. But it may be that this addition de juxta Newbery is
of substance, For there may be two Doningtons, viz. the one by himself, and the
other juxta Newbery, without averment that it is not another; also in the
Foundation this word Dei has relation to Minister, and pauperis shall go to
domus, and that appears plainly by the Kings license of creation, and then
the Foundation that explaineth it, and the ordinances also, and if the
Corporation be not according to the license, then it is void, also it cannot be
intended that this word (Minister) shall be referred to domus, for the words
which give them auctority to elect one that he may be President above the
others, and he may not precede the others, if he shall be a servant. And now to
prove that a material difference, in 17 E. 3. Friars Carmelites would have
purchased land, and for that they had no place of Foundation they might not.
And also the Dean and Chapter of Chester made a lease, and this word (Cestria)
was omitted, and for that it was adjudged void, and so here. Atkinson all
co^tr. For here there is no misnomer of the Corporation, but an interposition
of words one for another; And they ought to be reasonably construed, and
howbeit they are placed one before another, yet they may be construed according
to the Foundation, having a favorable construction, the which ought to be in
every grant.

Gaudie It seems that the lease is good, for there is no material variance,
for variance in letter and not in substance shall not hurt, and here in
substance they agree, as if one say that one is Bailey of I. S. of the Hundred
of D. It may be properly said that he is Bailey of I. S. So here if he be
Minister pauperis Dei de Donington* he is the Minister of God. For if the house
be the house of God, and he the Minister of that, then he is the Minister of
God, and in the case of the Savoy-after judgment given in the Exchequer, Error
was brought in the Exchequer chamber, according to the Statute of 31 E. 3. ca.
12. And there it was agreed by the Barons before all the Judges of England,
that the lease was good, notwithstanding the misnomer of the Foundation. And in
some case variance in name of the Corporation should never hurt, where such
variance in name of Baptism shall hurt. And to prove that, he cited 11 H. 4.
and also he said that the other variance juxta Newbery is not material, for in
9 E. 4. that warranteth it, and it may be Donington is juxta Newbery.


Fenner I am of the same opinion, but yet I will be advised.


Popham I am resolved, and I think that the argument of my brother Gawdie had
need to be well answered; and after in Termino Mich. 39. and 40. Eliz. this
case was argued again, and it was said that in 24. Eliz. inter Wilgate and
Hall, the case was, that the Dean and Chapter of Windsor were founded by the
name of Decanus Reginae capella de Windsor, And they made a lease by the name
Decanus Regina capelle de Windsor, and for that this word Reginae was added to
the lease, which was not in the Foundation, therefore the lease was adjudged
void.


Gawdie It seems the lease is good, and that the variance shall not hurt, for
we ought to make suck construction if we may, that the lease should be good,
and for that 11 Eliz. 278. Incorporation per name de Dean and Chapter Ecclesiae
cathedralis sanct^e and individue Trinitatis Carlill made a lease for years by
name Decanus Ecclesiae cathedralis sanctae Trinitatis in Carlill, et totum
capitalium de Ecclesia praedicta, and the better opinion was that the lease was
good, notwithstanding the variance, because it is not in substance of name, and
5 Ed. 4. 20. Obligation was made Abbati Monasterii de M^ extra mur^^ Eborum.
And in debt brought the Writ was quod reddat Abbati Monasterii de M. Ebor.
leaving out these words extra muros, and holden good, notwithstanding the
variance, and yet then the party might have had a new Writ; Et a fotiori in
this case, for here he can never have a new lease, and if a lease agree in
effect and Substance with the Foundation, albeit there be variance in words
between the grant and the Foundation, yet the lease is good. As if one said
that T. K. is Executor, of the Testament of I. S. It may be said that that T.
K. is I. S. Executor, and in this case if it had been Minister Dei p^^peris
domus Dei de Donington, there the Addition of this word Dei, after the word
domus, shall never hurt. Fenner Justice said it should hurt, for it cannot be
intended the same Corporation, and for that it is a material variance, for
there are two Genitive cases, and the last of them may not be governed by the
first Substantive, for in construction it may never be so construed. And when
the King puts a name upon a Corporation, this name ought to be strictly
observed: For they have no other capacity than by this name. And every
Corporation consists of two parts, Two parts of every Corporation.
That is to say of Persons, and of the place of their Foundation, and here
Minister Dei is the Person, and pauperis domus de D. is the Foundation; by
which, when part of the name of the Person is omitted, viz. this word Dei, and
added to the Foundation, there is a material variance. Clynch said the Lease
was good, for said he the Minister of God of the poor house of D. and the
Minister of Gods poor house of D. are all one; for when our Savior Christ came
to Jerusalem, and there saw the buying in the Temple, he said to the buyers,
you have made the house of God the den of Thieves; for the house of God is the
place where God is served.


Popham contra For if the Corporation had been Minister domus Dei de D. and a
Lease had been made by name de Minister domus de D. omitting this word Dei,
every one will agree that this is void; but if a further addition be made to
the Corporation, the Lease is true, Addition superfluous shall not hurt.
allbeit that it be varying, as if the Lease had been Minister Dei
omnipotentis, the addition of this word omnipotent, shall not hurt, and sic de
similibus.

And allbeit that it be not agreeing in words, yet if it agree in common
understanding, Common understanding*
it is good; but if in common understanding, the grant may not be taken
according to the Foundation, if it be not wrested to an unexpected
understanding, there it is not good; and if the Foundation had been in English
words, Minister of God of the poor house of Donington, and the Lease by name of
Minister of the poor house of God of Donington, every one will agree that this
is palpable variance, and the Lease not good. And I doubt of the case of
Everwick, for there the Prior beat^^ Mariae brought an action by name of Prior
beat^^ Mariae extramures civitatis Ebor* and if this case were now to be
adjudged, that would be variance, as the case of Bristoll, Prior beatae Maria
de Bristoll, made a Lease by name of Prior beatae Maria juxta Bristoll; and
this Lease was adjudged void; but if the case had been de Everwick juxta mures
civitatis Ebor. this had been no material variance, for it had been but an
explanation, which will never hurt;


and for that the Court was so divided in opinion, that is to say, two against
two, and the case concerned a poor house, They moved the parties to comprimise.

RUswell brought disceipt against Vaughan, Disceipt.
and declared that the Defendant sciens that he had no title to the Advowson of
D. took upon him to be owner of that, and sold the profits of the said Advowson
to the Plaintiff, pro quadam pecunia summa. And it was pleaded in arrest of
Judgment, for that the Plaintiff did not aver, ubi revera the Defendant had no
title, and non allocatur.

9.
THe case was that the Queen made a Lease for years, Borough versus Tailor.
rendering rent at the receipt of her Exchequer, or to the hands of her Baylif,
upon condition, that if the rent be not paid, that the estate shall cease;
Payment of rent the reversion being granted away by the Queen.
after the Queen granted over the reversion; and whether the rent shall be now
tendered upon the land, or at the receipt of the Exchequer, or to the person of
the Assignee of the reversion, was the question; and it was adjudged that the
Grantee of the reversion ought to demand the rent upon the Land, or otherwise
he shall not re-enter for the condition broken, and that for two causes, the
one, for that that when the reversion was in the Queen, Election.
the Lessee had election to pay it at the receipt of the Exchequer, or to the
hands of the Queens Baylif, and when the Queen had granted over the reversion,
the election of the Lessee is tolled, by which now the rent shall ensue the
nature of other rents reserved by common persons, The common receipt of the
Exchequer.
and those are payable upon the lands: another reason is, every rent reserved
by the Queen is of common right payable at the receipt of the Exchequer, or to
the Baylifs of the Queen, without words appointing at what place it shall be
paid; for these are the usual receipts of the Queen, and so the words which
appoint that to be paid at the receipt of the Excheq* ^r to the hands of the
Baylif of the Queen, are idle words, for that the Law appoints so much of
common right, ex praerogativa Regis; but when the reversion is transferred into
the hands of a common person, No prerogative can be granted over.
there this Prerogative cease, for it cannot be granted to a common person;
and by consequence the rent shall be paid upon the Land.

10.
THomas VVelcome, Error.
Executor of Anthony VV. Executor of John VVelcome, brought a Writ of Debt
against S. S. in the Commonplace, and Judgment was given, and entered, quod
praedictus Johannes VVelcome recuperet, where it should have been, quod
praedictus Thomas VVelcome recuperet, No amendment in point of judgment.
and for that Error was brought, and Sergeant Heal moved that the Record might
be mended, for that it was the mis-entring of the Clerk, but adjudged to the
contrary, for the Judgment is the act of the Court, and not of the Clerk.

11.
EDmund Nevell brought an Action of Trespass against J. Sail, Abuttals.
and declared Quare clausum fregit in quodam loco vocato Claveringfield,
abuttan. super quoddam molend. in tenura J. S. Opinio*

Curiae If the Plaintiff do not prove his Buttals, he is gone.


And for that he could not prove that the Mill was in the tenure of J. S. the
Jury being at bar was discharged; and howbeit that there be a way between the
Close and the Mill, yet the Buttall is good.

12.
RIchard Somerstailes brought an Action upon the case for slanderous words,
Slanderous words.
that is to say, R. S. is a very bad fellow, for he made J. S. drunken in the
night, and consened him of an hundred Marks; and upon not guilty pleaded it was
found for the Plaintiff, and Judgment was stayed, for the words are not
sufficient to maintain an Action.

HAmond brought Debt upon an Obligation against Hatch, Award of part only.
and the Condition was, That if the Obligor do well and truly perform and keep
the Award of J. S. Arbitrator indifferently chosen between the Plaintiff and the
Defendant, for, and concerning the matters contained in 9 several Articles,
bearing date the day of these presents, So that the same be given up under the
hand and seal of, etc. And the Arbitrator made an award of 7 of the said
Articles, omitting the other two; and whether the Obligor ought to perform this
Award, was the question.

Man. I think he ought to perform the Award, for that he is bound by Obligation
to perform it, and to prove that he cited 5 Edw. 4. 19 Hen. 6. and 17 Edw. 4.


Gaudy The words of the Condition are, so that the same Award be given up in
writing before such a day; and that shall have reference to all the Articles;
for the Submission was conditional, as 14 Elizab.


And after Judgment was given quod quer. nihil capiat per billam.

15. How against Broom and others.

A Man leased a House and a Close, rendering rent, and the Lessor entered into
the house, and pulled that down, and after the Lessee re-entered into the
Close, Rent extinct by empairing the estate.
and whether the rent were revived or not, was the question. And

Popham and Gaudy The rent is not revived; and that the Lessee shall hold the
Close discharged of any Rent, by the folly of the Lessor to impair the estate
of the Lassee.


16.
DOwnall brought a Writ of Formdon against Catesby in the Commonplace, Error.
and there was a special Verdict found, and Judgment given, for a default in
the Writ, against the Plaintiff, and the Plaintiff brought Error, and alleged for
Error, that after Verdict given no default in the Writ shall prejudice the
party, per le Statute de 18 Eliz. cap. 14. Popham chief Justice said, if there
be no Writ, it is helped by the Statute, Insufficient Writ ^ot helped.
but it is otherwise if there be an insufficient Writ in matter, for that is
not helped; but a Writ that is insufficient in form, and sufficient in matter,
is helped: And in every Writ of Formdon there are two things requisite, the one
is the gift, the other the conveyance to the Demandant; and if either of these
two fail, the Writ is insufficient in substance, and is not helped by the
Statute.

17.
PEter Palmer of Lincolns Inn brought an action upon the case against one
Boyer, Slander of a Counselor at Law.
and declared how he was an Utter-barrester of the Law, and got his living by
practicing of the Law, and was Steward of diverse Courts, and namely of one John
Petty Esquire, and the Defendant praemissorum non ignarus, to the intent to
prejudice the Plaintiff in his good name and practice, said of the Plaintiff
these English words, viz. Peter Palmer is a paltry Lawyer, and has as much Law
as a Jackanapes; and it was pleaded in arrest of Judgment, that the words
would not maintain an action, for they are not slanderous; for it is not said,
he has no more Law than has a Jackanapes, for then it had been clear that the
action is maintainable, for by that he had abated the opinion of his Learning,
but it is not so in this case; for the words are, that he has as much Law as
has Jackanapes, and this is no impeachment of his Learning, for every man that
has more Law than Jackanapes, has as much; Et non allocatur, for the
comparison is to be taken in the worst sense, and tant amounts that he has no
more Law than Jackanapes, per quod Judgment was given for the Plaintiff, for
this is a slander in his profession by which he does acquire his living.

18.
ONe libelled in the Spiritual Court for Tithe of Billet, Prohibition.
Faggot' and Talwood, And averred that it came of Birch, Maple, Hasell and
Hume, and thereupon a Prohibition was sued, surmising that they came of Oak,
Ash, Elm, and Birch. And in the Spiritual Court allbeit one Libell for wood of
one nature, and that is found of another nature; yet sentence shall be given
for the Plaintiff. The Court said that was absurd, Absurd practice of the
spiritual Court.
and therefore they would hear a Civilian speak to that point.

Cook Attorney General If consultation shall not be granted, then farewell all
Tithe of Wood, for in truth in every faggot of Birch, there is put a great
stick of Oak, or Ash, intending by that to privilege the whole faggot of Tithe.
Nam crescit in orb d^lus. Webb, Clark, said, the cunning is of your side to
Libell for faggot; For if you had Libelled for Maple, Birch, or Hasell, no
Prohibition would have been sued. And it was adjudged in this Court in Molins
case, one Libbelled for billet and faggot generally, without showing of what
Wood they were made, And upon pleading upon the Prohibition, Partable tithable.
it appeared to the Court that part was tithable, and part not. And for that
they could never obtain a Consultation.


Cook It does not appear here that there was any mixture, so the case is not
like.


Webb You have no Right to have Tith of faggot, for that part thereof is not
tithable being Oak, so by your Covetousness to have more than is your Right,
you have lost that that is your Right,


Et adjornatur. And after at another day in the same Term, it was moved again
by Savile, Lanes case.
which said, that it was adjudged in Lanes case, that tith shall never be paid
for Hasell-wood which is mixed with Oak in fagots, quod Gawdie negavit.

Fenner He ought to have pleaded the special matter to have had a
Consultation, Seeciall pleading.
viz. how much of the faggot was Hasell, for so it was done, inter Molius and
Dames. And therefore forasmuch as it is not so done, Consultation shall not be
granted for no part of that, and of this opinion were all the Justices,

NOta per Master Kemp Secondary of the Kings Bench Office, Appearance.
if a Latitat goes forth against the Husband and Wife, and the Husband only
is taken, The Husband shall find surety for himself and his Wife, or otherwise
he shall lie in Prison until he find bail as well for his Wife as for himself,
and said, that this has been the use of the Kings Bench by the space of forty
years of his knowledge.

20.
SCire facias was brought by Middleton against Hall, Usury after Judgment.
to execute a Judgment. The Defendant pleaded that he borrowed of the Plaintiff
100. l. to give him 120. l. for the loan thereof for a year; And the Plaintiff
for his assurance would have the Defendant confess this Judgment of 120. l.
And so he pleaded the Statute of Usury in bar to this Scire facias, and upon
that the Plaintiff demurred in Law, Godfery prayed Judgment for the Plaintiff.
The words of the Statute of Usury are all Bonds, Contracts, and assurances
Collateral, or other, made, etc. shall be utterly void; But here this
Judgment may not be said any assurance for the money, but is a Judgment upon
the assurance, for which, etc. Clark contra. But the whole Court being twice
moved, held clearly that this is no plea to defeat a Judgment; But if such
matter had been, the Defendant ought to have pleaded that, upon the first
Action in bar, and so not to suffer the Judgment.

Popham Here are two inconveniences, one to defraud and defeat the Statute of
Usury, the other to avoid Judgments upon such suggestions which might be
pleaded in bar in the first Action; and after the Plaintiff had Judgment to
recover.


21.
MArtin, Slander of an Attorney,
Attorney of the Kings Bench, brought an Action of the case against Burling for
slanderous words, viz. Martin, is he your Attorney? he is the foolishest and
simplest Attorney toward the Law; And if he do not overthrow your cause I will
give you my ears, he is a fool and an ass, and so I will prove him. If these
words be actionable or not was the question, in arrest of Judgment after
Verdict for the Plaintiff, and the Court seemed prima facie, that they are not.
But after the case was moved by Harris for the Plaintiff, and then by the
consent of all the Court Judgment was given for the Plaintiff; And Popham said,
that to say that an Attorney will overthrow his Clients cause is an Actionable
slander.

22.
COllet brought a Writ of Error against Marshe, Error for non summons.
upon a Judgment given in the Common place in a praecipe quod reddat, And
assigned for Error, for that by the Statute de 31 Eliz. cap. 13. it is inacted
for the avoiding of secret summons in real Actions, without convenient notice
of the Tenants of the Freehold, that after every summons upon the Land in any
real Action, fourteen days at the least before the Retorn thereof,
Proclamations of the summons shall be made on a Sunday, at, or near the most
usual door of the Church or Chapel of that Town or Parish where the Land,
whereupon the summons were made, does lie, and these Proclamations so made as
aforesaid, etc. ut in Statuto. And in this case, there was not any Proclamation
made at the Church door; And whether the Plaintiff shall have an Averment
against the Sherifs Retorn was the question. And adjudged that the party shall
not have the Averment against the Retorn of the Sherif: No averment against a
Sherifs retorn.
For if the Retorn be false, the party shall have an Action upon the case
against the Sherif.

23.
POrtman brought an ejectione firm against Willis, and a special Verdict was
foun^, that Roger Hill was possessed of a Lease for years, and gave diverse
personal Legacies to several persons, and gave all his other goods and
Chattells to his Wife, and whether the Wife shall have this Term, being a
Chattell real, or not, was the question.

24.
GRay brings Trespass against Trow, Fish in a pond.
for entering into his Close, and taking of Fish out of a Fish Pond with nets
and other Engines; The defendant pleaded that long time before the Trespass was
done, one Thomas Gray was seized of the Close and Pond, and put the Fishes into
the Pond, and after the said Thomas Gray made the Defendant his Executor, and
died; And he as Executor took the said Fishes, Chattells descendable.
and upon that the Plaintiff demurred, and it was adjudged that the Heir shall
have the Fishes in the Pond, and not the Executors, Felony.
for they are Chattells descendable, but by Clinch it is Felony to take them.

Popham If they be in a Trunck so that they may be taken out by the hands of
men, without nets or other Engines, there it is Felony, but otherwise it is not
Felony.


25.
THynn brings Debt against Cholmeley for 300. p. of arrerages of a nomine
poenae, Nomine poenae against an Assignee.
and declared of a Lease for years made by him to one Agar, rendering Rent, And
if default of payment be made of payment of the said Rent, at any day in which
it ought to be paid, that then and so often the said A. his Executor and
Assigns shall pay 3. s. 4. p. for every day, until the aforesaid Rent so
behind shall be satisfied, And showed how the Rent was behind and not paid for
two years; But does not say that he demanded the Rent.

Jackson The sum demanded, is by computation more than is due, reckoning but
iij. s. iiij. d. for every day that the Rent is arrear. And if that be his
intent he demands too little, for in two years that will be infinite.


Gaudy It seems that he shall not have but only iij. s. iiij. d. for every
day.


Fenner I think he ought to make demand of the Rent, or otherwise he shall
never have the nomine poenae.


Gaudy No truly, no more than in debt upon an Obligation, and he cited 21 Hen.
6. 21 Edw. 4. and 22 nomine poenae.


Fenner The cases are not alike, In demand.
for in debt upon an Obligation there is a duty, but otherwise it is of Rent.
And it was agreed that the action well lies against an Assignee in this case.


26.
HUmphrey Parlor brought an Action upon the case for words against I. S. And
the words were these, Slander.
viz. Parlor was in Prison in a Jail for stealing of Mr. Piggots Beasts; and it
was pleaded in arrest of Judgment, that the Action does not lie, forasmuch as
it is not presciely alleged and affirmed that he stole the Beasts: But by
Implicatior. Nevertheless Judgment was given for the Plaintiff, for by Fenner,
if he had said he had been in Prison for suspicion of stealing Mr. Piggots
Beasts, no Action will lie, for a treue man may be suspected: But here is a
direct affirmance of stealing; For a man cannot be imprisoned for stealing, if
he do not steal.

27.
THe Earl of Pembr^ok brought an Action upon the case against Henry Barkley
militem; Proviso.
and the case in effect was such, that the late Earl of Pembrook, Father of the
now Pla^ntif, was seized in Fee of the Manor of D. in com^tatu Somerset, and
by reason of that, he had the Office of Liuetenantship in the Forest of
Cromcelwood, and of all the Walks in that. And by reason of the said Office,
had all the commandment of the game within the Forest, and he so seized, the
Earl granted to Sir Maurice B. Father of the now Defendant, and to the Heirs
Males of his body, the Keepership of a walk called S. in the West part of the
Forest, and in the said Deed of grant were such words, Provided allwaies, and
the said Sir Mawrice B. does Covenant and grant, to, and with the said Earl of
Pembrook, that it shall and may be lawful to and for the Earl, his Heirs and
Assigns, to have the pre-eminence of the game within the said Walk; Provided
also, and the said Sir M. B. does further Covenant and grant to and with the
said Earl, That neither he, the said Sir M. his Heirs or Assigns, shall or
will cut down any Timbertrees growing within the said Walk. And after Sir M. B.
died, and the said Sir H. was his Son and Heir, and cut down Trees within the
Walk. And the Lord of P. commanded his servants to enter into the said
West-walk, and there to Walk; And Sir H. B. did disturb them, and upon that the
Action was brought, and the point of the case was, if the words in the second
Proviso make a Condition, or but a Covenant.

Gaudy I doubt of the case; for all the question of the case is, if it be a
Condition, or but a Covenant; And as I am now advised, ^^hit is but a Covenant,
and no Condition. For in all cases where this word (Proviso) ought to make a
Condition, there ought to be a perfect sentence to explain the meaning of the
parties, or otherwise it is no Condition. As if the words are provided
allwaies that if the Rent be behind, and say no more now, this is no Condition
And here all the sense comes in after the words of Covenant, and these words
are the words of Sir M. B. And for that it seems no Condition; for if the
words had been, And it is provided by Sir M. B. there it is clear no Condition.
But if in a Lease for years be words, and the Lessee do provide, that if the
Rent be behind, that then the Lessor shall re-enter, there I agree that this
makes a Conditon. And in the case put by my Brother Williams, a Lease made, and
provisum est quod non licebit to the Lessor, to grant over upon pain of
forfeiture, there is a good Condition; But otherwise it shall be, if sub poena
forisfacturae were omitted.


Fenner I think it is a a Condition, for all the words put together, explain
the meaning of the parties, as if he had said upon Condition, And the Lessee
does Covenant and grant, and none will deny but that this is a Conditidition.
Clinch seemed that it is no Conditon, for the words may not be used as a
Covenant, and also as a Condition. As where a grant is by Deed, by words of
Dedi, concessi, and confirmavi, the Deed may be used as a Grant, or
confirmation, at the Election of the party; But it cannot be used in both sorts.


Popham I think that the Proviso as it is here placed will make a Condition,
and yet I will agree, that a Proviso shall be sometimes taken for a Condition,
and sometimes for Explanation, and sometimes for a Covenant, and sometimes for
an Exception, and sometimes for a Reservation; and it is taken for a Condition;
As if a man Lease Land, provided that the Lessee shall not Alien without the
Assent of the Lessor, sub poena forisfactura, here it is a Condition; and if I
have two Manors, both of them named Dale, and I Lease to you my Manor of
Dale, Provided that you shall have my Manor of Dale in the Occupation of I. S.
here this Proviso is an Explanation what Manor you shall have; and if a man
Lease a house, and the Lessee Covenanteth that he will that maintain, Provided
allwaies that the Lessor is contented to find great Timber, here this is a
Covenant; and if I Lease to you my Message in Dale, provided that I will have
a Chamber my self, here this is an Exception of the Chamber; and if I make a
Lease rendering Rent at such a Feast as I. S. shall name, Provided that the
Feast of St. Michael shall be one, here this Proviso is taken for a
Reservation; and in our case, if the words had been provided allwaies that the
Donees shall cut down no Trees, and the Lessee does Covenant he will not fell
any, here every one will agree that it is a Condition, and also a Covenant;
And in this case in my opinion, this tant amounts.


Sergeant Williams and Cook Attorney for the Plaintiff. Atkinson and Tanfield
for the Defendant.

LAssels the Father, S^ander.
brought an Action upon the case against Lassels the Son, for words, viz. he,
quendam Thomam Lassels fratrem ejusdem Def. innuend. stole a Mare, and you,
innuend. querent. knowing the same, conveyed her into the Fenns to my Brother
B. his house. Clinch and Gaudy seemed the Action maintainable. Fenner econtra.

29.
A Man was indicted for stealing of a hat and a band, and other such things;
Indictment.
And the Prisoner said, that he was before that time indicted for goods stolen
the same day and time, and acquitted. Gaudy said, he may not be severally
indicted for goods stolen at one time. As if a man steal a dozen of silver
spones, he may not be indicted for two in one Indictment, and for other two in
another, and sic de singulis. Clinch accord.

Fenner Yes truly, for it was the case of Thomas Cobham, the which was indicted
for goods taken in two ships, and acquitted, and after condemned for other
goods taken at the same time.


30.
PEarce brought an Action upon the case against Barker, Prescription by a
Copyholder.
and delared how within the Manor of Dale, time out of mind, there had been
diverse Copyholders, and during the same time, there has been a usage within
the said Manor, That every Copyholder for every Acre of Land shall have Common
in such a Wast of the Lords for two Beasts; And showed how the Plaintiff is
possessed of twenty Acres, and by reason of those, ought to have Common for
forty Beast^. And there has the Defendant being Lessee for years of the same
Manor, one Conigray within the same Wast, by which the Conies have so dug
the ground, that his Beasts cannot have Common as they were wont to have.

Fenner A Copyholder may not prescribe but in right of his Lord; but now the
Lord pro tempore, is party to the action, and whether this will alter the case
or not, I doubt.


Glanvile Albeit the Copyholder may not prescribe but in right of his Lord, yet
by way of usage, as this case is, it has been adjudged that he may make his
title.

A Ruudell was heretofore arraigned upon an Indictment of wilful Murder for
the death of one Parker, Indictment.
and was found not guilty of Murder, but guilty of Manslaughter, for which he
pleaded the general pardon, de 35 El. And the Queens Attorney alleged, That in
the said general pardon there is an exception of all persons being in prison
by the commandment of one of the Privy-counsell; and said, that the said
Arundell was committed by the Lord Chamberlain for suspicion of the said
Felony, and for the same in prison at the time of the Parliament, Commitment.
and so a person exempted. To which it was said by the Defendant, that long
time before the said Parliament, and after the said commitment by the Lord
Chamberlain, there went out of this Court a Corpus eum causa, by force of which
he was sent into this Court, with the cause of his commitment, and was for the
said offense committed by this Court to the Marshalsey, and there was remaining
at the time of the Parliament by force of the commitment of this Court, and it
seemed by the better opinion of the Court if a man be committed by a
Privy-counsellor, and removed by Habeas corpus; and committed by this Court, he
shall be now said imprisoned by commitment of this Court, and not of the
Privy-counsellor.

STaugnton brings a Writ of Error against Newcomb upon a Judgment given in
Debt in the Commonplace, Error.
and the first Error assigned was for that the original Writ was xx l. and all
the mean Process were so likewise, but when the Defendant appeared to the
Exigent, the entry was, quod defendens obtulit se in placit^ debit^ december
librarum, where it ought to be xxl.

Dodderidge I think it shall be amended; for it is the misprision of the Clerk,
and to prove that, he cited 37 Hen. 6. 44. Ed. 3. 18.


But upon view of the Record it appeared that no original was certified, and
therefore could not be amended.

Cook Attorney General The case is, that Simon Bulleyn being cestui que use,
before 27 H. 8. Devised to his Wife certain Land for her life* and that after
her decease Robert Bulleyn his eldest son shall have the land ten pound under
the price it cost, Limitation.
and if he dyed without issue, that Richard Bulleyn his second son shall have
the land ten pound under the price it cost, and if he dye without issue of his
body, then his two Daughters A. and B. shall have the land, paying the value
thereof to the Executors of his Wife; and also by the same Will he desired his
Feoffees at the request of his Wife to make Estates accordingly. The chief
question, and knot of the case is, whether Robert Bulleyn the Devisee has an
estate tail or not; and he said it seemed to him, he had but an estate tail:
and for that we are to see whether the payment ought to precede, or is
subsequent to the estate; and I think it is subsequent to the estate; For the
words are, my son Robert shall have my laud ten pound under the price it
cost, and so by the words he ought to have the land before any payment; and I
think he shall have the land by course of limitation; Limitation.
and if he do not pay the money, that R. B. shall have the land as Heir by
limitation; Crickmores case
and for that purpose he cited Crickmores case in 3 Elizab. where a man had two
Daughters, and devised his land to his eldest daughter, paying to the youngest
ten pound; there the eldest had all the land till she failed of payment of the
ten pound, and then it was adjudged that the youngest should have the moity by
way of limitation. Vellock and Heymonds case.
And 32 Eliz. it was adjudged in this Court inter Vellock and Heymond, where a
man devised Burrongh English land to the eldest brother, paying to the youngest
ten pound, and after the elder failed of payment, and the youngest entered by
way of limitation. And in this case these words, that Robert my son shall have
my land ten pound under the price it cost, will make a condition, as well as if
he had said, paying ten pound; and to prove that he cited Sir Edward Cleres
case, Sir Edward Cleres case.
that these words upon trust and confidence will not make a Condition, by
reason that the Devisor had a special trust and confid^nce in the Devisee; but
it is otherwise here, and in this case the estate of necessity ought to
precede the payment; for it is appointed that the payment shall be made to the
Executors of the woman, and so if the estate do not precede the payment, then
during the life of the woman the Devisee shall have no estate; for during her
life she cannot have Executors; and so by consequence can there be no payment:
Also the words of the Will are, I desire my Feoffees to make an estate at the
request of my Wife, so that his meaning was plain, that there should be an
estate made in the life of the Wife, for after her death she may not make
request; but it has been said, that the state should be Fee simple, for that
the words are, that he shall have the land ten pound under the price it cost,
and so these words paying shall carry the Fee simple: And as to that, I say
that it shall not against an expressed estate: Expressed estate
And for that 2 El. 117. a Frenchman devised lands to his Wife for life, the
remainder to C. F. and to the heirs Males of his body, and if he dye without
heirs of his body, the remainder over, and it was taken clearly, that the
general limitation, if he dyed without issue of his body, shall not alter the
special tail, for that the intent is apparent, and also he cited Claches
case, and Atkins case 34 Eliz. 33. Also in this case Robert Bulleyn the
Devisee is made Executor to the woman, so that if it were a condition
subsequent, he may not make payment to himself, but shall have the land
discharged of the condition, by reason of the impossibility; as if the woman
had dyed intestat, there is no person to whom the payment ought to be made, and
so the Devisee is discharged of the condition: Also in this case the Devisee
being eldest son, may not forsake the Devise, and take by descent, as in 3
Hen. 6. 46. it is for the benefit of him in remainder; but if he might waive,
he may not waive in pais, as 13 Rich. 2. Joyntenancy is adjudged: And also
when he enters at the first, he is seized by the Devise, for he has no other
right; for if he might waive, he in remainder shall not take.


Et adjornatur; but the Court seemed to lean that the estate should be a Fee
simple.

34.
BUry brought an Action upon his case for words against Chapel, Slander.
viz. He has been in Fowlers Tub (innuendo the Tub of one Fowler a Surgeon,
in which Tub no person had been but those which were laid of the Pox) I will
not say of the Pox, but he lay in the Tub that time that Lagman his Wife was
laid of the Pox; and tell thy Master his hair falls from his head, and he is a
pilled Knave, and a Rascal Knave, and a Villain, and no Christian, and thinks
there is neither heaven nor hell; and adjudged that the Action is not
maintainable.

35.

WIlkinson brought Error upon a Judgment given against him in the Common place.
Variance between emparlance and judgment roll for date of the Obligation.
And the case was that in Debt brought against Wilkinson in the Common place,
upon an Obligation bearing date 1^. die Novembris, the Defendant imparled, and
in the next Term the Plaintiff declared a new, prout patet, upon an Obligation
bearing date 12. Februarii, and upon nihil dicit had judgment. And now in the
Writ of Error brought by the Defendant the Plaintiff prays that it may be
amended. Gawdie and Fenner said it could not be amended, but the Lord Popham
and Clinch said it might be amended.

37.
SKelt brought an Assumpsit against Wright, and declared that the Defendant in
consideration of 10l. assumed to make two lights into one, New trial.
and upon non assumpsit pleaded, they were at issue, and the Record of nisi
prius was to make two lights and one, where it ought to be into one, and upon
that at the nisi prius the Plaintiff was non suit. And it was now moved whether
the Plaintiff ought to have a new venire facias upon the first issue, insomuch
as the first venire facias did not issue forth upon the first Record, and no
non suit: Et opini^ Curiae, that he may go to a new trial, but whether he
shall have a venire facias de novo, or that the old venire facias should serve,
the Court doubted, for that the first Jury was sworn.

38.
FOrd brought an Action of Debt against Glanvile and his Wife Administratrix
bonorum and Catellorum qua fuerunt Johannis S. durante minore aetate T. S.
Abatements.
The Defendant pleaded that hanging this action against them, the said T. S.
during whose nonage the Wife was Administratrix, came to full age: and if this
were a good Plea or no was the question, And adjudged a good Plea.

39.
UPon an information against Sr. Christopher Blunt a Juror was challenged for
want of Freehold, Freehold of a Juror.
and by examination was found that he had 20 shillings a year. Fenner and Gaudy
doubted whether this be sufficient Freehold or not, Popham and Clinch held it
is sufficient, for the Statute binds not the Queen, and by the Common law if he
had any Freehold it was sufficient.

Fenner This is a Statute made for the benefit of the Commonwealth, and
therefore the Queen shall be bound by it, though she be not named in it.


Gaudy Me thinks every Juror ought to have 40. s. Free hold at the least, by
the Common Law. No bill of enception against the Queen.



Cook No certainly, and if they do take the Law to be so, they may have a bill
of exception.


Tanfield We cannot have a bill of exception against the Queen; see the
Statute of 1 Hen. 5. cap. 3. that that is between party and party, and the
Statute of 8 Hen. 6. the preamble is between party and party.


But Popham commanded the Jury to be sworn, but Gaudy would have sent to the
Justices of the Common Pleas for their opinion, but the Juror was sworn by
Commandment of Popham, against the opinion of Justice Fenner.

PEr Cook; Proxime future.
If I am bound in an Obligation in Lent upon Condition to pay a lesser sum, in
quarta septimana quadragesima proximae futurae. This money shall be paid in
Lent Twelvemonth after; And so it is upon the Feast day of St Michael, I am
bound to pay a lesser Sum upon the Feast day of Saint Michaell, prox. futur.
without question said he, it shall be paid the Twelvemonth after, and not the
instant day.

41.
THE Duke of Norfolk Morgaged certain Lands to Rowland Haward, Demand.
Alderman of London, upon Condition, that if the said Duke do repay to the said
Alderman a certain Sum of money; That then the Duke might re-enter, and after
the Duke was attainted before the day of payment, Condition given to the Queen.
and all his Lands, Tenements, and Conditions were given to the Queen; And the
question moved at the Table in the Sergeants Inn, was, whether Sir Rowland
ought now to make a Demand of the money upon the Land, or to demand that at the
Receipt of the Exchequer, or that the Queen ought to make the tender upon the
Land; And it was agreed by all the Judges and Sergeants at dinner, that the
Queen ought to make no tender; But the Alderman ought to make his Demand at the
Exchequer, and not upon the Land.

42.
REdfrein agaiust I. S. an Action of the case was brought for words, Slander.
viz. I was robbed, and you were privy thereunto, and had part of my money. It
was pleaded in arrest of Judgment, that the words will not maintain an Action;
For that a man may be privy to a robbery after that it is made, and have part
of the money by honest means, and therefore it is no slander; but the whole
Court held the contrary; Infected. Smell of robbery.
as well as you are infected with a robbery and smell of the same, will
maintain an Action, so will these words, therefore Judgment was given for the
Plaintiff.

43.
MEggs against Griffyth brought an Action for these words, Slander.
viz. A woman told me, that she heard say, that Meggs Wife poisoned her Husband
in a mess of milk; and Judgment given for the Plaintiff.

44.
REvell against Heart, A Parsons Lease.
the case was upon the Statute of 13 Eliz. of Leases made by a Parson. Sergeant

Harris A Lease made by a Parson is not void against the Parson himself, no
more than a Lease made by a Bishop, which is not void against the Bishop
himself, as was judged in the case of the Bishop of Salisbury.


Fenner The Law is as you said, in a case of a Bishop, but the case of a Parson
percase will differ.


Popham If Rent be reserved, Rent reserved.
it is good against the Parson himself, otherwise not.


Clinch and Gaudy It is good against the Parson himself.


45.
WInch brought a Writ of Error against Warner, Space in the roll.
upon a Judgment in a Writ of Debt in the Common place upon Arrerage^ upon an
account; and it was assigned for Error, for that the Plaintiff in the Common
place, The emparlance roll is the Warrant.
in the first Declaration left a space for the day and year, And after
imparlance, he put in a new Declaration which was perfect. But for that the two
Declarations did not agree; and the first Declaration is the Warrant of all,
and therefore ought to be perfect, therefore the Judgment ought to be Reversed
for this default.

46.
IT appeared in Evidence inter Petties and Soam, Foractor.
upon an Assumsit for ware bought by the Factor of Soam, per opinionem Cur. If
one be Factor for a Merchant, to buy one kind of Stuff, as Tin, or other such
like; and the said Factor has not used to buy any other kind of wares but this
kind only for his Master, If now the said Factor buy Says or other
Commodities for his Master, and assume to pay money for that, Now the Master
shall be charged in an Assumpsit for the money, and for that let the Master
take heed what Factor he makes.

47.
A. B. being seized in Fee, Devise.
made his Will, and devised his Land to his Wife for life, the remainder to his
Son in Tail, and if he died without issue, the Land to remain to R. W. and his
Wife for their life's; and after their deceases, to their children. The question
is, whether the children of W. take by descent or as Purchasers. Popham and
Gawdie were of opinion, that they had an Estate Tail, But Fenner and Clinch,
but for life.

48.
WIlliam Gerrard was arrested by a Latitat, and put in bail by the name of
William Gerrat, Bail by a false name.
and the Plaintiff declared against him by the name of Gerrart, and all the
proceedings and issue was accordingly, and Judgment was had by Verdict tried
for the Plaintiff. And Gerrard pleaded in arrest of Judgment, for that there is
no bail entered: for the bail is for Gerrat, and his name is Gerrard.

Cook Attorney He may be known both by the one name and the other: For in
Norfork there is a Knight, which in Common speech is called Barmeston, but his
right name is Barnardiston; And if he by the name of Barmeston put in bail in
this Court, it is good, being known by the one and other; and so it seemed the
Court did incline for the dangerousness of the: President For otherwise every
man impleaded may give a false name to his Attorney, by which he will be
bailed, and then Plead that in arrest of Judgment, but Judgment was given for
the Plaintiff.


49.
IN debt upon an Obligation, Notice of a retorn from beyond sea.
the Condition was, that if the Obligee returned from beyond Sea before the 22
of April, and the Obligor pay to the said Obligee 200. l. before the twenty
seventh of April, then the Obligation to be void (Otherwise to stand in force)
Cook moved that the Obligee ought to give notice to the Obligor of his
retorning from beyond Sea before the two and twentieth day of April, or
otherwise the Obligor is not bound to pay him the money: For when a thing
rests in the will of another to be done, and the time is uncertain when it
shall be done, Then notice ought to be given to him which ought to do the
thing, as 18 and 19 Eliz. 354. placi^. 32. and 17 Eliz. A man made a Lease for
years, And after made a new Lease to Commence after determination, Forfeiture,
or Surrender of the first Lease, with clause of Re-entry for non payment of the
Rent, And after the Lessor took a secret surrender of the first Lessee, and
after that surrender a Rent day incurred, and the Rent was not paid by the
second Lessee, and yet adjudged that his Estate is not void, because the other
ought to give him notice of the Surrender.

Gaudy The case is not alike, for 8 Edw. 4. a man ought to take notice of an
Abitrement.


Fenner It shall be as dangerous for the Obligee, if he ought to give notice,
as for the other to take notice.


50.
STafford brought an Action of Trespass against Bateman, Distress for issues
for of a strangers beasts Levant.
for taking of a Cow; The Defendant said, that the Land where the Trespass was
supposed to be made, is the Land of one John Dean; The which I. D. has lost
iiij. l. issues to the Queen, and there came a Warrant out of the Exchequer to
the now Defendant, being undersherif, to levy the said iiij. l. in the Lands of
the said I. D. And because this Cow was Levant and Couchant within the said
Land, he took her, as lawful was for him to do.

Gaudy and Fenner The Sherif may not take Beasts of a stranger in the Land of
him that has lost issues to the Queen.


Popham By way of distress, he may take Beasts of a stranger, if they be Levant
and Couchant upon the Land of him that has lost issues, but not to sell them,
and so to levy the Issues.


51.
ERror was brought by An. Latham, Error.
upon a Judgment given against him in a Writ of Debt in the Common place, and
the Error assigned was, for that the Original Writ was purchased against him
by the name of A. L. nuper de London Yeoman, alias A. L. de Sherb^^^ in Com.
Ebor. Variance in the alias no error.
Yeoman. And upon that, the said An. L. appeared and pleaded, and was
condemned, and after a Capias ad satisfaciend. issued against him by the name
of A. L. nuper de L. Yeoman, alias A. L. de Shelb^^^ in Com. Ebor. Yeoman, and
so he assigned the variance between the first Original, and the Capias ad
satisfaciendum, Shelbone for Sherbone, but for that this variance was not in
the first name, but in the first Addition, therefore it was adjudged no Error
by the opinion of the Court.

52.
LAugford and Bushy did present by turns to the Advowson of Norwinkfield; Quare
imp.
Langford presented one A. which was instituted, Pasch. 43 Eliz
and inducted, and dyed; Bushy presented one C. which C. was lawfully deprived
by the Bishop of Coventrey and Lichfield, without giving any notice to Langford
who had the next turn: The Bishop made Collation, and after Collation Langford
sold his moity to Lee, Collation before notice.
and Lee to the Earl of Shrewsburie: The question was, whether by the Collation
Langford has lost his turn. The Court seemed to incline, that by the Collation
the turn is lost, for if it had been by usurpation it had been lost without any
question. And yet it seems, that upon deprivation the Patron ought to have
notice. Vide Statut. de 13 Eliz.

53.
YElverton the Queens Sergeant demanded the opinion of the Court, Devise.
if a man be seized of land in Fee, and have two Daughters only, and devises
his land to his Daughters in Fee, if now the two Daughters shall be
Joyntenants, or take by descent as parceners; and the opinion of the Court was,
that they are in by the Devise, and not by descent, and so they shall be in as
Joyntenants, and not as Parceners; but otherwise it shall be if there were but
one Daughter, and the Father devise the land to her; so if he devise the land
to his Son and Heir in fee.

54.
NEcton and Sharp Executors of Throward sued a Prohibition against Gennet and
others, Prohibition for a Legacy.
and the case was, that one that had a Legacy devised unto him, sued the now
Plaintifs being Executors, for the said Legacy, in the Spiritual Court, and the
Executors there pleaded, that the Testator in his life time made a certain
Obligation sufficient in Law to J. S. the which is not yet satisfied, and the
Spiritual Court would not allow this Plea, for which he had a Prohibition.
Makin, Attorney of Essex, said to me, that this is the second case in question
of this point, but he doubted that the pleading was so vitiou^, that the matter
in Law would not come in question.

Executors represent the person of their Testator, and therefore if a release
be made by one of them, Action confessed by one Executor by admittance.
this shall bind all; and so if an Action is brought against one Executor where
there be diverse Executors, and he admit the Writ, and confess the Action, this
shall bind all the goods of the dead as well as if they were all named, Per
H^rn.

55.
GReningham brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation against Ewer; Election.
The Condition was, that if the said Ewer do deliver unto the said Greningham
certain Obligations which the said Ewer has of the said Greninghams, or else
do seal such a release as the said G. shall devise, before Mich. that then,
etc. The Defendant pleaded that before the said Feast of St. Mich. the said G.
did not tender to him any acquittance.

Gawdie The Obligation is void; for in so much as the Obligee has not tendered
to him any acquittance, therefore he has tolled from him the election, whereof
he shall not take advantage.


Fenner e contra for the election is not in the Party, for the making ^o the
acquittance rests in the will of the Obligee, and so the Obligor has no
election.


Popham was of the same opinion.

56.
IF a Sheriff do execute his Writ, the same day that the Writ is retornable,
Execution of a writ done the day of the retorn.
it is a good execution, per Yelverton, and he cited these cases. A Judgment
given in a quare impedit, 18. Eliz. and the Writ of damages was executed the
same day that it was retornable, and this matter pleaded in arrest of
judgment, and notwithstanding the party had judgment, and if a capias ad
satisfaciendum go forth, and the Sheriff take the Party the same day that the
Writ is retornable, and send him into the Court, who will say that this is not
a good execution?

57.
WOodcock brought an Action of Debt against Heru, Assets
Executor of I. S. The Defendant pleaded, that the Testator in his life time
made a Statute Staple to one I. K. in the sum of 1000 l. and above that he has
nothing; And if this Plea be good or not is the question.

Fenner The Plea is good without question.


Gawdie I have heard diverse learned men doubt of that; for, if the Testator
were bound in a Statute to perform Covenants which are not yet broken, and it
may be they will never be broken; and then he shall never be chargeable by this
Statute, and yet he shall never be compelled to pay any debts, which will be a
great inconvenience. And again; I think there will be a greater mischief of the
other part; for, put the case if the Executors do pay this debt, and the
Statute is broken, after he shall be chargeable by a devastavit of his own
proper goods, the which will be a greater inconvenience.


58.
BRough against Dennyson brought an Action for words, Slander.
viz. Thou have stolen by the highway side.

Popham The words are not actionable, for, it may be taken, that he stole upon
a man suddenly, as the common proverb is, that he stole upon me, innuendo, that
he came to me unawares: And when a man creeps up a hedge, the common phrase
is, he stole up the hedge.


Fenner When the words may have a good construction, you shall never construe
them to an evil sense. And it may be intended he stole a stick under a hedge,
and these words are not so slanderous, that they are actionable.


59.
A Copyholder was not upon his Land to pay his rent, Forfeiture of a copy-hrld.
when the Lord was there to demand it: And whether this were a forfeiture or
not was the question.

Fenner It is no forfeiture if there were not an express denial; for, the
non-payment here is but negligence, the which is not so heinous an injury as a
wilful denial; for, it may be that the Copyholder, being upon the Land, has
no money in his purse, and therefore it shall be a very hard construction to
make it a forfeiture. But if he make many such defaults it may be it shall be
deemed a forfeiture.


Popham If this shall not be a forfeiture, there will grow great danger to the
Lord, and the Copyholders estate was of small account in ancient time, and now
the strength that they have obtained is but conditionally (to wit) pay their
rent, and doing their sevices, and if they fail of any of these the Condition
is broken, and it seems clear if the rent be payable at our Lady day, Demand
after the day.
and the Lord does not come then, but after the day, to demand the rent, there
is no forfeiture.


60.
THe Case was that there was Lessee for life, Sir Henry Knevit against Poole
interest of Corn.
the Remainder for life, and the first Lessee for life made a lease for years,
and this Lessee was put out of possession by a stranger, and the stranger sowed
the Land, and the first Lessee for life dyed, and he in remainder for life
entered into the Land, and leased it to Sir Henry Knevit, and who should have
the corn was the question. Tanfeild argued that Sir H. K. being Lessee of the
Tenant for life in remainder, shall have the corn; for the reason for which a
man, which has an uncertain estate shall have the corn, is, for that he has
manured the land, and for that it is reason that he that labors should reap
the fruit; but he said that the stranger that sowed the land, shall not have
the corn, Lease of ground sowed.
because his estate begun by wrong; for if a man make a lease for life of
ground sowed, and before severance the Lessee dyed, now his Executor shall not
have the corn, Assignment after sowing concess. per Popham cont. per Gaudy.
for that they came not of the manurance of their Testator; so it is if the
Lessee for life sow the land, and assign over his interest, and dye, now the
Assign shall not have the corn, cansa qua supra: and for this reason in our
case, neither the Executors of the first Tenant for life, nor the Lessee of the
first Tenant for life shall have the corn, here, for that it comes not by their
manurance; and the stranger which sowed them, he shall not have them;
Uncertainty necessary, unnecessary difference.
for albeit he manured the land, and howbeit his estate was defeasable upon an
uncertainty, yet he was a wrong doer, and the incertainty of his estate came by
his own wrong, for which the law will never give any favor to him; and for
that when he in remainder for life enters, it seems that he shall have the
corn, for he has right to the possession, and the corn are growing upon the
soil, and by consequence are belonging to the owner of the soil; but it has
been said, that here there was no trespass done to him in remainder, and for
that he shall never have the corn. Sir, as to that I say, if an Abator after
the death of the Ancestor, enter, and sow the land, Abator sows.
and after the right heir enter, in this case the heir shall have the corn,
and yet no trespass was made to him, and it has been adjudged in this Court,
where a man devised land sowed, to one for life, and after his decease the
remainder to another for life, and the first Tenant entered and dyed before
severance, and he in remainder entered, that there he in remainder shall have
the corn, and by consequence the same Law shall be in our case. Godfrey e
contra; and he argued that the Lessee for years, Devise of land sown.
of the first Lessee for life, shall have the corn; for if Lessee for life,
leaseth for years, and this Lessee for years sow the land, and the Lessee for
life dye, now the Lessee for years shall have the corn, by reason of his right
to the land at the time of his sowing, and never lawfully divested by any Act
done by himself, and he denied the cases put by Mr. Tanfield, and so concluded.

Gawdie The lessee for years of the Tenant for life shall have the corn, and he
denied some of the cases put by Mr. Tanfield, for in the case where Tenant for
life sowes the land, and after assigns over his esttae, now if Tenant for life
dye, the Assign shall have the corn as well as the Executors of the Tenant for
life, if he had not assigned over his estate. But I agree the case of the
devise for life, of land sowed, with the remainder for life, for there he in
remainder shall have them, and the laches of the not entry of the Lessee for
years shall not prejudice him; Lessee for years ousted.
for, it appears by 19. H. 6. if Lessee for years of Tenant for life be
ousted, and after the Tenant for life dye, yet the Lessee for years shall have
trespass, with a continuando for all the mean profits; The which proves that
they belong to him, so is it in 38. H. 6. Lessee at will ousted.
If Lessee at will be ousted, and after the Lessor dye, now the Lessee shall
have a trespass with a continuando without regress, for, when he may not
enter, Regress.
the law supplyeth it, and the mean profits do belong to him. And by
consequence in this case the corn belongs to the Lessee for years, Ground let
for life after sowing.
of the Tenant for life.


Popham Sir Henry Knevit shall not have the Corn; for if a man lease for life
ground which is sown, and the Lessee dye, now the Lessor shall have the Corn,
and not the Executors of the Lessee for life. And he agreed with Mr. Tanfeild
in the case of the Assignee of Tenant for life, of ground sowed, and the Tenant
for life dye, that he in Reversion shall have the Corn: Disseisor sow the land
of tenant for life.
And if a Disseisor sow the land of Tenant for life, and the Tenant for life
dye, now the Executors of the Tenant for life shall have the Corn, and not the
Disseisor, nor he in Reversion; and by consequence the Lessee for years of the
first Lessee for life in this case. Fenner was of the same opinion; and after
it was adjudged that Knevit should have the land, and that Poole should have
the Corn, because of his possession.


61.
RAme sued a Prohibition against Patteson, Prohibition for Dotards.
and the question was, if Trees which are above the age of twenty years become
rotten, and are cut down for fuel shall pay Tyths or not, and the opinion of
the Court was, that they shall not; for Tithes are payable for an increase, and
not for a decrease; and being once privileged in regard of hie nature, this
privilege shall not be lost in regard of his decrepitage.

62.
PArtridge brought an Action of Debt against Naylor upon the Statute of 1 and 2
P. and M. 12. Empounding.
For taking of a Distress in one County, and driving it into another; and the
case was, that three men distreined a flock of Sheep, and them impounded in
several places, and if every of them shall forfeit a hundred shillings
severally, or but all together a hundred shillings. Common place.
The Court was divided, for the words of the Statute is that every person so
offending shall forfeit to the party grieved for every such offense a hundred
shillings, and treble damages; but Walmisley thought that every one should
forfeit a hundred shillings, and he put a difference between person and party,
for many persons may make but one party.

63.
BY Popham chief Justice of England by the Statute of 28 Ed. 3. cap. 10. Fine
for Error in inferior Courts.
Erroneous Judgment in London was a forfeiture of their. Liberties, but after
that by the Statute of 1 Hen 4. cap. 15. this was mitigated, and was made
finable; as in Chester, if they give an erroneous Judgment they shall forfeit
an hundred pound; for these inferior Courts which have peculiar Jurisdictions
ought to do justly, for if these Courts shall not be restrained with penalties,
Justice will be neglected; and before the Statute of 28 Ed. 3. those of London
might not reform Errors in London.

NOta per Doctor Amias in the Lord Souch his case, Caveat.
if a Church become void, and a stranger enters a Caveat with the Register of
the Bishop, that none be instituted to that Church until he be made privy
thereunto, and the Bishop before that he have notice of the Caveat institutes
an Incumbent, the Institution is merely void in the Spiritual Law; for the
Register ought to notify the Caveat to the Bishop, and his negligence in that
shall not prejudice him that entered the Caveat; and if the Bishop have notice
of the Caveat, and gives day to him that puts that in, and before that day he
institutes an Ineumbent, this is merely void; for the entering of the Caveat is
as a Supersedeas in our Law.

THornton brought an Action upon an Assumpsit against Kemp, Day of payment.
and declared that the Testator was indebted to him in ten pound, and in
consideration that the Plaintiff would give day to the Defendant, being
Executor, to pay that, until Michaelmas, he assumed to pay that, and in facto
dicit, that he has given day, and yet the Defendant has not that paid: The
Defendant pleaded in bar that post praedictam assumptionem factam, and before
Michaelmas, the Plaintiff did arrest him for the same Debt, and demands
Judgment, and upon that the Plaintiff demurred.

Gaudy When he has given to him day of payment, usque ad Michaelmas, allbeit
he arrest him before that time, yet if he do not receive the money before
Michaelmas, the consideration is performed.


Fenner I deny that, for to what purpose is the giving of day of payment until
Michaelmas, if in the mean time he may sue him.


Popham I agree with my brother Gaudy, for insomuch that he only forbears the
payment until Michaelmas, and does not promise to forbear to sue him, the
payment is forborne if the money be not received.

SHerington ^ued a Prohibition against Fleetwood Parson de Orrell, Prohibition.
in Com. Linc. for that, that the said Parson libelled in the Spiritual Court
for Tyths of Agistments, and the now Plaintiff being Defendant in the Spiritual
Court, pleaded that he had always paid twelve pence by the year for every
Milch Cow going in such a Pasture, and for this payment he had been discharged
of payment of Tithes for all Agistments in that land. Payment for one thing
shall not discharge another.


Popham This payment of money for Milch beasts shall not discharge him for the
payment of Tithes for other beasts, and Tithes shall not be paid for beasts fed
for the occupation of the house of the owner; No tyths for things spent in the
house.
but if a man feed to sell, there shall Tyths be paid for those, for with the
first people live, which manure the land of which the Tithes are paid, for so
is Fitzh. Not. brev. 53. Q. to be intended.

WIldgoose versus Wayland in Cancellar. Notice of trust.
This question arose, If A. be seized upon trust and confidence to the use of
B. and his Heirs, and A. sells the land to one that has notice of the trust,
to whose use shall the Vendee be seized? Also it was moved if before the sale
one come to the Vendee, and say to him, take heed how ye buy such land; for A.
has nothing in that but upon trust to the use of B. and another comes to the
Vendee, and says to him, It is not as he is informed, for A. is seized of this
land absolutely, by which the Vendee buyeth the land; if this first Caveat
given to him, ut supra, be a sufficient notice of the trust or not: And the
Lord Keeper said it is not, for flying-reports are many times fables and not
truth; and if it should be admitted for a sufficient notice, then the
Inheritance of every man might easily be slandered. Notice of Forgery.


Cook It was holden in Bothes case in the Starchamber, that if a man said to
another, take heed how you publish such a Writing, for it is forged, and
notwithstanding the party does publish it, this is a sufficient notice to the
publisher that the Deed was forged: And upon that the Lord Popham at the same
time put this case, Notice of Felony.
If one say to me, take heed how you entertain or receive A. B. for he has
committed such a Felony, and I giving no credit to the report receive the
party, where in truth he had committed the Felony, now I am accessory to this
Felony. To which the Lord Keeper answered, that he would not draw blood upon
such an opinion.

IF a man make a Lease reserving Rent to the Lessor, Reservation of Rent.
if he say no more, the Rent shall go but to the Lessor; but if it be reserved
generally, and do not say to whom, it shall go as well to the Heir of the
Lessor, as to the Lessor himself. Per Gaudy.

IT was said by Fell, Hue and Cry.
an Attorney of the King's Bench, that it has been adjudged in the same Court,
that an Action upon the Statute of Hue and Cry against Inhabitants of any
Hundred, will never lie by Bill, but ought to be sued by Writ, and the reason
is, for that the Action is brought against Inhabitants, which are a multitude,
and for that may not be in custodia Marescalli, as another private person may.

A Judgment was had in an Action of Debt of 80 l. And the Plaintiff had a Fieri
facias, Capias after a Fieri sacias executed for parcel.
and the Sherif levied 20 l. of the goods of the Defendant, and returned that
of Record, but non constat by the Record whether the Plaintiff had received the
20 l. or not, and the Plaintiff took forth a Cap. ad satisfaciend. for the whole
Execution, being 80 l. and upon that the Defendant was Utlawed; and now he
brought a Writ of Error to reverse that Utlary, which was reversed, for that it
did appear upon Record that execution was made by Fieri fac. of 20 l. of the 80
l. and therefore the Cap. ad satisfaciend. should have been but 60 l.

not make any demand, or claim of her Dower within five years after the death of
her Husband, she shall be barred.

A Feofment was made before the Statute of 27. to the use of a Man and Woman
unmarried, Moities in Tail.
and of the Heirs of their two bodies begotten, and after they intermarried,
and after marriage the Husband bargained and sold all the land in fee, to one
of his Feoffees, and died without issue, and after the Statute of 27 was made
the Wife claymed the whole by Survivor as Tenant in tail after possibility of
issue extinct. And by the opinion of all the Court without argument she can
have but the Moity, because the Husband and Wife had Moities as Joyntenants, by
reason of the Joyntenancy made before marriage, And yet by the Court as to the
issue in tail if any had beeen, he shall have a Formdon of the whole.

73.
IF Land be holden of a Subject, Tenure and Wardship extinct.
and the Tenant sells the land by Fine, with Proclamations, to I. S. in tail,
the Remainder to her Majesty in fee, The Tenant in tail dies his Issue within
age, The Opinion of the Court was that the Issue shall not be in ward to the
Subject if the Queen do not assent to her Remainder, for that the tenure and
services are gone and extinct by the Fee simple to the Queen, which may hold of
none. And so the issue in tail shall be in ward to none.

74.
IF a man have goods to the value of 100l. and is indebted in 20l. and he

all his goods.
and make his Executors, and dies, And the Executors pay the 20l. yet the Wife
shall have the moity of the whole estate, viz. 50l. without any defalcation, so
that the Executors have Assets besides.

IN a Prohibition and the Case was this, Benefield against Feek. Tithe of
Saffron.
the Farmor of a Parsonage sued in he Spiritual Court for Tithes of Saffron
against a Vicar; The Vicar pleaded that time out of memory of man, the Vicar
and his predecessors have had the Tithe of all Saffron growing within the
parish. A Prohibition for the Pla^ntif in the Spiritual Court upon his own
lihell.
The Plaintiff pleaded that the land, where the Saffron was growing this year,
by the space of 40 years next before had been sown with Corn, whereof the
Parson and his predecessors have had the Tithe. And the Spiritual Court would
not allow this Plea. For which the party prayed a Prohibition.

Tanfield. The right of the Tithe comes in question between the Parson and
Vicar, Howbeit that the Farmor be made party to the suit, and for that the
right of Tithes being in question between two Spiritual men, Suit between
persons spiritual.
This Court has no Jurisdiction. And this very point was adjudged 30. Eliz.
inter Hunt and Bush, in this Court, that in such case the party shall have a
consultation.


Popham The one of the parties is a man temporal, and so was it not in your
case. Sic nota, that by the Spiritual law, the Vicar shall have Tithes of
Saffron of land newly sown with Saffron, albeithat before the Parson had the
Tith of that land being sown with Corn.

77.
BEckford brought an ejectione firm against Parnecote, Devise before purchas^.
and the Case upon the special Verdict was found to be this, That one Parsons
was seized of certain land in A. and had issue four Daughters, viz. Barbera,
Johan, E. and Mary, and made his Will in writing, And by the same Will, he
devised all his land in Aldeworth to Barbera and Johan two of his daughters,
and made them two his Executors, and after he purchased other land in Aldworth,
and a stranger was desirous to purchase this land of him newly purchased, And
he said that that land should go with the residue of his land to his
Executors, as his other land should go; After the said Testator made a Codicill
and caused it to be annexed to his Will, But the Codicill was of other things,
and mentioned nothing of this land, and whether this new purchased land shall
pass by the Will, without new publication of the Will for this land, was the
question.

Moor I think that the land newly purchased shall pass, and to prove that he
said, that the reason in Bretts case 340. Com. for which land newly purchased
shall not pass, is by reason that there is no manner of new publication, but in
our case there is new publication, and in Trivillians case 4 M. 143. where
cestui quae use made a Will, And then the Statute of 27 H. 8. of uses came, now
this Will was comptrouled, The Statute of Wills.
but by a new publication it may be made good, and he cited 44. E. 3. 12. and
44 Ass. 36.


Atkinson e contra. For this Will ought to be warranted by the Statute,
otherwise it is not good, and the Statute does not enable him which has no
land at the time of the devise, to devise land, and the words of the Statute
manifest this, which are, Where any person or persons having any land, holden
etc. So by the express words, Want of apt words.
if he have no lands at the time of the Devise, he may not Devise, as appears
plainly in Brets case, also it appears that words out of a Will, will never
make that to pass which was intended before, and with that agrees the Lord
Cheney his case, and the case of Downhall and Catesby lately adjudged, and in
this case, allbeit the Testator allowed this Will after to be his Will, Things
not expressed in the Will must be expressed in the publication.
yet this shall never make this land newly purchased to pass without express
publication of this land.


Clinch Justice said, it seemed to him that the land newly purchased shall
pass; for after that he had made his last purchase, the Testator heard the Will
read, and by that he devised all his lands in Aldworth, and then knew that the
land newly purchased lay in Aldworth, and upon reading of the Will he allowed
it, and so I think that the new purchased land shall pass as well as the other,
and that this allowance upon the reading is a new publication

Gaudy Justice e contra For if I make my Will, and by that devise all my land
in Dale, and after I purchase other land there, and one afterward shows me the
Will, and demands of me if it shall be my Will, and I answer, it shall, I say
that this land newly purchased shall not pass; Hearing and allowance is a
publication.
and in this case howbeit that the reading of the Testament, or annexing of the
Codicill be a new publication, yet it does not manifest the intent to be that
more shall pass by that than he intended at the first; and also the new
reading of the Will, and the annexing of the Codicill may not properly be
termed a new publication as this case is; Where there it no controlment there
needs no new publication.
for here was not any Controlment, and for that the Will needs not any new
publication, by which it seems that without any express publication for this
land newly purchased, this land shall not pass; for the things which are found
to be done are but allowances, and no new publications.

HArecourt brought a Writ of Error upon a Judgment given in the Commonplace,
Amendment
and assigned for Error for that the Judgment was that the now Defendant
should recover xx l. assessed to him per Jnr. nec non x l. bassessed to him hic
per Jur. where it ought to be per Cur. Yelverton prayed that it might be
amended, for that the Record in the Commonplace was right, and the Misprision
which made this Error was in the Clerk which certified the Record; and the
opinion of the Conrt was, that if it were so, it should be amended; and
therefore they said they would have the Record it self brought out of the
Commonplace thither to be viewed whether it were so or not. The Record it self
shall not be sent out of the Court.


Worley Clerk The Justices of the Commonplace will not suffer the Record to be
brought hither.


Popham That is no new President that the Record shall be brought hither; for I
have seen it done before this time: But after in truth the Justices of the
Commonplace would not send their Record into the King's Bench; and therefore
Cook the Queens Attorney prayed that it might be amended.


Popham It may not be amended, for that I have spoken with the Justices of the
Common place, and they say, that the Record was at the first as it was
certified, viz. Iur. pro. Cur.


and after the Record was certified, it was amended by a Clerk without any
Warrant.

Cook Allbeit that it was so, yet under Correction it is amendable, for it is
the misprission but of a Clerk, and that of a Letter only, viz. of I. for this
letter C. for the word is written Jur. short, where it ought to have been Cur,
No amendment in ^^int of Judgment.
and so amendable by the Statute of 8 Hen. 6. Curta e contra, for it is parcel
of the Judgment, and you never saw the Judgment of the Court amended, for
which it cannot be amended here.


79.
EAst Executor of I. S. brought an Action upon the case of finding and
Converting of certain goods, Trover.
against Newman, And upon not guilty pleaded, the Jury found this special
Verdict, viz. That the Testator was possessed of diverse goods, and them lost,
and the Defendant found them, And knowing them to be the goods of the Testator
upon demand denied to deliver them, And if this denial was a Conversion they
prayed the discretion of the Court.

Fenner I think that the denial is a Conversion; Denial is a Conversion.
for when I lose my goods, and they come to your hands by finding, and you deny
to deliver them to me, I shall have an Action of Trespass against you, as 33.
Hen. 6. is. Keeping is an Administration.
And the very keeping of goods by an Executor shall be counted as an
Administration; and by the same reason, the denial here shall be counted a
Conversion.


Gaudy I am of the same opinion, for by 2 of Hen. 7. If I deliver to you Cloth
to keep, and you keep it negligently, I shall have detinue or an Action upon
the case, at my pleasure, and by 20 Hen. 7. if a Baker contract for Corn, and
the party do not deliver it at the day, the party may have Debt or an Action of
the case.


Tanfield There was a case in this Court, 30 Eliz. for the finding and
Conversion of a horse. But here was no request made by the Plaintiff to deliver
the horse; For which Judgment was given against the Plaintiff.


Curia This is not like our case, for the request and denial makes all the
wrong in this case.

WIseman brought a Writ of Error against Baldwin, Limitation.
upon a Judgment given in Trespass in the Common place upon a special
Verdict, which was, that Baldwin was seized of 24 Acres of Land, and made his
Will, and by the same devised his said Land to Henry his youngest Son when he
should accomplish the age of 24 years, upon Condition, that he should pay 20.
l. to the Daughter of the Devisor; And if he shall happen to dye before his age
of 24 years, then he willed that Richard his eldest Son shall have the same
Land, upon Condition, that he should pay to the said Daughter 20. l. And he
willed further by the said Will, that if both his Sons failed of payment of
the said 20. l. to his Daughter, that the said Land should remain to his
Daughter. And after this Devisor died, and Henry his younger Son entered after
the age of 24 years, and did not pay the said 20. l. to the Daughter, and
Richard the eldest Son did enter upon him; and whether his entry were lawful
or not was the question. Cook Attorney said, it was a mere Limitation and no
Condition, and by consequence the entry of the eldest Son is not lawful, and
to prove that he cited a Case which he said was in Justice Dallisont reports 9
Eliz. where a man devised Land to his youngest Son, upon Condition of payment
of a certain sum of money to his Daughter, as our case is, The Remainder over
to another of his youngest Sonns, and the first Devisee entered, and did not pay
the money; and he in Remainder took advantage of that, and so in our case, by
the Devise Richard is to have nothing, if Henry the youngest Son did not die
before 24 years, and the intent of the Devisor appears that his Daughter shall
have the Land for non payment of the money; And therefore if the Heir enter for
the Condition broken he destroies the whole intent of the Devisor; And
therefore the entry of the eldest Son is not lawful.

Godfery I think it is a mere Condition, for so are the words. And then when
the word subsequent, limit a Remainder to the Daughter for default of payment,
that is not good, and he denied the case cited out of Justice Dallison, for he
said he was dead long before An. 9 Eliz.


Gaudy I take the case of 29 Hen. 8. 33. to be a Limitation, and no Condition,
for there a man devised to the Prior and Covent of St. Bartholomewes, Ita quod
reddant decano and capitulo sancti Pauli 16. l. per An. And if they failed of
payment, that their estate should cease, and that the Land should Remain to the
said Dean and Chapter, and their Successors. And it seems there, that the
Dean and Chapter for non payment shall not enter; But I think the contrary, and
I think in this case it is a Limitation and no Condition. A remainder and a
recovery may be created by one deed.



Fenner If I make a Lease for life upon Condition, with Remainder over, may my
Heir enter for the Condition broken?


Godfry Yes Sir.


Fenner Nay truly, for then he shall defeat the Remainder, which is well
limited by me before, the which I may not do, and this is the reason; if I make
a Lease for life upon Condition, and after grant the Reversion over, that
before the estate the Condition was gone, for that, if I reenter I shall defeat
my own grant


Gaudy Per 29. Ass. If a man devise to one upon Condition, that if he shall be
a Chaplin, to remain over to a Corporation, and the Tenant was made Chaplin, by
which the Heir entered, and an Assise was adjudged maintainable against him, for
his entry was not lawful.


Clinch The intent of the Devisor appears, that for default of payment, the
Daughter shall have the Land, and therefore the Son shall not enter. And
Wilcocks case in this Court, was, that a man seized of a Copyhold in the nature
of Borough English, surrendered that to the use of his Will, and by his Will
devised the Land to his eldest Son, upon Condition that he should pay to the
youngest Son x. l. And after for non payment the youngest Son entered, and
his entry was adjudged lawful.


Gaudy We three are agreed, that it is a Limitation and no Condition, by which
the first Judgment was reversed.


81.
PYne of Lincolns Inn brought an Assumpsit against Widow Hide as Executrix of
her Husband, Assumpsit of the testator.
and declared, that the Testator in Consideration that the Plaintiff had leased
to him certain Copyhold-land, he assumed to pay to him 100. l. And the
Defendant demurred in Law, for that the Action is not maintainable against any
Executor upon an Assumption of the Testator.

Popham For the Contrariety of opinion in this Case between the Judges of the
Commonplace and us, we will make it an Exchequer-Chamber case, and so try the
Law.


82.
ONe Jackson prayed a Prohibition, Prohibition for a Parsons lease.
and showed for his Cause, the the Parson sued him in the spiritual Court for
tithes, And howt the Statute of 13 El. cap. 20. etc. That if any Parson make a
Lease for years of his Parsonage, and absent himself by the space of 80 days,
that the Lease shall be void, And the Parson shall forfeit the profits of his
benefice for a year, and the Statute of 14 Eliz. cap. 11. etc. That all bonds
and Covenants for suffering or permiting any Parson to enjoy any Benefice, or
to take any Benefice, or to take the profits and fruits thereof shall be
adjudged of such force and Validity, as Leases made by the same persons of
benefices and not otherwise, and after the Statute of 18 Eliz. cap. 11. etc.
appoints, that the Ordinary after complaint made, and sentence given against
any such incumbent, whereby he ought or shall lose one years profits of his
Benefice, shall grant Sequestration to one of the inhabitants of the same
Parish, as he shall think meet; And upon default there in by the Ordinary, that
it may and shall be lawful to every Parishoner where the Benefice is, to
retein, and keep his or their tithes, and likewise for the Churchwardens to
enter and take the profits of the Glebe lands, and other Rents and duties of
every such Benefice, to be employed to the use of the poor, and he showed how
that the Parson made a Covenant and a Bond, that he would permit I. S. to take
the profits of his Benefice for a year, And whether this were such a Lease, for
which the Parson ought to forfeit the profits, ut super, he prayed the opinion
of the Court, and it seemed to them it is not; the reason seems to be,
because he does not aver him to be absent above 80 days in the same year.

PEr Popham If a man find my horse, Conversion.
and after ride him, and then delivers the horse unto me, and I bring an Action

84.
CHesson brought an assumpsit against D. K. Abatement of debt.
and declared that where I. S. was indebted to him in 64l. The Defendant in
consideration that the Plaintiff would abate 10l. parcel of the said Debt, and
also would give day to the said I. S. until Michaelmas then next following for
payment of the said 54 l. residue, That the next day after she the said
Defendant would become bound to the now Party for the payment of the said 54.
l. at the said Feast of St. Michael, and the Plaintiff in facto says, that he
has abated 10. l. parcel of the said 64. l. and yet the Defendant did not
become bounden for the payment of the said 54. l. residue, per quod actio
accrevit. The Defendant pleaded in Bar, That after the said day given, and
before Michaelmas, scil. tali die, the Plaintiff entered a plaint in London, for
the Debt aforesaid of 64. l. Arrest before the day given for payment.
and then caused the said I. S. to be arrested, and demanded judgment, si
actio.

Tanfield The Declaration is sufficient, for you have delared, that you have
abated part of the debt, but you have not showed how that was defaulked, and
therefore not good, for we may take issue upon that if we will; and if a man be
bound in an Obligation, to discharge me of certain rent, it is no plea for him
to say, that he has me discharged, without showing how; for that, that I may
take issue upon tha^. Also to the second matter, the Plaintiff ought not only
to give day of payment, but also to forbear to molest I. S. until the day be
come.


Cook to the contrary, And as to the first poiut it seems, that the discharge
ought to be upon the entering into bond; Bond for parcel of a contract.
for, if a man make a Contract for 10. l. and after enter into bond for 5 l.
parcel of that, all the Contract is gone, as appears per 3. H. 4. And as to
the second point, I think the promise is broken by the Defendant, for that he
did not enter into Bond the next day after the assumption made.


Gawdie I doubt whether the Declaration be good or not; for, it seems to me
that the Plaintiff ought to show how he has defaulked the 10. l. part of the
64. l. for, it may not be intended a defaulking in Law, but of a defaulking
indeed, and for that it is not like the case cited in 3. H. 4. But the
Plaintiff ought to do an Act himself, And 17. Eliz. A man was bound to allow,
ratify, and confirm a term for years, And it is no Plea to say that he has
that confirmed, But he ought to show how, because every Confirmation must be by
Deed; but if the Declaration were good, then perchance the Bar would not be
good: And howbeit that Mr. Attorney has said, that there is a breach for not
entering into Bond, yet the Plaintiff may not sue, Every discharge to be by
writing.
if he have not performed his promise.


Fenner It will be hard to make the Declaration good; for, when one promises
to defaulk his debt, this shall be intended a lawful discharge, which cannot
be otherwise than by writing, and per 20. E. 3. Account. If a man be bound to
acknowledge a Statute, For the intent must also be performed.
and he does acknowledge the same, but yet keeps the same in his own hands,
this is no performance. And as to the second point, when one promises, in
confideration of one thing to do another, there ought to be performance of the
first, as if a man be bound to make a new Pale, Disturbance of the
consideration.
as 9. Edw. 4. 20. and 15. Edw. 4. 2. 3. is, having the old pale for his
labor, there if the old pale be taken from him, he is not bound to make the
new pale.


Popham I am of the same opinion.


85.
DIxon brought an Action upon the case against Adams, Assump^it in
consideration that a man will voluntarily do that act which otherwise he should
have been compelled to doc.
and declared that whereas I. S. was indebted to the said Adams in 60. l.
forwhich the said Adams arrested the said I. S. and the said Dixon was (...)
for the said I. S. in the said suit, and the said Adams recovered in the said
suit, and after sued forth a Scire facias against the said Dixon being bail,
whereupon the said Adams, in confideration that the said Dixon would pay him
the 60. l. the said Adams assumed to assign over unto him the said first
Obligation, in which the said I. S. was bound unto him, and upon which the
first action was brought, and the judgment thereupon had, and the Plaintiff
dixit in facto that he had paid the 60. l. to the Defendant, Sed ^radictus
defend, promissionem and assumptionem suas minime curans, has not assigned
over to the Plantiff the said Obligation and Judgment, per quod act. accrevit,
and Judgment was given for the Plaintiff, for the consideration was holden
good.

86.
ROsse brought an Ejectione firm against Thomas Ardwick, Limitation.
and the case was such, that one Norwood was seized in see, and leased to one
Nicholas Ardwick and his Assigns for his own life, and for the lives of
Thomas, Andrew, and John Ardwick, and after Norwood the Lessor leased the
Reversion to Rosse the now Plaintiff for 21 years, and after Nicholas Ardwick
made a lease of the same land to Thomas Ardwick to hold at will, and dyed; and
if the estate of Tho. was determined by the death of Nich. was the question.

Johnson There are two points in the case; the first, if by this word Assignee
an Occupant shall have the land, and I think he shall not: And the second point
is when a lease is made to one, and his Assignees, for his own life, and the
lives of two others, if now his own life confound the other two lives, for that
that it is greater to the Lessee than the other two lives, and he said the
Lessee has no estate but for his own life, and when he dyed the state is
determined; and to prove that he cited the opinion of Knightley in 28 Hen. 8.
10. Where he says if a lease be made to one pur auter vie, without impeachment
of Wast, the remainder to him for his own life, that now he is punishable of
Wast, for that, that when the remainder is limited unto him for his own life,
Wast against the surviving Joyntenant.
this drowneth the estate pur auter vie, which was in him before. And by 3 Edw.
3. If a lease be made to two for their lives without impeachment of Wast, and
one of them purchase the Fee simple, and dye, now his heir shall have Wast
against the Survivor. And I have heard that this was the case of the Lord
Aburgaveney for a house in Warwick lane.


Cook e contra And the case is no more but that a lease is made to one and his
Assigns for his own life, Remainder for years to the tenant for life.
and for the lives of two others; and I think that all may stand together; for
a man may have an estate for his own life, the remainder for years, and both
may stand together in him simul and semel; for that, that albeit that the
Lessee may not have that during his own life, yet he may dispose of that, and
by that means shall have the benefit, and so in this case, and also an estate
pur auter vie shall be in esse in the Lessee for the benefit of the Occupant,
and the inconveniences shall be exceeding many in this case, if the estate
does not endure for all their life's, for the Statute of 32 H. 8. inableth
Tenant in tail to make leases for 3 lives or 21 years, and usually Tenants in
tail make such leases as these be, and for that the generality of the case
ought greatly to be regarded; and there was a case adjudged in the Common place
between Chambers and Gostock, Chambers against Gostock.
where a lease was made to two for their lives, and the life of a stranger, and
one of the Lessees dyed, and the Survivor granted the land for his life, and
the life of the stranger, Burdels case.
and it was no forfeiture; and also it was Burdels case in the Commonplace,
32 Eliz. where a lease was to him for his own life, and the lives of two
others, and a good lease for all their lives: Occupant.
And for the point of the Occupant there is no question but that the state of
him that first enters is better than the state of him that enters under the
state of the Lessor.


Gaudy. The cases put by Mr. Johnson are not like to the case in question, The
greater estate preceding the less, both may stand.
and I will agree them; for here the greater estate precedeth the lesser; I
hold that a lease made to one for his life, the remainder to him for another
life, is good, for he may it grant over; and so I think in this case, that so
long as any of the lives remain living, that the estate remains.


Fenner I am of the same opinion, for I think that the state pur auter vies is
in the party to dispose at his pleasure; so Judgment was given for the
Defendant.

HArding brought an Action of Trover of goods against Sh^rman, Visne.
and declared of a Trover at D. in the County of Hunt. The Defendant pleaded
that he bought the goods of one I. S. at Roiston, in the County of Hertford in
open Market, and demanded Judgment; The Plaintiff replied that the Defendant
bought the same goods of the said I. S. at D. aforesaid in the County of
Huntington by fraud and Covin, And after bought them again at Roiston, as the
Defendant supposes; the Defendant rejoines, that he bought the same goods bona
fide at Roiston, Absque hoc that he bought them by fraud, apud D. in Com. Hunt.
Glanvile pleaded in arrest of Judgment, that the Visne ought to be of both
Counties. Gaudy seems to agree, but for that that Clinch and Fenner held
strongly that the Visne was well awarded in one of the Counties, therefore
Gaudy gave Judgment for the Plaintiff, for by this special Traverse the buying
at Roiston shall not come in question

88.
PAyton being High-Sherif, Keep harmless.
brought Debt upon an Obligation against his under-Sherif; and the Condition
was to perform all Covenants in a pair of Indentures contained, and one
Covenant was, that the under-sherif shall keep all the Prisoners committed to
him, until they be delivered by the Law, and also to save Mr. Payton harmless
of all escapes made by the said Prisoners. And the Defendant pleaded
performance of all Covenants.

Godfry The Plea is not good, for one part is in the Affirmative, and the other
in the Negative. By which the Defendant ought to plead, that the Plaintiff non
fuit damnifieatus, and so was the opinion of the Court; by which day was given
to the De^endant to amend his plea.


89.
A Man brought an Action of Trespass, for entering into an house, and breaking
of his close in Dale; Variance between the declaration and the new assignment,
or the title of the Plaintiff.
The Defendant said, that the said house and close in which the Trespass is
supposed to be done, conteins twenty Acres, and is, and at the time of the
Trespass supposed, was his Freehold. And the Plaintiff replied, quod locus and
clausa in quo supponitur transgressio, est anum messuagium, and makes him a
Title to it. To which the Defendant pleaded non Cul. And it was found for the
Plaintiff, and for that that the Plaintiff by his Replication made to him Title
but to a message, and does not maintain his Declaration which was for the
message and the close; therefore it was awarded quod querens nihil capiat per
Billam, sed quare, if this do not amount to a discontinuance of the close
only, and so helped by the Verdict.

90.
THomas Allen brought a Writ of Debt against William Abraham, upon an
Obligation bearing date in October. Counterbond for an Obligation already
forfeited.
The Condition, was, that whereas the said Thomas Allen, at the request of the
above bounden William Abraham, stands bound together with the said William
unto one J. S. in an Obligation for the true payment of 11. l. the 15. day of
May (the which May was before the date of the said Obligation whereof the
Action is brought) if the said W. A. do save and keep harmless the said T. A.
of and from the said Obligation, that then, etc. The Defendant pleaded payment
secundum formam and effectum condition is praedictae, and upon this Plea the
Plaintiff demurred in Law, and Judgment given for the Plaintiff, for the
Defendant ought to plead non damnificatus.

91.
HUntley brought a Writ of Account against Griffith, Account. Baron and Feme
and the case was, that one devised a certain sum of money to a Feme covert,
And the Husband and Wife made a Letter of Attorney to the Defendant to receive
the same money of the Executor, who did receive it accordingly to the use of
the woman, And the Husband and Wife both dye, and the Administrator of the
Woman's Husband brings this Action. Tanfeild argued that the Action is not
maintainable, for when the Legacy was devised to the woman, the Husband and
Wife ought to join in the Action, and if the Wife dye, the Husband has no
remedy. And when the Husband and the Wife make a Letter of Attorney to receive
the money, this principally is to be said the act of the woman, and the Husband
joyneth with her but for conformity, and for that it appears in 19 Eliz. 354.
if Baron and Feme levy a Fine of the Wives land, and the Wife only declares
the use of the Fine, it is good; and by 16 Ed. 4. 8. If a man be a Receiver to
a woman sole, which afterward takes a Husband, and he and his Wife assign
Auditors to the Receiver, they both shall join in an Action of Debt for the
Arrerages. Altam e contra, and said that the concourse of all our Books are,
that when money is delivered to deliver over to another, Letter of Attorney by
the Husband only. Debt due to a Feme sole.
that other shall have an Action of Account, allbeit that before that time he
had not any property; And 6 Ed. ^. 1. that proves.

Gaudy It seems to me the Action is well brought, for the matter whereupon you
stand is the Letter of Attorney, and I say if the Husband sole had made the
Letter of Attorney, For by the entermartage the duty became the husbands, if he
could attain it in the life of the wife, which he did by the receipt of his
Bailey.
it had been well enough; and when the money is received to the use of the
Husband and the Wife, now by that the Husband has interest.


Popham I am of the same opinion; for if Debt be due to a woman sole upon an
Obligation, and after she take an Husband, and the Husband sole makes a Letter
of Attorney to J. S. to receive that, and J. S. receives the same, now the
Husband sole shall have an account against J. S. Fenner accord. so Judgment
was given for the Plaintiff.


92.
THe Lady Gresham brought a Scire facias upon a Recognisance against William
Man as terr. Verdict in a Scire fac. upon Recognisance.
Tenant. The Defendant pleaded in abatement of the Writ, that one Bedingfield
was seized in Fee of three Acres of land not named, Judgment, si execut. etc.
And the issue was if the aforesaid three Acres of land were the land of the
aforesaid Bedingfeild or not, and the Jury found that B. and J. S. were
Jointenants of the said three Acres, and whether this Verdict has found for
the Plaintiff or Defendant was the question. Whether Joyntenancy shall be said a
Seisin.


Gaudy I think it may never be said the Land of Bedngfield only. And to prove
that he vouched 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 32. in debt for Rent, the Plaintiff declared of
a demise of 26 Acres rendering the said Rent; The Defendant pleaded that the
Plaintiff demised to him 26 Acres, and 4 Acres more, without that that he
demised the twenty Acres only, And the Jury found that he Leased but 22 Acres,
and there that was good, for the Defendant has confessed a demise of 26 Acres,
and then the Verdict should have been, that the 4 Acres ultra were not demised;
and also he said, when two men made a Feoffment, the Feoffee shall be in by
both, the which is a strong proof, that the one sole is not seized.


Fenner According to the matter in question, I think it is found for the
Plaintiff, for the pretense of the Defendant is, to have a companion, against
whom the Scire facias shall be as well brought as against himself. And in 46.
Edw. 3. That in casu proviso, if issue be taken upon an Alienation in Fee,
Forfeiture by alienation.
and the Jury find an Alienation pro Termino vitae, this is a Verdict good
enough, and the Plaintiff shall recover, for the Alienation to the Defendants
Inheritance is the question. And whether it be in Fee or for life, it is but
form, and so in this case.


Popham by pleading of the truth the Defendant might have been helped, but not
as he has pleaded here; as if one plead his Freehold, and another say his
Freehold absque hoc that it is the Freehold of the Plaintiff, and upon that,
they are at issue, And the Verdict finds that the Plaintiff and Defendant are
Tenants in Common, Now this Verdict is found for the Plaintiff; for he that
makes the first lie shall be triced, and this was the Defendant.


Fenner In this case, one Tenant may not have an Action against an other,
Iointenants make a statute.
and it was agreed in this case, if there are two Jointenants, and the one make
a Statute, and after joines with his companion in a Feoffment of that Land, now
the moity of the Land may be extended upon this Statute.


Godfry When it appears unto the Court, that there is another against whom the
extent shall be, then the Plaintiff his Writ shall abate.


Gaudy No truly, for by 44 Edw. 3. if a Writ of Dower be brought against the
issue in tail which is remited, and the Defendant plead ne unques seisi que
Dower, and the Verdict find the remitter, yet the Plaintiff shall have the
Judgment, for the Tenant if he will have advantage of that ought to plead it.


93.
THe Parson of Ramesey ^ued in the spiritual Court for Tithes of Asp,
Prohibition for Asp.
and a Prohibition was awarded. And Fenner said that it was adjudged before
that time that Asp should not pay Tithes, and also it was agreed if a man cut
trees for Housboot, No Tithes for housboots etc. or other usual boots.
Hedgboot, Ploughboot, Cartboot, and Fireboot, Tithes shall not be paid of them.

94.
NOta per Fenner Justice, Account.
that an Action of account shall be maintainable against a servant, but not
against an Apprentice.

95.
HOme was indicted for that he had spoken against the book of Common prayer.
Depravation upon endictment.


Yelverton The Indictment as it appears is taken before the Lord Anderson and
Baron Gent, Justices of the Gaol delivery, and has not showed that they are
Justices of Oyer and Terminer, nec de Assize, as the Statute appoints, and
for that it is void, Also the Indictment is quod recusavit uti communi
precatione et Administrare sacramenta, and does not say appointed by the book
of common prayer, also the Defendant was twice indicted, and upon the second
Indictment the Judgment was given before the said Justices, that he should be
deprived of his Benefice, and this is a Spiritual act, the which the Temporal
Judges have not to deal withal.


Fenner I doubt whether they may give Judgment of deprivation, albeit the
Statute say that the Offender shall be deprived ipso facto, no more than the
Statute of 5. Ed. 6. which says thatfor the striking in the Church the
Offender shall be excommunicated ipso facto. Also it does not appear whether
the Defendant be Curate of the parish where he refused to say divine service or
not, and if he be not, then his refusal is not punishable by the Statute.


96.
COok Attorney general demanded this question of the Court, Disseism.
if there be Disseisor and Disseisee, and during the Disseism, the Disseisee
when he has nothing but a right, levies a Fine to a stranger* If by this Fine
the right of the Disseisee be gone, and if the Disseisor shall take advantage
of that.

Popham and Gaudy Nay truly.


97.
RObins brought an ejectione firm against Prince, and upon the special
Verdict Mr. Frauncis Moor arguing for the Plaintiff did observe three points in
the case, Qualification and non residence.
The first was, when a Chaplin which is beneficed above the value of 8l. is
admitted and instituted into another benefice, 1 point.
and before induction gets a qualification, and after is inducted, If now the
benefice which he had first, be void, for that, that the qualification comes
between the Admission and the induction. The second point is, when the
dispensation is entered in the Chancery in a paper book, 2 point.
and not enrolled in parchment, If this be a sufficient enrollment, for that
that the usual manner of inrollments is in parchment. And the third point was,
when a Parson is inhibited by the Archbishop that he shall not intermeddle
with the Benefit, 3 point ad^^dged.
by means whereof the Parson is absent by the space of lxxx days, If such
absence shall make a lease made by the Parson void. And as to the last point
all the Judges agreed, that such absence does not make the lease void: For it
must be a voluntary absence, for such an absence the Statute does intend, and
this absence is by reason of an inhibition. And the case was argued for the
other side by Mr. Crook, but I could not hear him, and the next Term it was
argued again by Mr. Tanfield for the Plaintiff, and lie said that the principal
point of the case is whether the first benefice be void, insomuch that the
incumbent has gotten a qualification before induction into the second
benefice; And I think the first is void, for the intent of the Statute was that
the cure might be well served, and that poor people might be well relieved; And
as no man may serve two masters, so no man may serve two Cures, and before
induction the Church is full, Parson before induction.
and the Parson has Curam Animarum, and is rector Ecclesiae before induction;
and if a gift be made to such a Parson before induction, it is good; and so if
he alien by consent of the Patron and Ordinary it is good. Presentation excuted
before induction.
And if the grantee of the next Presentation present a Clerk that is admitted
and instituted, and dies before induction, yet the grant of the grantee is
executed, and he shall not present again. Colchils case death of the presentee
before induction. 2 point.
And so it was adjudged in Colsills case M. 10. and 17. Eliz. Rot. 4. And the
words of the Statute of 22. H. 8. cap. 13. are, that every Duchess, Marquess,
Countess, and Baroness, being Widows, may have two Chaplins, whereof every one
of them may purchase license or dispensation to receive have and keep two
benefices, with care of Souls, And before induction he recepit, habuit and
custodivit two benefices, and then he was not quallified, So the first was
void; and as to the point of the enrollment it is clear, there ought to be a
parchment roll, for that was the meaning of the law, and not to make an entry
in the paper book. Lawton contra, for all the body of the act of 22. H. 8.
extends to the possession of the benefice, and the Proviso ought to be
construed according to the body of the act, and before induction he does not
offend the law, and therefore the dispensation which comes before the induction
comes in good time, for if the Kings Tenant make a Feoffment, and Letter of
Attorney to make Livery and seizin, License of alienation.
this is no offense, for if he after purchase a License of Alienation, and then
Livery and seisin is made, this License is good.

Gaudy Before induction the first Benefice is not void. And you shall find 2
and 3 Mar. 130. that issue was taken upon the induction; but a Common person
may not change his presentment after admission and before induction, Plenarty
against a common person.
and Plenarty is a good plea against a Common person in such a case; But yet
before induction he is not a full Parson to all intents, for a grant of an
Annuity before induction is not good, Com. 526 for the induction makes it
notorious that he is Parson; then when he after his admission gets a
qualification, The Commencement of the fault.
it seems to me that the qualification shall not help him: for the Commencement
of the fault was before the qualification, and the Induction after relates to
the admission, and to prove that he cited 1 Mar. 99. where a man bought beasts
out of the Market, and gave 5. s. to have election to have the refusal in the
Market the next day, and in the Market he agreed to have the beasts, and paid
Toll, and holden clearly that this shall relate to the contract out of the
Market (so in this case) Also here the words are, shall take, receive, and
have (after qualification) two Benefices. And before the induction he takes the
benefices, in this case, for before the induction, Death or departure after
qualification and taking another benefice.
and at the time of admission, the Ordinary said to him, Accipe curam tuam and
meam. And if a Parson be once qualified, and after take a second Benefice, and
then his Master dies, yet his qualification remains, so is it if he depart
from the service of his Master. Then for the second point for the enrollment,
it seems it is good, for that it has been allwaies so used. For the Statute
which says, a man arraigned of Treason shall be tried by people of like
condition; yet if an Esquire be arraigned of Treason, he shall be tried by
people of meaner condition, as appears by 1 Mar. 99. for that it has been
allwaies put in ure, and therefore shall be intended that it was the meaning of
the Law.


Fenner Contra For before inductionthe Incumbent has no interest in the
Parsonage, and the Parishoners have no notice of him, and he may not serve the
Cure before Induction, and then if our Law do not repute him Parson, then the
Statute does not intend to make the first Benefice void, before that he is full
Parson in another Benefice. Also this word (have) in the Statute, is a word
Possessory, and ought to be full to all entents.


Popham I think the dispensation will not help, for by the Admission as to the
Cure of souls he is a full Parson, and also such a Parson is a sufficient
Parson as to the Patron, and to divest the interest into the Parson. No laps
for want of induction.
Also he is a full Parson as to a stranger, for if 7 years incurr between the
Admission and institution before Induction, no Laps shall acrew; No taking of
fruits before induction.
But as to the matter of the possession and fruits of the Benefice, he is not
Parson before Induction. And if the Law no not make the first Benefice void in
such a case, then one Parson may retain 20 Benefices together, for first he may
be admitted into one, and before Induction into that, admitted into another,
and sic in infinitum, the which was never the meaning of the makers of the Law,
and if before the Statute of 21 Hen. 8. a man had taken two Benefices, that had
not been good without a perinde valere in the spiritual Law, Hunting Chaplins.
and the meaning of the Law was, to help one that was a Chaplin to Noble men,
and not such which are hunting Chaplins which hunt after Benefices.

Then to the second matter, I think the enrollment is good, and but an offense
in the Clerk which is finable, and not in the party, for the party may not
procure the Clerk to make his entry in an another course than the custom is,
And therefore no fault in the party.

At another day in Mich. 39 and 40 Eliz. this case was moved again, and Cook
Attorney seemed that the dispensation which comes after Admission and
Institution, and before Induction, comes to late, and is not helped by the
Proviso of the Statute of 21 Hen. 8. for the words of the Statute are, shall
have, retein, and take a second Benefice. And after admission and institution
he may not take his Benefice, the which he had before, for he is Parson to make
a plenarty, and to many other purposes, before Induction. Gaudy seemed that the
admission and Institution made him full Incumbent, as to the Patron and to the
Parson himself, But as to the possession of the Church he is not full Parson
before Induction, for 5 Eliz. in an issue upon plenarty, it is there taken,
that the Church is plena and consulta per admissionem and institutionem before
Induction. And if any other construction shall be made in this case, the Letter
of the Law shall not be observed, viz. shall have, receive, and keep, for he
may not have a thing the which he had before. And it seems to me, that neither
by the intent nor by the Letter of the Statute it is helped.


Fenner e contra For 14 Eliz. fuit adjudged upon an issue, Prebend. or not
Prebend. that before Induction he was not Prebend. But the reason for which a
Quare impedit does not lie after the Admission and Institution after six
months, is for that, that against every Patron, the Presentation is only
excepted, Refusal before induction.
and before Induction the Parson if he will, may refuse a Benefice, for a
Parson which is absent, may be presented and admitted to a Benefice; A Parson
absent may be presented and admitted.
and if he may not refuse it, it is very mischievous to him. And the
Presentation is the Act of the Patron, and the Admission is the Act of the
Ordinary, But the Induction is the Act of the Parson himself, for by that he is
known to all his Parishoners, and his free consent by that is testified to
accept of the Benefice to which he was presented.


Gaudy If I grant to you prox. praesentationem, and the Incumbent die, and the
grantee present onewhich after admission and Institution dies before Induction,
whether is the grant executed or not, quasi diceret quod sit.


Fenner I have asked the opinion of the Judges of our house, and they are of my
opinion. But I agree with my Brother Gaudy for his last opinion, for after
admission and Institution, Plenarty against himself before induction.
the Church is full against himself before Induction. Gaudy Truly it is full
against all Common Persons.


Clinch The Induction is like to a livery of seision, and therefore before the
Induction, the Parson is as a Feoffee is after a Deed of Feoffment delivered
unto him, and before livery and seisin he is but Tenant at Will.


Popham I agree with my Brother Gaudy, for if the spiritual Law be well
understood, it will make an end of this matter and case. A sentence declaratory
upon a deprivatio^ ipso facto.
For by their Law, if a man take two Benefices, the one is void, ipso facto,
without deprivation; Yet there ought to be a sentence declaratory of the
deprivation, to give notice to our Law, and by the admission and institution,
the Incumbent is a Parson to many purposes, So it seems upon an execution.
but not to all profits, but as to the exercising of his Function he is Parson,
and has Curam animarum, and if by the admission and institution before
induction, He may exercise his Fanction before induction.
the presentee shall not be perfect Parson, great inconvenience will ensue, for
put that a man grant prox. praesentationem to one, and he present, and his
presentee is admitted and instituted, and then the presentee obtaines of the
Bishop a fequestration of the profits, and will never be inducted, in this ca^e
the grantor may lose his patronage. And if I bargain and sell my land, and
before enrollment of the deed I purchase a license of the Queen, this license
shall not avail, for he ought to have a pardon, and so in this case.


Gawdie I am not of the same opinion of my Lord chief Justice that if a man
that has a benefice take another benefice that that is void before deprivation
by the spiritual law: For under correction their law is otherwise; this case
is now reported by Cook, and adjudged that the dispensation came to late.


66.
HOO Executor of Hoo brought a Scire facias against Felix Marshall, Scire
facias sur recogn.
and the case was this, Hoo the Testator commenced a suit in the King's Bench
against one Fuller, And the said Felix Marshall became Bail for the said Fuller
in the said suit, Scilicet, That if the said Fuller should be condemned in that
Action, and did not either pay that condemnation, or yield his body to prison,
that then Felix Marshall should pay the condemnation for him, according to the
ordinary course of Bailes. But yet in pleading of this Recognisance he said
further Et si defecerit in solutione tuuc vult and concedit quod pradictum
debitum levetur de terris et tenementis suis. And Gaudy Justice said he did not
use any such words when he took Bail. And after this Bail taken, and before
Judgment given in the said suit, the said Hoo the Testator released to the
said Marshall all actions and demands, And after, Judgment was given for the
said Hoo the Testator, against Fuller, and thereupon the Testator brought a
Scire facias against M. as appears before, and M. pleaded the said release, and
hanging this Plea, Hoo the Testator dyed, and then the Executors brought
another Scire facias against the said M. And he pleaded this release again in
bar. Learning for releases.


Gaudy I doubt of the case, for 5 Eliz. 217. the Covenantee released all
actions, suits, quarrels, debts, executions, and trespasses, and this was
before any Covenant broken. And it is there holden that it is no bar to an
action of Covenant afterward brought upon a Covenant after broken, Annuity.
And per. 4. Ed. 4. 40. If a Grantee of an Annuity release all actions to the
Grantor before the day of payment, Read against Bullock.
this will discharge the arrearages before accrued, but not those payments
after. And by Read and Bullocks Case a release is not available to any other
right or action, than such as a man has at the time of the release, for it is
against the nature of a release to take effect in tempore futuro, and in the
case in question there was no action nor demand before judgment given against
Fuller. Difference where the first delivery is void and where not.
And I doubt of the case cited in 27 H. 6. 7. where an Obligation is delivered
as an escrowl, and the Obligee release to the Obligor all actions and after the
Obligation is delivered as the deed of the party, whether this release do that
discharge or not, it shall not by P. 5. H. 7. fo. 27. Infant.
So there are many other cases there put, as if an Infant deliver a deed as an
Escrowl to be delivered as his deed when he comes of full age, There I take the
Law clear, that if the condition be performed at full age of the Infant, yet
this is not his deed. And so of a Feme Covert which delivers a deed as an
Escrowl to be delivered upon Condition when she is sole, Feme ^ove^t.
if after the deed be delivered when the Woman is sole, yet this is not her
deed, for in these two last cases the first act which was the delivery as an
Escrowl was merely void. And if a man be indicted by conspiracy, and after
release to the conspirators all actions, and after that the party indicted is
arraigned upon this Indictment, and by Trial is acquitted, I doubt whether
this release shall bar him in an action of conspiracy, or not. Fenner said
that the Recognisance is immediately a Debt, and for that this release shall be
a Bar, for by Lytt. a release of all actions is no bar in a fieri fac. to have
execution within the year, but in a Scire fac after the year it is a good bar,
Release after delivery is an Escrowl.
and so in this case it is a bar, which was not a bar at the first. And I see
not any reason forwhich if the King release a Recognisance which is not yet
broken, it should not be a discharge of the Recognisance, Except it be for
that, that the general words in the Kings grant shall not extend to discharge
such a Recognisance without special words. And I think that a deed which is
delivered as an Escrowl is not a deed, but only after the delivery of that as
a deed, and shall not relate to be a deed ab initio. And for that, a release
made before the delivery as a deed, albeit that after that it is delivered as
an Escrowl shall not discharge it. Pas. 5. H. 7. 27.


Clinch I think that this release shall be a good bar, for if the Defendant at
the time when he entered bail had had his land, and had sold it before the
Judgment given against Fuller for whom he was b^il, none will deny but that
this land shall be liable, which proves that this is a Recognisance and a Debt
immediately.


Popham This is aprettie case, but there will be a difference between a duty
upon a contingent, and a duty absolute, for if I covenant to ^ufeoff you of the
manor of Dale before such a day, Duties absolute contingent, difference.
and bind my self by Obligation to perform the covenants, and before the day
you release to me all actions, there the Obligation is discharged, but not the
Covenant for the Obligation was an absolute duty, and the Covenant but
contingent; Obligation to perform covenants discharged, but not the covenant.
and it seems that a deed delivered as an Escrowl may not be discharged by
release made before that the Escrowl be delivered as a deed. And in the case at
bar there is no duty but upon a Contingent, that is to say if the party be
condemned and do not satisfy the Debt, nor render his body to prison. And for
that before that it become a duty, such a release will never be a discharge,
being but a possibility, for it has been adjudged, that where a lease has
been made to two for their lives, A possibility cannot be discharged or
surrendered.
the Remainder, which shall first happen to dye, for forty years, that neither
the one, nor the other nor both together may grant this term of 40. years
before it be settled, and if I release all demands before that the rent is due,
the rent is gone. But it is otherwise of a release of all actions.


Gawdie I agree that a release of all demands will discharge rent due. Release
of demands actions, difference.



Popham If I make a lease to I. S. for so many years as I. K. shall name, this
I. S. may not surrender his term before that I. K. name the years. And he
denied that the land of Marshall the manucaptor which he had at the time of the
Bayl should be bound being sold before the Judgment against Fuller, as Justice
Clinch did affirm in his argument.


Fenner There is a difference between an Action and an Interest. And after
Judgment was given that the release was no bar.


99.
MAckerell brought an Assumpsit against Bachelor, Necessary apparel.
and declared, that in consideration that the Plaintiff did deliver unto the
Defendant diverse Suits of Apparel, that is to say, a Satin Dublet and Hose,
with silver and gold lace; and one velvet Jerkin and Hose, and one fustian
Dublet and cloth Hose, to-his own proper use, the Defendant promised to pay to
the Plaintiff forty pound when he should be required. The Defendant pleaded,
that temp^re assumptionis, he was within age, and the Plaintiff replied, that at
the same time the said Defendant was servant and attending upon the Earl of
Essex in his chamber, and that this Apparel was delivered unto him for his
necessary apparel during the said time of his said service; and upon that the
Defendant demurred, and the Court caused the Declaration to be read openly in
Court to see of what degree the Defendant was of his Addition, and upon reading
of the Record it appeared by the Declaration, that the Defendant was there
written Gentleman, for which the Court agreed clearly, that Satin with gold
and silver lace, or Jerkin or Hose of Velvet, are not necessary Apparel for a
Gentleman; Severa prises good in a declar.
and so an Infant is not bound to pay for such Apparel; and therefore the
Action for so much will not lie; but for the residue, to wit, for the Dublet of
fustian, and Hose of cloth, it seems the Action is well maintainable, for the
prices of every of them is set down severally in the Declaration. Satisf. of
parcel


Popham The Plaintiff in his Declaration has confessed he is satisfied of part
of his contract, but non constat for what part of the clothes the money received
was paid, that is, whether for the necessary, or unnecessary.


Gaudy Truly it shall be intended for the necessary Apparel.

GOodale brought an Information against one Butler, Non-residence.
upon the Statute of 21 Hen. 8. cap. 13. for not being resident upon his
Benefice whereof he was Parson, by the space of six months, for which the
Defendant ought to forfeit for every months absence 10. l. And it was found by
special Verdict, that the Defendant had demissed his Parsonage-house to
another, excepting one chamber for himself, And within the same Parish had
hired another house, and there kept Hospitality, and was allwaies dwelling
there, And whether this be a Non-residence within the Statute, for that he does
not dwell within the Parsonage-house, but inhabiteth within the Parish in
another house, is the question. Clinch and Fenner were of opinion, that if he
be resident within his Parish, albeit he does not dwell within the
Parsonage-house, that yet this is a sufficient residence within the Statute;
for the Glebe land, and other profits within the Parish makes the Benefice,
Beneficium.
for a Benefice is derived of this word Beneficium, the which is a profit, or a
commodity, and if he be resident in any part of his Parish, he may well enough
execute all the Functions Spiritual, and Temporal, and keep Hospitality to
relieve his Parishioners; and these were the chiefest points that the makers of
the Statute intended to provide for. Proviso.
And Fenner said, the Proviso helps not; and that the words of the Statute
are, That every Spiritual person ought to be resident at, in, or upon his
Benefice, in the disjunctive; and if that be performed in any of those points,
then that suffices. Cont. per Popham 68.
But if the words were, that he shall be resident upon his Benefice, there
peradventure he ought to dwell in the Parsonage-house only.

Popham and Gaudy to the contrary; For Residence is a commorancy, and where he
has his Tithes, that is a profit; but yet it is no Benefice intended by the
Statute; for when the Statute says that he shall be resident upon his
Benefice, this shall be expounded upon the Parsonage-house; for the Statute may
not be so unreasonably construed, that only will compel the Parson to be
resident in any other place of the Parish, than where he has his house. And
for that Colthurst, and Be^ishins case in the Comment 20. Le Prior of Bath was
seized of a Grange or Farm, called Barton, near Bath, in Fee, and he and the
Covent leased that by Deed indented to H. B. and to his Wife for life, the
remainder to W. B. their Son, for his life, si ipse inhabitare vellet and
residens esse omnino de and super praedict. Grangium. And if it shall be
intended in this case that the Lessee may be resident upon any other place than
in the Grange-house, then by possibility the intent of the Lessor might be
defeated utterly, which was, that the Grange-house should be repaired. Also a
reason that moved the makers of the Statute to be of opinion to make the
Parsons resident, was, for that by this means the Parsonage-house should be
well kept in reparations, Reparations.
and should not be left to the successor in Delapidations. And the Proviso in
the end of the Statute will not help the matter; Proviso.
for the Proviso is, that it shall be lawful for any Spiritual person to take
to farm any Mansion House, having but an Orchard or Garden, in any City,
Borough, or Town; so that by that they have no liberty of Non-residence by
color of the said Proviso. Absence compulsary.
And Popham said, if a man be Non-resident by compulsion, that is not within
the Law: And if a Parson purchase a parcel of Land within his Parish, and
dwell upon that he purchased, and lease out his Parsonage-house, this is a
means to make the Parsonage-house to come to destruction, and ruin.

And the meaning of the Lawmakers was, Three things provided for by the
Statute.
to provide for three things. For Hospitality; for Divine service; and to
prevent Delapidations; and so in this case the Defendant is within the penalty
of the Statute. And to that my brother Fenner has said, That these words, in,
at, or upon, will make a difference, truly that is not so, for those words are
all of one substance in this case,


Et adj^rnatur.

NOta that in a Scire fac. between F^e and Balton of the County of Norfolk it
was holden by Popham and Gaudy, Fieri facias executed, but not returned.
and not denied by any, if a Fieri fac. go forth to a Sherif, and he levy the
Debt of the goods of the Defendant, but does not retorn his Writ, if the
Plaintiff after sue another Scire fac. against the Defendant, upon the
Judgment, he may plead this matter, and the Plaintiff shall be put to his
remedy against the Sherif; for the sale of the Defendants goods by the Sherif
is good, and not to be defeated; and so is a good Plea in bar of the other
Execution, otherwise the Defendant shall be put to a great mischief, vide 20
Hen. 6. 24. and 29. and 19 Edw. 3. Scire facias, and 44 E. 3. 18. Quaere if he
shall not have an audita querela, if the Plaintiff take out a new Scire facias
within the year.

102.
NOta per Mr. Cook Attorney general, Alienation by a Bishop.
that he said in an argument in the Exchequer, if a Bishop with consent of the
Dean and Chapter, alien land belonging to his Bishopric in fee, that a contra
formam collocationis does not lie, and so he said he could show the resolution
of all the Judges of England, the reason is, for that, that the Statute of
Westminster. 2 cap. 41. whereupon this is founded, speaks only of Abbots, Priors, or
Masters of Hospitalls, and albeit there are other words general, to wit or
Masters of other Religious or Ecclesiastical houses, yet that does not extend
to Bishops, which is an higher diginity than an Abbot, but the general words
after ought to be supplied with intention of other houses inferior to those
named before. So has it been ruled, that a Lease by a Bishop is out of the
Statute of 13 Eliz. cap. 10. which commenceth with Dean and Chapter, howbeit
there are general words after, to wit, or any other having any Spiritual or
Ecclesiastical living, which is intended of any other inferior to those named
before, and never was intended to extend to superiors, but as I think the
contrary has been since adjudged.

103.
Upon an Evidence in an Ejectione firm by Cootes against Atkinson for land in
the County of Derby, Whether a lease be bound by the Statute of 4 H. 7.
It appeared that a Lease for years was made of the said land, 20. H. 8. for
80. years, and after the Lessee was ousted and died intestate, And after in 4.
and 5. P. and Mar. a Fine was levied of the said land with Proclamations, and
the Conusee enjoyed it until 37. Eliz. in which year letters of Administration
of the goods of the Lessee was granted to I. S. which entered and made the
Lease to the Plaintiff. Godfrey moved that this Fine with non claim for five
years shall bind the right of the term by the Statute of 4. H. 7. which has a
saving of title and interests, So as they make their claim within five years,
A good distinction.
otherwise their title and interest is bound.

Cook and Tanfield A right of a term is not within the Statute of 4 H. 7. but
right of Freehold or inheritance, and so it was agreed in Stamfords case 21
Eliz. and sure has been diverse times holden.


Godfrey Stamfords case was a lease to commence at a day future, and then a
Fine and non claim for 5 years before the day of the commencement shall not
bind the right of that Lease, but a Fine levied after the day of commencement,
although before any entry of the Lessee, shall bind. Saffins case. Gaudy and
Fenner absent. caeter. Justic. held that a Lease for years shall never be bound
by the Statute of 4 H. 7. and therefore the Administrator may lawfully enter.
This was the Title of the Countess of Shrewsbury against Rowland Air for the
manor of Hassop in Com. praedict. But the Jury gave a special Verdict, and
Justice Fenner the next day said that he demanded this question of the Lord
Anderson.

And he is clear of opinion that the Statute of 4 H. 7. extends to bind a right
of a term if the Lessee were or might have been ever in possession before the
Fine.

POllard and his Wife brought an Action upon the case against Armshaw for these
words, Slander.
Thou art a whore, for I. S. Goldsmith has the use of thy body, the cart is
too good for thee.

Popham, et tota Curia The Action will not lie, for the Common Law cannot
define who is a Whore, but if one keep a victualling house or Inn, and one say
that she keeps a house of Bawdry, A Victualing house.
an action lies, and so was Ann Davies case, because it may be a means to make
honest guests to forbear the house, and so breed a temporal loss to the owner.

INter Palmer and Humphrey, Inquisition upon an elegit.
the case was such, upon an Elegit a Sherif impannelled an Inquest, which found
that one Henry Fry against whom the Elegit was taken out was possessed of a
Lease for 100. years to begin at the Feast of St. Micb. Anno 2 and 3. P. and
M. when in truth (as it was found by special verdict in this action) the Lease
was to begin at the Feast of St. Mich. Anno 3. and 4. Phi. and Ma. Cujus quidem
Henrici Fry Statum interesse and terminum in ten. prae. (and ne dit praedict.)
Juratores praedict. appreciaverunt to 80. l. and the Sheriff sold the Lease as
a chattell for lxxx. l. The question was, if the sale by the Sheriff be a good
sale.

Popham It seems to me the sale is good, for albeit the Lease is misrecited,
and He^ery Fry has not any such Lease, yet when the Jury comes to praise it,
and the Sherif to sell his estate in the land, they do not referr that to the
recital before, but generally that they shall sell all the state, interest,
and term of Henry Fry. But if this word (praedict.) had been in the inquisition
and sale it had been otherwise, as if the Sherif had said all which said estate
and term, then he had referred that to the recital before, which being false
will make the sale void, and for that he said that it was agreed in the time of
Sr. Christopher Wray about 21 years past, between Sr. G. Sydnam and Rolls upon
a Fieri facias, where the Inquest found, that the party against whom, etc. was
possessed of a certain term bearing date, etc. which did not ^ear such date,
and the Sherif sold the said term And it was ruled that the sale was not good;
But the Court did then advise the party to take a new Fieri fac. A good form of
finding a term by inquisition.
and that the Inquest should find generally that he was possessed of a term for
years yet enduring, and the Sherif upon that made sale accordingly, and that
sale was holden good, for that the Extendors and Sherif could not come to the
knowledge of the certainty of the term; so in the principal case, the sale
being of a term, and the state of the party in the Tenements, and not of the
term and estate aforesaid, which was falsely recited, this is a good sale, which
was in a manner agred by all the Justices; but adj^rnatur. At another day
Tanfeild moved this case again.


Popham I have considered of the Record with advise, and I think as this case
is, that the sale of a term by an Elegit is void; The difference between a
Fieri fac. and an Elegit.
and for that the difference between a Fieri fac. and an Elegit is to be
considered: For the Elegit is, that per Inquisitionem and sacramentum 12
bonorum hominum per rationabile precium and extent. the Sherif should apprise
the goods and chattels, and extend the land; so without inquiry the Sherif may
not sell, quod fuit concessum, as primo Mar. 100 is. Then if the Sherif inquire
of one term, and sell another, as our case is, the term sold was never found by
our Inquisition, and for that the sale not good, quod Fenner concessit, yet the
Lord Popham said, that if it had been found by the Inquistion generally, that
he is possessed of such land for term of diverse years, adhuc ventur. which they
have prised to such a sum, this had been good, insomuch as they have not any
means to come to the knowledge of the certainty of the term, But when by
Inquiry a Term in particular is found, Que estate, refers as well to the estate
as to the person.
they may not vary from that, and sell another; and he said that these words,
Cujus statum Henrici Fry shall be referred as well to the state precedent
found, as to the person of Fry. And so is the common intendment in pleading of
a que estate. And he said to Mr. Tanfield, that if he had taken any note of
their first opinions, that he should raze that out of his Book again; and after
the parties agreed in Court, that Hauger should give to Fry 200 Marks more for
his term, and then Fry should make assurance to him of the term, for
confirmation of the sale.

NOta per Cook Attorney General. Difference between Feoffmen^ to an use, and
covenant to raise an use.
If a man Covenant in consideration of natural love to his son, to stand
seized of certain Land to the use of himself for life, the Remainder to the
same son in Fee, with a Proviso, that it shall be lawful for himself to make
Leases for 21 years or three lives. Now he may not make such Leases,
notwithstanding this Proviso being by way of Covenant to raise the use. And so
it has been resolved.

Contra Peradventure if it were by way of Feoffment to uses. After Mr. Walter
said, that now lately in one Sharingtons case, it was adjudged in this Court
upon a Writ of Error, That if a man Covenant with his Eldest son in
consideration of natural love, A proviso with special limita^n good.
to stand seized to the use of himself for life, the remainder to his Eldest
Son in tail, with Proviso, that he himself might make Leases to his second son,
or to any other of his kindred for 21 years or 3 lives, and he made Leases to
him accordingly, this was holden good; for they to whom the Leases are made,
are within the consideration, to wit of the blood, and for that, the use may
well rise to maintain those Leases; But if the Proviso had been to make Leases
to any man, howbeit, that after he made Leases by force of that to his second
son, These Leases are void, for they are not within the consideration of the
Covenant by Intendment of Law at the first, for the Law at the beginning
adjudged the Proviso merely void, quod nota.


107.
RObinson brought Debt upon an Obligation against May, Counterbond.
the Condition was, that the Defendant should discharge or save harmless the
Plaintiff of an Obligation, for which the Plaintiff as surety with the now
Defendant was bound to I. S. The Defendant by way of bar pleaded, Usury.
that the Obligation made to I. S. by him, and the Plaintiff, was upon a corrupt
and usurious bargain, and pleaded the Statute of Usury, and concluded and sic
non da^^ificatus. It was moved at the bar, that this was no plea, for the
Condition is, that the Defendant shall discharge or save harmless, etc. And the
Plaintiff was impleaded by I. S. for that debt, and has paid the condemnation.

Tanfield Contra For if this shall not be allowed for a good plea, the Statute
of usury will be utterly defeated. For by a compact between the surety and the
Usurer, the surety shall pay the usurer, and the surety by that counterbond
shall have double recompense against the Principal, which will be mischievous.
But the whole Court held the plea not good. sed quare.


108.
HObbs sued an Audita querela in the Kings Bench against Tedcastle, Audita
querela, for a special bail.
and upon a demurer, the case was recited by Moor of the Temple, to be this,
Tedcastle sued a bill of debt in this Court, against one Hallaway, in Custodia
Marescali, which found bail, the said Hobbs, and an another, which entered bail
according to the common course of bail, And after Hallaway was condemned in the
said Action, and then the said Hallaway died without paying the condemnation,
or rendering his body to Prison, for which a scire facias was sued against the
bail, and upon two nihils returned, Execution, was awarded against them;
Whereupon they sued this Audita querela, supposing that the death of Hallaway
has discharged the bail. Moor argued for the Plaintiff, that the bail ought to
be discharged upon the matter, for Hallaway had Election to discharge the bail
by paying the condemnation, or rendering of his body to Prison; Now by the Act
of God it becomes impossible to perform the one, to wit, to yield his body to
prison, And therefore the Law will discharge him of the other, and by
consequence his bail. And that he proved by Arundells case, 9 Eliz. 262. and 6.
and 7 Eliz. 231. Sir Edw. Walgraves case.

Popham Quemodo constat here but that there was convenient time after the
Judgment, to perform the one or the other.


Kemp Secondary The course is allwaies here, after Judgment to award a Capias
against the Defendant, and if upon that he do not render himself, or pay the
condemnation, then to sue Execution against the bail, and not before; but here
there was never any Capias awarded against Hallaway the Defendant in his life
time.


Popham Gaudy and Fenner This seems very reasonable, not to sue Execution
against the bail, until a default be returned against the Principal, and the
recognisance of the bail, which is, that the Principal shall yield himself,
etc. is intended to be upon Process awarded against: him But no Process was
awarded against him in his life; and now it is impossible that he should yield
himself to Prison being dead, Judgment.
and therefore the bail is discharged.


And so they awarded Judgment for the Plaintiff in the Audita querela.

109.
MAtures brought an Action of Covenant against Westwood. And the case was such,
Covenant. for an assignee of a reversion for years.
Adams Lessee for 20 years, made a Lease for 10 years of the same Land to Bows
by indenture, whereby Bows did Covenant at the end of his Term of ten years,
to avoid and to leave peaceable possession to Adams, his Executors or Assigns;
Adams granted over his Reversion to Matures the now Plaintiff. The question is,
if the Plaintiff by the Statute of 32 Hen. 8. cap 34. as Assignee may maintain
an Action of Covenant for his Covenant broken, or not. Nota, that this case was
moved diverse times; And first it was moved, if a Grantee of a Reversion for
years be within the Statute or not.

Gaudy Well enough: For the words of the Statute extend to that (quod fuit
concessum)


Then it was moved that this was a mere collateral Covenant between the
persons, and not concerning the estate of the land, and for that not within the
Statute. Popham said, Covenant real which concerns the estate.
If nothing be said to the contrary, intretur Judicium for the Plaintiff;
afterward the case was moved again.

Gawdie It seems the case is, Assign, which in regard of his reversion, as of
a Covenant, may well maintain this action by the Statute of 32.


Fenner This Covenant is not any Covenant to be performed, during the estate or
term of the Defendant, but it is a Covenant to do a thing in the end of his
term, and for that is not a Covenant, of which the Assignee of the reversion
shall have benefit by the Statute, for that he has not any reversion depending
upon any estate, when the Covenant is alleged to be broken; for the Defendant
when he breaks that Covenant, is but Tenant at sufferance.


Gawdie contra, the Covenant is not to do a thing after the term determined,
but at the instant of the determination of the term, and therefore it is a
Covenant annexed to the State, and runs with the Land, and therefore the
Plaintiff shall have advantage over it.


110.
Trespass and assault was brought against one Sims by the Husband and the Wife
for beating of the woman. A Child born living but bruised.
Cook, the case is such, as appears by examination, A man beats a woman which
is great with child, and after the child is born living, but has signs, and
bruises in his body, received by the said battery, and after dyed thereof, I
say that this is murder. Fenner and Popham, absentibus cateris, clearly of the
same opinion, and the difference is where the child is born dead, and where it
is born living, for if it be dead born it is no murder, for non constat,
whether the child were living at the time of the battery or not, or if the
battery was the cause of the death, but when it is born living, and the wounds
appear in his body, and then he dye, the Batteror shall be arraigned of murder,
for now it may be proved whether these wounds were the cause of the death or
not, and for that if it be found, he shall be condemned.

111.
GOodale against Wyat in trepasse. The special verdict found that Sr John
Pagginton was seized of the land in question in Fee, Mortgage.
and morgaged it to one Woodliff upon condition, that if he or his Heirs did
pay to the Heirs, Executors, or Administrators of the said W. within one year
after the death of the said Woodliff 50 l. That then the said deed of
Feoffment, and the Seisin thereupon given, should be void, and afterward
Woodliff infeoffed Goodale of the same land, and gave notice of the said
Feoffment, to Sr J. P. and after Woodliff dyed, and Sir J. agreed with the heir
of W. to wit, one Drew Woodliff, to take 30 l. for the said 50 l. but when the
30 l. was to be paid, Sir J. paid to the said Drew VV. all the fifty pounds,
and after such payment made, Drew VV. gave back to the said Sr. J. 20 l. parcel
of the 50 l.

Altam 2. points are in the case. The first is to whom the payment of the
money, as this case is, ought to be made, and I think to the Feoffee, because
the Heir has nothing to do in the land, and to prove that he cited fundamenta
legum, 17. Ass. 2. 6. R. 2. Plesingtons case, and the case of one Ramsey 19.
Eliz. was such, a man infeoffed three, Ramseys case
upon condition, that if the Feoffor paid to them or their heirs 100 l. that
then he might re-enter, and after one of the Feoffees dyed, and the Feoffor
tendered the money to his Heir, and adjudged a void tender,: And also Littleton
proves that; but tif the condition might be performed, to the Heirby payment,
that ought to be precisely performed, for he is now as a stranger, having
nothing in the land, and the Covin between the Feoffor and the Heir, must not
hurt my Olient, for by 4. E. 2. c^i in vita 22. If cui in vita be brought
against a Prior, and hanging the action, he is deposed by Covin, this shall not
abate the Writ, and it was adjudged in this Court, where a man was bound by
Obligation to deliver a bond, and after he got a judgment upon it, and then
delivered the bond, and holden no performance of the condition, because the
intent was not performed; and 20. E. 3. account 29. in account the Defendant
pleaded a Deed, whereby the Plaintiff granted that if the Defendant made a
Recognisance to him, that then the Writ of account shall be made void, and he
showed how he made a Recognisance, But the Plaintiff said that after the making
and before deliverie of that to him, Composition by Executors.
the Defendant took it from the Clerk, and therefore was adjudged to account,
Precisely named.
and by 18. E. 4. 20. If a man be bound to license another to carry a 100.
Oaks, if he do license him, and then disturb him, the condition is broken, and
the common case of Executors will prove this, for, if an Executor have but 20
l. assets in his hands, and is in debt to two men, in 20. l. to either of them;
if he pay but 10 l. to the one, and have an acquittance of him, for the whole
debt of 20 l. yet the other 10. l. that remains in his hands shall be assets to
the other; for no compacting between strangers shall prejudice my right, per
quo etc. Payment upon a m^rgage good to the Executorrs cleelry



Gaudy I think clearly, if the payment had been entirely made to the Heir,
without collusion, it had been good, for that he is preisely named, for none
will deny but that if the payment had been made to the Executors, it had been
good, but the Covin between the Heir and the Feoffor peradventure will make no
payment; Father enfeoff the son.
and for that 34. E. 1. Warrantie 88. If the father infeoff the Son, to the
intent that this land shall not be assets to the Son, to bar him in a
Formdone, this Covin will not serve to aid him, Covin by administration.
and 2 and 3 Mar. the Husband dyed intestate, and administration was committed
to the wife, which took another husband, and the second husband and his wife
as Administrators brought an action of Debt, hanging which suit, the Son of
the intestate, by fraud and covin between him and a Debtor, obtained other
letters of Administration to him and the woman jointly, and after judgment,
the son by covin to defeat the execution released to the Debtor all demands
and executions, and after the Husband and Wife sued execution, and the Debtor
upon this release brought an audita querela, and adjudged against him, because
of covin; but there is a third matter, which makes an end of all, for it is
found that Sir John Pagginton entered upon Goodale, and Goodale re-entred, and
then the Defendant entering is a Trespassor to the Plaintiff, because no title
is found for him to make his entry lawful,


Finner I think no payment ought to be made to the heir in this case, no more
than it shall be where a man is bound by obligation to pay a lesser sum to the
Obligee, his Heirs or Executors; there payment shall be to the Executor, and
not to the Heir. And I think in this case, Conusee by Starute grants over his
estate.
that the payment ought to be to the Feoffee, for that that he is to have the
loss, for by 22. E. 3. and 15. E. 3. if a man have exeution by Statute, and
grant his estate over, if the Conusor will pay the money, and have the land
again, it shall be paid to the Grantee, and not to the Conusee. But I am clear
in opinion, that for another cause judgment ought to be given against the
Defendant, for the words of the condition are, sub condition, That if Sir John
Pagginton pay 50. l. to the Heirs, Executors, or Administrators of W. That the
said Deed of Feoffment, Liveri^ cannot be void without a reentire.
and the seizin upon that given, shall be void. And I think it is no condition
for livery of seisin may not be void without a re-entry, as 15. H. 7. is, but
for the matter of the Covin, it seems to me that if the Heir may receive the
money, that shall not prejudice; for if he have right to have the money, who
has any wrong, if he give part of that to another?


Clinch The payment of the money to the Heir is good; for when a man departs
with his estate, it is in his dispose to annexe what condition he will, and for
that when he appoints to the Heirs, Executors, or Administrators, payment to
any of them is good: And he said it was a good condition, Possession a good
title against all which have not a better.
and no fraud, for the duty was due to the Heir, but for the last matter that
is not to be cured; for when one title is found for the Defendant, and it is
found that the outed one that had elder possession, his entry is torcious.


Popham I think the condition is not good; for whenever you will have an
estate of inheritance to cease, Estates beginning by liverie, and otherwise.
you ought to have apt words to make it cease; for an estate which begins by
liverie, may not cease by words, but it is otherwise of an estate that
begins by contract without any liverie and seisin; but in the point of fraud
I am of opinion with my brother Gaudy: Fraudulent recoveries are void, although
they be by a good title.
For fraud in our law is not favored, albeit the party have right, for if he
that has right is of covin with one to disseise him that is in possession, to
the intent that he will recover against him, now this recoverie, albeit he has
right, will do no good to him, but the last makes all without question, and so
judgment was given for the Plaintiff.


112.
SAyer brought an Eejectione firm against Hardy, A Lease determinable made
good, for the insensibility of words.
and a special verdict was found, to wit, that a Lease was made to a widow for
40. years, sub hac tamen condition, quod si ipsa tam diu sola fuerit, and
inhabitabit in the same house, the woman continued sole all her life, and dwelt
all her time in the said house, and dyed within the term, the question was,
whether the term be determined or not, and whether the words make a condition
or limitation.

Morgan It is no condition, and cited Colthursts case, but if it were a
condition here is no breach alleged, for the death is the Act of God, which no
man may resist, and the Act of God may not prejudice any man.


Bromly I think the word makes a Limitation, and not a Condition, and he tited
the Lord Barkly's case.


Gawdie If a Lease be made to a feme sole, if she so long live sole, and
continue unmarried, now if she dye the Lease is determined, Differences between
conditions and limitations.
and per Litl. If an Abbot make a lease for 40. years, if he so long be Abbot,
if he after be deposed or dye, the lease is determined: So is it of a lease
made by the Husband, if he so long continue Husband of such a woman; but in
this case the words are insensible, and for that it is neither condition nor
Limitation, vide 3. E. 6. Dyer 65. and 66.


Popham and Clinch. It is neither Condition nor limitation, but if this word
(si) had been omitted, it would have been a condition; Or if the words (sub
conditio^^ quod) had been omitted, it would have been a limitation. And if I
make a Lease for 40. years, if the Lessee dwell upon the thing let, during the
term there if the Less dye, the Lease is determined, for that the point of
limitation goes to all the term, but if it be a lease for 40. years, if the
Lessee dwell upon that during his life, there if he dye, the Lease continues:
So they all concluded that the term yet continues, per quod judicium intretur
pro quer.

IN the case between Walter and Walter for 20. l. per annum to be paid to a
Justice of Wales for the Office of the Clerk of Fines: Assumpsit in
consideration of an Office sold.
For a Justice of Wales may by Prescription take notice of Fines of Land lying
in certain Shires in Wales, and this 20 l. per annum was to be paid by the
Servant to the Master for the said Office, for the Clerks Fee was v. s. iiij.
d. of every Fine. The Action for not paying the xx l. Mistr^all.
was brought, and tried in comitatu Gloucest. And therefore Mr. Attorney said
it was mis-tryed, for properly it ought to be tried in one of the three Shires
in Wales.

John Walter I think the Trial good; for 30 Eliz. there was a Case in this
Court between Beveridge and Conney, Reveridge against Conney.
And the case was, that a Lease was made in the County of Northampton, of lands
in the County of Cambridge, and the Lessee was bound by Obligation to pay his
rent in the County of Northhampton, The Defendant pleaded payment in the County
of Cambridge, and this was found in the County of Northampton.


Gaudy This is a good Case, let us see the Record.


Walter You shall Sir. But the Court seemed to incline against Walter. Cook
said that in this case the Assumption is void, per le Statute de 5 Ed. 6. cap.
16. For it is not lawful to sell such an Office.


114.
IN an Action of Debt upon an Escape, Escape.
Popham, Clinch, and Gaudy said, P. 36. Eliz.
if a Prisoner in Execution escape, and the Jailer make fresh suit, and before
the re-taking the party bring his Action against the Jailer, now the Jailer may
not re-take the Prisoner, as to be in execution for the Plaintiff again, but
only for his own indemnity; but if the party do not bring his Action, then
the Jailer may re-take his Prisoner, and he shall be in Execution again for the
Plaintiff. Wast.
For by Popham, this Case is like to Wast, the which if it be repaired before
the Action brought, the party shall not have an Action.

115.
A. B. was Utlawed after Judgment, Elegit after V^lary.
and an Elegit was awarded against the Defendant, Mr. Godfrey prayed a
Supersedeas, quia erronice emanavit, for the party may not have any other
manner of Execution but a Capias; for a Fieri fac. he may not have, for the
Queen is entitled to all his goods, and an Elegit he may not have, for by the
Utlawry, the Queen is entitled to all the profits of his Lands. Feoffment by
an outlaw.


Gaudy It appears by 21 Hen. 7. 7. a. That the party Outlawed may make a
Feoffment, and so out the King of the Profits; and so it seems in this Case.
But it is good to be advised.


116.
SR. Henry Jones Knight, Error in fine and remedy.
and I. his Wife, the Wife being then within age, levied a Fine of the lands of
the Wife, and a precipe. quod reddat was brought against the Conusee, which
vouched the Husband and the Wife, and they appeared in person, and vouched over
the common Vouchee, which appeared, and after made default, whereby a Recovery
was had, and now the said Wife and her second Husband brought a Writ of Error
to reverse the Fine, and another Writ of Error to reverse the Recovery, by
reason of the nonage of the woman, and the court was of opinion to reverse the
Fine, but they would advise upon the Recovery, for that the said Henry Jones
Knight, and his Wife, appeared in person and vouched over, and so the Recovery
was had against them by their appearance, and not by default, and so it seems
no Error, General warranty destroieth titles and conditions.
and to prove that Gaudy cited 1 and 2 Mar. Dyer 104 and 6 H. 8. 61. Saver
default 50. Also as this case is it seems that by general entry into
warranty, the Error upon the Fine is gone, as where a man has cause to have a
Writ of right, or title to enter for a Condition broken, or any other title to
land, and in a praecipe quod reddat of the same land is vouched, and enters
generally into warranty, by that the condition or other title is gone, but upon
examination it was found that the Recovery was before the Fine, for the
Recovery was Quindena Trin. and the Fine was tres Trin. And so the Recovery
does not give away the Error in the Fine.

117.
IN Evidence between Tutball and Smote the case was such, Condition
extinguished P. 36 Eliz.
that a Termor for years granted his Term to I. S. upon condition that if the
Grantee did not yearly pay x l. to Q. R. that the grant should be void and
after the Grantor died and made the Grantee his Executor, and whether the
Condition be extinguished or not was the question. Popham and Gaudy said the
Condition is extinguished, for it is impossible for the Executor to enter upon
himself. Clinch and Fenner e contra, The debtor marries the Executor.
for he has the Term jure proprio, and the Condition as Executor, and so he
has them as in several capacities.

Cook It has been adjudged where a man is indebted and marryeth with the
Excutor, and the Executor dies yet this is no devastavit, for the Husband has
been charged.


118.
RIchard Thorn, Administrator of an Administrator.
and Jane his Wife, as Administratrix of one I. Gime brought Debt of xx. l.
against I. S. And alleged that the Testator was Administrator of one Mary Gime,
which Mary Gime lent the money to the now Defendant, Trin. 36. Eliz.
and Judgment was given in the Common place against I. S. And upon the Writ of
Error, Error was assigned, for that that the now Plaintiff as Administrator of
an Administrator, brought this Action, where the Administration of the first
Testatators goods ought newly to have been committed by the Ordinary to the
next of Kin, and he to whom the Administration of the goods of the first
Administrator is committed, has nothing to do with them. And so the Judgment
was Reversed.

119.
HUmble brought Debt against Glover for arrearages of rent, Privity determined
of both parts.
and the case was this, that a man made a lease for term of years, and after
granted the Reversion to the Plaintiff, and after the Lessee for years assigned
over his whole estate and interest, and after this assignment rent was behind,
and the Grantee of the Reversion brought Debt against the first Lessee for rent
due after his estate assigned over, and whether Debt will lie against the
Lessee after the assignment, was the question, and the opinion of all the
Judges was that no Debt lies for the Grantee of the Reversion against the
first Lessee after the assignment of his term, for when the privily of the
estate is determined of both parts, no Debt lies, and so the Plaintiff was
barred.

120.
IN Evidence between Maidston and Hall, Maintenance.
Popham said, that it was agreed in the Star Chamber, if two are at issue in
any Action, It is not lawful for any stranger to labor the Jury to appear,
for, for such an Act one Gifford was fined in the Star Chamber. Giffords case.


Gaudy Truly the Law is so, for laboring of Juries is maintenance.


121.
DIck^ns brought an action of trespass against Marsh, Esta^e by Devise.
and a speciciall Verdict was found that R. D. being seized of certain lands in
Fee had issue three children, to wit John, Toby, and Mary, and by his Will
devised, that after his debts paid he gives all his goods lands and movables
unto his three children equally between them

Altam There are two matters to be considered in the case, the first is what
estate the children have by this devise, whether Fee simple, or but for life;
the second is whether Joyntenants, or Tenants in commn; and as to the first
point I think they have but an estate for life, for it appears 22 H. 6. 16. If
I devise land to one without expressing what estate he shall have, Dyer 23
Eliz. 371.
he is but Tenant for life, but if it be expressed in the devise, No estate
expressed.
that the Devisee shall pay 20. s. to John S. there, as the book is 24 H. 8. R.
125. the Devisee shall have Fee simple. For the second point he said they were
Joyntenants and not Tenants in common, Consideration.
but if the words of the Will had been, Part and part like.
that they shall have part and part alike, there they are Tenants in common,
and not Joyntenants.


Tanfield e contra For if they were Joyntenants for life, Reversion descends
to a Joyntenant.
and the reversion descend to one of them, that will never drown the estate for
life for the benefit of the Survivor. And if a man give land to two men for
their lives, the Remainder to the right heirs of one of them, yet they are
Joyntenants, and the Survivor shall hold place, and albeit the words are
equally between them, yet this shallbe intended equally during their estate,
and it has been taken for a difference, if I devise my land to two equally
divided between them, there they are immediately Tenants in common, and not
Joyntenants, but if the words had been equally to be divided between them,
there they are Joyntenants until division be made, for that that it is
referred to a future time.


Gaudy Justice I think they have but estates for life, for consideration of
blood is not so effectual as consideration of money; Blood, Money, Difference.
for if I bargain and sell my land for money, without expressing any estate,
the Bargainee has a Fee simple, but if in consideration of natural affection,
I covenant to stand seized to the use of my son, and do not express any estate,
there my son is but Tenant for life; and for the second point I think they are
Tenants in common, and not Joyntenants, for the case is no other, but as if he
had said I give my land to my children by moities amongst them, By moities.
and then there had been no question but that they had been Tenants in common.


Popham and Clinch For the first point no estate but for life passes, if any
estate pass, for it is doubtful if any estate pass or not, for the Will is,
that after his debts paid, Only Lands liable.
he gives all his lands, goods and movables, etc. And therefore Popham
thought that such Lands which were liable to Debts should pass, A Term.
and no other. For if the Devisor had had a Term, then it seems no Land
should pass: But admit the Land do pass, then if I devise Land to two, equally
divided between them, they are Tenants in Common; But if I devise Land to two,
equally to be divided between them, by I. S. now until Division, they are
Joyntenants; So I think where the Devise is equally to be divided between them,
that they are Joyntenants quousque Division, because of the reference future.


142.
John Cole made a Lease for years to one Taunton, Devise is a demise. Hill. 36
^liz. rot. 376.
upon Condition, that if the Lessee shall demise the Premises, or any part of
it, other than for a year, to any person or persons, then the Lessor and his
Heirs may re-enter, the Lessee after devised it by his Will to his son.

Popham Gaudy and Fenner It is a breach of the Condition, and the case of 31
Hen. 8. 45. rules the Law in this case, for a Devise is taken for a breach of
the Condition, v. 27 Hen. 8. 10. Quaere if he might not have suffered it to
come to his son as Executor.


123.
A Man seized of a Wood, granted to another a Hundred Cords of Wood to be taken
by Assignment of the Grantor, Grant before property vested.
and before Assignment the Grantee granted that over, and whether this Grant be
good or not, being before Election, was the question. And the better opinion
was, that it is not grantable over, for no property was Vested in him before
the Assignment; and if the Grantor die before Assignment, the Grant is void,
and his Executors if he die shall not have it.

124.
BRewster brought Error against Bewty upon a Judgment given in the Common
place in a Replevin, A Jur^rs name in the distringing mistaken.
and it was Assigned for Error, for that that Kidman was returned in the Venire
fac. and Bidman* was returned in the Distringas and habeas corpora. Tanfield
said, it was apparent Error, and to prove that he cited Parkers case, where in
an appeal Palus was returned in the Venire fac. and Faulus was in the Habeas
corpora, and Paulus was sworn, and therefore Error. And between Cobb and
Paston, a Juror was named Hantstrong in the Venire fac. and Hartstrong in the
Distr. and adjudged ill. Cook said, that it might not be amended. And to prove
that he cited 9 Edw. 4. 14. and 27 Hen. 65. where it is said, no Amendment
after Judgment; for thereby the Attaint of the party shall be tolled; and in a
case between Crosby and Wilbet, George Thompson was returned in the Venire fac.
and Gregory Thomson was in the Distr. and could not be amended after Judgment.

Gaudy It is hard to amend the Distr. for the Book of 27. Hen. 6. is, that it
shall not be amended, for the Distr. is the Awarding of the Court, and for that
he cited 14 Hen. 6. 39. where a Juror was returned by the name of Hodd, and in
the Habeas Corpora was named Lord, and when the default was espied, they
awarded a new Habeas Corpora. But in the Book of 22. Hen. 6. 12. the Sherifs
retorn was amended, but not the Writ. And 34 Hen. 6. 20. The Prior of St.
Bartholomews case, where in the Fenire fac. there were 24 returned, and in the
Habeas Corpora but 23. and so a Juror omited, and holden that it could not be
amended. But after the opinion of the Justices of England was, that it should
be amended, insomuch that it appears by examination the same party in the
Venire was sworn, and so no damages to any.


125.
PAnnell brought Trespass against Fenn, Devise to execute.
And the case was such, that a man was Possessed of a Term, and made M. his
Wife and G. Fenn his Executors, and devised all his Term to them, and that they
shall have the Term until all his Debts and Legacies were paid, and all such
charges in suit of Law as they should expend, the Remainder to John Fenn in
tail; the question was, whether the Executors take as Devisees or as Executors.
Gaudy said, if they take as Devisees, then if the one of them grant all the
Term, no more but the Moity passes, and then the Grantee and the other
Executors shall be Tenants in Common: But if they take as Executors, then when
one Grants the Term, all passes, as 29 Hen. 8. is, Clinch and Fenner said,
they shall take as Executors, for it is the proper function of an Executor to
entermedle with the Will.

Gaudy If I make two my Executors, Proper benefit.
and devise the profits of my Land to them until my Debts and Legacies be
paid, and until they have levied 100. l. after that to their own use, I say
they shall take that as Legatees, and not as Executors, in respect of the 100.
l. which they are to have to then proper use.


126.
NOta, Second deliverance.
if a man have Judgment to have Retorn upon a Nonfuit in a Replevin, and the
Plaintiff bring a second Deliverance, this is a Supersede as of the Retorn; yet
the Defendant in the first Replevin shall have a Writ to enquire of the
damages, which shall not beestaid by the second Deliverance, but if he have
Judgment in the second Deliverance, then shall be retorn Irreplevisable, and
shall recover damages.

127.
STitch against Wisdom, Thoughts are not to be uttered.
an Action upon the case was brought for words (viz) he did better than many an
honest man did: For there is many a truer and honester man hanged, and there
was a Robery committed, whereof I think him to be one, and I verily think him
to be an Horse-stealer, and upon non Cul. pleaded, It was found for the
Plaintiff, and pleaded in arrest of Judgment, for that it is not expressly
affirmed that the Plaintiff was one of the Robbers, neither that he was a
Horse-stealer precisely, but that he thought him to be one, and thought is free
for every man, and no slander; but this notwithstanding Judgment was given for
the Plaintiff, for thoughts tending to slander may not be uttered.

128.
NOta per Gaudy, Felony.
That a man may be accessory to the stealing of his own goods, As if he
confederate with an other to steal goods from his Bailey, to the intent to
charge his Baily, this is Felony.

129.
THynn brought Debt against Cholmley for 300. l. Arrerages of a nomine poenae,
Nomine poene against an Assignee.
And declared of a Lease for years made by him to one Ager rendering Rent, and
if default of payment be made of the said Rent at any day, Trin. 36. E. rot.
842.
in which it ought to be paid, Quod tunc and toties the said Ager his Executors
and Assigns, shall pay iij. s. iiij. d. pro quolibet die donec praedictus
reddit. so behind shall be satisfied, And showed how the Rent was behind and
not paid by the space of two years, but did not show that he demanded the Rent.

Jackson The sum demanded is by computation more than should be true: But it
seems that the Plaintiff intends to have every iij. s. iiij. d. doubled for
every day that the Rent is behind; And if that be his intent, then he demands
too little, Demand.
for in 2 years that will be infinite.


Gaudy He shall have but iij. s. iiij. d. for every day.


Fenner I think that he ought to make a demand of the Rent; Or otherwise he
shall not have the nomine poene.


Gaudy Nay truly, no more than in Debt upon an Obligation, and he cited 21 Hen.
6 21. Edw. 4. and 22. Edw. 4.


Fenner Not like, for in debt upon an Obligation it is a duty, but otherwise of
Rent; and it was agreed that it lies against the Assign in this case.


130.
HArbin against Barton. A Jointenants Lease to begin after his death.
The case was, that two Jointenants for life, the one made a Lease for 80
years, to begin after his death, and after died. And whether the Lease is good
against the Survivor or not, is the question. Gaudy said that the Lease was
good, and cited 2 Eliz. 187.

Popham and Fenner e contra After, this Lease was adjudged a good Lease by all
the Judges of England; for every Jointenant has interest during his life, and
the life of his companion. Ewdalls case.
For it was Ewdalls and Paramores case, 31. Eliz. Where a Lease was made to the
Father during his life, and the life of two of his Sons; The Father assigned
over, and adjudged to continue after the death of the Father. The like between
Gutter and Locrofts, and between Orwin and others


131.
Baddock against Ja. S. and declared in an Action upon the case for words,
Insufficient declar. for words.
quod in praesentia diversorum leigiorum dixit de praefat. quer. haec verba
Anglicana (viz.) Thy Father (praedictum quer. innuendo) is a thief; for he
stole my sheep. The Defendant justified the words, and at the Assis^s it was
found for the Plaintiff, and exception was taken in arrest of Judgment; For
that it is not showed in the Declaration, Substance, Form in a Declaration.
that the words were spoken to the son of the Plaintiff.

Gaudy I think it is good, for that the Defendant has Justified the words
spoken of the Plaintiff, tota Cur. e contra. But if the Declaration be uncertain
in form, yet the bar may make it good: But if the Declaration want substance,
as in this case it does, there the bar cannot make it good.


132.
RObert Sharples and Grace his Wife, Debt.
brought Debt upon an Obligation against N. Hankinson, the Obligation boar date
xiij. die Octobris, An. xxxj. Eliz. The Condition was, if N. H. did pay viij.
l. of lawful money, etc. in the year of our Lord God 1599. At or upon the 13th
day of October, which shall next ensue the date hereof. The Defendant pleaded
that the day of payment was not come.

Gaudy I think the day of payment is the 13th day of October, next after the
date of the Obligation, And that these words in the year of our Lord God 1599.
are merely ^oid.


Fenner Justice I think that the payment shall be in the year of our Lord 1599.
For when a certainty appears, allbeit afterward an incertainty come, yet that
shall not hurt the certainty, but the first certainty shall stand, and the
incertainty shall be void, And in this case the An. Do. 1599. is sufficicient
certainty, and therefore the subsequent words are void.


Popham I think that the payment shall be the 13 day of October prox. post An.
Dom. 1599. For the words are, that the Obliger shall pay viij. l. of lawful
money of England in the year of our Lord God 1599. And if the payment shall be
before this time, none may know but by the spirit of Prophecy, what money
shall be current in England that year before the year come, and it is
impossible to pay that before; and if I am bound to enfeoff before Easter,
Impossible condition void.
him that comes first to Paul's upon Michaelmas day next, this is void, because
it is impossible.


133.
BOyer brings a Writ of Error against Jenkings, Test of the Venire mistaken.
and the Error assigned was, for that the suit was commenced 35 Eliz. And the
Venire fac. to try this issue bore, Test 33 Eliz.

Gawdie a Venire fac. which bears Test 33 Eliz. cannot possible be to try an
issue in 35 Eliz. which is two years after, and therefore here is no venire
fac. and so helped by the Statute of 18 Eliz. after Verdict.


Tunfield This very case was Yorks case, adjudged in this Court that it was not
helped by the Statute.


134.
NOta per Cook Attorney General, Distinct grants.
that the Lord Keep (...) that is, was of Counsel in a case inter Harlakenden,
and A. where it was adjudged, that if a man make a Less for years of Land,
excepting the Wood, and after the Leasor grants the Trees to the Lessee, and
the Lessee assigned over the Land to another, not making any mention of the
Trees, now the Trees shall not pass to the Assignee, as annexed to the Land,
for the trees and Land are not conjoined, for the Lessee had several interests
in them by several Grants.

135.
THomas against King, Ejectment.
and the Title of the Land was between Sir Hugh Portman and Morgan, And the
Ejectment was supposed to be of 100. Acres of Land in Dale and Sale, and the
Jury found the Defendant guilty of 10 Acres, but did not show in what Town they
lay, whereupon Haris Sergeant moved in arrest of Judgment, for that it does
not appear where the Sherif may put the Plaintiff in Possession. Et non
allocatur, for the party at his peril ought to show unto the Plaintiff the
right land, for which Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

136.
O Land against Bardwick, and the case was this, that a woman being possessed
of Coppihold land for her Widows estate sowed the land, Forfeiture of a
particular tenant.
and after took the Plaintiff to Husband, and the Defendant being Lord of the
Manor entered and took the Corn, and the Husband brought an action of Trespass.

Clinch I think, the Woman shall not have the corn, Lease by Tenant for life.
but if the Wife had Leased the Land, and the Lessee had sown it, and after the
Wife had married, and the Lord had entered, yet the Lessee shall have the Corn.
But in the case at bar, the Woman her self is the cause of the Determination of
her estate, for she commits the Act, and therefore shall not have the Corn,
no more, Forfeiture.
than if Lessee for life sow the Land, and after commit forfeiture, and the
Lessor enter, in this case the Lessor shall have the Corn.


Fenner At the first the State of the Woman was certain, viz. for her life, but
yet determinable by Limitation if she mary. And if a man which has an Estate
determinable by Limitation sow the ground, and before severance the Limitation
ends the state, yet the party shall have the Corn which he has sown. And in
the case at the bar, there is no Forfeiture committed which gives course of
Entry, nor no dishinheritance or wrong made to the Lord, as in the case where
Tenant for life after his sowing commits forfeiture; and if a man enter for
breach of a Condition, Entry for condition broken.
he shall have the Corn, and not he that sowed the same, for that his entry
over-reacheth the state of the other; but in this case the entry of the Lord
does not over^ach the Title of the Woman; for he shall take that from the time
that the Limitation ends the Estate, and not by any relation before, For the
Act of the Woman is Lawful, and therefore no reason he shall lose the Corn*


Popham Chief Justice It is clear, Forfeiture.
if Tenant for life sow and after commit a Forfeiture. And the Lessor enter, he
shall have the Corn; (...) the like is it if the Lessee after the sowing
surrender his Term the Lessor, Surrender.
or he to whom the Surrender was made, shall have the corn; but if Tenant for
life make a lease for years, Lease by Tenant for life.
and after commit a Forfeiture, and the Lessor enter, now the Lessee shall have
the Corn; and in the case at bar, if the woman had Leased for years, and the
Lessee had sowed the land, and after she had taken Husband, now the Lessee and
not the Lord shall have the corn, for the act of the Woman shall not prejudice
a third person, but when she her self is the party, Knowledge.
and has knowledge at the time of the sowing what acts will determine^er
estate, then is it reason if she by her own act will determine her estate, that
she shall lose the Corn: For if Lessee for life sow the land, Lessee prays in
aid.
and after pray in aid of a Stranger, now if the Lessor enter he shall have the
Corn, And so if Tenant at Will sow the Land, Tenant at will determines his own
Will.
and after determine his own Will, the Lessor shall have the Corn, but
otherwise it is if the state be determined by the act of law, or of a third
person, so that no folly was in him that sowed.


Fenner If the Husband and Wife were Lessees during the coverture,
Determination by the act of the Law of a third person.
and after the Husband sowes the land, and then the Husband and Wife are
divorced, yet the Husband shall have the Corn, for that the Husband at the time
of the sowing had no knowledge of the Act which determined his interest.
Divorce.
So in this case the Woman at the time of the sowing did not know of the future
Act which determined her interest, and therefore no rason she should lose the
Corn, for the Corn is a Chattell in her; Grant.
for if she had either granted them, or been outlawed after the sowing, and
then had taken a Husband, Now the Queen in the case of the outlary, or the
Grantee in the other case, and not the Lessor, Outlary.
shall have the Corn.


Popham I will agree the case of the divorce to be good Law: For that is not
merely the Act of the party, but also of the Court; but in the case at bar,
the taking of the Husband is the Voluntary Act of the Woman per que.


And after Judgment was given against the Husband, which was the Plaintiff.

137.
A Scough brought a Writ of Error against Hollingworth upon a Judgment given
in the Common place in a Writ of Debt brought upon a Statute Merchant, Statute
Merchant.
And the case was that Ascough came before the Mayor of Lincoln, and put his
seal to the same Statute, and the Kings seal was also put thereunto, but one
part did not remain with the Mayor, according to the Statute of Acton Burnell,
And it was adjudged a good Obligation against the Party, albeit it is no
Statute.

Godfrey I think the Judgment ought to be affirmed, and he cited 20. E. 3.
account 79. And it is clear that a thing may be void to one intent, and good to
another, by 10. Eliz. but Popham and Fenner were of opinion, that it was hard
to make it an Obligation, for in every contract, the intent of the parties is
to be respected. Intent in every contract.
And here the intent of the parties war, to make it a Statute, for the Kings
seal is put to it, and a Statute needs no deliverie, butan Obligation ought to
be delivered, otherwise it is not good, Delivery.
and being void as a Statute, it is void in all;


And after Judgment was given, That the first Judgment shall be eversed if
other matter be not showed.

128.
BOdyam against Smith in Trespass for the taking of an Ox in Dale. The Defendant
justified the taking in Blacka^re, Heriot servise may be seized.
and that it was his Freehold, for damage feasant. The Plaintiff made a new
assignment, That the place whereof he has complained the taking to be is
Green-acre in Dale, and the Defendant justified there for Herriot service.
Seasure makes a seisin


Gaudy I think the Lord may seize Heriot service, and when the Lord has seized
that is a seisin by the hands of his Tenant, Plowd. fo. 45. And for the last
point, there is not any color or question, for when in trespass the Defendant
pleads a plea in bar, New assignment.
and then the Plaintiff makes a new Assignment, reason will that now the
Defendant shall have answer to this new assigned wrong for per 27. H. 8. 7.
after a new assignment, the old bar is waved, and out of the book, and the
Defendant shall plead to the new assignment, as if he had never pleaded before.


Popham, Fenner and Clinch concordaverunt cum Gaudy.

139.
BAstard a good name of purchase, Bastard.
for it is a sufficient denomination who shall take, per Popham and Fenner.

Gaudy Justice said a man cannot be perjured by an innuend. Popham said,
Perjury.
that no man is to be touched for a perjurie upon the Statute of 5. Eliz if he
be not deposed upon some matter depending in suit, in some Court of Record, and
if he be perjured in circumstance, and not in the point in question, that is
not material, and is not punishable by the Statute of 5. As if a man do
swear, that he saw such a man steal, and deliver such a deed, and when he did
it, he was in blew coat, where indeed he was not in a blew coato.

POpham Chief Justice said, there will be a difference between disjunctive

to enfeoff one upon the return of I. S. from Rome; there if I. S. dye before
he return from Rome, then the obligation is saved, although the ten pound be
never paid: but if it be a voluntary Act, as to pay you ten pound, or to
enfeoff you before Michaelmas, there if the Obligor dye before Mic. yet hit
