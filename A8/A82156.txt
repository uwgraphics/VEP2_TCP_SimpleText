THE DECLARATION Of the Gentlemen, Freeholders and Inhabitants Of the County
of BEDFORD.
WE the Gentlemen, Freeholders, and Inhabitants of the County of BEDFORD,
being truly sensible of the heavy pressures that we lie under, having all our
Civil and Religious Rights and Liberties daily Invaded, cannot in this common
day of Calamity, be silent, but, with the rest of the Nation, make some enquiry
after the way of Peace and settlement: And having met, and considered thereof,
do humbly propose, as the most probable means, under God, to compose all our
Differences, and cement all our Breaches both in Church and State, the
assembling of a Full and Free PARLIAMENT, without any previous Oaths, or
Engagements, or Qualifications whatsoever, (saving what was in the year 1648.
before the Force put upon the Parliament.) Or, the re-admitting of the Secluded
Members to the Execution of their Trusts, with a full and free Supply of their
Vacancies by Death. And until one of these be done, we do declare, We shall
not hold our selves engaged to pay the Taxes imposed upon us, without our
Consents so first had in Parliament.

Printed at LONDON, 1659.
