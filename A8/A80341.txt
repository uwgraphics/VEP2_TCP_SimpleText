special notice of.

London Printed for Henry Overton, 1643.

A CONFUTATION OF The Earl of Newcastles Reasons, for taking under his Command
and Conduct diverse Popish Recusants in the Northern Parts.
THere is a Declaration lately printed under the name of the Earl of
Newcastle, an Earl and Baron of England, and by birth and descent an English
man, of the Family of Cavendish, now General of an Army in the Northern parts
of the Kingdom; Consisting most part of Papists, raised, as is conceived, to
suppress the Liberty of England, contrary to the Fundamental Laws of the
Land; and to establish that long excogitated Arbitrary Government, which evil
Counselors (aspiring by flattery to become great) have diverse years since
projected; Wherein the Author of the Declaration first desires the Subjects of
the County of York, to take into their serious consideration several
particulars, and expects credit to be given to them; these I pass over at this
present, in hope the good Subjects of that County will in due time make it
appear how little credit is to be given to the Author of that Declaration, who
would justify actions so contrary to the professions of the Earl of Newcastle
made to God, to the Church, and to his Country. Secondly, He desires to give
satisfaction both to the Subjects of Yorkshire, and all other true Protestants
of this Kingdom, why he has been necessitated to take under his Command and
Conduct diverse Popish Recusants in the Northern Parts, alleging, First, It
was not His Majesty's intention, nor the intention (for any thing his Lordship
knows) of any in Authority under him, to admit any of them (that is to say,
Popish Recusants) into that service, if the way had not been chalked out to His
Majesty, and His Ministers, by the very men, in whose Forge the Objection was
raised. Let (says the Earl) the Muster Rolls of that Army which is named from
the Parliament be perused, and then it shall appear plainly that the
mannagers of that Army do exactly and distinctly know, that they now have, and
for many months have had great numbers under their pay, both English, French,
and other Nations, whom at their Inrollment (and ever since) they did know to
have been professed Papists; Whereas by the contrary, it is notoriously known,
that before this course was taken by the other party, His Majesty and His
Ministers did not admit to, nor continue any Soldiers in pay, who were
suspected to be that way inclined, or did refuse the Oaths of Alleagiance and
Supremacy; Not that His Majesty thought it unlawful for him so to do, or that
he did not hold his Recusant Subjects to be as strongly obliged by the Laws of
this Land, for the defense of His Person, and the Liberty of Parliaments, and
Laws of this Kingdom, as any of His Protestant Subjects: For if the Kingdom
now stood under the fear of a Foreign invasion; Is it to be conceived that
the Recusants of this Land were not by the Laws of the same obliged to
adventure their lives and fortunes in the defense thereof? Sure the great
confusion which is now in this kingdom, is of as fearful a consequence as
any Foreign Invasion possible can be; and therefore Recusants are so far
from being disobliged, as they stand deeply obliged for giving their assistance
in this time of extremity; But His Majesty was very cautelous, and tender in
this point, and certainly would not have looked toward it, if the other party
had not first assumed that liberty to themselves, from which by the Law of the
Land he saw himself no way barred.

Because the Earl, or who else is the Author of that Declaration under his
name, takes upon him to be privy to his Majesty's intentions, and to excuse his
Majesty's Ministers concerning the arming of Popish Recusants, it were
earnestly to be wished that men would not withhold the truth with
unrighteousness, nor go about to deceive the world with Colors. Let the
Author declare who chalked the way to His Majesty's Counselors and Ministers,
to advise and procure His Majesty to recommend, if not authorize Randoll Mac
donell, now Earl of Antrim, a Papist (and by descent mere Irish, being the
Grandson to Sorley boy mac donell by the Fathers side, and of the most
perfidious Traitor and enemy of the truth, Hugh Oneale, Earl of Tirone, by the
Mothers side, who also was one of the Conspirators of the present Rebellion in
Ireland, and yet is harbored about Newcastle, or Durham) to raise an Army in
Ireland, with which he being General, should invade the kingdom of Scotland;
a design, though crossed, more through emulation and envy, then for any regard
to his Majesty's Honor, or conscience to afflict a Protestant Church and
Nation by an Army of Papists, discovers plainly that there has been an
intention to admit Papists to serve under His Majesty, for the destruction of
some of his Protestant Subjects before such a supposed chalking out of the way,
as the Author of this Declaration pretends, as may further be evidenced by the
bringing of 500. Soldiers out of Ireland to Carlisle, a part (if not the
greatest) of that number being Papists, and the many Popish Commanders,
Captains, Officers, and Soldiers entertained and employed in the two
Northern Expeditions against Scotland, in the latter of which, Garret Barry,
now Lieutenant General of the Rebels Army in the Province of Munster in
Ireland, served; having quit his places held under the King of Spain, to come
into England for an employment in that Expedition; another Barry also, a Papist
much coversant at the Court, was Sergeant Major of a Regiment of Horse,
Colonel Plunket, now in Rebellion in Ireland, Colonel Rely, an Irish man,
with very many other Papists of Ireland, were enabled by the entertainment they
received in England in those Northern Expeditions, to do no small mischief
since to the Protestants, besides many others of Foreign Nations, with our
own well known Country men of the Popist Religion; Witness likewise the Army
raised in Ireland in the beginning of the year 1640. in a manner consisting of
Papists altogether, save that the chief Officers of the Field, and diverse
other Officers and Soldiers were Protestants, that kingdom at that time not
affording men of the Popish Religion, having Military abilities to discharge
the duties of so great places, but nothing wanted to let them know how much
they were relied upon: Sir Tobie Mathews a Jesuit, attended upon the Earl of
Strafford into Ireland in March, before the raising of that Army, and during
his abode there, was lodged in his Lordships house of residence, the Castle of
Dublin, and every day rid upon one of Sir George Radcliffs horses to one or
other of the public Masse-houses in Dublin, where Sir Tobie consulted often
and seriously with Prelates and other Ecclesiastical persons of the Church of
Rome, by whom he prepared the party of Papists in the Parliament of Ireland
then sitting, to assent to a Declaration against the kingdom of Scotland, and
to grant more Subsidies to advance that war then they have yet paid: But to
come nearer home to the writer of the Declaration, has the Parliament or his
Exeelencie the Earl of Essex given Commissions or power to any Colonel, or
Commander of the Popish Religion to levy, conduct, and command Regiments,
Troops, or Bands of men in the present service? As the Earl of Newcastle, his
Majesty's General in the Northern parts has done; Are there whole Regiments,
or Companies, consisting all, or most part of Papists (exactly and distinctly
known by the Parliament to be such) admitted to serve under the Earl of
Essex, or any other Commander in Chief employed by the Parliament? Surely
none. But such are in great esteem and credit, and much trusted in the
several Armies lately raised, and now on foot by virtue of several
Commissions granted by his Majesty to the Earl of Newcastle and others, to
defend the Protestant Religion, the Laws of this kingdom (by which Papists
are declared unfit to be trusted with Arms) and the Liberty of the Subject,
as is pretended: Now admitting some Papists have through negligence, or by
friendship with private Captains, or other Officers, got into the Parliaments
Army (as it may be supposed some have done of purpose to betray the Counsels
and designs of that Army) is that a good justification for exciting and
authorizing all the Papists in the North and other places fit to bear Arms,
to take up Arms for for the destruction of the Protestants and suppression of
Religion, Laws, and Liberties established in the Land? The Author of the said
Declaration glanceth at the Proclamation lately published, prohibiting all
Popish Recusants to come to his Majesty's Court, unless they would take the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; stricter Proclamations against Papists have
been freequent heretofore, yet they never affrighted the Papists, who were
well acquainted with the intentions of the Advisors of such Proclamations: It
is recorded in History that a Christian Emperor having under hand waged a
great Army to war upon the Pope, caused the City of Rome to be sacked, and
the Pope to be besieged in the Castle of Saint Angelo, yet when the tidings
thereof became public and famous in all countries; he ordained a Fast to be
observed in his Court for the safety and delivery of the Pope; an impious
dissimulation, and such as should not be imitated by any Prince Christian.

But it must be acknowledged that the Author of the Declaration aforesaid,
deals more plainly then the Penmen of his Majesty's Declarations usually
do, for he affirms that his Majesty thinks it not unlawful for him to
admit into his service, and continue in pay professed Papists, and that his
Majesty does hold his Recusant subjects (meaning Papists) to be as strongly
obliged by the Laws of the Land, for the defense of his person, and the
liberty of Parliaments, and Laws of the Kingdom, as any of his Protestant
Subjects, etc. whether his Majesty will avow the same or no is yet unknown,
therefore till time discover it, let the Earl of Newcastle, or who else
published the said Declaration under his name, be favorably pleased to
understand, that although all Subjects be alike obliged by Law for defense of
their Sovereigns person, and the liberties and Laws of the Kingdom, yet all
Subjects have not the like interest in the liberties and Laws of the Kingdom
now in force; neither did any Papist ever affirm, that he affects the liberty
of the Parliaments as Protestants do, which his Majesty knows well by their
carriage and insinuation at all times to bring him to dislike with Parliaments,
if it were possible: And albeit his Majesty may be construed to be exempt from
the Excommunication of Pope Pius against the Kingdom of England, because he
was not borne in England, yet when the Prince of Wales, or any of his Majesty's
Children shall succeed in the Royal Throne, they may be accounted
Excommunicate, and if the Pope do at any time hereafter enjoyne the Papist to
deny Alleagiance to his Majesty by color of that Excommunication, or some
other Roman device, may find as little fidelity in the Papists, as Queen
Elizabeth did, and they will never conceive themselves so obliged as is set
forth in the said Declaration, in regard they held a supremacy in the Pope
above the King in matters Ecclesiastical, which at this time are become not
the least occasions of the apparent evils, and threatened ruin ready to fall
upon his Majesty's Dominions; nor does the taking of the Oath of Supremacy
secure their alleagiance or fidelity to the Kings of England, being
Protestants, considering there is a power admitted by them to be in the Pope to
dispense with Oaths, in matters less conducing to the advancement of the
Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, then to dissemble in taking the Oath of Supremacy,
as testifies the Example of Cardinal Askanius, who being released out of
prison by the French King, and after great kindnesses received in that
Kingdom, was permitted to go to Rome with the Cardinal D' Amboise to be at
the election of a Pope, to succeed Pope Alexander, took an Oath that he would
return to France again, yet refused so to do, having obtained the Popes
dispensation to break his faith with the Christian King, which a Heathen
Roman of old would not do to escape the most grievous torments; the matter
then standing thus, and the Law of England not allowing that Papists should
have Arms, although the King may dispense with the Law in some cases, for the
good and tranquillity of the people, yet in this case, where one of the
pretenses for Arming is the defense of the Protestant Religion, and another
pretense is the maintenance of privileges of Parliament; Why is not his
Majesty barred by the equity and intent of the Law from admitting Papists into
the present service? Seeing all papists are taught to have both the protestant
Religion, and the parliament more then any Religion or Court of Justice in the
world, and therefore cannot be conceived by any of mean understanding, much
less by the Earl of Newcastle, to stand neither so deeply obliged, nor so
well affected to defend either the Kings person, being a protestant, or the
protestant Religion, or privileges of parliament, as the protestant Subjects
of England are.

The Author of the aforsaid declaration poceedeth to examyne the pretended in
conveniences where with the arming of papists is alleged to be attended, and
in the first place voucheth for justification of the uniustifiable arming of
papists, the example of the Emperor Charles the first, who being a Popish
Emperor did not refuse the service of any of the Protestants of Germany in that
Army wherewith he made war upon the Protestants; Secondly, he cites the
example of Henry the fourth, the late French King, while he was a Protestant,
and did not reject the assistance of the french Papists that adhered to him,
and lastly the example of the States of the united Provinces, who do not
reject the auxiliary Regiments under the pay of the french King, because many
of them (if not most) are papists: how far remote these examples are from the
present case, let all indifferent men judge: the Emperor Charles the fifth
warred upon the protestants because they were protestants, and if in that case
he admitted protestants to serve under him, and employed them in suppressing
and destroying their brethren, we will blame his policy, and if at this day
the Civil Wars of England were waged by his Majesty, to restrain the
insolences and practices of the papists (who doubtless intend the like
cruelties in England, as have been acted against the protestants in Ireland)
who would think amiss of admitting papists to fight against papists, as in
the Civil Wars of Ireland in Queen Elizabeth's Reign; moreover all the
soldiers serving in the Army raised by the parliament, rare, and ever will be
ready to spend their lives in defense of his Majesty's person, and desire
nothing but confirmation of the Laws to be secured against the continual plots
and practices of the Papists, to subvert this Noble Kingdom, and establish the
Articles of the Antichristian Counsel of Trent therein, which may be the more
easily effected by them, if once His Majesty shall be so far seduced by evil
Counsel, as to continue them in Armies against his Parliament, upon pretense
of jealousies, and suspicions of disaffection to his Royal person, a thing far
below the thoughts of any Protestant, much more of the high Court of
Parliament, who have in so many Declarations called God to witness the
integrity of their hearts, to aim at nothing but the glory and greatness of
his Majesty, and the preservation of Gods holy worship without mixture of
Idolatry, superstition, or error: As to the example of the late French King,
was not his Succession and Coronation opposed by the Guises, and the Pope? Only
because he was an Hugonite (as they term all Protestants in France) had he in
any thing violated the Laws of the Realm when the holy League was made up to
exclude him from possessing his royal Throne, or was be ever said to suffer
evil Counselors to go about, or endeavor to introduce other Government then
the former Government of the Kingdom? Although these had not been causes
sufficient, yet was there not the least of these pretended, what wonder was it
then, if French papists adhered to their rightful and undoubted Successor of
the Crown of France, and he should use their service against their fellow
papists, who would set up Tyrants to rule against Law and good Conscience: This
example therefore may not serve for justifying the Earl of Newcastles arming
of papists at this time, no more then the other example of the States of
Holland to admit the auxiliary Regiments of French men, some of whom may be,
and are papists, nay supposing they were all papists, the Christian world sees
manifestly they may be employed in the Wars against the Spaniard, it is but
papist against papist still, it is not against the protestants those French
auxiliaries are employed, neither are they made use of to hinder the
establishing and security of the protestant Religion: Let then all Englishmen
that are not papists, be well advised, lest any impertinnent arguments divide
them, but in all loyal dutifulness continue in unity, and endeavor to
preserve the peace of the Land, aad defend each others persons and estates
against those enemies of their Religion and Laws, now armed by the Earl of
Newcastle, and bear the reproaches of such men patiently until the Almighty,
who rules the hearts of Kings, crown the religious endeavors of those that
seek not their own, but the glory of God, and his Majesty, with blessings of
peace, unity, and love in the fruition of his Majesty's royal favor and
concurrence, to settle the distracted and distressed condition of this most
noble and potent Kingdom, and of poor Ireland now sowed thick with the
bodies of Martyrs, whose blood will doubtless produce a plentiful harvest of
living Saints, through the mighty power of him that propagated his Gospel into
all Lands, maugre all worldly power and policy that opposed it, I say no more,
accounting the inferences of the Declarator unworthy of answer, but conclude
with the Psalmist,

Psalm. 129. Ver. 5, 6. Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate
Zion.
Let them be as grass upon the house top, which withers before it grows up.
Amen.

FINIS.
