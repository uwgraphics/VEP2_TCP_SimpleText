Usque quo Domine? Rev. 6. 10. 2 Chronicles. 13. 9. Have ye not cast out the Priests
of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you Priests
after the manner of the Nations of other Lands? so that whosoever comes to
consecrate himself with a young bullock, and seven rams, the same may be a
Priest of no gods. 2 Chronicles. 36. 16. But they mocked the messengers of God, and
despised his words, and misused his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose
against his people, till there was no remedy. Luke 6. 22, 23. Blessed are you,
when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you, ((...), shall
sequester you) and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil ((...),
as malignant) for the Son of man's sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for
joy, for behold your reward is great in heaven, for according to these things
did their Fathers to the Prophets. Phil. 1. 28, 29. In nothing be ye terrified
by your adversaries; which to them is an evident token of perdition, but to you
of salvation, and that of God. For unto you the grace is given in the behalf
of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake. 2 Timothy
4. 3. For the time will be, when they will not endure wholesome doctrine; but
having itching ears, shall heap to themselves Teachers according to their own
private lusts. 1 Pet. 4. 16, 17, 18. If any man suffer as a Christian, let him
not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this behalf. For the time is come,
that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us,
what shall the end be of them that obey not the Gospel of God? And if the just
man be saved with difficulty, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
FINIS.
