The Friar Well-fitted. OR,
A pretty J^st that once befell,
How a Maid put a Friar to cool in the Well.
To a merry Tune.


AS I lay musing all a lone,
Fa, la, la, la, la.
A pretty feast I thought upon,
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Then listen a while, and I will you tell,
Of a Friar that loved a bonny Less well
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly.
He came to the Maid when she went to bed
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Desiring to have her maidenhead,
Fa, la, la, la, la.
But she denied his desire,
And told him that she feared Hell fire:
Fa, la, etc.
Tush (quoth the Friar) thou need'st not doubt
Fa, la, la, la, la.
If thou were in Hell, I coul'd sing the out, request,
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Then (quoth the Maid) thou shall have thy
The Friar was glad as Fox in his nest.
Fa, la, etc.
But one thing (quoth she) I do desire,
Fa, la, la; la, la.
Before you have what you require,
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Before that you shall do the thing,
An Angel in money then shall me bring,
Fa, la, etc.
Tush, quoth the Friar we shall agree,
Fa, la, la, la. la.
No money shall part my Love and me,
Fa, la, la la, la,
Before that I will see the lack,
I Will pawn my gray Gown from my back.
Fa, la, etc.
The Maid bet bought her of a wile,
Fa, la, la, la, la,
How she the Friar might beguile,
Fa, la, la, la, la.
While he was gone the truth to fell,
She hung a cloth before the well,
Fa, la, etc.
The Friar came as his covenant was,
Fa, la, la, la, la.
With money unto his bonny Less,
Fa, la, la la, la.
Good morrow fair Maid, good morrow quoth he,
Here is the money I promised thee.
Fa, la, la, etc.
She thankt the man, and she took his money
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Now let us go to it, quoth he, sweet honey,
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Oh stay, quoth she, some respite make,
My Father comes, he will me take.
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly
The second part,
to the smae tune.


ALas (quoth the Friar) where shall I run,
Fa, la, la, la, la.
To hide me till that he be gone,
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Behind the cloth run thou, quoth she,
And there my Father cannot thee see.
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly.
Behind the cloth the Friar crept
Fa, la, la, la, la.
And into the Well on the sudden he leapt,
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Alas quoth he, I am in the Well,
No matter quoth she, if thou were in Hell.
Fa, la, la, etc.
Thou say thou could sing me out of Hell
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Now I prithee sing thy self out of ye Well
Fa, la, la, la, la.
The Friar sung on with a pitiful sound
Oh help me out; or I shall be drowned.
Fa, la, la, la, etc.
I trow quoth she, your courage is cooled
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Quoth the Friar, I never was so cooled
Fa, la, la, la, la.
I never was served so before
Then take heed quoth she, thou come there no more
Fa, la, etc.
Quoth he, for sweet Saint Francis sake
Fa, la, la, la, la.
On his Disciple pity take
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Quoth she Saint Francis never taught
His Scholars to tempt young Maids to naught.
Fa, la, etc.
The Friar did entreat her still
Fa, la, la, la, la.
That she would help him out of the Well
Fa, la, la, la, la.
She heard him make much pitious moan
She helped him out and bid him be gone.
Fa, la, etc.
Quoth be, shall I have my money again
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Which thou from me have beforehand taken
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Good sir, said she, there is no such matter
I Will make you pay for fouling my water.
Fa, la, etc.
The Friar went all along the street,
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Droping wet like a new washed sheep
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Both old and young commended the Maid,
That such a witty prank had played.
Fa, la, la, la, la.
Fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly.
FINIS.
