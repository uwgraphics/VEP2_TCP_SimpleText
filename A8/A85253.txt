Upon the English Gusman.
THe Seene's quite altered, for we plainly see
Our English Gusman is the Man: It Is he
Does far excel the Spanish Gusman; who
Did many brave and handsome Robb'ries too,
Yet is far short in that, as it is expressed:
For HIND could neatly Rob, and neatly Jest.
It Is He; the Sadlers Son, the Butchers Boy,
His Father's grief, and once his Mothers Joy.
Who run from's Master, and to London came*
To seek his Fortune, and to get a Name:
Where he not long had been, but quickly made*
Himself a Member of the Cutters Trade,
And grew therein so Excellent, that He
Soon commenced Master of that Company:
And this to's Honor is Recorded further,
The Poor he Robbed not, nor committed Murder.
Coasting the Country's, at the last a WITCH
Enchanted him, and gave his Horse a Switch;
Which lasted but for three years time, and then
His Spell expired, and He Is as other Men.
And to be short, he now in Newgate lies
In th'Hole a Prisoner, till he is cleared or dies.
Let this suffice thee, Reader, for thou wilt find
The famous Gusman, is our English HIND.

Here now thou see me as a Butchers Boy,
And sporting with a Dog in Merriment*
Hereafter thou will read the Tricks I play,
Which may afford Thee pleasure and content.
For there is no Robb'ry yet I ere did do,
But does contain at least a Jest, or two.

To the Reader.
Reader,
IT is one thing to do, and another thing to do well; a man may do that by
which he may be undone: but he that does that he needs not be ashamed of,
carries an inward security, that contemns outward violence. The Devil when he
has a Design upon some frail person, tickles him with the conceit of acting
something that may draw a fame upon him; the greediness to purchase which, makes
him ^orget to (...) himself; whether it be good or evil; but he runs the
hazard, and at the last is taken in it; for it is the property of the Devil to
leave his friends when they stand in most need of him; from whom too many now a
days draw Example.

If he has done something that makes him talked of; he concludes straight the
world applauds him; when report speaks to the contrary, and rather discovers
and betrays him; but heel not stick at one adventure, since the first proved so
fortunate, but is resolved to pursue further; till he come to that place, where
we will leave James Hind the subject of our Treatise.

Thus has the Itch of praise and vain conceit drawn nany from their honest
callings, that might not only have lived contentedly, but died peaceably, and
so have lived that death might never have bin feared.

I shall not trouble you with a long Epistle, only thus much I shall say, that
this Thief of whom I treat, has been the grandest of this age, and unparalelled
by former ages; nay, I may say not by future times, for resolution undaunted,
of wit, and conceit (for design) unexampled; so that what hatred the effect of
his Feats purchased, the quaintness of them pall^ated; that we may well
conclude.

Though Clavil's fortune far more happy proved;
This lives, and yet may die, much more beloved.
George Fidge.

An Advertisement to the Reader.
Reader, THOU will not find this ensuing History set out, and garnished with a
fine style, and studied phrase; but (which is best of all) an ordinary
Expression, a natural Story, and a pure Jest; That so the meanest may
understand what they read, and not be perplexed with difficult words: I doubt
not but upon perusal, Thou will find it pleasant and witty; and that our
English Gusman is as Famous in these Times, as ever the Spanish in his Time.

In assurance whereof, I rest, Thine G. F.

THE English Gusman; OR THE HISTORY Of that Unparalled Thief JAMES HIND.
The PROLOGVE
READER,
I Shall not be tedious before I give you the chiefest things done in his Life;
but first I shall desire you to take notice what his Father was; how he was
bred up to Write and Read, though he took no delight therein; next, how be was
bound an Apprentize; which was but a slavish life to him; and how it was his
fortune to meet with some Robbers, by whom he was tutored: and further how,
after many Robberies, he was at last favored by a WITCH, who gave him an
Enchantment for a certain Time; which having obtained, he most ordinarily
Robbed by himself; but the time expiring, and his Enchantment growing out of
date; he lay as open to be taken, and to the Law as any other Thief, as here
after will appear: And lastly, the manner of his Apprehension, his Examination
before the Council of State, Commitment to the Gatehouse, from thence to
Newgate: and the Discourse that past in Newgate between his Father, Wife, and
Himself: Also his Arraignment, Trial, etc. But this by the way; Now to the
History it self.

FOR his beginning it was derived from the Loins of a Sadler, who lived in
Chippingnorton, where his abode was for many years, in good Reputation and
Credit, and having but one only Son, did resolve (so far as he was able) to
bestow on him a Portion of Learning; and thereupon set him to School to read
English, and ^o Write, where he was for the space of Two years and pro^^ed
little or nothing, for his mind fancied other things: And if there were any
Robberies Committed, he would importunately enquire the Manner of it, and
delighted more in such Relations, then in my thing that tended to his Book, and
was very ^^^able in Jesting; (yet loved not learning) and his Father perceiving
his disaffection thereunto, and to other, A^ts which he would have bestowed
upon him, and finding him incapable, (or rather unwilling) to proceed in the
same any longer; did take him home to see if he could learn him his own trade,
but his mind still wandering, it was in vain for his Father to instruct him in
that Trade, so that his Father bound him an Apprentize unto a Butcher in the
same Town, where he lived for the space of a year, still studying how he might
release himself of that Bondage, thinking every other two, till he was at his
Free Liberty, which he obtained; as you shall see in this ensuing Chapter.

How Hind run from his Master.
HIND living but a weary life with his master, would often complain to his
fellow Apprentize of their Slavish life and condition, and told him, That it
was better to rob on the high way, then so to spend his life, and so resolved
to enlarge his restraint; and upon a time he puts on his best apparel and goes
to his Mother and desires leave of her privately (unknown to his Father) to go
to London; and there he told his Mother, he had a friend that in a short time
would procure him a place to his content; the good old woman loving her only
son so dearly, (being her only joy) that she would not seem to deny him, that
request; but gave him forty shillings, and promised to furnish him with no more
money, until such time as he should be placed; so that now he gives his master
the slip, and travels toward London, and upon the Rode he overtakes some
Carriers, of whom he asked some questions, but they answered him but saucily,
whereupon Hind strikes one of them to the ground, but the rest seeing that,
fell upon him, and entreated him with many sower blows, and at last being
parted, Hind tells them that he would requite their cowardliness; as afterward
he performed by robbing them, as shall be intimated hereafter.

What befell him when he came to London.
HIND being now come to London, did meet with many of his friends, and
acquaintance, and one night being drinking in the City, and too long staying by
the good liquor, made Indentures as he went by the Counter, (a Trap to catch
such Rats, was forced to take a nap before he went any further, and after his
first sleep, awaked and looked about him, saying, This is a large house and may
entertain many guests, but I do not intend to keep my Christmas here; and
afterward meeting with some mad Lads (as mad as himself) in earnest resolved
to be drunk* being before but spiced a little with the same disease, in jest;
now they drink and roar, fearing neither Cunstable, nor Watchmen, (to come to
disturb them) and at this place Hind became acquainted with Allen was in the
Counter for being drunk.
Allen, who now is one of the chief Rogues in the Pack and promised Hind to
entertain him as his servant, and to learn him such an Art, as would for ever
make him a Gentleman, Hind being willing to embrace his proffer, (to be a
Gentleman) vowed, To serve him in any thing: so the morning being come, they
paid their Fees, and were discharged; now Hind is very observant to his new
Master, and thinks his money well spent in the T^pling house, by that means to
get so good a Master, in so short a time; Allen takes his servant to the Tavern
to consult of some points, that they may lose no time.

How Allen instructs his new servant, and sets him to rob a Gentleman.
ALLEN being at the Tavern with the rest of his Crew, began to drink merrily;
but Hind being somewhat modest, went from the table, and stood by them least
his new Master should think him Saucy if he were too familiar, still expecting
what rare Art his Master would teach him; Allen seeing his young man in a Study
took him aside, saying, I would have you be as my companion and friend, and not
as a servant, neither do I look for any such respect as you do give me; you
shall eat and drink as I do, and if I have money, you shall have part, and want
none, and if I want, you must help to get some as well as you can: In short,
Hind condescended, and they swore him to be true to their Gang; which being
done, they admit him as a Brother of their Company: And now to Flesh him they
determined, and went to a stable, where were many brave Horses: Allen bid him
choose his Horse, and to take which he liked best; whereupon Hind did choose the
very best (and Allen and his Gang wondered much to see what an audacious spirit
their new Brother had:) Now they go to Shooters-Hill, where presently they
discovered a Gentleman and his servant coming toward them; and Allen bid Hind
to ride alone up to them, and they would lie in an Ambush if occasion should
serve; thereupon Hind rides to them (being already tutored to the purpose) and
bids them Stand, and deliver such money as they had, otherwise he would
presently be their death; The Gentleman not willing to die, presently gave him
Ten pounds, which was all the Gentleman had; Hind seeing it was all he had,
said, Sir, here is forty shillings for you to bear your Charges; in regard it
is my Handsale; the Gentleman answered, I wish you better luck with it then I
have; so Hind took his way, and came to the rest of the gang; and Allen praised
him for learning his Art so quickly, saying, did you not see, How he robbed him
with a Grace.

How Hind sold his Horse to a Citizen of London.
HInd having Liberty to ride where he pleased, having his Art already so
perfectly; upon a time took an occasion to ride to Barnet, where he took up his
Inn, and there met with some Gentlemen, and were very merry together; and after
Supper, Hind went to He fed him with flesh.
feed his horse, and see him dressed, and some of the Company went with him (but
chiefly a Citizen) and when they came into the Stable, the Citizen looked upon
all the Horses, wishing, he had a better then his own; his being the worst; and
switching the horses, at last switched Hinds, which leapt with such courage, as
made the young Citizen wish him his own; and asked the Hostler, whose horse it
was; the Hostler answered, it is the Gentleman's in the gray suit. I wish he
would sell him me, said the Citizen; In the interim, Hind came into the Stable
where the Citizen and the Hostler were; The Hostler said, Sir, will you sell
your horse: Hind said, that money would buy him; Sir, said the Citizen, I have
a good Gelding here, but that he is out of flesh; what shall I give you, and my
Gelding, for your Horse, Hind said, Sir, you shall give me five and twenty pound
and your Gelding; The Citizen told him it was too much; yet said he, I will
give you 20 l. in Gold and my gelding, which is worth 8 l. for your horse: Now
he strikes him earnest with a piece of gold, Hind loving that kind of money,
yielded that a bargain; the Citizen had the best bargain, if he could have kept
the horse; though he bought him by Candlelight: The Citizen pays Hind the rest
of the gold, and gives him a pottle of sack for good luck; after their mirth
they go to bed. In the morning, Hind, out of courtesy, would have the Citizen
on his way; but as they rod, Hind found fault that he rayned his horse too
hard, saying, he is tender mouthed, and you will put him quite out of his pace:
But they now riding in Endfield-Chase, Hind desired the Citizen to let him ride
the horse, and he would show him how to pace him right; the Citizen easily
believing what Hind said, alighted, and mounted the horse that Hind rid; Hind
finding himself well settled on his own horse, paced him a little way; Sir, said
Hind, you shall see his true pace the next time you see me; so he rod at full
speed till he was out of the Citizens sight: the Citizen began to wonder at
this sudden change, still thought that Hind was but in jest; but when he found
it in earnest, wished that he had never seen Hind nor his horse: But wishing
was in vain! for Hind was sooner out of the Citizens sight then out of his
mind: for his mind was sometimes of his gold, and sometimes of the horse; not
knowing which was the greatest loss to him. Being in this study, he was
recolected to his senses by some Company; who asked him the reason of his
melancholy; to whom, when he had related his bad fortune, thought to have had
some comfort of them: but it proved otherwise; for instead of comforting him,
they fell a laughing and jearing him. The Citizen said, Gentlemen, forbear, for
this is worse then the loss of all, to be laughed at.

Hinds return home to Allen, and what happened afterward.
HInd rod merrily home, giving his Master a good account of the time he was
absent, showing him the Citizens gold, and telling him the jest: Allen laughing
at his new servants forwardness, highly commending his wit to other of the
gang; who were much in love with their new Brothers conceits. Having all a
fancy to travel, they go into the Country; under many disguises they rob:
Sometimes with a Coach: sometimes as Noblemen and their servants: much harm
they did, undiscovered: but riding along, they spied a Gentleman's Coach coming
full of Gentlewomen, whom they ransack of their money, Jewels, Rings, and the
best of their Carriage, leaving them but two horses to draw their Coach, which
before had six: Now they leave the Ladies with their slow driving, to overtake
them if they can: They having their bie-places to unload their carriage, and
divide their spoil: made themselves merry with a portion which was to be the
preferment of a young Lady; but being paid before she was married, spoiled the
sport: for the young Gallants love was not so hot, but this news quickly coold
it: Which shows that money is the chiefest drug, to put off a homely piece of
flesh in these days.

How Hind parted from his Company, and appointed to meet them at a certain
place; and how he robbed two Gentlemen's servants; and caused a Parson to be
apprehended for a high-way-man, and escaped himself.
HInd being informed of a Purchase, desired leave of his gang, to go by himself
for a day, and appointed them to meet him at a certain place; but his plot
failed: and being vexed, he not much minded his way, but rod on another road,
where he espied some gentlemen drinking at an Alehouse on horseback, having
sent their servants before: Hind passed by them; but riding at a good rate,
quickly overtook the Gentlemen's servants, who rod but easily: Hind being with
them, saw by their Portmantles that there was money in them; bid deliver the
money, or he would be their death: they being not used to fight, yielded unto
him; but he seeing their delays would breed danger; with his dagger-knife, cut
open the Portmantles, and took out the money, and tying the baggs together,
laid them before him and rid full speed away: one of the servants rod to
acquaint their Master, who presently persued Hind hard: Hind met a Parson and
said to him, Sir, I am like to be robbed, you must stand to it now for your own
good as well as mine: they would have this money from me, which you see. Come
Sir, be of good cheer, one honest man will skare ten thieves: you shall have
one of my pistols: so Hind gives the Parson a pistol ready cock't and charged,
and bids him fire at them that come first; while I ride down to the next
Village and raise the Countrey-people to be our help. The Parson having taken a
cup too much at a wedding, was pot-valliant, and rid up boldly to the
Gentlemen, and fired his Pistol at them; but being too far off, did no
execution to either of them; but he rid nigher to them, and flung the Pistol at
one of them, that he had like to have knocked him off his horse: the Gentlemen
seize on him, and take him prisoner: the Parson cries out, spare my life, and
you shall have all my money: no Sir, said the Gentlemen, we will have you
hanged: what? a Parson and rob on the highway: they presently hale him to the
next Justice of the Peace, which was very near: when they came before the
Justice, they told him, That they were robbed of almost two hundred pounds; and
that this Parson was one of the Thieves: the Justice marvailed that such an
apparent testimony should come against the Parson of his Parish.

The Parson by this time was come to himself, and desired the Justice to give
him leave to speak for himself: being licensed to speak, he said to the
Justice, Sir, you have known me this twenty years, and no man can say I have
wronged him of a penny; much less this which is laid to my charge; Sir, I shall
tell you so much as I know of this business: as I was riding in my way home, I
met a man who had two baggs of money before him, who told me that thieves
persued him, and he desired my help; and said that I need not fear, for One
honest man would beat Ten thieves: so he gave me a Pistol charged, cockt and
primed, and bid me fire at the first that came, while he raised the Country
men to assist us: but when these Gentlemen came down the hill, I rod up to
them, and fired my pistol among them, and when I had so done, I flung it at
this Gentleman's head, thinking they had been Pointing at one present.
thieves: Sir, this is all I know of the matter. The Justice laughed to see the
Parson of his Parish apprehended for a high-way-man; so the Justice past his
word for his appearance the next Assizes: who when he was brought before the
Bench, was He might have been hanged.
cleared: But he made a vow never to fire Pistols more.

How Hind came to his Company showing them the money; and what happened to them
at the same time.
HIND having Escaped by leaving the Parson in the ^^rch: came to the place
appointed by his Companions, where being merry he shows them his days work;
one of the A good servant.
servants of the house over-hearing their discourse: told his Master of it, who
to clear himself of them: hearing so many Hew and Cries abroad for such men,
went and acquainted the next Constable of it: who went for a warrant to
apprehend them: Hind having a quick wit, did guess by the peoples staring up to
the windows, that they were discovered: he then speaks to all his Company to
shift He provides for one.
for themselves: he takes one of his bags and goes into the stable: and mounts
his horse, and was gone before any of the other could find their cloaks and
necessaries to be going: there came in this mean time many people in, who
filled the yard with noise, that they could scarce hear one another: Allen to
appease the multitude, flung handfuls of money among them: saying, Good people
forbear coming any farther, and be civil: for we are Gentlemen: and to the
contrary expect death some of you: Now Allen and his Comrades descend the
stairs with their swords drawn and their pistols cock't; the Townsmen being but
slightly armed, they found small resistance: for more came to see then to
fight, Allen makes his way to the stable: where they mounted all their horses,
and rod out at the back gate of the Inn: but riding hard they met with hew and
cries, which had raised the Country, who fell foul upon Allen and his lads; but
Allens men being well mounted, much injured the Country men: who had no more
mind now to follow them: Allen being free from trouble as he thought, yet
spared no horse flesh to be out of the way: but being twenty miles off that
place: now thought himself safe: where after supper he went to bed; he had not
taken his first sleep before there were search made all over the Town for such
men: who at the last came to the Inn where Allen lay: the Constable being
somewhat silley, was satisfied with a reasonable Answer: for they came to his
Chamber, where by his attend^nce he seemed to be some great person: The
Counstable was a softly man.
Allen was amassed to see so many lights, and w^tchbills, in his Chamber, said
Mr. Counstable, You might have been more civil, then to press into my Chamber A
great mistake.
at this time of the night: Sir, said the Counstable I was commanded so to do:
I would your torches and candles were all out, said Allen, otherwise I shall
not sleep: He speaks to his man.
Jack: give the Counstable five shilings to make his watchmen drink: I thank
you sir said the Counstable, I see you are an honest Gentleman now: Good night
sir: Good night Mr. Counstable: I pray let me hear no more of you.

The Counstable descending the stairs; said to some of his watchmen, I am sorry
I have troubled the Gentleman: did you not see what a glorious shute lay on the
Table: I Will warrant it cost twenty Nobles, at least: his men I believe are all
Gentlemen or Gentlemen's sons; good lord! If I had taken these men for the
Robbers, What should have become of me, and Pointing to all the watch.
you too: one of Allens men came down and called for a pint of Sack in a Gallon
pot: the Counstable drank Sack like small Beer, till the watchmen were troubled
to carry him, for go he could not; so we leave the Counstable drunk as he is:
and return to Allen: who is in a sweat.

How Allen caused his men not to go to bed, but to sit up and drink, fearing
least a plot should be laid to take him: and how in the morning he would have
robbed a Steward to a Noble man.
WHEN Allen's men came from the Counstable, he said to them, How goes the
squares abroad: they answer him very well: feel my hands said Allen, If I was
not in a fear when they came: well we are much bound to God that he gave this
Counstable no more understanding; otherwise we might have looked out at a grate
by this time; I hope that Meaning Hind.
James is well, for I love him dearly; Gentlemen, I shall desire you to sit up
this night for fear of the worst: so Allen made as though that disturbance
would not let him sleep any more that night: saying, When my first sleep is
broke, I can sleep no longer: so he sends one of his servants to the Host of
the house to come and drink with him: who being a good fellow, never denies
drink, came willingly to Mr. Allen: (who told him, he was sorry there was any
disturbance in the house; but being in all other Inns, he hoped he would not be
offended: No, no, said Allen, I am not troubled, but only for my He could not
sleep in quiet for fear of taking.
sleep: but this shall be your penalty that you drink all night with me; sir,
said the Host, I shall fulfill your desire: then said Allen I will rise; there
being a great fire in the room: their drink was muld sack till morning: which
when it appeared he caused all his men to be in a readiness for to take horse:
and accordingly his desire was accomplished, so taking leave of his Host, rod
away: but riding by-ways because of the hew and cries overtook a Gentleman
riding with a port mantle behind him: Allen used some discourse; and among the
rest asked if he lived thereabouts: he answered yes, I am a steward to a noble
man in these parts, and I have been to fetch in some rents that lay forty miles
off: Allen was glad when he heard he had money: said, sir, how do you think I
maintain all these Gentlemen: shall I tell you: I borrow of those that are not
Most stewards are knaves in their ^earts
willing to give or to lend: sir, said the Steward you are merrily disposed:
and are willing to try my patience: I speak in earnest said Allen, therefore
unto your portmantle: sir, said the Steward, if you will have it, I cannot now
gainsay it: I am a servant, and if you take this money from me I am undon; but
I will direct you to a greater purchase if you let me escape: to this Allen
consented: the Steward pulled out of his pocket a Letter, which his Lord had
sent him, signifying that one of his Lords Creditors was come from London for
two hundred pounds, which was to be paid as soon as he came home: this somewhat
satisfied Allen; who swear the Steward to be true to them, and he should have
share of what they got: the Steward guides them to a friends Inn of his, where
they lay secure. till he brought them news of the Merchants traveling, they
soon stayed his journey by easing him of his money: thus you may see how some
men to save themselves from a little harm, will easily undo other men to get
gain:

How Hind Robbed a Gentleman on foot, and furnished himself with a horse, money
and clothes.
HIND having never a horse whereby his trade failed him, was resolved to get
one, or to follow the trade on foot: hearing of his His Master was hanged.
Masters misfortune, grieved him much; but being past, he resolved to forget,
and cast it out of his mind. And now to color his knavery, puts himself in
the habit of a Shepherd, with a long staff in his hand: and so travels toward
Cambridg; where in his way he espies a Gentleman coming down a hill leading his
horse in his hand: Hind, as if he took no notice of the Gentleman: went
whistling the tune of an ordinary Psalm: when the Gentleman came to the foot of
the hill where Hind now stood whistling his Psalm: the Gentleman enquired of
him the time of the day; he answered him very civilly: but as the Gentleman was
getting on his horse, Hind hit him with his long pole such a stroke between the
head and the shoulders, that he made him tumble on the ground: Hind presently
took his money, cloak, horse, and sword, and left him his old coat, and his
pike-staff, to beat one the hoof as he had done, giving him twenty shillings
back to bear his charges: but to this day, the Gentleman loves not the tune of
a Psalm.

How Hind after he had left his company, Robbed a Doctor of Physic of forty
pound in Gold.
HIND having left his Gang, and now riding by himself made a vow never to keep
so many lads company; for being but a little in drink, you might easily
understand what they were, which would endanger all their necks: therefore to
save himself as long as he could, shund all their company: and resolved to ride
only by himself; and what he then got, was not to be shared: riding and musing,
he came to a Hill, where he alighted, and as he came down, saw a Handkerchief
full of little Boxes and Papers, he takes them up and looks in the boxes, and
there was pills gilded; and in the papers certain minerals and powders: Hind
very carefully carries them, knowing that some Doctor or Apothecary had lost
them: being now at the foot of the hill, he mounts his Cheval, and away he
rides the beaten Road: The Doctor which had lost these things, by chance misses
them, and rides back, remembering he had them when he came down the hill: He
meets Hind, who seeing him in that civil habit, did guess him to be the man who
had lost those things. The Doctor said, Sir, I pray did you se a handkerchief
with Physical things in it? Hind answers him, I did take up such a thing on the
hill, and here it is at your service: The Doctor said, Sir, I cannot go with
you to the Town to requite your courtesy, but I will engage you to go to a
Knights house hard by, whether I am going, and we will have a bottel of sack,
and a game The Doctor was a gamster.
at Gleek or Cribidg, and to morrow I will have you five mile on your way; to
this Their bargain is now made.
Hind agreed; and now they ride together to the Knights house, where the Doctor
was very familiar; and said, Sir William, I am come once more, and have brought
my friend with me to be merry to night: The Knight bid them welcome; and having
them into his Parlor, where two or three friends were at cards: the Knight
makes Hind welcome, and drinks to him a boul of sack; and after small entreaty,
Hind makes them all merry with one pretty He was bold enough
Jest or another: Then the Knight desires the Doctor and Hind to play a game at
Gleek with him; being set to it, they play high: twelvepenny Gleek, and ten
shillings the best Trump: supper being ready, they were called from the sport;
Hind having lost about five pound, with modesty, left off: the Knight having
lost twenty five pounds to the Doctor, who won thirty pounds in all: Now they
go to supper, where with much mirth they pass away the time; after supper they
go to cards again; the Doctor quarrels with Hind, and taxes him with foul play;
Hind knowing how the case stood, yields it a loss, and leaves off play with the
Doctor; the Doctor plays till he had won fifty pound of the Knight; being late
they give over, and after a cup of sack they go to bed: Hind and the Doctor
lodge together; when they were in their Chamber, Hind invites the Doctor to a
Dinner at the next Town, and their bargain is to go He had better have staid,
or gone with company.
privately (being the Doctors desire ch^efly) after the Doctors pipe was out, he
pulls out his money and told it on a table; the silver he put by it self into a
Cabinet which was given him by the Lady of the house; but the gold he put in a
little bugle purse and kept it in his pocket: In the morning early, Hind gets
up, and calls the Doctor, who presently arose, and went to the stable, and so
mounted their horses: and now they study what to have for their He gave him a
Breakfast indeed.
Breakfast when they come to the Town; but as they rod, Hind and the Doctor
could not agree: many words past; but in the end, Hind seeing his opportunity,
said, Sir, I must have your purse of gold, therefore make no delay, but deliver
it to me: The Doctor seeing no remedy among all his receipts for this disease,
delivered it to Hind: well Sir; said Hind, I shall desire one courtesy more of
you Mr. Doctor; that you ride back and excuse me to the Knight and his good
Lady, and tell them, that my mind run so much on your gold, that I could not
take my leave: The Doctor rod back with a heavy heart and a light purse: but
being come home to the Knight, he did his Errant, whereat they laughed; and he
was not a little jeared of a Breakfast:

How Hind was betrayed by two whores: who sent two highway men to take his
money: undhow he killed one of their horses, and robbed the other of his money.
HIND being now full of gold, past away the day very merrily, and toward
night, rides to an Inn which stood in a private road, where it seems some
highway men did use; after he had seen his horse carefully dressed and fed, came
into the house, where were two handsome Ladies by the fire; he bespoke a good
supper, and invited the Ladies to it, when supper was ready: he called for
wine, and made them merry; they seemd very coy to him; but he knowing their
humor, pulled out of his pocket a handful of gold, He was never no great singer
singing the Song, of Maids where are your hearts become; Look you what here
is! after much mirth, to bed he went; he had not been long a bed; but the two
men came in who kept these two whores, to whom they said, that there was a
gentleman in the house that had abundance of gold about him: they resolve to
watch his going, and to follow him in the morning; Hind being wakefull, rose
early in the morning and was mounted before those Lads were stirring; when they
heard his horse praunce, they looked out of a window to see him; but the
thieves seeing he had so good a horse, were like to fall out who should have
him: one said, It Is not good to distribute that one has not
I will have the horse, and you shall have his money: nay, said the other, I
will have his horse. They quickly made themselves ready, and rod after Hind;
when they had overtaken him, they asked him which way he rod, he answers them,
toward Cambridg: they tell him they would be glad of his company: now riding
in a place where no people were nigh, one of the thieves sings He jears Hind,
holding money in his hand
Maids where are your hearts become, Look you what here is! Hind seeing their
intent, and knowing he was betrayed, answers them in the same tune: Now you

shot his horse in the head: the horse presently fell down with his Masters leg
under him: the other seeing this, betook him self to flight, but Hind quickly
overtook him, and made him deliver such money as he had: cutting his girts and
his bridle made him work enough to catch his horse again. Hind now rides to the
other theif who now lay in little ease: he alights and pulls the horse from his
leg, and then helps him up, and takes away his money also, saying, is there but
one Master-Thief in England, and would you venture to rob him: verily, were you

Hind gave him his money back which he had taken ^^om him, to buy him another
horse: saying to him, Precious Counsel.
Remember what I say unto you: Disgrace not your selves with small sums, but
aim high, and for great ones; for the least will bring you to the gallows: Hind
shaking the poor thief by the hand, left him to his partner to Small comfort to

Hatfield.
Next; here I am presented to thy view,
Mounted aloft upon a gallant Nagg:
And then behind me does appear to you,
How I Am Enchanted by an ugly Hagg
For Three years space: A little time I wot;
Yet many Pranks I played, and Purses got!


How Hind was Enchanted by a cunning woman, who after some discourse switched
him with a Charmed Rod* not to be taken or harmed during the time this Charm
should last; which was for Three years.
AFter Hind had robbed the High-way-men of their money; It was his chance to
ride to Hatfield, lying at the George-Inn, being then the Posthouse; where he
very merrily spent the evening with some Gentlemen that were there: In the
morning very early Hind calls for his horse, to b^g^n; being now mounted he
takes leave of all those Gentlemen that were stirring; as he rod along
Hatfield, at the Towns end, an old Ill favored woman asked an Alms of him:
his horse presently staid, and would go no further; Sir, said the old woman, I
have something to say to you, and then you shall be gone; Hind not likeing her
Countenance, pulled out five shillings and gave her, thinking she would but like
a Gipsee, tell his fortune: Said, good woman I am in have; Sir, said she, I
have staid all this morning to speak to you; and would you have me lose my
labor: speak your mind, said Hind.

The old woman began thus:

Captain Hind, You ride and go in many dangers; wherefore by my poor Skill, I
have thought on a way to preserve you, for the space of Three Years: but that
time being past, you are no more then an ordinary man, and a mischance may fall
on you, as well as another: but if you be in England, come to me, and I will
renew the Virtue of this Charm again: in saying these words, she pulled out of
her bosom, a little box, almost like a This Star was at the end of a needle,
like a dyal.
Sun Dyal, and gave it Capt in Hind, and said to him, When you are in any
distress, open this, and which way you see the Star turn, ride or go that way,
and you shall escape all dangers: so she switched him with a white Rod that was
in her hand, and struck the horse on the butto^ks, and b^d him farewell: the
horse presently leaped forward with such courage, that Hind could not turn him
to give her thanks; but guessing it was her will it should be so, rod on his
way. The time of this Charm was expired in Ireland about some two months before
Youghall was surprised by the Inhabitants for the Commonwealth of England,
where Hind was wounded: as hereafter you shall hear in his Voyage to Ireland.

How Hind robbed a Captain upon Chaulk hill in Buckingham-Shire.
AFter a day or two, Hind rod into Buckingham Shire, where he was acquainted
with many Gentlemen: and passing away the time till his opportunity served: It
was his chance to ride toward Chaulk hill; Hind espied a little before him, a
Gentleman and his servant who were alighted to walk down the hill: The Captain
gives his horse to his man, and bids him stay at the Style till he came down:
the Captain having occasion to untruss a point, staid under a little hedge: Hind
watching his opportunity, rid softly till he came near the Captain, and seeing
him in good clothes, rid hastily up to him, and bid him, Deliver: The Captain
was amazed at this present action of Hind, who all this while held a Pistol at
his breast: Hind bids him dispatch; for it is not my custom said he, to stand
manding; but I demand, and look you make no longer stay: the Captain desired
him to forbear: till he was trust up: Hind giving him so much leave, said, your
money Sir. The Captain seeing it could not be helped by delays, delivers him
thirty pieces of gold: Hind said, Sir, I take this in part, I shall not be too
mercenary upon you at this time: and so he rod down the hill where the Captains
man staid with his Masters horse: Hind said, Sir, is that your Master on the
hill: he answers him, yes Sir: then said Hind, I seldom take any thing from the
Master, but I give the servant something. He gives him ten shillings.
here is somewhat for thee to drink my health: prithee tell thy Master, my name
is Hind.

How Hind robbed a Gentleman of one hundred and fifty pounds, near Nottingham.
HIND traveling up and down at last met with a lusty young fellow whom he had
formerly known: and asking him many questions, among the rest: said, Jack, If
thou You may guess that he was well bred.
Wilt live with me thou shall have money at command or any thing you want, Jack
knowing partly his trade, gave consent; Hind presently bought a good horse for
his man; and furnished him with Clothes, a sword, and small pistols: being well
fixed away they travel toward Nottingham; and as they rod they chanced to come
into an Inn, where a Gentleman and his man were newly come before them: Hind
rides to the stable door, where the Hostler was a taking of the other
Gentleman's portmantle, the Hostler said, it is but a little pormantle, but it
is very heavy: Hind, well eying it said to his man: Jack, enquire cuningly
which way this Gentleman travels to morrow: So Hind went in: and when supper
was ready, they went to supper together: after the Gentlemen had supped the
servants fell too: and Hinds man gives the other Gentleman's servant a pint of
Sack: and after supper Jack gives him some Spanish Tobaco, and now they begin
to be great acquaintance; so they go together into the stable to see their
Horses dressed: Jack asked the Gentleman's servant, which way they rod in the
morning, he told him toward London, my Master, said Jack, rides that way too,
I think, now Jack having as much as he desires, went to see what his master
wanted: Hind bids his man get his slippers ready, and pull off his boots: which
being done he takes his leave of the Gentleman, and goes to bed: when he came
into his Chamber, he asked his man which way they went: Jack tells him: In the
morning Hind rides first: but the Gentleman stays to eat his breakfast: after
he had done he rod on his journey, and riding by a wood where Hind and his man
lay in ambush for them: Hind rides out to the Gentleman, and with his Cane
slaps him over the pate: saying, have I nothing to do but to wait on you: Jack,
takes his Portmantle off: master, it is heaheavy: Sir, said Hind to the
Gentleman, you are ill beloved in the Country that you cannot get gold for your
silver: Jack rides back to the Gentleman's servant and strik^s him over the
pate, saying, You Rogue, must I spoil my horse to carry your Portmantle; Jack
strikes him again.
must I, must I, you Rogue.

Hind and his man rid away; leaving the Gentleman and his servant: looking one
upon another, almost amassed at this sudden accident; the Gentleman at the last
cheers up himself, and says to his man; I was robbed between sun and sun,
therefore the Country must pay me again: so they ride back to make their
redresses: where we leave them to get their money if they can.

Hind and his man spared no horseflesh till they were far enough from the
Gentleman: for they rid all the by ways, that it had been hard for any one to
follow them; being at a place, where he knew himself safe, he looked in his
Portmantle, where he found one hundred and fifty pounds. He leaving his man at
this place; went himself into Glocestershire, where he met with a Farmer, and
had good sport with him, and at last got his money.

How Hind robbed a Farmer.
HIND riding between Gloucester and Tewxbery overtook a Country-Farmer, who had
money about him, to whom Hind had some discourse, and as they were riding; Hind
showed him one of the States twenty shilling pieces, asking him, how he liked
it: the Country Farmer replied, it is a very fair piece, I would I had one to
carry home with me: If you please, Sir, I will give you one and twenty for it;
Sir, said Hind, being you are desirous of it, you shall have it; the Countryman
pulled out his long purse, and told out one and twenty shillings and gave Hind;
so Hind gave him the piece of gold, saying, do not put it among your silver,
for it will wast the gold: well, said the Country man, I Will put it in my little
pocket then in a paper to keep it; Hind, seeing his purse, longed like a woman
with child till he had it: said to the Farmer Sir, I want a little silver to
buy a commodity that I have use for: nay, said the Country man you shall have
your gold again: the old saying is true, one may buy gold to dear: Hind said,
tell me not of old stories, but give me your money, for I will have it by fair
means or foul: nay, said the Country man I will not fight, but if you have it,
I Will go to law with you, if there be any law in England: Hind told him, that he
cared more for the Lawyers, then the law it self: and would be glad to meet
them any where: your money, your money, said Hind, I do not use to stay so long
for so little money: the Farmer pulls his purse out, as if all the wealth of
There was but ten pound in the purse.
Presto John or of the Indies had lain in it: but Hind receiving the purse
made light of it, saying, this is an ill days work, but I will make it better
before night: If God send you good luck said the Farmer, I hope you will give
me my money again: yes, yes, said Hind, and many thanks; then I suppose said
the Farmer you are no common thief, but one that will pay what you borrow: Hind
asked him where he lived, that he might come and pay him: the Farmer told him,
and so Hind parted from him: the Farmer went home thinking Hind would come and
pay him his money again: showing all his neighbors his new gold, and told one
of his neighbors how he was served: his neighbor said, you may hang him if
you will; No, no, said the Farmer, I will not hang him because he let me have
his gold so willingly.

How he jested with a Butcher that was his friend.
HIND riding near Chippingnorton, met with a friend and acquaintance of his;
but Hind being in a disguise of false hair and a false beard: would not make
him acquainted who he was: but bid him stand and deliver such money as he had,
the Butcher said, You come in an ill time, for I have newly paid away all my
money; but I have six shilling left, if that will serve your turn you shall
have it: Hind said, any money: for, I am like an Angler that must refuse no
bite: for I may as well catch a fry, as a great fish. Hind having his money rod
a little way, and pulled of his disguise and returned to his friend; and said,
how easy it is to deceive an honest man: Hind gives him his six shillings
again; and gave him also a twenty shillings piece to buy him a pair of gloves:
after a little discourse they parted.

How Hind served two Bailiffs and a Usurer:
HIND riding through a little Town in Warwickshire, saw a tumult in the street;
so he rid up to them, and desired to know the occasion; one told him that an
honest Innkeeper was arrested for twenty pounds, and that the man was undone if
he had not some relief speedily; So Hind asked the man if he would give him any
security, if he should pay the money for him; the poor man being overjoyed for
this unlooked for news: told him he would make over all he had for the
security; so Hind had the Usurer and the Bailiffs into the house, Hind desired
the bond, paid the Usurer all he demanded: giving the Bailiffs their Fees, and
Cancelled the bond: Hind sent for one to make over the Inkeepers goods to
himself, which being done, they departed: Hind being not unmindful to enquire
of the Usurers way he was to go; went after him, and said, friend, I lent you
twenty pounds: but I must have it again; the Usurer said, you paid me so much
money on a bond; Hind said, it is no time to dispute it now: so Hind took from
the old Usurer, his twenty pound, and twenty pound more which he had got by his
Usury: so Hind rod back to the Inn, and gave the Host his writing again, and
five pounds, and told him, that he had good luck by lending his money to honest
men, the Usurer came after to the Inkeeper thinking to get some money of him:
but the Inkeepeer fell upon the Usurer and did beat him almost to death:
saying, you rogue, I am engaged in all that I have for the payment of the
money, and if you be robbed, shall I pay you. I will, I will. so this was all
the Usurer got by Hind.

How Hind fought with a Gentleman, and after gave him his money again.
HInd Prauncing the road in Yorkshire, by chance overtook a Gentleman and his
servant; which Gentleman was riding to London to pay his Composition: This
Gentleman had sent most part of his mone^ to London by Bills of Exchange: yet
his man was forced to carry one hundred pounds behind him in a Port-mantle:
Hind riding by, asked the Gentleman many odd questions, and among the rest he
said, Sir, I am a Gentleman, and since I came from my house I have bin an He
said true.
ill husband: now I am in want, and should desire you to lend me some money:
Sir, said the Gentleman, you are but a stranger to me: and I have no reason to
part with money to any upon so little acquaintance; but rather then you should
be disgraced on the road, I shall lend you twenty sh^llings: Sir, said Hind, I
thank you for your love; but I care not for such small sums, when there is
greater in the He points to the port-mantle.
place: The Gentleman quickly understood his meaning; and said, Sir, you must
fight for it if you have it: with all my heart, said Hind: and you shall not
fight for nothing; for I will stake my horse to one hundred pounds: and thus it
shall be, whosoever draws the first blood, shall have all; and if you win my
horse, you shall give me; your man's to ride on; and if you lose your money, I
will give you ten pound out of it toward your Charges: to this the Gentleman
agrees: they ride out of the way about a flight shot, where Hind ties his horse
to a hedge, and the Gentleman gives his horse to his man to hold: now they draw,
and at the first pass, Hind ran the Gentleman into the sword-arm; the wound was
but slight; yet being their Engagement was such, the Gentleman's man yielded
Hind the Victory; Hind receives the He give him 10l. back.
hundred pound of the Gentleman: and so they mount their horses: Hind being of
a Noble spirit, said, Sir, we must not part thus, I will give you a very good
dinner if you please to accept of it; the Gentleman thankt him, and rod with
him; and as they were riding, Hind asked the Gentleman whether he was
traveling; the Gentleman said, to London; I am going to pay my Composition;
Smites his hand on his breast.
I wish I had no occasion there: Alas poor Gentleman said Hind, you have sorrow
enough, and it has been my ill fortune to augment it, He gives the Gentleman's
servant the money again
ask now any thing that lies in my power, and you shall command it: Sir said
the Gentleman, I shall desire nothing more then your He did but Complement to
Hind.
friendship, which I shall value above any earthly thing: I am beholding to you
for your care of me: for if I had lost this hundred pounds, I had been undon;
being nigh the place, it broke off their discourse. Hind be speaks the best
provision that can be got, and then sends for a Surgeon to dress the
Gentleman; which being done, they fell to the victuals, and made themselves
merry with many odd jests; when they had reposed themselves a while, Hind paid
the reckoning privately, and came in to the Gentleman, and said, Sir, you are
the first man that ever I hurt on the road, and I am heartily glad there was no
more harm: so giving the Gentleman a word to pass all highway-men, called for
his horse, and bid him farewell.

How Hind was made a Captain at Colchester.
WHen the Rising was in Kent and Essex, Hind was among them: being beloved of
many wild Gentlemen, who still called him Captain at every word; Hind said,
Gentlemen, you call me Captain; but I will desire you to call me so no more,
till I am one, or may deserve it: the Gentlemen said, we will speak to Sir
William Compton, who wants a Captain in his Regiment of foot: they all go to
Sir William Compton, who knowing Hind, since he was wont to borrow his horse,
to do many mad pranks: forgave him all that was on the old score, and began a
new one with him, giving him a Commission for to be a Captain; Hind being in
Command, swagred at no small rate, he still having a mind to his old trade of
taking, and uses it for recreation sometimes; but when the Lord General Fairfax
besieged Colchester and took it, Hind was in a maze; but being then guided by
his Art, escaped in Seamans apparel on foot: and afterward got himself a horse
by a very pretty Conceit, as in the next Chapter you shall hear.

How Hind got a gallant horse, having spoiled his own by an unfortunate leap.
HIND being a Gentleman's house, where he was well entertained, after dinner he
would show them some sport, with his horse: thy young Gentlemen being desirous
to see it: got their horses sadled, and rid with him; he leaped many places,
and shows them many fine tricks, but by chance, leaping over a gate that was
very high, insomuch, that the horse strained his back, that Hind durst not ride
him on a desperate design: so taking his leave of the Gentlemen, he rod to
Sturbride fair, where he saw a Gallant Horse, which was to be sold: Hind being
on his own horse, asked what the price of that horse was; the Horsecourser that
was to sell him, said, fourscore pound is his price: Hind, said, ride him
along: the man rod him well; but Hind had a mind to use him better: and said
to the Horsecourser; I prithee put my saddle on the horse: that I may try him:
He did so, and held Hinds horse: which to sight was as good as the other: Hind
rid the horse a little way and trotted him back, and asked the Horsecourser,
whether he he had a good Gallop; yes, Sir, said he, Gallop him and try: Hind
gallopt him so far, that he returned no more: leaving his horse with the
Horsecourser, to make the best use of him: which once was better, but now may
lie on his hands: Hind being well horsed, rod till he came to a place: where
some of his Companions stayed for him: but when he come to the place, they were
extreme glad to see him so well mounted: they presently asked him, how he came
by this brave horse, and what he gave for him: He answers them thus: Gentlemen,
how long shall I tutor you; will you never understand this; to deceive the
deceiver is no deceit? I had him of the Horsecourser at an easy rate: whereat
they fell a laughing at the conceit: and so mounting their horses, away they
ride together.

How Hind robbed a Gentleman in Yorkshire, and afterward came to the Inn where
he lay to sup with him, but did not.
A Gentleman coming from York, intended his journey for London, but by accident
met with Hind; who soon made him deliver what money he had. Hind gives him back
twenty shillings to bear his charges, till his credit would furnish him again;
so the Gentleman rode on his journey to the next Town, where he was well known
by an Inkeeper; there being alighted from his horse, desires the Host to get
somewhat ready for his supper, so the Gentleman went to his Chamber; in the
mean time, in comes Hind, and asks, If there were any Gentlemen that went for
London; the Host answered, yes, There was one Gentleman alone, and he would he
glad of any good Company. So Hind went up to the Gentleman's Chamber and
saluted him: The Gentleman said, Sir, sit down, and I will tell you how I was
robbed to day, and I durst have sworn you had been the man, but that your He
wares a Periwigs sometimes.
hair is short, and his was long. Sir, said Hind, do you know his horse; yes
very well, said the Gentleman; To satisfy you, said Hind, you shall see mine:
So Hind went down and fetched his horse out of the Stable, and asked the
Gentleman, If that were the horse; he answered, I, I, that is the horse. Then,
Sir, said Hind, I cannot sup with you to night, if you know my Horse better
then my self. So he bids him good night.

How some of Hind's Companions robbed a Gentleman: and, how Hind met him, and
gave him money to bear his charges, and afterward met him in London, and paid
him the rest.
HIND and his Gang, riding merrily along, met accedentally with one of Hind's
friends, who was very glad to see Hind, and to have some private discourse with
him: Hind desired his Companions to ride before, and he would overtake them:
Hind and his friend went to a house hard by that place, where they might
disclose their minds to each other; the whilst his mad Gang rid on their
journey: where in the way they met a young Gentleman; these lads bid him stand,
and makes him deliver such money as he had, leaving very little to bear his
charges, and rod from him: the Gentleman kept on his way, and as he rod met
with Hind, who bid him Stand, and deliver: the Gentleman said, It was the last
thing I did: for four Gentlemen in such He describes their clothes.
habits met me and took all my money from me: Hind knowing they were his
Companions, said, did they leave thee any money: very little, said the
Gentleman: Sir, said Hind, I see you look but melancholy on the matter; deal
ingeniously with me, and tell me how much they had from you: In troth, Sir,
said the Gentleman, it were a folly for me to belly my own purse: they had about
twelve pounds from me: Hind pulls our five pieces of gold, and gives it the
Gentleman, saying, Sir, here is this in part, and when I meet you next, I will
give you the rest: the Gentleman giving him many thanks, would have parted from
him: Hind said I have one thing more to say to you; here are many wags abroad,
and they will have this money from you; therefore if you meet any; tell them
the Fiddler is paid, and they will let you pass: so Hind bid him farewell; the
Genteman had not rid far, but he met with some blades, who bid him stand;
Gentlemen said he the FIDDLER is paid: they being satisfied with this answer;
asked him which way the FIDDLER went: he giving them the best direction he
could, parted from them. Hind afterward met this Gentleman in London, and paid
him the rest of his money, and gave him a Dinner.

How Hind served a Committee man, who disguised himself for fear of robbing.
A Committee man having occasion to travel from Warwick toward London for to
buy many commodities, hearing that there was robbing in that road, fitted
himself with an old gary coat out at the elbowes, and an old mare, with boots
instead of stirrups, hung at a Saddle, that was not worth three pence, and a
bridle of the same price, now rides he merrily thinking no highway man would
set on him, but money ill got will be ill spent; for he chanced to meet with
Hind who asked what he was: he replied, that he was an old man going to get
relief among his friends: Hind gave him a piece in gold, and bid him drink his
health, and be merry at his Inn: the old miser thinking to please Hind, coined
two or three great oaths presently and said, he would be drunk with drinking
his health, so Hind parted from him, and the old man went to his Inn, and set
up his mare, then called for half a pint of Sack; and after the first glass was
down, he began to say, that he escaped the greatest danger that ever he was in;
for, said he, I met with Hind; and instead of robbing me, he gave me a piece in
gold; and bid me drink his health, but IN ll see him hanged before IN ll spend
one penny for his sake; hang him Rogue, he robs all honest men, only
Cavaliers, he lets them go: IN ll put his gold among my own: I would have given
ten pound to have been rid of him when first I met him; so after a short supper
went to bed. Hind came to the Inn, using to lie there, as a traveller not
known: the host was telling him in what fear an old Committee man was to day,
saying, he met with Hind, who gave him money to drink his health; but he said
he would see him hanged first, and called him rogue a thousand times: Hind went
to bed, and let the old man travel first in the morning, and about an hour
after, Hind rides after him: when he had overtaken him: he asked the old man,
if he drank his health; I, Sir, said he, I was never so drunk in my life, as I
was the last night; for I drank the Kings health, the Queens, the Princes, and
your health ten times over. Hind said unto him Friend, I have found you in many
lies: and now I will make you call me Rogue for something: So Hind made him unty
his greasy snapsack, where he sound fifty pound in gold, and his own piece
besides; now the Committee man to cheer up himself; resolved to borrow so much
money of the State before he went another journey. Hind said, the sooner you
get it, the more money I shall have.

How Hind borrowed money of a Tobacco-seller, who sold his Tobacco at Fairs,
and to great Inns, and afterward paid him.
HIND having some Companions with him more then he thought good, sent some of
them to seek their fortune by themselves, he only reserving two Gentlemen
wherein he put great confidence; but money growing short, he desired them to
accompany him, they being as willing to go, as he was to desire them: as they
were riding, Hind espies one riding between two Dossers on a good horse, says
to his Companions, I believe that this fellow has money, it is but trying said
Hind* they presently ride to him, and being far from any house, they ask him
for money, and tell him that money they will have: the fellow was amazed and
could not tell what to answer: they presently lead him out They saw people a
coming.
of the road, and pulls him off his horse, and riggs his dossers, where they
found nothing but Tobacco and pipes, and some aquavitae in a bottle: come, said
Hind, honest fellow will you give us a pipe of your Tobacco: yes, with all my
heart said he, and my They drink his Water, and take some Tobacco.

you will lend me but three or four pound, I will give you HIND courts him with
good words.

I have not much money, and that I have is my Masters; but rather then you
should take it from me by force, I will He was a cunning Knave.
lend you three pounds which I have hid about me: well said Hind, it shall be
sufficient: the poor fellow pulls off his hat, and in the crown thereof was his
money: Hind and his Comrades fell a laughing at this conceit, and said, we
might have looked long enough in the Dossers, and your money so safe: he
delivers Hind 3. pound, saying, I hope you will be honest, and then you shall
borrow another time: Hind thanks him, and appoints him a place to pay him.
After ten days Hind sent for this fellow to come to him, who presently came:
Hind gives him 5l. and his belly full of sack: Sir, said the fellow, I will
give you a pound of Spanish Tobaco* no do not go said Hind: I live but hard by,
at the Constables: said Hind, I never care to take any of their Tobacco: so
calling for his horse, rod away.

How Hind robbed two Captains that had received money to pay their Troops, and
after he had conveyed away the money, came back and robbed them of what money
they had about them.
TWo Captains, whose Troops lay then in Essex, had been to fetch money for the
payment of them a fortnights pay, having two Troopers and a spare horse with
them, whereon the Port-mantle lay which had the money* but they riding by
Havaring Park, heard many Gentlemen hollow; so they loving the sport, rid into
the Park, and commanded the Troopers to stay till they came back: Hind, as his
fortune was, came that way, and seeing a horse with a Port-mantle, did guess it
to be money by the close lying of it* asked what they stayed for, they said,
for their Captains; as they were in discourse, the Deer and Dogs ran by, which
took the Troopers Eyes off their Charge: the while Hind with his Dagger-knife
cuts the male-girts, and takes the Port-mantle and lays before him, and rides
away; but when he was just setting spurs to his horse* one of the Troopers
cries out, The Port-mantle's gone, The Port-mantle's gone: The Captains being
amazed at this news, rod after Hind; but he had delivered up his Treasure to
His Companions waited his coming.
those that stood ready for it; and returned a little way, where he espies only
the two Captains coming, who rod at him a tilt; but he knowing how to save one,
shund their first encounter, and out-rid them again; the Captains followed him
hard; at last he turned short and came in the rear of one of them, and pulled him
by his long Belt, that he made him lie on the ground, and the fall so much
amazed him, that he could not rise to catch his horse: Hind was presently up
with the other, and was so rough with him, that he cried, Quarter: Hind feels
his pocket, where was a very fine watch and ten pieces of gold: Hind cuts his
bridle and girts, and turns his horse going, and presently went to the other,
who as yet, was scarce in his senses; yet delivers Hind such money as he had:
the Troopers by this time were come up: but their horses were so tired that
they, could gallop no longer: Hind flung them twenty shillings to drink, and
bid them farwell.

How Hind neatly robbed a Parson of forty pounds in gold, which he had hid in
the Collar of his Doublet; after he was robbed of all his silver the day before.
A Parson riding from Coventry toward London, by petty thieves was robbed of
his Silver: but having forty pounds in gold about him resolved to go on his
journey: and as he rode, Hind overtook him, and asked the Parson which way he
traveled: the Parson told him that he intended for London: but I was almost
prevented, for to day I was robbed of five pounds in silver, and the knaves
left me but five shillings. Sir, said He tells him a lie.
Hind, I was robbed of a little silver to day also: for a man were as good let
them have it quietly, as endanger ones life to resist; but I was cunning enough
to hide my gold in my boots, before I met them: nay, I believe, said the
Parson, that mine is as safe; for I have quilted it in the Collar of my Dublet:
Hind was not a little glad when he heard where his gold lay: but being near
their Inn, they supt together, and went to bed; in the morning the Parson
called He had been better have let him sleep.
Hind up, and told him, he would be glad of his Company: after breakfast they
rid together; Hind asked the Parson if he could guess what trade he was; no
said the Parson: then said Hind, I am a Cutter: for I must cut the Collar of
your Doublet off, before I shall come to your money: having so done, he left
the Parson forty pounds lighter, then he found him.

Stand and Deliver! Next in order comes;
Quickly your Money? Make no stay at all?
For my aim's High, and at those Greater sums,
The Lesser lead to Tyburn's Funeral.
Here Is all the difference as it is manifest;
I got their Money, They received a Jest.


How Hind robbed two Lawyers.
TWO Lawyers that had got money enough in their Circuit, were resolved to
return to London: and now being on their way, Hind overtakes them: and asks
them which way they were traveling: they told him, to London: I go there too
said Hind: we three may make a fine Company, for we may travel as He faigns
himself a good husband.
cheap as two; but as they were riding, the two Lawyers disputed much on points
of the Law: Hind being almost dulled with their Discourse, said, Gentlemen,
what point of the Law will you give for this; suppose I take both your moneys
from you, and give each of you a small ring in lieu of it. One of the Lawyers
said, it does weaken the Law much; but because we are two, and you but one, we
may hang you: said Hind, In troth I will try the title: so having a Pistol
ready; made them deliver their money, and gave each of them a ring, and bid
them incite him if they would: they said, to much purpose, and you will never
come: God be with you, said he.

How Hind overtook a Hop Merchant, being informed before that he had received
money, and what happened.
A Hope-Merchant having sent many bags of hops to a fair in Oxford shire made a
good market, and received much money there, came to an Inn where Hind by chance
lay: the Merchant delivers his money to the Master of the house; and desires
him to lay it up till he had occasion for it: the Chamberlain of the house
being acquainted with Hind: told him, that there was a Merchant that had
brought good store of money into the Inn, and does intend his journey for
London: Hind hoping it would prove a booty for him: staid till the Merchant was
ready to take his journey: but it fell out otherwise, for the Merchant turned
his money into such vendable Commodities, as he thought most convenient: so he
took with him some three pounds, his journey being not long: now he causes his
horse to be sadled, and the Pillion for his wife to ride behind him, who was at
her Fathers house not far from that place: Hind being gone before some three or
four miles: staid his coming: which was not long before the Merchant and his
wife came riding: Hind rid up to him, saying, Sir, I am informed you carry a
good sum of money with you, and I must have some. Sir, said the Merchant, I
confess I had so much money to day; but I have made a return of it to London:
But if you please to accept of this, you shall have it: Sir, said Pulling out
of his pocket about sixteen shillings.
Hind: I should disgrace my self, if I should rob you of so little money:
therefore if you will lend me five shillings of this mouey, I shall thank you:
then giving the Merchant the rest of the money: said, Sir, I do but borrow this
money of you: If you do but go to such a place, near White-Fryers, and tell
them, that James Hind sent you, you shall have your money again. Sir, said the
Merchant, I live at the Anchor and Grown at Billings-gate: Sir, said Hind, if
you live there, I must eat no Oysters at Billings-gate this year: So riding a
cross way bid him farewell.

How Hind robbed a Gentleman in Hide-Park.
HIND being well horsed, went one Evening into Hide-Park to see some sport; and
riding up and down the Park by the Coaches, spies a bag of money by a
Gentleman, to whom Hind used some discourse about the race that was to be ran;
but the race beginning, the Gentleman caused his Coach to stand still, that he
might judge which horse ran best: Hind's head being not idle, rod to the Coach,
and took the bag in his hand, and rod away; the Gentleman presently missing his
money, cries out, stay him, stay him, I am robbed: many rod after him,
especially the Captain whom he robbed at Chalkhil, who pursued him hard. Hind
riding by St. James's, said to the Soldiers, I have won the wager: but holding
his bag fast, his cloak fell off, which he left for them that came next: he
riding the way by So-ho left them: but when he came to his companions, said, he
never earned a hundred pound so dear in his life.

His voyage into Holland, and from thence to Ireland.
ABOUT a fortnight after he was pursued by Captain Evans, and other Gentlemen
near Hide-Park: he thought it not safe to stay in England: shipped himself for
Holland, and landed at the Hague: after he had been there three or four days,
he saw it no place for him: shipped himself in a vessel that carried the Scotch
King's goods, and landed in that vessel at Galloway; when he had acquainted
himself with some English Gentlemen, they advise him to go to Ormond: who
hearing of his fame in England; entertained him very civilly, and made him
Corporal to his Life-gaurd: being now in employment, he got many mad-lads
together and did many robberies with authority: but chiefly this of
Castle-haven, whom he robbed of fiftteen hundred pounds, and delivered it to
Ormond, who rewarded him and his Comrades well for their pains: he robbed many
Irish Merchants, and other Gentlemen, with other things of great consequence:
afterward he went to Youghall, where he merrily spent his time, till Prince
Rupert went thence: having money enough which he lightly got, furnished himself
with many brave horses, thinking to keep open trade; but it fortuned otherwise:
the Garrison being but slightly guarded, the inhabitants surprised it for the
Parliament: Hind being in the tumult was sorely wounded in both hands with
Halberts: but getting into a vessel that then went to Duncanon, staid there
till his wounds were cured: but the plague growing hot at Duncanon; he again
embarked himself for the Isle of Scilly; where he did many tricks, staying
there eight months, came to the Isle of Man, where he found some work to do,
as shall be related to you in the Chapter following.

How Hind lived in the Isle of Man.
HIND came in a small vessel from Scilly to the Isle of Man, were he presented
himself to the Earl of Darby: who hearing of many of his merrypranks, made him
welcome: allowing him a certain stipend weekly: the Earl often times would send
for him, to hear some of his merry jests; and being often in the Earls Company,
grew much in his favor: and taking that for a cloak; did much view the Island
to see if there were any hope to use his trade; he had not been there much
above three weeks before he had robbed six or seven eminent men of that Isle:
this was novelties to that people, who before he came there, might have rid or
gone round that Isle, with a bag of money in one hand and a switch in the other
without fear or danger of losing it: this strange report came to the Earls ear;
who presently sent for Hind: In the mean time the Earl told Sir Philip
Musgrave, that he suspected none but Hind to do the feat there: Sir Philip
said, my Lord there are many strange Gentlemen in the Island, do not judge
raishly of Captain Hind, he carries himself very civilly here; but I confess he
is a likely man to do such things. Hind in the interim came in, which broke off
their discourse; my Lord and Sir Philip* desired him to deal ingeniously with
them, and tell them the truth, whether he did those robberies or no: Hind being
apt to blush, yet spoke smartly, I protest my Lord, your honors tell me news:
If any of your Island can say, and swear I robbed them, I will suffer your law:
the Earl said, Captain Hind, you are the only man suspected; and the men who
were robbed are now in the Castle, the Earl sent for the Gentlemen, who came
presently: he asked them all, if they knew the man who robbed them; they said,
very well. The Earl said, pointing to Hind, is he like this Gentleman, they
answered, no; for he had long black hair, and a great beard (this was a
disguise which he wore: but those people did not use to see periwigs nor false
beards) then the Earl said to the Gentlemen that he would do his best endeavor
to find the man by laying wait at all Seaports, and causing searches to be
made; so the Gentlemen departed; when they were gone, he said to Hind, Sir, I
am sorry if I have accused you wrongfully: deal ingeniously with me, and I will
give you a sum of money, and give you under my hand not to do you the least
injury: which being done: Hind went to his loding, and fetch the Periwig and
false beard; whereat the Earl and Sir Philip fell into a great laughter: nay,
said Hind, let them laugh that win; so he laughed too.

How Hind came to the Isle of Man; and went thence into Scotland to the Scotch
King to Sterling.
AFTER Hind had staid in the Isle of Man thirteen weeks; he began to be weary
of the place, because he had not room enough to range about; so he shipped
himself for Scotland; when he was landed there, he went to the King at
Sterling: the King being informed who he was, had some discourse with him, and
commended him to the Duke of Buckingham, then present; to ride in his troop,
because his lifeguard was full: He came into England with the same troop; was
in the engagement at Warrington, he continued still in the same capacity, and
came to the fight at Worcester, and staid till the King was fled: then every
one shifted for themselves: Hind being in the City saw the gates full of flying
persons: he leapt over the wall on foot by himself only, traveled the Country
and lay three days under bushes and hedges, because of the Soldiery,
afterward came to Sir John Patkingtons woods, where he lay five days; and
from thence came on foot to London, by the name of Brown, and lodged five weeks
in London.

The true Relation of the taking of Captain James Hind in London.
Upon the 9. of November 1651. a discovery was made of Captain Hind's
frequenting one Denzys, a Barber over against St. Dunstans Church in
Fleet Street; he having lodged three weeks before by the name of Brown; this
information was communicated to certain Gentlemen belonging to the right
honorable Mr. Speaker, who with great care and privacy, so ordered the
business, that there was not the least suspicion, until they came to the
Chamber door, which they forced open, and immediately entered with their
pistols cockt, which attempt did not a little amaze Hind; being so suddenly
awaked out of his sleep, for not above an hour before he had betaken himself to
rest (being not very well) as he conceived in security, but it proved
otherwise: for one, who had formerly been in the Army, and of his intimate
acquaintance, discovered him, and went along with the Guard that was appointed
to secure him, who no sooner was apprehended, but immediately they hasted him
to Mr. Speakers house, in Chancery Lane, where they secured him for that night.

The next day (being Monday) by order from the Right Honorable the Council of
State, the said Captain Hind was brought to White Hall; where he was examined
before a Committee, and diverse questions put to him, in relation to his late
engagement with Charles Stuart; and whether he was the man that accompanied the
Scotch King for the furtherance of his escape.

To which Hind answered, That he never saw the King, since the fight at
Worcester, neither did he know of his getting off the Field; but he was now
glad to hear he had made so happy an escape.

After some time was spent in taking of his Examination, it was ordered that he
should be sent prisoner to the Gate House, till the further pleasure of the
Council of State was known therein; which accordingly was done: the said Hind
was guarded with four Files of musketeers to the Gate House, where he remained
in safe Custody that night.

The next day being Tuesday, he was brought back from thence, (by special order
from the Council of Sat) to Newgate: and accordingly was brought in a Coach
with iron bolts on his legs: Captain Compton and two other Messengers belonging
to the Council to guard him: and about two of the clock in the afternoon they
brought him to Newgate; where Captain Compton showed the Master of the Prison
an Order from the Council for his commitment, and also close imprisonment, and
to let no persons whatsoever to have access to him; this order was accordingly
observed: but during the time that the Hole was preparing for him, and the
Soldiers which lay there removed to another place: diverse persons frequenting
the place to see him, asked him many questions, to whom he returned very civil
and mild answers: Among the rest, a Gentleman born in the same Town, viz.
Chippingnorton: who took acquaintance of him, and saluting him, said; truly,
Countryman, I am sorry to see you here; he answered, that imprisonment was a
comfort to him: in suffering for so good and just a cause, as adhering to the
King. His Countryman said, to morrow I shall return home; and if you have any
thing to recommend to your wife, or friends, I will communicate it: I thank you
Sir, said Hind; pray remember my love to them all, and satisfy them, that
although I never see them more in this world, yet, in the world to come, I hope
we shall meet in glory: then the Gentleman took a glass of bear and drank to
him, which he pledged about half: and filling up his glass, said, come taking
the Gentleman by the hand, here is a health to my Master the King: and God
bless and preserve his Majesty; but the Gentleman refusing to drink the same
upon such an account: moved Hind to passion; who said, the Devil take all
Traitors; Had I a thousand lives and at liberty I would adventure them all for
King Charles: a pox take all turn coats: Forbear, Sir, said the Keepers, and
be not in Passion: not in the least said he, I am free from it.

His Speech at Newgate.
His time being short, spoke as follows*
Well Gentlemen:
THIS is all I have to say to you before I go into the Dungeon, for so may I
term the place whereto I am going; I would have all men true to their
Principles, and those that have laid a foundation for their King, let them
endeavor to raise it, and those that are on the contrary Party, let them,
endeavor to demolish it: As for my part I had not been here now, if there had
not been a Judas abroad; for indeed I was betrayed by one who formerly served
the King; but now he is for you: (which when he uttered, he pointed to a
Captain that was present) but God forgive him: the Keeper of the Prison, called
him from the fire side to the window, and looked upon the iron shakels that
were about his legs, to see whether they were in order: well, said Captain
Hind, all this I vallew not three pence: I owe a debt to God; and a debt I must
pay. Blessed be his name, that he has kept me from shedding of blood unjustly;
which is now a great comfort to me, neither did I wrong any poor man of the
worth of a penny; but I must confess, I have (when I have been necessitated
thereto) made bold with a rich Bompkin, or a lying Lawyer, whose full fed fees
from the rich Farmer, does too too much impoverish the poor Cottage keeper: but
truly, I could wish, that thing were as little used in England among Lawyers;
as the eating of Swines-flesh was among the Jews: the expression caused much
laughter; and many such witty gingles he often put forth: another Gentleman
standing by: said, I, Captain, you are not brought hither for robbing but for
Treason: Treason, replied Hind, I am not guilty in the least; yes, Sir, but you
are, for complying with Charles Stuart, and engaging against the Commonwealth
of England: Alas, Sir, it seems, that is enough to hang me: I am afraid, you
will find it so, replied the Gentleman: well, Gods will be done, said Hind; I
vallew it not three pence to lose my life in so good a cause; and if it were to
do again, I protest, I would do the like; laying his hand on his breast: Come,
said the Keeper, no more of this discourse; clear the Room: so he went with the
Keeper to the place appointed for him.

The humble Petition of James Hind, to the Right Honorable the Council of
State; and their proceedings thereupon.
SHOWS,
THAT whereas your Petitioner (close Prisoner in Newgate) is unfaignedly
sorrowful for all his late miscarriages, whether testified again him, or
acknowledged by him; and that upon earnest seeking of God, and inquiring into
his Will, your Petitioner is convinced of his former misdemeanors and actings;
but yet remains under the heavy Yoke of Irons and Bondage.

May it therefore please this Honorable Council to take these Premises into
your gracious consideration; and to vouchsafe your Christian favor and
clemency to your poor Supplicant, for the setting of him free from this
intolerable Iron Yoke; for the granting of his friends access unto him; and
for the reducing of him from the bare boods, to a more Christian-like
Condition:

And your Petitioner shall ever pray, etc.

Behold! at last, the saddest sight of all;
Poor Hind! Now in the Hole at Newgate lies:
His Wife and Father, both lament his Thrall,
And are much troubled at his Miseries.
His Book and Candle, his Companions be;
Though now in Chains, he hopes for Liberty.


The discourse between his Father, His Wife, and himfelf, in Newgate, the 28.
of November.
HIND's Father hearing of his Sons misfortune, came to London; and brought his
Sons Wife with him: but there being such strict orders that none should go to
him, his Father, and his Wife could not be admitted to see him: but lodging at
one of the Keepers houses, the next day was brougt to him: the good Old man
with tears in his eyes began to behold his Son, who was kneeling at his Fathers
feet; but was scarce able to rise for the wait of Irons that was on his legs:
but being helped by his Father, arose, and wen^ to his Wife, who stood wringing
her hands, to see her Husband in that misery: She taking him about the neck,
The old man weeps.
wept to see him, kissing him a thousand times; after they had discoursed a
while: His Father, speaks as follows.

Son, I hope it is not too late to give you counsel: but I wish to God you had
taken my former counsel, and then I might not have come here to see you; you do
not think how much it goes to my heart, and all your friends to think what will
become of you.

Father, I hope the Lord will look upon a sinner that truly repents, and is
sorry from the bottom of his heart for his offenses: and I make no doubt, but
that the State, will have as much mercy on me, as ever the late King had on
Clavil; who was far more in danger then I am now.

Son, Clavil was a great scoller, and had many friends.
Son, Be not too confident; for when a ship is cast away by bulging on rocks
that are near the shore; those that can swim may be saved, but those that
cannot must take their fortune. Meaning his reviling speaks in passion.
Even so it is with you: For friends that should stir in your business, I have
none; and that which should do you most good, does you the most injury: I shall
desire you upon my blessing to bridle your speech, and let not envy be in your
heart to any one: let not this counsel be like water spilt upon the ground, but
make use of it for the best.

Father, I shall by the help of God follow your advice: and I desire the world
not to look back on my actions; but forward, and they shall find me an altered
man.

Husband, I would once more you were at liberty, that I might see this change,
which would make both soul and body happy.

The Keeper having occasion to be gone, desired them to depart for that time:
so taking their leave of him, they went to their lodging.

The Trial of Captain James Hind, in the Old Bayley with his Examination, and
Confession.
ON Friday the 12. of December 1651: About two of the Clock in the afternoon,
Captain James Hind was brought to the Bar, before the Honorable Court at the
Sessions in the Old Bailey: being brought with four Keepers to the Bar: diverse
Questions were proposed to him, which he very mildly answered: the Recorder
asked him, what Countryman he was, and where he was born: He replied, at the
merry Town of Chipping-Norton in Oxfordshire: then it was demanded of him,
whether he accompanied the Scottish King into England; and whether he was at the
fight at Worcester: He answered, that he came into England with his Majesty the
King; and that he was not only at the fight at Worcester, but at Warrington
also, wishing that it had been his happy fortune there to have ended his days.

Then some farther questions were proposed to him, in relation to his Mad
Pranks: To which he answered, that what he confessed before the Council of
State, the like he acknowledged to that Honorable Court: protesting his
innocence in any matter of Fact or Crime, since the year 1649. within any of
the Parliaments Dominions. He stands indicted upon high Treason, by the Council
of State, and thereupon the Court made no farther progress against him; by
reason that no bill of indictment was brought in; so he was ordered to be
remanded back to the place from whence he was brought: The time he was at the
Bar, he deported himself with undaunted courage, yet with a smiling
Countenance: but before his departure, this is observable; that as he passed
from the Bar, casting his head on one side, and looking as it were over the
left shoulder: said, these are filthy gingling spurs; (meaning his irons about
his legs) but I hope to have them exchanged ere long; which expression caused
much laughter. As he passed up the Old Bayley toward Newgate, diverse people
resorted to see him; who asked if he had received sentence: which words Captain
Hind hearing, faced to the left, and smiling, said, no, no, good people, there
is no have to hang true folk.

BEING now come to Newgate, many Gentlemen were there to see him, and to ask
him some questions: Captain Hind having a little time now more then ordinary,
before he went to his old lodging: said, Gentlemen, what is your will with me,
I know you long to hear news: they desired to know how he came off at the
Sessions: he pulling a chair, said, I stand but in little ease therefore I will
first sit down: then calling for a glass of Sack drank to them all* saying,
Gentlemen, I was somewhat dry with talking: therefore give me the other glass:
having drank his Sack, said, Gentlemen, It seems that to my enemies I have been
civil; there being no bill found against me, the Honorable Court only asked my
name, and some other questions; which I answered, not seeing any one that would
accuse me: neither could I spy, no, not so much, as the face of a Thief
catcher; (who would if they knew how (not for their conscience sake; nor out of
love to the Commonwealth) Hang me) but for the lucre of the ten pounds which
is the reward; which will make them swallow a false oath as easily, as one
would do buttered fish: but I have nothing to do with them, nor never had; so I
leave them to follow the rest of their Company, which as soon as they have
oppertunity, will let no time slip to help one another to the Gallows. His
Father and his Wife came into the Room, which broke of his discourse: so for
the present taking his leave of the Gentlemen, went with his Father into his
own Room, where he lay; being by themselves, his Father said to him, Son; How
much are you bound to God for your good fortune, you see many poor men here
condemned, who have not been so noted as you have been, I make no doubt but God
has a blessing in store for you; and it is my desire as a Father to see his
child do well: So I hope thou will not forget my Council, but daily meditate on
things for thy Soul, and then thou shall be happy.

His Wise then rejoicing to see him take his imprisonment so patiently: said
Dear heart, I shall visit you often, but it is my grief that I come to a Prison
to you; but I hope you shall be released of your misery, and live once more
with me: His Father said, Son, my occasion calls me home, and I shall do you
little good in staying here; I shall take my leave of you: now giving him his
blessing, bids him fare-wel; wishing him to serve God, who would not cast away
a sinner that does truly repent: His Wife with tears in her eyes gave him a
parting Salute; which made the stout Captain answer the same in the like
nature; wishing he were at liberty to have gone with them: but he still relying
on the mercy of the Parliament; made no doubt, but to visit his friends, before
they came to visit him again; but as yet he lies in Newgate in hopes of a
Release.
