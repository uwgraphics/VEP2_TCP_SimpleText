London ss.
WHereas the Lord General has received a message from the Committee for the
Admiralty, to recommend unto me how some good quantity of old Linen may be
gotten and made ready to be speedily sent to the seacoast, for the dressing of
the wounds of the soldiers who were wounded in the late Engagement at Sea;
which his excellency by his letter has done accordingly: These are therefore
earnestly to desire you that on the next Lords day you do publish and make
known, the same in your respective Congregations, and that the Churchwardens
of the several Parishes do take notice thereof, and do forthwith repair to the
houses of the several inhabitants within the same Parishes, and receive and
take into their custody all such linen as well disposed people shall give for
the purpose aforesaid, and to let them know that some trusty Persons will be
appointed for the receiving of such linen from the Churchwardens as they
shall gather and get ready, and will send and dispose of the same to the use of
the wounded Soldiers; And hereof I desire your and their care and furtherance
herein, it being a work so pious and charitable,

Dated this 6 of August 1653. John Fowke Mayor.

To the Ministers and Churchwardens of the several Parishes within the City
of London, and Liberties thereof.
