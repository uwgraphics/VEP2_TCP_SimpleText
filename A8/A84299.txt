An Exposition of the Brownists Paternoster.
Bless us good Lord from that dull Sect, that say
We err in twice repeating when we pray,

They think themselves made of a purer clod,
And give us ^ost, forbid it, O my God.

By them Barnes. Stables or what Rooms you see
More then our Churches are esteemd to be.
Hallowed
The Word, the Word, they cry by them is teached;
But grant, good God by better Scholars Preached:
Be thy Name,
The way, next Faith, I am addressed to go,
Is Prayer, surely which must lead me too
Thy Kingdom
Yet least our Bells Ring out, they are forgot
For to our Common Prayers they will not
