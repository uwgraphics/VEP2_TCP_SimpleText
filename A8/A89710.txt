The Noble Monk: OR, An ACROSTICAL PANEGYRIC to the memory of his EXCELLENCY
The Lord General George Monk.
GLory or Shame, Renown, or Infamy
Ever on Great men's ways attendant be,
Our Noble George, with the later 'gan to play;
Right dark it was before the Break of day:
Great now is our hope: Our Morning is begun,
Earnest we look, and long for the rising Sun.
May we not style this Champion our Jove Stator,
Our Cities Cure, our Countries Liberator?
Now England, in whose Nostrils Friars stunck,
Knows She is highly bound to bless a MONK.
Go on brave Hero, as thou have begun,
Entaile that Honor the have already won
On thy successors. Let thine actions shine,
Rendering thee truly' a Branch oth' Yorkish Line,
Grow Great and Good, like him that rightly chose
(Emblem of Innocence) the Milk-white Rose.
Make it appear to the world that thou art He,
Ordained by God for Englands Liberty:
Now look not back, nor once withdraw thine hand,
Know it is no small thing for to save a LAND.
LONDON, Printed by Tho. Milbourn for the Author, 1660.
