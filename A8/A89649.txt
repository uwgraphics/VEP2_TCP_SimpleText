News from SVNDERLAND.
THe English and Scottish Army that engage for the KING, are about 37000. Horse
and Foot, well fitted, and are all upon their march toward these parts; they
are about 25 miles from hence: And the Parliaments Army under the command of
Major Gen: Lambert, about 8000. ready to meet them. There were part of them met
last week, but never fought. They were so near Durham, that the Judge nor the
Justices durst not hold the Assizes and Gaole-delivery, but fled, after the
Cushions were laid, and the Country come in. This was 8. days past. People are
here generally affected to the KING, and no man does contribute but by force,
but some few of their own Faction.
