By the Committee of Safety. A PROCLAMATION
FOrasmuch as this Committee has received certain Information of several
designs and endeavors of persons ill-affected to the public Peace and good
of this Commonwealth, by untrue reports and suggestions, to beget and foment
distempers in the minds of the People, and thereby, under specious pretenses,
to promote their own private and sinister ends and designs, to the endangering
the Peace and Safety of the Commonwealth: And that in order to such attempts
diverse of the said ill-disposed persons, have set on foot Papers under color
of Petitions, of their own framing, and labor to get subscriptions thereunto
in and about the City of London and other parts, the better to countenance
their own mischievous intentions against the Peace of the Nation; The Committee
of Safety knowing of how dangerous consequence it may be to the Inhabitants of
the Cities of London and Westminster, as well as the whole Commonwealth, if
the same be not prevented: And least any may, by the plausible pretenses of
such men, be seduced and drawn in to write their names to such Papers for the
carrying on of designs tending to the ruin of themselves and these Nations,
The said Committee of Safety have thought fit to Publish and declare their
resentments of such undue and dangerous practices; And do hereby prohibit and
forbid all and every person and persons whatsoever, to contrive, promote or
subscribe any such Papers, as are now, or shall be on foot in and about the
Cities of London and Westminster, for the ends and designs aforesaid, or to
endeavor or solicit the getting hands or subscriptions unto any such Papers:
And that if any such Paper be offered to any person or persons to be by them
subscribed, that such person to whom the same shall be tendered do suppress the
same, or give information thereof to the Lord Mayor of the City of London, the
Alderman of the Ward, or next Justice of the Peace, who are hereby enjoined and
required, to cause the person so endeavoring to get hands thereunto, to be
apprehended, and kept in safe custody, and such Papers suppressed. And this
Committee do require and enjoin, that no person or persons whatsoever, do after
the Publication hereof, promote such Papers or Subscriptions, or endeavor to
get hands or subscriptions thereunto, as they tender the good and peace of the
said Cities and this Commonwealth, and as they desire to avoid being accounted
disturbers and enemies thereof.

Given at the Committee of Safety at Whitehall, the first day of December,
1659.
ORdered, That this Proclamation be forthwith Printed and Published.
