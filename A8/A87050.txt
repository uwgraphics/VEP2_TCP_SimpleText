Present Condition, Impartially stated and related. WITH A Removal of such
Imputations as are scandalously cast on those Countries, whereby many deceived
Souls, chose rather to Beg, Steal, rot in Prison, and come to shameful deaths,
then to better their being by going thither, wherein is plenty of all things
necessary for Humane subsistence.

LONDON, Printed by T. Mabb, and are to be sold by Nich. Bourn, near the Royal
Exchange, 1656.

TO His Honored and Worthy Friends the Worshipful William Stone Esquire,
Governor; and Leivt. General of the Province of Maryland. AND Mr. James
Williamson of Rapahanock in Virginia Gentleman.
Gentlemen,
AS ye both are Eminent in your Places, and are as well beloved where ye live;
and that your loves to each other are such, as I wish the Union between
Virginia and Maryland to be, my Subject being concerning both places: I know
none more fit then your selves to Dedicate it to, (not so much for your
kindnesses, which I have often tasted of (as that the truth hereof under your
Patronage may obtain belief and credit: I crave your Pardons, for intruding
this unknown to you, and using your names to so mean a piece; I have certified
you wherefore I did it; to which I add, that I am desirous the whole country
may note your affections to each other; And that I dare in England own and
Entitle him my Governor; that in Maryland I fled for submitting to. I shall
no further enlarg here more, then to let you know, that I am to those Countries
and Your selves, an

Humble Servant, and Well-wisher whilst I am Jo. Hammond.

TO Those two worthy Commanders and Mariners, Capt. John Whittie, Commander of
the good Ship, the Freeman, now bound for Virginia; And Capt. Sam. Tilghman,
Commander of the Golden Fortune, now bound for the Province of MARYLAND.
SIRS,
AS I have made choice of two Honorable Gentlemen, the one belonging to
Virginia, the other to Maryland; So I thought it not impertinent equally with
them to Dedicate this to you two living in England, and Using the Trade of
Virginia and Maryland, that your selves may judge and testify, who well know
the Country, that that I have not added to their worths, but rather been
sparing of what is justly their dues: For it is a received error amongst the
many slanders cast on these places, that we are sworn neither to Speak nor
Write but glossingly of them; If we are so sworn, they cannot believe ye are;
and therefore will credit your Affirmations, both places speak worthily of
you, both for affable usage of your Passengers, and noble deportments toward
the inhabitants in those Countries; and so are ye both noted, that I wish ye
were as well known to all strangers desirous to ship themselves thither, as to
us that have lived there: They then would as much covet to be your Passengers,
as we that by experience have felt and known your goodness; many other
Gentlemen of good repute uses the Trade: but this I dare affirm, that though
they may be had in equal esteem, yet men more generally beloved and applauded
I have not known, using that Course than your selves: You know I flatter not;
therefore I crave no excuse, unless for my presumption in this attempt; but
seeing unknown to your selves, I have published your names here in Print, pray
call me not to account for it: This Book I confess is not worthy of it, nor I
of your angers; but how ever ye see it is past, and litera scripta manet, ye
must either buy up and burn all, or ye will be found here, and I hope not
blemished in it, nor in owning the truth of,

Your real Servant, JOHN HAMMOND.

Leah and Rachell, or the two fruitful Sisters of Virginia and Maryland;
their present condition impartially stated and related.
IT is the glory of every Nation to enlarge themselves, to encourage their own
foreign attempts, and to be able to have of their own, within their own
territories, as many several commodities as they can attain to, that so others
may rather be beholding to them, then they to others; and to this purpose have
Encouragements, Privileges and Emunities been given to any Discoveries or
Adventurers into remote Colonies, by all politic Common Wealths in the world.

But alas, we Englishmen (in all things else famous, and to other Countries
terrible) do not only fail in this, but vilify, scandalize and cry down such
parts of the unknown world, as have been found out, settled and made
flourishing, by the charge, hazard and diligence of their own brethren, as if
because removed from us, we either account them people of another world or
enemies.

This is too truly made good in the odiums and cruel slanders cast on those
two famous Countries of Virginia and Maryland, whereby those Countries, not
only are many times at a stand, but are in danger to moulder away, and come in
time to nothing; nor is there any thing but the fertility and natural
gratefulness of them, left a remedy to prevent it.

To let our own Nation (whose common good I covet, and whose Common wealths
servant I am, as born to no other use) be made sensible of these injuries: I
have undertaken in this Book to give the true state of those places, according
to the condition they are now in; and to declare either to distressed or
discontented, that they need not doubt because of any rumor detracting from
their goodnesses, to remove and cast themselves and Fortunes upon those
Countries, in which if I should deviate from the truth; I have at this present
carping enemies in London enough, to contradict and cry down me and this, for
Impostours. It is not long since I came from thence (God knows sore against my
will) having lived there upward of one and twenty years; nor do I intend (by
Gods assistance) to be long out of it again: and therefore can by experience,
not hearsay (as Bullock and other lying Writters have done, who at random or
for their own private lucre have rendered their Books rediculous and themselves
infamous liars, nor will I like them, over extol the places, as if they were
rather Paradices than earthly habitations; but truly let ye know, what they
are, and how the people there live.) Which when impartially viewed, will
undoubtedly clear up those Foggy Mists, that has to their own ruin blinded
and kept off many from going thither, whose miseries and misfortunes by staying
in England are much to be lamented, and much to be pitied.

In respect these two Sister Countries (though distinct Governments) are much
of one nature, both for produce and manner of living; I shall only at present,
Treat of the elder Sister Virginia, and in speaking of that include both: And
ere I leave off, shall in particular rehearse the unnatural usuage Maryland
the younger Sister, has had, not by Virginia; but by those Vipers she has
received and harbored with much kindness and hospitality.

The Country is reported to be an unhealthy place, a nest of Rogues, whores,
desolute and rooking persons; a place of intolerable labor, bad usage and hard
Diet, etc.

To Answer these several calumnies, I shall first show what it was? next, what
it is?

At the first settling and many years after, it deserved most of those
aspersions (nor were they then aspersions but truths) it was not settled at the
public charge; but when found out, challenged, and maintained by Adventurers,
whose avarice and inhumanity, brought in these inconveniences, which to this
day brands Virginia.

Then were Jayls emptied, youth seduced, infamous women drilled in, the
provisions all brought out of England, and that embezzelled by the Trustees
(for they durst neither hunt fowl, nor Fish, for fear of the Indian, which they
stood in aw of, their labor was almost perpetual, their allowance of victual
small, few or no cattle, no use of horses nor oxen to draw or carry, (which
labors men supplied themselves) all which caused a mortality; no civil courts
of justice but under a Marshall law, no redress of grievances, complaints were
repaied with stripes, moneys with scoffs, tortures made delights, and in a
word all and the worst that tyrany could inflict or act, which when complained
of in England: (but so were they kept under that it was long ere they would
suffer complaints to come home) the bondage was taken of, the people set free,
and had lands a signed to each of them to live of themselves, and enjoy the
benefit of their own industry; men then began to call what they labored for
their own, they fell to making themselves convenient housing to dwell in, to
plant corn for their food, to range the wood for flesh, the rivers for foul
and fish, to find out somewhat staple for supply of clothing, to continue a
commerce, to purchase and breed cattle, etc. but the bud of this growing
happiness was again nipt by a cruel Massacre committed by the Natives, which
again pulled them back and kept them under, enforcing them to get into Forts
(such as the infancy of those times afforded: they were taken off from
planting; their provisions destroyed, their Cattle, Hogs, Horses, etc. killed
up, and brought to such want and penury, that diseases grew rife, mortality
exceeded; but receiving a supply of men, ammunition and victuals out of England,
they again gathered heart, pursued their enemies, and so often worsted them,
that the Indians were glad to sue for peace, and they desirous of a cessation)
consented to it.

They again began to bud forth, to spread further, to gather wealth, which they
rather profusely spent (as gotten with ease then providently husbanded, or
aimed at any public good; or to make a Country for posterity; but from hand
to mouth, and for a present being; neglecting discoveries, planting of
Orchards, providing for the Winter preservation of their stocks, or thinking of
any thing staple or firm; and whilst Tobacco, the only Commodity they had to
subsist on bore a price, they wholly and eagerly followed that, neglecting their
very planting of Corn, and much relied on England for the chiefest part of
their provisions; so that being not always amply supplied, they were often in
such want, that their case and condition being related in England, it hindered
and kept off many from going thither, who rather cast their eyes on the Barren
and freezing soil of New England, than to join with such an idigent and
sottish people,) is were reported to be in Virginia.

Yet was not Virginia all this while without diverse honest and virtuous
inhabitants, who observing the general neglect and licensiousnesses there,
caused Assemblies to be called and Laws to be made tending to the glory of God,
the severe suppression of vices, and the compelling them not to neglect (upon
strickt punishments) planting and tending such quantities of Corn, as would not
only serve themselves, their Cattle and Hogs plentifully, but to be enabled to
supply New England (then in want) with such proportions, as were extreme
reliefs, to them in their necessities.

From this industry of theirs and great plenty of Corn, (the main staff of
life) proceeded that great plenty of Cattle and Hogs, (now innumerable) and out
of which not only New England has been stocked and relieved, but all other
parts of the Indies inhabited by Englishmen.

The inhabitants now finding the benefit of their industries, began to look
with delight on their increasing stocks: (as nothing more pleasurable then
profit) to take pride in their plentifully furnished Tables, to grow not only
civil, but great observers of the Sabbath, to stand upon their reputations, and
to be ashamed of that notorious manner of life they had formerly lived and
wallowed in.

They then began to provide and send home for Gospel Ministers, and largely
contributed for their maintenance; But Virginia savouring not handsomely in
England, very few of good conversation would adventure thither, (as thinking it
a place wherein surely the fear of God was not) yet many came, such as wore
Black Coats, and could babble in a Pulpet, roar in a Tavern, exact from their
Parishoners, and rather by their dissoluteness destroy than feed their Flocks.

Loath was the Country to be wholly without Teachers, and therefore rather
retain these then to be destitute; yet still endeavors for better in their
places, which were obtained, and these Wolves in sheeps clothing, by their
Assemblies questioned, silenced, and some forced to depart the Country.

Then began the Gospel to flourish, civil, honorable, and men of great ^states
flocked in: famous buildings went forward, Orchards innumerable were planted
and preserved; Tradesmen set on work and encouraged, staple Commodities, as
Silk, Flax, Potashes, etc. of which I shall speak further hereafter, attempted
on, and with good success brought to perfection; so that this Country which
had a mean beginning, many back friends, two ruinous and bloody Massacres, has
by Gods grace out-grown all, and is become a place of pleasure and plenty.

And having briefly laid down the former state of Virginia, in its Infancy, and
filth, and the occasion of its scandalous aspersions: I come to my main
subject, its present Condition and Happiness (if any thing can be justly called
happy in this transatory life (otherwise then as blessings which in the well
using whereof, a future happiness may be expected.)

I affi^me the Country to be wholesome, healthy and fruitful; and a model on
which industry may as much improve it self in, as in any habitable part of the
World; yet not such a Lubberland as the Fiction of the land of Ease, is
reported to be, nor such a Vtopian as St. Thomas Moore has related to be found
out.

In the Countries minority, and before they had well cleared the ground to let
in air (which now is otherwise) many imputed the stifling of the wood to be
the cause of such sickness; but I rather think the contrary; for diverse new
Rivers lately settled, were at their first coming upon them as woody as James
Rivers, the first place they settled in, and yet those Rivers are as healthy as
any former settled place in Virginia or England it self: I believe (and that not
without reason) it was only want of such diet as best agreed with our English
natures, good drinks and wholesome lodgings were the cause of so much
sicknesses, as were formerly frequent, which we have now amended; and therefore
enjoy better healths; to which I add, and that by experience since my coming
into England, and many (if not all Virginians can do the like,) that change of
air does much alter the state of our bodies: by which many travelers thither
may expect some sickness, yet little danger of mortality.

A Geographicall description of the Country I shall not attempt (as having
littles kill in the Mathematics) enough of that has been formerly Written;
nor is it a place now to learn to discover. I shall abhor to spirit over any;
but go along with such as are voluntarily desirous to go thither, and lead them
with my blunt relation (for truth knows little of eloquence) aboard the Ships
thither bound, and carrying you into the Country, show you the courtesy of the
place, the, disposition of the Inhabitants, the commodities, and give all sorts
of people advice how and where to set down for their present benefit and future
accommodation.

If any are minded to repair thither, if they are not in a capacity to defray
their own charges (if they are I wish they might and so be at their own
disposing) let them not be seduced by those mercinary spirits that know little
of the place, nor aim at any good of theirs, but only by foysting and
flattering them to gain a reward of those they procure them for; beware them,
for it is not only hab nab whether ye go to a good service or a bad, but
scandalous to your selves to be so seduced, and it were good and very just that
such vagabond people were severely punished, as great betrayers of their own
Nation, for ye cannot imagine but there are as well bad services as good; but I
shall show ye if any happen into the hands of such crooked dispositions, how to
order them and ease your selves, when I come to treat of the justice of the
Country, which many being ignorant of suffer inconveniences, which by this they
may prevent.

Let such as are so minded not rashly throw themselves upon the voyage, but
observe the nature, and enquire the qualities of the persons with whom they
engage to transport themselves, or if (as not acquainted with such as inhabit
there, but go with Merchants and Mariners, who transport them to others,) let
their covenant be such, that after their arrival they have a fortnights time
assigned them to enquire of their Master, and make choice of such as they
intend to expire their time with, nor let that brand of selling of servants, be
any discouragement to deter any from going, for if a time must be served, it is
all one with whom it be served, provided they be people of honest repute, with
which the Country is well replenished.

And be sure to have your contract in writing and under hand and seal, for if
ye go over upon promise made to do this or that, or to be free or your own men,
it signifies nothing, for by a law of the Country (waving all promises) any one
coming in, and not paying their own passages, must serve if men or women four
years, if younger according to their years, but where an Inden^ure is, that is
binding and observing.

The usual allowance for servants is (besides their charge of passage
defrayed) at their expiration, a years provision of corn, dubble apparel,
tools necessary, and land according to the custom of the Country, which is an
old delusion, for there is no land accustomary due to the servant, but to the
Master, and therefore that servant is unwise that will not dash out that custom
in his covenant, and make that due of land absolutely his own, which although
at the present, not of so great consequence; yet in few years will be of much
worth, as I shall hereafter make manifest.

When ye go aboard, expect the Ship somewhat troubled and in a hurliburly,
until ye clear the lands end; and that the Ship is rummaged, and things put to
rights, which many times discourages the Passengers, and makes them wish the
Voyage unattempted: but this is but for a short season, and washes off when at
Sea, where the time is pleasantly passed away, though not with such choice
plenty as the shore affords.

But when ye arrive and are settled, ye will find a strange alteration, an
abused Country giving the lie in your own approbations to those that have
calumniated ir, and these infalable arguments may convince all incredible and
obstinate opinions, concerning the goodness and delightfulness of the
Country, that never any servants of late times have gone thither; but in their
Letters to their Friends commend and approve of the place, and rather invite
than dissuade their acquaintance from coming thither. An other is this, that
seldom (if ever) any that has continued in Virginia any time, will or do
desire to live in England, but post back with what expedition they can;
although many are landed men in England, and have good Estates here, and diverse
ways of preferments propounded to them, to entice and persuade their
continuance.

The Country is as I said of a temperate nature, the days, in summer not so
long as in England, in winter longer; it is somewhat hotter in June, July and
August then here, but that heat sweetly allayed by a continual breaze of wind,
which never fails to cool and refresh the labourer and traveller; the cold
seldom approaches sencibly until about Christmas, (although the last winter
was hard and the worst I or any living there ever knew) and when winter comes,
(which is such and no worse then is in England,) it continues two months
seldom longer, often not so long and in that time although here seldom
hard-weather keep men from labor, yet there no work is done all winter except
dressing their own victuals and making of fires.

The labor servants are put to, is not so hard nor of such continuance as
Husbandmen, nor Handecraftmen are kept at in England, as I said little or
nothing is done in winter time, none ever work before sun rising nor after sun
set, in the summer they rest, sleep or exercise themselves five hours in the
heat of the day, Saturdays afternoon is always their own, the old Holidayes
are observed and the Sabboath spent in good exercises.

The Women are not (as is reported) put into the ground to work, but occupy
such domestique employments and houswifery as in England, that is dressing
victuals, righting up the house, milking, employed about dayries, washing,
sowing, etc. and both men and women have times of recreations, as much or more
than in any part of the world besides, yet some wenches that are nasty, beastly
and not fit to be so employed are put into the ground, for reason tells us,
they must not at charge be transported and then mantained for nothing, but
those that prove so awkward are rather burthensom then servants desirable or
useful.

The Country is fruitful, apt for all and more then England can or does
produce, the usual diet is such as in England, for the rivers afford
innumerable sorts of choice fish, (if they will take the pains to make wyers
or hier the Natives, who for a small matter will undertake it,) winter and
summer, and that in many places sufficient to serve the use of man, and to
fatten hoggs, water-fowle of all sorts are (with admiration to be spoken of)
plentiful, and east to be killed, yet by many degrees more plentiful in some
places then in othersome, Dear all over the Country, and in many places so
many, that venison is accounted a tiresom meat, wild Turkeys are frequent, and
so large that I have seen some weigh near threescore pounds; other beasts there
are whose flesh is wholesome and savourie, such are unknown to us; and therefore
I will not stuff my book with superfluous, relation of their names; huge
Oysters and store in all parts where the salt water comes.

The Country is exceedingly replenished with Neat cattle, Hoggs, Goats and
Tame-fowle, but not many sheep; so that mutton is somewhat scarce but that
defect is supplied with store of Venison; other flesh and foul, the Country is
full of gallant Orchards, and the fruit generally more luscious and delightful
then here, witness the Peach and Quince, the latter may be eaten raw
savourily, the former differs and as much exceeds ours as the best relished
apple we have does the crabb, and of both most excellent and comfortable drinks
are made, Grapes in infinite manners grow wild, so do Walnuts, Smalnuts,
Chestnuts and abundance of excellent fruits, Plums and Berries, not growing or
known in England; grain we have, both English and Indian for bread and Bear,
and Pease besides English of ten several sorts, all exceeding ours in England,
the gallant root of Potatoes are common, and so are all sorts of roots, herbs
and Garden stuff.

It must needs follow then that diet cannot be scarce, since both rivers and
woods affords it, and that such plenty of Cattle and Hoggs are every where,
which yield beef, milk, butter, cheese and other made dishes, porke, bacon,
and pigs, and that as sweet and savoury meat as the world affords, these with
the help of Orchards and Gardens, Oysters, Fish, Foul and Venison, certainly
cannot but be sufficient for a good deit and wholesome accommodation, considering
how plentifully they are, and how easy with industry to be had.

Bear is indeed in some place constantly drunken, in other some, nothing but
Water or Milk, and Water or Beverige; and that is where the goodwives, if I may
so call them, are negligent and idle; for it is not for want of Corn to make
Malt with (for the Country affords enough) but because they are sloathfull and
careless: but I hope this item will shame them out of those humors, that they
will be adjudged by their drink, what kind of Housewives they are.

Those Servants that will be industrious may in their time of service gain a
competent estate before their Freedoms, which is usually done by many, and
they gain esteem and assistance that appear so industrious: There is no Master
almost but will allow his Servant a parcel of clear ground to plant some
Tobacco in for himself, which he may husband at those many idle times he has
allowed him and not prejudice, but rejoice his Master to see it, which in time
of Shipping he may lay out for commodities, and in Summer sell them again with
advantage, and get a Sow-Pig or two, which any body almost will give him, and
his Master suffer him to keep them with his own, which will be no charge to his
Master, and with one years increase of them may purchase a Cow Calf or two, and
by that time he is for himself; he may have Cattle, Hogs and Tobacco of his
own, and come to live gallantly; but this must be gained (as I said) by
Industry and affability, not by sloth nor churlish behavior.

And whereas it is rumoured that Servants have no lodging other then on boards,
or by the Fire side, it is contrary to reason to believe it; First, as we are
Christians; next as people living under a law, which compels as well the Master
as the Servant to perform his duty; nor can true labor be either expected or
exacted without sufficient clothing, diet, and lodging; all which both their
Indentures (which must inviolably be observed) and the Justice of the Country
requires.

But if any go thither, not in a condition of a Servant, but pay his or her
passage, which is some six pounds: Let them not doubt but it is money well laid
out (yet however let them not fall (although they carry little else to take a
Bed along with them, and then few Houses but will give them entertainment,
either out of courtesy, or on reasonable terms; and I think it better for any
that goes over free, and but in a mean condition, to hire himself for
reasonable wages of Tobacco and Provision, the first year, provided he happen
in an honest house, and where the Mistress is noted for a good Housewife, of
which there are very many (notwithstanding the cry to the contrary) for by that
means he will live free of disbursment, have something to help him the next
year, and be carefully looked to in his sickness (if he chance to fall sick)
and let him so covenant that exceptions may be made, that he work not much in
the hot weather, a course we always take with our new hands (as they call
them) the first year they come in.

If they are women that go after this manner, that is paying their own passage;
I advise them to sojourn in a house of honest repute, for by their good
carriage, they may advance themselves in marriage, by their ill, overthow their
fortunes; and although loose persons seldom live long unmarried if free; yet
they match with as desolute as themselves, and never live handsomely or are ever
respected.

For any that come over free, and are minded to diet and quarter in another
man's house, it matters not whether they know on what term or conditions they
are there; for by an excellent Decree, made by Sir William Berkly, when
Governor; (as indeed he was the Author of many good Laws:) It was ordered,
that if any inhabitant received any stranger Merchant, or border into their
houses, and did not condition in Writing with him or them so entertained on
what terms he received them, it should be supposed an invitation, an no
satisfaction should be allowed or recovered in any Court of Justice; thereby
giving notice that no stranger coming into the Country should be drilled in, or
made a purchase of under color of friendship: but that the Inhabitants at
first coming shall let them know how they mean to deal with them, that if they
like not the terms they may remove themselves at pleasure; a Law so good and
commendable, that it is never like to be revoked or altered.

Now for those that carry over Families and estates with a determination to
inhabit, my advice is that they neither sojourn for that will be chargeable;
nor on the sudden purchase, for that may prove unfortunate; but that they for
the first year hire a house (for seats are always to be hired) and by that
means, they will not only find content and live at a cheap rate, but be
acquainted in the Country and learn the worth and goodness of the Plantation
they mean to purchase; and so not rashly entangle themselves in an ill bargain,
or find where a convenient parcel of Land is for their turns to be taken up.

Yet are the Inhabitants generally affable, courteous and very assistant to
strangers (for what but plenty makes hospitality and good neighbor hood) and
no sooner are they settled, but they will be visiting, presenting and advicing
the stranger how to improve what they have, how to better their way of
livelihood.

Justice is there duly and daily administered; hardly can any travail two miles
together, but they will find a Justice, which has power of himself to hear
and determine mean differences, to secure and bind over notorious offenders,
of which very few are in the Country.

In every County are Courts kept, every two months, and oftener if occasion
require, in which Courts all things are determined without exceptions; and if
any dislike the proceedings of those Courts, they have liberty to appeal to the
Quarter Court, which is four times a year; and from thence to the Assembly,
which is once or oftener every year: So that I am confident, more speedy Justice
and with smaller charge is not in any place to be found.

Thest is seldom punished (as being seldom or never committed; for as the
Proverb is, where there are no receivers, there are no thieves; and although
Doors are nightly left open (esp^ci^lly in the Summer time) Hedges hanging
full of Clothes; Plate frequently us;ed amongst all comers and goers (and
there is good store of Plate in many houses) yet I never heard of any loss
ever received either in Plate, Linen, or any thing else out of their Houses
all the time I inhabited there.

Indeed I have known some suffer for stealing of Hogs, (but not since they have
been plentiful) and whereas Hogstealing was once punished with death, it is
now made penal, and restitution given very amply to the owner thereof.

Cases of Murder are punished as in England, and Juries allowed, as well in
Criminal causes, as in all other differences between party and party, if they
desire it.

Servants complaints are freely harkened to, and (if not causlesly made) their
Masters are compelled either speedily to amend, or they are removed upon second
complaint to another service; and often times not only set free, if the abuse
merit it, but ordered to give reparation and damage to their servant.

The Country is very full of sober, modest persons, both men and women, and
many that truly fear God and follow that perfect rule of our blessed Savior,
to do as they would be done by; and of such a happy inclination is the Country,
that many who in England have been lewd and idle, there in emulation or
imitation (for example moves more then precept) of the industry of those they
find there, not only grow ashamed of their former courses, but abhor to hear
of them, and in small time wipe off those stains they have formerly been
tainted with; yet I cannot but confess, there are people wicked enough (as
what Country is free) for we know some natures will never be reformed, but
these must follow the Friars rule, Si non cast, tamen cante; for if any be
known, either to profane the Lords day or his Name, be found drunk, commit
whoredom, scandalize or disturb his neighbor, or give offense to the world by
living suspiciously in any bad courses; there are for each of these, severe and
wholesome laws and remedies made, provided and duly put in execution: I can
confidently affirm, that since my being in England, which is not yet four
months, I have been an eye and ear witness of more deceits and villainies (and
such as modesty forbids me to utter) then I either ever saw or heard mention
made of in Virginia, in my one and twenty years abode in those parts.

And therefore those that shall blemish Virginia any more, do but like the Dog
bark against the Moon, until they be blind and weary; and Virginia is now in
that secure growing condition, that like the Moon so barked at, she will pass
on her course, maugre all detractors, and a few years will bring it to that
glorious happiness, that many of her calumniators, will intercede to procure
admittance thither, when it will be hard to be attained to; for in small time,
little land will be to be taken up; and after a while none at all; and as the
Mulberry Trees grows up, which are by every one planted, Tobacco will be laid
by, and we shall wholly fall to making of Silk (a Sample of 400 l. has already
been sent for England, and approved of) which will require little labor; and
therefore shall have little use of Servants; besides, Children increase and
thrive so well there, that they themselves will sufficiently supply the defect
of Servants: And in small time become a Nation of themselves sufficient to
people the Country: And this good policy is there used; As the Children there
born grow to maturity, and capable (as they are generally very capable and apt)
they are still preferred and put into authority, and carry themselves therein
civilly and discretly; and few there are but are able to give some Portions
with their daughters, more or less, according to their abilities; so that many
coming out of England have raised themselves good fortunes there merely by
matching with Maidens born in the Country.

And therefore I cannot but admire, and indeed much pity the dull stupidity of
people necessitated in England, who rather then they will remove themselves,
live here a base, slavish, penurious life; as if there were a necessity to live
and to live so, choosing rather then they will forsake England to stuff
Newgate, Bridewell, and other, Jayles with their carkessies, nay cleave to
tyburne it self; and so bring confusion to their souls horror and infamine to
their kindred or posterity, others itch out their wearisom lives in reliance
of other men's charities, an uncertain and unmanly expectation; some more
abhorring such courses betake themselves to almost perpetual and restless
toil and druggeries out of which (whilst their strength lasts) they
(observing hard diets, early and late hours) make hard shif^ to subsist from
hand to mouth, until age or sickness takes them off from labor and directs
them the way to beggerie, and such indeed are to be pitied, relieved and
provided for.

I have seriously considered when I have (passing the streets) heard the
several Cries, and noting the commmodities, and the worth of them they have
carried and cried up and down; how possibly a livelihood could be exacted out
of them, as to cry Matches, Smal-coal, Blacking, Pen and Ink, Thred-laces, and
a hundred more such kind of trifling merchandises; then looking on the
nastinesse of their linen habits and bodies: I conclude it gain sufficient
could be raised out of them for subsistence; yet their manner of living was
degenerate and base; and their condition to be far below the meanest servant in
Virginia*

The other day, I saw a man heavily laden with a burden of Faggots on his
back, crying, Dry Faggots, Dry Faggots; he travailed much ground, bawled
frequently, and sweat with his burden: but I saw none buy any, near three
hours I followed him, in which time he rested, I entered into discourse with
him, offered him drink, which he thankfully accepted of (as desirous to learn
the mystery of his trade) I enquired what he got by each burden when sold? he
answered me three pence: I further asked him what he usually got a day? he
replied, some days nothing some days six pence; some time more, but seldom;
me thought it was a pitiful life, and I admired how he could live on it; And
yet it were dangerous to advise these wretches to better their conditions by
travail, for fear of the cry of, a spirit, a spirit.

The country is not only plentiful but pleasant and profitable, pleasant in
regard of the brightness of the weather, the many delightful rivers, on which
the inhabitants are settled (every man almost living in sight of a lovely
river) the abundance of game, the extraordinary good neighborhood and loving
conversation they have one with the other.

Pleasant in their building, which although for most part they are but one
story besides the loft, and built of wood, yet contrived so delightful, that
your ordinary houses in England are not so handsome, for usually the rooms are
large, daubed and whitelimed, glazed and flowered, and if not gl^zed windows,
shutters which are made very pretty and convenient.

Pleasant in observing their stocks and flocks of Cattle, Hoggs, and Poultry,
grazing, whisking and skipping in their sights, pleasant in having all things
of their own, growing or breeding without drawing the penny to send for this and
that, without which, in England they cannot be supplied.

The manner of living and trading there is thus, each man almost lives a
freeholder, nothing but the value of 12. d. a year to be paid as rent, for
every 50. Acrees of land; firing cost nothing every man plants his own corn
and need take no care for bread: if any thing be bought, it is for comodity,
exchanged presently, or for a day, payment is usual made but once a year, and
for that Bill taken (for accounts are not pleadable.)

In summer when fresh meat will not keep (seeing every man kills of his own, and
quantities are inconvenient, they lend from one to another, such portions of
flesh as they can spare, which is repaied again when the borrowers kills his.

If any fall sick, and cannot compass to follow his crope which if not
followed, will soon be lost, the adjoining neighbor, will either voluntarily
or upon a request join together, and work in it by spells, until the honor
recovers, and that gratis, so that no man by sickness loose any part of his
years work.

Let any travel, it is without charge, and at every house is entertainment as
in a hostery, and with it hearty welcome are stranger entertained.

In a word, Virginia wants not good victual, wants not good dispositions, and
as God has freely bestowed it, they as freely impart with it, yet are there
as well bad natures as good.

The profit of the country is either by their labor, their stocks, or their
trades.

By their labors is produced corn and Tobacco, and all other growing
provisions, and this Tobacco however now low-rated, yet a good maintenance may
be had out of it, (for they have nothing of necessity but clothing to
purchasse) or can this mean price of Tobacco long hold, for these reasons,
First that in England it is prohibited, next that they have attained of late
those sorts equal with the best Spanish, Thirdly that the sickness in Holland
is decreasing, which has been a great obstruction to the sail of Tobacco.

And lastly, that as the mulbery tree grows up, tobacco will be neglected and
silk, flax, two staple commodities generally fallen upon.

Of the increase of cattle and hoggs, much advantage is made, by selling biefe,
porke, and bacon, and butter etc. either to shipping, or to send to the
Barbados, and other Islands, and he is a very poor man that has not sometimes
provision to put off.

By trading with Indians for Skine, Beaver, Furs and other commodities
oftentimes good profits are raised; The Indians are in absolute subjection to
the English, so that they both pay tribute to them and receive all their
several king from them, and as one dies they repair to the English for a
successor so that none need doubt it a place of security.

Several ways of advancement there are and employments both for the learned and
laborer, recreation for the gentry, traffic for the adventurer, congregations
for the ministry (and oh that God would stir, up the hearts of more to go
over, such as would teach good doctrine, and not paddle in faction, or state
matters; they could not want maintenance, they would find an assisting, an
embracing, a conforming people.)

It is known (such preferment has this Country rewarded the industrious with)
that some from being wool-hoppers and of as mean and meaner employment in
England have there grown great merchants, and attained to the most eminent
advancements the Country afforded. If men cannot gain (by diligence) states in
those parts.) I speak not only mine own opinion, but diverse others, and
something by experience) it will hardly be done (unless by mere luck as
gamsters thrive, and other accidentals in any other part whatsoever.

Now having briefly set down the present state of Virginia not in fiction, but
in realitie, I wish the juditious reader to consider what dislike can be had of
the Country, or upon what grounds it is so infamously injured, I only therein
covet to stop those blackmouthed babblers, that not only have and do abuse so
noble a plantation, but abuse Gods great blessing in adding to England so
flourishing a branch, in persuading many souls, rather to follow desparate and
miserable courses in England, then to engage in so honorable an undertaking as
to travile and inhabit there: but to those I shall (if admonition will not
work on their recreant spirits) only say. Let him that is filthy be filthy
still.

Mary-lands Additions.
HAving for 19. year served Virginia the elder sister, I casting my eye on
Maryland the younger, grew in amoured on her beauty, resolving like Jacob when
he had first served for Leah, to begin a fresh service for Rachell.

Two year and upward have I enjoyed her company with delight and profit, but
was enforced by reason of her unnatural disturbances to leave her weeping for
her children and would not be comforted, because they were not; yet will I
never totally forsake or be beaten off from her.

Twice has she been deflowred by her own Inhabitants, stripped, shorn and made
deformed; yet such a natural fertility and comeliness does she retain that
she cannot but be loved, but be pitied; and although she would ever have
veiled to Virginia as her elder, yet had not these two fatal mischiefs
hapened, she would ere long have spread her self as largly, and produced as
much in every respect as Virginia does or could do.

Maryland is a province not commonly known in England, because the name of
Virginia includes or clouds it, it is a Country wholly belonging to that
honorable Gentleman the Lord of Baltamore, granted him by Pattent under the
broad Seal of England long since, and at his charge settled, granted for many
reasons, and this for one; that Virginia having more land then they could
manure or look after inconvenient time, first the Duch came and took from the
English much land which they still hold, next the Swead, who entrenched nearer
and had not this Pattent came and prevented it, Dutch, Swead, French and other
strangers had pend up our Nation with in the bounds of Virginia, whereas now
they have now all Maryland, as it were their own, it being only granted for
the use of Britains and Irish.

It is (not an Island as is reported, but) part of that maine adjoining to
Virginia, only separated or parted from Virginia, by a river of ten miles
broad, called Patomack river, the commodities and manner of living as in
Virginia, the soil somewhat more temporate (as being more Northerly) many
stately and navigable rivers are contained in it, plentifully stored with whole
some springs, a rich and pleasant soil, and so that its extraordinary goodness
has made it rather desired then envied, which has been fatal to her (as
beauty is often times to those that are endued with it) and that the reader may
thoroughly be informed how she has suffered. I shall in brief relate, and
conclude.

It is to be understood that in the time of the late King; Virginia being whole
for monarchy, and the last Country belonging to England that submitted to
obedience of the Commonwealth of England. And there was in Virginia a certain
people congregated into a Church, calling themselves Independents, which daily
increasing, several consulations were had by the state of that Coloney, how to
suppress and extinguish them, which was daily put in execution, as first their
Pastor was banished, next their other Teachers, then many by informatio^s clapped
up in prison, then generally difarmed) which was very harsh in such a country
where the heathen live round about them) by one Colonel Samuel Mathews then a
Counselor in Virginia and since Agent for Virginia to the then parliament, and
lastly in a condition of banishment, so that they knew not in those streights
how to dispose of themselves.

Maryland (my present subject) was courted by them as a refuge, the Lord
Proprietor and his Governor solicited to, and several addresses and treaties
made for their admittance and entertainment into that province, their
conditions were pitied, their propositions were harkened to and agree on,
which was that they should have convenient portion of land assigned them,
liberty of conscience and privilege to choose their own officers, and hold
courts within themselves, all was granted them, they had a whole County of the
richest land in the province asigned them, and such as themselves made choice
of, the conditions of plantations (such as were common to all adventurers) were
showed and propounded to them, which they extremely approved of, and nothing
was in those conditions exacted from them, but appeals to the Provincial
court, quit-rents, and an oath of fidelity to the Proprietor: An assembly was
called thoroughout the whole Country after their coming over (consisting
as well of themselves as the rest) and because there were some few papists that
first inhabited these themselves, and others of being different judgments, an
act passed that all professing in Jesus Christ should have equal justice,
privileges and benefits in that province, and that none on penalty
(mentioned) should disturb each other in their several professions, nor give
the urging terms, either of Roundheads, sectarie, Independent, Jesuit, Papist,
etc. Intending an absolute peace and union; the Oath of Fidelity (although
none other then such as every Lord of a manner requires from his tenant) was
over hauled, and this clause added to it (provided it infring not the liberty
of the conscience.)

They sat down joyfully, followed their vocations cheerfully, trad increased
in their province, and diverse others were by this encouraged and invited over
from Virginia.

But these people finding themselves in a capacity not only to capitulate, but
to oversway, those that had so received and relieved them.

Began to pick quarrels, first with the Papists, next with the oath, and
lastly declared their aversness to all conformalitie, wholly aiming (as
themselves since confessed) to deprive the Lord proprietor of all his interest
in that country, and make it their own: with unworthiness? What ingratitude?
with unparalled inhumanitie was in these practices made obvious.

Amongst others that became tenants in this aforesaid distress was one Richard
Bennet Merchant, who seated and settled amongst them, and so (not only owed
obedience to that government, but) was obliged as a man received in his
pretended distress, to be a gratfull benefactor upon the setting forth of a
fleet intended for the reducement of Virginia, the the said Bennet and one
Claiborne (a pestilent enemy to the wel-faire of that province and the Lord
Proprietor, although he had formerly submissively acknowledged he owed his
forfeited life to the said proprietor, for dealing so favorably with him for
his misdemeanors, as by his treacherous letters under his hand (now in print)
is manifest, and many other acts of grace conferred on him, having a commission
directed to them and others (who miscarried by sea) to reduce Virginia (not
Maryland, for they were in obedience to the Commonwealth of England, and great
assistance to the said fleet) although they knew Maryland to be excluded and
dashed out of their Commission, yet because the commission mentioned the Bay of
Chesapeack (in which Maryland was (as well as Virginia) yet they were resolved
to wreth and stretch their commission to the prejudice of Maryland and
becoming abbetters and confederats with those serpents that have been so taken
in, presumed to alter the government and take away the governors Commission,
putting in others in their place, viz. a Papist in chief, and one more, who
misgoverning the Country, they were excluded, and the former governor restored
with an addition of Commissioners of their own creatures, and as taking power
from them, until further knowledge from England, driving herein at their own
interest.

The governor (so restored) being truly informed that their proceedings were
illegal; held Courts and proceeds as if no such alteration had been made,
issues out Writs (according to order) In the name of the Lord proprietor, but
they require and command them to do it in the name of the Keepers of the
Liberties of England, according to act of Parliament, to which answer
sufficient was given, that they never were in opposition to the present power,
they had taken the Engagement, and for the tenure or form of writs, they were
not compelled by virtue of that act to make them other wise then they always
had done, for by Patent from the late K. they had power to issue out in the
Proprietors name, and never had used the Kings name at all, therefore that act
requiring all Writs formerly issuing out in the late Kings name, now to revolve
to the Keepers of the Liberties of England, was no way binding to them, who had
never used the kings name at all.

But it was not religion, it was not punctilios they stood upon, it was that
sweet, that rich, that large Country they aimed at; and therefore agrees
amongst themselves to frame petitions, complaints, and subscriptions from those
bandetoes to themselves (the said Bennet and Claiborne) to ease them of their
pretended sufferings, and then come with arms, and again make the Province
their own, exalting themselves in all place of trust and command, totally
expulsing the Governer, and all the hospitable Proprietors, Officers out of
their places.

But when his Highness (not acquainted with these matchinations) had owned and
under his hand and signet acknowledged Cap. Will. Stone (the former governor)
Governor for the Lord Baltamore of his Province of Maryland, he again
endeavored to reasume the government, and fetched away the records from those
usurpers, proclaimed peace to all not obstinate, and favorably received many
submissive, who with seeming joy returned, bewailling their unworthy
ingratitude and inhumanitie, blaming the unbridled ambition and base averice of
those that had misled them.

The Province consists of four Counties already inhabited, viz. St. Mary's,
Calverton, An Arundal and Kent. St. Mary's and Calverton submitted, An Arundall
and part of Kent opposed.

The Governor desirous to reclaim those opposing, takes a party about 130.
persons with him, and sails into those parts, one Roger Heamans who had a
great ship under him, and who had promised to be isntrumental to the governor,
to wind up those differences (being Judas like, hired to join with those
opposing Countries) and having the Governor and his vessels within reach of
his Ordnance, perfidiously and contrary to his undertaking and ingagments,
fires at them and enforces them to the first shore to prevent that mischief.

The next morning he sends messengers to those of An Arundall to treat, and
messengers aboard that Shittlecock Heamans, but all were detained; and on the
25. of March last (being the next day and the Lords day) about 170. and odd of
Kent and Anne Arundall came marching against them, Heaman fires a pace at them,
and a small vessel of New England under the command of one John Cutts comes
near the shore and seazes the boats, provision and ammunition belonging to the
Governor and his party, and so in a nick, in a straight were they fallen upon.

The Governor being shot in many places yields on quarter, which was granted;
but being in hold, was threatened (notwithstanding that quarter given) to be
imediatly executed, unless he would writ to the rest to take quarter, which
upon his request they did, twenty odd were killed in this skirmish, and all
the rest prisoners on quarter, who were disarmed and taken into custody.

But these formerly distressed supplicants for admittance, being now become
High and Mighty States, and supposing their Conquest unquestionable, consult
with themselves (notwithstanding their quarter given) to make their Conquest
more absolute, by cutting off the heads of the Province, viz. the Governor, the
Counsel and Commanders thereof: And so make themselves a Counsel of War, and
condemn them to death: Four were presently executed, scilicet, Mr. William
Stone-head, one of the Council; Capt. William Lewis, Mr. John Legate Gentleman,
and John Pedro; the rest at the importunity of some women, and resolution of
some of their soldiers (who would not suffer their design to take thorough
effect, as being pricked in Conscience for their ingratitudes) were saved, but
were Amerced, Fined and Plundered at their pleasures: And although this was
prophetiquely foreseen by diverse eminent Merchants of London, who Petitioned
his Highness for prevention, and that his Highness sent a gracious command to
Bennet, and all others, not to disturb the Lord Baltamores Officers, nor People
in Maryland, but recalled all Power or pretense of Power from them; yet they
still hold, and possess (in defiance of so sacred a mandate) the said Province
of Maryland, and sent an impious Agent home to Parlie whilst they plundered;
but he has long since given up his account to the great avenger of all
injuries: Although sticklers (somewhat more powerful, but by many degrees more
brazen faced then his spirit could bare him forth to appear) now labor to
justify these inhumanities, disorders, contempts, and rebellions; so that I
may say with the Prophet Jeremiah; How does the City sit solitary that was
full of people? How is she become as a widow? She that was great amongst the
Nations, and Princess amongst the Provinces? How is she become tributary. Thus
have they brought to desolation, one of the happiest Plantations that ever
Englishmen set foot in, and such a Country (that if it were again made formal)
might harbor in peace and plenty all such as England shall have occasion to
disburthen, or desire to forsake England.

A pious consideration of these distractions is by his Highness taking notice
of, and these controversies are by him referred to the Hearing, and Report of
those two Honorable and judicious Gentlemen the Lords Whitlock and
Widdrington, whose Pains and Moderation in Hearing, and mildly disputing
indifferently the condition of these uproars, gives not only hopes of relief,
but have added to their renowns, by all those that (as observed) have been
present at the several Hearings, an account whereof will ere long be published
in print.

Upon determination whereof, it must be concluded that a settlement will
follow, and then many families will flock over to inhabit these ruins, the
fertility of the province will (in short time) make good (excepting the blood
spilt which can never be recalled nor satisfied for.)

Let this be no discouragment to any to go over, for it will now be more
firmly settled then ever, and so thoroughly, settled that neither envy nor
deceit can again ever shake it.

And being so settled, I know no country (although I have traveled many) that I
more affect, more esteem, that which profits delights, and here is both
absolute profit, real delight; I shall forget my undertaking in the beginning
of my book, which was not to over extall the Country: for should I indeed give
it its due commendations, I should seem to be suborned; but in few words, it is
that Country in which I desire to spend the remnant of my days, in which I
covet to make my grave.

This I have not written for profit, for it is known I have given away the
copy, and therefore am the less to be mistrusted for a deluder, for popular
applause I did it not, for in this pregnant age, my lines appear so harsh and
disordered, that I would not have affixed my name to it, but in obedience to
those commands that so require it, and to prevent the imputation of a libeller,
the maine drift and scope I have herein aim^d at, is to discover Virginia and
Maryland, and stand up in their just defenses when caluminated, to let many
that pine in England know, they are to their ruins deluded, that are frighted
from going thither, if their ways of livelihood be not certain in England.

Postscript. A Word to the Governor and Counsel in Virginia.
Gentlemen,
AS I have done your Country of Virginia justice in standing up in its defense,
so I expect and entreat the like from you: I know ye are honest and understand
your selves; I cannot except nor speak against any of ye, but Will. Claiborne,
whom ye all know to be a Villain, but it is no more blemish to your degree, to
have him of your society, then it was to the Apostles to have Judas of theirs,
I have had injury by him by palpable cousinages done me, as I shall one day
demonstrate. But for the decree of your court against one Captain Thomas
Thoroughgood, late Commander of the Shipp Cressent. I desire you to consider of
it again and reverse it for these reasons following.

I was an inhabitant of Maryland of two years standing, proscribe to die by
the rebels of the Bay. I fled disguised to Virginia, came a board his Ship by
an unknown name, made my condition, not my person known to him, and he
charitably brought me for England, otherewise I had causlesly been put to
death. For which letters certifies us in England, that ye have amersed him in
deep penalties, by an acted of Assembly made against masters or Commanders of
ships that shall carry away any of the inhabitants of your colonie without a
pass.

First, know I was no inhabitant of Virginia, but Maryland, a government ye
have nothing to do with.

Next I came with my Governors consent, Captain William Stone who in England
justifies Captain Thoroughgoods bringing me home: and here I must and will
abide such censure or vindication as the supreme power of England shall find
me to have merited; and therefore I humbly request ye to peruse and reverse that
order against him for bringing me for England.

I shall hereafter give such an account to Virginia of my actions from time to
time, that they shall be fully satisfied; I never deserved the least injury
either from any Government, nor any private person, since I first inhabited
there. But that shall be a subject particular: and a piece not useful in
England, but only to scatter in Virginia amongst my friends, whose good opinion
I covet, and that they may know in many odiums I have been wronged, and that I
am the man that have seen affliction.

FINIS.
