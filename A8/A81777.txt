The Royal Pilgrimage.
HErodotus the Historian has left us a remarkable passage of one Sethon on
Egyptian King, who being forsaken through the baseness and pusillanimity of
his own Soldiers addressed his Devotions to the gods for deliverance, who in
answer to his Petition sent an Army of Mice into his enemy Senacribs Host,
which did eat the Quivers of the Soldiers, and the Leather which was used
about their Shields and Armor; upon which Omen Senacribs Army fled, so giving
King Sethon and his people a wonderful deliverance, which caused his Subjects
to erect an Image of Stone to the memory of Sethon, with a Mouse in his hand in
the Temple of Uulcan, with this Inscription, He that looks on me let him be
Religious. The Story is Heathen, therefore profane, yet had it been fabulous it
had borne a moral pertinent to our Sovereigns sufferings.

We must leave the application to the ingenious, and fall upon the sad rehearsal
of some remarkable persecutions, through which his Sacred Majesty has passed
during the space of 12 years, which number he has completed, since the
blessed Soul of his glorified Father was translated from this vale of misery,
to the hill of eternal happiness.

After the threnitique sorrows,

Instead of relief or consolation in this storm of sorrows, and Holland must
now no longer be his Sanctuary, but the reception of his professed Enemies, a
Den of Thieves and Murderers like the Inhabitants, and the Patient King even
in the greenness of His Greifs was forced to carry his bleeding heart into
another Nation, whose King and Princes might probably endeavor to reverge his
wrongs because they held their Veyns dignified by clayming an interest in His
highborn blood;

Wearyed with the unnatural, and unthankful Retorts which his Majesttique
merits received from the Kickshaw Court of France,

The consideration of these things as they could be no less then sad and
grievous unto his Majesty: so the formidable sequels were to be timely
prevented, for the Wasps and Hornets of his Rebels swarmed in every corner of
the Netherlands, so as their seditious infection became to be Epidemique;
David's streights, he chose rather to hazard his Royal person upon the hollow
hearts of his Scottish Subjects then longer to trust upon the Dutch false
Friends; who loved and feared him alike for his Impotency or Power.

For this purpose his undaunted Resolution betook to Scotland, in which Voyage
the Tempestuous Sea entertained him with just such Civilities, Scotland, where
his first work was to use his Solomon's wisdom to distinguish betwixt the true
and false hearts of those his Subjects, whose infidelity he had too lately
experimented, and had now no more assurance of their Loyalty then their bare
word, yet finding some regret in the multitude, he began to have a better
opinion of the Nobility, then many of them deserved, for upon narrower enquiery
he was soon satisfied that the Core and Dreggs of Rebellion remained still in
the more powerful of them, but his Majesty was reserved, and these Lords held
it policy to comply with him in popular appearance, though otherwise they
entertained and welcomed him with a double heart.

His Majesty having taken that his Kingdom and Crown upon him with such
Ceremony as that Nation could afford, finding that the Tyrannous Usurper
Cromwell did daily get ground upon him, took Council with his Nobles for a
march into England, which accordingly he undertook with a numerous Army, and
came in safety to the City of Worcester, where expecting an increase of Loyal
hearts, he was again Treacherously made accessory to his own ruin; Lesly
(upon which name the Curse of God is in all likelihood intayled) having been
according to his Country faction, beforehand corrupted by Cromwell and his
Rumpers, this sacred King was again betrayed by that damned Lesly, and through
his Majesty's own Gallantry, he was well nigh surprised by his English Rebels,
having a Horse or two slain under his Royal personage.

There then remained no hopes but withal speed to make an ingenious escape,
disguises were now his best Armor, and God who was ever with him in his
greatest need, because he had a favor toward him, was pleased to prosper the
designs of the few true-hearted Lords which were about his Majesty, so as
after many wanderings for the space of about two months, he escaped into France,
where he needed no information of that Courts could compassion toward him;
Condy and the Cardinal Mazarine, had begotten unattoneable sidings and
factions even in the great City of Paris, where the Prince became, so advanced
with his Countrymen as the Cardinal was debased in their esteem, and the
Spanish which were read, to enter the City were diverted by the great prudence
of our Sovereign: So as Statues were erected in Honor of his Majesty whom
thereon they entitled the Deliverer the Redeemer, and Savior of France.

Nevertheless they soon exspunged these Obligations, and their own
Consanguinityes were as quite forgotten, as if they had not been legitimate,
they did not only hearken to the Enchantments of his Serpentlike Enemies, but
they presently struck up an Amity and League with the Usurper of his
Inheritance, the Bloodsucker of his Glorious Father, the Trapparner of his
Loyal Subjects, and as soon as the Incendiacy, the Touch and Go of all
Devastations had struck fire upon the French Tinder, which immediately embraced
the Sparkle, the flames of Christendom, began again to break forth, and Oliver
the Demoniack toward his King, and the Elect over his Country, whom none but
the Devil and he only (by sympathetical resemblance) could endure, was now the
only favorite of France, and its Guardian Mazarixe.

Therefore his Sacred Majesty the Job like servant of God must now undergo new
persecutions, for beholding with amazement his Cozen King so French like,
mutable as neither consanguinity, Faith, nor politic prudence would keep
firmer that Prince who calls himself the most Christian King, his Majesty left
himself to his new contract with a Reed of Egypt, Oliver Cromwell, who within
the time of very few proceeding years, no man would trust for fix penniworth of
victuals, yet this Varlet raised a new storm, and his patient Christ like
Majesty must flee to act another Scene of French fortunes Inconstancy, even
where himself could find a Reception.

From France, perfideous France, This Son of heaven (not having whereon to rest
his head; to whom all sorrows were sanctified) removes into the more constant
Climate of Germany, where the Religious Emperior entertained our Sovereign Lord
with an upright heart, and a Sacred sense of his unjust persecutions, in
imitation of whose piety the inferior Princes of the Empire grew even into
emulation which of them should first enjoy his Majesty's Royal presence,
Manning a miscrerant servant, having received a sop from Satan Oliver, so
insinuated into his Dove-like Majesty as he got residency about the Kings
Bedchamber, and an unexspected interest in his Privacies, and herein the
providence of God, which had ever closely attended his Sacred Protection began
to cooperate with his Wisdom, who like a true Son of Solomon miraculously
discovered this Serpent of subtility, and Child of perdition, and in short his
Laws, Majesty who was but a so journer and no Sovereign of that Countries found
help with the Noble Duke of Newburgh to do him to death, the story is
familiarly known.

His Majesty having spent sometime amongst those Cordial Christian Princes, and
received magnificent expressions from his Emperial Majesty, he was invited by
another branch of that most Christian Austrian Family into Flanders, where the
Majesty of Spain added another golden link to that chain of Piety which all
his Christian Ancestors had worn, for some years his Majesty so journed in that
Territory, so as whatsoever his Majesty did, or undertook to do, was conveyed
by the unclean Fowls of the Air to Oliver in whom they built their Nests; But
the Devils themselves are limited and Oliver departed to his own place.

No sooner had his Son Richard swept the House, but the smaller Devils of
Oliver returned, and brought in 7 more wise then themselves, which daily so
multiplied, as by their witchcrafts, England, which was suddenly grown into
such serenity, as a cloud was scarce to be seen as big as a man's hand, when in
an instant the three Kingdoms were covered over with hideous darkness, and new
storms arise; The Devils played their own parts, and quarrelled within
themselves for Supremacy; In which combustion the Loyalty of Sir George Booth
gave light to others, and they also became illustrious, and now the remaining
Imps at home, Thurloe Satan- Olivers Clark together with his more Diabolique
Master, watered and new planted che Gatden for the Snakes, which as yet were
hidden in his Majesty's Palace where ever he removed; For the King hearing
that his Loyal Subjects about Cheshire and Wales, began to List, and embody for
his Restoration, like a true-Christian Prince, thought himself bound to
assist,, at least with his Royal presence, those valiant and loyal undertakers
of His Cause. And therefore employs one whom he had at all turns, both in
giving and forgiving, obliged to his most trusty service, but the Angels
themselves fell, and the Wall of his Servants fidelity was built of mud, and
tempered with corruption; for his Majesty's enemies (made so by the unjust
possession of his own proper Revenues) soon found the pulse of this his- Judus
like servants and they gave him money, who wanted not that but a sincere
conscience, and being by his Majesty entrusted to guide him to a safe Landing,
whereby his Majesty might with his Royal presence encourage and strengthen the
willing hands of his Loyal Subjects, Kent, where this Villain had purposely
directed him to meet his certain ruin whom God ever Guard.

But the all provident eye and hand of God defended his Sacred Majesty, and now
the God of all goodness who has tried his Majesty's Faith and constancy to
Religion and moral Virtue, as once be did Abraham's, finding a perfect heaat o
dwell in the breast of that Peerless Subject General George Monk so sanctified
his sword, yea his word as without blow or bloodshed he made the steely
affections of the South incline and fly to that magnetique Attractive of the
North, and so soon and strongly unanimous their bodies united, as it was no
more in the power of man nor of the Devil to separate the conjunction.

Nevertheless, as contagious diseases once subdued, do yet leave peccant
humors which wander and break out, yea and sometimes infect also, so it stands
after this learned cure without cutting, for diverse malicious and Phanatique
spirits floating amongst the Vulgar like the spernie and spawne of corrupt and
venomous creatures upon the waters, have cast of frothy, and filthy, and filthy
Language both against this clarified General, and his Sacred Majesty riches in
such a servant then in all the earths wealth, but they are happily gotten yet
no higher, then words; which though they be but wind are dangerous and
punishable, yet some desperado's have gone higher; For a Phanatick having
clothed and mounted himself as rich and stately as any of the Noble Attendants
which are joyfully gone to conduct up his Sacred Majesty to his Loyal people
whose Bowels yern for the fruition of him, this resolute Villain was
discovered, surprised examined and searched, about whom were found five
Pistolls each charged and laiden with a brace of Bullets the intention of the
Rogue having been to assassinate his blessed Majesty, or his faith tried
General, or both, but the furious and malicious mad Dog is chained up in
Newgate, and shall shortly be used up at Tyburn where a dead dog bytes not.

Moreland formerly an Agent for the usurping Tyrant, and one whom his close
services held in great esteem with Oliver, having also been sometimes trusted
with the List or Chain of Olivers Vermin about the King, did lately repair to
his Majesty, before whom, after he had unfainedly demonstrated his humiliation,
he drew forth the names of such Vipers and Serpents, as had in these twelve
years lived by sucking at his Royal heart blood, of whom it is said their were
above 40 to whom his own and Thurloe's hand had from time to time paid
Pensions, who are now like to get the surer wages and rewards for their Judas
like services.

Amen.

FINIS.
