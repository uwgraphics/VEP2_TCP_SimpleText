The Printer to the Reader.
BEcause the Interpretation of this Dream may be obvious to all pacities, I
have presumed, with the Authors leave, to prefix here the names of those
Countries he hints at.

1. The States of Holland. 2. High Germany. 3. The Kingdom of Naples. 4. The
Republic of Venice. 5. The Kingdoms of Spain. 6. The Kingdom of France. 7. The
Kingdoms of England, and the confusions thereof by way of Apolog. 8. The Scots.
A Winter Dream.
IT was in the dead of a long Winter night, when no eyes were open but
Watchmen, and Centinell's, that I was fallen soundly asleep, the Cinq out-Ports
were shut up closer then usually, and my senses so treble locked, that the
Moon, had she descended from her watery Orb, might have don much more to me then
she did to Endymion when he lay snoaring upon the brow of Latmus Hill; nay, (be
it spoken without profaneness) if a rib had bin taken out of me that night,
to have made a new model of a woman, I should hardly have felt it.

Yet, though the Cousin-german of Death had so strongly seized thus upon the
exterior parts of this poor Tabernacle of flesh, my inward were never more
actif, and fuller of employments then they were that night.

Pictus imaginibus, formisque fugacibus adstat
Morpheus, and variis fingit nova vultibus ora.
Me thought my soul made a sallie abroad into the world, and fetched a vast
compass; she seemed to soar up and slice the air, to cross seas, clammer up
huge Hills, and never rested till she had arrived at the Antipodes: Now some of
the most judicious Geometricians and Chorographers hold, that the whole Mass
of the Earth being round like the rest of her fellow Elements, there be places,
and poizing parts of the Continent, there be Peninsulas, Promontories and
Islands upon the other face of the Earth that correspond and concenter with all
those Regions and Isles that are upon this superficies which we tread; Countries
that symbolize with them in qualities, in temperature of air and clime, as well
as in nature of soil; The Inhabitants also of those places which are so
perpendicularly opposite, do sympathize one with another in disposition,
complexions and humors, though the Astronomers would have their East to be our
West, and so all things vice versa in point of position, which division of the
Heaven is only man's institution.

But to give an account of the strange progres my soul made that night; the
first Country she lighted on was a very low flat Country, and it was such an
odd amphibious Country, being so indented up and down with Rivers and arms of
the sea, that I made a question whither I should call it Water or Land; yet
though the Sea be invited and ushered in into some places, he is churlistly
penned out in some other: so that though he foam and swell, and appeer as high
Walls hard by, yet they keep him out, maugre all his roaring and swelling.

As I wandered up and down in this Watery Region, I might behold from a straight
long Dike whereon I stood, a strange kind of Forest, for the trees moved up
and down; they looked afar off as if they had bin blasted by thunder; for they
had no leafs at all; but making a nearer approach unto them, I found they were
a nomberlesse company of Ship Masts, and before them appeer'd a great Town
incorporated up and down with ^msterdam.
Water; As I mused with my self upon the sight of all this, I concluded, that
the Inhabitants of that Country were notable industrious peeple, who could
give Law so to the angry Ocean, and occupy those places where the great
Leviathan should tumble and take his pastime in; As my thought ran thus, I met
with a man, whom I conjectured to be 'twixt a Merchant and a Mariner, his
salutation was so homely; the air also was so foggie that me thought it stuck
like cobbwebs in his Mustachos; and he was so dull in point of motion, as if
his veins had bin filld with buttermilk in lieu of blood: I began to mingle
words with him, and to expostulate something about that Country and peeple; and
then I found a great deal of downright civilities in him: He told me that They
were the only men who did miracles of late years; Those innumerable piles of
stones you see before you in such comely neat fabriques, is a place (said he)
that from a Fish Market in effect is com to be one of the greatest Marts in
this part of the world, which has made her swell thrice bigger then she was
50. years ago; and as you behold this floating Forest of Masts before her
mole, so if you could see the foundations of her houses, you should see another
great Forest, being reared from under ground upon fair piles of timber, which
if they chance to sink in this Marshy soil, we have an art to scrue them up
again. We have for 70. years and above without any intermission, except a
short-lived truce that once was made, wrastled with one of the greatest
Potentates upon Earth, and born up stoutly against him, gramercy our two next
neighbor Kings, and their Reason of State, with the advantage of our
situation. We have fought our selfs into a free State, and now quite out of
that ancient allegiance we owed him; and though we pay 20. times more in taxes
of all sorts then we did to him, yet we are contented: We have turned War into
a trade, and that which uses to beggar others, has benefited us: Besides, we
have bin and are still the rendevous of most discontented Subjects, when by the
motions of unquiet consciences in points of Religion, or by the fury of the
sword, they are forced to quit their own Countries, who bring their arts of
Manufacture, and movables, hither; In so much that our Lombards are full of
their goods, and our banks superabound with their gold and silver which they
bring hither in specie. To secure our selfs, and cut the Enemy more work, and
to engage our Confiderats in a war with him, we have kindled fires in evry
corner; and now that they are together by the Ears, we have bin content
lately, being long wooed thereunto, to make a peace with that King to whom we
once acknowledged vassalage; which King out of a height of spirit, has spent
500. times more upon us for our reduction, then all our Country is worth; But
now he has bin well contented to renounce and abjure all claims and rights of
Soverainty over us; In so much, that being now without an Enemy, we hope in a
short time to be masters of all the comerce in this part of the world, and to
eat our Neighbors out of trade in their own Commodities: We fear nothing but
that exces of Wealth, and a surfeit of ease may make us careless and breed
quarrels among our selfs, and that our General, being married to a great
Kings daughter, may --

Here he suddenly broke the thread of his discourse, and got hastily away,
being haled by a ship that was sailing hard by.

Hereupon my soul took wing again, and cut her way through that foggy condensed
air, till she lighted on a fair, spacious, clear Continent, a generous and
rich Soil mantled up and down with large woods, where, as I ranged to and
fro, I might see diverse fair Houses, Towns, Palaces and Castles, looking like
so many Carkases, for no humane soul appeared in them; me thought I felt my
heart melting within me in a soft resentment of the case of so gallant a
Country, and as I stood at amaze, and in a kind of astonishment, a goodly
personage makes toward me, whom both for his comportment, and countenance, I
perceived to be of a finer mould then that companion I had met withal before:
by the trace of his looks I guessed he might be some Nobleman that had bin
ruined by some disaster: having acosted him with a fitting distance, he began in
a Masculin strong winded language full of aspirations and tough collision of
Consonants, to tell me as follows: Sir, I find you are a stranger in this
Country, because you stand so aghast at the devastations of such a fair piece
of the Continent, then know Sir, because I believe you are curious to carry
away with you the causes thereof, that these ruthful objects which you behold,
are the effects of a long lingering war, and of the fury of the Sword, a
cruentous civil War that has raged here ubove 30. years: one of the grounds
of it was the unfortunate undertaking of a Prince, who lived not far off in an
affluence of all earthly felicity; he had the greatest Lady to his wife, the
best purse of money, the fairest Stable of horse, and choicest Library of books
of any other of his neighbor Princes. But being by desperate and aspiring
counsels put upon a Kingdom, while he was catching at the shadow of a Crown,
he lost the substance of all his own ancient possessions: by the many powerful
alliances he had (which was the cause he was pitched upon) the feud continued
long; for among others a Northern King took advantage to rush in, who did a
world of mischiefs, but in a few years that King and he found their graves in
their own ruins near upon the some time; but now, may heaven have due thanks
for it, there is a peace concluded, a peace which has bin 14. long years a
moulding, and will I hope, be shortly put in execution; yet it is with this
fatal disadvantage, that the said Northern people, besides a mass of ready
money we are to give them, are to have firm footing, and a warm nest ever in
this Country hereafter, so that I fear we shall hear from them too often: upon
these words this noble personage fetched a deep sigh, but in such a ge^erous
manner, that he seemed to break and check it before it came half forth.

Thence my soul taking her flight over diverse huge and horrid cacuminous
mountains, at last I found my self in a great populous Town, but her
buildings were miserably battered up and down, she had a world of Palaces,
Castles, Convents and goodly Churches: as I stepped out of curiosity into one
of them, upon the West side there was a huge Grate, where a creature all in
white beckned at me, making my approach to the Grate, I found her to be a Nun,
a lovely creature she was, for I could not distinguish which was whiter, her
hue or her habit, her veil o^ her face, it made me remember (though in a dream
my self) that saying, If Dreams and wishes had been true, there had not been
found a true maid to make a Nun of ever since a Cloistered life began first
among women; I asked her the reason how so many ugly devastations should befall
so beautiful a City, she in a dolorous gentle tone, and ruthful accents, the
tears trickling down her cheeks like so many pearls, (such pearly tears that
would have dissolved a Diamond) sobb'd out unto me this speech: Gentle Sir, it is
far beyond any expressions of mine, and indeed beyond humane imagination to
conceive the late calamities which have befallen this fair though unfortunate
City, a pernicious popular Rebellion broke out here upon a sudden into most
horrid barbarismes, a Fate that hangs over most rich popular places that swim
in luxe and plenty; but touching the grounds thereof, one may say that
rebellion entered into this City, as sin first entered into the world by an
apple: For our King now in his great extremities having almost half the world
banding against him, and putting but a small tax upon a basket of fruit to last
only for a time, this fruit-tax did put the peeples teeth so on edge, that it
made them gnash against the Government, and rush into Arms; but they are
sensible now of their own follies, for I think never any place suffered more
in so short a time: the civil combustions abroad in other Kingdoms may be
said to be but small squibs compared to those horrid flakes of fire which have
raged here, and much ado we had to keep our Vestall fire free from the fury of
it: in less then the revolution of a year it consumed above fourscore thousand
souls within the walls of this City; But it is not the first time of forty,
that this luxurious foolish peeple has sma^ted for their insurrections and
insolences, and that this mad horse has o'rethrowne his Rider, and drawn a
worse upon his back; who instead of a saddle, put a packsaddle and Panniers
upon him: but indeed the voluptuousness of this peeple was grown ripe for the
judgment of heaven; she was then beginning to expostulat with me about the
state of my Country, and I had a mighty mind to satisfy her, for I could have
corresponded with her in the relation of as strange things, but the Lady
Abadesse calling her away, she departed in an instant, obedience seemed to be
there so precise and punctual.

I steered my course thence through a most delicious Country to another City
that lay in the very bosom of the Sea, she was at first nothing else but a kind
of posie made up of dainty green hillocks, tied together by above 400. bridges,
and so coagulated into a curious City; though she be espoused to Neptune very
solemnly once evry year, yet she still reserves her maydenhead, and bears the
title of the Virgin City in that part of the world; But I found her tugging
mainly with a huge Giant that would ravish her; He has shrewdly set on her
skirts, and a great shame it is, that she is not now assisted by her
Neighbors, and that they should be together by the ears when they should do so
necessary a work, considering how that great Giant is their common Enemy; and
has lately vowed seven years wars against her; specially considering, that if
he comes once to ravish her, he will quickly ruin them; She to her high honor
be it spoken) being their only rampart against the incursion of the said Giant,
and by consequence their greatest security.

From this Maiden City, me thought, I was in a trice carried over a long
gulf, and so through a Midland Sea, into another Kingdom, where I felt the
Clime hotter by some Degrees; a rough hew'n soil, for the most part, it was,
full of craggie barren hills; but where there were valleys and water enough,
the country was extraordinarily fruitful, whereby nature (it seems) made her
a compensation for the sterility of the rest. Yet notwithstanding the hardship
of the soil, I found her full of Abbeys, Monasteries, Hermitages, Convents,
Churches, and other places of devotion; As I roved there a while, I encountered
a grave man in a long black cloak, by the fashion whereof, and by the brimms of
his hat, I perceived him to be a Jesuit; I closed with him, and questioned with
him about that Country: He told me the King of that Country was the greatest
Potentat of that part of the world; and, to draw power to a greater unity,
they of our Order could be well contented, that he were universal Head over
Temporalls, because it is most probable to be effected by him, as we have
already one universal Head over Spiritualls: This is the Monark of the Mines,
I mean of Gold and Silver, who furnishes all the world, but most of all his own
Enemies with money, which money foments all the wars in this part of the
world: Never did any earthly Monark thrive so much in so short a tract of time;
But of late years he has bin illfavouredly shaken by the revolt and utter
defection of two sorts of Subjects, who are now in actual arms against him on
both sides of him at his own doors. There has bin also a long deadly feud
'twixt the next tramontan Kingdom and him, though the Queen that rules there be
his own sister, an unnatural odious thing: But it seems God Almighty has a
quarrel of late years with all earthly Potentats; for in so short a time there
never happened such strange shocks and revolutions: The great Emperor of
Ethiopia has bin outed, he and all his children by a petty companion: The King
of China a greater Emperor then he, has lost almost all that huge Monarchy by
the incursion of the Tartar, who broke ore the Wall upon him; The grand Turk
has bin strangled, with 30. of his Concubines; The Emperur of Muscovy has bin
content to beg his life of his own vassalls, and to see before his face diverse
of his chief Officers hacked to pieces, and their heads cut off and steeped in
strong water, to make them burn more bright in the market place. Besides the
above mentioned, this King has also diverse Enemies more, yet he bears up
against them all indifferently well, though with infinite expense of treasure:
and the Church, specially our Society, has stuck close unto him in these his
exigents: whence may be inferred, that let men repine as long as they will at
the possessions of the Church, they are the best anchors to a State in a
storm, and in time of need to preserve it from sinking; besides acts of
charity would be quite lost among men, did not the wealth of the Church keep
life in them: Hereupon drawing a huge pair of Beads from under his cloak, he
began to ask me of my Religion; I told him I had a long journey to go, so that
I could not stay to wait on him longer; so we parted, and me thought I was very
glad, to be rid of him so well.

My soul then made another flight over an Assembly of hideous high hills, and
lighted under another Clyme, on a rich and copious Country resembling the form
of a Losenge, but me thought, I never saw so many poor peeple in my life; I
encountered a Peasan, and asked him what the reason was, that there should be so
much poverty in a Country where there was so much plenty: Sir, they keep the
Commonalty poor in pure policy here; for being a peeple, as the world observes
us to be, that are more humerous then others, and that love variety and change,
if we were suffered to be pampered with wealth, we would ever and anon rise up
in tumults, and so this Kingdom should never be quiet, but subject to intestine
broils, and so to the hazard of any invasion: But there was of late a
devilish Cardinal, whose humor being as sanguin as his habit, and working
upon the weakness of his Master, has made us not only poor, but stark
beggars, and we are like to continue so by an eternal war, wherein he has
plunged this poor Kingdom, which war must be maintained with our very vital
spirits: but as dejected and indigent as we are, yet upon the death of that
ambitious Cardinal, we had risen up against this, who has the Vogue now,
(with whom he has left his principles) had not the fearful example of our
next transmarin Western neighbors, and the knowledge we have of a worse kind
of slavery, of those endless arbitrary taxes, and horrid confusions they have
fooled themselfs lately into, utterly deterred us, though we have twenty times
more reason to rise then ever they had: yet our great City has showed her
teeth, and gnash'd them ilfavouredly of late, but we find she has drawn water
only for her own Mill, we fare little the better, yet we hope it will conduce
to peace, which has been so long in agitation. I cannot remember how I parted
with that Peasan, but in an instant I was landed upon a large Island, and me
thought, 'twas the temperat'st Region I had been in all the while; the heat of
the Sun there is as harmles as his light, the evening serenes are as wholesome
there, as the morning dew; the Dog-daies as innocuous as any of the two
Equinoxes. As I ranged to and fro that fair Island, I spied a huge City whose
length did far exceed her latitude, but neither for length or latitude did she
seem to bear any political proportion with that Island: she looked, me
thought, like the Jesuits hat whom I had met withal before, whose brimms were
bigger then the crown, or like a petticoat, whose fringe was longer then the
body. As I did cast my eyes upwards, me thought I discerned a strange
Inscription in the air which hung just over the midst of that City written in
such huge visible characters, that any one might have read it, which was this:
Woe be to the bloody City.

Hereupon a reverend Bishop presented himself to my view, his gray hairs, and
grave aspect struck in me an extraordinary reverence of him: so performing
those complements which were fitting, I asked him of the condition of the
pla^e, he in a submisse sad tone, with clouds of melancholy waving up and down
his looks, told me; Sir, this Island was reputed few years since to have been
in the completest condition of happiness of any part on earth, insomuch that
she was repined at for her prosperity and peace by all her neighbors, who were
plunged in war round about her, but now she is fallen into as deep a gulf of
misery, and servitude, as she was in a height of felicity and freedom before:
Touching the grounds of this change, I cannot impute it to any other then to a
surfeit of happiness; now there is no surfeit so dangerous as that of happiness:
There are such horrid divisions here, that if they were a foot in hell, they
were able to destroy the Kingdom of Satan: truly Sir, there are crep'd in more
opinions among us about matters of Religion, then the Pagans had of old of the
Summum bonum, which Varro says were 300. the understandings of poor men were
never so puzzled and distracted; a great while there were two opposite powers
who swayed here in a kind of equality that people knew not whom to obey, many
thousands complied with both, as the men of Calecut who adore God and the
Devil, ( Tantum Squantum, as it is in the Indian language) the one for love,
the other for fear: there is a monstrous kind of wild liberty here that ever
was upon earth; that which was complained of as a stalking horse to draw on our
miseries at first, is now only in practice, which is mere arbitrary rule; for
now both Law, Religion, and Allegiance are here arbitrary: Touching the last,
it is quite lost, it is permitted that any one may prate, preach, or print what
they will in derogation of their anointed King: which word King was once a
Monosyllable of some weight in this I Will, but it is as little regarded now as the
word Pope (among some) which was also a mighty Monosyllable once among us: the
rule of the Law is, that the King can do no wrong, there is a contrary rule now
crept in, that the King can receive no wrong; and truly Sir, it is a great
judgment both upon Prince and peeple, upon the one, that the love of his
vassalls should be so alienated from him; upon the other, that their hearts
should be so poysond, and certainly it is the effects of an ill spirit; both the
one and the other in all probability tend to the ruin of this Kingdom. I will
illustrat this unto you, Sir, by an Apologue as follows.

There happened a shrewd commotion and distemper in the Body Natural 'twixt
the Head and the Members; not only the Noble parts (some of them) but the
common inferior organs also banded against him in a high way of unnatural
presumption; The heart, which is the source of life, with the Pericardiu^ about
it, did swell against him; the Liver, which is the shop of sanguification,
gathered ill blood* all the humors turned to Choler against him; The Arms lift
up themselfs against him, neither back, hams or knees would bow to him, nay the
very feet offered to kick him; The four and twenty ribs, the reins, the
Hypocondrium, the Diaphragma, the Miseraie, and Emulgent veins were filled with
corrupt blood against him: yea the Hypogastrium and the bowels made an
intestin war against him. While the feud lasted, it happened that these
tumultuary Members fell out among themselfs; The Hand would have all the fingers
equal, nay the toes would be of even length, and the rest of the subservient
members would be independent: They grew so foolish, that they would have the
fondament to be where the mouth is, the breast where the back, the belly where
the brain, and the yard where the nose, the sholders should be no more said to
be backwards, nor the legs downwards; A bloody quarrel fell 'twixt the Heart
and Liver, which of them received the first formation, and whither of the two
be the chiefest officine of sanguification; which question bred so much gaul
'twixt the Aristotelians and the Galenists; While this Spleen and strange
tympany of pride lasted, it cau'sd such an ebullition and heat in the mass of
blood, that it put the Microcosm, the whole Body in a high burning Fever or
Frenzy rather, which in a very short time grew to be a Heptic, and so all
perished by a fatal consumption.

I fear the same fate attends this unfortunate Island, for such as was the
condition of that natural head, this Apolog speaks of, the same is the case of
the politic Head and Body of this Island; Never was Soverain Prince so banded
against by his own Subjects, never was the patience of a Prince so put upon the
tenter; He is still no less then a Captif, his children are in banishment in
one Country, his Queen in another, the greatest Queen of blood upon earth; a
Queen that brought with her the greatest portion that ever Queen did in
treasure; yet in twenty years and upwards, her jointure has not bin settled as
it should be; nor has she bin crowned all this while according to matrimonial
Articles; notwithstanding that, for the comfort of this Nation, and the
establishment of the Throne, she has brought forth so many hopeful Princes.

But now Sir; because I see you are so attentive, and seem to be much moved at
this Discourse, as I have discovered unto you the general cause of our
calamities, which was not only a satiety, but a surfeit of happiness, so I
will descend now to a more particular cause of them; it was a Northern Nation
that brought these cataracts of mischief: upon us; and you know the old saying,

Out of the North
All ill comes forth.
Far be it from me to charge the whole Nation herewith; no, but only some
pernicious Instruments that had insinuated themselfs, and incorporated among
us, and swayed both in our Court and Counsels: They had a hand in every
Monopoly; they had out of our Exchequer, and Customs near upon 400000. Crowns
in yearly Pensions, viis and modis; yet they could not be content, but they
must puzzle the peace and policy of this Church and State: and though they are
people of differing Intellectualls, differing Laws, Customs, and Manners unto
us, yet for matter of conscience they would bring our necks into their yoke, as
if they had a greater talent of reason, and cleerer illuminations, as if they
understood Scripture better, and were better acquainted with God Almighty then
we, who brought them first from Paganism to Christianity, and also to be
reformed Christians: but it seems, matters have little thriven with them; nay
the visible hand of heaven has bin heavily upon them diverse ways since they
did lift their hands against their native King; For notwithstanding the vast
sums they had hence, yet is the generality of them as beggarly as ever they
were; besides, the Civil Sword has raged there as furiously as here, and did
as much execution among them. Moreover the Pestilence has been more violent,
and sweeping in their chief Town then ever it was since they were a peeple. And
now lately there is the notablest dishonor befaln them that possibly could light
upon a Nation, in that 7000. of ours* should upon eeven ground encounter, kill,
slay, rout and utterly discomfit thrice as many of theirs, though as well
appointed and armed as men could be: And truly Sir, the advantages that accru
to this Nation are not a few by that exploit; For of late years that Nation was
cried up abroad to be a more Martial peeple then we, and to have baffled us in
open field in diverse traverses: besides, I hope a small matter will pay now
their Arrerages here, and elsewhere; but principally, I hope they will not be so
busy hereafter in our Court and Counsel, as they have been formerly.

Another cause of our calamity is a strange race of peeple sprung up among our
selfs, who were confederat with those of the North; they would make Gods House
clean, and put out the candle of all ancient learning and knowledge; they would
sweep it only by the light of an Ignis fatuus: but it is visibly found that they
have brought much more rubbage into it; and whereas in reforming this house,
they should rather find out the gr^^^ that is lost, they go about to take away
the mite that is left, and so put Christ's Spouse to live on mere alms: true it
is, there is a kind of Zeal that burns in them, (and I could wish there were so
much piety) but this zeal burns with too much violence and presumption, which
is no good symptom of spiritual health, it being a rule, that as the natural
heat, so the spiritual should be moderat, else it commonly turns to a frenzy:
and that is the thing which causes such a giddines and distraction in their
brains; This (proceeding from the suggestions of an ill spirit) puffs them up
with so much mental pride; for the Devil is so ^^nning a Wrastler, that he
oftentimes lifts men up to give them the greater fall: they think they have an
inerring spirit, and that their Dial must needs go true, howsoever the Sun
goes: they would make the Gospel, as the Caddies make the Alchoran, to decide
all civil temporal matters under the large notion of slander, whereof they to
be the Judges, and so in time to hook in all things to their Classis: I believe
if these men were dissected when they are dead, there would be a great deal of
Quicksilver found in their brains.

Proh Superi, quantum mortalia pectora caecae
Noctis habent! --
But I could pity the giddiness of their brains, had they not so much gauls
in their breasts, were they not so thirsting after blood, so full of poison and
irreconcilable malice; in so much that it may be very well thought, these men
are a kin to that race which sprung out of the Serpents teeth: these are they
which have seduced our great Counsel, and led this foolish City by the nose to
begin and foment this ugly War, insomuch that if those numberless bodies which
have perished in these commotions, were cast into her streets, and before her
doors, many thousand Citizens noses would bleed of pure guilt.

Not to hold you long, these are the men, who have baffled common sense,
blasted the beams of nature, and offered violence to reason; these are they who
have infatuated most of the peeple of this Island; so that whereas in times
past, Tom called her the I Will of Angels, she may be termed now the I Will of
Gulls, or more properly the I Will of Dogs, or rather indeed the I Will of Wolfs,
there is such a true Lycanthropy com in among us: I am loath to call her the
Island of Devils, though she has bin branded so abroad.

To conclude Sir, the glory of this Isle is quite blasted; it is true they speak
of peace, but while the King speaks to them of it, they make themselfs ready
for battle; I much fear, that Ixion-like, we embrace a cloud for peace, out of
which there will issue out Centaures, and Monsters, as sprung out of that cloud.

Touching that ancient'st holy Order whereof you see me to be; I well hoped,
that in regard they pretended to reform things only, they would not have quite
extirpated, but regulated only this Order: it had bin enough to brayle our
wings, not to have seared them: to have lopped and pruned, not to have destroid
root and branch of that ancient tree which was planted by the hands of the
Apostles themselfs: In fine Sir, we are a lost peeple, it is no other Daedalus,
but the high Deity of heaven can clue us out of this labyrinth of confusions,
can extricat us out of this maze of miseries: the Philosopher says, it is
impossible for man to quadrat a Circle; so it is not in the power of man, but of
God alone, to make a loyal Subject of a Roundhead: Among other things that
strangers report of this Island, they say that Winter here has too many tears
in his eyes: Helas Sir, it is impossible he should have too many now, to bewail
the lamentable base slavery, that a freeborn peeple is com to: and though they
are grown so tame as to kiss the rod that whips them, yet their Taskmasters
will not throw it into the fire.

Truly Sir, as my tongue is too feeble to express our miseries, so the plummet
of the best understanding is too short to fadom the depth of them.

With this, the grave Venerable Bishop giving me his benediction, fetched such a
sigh, that would have rended a rock asunder; and suddenly vanished (me thought)
out of my sight up toward Heaven. I presently after awoke about the dawnings
of the day, when one could hardly discern Dog from Wolf; and my soul, my
Animula-vagula blandula, being re-entred through the Horn gate of sleep into
her former mansion, half tired after so long a Peregrination; and having rubbed
my eyes, distended my limms, and returned to a full expergefaction, I began to
call my self to account touching those world of objects my fancy had
represented unto me that night; and when by way of reminisence I fell to
examine and ruminate upon them; Lord, what a mass of Ideas ran in my head! but
when I called to mind the last Country my soul wandered in, me thought I felt
my heart like a lump of lead within me, when I considerd how pat every
circumstance might be applied to the present condition of England: I was
meditating with my self what kind of dream this might be; whereupon I thought
upon the common division that Philosophers make of dreams, that they are
either Divine, Diabolical, Natural, or Humane.


For the first, they are Visions more properly or Revelations, whereof there
are diverse examples in the holy Oracles of God, but the puddled cranies of my
brain are not rooms clean enough to entertain such: Touching the second kind,
which com by the impulses of the Devil, I have heard of diverse of them, as
when one did rise up out of his sleep, and fetched a poyniard to stab his
bedfellow, which he had don, had he not bin awake; Another went to the next
chamber abed to his mother, and would have ravished her; but I thank God this
dream of mine was not of that kind? Touching the third species of dreams;
which are natural dreams, they are according to the humor which predominats;
if Melancholy sway, we dream of black darksom devious places; if Phlegm, of
waters; if Choler, of frayes, fightings and troubles; if Sanguin predominat, we
dream of green fields, gardens, and other pleasant representations; and the
Physician comes often to know the quality of a disease by the nocturnall
objects of the patients fancy.

Humane dreams relate to the actions of the day past, or of the day following,
and some representations are clear and even; others are amphibious, mongrell,
distorted and squalid objects, according to the species of things in troubled
matters; and the object is clear or otherwise, according to the tenuity or the
grossnes of the vapors which ascend from the ventricle up to the brain.

Touching my dream, I think it was of this last kind; for I was discoursing of,
and condoling the sad distempers of our times the day before: I pray God some
part of it prove not prophetical; for, although the Frenchman says, Songs
sont Mensonges, dreams are delusions, and that they turn to contraries, yet
the Spaniard has a saying,

Et ciego sonnavaque via,
Yera lo que querria.
The blind man dreamt he did see light,
The thing he wished for happened right.
Insomuch that some Dreams oftentimes prove true; as S. Austin makes mention of
a rich Merchant in Milan, who being dead, one of his Creditors comes to his son
to demand such a sum of money which he had lent his father; the son was
confident 'twas paid, but not finding the Creditors Receipt, he was impleaded
and like to be cast in the Suit, had not his fathers Ghost appeared to him, and
directed him to the place where the Acquittance was, which he found the next
day accordingly. Galen speaks of one that dreamt he had a wooden leg, and the
next day he was taken with a dead Palsy in one whole side. Such a Dream was
that of William Rufus, when he thought he had felt a cold gust passing through
his bowels; and the next day he was slain in the guts, by the glance of an
arrow, in new Forest, a place where he and his Father had committed so many
Sacrileges. I have read in Artimed^rus, of a woman that dreamt she had seen the
pictures of three faces in the Moon like her self, and she was brought to bed
of three daughters a little after, who all died within the compass of a month.
Another dreamt, that Xanthus water ran red, and the next day he fell a spitting
of blood.

To this I will add another foretelling Dream, whereof I have read, which was
thus: two young Gentlemen being traveling abroad in strange Countries, and
being come to a great town, the one lay far in the City, the other in an
Hostry without the walls in the Suburbs: he in the City did dream in the dead
of night, that his friend which he had left in the Suburbs rushed into his
chamber panting and blowing, being pursued by others; he dreamt so again, and
the third time he might see his friends Ghost appeering at his beds side with
blood trickling down his throat, and a Poyniard in his breast, telling him; Dear
friend, I am come now to take my last farewell of thee, and if thou rise
betimes, thou shall meet me in the way going to be buried; the next morning his
friend going with his Host toward the Inn in the Suburbs where he left his
friend, they met with a Cart laden with dung in the way, which being staid and
searched, the dead body was found naked in the dung.

I will conclude with a notable Dream that Osman the great Turk had, not many
years since, a few days before the was murdered by his Janissaries, 1623. He
dreamt, that being mounted upon a huge Camel, he could not make him go, though
he switch'd and spurred him never so much; at last the Camel overthrew him, and
being upon the ground, only the bridle was left in his hand, but the body of
the Camel was vanished: the Mufti not being illuminated enough to interpret
this Dream, a Santon who was a kind of Idiot, told him, the Camel represented
the Ottoman Empire, which he not being able to govern, he should be overthrown,
which two days after proved true.

By these, and a cloud of examples more, we may conclude, that Dreams are not
altogether impertinent, but something may be gathered out of them; though the
application and meaning of them be denied to man, unless by special
illumination.

Somnia venturi sunt praescia saepe diei.
By Dreams we often may guess
At the next days success.
THus have you a rough account of a rambling Noctivagation up and down the
world: I may boldly say, that neither Sir John Mandevile, or Coryat himself
traveled more in so short a time: whence you see what nimble Postillions the
Animal Spirits are; and with what incredible celerity the imagination can
cross the Line, cut the Tropiques, and pass to the other Hemisphere of the
world; which shows, that humane souls have something in them of the Almighty,
that their faculties have a kind of ubiquitary freedom, though the body be
never so under restraint, as the Authors is.

The last Country that is here aimed at is known already; I leave the
application of the rest to the discerning Reader, to whom only this Dream is
addressed.

FINIS.
