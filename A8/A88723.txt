The last endeavor to preserve the Committee of Safety, presented to public
view, and censure; by a Member weary of sitting in DERBY-HOVSE.
HAving for these many days labored to reduce Colchester by violence, but in
vain, and used diverse artifices to as little purpose, to entangle the loyal
Seamen in a new engagement: It was at last resolved that the late Vice Admiral
Rainsborough have leave from Derby-house to steal away to the Navy, and there
make public acknowledgment of his errors, desiring those persons, who were
VVitnesses of his pernicious Opinions and Practices, may testify his sorrow
and repentance. This shall vote him a Traitor, and so occasion his
entertainment and admittance into some place of Trust, which he must use to the
best advantage of the Godly party. Toward the Reducing of Colchester and
Pembroke, it is resolved that the 2 blanks which were found in the Pocket of
Master Coventry, signed by the Prince of WALES, be filled up with letters to
the loyal Parties in those places, advising them to resign their several
charges upon as good terms as they may, seeing the Subscriber of those Letters,
(the Prince of Wales) is not in a condition to afford them any relief.

Let no man slight this truth because the name of the divulger is not affixed
to this Paper, for let all men know he does not fear to justify thus much,
with his life, but forbears yet, that he may be enabled to publish more of the
like nature: Thus much could not be concealed any longer without manifest
impiety, more may not yet be revealed without the imputation of indiscretion.

FINIS.
