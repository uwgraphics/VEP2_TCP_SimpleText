MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.
THE overruling hand of God having so wonderfully brought your Sacred Majesty
to Reign over us, after so long and so unjust detaining of your Rights, we
cannot but express our rejoycings in a thankful acknowledgement of his mercy
for so great a blessing, especially being accomplished without effusion of
blood; and because we cannot conceive any thing can so well provide for the
continuing safety of your Majesty and People, as the restitution of Religion,
under the ancient apostolical Government by Bishops, according to the undoubted
Laws of this Kingdom, so highly asserted by Your Royal Father of blessed
Memory; and the enjoyment of the civil Rights in the due execution of the Law;

We Therefore humbly implore your Majesty's Piety and Justice, for the full
attaining these great Ends in the settlement of Church and State, in which your
Majesty shall not want the Prayers and subservient endeavors of,

Your Majesty's most loyal Subjects of the County of Northampton. Northampton.
