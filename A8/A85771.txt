The true Copy of a Letter sent from Portsmouth by GEORGE GUILLIMS to Mr ROBERT
VVHITNEY dwelling in Herefordshire; and intercepted amongst others by some of
the PARLIAMENTS Troops:
Whereby it does plainly appear that the Papists or Malignant Party, do
seek out all ways and means to work the ruin and destruction of the
Protestants.
Noble Master,
HAving ever been ambitious to serve you, and always desirous to have you with
us, I have thought it part of my love and service to acquaint you with our
proceedings here in Portsmouth; where Colonel Goring our General has
declared himself for the King, and the whole Town and Garrison; Colonel
Goring has a Commission, for the raising of Horse and Foot from the King: And
if you please to bend your self this way, 'twill be as honorably and well
taken, as if you should bend your course to the North: also if you intend to
meet the King, I think you will as soon do it here as any where, for his
Majesty is here expected; The condition is thus, If you raise horse and bring
them in here, levy money there is as yet none allowed, but this be sure, you
shall receive your own entertainment as Captane; you shall have conduct money,
and half a crown a day for every horse; here you shall find all your old
friends, Captain Donnell Lieutenant Colonel, Captain Bellinghim, Captain
Burgess, my self, with many others of your acquaintance: stir up your self
and write to all your friends, and try how strong you can make your self, you
may write to Mr Manington and the rest of your friends the Catholics and
Divines about you, and see if they will furnish you with each a horse and a
man; as for Arms here is none, therefore you must furnish your self at Bristow
or otherwhere, for all other things, Ammunition and Artillery here is enough;
you must provide your self with two Trumpeters, if they be three they shall be
welcome; as for Arms you will have them better cheap and with less trouble at
Bristow than at London. Send this news with all speed to Captain Charles
Price, and tell him that the Lord Wentworth is our General of the horse, and
see what horse he will set you forth with, for I doubt not, but he will forward
you in the business; the journey is not long, Chichester is in the midway, but
fail not to send away a trusty Messenger whether you will come or no, that the
place may be kept open for you, for I have engaged my self that there shall be
an answer in fourteen days. Thus hoping of your respect to my care I rest with
my true love, and Captain Burgess his respect,

Your ever loving Servant to command George Guillims.
