ALl Gentlemen and others, may be pleased to take notice, that there is a
Stranger come into these parts, whose name is Peter Francesse that has brought
with him out of the Kingdom of Persia, a perfect Remedy for the Gout, the
Sciatica, the running Gout, and all Aches in the Limbs, in all parts of the
body. Also the Disease commonly called the Kings Evil, the Palsy, or any
Benumbednesse in the Limbs.

The Professor hereof does Cure all these Diseases by Plasters, without
applying any thing inwardly.

He gives ease in one hours time, and the Party shall never be troubled with
these Diseases again, after he has cured them. The truth of this many can
testify that was Cured by him twenty years ago.

You may hear of this Gentleman at the Bosoms Inn in Lawrence Lane, at the
lower end of Cheap side, or at his house in Little Moorefields, in Whites
Alley, at the corner of the Black and White House, where one of these Bills
shall stick.
