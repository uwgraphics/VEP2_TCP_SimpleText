CONSJDERATJONS of present Use concerning THE DANGER Resulting from the CHANGE
OF OUR Church Government.

CONSIDERATIONS OF PRESENT USE, concerning the danger resulting from the change
of our CHURCH GOVERNMENT.
TO Him that being satisfied in judgment of the lawfulness of Episcopal
Government, does yet conceive that the parting with it is no change of
Religion, and consequently, that the standing for it at this time, when it is
opposed, is but the preferring the interests of some inconsiderable men before
the inconveniences and common wishes of all, I earnestly desire (in the bowels
of compassion to my bleeding Country, and from a sincere passionate wish that
the cure of this dangerous wound may not be a palliate imperfect cure) to
present some few sad considerations, which I shall cast under two heads
(proportionable to the two parts of the former ungrounded suggestion, the one,
That parting with the present Government is no change of Religion; the other,
That standing for it at this time, is the preferring the interests of some
before the common wish of all, the peace of this Nation.

Concerning the former, I offer to consideration, First, whether the Government
of the Church be not a considerable part of Religion? That it is so, I shall
make appear by these reasons. 1. That Government is as necessary to the
preservation of the Church as Preaching the Gospel was to the plantation of
it, and that therefore it was always the Apostles practice, as soon as ever
they had converted a City or Province, or any considerable number of men in it,
to leave it in the hands of some faithful Persons, to dress, and tend, and
water, what they had thus planted; and therefore though it were possible for a
Christian to be deprived of this benefit, and yet to remain Christian (as to
want some limbs, or to abound to monstrosity in others, is yet reconcilable
with life and being of a man) to retain the doctrine of Christianity without
any Government, to be a Christian in the Wall or in the Wilderness, a Stylita
or Anachorite Christian, (in which case there is no doubt the use of the very
Sacraments, instituted by Christ's himself, would not be necessary to
Christianity) yet would it be little less then fury for any to design or hope
the prosperity or duration of a Church, or visible society of such Christians,
without this grand necessary (though not of single being, yet) of mutual
preservation, this principle not of essence but of continuance, without which
(it is the learned Breerewoods observation from S. Augustine) that the
preservation of a Church was once by experience found to be an impossible
thing, no other engine being able to repair the want or supply the place of
that.

A second reason may be drawn from the concurring pleas of all the most
distant pretenders for the several Forms of Government in the Church, as well
those that have espoused the Papal, the Presbyteriall, the Independent, as
those which are for the present English Form by the King and his Bishops, etc.
all vehemently contending for the necessity of that Government, which they
affect in the Church, and none so calm or modest in their claims, as the
assertors of the English Prelacy; which moderation or want of heat, is sure
one reason that so many sons of this Church are now tempted to think
Government so unconsiderable a thing, and so extrinsecall to Christianity;
though this thought thus grounded, be a double injustice, 1. In suspecting that
truth, for want of asserting, which is therefore not so vehemently asserted,
because it is a supposed truth. 2. In encouraging heat and violence of
disputers (the greatest plague in a Church) by showing them that the Eagerest
pretenders shall be most heeded, and that meekness shall not inherit the
earth, though both David and Christ promised it should. A third argument may be
had from the judgment of our State, which has thought fit to make the
Government of the Church matter of one of the Articles of our Religion, and so
to join in honor the care of it with the care of the Doctrine, and to require
as strict a subscription to the established Government, as to the rest of the
39. heads of Doctrine, by which you may evidently see, that to change the
Government is to change the Doctrine, and where Doctrine and Government both
are changed, can we possibly think the Religion to be the same? I shall add no
more Proofs of this, because I conceive them unnecessary; the contrary
misapprehension being, as I suppose, not grounded by Arguments, but of it own
accord arising from an (...), an experiment, which many men, especially persons
of quality, think they have made, that in their whole lives they never reaped
any benefit from Government, never received any accession or increase to their
spiritual weal from that, as from the Doctrine and Liturgy of the Church, they
acknowledge to have done. To this ground of misprision, as being perhaps the
(...), the cause of the whole mistake, it will not be amiss to make some
answer.

1. That many benefits we receive from Government, which we do not visibly
discern, and that therefore when we discern our selves to have received some
growth, and cannot but know that it was wrought by means, we should rather
confess our want of sense or gratitude to the true means, then imagine those
not to have been the means, only because we have not that sense of them.

2. That those means which have been more visible to us, the dispensation of
the Word and Sacraments, have been reached out to us by the hand of Government,
to which therefore we owe our acknowledgements in the second place for our
preservation and growth, as to the hand of supreme providence for our being or
life spiritual.

3. That if the benefits of Government have not been really very discernible
and notable to all, that is not yet in any justice to be imputed to any defect
that way in Government it self, to any barrennes in the nature or particular
temper of it, but to some default (which will deserve observing and reforming)
in the Persons, either of the Rulers, or of those which are under rule, or of a
third sort whose duty it is to be the Rulers perspectives and Otacousticks, to
present to their knowledge, the wants of inferiors, which till they are
known, are not likely to be repaired. The defaults in each of these severals
are, or may be, so many, and so obvious to common observation, that it will be
much more reasonable for each to resolve to amend his part for the future, and
so to make it a business of Reformation, then to charge the defaults of
persons to the defaming of Government, and so to undervalue and scorn what our
sins first, then our phansies have defamed.

The comfort is, that it has been the clemency as well as the sloth or
cowardice of Governors, which have deprived men of the great fruits of
Government, and if it may be agreed that it is very expedient, and will be
taken in good part that Governors hereafter be more severe, as well as more
diligent, more courageous, as well as more laborious, in using the Weapons of
their warfare, to cut off or to cure without any respect of persons wheresoever
there is need of them; I shall hope this objection will then be thoroughly
answered, if as yet it be not.

A second consideration apportioned to the former head will be this, whether
(supposing Government of the Church to be a considerable part of Religion) the
change of it from established Episcopacy to any other (namely to that of
Presbytery by many without any Superior over them, or as that is opposite to
Episcopacy) be not a sin against Religion? That it is, or will be so, I shall
endeavor to convince the gainsayer by these steps or degrees of proof, which
though perhaps not each single, yet all being put together, will, I believe,
where prejudice does not hinder, be sufficient to do it.

1. Because this Government by Bishops superior to Presbyters, is of
Apostolical institution. But this being an affirmation, as demonstrable by
Ecclesiastical Records, as any thing can be, or as the Canon of Scripture
which we receive, is demonstrated to be the Canon of Scripture, and in regard
it has by others been sufficiently proved, I shall therefore wholly spare the
repeating of that trouble, and add unto it, 2. That it has the example,
though not the distinct precept of Christ, who with his twelve Apostles, and
the many other Disciples in time of his residence upon Earth, superior one to
the other, are the copy, of which the Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons in the
following age, were a transcript, who are therefore by S. Ignatius, S. John's
Contemporary, allowed to receive honor, the Bishops as Christ, the Presbyters
as the Apostles, the Deacons as the Seventy. 3. That as far as concerns
superiority of one order to the other (which is sufficient to eject the
Presbytery which supposes an (...), or equality of all) it is authorized by
sacred Scripture-practice, where it appears, that when Judas fell Acts 1.
from his orb of motion, the dignity of being one of the twelve, is by the
direction of the Spirit, and by lot bestowed upon Matthias, who, though before
a Disciple of Christ, was not till then assumed to that dignity. Fourthly, that
supposing it to be in this manner Apostolical, there is little color of
reason to doubt, but that the preserving of it is of as great moment as many
doctrines of Christianity, not only because many doctrines were not so
explicitly delivered by Christ, but that they needed farther explicating by
the Apostles, (and are therefore by the Church grounded not in any words of the
Gospel, but in the Epistles of the Apostles) but also because it was in Gods
providence thought fit that Government should be settled not by Christ
personally, but by the Apostles, that is mediately by Christ; as doctrine was
by Christ immediately. Christ in his life time gives them the ground of a
Church, divine truth, the word of his Father, the acknowledgement of which is
the rock on which his Church is built, on this the Apostles are to build, and
gather members, and to settle the whole edifice (...), or ordinately, and that
they may not err in that work, the Holy Ghost is promised to descend upon
them, and Christ by that power of his to be with them in eminent manner, (...),
to the end of the world. And Government being necessary to this settling was
undoubtedly thus referred and left to them by CHRIST, and so their Authority in
instituting that which they instituted, as evidently deduced from CHRIST, as
their power of Preaching what they preached, or baptizing whom they baptized.
And having gone thus far, I cannot but resume my consideration thus far
made more considerable, and appeal to any sober conscience, whether it be not
some irreligion thus to displace or remove that which the Apostles (to whom
only by Christ it was entrusted) according to Christ's own Samplar and
Scripture-grounds, thought fit to settle in the Church, supposing it to be a
matter of Religion which is spoken of, as before we proved; nay, whether if an
Angel from Heaven were to be anathematized for teaching any other Doctrine
then what one Apostle had taught, it would not be matter of just terror to any
that should have any part in the guilt of instituting any other Government then
that which the Apostles had instituted, especially when the acts of Counsels
tell us, that what S. Paul denounces against the heterodox Angel, the Church
did practice against Aerius, anathematized him for impugning this Government,
which now we speak of. And if still the Authority of all this be blemished by
this one exception, that this institution of the Apostles is not affirmed in
Scripture, or there commanded to posterity to continue, and retain for ever.

To this I answer, by saying that which may be a fourth Argument to prove the
irreligiousnesse of such change. That there is as much or more to be said (in
both those respects, both for mention of this institution in Scripture, and for
Apostolical precept for continuing of it) for this Government, as for some
other things whose change would be acknowledged very irreligious. I will only
instance in one, the institution of the Lords day, of which there is nothing
can be said to the setting up the Authority and immutability of it, which will
not be said of Episcopacy. A ground of it there was in nature, some Time to be
set apart to the special public service of God; and the like ground there is
in nature for this, that some Persons should be designed to, and rewarded for
the special public service of God. A pattern of that there was among the
Jews, one day in the seven defined for Gods Quotum or portion; the like
pattern there is among the Jews for this; a Government by Highpriests,
Priests, and Levites. That was an institution not of Christ in his life time
immediately, but of his Apostles, after his departure invested with such power;
the like institution there is of this by the same Apostles after Christ's
ascension, directed and assisted by the holy Ghost. The occasion of pitching on
the first day of the week was a solemn action of Christ his Resurection on
that day; the occasion of this, the several distinct orders in the Church in
Christ's time, Christ, Apostles, Disciples, and the manifest superiority of him
before all of them (who affirms himself their Lord, even when he speaks of
his office ministerialll, his coming to Minister to them) and of the Apostles
before the Disciples, as even now was showed. The mention of that was found
once in the Revelation distinctly, (...), the Lords day, and twice or thrice
more in equipollent terms, the first day of the week; and the mention of
Episcopacy is as clear, the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, etc. in the
Revelation (which has been cleared by irrefragable evidence to belong to this
matter) and the Ruling Elder, in S. Paul, that must have double honor, and
Titus left in Crete to set in order the things that were wanting, and to
ordain Elders in every Church; and many other more clear mentions of the
several titles and offices of Bishop, Presbyter, and Deacon, then there is of
the name and duties of the Lords day. The obscure mentions of that in Scripture
were explained in the writings and Stories of the first age of the Church,
particularly in the Epistles of Ignatius, and the obscurities of the Sacred
text concerning Episcopacy, are as clearly explicated and unfolded by the same
Ignatius, even in every one of those Epistles of his which Vedelius (as great
an enemy of this Order as Geneva has produced any) after his fiery trial of
that Author has acknowledged to be his. The use of that continued from the
Apostles time (though not so universally till the Jewish Sabbath was fairly
laid asleep) till these days in the universal Church, and all particular
Churches, that we read of; and the like use and practice of this continued
universally without any exception from the Apostles time, till this day in the
universal Church, as that signifies the Eastern and the Western Church, and in
each particular Church till about this last Century, and in this of ours from
the plantation of the Gospel till this day. These are parallels enough to even
the balance (and I profess to know no one more which might weigh it down on
that side) and to make it now seasonable to-demand, whether it would not be
thought an act contrary to Religion (whether that signifies Christian Piety,
or meekness, or awe to all that is Sacred) for any particular national
Church, or part thereof, without any more warrant then is now offered for this
present change, to remove the service of God from the Lords day to any other
day in the week, (which sure is as small a difference, as that betwixt
Presbyteriall and Episcopal government can by any be conceived to be) or
insted of our first day of the week to set apart either an eight, or a sixth
day, and so to change that Apostolical institution. If that seem strange, or
be startled at, as unfit to be ventured on, or yielded to, I shall desire the
same plea may be entered for this, and that conscience may be secured, that
either both are lawful, or that the difference is clear, and the advantage on
the Lords days side, or that it may be resolved that this is unlawful as well
as that.

A fifth Argument will be this, That the making (or yielding to) this change,
will be a scandal (very worthy to be considered) in them that so yield,
toward those which oppose this Government as unlawful; for this yielding will
be an appearing acknowledgement, that their contrary pretentions are true, and
so a confirming them in their error, (which is no light one, but the same for
which Aerius was and any other opposer would certainly have been
anathematized, and turned out of the Catholic Church for an Heretic) which is
one special kind of Scandalizing or occasioning the fall of our Brethren, and
withal a nourishing them in their uncharitable opinion not only of us, but of
the ancient Fathers of the Church, (who were all Antichristian if this be so)
which is another causing my Brother to offend: nay a kind of countenancing that
unchristian (I am sure unprotestant) Doctrine, of the lawfulness of taking up
Arms, against lawful Superiors and established Laws, and propagating our
opinions in Religion by that means, which perchance some may be betrayed to by
this example, others brought to believe consentaneous to Protestant Doctrine,
if they which are thus guilty be thus gratified; which as it were a change in
our Doctrine, if it were really acknowledged, so is it, in this respect,
another act of Scandal, if it thus appear to be acknowledged, and that which
would make any Heathen Prince unwilling to embrace our Religion, if this
disloyal persuasion were conceived to be a part of it.

A sixth Argument (which to me is of no small force) I will yet but name, and
refer it to others to consider of, That no man is a Priest, or lawfully
ordained Minister of any Christian Church, but he that is called and sent by
God; that there is now no way in this Kingdom, to have that calling or mission
duly, but from Bishops, who are the only persons who have the power of
Ordaining others, given to them in their assumption to that Order, by those who
had it before, and can derive it from the Apostles, who had it immediately from
Heaven: and whatsoever other power a Priest, or Presbyter may be thought or
said to have common with a Bishop, it is yet the constant judgment of the
universal Church, for 1500. years, that this of Ordination is not competible
to one or more bare Presbyters without a Bishop, and it will be easy to
satisfy any reasonable man in whatsoever may be produced of sound, or
probability to the contrary: and therefore if any Office, or Order, or
Ministry in the Church be considerable, this which is the standing wellhead and
spring of all the other, must be thought so also.

Having premised these Arguments of so much weight, sufficient to support the
burden designed to them, I shall add, ex abundanti some inferior ones, though
they amount not so far, as alone of themselves to conclude it direct
irreligion, yet to add to the former heap some aggravations. As,

1. That to yield to this change, is to disclaim those blessed means of Gods
providence which brought us to our Baptism, to all our spiritual life and
growth that we have attained to, and that is a great ingratitude to that
Government.

2. It is an act of pride and insolency, to prefer any scheme of humane and
Modern invention before that which the Apostles, the Primitive, and (for so
many years) the Universal Church had authorized, and therefore I could almost
adventure to believe, that the framers of the Covenant had obliged themselves
secretly to maintain Episcopacy by putting in those words, [the best Reformed
Churches] that I might escape thinking them so insolent as to prefer any
Churches before those which they cannot but know have used Episcopacy.

3. It is a great tempting of Gods providence, in not being contented with that
Form which has prospered so happily with us, and the whole Christian World,
(though subject (as all that is humane, or mixed with flesh, is, even the very
grace of God in us) to be abused) and putting it to the adventure, whatsoever
inconveniences the next may be subject to. Of the inconveniences that
Presbytery does infallibly bring along with it, and the unreconcileablenesse
of them with Monarchical Government in the State, sufficient evidences have
been given; and if there were no other but this, that the endeavoring to bring
it in at this time has brought this tempest and (...) upon this Kingdom, and
that this has been but the general consequent of that Government wheresoever
it has but begun to heave, casting out Peace and obedience to lawful
authority together, it would well deserve to have this mark of reprobation or
non-election set upon it, if it were but for this, that the prosperity of such
attempts should not encourage others to the like. This and the like
inconveniences are of such weight, that for men to be willing to exchange the
certain benefits of the one, for the uncertain advantages and
strongly-probable calamities of the other, is a sin that may provoke and tempt
God to punish them yet further with greater and unexpected curses, and
therefore may deserve in its place to be considered.

4. Is is an Act of infidelity and practical Atheism (for those especially
who being convinced with the former reasons to acknowledge any irreligion or
sin in such change) to sacrifice any thing to our own present conveniences,
to make any change in sacred matters, merely out of intuition of our own
secular advantages; Atheism, in thinking that God cannot as easily blast that
convenience so acquired, as those many which came more directly to our hands;
and infidelity, or distrust, in thinking that God will not in his time give us
those conveniences and advantages (if they be such indeed) by means perfectly
lawful, which now we covet by unlawful. To which might be added the wants and
omissions of those duties of confession of Christ, in not defending and
standing to those truths which we are convinced to be such, in time of their
being oppugned and persecuted; selfe-denyall, in not depositing our own
carnal secular aims and interests, and of taking up the Cross, in not
suffering willingly and cheerfully when it lies in our way to the performing of
any act of obedience to Christ. But I would not enlarge to these, but only
conclude this proof with a fifth difficulty of separating sin from changes,
when they are great, and in matters of weight; It is the wisemans advice that
occasioned this observation, My Son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and
meddle not with them which are given to changes: The changes are sure changes
in Government, and those are named indefinitely, without any restraint, and the
very meddling with them that are inclined to such, is opposed both to Piety and
Loyalty, Fearing of God and the King. I have done with the considerations
proportioned to the first part of the suggestion. I proceed to the view of the
second part of it, and there the consideration shall be only this, whether,

The change of this Government, be not a common interest of all, as well as of
those who are now Clergymen. That it is so, may appear probable, because the
revenue or honors which belong to them in Government are not the sole, or main
part of Government; there is a weight and office, which our forefathers
thought worthy to be encouraged and rewarded with those payments, and if any
man shall think them ill proportioned, I shall not doubt to tell him S.
Chrysostomes judgment, that the burden of a Bishop was formidable, even to an
Angel to undergo, and if the corruptions of latter times be affirmed to have
changed that state of things, I answer, that the restoring Episcopacy to its
due burden as well as reputation, were a care worthy of reformers, and it is
so far from my desire that any such care should be spared, that it is now my
public solemn Petition both to God and man, that the power of the keys, and
the exercise of that power, the due use of confirmation, and (praevious to
that) examination, and trial of youth, a strict search into the manners and
tempers, and sufficiencies of those that are to be admitted into holy Orders,
and to be licentiate for public Preachers, the visitation of each parish in
each Diocese, and the exercise of Church Discipline upon all offenders;
together with painful, mature and sober Preaching and Catechizing, studies of
all kinds, and parts of Theological Learning, Languages, Controversies,
Writings of the Schools and Casuists, etc. be so far taken into
consideration by our Lawmakers, and so far considered in the collating of
Church-preferments and dignities, so much of Duty required of Clergymen, and
so little left arbitrary or at large, that every Church-preferment in this
Kingdom may have such a due burden annexed to it, that no ignorant person
should be able, no lazy or luxurious person willing or forward to undergo it.
And if this might be thus designed, I should then resolve, that the direct
contrary to the forementioned suggestions would be truth, that the settling and
continuing of this present Governmen would prove the common interest of all,
and only the burden of those few that have those painful offices assigned
them; and least any may think this word a boast (which I can safely venture
with the world at this time, and not have reason to fear a surprisall, or
being taken at my word) I shall venture another offer in the name of my
brethren of the Clergy; (not that I have took their particular Votes, but that
I persuade my self so far of their Piety.) That rather then the Glory should
thus depart from Israel, by the Philistims taking the Ark of the Lord, laying
wast this flourishing Church of ours, or transforming it into a new guise,
every one single of us, that have any possessions or titles worthy any man's
envy or rapine, and so are thought now by our own interests to have been bribed
or fee'd Advocates in this cause, may forthwith be deprived of all that part of
the Revenues of the Church wherein we are legally invested; and he that shall
not cheerfully resign his part in the present prosperity of the Church, on the
mere contemplation and intuition of the benefit that may now, and after his
life redound to others, let him have the guilt of Achans wedge laid on him, and
the charge of being disturber of the State. I hope we have learnt to want as
well as to abound, and to trust God (that can feed the young Ravens when the
old have exposed them) for the feeding of us, and our families, though all our
present means of doing it were taken from us, If this may serve turn to
satisfy the thirst of those that gape, and the suspicions of those that look
unkindly on us, we offer to free you from all blame of Sacrilege, ot
oppression, or injustice (from one of which, no other means imaginable can
free a change of Government) by our own voluntary Cession or risignation, as
far as our personal interests reach; and shall think the peace of this
State, and continued prosperity of this Church, a most glorious purchase, most
cheaply bought, if it may be had upon such terms as these. And if the Function
it self, with the necessary adjuncts to it, be not swept away in the calamity,
we shall be perfectly pleased whatsoever befall our Persons, and desire, that
trial may be made of the Ingenuity of Clergymen, whether we have not thus
far profited under Gods rod, as to be willing to yield to any possible
proposition (which will bring no guilt of sin upon our consciences) toward the
averting the judgments of Heaven, which are now (I wish I might say for our
sins only) most sadly multiplied upon this Land.

FINIS.
