The Copy of a LETTER Sent to the KING BY Sir Jo. Meldrum.

London, Printed for Joseph Hunscott. October. 18. 1642.

Most Gracious Sovereign,
IT is held a common Tenet, That an Apology does imply an offense; Whereof if
I were conscious to my self in the least breach of Allegiance, due to
Sovereignty, I would not blush in the ingenious acknowledgement of my
guiltiness; but would (in all humility) throw my self down at Your Majesty's
feet, though culpable in nothing else (so far as my conscience does suggest)
but of a great averseness in disposition, and a great reluctation I have had
within my self, against all the late proceedings have been attempted in Your
Majesty's Service; which (if it should be found criminal) there are not many
of Your Majesty's best advised and best affected subjects or servants of any
quality, who stand either for the glory of God, The Honor of Your Majesty, or,
The peace and happiness of the Kingdom, who (in foro conscientiae) can plead
guiltless in that point: And if there be any of a contrary sense (who are
considerable) It will appear (upon a strict search) That flattery, spleen, or
emulation, has rather transported them then any thing else, will be found
essential, to make such a breach as the Kingdom is threatened with; which
(unprevented) may bury them and their posterities in the ruins thereof. The
Zeal I have had to Your Majesty's Fathers Service in Ireland, in settling the
Province of Vlster; and to Your own Service at Rochell (which in my time has
had no example) will vindicate me from any aspersion may be cast upon me,
either of ingratitude, or disloyalty: And that all Your Majesty's favors have
produced no other effects to me, but to have been made the subject of all
calumnies, and detraction, that malice could brand me with, and a deep
engagement in 2000 l debt, after the spending of 36 years of time in Your
Majesty's Fathers and Your own Service. I did adventure upon a great freedom
of discourse with Your Majesty at Newcastle, upon the subject of War; which if
it had taken any impression (suitable to the sincerity of my heart) as a
business of so high a Nature did require, Your Majesty might have avoided many
unhappy accidents which have encountered all Your Attempts since that time;
which cannot be interpreted to have sprung from any other source, th^n from the
rashness, arrogance, and ambition of some presumptuous spirits, who have drawn
Your Majesty upon ruinous Precipices, which could not but bring forth the like
wretched effects: Their aim was at nothing so much, as at the disgrace and
overthrow of all Your Majesty's well-affected and loyal subjects and servants,
who were not stamped with the Character of the time; and to engage Your Majesty
in their unhappy Interests of ambition, gain, malice, revenge, despair, and
emulation; as if Your Majesty's Crowns, and their desperate Fortunes, had had
but one and the same Center; as if both had been cast in one Balance, to stand
or fall, in the distractions of the times. When I did look upon the lamentable
posture of three Kingdoms, reduced to a great height of desolation and misery:
When I did perceive that no corner in all Your Dominions that could afford one
good man, that was sensible of the purity of Religion toward God, of the
Honor, Peace, and Safety of Your Majesty and Kingdoms; who did not groan under
the exorbitances of the time: And when there was small probability (unless by
miracle) that Your Majesty's Diadems could retayn that ancient luster and
beauty, nor those Halcyon days of public prosperity Your loving subjects and
their Ancestors had formerly enjoyed, under the Raigns of your Royal
Progenitors (whilst they kept a regular course of Government with their
Parliaments.) I could find no better way to do Your Majesty a more agreeable
Service, then by stopping the course of a Civil War, so far as could fall
within the compass of my endeavor, to embrace any fit opportunity offered (as
to cast my self within Hull) whereby my real and affection to the public good
might be demonstrated, in a service for the common Interest of Your Majesty and
the Kingdom; which whosoever shall go about to separate, cannot but expect such
fearful events as ordinarily do accompany all such, who would entertain and
foster a woeful Divorcement betwixt a Prince and his People; a wretched
div^sion betwixt the head and the members; which (of necessity) must bring
forth prodigious issues, as may not only shake the foundation of Monarchy, but
also overflow the fertile and pleasant fields and valleys of this Kingdom
with streams of innocent blood, which might be more safely reserved for more
advantageous, and more honorable employments, then profusedly s^ent, in the
ripping up of the bowels one of another, of Your Majesty's good subjects, by
an intestine War, which will divide the father from the son, the brother from
the brother, and the nearest kinsman from his dearest friend; and that (which
is most deplorable) the ground of the War must arise from the unsettled and
unconstant appetites of some factious and turbulent spirits, overladed with the
bitterness of their own passions and interest, and at such an unseasonable
time, when a more just, and a more honorable subject for a War, cannot be long
wanting, if the unseasonable distempers of the time could allow your Majesty's
good subjects a little time to breathe in the calm air, and happiness of a
blessed peace, until such time as France and Spain (by their mutual
clashings) have so far debilitated each other, that both might run the hazard
to be made the Stage for Your Majesty's just indignation, provoked by the
affronts have been put upon Your Majesty's Father and Your Self, in the unjust
detention of the Patrimony of a Grandchild of this Crown, if there were a
happy atonement with Your Majesty's loving subjects, strongly cemented by a
strict correspondency with the Netherland Provinces, whose friendship or
immunity may do more good or hurt to these kingdoms, then the friendship or
immunity of France and Spain joined together. The miserable sense of that War
in Italy, by the pertinacious obstinacy of Charles the eighth, which was stirred
up and fomented by the ignorance and ambition of that proud Prelate, the Bishop
of S. Malo, which did draw on his shameful expulsion out of Italy, at the
expense of his reputation, and hazard of his life: The deplorable event of that
War, violently prosecuted by Charles the more hardy then wise Duke of Burgundy,
against the Swisses, which had no other ground but unmeasurable ambition, and
the refusal of redress to some of the Swisses, who had but a Cart full of
Sheepskins taken injuriously from them, going to their Market, by the Count of
Romont, which was paid home by the loss of his Baggage, by the loss of his
reputation, by the loss of his Family (which for four Generations, had stood
in competi ion with the Emperor, and the French King) and in the end, by loss
of his life. The vast and profuse consumption of more men and money, spent by
the King of Spain in that Belgic War, then might have reduced Italy and France
to that Austrian servitude (aspired unto by Charles the fifth, aiming at a fifth
Monarchy) which if it had in time been nipped in the bud, might have been
easily prevented, by hearing the humble Petitions of a handful of his
subjects, oppressed with the Tyranny of the Spanish Government, may serve as
example of terror to all great Princes, who (at the appetites of their
servants) will embark themselves in such extricable errors, as are often
accompanied with sudden and unfortunate events. Many great and honorable
Actions have been brought to happy and, glorious conclusions, by Princes who
have relied upon the valor and affection of their loving subjects; which
(being wanting) the examples of good success have been no less rare, then of
black Swans, either in ancient or modern Stories. The hearty acclamations of
joy at Your Fathers entry to the Crown of England, the public exultations at
Your Majesty's safe return from Spain, will challenge a more kindly
retribution, then the exposing of the Fortunes and lives of Your good subjects
to the inhumane butcheries of an intestine War, which (like a Gangrene) has
already overrun the greatest part of Europe, and may (by the revolution of
time, whereunto all sublunary things are subject) kindle such a fire here
amongst Your good subjects, which will not be quickly extinguished, by all the
plots and practices of the time, nor without some hazards to your Scepters.
Especially when strangers (being invited by our distractions) if they have
power, ambition, and sense of revenge, may endeavor to be sharers with Your
Maties good Subjects, in the felicities of this Island, as the only place in
Europe, which has been long exempted from the thraldom and bondage of War,
which undoubtedly they would have attempted before this time, if God (in his
gracious providence and care of this Island) had not suffered France and Spain
to be deeply embarked over head and ears: The common quarrel of invasion
which Princes never forget, if they can find an opportunity to remember, The
Jesuitick plots to extirpate the whole body of Protestants in this Island, which
(as it was in former times, the only safe Sanctuary and protection of all that
suffered under the tyranny of Rome) may (by these Machinations, rooted here too
deeply) become a Cage for unclean birds to nestle therein, and disturb the
peace of these Kingdoms, as a powerful effect of too much implicit trust put
in some, who will prove in the end Your Majesty's greatest enemies, and of too
much neglect of others, who will be found the best supporters of the dignity of
Your Person, and Crowns. And if there be a War really intended, there is a
necessity of a more solid foundation then the protection of evil and unadvised
Ministers, whom Your Majesty's Predecessor Henry the fourth of England, would
have rather offered up as public Victims to an offended Commonwealth, then that
three Kingdoms should lie pitifully exposed to the hazards of a public
conflagration; which God in his mercy avert: I must rather account him an
ignorant Mountebank then a skillfull Physician, who advises his patient to
apply a more violent remedy, then the nature of the disease will comport with,
orherwise the remedy may prove worst then the disease: Nor shall I ever account
him for a faithful servant, who persuades his Master to embrace any action,
which may more conduce to the advancement of any private interest of ambition,
gain, malice, revenge, despair, or emulation, then to the safety of his
Masters repuatiton and honor: Your Majesty does well know, the different
Characters antiquity has put upon the two favorites of Alexander, Hephestion
and Craterus, the one loved Alexander out of conscience, duty, zeal, and love
as his Sovereign, the other loved the King for his magnificence, pomp, glory,
and power; Alexander had to raise his fortune, and to make him great, not
unlike to the ^egionary Soldiers that followed Germanicus, recorded by
Tacitus, to have said fortunam meum potius quam me forebatis, or such Court
Parasits, who do rather look upon the fortunes, then persons of great Princes:
I pray God Your Majesty have not too many of the one, and too few of the other
kind of Servants; Pardon Dread Sovereign this freedom of spirit, which no
extremity, no power, no punishment can restrain, And which cannot but burst
forth in this excess of passion and grief, to see Your Majesty so inclinable
to give way to all such courses, which can presage no less then a fearful
revolation, if Your Majesty should continue in a constant course of being
inexorable to the persuasions, counsels, and petitions of Your loving
Subjects, inviting Your Majesty to adhere to your great Council of Parliament,
who are only able to make Your majesty no less happy and glorious then any of
your Royal Progenitors: God grant that in end, Your Majesty may be sensible of
the Common callamities your good Sebiects are involved in, and that some proper
occasion may be represented, whereby every true and loyal Subject may be
encouraged, to offer up his sacrifice of blood, for the honor and safety of
Your Majesty and your whole Dominions, whereof none shall be more prodigal Then

Your Majesty's most humble and faithful Servant, JO. MELDRUM.

FINIS.
