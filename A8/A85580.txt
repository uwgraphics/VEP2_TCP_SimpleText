A great and wonderful VICTORY OBTAINED By the English Forces, under the
Command of General Pen, and Genesis Venables, against the French, and others, in
the West Indies: With the manner of this great, sudden, and valiant Engagement,
the desperate Onset given by the Indian Bow-men, the bringing up of the great
Reserves by the French General, the total routing of them all immediately upon
landing, the taking of 2600 prisoners, and the number slain upon the place, the
taking of three and thirty Gold and Silver Mines, and the firing of many places
by the French, and sacrificing of their lives in the flames.

a sea battle, with ships in full sail

London, Printed for Humphrey Hutchingson, 1655.

A great and wonderful Victory obtained by the English horse and foot, under
the command of Genesis Venables, in the West Indies: With the manner how they
landed in the French Continents, the opposition made by the Natives, and
others, with their Arrows, and the taking of most of their Gold and Silver
Mines.
BY an Express brought from the Barbados to White Hall, by a Merchantman, we
understand, That Genesis Pen and Gen Venables, having been there with the Fleet,
consisting of 35 gallant ships, after few days, being supplied with 2000 foot,
and 700 horse, with all other Necessaries and Furniture of war, a general
Council were called aboard the George, where the Officers unanimously resolved
to weigh Anchor, and by the Assistance of the Almighty, to prosecute the design
in hand, according to the Commission and Instructions of his Highness the Lord
Protector. In pursuance whereof, Major Genesis Haines with his Squadron, was the
first that hoysted sail, and lanched forth amongst the cur^ed Waves; and then
immediately Valiant Pen, with Genesis Venables, and the rest of the Fleet bare up
after them; bending their course toward the Cariby I slands; where, at the
coming up of the Flag-ships, the whole Navy had a Rendevouz: And from thence
(if Report sp^aks truth) to another part of the Western Indies, where the
French were as rich as potent, and by their extreme predominancy, lamentably
over awed the English; keeping them only as mere vassals and slaves, to serve
their insatiable wills: but upon the near approach of Englands stately Armado,
great was the Allarm throughout those Isl^nds, and many were struck with such a
pannick fear, especially the Natives, that they lest many rich Commodities and
goods behind them, endeavoring to fly further up into the Countries; but the
Monsieurs remanded them back again by so^ce, causing them to imbody with sundry
darts, and saying, they would make them da^ken the Sky with Arrows: And so
drawing them up in a warlike posture, planted them and the English, (under
Command of their own Officers) at the most eminent and dangerous Passes. This
being done, the French Governor brought up his Reserves, and resolved to make
opp^sition, but the two Generals discharging some great Guns, and afterward
manning out their men so sast in long boats, that they soon forced their
passage upon Land, in which heroic A^chievment, the Volunteers (formerly
Commanders and Gentlemen of Fortune in the late Kings Army) performed singular
service, showing abundance of gallantry, and magnanimity of spirit in the very
thickest of action. And, indeed, though they are said to be but four hundred,
yet thus much (to the honor of Englishmen) may be said, that their Gallantry
(in some respect) extended as far, as the Noble Acts of Chivalry of those
four thousand soldiers at Numantia in Spain, who withstood forty thousand
Romans for fourteen years together, in which time having often valiantly
repulsed them, and forced them unto two dishonorable compositions; at last when
they could well hold out no longer, they gathered all their Armor, Money, and
Goods together, and laid them on a heap; which being fired, they voluntarily
buried themselves in the flames thereof, leaving unto Scipio nothing but the
bare name of Numantia to adorn his triumph with. In like manner, the fame of
this story (by way of circumstance) says, That some of the Monsieus, having
exceedingly enriched themselves chose rather to fire their Possessions, and
sacrifice their lives in the flames thereof, then yield and submit to a
stranger; but the major part conceiving it no way possible to withstand so
resolved an enemy, cast down their arms and cried for mercy. During which
dispute, many were killed and wounded (by estimation 300, but the number not
certainly known) and two or three thousand taken prisoners; (of all sorts and
sexes) besides, it is said, that the English are become Masters of no less then
three and thirty gold and silver Mines; which, if true, will doubtless make
our English Continent the most flourishing Commonwealth under the Sun, and
eternize their never-dying-same throughout all Ages.

And further it is said, that they have made so great an inroad into the
Country, for the space of twenty or thirty miles, that not an enemy dare not
so much as peep or show his head in any hostile manner. And by the tender
respect, affability and clemency of the English toward the poor Natives, so
great Effects have taken influence thereupon, that they are even sensible of
their present condition of Freedom, and so tractable, that upon the least
motion or sign, they become serviceable in any thing. But of this, and other
particulars, a Confirmation is suddenly expected, in case any thing has
occurred of Action, which no way yet seems unprobable, though in this juncture
of time presented somewhat dubious; by reason I had rather pre-suppose the
event of motionary action, then incur the displeasure of any by way of
detestation.

His Highness the Lord Protector, with the advice of the Council, having taken
into their gracious and serious consideration, the present estate and condition
of the Sea and Landforces, under toe command of Genesis Pen, and Genesis Venables,
have Ordered and Appointed, that a considerable number of ships be forthwith
expedited for the said service, with such provisions and Necessaries as shall
be conceived requisite: And accordingly Nine ships are now ready to be set
forth, viz. The Henry, the Maidenhead, and seven others, with Biskets, Cheese,
Butter, Beer, Beef, Pork, Pease, and diverse other Necessaries: A prosperous
Gale attend them.

FINIS.
