A Letter from Sir LEWIS DYVE: Written out of France to a Gentleman, a Friend
of his in London, etc.
TO prevent the or edit that malicious and false reports may gain, in the
opinion of those that know me not, concerning my escape out of Prison, which
the wickedness of this age is most fruitful in producing; I conceived it
necessary for me, as well for the satisfaction of my private Friends, as to
dis-abuse others, who for want of true information, may by delusions and
forgeries (wherewith the worth, God knows, has of late years been too much
abused) be led into a mis-beliefe of me, to give you this true account, both of
the occasion that induced me to thrust my self into so great a hazard, in the
attempt (wherein, by the Almighties blessing, I was in a manner miraculously
preserved) as also by what means I effected it; which I shall desire you, even
for the love which I know you bear to truth, and the particular affection
wherewith you have always been pleased to honor me, that you will, if
occasion be offered, publish this Paper unto the world, that the malice of my
enemies may not prevail; by their evil tongues to wound me behind my back, in
my honor and reputation, which I have ever held in far dearer esteem then
my life.

In the narrative, I intend brevitie, and shall not therefore look back upon
those many miseries I suffered since my first imprisonment in the Tower, nor
upon those ^eavie Oppressions wherewith I was there loaded, contrary to the Law
of Arms, the Law of Nature, and Nations; and all this for no other offense
(God is my witness) that (I either know or can imagine) those men that have
thus persecuted me, can lay to my charge, save my loyalty to my Sovereign, my
love unto my Country, in the preservation of the Laws and Liberties thereof,
and my constancy to both. For if I should begin my Story from thence, it
would fill a volume, and carry in it many bitter marks of the strange
inhumanitie of these sad times, which for the honor of this Nation I could
heartily wish, (were it possible) that both in my own case, and diverse others
of like nature, the memory might eternally be forgotten, and no record left
thereof to remain as a brand of infamy upon this people to all posterity.

It shall therefore suffice, that I begin from the time of my being removed
from the Tower, where I continued above two years, and the greatest part of
that time close Prisoner; from whence toward the latter end of last Michaelmas
Term, I was by pretense of a Habeas Corpus, procured by the subtlety of my
Adversaries, by force and violence brought before the Kings Bench Barce, by
Colonel Tichborne the Lieutenant of the Tower, upon an Action of Debt, whereas
I stood charged, and committed before for High Treason by the Speaker of the
House of Commons; a strange president, and not to be paralel'd, as I believe,
before these unhappy times: but new presidents and privileges are now every
day created at pleasure, by some of those that sit at Westminster, to the
subversion of the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and the utter ruin of
the Subjects just Liberties and Freedoms.

From the Kings Bench Bar, I was immediately turned over to be a Prisoner at
the Kings Bench, without any due Process or form of Law, not so much as one
syllable being spoken unto me, by those that fate there usurping the place of
Judges; for I have heard, That by the Laws of the Kingdom no man may execute
that Office without his Majesty's Commission whereby to authorize him so to
do, which they have not to show, nor is it to be presumed, that any such
authority can be derived from his Majesty, who is made a Prisoner by those,
whose duty it is, both by the Laws of God and the Land, to honor and obey
him, and which they have bound themselves by Solemn Oath to perform.

Now for the better illustration of the equity and justice of their
proceedings with me, in this particular; I must let you know, that before the
beginning of these unhappie troubles, I became engaged for diverse great sums
of money for the Earl of S. Albans, and for Sir Edward Stradling, who were
persons of much honor, and had that interest in me, as I should not have
refused to expose my life and fortunes whereby to have done them service, they
in a reciprocal way of friendship toward me, were so careful to preserve me
from any damage I might for the future sustain, by reason of my engagements
for them, as they made over unto me Lands of very great value, whereby to
secure and save me harmless from any encumbrances those debts might bring
upon me: with the Rents I received from these Lands, I not only satisfied the
Creditors with purctuall payment of their interest, but in a short time by
Fines and other improvements, made a shift to pay a good part of the principal
debt, and had not these miseries fallen upon the Kingdom, under which it now
languisheth, I might probably before this time have cleared the greatest part
of the whole debt.

These Lands made over to those uses as is declared, are by Ordinance of the
two Houses Sequestered, and all the profits thereof violently seized and taken
forsooth, for the use of the State, whereby the Creditors for diverse years
have been defrauded of their right, contrary to all Justice and Equity; For
this cause, and for no other that I can imagine, it was contrived by my
Adversaries to have me carried to the Kings Bench, that I might there rot in
Prison for Debt, whilst they in the mean time take unto themselves, not only
the Profits of those Lands which are liable to pay the Debts, but of all the
rest of my Estate, leaving me in that miserable condition, as I have nothing
left me to depend upon but the Almighties Providence, to preserve me and my
Children from famishing.

And if this be the Justice that our Worthy Reformers of Church and State,
hold out unto the world as a Model, whereby to take a measure of their future
Government: What can other men expect, whose case it may be as well as mine,
when they shall happen to fall into the displeasure of our new Lawmakers
(which, in truth, it is impossible to avoid, for any man that shall endeavor
to keep a good Conscience, either toward God or man) but Ruin and
Destruction to them and their Families, and in conclusion, to the whole
Kingdom?

Having thus stated the Cause of my being sent to the Kings Bench, I ^^all
proceed to the giving you a true account of my entertainment there by Sir John
Lentall until I made my escape.

When the Lieutenant of the Tower had discharged himself of me, by delivering
me over into the hands of other Jaylors, I was by them that Evening brought to
Sir John Lentall, who treated me with much civilitie; and having (as it should
seem) understood by some who had long known me, that if I would engage my
Word unto him, of being a true Prisoner, it would hold me faster then all the
Locks and Guards he could devise to put upon me: he in a very generous and free
manner proposed it unto me, telling me withal, that he had ever heard me
esteemed for a man of honor; so as, if I would engage my Word, he would
esteem it as the best Security that could be given him. The franknesse of his
proceeding prevailed with me (I must confess) even against the Resolution I
had raken, not to bind my self up by my Word, upon any Condition whatsoever:
which I yielded nevertheless to do, being overcome by his kindness; adding
this Protestation withal, That were it to save my Life, he might be confident
I would not break with him, until I should first give him fair warning, by
revoking it: Provided always, that he should put no Guards nor Keeper upon me,
which I should understand as a dis-ingagement of my Word, for that it would be
an argument unto me, that he did not rely upon it: Which he approved as
reasonable, and so I parted from him for that time, and went to provide me a
Lodging within the Rules, as might afford me best accommodation.

After this, there was seldom any day past that I came not by way of Gratitude
to visit him or his Lady, resolving in my heart not only to pay him all
Respects that was due to him from me as a Prisoner, but to requite those
Civilities I received from him, whenever I should by Gods blessing be in a
capacity to do it: Sometimes, as my Occasions required, I went abroad, which
I did openly and avowedly, not conceiving it would have been judged a Trespass
in me, more then in other men in the same Condition that I was. But it soon
grew an occasion of exception to some, who never satisfied with their own
unlimited Privileges, held it too great a one for me to breathe the common
Air with other men, and through the fears and jealousies which the guilt of
their own souls suggested unto them, did fancy my being seen abroad a
matter of most dangerous consequence, insomuch, as M. Speaker of the House of
Commons was immediately informed of it, who thereupon sent to his Brother Sir
John Lentall, giving him a strict Charge (as he told me himself) to have a
special care of me as of a most dangerous person. He therefore in a friendly
way desired me, that for his sake I would for some days forbear to be seen
abroad, until the heat of this anger were over-past, lest it might turn to
his prejudice. The answer I made him, to my best remembrance, was to this
effect; That I could not but think my self very unfortunate, after so many
miseries, to be still made the object of their malice: which since I saw I
could not otherwise avoid, but either by forfeiting my Loyalty to my
Sovereign, or betraying my own innocence, I had by Gods assistance armed my
self with that Resolution, that I little regarded what their Power could
exercise upon my person, and should esteem my Sufferings a happiness and
glory unto me in so good a Cause: so that if I restrained my self of that just
Liberty I ought to take, it was merely for his sake; wherein I would be so
careful for the future, that when the necessity of my occasions should draw
me forth, it should be with that Caution, as should give no advantage against
him: And I was so precisely careful herein, as for diverse days after I
stirred not out of the Rules.

By this Retirement, I well hoped to have taken away the occasion of troubling
their thoughts with a subject so little considerable as my self; which would
have been far better employed in perfecting the happy Reformation, so
worthily begun, and in settling a well-grounded Peace in the Kingdom, which, in
that Confusion they have now brought it, will be a Work of their best skill to
perform: But contrary to my hopes, the next news I heard, was, that it was
resolved, the fittest place to secure me, was in the Common-Goale: and I had
farther intelligence given me by two persons considerable with them, and no
strangers to their Counsels, that there were desperate intentions against me,
and therefore wished me as I tendered my Life, to make an Esc. ^^ now I had
opportunity to do it, for the means might otherwise be suddenly taken from
me.

This intelligence coming to me at so seasonable a time, and my own
innocence, besides the authority and credit of the persons from whom I
received it, made me the apter to believe it to be true (knowing that my
enemies thirst most after innocent blood) and might have prompted me
(considering the danger I was in) to have followed his Advice: but my Word
being given to Sir John Lentall, I was resolved to run the uttermost hazard of
my Life, rather then violate that in the least degree: This made me bethink my
self how I might best come off from that engagement, with least suspicion,
which the very next day was offered unto me upon this occasion.

The Warrant for my Close Commitment I knew precisely (as I said before) when
it would be brought to Sir John Lentall; and that very night, Friday the
fourteenth of January, I went (as I was formerly accustomed to do) to visit
Sir John Lentall at his own House; where, finding him sitting in conversation
with his Lady and some others of his Family, I fell into discourse with him,
and after a while I took occasion to tell him, that out of my respects to him
I had confined my self in the nature of a Close Prisoner for a good while but
that having some special occasions to draw me into the Town the next day, I
intended to go in the Evening, which should be done with that wariness, as no
notice should be taken thereof. This stroke gave fire immediately, according
to my expectation; whereupon he said, that it was in his thoughts to have
spoken unto me the next morning by way of prevention, for that diverse of the
House were so much incensed at my going abroad, as he believed there would be
an Order for my Close Imprisonment: I seemed much moved with the news, and
told him, I hoped he would not be the instrument to execute so unreasonable and
unjust an Order, having given him my Word to be his true Prisoner: Alas (said
he) what would you have me do, in case I am commanded? For as I am their
servant, if I disobey their Orders, they will thrust me out of my place, and
ruin me: By the same reason (said I somewhat tartly unto him) if they should
bid you knock out my brains, or starve me, you must then do it. He desired me
not to make such inferences, for that he knew they would command him no such
thing; but for the keeping me a Close Prisoner, in that he was bound to obey
them. When he had thus far declared himself, I held it a fit time for me to
revoke the engagement of my Word; which, that he might suppose it to be done
rather out of Choler then Design, I fell into a strange passion (not
misbecomming my Usage, though it might be thought it did my Condition) and in
great heat told him, I would not longer be engaged upon my Word, with some
other expressions of deep resentment, of the barbarous usage I had from time
to time received, but that I valued not the uttermost extremity that Tyranny
could inflict upon me: and so thrusting the Chair from me whereon I sat, I
made a short Turn in the Room, taking a Candlestick in my hand which stood
upon a side Table, and striking it with violence upon the Board, did much
bruise the fashion thereof; and all this was done in a breath, so as it seemed
but one motion.

The women that were there, were somewhat amazed at this, but the Lady Lentall
her self, who holds it a high reputation to be thought a woman of spirit, what
with the bruising of the Candlestick, and some words that fell from me, which
she interpreted to the disparagement of her Husband, though I profess they
were spoken with no such intent, grew suddenly in such a fury, as passionate
women are wont to express when they are thoroughly angered; the words that
kindled her choler, was, as I remember, somewhat that touched upon my being
turned from Jailer to Jailer, which she highly aggravated after her manner,
entering into comparisons of her Husbands worth, which I meant not in the least
to deminish; with whom being unwilling to have any dispute, the work for which
I came being performed, I went toward the door, with intention to retire to my
lodging, there to bethink my self of what more imported me; but as it
happened, her Ladyship at that time filled up the passage with her person, so
as to pass by, I took her by the hand to remove her a little out of the way,
which she took for so great an affront, that she presently cried out that I had
struck her; but the truth is, had not Sir John Lentall himself, and some of
his Daughters in the room, interposed between her and me, I verily believe it
would have fallen to my share to have complained of a beating, which I should
much better have borne from a Ladies hand, then the reproach she laid on me of
having stricken her; I then became a stickler to persuade her to patience, and
to desire her that she would not through passion do her self so much wrong,
as to say that of me, which should she swear, would never be believed by any
body that knew me, and to entreat her pardon, if by transportation of the same
passion which was now so prevalent in her self, I had either said or door any
thing that might give her the least offense; with these and the like
persuasions, we all grew after a while into a more sober temper, and then I
took my leave of them both, and was from thence well guarded to my Lodging. The
next morning, my Kinsman, Sir John Wake, came unto me, and told me for
certain, That Sir John Lentall had received an Order from the House of Commons
to remove me that night into the Common Goal; I desired Sir John Wake to go
to Sir John Lentall from me, to request this favor in my behalf, that my
removal might be suspended for a day or two until I might be able to furnish
my Lodging with Bedding and other necessaries fit for me; but the answer I
received, was, That he durst not do it for fear of the displeasure of the
House. When I saw there was no remedy, I sent to have the Chamber made clean,
and aired with a good fire, as there was good cause, for I was told by some
that saw it, that it was a most nastie and filthy room, not fit for a Dog to
lie in. Whilst this preparation was making, and a heap of Coals which lay in
the Chamber removing, the evening grew on, and my fatal hour of removing to a
quick burial; In the mean time I bespake supper, and invited diverse Gentlemen
of my acquaintance in the Rules to sup with me, to take a farewell of them, not
knowing when I should have the happiness to see them again: four or five
were pleased to come to me, to afford me that favor, all of them much
lamenting my condition: by this means there was a necessity of passing to and
fro out of my Lodging, by reason my Supper was dressed abroad. I sent for Wine,
and disposed my self to be merry with my Friends, not imparting my intentions
to any creature; always having a watchful eye, how those that were set to
guard me, were placed; with a resolution to have forced my way through them, if
there had been no other remedy: But the darkness of the Night favored my
Attempt so, as taking the nick of time when Supper was bringing in, I slipped
from my Company, and got out of the Gate unespyed, conveying my self suddenly
into a place where I knew I should be welcome, leaving my Friends to be merry
without their Host.

For some few days I lay close, until I found an opportunity to convey my
self, where by Gods blessing I have now the leisure to satisfy both you and
the rest of my Friends with this true relation of the Business; hoping there
can nothing be objected against me in the whole progress thereof, misbecomming
a man of Honor and Honesty, who desires, and shall ever, endeavor to approve
himself so in all his actions to the World, and more particularly to your
self, in the quality of,

SIR, Your affectionate humble servant, LEWIS DYVE.
