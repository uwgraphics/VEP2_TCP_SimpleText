Quest. Whither are set forms of public worship, devised and ordained by men
an acceptable worship unto the Lord?

Answ. If such set forms had been an ordinance of the Lord, and a worship
acceptable to him, the Lord himself, or at least some of the Apostles, or
Prophets, would not have held back that part of Gods Counsel, from the Church
Act. 20.26 27.
Besides, public prayer is as well a part of public Ministry, as Prophecy
is Genesis 20.7. Neb. 8.6. 1 Cor. 14.16.
and the forms of one might as justly be taught, by the precepts of men as the
other Isay. 29 13
and both of them are alike the gifts of the Holy Ghost, to whom it belongs
as well to teach us what to pray, as how to pray Romans 8.26
nor will it well stand with the holy gesture of Prayer, which is to lift up
our eyes to Heaven Ioh. 11.41 and 17.1.
to cast down our eyes upon a Book ^s. 121.1. and 123.1.

in like manner also he takes the cup, and having given thanks, he powers it
forth, and gives it to them, with a commandment to them all, to take and
drink it at the blood of Christ shed for them, and this also to do in
Remembrance of him Mat 26.26 27, 28. Lu. 22.19, 20. 1 Cor. 11.23, 24 25.
and after all thansgiving is ended with singing a Psalm Ma. 26.30, Mar. 14.26.


Quest. After the Ministry of the Word and the Seals thereof, how is the

decently Cor 14.40
and in order 1 Co. 14.40
and to edification 1 Cor 4.26


Quest. What form of Government is the Government of the Church.

Answ. The government of the Church is in Christ our head Kingly or regal Psalm
2.6. Isay 33.12
but in the Church Stewardly and Ministerial M^^ 16.19. 1 Cor. 4.11. 1 Pet
4.10.
and in both of them Spiritual and heavenly Ioh. 18.36


Quest. How does Christ exercise his Kingly Government or power in the Church?

Answ. By calling the Church into holy fellowship with himself, and one with
another Psalm. 74.2.
by ordaining Officers and Governors in his Church with their callings and
gifts Ep. 4.8.11. 1 Cor. 12 28
by giving Laws and ordinances to his Church, for the whole government of it
Isa. 3^.2. Tim 4 12. 2 Timothy 3.6, 7
By putting life and power, even the power of his spirit in all his Ordinances,
for the edifying of his body unto perfection Mat. 18 18 20 and 28.20. John

his heavenly Kingdom Romans 16 2^. John 14 27. 1 Timothy 4.8.


Quest. How is the Government of the Church in the hand of the Church
Stewardly or Ministerial?

Answ. Because the end of the Government of the Church is spiritual and
heavenly Ioh. 18.36.
as is the building of Christ's Kingdom, and saving of souls Mat. 26 19 1 Cor
5 5.
it is not in the power of men to ordain, or provide means or helps to such
ends, but only for him that can work upon the soul and conscience 2 Cor 1 24
1 Corm. 3.5.6.7.
and therefore it is not in the hand of the Church, to make Laws or
ordinances, to choose Officers or Members, to administer Saeraments or Censures
or any part of worship or Government of their own heads, but to receive all as
from the hand of Christ, and to dispense all according to the will of Christ
revealed in his Word Heb 8 5. 1 King 13 33. and 12 33. Ier. 7.31.


Quest. How is the government of the Church Spiritual and heavenly?

Answ. The government of the Church though it be not altogether inward but
partly outward Luke 17.20 21. Esaias 2, 3.
as being administered by open and known Officers Isa. 30.20.
withaudable and lively voice Rev. 1.16.
in the open face of the brethren of the Congregation Mat 18 15 1 Timothy 5 20.
yet is it in it self not of this world but Spiritual and heavenly Ioh. 18 30
as being ordained, not by the wisdom and power of this world but of Christ 1
Cor. 2.6, 7 8.
and administered not according to the precepts of men but his Commandoments Mat
28.20
not by earthly weapons, but by the Word and Sacraments, and other Spiritual
Ordinances 2 Cor. 10.4
not working upon the bodies, or outward estates of men by fines or
imprisonments loss of limbs or lives, but upon their souls and consciences,
by the evidence of the Spirit Heb 13.7 2 Cor 10.5. 1 Cor. 2 4. John 16.33 Romans
14.17.
finally not aiming at worldly peace wealth or honor, but at the
Righteousness of faith, peace of conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost(10)

Quest. To whom has Christ committed the Government of his Church?

Ans. Partly to the Body of the Church, in respect of the state or frame of it
Math. 16.19. and 18.17. Psalm. 45.19.
but principally to the Presbitery, in respect of the Order or Administration
of it 1 Timothy 5.17 and 4.14. 1 These. 5.12. Heb. 13.7 1 Cor. 12.28.

and to dismiss the Assembly, with a blessing in the Name of the Lord Number.

Quest. But has not Christ committed some power of Government to every private
member of the Church?

16.18.19
which the Lord has given, to any member of the Church to exercise mutualy
one over another Jude 20. 1 These. 5 11. 1 Co^. 1^.17.
to save some with compassion, others with fear Jude 21 22, 23.

Quest. How are the Censures of the Church to be administered?

Ans. The Censures of the Church are ordained by Christ, for the removal of
scandalls out of the Church, Mat 1.8.6. to 15. Luke 17.1, 2, 3
which if they be private, (one Brother offending another) the Offender is to
go and acknowledge his Repentance of it unto his Brother Mat. 5.23, 24.
who is then to forgive im Luke 17 4
but if the Offender neglect to do the Brother offended is to go, and
admonish and convince him of it, between themselves privately: If thereupon
the Offender be brought to Repent of his offense the Admonisher has won his
Brother But if the Offender hear not his Brother, the Brother offended is to
take with him one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every
word may be established, whether the word of Admonition, if the Offender
receive it, or the word of complaint to the Church if he refuse it, the
offended Brother is to tell the Church, if he refuse to hear the Church, then
is he to be accounted as an Heathen, and Publican Luke 17.3 Math. 18.15.16, 17.


Quest. What if the Scandalls or Offenses be public, how are they to be
removed?

Ans. By public Reproof 1 Timothy 5.20 Gal. 2.14.
and if the offenses be not only public but heinous, then the Church is to
remove the offense, by Excomunicating the Offender out of the Church 1 Cor.
5.15 1 Timothy 1.20.


Quest. How is Excomunication to be administered?

Ans. When the offense of any Brother is public, and heinous, or being private
is through the Offenders obstinacy become publicly scandalous; the Church
being met together, is in the Name and Power of the Lord Jesus, and with his
Spirit, are to deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the Flesh,
and the Salvation of his Soul, in the day of the Lord Jesus 1 Cor 5.1.4. 5,
11, 12. 2 These. 3.14. Mat. 18.17.


Quest. Is there no use of Suspension in the Church?

Ans. Not as a Church Censure or as an Act of power, but as an Act of
discretion in the Church Officers, discerning the unclean from the clean,
until they be cleansed Lev. 10.10


Quest. What is Anathama Maranatha?

Ans. It is the utmost Censure of the Church, whereby a Brother falling from
the love of Christ, into hatied against him, is cut off from fellowship with
Christ, for ever even to the coming of the Lord 1 Cor. 16.22.


Quest. Having seen what power of Government the Church has received, and
exercises within it self. Tell me now whither one Church has power of
Government over another?

Ans. No Church has power of Government over another, but each of them has
chief power within it self, and all of them equal power one with another,
every Church has received alike the power of binding and loosing, opening and
shutting the Kingdom of Heaven Mat 18.17, 18.
but one to another all of them are Sisters; Cant. 8.8.
all of them Sarahs, all of them Queens, none Hagar, none of them Concubines
Gal. 4.26. Cant. 6.8.
but by their own corruption or usurpation of others Rev 18.17.
Finally, all of them, are Candlesticks of the same precious mettell, and in
the midst of them all Christ equally walks Rev. 1.12, 13.


Quest. But if one Church have no power of Government over another, what course
is there left to Reform such corruptions, as may arise in any Church, whether
in Doctrine or practice.

Ans. The corruptions that are found in any Church, do either infect part of
the Church, or the whole body; if part only, then the part remaining sound may
either convince and reform their Brethren themselves if they be able, or if
they be not able they may at least prevail so far with them, as to send for
light to some other Church, as they of Antioch did to the Church at Jerusalem.
But if the Corruptions found in a Church do infect the whole Body, yet still
there is hope in Israel concerning this, for though one Church have not power
of Government over another, subordinate to them, yet every Church has equal
power one with another, as coordinate with them: And therefore look what power
one Brother has over another in the same Church, the same power has one
Church over another in Brotherly communion; as if one Church shall hear of any
offense in another, they may enquire the certainty of it, and thereupon send
Letters and Messengers to convince and admonish them of it. If the Church
offending do hear the Church admonishing, they have gained their Brethren,
and their own desire: If the Church hear them not, then the Church may take
one or two Churches more to assist them, in the conviction of that sin: if yet
the Church hear them not, then (upon due notice given) all the Churches
thereabouts may meet together, and after judicious inquiry into the Cause, may
by the Word of God confute and condemn such Errors, in Doctrine or practice,
as are found oftensive: to prevent the spreading, either of the Gangreene of
Heresy, or of the Leprosy of sin, and if the Church offending shall not yet
hearken to their Brethren, though the rest of the Churches have no power to
deliver them to Satan, yet they have power to withdraw from them, the right
hand of Fellowship, and no longer to hold them in the Communion of Saints, till
they approve their Repentance. By proportion, from Mat. 18, 15.16, 17. 2 These.
