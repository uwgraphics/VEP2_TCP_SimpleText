A PANEGYRIC TO HIS EXCELLENCY, The Lord General MONCK.
By Richard Farrar, Esquire
ENgland's St GEORGE, who did the Virgin Free
From Dragon's Jaws, was but a Type of Thee.
Thou (Noble George!) That Saint surpasses far;
(Moncks Name alone has quenched our Flaming War)
He, but One Dragon Slew, One Virgin Freed,
But Thou three Kingdoms have Redeemed, (Blessed Deed!)
Redeemed from numerous Dragon's Tearing Paws,
(Who Killed our King, and Trampled on our Laws)
Monsters of Monsters! (O most strange Defeat!)
And yet Thou did not either Fight or Treat.
All this so calmly, with such Silence too,
And so much Speed, Thou did Thy Self outdo.
The King is so obliged, Himself does own
It Is by Thy Conduct, He Ascends the Throne.
And our Three Nations All, All jointly do
Court Thee by Statues, and Adore Heaven too.
Three Kingdoms Thou Have United; (A new way!)
The King He thanks Thee, and the People pay
To Thee a Second Duty: Happy Thou,
To whom Three Nations unconstrained Bow.
What Powerful Charms in sweetest Harmony
Surround thy Soul, Virtues Great Prodigy?
Thy Valor has been tried by Sea and Land,
And Thou best know on either to Command.
So Worthily Thou have thy Self Behaved,
Love in the Hearts of Both Sides is Ingrav'd.
Well may Our Island Boast, to have brought Forth,
A Man so Modest, of such Mighty Worth.
Succeeding Times shall Wonder at the Fame
We Justly Give, and Celebrate thy Name.
Thy Glorious Statue (of Corinthian Brass)
Shall stand, whilst Time is Time, (the Looking-Glass
Of Thy Great Acts) And styled Thou shall be
The Guardian ANGEL of Our Monarchy.
FINIS.
