Covenant which the Lord Commanded, to be the Lord's People, and to Walk after

with the whole heart, and with the whole soul, and to perform the words of the
Covenant which are written in this Book.

LONDON: Printed for the Use of the Church. 1700.

In the Name, 1 Cor. 5, 4.
Spirit and Power of our Lord JESUS CHRIST:
WE, an escaped Remnant of poor Sinners of the Gentiles, Isa. 37.31. Judge,
20.1, 11. 1 Cor. 14.23. Deuteronomy. 29.1. 1 Samuel 7.2. Isa. 37.3. 1 Cor. 4.9. Nehem.
9.2. Ezekiel. 36.31. Rom 5.12. Jer. 5.23. Ezekiel. 16.6, 8. 1 Pet. 2.3.
knit as one Man, and assembled together in one Place, to Renew Covenant with
the Lord, and to lament after him in this Day of Trouble, Rebuke and Blasphemy;
Do before God, Angels and Men, most solemnly confess, bewail, and loath our
Selves for our Apostasy from God in Adam, and for all our abominable revoltings
in Heart and Life, as well before, as since the time of Love and Life came,
wherein we tasted that the Lord is gracious: Especially do we judge our selves,
1 Cor. 11.31. Levit. 10.3. Jer. 7.31. Ezra 9.10, 15. Neh. 13.23, 27 Mal. 2.11,
12. Hosea 6.7.
for that there have been found with us, those great Evils of offering unto the
Lord strange Fire (Worship which he commanded not) Of Marrying strangers to God
and his Covenant; and of dealing treacherously with God in his Covenant, to
follow after lying Vanities; For these, Jonah 2.8.
and all our innumerable evils, we abhor our selves before the Lord, Psalm.
40.12. Job 42.6.
as in Dust and Ashes, Neh. 9.33.
Acknowledging him to be just in all that is brought upon us, for he has done
right, but we have done wickedly: Yet mourn we not as those without hope, 1 Thessalonians. 4.13. Psalm. 107.43. Jer. 3.1, 5. Hosea 14.1, 2.
but understanding the Loving Kindness of the Lord, that he yet invites us to
return to him, we take with us words, and cry to him, Art thou not our Father,
the guide of our Youth? Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously, so
will we render thee the calves of our Lips: Thus by Faith do we look again unto
the Holy Temple, Jonah 2.4. Heb. 12.15, 16 Deuteronomy. 29.18.
and having diligently searched lest any one of us fail of the Grace of God,
that there be no root of bitterness springing up in us, to trouble us, and that
there be no Fornicatour, or profane Person as Esau: As a People prepared for
the Lord, Luke 1.17. Ezekiel. 11.18, 19
we cast away all our detestable things; And with one heart, in one way which
God has given us for our good, Jer. 32.39.
and of our children after us; We do stand this day all of us before the Lord
our God, Deu. 29.11, 15 Jer. 17.10.
the Searcher of Hearts, We, our Elders, and Deacons, and our little ones which
the Lord has given us, that we should again enter into Covenant with the Lord
our God, and into his Oath which the Lord our God makes with us this day, that
he may establish us to day for a People unto himself, and our seed with us, and
not here with us this day; that he may be unto us a God, Gal. 3.7.6, 14, 29.
and 4.28.
as he has said to us, and as he has sworn unto our Fathers, to Abraham, to
Isaac, and to Jacob, whose children we are, Isa. 44.5.
and heirs with them according to the Promise by Faith in Jesus Christ;

We do make a Covenant with the Lord by Sacrifice, giving up our selves, Psalm.
50.5. 2 Cor. 8.5. Isa. 65.23. 1 Pet. 2.5.
and our Offspring with us, unto the Lord, and unto each other by the Will of
God, to offer up spiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ, to be
built up a spiritual house, Ephesians. 2.22. 1 Timothy 3.15. Isa. 43.21. Ephesians. 3.21.
or Church of the Living God, to show forth his Praise, and give Glory to him
in this present evil World.

Now that we may keep this our Covenant and do it, Neh. 9.38.
we write it in our sight, Ezekiel. 43.11. Heb. 8.1.
and by Name express unto what we Covenant, of which this is the Sum;

To Avouch Jehovah alone for our GOD.

To choose the Written Word for our Only Rule;

To walk blameless in all the Ordinances of the Lord:

To Discharge our several Relative Duties.

First. We do through the help of the Spirit, by Covenant, 2 Cor. 3.5. 2 Chr.
30.18, 20. and 34.32. Psalm. 83.18. Matthew. 28.19.
stand to our Baptism (though not so regularly administered) into the Name of the
Living and True God, whose Name alone is Jehovah, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
these Three, The Lord, our God, Deuteronomy. 6.4.
the Lord being One Lord, Psalm 96.5.
all other Gods being Idols: This God alone we do solemnly Avouch for a God and
Father to us and our Seed, Deuteronomy. 26.17. and 4.37.
to Love him with all our heart, and with all our soul, Matthew. 12.30.
and with all our mind, and with all our strength, and to cleave to him for
ever as our God and Father in our Lord Jesus Christ, Deuteronomy. 10.20. 2 Cor. 1.2,
3. 1 Timothy 3.15. and 2.5. Jer. 23.6. Phil. 3.8, 9. 1 Cor. 1.30.
God-Man, the One Mediator between God and Men, Jehovah our Righteousness,
counting all our own Righteousness as Loss and Dung, trusting to him only for
Justification, Sanctification, and complete Salvation from the Curse of God's
Law, Gal. 3.10, 13. Matthew. 1.21.
all our Sins, and all evils whatsoever; having hope of the Resurrection of the
Body, 2 Timothy 4.18. Acts 23.6. 2 Thessalonians. 2.1.
and of coming to, and standing with him in Judgment, fully expecting
preservation to his heavenly Kingdom, to whom be Glory for ever, 2 Timothy 4.18.
and ever, Amen.

Secondly. We do, through the Help of the Spirit, 2 Cor. 3.5. Psalm. 119, 30.

Prove. 30.5. Psalm. 119.128.
by Covenant choose all the Written Word of God to be our only Rule for Faith,
and Order, so building upon the Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, and on
this Mount Sion, singing the Song of Moses and the Lamb; We shall not prefer
one part of the Word by partiallity to another, but esteeming every Word of God
to be pure, and all the Precepts concerning all things to be right, and nothing
to be refused; Romans 15.4.
We shall take whatsoever is written therein for our Learning, Reproof,
Correction, 2 Timothy 3.15, 17
and Instruction in Righteousness, as thoroughly furnishing us to all good
Works; Therefore do we hate the Apocrypha, Psalm. 119.104.128. Rev. 22.18.
and all additions of Men whatsoever, to this our only Rule; yet not accounting
that we have already attained, or are already perfect, Phil. 3.12, 13. Psalm.
119.105. Isa. 8.20.
we will reach forth to those things which are before, by the Light of the Word
waiting for the teachings of the Spirit of Truth, John 16.13.
to lead us into all Truth, in a diligent comparing Scripture with Scripture, 1
Cor. 2.13. Prove. 4.18.
till the light thereof shine more and more unto the perfect day.

Thirdly, 2 Cor. 3.5. 2 Chr. 34.31. Luke 1.6. typify'd. Eze. 40.39.43. and 46.3.
We do through the help of the Spirit, Covenant to walk blameless in all the
Ordinances which the Lord Jesus Christ has given to his Churches, both General
and Special in their appointed seasons.

1st. We shall every First day of the Week, 1 Cor. 16.2. Rev. 1.10. Psalm.
150.6. 1 Timothy 2.1. Ephesians. 3.8. Gal. 6.6.
being the Lord's Day, wait upon God in the general Ordinances of Praise,
Prayer, Preaching, and Contribution to be dispensed to all.

Praising God by singing Scripture Psalms, Hymns, 2 Chr. 29.30. Ephesians. 5.19.
Spiritual Songs and no other.

Praying to God in and by the Spirit, Romans 8.26. Col. 2.20.
without the Forms or Rudiments of Men.

Preaching by our Pastor, 1 Cor. 4.15, 16. and 12.28. 1 Timothy 6.3.
with helps appointed in the Word, to instruct us according to our form of
sound words.

Laying by us in store, as God prospers us, 1 Cor. 16.1, 2. Heb. 13.16.
that we may be ready for Contribution on all Occasions offered.

2dly, Isa. 66.23. Ezekiel. 47.12.
We shall (according to the Months) attend upon God in the special Ordinances,
Baptism, And the Lord's Supper. 1 Cor. 4.1. Typify'd. Eze. 46.19, 24.
The Seals of the Church (commonly called Sacraments) to be administered to us
only by our own Pastor.

Fellowship And Censure. Matthew. 16.19. John 20.23. Rev. 3.7.
The Keys of the Church to be exercised by our own Elders.

Baptism to be administered to us, 1 Cor. 10.1.2. with Ps. 77.17. Isa. 52.15.
with Matt. 28.19, 20. Acts 2.39, 41. 1 Cor. 7.14. and 12.13. with Gal. 3.27 1
Pet. 3.21. with 1.3.
and to all our immediate Infant Seed, by sprinkling or pouring only Water on
the Face, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;
Sealing to all their Covenant Relation to God in his Church, or putting on
Christ by Profession; and only to the Elect a saving-Relation by the sprinkling
of Christ's Blood in Justification, and pouring forth his Spirit in
Sanctification, Ezekiel. 36.25. Romans 11.7.
such alone putting on Christ to Salvation.

The Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 11.23. to the end.
In which Bread is blessed, and broken; and Wine blessed, and poured forth, Luke
22.14, 30 Numb. 28.2. Heb. 9.26.
and received by the Church met, and sitting together in the Evening time, as a
Sign to all, that in the Evening time of the World, Christ's Body was broken,
and his Blood shed for the Remission of Sins; Romans 3.24, 26.
Sealing only to the worthy Receivers their saving interest therein.

Fellowship, The Key, Acts 2.42. Isa. 26.1, 2. Jer. 51.10. 1 Pet. 3.15. 1 Cor.
14. Jude 20.
for opening the Gates of the Church to receive in the Righteous that keep the
Truth; in which there is a communication of Experience, and Knowledge, as also
of Gifts and Graces, by praying, and prophesying, for building up the Saints in
their most Holy Faith; 1 Cor. 14.34, 35.
no Woman being herein permitted to speak; for it is a shame for Women to speak
in the Church.

Censure, Rev. 1.18. 1 Cor. 4.21.
The Key for shutting the Door of the Church; consisting of Admonition,
withdrawing from, and cutting off Offenders.

Admonition, Privately given, Mat. 18.15, 17 1 Timothy 5.20. Numb. 12.14. Ezekiel.
43.11.
for private Offenses; Publicly, when the Offense relates to the Body; with
shutting up from Special Ordinances those that slight the Church, 2 These. 3.14,
15
or their own Elders, that such may be ashamed.

Withdrawing from Those that walk disorderly, 2 Thessalonians. 3.6. Romans 16.17. Ezra
10.8. Jer. 2.18, etc. Heb. 12.15, 17
cause Divisions and Offenses forsake Church Assemblies, present themselves at
any Will Worship, or despise their Birthright.

Cutting off, 1 Cor. 5.1, 5. 1 Timothy 1.20. Titus 3.10. Neh. 5.13. 2 Cor. 9.13.
And delivering to Satan such as are obstinate, Heretics, or guilty of those
sins that are scarce named among the Gentiles: To all this Discipline of Christ
we profess Willing subjection. And thus shall each one of us be in readiness to
revenge all disobedience with the Sword of the Spirit in our hands; 2 Cor.
10.4, 6. Psalm. 149.5, 9.
this Honor have all the Saints; Praise ye the Lord!

After this manner shall we call upon each other, Psalm. 122.1. Heb. 10.24.25
Number. 28.2 Exo. 20.24, 26.
to go up to the Worship of Christ in our stated Seasons, behaving our selves
in the House of God not unseemly, but as in the Presence of Christ: Joel 2.15.
2 Chr. 20.3.26.
Attending also on such other Occasional Meetings for Fasting and Thanksgiving,
as it shall seem good to the Church from the Word to appoint: So shall we keep
all the Ordinances of God's House, 1 Cor. 14.40. Ezekiel. 43.4.11. Matthew. 15.9.
Dan. 7.25. Col. 2.20, 23.
with the Times and Forms thereof, rejecting all Ordinances, Times and Forms
after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men.

Fourthly, The Spirit helping our Infirmities, 2 Cor. 3.5.
We covenant conscientiously to discharge our several Duties to the Lord in
this Body, Heb. 3.5.


We that are Officers Covenant to discharge our Duty: Deuteronomy. 29.10. 1 Pet. 5.2.
Acts 20.28. Jer. 50.8. 2 Samuel 23.3.
The Pastor willingly to feed and take the Oversight of the Flock of God;
going before them in the ways of Christ; ruling in the Fear of the Lord; and
being an Example in Faith, Love and Zeal; Titus 2.7.
preaching the Word, instant in Season, 2 Timothy 4.1, 4.
and out of Season; reproving, rebuking, exhorting with all long-suffering; not
profaning the Seals to any out of the Flock over which the Holy Spirit has
made him Overseer. Ezekiel. 44.6.13. Matthew. 7.6.
The Elders diligently to help the Pastor in Teaching, Romans 12.7, 8. Heb. 13.17.
Watching over, Ruling and Admonishing the Flock. Acts 6.2, 3.1 Tim. 3.8, 14
The Deacons faithfully to serve the Tables, waiting on that Ministry to which
they are called, using their Office well.

Furthermore, We all Covenant to discharge our several Relative Duties, Exodus
19.8.


To our Own Officers:

To our Infant Seed:

To each other singly; And

To the whole Body jointly.

Is It. Neb. 10.29. Deuteronomy. 1.13. 1 Cor. 9.7, 15. Heb. 13.17.
We Covenant to Discharge our Duty to our own Officers chosen from among our
selves; to maintain, submit to, and pray for our Pastor; to cleave to him, 2 Thessalonians. 3.1. Acts 17.34. 1 Samuel 22.23. 2 Timothy 4.2. Prove. 21.16. 1 Cor. 4.15, 16
1 Thessalonians. 5.13. 1 Cor. 4.1, 2. 2 Timothy 4.14, 15 3 John 9, 10. Psalm. 101.5.
and to abide by him, waiting upon his Ministry in Season and out of Season;
not wilfully wandering from, or forsaking it to attend upon any other; esteeming
him very highly in Love for his Works sake, as a Steward of the Mysteries of
God to us: We shall not suffer any privily to backbite, whisper, or prate
against our Pastor with malicious words, for such are to be cut off; We shall
Honor and Obey our own Elders in the Lord, not rebuking, 1 Timothy 5.1.17.19.
but entreating them as Fathers; counting them worthy of double Honor, who
rule well, especially those who labor in the Word and Doctrine; Respecting
also our Deacons and being ready for every good work to which they shall call.
Neh. 13.13. 1 Timothy 6.18.


IIdly. We Covenant to discharge our Duty to our Infant Seed; Genesis 18.19. Jude
3. Genesis 17.7, 12. Deuteronomy. 10.15.14.1, 2.
contending earnestly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints, of their
right to a relation unto God in his Church with us, and to Baptism, the Seal
thereof; We being a Spouse of Christ our Royal Husband, Mal. 2.15. 1 Cor. 7.14.
and 10.2. Eze. 16.20, 21. and 46.16, 18. Jer. 30.20. Acts 2.39. Ephesians. 2.13.
Psalm. 147.13.
All our Children therefore are his, born to him, who has promised to us
Gentiles that were afar off, that he will not thrust our children out of their
possession; but that even our children shall inherit, and be continued a holy
Seed as afore-time; that our Congregation should be established, and the Bars of
our Gates strengthened, Isa. 65.23. and 66.22. Josh. 24.16. Joel 2.16, 17.
Psalm. 90.16. Esther 10.3. Nehem. 2.10. Psalm. 101.1. Ephesians. 6.4. Prove. 22.6. 1
Chr. 28.9. 2 Chr. 29.11. and 30.6. Isa. 44.3, 5. Genesis 21.9, 12.
by the Lord's blessing our children within us; therefore will we and our House
serve the Lord, seeking as well in the Congregation, as in Secret, for the
Blessing of the Lord, and his Peace upon our children; walking before them in a
perfect way; training them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord; and
calling upon them as they grow up, to avouch the Lord for their God, and to
take on themselves the Bond of the Covenant, casting out such of them as prove
Scoffers, and despisers of their Birthright.

IIIdly, We Covenant to discharge our Duty to each other as members in
particular; 1 Cor. 12.27. 1 Pet. 1.22. Gal. 6.2. Ephesians. 4.2. Romans 12.10. Mark
13.37.
to Love one another with a pure heart fervently; to bear each others burdens,
forbearing one another, and in Honor esteeming each better than our selves; to
watch over each other, not hating our Brother by suffering sin to rest upon
him, Levit. 19.17.
but in any wise to rebuke him: We shall not consent, hearken to, Deuteronomy. 13.6,
11. Prove. 29.24.
pity, spare, nor conceal any, though dear as our own soul, that would secretly
entice us to depart from the true Faith of God in which we stand; 1 Pet. 5.12.
Heb. 3.12, 13. Acts 11.23. James 5.16. Luke 22.32. 1 Thessalonians. 4.18.
but daily will we exhort each other, with full purpose of heart to cleave unto
the Lord; praying for, strengthening and comforting one another in the ways of
Christ; no Brother wronging, nor defrauding a Brother, 1 Cor. 6.1, 8.
nor going to Law with him before unbelievers, the Saints being to judge all
matters relating to the Brethren; And consecrating our substance to the Lord,
Mic. 4.13. Esther 10.3. Romans 12.13. Acts 4.32.
we shall seek the welfare of each other, distributing to the necessities of
the Saints, according to the Example of the People of God in the Apostles
times, 1 Cor. 7.26, 27.
as far as the present distress does permit; not refusing to lay down even our
lives for the Brethren, 1 John 3.16. Psalm. 137.6.
as preferring this Sion to our chiefest Joy.

Nor shall we neglect our several relative Duties whether within the Church,
Col. 4.5.
or without.

Husbands loving their Wives, Ephe. 5.25.33. Col. 3.19. Ephesians. 5.22, 24. Col.
3.18.
not being bitter against them:

Wives being obedient to their own Husbands in the Lord:

Parents bringing up their Children in the Fear of God: Ephesians. 6.4.


Children obeying their Parents in the Lord: Ephesians. 6.1, 2.


Masters being just and merciful to their Servants: Ephesians. 6.9.


Servants and Subjects obeying their Superiors in the Lord; 1 Pet. 2.13, 25. 1 Thessalonians. 4.11. 2 Thessalonians. 3, 10, 12
All studying to be quiet, to work with their own hands, and to mind their own
business, rendering to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, Mat. 22.21.
and to God the things that are Gods, that so we may adorn the Gospel of God
our Savior. Titus 2.10.


IV. We all Covenant to discharge our Duty to the whole Church jointly, 1 Cor.
12.25.12.
as a Body of Christ.

To be holy to the Lord in all manner of Conversation;

To stand together for the Defense of the Truth;

To keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace;

To press forward in our Heavenly Course.

1st, 1 Pet. 1.15. 2 Timothy 2.4.
As a Body of Christ we shall be holy to the Lord in all manner of
Conversation; not intangling our selves with the Affairs of this Life; Zeph.
3.9. Ephesians. 5.4.
in Language seeking Purity, avoiding all foolish Talking, or Jesting, which is
not convenient; having our Speech seasoned with Salt, Col. 4.6.
that it may administer Grace to the Hearers: And we being redeemed from a vain
Conversation, 1 Pet. 1.14, 18.
shall not fashion our selves according to the former Lusts in our Ignorance,
but adorning our selves with modest Apparel, becoming People professing
Godliness, 1 Timothy 2.9. Deuteronomy. 22.5. with 1 Cor. 11.1.16. Ezekiel. 44.20. Rev. 9.7,
8. Zeph. 1.8. Isa. 3.24. Jude 23.
No Woman shall wear that which pertains to a Man, nor any Man put on a Woman's
Garment, or Covering, all that do so being an Abomination to the Lord, who will
punish all such who are clothed with strange Apparel, strange to Nature, or
strange to Scripture; therefore shall we hate even the Garment spotted with the
Flesh; Genesis 35.2. 2 Cor. 6.14. Josh. 23.12, 13. Judge. 2.1.4. 2 Chronicles.
19.2.20.35, 37. Deuteronomy. 7.3, 5. Ezra 9.14. and 10.3, 5. Neb. 13.23, 27 Mal.
2.11.15. Heb. 6.10. Levit. 18.30. Prove. 2.17. Mal. 2.14. Genesis 23. all. Ruth
1.17. 1 King 13.31.
we will not unequally Yoke our selves with Unbelievers, nor join in Affinity,
or make Leagues with such as are not in a visible relation to Christ in his
Church; nor yet shall we give our Daughters to their Sons, nor take their
Daughters to our Sons, lest our Children learn their ways, and we so mingle the
Holy Seed, that there be no Remnant of us, or escaping: Desiring also to be
married as God's People were of old, and not according to vain Customs, all
which are forbidden; avoiding as much as in us lies, being interred with
Strangers; so following the Example of the Saints, who coveted to be buried
with their own People.

2dly, As a Body of Christ we will with one Shoulder stand together to uphold
his Truth; Zeph. 3.9. Margent. Phil. 1.27. Gal. 2.5.
and that the Gospel may continue with us and our Seed, (like David serving our
Generation) we profess to strive together for all Truth, Act. 20.20, 27. Psalm.
119.128. Deuteronomy. 12.32. Mat. 5.19. Gal. 4.18. Rev. 2.13. 3.10. 2 Cor. 10.4, 7.
Col. 1.18.
counting nothing indifferent; being always zealously affected for those Truths
of Christ that are most opposed in our day; resisting steadfastly by his Word
and Spirit all Doctrines undermining the Dignity of our Lord Jesus Christ, as
King, Prophet, and Priest of his Church, that in all things he might have the
Pre-eminence; More particularly,

First, Isa. 24.5. Matthew. 2.14. Matthew. 15.9. Gal. 5.1. 1 Kin. 12.28. to the
End. Isa. 33.22. Psalm. 45.11.
We shall oppose ALL Doctrines leading to the Neglect of Christ's Ordinances;
or to the sinful imposing any Traditions, Ceremonies, Orders or Officers in the
Church, not instituted by Christ our only King, Judge and Lawgiver, who is our
Lord, and we will worship him.

Secondly, Acts 13.45, 46 with 3.22.
We shall continue heartily to abhor ALL Doctrine contradicting and Blaspheming
the Revelation of this our Prophet in his Written Word: 1 Timothy 4.1.
Chiefly those Doctrines of Devils; which deny, oppose, or prevaricate about
the Eternal Godhead of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, Joh. 10.30,
38 Acts 5.3, 4. 1 John 5.7.
so blaspheming the ever blessed Trinity in Unity.

Or that Oppose, Isa. 9.6, 7. Matthew. 1.23. 1 Timothy 3.16.
or Equivocate about the Mysterious Union of the Divine and Humane Nature in
the One Person of our glorious Mediator Jesus Christ:

Or that exalt the Light within, Jer. 10.23. Matthew. 6.23. John 1.4, 9. with
8.12.9.5. and 6.27.40.
or any other Creature, above, besides, or with Jesus of Nazareth, that was
Born of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem, in Judea; The Only True Light of the
World, and Sealed, Sent Savior of Sinners:

Or that Eclipse the Sovereignty, Romans 9.11. end. and 11.5, 7. Ephesians. 2. through
out John 1.13. 2 Timothy 1.9. Titus 3.5, 7.
Freeness, and Efficacy of Divine Grace in Election, Vocation and
Justification, all being only of Grace, without any regard had to Good foreseen
in, or done, or willed by the Creature;

Or that make void the good old righteous Law of God, Hosea 8.12. Mat. 5.17,
19. Isa. 42.21. Romans 3.19, 21. Gal. 6.16. 1 Timothy 1.5, 10. Psalm. 19.7, 9. Romans
7.12, 22:
as a Law under which all Men are born, and as a Rule of Life to all the Called
of God; The Law given to Adam in Paradise, and afterward held forth summarily
in the Ten Commandments, explained by Christ, his Apostles, and Prophets,
containing all Duties whatsoever, (Faith and Repentance not excepted) and
forbidding all manner of sin.

Or that transform the Gospel of God's Grace into a new Remedial Law, Acts
20.24. Luke 2.10, 11. Acts 13.38, 39
commanding Faith, Repentance, and sincere Obedience, as the Terms and
Conditions of our Justification: the true Gospel being a Ministration of Grace,
Romans 3.22, 28. and 5.1, 2.10.4.
freely tendering to poor sinners the Suretiship Righteousness of Christ, to be
relied upon by Faith; and imputed to them, for their full and free
Justification before God:

Or that affirm Justification is only by the Death of Christ, and consists only
in Remission of Sin: Romans 5.10, 19. and 10.4.
The Word assuring us, that Justification is as well by Christ's perfect
Obedience to the Law, Heb. 5.8, 9. Cant. 4.7. 2 Cor. 5.21. Ephesians. 5.27. 1 John
3.7.
as by his Death under its Curse, and therein the Sinner is not only forgiven,
but accounted perfectly righteous:

Or that render the Elect less children of Wrath by Nature than others, Ephesians.
2.3, 12. Romans 3.9, 19. Mark 2.17. Gal. 3.22, 23. 1 These. 1.8, 10.
by asserting their actual Justification from Eternity, or at any time before
Faith; the whole tenor of Scripture discovering that all are alike under sin,
shut up under the Law till Faith comes, Gal. 2.16. Psalm. 86.13.
by which Christ is apprehended to justify, and save even from the lowest Hell:

Or that give the least encouragement to sin: Either by affirming, Psalm. 89.31,
33 Jer. 46.28. Amos 3.2.
that the Iniquities of God's Children are not visited by Stripes consisting
with the Father's loving kindness; Or, By refusing to pray for the Pardon of
Sin, Luke 11.4. Psalm. 25.7, 11, 18. 2 Cor. 7.10, 11 Jam. 2.14. ult Jude 4 v.
Phil. 3.18, 19.
which our Lord in his Summary of Prayer has made our daily Duty: And, by
denying Repentance and Good Works to be the genuine Fruits of Faith; so turning
the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ into Lasciviousness, and causing his Cross
to be evil-spoken of:

These Doctrines shall we detest; Pro. 2.6. to 15. Psalm. 17.4.19.7. 2 Timothy
3.15.17.
Together with all, that question the Validity of any part, or the sufficiency
of the whole written Word, for perfecting the Man of God in all things
whatsoever; so reproaching our faithful Prophet who has sealed the Vision,
Mal. 2.9. Heb. 3.5, 6. Dan. 9.24. Jer. 8.8, 9.
and given us a Rule in every thing complete.

Thirdly, Continually shall we reject all Doctrines establishing Priesthoods,
Heb. 2.17.9.26.10.4, to 23.
Masses, Conditions, or any Creature Qualifications, and Confidences, for
Satisfaction, Heb. 3.1. 1 John 2.1, 2. 1 Timothy 2.5.
Mediation or Intercession with God; Christ alone being our High Priest
Propitiation and Mediator.

Therefore we will not give place by subjection, Gal. 2.5. and 5.1. 2 Timothy 2.1.
Rev. 14.1. Gal. 2.11. Rev. 2.10.3.15, 16. 1 King. 18.21. Zech. 11.8. Psalm.
69.9.119.139. 1 Cor. 4.3. Psalm. 69.7. Heb. 12.3. Psalm. 69.8. Gal. 4.16. Micah
7.1, 7. Luke 14.26. to 33.
no not for an hour, to any that would bring us into Bondage, but being strong
in the Grace which is in Christ Jesus, and showing the Father's Mark in the
Forehead, we shall withstand them to the Face, steadfastly resisting even to the
Death; Protesting against all coldness, lukewarmness, halting or indifferency
in the Cause of Christ, which things his Soul hates: The Zeal of Christ's House
having eaten us up, for his sake therefore, shall we gladly bear the
unrighteous Judgments, Reproaches and Contradictions of all sorts of sinners,
whether open Enemies, false Brethren, lukewarm Churches or Kindred according to
the flesh; professing to have counted the Cost, and willingly to deny and
forsake all, Friends, Relations, Enjoyments, and whatsoever is dear to us in
this World, Rev. 14.4. 1 Cor. 4.9, 13. Heb. 11.24, 27
that we may follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes, laying our Reputation,
Estate, Liberty, yea Life it self at the Feet of Jesus Christ, Matthew. 16.24, 27.
our Lord and Savior.

3dly, As a Body of Christ, Ephesians. 4.3. with Eze. 20.37 Gal. 5.1.
we will keep the unity of the Spirit in the Bond or Covenant of peace:
Maintaining the Privileges of this Church; every true Church consisting of so
many, and no more, 1 Cor. 14.23.
as can conveniently meet together in one place, 1 Pet. 5.3. 1 Cor. 12.28.
Ephesians. 4.16. Isa. 66.21. Jer. 3.14, 15. and 30.21. Deuteronomy. 1.13. Acts. 1.21, 26.
and 14.23. 1 Cor. 12.7. and 14.26. Rev. 2 and 3 cha. Ephesians. 4.16. with 1 Cor.
12.12, 27. Gal. 5.1. 2 Thessalonians. 2.3, 10. Rev. 2.2.12.11. Acts 15. etc.
being Christ's Clergy or Heritage, to whom he has given a power of sending
forth his Ministers, and to choose from among themselves, and to ordain their
own Officers, with Fasting and Prayer, without laying on of Hands, the glorious
Gifts attending which, being long since ceased, that Ceremony is no more to be
used, than washing of Feet, or anointing with Oil; This Privilege therefore,
with the Liberty of determining all Matters relating to this Body, we will
carefully uphold; Renouncing all Encroachments made on Faith, and Order, by
Popes, Councils, or any other whatsoever: Yet shall we not refuse Communion
with true Sister Churches, in giving, and receiving Advice, Supplies or Members:

And that we may speak the same things, 1 Cor. 1.10.
and have no Division among us, No one of us will go up and down as a Tattler,
Levit. 19.16. Prove. 20.19. 1 Timothy 5.13. Romans 16.17. Psalm. 101.
Talebearer, or Buisie-Body, speaking things which they ought not; but we
shall mark, and avoid all Persons, and Things tending to Division; Especially,
shall we refuse to receive into our House, 2 John 9, 10. Dan. 11.30. 1 Cor.
5.11. 1 Kin. 13.8.9. Psalm. 15.4. Hosea 4.15.17 2 Cor. 6.17, 18 Col. 2.20, 23.
to have any Intelligence, or eat with Apostates, or them that forsake the holy
Covenant; contemning all such vile persons; Nor will we come near to, touch,
taste or handle any Worship after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men,
whatsoever show of Wisdom and Humility it may have; 1 Cor. 1.10. and 10.17.
Ephesians. 4.4, 6.
Thus being perfectly joined in the same Mind, and in the same Judgment, we
shall be as one Bread, and one Body, in one Spirit, called in one Hope, having
one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God the Father of all, who is above all,
Ezekiel. 44.6, 9. Jer. 51.10. Psa. 66.16. and 40.9, 10. 1 Pet. 3.15. Phil. 2.1, 2.
2 Chr. 23.19.
and through all, and in us all; Therefore shall we take none into Fellowship
with us, but such as shall declare what the Lord has done for their Souls, and
openly profess their Oneness with us in Faith, and Order; rejecting all that
are visibly unclean in any thing; so shall we stand fast in the Liberty
wherewith Christ has made us free, Gal. 5.1. Mat. 11.29. Psalm. 19.13.
esteeming this Yoke of Christ easy, and his Burden light, And dreading any
wilful Breach of this Covenant, Levit. 26.25.
the quarrel of which God will avenge!

Finally, AS a Body of CHRIST in this Oneness, Phil. 3.12, 15. 2 Cor. 6.17.
Rev. 18.4.
We Covenant to press forward after such a Separation from the Men of the
World, as we are called to by God in his Word, that as Brethren we might dwell
even together in Unity, Isa. 52.11, 12. Psalm 133.
to seek and to intermeddle with all Wisdom, and to be kept from touching The
Unclean Thing: Prove. 18.1. Ps. 106.47, 48.
So giving Thanks to the Holy Name of God our Savior, and triumphing in his
Praise; We shall look for, and hasten unto the New Heavens, 2 Pet. 3.12, 13.
and the New Earth, wherein dwells Righteousness, the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus
Christ, 2 Timothy 4.1.
to be revealed at his Appearance, who will come shortly, and will not tarry;
Rev. 22.17, 20, 21.
The Spirit and the Bride say come, and let him that hears say come, even so
come, Lord Jesus, come quickly: Amen!

AND now blessing our God for establishing us a Church of Christ by Covenant,
Psalm. 105.8, 10 2 Cor. 1.21. Ephesians. 2.22. 1 Timothy 3.15. Rev. 2.7. Matthew. 5.14.
Psalm. 46.5. Matthew. 16.18. 2 Cor. 13.14.
a House for himself to dwell in, a Pillar and Ground of Truth, a Golden
Candlestick to hold forth his Light to the World; Trusting that the Lord is in
the midst of us, and that the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against us; We
commend our selves to the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Love of God, and
the Communion of the Holy Spirit, Psalm. 78.37. Col. 2.5. Isa. 45.24. 2 Cor.
12.9.
whereby our hearts shall be steadfast in this Covenant; Expecting from Christ
our Mediator, All Righteousness and Strength, Strength to supply us with all
Grace to do, Heb. 9.14, 15.
and Righteousness to pardon all our failings in this our Covenant; Gal. 2.16.
not looking to be justified by our Obedience hereto, Heb. 13.20, 21
all our Salvation being in the Blood of the Everlasting Covenant of Grace,
made with Christ for us, Isa. 55.3.
and given to us as a Free Testament: 2 Chr. 23.16. and 34.30, 32.
This Covenant being the Holy Bond of our Souls to be the Lord's People, to
walk fully after the Lord, and to keep his Commandments.

In Testimony of OUR unfeigned Sincerity herein, We make it Sure by Writing it:
Neh. 9.38. with chap. 10.16, 28 Ezekiel. 43.11. Isa. 44.5.
And We, our Elders and Deacons Subscribe it with the Hand: This Thirtieth Day
of the Eleventh Month, MDCXCIX.
THE Catechism OR, BRIEF INSTRUCTION In the Faith AND Order Of the Gospel. For
the CHURCH of CHRIST. Meeting at Horsly-Down in Southwark.

1 JOHN II. I have written unto you Fathers, because ye have known him that is
from the beginning. I have written unto you Young Men, because ye are strong,
and the Word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one: I have
written unto you, Little Children, because your sins are forgiven you for his
Name sake, and ye have known the Father.

LONDON: Printed for the Use of the Church. 1700.

THE CONTENTS OF THE Catechism.
THIS Catechism contains Seven Lessons which by degrees lead into the Knowledge
of the Truth as it is in JESUS:

The First Lesson opens with a Discovery of God, that his Awe may be upon the
Heart:

The Second Lesson speaks of the Decrees of God, and his Creation, that in some
measure they may be understood: Afterward

The Third Lesson makes known the Fall of Man, with the Bitter Fruits of it, to
humble and abase the heart before God; And then in

The Fourth Lesson, Comfort is administered from the Glad Tidings of Redemption
by the Person of Christ: And that this Salvation may not only be heard of, but
felt

The Fifth Lesson explains the Manner of the Application of this Redemption by
Faith to the Soul; which savingly experienced, will draw forth Desires to
understand

The Sixth Lesson, In which the good Old Law and Gospel of God are briefly
cleared up, and distinguished; the good knowledge whereof will lead down to

The Seventh and last Lesson, containing some Light about The great Duty of
glorifying God in his Churches; which hereafter (if God will) may be more fully
Explained: This great Duty all Christians should covet to understand, since in
the Church only can they give most Glory to Christ, and partake most of his
Glory in this Life; And through these Gates of Heaven, upright Souls have an
abundant Entrance administered to them into the Eternal Joy of their Lord and
Master; with a brief Account whereof the Catechism concludes.

The Former Part of the Catechism contains those Truths that are more generally
received, which are given in shorter Lessons, and shorter Answers, as Milk for
Babes: By the good Digestion of which the Capacity will be enlarged to receive
the Truths that follow, which are contained in larger Lessons, and longer
Answers, that the Truth might be kept in an entire Proposition, and not mangled
by many Questions; and for this there was a more special Necessity in the
instruction about glorifying God in his Churches; Which is the strong meat
belonging to them that are of more full age, who by reason of Use have their
Senses exercised to discern both good and evil: Upon this strong meat the
spiritual man will heartily feed; for only Babes and carnal feed altogether
upon Milk.

The First Lesson, Of GOD.
Question 1. WHAT are You?

Answer. By Nature I am a poor lost Sinner against God. Romans 3.9, 10 20. Ephesians.
2.1.3.12.


Question 2. What is God?

Answer. GOD is the Eternal, John 4.24. Romans 1.20. Isa. 44.24. Dan. 4.35. 1 Timothy 6.16.
Almighty Spirit, who made All things by His Power, and orders All things by
his Providence, whom no Man has seen, or can see.

GOD is known partly by Conscience within us; and by his Works without us; But
more fully by his Written Word.

Question 4. How shall we know God by Conscience within us?

Answer. GOD has shown all Men somewhat of Himself by Natural Reason, Romans
2.14, 15. Prove. 20.27. Romans 1.21.
and Conscience within them; witnessing (though darkly) that there is a Just and
Holy God.

Question 5. How do the Works of God make him known?

Answer. Psalm 8. all. Jer. 10.12. Acts 14.17. Romans 1.20.

1 Cor. 8.4.6.
The Written Word of God reveals, That there are Three in Heaven, the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and these Three are One Living and True GOD,
whose Name alone is JEHOVAH, and all other Gods are Idols.

Question 7. How can it be that there are Three Persons in the Godhead, and yet
but ONE God?

Answer. Joh 11.7, 8.9.36.26.37.19, 23, 24. Prove. 30.4, 5.
It Is impossible for any Man to comprehend the unsearchable Mystery of the
Trinity in Unity, or Three Persons in the Godhead: We should therefore readily
believe whatsoever GOD reveals of Himself in His Word, since none in all his
Creation can find him out to Perfection! 2 Chro. 20.20.


The Second Lesson About the Decrees and Creation.
Question 1. WHY did God create all things?

Answer. GOD the Father, Son, Isa. 57.15. 1 Timothy 6.16. Col. 1.16. Rev. 4.11.
and Holy Spirit, Blessed and Happy in the Enjoyment of Himself from all
Eternity, Decreed to Create all things, to show forth his Glory in Christ Jesus.

Question 2. What are God's Eternal Decrees?

Answer. Acts 15.18.17.26. Isa. 14.24.46.10.

GOD made Angels and Man, and all things very good.

Question 7. What are Angels?

Answer. Heb. 1.7.14. Psalm. 103.20.104.4.
Angles are Ministering Spirits, mighty in Strength, to wait about the Throne of
GOD, and to do all his Commands.

Question 8. What Creature is Man?

Answer. GOD formed Man of the Dust of the ground, Genesis 2.7. Matthew. 10.28. Genesis
1.27. Eccl. 7.29. Genesis 3.20.
and gave him an immortal Soul; so God created Man in his own Image, upright,
Male and Female Created he them, and they were called Adam and Eve.

Question 9. What did God do with Man when he made him?

Answer. The Lord God took Man, and put him into the Garden of Eden, Genesis
2.8.16, 17
and gave him a Law Note, 'Twas a Law given to Man, not a Covenant of Works
made with Man.
, forbidding him to eat of the Tree of Knowledge: for in the day he eat thereof
he should surely die.

The Third Lesson. About the Fall, and the Fruits of it.
Question 1. HOW long did Man continue Upright?

Answer. Man that was in Honor, Ps. 49.12. Heb. Genesis 3.6. Eccl. 7.29.
abode not for a Night, but by sinning against God, fell from his Innocence and
Uprightness.

Question 2, How came Man to fall by Sin?

Answer. Man being left to the Freedom of his own Will, Ge. 3.6, 7, 8, 13
fell into Sin through the Temptation of that old Serpent, John 8.44.
the Devil, in transgressing the Law given him by God.

Question 3. What Creature is the Devil?

Answer. Job 4.18. 2 Pet. 2.4. Jude 6. 1 Timothy 3.6. 1 Pet. 5.8.
The Devil was once an Angel of Light, but rebelling against GOD, and drawing
other Angels with him, they were all condemned into Hell for their Pride; and
now these Devils go about as roaring Lions seeking whom they may devour.

Question 4. What was that Sin by which the Devil tempted Man to fall from God?

Answer. The Devil in the Serpent tempted the Woman to eat of the forbidden
fruit, Genesis 3.1. to 7. 1 Timothy 2.14. 2 Cor. 11.3.
and She, being first deceived, tempted her Husband to eat with her, by which
they both fell from God.

Question 5. What followed Man's falling from God?

Answer. Genesis 2.17.3.16.19. Romans 5.12.8.22.
Adam and Eve falling from GOD, received the Sentence of Death, that is,
dreadful Misery to themselves, to their Posterity, and to all the Creation
subjected to them.

Question 6. What special Misery came on Adam and Eve by the Pall?

Answer. As Soon as Adam and Eve fell they died spiritually, Romans 3.24. Genesis
3.7, 10.16.19.23.24.
that is, they lost the Image of GOD in their Souls, and they saw that they
were Naked, or exposed to all manner of Death, and were driven out of Paradise.

Question 7. What Misery came on Adams Posterity by his Fall?

Answer. All Mankind being the Sons and Daughters of Adam, 1 Co. 15.21, 22 Romans
5.12, 14, 17, 18.
and in his Loins, sinned in him, and so Death past upon them all, therefore
all are born in spiritual Death, under the Sentence of eternal Death, and
undergo the natural death of the Body.

Question 8. I find then that the death of the Body is the fruit of Sin; But
what is that spiritual Death all are born in?

Answer. The spiritual death all are born in, Romans 3.9, 19. Psalm. 51.5. Romans
3.10, 14. Ephesians. 4.18. Titus 1.15. Zech. 7.12. Titus 3.3. Psalm 58.3.
is the loss of God's Image in the Soul, all being conceived in Sin, and born
without any Righteousness, full of all evil, having their minds blinded, their
Consciences defiled, their Heants hardened, their Wills corrupted, their
Affections perverted, and going astray from the Womb; and all this is called
Original Sin.

Question 9. What is that Eternal Death to which all are exposed?

Answer. All the Children of Adam by Nature are born under the Sentence of
Eternal Death, which is, Romans 3.9. with 6.23. Romans 5.12, 14. Isa. 1.9. Romans
9.29.11.5, 7. 1 Thessalonians. 5.9.
being separated from GOD for ever in Hell; this all deserve, and would feel,
if the Lord had not chosen in Christ a remnant, to escape the Wrath to come.

Question 10. What Misery came on the rest of the Creation by Adam's Fall?

Answer. The Ground was cursed for Adam's sake, Genesis 3.17, 18. Romans 8.20, 22.
and so brings forth Briars and Thorns; yea, because of this the whole Creation
groaneth.

Question 11. Can any Man help himself out of this miserable State?

Answer. There is no Man can by any Means redeem his own Soul, Psalm. 49.7, 8.
Hosea 13.9.
nor give to GOD a Ransom for himself, or for any of the Creation from this
dreadful Misery.

The Fourth Lesson About Redemption by the Person of CHRIST.
Question 1. DID God leave all Men in this miserable condition to perish for
ever?

Answer. GOD did not leave all Men to perish in their Misery, Genesis 3.8, 15.
with Heb. 2.14, 16.
but presently upon Adam's Fall, revealed to him Salvation by Jesus Christ, the
Seed of the Woman.

Question 2. Who is Jesus Christ?

Answer. Jesus Christ is the only Begotten Son of God, John 3.16. 1 Timothy 3.16.
Matthew. 1.21, 23
God and Man in One Person, the only Savior of Sinners.

Question 3. How can Jesus Christ be God and Man in One Person?

Answer. This is the great Mystery of Godliness, 1 Timothy 3.16. Heb. 2.14.7.26.
Matthew. 1.23.
that Jesus Christ being Very God took on him the Nature of Man, yet without
Sin, and so in One Person is both God and Man.

Question 4. How did Jesus Christ the Son of God take our Nature upon him?

Answer, Luke 1.35. Matthew. 1.18.2.1.
The Holy Spirit overshadowing the Virgin Mary, she conceived, and that Holy
Thing that was Born of her in Bethlehem in Judea, Luke 1.32.
was Jesus Christ the Son of the Most High God!

Question 5. Why was Jesus Christ Born into the World?

Answer. Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners, 1 Timothy 1.15.2.5.
as being Mediator between God and Men.

Question 6. How does Jesus Christ save Sinners?

Answer. Jesus Christ saves Sinners freely by his Grace, Ephesians. 2.8. Titus 3.4,
5. 2 Timothy 1.9. Isa. 52.3. Heb. 7.24, 25. Acts 3.20, 26. Psalm 110. all and 2.2,
6.
without any Conditions or Qualifications done by them, being the only Priest
to atone for them, by the Sacrifice of himself; the true Prophet to teach them
by his Word and Spirit; by which also as King he Rules them.

Question 7. How is Jesus Christ Mediator between God and Men?

Answer. Jesus Christ is the Mediator between God and Men, Heb. 9.14, 15. Ephesians.
2.13, 16.
as he makes up the Breach between an offended God, and offending Men,
according to the Everlasting Covenant of Grace.

Question 8. What is the Everlasting Covenant of Grace?

Answer. Psalm. 89.3.28 to 38. Isa. 53.10, 11. Psalm. 40.6, 8.
The Covenant of Grace is the Eternal Agreement of the Father with the Son, in
which the Father on the part of the Godhead promised to the Son, Eternal Life
for all the Elect, upon his performing all Conditions, Isa. 26.12.
for and in them that shall be saved.

Question 9. But is not the Covenant of Grace made with Men?

Answer. The Covenant of Grace is made only with Jesus Christ as the Head and
Representative of the Elect, Zeeh. 9.11. Isa. 42.6. Ephesians. 1.10. Isa. 55.1, 3.
Ezekiel. 16.6. Psalm. 50.5. Jer. 31.31, 33. Heb. 8.6, 13.
to whom; when they believe, it is made over as a Promise in a gracious
Church Covenant, founded upon it, and made with the Saints before Christ came
in the flesh; and since by him renewed to the Church, and their Seed; which is
called the first and second Covenant.

Question 10. But are not Men to perform some of the Conditions of the Covenant
of Grace?

Answer. No Man can perform any one Condition of the Covenant for Salvation; 2
Cor. 3.5. Isa. 26.12. Phil. 2.13. Ephesians. 2.8. 2 Timothy 1.1. 1 Cor. 11.25. Isa.
55.3.49.8.
Jesus Christ does all for his People that procures their Salvation, and all in
them to make them lay hold of this Salvation, and so gives the Covenant of
Grace, as a Free Promise, or Testament to them in his Blood, therefore he is
called the Covenant.

Question 11. How does Jesus Christ according to the Covenant of Grace, make up
the Breach between God and Man?

Answer. Heb. 7.22. 2 Cor. 5.21.
Jesus Christ makes up the Breach between God and Man as his People's Surety in
their Stead; being made under the Law, Gal. 4.4, 5. Matthew. 5.17. Gal. 3.13. 1
Cor. 15.3, 4. Romans 1.3, 4. and 4.25.
obeying it perfectly in his Life, and dying the shameful Death of the Cross
under the Curse of it, and rising again the Third Day, he so fulfilled all
Conditions of Life, and Salvation for them.

Question 12. Why was it needful that Jesus Christ should be God and Man to
make up this Breach?

Answer. It was needful that Christ should be Man to obey the Law, Heb. 2.14,
16.
and die under its Curse in the same Nature that sinned; and also God, Acts
20.28.
to support him under, and give a value to all that he did, and suffered for
the Salvation of his People.

Question 13. Is there no Salvation to be had but by Jesus Christ God-Man?

Answer. There is no Salvation in any other but Jesus Christ; Acts 4.12. Isa.
43.11. Romans 4.25.
for there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we must be
saved but by Jesus Christ, who died for our Sins, and rose again for our
Justification!

The Fifth Lesson. About the Application of Redemption.
Question 1. WILL Jesus Christ save all Men?

Answer. Jesus Christ so saves all the World from present destruction, Psalm.
36.6. with 1 Timothy 4.10. Heb. 2.9, 10. Romans 9.27. 1 Timothy 4, 10.
that all men have some outward Benefits by his Ransom; but he does only save a
certain number from Eternal Death, whence he is said specially to save them
that believe.

Question 2. Who are those that Jesus Christ will save from Eternal Death?

Answer. Jesus Christ saves none from Enternal Death but the Elect, Joh. 17.2,
9, 12, 19. Romans 11.5, 7. 2 Thessalonians. 2.11, 14
those that were chosen to Salvation before the foundation of the World; the
rest die in their Sins and are damned, notwithstanding all the good things they
enjoy in this life by Christ. Luke 16.25.


Question 3. How comes it that only some are elected?

Answer. It pleased God of his own Will, Ephesians. 4.5, 11. Romans 9.11. to 24.
Prove. 16.4. 1 Pet. 2.8, 9.
for the manifestation of his glory, to choose some to everlasting life, and to
appoint others to Condemnation; nor does he give any other account of his
doings, Jude 4. Job 33.13.
but his own Sovereign Will and Pleasure.

Question 4. But did not God choose the Elect for some good he saw in them more
than in the rest?

Answer. 2 Timothy 1.9.
There could be no more good foreseen in the Creature than what God did
fore-ordain; therefore God chose not any for foreseen good in them; Romans 9.18.
Matthew. 20.15. Job 9.12. 40.2.
but he had Mercy on whom he would have Mercy, and whom he would he hardened;
and who may say to him what do thou?

Question 5. What difference then is there between the Elect and others, that
we may know them?

Answer, There is no difference between the Elect and others by Nature, Romans
3.9. Gal. 3.10 22, 23, 24.
all are alike the Children of Wrath, under Sin, shut up under the Law till
Faith comes; Romans 11.5, 6. 1 Cor. 4.7. Gal. 1.15. 2.16.3.24.
the difference is made only by Grace; which causes the Elect in the time
appointed to believe in Christ, that they may be justified by Faith in him.

Question 6. But if I am Elect, may I not live as I will, and yet be saved?

Answer. All that are elected to Salvation, are elected also to the Means of
Salvation, 2 Thessalonians. 2.13. 1 Pet. 1.2.
being chose to be saved through Faith in Christ, and Sanctification of the
Spirit unto Obedience, Romans 6.17, 18. Acts 15.9, 11. Romans 8.1.14.
which Faith all the Elect shall have to purify their hearts, so that they
cannot live after the flesh!

Question 7, Are the Elect then saved for their Faith and Obedience?

Answer. The Elect are not saved for their Faith and Obedience, Titus 3.5. Ephesians.
2.8.9.10. Romans 8.6, 14. Joh. 3.18.36. 10.3.26.
but they are saved through Faith in Christ in a way of Obedience unto him; and
whosoever live all their life as they list, and do never come to Christ by
Faith, nor obey him, they are not elected, and can never be saved!

Question 8. But are none saved without Faith in Christ?

Answer. GOD has appointed only one way of Salvation, John 3.18.36. Ephesians.
2.5.8. Gal. 3.22.24. Acts 13.39, 48 2 Samuel 12.23. Psalm. 22.9, 10. 71.5, 6. Luke
1.37.44. 18.16.17. Romans 4.16. Heb. 11.6.
and that is by Grace through faith in Jesus Christ; so that without, or before
Faith, none are justified; even the Elect that die in their infancy, have Faith
wro't in them by the Spirit of GOD, by which they trust in Christ; and all that
do not thus come to Christ by true Faith, being already condemned, the Wrath of
God abides on them.

Question 9. How did the Elect of Old come to Christ before he was born in the
World?

Answer. The Elect of Old came to Christ, Heb. 13.8. Acts 15.9, 11.
and were saved by faith in him, even as we are now, Romans 3.22, 25.4.22.24.
Heb. 11.13.7.25.
only they believed in Christ as to come, and we believe in Christ as already
come, and now in Heaven at the Right Hand of God, where he ever lives to make
Intercession.

Question 10. What is that Faith by which we come to Christ?

Answer. 2 Cor. 4.17. Romans 10.10, 17 1 These. 1.5, 9. Phil. 3.3, 8. Ephesians.
1.13.3.17. Joh. 17.20, 21. 1 John 5.12.
Faith is a Grace wro't by the Spirit of GOD through his Word, in the heart of a
poor Sinner, by which the Sinner is made to renounce all Sin, and other
Confidence, and to trust to, and rest upon Christ alone for Salvation, whereby
he is united to Christ, and so having the Son has Life.

Question 11. What accompanies the Souls believing in Christ?

Answer. 1 Cor. 1.9. 2 Timothy 1.9. John 1.12. Gal. 3.26. Romans 8.2.15.30.
Every one that believes in Christ with the heart is effectually called by the
Spirit of Christ, and so is by Faith a Child of God, justified, adopted,
sanctified, and shall be glorified.

Question 12. How is a Sinner justified, what is Justification?

Answer. In Justification the Righteousness of Christ is by the Free Grace of
God imputed to the believing Sinner, Romans 3.21. to 27 4.23, 24. Gal. 2.16,
3.22, 23. Acts 13.38, 39 2 Cor. 5.21. Isa. 60.21. Rom 5.1.19.
and only to him that believes; for which Suretiship-Righteousness all his Sins
are pardoned, and he is accounted perfeclly righteous in the sight of God; and
so being justified by faith, has Peace with GOD.

Question 13. How are we Adopted, what is Adoption?

Answer. Acts 26.18. Romans 8.15.17. Gal. 4.7. John 1.12. 1 John 3.1, 2. Matthew.
3.17. 1 Cor. 3.21, 23
In Adoption GOD by his free Grace takes the poor Sinner out of the sinful
Family of the First Adam, and makes him a Child of God, and Joint-heir with
Christ the Second Adam, his well-beloved Son, in whom he has a right to all
the Privileges of the Sons of GOD.

Question 14. How are Believers sanctified, what is Sanctification?

Answer, Romans 8.29. Ephesians. 4.23 24. 2 Cor. 5.17. 1 John 4.19. 2 Cor. 7.11. Ezekiel.
36.31. Romans 6.17, 21, 22.
In Sanctification the Holy Spirit restores the Image of GOD in the heart of a
poor Sinner, making him a New Creature, renewing the Spirit of his Mind in all
Holiness, and true Righteousness, to love God, to repent of all Sin by loathing
it, and turning from it; and with the heart to obey the Law of God.

Question 15. When are Believers glorified, what is Glorification?

Answer; Glorification is the enjoyment of God for ever in Heaven, John 17.5,
24. Acts 13.36. 2 Cor. 5.1, 2, 4. Heb. 2.10. 1 Cor. 15 chap. Phil. 3.21. Matthew.
25.34, etc.
by them who have in this life done his holy will, whose Souls at death are
made perfect in Holiness, and their bodies being raised in Glory at the great
day, both Soul and Body shall be united, and they being openly acknowledged by
Christ, shall be for ever with the Lord! 1 Thessalonians. 4.17


The Sixth Lesson. About the Law, and the Gospel.
Question 1. HOW shall we know the whole Will of God, that we may do it?

Answer. Hos. 8.12. Isa. 8.20. Ephesians. 2.20. 1 Timothy 4.7. Tit. 1.14. Gal. 6.16. 2 Timothy 3.15.17.
The whole Will of God is revealed in his written Word, containing all the
Books of the Old and New Testament; the Apocrypha being to be rejected as
profane, Old Wives Fables, which turn from the Truth: This Word is the perfect
Rule, or Canon, which is able to make even a Child wise unto Salvation, through
Faith which is in Jesus Christ.

Question 2. Why are the Scriptures called the Old and the New Testament?

Answer. The Scriptures are called the Old and New Testament, Isa. 8.20.
as they testify of the whole Will of God, both under the first Testament,
Heb. 8.6. to 13.
or Church Covenant, before Christ came in the Flesh, and since under the
Second Testament, or Church Covenant, enlarged and renewed by Christ, wherein,
1st, Col. 2.14.
All the outward Levitical Ceremonies in the first Church Covenant are taken
away. 2dly, Romans 15.8.
Yet all their Spiritual Privileges in that Covenant are confirmed to us and
our Seed. 3dly, 2 Cor. 3.7, 11.
And glorious Additions are made of Gospel Grace to the Church.


Question 3. How shall we know the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to
be the Word of God?

Answer. Mat. 16.17. John 16.3. 1 John 2.20. chapter 5.6. Luke 24.32. 1 Cor. 2.14.
2 Pet. 1.19.21.
The Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are only known aright to be the
Word of God, by the witnessing of the Spirit of God in the Heart, to the
Testimony which they give of their heavenly Majesty, and undoubted Divinity.

Question 4. How shall we come to understand the Mind of God in his Word?

Answer. 1 Timothy 4.13.15. Acts 37.11. John 5.39. Ps. 119.9, 18. Ephesians. 1.17, 18. 1
Cor. 2.12, 13.
We shall come to a right Understanding of the Mind of God in his Word, by
diligent reading, hearing, searching, and meditating therein, with constant
Prayer to God for Wisdom, comparing Scripture with Scripture by the help of the
Holy Spirit.

Question 5. But will not the Learning of Men help to understand the Word of
God?

Answer. A knowledge of the Hebrew, and the Greek Tongues, in which the
Scriptures were first written, may be of use to understand the Letter of them;
Col. 2.8. 1 Cor. 8.1, 2. chapter 1.19, 21. chapter 2.4, 10, 11. Luke 24.45.
but Philosophy, and other Learning puffs up, and leads from a dependence on
the Spirit, who only can open our Understanding in the Scriptures.

Question 6. What are the chief Parts of the Word of God?

Answer. Isa. 8.20. with 1 Cor. 2.1. Luke 24.27. with Act. 10.43 Gal. 3.8, 10.
Psalm. 119.96.
The whole Word of God may be divided into Law and Gospel, both which are to be
found both in the Old Testament, and in the New; the Historical, and every
other part of the Word referring, and having a respect some way or other,
either to Law or Gospel.

Question 7. What is the Law?

Answer. Psalm. 119.96. 1 Timothy 1.8, 9, 10. Gal. 3.10. Exodus 20. all. Mat. 5, 6,
and 7 chap.
The Law consists of all the Commands and Threatenings in all the Bible, not
only in the Old Testament, but in the New also, all which are briefly summed up
in the Ten Commandments given by Moses, and explained by Christ, his Apostles,
and Prophets.

Question 8. What is the Sum of the Ten Commandments?

Answer. Eccles. 12.13, Deuteronomy. 10.12, 13. with Mat. 22.37, 38, 39, 40. Romans
13.10.
The Ten Commandments briefly sum up our Duty to God and Man; all which are
contained in these Words of our Savior, Thou shall love the Lord thy God with
all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy
Strength; and thou shall love thy Neighbor as thy self; for Love is the
fulfilling of the Law.

Question 9. How shall we aright understand the Ten Commandments?

Answer. By knowing these three Things we may come to a good Understanding of
the Commands:

1st, Psalm. 119.128. Deuteronomy. 6.13. with Lev. 26.1.
That every Command for Duty forbids the contrary Sin, and every Command which
forbids Sin, obliges to the contrary Duty.

2. Romans 7.5, 7, 8, 14. Mat. 5.21, 22, 27, 28. Prove. 24.9. Genesis 6.5. 2 Cor.
10.5.
By knowing that every Command reaches the very Heart, not only forbidding the
outward Sin, and commanding outward Obedience, but even the Thoughts and
Motions of Sin within us are forbidden, and the Obedience of the Heart is
required therein.

3. 1 John 3.4. James 2.10. Mat. 23.23.
By considering that any Transgression of the Law, or the least want of
whatsoever the Law requires is Sin.

Question 10. Can any Man obey the Commandments perfectly?

Answer. Mat. 19, 20. Romans 7.9, 10, 11.
Those that think the Law forbids only outward Sins, and know not the
Spirituality of it, they think that they can perform all; Jer. 4.14. Prove.
23.16. Romans 3.10, 20. Eccl. 7.20.
but such as feel that the Command reaches the very Heart, forbidding every
sinful Thought, and commanding us even in our Spirit to fear God, they know,
and are sure, that no mere Man can perfectly keep the Law.

Question 11. Why then were the Commands given by Moses, if no Man can
perfectly obey them?

Answer. Moses did not give the Law as a Covenant of Works, that we should obey
it for Life, Gal. 3.24.
but as a Schoolmaster for Three Ends:

1st, To show us our miserable State by Nature, Romans 3.9, 19. chap. 7.8.
that we are all Sinners against the holy Law of God.

2. To make us despair of Salvation in our selves, Romans 3.19, 20. chap. 5.20.
and to fly to Christ for help.

3. The Law was given as a Rule of Life, Psalm. 119.45, 1^5, 133.
to order all our Conversation by at all times.

And this is the only right Use of the Law. 1 Timothy 1.8.


Question 12. What is the Gospel?

Answer. Luke 2.10, 11. Acts 20.24. Romans 10.15. with Isa. 52.7. Acts 13.23, 39.
chap. 3.18.
The Gospel is the Glad Tidings of Salvation by Jesus Christ, containing all
the free Promises and Invitations of Grace, whether in the Old Testament, or in
the New.

Question 13. But are not Faith, Repentance, and Love, the Commands of the
Gospel?

Answer. Acts 20.24. 1 Timothy 1.5, 10. Psalm. 19.7, 8, 9. Mat. 22.37, 40. Mark
1.15. Gal. 3.24.
The Gospel strictly taken for Glad Tidings of Salvation by Jesus Christ, has
no Commands; Faith, Repentance, Love, and all Duties whatsoever being commanded
by the Law; yet in preaching the Gospel these Commands must be urged to lead to
Christ.

Question 14. But is not the Gospel a new Law, offering Salvation on the easier
Terms of our sincere Obedience?

Answer. Mat. 5.17, 18, 19, 20. Luke 16.17. Phil. 3.9. Gal. 2.16, 21.
It is the Heresy of the Papists, and their Followers, to say, that the good
old righteous Law of God is taken away, to make room for a new Gospel Law by
our sincere Obedience whereto any can be saved; for if Righteousness comes by
our Obedience to any Law, Christ is dead in vain.

Question 15. But are not Faith, Repentance, and New Obedience reckoned for our
Gospel Righteousness.

Answer. Gal. 2.16. Romans 3.20, 21, 22. Jer. 23.6. 1 Cor. 1.30. 2 Cor. 7.11.
Ephesians. 4.22, 24.
The only Righteousness for which a Sinner is saved, is the Righteousness of
Christ received by Faith, and imputed to us; the Act of Faith does not
justify, but Christ the Object by Faith apprehended, and rested upon; and this
Faith is ever accompanied with true Repentance, and new Obedience.

Question 16. Then those that receive the Gospel, are to do good Works?

Answer. Tit. 2.11, 12.3.8, 14. 1 Cor. 10.31. 1 Timothy 1.5, 8, 9. Romans 7.12, 22.
1 Cor. 9.21. Mat. 5.19.
Those that receive the Gospel, should be careful to maintain good Works, done
from a Principle of Faith unto God's Glory; but all Commands for all good
Works, with all Threatenings for the neglect thereof, are from the Law, which is
the Rule of Life to all.

Question 17. How shall we walk according to this Rule, that we may glorify
God?

Answer. Christ has set up his Churches, 1 Pet. 2.3, 5, 9, 12. Luke 1.6.
in which we should walk blameless in all the Ordinances and Commands of God,
Mat. 12.50. Acts 2.42. 11.26. Gal. 6.16. Mal. 4.4. 2 Cor. 9.13.
not being partial in his Law, but esteeming the Commands as highly in the Old
Testament as in the New, both being our Rule; and such only are called
Christians in the Scripture, and to be accounted visible Believers, who profess
their Subjection to Christ in his Church.

The Seventh Lesson. About Glorifying God in his Churches.
Question I. WHat is the Church of Christ?

Answer. The Church of Christ is either,

1st, The Catholic Church, Ephesians. 1.22, 23.5.25, 27. 2 These. 2.1.
consisting of all, and only the Elect, which is and will be invisible till the
Judgment-Day: Or

2dly, The visible Church, which consisted first in Families, Genesis 17.7, 10.
Acts 7.38. Rev. 1.11.
then in the whole Nation of the Jews; and since Christ ascended, it consists
in particular Congregations.

Question 2. What makes a Congregation a true Church of Christ?

Answer. More generally, and briefly two Things go to the due Constitution of
every Church of Christ, Scripture Faith, Col. 2.5, 6.
and Order, without both which there can be no true Church: But more largely,
and particularly, to the regular Constitution of every true Church, these Prove.
9.1. These are the Churches Seven Pillars.
Seven things are necessary:

Right Foundation, Matter, Form, Officers, Ordinances, Order, and Ends.


SECT. I. Of the Right Foundation of a Church.
Question 3. What is the Right Foundation of a Church of Christ?

Answer. The right Foundation of every true Church, Mat. 16.18. Isa. 26.4.
Marg. Ephesians. 2.20. 2 Pet. 3.2. Ps 18.22. Col. 2.19. 1 Pet. 2.4, 5. 1 Cor. 3.11.
is the Person of Christ, the Rock of Ages, on whom the Church is built,
according to the Precepts and Practices of the Apostles and Prophets; Christ
himself being the only Support and Head thereof, on whom the Faith of the
Church stands; and all other Foundations of Money, Power, and Policy, not being
of God, will fall.

SECT. II. Of the right Matter of a Church.
Question 4. What is the right Matter of a Church of Christ?

Romans 10.9, 10. 1 Cor. 1.10.7.14. Jer. 32.39. Deuteronomy. 29.10, 12. 1 Cor. 14.23.
and 11.20. Deuteronomy. 4.37. Psalm. 102.27, 28. Ezekiel. 16.20, 21. Luke 18.16.
Answer. So many professing Believers of one Mind, and one Judgment, with their
immediate Infant Seed, as can conveniently assemble together to worship in one
place, and no more, are the only right Matter of a visible Church of God; who
loving the Fathers, chose their Children after them; therefore the Infant Seed,
with Believers, stand in a Relation to God in his Church; for of such is the
Kingdom of Heaven.

SECT. III. Of the Right Form of a Church.
Quest. 5. What is the right Form of a Church of Christ?

Answer. Psalm. 50.5. Deuteronomy. 29.1, 9, 15. 2 Cor. 8.5. with 2 Chronicles. 23.16. and
34.31.
The only right forming of a Church is by Covenant, in which all do give up
themselves and their Children to the Lord, and to each other by his Will, to be
the Lord's People, and to walk after him in all his ways; by such a Covenant
were the Churches both in the Old and in the New Testament formed, Neh. 10.1,
29. with Act 11.23. Jer. 50.5. with Act. 9.26. Heb. 8.6.13. Ephesians. 4.3. with
Ezekiel. 20.37. Neh. 9.38. Ezekiel. 43.11.
called in God's Word the First and Second Covenant, and this being the Bond of
the Churches Peace, it is most expedient to have written in our sight, that we
may keep it, and do it.

SECT. IV. Of the right Officers of a Church.
Quest. 6. Who are the right Officers of a Church of Christ?

Answer. Christ has appointed for each Church only two sorts of Officers,
Phil. 1.1.
A Pastor, and Deacon.


1st, Ephesians. 4.11. 1 Pet. 5.2, 3. Acts 20.28. 1 Cor. 12.28.
A Pastor, or Bishop, not to Lord over, but to feed, teach, and rule that Flock
to which he is related; assisted in his Work by Elders, if need be.

2d, Acts 6.2, 3. 1 Timothy 3. all.
Deacons to take Care of the outward Affairs of the Church.

These Officers to be chosen by the Church from among themselves, Acts 14.23.
and by them to be ordained, or set a part to their Work, with Fasting and
Praying; without laying on of Hands; Profit not, 1 Cor. 12.7. Edify not. 1
Cor. 14.12, 26
that Ceremony being no more to be used, than washing of Feet, or anointing
with Oil; because the glorious Gifts that once attended it, are long since
ceased.

SECT. V. Of the Right Ordinances of a Church.
Question 7. What are the Right Ordinances of a Church of Christ?

Answer. Typify'd Ezekiel. 40.39, 40, 41, 42. chap. 46.3. Ezekiel. 47.12.
The Right Ordinances for the Worship of GOD in the Church are Eight; Four
being more general, to be dispensed every first day of the Week, in which all
may join; And four more special, to be confined to, or kept within the pale of
the Church, and dispensed according to the Months.

Question 8. What are the Four general Ordinances in which all may join?

Answer. The Four general Ordinances are Praise, Prayer, Preaching, And
Contribution.


1st. Praise, Psalm. 150.6. Ephesians. 5.19. Col. 3.16.
By singing only the Psalms, Hymns and Songs indicted by the Spirit, and
contained in the Scripture. 2. Prayer By the help of the Spirit, Psalm 65.2.
Romans 8.26. Matthew. 6.7, 9.
without humane forms, according to the Pattern given by our Lord to his
Disciples. 3. Preaching By rightly dividing, 2 Timothy 4.2. Acts 28.23.
expounding and applying the Scriptures of Truth. 4. Contribution By laying by
in Store, 1 Cor. 16.1, 3. Heb. 13.16.
as God prospers each Week, to be Communicated at the Public Gatherings.


Question 9. What are the Four special Ordinances confined only to the Church?

Answer. Matthew. 7.6. Cant. 4.12. Matthew. 16.19. Ephesians. 4.11, 16. typify'd Eze.
46.21, 24 Acts 20.28. 1 Pet. 5.2.
The four special Ordinances confined by Christ within the Pale of his Church,
are the Two Seals called Sacraments; and the Two Keys of the Church; the Seals
to be dispensed to each Church by their own Pastor only, and the Keys by their
own Pastor or Elders.

Question 10. What are the Seals of the Church?

Answer. The Seals of the Church are Two

Baptism,

And the

Lords Supper.

1st. Baptism for every Believer or Churchmember, Act. 2.39, 41. chap. 16.15,
33. Isa. 44.3. Rev. 14.1. Matthew. 28.19. with Isa. 52.15. 1 Cor. 10.1.2.
and their immediate infant seed, by sprinkling or pouring Water only on the
Face, in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

2. The Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 11. chap. 23d verse to the end.
for such only in a Church as can examine themselves, wherein Bread and Wine is
received, according to the Institution of Christ by all the Church sitting
together in the Evening time.

Question 11. How are Baptism and the Lord's Supper called Seals?

Answer. 1 Cor. 10.2, 3, 4
Baptism and the Lord's Supper are Seals of the Covenant, (that is, of the
Church Covenant) as they Seal to all an outward relation in the Church; though to
the Elect only they Seal Salvation:

1st. Baptism Seals to Church Members, Gal. 3.27. 1 Cor. 1.2. and 7.14. with
12.12. Heb. 12.24. Ezekiel. 36.25. 1 Pet. 3.21.
and their Seed an outward relation to Christ in the Church Covenant; and to
the Elect also their saving-relation to Christ by his Blood sprinkled, And his
Spirit poured upon them:

2. The Lords Supper seals to Church Members, 1 Cor. 10.16, 17 and 11.26.
their outward Relation to Christ in the Church; though only the Elect are sealed
to Salvation therein, by Christ's Body broken, and his Blood shed for them,
trusted to by Faith, Luke 22.19, 20.
and signified by the Bread and Wine.

Question 12. What are the Keys of the Church?

Answer. Matthew. 18.18.
The Keys committed by Christ to his Church are two,

Fellowship, And

Censure.

1st, Fellowship, Acts 2.42. Isa. 26.2. Jer. 51.10. Psalm. 40.9, 10.66.16. Cor.
14.12.19, 31.34.2
in Church-Meetings, is the Key for opening the Door of the Church, to let in
the Righteous that keep the Truth, in which their Experiences are given in to
the Church, and the Brethren's Gifts are also exercised in Praying, and
Prophesying.

2. Censure is the Key to shut the Door of the Church upon Offenders, Matthew.
11.15, 18. 1 Thessalonians. 5.14. 2 Thessalonians. 3.6. 1 Cor. 5.4, 5. Psalm. 149.6, 9. Jude 22,
23.
By Admonition, By Withdrawing, or By Cutting off in Excommunication, as the
Offense does require.

SECT. VI. Of the Right Order of a Church.
Question 13. What is the right Order of a Church of Christ?

Answer. Psalm. 119.128. Gal. 6.16. with Mal. 4.6. 2 Timothy 3, 15, 17 Ephesians. 2.20.
2 Pet. 3.2. Gal. 6.16, Isa. 8.20. Matthew. 15.9. Zech. 7.12. Jer. 8.8, 9.
All the right Order of a Church must be taken from the written Word of God,
both from the Old Testament and New, which together are the complete Rule, and
Canon, whereby all things must be ordered in the Church; and by this Rule, or
Canon, of the Prophets, and Apostles, the old Testament and the new, the whole
Israel of God must walk, as ever they would have the Peace of God with them,
therefore all Orders, Rules, and Canons given by Popes, Councils, or any other
whatsoever, are confusion, if not according to this Word.

SECT. VII. Of the right Ends of a Church.
Question 14. What are the right Ends of a Church of Christ?

Answer. Ephesians. 3.21. 1 Cor. 14.26. Col. 2.3, 4. Phi. 2 5.10, 11 Psalm 110.3.
Isa. 45.23. with Romans 14.11. Ezekiel. 20.37. Rev. 14.1. 1 John 4.3. Matthew. 12.30.
The Glory of God, and the mutual Edification of his Saints, without any regard
to human Interest, are the only right Ends all true Churches should set before
them; to advance which, it is the Duty of every one that has Faith in the
Heart, openly to profess a willing Subjection to Christ in his Church, so
coming under the Bond of the Church Covenant, they take the Father's Mark in
the Forehead, and such only are visible Christians, for he that is not for
Christ by open Profession, is against him.

Question 15. What time has God allotted to his Church for worshipping him?

Answer. Genesis 2.3. Ezod. 20.9, 10. Matthew. 12.8. Job. 20.19, 20. Acts 20.7. Rev.
1.10. Psalm. 118.24. Heb. 4.7.11. typify'd. Ezekiel. 43.27. and Numb. 29.35.
The Lord has appointed in his word one Day in seven for his solemn Service:
which Day before Christ's Resurrection was the last Day of the Week, but is
since by the Lord of the Sabbath changed to the First Day, in Scripture called
the Lord's Day, because on that Day our Lord rested from his work of
Redemption, therefore all Christians should keep the Lord's Day as a holy rest
from Sin, by attending on Christ in his public Worship, and resting in his
Grace.

Question 16. But is there no other time for worshipping God in public?

Answer. Ephesians. 5.16. 2 Timothy 4.2. as Acts 13.42 Margent. Prove. 8.34. Psalm.
84.4, 10.
The Lord has commanded us to redeem the time, and to wait on him out of
Season as well as in Season; therefore every good Christian should improve all
Opportunities on any Day of the Week, for hearing the Word of God, and
worshipping him in the Assemblies of his Saints.

Question 17. But is a Christian only to worship God in public?

Answer. John 5.39. Mat. 6.5, 6, 7. Genesis 18.19. Jos. 24.15. Ephesians. 6.4, 18.
figured 1 Chr. 16.40, 43 Jer. 10.25.
GOD has made it the Duty of all Men to study his holy Word, and to pray unto
him in secret, as well as to worship him in public; Therefore Masters of
Families, and Parents should instruct their Children and Servants in the holy
Fear of God, praying daily with their Families; for the Curse of God rests
upon all those Families that Call not upon his Name.

Question 18. And shall all in Christ's visible Church on Earth, be glorified
in Heaven?

Answer. There are in Christ's visible Church Two sorts of Worshippers:

1st. Such as Worship God hypocritically in the outward only, Eze. 33.31, 33.
Matthew. 24.51.
who shall be cast down into Hell as Deceivers of others, and their own Souls;

2. Such as Worship God uprightly, John 4.24. Matthew. 25.46. John 17.24.
with the heart, as well as outwardly, these shall be glorified with God for
ever in Heaven.

The Word of God declares that in the latter day Christ shall have a glorious
Kingdom, called the New Jerusalem, when Satan being Chained up a Thousand
Years, we shall discern between the precious and the vile; and all the Dead
being raised in the day of Judgment shall be Sentenced by him; the wicked into
Everlasting Fire, with the Devil and his Angels; but the righteous he will
receive into Glory with himself for ever, AMEN!

present you faultless before the Presence of his Glory with exceeding Joy. To
the only wise God our Savior, be Glory, and Majesty, Dominion, and Power, both
now and ever. Amen.

FINIS.
