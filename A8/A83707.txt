The Humble ADDRESS of the House of Commons to the KING.
May it please Your most Excellent MAJESTY,
THIS is the Eighth Year in which Your Majesty's most Dutiful and Loyal
Subjects the Commons in Parliament assembled, have assisted Your Majesty with
large Supplies for carrying on a just and necessary War in defense of our
Religion, preservation of our Laws, and vindication of the Rights and Liberties
of the people of England; which we have hitherto preserved, and by the blessing
of God on Your Majesty's Conduct and good Government, will steadfastly Maintain
and Entail on our Posterity.

This has cost the Nation much Blood and Treasure, but the hopes of
accomplishing so Great and Glorious a Work, have made Your Subjects cheerfully
support the Charge. And to show to Your Majesty, and all Christendom, That the
Commons of England will not be amused or diverted from their firm resolutions
of obtaining by War, a Safe and Honorable Peace, we do, in the name of all
those we represent, renew our assurances to Your Majesty, That this House will
support Your Majesty and Your Government against all Your Enemies both at home
and abroad, And that they will effectually assist You in the Prosecution and
Carrying on the present War against France.

Edinburgh, Reprinted by the Heirs and Successors of Andrew Anderson, Printer
to His Most Excellent Majesty, Anno DOM* 1696.
