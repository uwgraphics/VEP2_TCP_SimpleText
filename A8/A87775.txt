THE KINGDOMS MONSTER Vncloaked from Heaven: The Popish Conspirators,
Malignant Plotters, and cruel Irish, in one Body to destroy Kingdom, Religion
and Laws: But under color to defend them, especially the Irish, who having
destroyed the Protestants There, fly hither to defend the Protestant Religion
Here.

Kingdom cittye



O England look upon this monstrous Thing,
That would our Kingdom unto ruin bring,
It Is framed and composed of three parts
Which are all joined both in heads and hearts:
Do not behold it with a careless eye,
This Monster brings this Land to misery:
This Monster following its forefathers hate,
Seeks to destroy the Kingdom and the State:
While Church and Kingdom should oppressed lie
Subjected to their blinded Popery:
Long time it walked muffled in a cloak
Till Straffords head was cut off, then it broke
Out of the cloud, but Heavens holy hands
Has now uncloak'd it, so that now it stands
In a full figure as this Picture here
Does make it lively to your view appear,
And in fit Emblems to your sight presents
His shape, his postures, and his black intents*
So that if you behold it round about
You shall see how this Monster is set out;
His Spanish Ruff, and Jacket show him here
To be half Papist, and half Cavalier;
His left side Popish is, which on his breast
Is by the figure of the Cross expressed;
Besides his Beads and Popish pardon be
Emblemes that speak his love to Papistry:
So on the left side Popish heads are got
Together ready to conspire and plot
Unfathomed mischief, and lest they should want
Brain to be wicked, and should so be scant
Of knowledge how they might undo this land,
Plotting malignant heads against them stand:
The winged cluster of heads do discover
That Papists Rebels from Ireland fly over:
These to make strong their party, do combine
While in one body they together join,
Which in this Monster of the times expressed,
And to show that there lodges in his breast
Nothing but cruelty, while it is his desire
To kill the Protestants, and their houses fire:
His double hands a sword, a knife contains*
A match, a Poleaxe, and a torch that flames;
Thus armed you may ask what he means to do,
Alas! his daily actions this do show;
He does intend to change the Churches coat,
That mass may be sung through a Friars throat*
And that the Protestants true Church may grow
Catholic, and unto the Pope may owe
Supremacy, while Popery that has bin
Long purged out, may be brought in again*
In hope whereof, they oppose the Parliament,
Which Papists once to blow up did consent,
As here the match in hand does represent,
While the black fiend did further their intent*
Besides this monstrous Body here compact
Of Papists, Irish and malignants act
Most horrid cruelties where they do approach,
Set out here by the sword in hand and torch;
Firing both Towns and houses where they come,
As they of late to Brimidgham have done;
And like unthankful wretches have no pity
Neither upon this Kingdom nor this City,
But Nero like would laugh while it did burn,
And would massacre such as would not turn
To their Religion, robbing them of life,
Described by the hand armed with a knife:
Thus under sword and fire this Kingdoms lies
Bleeding, and is this Monsters sacrifice;
While Papists, Irish, and Malignants are
Drawn all into the body of a war,
Who breath destruction, and would ruinate
Church, Kingdom, City, Parliament, and State,
Therefore this Picture here set out may be
Called the Kingdoms Map of misery.
But there is a God that will at last regard
Our sufferings, and give them their just reward*
Let them take heed, here on the side we see it.
They and the gallows at the last shall meet.
FINIS.
