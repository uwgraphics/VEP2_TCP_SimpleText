DIE SABBATHI 27. November. 1641.
Lords House.
WHereas upon the Lords finding that there are many Petitions depending in the
House, and conceiving that many more may come in, which may occasion the repair
and attendance of diverse of His Majesty's Subjects at this place: their
Lordships have thought fit, and accordingly have ordered it, That because there
are many public businesses of great importance in agitation, which concern the
safety and weal of the Kingdom, that all private businesses be deferred and put
off till the first day of Hillary Term next. Whereof their Lordships do hereby
give public notice to the whole Kingdom, to prevent the charge and trouble
which otherwise the Petitioners might be put unto in repairing hither.

Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1641.
