The Maids answer to the Batchelors Ballad* Or, Love without Remedy*
Thou Scriber! unto whom the Vulgar crew,
Gives small applause, yet more then is thy due;
Whose Brazen Brow, a withered Wreath adorns,
Which better would become a pair of Horns:
Know we contemn thee: thy Malicious Pen
Can have no influence on the minds of men:
In our dispraise, in vain thou seek'st to write,
True, thou may show thy teeth, but can not bite*
Alas! rude Boy; Love is a generous pain,
Which minds ignoble, cannot entertain:
Therefore thy accusations are unjust,
In giving Love the Character of Lust.
To the Tune of; No more silly Cupid: Or, The Duke of Monmouth's Jig.
With Allowance, By To. L'Estrange.



Who Is here so ingenious
mispending his time,
In railing at Venus,
In hopes to disparage,
Love, Women, and marriage,
By pitiful rhyme?
He thinks he is ingenious
and slyly the youngster intices;
But we easily find,
How the youth is inclined,
by his tricks and devices.
He plainly discovers
his amorous arts,
And calls 'em blind lovers,
Who after enjoyment,
can find new employment,
to fetter their hearts:
He plainly discovers
a nature so rude and ungrateful,
That after Compliance,
he bids us defiance,
and says we grow hateful.
Then who but an Harlot
would yield to the will
Of every such Varlet,
That loves at his leisure,
And only takes pleasure,
in showing his skill?
Sure none but an harlot,
would yield to the lustful persuasion,
of fellows in Shammy,
who only cry Dam, me,
to serve their occasions.
The gaudy young Sinner,
whose blood is a fire,
May fool a beginner,
and treat her with Coaches,
to mighty debauches,
and gain his desire:
Alas! for the Sinner,
that covets such sweetness as this is!
he seldom does fail,
of a sting in the tail,
with his wenches and Misses.




THis makes him look meager,
a wantoning Elf,
His mind is so eager
to humor his senses,
that by his expenses,
he ruins himself:
This makes him so meager,
he is nothing but pox and diseases,
so after enjoying,
the pleasure is cloying*
and quickly displeases.
Then show me the woman,
in City or Town,
Though never so common,
With such a lewd fellow,
so tawny and yellow,
will laugh and lie down:
For sure she is no Woman
that trades with a son for a Whore,
who having enjoyed her,
will strait-way avoid her,
and see her no more.
The passionate Lover,
that is caught in his youth,
May plainly discover
that all his persuasions
are subtle evastons,
and far from the truth:
For he that is a Lover,
and courteth sincerely and truly,
may keep his affection
in civil subjection,
from being unruly.
But let the fond Bully,
his fancy employ,
He never can fully
or bring in suspicion,
the sweets of fruition,
true lobers enjoy:
In spite of the Bully,
the pleasure of Conjugal kisses,
is always dellghtful
and far the more frightful;
of temporal blisses.
And yet for the Gallant,
we must not deny:
But that he is so valiant
as stoutly to threaten,
the girl shall be beaten,
that will not comply:
Beware of the Gallant!
I vow he is a desperte creature,
If any abuse him,
Or dare to refuse him,
he swears he will beat her.
Sir Fopling, your Servant!
the man's in a pett:
What makes you so servent?
You burn in displeasure,
pray cool at you^ leisure:
that is all you will get:
Your Servant, Sir Fopling,
say all, and do more than you can sir,
It Is still my opinion,
We shall have dominion,
take that for an answer.
Printed for P. Brooksby, the at Golden-ball near the Hospital-gate, in West
smith-field.
