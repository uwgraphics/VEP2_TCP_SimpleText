By the Protector. A DECLARATION Of His Highness the Lord Protector, Inviting
persons to send over all sorts of necessary Provisions to Mardike.
WHereas the Port of Dunkirk (which while it has been in the hand of the
Enemies of this Commonwealth, has been very prejudicial to the Merchants and
Trade of these Nations) is now straightly besieged both by Sea and Land, by the
English and French Forces; and for that, during the said Siege, in respect of
the greatness of that Army, there is and will be need of Supplies of Bread,
Beer, Beef, Butter, Cheese, Hay, Oats, and other Provisions for Man and Horse,
the want whereof may prolong the work intended, being of so great concernment
to this Commonwealth: His Highness the Lord Protector, with the advice and
consent of His Council, has thought fit to publish, and Declare the same,
inviting all Merchants, and others to send, with what expedition they may, for
supply of the said Forces, such provisions as aforesaid, for which His Highness
has received assurance, that, upon delivery thereof, there shall be
satisfaction in ready money, provision being already made therein, which as it
may be of advantage to such Merchants, or other persons, in venting the said
Commodities, so it will be esteemed as an acceptable service, and of great
advantage to the Commonwealth. And therefore His Highness does Order, that this
Declaration be published, and posted up in all the Ports and Sea Towns of this
Commonwealth, that notice may be taken thereof.

Given at White Hall the 18th. of May, 1658.
