A SALUTATION TO THE SEED OF GOD.

AND A Call out of Babylon, and Egypt, from amongst the Magitians, where the
house of bondage is, and the Imaginations rules above the Seed of God, the
cause of all blindness, and condemnation.

Also that which is perfect made manifest, even everlasting Righteousness,
which endures for all generations, who will receive it and believe therein,
which is Sions glory, Christ with his life and power made manifest in mortal
flesh.

With the way to him, set forth most for such as groan for freedom from the
power of sin; but may be serviceable to all who loves his appearance.

Also a testimony from Christ, what he is in this world, and where he is;
written to such as are imagining such a Christ as they would have, but cannot
receive the same that is from the beginning, and in the same way manifest.

Also a suite to such Rulers* Magistrates, and Governors, as have not wholly
hardened their hearts, and stopped the ear against the voice of the Spirit, that
they may hear and their souls may live, and be established a blessing to the
Nations.

With some things more added to this second Impression.

Written in love to all your souls, by him who is called JAMES NAYLOR.

We have found him whom our souls loves; And greater is he in us then he that's
in the world. LONDON: Printed for Giles Calvert, at the Sign of the

A SALUTATION TO THE Seed of God. AND A Call out of Babylon, and Egypt, from
amongst the Magitians, where the house of bondage is, and the Imaginations
Rules above the Seed of God.
ARise, shine forth, thou seed of the Covenant, to which the Promise is; for
thy glory is come; and with Judgment is the Lord arisen to redeem his chosen;
and all that turn to him shall be covered with righteousness, even that which
before the world was, and above all the world is, which is perfect for
evermore. Put off your rags you that have covered your selves with your
wisdom; and let that which is imperfect be done away. How long will it be ere
you hearken to the Lord, that you may partake of the best, and receive of the
Lord freely, that your souls may be satisfied, that no leannes there may be,
nor crying out of wants. Can the Lord be pleased with that righteousness, which
that of God in your consciences declares to be imperfect? Or will he accept
that which is none of his own? Consider of this you Professors of the Nation,
who pray and weep and seek, but find not that which gives peace, nor
reconciles you to God. W^^hout faith in Christ its impossible to be
well-pleasing to God, who is your peace; and that's not faith in Christ that
lays hold of an imperfect righteousness; for that's your own: But that's the
righteousness of God which by faith in Christ alone is f^eely received; and
the least measure is perfect. This is the gif^ that comes from above, which
takes up the creature above all other. That which we have received we declare,
and we can do no other, for in him is our glory, and this of his is our
boldness in the day of Judgment, that as he is so are we in this world, herein
is our love perfected in him, because we are of him, and one with him in his
righteousness; and that measure we have of it is freely ours without upbraiding,
and an inheritance we have in it wherefore we leave all to follow him who is
our fullness, and cannot but call to all who loves their souls to come to us,
knowing his freeness. And your labors to no purpose, you who are kindling
sparks, with whom we have laid long in sorrow; and we know the end of your
labor, and your fruit is cursed, though in the sweat of your brows you bring
it forth, all you that say you must do what you can, and Christ will do the
rest; you must do some and Christ must do other some, this is your own way and
not the way of God; for here the linsie-woolsie garment is seen, which is
forbidden; for in the way of God, Christ is all, in all; but here is part in
you, and part in him, (as you imagine) and you are two, and there is sin, for
while you live sin lives, and if we say, we have no sin, we deceive our selves,
and have not the truth in us; But where he alone lives there is no sin; for the
life of Christ is the death of sin, as it is manifest, and for this purpose we
know he was manifest to take away our sins, and in him is no sin, for by the
appearance of his life are we translated into his likeness, which is our
boldness, and he that has this hope purifies himself even as he is pure, for
we see him as he is, our life, our hope, our strength and way, which is pure,
and perfect; and as he is so he makes our way perfect: and this is our peace,
that we have nothing but what we have received, and it is his own and he
cannot deny himself, who is faithful, and with his faithfulness are we made
faithful, to him; and the least measure of him which comes from above, which is
present power and in a measure of him we move and have our being where nothing
is impossible: The day of his power is come whereby we are made willing, in
which will his people ever took pleasure: and whatever he does is good for us,
and his wondrous works we see, which have been told of, how with his own arm
he takes the kingdom, is us, which so much we talked on when we did not know
him, nor his power, but (with you) put the good day far off us to another
generation, when the Lord was near us though we did not know him but looked
for the kingdom of God without us, which was within us unregarded, therefore
did we sit down in sorrow, being out of that way where rest was placed, and did
not se^ him who was foreordained for good works wherein we should walk, in
which by him we should be exercised, therefore we could never come to be
satisfied, but our conscience still accusing us, in our best performances, yea
fears and doubtings were our best condition, who therein were like the false
Prophets speaking peace one to another, where God had not spoken peace in our
consciences, thus healing the hurt deceitfully, as all the world at this day is
doing, crying peace when the bonds of iniquity still stands; and you are
servants in evil works where the Prince of this world is Ruler and guide: and
what peace can you have while that Kingdom stands, and you in it? and this
Kingdom must stand till his power be known who is appointed to take it, and
bind the Prince of it.

Wherefore come out of Death all that will have life, and make no longer
Covenant with it. How can you prevail who take the Serpents council to
overcome the Devils kingdom? and this you do who search into the things of
God with your fallen wisdom; So are you kept in labor to no purpose, never
can get from under the works of condemnation, therefore you conclude, None can
ever come to be wholly free while they live, and so make the blood of Christ of
none effect, which we do witness does cleanse from all sin, and save to the
uttermost all that come unto him, the thing which Hagars seed does most oppose,
and scoff at, that wherein we triumph above the world, and Imagemakers, That
our God is a Savior from that which none can be free from who are without him,
though they make many likenesses of him from the letter, the form without the
power, it is to no purpose.

Take notice you several sorts of Worshippers, who worship a God a far off
whom you know not; which if you did there would not be so much contention about
him, what he is, and the way of his worship: Nor can you know him till he be
revealed in you; nor can he be known in you but as you come to be cleansed, for
with him dwells no uncleanesse: Thus you that plead for your sins plead
against your own souls, which cannot be satisfied but by his presence, who is
not seen present where sin is standing.

And by unbelief do you cut your souls off, while you say you can never be
cleansed till after you be dead: here has the Devil deceived you, and so far
prevailed with you, to enter into Covenant with him, while you live to serve
him. And being blinded, this you know not, That you have made Covenant with
Hell and Death, which by God is cursed and troubled: That I know and own, that
troubles your peace, and sets you on seeking; but the way you seek is from
another principle, which is selfish, and shall never obtain peace for you.

He that troubles all that's out of his way, guides and gives peace to all in
his way; the same is a spirit the world knows not, blows where it lists,
therefore never found but in his own way, and will: You who seek him in the
will of man, there cannot find him: nor can your Ministers made by the will of
man tell you of him, where he is, or the way to him: He is not born of that
Generation, not of that Will, nor of that seed is he begotten, therefore not
known to them: therefore they themselves, with all their seeking, not having
found him, can do no less then tell you, that he will never appear more to
his people: that which is written is all the word; and what others have seen
is all the knowledge that any need ever to look for, while the world
continues: and what others have done, that's all you have to talk on for your
righteousness.

And thus the way of Gods walking and working in his people is wholly excluded
from the face of the earth. And a faith you have devised and set up besides it,
if not wholly against it; so that now to witness good works is counted
Popery, (though all that comes to God are foreordained to walk therein, and
to that end new-created) Thus are not men afraid to deny the work of God and
his Righteousness, and yet say you are his workmanship, and that you are in
God and Christ, but out of his works, and must be, in the works of the Devil,
yet God is your Father: Yet in this confusion none must tell you, you are in
Babylon, for then you say, they judge you; nor that they that teach you thus
are Ministers of Antichrist, for that you call railing; though to such the
Spirit of Christ has ever used it. Thus has the Devil set up his work, and
fenced it with the name of highest Faith in the world; and who is under this
Faith, though they sin, yet they say, they can never fall finally, nor
totally, (though the whole man be found in the action,) nor is your sins like
others, because you say you are believers, though both they and you in one
action and nature. So that Faith which you profess is become a defense for
sin: But our Faith is that which overcomes sin, and so to the good work is not
reprobate. And thus you set up a profession without power. But did you mide the
light of Christ that never changes, by it to be taught in Spirit, these deceits
would be soon discovered, and you could not walk in darkness. With it we see
that he that commits sin is of the Devil, and is fallen from God; whatever be
his profession; and there can be no greater fall then to fall from that which
should keep him, into the Devils power, to act according to the Devils
movings, and to bring forth his begettings, and such we know are his children.
With the Light we see that he that is in the way of God is in holiness, and he
that is not is in the way of the Devil; and that he that's in God is out of
self, and there sin is blotted out and forgotten; but he that's in self is in
sin, though he be praying or plowing: with it we see the life of Christ is
pure, and who lives any other life its polluted, though never so finely
covered: with it we see the way of God is perfect, and you whose way is not
perfect is the way of condemnation. With the Light we see him that has not the
word within him, to have no more then the Devil has, who knows the letter and
can preach it; and that he that has not that faith that overcomes sin (in its
measure) has no faith but as the Devils; and that he that has not heard his
voice knows him not; nor he that has not seen him, has no fellowship with
him; and whose heart is filthy can do neither. With the Light we see that who
is in the work of God is in the good work, and he that is not is in the evil,
and whatever he does is abominable; and that he that has not the
righteousness of God, has his own which is imperfect; but who has that of
God, has that which perfectly satisfies both God and man, so far as with it
the creature is covered: With it we see him that has faith without this work,
to be as a body without a spirit, which can do nothing; and that faith is
vain that's without power: And as we see with that which is eternal, so we
judge, and the world receives not our testimony, because the carnal mind is
enmity and cannot he subject, nor can the natural man receive the things of
the Spirit, only those who minds the light of the Spirit discernes and owns
our testimony and receives our witness and his power, who is true, and so
become willing to follow that truth that leads to freedom.

How long have you talked of being a willing people in the day of his power?
but does vain words save you while you are in the power of darkness, and your
own wills standing? Are you a willing people for God when you see with the
light of Christ in your hearts, what you ought to do, and what you ought to
forbear, but your own wills withstands it, and leads you into coveteousnes,
pleasures and wantonness, and selfishnes, contrary to it? And what power is this
which acts you in these ways of unrighteousness, for which your hearts condemns
you? This is the power of darkness, which the light of Christ in your
consciences bears witness against. And thus you have got words instead of power
and life: and you think salvation is in them, crying, the Ordinances of God.
But did God ever ordain a talk without power and life? Is not Christ the
Ordinance, and the end of all Ordinances, who is the way, the truth, and the
life; Is there any Ordinances without him in the Gospel? Or will he accept your
taken on performances from imitation of others which he leads not to in spirit;
Is not he that commands and he that gives power one, who in spirit gives out
his will to every generation, which they who followed imitations could never
own, nor could he ever own their service, whose fear and worship is taught by
the precepts of men, and not by his spirit within: Is not he the Sabbath,
Circumcision, Baptism, the Supper? etc. are not all these in him? and does not
he minister all these in spirit to every one that comes to him? and so the
shadow is come into the substance the end of all shaddows, which is life
indeed, but the figures are not the life, nor can any have the life but who
comes to the end of them; for the outward makes nothing pefect, but the inward
does, all that come unto it, and abide in him. When will you be weary of your
vain imaginations? of a Day to come wherein you must have power? How long have
you been deceived with these vain thoughts? Was not this it you talked on,
twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty years since? yet now further off from it then
ever. And are not these vain words, though you cannot bear it to have them so
called? When will you be ashamed of your vain profession, you that run to seek
God in the high places amongst the hirelings, running from God to seek him
where he is not? And is not this vain profession when nothing is brought
forth but wind, nor is he found by you wherein your fruit is? Those who had
the form and not the power could never find him, then how should you speed
any better that join with them who have neither? for in such a form you
worship as in which God never appeared, but Christ and his ever witnessed
against, and does to this day, yet will not you be instructed, but in your own
wills and ways you will stand, though you find nothing but emptines in it; and
yet you talk of being a willing people in the day of his power; but when will
you have it present who abide in that way where both will and power is wanting.
Free Will you have not, but to follow Satan, who has begot a will in you that
God never created, contrary to, God in all things, and where that will rules it
will not own his power, therefore is that a day a far off you; but the will of
the Devil and his power is persent, and acts you at his pleasure, and you are
offended that any should witness being set free from it.

Thus you are suffered to please your vain minds, the day to talk on, but the
night and deeds of darkness you must walk in, else your old master is highly
d^spleased; and if any call you to the Light he says its Delusion: and as for
freedom from sin, or the way to perfection, that's most dangerous Heresy and
Delusion.

And thus he makes you most afraid of freedom, least any of you should believe
in the Son which leads to it: for the Devil knows, if he can but keep you from
believing it, you are sure for ever coming to it, for as is every man's faith
so shall be his freedom: Thus you stand afar off, and cry, take heed of
Delusion and deceiving, when you have naught but your sins to be deceived on;
nor can you say you have ought in you that's pure, but that which you deny in
your conscience which is a witness against you: and this is the cry of all who
are deceived already, in all forms in the world: But who have the Spirit that
can try all things is bold as a Lion, and will not receive nor hold fast any
thing but that which is good, that none can take from him.

The Heathen were ever afraid to be spoiled of their Idols, and so are you of
your Images you have set up, and formed from others every one according to your
own wills. If shadows and likenesses could save, then would it be found in
these Nations, who have of all sorts, and statures tall and with heads of Gold
some of them, which you zealously worship, and compel others also who know no
better. And this is that they serve for, for they cannot save you, only they
serve you to contend about, and keep you doing, least you should wait upon God
alone, and be saved from your sins, and then the Devils Kingdom were broken,
wherefore he feeds you with a profession, and form without power. And of
likenesses you may choose from one to another, yet all in his Kingdom of sin
and imperfection, as long as you live that's his limit, and for no less time
will he have his Covenent: and you are willing to enter into it with him, and
plead for it, exceedingly mad against any that break it, or believe in him that
redeems from it; nay so blind and deaf are you, that if any have found
freedom, you cannot abide to hear them declare it; and the end of Christ's
coming must not be preached, nor his Covenant that is pure and without sin, as
he is that made it: and so each Covenant is like its Master. And this we do
witness and see now at present, which you know not who look not for it till
after death, therefore sin must stand in that Covenant, because you have not
our keeper, for God has so concluded it. And the Light is in the world where
all are sinners, but none have the life, but who receive the Light and join to
it, and are led out of the world by it; to such sheep Christ is keeper who
follow him out of uncleannes, and for such he is become an undertaker, the
strong man to bind and cast out, who believe that he will do it for them; but
the swine he keeps not, the shepherd they will not follow, there the Devil
must enter and have power, and into the Sea must they headlong.

Take heed carnal professors, whose Religion looks downward into the earth,
the Sea is next, and the place is steep. And you have naught to keep who deny
the life of purity and perfection, which we have in the holy God, as all ever
had who lived in him; And in him is truth and freedom; but a lie there is in
all your likenesses, and you are blind and will not see it, all you who have a
God and Christ and a worship which does not make the comers thereto perfect,
nor set you above the Devil, nor overcome his temptations. Your God and King
we know, which keeps you in the earth, which you will curse if ever you look
upward, your peace we know and the end of it, your Kingdom with all its glory;
when from this world you are taken, there is your parting, when he shall break
your Covenant, whose Covenant you have broken, and would not hear him, though
you pretended still to seek him. That's his call which in your consciences lets
you see you have lost him, which did you wait in it would lead you to him, but
erring from it you are out of his way and counsel, and all other ways is to
no purpose: his Light is that which searches your hearts in secret, nor can
any other judge you in private, yet from that you will be running, to ask
counsel at them who know not your condition, so instead of God you consesse to
men that cannot judge you, nor help you; while you go to the natural you leave
the spiritual, and so with natural words you seed the natural
comprehensions, but the spiritual man seeds not at that fountain; for its the
spiritual that thirsts, which not minded, the natural runs, and seeds above
it, and this being above you cannot receive the food of the Spirit, therewith
to God to be reconciled, and quickened; nor is that fed that death has passed
over, nor out of death is it raised, but that which lives in you is for death,
and by feeding on that wisdom the veil is thickened, and the eternal is out
of your knowledge; yet you say, God is a Spirit, and teaches in Spirit, and
will be worshipped in Spirit, but cannot endure to hearken to any thing within
you, nor turn to that Spirit.

How blind are you led with your blind guides; Is not that which is
spiritual within? or can it be known any where else? Is God known by hearsay?
then who is it that knows him not? Can the carnal eye see the spiritual God,
or the carnal ear hear him? then should not his ministry be to the spirits in
prison, to open the blind eyes, and to unstop the dease ears, yea where the
carnal is open. But this you know not who have eyes and see not, ears and
hear not, and hands which never handled the word of life; yet would you be
teaching others, that which you never saw nor heard, and to this teaching you
would limit others. Paul was sent to open the blind eyes, yet was he sent to
those who had eyes as you have, with which they could see to stone him and whip
him, and ears to hear him, and call what he said heresy, and blasphemy, as
you do, and as ever the carnal judged of the spiritual, who has not an ear
to hear what the Spirit says.

Oh unwise people, you have but one thing that lets you see your evil, yet
will you not turn to that for teaching, nor that eye you love not which lets
you see your darkness. You cry you have nothing that's good in you, yet will
you not own that which lets you see it is so, and thus you keep Covenant with
darkness, though death and destruction be the end of it; but the Covenant of
Light which shines in darkness you regard not, that's far below your
comprehensions, nay its the least seed in you (which we know is the seed of the
kingdom) trodden under foot by the kingdom of the world: therefore nothing
else leads out of the world, but that whose kingdom is not in it, and with
this seed is the Covenant; which seed you know not who take pleasure in the
flesh, that's of another kingdom, to which is no Covenant, but Death and Hell:
Yet you talk of Abraham and his Covenant, and Promise, but that in Abraham in
which the Covenant was, established was that which led him out out of the
world, wherein he became a stranger, and wanderer, as that seed ever is, which
you call vagabonds, persecute and imprison, you that have rule in this world,
showing that you are not of that seed that entertaines strangers, nor in that
Covenant where all are strangers and Pilgrims in this world; nor do you own
that which divides you from this world, being uncircumcised in heart, which to
be is the seal of Abraham's faith: and so you whose life is in the earth are far
off from Abraham's bosom, Faith, and Covenant, which is only to his seed, not
to the seed of evil doers; not to seeds which is many, but to one which is
Christ: So in the world, out of Christ; and out of Christ, out of Gods
Covenant; for his Promises are all yea and amen to them that are in Christ
Jesus, but not to them that abide in the world. Who owns him as King cannot
want the Promise, neither can you have it who abide in the world: therefore you
apply the words, but want the life which is the power, nor can your literal
Promises suit your condition, nor save you from Satan's power; but as all
others, who think salvation to be in the letter, so do you, deny leading and
guiding of the Spirit, in which the power is placed, therefore the Light you
will not follow, neither can you believe it to be sufficient; And he that
denies the Light cannot own the Lord of life. So you are ignorant of God and
his way in which he makes himself krovvne to his people, and so takes up your
rest in outward observations, set up and upholden in the wills of men, and for
such traditions you are zealous, and strongly contend for them, but the Law of
God written in your own hearts you make of none effect, while you deny to be
ruled according to it; yet you say, We are in the new Covenant, when you are in
the old traditions; and what you know is from others: But the least in that
Covenant knows him and his preferce, and witness him true according to his
promise, ever manifesting his power to undertake for us against all our
enemies, a present help in time of trouble, and we know him in whom we have
believed, where he is, and the way to him, have seen the glory of his kingdom,
and the powers of the eternal World, the house wherein are many Mansions, yet
the lowest place is pure, for which the Lord alone prepares his people, and
their way which the creature cannot do of himself, only Christ does it where
self is denied, and self-will, for by the will of man comes no promise, nor
obtains that (will) any performance; So he begets both the will and the deed,
which you know not where your wills is standing, by him not forgotten, who in
your wills make a profession, and in the same wills contend for it, with which
you can fight, and sue, and trade in the world, and heap together, and what you
will you pray and ask for, and grudge if you be not satisfied; but if you
compass your desires, in that will the lust catches the gift, but you forget
the giver, so that mercies become a curse to you, which to those who in the
will of God stands are a blessing, which will of God is to keep the heart and
eye to the Creator and giver, and if such receive not the giver, the gift is
nothing that satisfies, because the virtue and fullness is wanting whereby the
gift is sanctified.

Thus is God prized and praised in his own Will, a sacrifice for ever accepted:
Therefore Christ must not be offered up in his own will, but in the will of the
Father, Mat. 26. 39. and in that will he had power to lay down his life, and
again to take it up, thus he is become our example, whom we delight, in the
same will, to follow, which you that read this in the Scripture with your own
wills cannot, therefore to you the cross is preached, which must be taken up
ere you can follow the example.

This is the slumbling Stone and Rock of offense God has laid to prove you,
who say you love God, and say, Thy will be done in earth, but loves your own
wills better, as your practices witness to your face daily, when his will is
your sanctification, but yours is pollution, and to live in uncleanness,
against which he has given testimony, witness that in all your consciences
which is pure, declaring daily to your faces that he consents not to your
sins, nor takes delight in your destruction, and here Gods love is tendered,
and your love is tried: God so loves the world that he has given his Son a
light into the world, that whosoever believes and follows him shall not abide
in Death and darkness, but shall have the light of life; and this we know who
love his appearance, and that he has loved us first; and in that love we
follow him, and call to all to come to it: But how do you answer this love of
his, who abide in the love of the world, where the Fathers love dwells not, nor
with his light will you be led out of the world where his love dwells,
thereof to be partakers; yet you will talk of it where it is not, and these
vain words cannot save you, God is light and in him is no darkness at all,
and if we walk in the Light as he is in the Light, then have we fellowship
with him, and the blood of Christ cleanses us from all sin; But what is this to
you who walk in darkness, not cleansed, nor can you believe that ever you can
be while you live; yet would you not be called unbelievers, though that faith
that purifies the heart you cannot own; yes say you, we believe we shall be
cleansed after we be dead in another world, so your faith must work hereafter,
but is dead at present, such a faith as never was professed by any you read of;
but that faith we witness which overcomes this world, and this is present
power, as the Saints have found it, and born witness of it, that God was
faithful who had given them a measure, above which was no temptation; but your
gift is to come, so temptations prevails for the present, and you cannot own
them where it does not, thus you put far from you the good day the Lord and
his power, which now is present where he is received, and believed; And by such
he is praised who by faith are redeemed, above the pollutions of this world,
the strange land wherein they were captivated, into freedom, where Sions song
is sung, which you cannot unredeemed.

And here see your praises which arise from a vain mind in your own wills
and imitations, but not from a soul redeemed, quickened, and set free from the
power of sin and temptation, so your praises are not living praises, nor from a
living principle of the living God, but from that principle where death reigns,
and the seed of God is in prison, so you praise you know not what, who are
still unredeemed from bondage, but where redemption is witnessed there that
seed is raised, the bonds of death are broken, the way of life is found, and
this being known in the life, then with understanding God is praised, and with
the same spirit which he has raised which only with God is accepted, without
respect of persons, and here the works of God praise him, and in his Saints he
is glorified, and admired in all who are raised above the graves, who are in
him and see his work: and this Church is rightly gathered, who out of sin,
death, and darkness, is brought into God, who is holy, with whom dwells no
unclean thing.

Here are the pure praises where the Sons of God sing together, having the
Psalm given of the Father; these praises are pure which from him comes, and to
him returns freely, but this is not known to the sons of bondage, nor believed
by you, therefore you sit down in a shadow empty, and form without power, nor
the presence of God you have not, who take your rest in fleshly forms; that
eye cannot see him, nor know him, thus in your sins you perish, for want of his
knowledge, who is our life eternal, and to you is freely tendered, but by your
unbelief denied, and so his love rejected.

All you that are in the world, who lie in wickedness, God so loves you that he
has sent his Son into the world to you, a witness against the world, and all
the deeds of it, that they are evil; but all that own and follow him, into the
good work he leads them, and out of the evil he keeps us: and that is his
light which in your consciences shines in the midst of darkness, which you
comprehend not with your dark minds, nor sensual wisdom, yet a faithful
witness is it against your deeds of darkness, declaring your end, and death
upon your life, and sorrow and howling upon your laughter, condemning your vain
pleasures, and invention, with which you spend your precious time, which should
be redeemed and not spent unprofitably, which with the light the Saints and
redeemed ones are led to, to redeem the time; and this is our diligence, and
delight in: but yours is to spend it, showing a contrary nature and leader, a
contrary delight in a contrary kingdom, with whom you joined, and to whom you
are fashioned according to the course of this world, and the Prince and powers
of it which rules in children, where disobedience is born and brought forth.

And thus you are united into that nature which God has appointed the Devil to
be Prince of, and wrath and woe the end of, and so God is justified herein,
that you who despise the riches of his light in Christ Jesus, should be left in
darkness, therewith to be guided, and in Chains reserved, till the great day,
in which you shall be judged by the light now denied, with your carnal reason,
prudence and wisdom, from which God has hid the things of our kingdom, in
all generations, and that is the darkness even your wisdom and prudence which
is the greatest light you have to judge withal, most sought and prized by you
who deny the light of Christ, and this wisdom when it speaks calls light
darkness, and darkness light, so did they ever who with it judged: And this is
your condition, who deny the light of Christ, and say its not sufficient, but
prefer your comprehensions and imaginations above it, and that was ever it
with which people resisted the counsel of God against themselves; and this is
his counsel, and all you know of him, that which is manifest in you, which
moves against sin and wickedness, and would lead out of it if you did it
follow. The same that condemns you for sin when you had done it, the same
would lead out of it before it be acted, and so keep out of condemnation.

And now honestly consider if you have such a Counselor, who is with you at
all times, and faithful to you in showing the evil, to which you are
unfaithful when you forget it, and turn from it for your self ends; and the
righteous pure way he shows you with the light in your Conscience, which you
reject for earthly pleasures, and know when you do it; yet will you pray that
God would show you his way, and make you wise to salvation; but when he has
freely done it, you will not walk in it nor own no such wisdom, because it
comes contrary to your own wills; yet you will say the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God, yet will you not own that which is foolishness to the
world, to guide you, out of it, though there be nothing else appointed to do
it, but that is contrary to it: thus in words you confess him, but in works
deny him, and his counsel: yet you say, wherein do we deny him? do not we
profess his name and Covenant, and wait for his righteousness, thereby to be
saved? I say, it serves you to talk on, therewith to cover you while you are
serving the other Master, the Devil, and the world; but his Covenant you put
far from you, his name, and his righteousness whereby we are redeemed.

What Covenant have you, who deny the light of Christ to guide you? was not he
given for an everlasting Covenant of Light, both to Jew and Gentile? and in his
light all that knew him was guided, according to the several administrations
both of Law and Gospel. And when they turned from his light in Spirit, to men's
teaching from the letter, then they set up carnal worships instead of
spiritual obedience, then they became wise in their own eyes, and zealous for
their customs, but by him was rejected, who is worshipped in Spirit: And with
you it is the same now, though you cannot see nor believe it, no more then they
did when they were told of it by them who in the light walked, and stood in his
counsel, which all errors discovers; they made the Law of God void through
their tradition, walking after the Fathers; so do you that Law God has
written in your heart, by following your companions and learned Rabbis; they
said and did not, and so do you also; nay herein you exceed them, who have a
higher profession, but less practice; they did not believe him come who is to
fulfill all righteousness for, and in all that believe and follow him; but
this Christ you profess, and the Scripture that so witnesses of him, yet are
you farther from it then ever they were, both in practice and opinion; they
kept to the letter in the Forms of their worship, though they had lost the life
and power, but you have left the lettr and lead one another in your inventions;
so that you have no plain Scripture for your worship performed by you in your
Idols Temple. And for your opinion of Gods righteousness you far exceed them:
they put it from them to another generation, waiting for him to come, who was
appointed King of it, asking when it should come, showing a desire to see it,
but you have put it wholly from you into another world; and if any have found
it and its power and purity, and bear witness of it, whereby the body of sin
is destroyed, and the soul freed, and the creature redeemed from committing
sin, your faith believes it to be the greatest blasphemy in the world, nay you
dare not come near it, lest you should be infected, but consult how to banish
it out of the Nations as an error not to be tolerated in the world.

Thus you profess a Redeemer, but he must be a man whose Redemption must be of
another world, and there must he work his work, but the old work of the Devil
must stand in this world: yet the more to blind you, and that you may the more
blind others; he sets you on talking that Christ is your Righteousness, when
you never knew him so in you, who is stronger then the God of this world to
bind him, and take you out of his Kingdom, and break that Covenant whose faith
is, that you must be subject to him while you live in this world, which is such
a faith and Covenant as none ever professed who believed in the name of Jesus,
at which every knee bows who has his name, and he that bears that name
departs from iniquity, and bears testimony to his righteousness, here in this
world, in the midst of the untoward and unrighteous generation of this dark
world, that so God may be glorified in his creatures, by his light shining, and
his righteousness reigning, above the unrighteous principle of the devil which
he has begot in the untoward Nature, and in such the Devil is denied and
disowned before the world, where God is obeyed; and such are his servants,
sons, and Daughters who obey him and wait upon him, that they may bring to
light what he works in them, even that which none else can work but he alone
that is pure, nor can any bring it forth but by his power, and thus his works
praise him in the gates of the wicked, where the floods of ungodlines do most
swell and rage, even then in his people does this kingdom stand in
Righteousness, and Peace, and Joying in holiness.

And this we witness to be that Covenant, and that power by which we are
entered into that inheritance which is eternal, and are made partaker of the
divine nature, which nature is righteous, merciful, and just, meek and
patient, faithful and diligent to the obedience of the Cross; long-suffering,
full of love, moderation, and temperance, and in all things thereby are
transformed into his holiness, so far as we are entered into, and abide in
this Covenant, so that we can truly say, here he is all and self is nothing,
but abhorred, because it is polluted, the eye being now open that's only taken
with affection to that which is holy: And with this eye we see you, your name,
your Covenant; and your righteousness, which all lies under the power
ofdarknesse. Is not that light which is in you become darkness, who have your
way to seek without you? What name is in you when the Serpents seed is still
unbruised, who is head and rules in you? where the Name of Jesus is, the
Devils tremble and bow, as God has appointed, and they that know his name do
it witness. What is your righteousness who bring forth that which is
imperfect, which with the light of the Covenant is condemned? Is this the
righteousness of Jesus, which does not satisfy God and man, being witnessed
by that in the Conscience?

And now you may see what it is you profess in this world, and in what stead
it will stand you in the day of evil, which is condemned already with that in
your Consciences. But you use to say that the Righteousness of God you look
for hereafter, to be covered with it at the day of Judgment, but not in this
life; I say what is this then you are now doing, which you are here preaching,
pressing, and practicing, whose is this Righteousness? is it either Gods, or
your own selfe-Righteousnesse? which if it be Gods it endures for ever, but if
not, it is abomination what ever it seems to you, whose eye is blinded, and so
professes and practices and presses an abominable sacrifice; and know not that
you do evil: for this I say, Better no righteousness then that which is not
Gods, for such is spiritual wickedness in heavenly places, and the long
prayers of such is abomination, and they receive the greater Damnation, and of
such Christ says, Publicans and Harlots take the Kingdom before them. But you
say, Must we not pray then? I say, wait for the spirit of prayer, which only
is heard, and without which none know what to pray; for and with that prayer
which helps the infirmities, and gives the understanding; only such are
answered in what they pray for: what effect has thy prayers which are
abomination? does God hear a contrary spirit? thou that delightst in
wickedness, God will not hear that prayer; that is out of the Covenant; and
thou art in that nature that God has cursed from him, and its in vain for
thee to bless it; And this is the cause why nothing you do is accepted,
because it is performed in the disobedient cursed Nature, and there is Cains
sacrifice, and Esan's prayers and tears. And you that abide in that nature,
are of those who said, Why have we fasted and prayed, and thou have not
regarded? you call, but receive no answer. But did you but mind that in your
Conscience which is pure, you would see how often he has called to you, and
checked you for sin, but you have not answered: There might you read the cause
why you call, but he does not answer, as he has said, Because I called, and
you would not answer, therefore when you cry I will not answer.

And thus it is with you who observe the outward worships, but mind not the
Spirit which is given to profit withal in the worship: and though all have a
measure, yet you that hide your talent, cannot pray with the Spirit, nor with
the understanding; and so your fellowship is with the form, but not in the
power; with men in words, but not with God; and so your times are in your own
hands; and you have resolved them beforehand; And you have a time to pray, and
a time to play; a time to abstain from your lusts, and a time to fulfill your
lusts; a day to abstain from the world, and days to conform to the world; and
thus not being guided with that Spirit which is before all, to lead and bring
you out of time, you are still in observations, and your times of Religion, and
your times in the world; your customs in Religion, and your customs in the
world, are both in your own will, and corrupt nature, and so your prayers are
abomination, and your plowing sin: But the times of Sons and Daughters are not
in their own hands; and this we have learned of Jesus in Spirit, not to please
our selves, nor to be men-pleasers, but to be obedient to another principle,
which moves contrary to the will of all men, for him we witness who is not
borne after the will of man, but which the will of man could never own, who by
the wills of men ever suffered, where he is borne into the world; and the same
this day is manifest, a seed contrary to the seed of evil doers, and a
righteousness that exceedes the righteousness of the world, that which is
amongst the greatest professions; and this is that holiness without which none
shall see God. But say you, this is that Righteousness we believe in, and by
which we are justified, by that blood which was shed at Jerusalem, and by that
obedience that was in him, and by that holiness; but that the want of his
righteousness, in us, or, that want of Christ or his blood in us can hinder
our justification, that we deny, and look upon it to be Heresy and false
Doctrine; for it is Christ without us that has satisfied for sin, and not
Christ in us; and his blood without us, and his righteousness without us; and
his faith and patience, meekness and sufferings, hope, and love, and obedience
etc. its these without us that whoever believes in shall be saved, and by this
faith the ungodly is justified,

To which I say, He that believes not what Christ suffered at Jerusalem, with
all his obedience and Righteousness, and that he bare our sins in himself, and
trod the winepress alone, and alone was well pleasing to the Father, and that
in him alone the work of Redemption is placed, and wrought, with much more
which may be truly said of him; I say, whosoever believes not this, cannot be
saved, neither can he ever come to receive Christ within him, working and
witnessing the same in Spirit, as is declared in the letter: nor can he come
to witness him that is greater in him, then he that is in the world, giving him
victory over the Devil, Sin, and the World; because God has placed all power
in Heaven and Earth in him; and without faith in him who is that power, none
can come to it, nor receive it, but in him in whom God has freely given it;
Nor can any have him, and be without it, all the promises of life and salvation
being in him Yea and Amen.

But now you that make the receiving of him to stand in a bare confessing with
the tongue, when the heart believes not unto righteousness, and that this is
that faith, a persuasion from the letter, or from the knowledge of others, that
such a one dyed at Jerusalem, and rose again, and from thence conclude, that
all shall be saved, and are believes, that profess this Faith, though they come
not to the Fellowship of his sufferings and of his resurrection in themselves,
and so come to witness his death and life manifest in their mortal flesh, and
so the body of sin put off by the body, and washed with the blood of Christ,
and so be baptized into his death, dead with him to sin, and alive with him to
righteousness, and true obedience to the Father in their measures.

I say, you that say that a bare persuasion or outward Confession is that faith
that justifies the ungodly without Christ in them; Then what are you doing when
you say, Stand off me, for I am more holy then thou, and are gathering from
them, who all believe with this faith as well as you, only they differ from
you in other practices, as some open sins and the like: and why have not the
greatest drunkards, and swearers, or who remongers, as good right to Christ and
Churchfellowship as you have? or why do you hinder them from that which you
call the Seals, or Sacraments, seeing that faith in Christ is the ground of
interest to all that belongs to Christ?

Do not you according to your own principle exclude believers even of the same
faith with you? and who are those unbelievers you tell on who are condemned?
and to whom do you preach faith in these Nations, seeing you can find none in
them, who are come to understanding, Papist nor Protestant, but they believe
this with you, That Christ dyed at Jerusalem? If hereby they be justified
before God, how dare you charge any thing upon them or separate from them if
God have owned them? Also many hundred thousand pounds a year may be spared
which are spent under this pretense, as to make people believers when all they
preach to are believers already, and have that faith that justifies the
ungodly. And whose is the righteousness people are exhorted to bring forth? if
the Righteousness of Christ that is necessary to salvation be only without
them; then whose is that you call for within them? But if you say, they must
have some of the righteousness of Christ within them, and the rest without
them, then why do not you describe a measure, that people may know how much to
look for, and when they come to an end of their labors; and how much they must
do before Christ will undertake to do the rest: Or if Christ have done all,
how much of it must they do over again before they come to their rest, and to
be accepted: and differ what it is that must be brought forth from within, and
what must be believed without, but not enjoyed within, that so people may come
to see what is Christ and what is self righteousness, and where they are, that
they may avoid the one, and receive the other.

But thus you lie in confusion; from which by that faith which stands in Jesus,
we are freed: and have received his righteousness to which we are obedient,
by which we are purified, by bringing forth that which he begets, as
formerly we were defiled by bringing forth that which was begotten by the
Devil, and so through obedience of the Spirit our souls are purified, and we
become conformable to him that is gone before us, who received light and
obedience, and power from the Father, and so became the first fruits unto
perfection and holiness, through whom we receive power for obedience, grace for
grace, by which we are saved, and our life is in him, and our obedience, and
he is all in us, which we receive of the Father who has wrought all our
works in us, and so ordaines peace for us; yea beyond all that you know, or
can believe, who know not Christ in you. So you have set up a reprobate faith,
that you cannot but be servants of sin while you live in this world, and so are
to every good work reprobate.

But you use to say, You have that, which Christ did in his own person,
evidenced to you, that he did it for you particularly, which drunkards,
swearers, and the like have not. I say your Evidence is but in words and
conceit, who have not Christ in you, no more then theirs is: You are persuaded
and hope it is so, and so are they also, but neither of you bring forth the
fruits that are his. But you say, you bring forth better fruits then drunkards
and swearers. I say, the best fruit that's brought forth in either, which is
not the work of God by Christ in you, is but selfe-righteousnesse, and all
your self, taken on performances in your own wills is no better. But you say,
you do what you can, and God accepts the will for the deed, but so do not
those who are openly wicked. I say, God accepts no will but his own, and this
he begets by his Spirit in all that wait upon him in the light of Jesus, and
with such he that begets the will, begets the deed also; and it is no more
what we can, but what he will with whom all things are possible, and we can
do nothing, neither do we desire to do any thing, yet can we do all things
that he wills, through him that in us; so the will of God is done in us by his
power (in our measures) as it is in Heaven, and this is perfect righteousness,
where Christ is all, and the Creature nothing. And as for your doing, and
others not doing* I say every one has that opinion of himself, that he is
not so bad as others, and with this the* Devil deceives you, to keep all in
his kingdom. And by this opinion of yours none is to be condemned, who has any
worse then himself in his doings: for this must needs follow from the best to
the worst; unless you describe how far it must go and no further; and then
must you needs shut out some who have endeavored as much against sin (in
their own strength) as ever you did in yours.

I have known a drunkard shed more tears, set stronger resolutions, and make
more vows, against that filthy sin of Drunkenness, then ever I knew the
greatest professor do against his secret covetousness, which is Idolatry: Nay
the highest professions can plead for it (though not under that name) and make
a trade on it, which the other is ashamed to do for his drunkenness. Now if
God had placed righteousness and acceptance in doing what one can, then why
should not the first of these be accepted as well as the latter, seeing he
prays and weeps and does what he can to overcome it? And thus all sorts of
people in the world, who know not Christ and his strength in them (which alone
is appointed by God to overcome sin for all that receive him) I say you are all
in confusion laboring to no purpose, one condemning another, thereby to get
peace to your selves, but all under the curse, and so is the fruit you bring
forth, because it is not in Jesus, and he in you, in whom the Father has
placed fruit and acceptance, peace and reconciliation, to whom all shall
confess for ever.

And now to all honest hearts, in whom there is a seed of God, who are thus
scattered in this body of confusion, having lost the way of truth, peace, and
righteousness, so that you cannot come to that which makes perfect, but are at
a loss with all you can do, and are condemned with that in your conscience,
that you are not covered with the righteousness of God, but are found naked
and miserable: I say that which condemns you who are out of the way, is the
light that leads to the way, for whatsoever makes manifest is light; so that
which makes manifest your darkness, is that light that shines in darkness to
lead out of darkness, that condemns you while you are in it. But that which,
cries peace in darkness is the Prince of darkness, to keep in darkness. That
which condemns the World, is the light of the World, given to lead out of the
World all that believe and follow it; and such are justified by the light, that
their deeds are wrought in God, and by him: which light reproves the evil
deeds not wrought by him.

I say this is the light of Christ given into the world, that whosoever
believes and follows shall not abide in darkness but have the light of life.
Now read all the Scriptures and see if there be any other Covenant but this
Covenant of light, and this is the life which is the light of men, which
darkness comprehends not, nor the world knows not, in which alone the power is
placed, which whoever receives becomes the Sons of God, as the Father has
appointed, which he will not alter, the Covenant, for all the world: therefore
all that are out of the light, are out of the Covenant where God has placed
his power: And if you would give your goods to the poor, and your body to the
fire, its to no purpose, because you are out of this love of the Father.
Therefore all are first called to believe in the light ere they can be
accepted: for without faith its impossible to please God, or be found in his
work, or receive his power; so all your labor brings not forth that which is
accepted, but with the light is condemned, that it is not perfect, and so you
sit down in sorrow, notwithstanding all your labors which are out of the
light, where God has promised no peace, nor power; for God does not manifest
his works in the darkness, but in the light, that all the Children of light
may see and praise him who does all for his own glory, which the Children of
darkness see not who are out of the light of Christ. So such talk of what God
has done, and what he will do, but know him not at present, nor his power,
working all their works in them.

Therefore this I say to all who desire to know him, that you stand still in
the light of Jesus, that you may come to see the life and its movings; and the
powers of death, and its movings; that you may see what spirit works
obedience* and what spirit works disobedience, so shall you see what is done in
the body; if the eye be single, then is there no place for darkness, but it is
discovered. So with the light you come to discern each Spirit, and each
principle, and their several workings; and that the one is the powers that
works in the light, that works to obedience; the other is the powers that
works in darkness, and works to disobedience: and as God has appointed that
the one shall not work in darkness, so the other shall not work in the light:
for as he has given to the Devil the powers of darkness, to work in the
Children of darkness, that they all may be damned who will not receive the
light; so has he reserved the light pure, and therein placed his power, that
so none may fail who believe in it; and here is the blessing and the cursing;
the Election and reprobation, the light and the darkness, both which the light
discovers as it arises in all who in it believe and wait. And if you abide in
the light, you will see none can curse what God has blessed, nor bless what he
has cursed; for as the one of these leads to the life from whence it comes,
all that believe and follow it, so the other down to death all that abide in
it: for none in the light did ever perish, nor out of it was ever saved,
whatever is their profession.

In the light is the power, and the power in the light, for this is one in
Christ Jesus; and in this light if you keep waiting, with it you shall see the
motions of sin which are after the flesh, working in you, drawing your minds
after them to obey them; and you shall see at the same time the motions of the
Spirit in the meek principle drawing you to the contrary; so that if you be not
rash to follow the motions of the flesh, but with the light take counsel, you
shall see every word and action discovered to you, in the light, of what sort
they are of, from what root they arise, and what they tend to; and here you
come to the knowledge of sin, and who begets it in the Creature, and the
knowledge of Righteousness, and who begets it in the creature: and here in
plainness you come to see your Father and whose Children you are, even his whom
you obey; for if you bring forth the works of the Devil, which he begets in
you, then are you his Children; but if you deny the works of the Devil, and
to bring them to light, then God gives you power to bring so th what he will
beget in you in the light, and men seeing that work of God brought forth into
the world, thereby is God glorified; and this is not a talking of God, but a
living to him in your measure, and here shall you grow up (in the obedience) in
the knowledge of Christ, and learn him of God, and the way to him; so every
one that has learned of the Father comes to me, John 6. 44. 45. And none
can come to me, except my Father draw them; so shall you see the Law written
in your hearts, which discovers lust and uncleanness, even in your hearts in
the first rise of it; and you will come to see that this Law is pure and must
be fulfilled every jot and title, else no passing, and when you see none can
fulfill it in its righteousness and purity, then is way made for Christ; and so
the law is the Schoolmaster to lead to him where the righteousness is placed
and power to fulfill it, who is the end of it for righteousness to every one
that believes. And as your minds are kept to this Law that God has written to
show sin and evil, you will come to see the power that sin has not over you,
and that you are wholly polluted and sold under it; then will you see the great
transgression, and the fear of God will appear in you, and so your hearts
will grow tender in his fear, which is but the beginnings of the knowledge of
God and his wisdom: And so waiting in the light, you will come to see openings
and breathings after Christ Jesus, in which abiding and waiting low in the
fear you will come to see some openings and promises of the Fathers Love to
that seed which is breathing in you after him, and some hopes of pardon of sin
in Christ Jesus, and so come to see the Law and the Prophets, prophesying which
condition many have come to, and then have lost their condition by the minds
getting out of the fear, and flesh exalting into the promise, and so come to
get the wound heald before death be flaine, and so loses that little communion
they had with God afarr off, but never come so far as to the washing thoroughly,
nor to the marriage, but the light mind gets into this, and tattles it out to
others, and calls it experience, yet never came so far as to see Christ and the
Father, yet after these does the world wonder, notwithstanding they live in the
same filthiness as they did formerly; yet say they, I have assurance so many
years since, and the promise of God is sure, and his Covenant cannot be broken,
but cannot see that the condition is lost, and the seed is buried under the
earthly pleasures, to which the promise was: for the promise is to the seed
which is one, not to seeds which is many Gal. 3. 16. not to the fleshly man
which is now got up, but to the spiritual seed which is meek and lowly, which
God teaches and blesses, and the creature that turns to it is blessed
because of that meek Spirit into which they are turned, and should be for ever,
if in it they did continue; for to it is the Covenant which cannot be broken,
therefore all that depart out of it, it will not follow; for then should not
the Covenant stand sure in that seed which is but one, one heart, one mind,
one soul, one spirit; and whosoever receives this unity of faith, shall find
this Covenant sure: but this was never placed in the worldly seed, but in the
spiritual: so the carnal is death, and hell, that is its covenant; but the
spiritual is life and peace, that is its Covenant; and each Covenant stands
sure to them who are in them. So that creature who was sometimes tender and
lowly minded, and that seed awakened to which is the promise, not waiting in
the promise till it be performed; the creature turns into the world where the
curse is, and there inherits, yet is the Covenant sure to the seed and all that
abide in it; and this all witness who have waited in their measure, though he
that turns from it is damned.

And if you abide faithful in the light waiting, you will be so far from
turning into the liberty of the flesh, that you will see every vain thought
and Imagination judged, in the first motion, and the ground of all sin you will
see laid open, and so come to see the Axe laid to the root of the corrupt
tree, that has brought forth the evil fruit, which is John's Ministry, and
the Baptism of Repentance, and so be led on to him who fulfills all
righteonsness; and that kingdom you will hear preached at hand, which
consists not in words, but in power; then vain babblers, you will come to see
and avoid, and be brought only to press after Righteousness, and so see
your light grow and spring up to the burning and shining, till the day star
arise in your hearts; then will you cease to put God and Christ afar off you,
and wait to see Christ in you the hope of Glory; and so come to see Christ in
you the light, the way, the truth, and the life, and not to have your light and
life to seek in a book without you, nor from men, but Christ your life in
you, made manifest in your mortal bodies; and so coming to the Son, and to see
him revealed, by him come to have the Father revealed also, and so come to the
knowledge of God which is life eternal, even God in his Temple, where he is
worshipped in Spirit and truth, and this truth in you, and this God in you:
then shall you know that your bodies are the Temples of the living God, as he
has said, I will dwell in them and walk in them, 2 Cor. 6: 16. And that the
Spirit of God dwells in you, 1 Cor. 3. 16. By which Spirit he is worshipped,
and by the same Spirit you are taught, and this is not known by hearsay, nor
got by imitation, nor taught in the imaginations, but through death it is
learned, only in those who in the light are guided, and by the Spirit kept, in
the fire, and in the water, where death is slain, faith purifyed, and the body
cleansed and purged from its dross and filthiness, patience given and proved,
and all the gifts and graces of God which vain minds talk on, but know not
but in words, these to be waited for in the light, received in the faith, and
proved in the patience, to the bringing the Creature wholly to rely upon God in
the worst condition, even at their wits ends, when all the world fails and
becomes enemies, then to fall into the defense of God alone; or when the world
tempts with the greatest pleasures, then to deny all for the love of God; this
is soon talked on, but none can have it but who have received it in the same
way of obedience that Christ has gone before, and leads in Spirit and power
all his after him, who believe in his light and follow it: Then may you say,
follow us as we follow Christ, and walk as you have us for examples; till
then you are but imitators, and out of the life and power, and so lead one
another into forms and traditions, but deny the power which should give you
victory over sin in this world; and so you get the Saints words, but their
lives you have not; that you look for in another world, but in the mean time
goes on to fill up the measure of evil, and so go to the grave in fear and
torment: And all those Calls and Reproves of the Spirit of light in your own
hearts, now by you slighted, are by him recorded, and remains a testimony
against you till that dreadful appearance of the righteous Judge, and
heart-searcher, showing his love tendered, and his desire to save from sin and
condemnation; which love being rejected, there is no escaping condemnation.

And you that have formed a Christ in your own imaginations, so as your pride,
lust, riot and oppression may be exalted, and you in them; and now your eyes
are abroad, expecting his coming without you in observations of days, years,
persons and forms, lo here, lo there, and the time and manner of his reign,
you are jangling about, and what a-one he shall be; and which of you shall be
greatest at his coming, and such like conceits without you, has the enemy up
amongst you, till you have wholly lost the favor of Christ within, and can
neither know his appearance in your selves, nor believe him in others, in whom
he is come, nor know what a one he shall be: What a Christ is this you are
looking for? Is he the same that was from the beginning, whose kingdom is not
of this world? and do you look for him after another manner then he has
appeared? is he not the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever? how has the
enemy of your souls deceived you, and keeps you spending hours and days,
talking of him what he was, and what he will be at a distance without you, but
knows not him at hand what he is, so that when he would appear in you to
lead you out of the world, you know not his voice, nor will you obey him in
spirit, because he is not come in your form, nor teaches after your will, and
in your way, so is he now set at naught by you builders as ever he was, and
you cannot receive him in your hearts, nor is there any room for him in the
Inn farther then to take on and express as a covering for your pride and
earthly pleasures, let that of God in your consciences be judge, betwixt God
and you herein, how you receive the Son of his Love the despised one, search
your hearts therewith and see: Can you receive him who is set as a sign every
where to be spoken against? will you bear his marks in your body? will you
take up his Cross daily, and bear his reproach? will you own him in
whippings, stoneings, mockings, and temptations, and to be counted the filth of
the world and offscouring of all things for his name sake? Can you be willing
to be accounted fools, that his wisdom may be manifest in you? will you bear
his reproach in stocks, and prisons; and dungeons, and to be numbered amongst
transgressors? will you confess him before men to the loss of your estates, and
to the casting out of the Synagogues? will you own him in leading you through
the loss of all your unjust gain and oppression in your tradings, or will you
follow him to yea and nay in all your occasions? shall nothing separate you
from the Love of God in him who is rejected of all the World? This is our
Christ, and this is his condition in this world as ever it was, and this is his
Glory to carry his People through all these things, and above all these into
the eternal Kingdom of the Father, and them present perfect without spot or
wrinkle, or any such thing; and this is he whom the world cannot receive, nor
all you who are in the worlds pleasures can see any comelines in him, nor
beauty, that you should desire him; that eye is blind that jangles about him
afar off in the carnal comprehensions and sensual wisdom, it is the eye of
faith that sees him present (in the measure) and leads to follow him, and he
that believes has the witness in himself, wherewith his glory is seen in the
eternal the same to all generations that will receive him who is the light of
the world, yet not of this world nor his glory, from whose root springs
righteousness, mercy and judgment, who is meek and lowly, a man of sorrows,
acquainted with grief, who takes no pleasure in unrighteousness, to set up
pride, but shakes his hand at the gain of oppression, who strikes at your life
in all unrighteousness, and that is his witness in you, which calls you out of
their vain things, that with his light he might lead you out of the world there
to commune with you about your backslidings, and show your transgressious, and
the everlasting Covenant of the Fathers Love, even the eternal inheritance
which none can come to, but who receives his witness in the light, a Cross to
all the worlds lovers, and it is glory. So if you can receive him you may, if
not, this I say to you, your expectation will fail, who looks for his
appearance in the worldly glory, or after your imaginations, who judge him to
be like your selves, or such a one as you would have him, who have changed your
glory for fading things, and so imagine of him also*

Do you think the Lamb has changed his glory, because the beast is got up
into his seat? nay his glory is the same, though you have changed your God, and
have bowed down to the Prince of this world and his glory, and has committed
adultery therewith, yet God is the same and changes not. Wherefore come down
you painted harlots, you adulterers and adulteresses, whose minds would uphold
carnal delights, and yet profess the name of the Lord Jesus, you are an ill
savor to the Nations whom the Lord is about to gather, who say you are the
people of God, but live worse then the Heathen, you are the enemies of God, and
your profession stinkes in his nostrills; will he accept your words, when your
lives preach rebellion openly, and have begot a faith in one another to believe
that God will accept you herein, and a Christ you look for conformable to your
Kingdom of pride and worldly glory, selfe-worship and respect of persons,
whither you have followed the Heathen into that principle where man erres,
thither are you gone out of the faith of Christ which stands not in respect of
persons, neither can you believe who receive honor one of another, so your
hope shall perish, and your sorrow and your end shall come upon you in one day,
except you return, though now you put it afar off, yet shall you see that vain
words shall not save, where Light and life is denied.

And you whose unity stands in the visibles, and by them are gathered together,
and there you receive and know one another, and that you make the door to
receive into your Church, and without it no Communion, whose knowledge is
outward, and your worships outward, as in words, or water, bread or drink, or
any carnal perishing things, though good in their time and place, to them who
in their place could use them; yet were they not given as the substance but as
the shadows, not in the place of God, but in way of obedience to God, as many
other carnal things, which in their place and time must not be omitted; as,
Temple, Circumcision, Sacrifices, Brazen-Serpent, which were good, till set in
the place of God, and till they who had them, set them up against truth and
righteousness, and became as bad, if not worse, then they that had them not,
yet blessed themselves in their evil ways, because of them, and excluded all
else. Then the Lord departed out of them, and left them empty and desolate, and
his next appearance cried them down without, and set up the substance of them
within, so that God has been forced all along to pull down what he himself did
set up, though never so good, yet if cannal, the carnal mind would get into it,
and adulterate from the maker; as you may read in the Scriptures how many
things he has laid waste upon that account, even at his appearance in some of
his sons and daughters, even such things as he had said should be signs for
ever, yet their abuse caused the servants of God to cry them down; so your
carnal things wherein God and his power, and righteousness is not, your setting
them up instead of Christ, makes them odious to all that know Christ, and they
cannot see that which belongs to God given to any creature and be silent; but
you will say, they are commands of God, and there is no Scripture for taking
them away; I say those carnal things are but commands as Circumcision and the
Passover were, and many other, yet were they taken away with out letter, by
that Spirit that gave them, when they were abused; what letter had Hezekiah to
take away the Brazen-Serpent, and break it in pieces; what Scripture had Paul
to cry down Circumcision when he saw it abused, though he had circumcised; what
Scripture had Paul to deny that he was sent to baptize, when he saw them abuse
it, and setting it up above Christ: and many other things which by the Spirit
of God was removed, when Idollized; for which the literal observers who denied
the Spirits teaching, counted them blasphemers, as you do now; and so by such
they suffered for holding forth the substance, and denying the shadows, to such
as Idollized them, though otherwise the shadows had been lawful: nor do I judge
any that do it in obedience, and so come up above it, but all you that stick in
these outward things, contending about dipping, or sprinkling, but neglect the
power and life, you are the Jews of these days, who strive about outward
washings, some for young, and some for old; but in the mean time, all out of the
power, and in the world, in your own wills and worldly pleasures and profits,
pride and covetousness, some for free will, others not, but all in your own
wills: and thus while you are about these things received by tradition, the law
of God written in your hearts is made of none effect; nay you cannot own it,
that there is any thing there to guide or give the knowledge of God; so you
have a form of God* but the world has power over you and in you, and so are
become a reproach to Religion; wherefore come out of the world and the power of
darkness, and come to the guide of the spirit of truth, that you may be set
free to the Lord, from the rudiments, which God is departed out of, and follow
the Lamb whithersoever he goes: then shall you see him separating you from the
world in the substance of truth, in mercy and righteousness, before you be
hardened in your wickedness, and your forms be left to you desolate, and a
strange thing come upon you, which is seen concerning some of you, who will not
now own his appearance who before all form is: will it not be a strange thing
to see you who above all have cried out for liberty of Conscience, and against
persecution, who have been persecuted for Consciencesake, to see you become the
most subtle persecuters that ever were in the world, you in this generation; be
not grieved to hear of these things, for God is bringing strange things to
pass, which you will not believe though it be told you; but when it is come
upon you, remember you have been told, for the Lord is gathering his seed out
from the heathen where it has been scattered, and who will not be gathered
shall be scattered; and who will not come into the kingdom of the Lamb, must be
left amongst the beasts, and when man denies the Spirit of God to lead him, he
is no better, who has blinded that eye that foresees the evil, shall fall into
mischief ere he be aware.

ANd you Rulers, Magistrates and Governors, who have the sword of the Lord in
your hands, to rule in righteousness and judgment, there is one thing needful
for you to mind, that you know the Lord to be your Judge and Lawgiver in
particular, without which you cannot rule for God, nor as deserving the name of
Christians; the Heathens exercise Lordship in their own wills, and there is but
one thing that differs you from them; if you rule for God, and after his will,
so as to give way that he may set up his kingdom in the soul, who has set you
up to rule amongst men; And you cannot rule for God, unless you be ruled by
him, but if you have received his Law written in your hearts, and his
Judgments there, and his power and authority, and your souls subject thereto
for Conscience Sake, even to that power that is of God, to come under it, and
the principle of everlasting Judgment and righteousness, to reign in you and
rule you; and with that power and authority upon you, and with you, you go
forth to judge his people, and the heathen, then you rule with God and for God;
and with his power and authority which you have received, and to which you are
joined, are you justified before the Lord God, for whom you judge; and his Law
in every Conscience, shall answer to your judgment, that it is just and of
God; and so to that power of God and his authority shall every soul be subject,
not only for fear, but also for Conscience sake, so you become Ministers of
God to others; but if you depart out of the counsel of God and the leadings of
his Spirit, and get up into the seat of those that went before you, and take
counsel at your selves and your policy to establish your wills, as a law, and
have not respect to the law written in the heart; but contrary to it, set up
respect of persons and places instead of Judgment and righteousness. Then it
must needs be that all who have respect to the everlasting Law and power of
God, in Spirit, must suffer by you, as witnesses against you; as the Prophets,
Apostles, and Martyrs have done against your forefathers, till the Lambs
testimony be finished, and ended, against you also; yet are not we despisers of
authority, herein, no more then they were, who in subjection to that power
ordained of God, suffered by the wills of men, who should have defended them,
by that power, from the wills of men, who are not subject to that power of God;
so by men who deny that power that is ordained of God, to rule in them; by
those do such suffer as obey that power; yet are the Innocent ever accused, to
be against the power, who are but against men's wills, in obedience to the
power, and this is no new thing in this world; But our Judgment remains sure,
and to that power we appear, which no man's will can alter; to which all shall
confess, and every knee bow, when he shall Judge who now suffers; And if they
shall depart into everlasting punishment who does not minister to him in
prison; Then what will your doom be who cast him into prison, now that he is
come into the world? And if the not knowing of him will not excuse, such as do
not minister to him; Then what excuse for you who call him vagabond, stranger,
deceiver, Devil, etc. and think no place bad enough to cast the body into, in
whom he is? And if into everlasting fire with the Devil and his Angels they
must go, who do not visit him in prison; Then what way will you escape, who
will not suffer any of his brethren or servants to visit him, though they be
moved to come from far to do it? And though you may read all this in the
words of truth, from his own mouth, Math. 25. yet I know you that are in your
own wills, can no more believe these words, then the Jews and their rulers;
though you know it is he that spoke those words, and confess it to be the word
of the Lord, which the Jews did not know, so your guilt is greater. And though
our freedom is in the Lord, and we look not for it from men; nay though some of
you the more you be warned, the more you harden your selves against God; yet
while we are moved of the Lord we cannot be silent, if by any means some of
you might turn to the light, and search your ways therewith, and so be joined
to him, and established in his power, which is the desire of our souls for
you. That with the honor of God you may come to be honored, which none can
have who seek for honor from men; So you who desire to see into the ways of
God, Consider these things following.

Did ever any that ruled for God seek for their honor from men, or does God
honor such; or did ever any want honor who sought the honor of God only,
and not their own?

Is not the Spirit of meekness, justice, and mercy, without respect of persons;
the Spirit of the living God, which being in a Magistrate, he is most like God,
which makes him everlastingly honorable here and hereafter, which is true
honor and authority?

Is it not want of this Spirit that has made rulers Contemptible, and laid
them open to plots, murders, and the lusts of seditious people in all ages,
which the Spirit of God keeps out of, and makes their latter end a blessing to
following generations?

Was not persecution ever blind* or did ever the Princes of this world know the
Lord of life, by whom he has suffered in all ages, though they have been
always warned of it before they did it; or did ever the innocent suffer but
under the pretense of offenders?

Was not Christ* and those in whom he was most seen ever Pilgrims and strangers
in the earth, such as you now call vagabonds and wanderers, whip and imprison,
though they ask you nothing, nor ever are beholden to the world, wherein their
rest is not, which God foreseeing has commanded all that own him to
entertain strangers; and made a law for it, which you have a law against it?
Levit. 19. 34. Heb. 13. 2. Is it not the principal end of Magistrates, to
Judge the cause of the strangers, poor, and helpless, to relieve the oppressed,
and set the prisoners free, etc? And how you do this, let that of God in your
Consciences Judge for him, till he appear to plead the cause of him that has
no helper in the earth.

FINIS.
