By the Mayor.
To the Alderman of the Ward of
FOrasmuch as the Lords day, commonly called Sunday, is of late much broken and
profaned, by a disorderly sort of people, in frequenting Tavernes, Alehouses,
and the like, and in carrying and putting to sale Victual, and other things,
and exercising unlawful Games and pastimes, to the great dishonor of God, and
reproach of Religion. These are therefore to will and require you, in his
Majesty's name, forthwith upon sight hereof, to give strict charge and command
unto all and every the Churchwardens and Constables within your Ward, that from
henceforth they do not permit or suffer any person or persons, in the time of
divine Service, or at any time upon the Lords day, to be tippling in any
Tavern, Inn, Tobaccoshop, Alehouse, or other Victualling house whatsoever,
nor suffer any Fruiterers, or Herb-women, to stand with Fruit, Herbs, or
other Victual or Wares, in any Streets, Lanes, or Allies, within your Ward,
or any other ways, to put those or any other things to sale on that day, at
any time of the day, or in the evening thereof, or any Milkewomen to cry milk
on that day, in any the Streets, or places aforesaid, nor to permit or suffer
any person or persons to use or exercise upon that day their labor in unlading
any vessels of Fruit, or other Goods, and carrying Goods on shore, or in the
streets, or to do any unlawful exercises and pastimes, within your Ward, and
that express charge be given to every keeper of any Tavern, Inn,
Cookes-shop, Tobacco house, Alehouse, or any other Tipler or Victualler
whatsoever within your Ward, that hereafter they receive not or suffer to
remain any person or persons whatsoever as their guests or Customers, to
Tipple, Eat, Drink, or take Tobacco in their Houses upon the Lords day, other
then that Inholders may receive their Ordinary Guests, or Travelers and such
like, who come to remain for a time in their Inn, for dispatch of their
necessary business. And if any person or persons, shall be found offending in
the premises, that then they be brought before me the Lord Mayor, or some
other of his Majesty's Justices of the peace, to the end they may receive such
punishment as to Justice shall appertain. And hereof not to fail, as you will
answer the contrary at your peril.

This second of November, 1643. Michel.
