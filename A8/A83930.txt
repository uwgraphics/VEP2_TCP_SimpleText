Die Iovis 5o. Maii. 1642.
LORDS HOUSE.
WHereas the Lords in the upper House of Parliament, do find that there are
many Petitions concerning private persons depending now before their Lordships,
and conceive that many more may be brought into that House, if timely
advertisement be not given to the contrary, which may occasion the Repair and
Attendance of diverse of his Majesty's loving Subjects upon their Lordships, who
cannot give a dispatch to private businesses, by reason of the many public and
great Affairs that now lie before them, concerning the safety and weal of his
Majesty's Kingdoms:

It is therefore thought fit, and so Ordered by the Lords in Parliament, That
all private Petitions shall be hereby deferred and put off, until the firstday
of Michaelmas Term being the 24th. of October next, and then their Lordships
will proceed according to the order as they came in: Whereof this House does
hereby give notice to all his Majesty's loving people, to prevent the charge
and trouble, which otherwise the Petitioners might be put unto in repairing
unto this house at this time.

Io. Brown Cler. Parliamentorum.
