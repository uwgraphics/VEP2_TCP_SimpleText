LONDON, Printed for George Whittington, 1647.

A Declaration from his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax, and the Council of War.
When this Army was formerly led by the manifold dispensations of Gods
providence, and the grounds then declared, to advance toward the City of
London, we held it our duty, to yield the Kingdom, the sum of those desires
which we had to propose on behalf of it, our selves, wherein we should
acquiesce: And having received from the Parliament, some hopes of due
satisfaction therein, and some assurance from the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and
Common Council of the City of London, of their ready concurrence with us in
those things, and also great resolution professed by them of their care and
tenderness to preserve all the Rights and Privileges of Parliament, safe,
free, and inviolated, from attempts of all kinds, we do appeals to God, to the
City, and to al men, what a speedy compliance to their desires for our removal
to a further distance, found in this Army, for preventing all fears,
jealousies, and other inconveniences to the City, and to give clear testimony,
that we had nothing in our breasts, but thoughts of peace, and the good and
welfare both of Parliament, City, and Kingdom, notwithstanding many false and
scandalous reports raised, that we sought our selves, that we had vile and
wicked ends, and that nothing would satisfy the soldier but the plunder of
the City, the contrary whereof did manifestly appear, when they so readily
marched back upon hopes of satisfaction in their Desires of public concernment.

Having then upon the aforesaid confidence so withdrawn, and out of a just
sense of the Countries suffering (by quarteting) removed the Head-quarter of
the Army above 40. miles from London, and dispersed the rest well nigh 200.
miles for the more ease of all parts, and that we might give the better
satisfaction to the Kingdom. And being in this secure way, and laboring after
the sudden settlement of the Kingdom, we had even brought to perfection the
particular proposals (included in the generals of our first Representation) to
be sent to the Parliament, for a final conclusion of all our troubles. And
also had made good progress toward the present relief of distressed Ireland,
by assigning a competent force, both of horse and foot forthwith to have
advanced for that service.

But the Kingdoms and our Enemies being most vigilant and active to prevent and
frustrate those good intentions, and endeavors of ours; (that they might carry
on their former evil designs) and underhand practices, and also preserve
themselves from the hand of justice, they have endeavored to cast the Kingdom
into a new and bloody war: And for that end have procured the
under-hand-listing of several Reformadoes, and others, have contrived, promoted
and caused to be entered into by several persons a wicked and treasonable
combination, as is is sufficiently manifested by a Declaration passed thereupon
by both Houses of PARLIAMENT, the 23. of July last for the prevention of the
disturbances that were like to ensue thereupon; from which kind of disorders
the City had been well preserved, during the space of almost 4 years, whilst
the Militia was in the hands of the old Commissioners, whereby it appears
there was cause for the Army to entreat the Parliament, that the Militia might
be returned into the hands it was in before, as also for diverse other good
Reasons.

1. The old Commissioners of the Militia (that have bin since left out) were
not only persons without all exception, having bin formerly chosen and approved
by the Parliament and City, but also men of whom the City, Parliament, and
Kingdom have had above 4 years experience in the faithful discharge of their
trust, more than ever from the beginning, in the worst of times, and in the
occasions of greatest d^fficultie, had faithfully and constan^ly engaged for,
and with the Parliament in this cause; Men that were always most desirous of a
Peace, but of a safe and well grounded one and that had always testified a
great care to prevent all occasions of embroyling the Kingdom in a new War.

Now that on a sudden this trust which they had so faithfully discharged so
long, should be taken out of their hands, and put in^o the hands of others,
some whereof (at the best) have been very cool in the service of the
Parliament at the beginning of this War; That this should be pressed and in a
manner forced upon the Parliament with such importunity from the
Conmmon-Councell that some out of every Ward should be assigned to solicit
the Members of the House of Cemmons, every day as they went in and out at the
House: with professions that they would never leave the door of the House till
they were satisfied in their Desires. That they would not be contented with the
Militia of the City of London only, unless they might have power also over
that of the Suburbs and out-parts: and all this before the peace of the
Kingdom was settled or the Propositions sent to the King for that purpose.

These things ministered great cause of suspicion, that this alteration of the
Militia was in order to a design, and to make the terms of the Peace, and
agreement with the King, (on which the security of the whole Kingdom and their
posterity is to be bottomed) more suitable to the private bargainings and
undertakings of some men, then to the public welfare of the whole Kingdom,
in its security and prosperity, for the present and in future times. But this
design discovered it self more clearly by such things as accompanied the
pursuit of this alteration of the Militia, and ensued upon the obtaining
thereof: At the same time that the alteration of the Militia of London was set
on foot, the same persons with as much earnestness pressed for the disbanding
of this Army, before any thing was settled for the security and liberty of the
Kingdom. At the same time the Common Counsel was new modulized, and a Lord
Mayor chosen that might suite with the present design in hand: At the time
(under color of differences in some circumstances of Church Government) it was
earnestly endeavored, that such as had been constantly true and most faithful
to the interest of the Kingdom should be disabled, to have any employment in
Church or Common wealth, either in England or Ireland, and without any such
color or pretense, diverse persons were left out of the Common Council, and
Militia of eminent deserts and fidelity: and others brought into their rooms
that had either testified an ill affection, or little affection to the
Parliament and their cause: and such as seeking to withdraw themselves from all
employment in the beginning of this War, now at the winding up thereof, are
ambitious to thrust themseve into employment, with a design (as may justly be
suspected) to frustrate and overthrow in the close of all, the fruit and effect
of all the cost and blood that has bin spent and spilt in this cause: and
after that with difficulty, and not without reluctance, in the Houses of
Parliament they had obtained the power of the Militia, in the City of London,
and also in the out-parts for the space of one year. Many Officers and under
Officers in the Trained bands of known trust and fidelity were displaced, and
others of more doubtful affections placed in their rooms, little care was
taken of the honor of the Parliament, which was continually trampled under
foot, and their authority affronted by every rabble of Women, Apprentices,
Reformadoes and Soldiers, which latter sort of persons were thereby so
encouraged to rise higher and higher, in their tumultuous carriages against the
Houses, till at length it is risen to the higth of barbarous and monstrous
violence against the Parliament, that they might set themselves on work, and
the Kingdom on fire again. And now at length, the design appears open faced,
and though the Militia be made as the principal ground of the quarrel, yet by
the late vows and engagements set one foot before any alteration of the
Militia, and the pressing so much the Message of the 12 of May. and the Kings
coming to London to confirm the same, show, that the Militia is desired but
in order to that design, and to force the Parliament (being wholly in their
power) to such Terms of peace as they pleased

2. In the next place when the interest of the Common Counsel, in their change
of the Militia shall be claymed as the Birthright of the City of London,
(which they never had any color to pretend to, saving by the indulgency of the
Parliament unto them since this Parliament, in respect of the great use they
have had of them, and the many good services they have received from them) It
is time for all the Kingdom to look to their Birthrights, if such a claim
shall be held up against both the Houses of Parliament, That upon no occasion
whatsoever, nor in no time of danger and distraction whatsoever, they may
appoint those that shall have the power of the Militia of London without the
consent of the Common Counsel; especially when as the Houses shall sit under
their power.

The late Example may evidence to all the World, who shall be Masters of the
Parliaments freedom and Resolutions: And common reason will teach every man
who shall be Masters of the Birthrights of the whole kingdom when there shall
be no Army on foot, when they have the confidence to dispute for the Mastery,
notwithstanding such an Army as this to check and balance them in behalf of
the Kingdom and Parliament.

3. Lastly, the Army discerning how intimate some of the new Militia were with
some of the 11 accused Members, how forward they were to comply and act with
them in their endeavors, to raise a new War; how they made 18. or 19. Votes
in order thereunto together with them in one night.

All which, the Common Council and Parliament disliked and revoked, how
notwithstanding afterward they secretly promoted their Designs by private
Listings, which now appear to have bin still working under ground.

The Army, we say, observing this, and having nothing more in their thoughts
and desires, then to settle a speedy, safe, and wel-grounded peace, and to
prevent a new war, found it necessary to desire,

That the Militia might be put into the hands wherein it was formerly, who had
approved themselves both to the Army, Parliament and Kingdom, to be
sober-minded men, and not given to any practice whereby a new War might be
kindled.

To the intent, that the Army being secured by that means from that danger,
might with the more confidence retire further from the City, enlarge their
Quarter for the greater ease of the Kingdom, and intend wholly the settling of a
sure peace in this Kingdom, and a speedy and effectual relief of Ireland,
which was almost brought to a period, and nothing in the sight of man could
have hindered, but this cursed practice of violence upon the Parliament, under
pretense of the Militia, which according to our desire, being restored again
into the hands of the old Commissioners, by an Ordinance of both Houses, dated
the 21. of July, (in pursuance of the aforesaid treasonable combination)
several Petitions were presented to the Common Council of the City of LONDON,
in the name of the Apprentices and others, importing their Desires, that the
Militia of the City might continue in the hands of the former Commissioners,
according to the Ordinance of the 4 of May last.

Whereupon Monday July the six and twentieth, the Common Counsel of the City
presents their Petitions to both Houses for changing the Militia, wherein the
House of Lords refuse to alter their Resolutions, the House of Commons answered
they would take it into consideration the next morning. Notwithstanding which,
the City and kingdom cannot be ignorant with what rage and insolency the tumult
of Apprentices the same day forced both Houses. They blockt up their doors,
swearing they would keep them in till they had passed what votes they pleased;
they threatened the Houses if they granted not their desires, knocking, hooting,
and hallowing so at the Parl. doors, that many times the Members could not be
heard to speak or debate, not suffering the house of Commons to divide for
determining such Questions, as were put, crying out that those that gave their
votes against them, should be sent out to them, very often and loudly, saying,
Agree, agree, dispatch well wait no longer, and in this outrageous manner, they
continued at the house door above 8 hours together, the city guards there
present the City releiving them, by reason whereof the House was forced to Vote
what that rude multitude would demand, and then adjourned the House til the
next morning; After which the House rising, the Speaker and many Members going
out of the House, they forced them back again into the House: Many of the
Apprentises pressing in with them, where they stood with their hats on their
heads, and compelled the Speaker to take the Chair, and the House to Vote in
their presence what they pleased, committing many other insolences, as is
published by the Speaker of the House of Commons in his Declaration, and is too
well known by all then present; And during the time of this execrable violence
done by the said Apprentises, Westminster Hal and the Palace yard was filled
with Reformadoes and other ill-affected persons designed to back them.

After this the Houses being Adjourned till Friday following, upon the Thursday
the Apprentises printed and posted a paper of several places of the City,
requiring all their fellows to be early at the Parliament the next morning,
for that they intended to adjourne by seven of the clock, and that for a
month. Thus the Speakers with many of the Members of both Houses were driven
away from the Parliament.

This in brief being the true state of things as they have broke forth within
these few days, (which are so contrary to all those pretenses of Peace, and
detestation of a new War of late so frequently held forth on all sides,) all
men may observe to what maturity the long projected Design of some men, (of
whom are those that are impeached by as,) is now brought, and may be traced in
the several steps thereof, as it has tended to the enslaving this Kingdom,
and the destruction of all such well-affected people who would not comply with
them therein; so as by what now is come to light, the justness of that cause,
this Army had engaged themselves in, and the great and wonderful mercy of God
in continuing them together, we assure our selves does now clearly appear to
all men's eyes and apprehensions, and will every day more and more be
acknowledged, even by those that have heretofore made a question of it.

And if when this Kingdom has spent so much of its blood and treasure, has
past through such unheard of dangers, and overcome such difficulties so many
years together, All that they must now hope for and rest in, must only be what
the King grants in his Message of the 12 of May last: And if this must be
imposed upon men's judgments and consciences by an oath, and now entered into in
a tumultuous and unlawful way, and by outrage maintained in despite and
contempt of the Parliament. If rather then this should not be accomplished, the
Parliament it self must be violated and forced into the hands of such of the
Members thereof as have secretly abetted and fomented those practices to that
end; That these hidden counsels and works of darkness might, when they come
to their full birth, have the image of highest authority in the face of them
the better to gain credit thereunto, and secure the authors of them from
punishment; For the evidence of all which we refer our selves to the
particulars in our Charge against the 11 Members, compared with those passages
of late broke forth before rehearst, unto which we shall now only add (and
leave it to the consideration of all wise and good men) with what Artifice and
boldness these Members have served themselves of those horrid tumults and
violences of their own creating (instead of showing their detestation of them)
again to intrude themselves into the public managing of affairs, and
inevitably to embroyle the Kingdom in a new war; which their own revenge and
the compassing of their former plots and designs makes them so greedily thirst
after. If these things (we say) must be the end and up-shot of all, what then
remains to this poor Kingdom and all true hearted Englishmen, but to join
together as one man with their counsels, estates and lives in this way, as our
last refuge under God, which he by his wise and gracious providence has
provided and reserved by keeping up this Army even to a Miracle, so to prevent
the aforesaid evils, and to procure to this dying Kingdom yet a settled peace
and happiness, if it be his blessed will?

These things being seriously considered by us, we have thought fit in the
name of the Army to declare, that all such Members of either House of
Parliament as are already with the Army for the security of their persons, and
for the ends aforesaid are forced to absent themselves from Westminster, that
we shall hold and esteem them as persons in whom the public trust of the
Kingdom is still remaining, though they cannot for the present fit as a
Parliament with freedom and safety at Westminster; and by whose advice and
counsels, we desire to govern our selves in the managing these weighty
affairs; and to that end we invite them to make repair to this Army to join
with us in this great cause, we being resolved, and do hereby faithfully
oblige our selves to stand by them therein, and to live and die with them
against all Opposition whatsoever, and in particular we do hold our selves
bound to own that honorable act of the Speaker of the House of Commons, who
upon the grounds he himself expressed in his Declaration sent unto us, has
actually withdrawn himself; and hereupon we do further engage to use our
utmost and speedy endeavors, that he and those Members of either House, that
are thus enforced away from their attendance at Westminster may with freedom
and security fit there, and again discharge their trust as a free and a
legal Parliament, and in the mean time we do declare against that late choice
of a new Speaker by some Gentlemen at Westminster, as contrary to all Right
Reason, Law and Custom, and we profess our selves to be most clearly
satisfied all our judgments, and are also confident the Kingdom will herein
concur with us, that as things now stand there is no free nor legal
Parliament sitting, being through the aforesaid violence at present suspended.
And that the Orders, Votes, or Resolutions, forced from the Houses on Monday
the 26. of July last, as also all such as shall pass in this Assembly of some
few Lords and Gentlemen at Westminster, under what pretense and color soever
are void and null, and ought not to be submitted unto by the freeborne Subjects
of England.

And that we may prevent that slavery designed upon us and the Nation, that the
Kingdom may be restored to a happy State of a visible Government now eclipsed
and darkened; we hold our selves bound by our duty to God and the Kingdom; to
bring to condign punishment the Authors and Promoters, of that unparalleld
violence done to the Parliament; and in that to all the freerborne Subjects of
England, that are or hereafter shall be; and therefore we are resolved to march
up toward London, where we do expect that the well-affected people of that
City will deliver up unto us, (or otherwise put into safe Custody, so as they
may be reserved to a legal Trial,) the eleven impeached Members that have
again thrust themselves into the management of public affairs by this wicked
design.

And that all others will give us such Assistance therein, that the Members of
both Houses may receive due encouragement to return to Westminster, there to
fit with all freedom, and so to perform their trust, as shall conduce to the
settlement of this distracted Kingdom; and to inflict such punishments upon
these late Offenders as shall deters any for the future to make the like
attempt.

Our lives have not been dear unto us for the public good, and being now
resolved by the assistance of God, to bring these delinquents to their deserved
punishments, as that then which, there cannot be any thing of more public
concernement to the Kingdom, we trust (if it shall come to that,) our blood
shall not be accounted too dear a price for the accomplishment of it. And if
any in the City will engage themselves against us to protect these Persons, and
so put the Kingdom again into a new and miserable War, The blood must be
laid to the account of such person, as the Authors thereof.

And lastly, Because it is the maine Engine of ours and the Kingdoms enemies,
to render us odious by possessing the minds of men, that we gape only after
the plunder of this great and wealthy City, as the experience of the contrary
carriage in all Towns that we have taken yields unto us a Testimony beyond
the example of any Army, so we do from our hearts declare, that we abhor
the thoughts thereof, and we doubt not but the world shall see our actions
answerable to our professions, and that we shall not cause any man to suffer
but by his own default; and that God will manifest we have only in our eyes,
that Justice may have a free course, the Parliament a free sitting and voting,
and a full vindication of the late violence done to them.

And as for the City of Westminster, the Borough of Southwarke, the Hamlets,
and the rest of the suburbs and out parts, as we are informed, that they are
not so ready to engage themselves in a new war as some would have them, so
we are sensible of the hard condition that they are brought into, even by them
that claim a Right against both Hou^^s of Parliament, (a strange claim against
a Parliament, though more reasonable against others,) not to be subjected to a
Militia without their own consent, and yet will not be contented, unless they
may have others subjected unto them, and lay what burdens they please upon
them, without allowing them any part of vote or consent with them; In which
points of common might, and Equity we shall not be wanting (in a due way) to
assist them for the obtaining of their just desires and immunities, is being
our chief aim to settle Peace with Truth and Righteousness throughout the
Kingdom, that none may be oppressed in his just freedom and Liberties, much
less the Parliament it self, which things being duly settled, we shall be as
ready also to assure unto the King his just Rights and authority as any that
pretend it never so much, for the better upholding of an ill cause, and the
countenance of tumultuous violence against the Parliament, the which our
honest, just, and necessary undertakings, as we are resolved to pursue with
the utmost hazard of our lives and fortunes, so we doubt not but we shall find
Gods accustomed goodness and assistance with us therein, till we have brought
them to a good and happy conclusion for this poor distracted and languishing
Kingdom.

FINIS.
