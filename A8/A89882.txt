The Lawyer of LINCOLNES-INNE Reformed.
SInce this Learned Gentleman's usual way of Queries, argue rather a disease of
ill concoction in the Brain, than any reasonable Conclusion of what He
undertakes, and is but a piece of Leiger-du-maine to amuse men's Understandings,
by feeding the Fantasy with such Fears and Jealousies, as the weaker sort of
men (fruitful enough in these times) create unto Themselves out of what they
read, rather than any Satisfaction to the more solid part of the world: Give
leave then to wonder, how He or any man dare own so much Impudence and
Virulence in such a Time as this, against so potent, so religious, so resolute,
so well-accomplish't, well-disciplin'd, and victorious an Army; the Justice of
whose proceedings, as it triumphs beyond Apology (being backed with all the
Reason of an Honorable policy, and undeniable expedients for the good of the
Kingdom;) so it must indeare them to the present, and shall innoble them to
all future generations.

Therefore touching the first of these Cob-web-contrivanes by way of Querie,
wherein those unspotted Letters and Declarations from the Army (no less
admirable for Style than Equity) are most maliciously traduced as of dangerous
Consequence; and the incomparable General, Officers, and Soldiers, taxed of
Arbitrarinesse, and breach of the Houses privileges, because those Declarations
and Charge against the Members went to the Press without Leave from the House;
I suppose the general approbation of men, and the sudden desertion of those
Members (Argument enough of guilt) will clearly evince, that their Complaints
were not causeless, but of only concernment and Consequence to the Interest,
Peace, and Happiness ^f the English Nation, against all foraigne Encroachments
of those, whose practice is, under pretense of Reformation, by themselves and
some Apostate (with many deluded) Englishmen their Agents, to make what Mercats
they please of the Public, to serve private ends. And further, it is time to
consider what manner of men these are, and what Tyranny they would not execute
(were their power answerable to those bitter passions, which they give us a
Taste of upon every least occasion) seeing they interpret so necessary and
harmless an Act in the Army, as a bare permission of their Papers to the
Press, into a sense of Arbitrarinesse and breach of Privilege; whereas they
have done nothing this way, but what is most equitable in order to their own
vindication, and satisfaction of the whole Kingdom, whose ignorance of the
grounds of their so meritorious Engagement, might have made them capable to
entertain any monstrous impressions and representations whatsoever, against
the Proceedings of the Army. And truly, it is high time also, that some Course
were taken for stating the Privileges of Parliament into certain Limits, that
men may no longer wander in this particular, as in a wilderness or Maze, nor
run upon every Turn of humor and discontent, to secure themselves and their
Designs, in the various, endless, and invisible Labyrinth of Parliamentary
privilege.

Touching the second Querie, wherein the Proceedings of the Army are said to be
the same with Jack Cade and his rebellious popular Army, and so an Argument is
founded upon this Supposition, on that Statute of 31. Hen. 6. cap. 1.
concerning the Rebellion of Cade, to nullify the Charge against the Members
now Impeached, viz. that ALL INDITEMENTS (or Charges) IN TIME COMING IN LIKE
CASE, UNDER POWER OF TYRANNY, REBELLION, or STIRRING HAD, SHALL BE OF NO RECORD
NOR EFFECT, BUT VOID IN LAW; and so not to be received now by the Parliament
till the Army be disbanded. An Argument as rare, as the mad Impudence of those
many vile and inhumane Aspersions wherewith he has bespattered his Paper, is
horrid and unpardonable! But first, to wipe away that of Tyranny, it cannot be
unknown to all men, that as this Army behave themselves with so much Temper,
that few where they come have Cause to complain of wrong or damage, so the
Principal motive of their thus Engaging is, to Crush that Serpent in the Shel,
which (if hatched to maturitie) would have given an irrecoverable wound to
Monarchy and Liberty; and as the Kingly power must have been rendered as
contemptible here, as the same design has made it beyond Tweed; so the
freedom of the subject must have dwindled into the same misery, leanness, and
poverty, or worse than many of our poor Countrymen do suffer, as slaves
under the power of Asia.

And as for Rebellion, the second gudgeon which this bookish madman has
fish't out of the statute, for his friends to swallow in opinion against the
Army; It is a most senseless thing to call that a Rebellion against
Parliament, when men do Act merely for those Ends, whereto they were first
Commissionated by Parliament, against a visible Plot of particular men on foot,
to amuse, abuse, and surprise the Parliament underhand so far, as to make
them upon mis-informations, contribute toward the prejudice of the whole
Kingdom and themselves, in dis-countenancing and dis-contenting this Army; to
whom (next under God) the Nation must owe the re-investiture of freedom,
against the secret underminings of all such darke-lanthorne Patriots. For,
though their Adversaries make an Advantage by scandalizing them as enemies to
the Privileges of Parliament, (which is the maine design of our Sottish Lawyer
throughout his Queries) yet it cannot be so taken, since the Charge reflects
only upon a prevailing party of private Interests, many of which have unduely
crept into the House to serve by-ends, and overawe the more Noble Party; and
so being in this desperate condition, think to shelter themselves under the
notion of Parliamentary privilege, that they may with the more liberty and
security, contrive the ruin of those greater ends, for whose protection and
preservation they were first admitted or intended ( viz. the Rights and
Privileges of the People;) so that the Army in accusing the Heads of these men,
cannot be said to infringe the Privileges of Parliament, but rather to preserve
them, lest through the infection of corrupt Members, they be tainted with
Infamy, by being extended to countenance private wrongs or public mischief.
Nor is this only a surmise to gain a good opinion of the Army; for that needs
not, seeing their Intentions are so apprehended by most people of the Kingdom,
not only in point of the Houses privileges, but also in relation to the common
freedom of the subject, with a Restoration of the King in Parliament with
such Honor and freedom, as may gain a lasting Repute to those Acts that
shall be provided for by the Royal Assent, in that behalf: which (to the joy
and happiness of all true Englishmen, that have not lost themselves in a
Scottish-Mist) will prove the blessed consequence of that unparalled piece of
Virtue in the Army, which is so perniciously blasted with a Story of Jack Cade,
and a phrentick slander of Rebellion and Tyranny.

To the third Querie, wherein the Charge is excepted against, as too general
and ambiguous, against eleven eminent Members, most of which have done gallant
service in the field, without descending to particulars of persons, fact, time,
place, etc. and so a most illegal, injurious, arbitrary accusation and
proceeding, contrary to all Rules of Justice and Equity: I shall extract
several Passages out of the Armies own Papers, in justification of their
Charge against all prejudice and calumny; as first, the Conclusion of the
Charge it self (if the eager Gentleman had not overlook't it) might have
satisfied him that they intended not to dwell upon Generals, though it were
first offered in such terms, but descend to make good in particulars, each
Head against some of the Persons, and some one head or more against each of the
Persons; and shortly to give in the several particulars against each Person
respectively, and make them good by proofs, when the House of Commons should
admit thereof; the Army desiring to have and reserve to themselves, the liberty
of exhibiting any farther Charge against all or any of the said Persons.

Hear also the words of the last Declaration from the Army, which say; Whereas
many of the things whereto the Charge relates, are things spoken, moved, or
done in the House, so as we have yet no clear way opened, particularly to
Charge or mention Them, or to produce proofs to Them, without some pretense
against us of breach of Privilege; and therefore (though we think no
privilege ought to protect evil men in doing wrong to particulars, or
mischief to the public, yet) we have been hitherto so tender of Parliament
Privileges, as that we have only Remonstrated the evil of such things done;
and supposing the House to have been (as we did and do believe, and if way were
open without breach of Privilege, should not doubt to prove it was) some ways
misinformed, deluded, surprised, or otherwise abused in those things by evil
Members, we have frequently in former Papers (before the Charge) put the
Parliament upon it (who without color of breach of Privilege might do it) to
find out and discover who they were that had so abused Them, and to dis-ingage
the Honor of Parliament from such evil practices and designs of such
Incendiaries.

So that after so manifest Remonstrating to accuse and convince them by
particulars, what does our Lawyer, but play the Jack, by crying out injustice,
injury, iniquity, and illegality of proceeding, upon surmised grounds of the
Armies mannaging the Charge in general, ambiguous, and uncertain terms,
which they have thus publicly disclaimed?

As to the other part of this Querie, wherein it is said the King himself has
given the lie to some of the Armies Declarations, touching his willingness to
remove from Holdenby, and Cornet Joyce his seizing his Person was a treasonable
Action. I shall not stand to justify the Cornets Act as tolerable by the
rigor of the Law (by which only this confused Lay-Gospeller condemns it;) but
if we look upon the impulsive Cause prevailing upon the Soldiery to attempt
it, which was (as says the last Declaration) the apprehension of private
designs upon the King ere he came from Holdenby, to put his Majesty within
the reach of those men's power, who sought for the advantage of his Person,
thereby to imbroyle this Kingdom in a new and bloody War, and strengthen
themselves in their mischievous designs, the better to uphold their Faction,
and intended domination; then we shall find that this seizing (or rather
rescue) of the Kings Person, was the very key of the work, to lock up that
Cabinet of secret Treasons then and since discovered, which (like Pandora's
Box) might else have replenished the world with mischiefs greater than before,
and to unlocke that door of future peace, which they and their confidents had
barred up against the Kingdoms happiness: So that if Cornet Joyce has
outwitted them, though in somewhat an irregular way against the Letter of the
Law, yet I trust this Nation will bear him out against all rigorous Lawyers,
because of the happy consequence and effect it will produce both to Prince and
People, by setting a period to one tumultuous War, and hindering the Progress
of a second, which must necessarily have involved us in inevitable ruin. Nor
do they yet give over the design, but use all means to work his Majesty
(whose wisdom I doubt not is proof against all flatteries tending to his
ruin) to engage and declare for them, or at least to declare Himself a
prisoner, thereby to stir up His Party against the Army, who are the sure
Guardians of his Crown and Person.

To the fourth Querie, which is stuffed with a Rabble of slander; as that it
was but a pretense of the Army about false informations, mis-representations,
and scandalous suggestions, made against them to the House: For this I hope the
House will punish him in calling their wisdom so far in question, as to make
the world believe so grave a Senate should upon a mere pretense of the Army
retract one of their Declarations; and also right the Army from this scandal
of pretense, by some real example, to testify a detestation of his abuse both
to Themselves and the Army.

As also that the Army profess ungratefully and unchristianly touching the
business of Ireland in the second, third, and fourth Articles of Charge. And
what is it they profess there, but that charity begins at home? and seeing the
Irish design to be but a Plot to break in pieces the Army, to make way for
the advancement of their Faction here to the oppression and dedecoration of the
Prince, Parliament, and People; and to leave them in such a lame abject
condition, that the Clergy-lay Conventiclers of the Faction might in the mean
while inslave them beyond recovery, they could not without offering violence to
their principles, as Englishmen; to their Consciences, as Reliligious men; and
to common piety, as lovers of their Country; but stay and see the Flock
secured from being made a prey to those Woolves here, who might in a short time
have proved as bad as those that had devoured the prey already in Ireland;
whose last ruins must be put upon their score, as those who by underhand
practices have hindered those many supplies, which might have been speeded away
long ago, to the assistance and redemption of that poor Kingdom.

To the fifth Querie, Whether the Army might not as well, by such general and
uncertain chargs, impeach the whole House its self as well as those eleven
Members? This is more monstrous than all the rest, and calls aloud upon the
House to vindicate their Honor from so foul a supposition of guilt, which he
endeavors to throw upon them all, equally with the Members impeached and their
party, and endeavors to insinuate into men's minds, as if it were the case of
the whole House, which as it is contrary to that reverence which the Army
owes, and will express to the Worthies of the House, so it requires the
wisdom of those Worthies to correct the crafty sauciness of our Lawyer in
vindication of their own credit, and terrify other malepert Boutefeux of the
faction from the like audacitie.

As for his parallelling the Kings demand of the five Members heretofore and
the Armies of eleven now, were it not time to leave off the mention of ought
that may reflect upon him now, in a time when his honor and the Kingdoms
peace are a repairing both together, I could manifest a great dis-proportion
(in regard of circumstances) betwixt that act of the Kings, and this of the
Army, and prove the invalidity of the instance. And whereas he prints that
ordinary scandal in the mouths of all that are of the faction, that the
remove of the impeached Members is endeavored, only that the Independent
party might sway and vote what they please; what is it but to yield that those
men were the heads of the faction, and held an influence on a great part of the
House to serve their own design? who the ( Grandees being withdrawn) may
chance now to prove honest; which our furious Lawyer needed not to have
exclaimed against so fearfully, if he had thought they had been engaged upon
such principles before, as would have rendered them lasting friends to the
faction: But now, they being gone, it is like every Bowie may run with its own
Byas, I mean conscience, and every tub stand upon its own bottom. Then sure
that will appear but an ill cause, whose Fautors grow jealous of thriving by
fair play above board.

To the sixth Querie, Wherein he taxes the Army as quarrelling at the Houses
Votes, on purpose to keep from a disbanding, to overawe Parliament, City and
Kingdom, and endeavoring to throw all old and new elected Members out of the
House, that are not of their Party, with some exceptions also at the latter
Elections in Cornwall, Wales, etc. for the prevention of which, and the
conquering those other Gugawes rambled up in this sixth Querie, our Lawyer
desires to awaken all honest men in time. And surely, had not men need of an
awakening, the Presbyters faction had never been adorned with so many
Proselites in England; but now it is high time to open their eyes, that they
may see who the men are, that have hoisted up such Votes by indirect means, on
purpose to pick a quarrel with the Army, by putting them upon such
extraordinary ways for the safety of themselves and the Kingdom, as in a time
of less necessity and danger, they could not have adventured without a blemish
of their Reputation: And it is so much the more trouble to them, to be reduced
to this pass through the subtilty of their Adversaries, that they cannot
assert the honor, freedom, and Privileges of Parliament, but that they take
occasion to wrest all their proceedings in Sequiorem, and represent them as
Anti-Parliamentary, to the in-observing and more easy understandings.

As concerning the Elections in Cornwall, etc. I had rather take the sense of
the Army, many of whom have been present there, than the opinion of our Lawyer,
who pronounces them all fair, with as much confidence as if Mahomets Pidgeon
gave him Intelligence from all corners of the world.

In the seventh Querie he huddles over many Particulars of the same nature with
those in some of the former; and both the seventh and eighth contain nothing
but matter of railing, scaudall, and misrepresentation, pretending that the
Army acts against the Parliament and their Privileges, which I have
sufficiently refuted upon the former Queries; and ironically flouting them with
the name of Saints, Saviors, Protectors, and the godly Party, telling them,
they comply with the Malignants once in arms, complaining of the Breach of
Articles, and craving reparation for their wrongs, etc. But he never considers,
that equity is due to our worst enemies; and being loath to give the Army the
honor of their humane and equitable intentions, never tells upon what gronnd
they are thus compassionate to their quondam-Adversaries; which certainly
expresses as much honor and justice, together with hope of tranquillity to the
Kingdom, as can possibly be imagined, by a due consideration of the right,
quiet, and immunity of His Majesty, his royal Family, and late Partakers;
supposing a spirit of common love and justice, diffusing it self to the good
and preservation of All, will be the only way to make up the most glorious
Conquest over their hearts (if God in mercy see it good) to make them and the
whole People of the Land lasting Friends.

But the main Scandal in the eight Querie is a story wherein he parallels the
proceedings of the Army with the Anabaptists at Munster, with the same
ungracious impudence, as he does by the Rebellion of Jack Cade in the second
Querie, and so gives the City an Alarm to stand upon their Guard. It Is well
you will be content with that posture now, but certain it is, the Design, when it
was first conceived in darkness, and the privy Iunto of Confederates had
travailed with it a whole night, was brought forth in the morning, a fair
Cockney with the face of a new war; which was nourst up very carefully for a
few days, till the Citizens saw it would prove a very chargeable brat, and so
it was immediately smothered. I appland their wisdom, that they were able to
see themselves made but a stalking-horse to serve other men's private ends; and
I cannot but commend their resolution to free themselves from all such like
pursemilking Complots for the future, which tend only to draw on the guilt of
innocent blood, and draine the public treasure of the Kingdom and City, to
support the ambitious interests of particular men. And as for the Army, I doubt
not but all men of this famons City uninterested (or not wrought upon and
amused by persons Interested) are really satisfied with their candid and
sincere Intentions toward this City, so often promised declared and
remonstrated: And if through the seditious provocations of such furies as our
Lawyer, they entertain a causeless jealousy, and be urged thereby to act in
prejudice of the Army, that passionate love which I bear to the renown and
glory of this delight of the Nation, makes me tremble to think into what fatal
Consequences such cursed Counselors would allure and ensnare them: And
therefore they had best be well advised, that they behave themselves with such
moderation, as to do nothing but in order to their own defense, from the
injuries of discontented enemies within, and without the least shadow of
provocation to their friends without, it resting upon their wise carriage,
either to bury the seeds of war, sedition and tumult, in an honorable
Peace, or the happiness and glory of Great Britain, in a new Rupture.

To the ninth and last Querie, wherein he taxes the Armies demand of a speedy
Answer to their Remonstrance, to be the highest, arrogantest, and
unreasonablest that ever was proposed, etc. I shall say no more but this, that
necessity admits of no delay in Affairs of this nature, seeing it were as much
as to put themselves to the hazard of an After-game, when their enemies are
visibly active upon the Counter-plot.

And I shall conclude only with one Anti-querie, in opposition to his nine
Queries, viz: Whether if the Author of those impudent, false, and seditious
Queries, have no ears to lose, he deserve not to be cramp't in that right
Thumb, which has heretofore condemned so much Law and Divinity to confusion;
and now at last, most impiously scandalized our best friends, as enemies of the
Kingdom.

FINIS.
