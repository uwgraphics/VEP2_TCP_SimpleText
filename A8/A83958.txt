ENGLANDS DOLEFVL COMPLAINT, AND MOST EARNEST SVIT, UNTO HER HONORABLE AND
VICTORIOUS GENERAL, And to the whole Body of the SOLDIERY under his Command.
As it was presented in a Letter, to his Excellency, the Lord General CROMWELL.
O Thou brave CROMWELL!
Ring the Lawyers Knell:
Then that brave Story
Will prove thy Glory:
For, Lawyers Bribery
Is Englands Misery:
And their great Power
Does us devour.
Yea, the Lawyers Reign
Is poor Englands pain:
But the Lawyers Fall
Will bring Joy to all:
Far surpassing all
The Proud Prelates Fall
Then thou worthy all
Speed the Lawyers Fall.
Good God be thy guide
At all Times and Tide:
Granting thee Power
These to devour,
To his great Glory,
Thy Fame and Story:
To poor Englands Peace,
And her Sons Release,
From the cruel Bands
Of Goales and Tyrants hands.
Then thus shall all pray
And eke ever say
O LIVE for eve R,
Thou True Reformer.
Then Victor CROMWELL
Ring thou the said Knell.
And thus also still prays he Who is poor Englands suffering Be.
THat ye brave Soldiers who in war
have lost your blood by many a skar,
And do profess our freedoms gain,
may not delay but take the pain
To hang th'Lawyers Gowns by the Scottish flags,
and let old Tyburn break their Crags.
So shall true Justice smile on them
that have unjustly ruined men,
Since Henry th eight, that cruel Swain
until the breach of Charles his wain.
In January forty eight,
the year of Lawyers greatest height,
Atturneys Coalers greatest power
who cruelly do us devour.
Heaven speed confusion to all these,
that so poor England may have ease;
And all her sons from Tyrants thrall,
may be delivered by their fall.
The, etc.
Consumate this brave Soldiers all
who are so deep ingagde, and call
To mind your protestations,
your Vows and Declarations
Made to God and this Nation,
In a most solemn fashion.
But, etc.
If this in you was mere Delusion,
then know it will prove your own confuson
This is the judgment true V. C.
of him that is Englands suffering B.
For, etc.
Whiles Lawyers, Priests, and Goalers sway,
to Fees, Tyths, Bribes we are made a prey.
Heaven look on this Impiety,
revenge thy cause, end this our misery:
Power down thy vengeance on all those
that mercy slight and so become thy foes
Amen, Amen, Amen I say,
amend or end them all I pray.
For Priests the Word do fell for Gold.
and Lawyers Justice impiously and bold.
Probatum est.
