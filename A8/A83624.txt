Die Jovis, 21 Martii, 1643.
WHereas the Lords and Commons Assembled in Parliament, by an Ordinance of the
14. of January, 1642. did for several reasons in the said Ordinance
mentioned, prohibit all Ships and other Vessels, to carry Provisions of
Victuals, Arms, or Money, unto New Castle, Sunderland, or Blithe, or make
return of any Coals, or Salt, from either the said places, under pain of
seizure of the said Ships, and Vessels, and their Lading.

And whereas by the good Providence and Blessing of Almighty God, and the
endeavors of our Brethren of Scotland, the Towns and Ports of Sunderland,
and Blithe, are lately rescued out of the hands of the Enemy, and reduced to
the obedience of the King and Parliament: The Inhabitants of which places, by
reason of the Rapine and spoil of the Enemy, have been probably brought to
some Extremity of Want.

It is this day Ordered by the Lords and Commons, That it shall and may be
lawful for any person or persons, under the obedience of the King and
Parliament from hence forward, to Trade and go with their Ships and Vessels
unto either of the said Ports of Sunderland, or Blithe, and to carry with them
Arms, Ammunition, Corn, or any other Provision of Victuals, for the Relief
of the said Inhabitants, And the Armies of our said Brethren of Scotland, or
such other Forces as are, or shall be employed in the Service of the King and
Parliament, for the defense of the King, Parliament, and Kingdom; And to make
returns of Coals, Salt, or other Merchandises, from the said several Ports,
unto any Port or place within this Kingdom, which are, or shall be, under the
power of the Parliament; any Former Order, or Ordinance to the contrary in any
wise notwithstanding.

Die Iovis, 21 Martii, 1643.
ORdered by the Lords Assembled in Parliament, That this Ordinance be forthwith
Printed and published.
