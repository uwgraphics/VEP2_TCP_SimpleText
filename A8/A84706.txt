And therefore there remains nothing now, but that you go on with
cheerfulness, you go on with duty, you go on with the expressions, that may
rejoice the heart of so gracious, so just, and so good a King; and that may be
more then showers in the drought, and heat of Summer to refresh and cheer this
Kingdom, and all his Majesty's Dominions,

His Majesty's SPEECH.
Mr. Speaker,
I Will only say one word to you, now that you are the Speaker, I command you
to do the Office of a Speaker; which is faithfully to report the great cause
of the meeting, that my Lord Keeper in my name, did represent unto you the last
day, with this assurance, that you giving me your timely help, in this great
affair, I shall give a willing ear to all our just Grievances.

FINIS.
