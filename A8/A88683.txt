A small Mite, In Memory of the late deceased (yet still living, and never to
be forgotten) Mr. WILLIAM ERBERY.

Being 1. An Acrostick on the letters of his name. 2. An Elegy on his death,
or worthy living fame.


Whereunto are added Two New SONGS:

The one being some brief Touches on the 12 Chapter of the Revelation, more
fully to be enlarged in the experimental Christian.

The other, touching the doing away of Sin through the Lord Christ in our
souls, and the dostroying all our mental enemies: with other remarkable
Passages.

Some are dead that seem alive:
But Erbery's worth shall still survive.
April 20, 1654.

READER,
It Is above my dull capacity to set forth the true worth of the heroic Erbery,
in these few rude and unpolisht lines: but I hope some able Pen will mend my
deficiency herein, in giving the true Character of that holy harmless man; for
which not only the world hated him, but also many Church-ones: but it is to be
hoped they did it ignorantly.

I know Momus and Zoilus will have a fling at these few lines, (although they
be but as grave-clothes) that I have put on him; (he deserving a more sublime
garb) but all that I shall say (as to that) is, That 'twere well if we that are
ready to judge and censure others, would no longer do it in words but in
actions of righteousness: viz. if others be proud, tyrannical, envious, bitter,
deceitful, let us be meek, humble, loving, faithful, as Christ was: This is
that against which there is no law; and this is the kingdom and life of Christ,
which shall in time abide when all that is a lie shall vanish away.

I am thine to power, J. L.
April 25. 1654.
An Acrostick on the letters of the name of the incomparably loving Mr. William
Erbery.
W hat if thy flesh has lost its form?
I n us thou living art:
L ight that is of God in thee was born,
L ove centred in thy heart.
I n and through storms thou have been led:
A ll clouds before thee fell;
M an true, that is one with God the Head,
E ven in thy life will dwell.
R ight Resurrection we do own;
B elieve's, you need not fear't:
E ternally it shall be known;
R isen Erbery's light will clear't.
Y et many real hearts could weep,
'Cause thus thy flesh does seem to sleep.
But if the Envious to rejoice,
Thinking thy life has lost its voice,
They Will be deceived: for it will live,
Their Serpent mortal wounds to give.
An ELEGY On the late deceased Mr. WILLIAM ERBEAY, Who is not dead, but
sleeps.
IF ever God in man appeared,
He did in Erbery:
If ever light of late was cleared,
'Twas through his single eye.
(...) He had the Radix of true Love
That in this Age was found:
His heart divinely was above;
His judgment most profound.
He was the Dove for Innocence,
The Lion for true Courage;
The Lamb he was, for Passiveness,
Most humble in his carriage.
O how did he base Earth contemn,
With all its Vanities!
A servant he was to all men,
Yet scorned to take Tithes,
But he is dead! -- Sure't cannot be;
It Is but the earthly matter:
His life is to Eternity,
Though never under water.
Oh how did Forms before him fall,
That had not Christian power!
They Are brought into confusion all,
Much like the Babel tower.
He was that noble true Divine,
Though sometimes in dark clouds:
God often has so appeared in time,
To spoil our Idol-shrouds.
I want words to express that worth
That did in him remain:
A man (most true) in Love brought forth,
At Greatness did not aim.
I think I said he was not dead;
I wish he be not so:
His life can scarce be parallelled
In any that I know.
But why do Formalists triumph,
And Churches seem to smile,
As if his light were quite defunct?
God is not so servile,
As to be tied unto his form,
And only there to be;
His Principles in thousands born,
Would 'twere; his Innocence Viz. that Innocence that appeared in M. Erbery
which is rarely found in any.
:
Then would sin, hell, and devils all,
Away before it fly;
'Twould prove most fatal to them all,
And slay the evil eye.
How firmly did he still abide
All persecuting storms!
How could he in his bosom hide
(Through Love that Envy scorns)
His greatest enemies? He could bless,
And Love for Malice give.
The Son of God, all may confess,
Did truly in him live.
Some brief Touches on the twelfth Chapter of the Revelation; although not all
that might be.
The Tune, When the -- enjoys his, etc.
IN heaven a wonder did appear;
A woman clothed with the Sun:
On Luna's glory she did tread;
Her head with stars was crowned upon.
The woman was with child,
Groaning in pain turmoil'd,
Expecting a deliverance:
For she was sore oppressed,
But in the end was blessed:
For she bore a Son; 'twas no mischance.
The woman which in pangs appeared,
Might be man's weakness which we feared:
The Sun and Moon, with Stars her crown,
Might be all Forms which we did own:
The Child she brings to birth
Is him that rules the earth,
And does our potent enemies slay:
Yea, Sin, Hell, Devil,
With all that is called Evil,
When the Man-child's born shall quite decay.
Another wonder I Will declare;
A Dragon great, of Edom's die,
In heaven also he did appear,
With heads of strange monstrosity:
His tail drew the Stars,
And caused many Wars:
Before the woman he did stand,
The Child to oppress,
And the woman to distress:
But God did save them from his hand.
The greatest Dragons tyranny,
Which comes from the evil eye:
His Hydra's heads with crowns and horns,
May be the cheats in finest Forms;
In which we mounted hie,
And unto God did cry,
'Cause that our rotten hearts did hide.
The Dragon seemed a Saint,
And did the outside paint:
Thus Serpent-like he was our guide.
For he can a time-server be,
So long as Honor bears sway:
Like a Cameleon change will he,
As long as Thine and Mine we say. Viz. That which is truly Gods, and we call
ours, but is not.

He can turn up his eyes,
And yet for blood he cries:
His color you have heard is red:
And if he weep and pray,
His end is to destroy
(Like the Crocodile) the Child our Head.
In heaven also a Combat's fought
'Twixt Mich'el and the evil one;
Who has put the devil to the rout,
And now he is out of heaven thrown.
Now we joy and sing
Unto the Lord our King,
Which the Accuser has destroyed.
Now Conscience is free
From the good and evil tree: When Saints are in heaven.

There Is none in heaven that are afraid.
Wherefore you that in heaven be,
A glorious life you have attained;
Now from the devil you are free,
And now in God you rest have gained.
But those that live on earth
Shall feel the Dragons wrath:
(...) Their weakness he would live upon,
But that their life's in Christ their Head.
They may well meaning be,
And yet they clearly see
That Christ to God does none accuse.
They may not fully know
It Is Moses that does so *, Joh. 5.45.

Since man does good and evil choose.
A spiritual Song touching the doing away of SIN through Christ, and the
bringing in of Love, and freeing us from our Enemies.
Tune, S -- a Charge.
1.
TO him that is all, yet one,
Sing with joy, sing with joy;
Our God he is alone:
Sing with joy.
It Is he blots out all sin;
In him we joy and sing,
'Cause we are one with him:
It Is tidings glad we bring.
Sing with joy, sing with joy.
2.
Our hearts are void of care:
Sing with joy, sing with joy.
Our minds no ill do fear:
Sing with joy.
No bug bears us affright,
Or evil's in our sight Viz. In the sight of that which is born of God, so as
to harm it.
:
The devil's put to flight;
We walk in the true light.
Sing with joy, sing with joy.
3.
Those that are blind shall see,
Sing with joy, sing with joy,
Gods glorious unity.
Sing with joy.
The deaf his truth shall hear,
And freed shall be from care,
By love that casts out fear:
Then they with us shall share.
Sing with joy, sing with joy.
4.
Sinai does pass away:
Sing with joy, sing with joy:
Sion's will be the day:
Sing with joy.
For Faith and Hope shall cease
Before you are at peace:
It Is Love must give you ease,
(...) For in old Adam he resides:
But the woman's Child's in heaven,
And has all power given,
To destroy the devil and earth besides.
But while the Dragon lives in earth,
He persecutes the woman mild:
But she with Eagles wings does flee
Above his envy through her Child:
In the wilderness she stood,
Until the Dragons flood
Which would have drowned her, was decayed:
And of the earth had help,
Though the devil in it dwelt.
When the woman's strong, the devil's afraid.
And yet for war he does appear
Against the woman and her seed:
He calls Gods strangeness madness vain;
His foolish things he down would tread.
He cries much for Forms,
But God in many scorns,
And calls it horrible Blasphemy:
He Will tell you man shall rise
When Christ comes from the skies;
But Emmanuel he down would cry.
The Dragon further does go on
To flay the remnant of her seed:
(...) When Forms shall quite decease.
Sing with joy, sing with joy.
5.
Churches to Love must come:
Sing with joy, sing with joy:
Which thinks hurt to none.
Sing with joy.
Or else they will hardly see
The glorious liberty
Of Gods sons that are free;
But in dark hell will be.
Sing with joy, sing with joy.
6.
What though black storms appear?
Sing with joy, sing with joy.
The great Whore is in fear.
Sing with joy:
Her flesh is now on fire;
She Will hardly mount much higher,
Though she does still aspire:
Her Beast begins to tire.
Sing with joy, sing with joy.
7.
When God the Whore has burned:
Sing with joy, sing with joy:
And all her bastards spurned:
Sing with joy:
And spoiled her golden Cup,
Of which she made us sup:
Then we shall see, we hope,
Her Formal shop shut up.
Sing with joy, sing with joy.
8.
Then man the Lord shall find,
Sing with joy, sing with joy:
And know his all-great mind.
Sing with joy.
Then we shall clearly see
Of God the mystery
Of Trine in Unity,
And how he All will be.
Sing with joy, sing with joy.
FINIS.
