The Grand Impostor EXAMINED: OR, The Life, Trial, and Examination OF JAMES
NAYLER, The Seduced and Seducing QUAKER WITH The Manner of his Riding into
BRISTOL.

Whereunto is added, The Sentence passed upon him by the High Court of
Parliament.

JOH.19.7. We have a law, and by our law he ought to die; because he made
himself the Son of God. LONDON, Printed for Henry Brom, at the Hand in S.
Paul's Churchyard. 1657.

To the READER
Courteous Reader,
I Do here give thee an account of what passed between James Nayler and his
Judges, as thinking it a part of my duty toward God and man; that thereby thou
may see and know there is but one only God, and one only Jesus, which is
the Christ, who was crucified by the Jews at Jerusalem: Which whosoever denies,
let him be accursed.

It has been the Custom in former times, to Immure, Stone, or other ways
punish with Death such as did falsely style themselves the only Sons of the
most High God; As thou may see in that faithful Chronologer, John Speed; who
affirms, that in the Reign of King HENRY the third, there appeared a Grand
Impostor somewhat in wickedness resembling this of whom we are to treat: this
(Man or rather Devil) thinking himself to be somebody, boasted himself to be
nobody in the eyes of the World, but as being sent from Heaven; And having a
grave and impudent aspect, pretended himself to be no less then the Savior of
Mankind: And to strike a belief into the easily-seduced People, he had wounded
his Hands, and Feet, and Side; Affirming these to be the Wounds which the Jews
had given him at JERUSALEM. For which blasphemous and horrid Doctrine, he was
sentenced to be starved to death between the Walls of a strong Prison; Where he
and his Doctrine died: Even So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord.

Thou will in his Examination discover some difference to be between him and
George Fox: but I suppose they are again reconciled.

I shall not trouble thee with all the many Letters which were conveyed from
him to others, or from them to him, lest I make my Relation swell too big: I
shall only give thee one or two of the chiefest; Out of which if thou can
pick but a little sense, and less truth, thou can do more then

Thy loving friend.
December.16, 1656.
James Naylors Examination.
READER,
THinking it a very good foundation to my building, to give you the manner of
his progress, before you come to his confession; or before his blasphemy
aspires to the stool of Repentance. I shall thus begin: James Naylor of
Wakefield in the County of York, a deluded and deluding Quaker and Imposter,
rode October last through a Village called Bedminster, about a mile from
Bristol, accompanied with six more, one whereof was a young man, whose head was
bare, leading his horse by the bridle, and another uncovered before him, through
the durty way in which the Carts and Horses and none else usually go. And with
them two men on horseback with each of them a woman behind him, and one woman
walking on the better way or path. In this posture did they march, and in such
a case, that one George Witherley noting their condition, asked them to come in
the better rode, adding that God expected no such extremity: but they continued
on their way, not answering in any other notes, but what were musical, singing
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabbath,etc. Thus continued they, till by their
wandering they came to the Almsehouse within the Suburbs of Bristol, where one
of the women alighted, and she with the other of her own sex lovingly marched on
each side of Naylor's Horse. This Witherley says, he supposes they could not
be less deep in the muddy way then to the knees, and he says they sang, but
sometimes with such a buzzing mel- ODIOVS noise that he could not understand
what it was. This the said Witherley gave in upon his oath. Thus did they reach
Ratcliff-gate, with Timothy Wedlock of Devon bare-headed, and Martha Symonds
with the bridle on one side and Hannah Stranger on the oher side of the Horse;
this Martha Simonds is the wife of Thomas Simonds of London, Bookbinder, and
Hannah Stranger is the Wife of John Stranger of London Combmaker, who sung
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Israel. Thus did he ride to the high Cross in
Bristol, and after that to the White-hart in Broadstreet, where there lies two
eminent Quakers, by name, Dennis Hollister, and Henry Row; of which the
Magistrates hearing they were apprehended and committed to prison.

Long it had not been after their consinement in the Goal at Exeter, from
whence passing through Wells and Glassenbury this party bestrewed the way
with their garments. But to be short they were searched, and Letters were found
about them, infinitely filled with profane nonsensicall language; which
Letters I shall not trouble you with, only some of the chief, lest your
patience should be too much cloyd. We shall have now to their axaminations; and
because Naylor was the chief actor it is fit he have the pre-eminence of
leading the way in their Examinations, we shall therefore give you a full
account of what passed between the Magistrate and him, which take as
follows:

He entered the Court with a confident resolution, his Hat on, which he offered
not to take off, but without using any civil respect to any one, he Answered in
this manner to these following questions.

The Examination of James Naylor, and others.
BEing asked his name, or whether he was not called James Naylor, he replied:
The men of this world call me James Naylor. hhy Q Art not thou the man that rid
on horseback into Bristol, a woman leading thy horse, and others singing before
thee Holy, holy, holy, Hosannah, etc.

A. I did ride into a Town, but what its name was I know not, and by the Spirit
a woman was commanded to hold my horses bridle; and some there were that cast
down clothes, and sang praises to the Lord, such songs as the Lord put into
their hearts; and its like it might be the Song of Holy, holy, holy, etc.

Q. Whether or no did thou reprove those women?

A. Nay, but I bad them take heed that they sang nothing but what they were
moved to of the Lord.

Q. Do thou own this Letter ( whereupon a Letter was showed him) which
Hannah Stranger sent unto thee?

A. Yea, I do own that Letter?

Q. Art thou (according to that Letter) the fairest of ten thousand?

A. As to the visible I deny any such attribute to be due unto me; but if as to
that which the Father has begotten in me, I shall own it. But now Reader,
before I pass further, I hold it not impertient to deliver you the words of
the same Letter, with another, which were these:

A Letter to James Naylor at Exeter, by Hannah Stranger.
J. N.
IN the pure fear and power of God, my soul salutes thee, Thou everlasting
son of righteousness and Prince of peace; oh how my soul travelleth to see
this day which Abraham did and was glad, and so shall all that are of faithful
Abraham: O suffer me to speak what the Lord has moved. There is one
temptation near, the like unto the first, and is like the wisdom of God, but
it is not, and therefore it must be destroyed. Oh it desileth and hates the
innocent; I beseech thee wait, my soul travelleth to see a pure Image brought
forth, and the enemy strive to destroy it, that he may keep me always
sorrowing, and ever seeking, and never satisfied, nor never rejoicing: But he
in whom I have believed will shortly tread satan under our feet, and then shall
thou and thine return to Zion with everlasting rejoycings and praises. But till
then better is the house of mourning then rejoicing, for he that was made a
perfect example, when he had fasted the appointed time of his father, was
tempted to eat, and to show a miracle, to prove himself to be the Son of
God: But man lives not by bread, said he, and now no more by that wisdom shall
he live, on which he has long fed as on bread, and as his food has been so
must his fast be, and then at the end temptation, to as low a thing as a stone,
that if it were possible the humility and the miracles would deceive the
elect, innocent, and righteous branch of holiness. But be his wills never so
many, the time comes he shall leave thee, for he is faithful, who has
promised he will not leave the Throne of David without a man to sit thereon,
which shall judge the poor with righteousness, and the World with equity.
This shall shortly come to pass, and then shall the vision speak and not lie.
O let innocence be thy beloved, and righteousness thy Spouse, that thy fathers
lambs may rejoice in thy pure and clear unspotted image of holiness and
purity, which my soul believes I shall see, and so in the faith rest. I am in
patience, vvait, and the power will preserve from subtilty, though under never
so zealous a pretense of innocent wisdom it be, yet shall the Lord not suffer
his holy one to see corruption, nor his soul to lie in Hell, but will cause
the mountain to melt at his presence, and the little hills to bring him peace;
O I am ready to fear as a servant, and to obey as a child. If I have spoken
words too high, love has constrained me, which is as strong as death, and with
the same spirit cover them as they are spoken with, and then shall the spirit
of David be witnessed, who refused not words though from his servants mouth; if
they were in the fear, I am his servant, and he my Master, whom I love and
fear, and trust I shall do unto the end.

Hannah Stranger.
From London, 16. day, of the 7th. month.
Hereafter follows the Letter wherein John Stranger calls James Naylor
Jesus.

Another from the same.
OH thou fairest of ten thousand, thou only begotten Son of God, how my heart
pants after thee; O stay me with flagons, and comfort me with Wine. My well
beloved thou art like a Roe, or young Heart upon the mountains of Spices, where
thy beloved Spouse has long been calling thee to come away, but has been but
lately heard of thee. Now it lies something upon me that thou mindst to see
her, for the spirit and power of God is with her; And there is given to her
much of excellent and innocent wisdom arissen and arising in her, which will
make all the honest-hearted to praise the Lord alone, and no more set up self.
And therefore let not my Lord and Master have any jealousy again of her, for
she is highly beloved of the Lord, and that shall all see who come to know the
Lord. And now he does bless them that bless his, and curse them that curse
his: for this has the Lord showed me, That her portion is exceeding large in
the Lord; and as her sorrow has been much, so shall her joy be much more,
which rejoices my heart, to see her walk so valiantly and faithfully in the
work of the Lord, in this time of so great trials as has been laid upon her
especially.

And I am Hannah Stranger.

The Postscript.
Remember my dear love to thy Master. Thy name is no more to be called James
but Jesus.

Christ Jesus, in whom I am revealed, may be given to him, as when on earth at
Jerusalem, according to the measure.

Q. Art thou the unspotted Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world?

Q. Wherefore came thou in such an unusual posture, as, two women leading thy
horse; others singing Holy, holy, etc. with another before thee bare-headed,
knee-deep in the high-way-mud, when thou might have gone in the Causey; and
at such a time, that it raining, thy companions received the rain at their
necks and vented it at their hose and breeches?

me, called her so.

Q. Thou have a wife at this time?

A. A woman I have, whom by the world is called my wife; and some children I
have, which according to the flesh are mine.

Q. Those books which thou have writ, will thou maintain them, and affirm what
is therein?

The Sentence which it pleased the high Court of Parliament to pronounce
against James Nayler.
THat he stand in the Pillory on Thursday (being December 18. 1656.) in the new
Palace at Westminster, for two hours; and then by the Hangman to be whipped
from Westminster to the Old Exchange, London; and there also to stand in the
Pillory two hours, on Saturday next, between Eleven and one; with an
Inscription fastened to him, relating his Crimes: and at the old Exchange, to
have his tongue bored through with an Hotiron; and in the forehead stigmatized
with B: and that he be conveyed through Bristol with his face toward the horses
tail, and there likewise whipped; and after returned to London, to remain a
prisoner in Bridewel, during the pleasure of the honorable Parliament.

ACcording to the sentence pronounced, he was whipped from Westminster to the
Old Exchange; and from thence conveyed to Newgate, where (the next day) there
came unto him one Robert Rich (so called) who when he was approaching near him
sang, but what it was, I know not: but when he saw James Nayler, he saluted
him, by bowing to him: and having asked whether he had prayed for him; James
answered, Yea, he had. Whereupon, this Rich took him round the middle, stroaked
his face, and kissed him. And having took his leave of James Nayler, he
descended the stairs, saying, Oh ye hard hearted people, and unbelieving
Generation, will ye not believe, although ye see such wonders, signs and
miracles wrought before ye?

Another came to him, and said unto him thus: James, none will venture to come
and see thee, but Paul, Nicodemus, and I.

ON December. 20. was presented a Petition concerning James Nayler, the effect of
which was, that the sentence might not be wholly executed at the time
appointed, by reason of some distemper in his body: whereupon it was ordered
that he should stand in the Pillory at the old Exchange on the Saturday
following, and to suffer the rest of his punishment, which should before have
been inflicted.

On the 24 of the same month the aforesaid Robert Rich presented a Petition,
the effect of which was, that he himself might suffer the rest of the
punishment which was to be inflicted on James Nayler; but that not being
granted, James Nayler was December. 27. conveyed to the Exchange; where,
according to former order, the residue of his punishment was executed.

Being mounted the Pillory, Robert Rich accompanied him, with comfortable
words, kisses, and stroakings on his face, until the remainder of Justice was
executed; Nayler having stood till two of the clock, he was let out: the
Executioner then addressing himself in order to what followed; he took a cap
and put it on the head of James Nayler, below his eyes: which cap, Robert Rich
hastily snatched from him, and put it on below his nose: then the Executioner
having bound his arms with cords to the Pillory, he bad him put forth his
Tongue, which he freely did; and the Executioner, with an Iron. about the
bigness of a Quill, bored the same, and by order from the Sheriff, held it in a
small space, to the end the Beholders might see and bear witness that the
sentence was truly executed: then having took it out, he marked him in the
forehead with a B. at the which he not so much as stirred: but having been
marked, he took the Executioner in his arms, and hugged him; and Robert Rich,
through his ardent affection, licked the wound on his forehead. The
superscription over his head was, For HORRID BLASPHEMY, GRAND IMPOSTURE, and
SEDUCING OF THE PEOPLE: which inscription Robert Rich endeavored to smother,
by clapping another over it, which was, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. Thus
having given you an account concerning him, I shall now proceed to the
examination of his accomplices: which take in order.

Here follows a Relation concerning one of his Companions.
ONe of James Naylers Disciples having attained to some knowledge in the
French-tongue, went over into France to a City called Bordeaux, where entering
into a Congregation of the Protestants, he began after his wonted manner here
in England, to cry out in the open Congregation against the Minister, calling
him conjurer, liar, impostor, deceiver; and the elders and people being
astonished at the novelty, and reputing him a madman, came and told him, that
they had laws in France, to protect the Congregations either of Papists or
Protestants from any disturbance; and thrust him forth of their Church.

Upon which, he went into the Churchyard, and upon a stone continued his
discourse, which drew the whole Congregation out of the Church, after him, and
caused the Minister to give over, and the elders coming again to him, told him,
that he being a stranger they were willing to favor him; but seeing he did
continue his disturbance, they would commit him to justice: he told them,
Justice was never in that place until his appearance.

Upon that, they took him away to the Governor where being brought, with his
hat on, he asked the Governor what he was; who told him he was the Governor
of that place, under the King of France: he said, that he would not answer him
as Governor, his Government being carnal: and a certain Bishop being with the
Governor, who was a Papist, desiring that he might question him, and demanding
what he was, he told him he was an Englishman, and sent of the Lord to prepare
his way: he demanded of the Bishop what he was, who told him he was a Bishop:
whereupon he replied, That against him he was sent, who was one of the Locusts
that was sent forth of the bottomless pit; and that the weapons he had with him
was fitted to destroy him and the whole Kingdom of Antichrist, who was held in
darkness and blindness; and that he was to pour out Vials of the Fathers Wrath
upon him: The Governor perceiving several of the People to be infected with
his Doctrine, demanded if there was any ship ready to sail for England; which
being informed of, he therein shipped him; being not willing to use extremity to
a stranger, but caused some six or seven who had been infected with his
Doctrine, to be whipped through the streets.

A Relation concerning some others of the same Tribe.
SEven or eight others went over in a vessel to New England, where being
arrived, they began to spread themselves; but the Governor having notice,
caused them to be clapped up close in a Castle, and would not suffer any to come
to see them under penalty of five pounds; in the mean time he sent for the
Master of the ship that brought them, and commanded him immediately to carry
them back into old England; which he refusing, was also clapped up close prisoner
until he consented and took them aboard again: at their departure, they shook
off the dust off their feet, as a testimony against that place.

Now, Reader, I shall close up all with a word or two of the Life and Actions
of James Nayler.
HE is a man of so erroneous and unsanctified a Disposition, that it is hard to
say whether heresy or impudency bears the greater rule in him, as will
appear,

First, in what he testifies before sufficient witnesses; see the brief
Relation of the Northern Quakers, page.22. that he was as holy, just, and good
as God himself. And

Secondly, That he in a Letter to one in Lancaster, expressly says, That he
that expected to be saved by Jesus Christ that died at Jerusalem, shall be
deceived: see Mr. Billingsly's Defense of the Scriptures, page.16. The Perfect
Pharisee, page 8. And so said another of that Sect: he was not such a fool, as
to hope to be saved by Jesus Christ that died at Jerusalem sixteen hundred
years ago: See Mr. Farmer's Mystery of Godliness and ungodliness: Thus they
glory in their ignorance, and count that foolishness which is the true Wisdom.

Thirdly, in a letter I had in my possession, but now lent to a friend,
subscribed by the Pastor and other members of that Congregation in the North,
whereof Nayler once was a member, till for his apostasy he was excommunicated,
It is offered to be proved, and by them testified to be true, that one Mris.
Roper, her husband being gone on some occasion from her a long voyage, this
Nayler frequented her company, and was seen to dandle her upon his knee, and
kiss her lasciviously: and in that time of his society with her, she was
brought to bed with a child, when her husband had been absent seven and forty
weeks to a day from her; and on a time he was seen to dance her in a private
room; and having kissed her very often, she took occasion to say, Now James, what
would the world say if they should see us in this posture? to which he said
somewhat, but he was so low, that it could not be heard. This was objected
against him, but he denied to answer it before the said Church; alleging, that
he would not speak to them that spoke not immediately by the Spirit.

Fourthly, in that when I had discourse with him concerning perfect perfection,
at the Bull and Mouth, he said I was a liar to say he owned it; then I proved
it from his own writings, as that he said, they that say they have faith, and
their life is not the life of Christ, and them that say they have faith, and
yet they cannot be saved from their sins but in part in this world, them and
their faith I deny, etc. To which he hypocritically said, that I was a liar to
say that he owned it in himself, though he disowned it in others. And when I
had objected any thing against what he said, he would deny it so soon as he had
spoke it: which to convince the people of his lying deceits, I desired them
that stood by me, to Remember that he said, All that are in the world are of
the world, in direct opposition to that saying of Christ, Joh. 17. I pray not
holy father that thou should take them out of the world, but preserve them
from the evil of the world; which I presently accused him with: for which he
called me liar; for he said, he said not so: I then desired them that heard him
to testify to the truth, against the liar and his deceit; which they did: but
his feared impudence was such, that he said, should a thousand say so, they
were all liars: with much more to the like effect.

For his Character.
HE is a man of a ruddy complexion, brown hair, and flank, hanging a little
below his jaw-bones; of an indifferent height; not very long visaged, nor very
round; close shaven; a sad downlook, and melancholy countenance; a little band,
close to his collar, with no bandstrings; his hat hanging over his brows; his
nose neither high nor low, but rising a little in the middle.

Something concerning some others of them also.
DIsborough not much inferior to Nayler himself, attempting to lie with one
Rebeccah (who was first seduced to be, and then was of their heresy) she asked
him what his wife would say if she should know what he attempted? Disborough
replied, that he gave her the same liberty that he took himself (that was, to
be a whore, as he was a whoremaster) but in short, he having obtained his
desire of her, she asked him how if she should prove with child, he answered,
she must be content to be numbered with the transgressors, and to make her
grave with the wicked (so that he followed not that light which is pure, but
sinned against knowledge) and she the said Rebeccah, as bewailing her sin,
confessed it to one Mr. White a Lincolnshire Gentleman, to whom she added that
Nayler attempted to defile her also; so that in stead of perfect Saints, they
are rather perfect Sophisters.

This Relation under the said Gentleman's hand, and the aforementioned letter
from the Church, whereof Nayler was once a member, were offered to be proved
and made good, in the public meeting at the Bull and Mouth to Nayler's face,
more then once or twice, who was unable to say ought unto it, but left his
standing and sat down silent. They that offered it so to public trial, were,
one Mr. Persivall, and Mr. John Deacon author of the Public discovery of their
Secret deceit.

Some of their Opinions are these:
1. They deny the Scriptures are the Word of God. 2. They esteem their own
Speakings to be of as great authority. 3. They hold it unlawful to expound or
interpret the Scriptures. 4. They say, that he that preaches by a text of
Scripture, is a Conjurer. 5. That the holy letter is carnal. 6. That the Bible
ought to he burned. 7. That Jesus Christ inhabits in their flesh as man. 8.
Some have said, that Christ never ascended into heaven. 9. That to pray that
their sins may be pardoned, is needless. 10. They believe not that there is
another world. 11. Some of them deny the Resurrection. 12. That they cannot
sin, but that they are perfect. 13. They make no distinction of persons. 14.
That the power of the Magistrate is Antichristian. 15. That they have no other
Guide but the Light within them. 16. They deny all civil respects to men, as
putting off the Hat, bowing, etc. 17. That it is sinful to wear any superfluous
Ornaments.
A Friend of mine being desirous to be resolved of a doubt, as, Whether that
which was reported of that Heretical Sect were more then they erred in, or less
then they erroneously maintained contrary to the Truth; he went unto their
Meeting within Aldersgate: where he had no sooner entered that Synagogue of
Satan, but the then-speaker (namely, George Fox) cried out, (but on what
occasion, he knows not) Quakers, Quakes, Earth's above God, in the open
house, before hundreds then present. At which my friend wondered: and pressing
forwards a little into the multitude, he saw some disputing upon the same
words: who demanding what was the matter, one answered, that George Fox said
Earth is above God; and here is one says, that whatsoever George Fox should or
did say, he would maintain: (pointing to a young man then standing by) to whom
my friend replied, he had undertaken a harder task then he was able to perform:
for God was the Creator of the earth, and all things else; and therefore above
the earth, and not the earth above him that created it, forasmuch as the
workman is above his work: for although an Artificer shall by Art compose any
thing that is never so excellent, yet it can claim no equality with the maker,
in regard that what is excellent in it, is the makers excellency, and not its
own: for, destroy the work, and the workman can make the like; but destroy the
workman with the work, and both perish. To which he replied, He did not mean
the earth under our feet, but earthly sin in man. To which my friend replied,
that now his blasphemy was worse then it was before: for take the earth simply
in it self, it has no prejudice toward God; but sin is that which seeks Gods
destruction, and therefore he was not to be conversed with, being of so
diabolical an opinion.

ONe Stephens of London being on a time at their Meetings, with an intent to
oppose what he should there hear, not agreeing with Truth; which, at his first
coming, he did for a short time, till one of them, taking him by the hand, and
rubbing his wrest very hard; which put him to very sore pain: and so altered
his resolution, that he was so transformed by their enchantments, that he since
confessed, that should any one whatsoever, have dared to oppose or resist them,
as he just before did, he would have stabbed them to the heart, whatsoever had
come of it.

There is one Stephens, (and it is supposed the same) a Quaker, that now lies
stark mad, and has so been a pretty while, through the disturbances of that
Spirit which rules in the old Quakers.

John Deacon.
