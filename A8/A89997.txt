New News from CORNWALL, Being a most true Relation of the strange behavior
of the Cavaliers in that County.

Fully related in two Letters from persons of good quality and reputation
living in that County, unto special friends of theirs living in London.

October. 27. LONDON, Printed for Joshua Kirton, 1642.

The Copy of two Letters from CORNWALL, concerning the late actions of the Kings
and Parliaments Forces there.
AFter the Sheriff of our County had sent abroad his Warrants for posse
Comitatus, to suppress certain forces and unlawful Assemblies gathered
together against the Law, who said Sir Richard Vivyan came to Truro, the day
before the appearance, being the Law Court day when the new Major was chosen,
but before he was sworn, the Knight came to the stairs of the Town Hall, and
prayed to speak with the Major, who coming to him, he said; he would advize
the Town to come forth and send out their Arms, for that it was no Muster but
a Command by Statute Law, upon pain of Imprisonment and Fine and Ransom at
the Kings pleasure, and that it would fall heavy upon them if they came not
forth; the Major replied, that it concerned every particular man in his own
person to appear, but for any man to require another man's Arms (as at Musters)
he saw no such power in the Statute, and that for his part if any that had Arms
assessed on them would go, he would not discourage them; but Sir Richard
Vyvian did so affright the Commons who were gathered together about them with
the danger of the Law, and so persuade them with the Kings Service, and that
they knew not what unlawful Assemblies were gathered in many parts of the
County to the danger of their lives, their wives, and children if they came not
out to assist the Sheriff and Justices; and that he was their Colonel, and
advised for their good, and would take it kindly of them. All this so wrought
upon them, as they were on fire to go in all haste, and came to the Major in
the Court, and required the Town Arms, and the Magistrates Arms, but the Mayor
answered they should have none, for that none was required to seek other men's
Arms, and if they had any Arms assessed on them selves, they might do what
they would, if they had none they need not go; but they said they would go
however, and complain to the Sheriff for want of the Arms, he said he cared
not if they did, for he knew no unlawful Assemblies to be suppressed:
Afterward when the new Major was chosen, he asked the Towns advice what to
do, some said no Armor was required in the Statute, but only by the Warrant,
and that was no Rule for them without Law; but the Recorder being not present
(but refusing to come for fear of himself, and returning no advice about it,
as he was entreated twice by letter from the former Major;) the Town Counsel
being one master Hoblyn, persuaded them by all means to go forth, and send
forth the Arms, else they would be deeply fined, and the Mayor in danger of
great trouble, which hearing, most voices were to send forth the Arms, though
three or four still denied and said, they would go forth too, but their Arms
should never be carried against the Parliament, they would die rather; but the
mayor part by the Counsels means prevailed, which had the Recorder been there
they had not done; well, out they came the next day all of them (or most part)
and sent the Arms; but some kept their men with them, and would not suffer them
to go in among the Bands, but brought them home along with them the next day;
but the first day came a great number, I think near fifteen or sixteen
thousand men but I think not above four thousand armed; propositions were sent
by the Commit to the Sheriff and Gentlemen, who agreed to choose six
Treaties on each side, and to meet next day at Red-yet in Saint Clear, half
way between Bodmin and Lanceston, where Sir Richard Buller was with six or
seven hundred men; but when they met, the Sheriff and his side (with the
Troopers) drew up new Articles of their own so unreasonable as the Committee
could not (commendably or conscionably agree unto; the Treaty thereupon broke
of, and the Treaties returned, whereupon they that did not bring back their men
and Arms with them the first night were stopped; for the second day (being
warned over night to, meet again next day) they suddenly had word to march
forward toward Lanceston, which they did; every Cap. leading his Company, and
every Colonel his Regiment: but by what power I know not, unless the Sheriff
gave them any power so to train and muster; for the Commission of Lievtenancie
is void, and the Militia side appeared not, and for the Array there was no
power neither, for the Lord Mohun has deserted the cause, and did not appear
at all among them, which did at first somewhat daunt them, but the great
appearance of the County upon this plot of the Sheriffs Warrant (advised by
Joseph Ianc, and George Spry, as is conceived for their own ends) put them in
such a height of Pride and Insolency, as they thought it an invincible Army;
and quartered Wednesday about Lisbord, and Thursday some letters past between
Sir Richard Buller out of Lanceston unto some of the Gentlemen with the
Sheriff, as Master Basset and others, who appointed to come into Lanceston
that evening to treat again with him and the rest of the Committees, but
Master Basset came not according to promise, which made the Committee fear
some sudden surprise, and the People of the Town cried out lamentably to Sir
Richard Buller to depart the Town, else they should be all killed, for the
Sheriff had by that time got twenty or thirty thousand; and had sent new
Warrants and threatening messages to those that would not appear, that they
should be hanged at their doors, which so terrified the people, as all the
West part came out except Saint Ives (who petitioned for themselves for fear
of Ireland) and all along, except the Parishes that served under the
Committees: Sir Richard Buller, and the Committees hearing the cries of the
Town, and the rage of the Army, (set on by the Sheriff and John Arundel of
Trevie, Sir Nicholas Slaney, Sir Bevill Greenvile, Sir Richard Vivian, Sir
Peter Courtny, and infinite other Colonels, Captains, and others, calling the
Parliaments side Rebels and Roundheads, and threatening to chop them in pieces,
and beat down the houses, did account it the wisest course (and to avoid
effusion of blood being at such infinite disadvantage) by night privately to
ride away; and after he was gone sent to the Army in the Town to get away with
all speed, which they did in a confused manner, so as they left much of their
Arms behind them, and some they lost on the way; so as on Friday morning the
Sheriff had notice they were all gone and the Town gates set open; then they
all came with great triumph into the Town as Conquerours, where there was no
enemy to resist; but then the baser sort of Rogues fell a plundering of some
houses, the first was Master Ambrose Manningtons house (a Justice of Peace
near the Church within the Town) they brake out a great window and stole away
all his Plate, Pewter, Clothes, and Household Stuff, or the greatest part of it
took his Writings and Deeds and Leases, and tare many of them, yet that
Gentleman Master Mannington was not against them, but a mean party between
both striving by all means to make Peace, only he dwelt there; and when Sir
Richard Buller rode away he went with him and locked up his doors, and thus was
^^bbed; And some other houses were broken up, as Captain Bennets and M^^^^^
Bolithous, and some say two or three other; But when the Sheriff and (...)
heard it, they made Proclamation to apprehend the Thieves, and got back as much
of the goods as they could find into the houses again, though much be lost,
and much spoil done, and near twenty of them in the Jail for it. On
Saturday the Sheriff and Justices held a privy Sessions there at Launceston,
to present and indite all that took up Arms with Sir Richard Buller, as
causers of Riots and unlawful assemblies, and all that came not with them
against the Committee, and caused every Constable and others to bring in the
Names of all that appeared not, and took oath for it, and do purpose to send
Warrants to apprehend them and imprison them, or Fine them and distraine them;
Among whom I am complained against, and shall (I doubt not) hear shortly of
it: Then they resolved on Monday to advance toward Salt-Ash, and leave a
Garrison at Launceston, but hearing they of Salt-Ash would not resist (but open
their Gates) they came not thither, but gave out they would march into
Devonshire toward Plimoth, if Devonshire men had given the least assistance to
our Committee, which they thought to do, as by their letter appears, to
which the Sheriff and Gentlemen answered peremptorily as you may see enclosed,
and upon their quiet reply all was stayed; and so their Army disbanded, and
every man returned home, with such base exclamation upon the Committees,
calling them Roundheads and Run-awayes, and with extreme violence and
madness so as I never heard the like.

Thus you have the full Relation of the first part of the Chronicle of
Cornwalls second Commotion; The next part must be of the Parliaments side,
which is expected daily.

Dear Friend,
I Do desire to inform you, and my friends with you; how things are with us,
when Sir Ralph Hopton and the Cavaliery came into Cornwall, Sir Richard Buller
and the Committee endeavored to resist them, but were unhappy in the success,
Sir Richard repaires to Launceston; where he had 9. Colors, many Gentlemen
were hearty in the cause; The Sessions was about that time at Trurow and
Lostwithiell, where they indict Sir Ralph Hopton and his Confederates for
coming into the County in a hostile manner, he traverseth his judgment there
and appears at Trurow, where the Jurie (being a pact Jurie as they use to call
it) freed him, and master Humphrey Noy being Foreman, makes a short Speech to
Sir Ralph in way of thankfulness to him for his coming into the County, for
securing of the Gentlemen from that violence intended to them by Sir Richard
Buller, at the close whereof there was a plaudite in the Hall; Then there was
an Indictment framed against Sir Richard Buller for a Riot, which was speedily
found (such a president I believe never was) and to suppress him, the Justices
of the Peace require a posse comitatus, the Sheriff gives out his Warrants
withal expedition, and the people as readily obey, for by Lostwithiell there
appeared, as is credibly reported 25000. or 30000. in so much as it was a rare
thing to see a man about Trurow, or in any of the Western parts; from thence
they advance toward Launceston, where Sir Richard with his small Force lay,
being promised aid from Devon, but disappointed, he desired the Devon men
only to secure Polson Bridge, that he might have a place of retreat, but could
not obtain it; whereupon he was constrained to leave the Town, and disband,
so that all Cornwall is under the command of Sir Ralph and his Troopers, they
are now 600 horse at Salt Ash with 300. Foot which puts the Town of Plimoth in
great fear, yet they are in a posture able to resist 5000, if they should
assault them, the Town is very hearty for the King and Parliament, but in the
mean Cornwall is lost, we expected aid from the Parliament long since, but as
yet none is come; I pray God the public cause do not suffer by it, all good
Ministers and Christians almost have left Cornwall, and take sanctuary at
Plymouth. Many Cornish and Devon Ministers are come here, poor Christians,
like banished exiles leave their home, the Cavalliers have plundered many
houses, and threaten poor Ministers and Christians; Most part of our Gentlemen
are here. Sir Richard Buller and his Family, Master Irefusis Eresey, Sir Awbin
Godolphin, Trevenrag Ellyet, with diverse others here are three Commanders come,
but no Foot nor Troops, I pray GOD they may come timely or we are undone; The
names of the Commanders are, Colonel Ruthen, Captain Stevenson with other
Valiant Scots; there is a brave Troop of Horse in Town about 80. Volunteers
of the Townsmen these the Commanders Exercise almost every day upon the How
there is a brave young Gentleman, one Captain Dickes, who hearing the
Cavaliers intended to come to Saltash went up with 200. of his Company; There
were there formerly 200. of Plymouth, and he resolved to make good the Town
against that huge Army, but the Mayor would not permit him, they are so
zealous for the public cause as they desire to be doing.

Your real Friend, I. C.
Plimonth the 20. of October, 1642.
