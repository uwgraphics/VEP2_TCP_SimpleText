A DECLARATION OF His Excellency the Lord Fairfax, Lord General, AND His
Council of War, Concerning their Resolution to preserve and protect the
Freedom of Trade and Commerce.
Whereas the Enemies of the Peace of this Kingdom, being sufficiently sensible
how all their designs for the ruin and destruction thereof have, by the
blessing of God upon our endeavors, been rendered abortive and made successless
to the producing of that effect, have notwithstanding, out of their restless
desire to bring their wicked purposes into execution, watched for and pursued
all opportunities, that they could either make or meet with, conducing to that
end; and have not ceased to lay upon us and lade us with all manner of Slander
and Calumny, that might not only make us unacceptable to those of whom We have
best deserved, but also render Us odious to all the World: And being informed
that the said Enemies of the Kingdom have, upon occasion of some of our late
just and necessitated Actions, given publicly out, and written to the parts
beyond the Seas, that We intend to put all into Ruin and Confusion, and to
seize upon all Men's Estates, destroy Propriety, Trade and Commerce, and that
their goods cannot be in any security while We are in this Town, or keep in our
hands any of the strengths of the Kingdom; and understanding that thereupon
Bills of Exchange begin to be questioned, and some persons begin to convey away
their goods; We being very sensible how much the Wealth, Peace and Happiness of
this Kingdom is concerned in the Freedom and Fullness of the Trade and Commerce
thereof; and how much the said Enemies of Peace should prevent their foresaid
wicked end, if their said Calumnies should go on to be believed: We do
therefore hereby declare, That as by all the Adventures of our Lives and Blood
We have sought nothing more then the prosperity of this Kingdom, and the
establishing of Justice and Righteousness in the Land; so there is nothing that
We more abhor then those wicked Calumnies, that We should invade the Propriety
of any not wilfully making themselves Enemies, or do any thing any way, to
hinder or obstruct that Trade and Commerce by which this Kingdom does both
subsist and flourish: But that We shall, in a most especial manner, protect,
defend, encourage and maintain, in all just ways (according to the Law of
Nations, and the manner hitherto practiced in this Kingdom) all manner of
Trade, Traffic and Commerce either by English or Strangers: and that We shall
neither do, nor suffer to be done, as far as is in our power, any violence,
wrong or injustice to the persons or goods of any, as aforesaid, exercising any
Trade or Commerce in this Kingdom, either by Sea or Land: Which we thought fit
to publish for the satisfaction of all persons concerned herein.

By the appointment of his Excellency the Lord General Lord Fairfax, and his
Council of War, Signed, JO: RUSHWORTH, Secretary.
