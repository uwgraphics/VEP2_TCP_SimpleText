A SPEECH MADE BY KING HENRY THE 8th.
To the House of COMMONS the 23. of December, 1546. and in the 38. year of his
Reign.
ALthough my Chauncellor for the time being, has before this time used very
eloquently, and substantially to make answer to such Orations, as has been
set forth in this high Court of Parliament, yet is he not so able to open and
set forth my mind and meaning, and the secrets of my heart in so plain and
ample a manner, as I my self am, and can do: wherefore I taking upon me to
answer your eloquent Oration Mr. Speaker, say that where you, in the name of
our beloved Commons, have both praised and extolled me, for the notable quality
that you have conceived to be in me, I most heartily thank you all, that you
have put me in remembrance of my duty, which is to endeavor my self to
obtain, and get such excellent qualities and necessary virtues, as a Prince or
Governor should, and ought to have, of which gifts I recognize my self both
bare and barren, but of such small qualities as God has indewed me withal: I
render to his goodness my most humble thanks, intending withal my wit and
diligence, to get and acquire to me such notable virtues, and princely
qualities, as you have alleged to be incorporated in my person: these thanks
for your loving admonition and good counsel first remembered, I eftsoons
thank you again, because that you considering our great chardge, not for our
pleasure, but for our defense, nor for our gain, but to our great cost, which
we have lately sustained, as well in defense of your and our enemies, as for
the Conquest of that Fortress, which was to this Realm most displeasant and
noisome, and shall be by Gods grace hereafter to our nation most profitable and
pleasant, have freely of your own minds granted to us a certain subsidy here
in an act specified, which verily we take in good part, regarding more your
kindn^sse, then the profit thereof; as he that sets more by your loving
hearts then by your substance: Besides, this hearty kindness I cannot a little
rejoice, when I consider the perfect trust, and confidence, which you have put
in me, as men having undoubted hope, and unfeigned belief in my good doings,
and just proceedings for you, without my desire or request, have committed to
mine order and dispositions, all Chantries, Colleges, Hospitals, and other
places specified, in a certain act, firmly trusting that I will order them to
the glory of God, and the profit of the Commonwealth: Surely if I contrary to
your expectation should suffer the Ministers of the Church to decay, or
Learning, which is so great a Iuell to be minished, or poor and miserable to
be unreleeved, you might say, that I being put in so special a trust, as I am
in this case, were no trusty friend to you, nor charitable to mine, even
Christian, neither a Lover of the public wealth, nor yet one that feared God,
to whom account must be rendered of all our doings; doubt not I pray you, but
your expectation shall be served more godly and goodly, then you will wish or
desire, as hereafter you shall plainly perceive; now, sithence I find such
kindness on your part toward me; I cannot choose, but love and favor you;
affirming, that no Prince in the world more favors his subjects then I do
you, nor no subjects, or Commons more loved and obeyed their Sovereign Lord,
then I perceive you do me; for whose defense my treasure shall not be hidden,
nor if necessity require my person shall not be unadventured; yet although I
wish you, and you wish me to be in this perfect love and concord: This friendly
amity cannot continue, except both you my Lords Temporal, and my Lords
Spiritual; and you my loving subjects study and take pains to amend one
thing, which surely is amiss, and far out of order (to which I must heartily
require you, which is that Charity and Concord is not among you, but disorder
and dissension bears rule in every place. Saint Paul says to the
Corinthians, in the 13. chapter Charity is gentle, Charity is not envious, Charity
is not proud, and so forth, in the said Chapter. Behold then, what Love and
Charity is among you, when the one calls another Heretic, and Anabaptist,
and he calls him again Papist, Hypocrit, and Pharisee; be these tokens of
Charity amongst you, are these signs of fraternate love between you, no, no, I
assure you that this lack of Charity amongst your selves, will be the
hinderance, and asswaging of the fervent love between us, as I said before:
Except this wound be salved, and clearly made whole. I must needs Judge the
fault, and occasion of this discord, to be partly by negligence of you, the
Fathers and Preachers of the spirituality; for if I know a man which lives in
Adultery, I must judge him a lecherous, and a carnal person, if I see a man
boast and brag himself, I cannot but deem him a proud man: I see here daily
that you of the Clergy preach one against another, teach one contrary to
another, envy one against another without Charity or discretion; some be too
stiff in their old Mumpsimus, other be too usie and curious in their new
Sumpsimus: Thus all men almost be in variety and discord, and few or no
preaching truly and sincerely the word of God, according as they ought to do,
shall judge you charitable persons doing this; no, no, I cannot so do: alas,
how can the poor souls live in concords, when you Preachers sow amongst them
in your Sermons debate and discord: of you they look for light, and you bring
them to darkness. Amend these crimes I exhort you, and set out Gods word,
both by true preaching, and good example-giving, or else I whom God has
appointed his Vicar, and high, Minister here, will see these divisions extinct,
and these enormities corrected, according to my very duty, or else I am an
unprofitable servant, and an untrue Officer: although I say the spiritual men
be in some fault, that Charity is not kept amongst you, yet you of the
temporality be not clear and unspotted of malice and envy, for you rail on
Bishops, speak scandalously of Priests, and rebuke and taunt Preachers, both
contrary to good order, and Christian fraternity, if you know surely that a
Bishop or Preacher erreth or teaches perverse doctrine, come and declare it to
some of our Council, or to us, to whom is committed by God the high authority
to reform and order such causes and behaviors, and be not Judges your selves
of your fantastic opinions, and vain expositions: for in such high causes you
may lightly err; and although you be permitted to read Holy Scripture, and to
have the word of God in your mother tongue, you must understand it is licensed
you so to do, only to inform your own consciences, and instruct your
children and family, and not to dispute and make Scripture a railing and
taunting stock against Priest and Preachers, as many light persons do, I am
very sorry to know and hear, how unreverently that most precious Iuell, the
word of God is disputed, rymed, sung and jangled in every Alehouse and
Tavern, contrary to the true meaning and doctrine of the same, and yet I am
even as much sorry, that the Readers of the same follow it in doing it so
faintly, and coldly; for of this I am sure that Charity was never so faint
amongst you, and virtuous and godly living was never less used, nor God
himself amongst Christians was never less reverenced, honored or served,
therefore as I said before, be in Charity one with another, like brother and
brother, love, dread, and fear God, to the which I as your suprem Head, and
Sovereign Lord exhort and require you, and then I doubt not but that love and
league that I speak of in the beginning shall never be discouraged, or broken
between us, ne to the making of Laws which we have now made and concluded: I
exhort you the Makers to be as diligent in putting them in execution, as you
were in making, and furthering of the same: or else your labor shall be in
vain, and your Commonwealth nothing releeved: now to your Petition concerning
our Royal assent to be given to such Acts as has passed both the Houses; they
shall be read openly, that ye may hear them.

FINIS.
