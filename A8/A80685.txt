A COUNTRY SONG, ENTITLED, THE RESTORATION.
I.
COme, come away,
To the Temple and pray,
And sing with a pleasant strain:
The Schismatick's dead,
The Liturgy's read,
And the King enjoyes his own again.
II.
The Vicar is glad,
The Clerk is not sad,
And the Parish cannot refrain,
To leap, and rejoice,
And lift up their voice,
That the King enjoyes his own again.
III.
The Country does bow,
To old Justices now,
That long aside have been lain:
The Bishop's restored,
God is rightly adored,
And the King enjoyes his own again.
IV.
Committee Men fall,
And Majors General,
No more do those Tyrants reign:
There Is no Sequestration,
Nor new Decimation:
For the King enjoyes the Sword again.
V.
The Scholar does look,
With joy on his Book;
Tom whistles and plows amain:
Soldiers plunder no more,
As they did heretofore:
For the King enjoyes the Sword again.
VI.
The Citizens Trade.
The Merchants do Lade,
And send their Ships into Spain:
No Pirates at Sea,
To make them a prey,
For the King enjoyes the Sword again.
VII.
The old Man and Boy,
The Clergy and Lay,
Their joys cannot contain:
It Is better then of late,
With the Church and the State,
Now the King enjoyes the Sword again.
VIII.
Let Us render our praise,
For these happy days,
To God and our Sovereign:
Your drinking give ore,
Swear not as before:
For the King bears not the Sword in vain.
IX.
Fanatics be quiet,
And keep a good Diet,
To cure your crazy brain:
Throw off your disguise,
Go to Church and be wise;
For the King bears not the Sword in vain.
X.
Let Faction and Pride,
Be now laid aside,
That Truth and Peace may reign:
Let every one mend,
And there is an end,
For the King bears not the Sword in vain.
