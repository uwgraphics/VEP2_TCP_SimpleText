For OLIVER Lord CROMWELL.
My Lord,
I Beseech your favorable aspect on a few rude, yet true ensuing lines; which
for truth sake makes me implore your judicious eye; a weightier matter than use
of conscience cannot be, did all consider it, I do, and by the Almighties
assistance, notwithstanding man's power, will not flinch an inch to save my
life: You know you have done things past expectation, yet be pleased to favor
my re-minding you, that there is one above, which to stand in awe of him is
yours, mine, and all true Christians duty: in speaking plain is neither
falsehood nor flattery, nor I hope to your Lordship, therefore I shall be
humbly bold to subscribe my self yours

In all Christian duty, ISAAC GRAYE.
An ensuing perusal of what follows I humbly crave.
To the Christian Reader.
My Intentions,
WIth endeavors to friends, for the delivery of a small Tract ensuing, being
earnest and fervent to have truth take place, and having sought all
opportunities to have the same made apparently known in writing, unto OLIVER
Lord CROMWELL, before publishing in print, according to the usual custom or
manner, by such friends as should have undertaken the business for
presentation: But they upon perusal did find the Dedication was not according
to the Title he now has, or is sir-named by; and did thereupon reply, that it
was in vain to attempt any such thing; for they were certain it would not be
received, because it wanted his title: He now has another company of friends
whom I did endeavor to persuade, as the former they advised me, not to
address my self for they were out of hopes of expectation of good, as to my
relief; and therefore did dissuade me from prosecution thereof; yet finding in
my self a conscientius tie unto the Almighty and eternal JEHOVAH, who is sole
Protector, Justifier, Preserver, and Pleader of the cause of his People against
the enemies, the dark, blind, ignorant powers of the world, that hates to be
reformed, and that I may depart from a lying tongue, do speak in and from
Truth, my Conscience bearing me witness that I cannot call any man by that
name; that is only and alone due to God; neither can I appear as a flatterer,
to give unto that man a title in words, that I cannot own in conscience:
although it may prove to the loss of my business; but I knowing the danger of
flattery, that it is the mouth of flatterers that works ruin to him that is
the flattered; and there upon my Lord, as I tender your everlasting welfare, I
dare do no less than speak the truth in plainness, how ever I be judged,
know, I have discharged my duty in answer to this part of the Scripture, look,
Prove. 16. 28. so in speaking truth I am imboldned through the powerfullest, to
let all such as love Piety and Godliness, know, that as long as I have breath,
or being, I will not cease my continual supplications to him that made me, and
the world to grant my uncessant suite, in the behalf of my self, and of the
whole Nation, that open justice and right may be done to all, and that I lay
open to the worlds view, in a short volume, may by the Almighties blessing
beget many within the Pale of his Church, that too long have sat in darkness,
and the shadow of death; and shall beseech all perusers of the same, so to
estimate my small endeavors, as to cast a favorable and charitable aspect of
the same, and to respect the inward intention, together with the outward
substance, as from a friend:

Owning my self to be any one of yours in brotherly affection, in answer to
righteousness, the persecution whereof has urged me to the Press, that I may
not lay silence buried in the oppressors hell.

YOur Lordship has here presented to your view, Millions of humble
acknowledgements for the reception of an unexpected favor upon solicitation of
precious Christian Friends in and about the City of London, granted to be by
your ever to be Honored self to your poor then suffering supplicant in the
Gate House Westminster, 1653. having remained there many months upon great
charge, yet by your gracious favor was then enlarged and did then enjoy about
a month and odd days Liberty, but ever since April the third 1654. have
again been cast into Woodstreet Counter London, where at present I remain a
Prisoner, questioning not upon your Lordships perusal of these my humble
addresses to find as formerly; your never to be forgotten clemency has
imboldened me the second time to reminde your Lordship for justice and for
right from my illegal, Antichristian, tyrannical imprisonment in the place
aforementioned, wherein I lie and suffer for Christ and a good Conscience, in
that I dare not sin against Right as to pay Tithes, and this by one Budgger of
Bassenburn in the County of Cambridge, Impropriator and Tithe-renter, for which
revenues of Antichrist he has been a cruel persecutor of me, and my Family,
and for some time enforced me for to forsake my poor wife and children, and
relations, and to fly for Scotland unto the Army of the Commonwealth of
England for refuge, that I might have my inward peace in preserving Faith and a
good Conscience for non-payment of Tithes: so through much danger and hazard of
my life, through great and miraculous preservations I returned from thence with
the Army, and came up to Worcester fight, and engaged the enemies there as a
Soldier for Christ and his cause against Antichrist that interest, and when
God had given us the victory there, my life being wonderfully delivered, I
gained leave to go home to my poor distressed wife and family, but because this
bloody antichristian brood of Tithe-mongers, did gape for my Liberty, I was
forced, the time of my staying there, to make a prison of my house; and after I
had been with my Family a certain time, my Adversary Budgger hearing of me at
home, got up a certain company of wicked men by his appointment, and sent them
to take me, and to carry me away to prison, who did violently break into my
house with their swords drawn, and threatening cruelly the destroying of my
life, whereupon I was forced to defend my self with sword and pistol, and make
my retreat into my upper Chambers; but they pursuing me with a great vehement
resolution, and threatening to pull my house down over my head, and to have me
dead or alive, and broke open my stairs foot door upon me, as also to raise the
town; yet through the strength of God in me, and with me, I made a strong
resistance against them for some time, and so came to a Parley with them, in the
mean time my distressed wife gained another sword into her hands, and then made
good the stairs head against them, whilst I forced my pass out at my upper
window, and so I escaped them with my life, through the exceeding goodness of
the Lord, and returned again to the Army: but a while after I was gone to the
Army, another new; a bigger company was again sent by the appointment of my
Adversary Budgger, which forced themselves into my house full of envy, rage,
and malice, to the great astonishment of my poor wife and children, they being
alone at home; and after these raging wretches had rifled and searched my house
to find me and could not, they returned in great heat and fury, and threatening
my poor wife set a naked sword to her breast, using lewd and unsufferable
language to her, still threatening to kill her, if she did not tell them where I
was, but at length when they saw that they could not prevail, they left her in
a very sad condition grievously affrighted, and my poor afflicted children, so
that upon this inhumane bloody usage of theirs, and all for the Whore that sits
upon the cruel beast, my Wife fell into a great fit of sickness, which almost
cost her her life, yet in all the time of her fierce disease and great
calamity, which did aggravate my affliction, I my self durst not so much as to
come home to administer comfort to her: for such snares, (and privy Ambassadors
plots and designs) were laid by these nursed Accomplices, to take me into
their merciless claws, that by the means of these cruel, unjust,
Antichristian persecution for Tithes by the known enemies of Christ and his
people, I have been at last wasted and utterly ruinated in my Families estate,
above the value of four hundred pounds and upwards, by which means I am come
to be much indebted, and have been forced to remain as a banished man from my
Family, and County of my Nativity for some years, and have been, and am still
exposed to great want, and much more misery had fallen upon me had not the mighty
God raised me up Christian Friends, in the Borough of Southwark and City of
London for my relief, when I was cast into Northampton Prison, where I was
committed for my Judgment and Conscience in this Cause of Christ: viz. For
declaring at Wellenborough Market-crosse in Northamptonshire against that
Merchandise of Babylon, that great Prop of Antichrist, the payment of Tithes
and forced maintenance, and for the same I was two several days brought to
Northampton Castle, and tried at the general Sessions of the Peace held there
the first day I being examined upon several interrogatories by Judge Clark,
Judge Parker, and several others, as to the best of my remembrance their names
were so, and little being done the first day against me, they committed me back
again into Ptison, giving the Jailer a strict charge for my safe custody, and
to bring me before him on the morrow, after which accordingly he did, which was
the same day the long sitting old Parliament was turned out of doors; I will
not say for their wickedness or oppression, but leave England to Judge; and on
that day I was also examined upon several interrogatories, the which I
refusing to answer to, they remanded me back to Prison again, saying that I had
committed Treason, yet would they not discover against whom, nor what statute
or Law I had broken, although I often desired of them to know the same, and
without receiving any satisfaction from them; only they asked whether I had
read Littleton or no, Because I alleged that all Statutes or most were made
in relation to Kings: but then being no King, I could be no offender, if it
could have been proved that I had broke a statute: I was by their wills again
ordered to be kept in prison, until the Assizes being to be held in August
following, in the year one thousand six hundred fifty and three, but I then
being a Member of the Army, the Court Marshall who then sat at White Hall, in
the same year were pleased to send a Messenger of their own for me, that they
might hear the cause before them, wherefore I was imprisoned, and have it
before them, so that after I came to London, I did attend them certain days,
though a Prisoner under the custody of the Marshall General, and when their
pleasure was to hear me, I gave them a true Account of my imprisonment in
Northampton, which was by a Justice of peace so called, or rather a Justler of
Peace, who himself was a Tithe-monger, and in regard thereof, without showing
any just cause, sent me to prison, and for the first day of my hearing before
the Court Marshall, notwithstanding that I had given them a full Account of all
my sad sufferings and what distress my wife and poor Family were in by the
aforesaid devoted servants of Antichrist that interest yet some Presbyterians
amongst them, who were none of the least in power and rule, were very much
incensed and imbittered against me, after they had heard me declare why I could
not, nor should not in conscience pay Tithes, so that they also were vexed at
me, and did ask me how the Ministers should live, so giving of them my Answer,
they would not release me that day, but gave a charge to the Marshall to bring
me before him again, in the mean time, my precious Christian friends in the
Borough of Southwark, hearing what hard measure I was like to undergo, did
repair with me the last day of my hearing to the Court Marshall at White Hall,
near about twenty of them, to give in their testimony in my behalf against the
wickedness and evilnesse of paying Tithes, but they might not be permitted to
come into the Court Marshall, although by my self much importuned, and so after
they had examined me ( High Commission Court like) upon several
interrogatories, they consulted among themselves what to do with me; and in the
mean time they commanded me out of the room: And after their large
consultation, I was called in again amongst them, and by the overruling power
of the Presbyterian, or ridgid party amongst them, I was dismissed the Army,
and so through the blessing of God became a freeman again, notwithstanding that
Collonell Pride, and other honored friends and Officers of the Army did then
oppose their proceedings against me, so God knows, for no other cause or crime
was I dismissed but for declaring against Tithes.

By this, my Lord, we may see how men are fallen: For where I did expect to have
had most relief, there I found the most rigor and unkindnesse, yet it was just
with my God so to suffer it, that I might see it no good bottom to trust in
men, or upon deceitful, and uncertain arm of flesh as I had done, whereby I
was deceived, and did too much depart from the living God, whom I have found
since to be my preserver and Protector, blessed be JEHOVAH: Oh that I had been
so guided before, for I was deceived by the flatteries of men in power, and by
their fair and religious pretenses, which have and did deceive me, and many
thousands, and by their not performing their Oaths, Vows, and Covenants, I am
bereaved of my calling, which God did then enable me to follow, being the just
and honest employment and order which God appointed mankind unto us from the
beginning, viz. To till and manure the earth, that it may bring forth fruit
unto his Creation, and this was my righteous calling, and I would their
callings were as righteous that have robbed and imprisoned me, although by the
power of the oppressor I am taken there from, and by the worst of Thieves and
Robbers am destroyed, as my conscience with God bears me witness that they
are enemies to Christ and his Gospel, seeing it is in mere conscience that I
cannot pay Tithes, for if I do, I sin against the Light of knowledge, and so
become an enemy to the truth of the Scripture, and should thereby deny my
Christ to be come in the flesh, and the better hope of the Gospel, which all
they do that either pay Tithes, or take Tithes, as Heb. 7. 12. verse does
witness with me: For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity
a change also of the Law, which is recorded in Deuterenomie 18. 3. verse
pointing out the then Priests portion, and says, what should be their due from
such a people as offered sacrifice, whether of ox or sheep: that they should
give unto the Priest, the shoulder, and the two cheeks also and the maw: 4.
verse, the first fruits, of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thy oil, etc. so
that it does clearly appear that there is a great difference between the
Priesthood under the Ordinance of the Law, and under the Gospel, which did but
figure out Christ to come in the flesh, therefore when Christ the substance was
come, the shadow was done away, as Heb. 9 8. verse. Chap. 10. 1. does witness,
Christ being come an high Priest of good things to come, by a greater and more
perfect Tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building,
ver. 11. 23, 24. Thus it is evident by the Scriptures, and does plainly appear
unto all those who live in obedience to the knowledge of God, and does make the
Scripture their rule to walk by, and do use no hypocrisy, so as to make
Religion a cloak to cover their wickedness, for which if they do not, they can
do no other but witness with me, that to take or pay Tithes, has and does
plainly deny Christ to be come in the flesh, and so do they also that lend
their power to force the payment and maintenance thereof: For our Savior does
testify and says, as by the report of the Scripture, The tree is known by the
fruit, for an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit, neither do men gather
grapes of thorns or figs of thistles: Therefore my Lord, if you be a real
Professor of Christ indeed and in truth it will manifestly appear in your
actions, whilst you have power in your hands you may appear to be for Christ,
for it does clearly appear that such a power that forces the payment of Tithes
is not of God, but is of the Beast, and therefore not to be permitted, and is
of the Army of Antichrist, for they force the shadow or type which was but
figurative to take place of the substance, viz. Christ, and therefore take heed
what you do in siding with, or giving forth your power; for this is the time
that you will show your self either to be a friend or an enemy if an enemy? then
know, you deny Christ, and his Mediatorship, his Redemption, Justification, and
the Resurrection, etc. for Christ says unto all his, if any man will come
after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me, Luke
9. 23, 24, 25, 26. verses: for if we suffer with him we shall also reign with
him, if we deny him he also will deny us, therefore once more, my Lord,
implored, I beseech you well to consider what you do or suffer to be done, now
you are got ^o to be chief Magistrate of the Nation or Nations; will you permit
the permit the people of God in this nation any longer to be thus persecuted
and cruelly used by the means of wicked Laws, or rather lusts of wicked men,
which tyrannically compels and takes away our Liberties, Lives, Estates and
goods, many ways, and amongst others by way of Tithes, and forced maintenance
by Priests, and Impropriators, my hearty desires to Almighty God for you my
Lord, is, that your assistance be not nor subsistence by those oppressors or
oppressing ways which proceeds from those bottomless pit, locusts and
catterpillars of this Commonwealth, viz. The Armies of Antichrist, that lives
by devouring, destroying, and imprisoning the Saints of God; My Lord, if it
must be so that we must pay Tithes against our Conscsences, let there be
storehouses appointed throughout the whole Nation, that the Tithes may there
be kept that the strangers, the fatherless and the Widows may come thither to
be filled within the Priests and Impropriators gates as was in the time of the
Law of Moses, who was Judge of all Israel, and gave forth this Order which he
had received from God which was in the first Covenant a figure of the
everlasting Priesthood, yet for all this know my Lord, if you do, thus, that
the Priests and other Tithe-mongers have storehouses to put Tithes and the
tenth of men's estates into, to fill the strangers, widows, and fatherless
withal, that there may be no beggars in England, though it be a good thing in
it self, yet you do but act according to the figure, and own not Christ come in
the flesh, as I do through grace obtained in the acknowledgement of the truth
of the Scriptures, and of the Priesthood to be changed, and of the everlasting
high Priest over the household of God according to the report of the Scriptures,
and therefore do I suffer, unworthy as I am, as to be a witness, the spoiling
of my goods, and Imprisonment in a joyful Spirit; Ah, my Lord, if you would
but own the report of the truth of the Scripture, you could not but acknowledge
that the Priesthood is changed, and by your Actions you would appear changed
too; for Christ and his Cause which now suffers; Oh then, how would you own
Jesus Christ with his people, who witnesses the end of the Levitical Law and
the end of the Priesthood at whose Name every knee should bow, and every tongue
confess him, for it is he that inlightens every one that comes into the
world, though some hate it and him, and a few love him and his, yet they that
hate him shall one day confess to their shame, and see that their deeds be
evil when they have their reward, for lo, I come, says he, and my reward is
with me, to give to every one according to their works, whether they be good or
evil; he that says so is the Mighty King of Saints and Nations: Now my Lord,
by the favor of truth, give me leave to reason with your Lordship a little
according to the Scriptures: Did you ever read or hear from them that ever any
was cast into prison for his conscience, by those that owned Christ, as I and
others are, and my goods spoiled, and my Family ruinated, and left open to
enemies by those that did own Christ, as I and others are, and their goods
spoiled, and families ruinated; I am sure the Law of God in the rigor of it,
as it was delivered unto Moses, does not witness any such cruelties as I have
undergone, and many in this Nation besides my self, and I am made to suffer for
not paying Tithes, neither does the Law of God witness the taking of treeble
damages, surely, surely, my conscience tells me, and in the discharge
thereof must declare it unto you, that if you will not do justice herein, or
suffer it to be done, so as to take off this murdering oppressing power that
now is for the help of Antichrist, and tyranny which lies upon the people of
God, or cry for vengeance to the Almighty, will ere long be heard arising from
the poor despised, oppressed, and dear people of God in this Land, who are
precious in the sight of heaven; therefore, my Lord, while you have time, and
power is now in your hands, make good your promise, as taking of oppression
from the people of God, together with a new promise, as I am imformed, which by
you was made after the turning out of doors of the late last Parliament to
diverse special friends of the City, to wit, that if tit he were not taken off
the Nation before September were out or fully ended, never trust you more, as I
hope we shall have no such cause to judge of you, but that you will acquit
your self in all; and of all former and hoped not to be forgotten promises, as
at Newmarket Heath, and Triplo Heath, with several other places, what
protestations you made there in the eyes of heaven and earth: Oh, remember,
remember, the days of your then calamity, when you were in great distress,
with the Army of the Common wealth of England, which you were then entrusted
withal, when you and they were in great jeopardy of life, whose General you
then were at Dumbar, and also at Worcester fight, when and where my self with
you was engaged, and at several other places which you may remember, did not we
all there declare for Christ King of his Saints, and have not all your
pretenses then and since as before been to take off oppression tyranny and
absoluteness, and for this very cause expressed, we rest in hope that the
strength of God may cause you to yield obedience so far to deny your self, as
in answer to that blessed Scripture which gives a good report of the words of
our Savior Christ, for I was hungry and ye gave me meat, I was thirsty, and ye
gave me drink naked and ye clothed me, in prison and ye visited me, etc. And
so far as you are found performing the work of the Lord, the answer of the King
to you will be, for as much as you have done it to one of these my Brethren,
you have done it unto me, whose blessed example my desires are unto God for you
that you may follow, so humbly taking leave of you, my Lord, I

Devote my self yours so far as you are Christ's, ISAAC GRAYE.
August the 9th 1654. From my burdedsome, oppressive, illegal, antichrestian,
and tyrannical imprisonment in great Woodstreet Counter, London, the place of
my present captivity.
