WHEREAS at the Jail-deliver for the City of London held in the Old Bailey on
Wednesday the nineteenth day of February in the year of our Lord, One thousand
six hundred and fifty, before the Right Honorable Thomas Andrews Lord Mayor of
the said City of London, and the rest of the Bench then and there sitting. It
appeared unto the said Court (by a Certificate from the Deputy, Common Counsel
men, Churchwardens, and diverse others Inhabitants of the Parish of Sepulchers
without Newgate London, well known, and worthy of good credit) That on Monday
the two and twentieth day of July, in the said year of our Lord, One thousand
six hundred and fifty, about seven of the Clock in the Evening of that day,
there happened a most fierce and lamentable Fire near Holborne-Conduit in the
Parish aforesaid, which within four hours, consumed, and burnt down to the
ground five and twenty dwelling Houses; The Loss whereof, amounts to the Sum
of Two Thousand and five Hundred pounds, as appeared upon a full and particular
view and examination of many able and experienced Workmen. By the means of
which sad Accident Threescore Families are utterly impoverished, and most of
them in extreme Necessity and Misery, and like to perish for want, unless God
in mercy move the hearts of well-disposed people in compassion toward them;
Besides diverse other Houses there adjacent, which were partly burnt and spoiled
to a very great damage and loss, and which are not herein valued, in regard
the Owners thereof are able to bear the same: And the same things were
likewise at the said Court testified by diverse other persons of good worth and
quality then, and there present. For the furtherance of which pious and
charitable Work: The Parliament having been acquainted with the particulars of
the said sad and lamentable Accident, did thereupon the Fifteenth day of August
last, Order, That the said distressed Inhabitants shall be Authorized by
Letters Pattents, under the Great Seal of England to make a general Collection
with the Cities and Counties hereafter mentioned. Know ye therefore, That We
being willing that such relief might be afforded to them herein, as to others
in like cases has been heretofore granted, and not doubting, but that all good
Christians within the said places (having a fellow feeling of their miseries,
will be ready to extend their liberal Contributions toward the Relief,
Help, and Comfort of their distressed Brethren in this their great Necessity)
Have, Given and Granted; And by these Letters Pattents, do Give and Grant unto
the said distressed Inhabitants, and to their Deputy and Deputies, the Bearer
and Bearers hereof, full Power, License, and Authority to ask, gather, receive
and take the Alms and charitable Benevolence of all good and wel-disposed
people Inhabiting within the Cities of London and Westminster, with the Suburbs
and Liberties thereof: And in the Counties of Middlex, Surrey, and Kent, the
Borough of Southwark, the City of Canterbury, and County of the same City, the
City of Rochester, with the Cinque Ports, and all other the Cities, Towns
Corporate, Privileged places, Parishes, Villages, and all other places
whatsoever, within the said Cities, and Counties, and not elsewhere, toward
the recovery of their said losses; And for the Relief, Support, and
Maintenance of the said distressed Families. Wherefore, We Will and Command
you, and every of you, That at such time, and times as the said Inhabitants, or
their said Deputy, or Deputies, the Bearer, or Bearers hereof; shall come and
repair to any of your Churches, Chapels, or any other places, to ask, and
receive the gratuities, and charitable Benevolence of good, and well-disposed
people, quietly to permit, and suffer them so to do, without any manner your
Lets, or Contradictions. And you the said Parsons, Ministers, Lecturers,
Vicars, and Curats, for the better stirring up of charitable Devotions,
deliberately to publish and declare the Tenor of these Letters Pattents, or the
Copy, or Brief hereof unto the people upon some Sabbath day after the same
shall be tendered or delivered unto you, exhorting, and persuading them to
extend their liberal Contributions in so good and charitable a deed. And you
the Overseers of the poor of every Parish where such Collection is to be made
as aforesaid, to collect, and gather the Alms and charitable Benevolence as
well of strangers as Fellow-Parishoners. And what shall be by you so gathered,
to be by the Ministers, and your selves endorsed on the backside of these
Letters Pattents, or the Copy or brief hereof in words at length, and not in
figures. And the Sum and Sums of Money so gathered, and endorsed, to
deliver to the Bearer or Bearers of these Letters Pattents, and to no other
person or persons, whenever you shall be by them thereunto required. And in
case it so fall out that any Parish being destitute of a Minister shall be
without public Assemblies. Then the Overseers of the poor of the said Parish
are hereby required to go from house to house to gather and receive the charity
of the Inhabitants. And lastly, Our Will and Pleasure is, for the more
assurance of faithful, and equal dealing in the Receipt, Account, and
Distribution of the Moneys hereby to be collected, by virtue of these Presents.
That no man shall receive any of the Moneys so collected, but such as shall be
appointed thereunto by Deputation under the hands and seals of Humphrey
Primate, Thomas Poultney, Josias Ward, and Thomas Bradbury, Citizens, or any
two of them, and that the moneys collected and raised by virtue thereof, shall
be distributed amongst such only of those damnified by the said Fire, as are in
this case fit to be relieved by public charity. And by such proportions to
each of them as shall be thought fit, and set down in writing under the hands
of the said persons last above named, or any two of them as aforesaid, at such
times and places as shall be by them, or any two of them from time to time

heretofore made to the contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding. In witness
whereof, We have caused these our Letters to be made Pattents for the space of
Six Months next after the date hereof to endure, and no longer.

of our Lord, One thousand six hundred fifty and three. DAWE.
