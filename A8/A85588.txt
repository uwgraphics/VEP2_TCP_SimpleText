THE Great Earthquake At Quito in Peru Which destroyed a great Number of the
SPAINIARDS IN THE WEST INDIES.
UPon the Twenty day of June Anno Domini One Thousand Six Hundredth Ninty Eight,
There happened a most dreadful Earthquake near Quito, two Mountains opening,
from whence issued a prodigious quantity of Water and black Mud, and overflowed
the Country. The River Ambato and some others, swelled to such a Degree, that
they ruined a great Number of Gradens, Houses and Mills, and drowned much
People and Cattle. The Earthquake was principally felt from Rio Bambo to
Chimbo, and from Quito to Mignel, where it did great mischief: The Town of
Ambato is utterly ruined, and most of the Inhabitants drowned in their Beds:
The Town of Patate 4 Leagues distant was overflowed, but all the People exeept
200 escaped, the Mud having stoped the Water, afforded them time to retire to a
Neighboring Mountain. Tacunga is utterly destroyed, with most of the
Inhabitants; and most of the Churches and Houses of Rio Bambo are overturned,
but all the People, except 40 escaped. Letters also from Popajan of the 10th.
of September last give account, that they had heard terrible Roarings under
Ground, which puts them into a General Consternation, and one of the Volcano's
of Pasto is broke out into dreadful Smoke and Flames, with extraordinary Noise:
