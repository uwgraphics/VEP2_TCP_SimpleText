Englands Captivity Returned, With A Farwell to COMMONWEALTHS.
To the Tune of, The brave Sons of Mars.
portraits of Charles II and (possibly) Oliver Cromwell

COme lets now rejoice,
All with a loud voice,
at the return of charles our King,
With a hearty good prayer,
He may never come there,
where she Traitors his Father did bring
Let us all make a noise,
Both young men and boys,
with a great acclamation of joy
Whilst those Traitors lament,
(But want grace t repent)
which so long did our king annoy.
Farwell a free State,
Such Rascals we hate,
as we here of late days have had,
Such Plots theyd contrive,
When they were alive,
enough for to make us all mad.
But we let them alone,
Which from hence are gone,
cause their reward will be paid them
But leave them where they are,
VVeel neither make or mar,
nor never from thence weel persuade them
My Lord Monck's the man,
Though his life's but a span,
he has improved that little so well,
That in true loyalty,
I can none epsy
that can this great worthy excel.
To bring home our King,
It Was the only thing,
could make all things well for the people,
And such joy for it there was,
As in the streets I did pass,
that the Bells almost leapt out oth' Steeple.

GOod Subjects and they
That loved him did pray
but Rebels did wish the ship

for fear Divine Justice
Should turn them all ore,
When Charles King of England is safe set on shore.
The joy that did ring
Just at his landing
did pierce the high heavens with
GOD save the KING.
the Rocks in an Echo
As loudly did roar,
To see Charles the Second come safely, etc.
The Trumpets did sound
The Cliffes did rebound,
with hands lift to heaven,
And knees on the ground,
they all did give thanks and
True praises good store,
To see Charles the second come, etc.
The Cannons at Dover,
And every rover,
did thunder with joy that
The King was come over,
some Caps were cast up
That they never saw more,
For joy Charles the second was safe, etc.

WHom of your Nobles will do so,
for to main^ain the Commonalty,
Such multitvdes would never grow,
nor be such store of poverty.
I would I had a Milk-maid been,
or born of some more low degree,
Then I might have loved where I like,
and no man could have hindered me.
Or would I were some Yeomans chile,
for to receive my portion now,
According unto my degree,
as other Virgins whom I know.
The highest branch that springs aloft,
needs must be shade the middle tree,
Needs must the shadow of them both,
shadow the third in this degree.
But when the tree is cut and gone,
and from the ground is born away,
The lowest tree that there does stand,
in time may grow as high as they.
Once when I thought to have been Queen
but yet that still I do deny,
I know your grace had right to ^h' Crown
before Elizabeth did die.
You of the eldest Sister came,
I of the second in degree,
The Earl of Hertford of the third,
a man of Royal blood quo^h she.
And so good night my Sovereign Liege,
since in the Tower I must ly,
I hope your Grace will condescend,
that I may have my liberty.
Lady Arebella said our King,
I to your freedom would consent
If you would turn and go to Church,
there to receive the Sacrament.
And so ^^d night Arabella fair,
our King to her replled again,
I will take Counsel of my Nobility,
that you your freedom may obtain.
O^ce more to Prison must I go,
Lady Arabella then did say,
To leave my Love breeds all my (...),
^he which will be my lives decay.
Love is a knot none can unknit,
fancy a liking of the heart,
He whom I love I cannot forget,
though from his presence I must p^
The meanest people enjoy their mates,
but I was born unhappily,
For being crossed by cruel sat,
I want both love and liberty.
But death I hope, will end the strife,
Farewell, f^rewel, dear love quoth (...)
Once had I thought to have been thy wi^

At this sad meeting she had cause,

After that Arabella fair,
