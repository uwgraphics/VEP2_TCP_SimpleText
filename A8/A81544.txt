A DISCOVERY, What God, the supreme judge, Wised. 6. 1 John. 3.
through his servant has caused to be manifested unto the regents or Rulers
in England, concerning their Cain-like, fierce, Habac. 3. Apoc. 16.20. Ierem.
30. Psalm. 89. 1 Cor. 12.
nay Diabolical contentions and furious distractions, by which they bring
themselves with all their land and subjects in utter destruction.

Besides, Gal. 5.16. Esai. 51. Deuteronomy. 32. Psalm. 9: 75 96.97.98
that they have left their distressed fellovv-members and brethren in Germany
stinking in their perdition and misery, which all God will Judge. Romans 1:2.
2. Pet. 3.



Printed in the jeare of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 1643.

In the behalf of God the Supreme Judge, these are directed to the King of
England, and the Parliament.
THe eternal God, Ies 40.66. Psa. 89.95.
to whom chiefly both heaven and earth does belong, does require the King of
England and his Parliament, Ier. 30.
that if they will escape his fierce anger and hot displeasure, Esai. 34. Romans
1. Iesa. 25.29.
they do not so cruelly and tyrannically bring the subjects in their Countries
with their own sweat and blood-monies, Amos 5. Mich. 3. Ephe 4. 2 Timothy 3.
Iesai. 1. Iere. 7. Galat. 5. Ezech. 14. Apoc. 6.20 Matt. 7. Ioh. 10. 2 Thessalonians.
2. Apoc. 16. 2 Cor. 11.
which they by force draw and extort from them, in the ignorance of God, unto
all ruin and perdition, as those insolent, wicked and inconscionable thieves
and murderers in Germany have done, who like dogs have torn and devoured, and
like unto the wild and bruit beasts have killed and destroyed one another, and
then afterward in the behalf of the salvation of their souls, yet trust and
rely upon those ravening wolves and hirelings, by whom Satan, the very Devil,
himself is transformed into an Angel of light.

Behold, God comes as a thief in the night, with the day of vengeance, and
his fiery Judgment upon those who do not spare the very righteous amongst
them.

A DISCOVERY Of the Cain of this present world in his generation, namely, how
the Beast has ascended again out of the pit of darkness. Revel. 17. Whose
Members have forsaked God in their Conscience, after the Communion and
obedience of faith, and being entangled in the vanities of this world, have
separated themselves from one another, and for as much as every one of them will
maintain his vanity and Religion, only after his pleasure, they have taken up
Arms, to destroy and root out one another in a horrible and bloodthirsty way.
THe people of the second, 2 Timothy 4, Rom 14. Eph^s. 2.
or new Testament, should have been taught, not to rule themselfs, and live
only after their own will, but should have suffered the grace of God our Lord
and Savior JESUS CHRIST, Luc. 1.17.
to chastise, rule and reprouve them inwardly in their hearts or consciences:
Tit. 2. Rom, 1. Mat. 24.
but for as much as they have forsaken God in his throne of grace, and are
become vain in their devices, and have like unto those in the days of Noach,
Genes. 6, 7.19. Epist. Iud. 2 Petr. 1:2. Apoc. 17. Matthew. 24. 4 Esdr. 5.19 and
16. Apoc. 6:12. and 16. Iac. 5. Heb. 10. Apoc. 3:16 Gal. 4.5. Ephesians 4.5. These.
5. Ierem. 8.
and Loath, builded up and multiplied themselves, only according to their
flesly old Adamicall will, therefore they have set God behind them secretly
in the ground of their soul, have forgot him, are with the powers of the body
and soul gone forth into the nature: and have for to maintain their liberty
and Religion, begun wars one against another, by which they destroy and
ruin one another, and bring the poor to utter destruction. But when God
comes with his grace, and according to the spirit of filiation knocks on, to
the end, that his children should open their hearts, and enter into their
consciences, and marcke this present and last time, and observe the rights of
the Lord; then comes the ungodly Cain in his generation, or children of
Belial, and will censure God in his judgment, 1 Ioh. 3.5.
makes it worse then his brother in former times, 2 Pet. 3. Genesis 4. Genesis 3.
(who yet fell into the fear of desperation) and Adam, who fain would have been
hid from the face of God. In summa, 2 Pet. 2. 1 Cor. 3.
the Devil has wholly possessed the people in their Sectarian Religion, with
will and insolent deeds; to pass by, 2 Timothy 4.3. 2 Pet. 2. Psalm. 14. Epist.
Judah Apo. 16: 19 Esai. 9. and 13.27.61.63.65.
that their false teachers and prophets besides, do wholly deny and blaspheme
the judgment of God, concerning the redemption of the poor and distressed,
and are the very first of all that stir up men to all wickedness, wherefore
also God shall bruise the head of the old serpent, and execute vengeance upon
his corporal and spiritual ennemies. 2 Thessalonians. 1. Mich. 5.

Epist. Iudae
have seduced the whole world into errors and darkness of conscience, and
brought them away from the narrow way of life, unto the brood way of eternal
damnation in hell, and do chiefly resist the truth. If there were but five
Godly and Righteous men in a Land or Kingdom, like as God sought such at
Sodom and Gomorrha; I leave not of to denounce the right of the Lord, and to
witness of his eternal righteousness, which for to maintain the honor of his
word or holy name shall be manifested as a strong stream. But what Faith, hope
and conscience in this regard God finds and has found in all places
Countries and Kingdoms, upon his eternal infinite Omnipotency, that shall be
plainly discovered and judged, by reason of the confusion and ruin, which the
children of man have brought to pass, which, like unto the mockers and
despisers of God in former times know nothing of his Kingdom, right, judgment
and righteousness, but will only maintain their vain, old, former confused
doings and worldly deeds, with the revenue of the Countries, sweat and
blood-mony of the poor Subjects, from whom they have extorted them. Wherefore
there shall also be a judgment, for the God of Israel lives yet, and his
counsel and thoughts stand for ever, against the doings, counsels, or vain
and idle thoughts of all men: which vain counsels and thoughts are come forth
from themselves, to maintain their divided Sects.

Our God is

Unto the unbelevers, Heb. 10.12 Deuteronomy. 32. Romans 9. Ies. 8.28.
a consuming fire, a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense.

CONCERNING The Cainlike, fierce, bitter, 1 Ioh. 3. Haba 4. Hebr. 10.11, 12.

3. Amos 5. James 5. Esai 5.59. Ierem. 7.22
nay Diabolical revenge-fulnesse of the Heathen, or false Christians, who go
about to thrust God out of the throne of his judgment, and will deprive him of
all power and honor in heaven and on earth, in bringing both Country and
people, viz. the poor Subjects, with their own sweat and blood, into extreme
calamity and utter destruction, and besides defiling the Land with innocent
blood. Ezech. 22.
GOd has now for a long time in all places and Countries beheld the people and
nations of this fourth or last Monarchy of the world, Dan. 2. and 7. Chap. Romans

namely the heathens or false Christians, and that both from heaven above, from
his high and firm throne, and also through his servant David, whom he has
raised of and from among their own selves, by reason of this present misery,
distress and great calamity: who through their designs in every place, have
effected nothing else but kindled the fire upon themselves, and hindered the
redemption (or deliverance) of Israel with the utter destruction of the poor:
all which must yet be judged: for God with his Kingdom, judgment, and
eternal divine Righteousness, will not give place, so much as a hair, to the
Devil in all his members in the whole world, nor yield to them the least from
his own right. But woe unto them, Esai. 8.
or those in the fiery pit of everlasting hellish damnation, who in this cause
oppose themselves against God, Mat. 24. Marc. 13. Rev. 12.16 Es. 34.66. 2 Cor.
5.
and will prevent, nay wholly annihilate the counsel of the Lord: for as every
one does and behaveth himself against God, in regard of these present wars
and commotions, and thereby is the cause, and guilty of the destruction of
mankind; so accordingly he shall be rewarded both here in time, and there in
eternity: which no shephard, false teacher 2. Petr. 2. or prophet can hinder,
or shall be able to remedy in any way. Actor. 20. Mat. 7.23. Ioh. 10. 2 Timothy 3.
Es. 28.57. Ezech. 13. Epist. Iudae
For those horrible ravening wolves and hirelings, who have seduced the people
to such insolent prevarication against God, and moreover do absolve them in
their presumptuous persevering sins and damnable courses, and strengthen the
hands of the impenitent and wicked ones, thus turning the grace of our God into
lasciviousnes and insolence: 2 Petr. 2. Zeph. 3.
Those, I say, shall principally above all be sent to hell, and the everlasting
darkness, by reason of the destruction, Marc. 11.13. Lucc 19. Iere. 7. Iere.
23. Ezech. 13.
Matt. 21.24. which now for a time has been caused and brought to pass in all
places and Countries in the murdering den of this false Christendom,
through the hypocrisy and lies of such unclean spirits, frogs and spirits of
the Devil.

The whore of Babylon must indeed be destroyed before the end of the world,
Rev. 16.
but it must not be done otherwise, then by, Rev. 17.18 Ps. 89: 97.119. Gala.
5. Romans 8. Ioh. 8.10. Ier. 7.8. Mat. 12.21 Marc 3.12
and according to the before determined counsel of the Lord, namely, according
to his justice, judgment and everlasting divine righteousness, which
especially the people of the second, or new Testament, ought in the spirit, and
through Faith to have waited and hoped for, and in no wise so as the Jews did
when their King came, whose life they sought above all others, in regard of
their outward Temple worship and false Religion. Lucc 6.11.19. 2. Petr. 3.
Epist. Iudae Matt. 13. Deuteronomy. 32. Psalm. 94. Romans 1.2. Pet. 2. Esai. 1. Ier.
7.11.15.17.
Therefore a fiery judgment is before the door, by reason of the mockers and
despisers, who in this regard will not only hinder the harvest of the Lord,
but endeavor also wholly to annihilate and abolish it, by entrenching upon the
vengeance belonging to God, and going about to maintain, protect and defend
their vain worldly Sectarian courses and Religions. Whereby they do but
kindle the fire in the wrath of God, upon themselves, Esdr. 15.16.

Those heathens or false Christians, Marc. 13. Gal. 4.5. Romans 9. James 4. Matt.
24. Luc. 17. Romans 1. Esai. 1.5.30. Ezech. 7.21 Levit. 26. Revel. 9.13 16.19.20.
Luc. 19. Genes. 19. Epist. Iudae Ezech. 16. 2 Pet. 2. Gal. 5. Psalm. 12. Ierem.

Mich. 3.6. Ier. 46.50. Esa. 30 31. Amos 5.
who as concerning the spirit of grace and adoption (or childship) of JESUS
CHRIST, within their hearts or consciences, are not other wise subject and
obedient to God, then those in the times of Noah and Loath were, and will
protect themselves in their vain and wicked courses, without the counsel of
the Lord, and against God and his spirit endeavor to set themselves at
liberty, those I say must be ruined through their own enemies, and subjected
to the Devil and all wild beasts, which God shall raise and stir up against
them, and they shall have at last as little deliverance from the everlasting
hellish damnation, as in former times the Jews in the horrible destruction of
Jerusalem; and those at Sodom and Gomorrha, whom God also ever for their own
Resractarinesse was forced to destroy with fire and brimstone from heaven. For
God will not have the Sectarian contentions and bytings, the hypocritical and
Schismatical doings of the shephards, by which there is no light, no faith, no
love, no uprightness nor righteousness any more left, within the hearts of
these men, maintained and defended in this fierce and Cainlike manner, with
rage and fury, murderings and bloodsheddings, of the poor innocent souls,
which now also for a time has been plainly seen and known, by lively
experience, namely, how God has thrown down one tyrant through the other,
and brought a desolation upon the Champious and strong-ones. Deuteronomy. 32. Esai.
12. Romans 12. Psa. 10.94. Habac. 3. James 5. Amos 3.5.8. Psalm 33.76.93.


Those that go about to deprive God of his honor and vengeance, and entrench
upon his judgment against their enemies, do first and foremost, burden
themselves with great unquietness, trouble and labor in vain to no purpose.
Secondly they bring their contry, people and subjects with their revenus,
sweat and blood into utter ruin: and then thirdly and consequently (which is
the worst, greatest and heavest of all) they presume to alter or pervert the
eternal counsel of God: Esai 30.33 1 Thessalonians. 5. 1 Corint. 3.6.11. Hagg. 2.
and thus will utterly abolish the gouvernement of God in heaven and on earth,
especialy within their own conscience, and also outwardly amongst themselves:
Wisd. 6.12.
all which the same God, who in former times has thrown down the Thrones and
Seats of Kingdoms, will not suffer. Esai. 49.


A Servant of the Lord Servinge God in his justice and judgment.
Psalm. 17.18.
