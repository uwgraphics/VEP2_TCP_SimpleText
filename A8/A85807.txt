A brief discovery of that which is called the Popish Religion, with a word to
the Inquisition, discovering their seat of Injustice and Cruelty, and also a
word to them who are in Bondage under this deceit, that upholdeth the Beasts
worship.
FRIENDS,
Mind the light of Christ Jesus, him, by whom the world was made, who will
lead you to righteousness, and holiness, in him there is no strife, nor no
debate; you are guided by the Prince of the Air, who leads to iniquity, and
all manner of abomination against the Lord and his anointed; your imitation,
and false worship lies in the fall of Adam, your guide is the Serpent full of
subtilty, and invention, and pride, covetousness, and all manner of evil is
exalted in you; your fruits are the deeds or darkness out of the right of
Jesus; bring your deeds to the light, let that judge your ways and practices,
whether they are wrought in God yea or nay. God is the guide of all them that
fear him, he leads unto righteousness; but your ways are deceit, and
abomination, they are wrought by Magic art, the Magicians of Egypt imitated
Moses, who had the power of God, by the Devil were the^ guided to work by
subtilty for their glory, but that glory had an end, and so will yours in time,
the Lords hand is against your deceit, your abominable pride and wickedness
which stands in your deceit, you are deceivers of souls for your own
advantage, you seek the fleece and starve the flock, by this your magic
authority and conjuration, which you have gathered in by the Prince of the air;
the Devil is your God whom you serve, he was a deceiver from the beginning, by
him you are led to deceive the people of their eternal happiness to be led by
your conjuration, and your Necromancy, The Prince of the air leads you to
airy imaginations without substance, Christ is the substance, and him you know
not to be your guide, you are guided by another, the Harlot is your guide, the
well favored Harlot decking her self, making of Images, and painting of
likenesses of things without substance; the substance of all you know not, the
light of Jesus is a stranger to your wicked minds, who are bent against God,
and his ways you despise, and cast them behind your backs; you are the painted
whore in this your practice. The Devil is your Head, and Christ the Head you
know not, the Lamb of Innocence you never knew to be the light of the world,
who leads to plainness, and honesty, your comfort is in this life, you know no
other but that which leads to pride, and all manner of abomination,
covetousness is your root, it is the root of evil, by which the Canker enters,
it has corrupted your hearts, and minds, and made you subject to the Devil,
who is a Master, and Lord over you; you are his servants whom ye obey; your
Idol Gods in them you live, and have your being, your being is in this life,
you know no other, nor no better: Pride is exalted in you, you know not him
that leads out of the world, nor out of the things of the world, for your being
is in them; your being is in the dust among the Serpents and beasts, and
ravenous Wolves, and with them you do feed in the wilderness of destruction:
destruction is your end, if you do not repent and serve the living God, who
leads out of all babels, and trifels, pleasing the mind with the fruitless
works of darkness, your pictures, and Images, and your praying to Saints, and
worshipping your dumb Gods, which cannot answer, the true God you do not know
that leads out of the world, he is unchangeable, your God changes; but our
God lives for ever whom we serve, he dies not, the God of Heaven is our Lord,
and Lawgiver, and our Head, and no other do we own but Christ Jesus the Son
of God, he leads out of all things that are visible, he is invisible to the
carnal eye, no man can see his face, and live, it is death to the carnal: to
know God is life eternal, all carnal things must dye, and have an end, your
Pope is carnal, and wicked and abominable before the Lord, and an exalted
bubble is he whom you call your Head: of that which you call your Church, it
is but bables and an invention of the Devil, and by him are you guided to
exalt one another, and to make you a God like your selves, Christs-Vicar you do
call him, where have you learnt that word, or from whence did it come, can ye
tell? it is deceit, that is your guide; you plead antiquity, but the ancient of
days shall judge you all, and all your gathering without God; subtilty, and
deceit has upheld your vain titles of Monks, Friars, and other Orders gathered
in by your imaginations: who led you to these things? did the Spirit of God,
yea, or no; or by tradition of them, whom you call your ancient Fathers?
Fathers they were of iniquity, Authors of evil like your selves; by the Devil
are you guided to follow tradition, knowing not the Spirit which leads to life,
all your practice is in death, it does not renew your minds, nor change the
heart to become holy; for you are desperately wicked, and murderers, and
thieves, and Idolaters, you have stolen your Religion as you call it, out of the
pit it came, and into the pit it shall return, any one that comes in any other
way, but by Christ Jesus are thieves and Robbers, Whoremongers, and Adulterers
God will judge, your Harlotting is known to the Lord, who is the Judge of all
Judges, your deceit gathered in by the Counsel of the wicked one (who is your
foundation) by him you are guided to practice that, which neither Apostles, nor
Prophets did, and yet you say your Pope is Peter's successor; where do you read
in the Scripture, that Peter sat in a Chair with a triple Crown upon his Head?
did not the Apostles freely Preach the word of the Lord without money, or any
advantage to themselves; the glory of the world by them was denied, they feared
not their lives to the death, they gave all their substance to the poor; now
learn to know the power, the poor in Spirit shall see God and live for ever;
but you are exalted above the light, that which discovers sin, the light of
Jesus, who enlightens all men into the world, it shows your evil deeds of
darkness, acted out of the life of Jesus, your life is death, and death is your
end, and that end leads to self, to be selfly minded, it is death, for self
is carnal and devilish, did ever you read in the Scriptures your practice,
which you have amongst you? did ever Apostles and Prophets do the same, which
you do? did they ever seek themselves, or self advantage for the glory of the
world, which lies in death? let the righteous in you judge your conscience, I
mean where Christ has placed his witness, Christ Jesus has a witness in you
all, and that shall be your Judge at the latter day: where God is known to be:
that is perfect, and that delayeth not time, he calls for repentance by it,
which discovers sin, and lets you know when you have done amiss, it is Gods
witness in every one which shows them their evil deeds, and when they commit
sin, this judges: now turn to this that it may lead you to life, and peace; but
no peace to the wicked, they shall dye without mercy; now consider whether your
deeds are done in the Spirit, or in the flesh; If by the Spirit of God you are
guided, then would you not appear in these practices, you sit like Kings and
Princes Lording over the just by your own invention, and not by Gods direction,
or by any example of those that fear the Lord: those that fear the Lord are
innocent, and harmless like God: there are but two Spirits of God, and of the
devil, now mind by which you are guided, and by which Spirit you receive this
authority, which you practice, does the Spirit of God lead to murder? let the
light judge, or did ever Christ Jesus show any such example? or did he give
you any authority to murder men, that be not of your minds? the Inquisition
you call your selves, enquiring of that which you need not, busying your
selves, and Lording it over other men's consciences, your own practice you never
consider from whence it came, nor whether it shall go; for to the pit must all
that is exalted be turned; your Idols cannot save you, the day of your
visitation is come; turn unto the Lord all you exalted bubbles, and let the
light judge your ways, whether they be wrought in God yea or nay; did ever
Christ Jesus the son of the living God command these things, which you do? did
ever the Lord of life show an example to murder? his Spirit leads to
suffering, through him that makes vvilling, and not to persecution, that is
your seat to destroy the innocent, the Lord is pressed under your abominations,
you trample up on the just one that discovers sin, sin is the enemy of your
souls, and the Lord is a friend to all that fear and keep his commandments,
this commandment do I leave among you (says Christ Jesus) that ye love one
another, and love is the fulfilling of the Law of God, but where is your love
to kill your Brother, Cains nature dvvells in you, and you are by that Spirit
guided, which slaies the Just, you offer up sacrifice to the Devil, your
sacrifice, and you are one, and he is one with you that leads you to it; what
think you that a dead babble can save your souls, it you call your Savior, that
you make with your hands; you make you a God, and when you have made it you
eat it, this corrupts with you; corruptible things are not known to those that
live in the Spirit, but in the place where they are to be used, and when, and
how by the wisdom of God, as food for the body, as God in his wisdom has
ordered them to be used, as wine, and strong drink, as Paul writ to Timothy,
as useful for the body, and not for the soul. The Spirit feeds on things not
seen with a Carnal eye, by the Spirit were they guided to use every thing in
its place, by this Spirit is Nations redeemed, and Kingdoms brought to naught.
Hell is their Portion that knows not that which redeemeth: God redeemeth from
sin, but you dwell in sin, and are dead; And yet you say you eat God. He that
feeds on me says Christ Jesus shall live for ever. My flesh is meat indeed,
and my Blood is drink indeed, but not Carnal as you ^ay, for God is a Spirit,
and no flesh enters that Kingdom, neither can Man by his Spirit know what it
is. Man by his wisdom knows not God, neither can they comprehend his being:
for his being is not Carnal, but you are Carnal, Sensuail, and Devilish, and
the Diveil has beguiled you, for the destruction of your souls, to enlarge his
Kingdom, his Kingdom is enlarged by the children of disobedience,
disobedience entered by Adams fall when he eat the forbidden fruit, contrary to
the mind of God. God is righteous and he leads to righteousness, peace and pure
holiness, and holiness becomes his House for ever: Now where is this House can
ye tell, when you make your Idol Temples a shelter for murderers, and thieves.
Thieves you are to deceive the people, and lead the blind to their destruction:
Destitute you are of God, when you say you will sacrifice for sin, and your
hands are full of blood, it is not your washing with water can save you from
sin, it is the blood of Jesus that cleanses, this blood is not Wine to drink
in Bouls, as do the Drunkards so do you: You cannot worship him whom you know
not in all your outward imitation. And all your Ceremonies, your Copes, and
Surpl^sses, and Miters, and Crowns, and Crosses, that are made of wood: and
your painted flaggs deceiving the people, and making them follow you up and
down Towns and Cities, and call this a procession, it is a procession indeed,
for the Devil has possessed you to make Images like unto himself. Images and
Likenesses is your Religion, as you call it: but he that seems to be Religious,
let him bridle his tongue, but your tongues are at liberty to sing, and pray,
and imitate: how can he pray or preach that is not sent; he that is sent, is
born of God, can this birth you witness? Christ came into the World by the will
of his Father and whatsoever he see the Father do, that did he also. When did
you see God to receive this authority, your authority is from your Father the
Devil, and his Servants ye are whom ye do obey: Obey the Lord, turn to the
Light of Jesus that leads to a holy Life, and an innocent habitation, out of
all subtlety; You do feed your Colleges with Philosophy, which is not the
Doctrine of Christ, but the Doctrine of Devils. Paul speaks, Teach not vain
Philosophy, no Traditions of man; for man in his wisdom knows not God, neither
is he known of God, for God is a Judge of deceit, and his judgments true and
just. And the just God will be avenged of his enemies, yea, the eternal God
will call you to account for your Stewardship. He has given to every man a
Talent to improve, and the unprofitable Servant shall be cast into the Lake,
where shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, out of Hell there is
no Redemption. Purgatory (say you) is a place of purging and cleansing by fire,
the fire of God is a cleanser, he burns up the wicked, and brings sinners
to repentance; how can you be cleansed from sin without the blood of Jesus: he
is not divided from the Father; I and my Father are one says Christ, and he
that dwells in God, dwells in Love. where is your Love to one another, you sell
the innocent for money, ye make the righteousness of Christ of no effect in
your account, when you say you can redeem Souls for money, Money is your
portion and your reward; Your plagues shall be doubled, yea verily, your
plagues shall be doubled, for your Life is deceit, and abomination before the
Lord; For ever are you condemned if you do not repent, and turn unto the Lord,
and his light mind, that you may see where you are, and what you do: that all
things may be known to be the fruits of darkness, which is not wrought in God.
God is a worker of wonders, in the hearts of them who dread his presence, and
tremble at his word; his word you know not, neither do you regard it: and yet
you say you work wonders, where are your wonders? do you know that that leads
to righteousness, and holiness, and cleanses the heart from corruption: your
hearts are corrupted in wickedness, and yet you say you work wonders and
miracles. It is a miracle to change from death to life: but where have you
changed any. Are not you desperately wicked? when you tolerate, and allow of
murder, and make your Steeple Houses a refuge for murder, and you call it the
Sanctuary of God, and say that it is a holy place, where is the place that is
holy says the Lord? You have builded Temples, and worshipped Idols: you are
Liars, you worship a Den of thieves. You have stolen your Prerogative from the
Devil the father of lies, and you are subject to him, who is a Prince of
darkness. Darkness has possessed your hearts, you have stolen a practice from
the Devil, and you set it up in the stead of innocence, for subtlety is your
order: you have no other thing to preserve you but subtlety and deceit; to
deceive the people in telling them you are their Fathers, and that you can
forgive sins. There is but one Father, and one God, and he is from everlasting
to everlasting World without end, The God of Heaven is a Father indeed, he
saves his people from sin, but sin is your Author, and your finisher of your
end. In sin you live, and in sin you dye; Where is your Father whom you serve?
do you not serve your lusts, and your filthy desires in all things, which your
minds run after; and flattering your selves that you are holy, and calling your
selves holy men: the holy men of old did so as you do, ruling as Kings by your
Authority, which you have received from the Devil, whose Dominion is strife
and debate: and the Spirit of God leads to peace, and to an oneness. The Father
and the Son are but one, and he that knows the Father knows the Son also,
with you it is not so: you know not one another, but as bruit beasts in
fighting, quarreling one with another, one Nation with another, and one
Kingdom with another: this is your fruits of your Religion, as you call it.
You have a name to live, but are dead while you live, for your deeds make you
manifest from whence you came, and what you are, and whether you go, and what
you do; your practices are abomination to the Lord, and yet you say you have
unity and an oneness amongst you, in that which you call your Church, and yet
you cannot reconcile your members one to another. For the Church, as you call
it, has seven Heads, which you compare to seven Hills, and these Hills you say
give light to the Nations; How comes it then that Nations are drunk with
wickedness, he that is drunk, is drunk in the night, day makes your deeds
mannifest. Yea, that innocent Lamb discovers your subtlery, and your deceit,
deceiving the Nations and Kingdoms, and exalting your selves above all that is
called God; Your names are an abomination to those that fear the Lord: Turn to
the light of Jesus, that a new name you may witness by renewing of your minds,
that light leads to a new Life, out of the old world which has poisoned, and
has deceived many Nations, the World of sin, which has been exalted in your
hearts. Behold a new Heaven and a new Earth is spoken of, but what is this to
you, for you know it not, you live in the old World, and yet you say you are
Churchmen; Christ's Church is pure, even like himself, as clear as Crystal is
his body, and his members is not divided, you are divided, you fight, and kill
one another, and destroy your souls through wickedness, and injustice, Is this
Justice think you to be a manslayer, and kill them that will not yield and
become subject to your abominations? abominable is your practice and your
deceit; you are grand deceivers this many hundred years, but now is the Lord
appearing to lay open your deceit, your nakedness shall appear even as it is,
you can no longer be hidden, for the lightness of your Sun discovers deeds of
darkness: what think you of this, can you forgive sin, yea, or no? from whence
did you receive this authority, and are sinners your se^ves, and yet you say
you have received this authority from the Pope, and the Pope from Peter (say
you) but you are liars, and the truth is not in you. Peter usurpt no such
authority, he was subject to the Lord and to his Commandments, and his faith
was grounded upon Jesus, the Rock of ages, and that faith saves from sin; he
that has faith becomes pure, as God is pure, and he is pure indeed: and yet
you say you have the Keys of Heaven, and of Hell, and do say that this
authority is left by Peter; but you are liars, and the truth is not in you. A
chief Bishop is your Pope as you call him, Christ head on the earth say you:
has Christ two deads, yea or nay? Is Christ divided, what think you? How can
this be? Christ is the Son of God, he has no carnal Members, nor no earthly
Crown, although your Pope has three, you account him your chief Bishop: he is
a covetous man like your selves: in pride you exalt one another, covetou^ness
is your Root, it is the Root of all evil, it upholds pride, and pride
upholdeth the Devils kingdom; you are proud, and covetous men, se^fly minded,
and seek nothing but self in all your practices, you care not how wicked the
people be, so they put into your mouths, and feed your corrupt desires with
filthy lucre; gain to the flesh is your end; you have no other design but to
exalt your selves, and to be exalted, and live like Kings, it is but usurpt
authority; by the Devil are you led, a deceiver from the beginning was he, a
subtle Serpent, and his seed are you who seek the fleece and starve the flock,
and call your serves sheapheards; Christ Jesus is the true Shepherd, he gives
his life for his sheep, he is a redeemer, and saves his people from their sin.
How do you think to be saved? By a carnal bit of Bread that you call the Body
of Christ, Impudent blasphemers, who make an Idol to your selves and eat it,
and say that it is Christ's flesh, and the wine that you drink in Bowls is his
Blood; he that eats my flesh, says Christ, shall live for ever: and you dye
and your God with you, and this is an end of your dumb Idol which cannot save
you. God is a Savior of his people from sin; they that feed on that Spirit
which leads out of carnal things; to be carnal minded is death, to be
spiritual minded is life and peace, no peace to the wicked, they shall dye
without mercy, and judgment shall fall upon them that forget God. God is
judge of all, he is judged of none; nor none can know his judgments but by
that Spirit, which is pure; you make your selves Judges, and Rulers, by an
usurpt authority, you have received from the Devil the Father of lies, and by
a lie are you upheld in your enchantments, and Conjuration, airy minded men, by
that Climate are you guided, airy substance, Clouds without water, broken
Cisterns that cannot hold water, exalted Jezabel, painting your faces with
colors, Dives like you be sitting at your table feeding on dainty dishes,
fitting your selves to the slaughter through your abomination, which is
exalted above all, that is called God, God is pressed under your abomination,
the righteous groaneth for redemption, but you hear not the Cry of the poor;
the poor in Spirit shall see God, and live for ever, and the rich shall be sent
empty away, away with all your vain bables, your im^ges and likenesses of
wood, and stone, and crosses. Learn to know the Cross of Christ, it will teach
you to know God; desire to know Christ crucified in the flesh, your sins
subdued by him that suffers in you, The Lamb of life leads to Innocence out
of all inventions of man, out of all carnal things it will you lead, if it you
mind, which discovers sin, it will dissolve your enemies by the brightness of
his coming, if you desire to know God, mind his witness, it will lead you out
of visible things, and your carnal desires shall be dissolved. If you mind
this witness which leads to truth, the liars mouth shall be stopped, the issue of
iniquity shall be dried up, by the brightness o^ the Sun shall the fountains of
the earth be dried up, and the Spring shall be stopped wherein iniquity does
ab^und.

Abundance of iniquities has the world gathered into her self, yea the men of
the world calls her mother, through the abundance of her delicates; she has
deceived the Nations and Kingdoms throughout the Earth: the mystery of
iniquity has been exalted, exalted bubbles have borne the sway upon the
earth, and the innocent has been forgotten. God has not been known to them,
they have forgot his ways, followed the fruits of darkness, and darkness has
possessed the heart of man, man has been led from the light of Jesus by the
grand enemy of his soul the Devil, who from the beginning has misled man
through lust, and desire of the flesh, which cannot ever be satisfied from one
invention to another, an invention of the Devil is this, which you call your
Religion, a humane invention mixed with lust, filth, and deceit, is not this
deceit to weary the people with your bables, and your inventions of Beads,
Crucifixes, and other enchantments, which your airy minds have gathered in?
even plain Sodomites do you show your selves, studying iniquity against the
Lord, and his anointed, the holy one of Israel is he called, a name that is
unknown by you: he is a good Israelite indeed, in him there is no guile, and
they that are guided by that Spirit are like unto him kept in innocence, and in
that house there is no guile, where innocence dwells righteousness does
flourish, and plenteous redemption to those that fear the Lord: redeemed are
they from the earth that mind the light of Jesus, by it to be guided, it
leads from all manner of evil to serve the living God of life, light and
power, powerful is he that redeemeth from death to life. This redemption is
not of corruptible things, that corrupt, and die of themselves; he cleanses
the body and washes from dead works to everlasting life world without end: An
end shall be put to all your bables and inventions made by the works of your
hands; your Crucifixes, say you, puts you in mind of Christ's death, remember he
is slain in you, in spiritual Sodom, and Egypt are the two witnesses flain,
their Blood shall be required of the children of disobedience, disobedient are
you that forget God; as a blossom shall you wither, and all your glory which
you have received from the Author the Devil. The ground of iniquity is highly
exalted among you, who know not God, neither regard ye his ways, nor bring
your deeds to the light, your acting is in the dark, where light is not seen,
the fruits of darkness does appear, in all your practices is not the living God
known to be your guide, he leads out of all unrighteousness up to know God in
that Heavenly City; where God dwells there is no unrighteousness, nor no unclean
thing can there enter, as clear as the Sun at Noon Day is the Lord in his
glory, his glory exceeds all flesh, it shall wither before the Lord, and be
cut down even as grass, like stubble shall the fire of the Lord consume his
enemies, and all that is exalted above the innocent own the Lamb of life, the
life of the righteous is death to the man of sin, therefore turn to the Lord,
that your wickedness may be forgiven, and fear him that cleanses the heart,
and makes glad the mind, and renews the life, and turns from darkness to
light to serve the living God, the living praise the Lord, yea the living
praise his name for ever; never can you praise God in that nature you stand in.
Turn to the light of Christ, it will lead you to another Kingdom, which you
know not, to know God is life eternal, and this life is the light of the
world. Every man has a talent given him, it is the light of Jesus that
discovers good from evil, it shows you when you do amiss, it is the check of
your conscience, that tells you, you should not lie, nor swear, nor deal fa^sly
bring all your deeds to this, it does not flatter, it is your friend, it leads
to eternal happiness, and that is durable riches, which the world cannot give:
the worlds, treasure is but vanity, and a lie, by a lie are the Kingdoms of the
earth upheld in their vain concupiscence: long, yea long has the heritage of
the Lord laid waste. I pity your souls that lie in darkness, you see not the
light which does not change; all is changeable under the Sun, the Son of
righteousness never changes; your light changes, and burns out your Lamps, and
Candles in your Synagogues of Satan, and you ^ight them again to beautify, and
adorn the place of your lust, where your life stands; what glory is this to the
Lord? and what does it advantage you to do these things, God never required?
when did God require any of these things at your hands? as for going into
Cloisters, or Monasteries, do you hear any such names in Scripture for Saints
to lodge in? their habitation was in the Lord, and not in earthly Houses; their
habitaiton is a House without hands, a building of God; and God is the Author
of that practice which the Saints follow, no other Author have we but the Lord,
he is our Lord and Law giver; you have Lords many, and Laws many, and as you
make them, you break them your selves; you say you should not murder, nor
steal, nor commit adultery, and you your selves are adulterated from God; you
have committed fornication with the Scarlet colored Whore, and drunken the Cup
of her Abomination, is not this murdering of the just one, which is a friend
to all, and would not the death of any. You have no pity to your own souls,
you lie in your Blood, and do not see, the God of the world has blinded the
eye, the Eternal eye of God dis^overs all your abominations, which are
gathered in by your subtle minds, and inventions imitating, and practizing by
tradition; thus has one generation deceived another. Many Authors have you for
your traditions, all from one Root, and the Root is evil. As for Augustins,
Jesuits, and Caputians, when did the Lord by his Spirit guide you to these
names? there is but one name to be saved by, and that name leads out of all
names, the Lord gives a new name, and a white stone to his people, and none
knows it but they that have it; you change your names from one name to another,
but where is the life that leads to salvation? that you know not; you cannot
witness a change by the power of God from your evil ways: and what does it
advantage, for you to change your names? How vain is this? how naked is your
conditions before the Lord, you cannot be hidden any longer. Light is come into
the world and men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are
evil, now will the Lord appear in the children of light to discover all your
abominations, and your deeds to be evil. Evil minded men you are, who deny
the Lord to be the Author and finisher of your faith; he that has faith as a
grain of mustard seed removes mountains, mountains of sin I mean, which has
been exalted above the Lord and his anointed: you anoint your Priests with Oil
to imitate Aaron, where is the fruits of this anointing? the anointed of the
Lord is pure; purity, and peace becomes his House for ever; where is this
House witnessed by you? Are not your minds corrupted with dumb Idols? And
self-inventions, and your Gods is like unto your dead, and dumb Idols is your
hearts addicted too; you mind not the living God, that quickneth, and raises
from death to life, from the power of Satan to serve the living God; your
prayers, and inventions is all in the fall, it is Cains sacrifice; all your
worship is abomination unto the Lord, you act it in the old nature, which is
enmity against God, out of the light of Jesus; do you busy your minds praying
to Mary, and making of Images, and likenesses, you are not: you worship the
works of your hands, by vain tradition have you been led, from one generation
to another have you lived in Idleness and sloth, not knowing the Cross of
Christ that Crucifies sin; your Crosses of wood and stone cannot save you, nor
redeem you from your vain conversation, you bow to your Cross and rise again as
wicked, and carnal as ever? the Cross of Jesus is not so, it teaches to deny
self, selfly minded men cannot please God, neither can they in all their
imitation perform the mind of God, in that, which stands in the old nature,
all must be destroyed, all your inventions come down to the light of Jesus
which shines in a dark place, dark is the heart of man, a light has God placed
therein, bring your deeds to it; there your fruits may be made manifest,
whether they are wrought in God yea or nay; did God ever require? or when did
you hear his voice? that you say you are guided by his Spirit, and you say the
true Church cannot err. This is true the Church of Christ cannot err, who are
guided by his eternal Spirit, his Spirit you never knew to guide your minds,
and to lead you to these practices, as worshipping Images: you deny the
resurrection of Jesus, you serve your lusts, and your Popes Invention, by his
Articles you are guided to deprive Kings of their authority, and sit in the
seat of Justice as you call it. If you were spiritual there things need not
concern you; you are usurpers in all your practices, you say that which you
call your Church is above the Law; it is above the Law indeed, you neither fear
God, nor man; you are Lawless livers to make your Churches (as you call them) a
preservation for murd^rers; he that sheds man's Blood, by man shall his Blood be
shed. All manner of evil do you uphold for money, murderers, and adulterers,
and say you can for give them; did you ever read in the Scriptures that ever
pardons were sold for money? where is your example for these things? why do you
hide the Scripture from the people? or by what authority? were they not given
forth by the Spirit of God for generations to come? God excludes none all that
will come, may, and drink of the water of life freely, free is that Spirit that
leads to righteousness, it straitens none that will believe, and turn to the
Lord. Come all ye that are heavy laden, says the Lord, and I will give you
ease, he burdneth none, his yoke is easy, and his burden light unto all them,
that desire to live with him; he is a cherisher of the innocent, and a
destroyer of deceit, deceit has gathered into your hearts swift destruction to
your souls, if you repent not; repent and turn to the Lord that your evil
deeds may be forgiven, come near unto the Lord by the light of Jesus which
shines in darkness, the heart of man is dark, it comprehends not the light;
but the light of Jesus comprehends you all, and discovers your deeds to be
evil, and all your practices abomination to the Lord; repent, and turn in
sin, for now is the Lord a going ^o reckon with the ends of the earth; your
glory shall be laid in the cust, dust is the Serpents food, food for Devils,
and not for men; learn to feed on the substance, which is Christ Jesus, which
leads out of all, that is visible up to him by whom the world was made. In
the beginning was the word, and the word was God, and dwelt among men; man has
turned his back off the light, he is fallen from innocence, by subtilty has he
been led to the destruction of his soul. The light of Jesus shows you this;
that your enemy is sin, and leads to a desolate habitation, which is not in
God. God is a finisher of faith, and the Author of righteousness, peace and
pure holiness. The Devil he is the Author of sin, he was a liar from the
beginning, and by a lie are you led to disobey the Lord of life. The living
praise the Lord, yea, the living praise the Lord for ever and ever; never will
God forsake those that fear his presence, and tremble at his word; tremble all
ye Cedars of the earth, for your glory shall be shaken, by the brightness of
his coming, shall your glory be consumed, even as Chaff before the wind shall
the wicked be scattered, and their glory brought to naught; the glory of the
earth shall be laid waste, God will leved the Hills, and mountains. The barren
mountains shall become a fruitful field, and the true shepherd shall be
known, he will feed his Sheep in the plain where no Wolves shall come to
devour them; he is a good Shepherd indeed, he carries his Lambs in his arms,
he preserves the innocent, and feeds the Hungry, and the rich he sends empty
away. Away with all your abominations, that you have gathered into your selves
in the wrong nature, and fed the flesh, and starved your souls, by the fall is
flesh exalted, and by the Spirit is righteousness increased the Spirit of God I
mean, which leads out of lust, covetousness, pride, and murder, all this has
been gathered in by the fall of Adam: In that nature you are, you cannot
witness a new life, and yet you say you are holy, and unblameable in your
actings toward God. God you never knew, your actions is denied by the Lord of
life, for they are but dead works; your works is like your selves, fruitless
trees you are, full of leaves bearing, no fruit at all. The fruits of
righteousness is a stranger amongst you, your deceit is known to the Lord, you
can no longer be hidden; light i^ come into the world, and men love darkness
rather than light, because their deeds are evil. The evil root has been
advanced, the Nations have been drunk, all manner of abominations have been
gathered in, and men thereon have built Palaces, and Towers, and strong Holds;
These Camps shall be broken, the Army of the Lord shall destroy their
buildings; he is a coming with ten thousands of his Angels to reckon with all
flesh; he will gather his people together out of all corners of the earth, yea,
throughout the earth will God be known; his kingdom shall be advanced; Long,
long, has the Heritage of the Lord laid waste; now shall the Harlot be
discovered, the wicked have been exalted, and the poor have suff^red, the Lamb
of innocence has been forgotten amongst men; men have gloryed in their shame,
and gathered to themselves swift destruction. Come down unto the Lord and mind
innocence, it it will bring you to know an eternal kingdom, that kingdom is
endless, that kingdom can no man enter by subtilty or deceit; even as a child
is nourished by the mother, so does the Lord tender those that feed on him:
this food is an innocent life, and an harmless habitation, an habitation of
glory is the kingdom of God, and none can enter there but those, that are
sanctified; by his blood he redeemeth from sin, and death; death is the end of
all under the Sun. The Son of righteousness makes his enemies to fly before
him, he dissolveth their glory by the brightness of his coming; this appearance
is not by man's will, it cuts the rebellious minds in sunder, and brings down
the lofty in their imaginations; Is not this an imagination to consecrate, and
make holy (as you say) water to sprinkle your faces, what is it that can make
holy? you being sinners your selves, you do call it holy water, where have you
this rule; or by what Spirit are you guided, If by the Spirit, of God then
would your fruits appear to be like unto him; that Spirit begets like it self,
things that are sanctified, those that are sanctified, are by that Spirit
guided, their fruits are not like yours; setting your selves in an exalted seat
of judgment, and you your selves are to be judged by that eternal Spirit,
which cuts down transgression, you your selves being found transgressors, how
can you sit in the seat of judgment with a safe conscience to judge others,
and you your selves as corrupt as any, and as sinful as any, how can you then
be so impudent, as to take upon you these things, which belong to the Lord
only? he is judge of all, he is judged of none, and his judgment is true, and
shall stand eternally for ever and ever; never will God be known in this nature
which you act in, as your committing of murder; did ever Christ when he was
upon the earth murder those, that would not believe in him? have you received
this example from the Lord of life? let that in your consciences judge whether
these fruits be wrought in God yea or nay, if not of God, then must it be of
the Devil, he was a murderer from the beginning, and so are you; even as Cain
slew Abel, so are you murderers, and manslayers: your foundation is tyranny;
against the living God are you bent; your mischief is made manifest to the
children of light, and life, they who lives in God sees the dark world how it
stands advanced in man's heart, the world is completed in the children of
disobedience, and they are become Princes by their Author the Devil, he is the
Prince of darkness, and darkness possesses their hearts that is guided by
lies; that Spirit say you cannot err; which you are guided by; now consider
with your selves, what Spirit it is, whether it be the Spirit of God, or of the
Devil; did ever God command you to murder men yea or nay? mind your selves,
and in this practice do not you uphold adulterers, murderers, and thieves? If
they be never so wicked, you let them alone in their sin, if they will but
honor you, who calls your selves the Romish Church; you are Romans indeed, and
not Israelites, your fruits makes you manifest what you are, and from whence
you came, and whether you will go, if you do not repent, to him which is the
Author and the finisher of all wickedness, it is he that gives you glory, this
glory which shall become desolate; desolation is your portion, if you mind not
the light of Jesus to guide your minds, and stay you in all your actions, and
to bring your deeds to this light, and examine your selves, whether they be
wrought in God, yea or nay. God is the Author of all that is righteous, he is a
righteous God, and judges with equity, and his judgments are true; mind the
light in your consciences, whether or no it does not judge your evil deeds,
and check you in secret, this is the witness for God, this is the light of
Jesus, which lets you see your sin, wait in it, it will lead you to the Father
of life and light, out of all visible things; it will judge your enemies, it is
your friend; turn unto it, God has not left himself without a witness; this is
his witness, that discovers the fruits of darkness, all deeds of the flesh are
dark, that is not by the light guided. The light is the beginning to know God;
for God is light, in him there is no darkness at all; even as clear as Crystal
is his kingdom, the transplendent glory of the living God is as a Diadem of
Gold, as a Scepter of righteousness, to this shall all Nations bow, and bend,
Kings shall bring their glory to the Holy City of the living God; what is your
glory to this you usurpers, and grand transgressors; the ancient of days shall
level your glory and your shame shall appear naked as it is; you are naked,
you are naked indeed, you want the Lambs ornament; with bloody Garments you
have long been covered, that covering shall stand you instead no longer, your
abomination will appear unto all, and then is your covering (which by it you
have been exalted) rent in sunder; by the brightness of his coming is your
deeds made manifest, who act in the flesh without God in the the world. Are not
you ashamed of your practice to sit like Princes in a Palace with your silver
Inkhorns, and your Gold Rings on your fingers, and your silken Carpet, and with
your Rooms hung, and decked with ornaments, even as a Kings Palace, and ancient
men waiting upon you, cringing, and bowing, and you but men your selves; ye
seek glory one of another, and set the glory of God behind your back, unto you
Inquisitioners, I do speak. Consider with your selves the author of this
practice, whether it be not of the Devil yea or nay. Christ Jesus when he was
upon the earth, had not a place to lay his head on, neither did his Disciples
u^urp any seen authority, their habitation was not in this world, but in
another, and that world is an encless habitation to those that fear the Lord,
and keep his Commandments; his Commandments i^ pure an undefiled, an
undefi^ed life does the Lord require; consider with your selves all things
under the Sun is but vain; turn unto the Lord, and repent of this your
abomination, be all of one mind, and set your selves to love innocence, that
you may become haters of evil, I mean not self righteous, for no man can see
God and live; wait on that which is eternal, the light of the Lamb and
strength shall be given against all your enemies which is sin, and death. The
light of the Lamb is not so, it leads to purity, peace, and true holiness, and
love. God is love, and love is the fulfilling of the Law; this Commandment I
leave with you (says Christ Jesus) that ye love one another; he gave his life
for the love which he bore to sinners, and he left his light in the world that
men might know good from evil. Every man has a talent given him, the sluggard
has a talent, the unprofitable servant had a talent, and he hid it in the
earth. Earthly minded men hides this talent, and keeps it under the
abomination, Christ Jesus was a Lamb slain from the b^ginni^g in the beginning
was the word, and the word was God, and dwelt among men; but men loved darkness
rather th^n light, because their deeds were evil, evil minded men have
possessed the kingdoms of the earth, and by the fall lies in disobedience, and
have exal^ed themselves above all that is called God, they are exalted by
concupiscence, and disobedience, which they have gathered in by the Prince of
the Air. Airy minded men have gathered in by that Clymate swift destructions to
their souls; from the beginning it was not so, when innocence dwelt in Adam,
be obeyed God, the Serpent being subtle, deprived man of his eternal
happiness, and begot a nature like unto himself, and selfly minded men are like
unto him, their seed is d^ceit, full like unto him that sowed it, the enemy
came and sowed tares among the wheat, and the good seed was choked, and took
not ro^t; now cons^der of these things; consider, there is but two, good, and
evil. The good proceeds from the Lord, that seed is innocent, and harmless,
and would the death of no man, it is the fruit of righteousness, peace, it
leads unto an holy life, and to do righteousness in the fight of God; and to do
unto every man, as you would be done unto; it leads not into Cains nature,
that slew his Brother Abell; it does not teach, to murder men, to be a
manslayer; consider with your selves, whether your practice be of God yea or
nay; will you deal so with any, that you would not have them so to deal with
you? would you be slain for conscience sake your selves; turn to the Lord, that
you may see your evil ways, that by the brightness of his coming your enemies
may be dissolved, and that an end may be put to all these things, which have
been gathered by subtlety, and held up by tradition to advance the Devils
Kingdom; away with all your vain imaginations, away with all your deceit, away
with all your double dealing, all is laid open before the Lord, and he is a
judge of it, and his judgment is true, and men are liars. The Devil was a
liar from the beginning he has deprived man of his eternal happiness by a
lie; by a lie was Eve beguiled, and misled with that which leads to desolation
all mankind; desplation has possessed the souls of men by the fruit of
iniquity, which has been gathered in by his subtlety, that is a deceiver. A
deceiver is he, who judges the ways of God to be a lie; false judgment is
set up, and instead of righteousness, that should take place in man's heart,
disobedience have took place upon the earth; and the righteous Law have been
neglected, because man has obeyed the Devil in the stead of God, that is a
pure Author, this Author was from the beginning, from everlasting to
everlasting world without end; without end is his glory, but you know it not,
it is hid from you by the grand-enemy of man, who is exalted above all that is
called God. God is a beginner of innocence, and a fountain of life to all
those that trust in him, come all ye ends of the earth, and drink of the water
of life freely, he is a ^iving fountain, yea he is a living fountain, and all
that will come shall be tefresht in that Crystal fountain, where the water of
life springs continually to wash the Garments of those that are filthy: By his
Blood are we all cleansed. O ear the living God of life, and power, for
powerful is he to all them, who trust upon him for life, and power against
sin; by faith are we saved; If we trust in God as a redeemer, Faith is belief,
and belief makes perfect all those, that trust in him for redemption; he that
has faith purifies himself, even as God is pure, by the fountain of
righteousness that comes from God, he is righteousness for ever, and his
Kingdom cannot change; no changeable thing can therein enter. The Heavenly
fountain is set open for men, therein to wash, and to be cleansed to serve the
living God of life, and power; yea unto him is power given, who is the Son of
God, that enlightneth the dark world, and leads up to the Father of life, and
light. Friends consider of all these things that is herein written, they shall
stand eternally either for your condemnation, or justification. If you believe
and repent, God will show mercy, if not your judgment shall hasten to your
Condemnation. The innocent Lamb has long suffered under the abomination of
all flesh; now will God get himself a name above all names, and his power shall
be known above all powers; his glory shall stain all flesh, and that glory
shall be laid in the dust, who have been exalted above the innocent, and made
desolate widows houses, and wronged the fatherless, and the poor; this has
been the cry many hundred years, the righteous Law of the living God has been
forgotten, and man's will has been performed by the children of disobedience,
who have studied revenge against the innocent Lamb of light, and life and
power; but unto him shall power be given to avenge his enemies, a double reward
shall the wicked receive, their reward shall be doubled; the same Bread, which
they have broken unto others, the same shall be broken to them; this is the
word of the Lord unto you Inquisitioners, repent, and turn from your evil
ways, and come down to the light of Jesus, and by it be guided, and it will
turn you from dead works to serve the living God, that an end may be put to
all, that have been gathered, and not by the Lord; from the eternal Spirit, by
the power of the living God; this was I ordered to write for the good of your
souls,

A friend to your souls and an enemy to your deceit. A. GARGILL.

FRIENDS,
TO all you, who calls your selves Roman Catholics. Romans you are indeed, and
no Israelites, he that is an Israelite knows the Lord, but your ways are
abomination to the Lord, acted in the deceit of your Hearts, deceitful is
your practice, unstable is your minds, you are lead by tradition to the
destruction of your souls; your cringing, and bowing it is all in the fall; you
bow unto d^ad Images like your selves; death seeds on death, and that is the
end of your practice by tradition of your old Fathers, which you call Saints,
they are Authors say you, and you believe as the Church believes, and the
Church (as you call it) have their Author from the Devil the Father of lies,
he was a liar from the beginning, and by a lie is his Kingdom upheld in the
children of disobedience; through mischievous men are the innocent beguiled;
beguiled are all they whose life is death, whose end is destruction, learn to
live in God that your lives may be holy, and unblameable before the Lord of
life, that a living Sacrifice may be offered, and not a dead stone; you say
your Images, and likenesses (that are not) is your redeemer; he that redeems is
the Lord, you set them in the stead of God, when you do say likenesses puts you
in mind of Christ Jesus, did you ever Preach any su^^ Doctrine? that a dead
thing renews the mind? what think you of this? are you not ashamed to be called
Christians? when the very ^urk walks more unblameable? do you not whore, and
swear, and murder, and steal, and cheat and cousen, and yet you say, you are
Christians. If you were Christians, then you would be like Christ Jesus, but
him you never knew; you have a name to live, and are dead; the living praise
the Lord, yea, the living p^aise the Lord, your moulten Images cannot save you,
nor all your prayers to Mary, and to the Saints Mary her self (when she lived
upon the earth) claimed no such authority, but was subject to the Lord of life,
even as was others; who is my Mother, Sisters or Brother, even they which do
the will of my Father, says the Lord Christ Jesus; when the Scribes, and
Pharisees came and told him that there was his Mother, and Brethren looking for
him, he stretched forth his hand toward his Disciples, and said, these are my
Mother, and Brethren, who do the will of my Father? showing that he was no
respecter of persons, but loved all who feared the Lord; his love is
unchangeable, his love is undefiled; and an undefiled life does he require: no
other thing does the Lord require: but separation from sin, from the beginning
has it separated man from from God; no other thing makes a stranger but
disobedience, God require than holy life, and that you are strangers to: you
call your Priests Holy men; you have a light from Jesus, t^a^ shows you, they
are as bad as you, and that you are as bad as them, and where is then your
Church? The Church of Christ is pure and an hidden thing from the carnal: the
Church is hid in God, and none can see his glory, but they that are like unto
him; his glory is an undefiled life amongst his people: he takes delight in
those that keeps his Commandments, his Commandment is pure, and holy, and no
unclean thing can enter into his kingdom, his kingdom is pure indeed, even of
Christail, even as the Sun at noon day, so is his glory to them known that
keeps his Statutes, and his Law; and this Law is, to be guided by that eternal
Spirit, which leads up out of the world to the Father of life, and light.
This is the condemnation of the world, that light is come into the world, and
men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil, be ashamed
of your evil deeds, and turn to the light of Jesus which discovers sin, the
light of God placed in all your consciences, that tells you, you should not
swear, nor lie, nor deal falsely; by it God will be known to be a righteous
judge. God is a judge of evil, and a lover of righteousness, and he loves all
them that put their trust in him, Come all ye ends of the earth, and be saved,
says the Lord, yea come all and drink of the water of life freely, the water
of life is the wisdom of God to guide their minds, and that wisdom leads to
an heavenly kingdom, where there is no end; an end shall be put unto all under
the Sun, when the Son of righteousness does arise with healing under his wings,
then shall all flesh be saved, he saves his people from their sin, they who
mind this innocent guide which shows them sin, it will lead them to another
kingdom out of subtlety, and deceit; by subtlety was Eve beguiled. The Serpent
was more subtle than any beast of the field, promised knowledge of good, and
evil, ye shall be as Gods knowing good, and evil; was not his a lie? to
deprive man of his eternal happiness, leading out of pure obedience, promising
that which could not be; he that does evil knows not good, and he that does
good knows not evil. Gods ways is a stranger to man's ways, and man's ways is a
stranger to the Lord in that nature, which stands in disobedience through Adams
fall. Adam disobeyed God in eating the forbidden fruit, and in that nature has
the Generations of the earth been lead in disobedience, continually do men act
by tradition one of another, and the righteous Law of God is forgotten. The
unrighteous p^ant, the seed of the evil has flourished long upon the earth,
long has the Lord suffered under your abominations, now will the Lord call
you to an account, you must give an account to the Lord for all your evil
deeds done in the flesh; without the Spirit of God you have acted, and worshipped
you know not what; what has your worships been, has it brought you to an holy
life, yea, or nay? God is holy, and his worship is holy, and out of God is
nothing accepted; he that dwells in God, dwells in love, and love is the
fulfilling of the Law. This Commandment I leave among you, says Christ Jesus,
that ye love one another; where is all your love, do ye not murder one
another: and Cozen one another? and cheat one another? does not the Pope your
Author do these things? he which you call your grand Bishop, and your holy
Father you call him; Christ's Vicar, you say, he is; but you are liars, and the
true riches not in you; you are strangers to the Lord, and the Pope whom you
call your head, he is your head, you know no other, a wicked man he is, like
your selves, and a blasphemer, and a liar, and usurper. The hand of the Lord is
against that seat of pride that is upholden by him, his glory shall be shaken,
and that root shall be removed, and his end shall become desolate who is a
deceiver; a deceiver is he who seeks self, his glory is advanced by the
children of darkness. Search, and try these fruits by the light of Jesus,
whether or no they be wrought in God, pride and covetousness, selfly
mindedness; an advanced Bubble is he whom you you call your head. Christ is the
head of all them who trust in him, he is a head, and a well spring of life; he
is a living fountain to them that believe, Belief makes perfect; through pure
obedience is God known to them that put their trust in him, and stay their
minds upon the Lord of life; he is life, and light; in him there is no darkness
at all: all are fallen from God, who acts in the dark, and without the light.
In the beginning was light, and this light is the life of men, he breathed into
Adam the breath of life, and he became a living soul, and this soul was perfect
until the transgression; this transgression leads man out of God, for God is
light, and man is darkened by the Prince of darkness, who leads out of God;
now consider who is your leader, or by whom are your minds guided, are you not
busied in your minds about many things yea or nay? while Adam lived in the
state of innocence, he was perfect even as God had him made; there is an
estate of innocence which leads unto life, and this life is hid in God, the
world sees it not, because of the enmity: the Serpents seed, it is the seed of
sedition, who has betrayed man of his eternal happiness, and his well being.
A being has man in the fall through disobedience; he lies in Blood, even a
murderer from the beginning was Cain, Cains nature dwells in the children of
disobedience, the nature of man is enmity against God; God is a redeemer from
that nature, If man turn unto that which is pure, the light of Jesus that
discovers sin; sin is an enemy to man, in the beginning it was not so; God made
man upright, man sought out many inventions* By the Devil has he been led to
the destruction of his soul, he is an enemy to all mankind, and a liar from
the beginning, and by a lie has his kingdom been upheld; all your invention is
of man, a humane invention is your practice, of that which you call your
Religion, he that seems to be Religious, and bridles not his tongue, he is a
liar, and the truth abides not in him: your tongues are at liberty, who swear,
and lie, and blaspheme the name of God, blasphemy is your practice, your
Religion, as you call it, it is blasphemy against God, and the Author is the
Devil; and by a lie you uphold your authority; as to say, your Pope is a
Vicar; what is a Vicar can you tell? or by what authority does he sit with a
triple Crown upon his head, and a Shepherds Crook in his hand? who is his
Author, or where had he this example? did not Christ, and his Disciples wander
up and down, and had no certain abiding upon the earth, they labourd, and went
up and down and preached the glad tidings of the Gospel to them that would
repent and turn from their evil ways; you live as Sodomites, and your
Shepherd like unto you, your Pope (it is I mean) so called of you, a name
devised of the Devil, an invention of Babylon; was any such name given of old
in the times of the Apostles, or Prophets? did any man, that feared God,
receive authority to sell pardons for money? Christ says, come all you that
are heavy laden, and I will give you ^ase; he is a redeemer out of corruptible
things, he is a good Shepherd; he gives his life for his Sheep; without money
and without price may you come* and drink of the water of life freely; he
forbids none, the fountain of living water is set open for the Lambs therein
to feed; but no Wolves, no ravenous Beasts, no Popish Prelates in that nature
wherein they now stand; The workers of iniquity are shut out of the Counsel of
God, their Counsel is abomination, who are devourers of the Creation; the
Creation is given to man to be used in the wisdom of God, but men have abused,
and wronged that, which was given, and gathered to themselves swift
destruction: your example, and your Author leads your minds against the truth;
he that exalts himself shall be abased. Is not this an exalted Bubble (your
Pope I mean) that sells you pardons for your sins, and say, that they are
forgiven, when he himself sins worse than you in so doing, even as Judas
betrayed the innocent for money; turn unto the Lord he is a cleanser, and a
redeemer, his redemption stands for ever and ever; he that is redeemed by the
Lord is free from sin; sin is death, and death leads to the destructions of
man's soul; man is made desolate by sin, and death, and death is the end of all
them who love their iniquities; love the Lord, he is a friend to all them, who
come unto him; come all ye ends of the earth and be saved, says the Lord, come
all ye people of the earth and turn to the righteous God, he will cleanse you
of all manner of pollution, and your bloody garments shall be washed in the
blood of the Lamb, if you repent; repent, and be baptized that your sins may be
be forgiven. This Baptism is not sprinkling of childrens faces with water, and
putting Salt in their mouth, and spitting upon their noses, and under their
ears, and crossing of them with their fingers. Are you not ashamed of these
practices? did ever the Apostles do these things? you say, you have a
Scripture, to put Salt in the childrens mouths, it is said in the Scriptures,
let your words be seasoned with Salt; how comes it then that your children, and
you swear, and curse, and take Gods name in vain; this is not seasond nor
commendable before the sight of God, or man; it is unsavory before the Lord, to
what effect is this Salt? John's Baptism it is not so, he preached to amendment
of life, and to be washed, and cleansed by the blood of Jesus, who cleanses
from sin, and redeemeth from dead works to serve the living God, your service
is vain, your practice vain, without wisdom are you guided; the true wisdom of
God you do not know, the Covenant of Grace you are strangers to; you are
without where are Dogs, and Wolves, and ravenous Beasts; in the beastly nature,
in that, which God cannot own; in the filth, and lust of your flesh, you offer
up that, which cannot be accepted, Cains sacrifice it is enmity against God,
you murder the just, your service that you do pretend to the Lord, it is
abomination; the just God will not be so served any longer, for he will be
avenged of his enemies, he will call to an account the iniquity of the Heathen;
By vain Philosophy have the innocent been betrayed, that which the Apostle
speaks against; your Schools of learning, which has upheld the Den of Divills.
Vain Philosophy have ye studied to deceive the people of their eternal
happiness, to advance your selves; the Spirit of Christ is plainness, it comes
not by study. Innocence leads into Christ's kingdom, even as a little Child
must you there enter; no policy of man can therein come, it is hidden from
that nature, which dwells in the Serpents kingdom. A light from Jesus is come
into the world, which discovers all your deceit, and all that abomination.
The mighty day of the Lord is coming, yea, it is coming upon you all, to
consume, and dash in pieces, and rend your kingdom in sunder; the vail shall be
rent, the dark world shall be enlightened by the light of Jesus, who enlightneth
all men; now shall he appear in glory, a glorious possession shall he gather
unto himself out of the dust; long has the heritage of the Lord lain waste,
yea long has the glory of man been exalted, and the Lamb of innocence
forgotten; howl ye inhabitants of the earth, yea howl, for bitter lamentation
shall come upon you, in a day when you know not; know this God is righteous,
and his judgments are true, you shall give an account for all your
abominations to the living God of life, and power; powerful is the Lord, he
will execute judgment upon all his enemies, yea, he will be avenged of all his
enemies, and bring them under his feet; now is the Lord going to reckon with
all flesh, and the glory of it shall be stained; his own kingdom shall be
advanced, the glory of man shall be laid in the dust, and God alone shall
reign, and the kingdoms of the earth shall become the kingdoms of God; for many
hundred years has the righteous Law, of God, been forgotten, he has been a
patient God, and has spared the Heathen, but now will the Lord call to account
your unrighteous dealing, and all your worldly mindedness, earth has been
lodged in your hearts, covetousness, and pride, and all manner of abomination
has been exalted in your minds; turn to the light of Jesus that discovers sin,
God is a true witness placed in your consciences be guided by that, it leads
to the kingdom of Jesus Christ, the son of the eternal God, this kingdom is
righteousness, purity, peace to them which love God, and keep his
Commandments; but no peace to the wicked, they shall dye without mercy. The
wicked shall have their portion in the lake, where there shall be weeping, and
wailing, and gnashing of teeth. The Wellspring of life shall be set open to
all those that fear the Lord, and obey his voice; the voice of God is known to
all, but they burden their hearts, and will not hear; they will not bring their
deeds to judgment, because they have hardened their hearts against the Lord,
and his anointed, the holy one of Israel is he called, he who leads from
death to life, to serve the living God of life, and power, to him be all power,
and glory for ever and ever.

A Declaration of truth be it unto you, receive it in the honesty of your
minds, receive the truth as it is in Jesus in honesty of your Spirits: examine
your selves whether or no these things be not so, come down to the light of
Jesus, and let that judge your fruits, from whence they come, and what they
are, and what he is that leads you to these practices. If by the Spirit of God
you are led, then would your works make you manifest whose children you are;
there is that in your consciences tells you your deeds are evil, and not
accepted of the Lord. Turn unto it which lets you see the sight of sin wait in
it in true obedience to the Lord, and power shall be given against your
enemies, and you shall receive peace through him, which is a redeemer of his
people, his they are that fear the Lord, and dread his presence, and fear to
sin. This was I moved of the eternal God to write unto you for the good of
your souls, who call your selves Roman Catholics

Written per me from the Spirit of truth, who is called of the world. A. GARGIL.

UNto thee that calls thy self Bishop of Rome, thy Bishopric is of the Devil,
the Devil is the Author, and finisher of thy authority; where is thy authority
gathered? from out of the pit it came, and thither shall it return. Thy
Genealogy and thy authority has both one root, and that root is the Devil, the
Father of lies; a liar he was from the beginning, upon that root is thy center,
thou art centred upon deceit, thy seat is abomination to the Lord, thy refuge
is the Devil, no other do thou know. The true God is a stranger unto thee,
and his Commandment thou never knew; the seat of pride is exalted in thee, The
Devils habitation is thy fenced City, a City builded upon deceit, is the throne
of thy authority. Thy Author is like unto thee, he, who is the Prince of
darkness, upholdeth thee in thy pride, and thy vain practice; it is a shame to
all thy generation to see thy vanity, and thy pride. If it they mind that is
the light, that shows darkness, then will they see thee, and whence thou
came, and whither thou will go, If thou repent not; be ashamed of these things
thou beastly man, who takes upon thee the seat of God; was ever man so
impudent as these Generations. In the days of old it was not so, the Apostles,
and Prophets were diligent men, and wandered up and down from one Country to
another, where ever the Lord did call them. Contrary to their own wits, by the
will of him that sent them, they were guided to do their Fathers work; they
preached the Gospel without gain unto themselves, or any self advantage; thou
seeks gain unto thy self, and the glory of the world has blinded the eye.
Concupiscence lodges in thee, thou art a hater of all good. Good is it for
thee if thou repent, and turn from thy evil ways. Come down from thy
abominable throne of wickedness and deceit, and cast thy triple Crown from thy
head, and thy deceitful garments, thy vestment of Babylon; thy vesture of holy
Roodes as thou calls them, are for the fire, the indignation of the Lord will
consume thy glory, thy throne shall be laid in the dust, in dust has thy
habitation been builded, no foundation but vain imaginations of man. Is not
this an imagination to throw thy self in pride, and exalt thy self above all
other, he that exalts himself shall be abased; and thy base practice is
disallowed on by the children of light, and life; life establishes the kingdom
of God amongst the sons of men, but thy kingdom lies in death, thou art dead
whilst thou live; thou bear a name to live and is dead, thy glory is thy
shame. Art thou not ashamed to call thy self a Vicar? Christ's Vicar thou say
thou art; what is a Vicar can thou tell? out of the pit thou have stolen this
title, and by no Scripture-rule; there is no such name there as Vicar, nor no
such practice spoken of as thou do imitate, as to sit in a Chair, with a
triple Crown on thy head, and a Shepherds Crook in thy hand, and the Keys of
Heaven, and Hell; say thou? Is not this horrible blasphemy against the Lord,
and his anointed? can any man enter Gods kingdom by a carnal authority; thou
art known to be Carnal, thou cannot be hid any longer, thy deceit is
manifested to the children of light. Thy dark actings are seen by them who
dwell in the light of the Lord. Light it is which discovers darkness. Thou
say thy Church, as thou call'st it, is a figure of Noah's Arc, and thou
say all without thy border shall be damned; by what Spirit do thou judge?
is it the Spirit of God yea, or nay? all other Spirits are for judgment, but
thy Spirit is seen, and thy judgment is a lie, judgment does belong only to
God, and to no carnal man. Thou say thy Church, (as thou callst it) has
seven heads, and stands upon seven Hills, and gives light unto the
Nations, but thou tells a lie; shall I show thee the seven Heads and ten
Horns. The beastly nature of man stands in the four Elements, and in the five
senses completed by disobedience, these are ten Horns builded upon seven
Heads, whereon thy Church (as thou call it) stands. The seven Heads is the
abomination of man which gathers in swift destruction to his soul; the root
of these seven Heads is the Devil, which is the foundation of thy practice,
which Center does proceed from these seven Heads, shall I show thee these
seven Heads, what they are, and whence they come. The Dragon has cast forth
her poison, and infected the five senses of man, the will and the mind
compleateth the seven Heads, where the fountain of iniquity springs, which
gathers in swift destruction unto man; all the senses are poysond through
disobedience; even the Smoke of Sodom has infected, and strangled man, and
hinders man of his well being; A well being had man before deceit entered,
through disobedience was Adams fall, and this fall was unto death, and death is
the end of those that fear not God; God is the end of all things under the Sun,
when the Sun of righteousness does arise with healing under his wings, the
first nature he disolveth, he dissolves all those that lives in Sodom, as smoke
before the wind, shall the wicked be consumed by the breath of the Lord, yea,
the breath of his Nostrils shall consume his enemies, yea, the Lord shall
consume their glory, and bring their building under his feet, he will trample
on their abomination: A consumption shall come upon the ends of the earth, and
all that is exalted above the Lord shall be abased, and his own kingdom shall
be exalted, which stands in righteousness, and true holiness; with equity
will the Lord judge the ends of the earth, with equity the innocent Lamb shall
be now exalted, over his enemies will he reign, his reign is endless, and
blessed are they who are witnesses of Christ's reign. A witness he has in thee
who calls thy self a Bishop, and art none. Read in the Scripture, and consider
the office of a Bishop, he is not to be covetous, nor selfly minded; A selfly
minded man art thou, thy fruits makes thee manifest; consider thy self whether
or no thy fruits be of God, or of the Devil. Righteousness and peace dwells
in them, that fear the Lord, the kingdom thou cannot reconcile, thou art an
author of iniquity, from thy root does all iniquity spring; the Well Spring of
life thou never knew, nor thy ancestors before thee, which builded upon this
root, the root of iniquities thy head, and thy Author, and this head is
complete in thee, thou Son of iniquity; iniquity has abounded long in these
Generations, now is the Lord a coming to reckon with all flesh, the ends of the
earth shall be gathered, and swift destruction shall come upon all those that
are exalted above the Lord, and his anointed, the holy one of Israel is he
called; a name which thou knows not, neither thy ancestors before thee, nor thy
successors, the Cardinals I mean, where have they stolen this name but out of
the pit, an exalted title, you have no rule for it. Is there any such name in
the Scriptures as Cardinals, Jesuit, Carmalin, Jacobin or Augustine; are they
not these inventions of names, and tytles, which you have gathered out of the
pit; as for your Seminaries, and Monks, beastly names they are, and Friars of
several orders (as you call them) which I have not here mentiond; shameful
orders, not ordered by the Lord, but by the Devil, which is your Author; he is
the Author, and finisher of this practice. A Company of Drones, who live in
Monasteries, and Cloisters like drones among Bees, eating up the fruits of
others labors, feeding themselves with the fat, and clothing themselves with
the Wool, and calling themselves holy men; is this the fruit of holiness yea or
no? the holy men of old they did not so, they did not lie still in a House,
they went up and down, and had no certain abiding, they labored with their
hands, until the Lord called them by his eternal Spirit from one Country to
another, as the Lord did order them in his wisdom, they followed not the
tradition of man, as you do; you say, them, which you call your ancient
Fathers, devised your orders, of Priests, Monks, and Friars; the light of
Christ Jesus discovers all your folly, and all your abomination, which you
have received by tradition, your Purgatory, and all your stuff, which you talk
of; did you ever read in the Scriptures of a Purgatory to purge sin yea or nay?
is not Christ a redeemer, and a cleanser of them that believe in him? yea
verily he is a redeemer to all that do believe in him for salvation by no other
thing can man be cleansed but by the blood of Jesus Christ: Jesus is a redeemer
of all that fear, and keep his Commandments; all your staff which you call
your Mass, and Sacrifice it is abomination to the Lord, it is a Sacrifice to
the Devil and not to God; you Sacrifice the works of your hands; you are
hirelings, and greedy dumb Dogs, such as the Prophet Jeremiah cried against, if
they would not put into their mouths, they prepared war against them; you say
your Mass is a Sacrifice, and an atonement for the sins of the people, and you
call it the flesh of Christ, and makes an offering of it, Christ Jesus offered
up himself once for all, he is a free will offering to his Father; but you sell
yours for money, that which you call your Sacrifice, your price of it 8 d. Is
not this a shame? be ashamed of all your ungodly deeds, and come down to the
light of Jesus to the witness, for God placed in your Consciences, that your
evil deeds may be discovered. I am the light of the world says Christ Jesus,
and in me there is no darkness at all; this light discovers sin, and all
manner of abomination; by his stripes we are healed, he is afflicted when we
transgress, the innocent Lamb bears the iniquity of his people; be is
afflicted that never sinned; the iniquities of sinful men burdneth the Lord. A
rebellious generation has turned their backs of the living God; mind that
which grows for redemption, his true witness placed in your Consciences;
mind the Cry of the poor, and the Fatherless, that the Pi^grim, and the
stranger may have an habitation in thy house, thou that is exalt^d shall be
innocent, and does not witness Christ's reign; he that is exalted shall be
abased; he that is slain in thee is the Lord, thou persecutest afresh the Lord
of life in all thy actings, and thy abominable practice; subtlety have been
the Author of it, the Lambs innocence thou never knew; Philosophy, and Logic
these are set up, and exalted in the stead of innocence, this can never enter
Gods kingdom, it can never enter; the eternal God as bid from all your
subtlety, and deceit, you are strangers to his ways, yea, you are strangers;
that nature (wherein you stand) is shut out of his heavenly kingdom, yea, it is
shut out for ever, and ever; never will God own you, if there you stand, you
shall never see his face in that nature; his face is even as clear as
Crystal, and his glory excels the Sun at noon day. Early in the morning
will God arise, and blast the blossoms, which in the night have sprang. The
secrets of darkness shall be dissolved, and their glory brought to shame; the
root of iniquity shall be removed, and the righteous plants shall live for
ever. The fruits of ungodliness shall be blasted, even as Grass withers, so
shall all your glory be burned up with the brightness of the Sun. The Son of
righteousness will arise, and consume the works of your hands, and burn up your
Schools of learning, and and your Libraries of Books, and all your completed
subtlety: against the living God of life have you acted confusion, and builded
Babylon. This is the whore that sits upon many waters, the floods of
iniquity you have sucked in, swiftly to the destruction of your souls.
Innocence shall guide, innocence shall be exalted above all son ever and
ever; never will God suffer the unrighteous to reign, for the destruction of
his people any longer. The innocent shall judge, and that judgment is true;
his righteous kingdom shall now be advanced, and the iniquity of man shall be
abased. This was I eternally moved by the Spirit of the eternal God, to rip
open your deceit, to all those whose minds are honest, that they may see the
abomination of your practice, for ever will God be known in the hearts of them
who fear his name, and keep his Commandments: Amen so be it.
