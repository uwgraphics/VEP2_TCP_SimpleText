A LETTER FROM SHREWSBURY, SETTING FORTH The Design which the Anabaptists and
Quakers had to secure the Castle, and to have received five hundred more unto
them in opposition to the PARLIAMENT.
SIR,
HEre was a design by the Sectaries, for to make this place a seat of War, one
Hill who commanded the Castle, and his Lieutenant (being their Creatures) had
resolved yesterday in the evening, to let in 500. of them; But it was thus
prevented, Hill and his Lieutenant and some of his Soldiers that were Quakers
and Anabaptists, being gone to a Conventicle, the rest who were left in the
Castle, considered of what consequence it might be, should the design take
effect, resolved to draw up the Bridge (first having turned out those of the
Quaking Party) and deny their Officers entrance back, which they did, though
with Cap in hand Hill begged admittance, but the honest Soldiers, sent for one
Ingolsby a Captain of Horse, who quartered in the Town, and took him over the
wall into them, who has made Hill, the late peremptory Governor close
Prisoner. This was much to the Joy of this place. I have nothing more than to
desire your pardon for the trouble you now receive from

Your obliged Servant.
Salop. February 27. 1660.
