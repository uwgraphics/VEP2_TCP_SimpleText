The Judgment of the Court of War upon the Charge laid against Sir Richard
Cave, for the delivery up of HEREFORD.
OXFORD, 26. Iunij. 1643.
WHereas Sir Richard Cave has been accused to His Majesty for the betraying of
the Town of Hereford, when Sir William Waller came before that Town: and that
Accusation was transmitted to the Council of War, whereupon Witnesses were
examined upon Oath, and the Court of War at several Days heard the
Depositions and the whole Cause at large; Upon the full hearing whereof, the
Court was fully satisfied, that Sir Richard Cave was absolutely free from any
Imputation of any Crime to be objected against him in any thing touching the
delivery up of that Town, or sending away the Horses under his Command from
the Town at the time when Sir William Waller was before it, and that what he
did therein was both by sufficient and full Warrant, and by the advice and
consent of the Commissioners of Array for that County who were then present.
And this Court has thought it Just and honorable in them to Declare thus much
under their hands, That as far as in them lies they might repare the
Reputation of Sir Richard Cave, who has very unjustly suffered by this
Accusation.
