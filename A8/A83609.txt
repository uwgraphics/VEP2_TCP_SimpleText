Die Martis, 21. Februarii, 1642.
Whereas in these times of eminent danger, there is by Order of Parliament a
Fleet preparing, for the defense of this and other his Majesty's Dominions,
much greater then has been heretofore usual, presently to go out, for the
speedy manning whereof, with able Mariners, all possible diligence is to be
used.

It is this day thought fit, and Ordered, by the Authority of both Houses of
Parliament, That no Ships, nor Vessels whatsoever, which now are, or shall
come into the River of Thames, be permitted to go out thence upon any Voyage
or other occasion, until the said Fleet be completely manned, except such,
whose Just Occasions shall appear unto the Lords and others, Commissioners for
the Admiralty, to be so pressing and Urgent, that the Interruption of those
Ships would be a prejudice to the State; And the said Commissioners are to take
notice of this Order, and to cause the same to be put in Execution accordingly.
