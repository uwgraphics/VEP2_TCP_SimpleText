Good News out of Cheshire.
AMongst all our factious English Nobility none has declared himself of a more
perverse malignant disposition to the proceedings of the Honorable the High
Court of Parliament, then James Lord Strange, by the decease of his father now
Earl of Derby, declaring himself utterly against their just endeavors for
the Commonwealth, not only by striving to put the Commission of Array in
execution in the Counties of Chester and Lancaster; but also by beleaguring the
good Town of Manchester, because they refused to be assistant to his
mischievous purposes, and continued resolute to defend their Liberties, and
obey the Ordinances of Parliament, but being shamefully repulsed thence with
the loss of some hundred of his Cavaliers. He has often attempted the loyalty
of those Manchestrians, which he could no ways violate, and so has ever since
labored all the Gentry and Yeomanry in those Counties to his part, which was
no hard matter for him to do, by reason of his power in those parts, most of
them being his Tenants; Besides, on the other side of Dee he has large Revenues
in Darby-shire and Denbighshire in North Wales, where he likewise used all
means possible by his Agents to leavy men, taking up money of all the able men
of his acquaintance to pay his soldiers, which (...) is cre^^^^y reported of
Welsh men and others completed the number of it least seven thousand, of which
five thousand five hundred were Foot, and the rest Horse, with which Forces he
would feign have had another fling at Manchester, the disgrace he received
before in that Town sticking in his stomach, and in the hearts of his
Cavaliers; but upon maturer advise and wiser deliberations, being certified of
the preparations made in that Town for their defense, he waved his revenge and
thought it fitter to pass, if it were possible, into these Southern parts,
and unite his Army to the body of His Majesty's Army, Fortune seeming to smile
upon his intentions, being that His Excellence the Earl of Essex was retired
from those parts with his Forces toward the City of London, so that he verily
imagined none would impeach his passage; to the City of Chester therefore about
the midst of this present Month he drew forth all his Regiments, and billiting
them thereabouts some two days, he marched from thence toward Shrewsbury, and
so by way of Newport through the County of Salop toward Warwicke-shire,
plundring and destroying the Countries, his soldiers robbing and spoiling all
the Inhabitants thereabouts, as well Malignants of their own faction as those
that were true sons to their Mother the Commonwealth.

Upon Thursday last entering into Warwicke-shire, where the well affected
Trained Bands of that County, with some of the Parliament Forces left there to
secure the Country, prepared themselves to give him a welcome into those
parts, and to give him battle, rather then to permit their lands and
possessions, their wives and children to become a prey to those devouring
Harpies.

On Friday Morning therefore in a well composed Body they advanced to the edge
of the County as far as Bramicham, being some four thousand men, four hundred
of which were Horse.

The Earl being then quartered some three miles off, understanding of the
approach of these Regiments, by the advice of his Cavaliers those pernicious
Councillors marched with all speed toward them, who were nothing afraid of
his numbers: about twelve of clock they were in view one of another in the
broad highway about one mile on this side Brumicham; our men having two pieces
of Cannon they had from Warwick Castle, planted them privately behind a thick
quick-set hedge, placing some two hundred Musketeers in ambush, that lay close
without noise by the said pieces; the Earl had placed his horsemen in the
front of his forces, being most part Cavaliers, who vowed with all
desperateness to revenge the disgrace they had received at Manchester, on
those Roundheads, and so gallopping in apace, they were staid by our
horsemen, who demeaned themselves very resolutely, charging into their troops,
and with their Carabines and Petronels, tumbling diverse of them from their
horses never to rise again, till the Earl himself with his own troop
coming in, they did so overlay our horsemen with their numbers, they had much
ado to keep their ranks, some of them falling their Countries sacrifice; but
our foot not unmindfull to perform their duties, sent a lusty volley of shot
into the thickest of those malignants, which made them at a stand: our
Musketeers charging and discharging, with much discretion and dexterity, the
Cavaliers were not so hasty as at first, but wheeling about gave license to the
leaders of their foot, to bring them on, which they did, in as broad a body as
the narrowness of the place would permit; so that now they were at it with
much violence, sometime our footmen, and sometimes theirs getting ground,
their horse and ours upon all occasions seconding their foot. It was not
discernable to which side the better of the battle inclined, our forces, cause
smallest in number (though the better experienced and more courageous)
appearing to the Enemy to be half vanquished; but there was no such matter,
though many of them fell, the rest were not disheartened, rather excited to
revenge their fellows losses on those blood-suckers; and so being now come, as
it were, to handi-blowes, the valiant Pike-men at the push, showed their
cunning in martial discipline, and undaunted resolutions, goring their horses,
and killing their foot, while the Musketeers incessantly powered out their
flaming bullets.

My Lord of Darby seeing his men fall thus on every side, and that it was
impossible for his horsemen (in whom he reposed his chiefest confidence) to
break through our well ordered squadrons, commanded his reserve to be brought
up, which our men performing politiquely, gave ground at least some two hundred
paces, so giving opportunity to our ambush to charge them in the backs. The
Cavaliers perceiving them to give ground, swore many lusty oaths, that the
Roundheads fled, and so pressed on in great multitudes upon them when the two
pieces of Cannon, which, as we related, was planted behind the quick-set
hedge, were discharged into the very thickest of them, with the sudden noise,
and more sudden shot, amazing and overthrowing them by heaps, so that they had
now no mind to pursue our men, who having now their purpose, and seeing them in
that confusion at that unexpected salute, valiantly came in again upon them
with joyful outcryes, encouraging one another to assured victory. The Earl of
Darby seeing this disaster, wished himself further off, but it was in vain;
and therefore to make the best of that bad matter, he heartened on his
Cavaliers, telling them, our forces now were at the last cast, and that if they
once more did charge them but home, they would quickly be in rout.

The Cavaliers knowing it was but in vain to turn their backs, desperately
fell on again, and were as valiantly received, our men standing close, were
not to be driven from their stations by all the fury of those devils, but drive
back, force by force, opposing man to man, and horse to horse, our Cannon by
this time being charged, through the hedge played upon their flanks, so that
the footmen of Cheshire and North Wales began to think of flight, when behold
with a sudden and fearful outcry those two hundred Musketeers appeared in
the lane at their backs, discharging their pieces with good aim, and then
falling in with the butt end of their muskets and swords, they made a bloody
masacre among those malignants, who now would have fled, if they had known
which way, esteeming those forces that had so on the sudden, charged them on
the rere to be double their numbers: many of them therefore threw away their
Arms, and strived to leap the hedge on one side of the way; which being low,
was propitious to their purpose; some escaping that way, many others cried out
for quarter, and yielded themselves: the Earl of Darby with his Cavaliers
being in the Van, and hearing this strange hurliburly in his rere, turned faces
about, beholding the sudden destruction of his men, which he was no way able
to remedy, was ready to run mad for anger, and so with his Cavaliers betook
themselves to open flight, some of them leaping the hedge with their horses,
and the rest with the Earl, taking down the lane, and running over their own
foot as well as our musketeers, made back to Brumicham, our men to the very
twnes end, and in the town doing execution on thm; the poor townes-men
rejoicing to see those villains fall, that had so lately used them with all
hostility. There fell in the fight and in the flight, six hundred men and
upwards, and were full as many taken prisoners. Of our side there was lost some
seven score persons, our men giving thanks to God the giver of all victories
for that conquest stayed at Brumicham that night and the next day, to see if the
Earl would rally his forces, and again give them battle, but he had enough
of that afternoones intertainment, and had no mind to any more such welcomes;
and therefore as fast as his horse would carry him, he made away to
Shrewesbury, scarce thinking himself in safety, till he was within the walls,
such an impression of fear had that conflict put into him, from thence, as is
reported, he is stolen down, ashamed to be seen at Westchester, to his Manor
of Lathum in Lancashire, to reinforce his beaten Regiments: for our parts, with
our prisoners, and some Ensigns that were took from the Enemy, we are retired
to our houses, resolving on all occasions, to venture our lives for the
Honorable, the high Court of Parliament, which Heaven preserve in safety.

FINIS.
