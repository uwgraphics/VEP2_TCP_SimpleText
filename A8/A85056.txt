funeral cortege

THe Eastern Essex bright resplendant Sun
Now in the West is set his course is run;
Although grim Death has taken his Life away,
His Honor and his Fame shall live for aye,
For Death he has outdar'd, as all men knows,
Both on the Sea, and Laud, to meet his Foes:
His Auncitors were all brave Men of War,
Whose valient acts were known both near and far,
His House proclaimed by the Trumpe of Fame,
There Is few but weep to hear of Essex name;
The many Victories that he has won,
Does show, that he was valient Mars his Son;
He in the head of all his Troops did lead,
Nor thundering Cannon Bullets nere did dread,
His way he cut through his fierce Enemy,
Who at his presence did so often fly,
He bore the brunt at first in thi^ fierce War,
And in the West shone like a Blasing-star;
Though he was Va^ient, yet he blood did hate,
And still was trusty to the Weal and State,
So wise, so provident, so bounteous, so free,
That proved what every hopeful Soul should be,
Unto the meanest Soldier of his Band
He still was courteous, though he did command,
To save his Men he always had a care,
And in all miseries with them take share,
In his proceedings he was resolute,
Encouraging his valiant Horse and Foot,
Which so inflaim'd their hearts with hot desire,
That they would raither dye then to retire;
Truly Religious he was always found,
Mild, temperate, and of a Judgment sound,
He was (woe worth the loss) ambitious more,
To climb with Virtue then aspire with store:
A complete General was Essex still,
Which made his Soldiers to obey his will;
His stout Commanders all for him do mourn,
With droping hearts they bring him to his Vrne,
Rivers of reares run flowing from their eyes,
When they did celebrate his Obsequies;
In fable Weeds a mournful march they tread,
And (sighing) say, brave Essex he is dead:
But stay, weep not, for he is alive again,
And with Christ Jesus does triumph and reign;
Tears are the outward signs of inward sorrows,
Mankind to Nature renders what it borrowes:
Ah brittle Nature, does thy toil depend
On frailty, as where you begun to end?
Lillies and Roses do decay and perish,
Whilst bitter Wormwood and sharp Nettles flourish;
He Is dead (oh bitter word) of Soldiers prime.
That in his life proved Honor to the time:
This sinful Globe (af mere mortality)
He now has left, and did transcend the Sky,
Passing the Orbs of all the Planets seven,
And Fixed-Starres, whose Soul is fixed in Heaven,
In that Celestial Paradise of Joy,
Whereas the Spirit never feels anoy,
There Is always cheerful Day and never Night,
A^waies beholding of Gods glory bright,
All Joy, no Sorrow, and Mirth without measure,
No Sickness, Sorrow, but all Heavenly pleasure,
No Death, no Weeping, nor no Misery,
M^kenes and Concord, with sweet Harmony,
Here God does reign with Heavenly Angels bright,
Which to behold is a most glorious siight:
Essex his Soul's in Heaven, cease to weep,
Although his Body in the Grave does sleep;
We m^urne on Earth, he ioyeth with his Maker,
(A Soul in bliss is of no grief Parraker;)
For he is gone in better parts to dwell,
He bid the World good morrow, and farewell.
Finis.
