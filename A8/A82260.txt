A DECLARATION Showing THE NECESSITY Of the EARL OF STRAFFORDS Suffering.

Printed in the year 1641.

THE NECESSITY OF THE EARL OF STRAFFORDS SUFFERING.
SIR,
TO give you my advice why it is likely and most probable, I will give you my
reason; as causes produce effects, elevation and near approach of the Sun
argues Spring; greenness and flowers, declare Summer; throws antecedents of
nativity; clouds portend rain, and laying the cloth a preparation for dinner:
He the Earl of Straffords escape of punishment, must of necessity raise a
lamentable storm in our calm, as invading our liberties, shipwracking
property of goods, causing punishment upon his impeachers, so that the
trienniall Parliament will be of no such force as is expected; for besides it
will encourage others to do the like insolences, oppressions, extortions,
outrages and tyrannies; it will undo our State: consider we therefore his
Physiognomy, posture of person, proud carriage, and insolent behavior, it may
easily foretell the future, as falling leaves winter; for his palled color
shows revenge; his sower face, cruelty; his stooping and looking to the
earth, avarice; his gate, pride; and his demeanor, insolency; for revenge is
odious in greatness, cruelty abominable in governors, avarice hateful to
God and man, as appears by his sole ingrosing commodities in Ireland, and
therefore he will be homo hominibus lupus, proud in Magistracy, insolent in
supreme place, which will breed contempt, contempt impatience, impatience
fury, fury rebellion, and rebellion ruin of King and people, for he has been
so invested by the devil in all deeds, as he can be changed no more then the
Leopard from spots, or the Negro from blacknes, and who shall undertake to
alter him, labors in vain.

The Duke of Ireland Michael de la Pool and his confederates, caused the
breaking of the Parliament, when the Parliament had made the Duke of Gloucester
and others Commissioners to reform abuses, which were a mighty pressure then,
but those Monsters made all those faithful Ministers of State, conspirators
against King Richard the second and his prerogative, though these caterpillars
were delinquents and labored the demolition and overthrow of the whole Estate;
wherefore it has been a rule, that an ill instrument has always been made
incapable of government and can be of no use, for the postea; such always
have brought an ad quod damnum to the Prince, and mischief to the Common
wealth; for he is as subtle as Lewis the eleventh, libidinous as Tiberius,
cruel as Nero, covetous as rich Cressus, as terrible as Phalaris, and
mischievous as Sejanus, and at the same end may he arrive. I will never believe
but he aims at Monarchy whose actions spinne threads of Empire not easy to be
numbered, and therefore is worthy of no compassion of King or Parliament: for
this cause there is no more worthy subject of ruin then the acquests of his
manifold deeds; now the Dear which escapes the toil is more mannish, the
mad Bull wounded and let loose does more mischief: so if the Earl shall get
out of the net he will be more savage then before, like the Duke of Ireland
persecuted the Patriots of the Common wealth: for revenge in cold blood is more
dangerous then in passion, like the Mastive worried returns with others to kill.

Consider therefore his wicked facts, in the frontispiece of which, his setting
enmity between the two Nations England and Scotland, brothers and subjects to
one Sovereign, his exercising regal authority in Ireland, in impoverishing
that Kingdom, fining, imprisoning, causing diverse to die, putting out hundreds
from their estates by force and arms, starving others for want of flax and
materials, imposing new oaths against Law, and finally breaking up the last
Parliament. All which are high treason and are so adjudged in the case of the
Duke of Ireland and his confederates in the sixth of Richard the second.

Certainly by these barbarous actions he has caused the Subjects of England,
Scotland and Ireland to murmr against the Diadem; for the highest treason of
all is to cause the Throne to be despised, the Power neglected, and his
subjects to rebel, which in all ages has been held (by Civil and Common
Law) a most abominable Damnum Majestatis, worse then hurt of Majesty; for if
Otho Grandorser for making division between the Palatine of Rhene and his
mother lost his tongue and eyes much more, causing Subjects rebel (members of
the same heads) ought to be loss of life; The Kings regal power has been
obstructed and intercepted, eclipsing the shining Throne; it could not command
their affections, persons, purses, nor cause them fight against the Scots, whom
they thought honest and good Subjects: and not to insist upon one fact, has
not he caused men to be shot to death and executed? So Alvarode Luna for such
pride, in causing a Gentleman of Spain to have his neck broake out of a
window, because he spoke ill of him, was executed, though a great favorite,
and upon this reason that it procured the hatred of the people against the King.

It is no answer to allege that he did it by a council of war, for it has
no power in peaceable times where the quarrel is for the Subjects right and
religion, which the Prince cannot nor ought divorce them from; yea some of them
have been sacrificed to appease the people, though happily not guilty of
death; as Commodus the Emperor caused Cleandor to die to appease the
multitude, which Emperor was much commended by the Historians of that time:
for that wicked instruments of State have no bridle but fear of punishment;
for which cause the inventors of Gabells impositions and such like have been
rewarded with death; has not he impoverished the Subjects of Ireland and the
County of York, it is most certain he has; his ambitious mind has caused
him oppress Ireland, as Sejanus the Roman Monarchy, who received his demerits
a shameful death; his averice in a Subject has undone the Merchants of
Ireland, and oppression of Subjects by Subjects deserves death: and to say the
truth this man is greater then his Ancestors, less then his thoughts; which
like a whirlewinde has carried him to so abominable courses as has been
brought to pass, man cannot receive, nor fortune give more; if she had not
made him a King it was because she esteemed it a less thing to make him a
head of an Empire, then give the head of Monarchy to the prey of one; health,
wit, riches, greatness and honor, are gifts impoverish the foundresse, if
after the gift her avarice did not retake them.

There was only the Duke of Ireland had so absolute a power in Ireland, as he.
The first labored to be absolute Duke of Ireland, and so will this if he be
not cut off in his careire: for as others then, so the Papists now, (who are
the greater part of Ireland) would if it were in their power make him a King:
wherefore it appears necessary, that he should have condign punishment, for
wickedness unpunished diminishes not, but increases force; the physic
which this Parliament should administer to the sick state of the
Commonwealth, is seasonable, for nothing is more dangerous in the beginning of
fevers then not to let blood, and it is mortal in gangrenes not to cut off a
member; the house of Commons has voated him a traitor, the grand jury of the
Kingdom as has been said in other Parliaments; and shall he go unpunished
(God forbid?) likewise he has had a most honorable trial before the three
Estates, with diverse testimonies upon the several Articles, convinced with
prooffes; therefore the Lords by the Earl Marshall ought as in other
Parliaments to give sentence, for it appears by the 25. of Ed. the third Cap.
2. That the Parliament only has power to express and declare what is
treason, and to sentence it in cases not specified by the aforesaid Statute,
the words are these.

That if any other case supposed treason not above specified, shall happen
before the Judges they shall tarry till the Parliament come, before they give
sentence, that the cause be declared before the King and the Parliament,
whether it ought to be adjudged treason or felony; and this Statute is
perpetual, no probationer; though in the Statute of three and thirtieth of
Henry 8. Cap. 10. the Judges have power to attaint by a Jury, in cases
expressed aforesaid, by which the attainted forfeits all his lands to the King,
who shall be in actual and real possession of the same lands, tenements,
hereditaments, uses, goods, chattells, as if the attainder had been by
authority of Parliament; and so it is reported by Cook and Dier; and in a
Parliament in Henry the sixth time, all the Judges of England were of the same
opinion, when Thorpe Speaker of the house of Commons, in an adjournment of six
weeks, was imprisoned; and at the recesse of the said Parliament, upon
complaint of the Commons, the fact being censured in the house of Commons and
transmitted up to the Lords, the Lords asked the opinion of the Judges, the
Judges answered they had no power to judge of any Act of the house of Commons,
but were subject to them, and what the house of Commons should set down was
Law; by which it appears plainly they have power to declare the facts of the
Lord Strafford treason, which I humbly submit to the high Court of Parliament.

And whereas it is observed that all Papists speak well of him and his
actions, it is very likely in recompense thereof he would bring in Popery vi
and armis, having power under his Majesty to raise arms, and all for a
Bulwark to support his greatness, like to that of France.

Now the cause of God is in our hands, which if you omit, you shall never have
the like opportunity to do God and the King good service.

Wherefore my prayer to God shall be to open his Majesty's eyes to see the
danger he and all we are in.

Gloria Deo, Filio, and Spiritu sancto.
FINIS.
