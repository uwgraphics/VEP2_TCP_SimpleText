THE EPISTLE.
Dear Christian, and much esteemed Friend,

Gospel. Phil. 1.5. To edify themselves (or one another) in their must holy

And avouched such whom He has united to himself, and endued with his Spirit,
To be spiritual Is not this more plain and full in the Scripture?
Priests; The Priests of the Lord; And that they shall build and repair; and
men shall call them the Ministers of our God. 1. Pet. 2.3,4,5. Isa. 61.3,4,5,6.

And the Holy Spirit Affirmed to be given to every Believer. To profit withal.
1 Cor. 12.4,7. And that to this end, That the Church of Believers, (or Body of
Christ,) may be knit together, and Is not all this evident in the Scripture?
grow by that which every joint supplyeth. Ephesians. 4.15,16.

And the Grace to Charity put in them moving that way. 1 Cor. 5.11,14. Act.
26.29. And the word of Grace put in them, having that in it that appertains to

mercy shown them, a Pattern to be held forth for others encouragement. 1 Timothy
1.15,16.

For which causes, They are also called Stewards, in whom faithfulness is
required. 1 Pet. 4.10. 1 Cor. 4.2. And the bounds of their ministration set
forth: Every man, as he has received the gift, so Minister the some one to
another; If any man speak; let him speak as the Is not this also the language
and Testimony of the Scripture? Eccles. 12.10.

God gives. 1 Pet. 4.10,11. According as God has dealt to every man the

4.12,13. with Act. 4.19,20. And the Doctrine also appointed them; Even that

In all which respects, The whole Church on Earth, is the light of the World.

Their Authority is from Sure the Scripture shows all this.

And this is that which gives, and confirms Authority to preach the Gospel.

^t for an Office outward, for oversight of See in all this Docter Fulk, in
Ans. to the Rhemists, on Romans 10.15. To say nothing of Mr. Robison, and Mr.
Ainsworth, because they were Separatists. The Scripture shows all this to be
no Novelty, but Ancient Truth.
Brethren, and leading them in order, and Attention to Ministration in such an
Office; The Lord has set some for helps in Government. 1 Cor. 12.28. for which
be has appointed the Election of the Church; And approbation of such in the
Church, as are fitted thereto, without which Call, to assume, such an office,
is not according to God; But with it, To enter such an Office, for any so
fitted, as formerly. Is Landable. But this outward Gall, gives them neither the
ability, nor the authority to Preach the Gospel, for that they had before; else
they erred that choose, and called them. 1 Timothy 3.2. Much less does it
Authorize them to stop the mouths of them that teach right things; but it
outhoriceth them to a more peculiar watch, and to attendance to Preaching to
such. And to lead to Minister, in such and such an approved Order, with such
authority as may be seen. 1 Timothy 3.4,5. 2 Timothy ^. Tit. 1. And this full for the
furtherance, even of there brethrens usefulness in gifts. 1 Timothy 4.12. 2 Timothy
2.3.

And this being so plain in the Scripture, and so suitable too, and set forth
in the Gospel of Christ; (...), How any such as profess themselves before
others, in the knowledge of the Gospel, and says in Christ, should be so
ignorant hereof; As that with pretense of C^nscience of an outward Call (though
such, as on the turning the wind, they can renounce also,) To quench the
Spirit in Believers, and prohibit their obedience to the Commandments of God,
and the grace and Spirit of Christ: And as many as do not obey them, rather
then, yea against God, To call them Seducers, and Creepers into Houses: But
Satan, that taught that Man of sin to put the Name of Bishops upon
Tyrannical worldly Lords, and Governors, and to put the name of Church upon
such an order, and Assemblies of Court, and Convocations, as were worldly, and
yet neither Church, nor Common Wealth; and to put the name of Godliness, and
Religious Devotion upon Idolatry and Superstition, and the Name of CHRIST upon
Antichrist. 2 Thessalonians. 2.4,12. Coloring all this with confession of some part
of Truth, The more reddily to deceive, and cast the aspercions of Heretics and
Seducers on true Believers; even this deceitful Serpent, when he can no longer
prevail in this way, can then more secretly wind in himself into some, under
pretense of zealous Renouncing all these usurped Titles, and Courts, and gross
Superstitions, Pressing on in the same pride, To the same power and
Lordlinesse, in a more godly way. Joh. 3.9,10. And so still cast the same
aspertions on all that stoop not to acknowledge such Excellency and Authority
in them, as not to pass their limits: The name Bishops, or Elders, with their
Office; The Assemblies of Christians; The Counsels of Elders and Brethren, and
every godly Person of, or among them, are good, and to be reverenced, and no
whit touched here; Nor are Independants, here countenanced; God only is
Independent; and in respect of Christ, and submission among men, I know none,
unless it be the Pope, and such as he, and the Counsel of Trent, and such as
they. As for true Churches, whether wanting a Presbytry, as those of Corinth,
or having a Congregationall Presbytry, as those of Philippi, or both, that an
Overseer over diverse of them, as in Ephesus and Creet; I reverence them all;
but Satan, to put any these names on wrong Persons, is usual. Rev. 2.9. and
3.9. 1 Cor. 11.3. etc.
So that we still need to pray that prayer, Tell me where thou feedest, etc.
Cant. 1.7. And to observe that direction. Matt. 7.15,16. Ye shall know them by
their fruits, etc. Their Doctrine, and the favor, and end of their Doctrine. 1
Cor. 12.1,12. And to keep that charge, Believe not every Spirit, but Try the
Spirits, etc. 1 John 4.1,2,6.

And for that end, To the Law, To the Testimony, etc. Isa. 8.19,20. Knowing
that none can prove an Heresy by, nor vent it in a plain saying of Scripture,
but they must add or diminish, werest and Gloss, to make a seeming Proof, And
we having that help herein. Joh. 10.4. 1 John 2.20,27,28. Let not men's easting
an ill name on the Truth, or any part thereof, or on the Servants of it. This
has been an ancient trick of the Devil, and his servants, Joh. 8.48. Act.
28.22.
Nor their putting the name of Truth upon error, sway us: But search the
Scripture; And this Scripture, which has been so often abused in your hearing;
some consideration whereof I have presented to you; Try all things, and keep
that which is good; And the Lord seasonably doscover who are Seducers, and lead
us into all Truth; And He ever fill you with blessing according to the Prayer
of his poor unworthy one; and Yours in all Service of Love in CHRIST.

A DISCOVERY OF SEDVCERS, THAT CREEP INTO HOUSES.
A brief View of 2 Timothy 3.5,9.
THe Apostle having forewarned, that perilous Times would come, and shown a
reason why they would be so perrillous; Does here discover one of the chiefest
Perils that would ensue; and that is of the Seducement of some from the faith,
and Love of Christ, and Union and Fellowship with Believers: And herein he
discovers, and sets forth the Seducers; By Showing: 1. Of what sort they
are, and to whom they belong. Of this sort are they, Which 2. Their way of
Attempting their Business; They Creep into Houses, 3. Their work which they
do they imbondage. And lead Captive 4. In, and with whom their work prevails,
Silly women, laden with sins, lead away with diverse Lusts, ever larning, and
never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth. 5. The manner of their
working to Accomplish their business. Now as James and Jambres withstood
Moses, So do these also resist the Truth. 6. The true Charracter of the
Seducers Uncloaked, Men of corrupt minds, Reprobate, or of no judgment
concerning the Faith. 7. The extent of their work, both in what, and in whom,
They do but trouble, imbondage and captive, they bring none to liberty and
sound Peace, and rest in Christ.

They lead captive none but such unstable ones.

They shall proceed no Further. 8. The Issue of their business, when they come
to Attempt delivery from bondage, and Tender freedom in Christ; And when they
deal with established believers. Their folly shall be made manifest to all
men, as theirs also was.

1. Of this sort are they;] Compare Mat. 23.14,25. with 2 Pet. 2.1. and Joh.
5.7,8,9. and it confirms the same.
That is, Such as are branded with diverse of the former evils; Covered over
with a form of Godliness, a show of Love, and Zeal, and Devetion, accompanied
with much Praying, Fasting, Preaching; Strict in outward Observation of
Sabbath's, and severe prosecution of circumstantiall things. Romans 10.2. Matt.
23.14.27. Luke 18.11. But have not the Word of Reconciliation in their heart,
and the Spirit of grace therein, writing the Epistle of Christ in their heart,
and so leading them in a Christ-like mind, To move others to be reconciled to
Christ, as the Servants of Christ have. Joh. 15.4,7. Romans 8.2,14. 2 Cor.
3.3,18. and 8.14,19. Of these they seem to be; with these they sometime are,
from among these they come; but of them they are not. 1 John 2.19. But of the
former sort, to whom they belong, and with whom they are, (and ought to be)
numbered; Which.

2. Creep into Houses,] This is their way, they subtly, and secretly, and by
degrees, creep, or wind themselves into houses; Two things are here to be
rightly Understood; First, What is here meant by houses; and Secondly, what is
meant, or intimated in this Word; Creep into.

First by houses, is here meant Churches, or Societyes of such as do believe,
and make Profession of the Gospel: (For the Apostle was before directing
Timothy about the Doctrine, suitable to be in, and to build up the House of
God. Chap. 2.1,20,26.) Warning him of some that had departed from the Faith,
and overthrown the Faith of some, Chap 3.18. and of some to be recovered,
Verse. 25, 26. And here fore-warning of suchlike Perils; He to admonish
Timothy, minds him of his own example. Chap. 3.10,11. in Doctrine, and life;
Now then, of what houses are here meant, is easy to discern; So Wisdom has
built her house. Prove. 9.1. And whose house we are. Heb. 3.3.6. A spiritual
house. 1 Pet. 2.5. Now as this great house is one, and called the Church of
Christ. 1 Cor. 12.28. So, the particular Congregations, societyes, or Famillies
are called Churches, and here houses. Gal. 1.2.

Secondly, By this word Creep, is meant, and intimated three things, about
their incomming to be Teachers in such Societies or Houses.

1. Their want of Authority, and coming in at the door; They have not the
word of Grace put into their hearts by the Spirit of Christ, and so have not
been in the Heavenly Call chosen out of the Condition, and fellowship of the
world, into union and fellowship with Christ, and his Chosen ones, and so have
not the Spirit of Christ to move, and lead them forth in that Christ-like mind,
and Charity, as all his servants, whom he sends, have. 2 Cor. 3.2,3,18 and
4.6. and 5.14.18,19,20. 1 John 1.1,2,3. As the will and Appointment of the
Father. ( Heb. 10.1,10.) is that Door, by which JESUS CHRIST himself entered;
for Jesus Christ himself is the DOOR of the Fathers Will, and Appointment, by
which all Acceptable entrance in to God, or the house of God is. Joh. 10.2.7.9.
and 14.6.

And this spiritual making known of the Father, and Christ; so as thereby to
draw out of the World, and bring into Christ; and then giving in the word into
the heart, enabling with the heart to believe unto Righteousness, and with the
mouth to make confession unto salvation, in CHRIST his opening of, or putting
in any by the Door. Joh. 17.38,8. Romans 3.10.

To such, he has given Commission to declare the Gospel, and for such He has
prayed, for their Sanctification, Preservation, and prosperous blessing in
their Ministration of the Gospel, and he has given his Commission, and prayed
for such blessing in Ministration, for none but such as these, none that yet
remain in the Condition of, and fellowship with the world. Joh.
17.9,14,18,20,21,23.

And therefore such as are not thus fitted, warranted, and led by Christ, that
they may say as Paul. 2 Cor. 5.14,18,18,19,20. They have no commission from
Christ, nor do they come into the house by the Door; But run without his
sending, and clime up, or creep in some other way; Though they be called
Prophets. Jerem. 23.14,21. Joh. 10.1.

2. By creeping, is also meant their subtilty in hiding their Doctrine, and
minds, with cloakes of guile, till they be received; And that is two ways.

I. In hiding their grand opinion of slighting the Foundation and Cornerstone;
The Vision of all, and preferring some other Doctrine before it. Isai.
28.12.14,16. and 29,10,11,12. Psalm. 118.22. Act. 4.11,12. 2 Cor. 2.17. and 4.2.

II. In hiding their Intention, and Issue that will follow on the receipt or
their Teachings, which is to unsettle, and pervert them from the simplicity
that is in Christ. 2 Cor. 11.3,4.

To bring them in some Bondage under the Law of works. Gal. 1.6. and 4.21.

To take off their Affections from spiritual Teachings, and sincere Preachers
of the Gospel, and to gain their Choice Affections to themselves; and so to
subdue them to their own Judgments, that they might be Lords of their faith.
Gal. 4.17. All which till they be received; they color over, and hide with
good words, and fair speeches. Romans 16.17,18. Pretenses of Zeal, Love, and
Devotion. Col. 2.18. 2 Cor. 11.15. Promises of great Seize, and liberty.
2 Pet. 2.19. 2 Cor. 11.3. Pretenses of Spirit, and wresting words of Scripture,
and counterfeiting, as if the sinceere Preachers of the Gospel, said as they
do, and had so written. 2 These. 2.2. And through this subtilty, they wind and
creep into houses, or Societies of Believers.

III. By creeping is here meant, and intimated also, some neglect, and
oversight in the Believers, especially the Multitude of them, who if they had
dilligently heeded the foundation, and the savor, and Teachings of that
Unction they received from Christ, and kept full estimate thereof; They might
have seen the Darknnesse and unlikenesse of: the Teachings of these creepers
thereto, and so how there was no need thereof to them. 1. Joh. 2.19,20,27. Gal.
3.1,2. Cor. 11.4. Gal. 2.4. Jude 4. And so had they consulted with Christ, and
resorted to their overseers, while the Church of Believers had the Power of
Choice, and the Choice was of men, taught of God.

The Church then, as the woman clothed with the Sun, etc. Rev. 12.1. Such
might have been kept out, though in such time, when the outward Court is left
to the Gentiles, and the man of fin gets his seat therein, and gives forth his
Laws; Then are the houses so weakened, That these Seducers come in openly
enough, and the Witnesses Prophecy in Sackcloth; And so the peril greater.
Rev. 11.2,3.

And the Apostle does not Prophecy: That in a full and outward sense, in those
times they shall Creep, but says, That of that sort, there were in his own
time, that did then creep; For surely, else they had not been then admitted in
the outward Assemblies of Believers to be Teachers, as in the evil times
foretold they may; Though into the more special fellowships of Believers; They
are fain't still to use their Creeping.

3. And lead Captive,] This is their business, and the work they do, and the
effect of their Teachings; After they are received, and begin to be
entertained, and esteemed, which they labored for; and then they begin to
discover something plainly their opinion, and intention, They then Lead
Captive, they withdraw from simple and unfeigned Faith, and Confidence in
Christ, and rejoicing in him only. 2 Cor. 11.3. Phil. 3.2,3. They pervert, and
Trouble the minds of those that were inclined to the right way. Gal. 3.3,5. and
4.21. and 5.1,4,8. and 6.12. Prove. 9.15,16. And so entangle them with bondage
under the law of Works; then they under them, to their own judgments,
exalting themselves, as knowing high things, and persuading their Disciples,
that in submission to them, they shall attain perfection in holiness, and
great Liberty. Gal. 4.17. 2 Cor. 11.15. Gal. 3.1,5. 2 Pet. 2.19.

And so they lead them Captive; This is their: work, and their business, and
the effect of their Teaching.

4. Silly Women, laden with sins, lead away with diverse Lusts* over learning,
and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth,] Here the Apostle sets
forth, with whom these Seducers prevail, and who, and what they are that are
seduced by them, and he sets them forth by diverse Charracters meeting together
on them. Viz. If they are filly women, so called; not so much in respect of the
sex, (as if all, or only females,) as in respect of their weakness, in not
standing against the force of Assaults, and suffering themselves to be overcome
by such seemings, and shadows, to part with that wherein they had seen and
tasted substance, whether Male or Female; All is one; in reproof of their
weakness, they are called women; For however in Nature, and in Humane, and
Moral respects, there is male, and female, and which grace destroys not, but
orders. Ephe. 5. and 6. Yet in receipt, and enjoyment of the grace of God by
union in Christ. There is no difference between Male and Female. Col. 3.10,11.
So the like may be said in respect of folly, weakness, and loss by departing
from Christ to another Doctrine. Gal. 5.4. And so these seduced ones, both
Male, and Female, are called women, because of their fillynesse, (Women not so
able ordinarily to see and know the worth of a rare and rich Pearl, and
Jewel, as men,) Why is there a price in the hand of a fool, to get wisdom,
and he has no heart. Prove. 17.16. Besides the over-readinesse to believe
every word without trial. Prove. 14.15. and herein their weakness, as Ezekiel. 16.
When God had done so much for them, And yet they were drawn away by vanity.
verse. 13. How weak is thine heart, says the Lord, seeing thou do all these
things, The work of an Imperious and Whorish woman; (yet were they both Male
and Female.)

And so when the mighty are taken away, and babes and children rule the people.
Isai. 19.16 Jer. 30,37 and 51.30. Isa. 3.3,4. It is called Women ruling over
you. Verse. 12. And so on the other side. 1 Cor. 16.13. Watch ye, stand fast in
the Faith, quit you like men, be strong, was spoken to all the Believing
Corinthians, Male and Female; as here for sillyness, and weakness, in being
turned from substance, by others holding forth shaddows, both Male and Female,
are called Women.

2. They are laden with sins, which cannot be understood of going on in
diverse open and known froms: for that would not have stood with the form of
godliness in these Seducers, who would scarce vovchsafe an open corverse with
such, especially in their Religious Discourse; Nay, they will fault others for
such conversing with them. Mat. 9.10,14. Joh. 7.48.49. But they are laden, and
oppressed, and burdened with the risings, and motions, and Accusations of
sins, that by the strength they have from the Law, Domineere in the
Conscience: That they are fearful, not able to look up beleevingly, and take
quiet in Christ. 1 Cor. 15.56. Romans 6.14. Though they have been lovingly
envited thereto. Matt. 11.28. And they have heard of the great love of God in
the gift of his Son; The salvation and Peace that he has made, and the life
that is in him; And that in believing, they shall Receive Remission of sins,
and Eternal Life; and been helped to believe, and like this report; yet to
believe in him, and quiet their hearts in him: They dare not; They cannot; oh
the secret thoughts of Worldliness, uncleanness, wrath, discontent; yea Pride
and Atheism, with some motions and Temptations thereunto! Oh the hardness and
Impenitence of heart! The deadness too, and wanderings in Prayer, hearing the
Word, etc. And till they be more humbled, and purged, and better quallifyed,
and enlarged, They Dare not; They cannot, They will not believe in Christ: And
though in the Gospel it be testified to them; That if they did so honor him in
the word of grace, or report of the Gospel: They have heard, and in some
measure believed, as to believe, and quiet their hearts in him, and accept
Christ for Remission of sins; Righteousness, Holiness, and life; They
should not only receive Remission of sins by the Spirits application of his
blood, but also purging, and operations of Spirit, that would humble, renew,
sanctify and confirm them to Christ. Isa 28.12,16. and 30.15,16,18. Joh.
7.37,38,39. 2 Cor. 3.3.18. Tit. 3.4,5.

And that till they first believe in Him, These things will never be rightly
wrought in them. Joh. 15.4,5. Yet they say, They must have them first, before
they can believe; And though in attention to the word of grace; They have met
with some sweet tastes, and hints of ease, and Refreshing, encouraging to
believe, and diverse examples of others, as much laden as themselves, in
believing helped: yet may they be complained of. How long will it be ere they
believe? Numb. 14.11. This their unbelief, their great sin, that holds them
under all their other sins, is yet least complained of; but the former is
their burden, whence they are ever, and anon in heavy Doubts, and fears: And
these are apt for the Seducers, with their form of godliness, and Precepts,
and law of works to work upon; promising them great Freedom that way, and in
mean season, That their troubled condition is better then theirs, that are so
confident, and that the Doubting faith is the best faith; And so these so laden
with sin, are most easily captived by them.

3. Lead away with diverse Lusts,] This is that which made them so weak, and
gives such an Advantage to the Seducers, to captive them, and that through
which they are led away; They have diverse lusts; They have a lust or desire,
that God would approve and speak Peace. They would have Eternal Life, though
they do not wholly submit to the way. Mat. 19.16,27. Joh. 5.40.

They also desire to be approved of such as have taught the Gospel to them: And
they desire to be approved of these Seducers, because of their form of
godliness, and zeal, and pretense of strictness in duties, whereby they fault
all that are not as they. Thus loving the praise of men, and seeking
Approbation from them, and not singly that which comes from God alone: This
diversity of their Lusts stops them from believing in Christ: And turns them
aside from those that speak only in his Name. And apts them for Seducers that
speak of themselves, and so they are led away. Joh. 5.4,44. and 7.46,53. and
12.42,43.

4. They are ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the
Truth:] They are ever Learning, often hearing, and questioning about the truth of
the Gospel, that sets forth Christ; But they receive not the love of the Truth,
They accept it not, that Christ in the Gospel offers them; That in letting
go other delights, ways, and confidences, casting themselves on him in
believing, they shall find in him, and receive through him pardon,
justification, renewing, sanctification, etc. which not Accepting, they are in
stead of believing, still questioning, and asking both of one, and another of
the Children of the Freewoman, and of the Children of the Bondwoman; And so
abiding under the Accusation of sin by the Law; or if some ease, yet lusting
after Approbation on both sides; They so entangle themselves; That they are at
no time able to come to the knowledge of the Truth; and so fits themselves for
delusions. 2 Thessalonians. 2.10. 1 John 2.19,20,27,28.

That in Jesus Christ, there is a Redemption wrought, and Life obtained, and
that only through the freeness of his grace; in believing in Him, Remission
of sins, and Justification is received, and he righteousness to the
Believer: some of them in some measure understand, and rejoice for Gal. 3.1.5
and 4.15.

But that he is Sanctification to the Believers, and has taken on himself, by
Spirit, to work Salvation in them; To purge, renew, sanctify, and perfect all
that concerns them. 1 Thessalonians. 5.24. Isai. 26.12. Psalm. 138.8.

And that in believing on him, so as through the belief of his grace in the
former; They are united to him in Dependence on him, for the latter; They shall
receive it, and he will effect it in due season. Romans 4.24,25. and 5.1,11.

This full form of CHRIST is not in them; They are no whit experimented in
this Knowledge; nor so persuaded of the truth, whence they are ready to receive
the Doctrine of the Seducers, to attain this Sanctification by Works, and
observances of the law of Works. Gal. 4.19. and 5.1,5,8. and 1.9. 2 Cor. 11.15.

And these weak unsettled ones are they, with whom the Seducers prevail.

5. Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses; so do these also resist the
Truth;] This is the manner of their working, for accomplishing their business,
in which, two things are observeable. Viz.

1. That they resist the Truth; That is the Gospel, and the Truth of CHRIST in
the Gospel: yet rightly to understand this business, we must distinguish, as
the Apostle does, between the time in which the Apostle wrote, and while they
and their Laborers watched over the Churches, while Antichrist could get no
seat, nor Authority, so much as in the outward Court thereof, In which time
were yet some perrills by these Seducers more secretly creeping in. v. 6. 2
These. 2.7,8. 1 John 2.18,19. And the times of which the Apostle prophesyeth. v.
1. chap. 4.3. In which through the Gentiles coming into the outward Court,
Antichrist should get a seat, and Authority therein. Rev. 11.1.2. 2 These. 2.4.

And so the Seducers come more openly, and boldly. 2 Thessalonians. 2.10,11. being also
more evil, growing worse, and worse. 1 Timothy 3.13. and so the times more
perrillous. Verse. 1. Chap. 4.3.

In the Apostles times; they did not deny the extent of the Ransom, nor
Justification freely by the grace of God in Christ, by faith only, to be
received, (as the Pharisaicall Did,) but only the so freely preaching the
Gospel to All men before; or having fellowship with them, and they not yet
undered to the observances of the Mosaicall Law. And also, denying
Sanctification of Body and soul, preservation in Grace, Conformity to Christ,
Justification of uprightness to God, and so growth to perfection, to be had by
Faith, in Dependence on God in Christ, for effecting it, without being undered
to the works of the Law, for that business. 1 Thessalonians. 2.1 6. Gal. 2.9.20. and
3.1,2,3,4,5. 2 Cor. 11.3,4,15.

And in denying both these, they denied the Truth; even the Gospel, and Christ
in the Gospel, and so the power of godliness.

But in the more perrilous times prophesied of; They will proceed further; many
denying both these parts of truth, which they confessed: some denying
Justification before God, to be only by grace received by Faith; Affirming it
to be by man's own works, together with Faith. 1 Timothy 6.6,7. 2 Timothy 4.3,4.

Others denying the intent of the Ransom; According to the plain Affirmations
of the Gospel; And thereby shutting the door of Repentance against most men,
and so teaching them to deny the Lord that bought them. 2 Pet. 2.1,2.

And both sort denying that Portion of the Spirit, given with supernatural
light, motion, and power to teach, and witness the things of Christ; and work
his mind in the Believers, which he gives since his coming in the Flesh. 2
Pet. 1.19. and 3.17,18. 1 John 3.24. and 4.1,6. Jude 19.

2. That they resist the truth; as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses. First;
In their pride, and high-mindednesse (as the Magicians thought by Enchantment
to do as much as Moses by the Power of GOD; so) they presume, by their fleshly
Wisdom and Knowledge, to set forth the meaning of the Gospel, and the ways
of God, as much, and as well, as those that are through the word of Grace
enlightened, and taught of God, and have the word of Grace, and experiments of
his goodness in their heart. Joh. 11.12. Col. 2.18. Revel. 9.1,2.

Being ready to reply against the Teachers of the Truth, as Zedekiah, the son
of Chenaanah. 1 King. 22.24. Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to
speak unto thee?

Secondly; By their subtilty, and craft, in use of their fleshly wit, and
skill; As the Magicians, when Moses used only the Word of the Lord, and held
forth his Rod: They used sorceries and enchantments; So when the Servants of
God use nothing but Scripture, and Scripture Interpretations, and hold forth
the Word of Life in, and according to the plain sayings of the Gospel; These
Seducers make use of humane, and fleshly Wisdom, and use the entising words
of man's Wisdom. 1 Cor. 2.1,4.

And not allowing the Gospel to be delivered, understood and believed, as it is
in the still and plain sayings thereof; And ashamed with plain and open face;
(few so brazen-faced,) to deny, and contradict the same; To help all, and
color their opposition, and deceive their hearers; They frame out of it, here
a Precept, and there a Precept, one unto another, To teach and enjoyne, and
then add here a line, and there a line, one upon another, to comfort. Isai.
28.12,13. And having in their heart no Gospel that is full, true and certain,
to Preach plainly, and positively, as true, before men believe; That for the
goodness and truth of it, men might believe. 1 Cor. 9.26. Nor liking it, that
others should have such a Gospel, and so preach it; They are full of subtle
Questions, and surmizes of absurdities; if the plain sayings of the Cospel be
understood in their own expressions; and therefore devise them another meaning,
with their fair glosses. Mat. 22,23.28. 1 Timothy 1.6. 2 Timothy 2.14.16.

And thirdly; with this their pride, and cunning, they counterfeit by their
Teachings, the doing of the same things, that the servants of the Truth in
their Ministration do, as convincing men of sin, making them to loath earthy
pleasures, bringing them to much fasting, Prayer, Zeal, and many duties. Romans
10.3. 1 Timothy 1.7.

And so beguile, and deceive many: And lastly, they get into, and have
Authority in great Men's, and Princes Courts, and by all, seek to hinder People
from acknowledging the power of God in the Gospel. Act. 13.8. even as the
Magicians did with Pharach, and the Egyptians, whence also these Seducers are
compared too, and called in the Scriptures, Inchanters and Witches. Isa.
8.18,19,20. and those that are seduced by them are said to be bewitched. Gal.
3.1.

6. Men of corrupt minds, reprobate (or of no Judgment) concerning the
Faith.] Here is the true, and plain Carracter of these Seducers, however they
cloak themselves, in which two things are observable.

1. They are of corrupt minds, and that both in the conception, and inclination
thereof.

First, In the conception of their minds; They are corrupt, in that.

I. They think that their Humane, and Artificial Knowledge, Wisdom, and
Prudence, in the livingnesse thereof, is an help, and handmaid meet to be
Sanctified, to help to find out the Spiritual Knowledge of the Deep things of
GOD, that are in CHRIST, to bestow on his Chosen, contrary to the Testimony of
the Holy Ghost, That says; They are only discerned by the enlightening, and
Revelation of the Spirit, and that that other Wisdom, and Knowledge shall be
confounded and brought to naught, before they can be rightly used for ex^ssion.
Matt. 11.25. and 16,17. and 21.16. 1 Cor. 1.19,20,27. and 2.^.9,14.

II. They think, the only necessary way for them to Prosper in their
Ministration, is to be Alive, and have great esteem in the hearts of such as
hear them, for great Learning, Knowledge, and Skill, contrary to the
Judgment, and experiment of those taught of GOD, who have Abased themselves in
that respect, and affirmed that when Death wrought in them, life wrought in
others. Prove. 30.2,3. 2 Cor. 4,5,12.

III. They are not of one mind; some more gross, as the Saduces, and some more
refined as the Pharisees in their conception of the way.

Secondly, In the inclination of their minds, not to exilt Christ only, but
themselves, as Lords and Rabbyes, liking it best that the People should rest on
their Judgments for points of Faith, and interpretation of Scripture, and not
to presume to know beyond; contrary to the Upright, that were not content, till
they knew as themselves knew, and had their evidence from God, that they might
not depend on them, and would have them still be trying by Scripture, and wait
for that Knowledge; and rejoiced when they had it. 2 Cor. 4.5. Joh. 3.29,30. 2
Pet. 1.18,19,20. besides the glary, honor, wealth, and great places, they
Desire, and seek for themselves. Gal. 4.17.

From which corrupt Minds, proceed their corrupt reasoning, and Practice;
First, Their corrupt reasoning, and Arguments: can it be, that so many great
Learned and Godly Devines, Ministers, and Professors, Annas and Cayaphas; The
high Priests; The Priests and Elders; The Scribes and Pharisees, that sit in
Moses Chair; and all their Disciples, whom the great Church so long
Reverenced, should be ignorant of the Truth, and err; and that a Carpenter,
the Son of a Carpenter; and a few Fishers, a Publican, a Tentmaker; men that
are Gallileans, whom scarce any follow, but the common Illiterate People, that
know not the Law, should k^w the mind of God, and be in the Truth? Joh.
7.47,52. As the Antichristian Brood reason.

Is it likely so many Godly Fathers, Divines, Bishops, Counsels, The great
Church for so many Hundredth years; should err, and a few despised upstarts
should be in the Truth?

Secondly; Their corrupt practice of worshipping Angels, (Messengers,) Adoring
these great learned Officers, as if they could not err; and so to be Depended
on for all knowledge, and certainty of the word of Truth, not presuming to
know; but what they have declared, nor looking for further light then in their
sayings; And so calling them the Church; Thereby (as their Fathers the
Pharisees of old, shaddowed Christ, with two heads, by having two High
Priests,) making Christ two Bodies, or Churches, one Spiritual; another
Secular, one of the Clergy; another of the Laity; one of Public Officers, and
Members, Another of private members, without Office, that the one may depend on
the other, and neither hold the head, and both neglect the True Body. Col.
2.18,20. Contrary to 1 Cor. 12. Chap. like that 1 Cor. 1.12.

2. They are Reprobate, and of no judgment concerning the Faith concerning
Letters, Tongues, Etimology of words, Philosophy, Logic, diversity of Books,
Histories, Genealogies, Morallities, To move subtle Questions; To answer
knotty Questions; To Dipute about Law, etc. They may be of great skill. 1 Cor.
1.19,20. 1 Timothy 1,2.

But concerning the Faith, in that they are of no judgment; whether we respect
the Doctrine; and object of Faith, or the Spirit, Grace, and opperation of
Faith: For; How all men should be reconciled to God in Christ, and yet most men
in themselves, and their own hearts, enemies to Christ, and so to God still? 2
Cor. 5.19,20. How Christ should have paid the price for, and bought all men
into his dispose, and yet justly Judge many of them to eternal Death? Romans
14.8,12. How enough should be done for All men, by Christ, that they might be
saved, and yet many not infallible, atternarly saved? Joh. 3.17,19. How man
being dead in sins, etc. And having no Power or freedom of will, to choose
life, and yet so much done by Christ, to make his Will free, That the fault of
his not being ^lly saved, should be found in his own will, and not in the Will
of God, and Christ? Joh. 3.17,19. and 1.9. Prove. 1.23,26. Ezekiel. 18.23.32. and
33.11. How there should be such a Will in God, To have all men saved, and then
brought to acknowledge the truth; And that Christ should Accomplish this his
will, and condemn any to Eternal Death? 1 Timothy 2.4,5,6. 2 Pet. 2.1.

How God should Order all things in his Counsels, and work all things
according to the Counsel of his own Will; and yet not so necessitate any to
destruction; But that their destruction is of themselves; They loose their own
souls, and bring upon themselves Destruction? Ephesians. 1.11. Hos. 13.9. Mat.
16.26. 2 Pet. 2.1,2.

They cannot rightly conceive, or declare: Again, in the distinction, the
Spirit in the Scripture makes between the Salvation, Jesus Christ wrought in
his own body with God for men. 1 Pet. 2.24. And the salvation which in
Application of the former; he by his Spirit works in men to God. Revel. 5.9.
2 Cor. 5.18.

The Salvation he came down from heaven, and was abased to work, that he might
bring us to God. Joh. 16.28. Heb. 10.1,10. 1 Pet. 3.18. And the Salvation, he
ascended to heaven, was glorified to Work, in making sons, and bringing them
to God. Psalm. 68.18.20. Act. ^5.31.32. Between the diverse ends of Christ, in
laying down his Life. 1. To be a Ransom, and Propitiation for sins. Heb.
9.22. Romans 3.24,25. 2. To seal, and confirm the New Testament of Precious
Promises. Heb. 9.15,16,17. 3. To be an example to us of Sufferings. 1 Pet.
2.23. And the different extent of these ends. 1 John 2.1,2,3.


And between the mission of Christ, To be the Savior of the World, in Dying,
and giving himself a Ransom for All. 1 John 4.14. Joh. 1.29. and 3.17. and
his Mission to Preach the Gospel, and confirm it with Miracles, which was to
the Jews, and for the Circumcision. Matt. 15.24. Romans 18.8,9.

Between his giving Himself to die, and offer Sacrifice, and his giving himself
to Advocate, and apply the virtue of his Sacrifice. 1 Timothy 2.6. 1 John 2.1,2.
Ephe. 5.25,26,27.

Between his Purchasing of his Father, by bloodshedding. Romans 14.9. 2 Pet. ^.1.

And the Purchasing from among men, by his spiritual Application of his blood
that was shed. Rev. 5.9. Act. 20.28.

Between that which is full, complete and true, in Christ for All men, That
they may believe, and in believing, receive it. Romans 3.23,25. and 5.18. 1 John
5.10,11,12. And these high and peculiar Privileges in Christ, further to
dispense to such as through grace, are enabled to Believe, Joh. 1.12,13. and
7.36.39. Yea, between the extent and scope of the general Affirmations of the
Gospel, as Propositions for Faith in the Third Person. Joh. ^.19. ^. Tim. 2.6.
and Applicative Affirmations, in First or Second Person. Romans 8.3^. Gal. 2.20.
In all, or most of these Distinctions, they are ignorant, and confound them in
one, as of like large extent; whence issues their setting the Scriptures at
vaviance, to be reconciled by their prooflesse Glosses; And their corrupt
opinion, that all Christ dyed for, must of necessity be eternally saved, and
their false conjectures and Reports of those that believe CHRIST gave himself a
Ransom for All Men, as that they hold men by nature to have Free Will; or that
Men may live as they list, etc. And as they are thus void of Judgment about
the Doctrine, and object of Faith; so also about the Spirit, grace, and
opperation of Faith. How by the very evidence of the Spirit, in the appearance
of Grace, manifested in the Blood and Sacrifice of Christ; and fullness in him;
A man should be overcome to believe, and therein receive remission of sins,
Peace with God, and hope, without encouragement from any works, frames, or
quallifications of his own, or use of humane reasonings, or thoughts to help to
faith. Tit. 3.4,5,7. Ephesians. 2.8. Romans 4.25. and 5.1. 2 John 3.5.

How through the Spirit, in this very believing, a man should be brought to
depend on Christ, for subduing lusts, and Satan, for Sanctification,
preservation, in grace; The precious Promises, and eternal life, without his
own humane reasonings, workings, and self application of Promises. Romans 5.11.
1 John 2.24,25. Zach. 4.6,7. Gal. 5.5. 1 Thessalonians. 5.24.

How in this confident Believing, the Spirit writes the Law of grace in the
heart, and by Discovery of glorious Grace in Christ, Takes off from earthy
Excellencies, Melts, Humbles, Renewes, and Conformes to the likeness of
Christ, and fills with spiritual motions, and fruits, leading into all Truth,
and unto all Services of Charity, without a man's own helpfulnesse of him by
workings after the Law of works, and yet with no contrariety to it. Phil.
3.3,9. 2 Cor. 3.3.18. Gal. 5.16.18,22,23. and 6.8. Joh. 16.13,14. Romans 8.2.14.

How by abiding in this Faith, love shall work out all righteousness, that law
requires in a free bringing it forth, and the Believer grow in Sanctification,
and fruitfulness, without being undered to the Law of Works, to bring it
forth; Yet having Commandments as Servants, to Order the exercise of Charity.
Romans 13.10. 2 Cor. 5.14. Gal. 5.13,18. Joh. 15.1.10. Of these things they are
ignorant, and of no Judgment, whence they make use of Arguments and Reasons,
from frames, and quallifications to make up Faith. 2 Cor. 10.7.12.18. And turn
aside to be Teachers and imposers of the Law, for Sanctification. 1 Timothy
1.5.6,7.

That nothing be said of those higher, and more mysterious Communications of
Spirit, through Faith, in which the Believer is brought to see within the
Veil, To receive the heavenly Oracles, To see unexpressible beauty, and
receive unutterable entercourses of Love, etc. 1 Cor. 2.9. Phil. 3.20. Cant.
1,2, etc.

The very uttering of the experiments whereof; These Seducers are such
Strangers to them, that they count them follyes, call them Sattannicall
Delusions, and Enthusiasmes, and Distempered Frenzies. Joh. 7.20. Act. 26.24. 1
Cor. 2.14.

And thus are they marked out, To be of corrupt minds, and of no Judgment
concerning the Faith.

7. But they shall proceed no further;] Here is their period, or full stop: The
extent of their Work; Both in what they shall do, and with whom they shall
prevail, to seduce and lead them captive.

1. The utmost of their Work, is but to trouble, and convince of sin, To
press to Duties, and help to such hopes as are still under question, and in
the Issue, gender to bondage, and Captive to the Judgment of the Seducers:
This is the utmost of their work; That they may be still admiring, and relying
on them also. Gal. 4.17.22,31. and. 5.8,12. Romans 7.9. Phil. 3.1,2,7.

But receipt of Spirit, and freedom in Christ, and experiment of fellowship
with Christ, is not received in their Ministration. Gal. 3.1,5. and 5.1,3.

2. The utmost of their prevailing, is only with those that are yet unstable
in the Faith, and lusting after approbation of men; whence, as those that are
stable, and steadfast, are likened to men, and called men. 1 Cor. 16.13.

So these unstable Ones, that are turned aside, are compared to Women, and
called Women; And so the Apostle Intimates the Gallatians turning aside, to be
for want of the form of CHRIST, in them. Gal. 4.19. And prefer faith; they
are such as are unlearned, (not taught of God: as Isai. 34.13,17.) And Unstable
(in the Faith,) That pervert the Scriptures, to their Destruction; And such
they are, that fall from the Doctrine; In which their steadfastness is, and
might be attained; and are so carried away with the error of the wicked. 2
Pet. 3.16,17,18.

With none but such shall they prevail; They shall proceed no further.

8. But their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was;] Here is
the last Issue of their business; And that is, when they still attempt, as the
Magicians Did to proceed to do the same things that God by his servants does:
Their folly appears.

1. In their Attempting so to preach Gospel, as to bring their seduced, and
Imbondaged from their bondage, and into the Kingdom, and Liberty of CHRIST;
There they fall short, and turn aside to vain Janglings, Fables, Genealogyes,
and strive about Words, saying, and affirming, that they understand not; and
are in many things, ever and anon unsaying again. 1 Timothy 1.6. and 4,7. and
6.4,5,20. 2 Timothy 2.14,15. Wherein their folly becomes manifest.

2. In their deasings with those, who experimentally know, and are established
in the Faith; they both fail of their purpose; and their folly appears to
them, and may by them be made manifest to others; and in due season shall be
manifest to All Men. 1. Joh. 2.18,28. Isai. 60.14.

And thus, as this place may be found opened by, and agreeing with other places
of Scripture, are these Seducers discovered; that they may be known.

Yet I know, There is one exposition of the Word Houses here, by which, some
would turn all aside: Namely.

That by HOUSES, are meant PRIVATE-HOUSES, or men's Divelling Houses, built of
Timber and Clay, Lime, and stone, etc.

Though I suppose, they conceive these to have their Denomination from the
house, household, or Family Inhabiting in them, else what means that, 1 Cor.
1.11. Them of the House of Cloe. And again, Though such Houses, as they speak
of, have been, are, and may be Preached in; yet consider.

I. What Divinity is in this Interpretation; when the Apostle is treating of
the House of GOD, and the Doctrine and behavior therein, and of the evils of
Seducers in the same, to understand houses so grossly? 1 Timothy 3.15. 2 Timothy 2.3.

II. What Christianity is in this Interpretation, To lay down a sense so to
condemn some, as they therein condemn Christ Jesus, and his Apostles, and
Disciples, who as they Preached the Gospel in the Temple, and Synagogue, so
they did Preach in men's houses also; and from house to house. Mat 9.10.17 and
12.46.48. Act. 5.42. and 20.20. Yea, in their own houses. Ioh. 1.39.43. Yea,
even hired houses.

III. Let this Interpretation be granted; yet there is neither Wisdom; nor
Truth in their Application of it.

For first, Reason would tell a man; That these Seducers so careful of their
honor, and safety; would not commit Buglary in breaking into men's houses; nor
as Thieves, creep in at the windows, nor as silly ones, come in secretly, by
the inletting of false servants, nor yet without the Invitation and Admittance
of the Governors of those Houses: And then they are false witness bearers;
which in such a sense say, They creep in: And

Secondly; The truth is, The Apostle says, Houses; Adds neither men's Houses,
nor private Houses, and what are they that add, or take away from the words of
Scripture, as the Devil did in his Allegation thereof. Deuteronomy. 4. Matt. 4.6.

And is not the public place, where People meet to Worship God, called a house
also. Joh. 2.16.

And are not such as have not not the Word of Grace in their hearts, and so
want Authority from heaven, and secretly get outward Authority, and come into
these Houses, (without the foreknowledge, and desire of those that maintain
the same, and meet therein,) to be their Teachers; Creepers into Houses?

And can they that have the Word of Grace in their hearts occasionally
Declaring it; not presuming to be Teachers in these Houses without a lawful
outward Gall? Act. 13.15.

Nor in private Houses, without the Admittance of the Governors of those
houses. Act. 10.33. Be said to creep into Houses, let either right Reason, or
Religion judge this, and how contrary it is to. 1 Pet. 2.2,3,4,5,9.

And as for this Gross Interpretation, for a mis-application, to condemn the
use of Spiritual gifts in Believers fellowship in the Gospel, in Declaration
of the same, and praying together in men's houses; Is it not contrary to the
Spirit of Christ. 1 Cor. 12.7.

The Practice of Christ and his Apostles; The end of Christ, his Assention, and
giving of Spirit. Ephesians. 4.7,12. and the growth of the body. verse. 16.

Does it not sad the hearts of Believers, and strengthen the hands of
unbeleevers? Ezekiel. 33.3,22. Who receives it, does not the World? 1 John 4.5.

Does it not occasion some that sit in the gate, to speak and do that they
should not against Believers, and the Drunkards to make songs, and the
Hypocrites to make Jeasts of them, and the Abjects to rave against them? Psalm.
69.7,12. and 35.15,16.

And while they would by this means engrosse all to themselves, and exalt
themselves, as the only Teachers; Is not that verifyed in their teaching, that
is Prophesied. Ezekiel. 34.1,6.

And are not their common Approvers, those Prophesied of. 2 Timothy 4.3,4.

And let but this corrupt Interpretation, and mis-application be rejected: And
then this sense of the Word Houses, may be added in the second place to that at
first mentioned; and stands well for receiving all that is said about this
business: Let the Scripture be viewed, and so the place considered: And then
let any, that will not wilfully blind themselves, consider, and give Answer, as
in their own Conscience and Judgment, they conceive; And say.

1. Who, or of what Number are these Seducers to be reckoned? and of what sort
will you count the Seducers? whether of those That 1. Love their own selves,
such as are their Friends, of their own sect and opinion. Matt. 5.43,44. Or,
that 1. Love all men, till they become of the Serpentine seed, though enemies
to them, yet pitying them, and seeking their good. 2 Cor. 5.13,15. 2. Mind,
and count earthy Riches, Honors, and Preferments. 1 Timothy 6,5. Phil. 3.19,20.
Romans 8.5,6. 2. Mind, and seek the things that are above, spiritual and
heavenly. Col. 3.1,2. 3. Are Boasters of their Sect, and of their Knowledge,
parts, places, holiness, and Authority. 1 Cor. 11.18. Jer. 9.23. Isai. 65.15.
3. Are Abasers of themselves, in respect of all such humane things. Prove.
30.2,3. Act. 3.12. 1 Timothy 1.13,15. 4. Are proud, conceiting themselves better,
wiser, and holyer then others, standing upon their parts, and places. Ioh.
7.48,49. Luke 18.11. 4. Are humble, conceiving themselves no better then
others; standing on no strength, but the Free Grace, Spirit, and Power of God.
Romans 3.9, 2. and 1.3,5. 5. Are Blasphemers of the Free Grace, and Doctrine, and
plain sayings of Christ in the Gospel, and those that believe, and hold forth
the same. Joh. 14.24. Mat. 27.63. Act. 26.24. and 28.22. 5. Are magnifyers of
the grace and Gospel of Christ, and the truth of his sayings, and blessers even
of them that Persecute them. 1 Cor. 15.14. 2 Cor. 13.8. Romans 12.14. 6. Neglect
natural duty to Parents, under pretense of Religious Acts. Mat. 15.4,5,6. 6.
Are careful by all well-doing, to gain in, even their unbeleeving Parents.
Romans 9.1. 1 Cor. 9.22. 1 Timothy 6.1. 1 Pet. 3.1. 7. Are unthankful to GOD for
his Love to mankind, and those that bring the tidings thereof among men, and
for those that receive the same. Joh. 10.32. and 7.48,49. Psalm. 2.2,3. 7. Are
thankful for the Gospel, declaring this love to mankind, and for those that so
preach it; And for those that do receive it. Romans 1.16. and 6.17. Col. 1.4,5.
8. Are unholy, or profane, Despising their birthright in the Gospel, and
living to themselves. Heb. 12.16. 8. Are holy, in high estimate of the Gospel,
