Grace imprisoned, and Virtue despised.
C. R. in the Isle.
O Heavens! and dares an earthly power confine
My Sovereigns Head? and are my senses mine?
And is he wise? must heavenly Wisdom dwell,
Prefined to the Limits of a Cell?
Why, why O God? but thou are just, and he
Immured becomes a Sacrifice for thee.
In vain ye Rocks with his sweet groans distill
Some Nitrous drops, in vain my ruder quill
Laments the sad incloystering of a King,
So glorious in Religious suffering:
While Cherubims with Heaven-borne power dispose
His Excellent soul, to an eternal close.
Perhaps we sin in lifting up a prayer,
That Holy CHARLES might be restored to Air,
God is not pleased to afford th'ungratefull I Will;
One sweet reflex by his anointed smile.
Never e're this did Tyranny imblock,
Such Royal virtue in so hard a Rock.
Is this Religion? tell me, tell me then
What is impiety? and when
Black sin is acted with advisement? where
Men do undo themselves, and others swear?
Behold invassa'ld to a dismal Tower,
A Trinity of virtue, blood, and power.
Subjectively that last, a lawful wreath,
Bound to his Temples by Celestial breath.
Spawne of litigious zeal! you may as soon
Discardinate the Spheres, catch stars or Moon,
Discompose Heaven it self, as Vote down
The uninterrupted title of a Crown
So fortified, see how diviner powers
Beget him friends in these unhappie hours!
And what by force God pleased not to confer,
CHARLES shall atchieve by being Prisoner.
Why do I beat the Air? or doubt the Pitch
Of happiness to him, who is so rich
In liberty, no cruelty can stay
His hearts Embassage to the milky way.
No threats, unsettle whom Angelick breath
Has qualified for either life or death.
