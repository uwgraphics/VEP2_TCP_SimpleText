THE CHARTERS OF LONDON: OR, The second Part of Londons Liberty in Chains
Discovered. In which by the ancient, rational, and fundamental Charters of the
famous City of London, is proved and declared, that it is the true and
undeniable right of all and every the Barons, Burgesses, Freemen, or Commoners
of London, to have their free (...) in choosing out, annually from amongst
themselves, a Lord Major, two Sheriffs, and all their Aldermen; which Aldermen
are annually to be removed by the Commons of every Ward; and being removed, may
not be chosen again for the ensuing year, but others by common consent are to
be put into their places. Also it is declared, to be the right of the said
Barons or Common to choose the Bridge-masters, Chamberlain, Common-Clerk, and
Common-Sergeant, etc. of the City of London, and to be removed by them when
they please. All which privileges, with many others, they are now robbed of, by
their last incroaching, and usurping, illegal Lord Majors and Aldermen, etc.
Unto which Charters (...) annexed, a Discourse, to prove, that though Kings or
Parliaments may confirm unto the people their rights, freedoms, and liberties;
yet it lies not in their poweer to take them from them again when they please;
no, not at all: because all be trusted powers are (as both Kings and
Parliaments, and all other Magistrates whatsoever are,) and ought always to be,
for the good of the Trusters, and not for their mischief and hurt. In which is
also proved, that all Pattentee-Monopolizing-Corporations ^e against, and
destructive to the fundamental Laws of England; and that it is impossible for
justice, peace, or prosperity, to flourish in this Kingdom, till they be all
abolished. With diverse other things worth the knowledge of all the Freemen, not
only of London, but of all England.

For whose good this is published by Lieut. Col: John Lilburn, prisoner in the
Tower of London, for the common liberties of the Kingdom against the
usurpations of the House of Lords.

Deuteronomy. v. 17.19. But he shall learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the
words of this Law, and these Statutes, to do them; that his heart be not lifted
up above his Brethren, and that he turn not aside from the Commandment to the
right hand or to the left.

Reader, the shortness of time, the absence of the Author, and the difficulty
of the Language in the Charter, not being ordinary Latin, but such as Lawyers
use, which is so far above my capacity, that caused me to err when I used the
best skill I could in my Art. Pardon me therefore (I pray thee) and with thy
wisdom, learning, and good disposition, help me in this case. And for the
faults in the English, the meanest capacity may be helped thus:

To the Commons of London, commonly by the prerogative men thereof, called the
Clokemen of London.
FEllow Citizens, I read in the 1 Kings 21. that when Ahab though a King came
unto honest Naboth, not by his prerogative to take his Vinyard from him, but to
desire it of him (for a garden of herbs, because it was near unto his House)
for a valuable consideration; Naboth returns his King this Answer, the Lord
forbid it me, that I should give (or part with) the INHERITANCE OF MY FATHERS
UNTO THEE; Therefore much more I hope, without offense may you and I say to our
prerogative masters of London, who have already robbed us by their mere
prerogative pleasure (although they be far inferior to the King) not of our
Vinyard, (a small thing in Comparison) but of our natural, rational,
national, and legal liberties, and freedoms, and so as much as in them lies,
have made us slaves and vassals to their wills and pleasures: by means of
which they do lay oppressions and burdens upon us, able to break the backs of
Pack-Horses themselves, and therefore seeing the knowledge of it in some
measure, is come to our understanding, and daily every day more and more is
likely so to do; I hope it will be no blasphemy against God and the King, nor
an Act deserving Naboths portion, to be stoned to death; to say unto our
prerogative, usurping, and incroaching Masters, God forbid, that we should be
such villains and traitors to our selves, as to suffer you to rob and steal
from us (and run away with) the inheritance of our Fathers, and the Birthright
of us and our children) our Fundamental Laws and Liberties, Franchises and
Privileges, that God, Nature, and the just Customs of the Land in which we
live, has given us, and for which we have been fighting above this 3. years.
For my part, though all of you should be so sottishly base, and ^ardly, (...)
to (...), and like Issac (...) ^uch under your burdens; yet though I should
not find one man amongst you all of my mind, I am resolved to send the loudest
Hue-and Cry after them that possible I can, for the regaining of my Liberties,
Freedoms, and just Privileges; though I should by the iniquity of the present
forsworn, tyrannizing, oppressing, and invassalizing times, pay as dear for my
so doing, as Naboth did for his unwillingnesse to part with his Vineyard his
Inheritance.

My Hue-and-Cry after these London prerogative Robbers, I begun in my late
book, called LONDONS LIBERTY IN CHAINS DISCOVERED, printed in October. last: the
second part of which Hue-and-Cry this present discourse is; But here I must
crave leave to acquaint you my fellow-Citizens, that by (...) of those many
difficulties which accompany the Press (wh^ makes their proceedings very
slow) my present Hue-and-Cry cannot be so loud, as I intended it, because I
would fain have you to have the sight of so much, as herein you shall read,
before the day you choose Common Council men; after which, you may ezpect an
APPENDIX to this Discourse of some length, and also, all the rest of your
CHAPTERS at large, with observations upon them, deducted from the Fundamental
Laws of the Kingdom: in which Discourse, you shall find such a pack of juggling
knavery, as your eyes never read before.

Only this at present, I shall desire you to take notice of, that the
City-prerogative Champion, Irenaeus Lysimachus, the Author of the rotten and
putrified book, called Bellamius Enervatus, and Col. John Bellamy (a kinsman to
the Wethercocks) in his late Answer to the said book, called Lysimachus.
Enervatus, Bellamius Reparatus, and in his Plea for the Commonalty of London,
spends much pains, pro and con, to find out, whether or no the L. Major, and
Aldermen of London have an absolute negative voice in the common Council; both
whose Discourses do not at all please me, nor show the true rights and
privileges of the Commons of London: and therefore, I shall lay down this
position, and challenge all the City-prerogative-Champions, to a single
combat, to make it good against them all; the Proposition is this, that the
present Lord Major, and the present Court of Aldermen have no right at all, to
give any vote at all in the Comon-Councell, of so much as to be present there:
And my Reasons are these that follow:

First of all, the present Lord Major is no legal Lord Major, nor the present
Aldermen, no legal nor true Aldermen, and therefore have no true right at all
in any sense to come there; out as Delinquents to receive condign punishment,
by being disfranchised for their usurpations and encroachments, as by the
Charter of Edward the 2. they ought, page 30, 31, etc. And that the Lord Major
is no legal Lord Major, I thus prove.

First, because by the 4. Charter of King John granted to the BARONS of London
(which is every Free man) in the 9 of May, in the 16. year of his reign; and by
the Charter of Henry the 3. which you may read in the following Discourse, page
28. 29. there is power given to the BARONS OF LONDON, that they may of
themselves, choose from amongst them (...) Major, which privilege is confirmed
by K. Ed. the 2. at the earnest desire of the Major, Aldermen, and the rest of
the Citizens; as you may read in the 30. page following and which privilege is
confirmed to a^ the Citizens of London, by Magna Charta, chap. 9. and 1. E. 3.
9. 14. E. 3. 119. H. 4. 1 and by the statutes of Edward the 1. called articuli
super chartas, chap. 1. in which statute is also a power given to the
Commonalty in every Shire Court, to choose the Justices of the Peace for their
respective Counties; which said Commons have power by the statutes of the 18.
E. 1. 8. and 13. chapters, to choose their own Sheriffs in every Shire; and
this manner of popular elections is granted to be the right of all the Freemen
of London, by both the forementioned Authors. But this Lord Major is not in
the least legally chosen. Read the forementioned first part of this
Discourse, page 8, ^, 13, 14, 15. Ergo, he is no true nor legal Lord Major:
And the same I say of all the Aldermen.

My second reason to prove the forementioned Proposition is this, because that
if the King have no legislative power in himself, as the Parliament proves in
their Declarations of the ^. May, 1642. and 2. November. 1642. and which begins
in the^ (...) of the collection of Dec. page 262. 686. and which Mr Pryn much
more praves in the second part of his Sovereign power of Parliaments, p 73, 74,
75, 76, 77, etc. which book is published by special authority from the House
of Commons, as appears by the Title page thereof: now if this be true, then I
affirm, he cannot give or depute a legislative power to the Lord Major, and
Aldermen of London; no, not to his Lords, who pretendedly call themselves the
Upper House of Parliament: for it is impossible, for him to give that to
another, which is not inherent in himself: But the Lord Major and Court of
Aldermen, for any thing I can perceive, either by their Champion, or any other;
lay no claim to their pretended power of voting to make Laws in the
Common Council; but the authority of the prerogative-Charter of Edward 3.
which in such a case is not worth a button.

My third reason to prove the proposition is this; because the only and sole
legislative Law making power, is originally inherent in the people and
d^vatively in their Commissions chosen by themselves by (...) consent, and no
other. In which the poorest that lives, has as true a right to give a vote, as
well as the richest and greatest; and I say the people by themselves, or their
legal Commissions chosen by them for that end, may make a Law or Laws to
govern themselves, and to rule, regulate, and guide all their Magistrates
(whatsoever) Officers, Ministers, or Servants, and ought not in the least to
receive a Law from them, or any of them, whom they have set over themselves,
for no other end in the world, but for their better being, and merely with
Justice, equity, and righteousness, to execute the Laws that they made
themselves, and betrusted them with, as the public executors or dispensors
of. But the Lord Major and Aldermen (admit there were no exceptions against the
manner of their coming into their Offices) were never chosen by the Commons of
London, not in the least, to set in Common Council to vote and make Laws to
bind them, but merely, and at the most, are Officers chosen and betrusted for
no other end at all, but for the better being, peace, and prosperity of the
City, to execute the just Laws of the Kingdom already made in Parliament, by
common consent of the whole Kingdom; and therefore have no right at all in no
sense, to set in Common Council, there to vote, and make Laws to bind the
Citizens. And therefore, O my fellow-Citizens, I desire you to be wise, and
look about you, and not suffer these Mungrell, usurping, incroaching,
pretended Aldermen, to Lord paramount it over you, as they used to do at your
election of your Common Council men: at which election, (for any thing I know,
or can hear of) they ought not to be present at all, unless they come as
particular citizens to give a single voice, in choosing their (as well as your)
Common Council men, whose principal office and work it is by virtue of their
deputed power derived from you, to call all your City Magistrates, Ministers,
and public servants, to an account, and to dis-franchise all those that have
endeavored the destruction of Londons just liberties, and to know of them what
they have done with those many hundred thousands of pounds, that yearly is paid
into the Chamber of London, which ought principally by right to be laid out to
pay or defray the public charges of the City, and taxations of the City that
are laid upon it by common consent in Parliament, (...) spent in hugger-mugger,
and lai^ out for such (...) and put into the pockets or purses of such, as it
was never (...) for. Look to it you Lord Major and Aldermen, brethren in evil:
for I profess there is the most notorious juggling and cheating amongst you,
that is amongst any generation of men in England; which I hope, in the despite
of you all, to live in some good measure to anatomize to my fellow-citizens,
whom, before I conclude, I shall desire to take notice of four things, as the
most pestilent evils in the world, amongst the sons of men, and they are
these:

First, the Popes unwritten ^ties. Secondly, Kings unlimited Prerogatives.
Thirdly, Parliaments unknown Privileges. Fourthly, the Lord Major, Court of
Aldermen, and the rest of the Prerogative men of Londons implicit faith, who in
the second desire of their most pernicious Atheistical, Papisticall
Remonstrance, page 7. would have all those fully declared against, and some
effectual course settled, for proceeding against all such persons as will not
be conformable to the public Discipline established, or to be established.
What ever it be, it matters not, although it be never so much against justice,
reason, equity, conscience, and the word of God.

By means of some of these four, arises all those Monopolizing and engrossing
Patentee corporations, that trouble the world: this poor Kingdom; yea, even
this City, a great number of whose members, by reason thereof, are (as I am
informed) forced (...)

But (...) you (my fellow-citizens) seeing your Common (...) upon them to be

pro com. utilitate habitantium in civitate illa, and confluentium ad eandem

elici, and eos in quibusdam corrigi fecimus, prout inferius inferuntur
videlicet. quod major and Vicecomites Civitatis praedictae per Cives ejusdem
Civitatis juxta tenorem cartarum progenitorum nostrorum quondam Regum Angliae
eis inde confecta tum eligantur, and non alio modo, and quod major Civitatis
praedict. in officio Majoritatis illius ultra unum annum simul non moretur. Et
quod nullus Vicecomitum Civitatis illius qui pro tempore erunt, habeat nisi
duos Clericos, and duos servientes ratione officii illius, and quod tales
clericos and servientes sibi, suo periculo assumant, pro quibus voluerint
respondere. Et quod Major Civitatis praed. dum Major fuerit, non habeat aliud
officium ad Civitatem illam spectans quam officium Majoratus ejusdem, nec sibi
attraliat seu coram ipso teneat placitum vicecomitale in Camera Civitatis
illius, nec alia placita quam illa quae secundum antiquam consuetudinem
Civitatis praed. tanquam Major tenere debet. Et quod Aldermanni Civitatis
illius de anno in annum, and praecipue die sancti Gregorii Papae, per dictam
Co^munitatem sint amobiles and amoti anno seque^ti, non re-eligantur sed loco
amotoru^ alii eligantur per easde^ Gardas de quibus sic amoti Aldermanni

Civitatis non admittantur sine assensu communitatis civitatis illius, and illi
qui in libertatem Civitatis illius, postquam regimen regni nostri suscepimus
contra formas praescriptas, sunt admissi and qui contra ipsorum iuramentum, in

de Apprenticiis in eade^civitate observentur modus and forma antiqui civitatis
praed. Et quod singulis annis in praed. civit. quociens opus fuerit inquiratur
si qui de liberate ejusdem civitatis de bonis aliorum, qui non sunt de eadem
liberate in civitate illa mercandisas excercuerint bona illa advocando propria
sua esse contra ipsorum juramentum, and contra libertatem civitatis praed, and
illi qui inde legitime couvicti fuerint; libertatem ejusdem civitatis amittant.
Et quod omnes et singuli in liberate civitatis praed. existentes and
libertatibus ac liberis consuetud. ejusdem civitatis gandere volentes sint in
lotto and Schotto and participes omnium onerum pro statu ciuitatis ejusdem, and
pro liberate ejusdem manutenendum juxta sacr. quod fecerunt quando ad
libertatem illam admissi fuerunt, and qui hoc noluerit; libertatem ejusdem
civitatis amittat. Et quod omnes and singuli de liberate civitatis illius
existentes and extra eandem civitatem manentes, ac per se, vel per suos,
mercandisas suas infra dictam civitatem excercentes sint in lotto and scotto
cum communariis ejusdem civitatis pro mercandisis suis praed. vel alias a
liberate sua amoveantur. Et quod common sigillum civitatis praed. in custodia
duorum Aldermannorum and duorum aliorum communariorum per communarios civitatis
illius ad hoc eligendorum remaneat and quod sigillum illud non negetur
pauperibus nec divitibus communariis de civitate praed. cum indiguerint dum
tamen rationabiliter probare poterunt causam suaedema^dae and quod pro
appopositione sigilli illius nichil capiatur. Et quod redditiones judicioru^ in
caria civitatis illius and praecipue post veredictum inquisitionum captarum in
casibus ubi inquisitiones captae fuerint, non retardentur nisi difficultas
intervenerit, and si difficultas intervenerit; propter hoc non remaneant ultra
tertiam Cur. faciendae. Et quod pondera and staterae de mercandisis inter
mercatores and mercatores ponderandis de quibus exitus provenientes and
cognitio eorunde^ ad co^munitatem civitatis praed. pertinent in custodia
proborum and sufficientium hominum de eadem civitate in officio illo expertorum

hospitatores in civitate praedicta, and suburbiis ejusdem, quam vis non sint de
liberate civitatis illius, sint participes onerum per dictam civitate^ pro
statu ejusdem manutenendo contingentium quamdiu sic fuerint communes
hospitatores sicut caeteri hujusmodi hospitatores in civitate and suburbiis
praedict. ratione hospitalitatum ill^rum participabunt: salvo semper quod
Mercatores de Vascon and alii alienigenae in dicta civitate ad invicem habitare
and hospitati possint prout hactenus facere consueverunt. Et quod custodi^

The Charter of the second year of King Henry the fifth, Part. 2. No. 11.
Of the Confirmation of London.
THE King to them before said Greeting. We have understood and seen a Charter
of Lord Henry our father late King of England L: Henry made in these words,
Henry, etc. We have seen also the Tenor of a Charter of Lord Henry sometimes
King of England our Progenitor.

Hen. 1.
Henry by the grace of God, King of England.
To our Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bishops, and Abbots, and Earls, and
Barrons, and Justices, and Sheriffs, and all other his faithful French and
English of all England,
Know ye That we have granted to my CITIZENS of LONDON, to hold Middlesex by
Farm for 300. l. upon account, to them and their heirs of me and my heirs;
So as the said CITIZENS shall appoint a Sheriff whom there they please of
themselves, and a Justice whomsoever and what person soever of themselves they
please, to keep the Pleas of my Crown, which are to be pleaded for the same;
Note this 1.
And none other shall be Justice over the men of London, and the CITIZENS shall
not plead without the walls of London in any plea, and they shall be
discharged and free of scot and lot of daneget and of murder, and none of them
shall make war. And if any Citizen be impleaded upon pleas of the Crown,
(by oath that he was adjudged in the City) a man of London may discharge
himself and within the Walls of the City, none may be lodged, either of my
Household, neither by other force delivered to any, and all men of London shall
be discharged and free (and all their goods) throughout all England and
Seaports of Toll, and passage and Lastage and all other Customs, and the
Churches and every the BARRONS and CITIZENS may have and hold well and in
peace their Sokes with all Customs, so that strangers that do lodge in the
Sokes, shall pay no Custom but to him whose Soke it is, or to his Servant whom
he has there placed, and a man of London shall not be Judged in the
amercements of money, but according to custom (to wit) in 100. s. I say the
pleas which concern Amerciaments and miskenning or false Judgment shall not
be any more in hustings nor in folkemote, nor in other pleas within the City,
and the hustings shall sit once in a week (to wit) on Monday. And I will cause
the CITIZENS to have their Lands and Pledges, and what is due unto them within
the City, and without, And I will do right to them by the Law of the City for
the Lands which they claim of me, and if any shall take Tole or Custom of my
CITIZENS of LONDON, The CITIZENS of London in the City may take of the Borough
or of the Town where the Tole or Custom was taken so much as the man of
London for Tole gave; And moreover, for his damage which he shall receive, and
all debtors, who owe debts to the CITIZENS of LONDON shall pay them in London,
or shall discharge themselves in London that they owe not, but if they will not
pay the same, nor discharge themselves; Then the CITIZENS of LONDON of those
that owed them debts, may take their Pledges or Distresses in the City of
London, of that Borough or village, or of that County in which he abides who
owes the debt. And the CITIZENS of LONDON may have their Chases to Chase, as

A Clause of the 11. of King HENRY the Sixth.
The King
to the Major and Sheriffs of London, greeting.
WHereas, by the Charters of Our Progenitors, formerly Kings of England, WHICH
WE HAVE CONFIRMED. It is granted to Our Citizens of Our City aforesaid; That
they may choose Major, and Aldermen of themselves, when they please, and
present them to Our Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer, if we be not there,
That they may be allowed there, as the manner is; And now we have understood,
that although is has been accustomed in times bypast, such Elections to be
made by the Major and Aldermen and more discreet men of the said City, for the
same purpose specially summoned and warned;

Nevertheless, some who have no Interest in such Elections, nor ought to have
Interest in those Elections, but with a rash boldness behaved themselves, do
mix themselves in, and many ways hinder and trouble those Elections (which
should be orderly and peaceably made) with their strong and importunate
clamours: to the end, that such may be chosen, who afterward may favor their
wickedness and errors; to that intent, the same be passed unpunished: Which
if it should be suffered to be done, would manifestly tend to the dishonor of
Our Crown and Dignity: as also, the subversion of the state of the City, and to
the trouble and commotion of our Citizens there; We therefore willing (as we
are bound) to provide for the quiet and tranquillity of the people, which are

Witness the King
at Westminster the 7. day of October.
BY THE COUNCIL. This agrees with the Record. William Colet.
8. October. 1646.
This prerogative Proclamation is no Act of Parliament, but only an Act of the
King and his Council, and so of no Authority at all in Law and Right to null,
make void, abridge, or overthrow the Liberty of the Citizens, Barons,
Burgesses, or Commons of London, that is, their native and natural Rights, and
which is established unto them by the Fundamental Law of the ^and, as their
popular and universal elections is; yea, and which their right so essentially,
undoubtedly, and firmly, that I say, and will venture my life upon it, to make
it good; that neither King nor Parliament, divided nor conjoined, cannot justly
take away from the Citizens of London, or any other Citizens in England, their
general, universal, and free voting, in electing of their Major, Aldermen,
Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Recorder, Chamberlain, Town-clark,
common-Sergeant, Bridge-master, common council men, constables or any other
Officer whatsoever that is amongst them particularly to officiate as
Magistrate; for though it be, that Kings and Parliaments may confirm unto a
city or people, their Fundamental Rights and Liberties, that so they may with
more peace, quietness, and freedom enjoy them; yet when they have so done,
they cannot take them away again at their pleasure; no not at all, without the
contracting unto themselves the odious names of Tyrants and Oppressors; for the
Parliament by their own doctrine, (Book Dec. page 150.) are betrusted by the
people to provide for their Weal, but not for their Woe: So that by right,
they cannot make the people less free then they are, or were, when they found
them; but may make them as much more free, as possible they can: and if a
Parliament or any other betrusted Power, should be so unnatural, as to turn
the strength of their Power to ruin, overthrow and destroy the Liberties of
those, that empowered, or betrusted them; What does this else, (by their own
doctrine in the forementioned page.) but instate the people the impowrers or
betrusters, into an absolute condition of disobedience, or non-observance of
the Precepts, Orders, Injunctions, or Commands of their empowered Trustees, or
Magistrates? unless we think, that obedience ties men to destroy themselves,
and their Fundamental natural Liberties and Freedoms; the enjoyment of
which, makes them to differ from bruit and savadge Beasts which were never
created with reason and understand that glorious Image, that God made man in,
and so made him Lord over all the creatures in the world besides himself; but
not in the least, to Lord it over his brother man, without a special
assignation and mutual assent and agreement, for the better bearing each of
other; and suitable to this, is that assertion of the Parliament, in their
Declaration; that all Offices of trust, are, and ought to be for the good of
the Trustees. But extraordinary great are the evils and miseries, that this
poor Kingdom suffers by Pattentee-corporations; which, at the best, are but an
indennizing of a few, to undennise a many, And to speak properly, England
being a Kingdom governed by one Law made by universal and common consent (at
least in pretense) in one Parliament; all these Pattentee-corporations of what
kind soever, are most illegal, wicked, and Devils make-bates in the Kingdom,
which will never thoroughly and truly enjoy peace, quietness, and tranquillity
till they be all utterly anniholated and abolished, and therefore for the
further manifestation of their illegalitie, and the evil that accrue by them
to this poor Kingdom.

I judge it not amiss, in the first place, here to insert; Mr. Tho: Johnson
Merchant his late printed plea, for Free-mens Liberties, which is a most
excellent piece, and worth the serious perusal. His Preface to all the Commons
of England, thus follows:

The Preface to all the COMMONS of ENGLAND.
WOrthy Freemen of England; The former public Magistrates of this Kingdom, by
their Machivilian empoysoned principles and specious pretenses of common good,
(whereas nothing less was intended) have most cunningly and fraudulently
cozened you of your native freedoms, (which by the fundamental laws and
constitutions of the Kingdom, ye were born unto) and secretly by wicked
Pattents have stolen away your Birthright, to set up the particular and
self-interests of private societies: One of which I here present to your
serious consideration, as a great grievance and burden, under which, the
honest Clothier especially, and thousands of poor people groan: ye know for
what this Kingdom has almost been wasted to ashes, ye have spent so much of
your estates and blood, viz. the subjects liberty, to which all civil
government is subservient. My advice to all is this, especially the clothiers,
and others who are deeply interessed, that as they love their bleeding dying
Country, their deliverance from so great a thraldom; they would by
petitioning, and all lawful means, be earnest with the Parliament for the
removal of this and all other pressures.

They are bound in duty to God, in justice to you, in dischareg all of so great
a trust committed into their hands; to ease you of all unjust grievances,
intolerable burdens: Be therefore active in the work. For very importunities
sake, your endeavors will be crowned with a happy success, and (if you faint
not) reap the benefit of your labors, which shall always be the desire of him
who is willing to serve you.

April, 1646. THOMAS JOHNSON.

WHosoever surveyes this Island in her radiant and shining luster with
community and freedom, cannot but say, O quant a mutatio! Oh how great a
change! For indeed, this kingdom is a Corporation or Society of men under one
form of civil government, made by common consent in Parliament, who are all
bound by the law, to maintain common freedom, and the general good of each
other.

But particulars, Patent-societies, swelling with a Luciferian spirit, in
desiring to advance into a higher room then their fellows, did by surreptions
Patents incorporate themselves, exclusively became destructive to the whole
body, and subverters of the true ancient privileges of the people. And of all
societies those of Merchants are the worst, having no foundation on the Laws;
The fellowship and charter of those that style themselves Merchants of
East-land, is a Monopoly of this kind, according to the true genuine sense of
the word Monopoly, relating to a private company, who asscribe unto themselves
the sole exercise and benefit of such a Trade, wherein every subject has
equal freedom with them, all which this Monopoly does, and is illegal, being
contrary to Magna Charta, the Petition of Right, Statutes of Monopolies, with
diverse others, and in particular, these three following.

The first is of the 14. of Edw. the 3. 2. Item, where it is contained in the
Great Charter, That all Merchants shall have safe and sure conduct to go out of
the Realm of England, and to come, and abide, and go through the Realm of
England, as well by water, as by land: we at the request of the Prelates,
Earls, Barons, and Commons, will and grant for us, and for our heirs and
successors, that all Merchants, Denizens, and Forraigners (except those which
be of our enmity) may without let, safely come into the said Realm of England,
with their Goods and Merehandize, and safely tarry, and safely return, paying
the customs, subsidies, and other profits reasonably thereof due; so always
that franchise and free customs reasonably, granted by us and our Ancestors to
the City of London, and other Cities and good Towns of our Realm of England,
be to them saved.

The second is of 18. Edw. 3. 3. That the Ordinance made before this time, upon
taking of sorts of wools in every County be wholly nulled and defeated, and
that every man, as well stranger, as privy from henceforth may buy wool,
according as they may agree with the seller as they were wont to do, before the
said Ordinances, and that the Sea be open to all manner of Merchants, to pass
with their Merchandise where it shall please them.

By both these Statutes, it evidently appears, that every Englishman may
transport his commodity without molestation, to what Port beyond Sea he
pleases, and make sale for his best advantage, every Englishman being a native
Denizen, and privie-man of this Kingdom, according to the true meaning of the
law: for it unreasonable to me, that the Law should provide better for Aliens,
then her own Children.

The third is of 12, Hen. 7. 6. viz as follows: To the discreet Commons in
this present Parliament; shows, unto your discreet wisdoms, the
Marchant-Adventurers, inhabiting and dwelling in diverse parts of this Realm out
of the City of London, that where they have their passage, resort, course and
recourse, with their goods, wares, and merchandise in diverse coasts and parts
beyond the Sea, as well into Spain, Portugal, Britain, Ireland, Normandy,
France, Civil, Venice, Danske, Eastland, Freezeland, and other diverse and many
places, Regions and Countries being in league and amity with the King our
Sovereign Lord, there to buy and sell, and make their exchanges with the said
goods, wares, and merchandises, according to the law and custom used in every
of the said regions and places, and there every person freely to use himself to
his most advantage, without exaction, fine, imposition, or contribution to be
had or taken of them, to, for, or by any English person or persons, etc.

By which Statute, all merchants, as well those inhabiting in diverse parts of
the Kingdom, as of the City of London, as also every freeborn subject, is
acknowledged as his Right to have freedom to trade to the said parts
mentioned, and to diverse other regions and countries, without subjection to any
pattent, or paying any exaction, fine, etc.

For in that the Statute says, every person is freely to use himself to his
most advantage, without exaction, etc. to be had or taken of them, or any of
them, to, for, or by any English person, or persons; it clearly holds forth,
that the merchant, and consequently every man that uses comerce to these
parts, ought not to come under the obedience of any oppressing Corporation
whatsoever.

Now Dansk and the Eastland being expressed in the Statute, which are the
principal parts to which these Eastland Merchants are privileged by their
Monopoly; and indeed, the crown and glory of the rest for venting our native
commodities; at also the other included, when the Statute says, and other
diverse and many places, regions, and countries;

I hope every honest man will be willing with heart and hand to endeavor the
recovery of our Birthright, which the Law so evidently makes, our own, from
these unjust oppressors.

2. Contrary to the light of nature, which teaches men to walk by congruity
and equality, not to oppress, because they would not be oppressed, nor to take
away a man's right, because they would not have another use the same measure to
them. Which Principles of nature are engraven upon the hearts of Heathens, who
certainly will rise up in judgment one day against these men, that sell us for
slaves in our own Land.

3. It is irrational: reason being the fountain of honest Laws, gives to
every man propriety and liberty: propriety of interest, freedom of enjoyment
and improvement to his own advantage: from that propriety take away freedom,
and a considerable part is gone: nay we see it by experience, that those who
have bereft us of our liberty, have made bold with our propriety: and indeed,
if Prerogative may take away the one; why not the other (from the same
principles?) So that it appears to be rational, that every native who has
propriety of goods, wares, and merchandise, has freedom to transport them to
any Port beyond Seas, and there convert them to his own profit, it being his
true and proper inheritance so to do. It is very strange to my understanding,
that one man should do the work, and another man receive the wages; I mean,
that the honest Clothier who has toyled much in the making of his cloth, shall
not have the benefit to sell it here for his own gain, or to ship it for more
profit; but being debarred of freedom in both, must make sale to them, in whose
power it is to give him what price they please, whereby he is cheated of the
fruit of his labor.

4. That the Monopoly is against the honor of the Nation; because by it the
people are put in a condition of vassalage in their own country. It takes away
industry the spring of wealth, the hearts of the people being brought to
servility; and not able by reason of this, and other the like Patents, to
employ themselves, cannot choose but procure sad effects, if not timely
prevented; For

5. The Patent was illegally procured by the solicitation of evil Counselors,
under the Broad Seal of England, in the 21. year of the Reign of Queen
Elizabeth; it bring of no longer standing, under specious pretenses, as the
profit of her then Majesty, the good of the Kingdom, etc. whereas by it, the
Natives have been weakened and spoiled, which will easily appear, if we consider
these particulars.

1. By reason of this Patent, thousands of poor people are in a condition of
beggary, who otherwise might maintain themselves in honest Callings, by the
making of cloth, and other woollen manufactures, by Carding, Spinning,
Weaving, etc. And certainly, this one thing thoroughly considered, should stir
up the bowels of every truly-noble spirited Englishman to double his strength
if it were possible, an hundred fold, in all just ways, for the remomovall of
so great an obstruction,

2. The poor Clothier suppressed, none being to trade to those parts but the
Company, THE CLOTHIER MAKES NOT HALF THE CLOTHES HE MIGHT: and for those he
does make, they being of a confederacy, and having all the privilege of buying
in their own hands; by reason whereof, many times he is forced to sell them at
a far less price then they cost him in making, or else to keep them till the
next year, which discourages and slackens the Clothier in the prosecution of
his calling, and causes some to fail, others to give over, and those which
remain many of them scarce can make a living.

3. This Monopoly greatly impaireth the trade of Cloth: those who are
judicious, affirm, that 5000. Clothes more then are, would be made, shipped,
and expended yearly in those parts to which they are authorized to trade to;
which I verily believe, and prove thus: All the cloth they ship, some
extraordinary times excepted, is but to one or two Towns, and there residing
their Factors, who making sale to the Burger, he sends the cloth up and down
the Country, whence arises many mischiefs, the countries not being furnished
as they should, as also the selling at such excessive rates, causes the Dutch
to make cloth in an abundant manner, and to be satisfied with it, though it be
exceeding course. And again, there being diverse Kingdoms, Dominions,
Dukedomes, Countries, Cities, and Towns, to which by their Patent they are
licenced, what advantage would the young merchant have, having so vast a
compass, how active would he be from Town to Town, from City to City, from
one Country to another, and SELLING CHEAP, would invite foreign parties to
set a true estimate upon our native commodities. And certainly were trade free,
Sweedland and Pomerland would vent much cloth; whereas the Company is not able
to satisfy Eastland it self, by reason of the smalnesse of their stock; it
may be easily conceived, that such a small company of Private men, are never
able to suffice such famous Kingdoms and Dukedomes to which they only are
licensed to traffic.

6. It causes a great decay of Navigation, which sustaineth the Mariners, so
that by this and other the like Patents, the Saylor is greatly suppressed.

7. It obstructeth Returns, diverse of the most staple commodities which our
country stands in need of, are imported by them, viz. Flax, Hemr, Potashes,
Pitch, Tar, Course Linen, Packing Canvas, with diverse other very
considerable merchandise: now they bring over when they please, and what they
please, and sell at what price they please, which cannot but have sundry evil
concomitance, 1. Our Country is not satisfied with that variety and convenience
it should: and 2. By reason the Citizen gives such an unreasonable rate to the
Merchant, the poor have all excessive dear, giving half as much more then
the commodity is worth, or then it would be sold for, were the trade but open,
from which and such other dealings it is, that the people are unconscionably
wasted and weakened: and threfore what ere it cost us, lets have this ravenous
patent down: whereby there would be all these six gallant effects 1. Multitudes
of poor maintained. 2. The Clothier raised. 3. The trade of cloth greatly
augmented, by reasons that thousands might be vented more then are. 4. The
number of Merchants increased. 5. The Art of Navigation furthered. 6. And
lastly, an universal benefit to the whole nation, from the plenty of
merchandiz imported, which we should have at far easier and more valuable
considerations.

Object. But if trade be free, the Alien will expect freedom also.

Answ. I see no ground but aliens paying custom, provided always that we
enjoy as full and large privileges with them, they ought to have the like here
with us. But secondly, suppose the State should prohibit strangers yet there is
no shadow or color of right reason, that we who have equal liberties in the
laws, have ve^tured our estates and lives so freely to preserve them, should
be deprived of our true inheritance: and therefore for further satisfaction, I
shall here insert part of their Charter, that every one may judge whether it be
just or no.

Forasmuch as we be credibly informed, etc. that you our Subjects, Merchants
and others, exercising and using the traffic and feat of Merchandise, out and
from any our Dominions through the Sound, into the Realms, Kingdoms,
Dominions, Dukedomes, Countries, Cities and Towns of Norway, Swethia, Poland,
and the territories of the same Kingdoms: as also into Letto, and Liefland,
under the dominion of the King of Pole, Prussia, and also Pomerland, from the
river of Odera Eastward, and also Ry and Revill in Liefland aforesaid,
Kingsbrough, Elbinge, Brownsbrough, and Dansick in Brusia, Copenhaven and
Elsenore in Dansk: except the Nerve, and the territories thereof belonging: as:
also into the Island of Finland, Goteland, Eweland, and Burutholme within the
Sound aforesaid, by one consent are willing to gather, and assemble your selves
into one fellowship, and to be one body incorporate and politic, in deed and
in name; We considering that your purposes in this behalf are very laudable,
do therefore not only approve and ratify the same, but will you to persevere
in your good minds and purposes, to the establishment and perfection thereof,
and earnestly desiring that our Merchants and their successors haunting the
said Kingdoms, Dominions, Countries, Cities and Towns before mentioned, or
any of them, for merchandise, in and through the Sound of the Kingdom of
Denmark (except before excepted) may from henceforth profit and increase as
prosperously as any Merchants of this land have aforetime increased and
profited: And do grant for us, our heirs and successors, that from henceforth
there be and shall be of the said fellowship, one GOVERNOR, one DEPUTY, or
DEPUTIES, and four and twenty ASSISTANTS of the said fellowship; and that
they, or the major part of them may make Statutes, Laws and Ordinances; and
that the aforesaid Governor, or Deputy, or Deputies, and their successors, or
the major part of them; as is aforesaid then present, as often as need shall
be; the said Statutes, Laws and Ordinances, shall and may execute and put in
execution as well within our Realm of England, as within the said Realms,
Dominions, Cities and Countries, and every of them. And for that diverse
persons, our subjects, being not brought up in Merchandise, through their
ignorance and lack of knowledge, commit many inconveniences, we willing to
resist and prevent them, and intending to further the expert Merchant in their
lawful and honest trade: Will and by our Regal authority we command, and also
prohibit and forbid by these presents, that no subject of us, our heirs, or
successors, which is not, nor shall be by force of these presents, made free of
the said Fellowship, shall by any manner of means at any time hereafter,
intermeddle in the trade of Merchandise; or by any means buy and sell, or use
any traffic into the said parts of Eastland, and countries aforesaid, or any
of them, (except before excepted) upon pain to incur our indignation: as also
to pay such fines and amercements, and to suffer imprisonment, and such other
pains due to the transgressors of of the said statutes, ordinances and
constitutions of the said fellowship, or to the said Governor or his Deputy and
assistants aforesaid, shall seem meet and convenient, any law, statute,
custom, or ordinance to the contrary thereof, many other things
notwithstanding, etc.

And do further by these presents inhibit and forbid all and every our
subjects, and the subjects of us, our heirs and successors, not being licensed
and authorized by virtue of these presents, to traffic in and to the said
Countries, Kingdoms, Towns, and places before recited, or use any manner of
trade in or to them, contrary to the tenor of these presents, upon pain to
incur the displeasure of us, our heirs, and successors, and to be fined,
pained, and imprisoned, according to the several discretions and laws of the
Officers of the said former several Companies and their successors.

Witness our self
at Westminster the 17. day of August in in the 21. year of our reign.
I no sooner made a survey of this cruel engine, what intolerable breaches
and in-rodes it has continually made upon us, but was cast into a sudden
admiration, that so free a people as England should suffer themselves so
violently to be ground to powder, which I shall illustrate to be treasonable in
the practisers of it, by these Positions, 1. If to surrender a Castle by the
Captain of that Castle, through fear and cowardice, and not from any
compliance with the enemy, be treason; as was adjudged in the Parliament, 1
Rich. 2. Then is this a treasonable Patent: For besides the place, there is
only a loss of the adjacent parts, but by this Patent our Laws, Liberties,
nay, our very Lives, in pursuance of both the former, are subjected to will and
tyranny, he that walks in the exercise of freedom, according to Law, is
subject to their counter-commands, and to be fined payned, and imprisoned, and
to suffer such other punishments, as to them shall seem meet and convenient.

If to kill a Judge upon the Bench be treason, because of malice, not to the
person, but to the Law; then is this a treasonable Pattent; here is not only a
malice to the Law, but a most butcherly weapon-killing and destroying of it.
These two cannot dwell together; for the life of the patent, so far as it
extends, is the death of the Law, which stops its free course for the benefit
of the people, and makes it merely a dead letter, a carkas without a soul, a
power being given to Mr. Governor and his companions, to make Laws, Statutes,
and Ordinances; which power is more, and far greater, then belongs to the
chief Magistrate to give, or can legally or justly be exercised by any but the
Parliament; and therefore not to be received by any person or persons
whatsoever, and certainly those Laws, and all that Government derived from
Queen Elizabeth's Broad Seal Commission, are according to the lusts of these
men, being extrajudiciall, in that they are above the Sphere of the Law.

Secondly, Contrary to the Law, if the endeavoring the subversion of the
ancient Fundamental Laws and Governmant of this Kingdom, and to introduce an
arbytrary and tyrannical Government be treason, as was adjudged in the case of
the Earl of Strafford, and in the case of Sir Robert Berkly, by the first
Article of impeachment by the House of Commons, July 6, 1641. then is this a
treasonable patent; for here is not only an endeavor, but an actual surrender
of both Law and Government, which have made England a free people; and what
more ancient or fundamental, then those Laws which gratify the Commons; and
by which they enjoy their very lives: Here is an arbytrary Government
introduced, and put into the hands of those whom the subject does not own to
have any right of power and rule; and that in so high a nature, as can be no
less then Monarchical; for what can a Monarchical power be, but to make
laws, and to punish the transgressors according to those laws, by
confiscation of goods, imprisonment, or taking away the life of the vassals:
All which, they do by their patents and certainly this company of Merchants of
East-land, who have practiced arbytrarily for so long a ^me, as they have done,
against the liberties of the natives, deserve for all their cruelties to be
proceeded against as public Delinquents to the State.

3. As touching their Oath, it is one of the worst I am confident) that ever
was made, which I shall here insert for every man's knowledge.

YOu shall swear to be good and true to our Sovereign Lord the Kings Majesty,
and to his Heirs and Successors. you shall be obedient and assistant to Mr.
Governor, his Deputy and Deputies, and Assistants of Merchants of East-land.
All Statutes and Ordinances, which be, or shall be made by the said Governor,
or by his Deputies, and Assistants standing in force; You shall truly hold and
keep, having no singular regard to your self, in hurt or prejudice of the
Commonwealth of the said Fellowship; You shall heal, and not bewray: and if
you shall know any manner of Person or Persons, which intend any hurt, harm,
or prejudice to our said Sovereign Lord the Kings Majesty, or unto his Land, or
to the foresaid Fellowship or Privileges of the same, you shall give knowledge
thereof, and do it to be known to the said Governor, or his Deputy; and you
shall not color or free any Forraigners Goods not free of the said Fellowship:
All which you shall hold and keep to the uttermost of your power, or else being
justly condemned for making default in any of the premises you shall truly from
time to time, being orderly demanded, content and pay to the Treasurer of this
Company for the time being, all and every such mulcts and penalties which have
been or shall be limited, and set for the Trangressors of the same.

So God you help.
Lieutenant Col. Lilburn, in his late book, called Innocence and Truth
justified, being an Answer to Mr. Pryns book, called the Liar confounded, has
these passages, page 53. And in the second place, seeing they know, viz. the
Merchant-Adventurers, That the Petition of Right does condemn the King and his
Privy Council, for making and administering of Oaths not made by COMMON
CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT; and seeing the Parliament, as they very well know, was
lately so angry at the Bishops and their Convocation, for assuming to
themselves the boldness to make an Oath, although they were invested with a
more colorable authority to justify them therein, then those can pretend; how
exemplary ought the punishment of these men to be for their impudence and
boldness, after the knowledge of all this, to force and press upon the
freemen of England, an Oath of their own framing and making, and to keep their
freedoms from them? because, out of Conscience they dare not take them, which
at this present day is the condition of one Mr. JOHNSON, late servant to Mr.
WHITLOCK, one of the East-Country Monopolizing Merchants, which is all one in
nature with the Monopoly of Merchant Adventurers: And not only do they most
unjustly keep my freedom from me, for which I have so often ventured my life
in the Northern service this present wars, and to which, I was born by the Law;
although I have served 7. years according to the Custom of the City of London,
but most inhumanely have taken from me my place of Factorship in the East-land;
and all, because I have rejected their Monopoly and Diabolical Oath: and this
was the gallant service of Mr. Burnel Governor, and his Associates the 3.
October. 1645. but I except to see Justice (that banished exile) return in all
her glory, and these oppressing taskmasters called to a just account: For
certain I am, that the Law never gave them authority to make an Oath, or to
force it upon my Conscience; besides, the Oath contains many perjuries, in
the second branch it ties the swearer to be assistant to Mr. Governor, and his
Confederates, in all their dishonest proceedings.

In the third Branch, to keep all their pernicious Laws and Ordinances; which
Laws and Ordinances are to deprive the Subject of his right; and this will not
satisfy, but to all that are to be made: O intolerable burden! whither will
this bottomless pit go? here is etc. etc. etc. and innumerable company of etc.
In the fourth branch; to keep all their cozening secrets, and underhand
dealings in the pursuance of their patent.

And in the fifth branch, for making default in any of the premises; that is,
for forswearing himself, which he does that keeps it, as well as he that keeps
it not, because he swears not in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness, to
pay such mulcts and penalties which have been or shall be limited and set for
the transgressors of the same, as if such great crimes could be washed away
with a penance: for my part I am clear in this point, that whosoever he be
that bends and yields obedience to this or the like Oath, deserves not the name
of an Englishman: Surely, their designs are (to use the expression of
Lieutenant Colonel Lilburn, in page the 54. of his book, speaking against the
Merchant-Adventurers) to make England a Land of slavery, ignorance, and
beggary, or else a Land of perjury.

I have now learned the meaning of the Scripture, Rev. 13.16, 17. And he
causes all both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a
mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads, that none might buy or sell,
save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his
name: which relates, as I conceive, to all Monopolies whatsoever, sublata causa
tollitur effectus, take but away these Merchants patents, and all other of the
like nature; and there will a sudden way appear to the relief of the honest,
comfort and tranquillity to the whole Nation: for the effecting whereof, if I
shall but irritate the courteous Reader, it is price sufficient for him whose
desire it is not to live, but in the truth.

THOMAS JOHNSON.

But for the further evincing of the illegality of these Patentee-Monopolies, I
shall here insert a case upon the Statute of Monopolies, which was made and
resolved by an able and learned Lawyer and who had not a little share in the
framing and contriving of the said Statute: which case thus follows:

IN the 21. year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, diverse Merchants of the City
of ^ondon obtained a Grant by Letters-Pattents from the said Queen, whereby
they are incorporate by a special name, pro ut, etc. and made a Body politic
to have perpetual succession; with a Grant, that they and their Successors may
use the traffic and fear of Merchandise, out, of, and from any her Majesty's
Dominions, through the SOVND into SWETHIA, POLAND, and other COUNTRIES: which
Corporation is commonly called the EAST-LAND COMPANY, with a Clause in the said
Letters Pattents; that none but they themselves, and such as they shall think
fit (for such Fines and Compositions as they shall impose, and in such manner
and form as they shall direct and allow of) shall trade or traffic through
the said SOVND into the said parts of SWETHIA or POLAND, etc.

In the 20. year of King CHARLES I. S. being a Merchant, Citizen, and Freeman
of the said City of London, but not a member, nor free of the said
Incorporation, nor of the said Eastland Company, provideth English commodities
of good and merchantable cloth, well and sufficiently wrought, dressed and
dyed, and shippeth, or really offer^th to ship the same, to be carried from the
Port and City of London aforesaid, by way of trade, traffic, and merchandise,
through the said SOVND to Dantzick in Poland and makes, or offers to make,
real and due entry thereof in the Custom House of the Port of London
aforesaid; and to pay all Customs, and other duties and fees any way payable
by Law, for or in respect of the shipping or entering thereof.

J. N. by, upon, and in pursuance of a Warrant or Command from the said
Incorporation of Merchants, or Eastland Company, forbids the said J. S. and
the Officers of, and in the said Custom house, to make entry of the said
goods, of, or for the coquetting or customing of the same, and forbids the
Master and Mariners of the ship, wherein the same should be laden or laid
aboard, from taking or stowing them aboard in the said ship.

The said J. S. persisting nevert^elesse in his endeavor duly to enter his
said goods, and to coquet and custom the same, as to law appertains.

The said I. N by pretext of some Warrant, or command from the said
Incorporation, or Eastland Company of Merchants, grounded upon their Grant and
Letters-Pattents aforesaid, seizes upon, takes, carries away, and detaineth
the said goods, against the will of the said I. S. and will not let it pass in
the course of trade, nor restore the same to him, upon, and after reasonable
request thereof made.

The question is, whether the said I. S. may as a party grieved, have his
special action, upon the Stat. of 21. Iac. chap. 3. concerning Monopolies,
against the said I. N. and recover his treble damages, and double costs; yea,
or no.

Upon careful perusal of the said Statute, as well the inducement or recital
thereof, as the body of the same, and the ten several Provisoes therein
contained; I am of opinion, that the said I. S. may have his Action upon the
said Statute against the said I. N. and that he may, and ought to recover his
treble damages, and double costs, according to the purport of the same Statute.

My Reasons are as follows:

First, I hold the said Letters-Pattents of 21. Eliz: for so much thereof, as
concerns the restraint of the Merchants, being Freemen of this Realm, from
lawful trading at their pleasures; to be a Monopoly, or matter tending to the
instituting, erecting, furthering, or countenancing of the sole using of a
thing within this Realm, by some men within this Realm, excluding others
having right to use the same, which is a Monopoly, or tending toward the same;
and so was and is void, by force of the common Law, without the help of this
Statute, which does not in this point introduce or make a new Law; but only
declares, vindicateth, and confirms the ancient Laws of the Land, by
Judgment of the Parliament; as appears by the words of the said Statute in
many places: namely, in the inducement to the body of the Act: in which
inducement, it is recited; that the Declaration of King James, in 1610. (That
all Grants of Monopolies were contrary to his Majesty's Laws) is consonant and
agreeable to the ancient and fundamental Laws of this Realm.

And in the body of the Act, the word [declared] is put before the word
[enacted.]

And the principal words of the Act run thus, viz.

That Monopolies, and all Commissions, Grants, Licenses, Charters, and Letters
Pattents, made, or to be made, of, or for the sole using of any thing within
the Realm, and all Proclamations, Restraints Warrants of Assistances, and all
other matters and things whatsoever, any way tending as aforesaid, are
ALTOGETHER contrary to the Laws of this Realm, and so are, and shall be
utterly void, and of none effect, and in no wise to be put in ure or execution.

Which said leading words, viz. That they are contrary to the laws; and the
said conclusive words, viz. and so (that is, in true sense; because they are
contrary to the Laws) they are void; do manifestly show, that without the help
of this Law, the said Letters Pattents and all others of like nature were void.
And the declaratory part of the stattutes was made only for the better
enlightening of weaker judgments, or to arm the Ministers of Justice with
confidence and security, to deliver and adjudge the Law in such particulars of
this nature, as might after come in question against the importunity of
powerful Courtiers, when there was a direct written text of Statute Law, which
they might insist upon more perspicuous then the fundamental common law, and
general good custom of the Realm was, while being unwritten, it rested only
in the breasts of those who are the dispensers of it, every Judicatory in its
proper turn.

After the Declaratory part of the said Statute, follows the new provisionall
introductive part of it; whereby (omitting purposely in this place, the word
declared) it is further enacted, That if any person shall be hindered, grieved,
disturbed, or disquieted, or his, or their goods, or chattels any way seized,
attached, distrained, taken, carried away, or detained by occasion or pretext
of any Monopoly, or of any such Commission, Grant, License, Power, Liberty,
Faculty; Letters-Pattents, Proclamation, Inhibition, Restraint, Warrant of
Assistance, or other matter or thing tending as aforesaid (as in (...) said Act
is mentioned) and will sue to be relieved in or for any the premises, That
then, and in every such case, the same person and persons shall and may have
his and their remedy for the same at the common law in the King's Bench,
Common Pleas, or Exchequer, by any Action or Actions, to be grounds upon this
Statute against him by whom he shall be so hindered, etc. or by whom his goods
shall be so seized, etc. and recover TREBLE DAMAGES and DOUBLE COSTS.

And in such suite, as for the staying thereof, no privilege, injunction, or
order of restraint, shall be prayed, granted admitted, or allowed, nor any more
then one imp^ance, with a Clause of praemunire, pro ut, etc.

And by this Clause, in the next place I observe clearly, that the said I. S.
as the case is put, is to have his special action upon the said Statute
against the said I. N. to recover his treble damages, and double costs, and is
not to be hindered from his proceeding by any privilege, or order of
restraint, etc. In case the 5. of the 10. provisoes in the said Act contained,
do not sufficiently extend to exempt the said J.S. or his case, out of the
declaratory part, and out of the new provisionall and introductive part of the
said Statute.

The effectual words of the said fifth provisoe, are only these, viz.

Provided also, and it is hereby further intended, declared and enacted; that
this Act, or any thing therein contained, shall not extend or be prejudicial
to the City of London, for, or concerning any Grants, Charters, or
Letters-Pattents, to them made or granted, or for, or concerning any custom or
customs, used by or within the same, or unto any Corporations, Companies, or
Fellowships, of any Art, Trade, Occupation, or Mystery, or to any Companies, or
Societies of Merchants within this Realm erected for the maintenance,
enlargement, or ordering of any Trade or Merchandise: But that the same
Charters, Customs, Corporations, Companies, Fellowships, and Societies, and
their (...) and privileges, powers and immunities, shall be and continue of
such force and effect, as they were BEFORE THE MAKING OF THIS ACT, and of none
other, any thing before in this Act contained to the contrary, in any wise
notwithstanding. And it seems to me, that this fifth Proviso does neither in
words nor in meaning exempt the said I. S. or his case, out of, or from the
Declaratory part, or out of, or from the Provisionall and Introductive part of
the said Statute: Because as to the Declaratory part, the said proviso being
repugnant to the body of the act, must needs be, and is, in true co^struction
of law, utterly void, as being therein totally repugnant to the declaratory
part of the body of the Statute. For to say that all Monopolies and all Grants
of such and such natures, are void by law, and yet to conclude that a
particular Monopoly or Grant for sole using of a thing etc. which by Law is a
Monopoly, and so declared, is nevertheless no Monopoly, or is not void, is
irreconcileably repugnant, and consequently the said Proviso, or Exception,
being of such repugnant nature, as aforesaid, is in Law void.

And if it be objected by way of question, Why then was the Proviso inserted?
The true and sufficient answer is easy, namely, That it was inserted to secure
the city and Merchants who^ it did or might concern of thus much (which was all
the right that was intended them) That if their Charters or Customs were in
all, of in part good and valid in Law, before the making of this Statute; then
in the points of such their force and validity, this Statute should not make
them worse; but leave them as they were before.

And whereas it may be objected, That though the said Proviso cannot exempt
them out of the Declaratory Premises and body of the Act, yet it might exempt
them from the new provisionall and Introductive part of the Act, namely, from
being liable to treble damages, and double costs, and from incurring the
pains, penalties, and forfeitures of the Statute of Provision and Praemunire,
and that the said proviso shall take effect to this purpose, as by law it may,
rather then be rejected as utterly void, and impertinent; I conceive
nevertheless, that this objection is of little force, because there was
neither meaning in the Lawmakers so to exempt them, nor are there any words in
the Act expressing their intention so to be, as appears by the very act it
self, (the best expositor of the true meaning of it self) in comparing this
proviso with the other parts and provisoes of and in the said act; which are
differently penned from this proviso, and thereby do show the different
meaning of the Lawmakers in and concerning the Subject matter of this, and the
subject matter of the said other Provisoes.

For the 6. 7, 8. 9. and 10. provisoes in the said act, are penned with apt and
strong words in the beginning of every of them, That it is provided and enacted
that the said act, or any penalty or forfeiture before mentioned, shall not
extend to Letters patents, or grants concerning Printing, Saltpeter,
Gunpowder, casting or making of Ordnance, shot for Ordnance, Offices erected
then in being, and not decryed, Alum, Allummines, the fellowship of the
Hoastmen of Newcastle upon Tyne, the licencing of Tavernes, the making of
glass, the transportation of Calves-skins, the making of smalt, and the
melting of Iron-ore with Sea-cole or pit-cole. All which last mentioned
provisoes, except only the eighth, do conclude with words, That the said
excepted letters Patents, and grants shall be as free from the provisions,
penalties, and forfeitures contained in the said act, as if the said act had
never been had or made; whereas the said fifth proviso has no such apt or
effectual words either in the beginning or conclusion thereof. And though it
be true, that the words in the beginning of the fifth proviso, are, That the
act, or any thing therein contained shall not extend or be prejudicial to the
City of London, or to such grants or letters patents, as that proviso
refers unto, which are large enough to exempt them from all provisions,
disablements, penalties and forfeitures in the said act, as the same are
parcel of, and contained in the said act; yet the word [prejudiciall] annexed
to that word [extend] and the words in the conclusion of the said fifth
proviso, which are of an explanatory and qualifying nature, do so reconcile
the said proviso to the body of the act, that upon the whole matter it is
evident, the said Grants and Letters patents, by the meaning of the Law makers
well couched, yet fully expressed in their words, are by the said proviso so
and in such sort only excepted from prejudice by the extent of the body of the
Act thereunto, that they shall be and continue of such force and effect in law,
and of none other, as they were before the making of the said act, which was
just none at all in law, and therefore are now in every respect utterly void in
law, (being by this act left without any Cloak, or Fig-leafe covers) any
provision in the said act to the contrary notwithstanding: but not to be free
from the declarations, penalties and forfeitures in the act contained, as if
the act had never been had or made. For, to be of force as they were before the
Act, is one thing, and to be as free as if the Act had never been, is another
thing. And it is not to be conceived, that the said several provisoes in the
said act contained, came to be so differently penned by mere accident, but by
deliberate and wel-advised purpose, which is very co^siderable for the true
interpretatio of the said act For if the words [or be prejudiciall] be not
explanatory, they are void and superfluous: for the word [shall not extend] was
sufficient to except the intended grants and Letters Patents, out of the
provision of the body of the Act to all purposes, if so large exception had
been intended, as it was not; and therefore the words (or be prejudicial)
which are subjoyned, must needs be explanatory, or qualilifying, rather then
rejected as ^terly void: and then the true sense of both words united in right
construction, is, That the provisions of the Statute shall not extend to the
said grants, or Letters patents, to due unto them, or bring upon them any
prejudice, that is, any wrong Note well.
by taking away the good or valid part thereof, or by making them of less
force or effect then they were before the Statute, which had been a prejudice
or wrong unto them; but no prejudice or wrong is done to the Letters patents,
by giving a large and good remedy to parties grieved by offenses to be done by
color of the ineffectuall parts, or clauses of such Grants, or Letters
patents, which were void from the beginning. And note, this is not a popular
and penal law in this point, but only a law conferring relief upon parties
grieved, and to be largely interpreted accordingly.

And whereas it may be objected, That in the said Act there a^ four other
provisoes precedent to the said proviso concencerning London, and the Societies
and Companies of Merchants of this Realm, erected for the maintenance,
enlargement, or ord^ing of trade, or Merchandise, for the excepting thereof,
out of, (...) from the said act, or out of or from the declarations of and in
the said Act, which in the entrance into the said provisoes, or at the
conclusion thereof, have no words to except the particulars in those provisoes
specified or described from the provisions, penalties, and forfeiture, is
contained in the body or purview of the said act; yet it were hard to think
such persons as by pretext of letters patents, or grants of the King, or his
predecessors in that behalf made with clauses in them (peradventure)
restraining all men without the consent of the Patentees, or their assigns,
from exercising such particulars, should hinder men from their trade, in such
sort only as before the making of the said Statute they used without control
to do, should only for so hindering or disquieting a man, or for seizing or
taking away of his goods after the said Statute be exposed to an action or
suit, wherein they should be liable to pay treble damages, and double costs.

It is by way of distinction to be answered; That if the makers of the law had
so intended, they would have used the like words in this fifth proviso, as they
did in four of the five last provisoes, and their not using the same,
imports strongly that they meant not any such matter. Also, the conclusion of
the said fifth proviso being (as in effect) I have noted before, with an
explanatory clause, viz. that the said Letters patents, etc. concerning such
Societies and Companies of Merchants, should be and continue of such force and
effect as they were before, and of none other. Their force and effect before
the Statute, was, that they were good to incorporate the said Societies and
Companies of Merchants, and of effect also to enable them to have perpetual
succession, and to make ordinances and constitutions, not repugnant to the law
of the Realm; which no Corporation in England can do, no not London it self,
as Sir Edward Cook affirms in the fourth part of his Institutes, fol. 249. and
chap. 50. And therefore all those Ordinances, Laws and Orders made by the
Court of Aldermen, and Common Council of London, or by any of the Bro^hoods,
or Patentee-Mynopolizing Corporations of Drapers, Mercers, Grocers,
Cloath-workers, and Merchants of what Country soever, that are contrary to the
known, universal, and fundamental law of the land, are absolutely and utterly
void, and not in the lest to be obeyed, and punishable is he that shall put
them in execution, and ought to be reputed an enemy to the Laws and Liberties
of England; with other legal benefits, and of such force and effect they still
are, by the declaratory operation of the said proviso; wherewith the said
proviso is aptly and fully satisfied, and no need to extend the same to exempt
persons offending (by color of such Grants, or Letters Patents, out of, and
from the penalties or forfeitures inflicted by the act, by pretext of the
illegal part of such letters Patents and Grants, the rather for that this is a
beneficial law, made for the good of the Commonwealth, and FOR FREEDOM AND
LIBERTY OF TRADE, and of the free Subjects of the Realm in that behalf: and
therefore is to be largely interpreted for advancement of the general remedy
intended; and strictly to be interpreted in all points and particulars tending
to abridge or restrain that good remedy. Also there are two main differences
betwixt the said fifth proviso, and the four first provisoes in the said Act.
For the first two of the said four provisoes, concerning letters patents of
privilege, have in them these words, the first of them, that the said
Declarations in the act should not extend to such letters Patents formerly
made; and the second of them, to such letters Patents futu^ely made concerning
the sole makong or working of new Manufactures to the first and true inventers
thereof for a reasonable time of 21. years, or under, for such Letters Patents
granted before the Statute; or for fourteen years, or under, to be granted
after the Statute: foureteen years being but the common time of two ordinary
Apprentiships. Which kind of letters Patents granted as a just reward to the
proper person or his assigns for and in respect of a mere new and good
invention, not mischievous to the State, nor hurtful to Trade, nor generally
inconvenient, was never counted an illegal monopoly. And therefore being
qualified, as in the said provisoes, and limited to the terms of 21. and 14.
years, as aforesaid, were not repugnant to the Declaratory part, or main body
of the Statute, but well consistent with the same, being reconcilable and
reconciled by reasonable construction; whereas the Leters Patents and Grants in
the said fifth proviso, are perpetual: and so far as they tend to RESTRA^N
FREE TRADE, and to appropriate it solely to some few persons, are MISCHIEVOUS
MONOPOLIES, hurtful to the State, generally inconvenient, and by the said
provisoe not limited to have continuance for any time or number of 21. or 14.
years, or other term whatsoever, nor otherwise in any sort, consistent with
the body of the Act, and therefore either the Act must be void, or the said
provisoe, which being so, it follows by the clear rule for the construction
of Statutes, that the said 5. provisoe, and not the body of the Act, is to be
rejected as repugnant and void.

Touching the third provisoe, it is of so particular and special a nature,
that no argument can be drawn from the words, or from the manner or form
thereof, toward the construction of the said 5. provisoe; for the said third
provisoe is only concerning privileges, powers, or authorities formerly
granted by Act of Parliament, which (not being unlawful in the creation)
however they might tend to give the sole using of some things to some
particular persons, because they were erected by act of Parliament, to which
all men in Law being parties are in Law concluded and bound thereby, always
provided they be not contrary to the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, for
the Parliament by their own confession are chosen and trusted by us to provide
for our weal but not for our woe, Book. Declar. page 150. and therefore all
the ordinances and orders of late unduly obtained from the present Parliament,
by the Turkey Merchants, Merchant-Adventurers, Greenland Merchants, or any other
whatsoever; for the hindering of every free Englishman to trade into any place
whatsoever beyond the Seas, or for the sole engrossing it into the hands of
such and such men, is altogether contrary to the just fundamental Laws of the
Land, and so altogether illegal, unbinding, and ought not in the least to be
obeyed, and I know no reason but the executers of them may as justly be put to
death as Traitors, for indeavoring the subversion of the fundamental Laws of
the Land, as Justice Empson, and Justice Dudloy, were in the first year of
Hen. 8. Speed. fol. 978. 983. Martin fol. 353. 355. 356. For their oppressions,
and innovating cruelties, exercised upon the bodies and goods of many of the
freemen of England, by coullor of an unjust and illegal Act of Parliament made
in the 11. year of H. 7. Chap. 3. which Law, says learned, Sir Edward Cook
in the second part of his institutes fol. 51. was made against the ancient and
just fundamental Law of the 29. Chapter of Magna Charta, yea in the very face
of it, and therefore he calls it (though an Act of Parliament) an unjust and
injurious Act, so that a Parliament cannot de jure do what they please,
although de facto sometimes they do it, which is most unjust in them so to do.

This third provisoe was inserted in caution lest this latter general
declaratory Act being contrary to such former particular Acts, qualified as
before should amount to a repeal thereof; which by the makers of this law was
not intended; and this provisoe inserted to make due provision according to
such their true meaning.

And touching the 4. provisoe concerning privy Seals, enabling Judges in
certain cases to compound, it relates not at all to that part of this Act
concerning Monopolies, but to the other part of it, which concerns the
dispensation with penal Laws, and the forfeiture^ thereof; as by the distinct
parts of the Act, reddendo singula singulis, does manifestly appear, whereby
no argument can be drawn from the matter or words, or from the manner or form
of this provisoe, toward the construing of the said 5. prouisoe, which only
relates to, and concerns that part of the Act, which treats of Monopolies.
And therefore upon the whole matter for the reasons aforesaid, I am of opinion,
that the said letters-pattents of 21. Eliz. and all such like are within the
compass of the said Act, and thereby in the body of the same, declared to be a
Monopoly, and are not by the said 5. provisoe, excepted or preserved from or
against the provision, penalties, or forfeitures of and in the said Act
contained; But that the said I. S. MAY HAVE SVCH ACTION FOR TREBLE DAMAGES AND
DOUBLE COSTS AS AFORESAID.

Having unto this paraphrase upon the Statute of Monopolies, joined some
Marginall notes of my own, the better to clear some things contained in it; I
shall here insert you Mr. William Sycks his most excellent Remonstrance to the
Parliament, delivered with his own hands to the Members thereof, in March 1645.
immediataly after he, and Mr. Thomas Johnson Merchant had delivered a most
excellent and gallant Petition to them, the Copy of which you may read in my
late printed book, called Londons Liberty in Chains discovered, page 43. 44.
45. and the end wherefore I insert this Remonstrance here, is because I hope
thereby to provoke you especially; (O ye Barrons, or Commons of London) to
revive his Remonstrance again, that so you your selves, may be instruments to
procure unto your selves, and your posterities, that extraordinary benefit (and
inrichment to this whole Kingdom) free trade and trafick, which he (though
free of the Merchant-Adventurers Corporation) with so much true zeal, honesty,
and importunate earnestness, labored to procure for you, but could not.

Only this I must tell you, he followed it so close that by his means
Colonel Alexander Rigby, that heroical, true, and cordial lover of his
Country, had prepared to my knowledge the draught of an Ordinance, for ever to
distroy all Monopolies, and absolutely to set Trade free, but for want of more
help then he had, could not then get it on in the House, which by a new
Petition from you (so many gallant and honest new Members being chosen since
into the House) now he easily may: Therefore for your own good and benefit as
well as for the general good and benefit of the whole Kingdom, and all our
posterities, I with all earnestness and importunity in reat you with the
strength of zeal, and resolved resolution, forthwith unanimously to petition
for the restoring of free Trade, and destroying of all illegal Monopolies of
what kind soever, and also for the severe and exemplary punishment of all (the
Ringleaders especially) that have exercised them: that so the Generations to
come may be terrified from the endeavoring the destruction of the
fundamental, and rational established Law and Liberties of England.

To the Right Honorable the high Court of Parliament; The humble Remonstrance
of WILLIAM SYKES Merchant, for free Trade in transporting and importing of
lawful and needful commodities.
Whereas of late the Remonstrant, and Thomas Johnson Merchant, for themselves,
and on the behalf of all the freemen of England, did petition both Houses of
Parliament for Free Trade; which they are confident is the Commonwealths
BIRTHRIGHT, and reparations for wrongs done by those Ingrossers and
Monopolizers, who by virtue of Patents, have been, and are sellers of that
hereditable right, as the Company of Merchant-Adventurers have done to Cisizens
for 100. l. a man, and to Country people for 50. l. a man. The like may be
said of the Company of East-countrey Merchants, Muscovia Merchants, Turkey
Merchants, and other Companies of Merchants, who have for a long time practiced
this way of trade-selling, and Monopolizing, to the great grievance of the
people, and detriment to FREE TRADE, both at home and abroad.

Which Petition was presented to most Members of both Houses, and dispersed
into the several Counties of England, that this honorable Court may no longer
delay the discharge of their trust, but speedily improve their power to rescue
FREE TRADE from such Liberty-destroyers and Trade-ingrossers, and that the
people may the better know for what end and purpose they have adventured their
lives and estates in these present wars.

Yet the said Petition is not so much as publicly read in either House of
Parliament, far less debated or answered, though the Commonwealth be so much
concerned in it, as in nothing more, if the people knew their right and
freedom, which this present Parliament has confirmed, by the confirmation of
Magna Charta, and by the executing of justice on the Earl of Strafford for his
exercising arbitrary government against the freedom of England; therefore the
Remonstrant does conceive, that he is bound in duty to follow the said
petition with this Remonstrance, which he was emboldned to present for these
two ensuing reasons, and to answer some objections, referring the conclusion to
a serious resolution.

Reas. 1. The first reason is drawn from the second Table of Gods law, which
commands us to love our neighbor as our selves: This BIRTHRIGHT OF FREE TRADE
being as well our neighbors right as our own, therefore we petitioned as well
for our neighbors, as for our selves.

Reas. 2. The second reason is drawn from the intent of the Protestation, which
we solemnly took in the presence of Almighty God, To maintain the right and
privilege of the people with our lives and estates; this Free trade being all
men's right and privilege as well as our own, upon that ground we were moved to
petition as well for their right of Free Trade, as for our own.

Obj. 1. But these Companies have been of long standing.

Ans. So have the Prelates, and so much the more wrong done to the
Commonwealth, and therefore so much the greater need to be put down. For
although robbing and taking of purses upon the high way, be of ancient
standing, yet it does not thereupon follow that such a practice is ever the
lawfuller.

Ob. 2. But Magna Charta does continue Bishops. (But I say, Magna Charta does
not establish Bishops, but only the liberties and rights of the Church of
England: and what those are, the Scripture does best tell us. And although
Bishops be taken away, yet the liberties of the Church established by Magna
Charta, to this very day remain,) And admits transportation of wool.

Ans. It is one thing to pull down Bishops, and make an Act against
transporting of wool, being the desire and for the good of all; but it is
another thing to take away the peoples Birthright, FREE TRADE, without their
consent, and to their prejudice, yea and against many petitions of many
thousands in many Parliaments preferred for the rescuing of that right, and
reparations for the countries wrongs.

Obj. 3, But Free trade will be destructive to the Commonwealth.

Ans. It will be no more destructive to Eastland, Muscovia, Turkey, the
Low Countries, and other places, then it is for France, Spain, Ireland,
Portugal, and Scotland, which is none at all.

Obj. 4. But Cloth is of another and better nature then Wine, etc. which are
foreign commodities.

Ans. The greater is the wrong, it being the grand inland commodity, so that
all other Patents and Monopolies may be better renewed, then this continued.

Obj. 5. But Clothiers, and the like men, have not knowledge to manage this
Free Trade.

Ans. If it were so (as it is not) yet the same is occasioned by these thieves
and robbers, that cunningly and secretly by a fair but unjust and deceitful
pretense, steal the Commonwealths right, so as they are deprived of that
opportunity to educate their children and servants, which may enable them to
manage that privilege of Free Trade.

Obj. 6. But they are against government, and would walk disorderly.

Ans. No, we would have both government and order in a solid and just way, but
we are against hellish oaths, unlawful fines, sinful orders, false
imprisonment, law and right-sellers, all which are practiced by these
Trade-ingrossers, as will appear by good testimony.

Obj. 7. But no man has followed the petition.

Ans. Is it not the duty of every Trustee in the House of Commons to prosecute
the Commonwealths right, and peoples privilege? But if that be the
hinderance, it is the humble desire of the Remonstrant, that Mr. Rigby, and Mr.
Martin may be appointed to draw up a full Ordinance without delay, that he or
they, whosoever they be, under what pretense or fraud soever, may be accursed
that removes his neighbors landmark (his Birthright, or Free trade) and that
the Commons house may approve themselves faithful, and worthy the
Commonwealths trust, and according to the solemn protestation, to bring to
exemplary and condign punishment, those who have been thieves and robbers in
this kind; and according to an order made this present Parliament, it is
earnestly desired, that the House may be purged of all such as are Patentees,
Monopolizers, Trade-ingrossers, Sellers of peoples right, and destroyers of the
Free Trade.

And also out of all other places of public trust under the Parliament,
whether in the Custom House, Commission of Excise, Committees in City or
Country, Soldiery, or other government, as Sheriffs, Treasurers, Majors,
Aldermen, and the like, who are not worthy to be continued in any
Commonwealths trust; and so much the more, by how much the longer they have
practiced such deceitful robbery, and to let all such as have been wronged by
these kind of men, have freedom with respect and countenance, to prosecute
against these Caterpillars, for due reparations, according to the wrongs done
by them and their Predecessors.

And if the Parliament would have the free people to fight for them, as they
have willingly done, by venturing their lives and estates freely, to maintain
their power and privilege against the common enemy; then let that power be
improved and laid out again for the right and privilege of the said people, to
rescue and recover their Birthright (Free Trade) out of the hands of those
greedy and subtle spoylers, yea and grinders of the faces of the poor.

If any further objection be made against Free trade; then it is earnestly
desired that the House of Commons would answer it themselves, as parties in
behalf of the free people, who have called them to that trust for that end; or
otherwise let the mind and sense of the common people in every County and
Corporation (all England over) be produced, and let it go upon that, in which
way the Remonstrant is persuaded, that a hundred to one will be fot Free Trade.

So hoping this high and Honorable Court will have due respect to the premises,
in all dutiful acknowledgement; the Remonstrant shall desire to prove himself
the Commonwealths servant,

William Sykes.
