(...) ^^^ellent New SONG: OR ^^e Loyal Tory's Delight.
^ ^
LOndon Ladds be Merry,
your Parliament-Friends are gean,
Which made you all so merry,
but never would let us alean;
They peach'd us every ean,
both Papist and Protestant too;
Now they all for Tyburn run,
and the De'l run with 'em I trow.
II.
Our Good K. Charles, Heaven bless Him,
Protector of Albany's Right,
Received from the House sike a Lesson,
had like to set us at strife.
But Charles he Swore by his Life,
he would have no mere sike a do;
He packt 'em off by the Light,
and the De'l gang with 'em I trow.
III.
There Is Armstrong, and Jemmy the Cully,
were muckle to blame, I read;
And Shaftsbury that States-Bully,
who awes the Factious Breed:
And wittal Gray (good-deed)
who Pimp'd while his Wife did Mow*
And held the De'r for a need,
how the De'l rewards him I trow.
IV.
De'l speed 'em Trencher and Hambden,
foul Members of the Rotten Rump;
And goggle-ey'd Fly-catching Branden,
his Head's grown all on a lump:
And Oats the Socket o'th Pump,
his Mouth Close-Stool to the Saints;
He Buggers his Man with the stump,
while the Whiggs at Tyburn Cants.
V.
E'ne Hang up the Three Bloody Brewers,
that are in the Cupboard for Jack;
For they can be no Sons of Whores,
that drapt out of Oliver's Tap:
They Are all of the Green Ribbond Club,
both Inglesby, Loveless, and Booth, --
Reformed all in a Tub;
they would better have been in a Stove.
VI.
Then Breeman, an Old Rumping Roundhead,
and Wildman with his Roaring Guns;
By Rumsey all are Consounded,
both Forbus and Wood with their Funs:
Four more, their Marshals and King,
with one sweet Sister of Hope;
They Have left the smaller to Swing,
while they are Converting the Pope.
VII.
There Is Blunderbush, West, and such numbers;
they Crowd all the Goals in the Town;
They pray that the Turks may do wonders,
and cut all the Christians down:
Should I insist on their Shames,
and sing till to Morrow at Noon:
I Am as like to number their Names,
as to make a Smock for the Moon,
Printed for J. Dean, Bookseller in Cranborn- Street, in Leicester-Fields near
Newport- House, 1683.
