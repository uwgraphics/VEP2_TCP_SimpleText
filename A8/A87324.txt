IT is well known to all men, but more particularly to his Majesty's Subjects
of this Kingdom, who have all gathered plentiful and comfortable fruits of
his Majesty's blessed government, how abundantly careful his Majesty has been
in the whole course of his Government, of the peace and safety of this his
Kingdom, and how graciously he has labored to derive to all his Subjects
therein, all those benefits and comforts, which from a most gracious King,
could be conferred on his Subjects, to make them a happy people, whereof he
has given many great testimonies. And as at all times he endeavored to give
them due contentment and satisfaction, so even then whilst the Rebels now in
Arms were conspiring mischief against Him, and his Crown and Kingdom, he
was then exercising Acts of Grace and Benignity toward them, granting to his
Subjects here the fullness of their own desires in all things, so far as with
Honor or Justice he possibly could, and particularly when the Committees of
both Houses of Parliament here this last Summer attended his Majesty in
England, at which time (amongst many other things graciously assented to by
Him) he was content even with apparent loss and disadvantage to himself to
depart with sundry his Rights of very great value, which lawfully and justly
he might have retained, And as his continued goodness to this people, and his
Princely care of their prosperity and preservation shall (to the unspeakable
joy and comfort of all his good Subjects) render him glorious to all Posterity,
so the wicked ingratitude and treacherous disloyalty of those Rebels shall
render them for ever infamous to all ages, and utterly inexcusable even in the
judgment of those, who for any respect either formerly wished well to their
persons, or now pity them in their transgressions. And although the said
persons now in Rebellion were in no degree provoked by any just cause of
public grief received from his Majesty, or his Ministers, to undertake such
desperate wickedness, neither can justly assign any severity or rigor in the
execution of those Laws which are in force in this Kingdom against Papists,
nor indeed any cause at all, other then the unnatural hatred, which those
persons in Rebellion do bear to the British and Protestants, whom they desire
and publicly profess to root out from amongst them, The more strange in that
very many of themselves are descended of English, whence is the original and
foundation of all their estates, and those great benefits which they have
hitherto enjoyed, and whence their Predecessors, and others then well affected
in this Kingdom, have been at all times since the Conquest cherrished,
relieved, countenanced, and supported, against the ancient enemies of the Kings
people of England, many of the Irish also having received their estates and
livelihood from the unexampled bounty and goodness of the Kings of England.
Yet such is their inbred ingratitude and disloyalty, as they conspired to
massacre Us the Lords Justices and Council, and all the British and
Protestants universally throughout this Kingdom, and to seize into their
hands, not only his Majesty's Castle of Dublin, the principal Fort in this
Kingdom, but also all other the fortifications thereof, though (by the
infinite goodness and mercy of God) those wicked and devilish Conspiracies
were brought to light, and some of the principal Conspirators imprisoned in
his Majesty's Castle of Dublin, by Us by his Majesty's authority, so as those
wicked and damnable plots are disappointed in the chief parts thereof, his
Majesty's said Castle of Dublin, and City of Dublin being preserved, and put
into such a condition of strength, as if any of them, or their adherents shall
presume to make any attempt thereupon, they shall (God willing) receive that
correction, shame, confusion and destruction, which is due to their treacherous
and detestable disloyalty. And in pursuit of their bloody intentions, they
assembled themselves in Arms in hostile manner, with banners displayed,
surprised diverse of his. Majesty's Forts and Garrisons, possessed themselves
thereof, robbed and spoiled many thousands of his Majesty's good Subjects,
British and Protestants, of all their goods, dispossessed them of their houses
and lands, murdered many of them upon the place, stripped naked many others of
them, and so exposed them to nakedness, cold and famine, as they thereof dyed,
imprisoned many others, some of them persons of eminent quality, laid siege to
diverse of his Majesty's Forts and Towns yet in his Majesty's hands, and
committed many other barbarous cruelties and execrable inhumanities, upon the
persons and estates of the British and Protestants, men, women, and children,
in all parts of the Kingdom, without regard of quality, age, or sex. And to
cover their wickedness in those cruel Acts, so to deceive the world, and to
make way (if they could) to the effecting of their mischievous ends, they add
yet to their wickedness a further degree of impiety, pretending outwardly,
that what they do, is for the maintenance and advancement of the Kings
prerogative, whereas it appears manifestly, that their aims and purposes
inwardly are (if it were possible for them so to do) to wrest from him his
Royal Crown and Scepter, and his just Sovereignty over this Kingdom and
Nation, and to deprive him and his lawful Ministers of all authority and power
here, and to place it on such persons as they think fit, which can no waystand
with his Majesty's just Prerogative, nor can any equal minded man be seduced
to believe that they can wish well to his Royal person, or any thing that is
his, who in their actions have expressed such unheard of hatred, malice, and
scorn of the British Nation, as they have done. And such is their madness as
they consider not, that his sacred Majesty disdaines to have his name or power
so boldly traduced by such wicked malefactors, Rebels having never in any age
been esteemed fit supporters of the Kings Prerogative, much less these, who
(under countenance thereof) labor to deface and shake off his Government, and
extirp his most loyal and faithful Subjects of his other Kingdoms and here,
whose preservation (above and earthly things) is, and always has been his
Majesty's principal study and endeavor, which even these Traitors themselves
have abundantly found with comfort, if they could have been sensible of it;
And whereas diverse Lords and Gentlemen of the English Pale preferred Petition
unto Us, in the behalf of themselves, and the rest of the Pale, and other the
old English of this Kingdom, showing that whereas a late Conspiracy of
Treason was discovered, of ill-affected persons of the old Irish, and that
thereupon Proclamation was published by Us, wherein (among other things) it was
declared, that the said Conspiracy was perpetrated by Irish Papists, without
distinction of any, and they doubting that by those general words of Irish
Papists, they might seem to be involved, though they declared themselves
confident, that We did not intend to include them therein, in regard they
alleged they were none of the old Irish, nor of their Faction or
Confederacy, but (as they then pretended) altogether averse and opposite to
all their designs, and all others of like condition, We therefore to give the
full satisfaction (having indeed at that time great confidence in their
loyalty) did by Proclamation dated the 29. of October 1641. declare and
publish, that by the words Irish Papists, We intended only such of the old
mere Irish in the Province of Ulster, as were then Actors in that Treason, and
others, who adhered to them, and that We did not any way intend or mean
thereby any of the old English of the Pale, nor of any other parts of this
Kingdom, then esteemed good Subjects, We being then (as We conceived) well
assured of their fidelities to the Crown, and having experience of the good
affections and services of their Ancestors, in former times of danger and
Rebellion. And indeed so believing were We in their faithfulness and loyalty
to the Crown, as We then also represented it into England for their advantage,
and thereupon in the Order of the Lords and Commons in the Parliament in
England concerning Ireland, his Majesty's loyal Subjects of English blood,
though of the Romish Religion, being ancient Inhabitants within several
Counties and parts of this Realm are mentioned, as those who have always in
former rebellions given testimony of their fidelity to the Crown of England.
And in further testimony of the good affiance We had in their loyalty, We
issued Arms to the several Counties of the English Pale, the better to enable
them to discharge their duties, in defending those parts, and his Majesty's
good Subjects therein, against the Rebels, upon deep professions of loyalty
made by them, and their seeming detestation of the loathsomeness of the crimes,
and bloody guilts of the Rebels, which they for their parts professed (with
many oaths and protestations) to abhor, and promised to oppose and resist
them, with all their power. And we issued Arms also to many Noblemen and
Gentlemen of the Pale, and elsewhere, of the Romish Religion, for the defense
of their houses, against the Rebels. Yet much contrary to the expectation of
all equal minded men, and in deceit of the trust reposed in them by this
State, and directly contrary, as to their loyalty and duty to his Majesty,
so to the great professions which they had so lately before made at this
Council Board, many of those as well whole Counties, as particular persons
entrusted with those Arms, revolted to the Rebels, carried his Majesty's Arms
with them, and so the Arms which were trusted into their hands, for the
protection of his Masties good Subjects, they converted to the annoyance and
destruction (as much as in them lay) of those good Subjects they were trusted
to protect, and of this State and Government, and have not only not resisted
the Rebels, but have also joined with them, and they and the Rebels assembled
in Arms in hostile manner, with banners displayed, against his Majesty, in
besieging some of his Towns, taking into their possession by force or fraud
many of his Majesty's Buroughs, walled and unwalled, and in committing
murders, spoils, robberies, and many detestable cruelties on his Majesty's
good Subjects. And although those of the Pale, pretended that they were not
able to assemble or arm any strength against the Rebels, yet lately they
found means to assemble, and arm great multitudes to assist the Rebels
against his Majesty's forces, and against his Majesty's Government, and this
State, And as well the persons who were the first Actors in this Rebellion, as
also many others in the English Pale, and several other parts of the Kingdom,
forgetting those duties which (by the Laws of God and man) are due from them
to his Sacred Majesty, are so ungrateful to his Majesty for the great and
abundant benefits and favors from Him, and his Royal Father, and Predecessors
derived to them, so insensible of the happiness which they (with all others in
this Kingdom) enjoyed by his blessed Government, and so improvident to
themselves and their posterity, as they have presumed most unnaturally to
conspire, raise, and act those abominable Treasons and Rebellion against his
Majesty, as is herein formerly mentioned, And for as much as those Rebels,

Imprinted at Dublin. 1641.

A true Copy of a Letter from Dublin.
THe Earl of Ormond Lieutenant General of the Army in Ireland, and Sir
Charles Coote, and Sir Simon Harecourt went out of Dublin lately to meet the
Rebels, hearing they had lodged themselves at the Naas, 12. miles from Dublin,
it is most true the Rebels were there entertained, but when they heard of our
English Forces coming, though they were ten to one, yet they durst not stand
to it, but ran away and left the town to be pillaged by the Soldiers, they
found such booty there, as the Soldiers came laden home; a just punishment to
those that had pillaged the poor English that lived there when this rebellion
broke forth; that town is destroyed, and our English horse went six miles
further to a place called Killcullen-bridge, where the Rebels were too, but
there they showed likewise their heels in running away; that place they burnt,
and returned safe without loss of a man, the English Soldiers likewise in
their return to Dublin burnt Castlemartin and other small villages
thereabouts; and the Commanders hanged about fourscore rogues they caught,
and but one of the English men hurt; After their return to Dublin the English
again issued our of Dublin southward upon the Rebels of Wickloe and Wexford,
about five miles from Dublin and there they ran away too, so that had they but
at Dublin a considerable supply of men, money, and munition, by Gods assistance
they soon would rout the Rebels thereabouts. Three of the Kings Pinnaces
about three weeks since went to releeve Tredagh, but it pleased God by the
violence of weather so to devide them, that one of them was shipwract upon the
Coast of Wales, and the relief by the others prevented for that present, yet
how ever such was the care of the Lords, Justices and Counsel there, that on
the 14. of February last, they sent nine small vessels again with victuals
and munition, and 400. men, and by that means has again releeved Tredagh.
And for full encouragement to those well disposed persons that shall venture
their moneys for the reducing that kingdom to its former condition according
to the late propositions made in Parliament; all or most of the Nobility and
Gentry, by Juries of their own Counties are convicted of high Treason at the
Kings Benchbar in Dublin, so that their estates are in a very fair way to be
forfeited, for they are convicted upon Record already, and the persons so
convicted are owners of as fine Lands as any are in England, and quantity
sufficient to satisfy five hundred thousand pounds, if it be laid out: Our
dear and good brethren in England I hope by long delay will not let us suffer,
diverse Gentlemen of good repute are in the Country in their several houses,
holding out still, which by delay will be utterly lost, which will be a great
dishonor to the English Nation, that in four month should send over but a
handful of men, they are full of charity, and I hope they will not let us
suffer death, for no other can any English expect that has opposed, and fall
into their hands; money is much wanting in Dublin, in so much that some of our
English die for want of clothing; In Dublin we have still Vipers left, Alderman
James, one of the Aldermen of Dublin is committed to the Castle of Dublin, for
holding intelligence with the Rebels and it is thought he will be hanged, his
just desert: Sir Nicholas White is likewise committed to the Castle, as
suspected for a dangerous man, being a very great Papist, and his Sons being in
Rebellion; Thus is the true state of Ireland about Dublin at this time.

FINIS.
