A merry Ballad, Called, Christ's Kirk on the Green.
WAs never in Scotland heard nor seen,
Such Dancing, nor Deray:
Neither at Falkland on the Green;
Nor Peebles at the Play;
As was (of Wooers, as I ween)
At Christ's Kirk on a day.
For there came Kittie washen clean,
In her New Gown of Gray;
So gay that day.
To dance these Damisels them dight;
These Lasses light of laits.
Their Gloves were of the raffall right;
Their Shoes were of the straits.
Their Kirtles were of Lincoln light,
Well pressed with many plaits.
They were so nyce, when men them night,
They squeald like any Gaits,
Full loud that day.
Of all these Maidens myld as meed,
Was none so gimp as Gillie:
As any Rose, her rude was reed:
Her lyre was like the Lilly,
But yealow, yealow, was her head,
And she of Love so silly,
Though all her kin had sworn her dead,
She would have none but Willie,
Alone that day.
She scorned Iock, and Skripped at him,
And murgeond him with mocks.
He would have loved her, she would not let him,
For all his yealow locks.
He cherisht her: she bade go chat him,
She counted him not two clocks:
So shamfullie his short Jack set him,
His legs were like two rocks,
Or rungs that day
Tom Luter was their Minstrell meet,
Good Lord, how he could lance:
He played so shrill, and sang so sweet;
While Towsie took a Trance.
Old Light-foot there he could forleet,
And counterfayted France.
He held him like a man discreet:
And up the Morries Dance,
He took that day.
Then Stien came stepping in with stends:
No rink might him arrest.
Play-foot did bob with many bends.
For Masie he made request.
He lap, while he lay on his lends:
And rising, so was pressed,
While he did host, at both the ends,
For Honor of the Feast,
And Dance that day.
Then Robin Roy began to revell.
And Towsie to him drugged.
Let be (quod Iock) and called him jevell;
And by the tayll him tugged.
Then Kensie cleiked him to a kevell.
God wots, if they two lugged.
They parted there upon a nevell.
Men said, that hayr was rugged,
Between them two.
With that, a Friend of his cryde; Fie!
And forth an Arrow drew.
He forged it so forcfullie,
The Bow in flinders flew.
Such was the grace of God, trow I:
For had the Tree been true,
Men said, who knew his Archerie,
That he had slain anew,
Belyue that day.
A yape young man that stood him neist,
Soon bent his Bow in ire:
And etled the Bairn in at the breist,
The Bolt flew over the Byre:
And cryde, Fie! He had slain a Priest,
A mile beyond the Mire.
Both Bow and Bag from him he keist,
And fled as fast as Fire,
From flint that day.
An Hasty Kinsman, called Harrie,
That was an Archer keen:
Tide up a Taikell, withoutten tarry;
I trow the man was tein.
I wot not whether his hand did vary,
Or his Fo, was his Friend.
But he escaped by the might of Marie,
As men that nothing meand,
But good that day.
Then Lowrie, like a Lion lap:
And soon a Flayn can fedder;
He heght to pierce him at the pap,
Thereon to wed a Wedder.
He hit him on the womb a wap:
It buft like any Bledder.
He escaped so, such was his hap,
His Doublet was of Ledder,
Full fine that day.
The buff so bousteouslie abaist him,
That he to earth dusht down.
The other man for dead then left him,
And fled out of the town.
The wives came forth, and up they reft him,
And found life in the Lown.
Then with three routs there they raysd him,
And cured him out of sown,
Fra hand that day.
The Millar was of manly make,
To meet with him, it was no mowes.
There durst no Ransom there him take;
So nowed he their nowes.
The Bushment haill about him brake,
And bickered him with Bows.
Then trayterouslie behind his back,
They hacked him on the howes,
behind that day.
Then Hutchen, with an hazell Ryce:
To red, began through them rummill,
He mudled them down, like any myce,
He was no Bettie bummill.
Though he was wight, he was not wise,
With such jutours to jummill:
For from his thumb, there flew a slyce,
While he cryde, Barlafummill:
I Am slain this day.
When that he saw his blood so red,
To flee might no man let him.
He trowd it had been for old fead;
He thought, and bade; Have at him.
He made his feet defend his head;
The far fayrer it set him:
While he was past out of their plead,
They must be swift that gat him,
through speed that day.
Two that were headsmen of the heard,
They rusht on other like Rams.
The other four which were vnfeard,
Beat on with barrow trams.
And where their gobs were vngeard,
They got upon the gams:
While all the blood-born was their beard,
As they had wurried Lambs,
most like that day.
They girnd, and glowred, all at ones:
Each Gossop other grieved.
Some streiked stings, some gathred stones:
Some fled, and some relieved.
Their Menstrill used quiet means;
That day he wyselie prieved.
For he came home with vnbirsd bones,
Where Fighters were mischieved,
full ill that day.
With forks, and flaylls, then let they flaps,
And flew together with frigs:
with bougers of barns they pierst blew caps,
While of their Beirns they made brigs.
The Reire rose rudely with their raps,
When Rungs were laid on rigs.
Then Wives came forth with cries and claps,
See where my Lyking ligs,
full low this day.
The black Sowter of Briath was bowden,
His Wys hang by his waist:
His body was in Bleck, all browden:
He girned like a gaist.
Her glittring hayr, that was so gowden,
His love fast for him laist:
That for her sake he was vnyowden,
While he a mile was chaist,
and more that day.
When they had beird like bayted Bulls:
The Bone-fyres burnt in baylls:
They grew as meek as any Mules,
That wearied were with Mails.
For tyrdness these forfoughten foolls*
Fell down like flaughtring flaylls:
Fresh men came in, and haild their dules,
And dang them down in daills,
bedeine that day.
The Wives then gave an hiddeous yell,
When all these Younkers yocked:
As fierce as Flags of fyre-flaughts fell:
Friecks to the field they flocked.
Then Karls with clubs did other quel*
On breast, while blood out bocked:
So rudely rang the Common-bell,
That all the Steeple rocked,
for dread that day.
By this, Tom Tailor was in his gear*
When he heard the Common-bell:
He said, he should make them all on steare,
When he came there him sell.
He went to fight with such a fear,
While to the ground he fell.
A Wife then hit him on the ear,
With a great knocking Mell,
feld him that day.
The Bryde-groom brought a pynt of Aill;
And bade the Pyper drink it.
Drink it (quod he) and it so staill?
I shrow me, if I think it.
The Bryde her Maidens stood near by,
And said, It was not blinked.
And Bartagasie, the Bryde so gay,
Upon them fast she winked,
full soon that day.
When all was done, Dick with an Ax,
Came forth to fell a Foother.
Quoth he, where is yon hoorson smakes,
Right now that hurt my Brother?
His Wife bad him, Go home, Gib glakes,
And so did Meg his Mother.
He turned, and gave them both their pakes:
For he durst ding none other,
But them that day.
FINIS.
