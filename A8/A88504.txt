Londons new Recorder: Or, certain Queres to be resolved by the old Recorder,
for Londons further welfare.
1. WHether the Cities late furious and audacious insolence in listing
themselves and engaging their friends for a second War, or their tame and
shameful submission and betraying the others, be more worthy of contempt.

2. Whether we may not now as justly and ingenuously covenant to endeavor the
extirpation of the chief Officers in the City-Government, whether it be the
Lord Mayor, Alderman, Sheriffs Common-Counsell, and other Officers depending
thereon, and placing better in their room, for their late intended rebellion in
raising a new War, as they before have the extirpation of Popery, Prelacy,
(that is Church Government by Archbishops, Bishops, Chancellors, Deanes, etc.)
Superstition, Heresy, Schism, Profaneness, etc. these being sins more
apparently, acted by them, and we more miserably sensible thereof, then these
of the latter; none of which the whole Synod can yet reduce under any of their
Classes.

3. Whether the City-Fomenters in their late practices for a new war, did not
give occasion, and it be not more justice and less Sacrilege for the King and
State to appropriate to themselves these Caupon Capon-eaters, Halls and
several Corporations, the maine incentive of their pride and rebellion, then
those ancient and pious fabrics and endowments of our forefathers devotion
and charity.

4. Whether these new holy days of Apprentices and School-boyes may not prove
a greater deformation to Church and City, then their ancient Shrovetide and
May Day has been of Reformation to Play Houses and Stews.

5. Whether the redoubted valor of the Apprentices has not revived their
extinguished birthright, and made more Gentlemen then Masters: who as they had
done the King from the Parliament, so these shall extrude their Masters from
their Commodities and Warehouses.

6. Whether it be not as necessary for the temporal Sword to suppress all
Arms and Soldiery of the City, as it is for the spiritual, all Schism and
Sectaries, they both having their beginning in Queen Elizabeth's time, and both
alike formidably increased to Church and State.

7. Whether Queen Elizabeth's first license to a few Citizens and Apprentices,
may not exercise Arms for her disport and entertainment, may not be re-called
by her Successor, their number now being limited and their use e diametro to
the contrary.

8. Whether since their expulsion of the King from his Chamber the City, and
their disloyal royal hunt, they would not now though against their Religion
and Charter, turn penitent Pilgrims and revisit S. Cutberts and S. Michaels
Mount to reduce him and the Prince, and although they have not canonized any of
them for a Saint in their weekly Pamphlet, yet for his return to procure a new
holy day Ordinance, and Register it in their yearly Kalenders.

9. Whether that ancient little Model the City (not circumscribed now in the
Lines of Communication) has not by their tumultuous Petitions reduced and
whitled that maine prop and post of our English Government (the Parliament) to
less power and proportion then a Sheriffs white rod, or a Constables painted
staff.

10. Whether their long Liberties over Southwark, Westminster, White-Chappell,
etc. has not made those places greater objects of fear and danger unto the
City her self, then they have made her to be of terror to the whole Kingdom:
And whether like an over-growne Oyster, does she not now stew in her own
pickell.

11. Whether the City do not deal with its Suburbs and their Line of
Communication, as the Jews of old with the Samaritans, acknowledge them
brethren only while they advantage them: And whether, if necessarily they must
be Appendices, they ought not to communicate in all its Liberties.

12. Whether those Marshall Burgesses have not good nigh brought their City
into as calamituous a case as they would have done S. Peter's patrimony or the
Bishops estates.

13. Whether the City monopolizing all Trades, it be a good state of body, to
have a fat head, thin guts, and lean members: Or whether it be not expedient
policy by launcing the mids of the hide, to eventilate those tumors, which by
the late depressing and trampling of the sides has so exorbitantly swelled
there, that it holds not now a fit proportion for the right level of the whole.

14. Whether their endeavorring to make themselves a fourth party and estate of
the Kingdom, and having (with the earthen pot in the fable) justled with all
the other, and now down stream they be not likely to be shattered a pieces by
the others greater strength.

15. Whereas upon the 7. of this August the City gave up its spirit
inarticulately intestate, whether his Excellency, their present Administrator,
will yet accept of their beaten gold Basin, and Ewer, and permit their wives
and children, according to their custom to enjoy their third parts.

16. Whether the City-tame Pigeons since their late wild flight, abandoning
their Turtells, will not most of them be transformed to Stockdoves, and seek
some desert or wilderness to bemoan their unpittied desolation.

17. Whether the Cockneigh or the Horse-crow be now the more proper and
pleasing language to a Citizen.

18. Whether on the Royal Exchange, the Publike-Faith, or the Irish Purchaser
will prove the greater Bankrupts.

19. Whether Alderman Gresham in his Trunk-hose and round Cap upon the Exchange
deserves not (though he less need) more incense to his memory and is more
worthy their imitation, then lately that Rhodomontado Alderman in Moorfieles on
horseback with all his caparisons.

20. Whether the Old Change and Guild Hall are not nearer to Newgate and
Ludgate, then the Bishops gate be unto the Tower

21. Whether Britains Burss be not now as rich as Goldsmiths or Guild Hall.

22. Whether Bedlame and Bridewell sound not better to Puritan then S.
Bartholomewes or Christ-Church.

23. Whether Pater Noster Row Ave and Creeds Lane stood not as near
Cheapside-Crosse as Gracious street.

24. Whether Lex talionis in all things has not yet met with the City; and
whether to this Quintessence of all their former Rebellions, and adaequate
transcendent punishment may not justly be feared.

25. Whether the old Recorder shall not be better employed in staying here to
resolve all these Quaeres, then his other ten Fellow Members has been in
giving occasions to raise them, and then running away.
