ENGLANDS VOTE FOR A FREE ELECTION OF A Free Parliament.
GReat God of Nations, and their Right,
By whose high Auspice Britain stands
So long, though first 'twas built on Sands;
And often had sunk but for thy might.
In her own Mainland-storms and Seas:
Be present to her now as then,
And let not proud and factious men
Oppose thy Will with what they please.
Our Free full Senate's to be made;
O, put it in the public voice
To make a legal worthy choice:
Excluding such as would invade
The Commonwealth. Let whom we name
Have Wisdom, Foresight, Fortitude,
Be more with Faith, then Face endu'd;
And sturdy Conscience above Fame.
Such, as not seek to get the Start
In State, by Faction, Power, or Bribes,
Ambitions Bawds: But move the Tribes
By Virtue, Modesty, Desert.
Such, as to Justice will adhere,
Whatever great one it offend;
And from the embraced Truth not bend
For Envy, Hatred, Gifts or Fear.
That by their Deeds will make it known,
Whose Dignity they do sustain;
And Life, State, Glory, all they gain,
Count it Great Britains, not their own.
Such the old Bruti, Decii were,
The Cippi, Curtii, who did give
Themselves for Rome: and would not live,
As men, good only for a year.
Such were the great Camilli too;
The Fabii, Scipio's; that still thought
No work at price enough was bought,
That for their Country they could do:
And to her honor so did knit,
As all their Acts were understood
The Sinews of the Public Good,
And they themselves one Soul with it.
These men were truly Magistrates;
These neither practiced Force, nor Forms,
Nor did they leave the Helm in Storms;
And such they are make happy States.
FINIS.
