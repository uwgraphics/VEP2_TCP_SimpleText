JOHN LILBVRNE.
Anagram. O! I burn in helL.
IF a bold Traitor ('against his God and King)
OF Mercy may have share, John Lilburn bring:
HE kicks against King, Priest, and Prophet too,
NO mischief under Heaven that he will not do.
LAws Sacred, National, and most Humane,
ILlegal are, if Jack (the Jew) complain.
LEnd me your aid, you Limbners that can paint
BRitain's white Devils, or his black grim Saint.
VAne, Mildmay, Bradshaw, Haslerig, and Pim,
ROgues most complea^, but Puneys unto him:
NOne but himself, himself can parallel.
EXpecting this (then) o! I burn in helL.
