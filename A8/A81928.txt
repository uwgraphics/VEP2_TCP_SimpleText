JOHN DURY HIS PETITION TO THE HONORABLE HOUSE OF THE COMMONS IN ENGLAND, NOW
ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT.

LONDON, Printed in the year M.DC.XLI.

To the Honorable, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses met in Parliament, the
humble Petition of JOHN DURY, Minister of the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST.
Humbly shows,
THat whereas for the space of more then ten years bypast, not without
knowledge and permission of his Majesty, with the good liking, approbation, and
furtherance of foreign Protestant Princes and States, and with advice,
encouragement, and instigation of the chief Divines in all the Churches whom it
does concern, the purpose of Ecclesiastical reconcilement amongst Protestants
has been prosecuted, and the means thereof so far advanced, as in a private
Theological way they can be prepared; which by this adjoined brief relation
will appear, and may be made more fully evident by other circumstances of the
Work.

Therefore my humble suit is unto your Honorable Assembly, to be pleased to
take this matter, which so much concerns the glory of God, and the welfare of
his Church, into your pious consideration, to countenance and assist
religiously the same.

And to this effect, if your wisdom think it expedient, some Act or
Declaration might be made,

First, That the blessed, and long sought for union of Protestant Churches may
be recommended unto the public prayers of the Church.

And secondly, That either an Evangelicall correspondency for mutual
edification, for healing of breaches, for taking away of scandals, and for the
advancement of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amongst Protestants, should
henceforth be entertained with foreign Churches, by those to whom the care
of so blessed a work may be with authority referred: Or that his Majesty, with
your Honors advice and grave counsel, might be moved to call together a
general Synod of Protestants in due time, for the better settling of weighty
matters in the Church, which now trouble not only the consciences of most men,
but disturb the tranquillity of public States, and divide the Churches one
from another, to the great hinderance of Christianity, and the dishonor of
Religion. All which evils by this means may be taken out of the way, and from
hence a great blessing of God, and much honor amongst men will redound to this
Church and Nation: And I your humble Petitioner, as in duty bound, will daily
pray for his Majesty's long and happy reign over us, and for the prosperous
success of this high and Honorable Court of Parliament.
