THE Collectors of the old Clothes for the distressed Protestants in Ireland,
do, (to the glory of God, the comfort and praise of these charitable and well
affected People of the City of London) signify that they have received as
much clothing as will Cover the Nakedness of about 12. thousand poor Souls for
which they desire praises may be returned to the God of mercyes in all the
Churches.

And because the charges of repayring, packing, cartage, freight, and other
expenses for the well and orderly transport of the said Clothes will advance to
about 300l. they desire that every well disposed Person will send their further
Charity in money to the warehouse appointed in Basing-hall street, a little from
every one will do the work, and if a greater proportion shall come in, then
is propounded, it shall be carefully sent over to those in greatest necessity
with the Clothes.

They humbly desire that each Man's Charity may be sent in before the tenth of
November next, 1642.
