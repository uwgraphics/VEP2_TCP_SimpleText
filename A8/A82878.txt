THe Lords and Commons in Parliament having received certain notice of a
cessation of Arms concluded with the Rebels in Jreland, And of a purpose to

That all such Merchants, and others who shall be willing to set out Ships at
their own charge, shall have Letters of Mart to take all the Ships, Goods, and
Merchandise, of any person or persons whatsoever in Arms against the King and
Parliament, and not within the protection of Parliament, or that shall be
ayding or assisting to the Rebels of that Kingdom, or of any other in Arms
against the Parliament in either of the Kingdoms of England, Scotland, or
Jreland; And the Committee of the Admiralty are required to grant Commissions
to such persons accordingly.

Ordered that this Order be printed and published, and set upon the Exchange.
