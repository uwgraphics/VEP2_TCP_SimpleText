HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT

Die Veneris. 5 March. 1646.
THe Lords in Parliament Assembled taking into their consideration the
multitude of Beggars, poor, and Vagabonds in and about the Cities of London
Westminster, and in the other parts of this Kingdom; for prevention whereof,
diverse Acts of Parliament have been made, as well to punish such Beggars and
Vagabonds, as also to provide for the relief of poor people, but by reason of
the unhappy distractions of these times, the putting of the Laws into
Execution have been altogether neglected: It is therefore Ordered by the Lords
in Parliament assembled, That the Lord Mayor of the City of London for the time
being, and all Judges and Justices of Assize, and Commissioners of Oyer and
Terminer, and general Goal delivery, in their several Circuits, and Justices
of Peace in their Quarter Sessions, and all other person or persons (who are by
any Act of Parliament entrusted to see the said Acts put in Execution, and the
poor to be provided for) do strictly and carefully put in Execution all and
several the Acts of Parliament, for the punishment of Beggars, Rogues, and
Vagabonds, and for releife of the poor: And the said Judges and Justices of
Assize in their several Circuits, are required to give the said Acts of
Parliament in charge at the Assizes in all the Countries where they shall come
and keep Assize.
