The Publisher unto the Reader.
Discreet Reader,
I Have often times Ruminated in my Retired Contemplation, how fitly man might be
compared to a flower, which as it produces honey, so does it poison; the one
being a Cordial nourisher, the other a Contagious destroyer of man's nature, yet
both the radice of one original: The metaphor is easily digested to an ordinary
apprehension; man's nature being so prone and apt to yield to almost every
attractive motion that attempts to draw it, and is so far from being a
permanent Jewel, that it may be said to be an uncertain momentary nothing;
which who so discreetly reads, the ensuing Treatise, cannot but witness: and
will surely find the Spider of unbridled vanity had sucked so much poison from
that eye pleasing, but sense offending, flower, (given over to work vanity)
that had not that sacridlyingenuous Be, of a converting goodness extended to the
assistance of that precious flower his soul, probability concludes that the
Salamander and Spider of impiety had doubtless extinguished the fire, and
converted to poison the honey that lay treasured there, and so made an object of
pity of him whom Charity in joins me to suppose a happy subject of mercy. And
truly as to a flower, so to a Camelion may man fitly be alluded, that can
assume any shape but white: intimating that though we could become lewd and
licentious, either to riot or rage, yet not we but it must be somewhat Heavenly
that makes our scarlet Transgressions white as snow, innocent and righteous.
And since the holy Spirit lays down this as an assertion, that more were
converted by president then precept, I am confidentto presuppose that whosoever
reads considerately the ensuing lines will readily acknowledge this to be a
President for Conversion, and a Precept for Conviction, of such as stand either
in, or well affected to, those Impieties.

And as I cannot but much condemn the past part of his life being dishonest, so
must I of necessity commend his resolution to become a new man for the future,
the residue of the time he has to live: And that the world may receive benefit
by it, as well as himself, therefore has he solidly and pertinently laid open
the mystery of their iniquity. And since that God himself has said, there is
joy in Heaven over every sinner that repents, God forbid but that which makes
Heaven rejoice should exhilerate us, and so make the earth to be lifted up in
mirth and triumph for that act of blessedness.

And as I commend him and joy for him, so I do heartily wish that it may
occasion more joy, by working powerfully on them that shall peruse it, that so
his joy might be their joy, and that the joy of us all; that so with the Be we
may suck honey out of the stinking Hemlock, and be included in that Maxim,
Foelix quem faciunt aliaena pericula cautum.

I do also much commend the noblenes of his spirit, that having deserved of his
Country to die thinks himself unworthy in the same to live, and so freely
exiles himself, that having wronged her by his abuses, he may show his
willingness to requite her, and regain his own lost honor, by writing in bloody
Characters the heroic evidences of a manly spirit on the Carkases of her
enemies; and as it is his seemingly earnest endeavors, let it be our real care
and labor to fly from evil to do good, and thereby attain what follows, To live
for ever.

Farewell.
The Author to the Reader, wishes health and happiness hear and hereafter.
Dear Countrymen and Friends,
BEfore I appear to be judged by your discretion, know I appeal to Mercy not to
Justice, the one may give me life, though the other require my death; and the
sin-pardoning God of mercy give me a heart that may live answerable to what I
now profess, and to abominate what heretofore I have practiced, and let
Charity expiate what either may condemn me or displease you; and look not on me
as an impious Saul, and therein a persecutor of the innocent, though I must
readily confess I have deserved it, but as another, a converted Paul, which I
humbly pray I may live worthy of, that so if I should meet with my old
Companions and they upbraid me with what I was, I may answer with a Holy man to
him, Such a one as thou art was I once, but such a one as I am will thou searce
ever be. And Charity being a Christians proper ornament, nay the crown of his
virtues, I hope to find your Christianity in pardoning my past Offenses, which
with joy I find Heaven has remitted: For now remains Faith and Hope (both
which are sweet to my soul) and Charity, but the greatest of these is Charity;
since then all remain, they are of use, and their use is to refresh the soul,
and if the soul then a soul, and so mine.

And if your expectations make you inquisitive to know the Cause of my
appearing in Print, let your patience lead you to peruse the Discourse itself,
and the Introduction will satisfy your curiosity. I could enlarge on that
subject were there any necessity for it, but my endeavors centure in a desire
not to write much, but to be brief and pertinent; and to that extends what I
have there expressed, which I judge sufficient, and then to add were superfluous,
though I readily acknowledge it seems to me necessary to explain the original
Cause that led me to that Licentious Course of life, but that were to open a
wide wound in the credits of those to whom I owe my education, when that time
may be better spent to heal my own; but in a word, it was their too tender love
that supplied my youthful fancy with such a redundancy of Coin, that prompt me
on to such exorbitant prodigality, that my estate, though competent to maintain
me in credit, was too little to supply my immoderate extravigancies, which
custom and Company had wedded me unto. I had a purpose some months since, to
have done what now I have accomplished, but some contradicting fancies
smothered these intentions for a time, till being engaged in an out Land
Employment, I determined when my fate should send me to the Seas, to send a
small Tract to the Press, that so when I went into foreigne Nations abroad,
this might undertake a trasicking voyage at home, to the commodity of my native
Nation.

And I am bold to think no man will wonder at my obscure concealing of my
self, since to own the Subject might reflect disparagement, not only on me
but on my Family, for gladly could I embrace the shame, being sensible of my
own deserts: So that though Heaven has been gracious to forget, I desire still
to remember my own unworthiness, not for ought, but that thereby I may be
humbled, and God glorified that in mercy has showed mercy, which the Lord
grant unto us all Grace here, that we may have Glory hereafter.

Farewell. From on Shipboard in the Downs, September 20. 1657.
A NEW DISCOVERY OF THE HIGHWAY THEIFES. BEING A seasonable advice of one
lately converted from them, to Gentlemen and Travelers to avoid their
Villainy, etc.
THE PROLOGUE.
THey who look either for a fine phrase, or a sublime lofty strain from me,
will come as far short of their expectation, as he that seeks for happiness in
this transitory World; my theme and my aim being only truth, not curiosity,
makes me rather industrious to benefit by Instruction, then pleasant by
delighting the fancy with Rhetorique; But as my miscarriages have rendered me
odious in my own sight, so in sincerity I shall endeavor to make my self
hateful in the eyes of my misdemeanors, by showing its nakedness to the
World, that so I hateing it, it may also abominate me, and inveterate enmity
rend our late amity to a perpetual discord, and I become an example to others
to stear their action by a scale of piety, lest doing otherways, expose them as
it did me to the greatest exigent Imaginable, which divine providence having
snatched me from, I intended by its assistance to become a friend to my
Country, by being an enemy to my late Company and Courses, which were obnoxious
and exorbitant, which when I embraced in the arms of an undaunted resolution,
I thought those my dishonest courses legitimate, and far more noble then the
esteemed babe of baseness, and sneaking way of borrowing, arguing thus though
inconsistent with honor, that it was far better taking of a purse by violence
from a stranger, then borrowing not intending to pay, and so with a complement
to rob my Friends, and familiar acquaintance, when the former was usually
repaid by the Country being lost on the Rode, so that many were better able to
bear, contributing to my wants, then one or two, or a few: when and to which I
neither promise, nor with a thousand oaths swear to repay them, as they that
borrow most usually do: thus I was, and others are, poor wretches deluded by
Satan, who tells the Quarrellor that to affront a meek Man is noble, and the
Envious, that revenge is sweet, representing sin in its false dress, that so
it may neither be unpleasing to the Cautious, nor terrible to the Fearful, but
conformable to every disposition.

But the better to stifle and overcome these temptations, let us consider first
that every action has its proper end, if it be good, the end will be
answerable, for the end though it come last, it is first proposed, and guides
the whole course, thence it is that I giving the raines of my actions to
deboystnesse, had well-nigh ended in destruction here, which leads to a
greater hereafter, these serious thoughts hereof in my restraints fixed a
conviction on my conscience, that the end of sin cannot be happy, because there
remains some thing to come after it, which the spirit of truth says is
death, the due wages of sin, and it is want of the thoughts of the end, that
makes the end of so many, wretched; The Epicure thinks the only means to make
him happy, is to indulge to sensuality, and pleasures taken up at any rate, and
the Drunkard imagines it consists in abundance of wine, like Bonosus, of
whom it was said, he was not born to live, but lived to toss a pot, who being
outdrank by one, he looked on it as an infamy, and therefore hanged himself for
vexation, of whom it was then said in dirision, there hangs a Tankard, and no
man, here is the way, and the end.

Secondly, that after an expiration of life, there is another being to be
expected, an eternal state, the happiness or wretchedness whereof consists in
the former consideration, a due weighing, that all our actions Center in a good
end, which end is an eternal state, the consequence of this opened my eyes to
see the vanity of my villainy and youthful exorbitancies; In so much that true
conviction of spirit, and no self end, or intrest, or hope of favor has
prompt me on to this discovery, but my wounded conscience that makes me fear
the displeasure of a Deity, more then death, knowing in my retired thoughts,
that it is my duty toward God, and my Country, to unfould those secrets that
may ruin violence, and preserve indemnified Innocence, I shall therefore
unlock the door, and show you the deceiveing ways, acts and offenses of the
Highway Councels, being of that horrid nature, that they deserve the punishment
both of body and soul.

CHAP. II. An absolute Defiance of all those that follow my former lewd Courses.
NOW you lycentious Rebels that would be deemed Knights of the Road, I detest
your actions, for which I have showed my reason before; I begin my discovery,
then since your deceit must be divulged, pluck of your Beards, Vizards, Hoods,
Parches, Wens, Mufflers, and false Perriwigs, all unnatural, together with
those other disguises, that obscure the due proportion of your faces, that I
may make known unto the world and let them see, whether you possess so much
grace as may make you blush at the repetition, of the vileness of your ways,
the which I fear you want, which conjecture arises by the experience of my own
former hardness of heart when it was my own case; which in ordinate
gracelessnesse I so much commiserate in my mind, that I could with joy deposite
my blood to extenuate your transgression and that they might be no more; but
sound reason tells me I may be far more advantageous in serving of my native
nation if I live, by showing them your baseness and instructing them how to
avoid the danger of the same, that so Travelers may be secure and such as have
an inclining fancy to your practice may by the unworthiness of the art be
dissuaded from a closure with your wickedness, who ever therefore casts an
affectionate eye upon this highway business as a course belonging to a
Gentleman, shows himself to be ignoble, and is certianly blind, it being
clearly speculative to every discerning eye as not only base in it self, but
infamous in its end, which ought to be regarded in every undertaking. It is in
part admitted, that a Gentleman by birth and education destituted of means and
action too, may by the haughtiness of his spirit be lifted up to disdain, want
as a Tyrant, that may through its oppression make him rebel, and so cause him
to attempt this art though void of honor, when no nobler an employment
presents him with a maint'nance, but now when employments in the sports of Mars
his fiery blows affords both maintenance and honor in the exercise of arms,
against our nations foes, it is more becoming them though stained in their
reputations, to endeavor their by the deeds of martial power to snatch the
wreath of honor out of victorys hands in the field of proud Belona; then in
disgrace and infamy to besot their spirits in the arms of wanton Venus at
home, though I am deeply sensible that the major part of the professors of
this mystery and villainy, are so frequently apt to glory in that which truly is
their shame, supposing themselves to be the best of men who are the worst of
villains, because they are styled Captains and Leivtenants by the drawers of
the Inns when its likely they are but lately rose from that doglike life of
lackyes like the fool that is proud of his own wit, because another in dirision
Ironically says he is wondrous wise.

CHAP. III. The Oath every young Theife takes when he is admitted into the
brotherhood, with other the Orders at the investation of him with that honor
of one of the Knights of the Road.
MOst disconsolate is the state of that man, that beleives not that their is a
God, but far more wreched is his condition that knowing and believing there is
a diety, shall un-God in his mind and to himself the Trinity, by worshipping
the Devil, and men's actions best speakeing their hearts, we may conclude of
those that they are all diabolical, all having erred, and there is none
righteous no not one; for fearing that their actions were not sinful enough to
conjoyne a oneness between them and the Devil; this is their practice at their
first admittance they confer an Oath of such foul stuff, as if with more then
a threefould cord, which is not easily broken, they would tie themselves to sin
by their perjury, like him, that swears to be true to falsehood (which implies
an impossibility) by reading a charge of secrecy that what ever misfortune
happens to cloud their freedom by rendering them as an object to Justice and
the Law, they shall conceal their accomplices to the death, or against any other
jeopardy what so ever, burying in oblivion not only his confederates, but also
the manner of his entrance into that accursed way, and further they proceed to
swear him, that if the Judges should further press you on to a discovery of
particulars, then you must cunningly create some men in your fancy, devising
not only names, but to each man a particular feature, as such a beard, such a
nose, such eyes, and such hair, such a stature, such an age, cunningly finding
to each a dwelling and possession; provided you be sure to place them at a
distance far enough, and then before inquiry be made, the danger of your trial
will be past, and it may be your pretended discovery may purchase favor from
the bench for discovering of such a one as was never thought on before; how if
you are examined why and how you fell into these courses; you must tell them
that you came up to London, or some other eminent place, with an intent to go
to service, but before you could provide your self, you had spent all your
money, here fetching a great sigh, looking very, sad confessing that necessity
constraining you to it to supply your wants, you fell into these wicked
courses, which will make them think you are a poor young man newly drawn aside,
and so cause them to take pity of your condition; then must you promise never
to commit the like offense: but if their mercy extend to the remission of your
guilt, it shall not only wrest you from the due punishments of the Law, but
from the prosecution of your past evils, that so as you escape the one, you
will also forsake the other, this is the only way being in jeopardy to acquit
you from those afflictions incident to the like offenses by the justice of an
imparcial Law, and by these means you will not only qualify the guilt of it, but
have liberty to fall to your old courses, nor must conscience trouble you, but
dispense with every impiety, and glory in the greatest iniquities; thus in all
kind of goodness they are slack, but apt and readily prone to do evil with a
kind of eagerness and delight, having resolved to grow old in the most
exquisite practice of vice.

CHAP. IV. The order prescribed, or the charge given by the eldest Thief, to
the rest before they attempt.
AS every proceeding has its aim and end, so has their undertakings its aim
to do evil, to rob and steal, and to spoil the innocent, its end to conviction
and punishment and these to extremes also, its mean degrees of carriage for
being admitted, and that admittance graced or rather insatiated in villainy,
they receive those precepts that may advantage their designed wickedness; for
Satan having led them by the hand unto that place which experience concludes as
most commodious for their purpose, they retire and lie in wait in some byplace
most advantageous and least suspicious, which yields the eye the prospect of
the road, to strictly view the booties, that others misfortunes may enrich
their's, and the honest man's loss be their gain, and then the oldest Theif as
they repair to their stations pleads the precepts of his experience, and as an
arch Ingen of the Devil, draws every advantage that may promote his cause to
the longest extent in this due order following, ye that are sworn Knights of
the road be ruled by me, whose long experience makes me able to command, and my
love to you willing to instruct you, thus must you place your maskes and
chin-cloath and fit it at a moment to disguise your faces, thereby to blind the
intellects of such as by constraint pay tribute to your wants, who then can
know and with considerat heed directly swear you are the men, when these
artificial vizards, are withdrawn, and so the visible tokens vanish that might
inform men's knowledge what you are, and that your words may have a different
sound, alter the utterance of your speech by putting pibles in your mouths,
that so as your habit, face and hair obscure your discovery, your speech
reputed undisguisable, may darken and not give light to your discovery, and
then ingeniously contrive a watch word to your selves that may occasion no
suspicion, as what is a Clock, a question common in almost every mouth, which
being named, let every man fall to his proper work, those that are strongest at
the grasp, let them seize first, always duly observing this, to catch the
bridle with your left hand, and with the right, seize on your sword, for your
just guard, and if they do resist, the one prevents their flight, the other
cuts his courage, the weaker sort whose charge is to bid stand, and so confront
the Horses head, present them with a pistol fit for to discharge, if they deny
delivering of their purse, so that either by consent, if not constraint,
enforce them to yield.

CHAP. V. The manner of their assault, with their Courage in and after the
Action.
THus being in readiness, let one cry arm, arm my Comrades. Whilst he is
talking thus, a prize comes by or in their sight, if up the Hill they meet him,
if down, they bid you follow close at their heels, where each having singled
out his choice, which he likes to deal with, the coast being clear, they fall
up to their close order, and side by side they jointly seize their prize, where
sometimes the baseness of some spirits, make them unworthy of what they are,
men; for when nature has bestowed the full proportion of their limbs, to make
them of the largest manly size, yet so base is their spirts, so different are
the qualities of men, that no sooner the word deliver is let loose, but they
are supprised so with fear, that like babes, they cry and tremble before there
is any weapon drawn to affright them, and oft-times their purses are as poor as
their courages, which makes thieves resolute and desperate to the like attempts
again, when occasion offers a trial, but then on the contrary, to their
praise, I speak it, that some in comparison to those taller men, are pignies,
yet of so undaunted resolution and unrefistible courage, that neither threats
of death or torture can dull the edges of their courageous spirits, but that
before they will yield to men, they will stoop to death; but when power and might
subdues them to the Robbers basest will, then they withdraw unto a secret
place, and search the secret parts where money use to lie, with so strict care,
that sooner may they quoine, then save one penny for their need, where if they
find some gold by chanes, quilted for more security, they call them Villains,
and dishonest men, because they seek to save what is their own, which they call
cousonage, at which the poor Traveller cries he is utterly undone, because he
loses then his whole estate, and by his means, endeavors to move their stony
hearts, but it is impossible to mollify those Flints with tears, or move those
Adimants with sighs or groans, whose consciences sleep fast in villainy, never
moved at a poor man's loss or straits, but prompt for the desire of unlawful
gain, to act the parts of fiends not, men; nor does your business centur in
those wrongs, but higher swell, oft-times exchanging horses with a jest, that
it is no robbery, desperately engaging them thus robbed, to swear they shall not
follow you by hew and cry, or by means of a general rising of the towns
adjacent; and so robbed, rifled, and amazed you leave them wrapped in woes, and
haste away to secure your selves, where every Crow that flies, exstracts a
fear, and every Calfe or Coult that stirs or makes the brushes rush, seems to
your fearful fancy, a Constable to apprehend you for your theft, which sets
your wits upon the tenters of the most severest exigents, I speak not at a
giusse, but what I know, for lately when a Robbery was done, a strong confusion
rose by so small means, as cannot but engage the serious to admire the timerity
of their dejected minds, for an Owl who to gain shelter from the troubles of
the uncouth days, when all the ayery tribe wandering, flock to him, screen'd
now in the obscure retired residence of a hollow tree, no sooner was he got
into his den, but between discontent and joy, he seemd to rend his hollow
residence with fatal whoops, and much amazing screeks which infused such a
terror in their distrustful minds, that whips, switches and spurs were set on
furious exercise to out-speed the wind in their quick flight, for fear those
hollows were voices of the Country men, following them in their great hasty
speed, to save themselves, thus does a continual fear attend their motion;
Insomuch that they fear very shadow of themselves, till some by-Inn, affords a
shelter to your baseness, where you fall to a division of your spoils, but
here you appear in your colors, by acting a cheat to your Robbery, and play
the double Thieves, first rob honest men, and then your selves, with bloody
oaths cheating your bosom friends, reserving the best part unto your selves,
from those you dare abuse, and to defend your justness, dam your selves to the
lowest region of the worst of places: thus have I often found your perjury; sad
it is to do wickedly, but most desperate to load on sin, with the weight of
another.

CHAP. VI. The unblessedness of their gains, and how soon they spend what they
thus unlawfully get.
THat which is founded on an unjust and unsound, principal, can have no good
or substanciall being or continuance, and that which is punished by fraud and
deceit is wasted as likely with a blast, as it was gotten unjustly with abuses,
so that it matters not whether it be little or much that is gotten, since the
quality destroys the quantity being purchased with fin and sometimes that sin
died with blood, and as says the proverb, il-goten goods never prospers, nor
can they ever thrive who like rolling stones, are always moving from place to
place, but as the devil was your frined in enterprising your wretched act, so
are you his vessels in spending in adoration of him what you have gained, so
that to have much is to as little purpose, as for a man to thatch his dwelling
house with snow which the beams of Phoebus, dissolves in drops, for Inns and
Taverns, those common sincks of sin, that know our wicked ways in larg our
biles to sink our coin in their unbotomed pouches, who knowing our wicked ways
presume we dare not cavile, least all prove ill for us, so that if right
considered we rob for them not for our selves, and as with sin we purchased
what we had, so they with cousenage rob us, leaving remediless our wrongs that
live by fraud, to make them swim in wealth, so thrifty is their way that on the
ruins of the country they do subsist, which makes them rich in plenty, as we
penurious through our want of coin spent in excess; for some I know who had a
trible part of all we gained, as being Master of us all, and yet his gains
oftimes came short to countervaile his for'st expense and prodigality, yet was
he wary if I truly view him in his station, lest too much vapouring should
occasion suspicion, whence I conclude that want of a blessing on our continual
practiced trade, which is accursed, made all to vanish as if it had never been,
he only suffering us to rain till we were fit for the scourge of his wrath, who
spares long to see if grace will work its proper end, conversion: as ever
blessed be his name it has on me, but if in stead of contrition, there appear
nesse of heart, then God, lets loose Justice to execute due vengence on the
actors of such hellish deeds: First apprehension, next imprisonment, then
conviction then last of all, to conclude the tragical interlude of your
exorbitances, comes the period of your life by a shamfull death which the law
extracts as a due debt we owe to Justice.

Hearty disswasions with my best endeavors to reclaim them. BOOK II.
CHAP. I. The misery of an imprisoned estate, which must be the first step of
satisfying the Law.
LIberty, that rich inheritance of all that are born to live, and live to dye,
as it is the sweetest of enjoyment next that imperial gem of health, so the
want thereof, next to sickness, must needs be of all other the most bitter,
since then to be confined unto the confines of a Jaile is to be in part unmand
what and how great is that wretchedness that is occasioned by a want not only
of liberty, but a continual dread of a shameful death, and that made more
terrible by the unavoidable expectation of an eternal imprisonment, where
there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing, of Teeth with flames of
unquenchable fire for ever more; for like the pitcher that though it go often
to the well, yet comes it broken home at last: o then forsake this life, lest
the prison become your Inn, and the terror of that place full of tortures are
so exsasperated by the imagination of a noble mind, that hell it self cannot
contain more exquisite woes and pains, a continuance whereof wear sufficient to
punish all offenses, if the law dispensed with that debt due to Justice the
life of the offenders: for you no sooner enter here but a thousand vices in a
hundred licentious wretched souls surround you, where sighing is their air,
their comfort coldness, and their fooddispair, and when the keeper with the
grim aspect of his stern cuntenance makes you tremble with the fear of a new
marterdom, whilst the insulting rascal on the tiptoes of his pride, screws his
il-favored face to a stern frown, which so dejects the spirit of the imprisoned
slaves, that the contrition of their looks seems to implore his smiles whose
divilish heart having renounced remorse casts a defiance in their pitious face,
and not there unquiet hours only do taste the gall of bitterness but the sweet
minutes of their rest, if that rude place afford them any, are frighted with
your cares or some rude noise of beastly creatures from whose drunken voices
comes unwelcome sounds, oaths, cursing the Stars, the Earth, and all that's
represented to his thoughts blaspheming God, banning Angels, and their
creditors, reviling fate, in that he is heir only to fortuns frowns, and to be
sure, if only a small spark of wickedness came with him to this worldly hell,
you accomplish the highest exigent of shame before you come to shake hands and
part, and grow a subtle Artist in the Devils Trade of sin. Most in consistant
then is the fond practice of the vulgar sort who say, a prison will reclaim the
faults of youth, when it is most true they do precipitate their utter over throw,
for ill exsamples purge not sin, but adultrate the will that is pron to folly,
so that the prisoners living deaths are feeling moniments of wretchedness, and
yet are only prologues to those tragedies, your over throws record in
characters of blood this will instruct you what it is to die not unto nature,
but far worse to a perpetual infamy.

CHAP. II. By showing them how much they are mistaken in other Men's opinions of
them.
MEN may be witty yet not wise, subtle yet not discreet, as it fares with
most of you, who think, though vainly, that by attempting deeds ignoble will
purchase you esteem, renown, and honor in the popular, vulgar eye, as if to
act base villainy were the way to be admired, not scorned, as though the actions
you have done, are such as have contracted amity with honor, and so engaged
Men in Authority to protect your lives, that in despite of Law you must
survive; so from the Jayle unto the gallows, in a presumptuous safety you are
sent careless of danger, where justice tells you your conceits are vain, as are
your lives, expenses and ungodly trade, for men whose judgments stear by piety,
justly condem your sin, and pity you for charity, not your desert, and since
my sincere endeavor has thus discovered you and your disguise, besure they will
know your tricks to well to be entrapped by you, since your fained worths are
obvious cheats, and faint protectors of your wickedness, seace, and give over
those acts of fiends not men, which makes you as much the effigies of Satan,
as God created you the Image of Himself.

CHAP. III. By putting them in mind of their wicked and cursed ends, (which
they fondly and foolishly jest at, as also their reward in the World to come.
GOD concludes him cursed, and man most miserably wretched that hangs upon a
Tree, which besides the shame that attends you and your posterity, the death it
self might with the cursedness of it, dissuade you to put a period to the
practice of that great wickedness, in which consists the violation of a
command, and so a breaking of the whole Law, neither dies not your shame with
your body, but your Family though never so Noble, suffers a wrent in their
honor, by partiscipating of the Infamy you suffer, which for some ages rest
dyed with scandal, although never so much innocent of the crime, and yet those
senseless Catiffes who inherit this death by their transgressions, laugh at
this heavy curse, as at a sport, and call it pleasure to be pluck to heaven in
a string, and thus by the power of Satan are they prompt onwards to laugh at
their own ruin, whilst what affrights others with an apprehention of horror,
does rather move them with a kind of pleasing joy to delight themselves, who
think the more they become conformable to the Devil, the nearer they approached
happiness, but the same weakness that leads you on in confidence to those so
groundless hopes, may prompt you one step farther to presume, as I found mercy,
so may you from God and men, I wish to you the glorious grace I found, but pray
consider a particular, cannot Compose a general, one Swallow makes no summer,
and know that if mercy did extend to wave heavens and earths wrath from me, yet
grace twice offended, tribles the vengeance of a severe just Judge, and for your
sufferings here by death, that is but a taste of those highly bitter and
everlasting sorrows that are reserved in store, for such as defile their lives
with so great sin, as makes heaven execute the heat of wrath wrath, as the
due merit of your heinous sin; which to prevent, there is only one means left,
and that is contrition; if there remain yet any sparks or likelihood of grace,
though but so much as may occasion one good thought: and if that unto sin you
have not made a lasting league of servitude, behold your fact with a relenting
eye of pity: thereby to purchase ease and comfort to your sad dispairing souls:
then happy men, not that you have been base, but that from sin yon have
retired to sanctity. Times never past to mend, better late then never; for he
that delights to persevere in sin, not being able to appeal to Christ, and to
his merits, but with a willing greediness lays hold on his damnation. And if
no sense of things seculiar can convict those hardened hearts, if not a
temporal, yet an eternal death must needs move sense of danger; the one is but
breath, the other endless everlasting pain, which ere it be ended is still
renewed in burning lakes of brimstone that never die, but burn with cruel
tortures for each heinous sin; where howls and hollow groans adds to the
eternal weight of misery, when frosts, fires, drownings, sulphur, and other the
worst of punishment attend their wretched souls: this is the sad period of your
ways, which if it work not its desired end, I Will cease to labor to persuade
you more. But on the contrary, if I cannot convert you, I could willingly
convict you: and here I could name both you, and your abode, but that you have
no constant residence, but for a night in some by-road, and so away, either
into the West, or North, or sometimes into the South: And as your dwellings you
change, so do you every day your names; so that in shape, in being, place and
name, you change with every day, like the mutable Cameleon, but never into
white Innocence: And thus to inform, were but to put in doubt the Inquisitive,
and not at all inlighten to your due apprehension.

CHAP. IV. An Ingenuous discovery of them to each discerning eye, by infallible
tokens how to know them on the Road, and if robbed, how surely to track them.
THe uncertainty of your attire, and various disguises, with your
non-residence, and changible names, makes me incapable to do what I would;
therefore I will do what I can, and in every lineament so pourtract you and
your carriages to every man that seriously shall peruse this Treatise, that
with ease, not difficulty, he may know you as you ride, and by that means
enable him to provide for his own security; or if by you robbed, let him but
observe my directions and he need not question to apprehend you, when your
sense of dangers is past, and you in your thoughts secure. You shall have it
may be two or three of them overtake you, and pretend if they feared your
strength, that they were lately affronted in the Wood by eight or ten stout
fellows; but they beat the rogues, and made them fly to save themselves, and
seal this with strong oaths, and by your answer sound your spirits whether
valiant or no; which if they find apt to be danted, then they wait an
opportunity to act their roguery on you; and it may be sometimes they boast in
drink, what they have done to others, as now to you; and as a reward for what
unwillingly you lend to them, they will pretend to give you a word that shall
protect you from the like affront again far better then your sword; as,
Round-de-la-vera-hay, The Moon shines bright, or the like; but these are
cheats, and no securing powers: It Is true, when we were ready to seiz a prize,
and spied a friend, or other company coming near, we used some such words, to
bid our company forbear a while for our own safeties sake, which honest
Travelersignorant of any wrong, suspected nothing, whilstwe by these knew what
we had to do, but else those words we valued not, for prize and nothing else
could satisfy our minds that fought for money; therefore never believe them;
but observe, dear Countrymen my better rules for your security, which for your
sakes I Will take the honest pains to write in plain-wise, not deceitfully.

BOOK III. Plain, instructions for the honest Traveller, that he may pass in
safety on the way.
CHAP. I. What he is to take heed unto before be begin his Journey.
DEar Countrie-men that travel on the Road, the past-part of my wicked life
having been consumed in sin, and that sin maintained by the spoil of
Passengers; I seeing the wretchedness of that state, find how much I am bound
to satisfy the debt I owe you, to the uttermost of my power, which reaches to
no more satisfactory an act, then good advise how to avoid the dangers of the
road, and what I speak herein is the issue of my long sinful experience; as
thus, when you carry a charge about you, let secrecy conceal your money, and
the time of your departure in your breast, fot it is a custom no less common
then indiscreet; when you undertake a journey, to blase that undertaking
amongst your reputed friends, who out of seeming love, drink healths to your
good Journey, and your safe return; this gloss of friendship expiates the
least mistrust of wrong or thought of Ill, when by those means I have often
known a Son betray his Father, a Brother his Brother, and one friend another;
in condescending and complotting with some thievs who for his giving notice of
the prize, shares one quarter, or more, of that gain he so betrays; when but
for this fond humor they had not been discovered and waylaien; and which is
worst, sometimes you choose a guard to succor you, and to take your part, in
whom you trust, who often does bring you into danger, without the least suspicion
on your part; for when they bid you stand, he will draw as in a valiant rage, and
with some one appointed for that use, hack swords, whilst another threatens his
death; if he stand on those terms of seeming honor: you seeing his false
danger fear his death, and bid him yield, which he though willing seems loath to
do: nay more, he knowing well which way they fled, will send the Hue and cry
another way; and if you suppose you know any of them that did the robbery, and
do hit right, he persuades you, that whilst they fought his disguise fell off,
and therefore he marked him, and knows it is not the man, and with pensive look
he will lament your bad hap: and thus your bosom friend betrays you.

CHAP. II How to carry themselves in their Inns.
IT is as common a custom, as a cunning policy in thievs, to place Chamberlains
in such great Inns where Cloathiers and Grasiers use to lie; and by their large
bribes to infect others, who were not of their own preferring; who noteing your
purses when you draw them, they will gripe your cloak-bags, and feel the weight,
and so inform the Master thievs of what they think, and not those alone, but
the Host himself is often as base as they, if it be left in charge with them all
night; he to his roaring guests, either gives item, or shows the purse it self,
who spend liberally; in hope of a speedy recruit: and all this is occasioned by
want of discretion in managing your business for the best; therefore be secret,
and let little be made known to those that watch to do you wrong.

CHAP. III Showing the danger of traveling on the Sabbath day.
HE that expects a blessing from the Father of blessings above, must so behave
himself in the eyes of Heaven, whilst on earth, that he must live here, as if
he were there already; and the only way so to do, is to stear our actions by
Gods command, which says, Keep holy my Sabbath Day, in which we ought to
remember Gods rest from labor, and rest our selves from sin; for when we come
short of this, Gods love and protection goes so far beyond us, that we can
feel no joy in that dark night which is out of his presence; which made Moses
say, Except thou O God go along with us, let us not go hence: thence it, is
that few which Travel on this day, escape the hands of thievs; for they know
none ride at that time, but on great and urgent business and that can scarce be
don without great store of Coin; so that if they once are seen, they sure are
robbed imediately: and though the Country are enjoined to pay what you shall
lose by day, yet not on this; because it is a day of rest; and as you are
remediless, being robbed so helpless before, for there is no Company to aid
the honest Traveller as at other times.

CHAP IV. How to know a Thief from an honest man.
Be sure on the Road to associate with none but such as you find inclined
rather to leave your company, then keep it; for such as press to be near you,
though against your will, are very dangerous: but I Will presently inform you how
to know if they be Thievs or not. Take occasion to make some stay, then note
whether they stay, or keep their pace, or else alight and go on foot that you
may overtake them; follow some half an hour aftet a slow pace, and if you
overtake them, take heed, for that is the surest symptom of a Thief: The other
usual marks of Thievs be these, which as you ride you may discern so plain,
that you need not doubt the truth of what you think. They muffle their faces
with their cloaks, or else their cloak or coat hides all their clothes; they
have a hand-kercher or scarf, which with their hand they will rear up to their
eyes, over their faces just when they bid you stand. And if by occasion of my
discovery they leav off this, that you may miss your observation: besure so
soon as they come somewhat near you, fix your eye full in their face, and you
shall see them turn their faces on one side which if they do, then keep you
distantce, ride from them; and mark whether their face and beards agree
together, and are not counterfeit: and above all things shun him that rides in
a Mountier-Cap; and such as whispers often, and are inquisitive after your
business; or what your imploiments are, for it is to know what you have about
you.

CHAP V. Showing how dangerous it is to grow familiar with any stranger upon
the Way.
WHen you take your Journie whither the occasion calls you with a friend, you
pass not far before your company is increased by a third: when there is two
to one, there is no fear of him being alone, before you call him
fellow-traveller, and joie in his company, and he in yours: but before you
have rid 10 miles together on your way he overtakes some three more of his
Company, then he shakes and tremble, and seems afraid; and cries, Directly
friends we are fore-laid; if ye have Charge about you, let me know it, we will
fight it out; if we have naught to lose, we were best yield: By these like
words he will quickly find whether the prize be rich; and whilst you thought
there had been three to three, there is four to two: If they find you armed,
then one who they find fittest for the work, they cloth in Russet, like a
Country-bore, in his high-shoo's, with twists of Hay instead of Boots, a goad
in his hand, riding aside upon a saddle made of a wispe of straw, who rides
cheek by joul with you, and causes mirth by his most simple talk; you not so
much as think he is capable of hurt: but when he has brought you into their
snare, he seizes one, and your new fellow-traveller the other, the rest com in,
and then it is in vain to strive, for nothing less then your money will
ransom you out of their hands.

CHAP VI. How, when, and where to ride.
THose so many prodigious ways to rob the Innocent, bids every man be wary
how, and when he rides, and where: if he have any charge about him, let me
advise you not to ride by day, but by night; but for those base sheep-stealing
punie rogus, that hazard their necks for a Noble, I am unacquainted with their
actions; therefore I do not undertake to show their deceits; but for those
Cutters on the road, I can assure you, you are free from any horsman
whatsoever: for it is their rule, that surely none by night will ride that are
worth robbing. Next, they must keep civil hours, for fear that through
mistrust they are apprehended; therefore it is their chief care to take their
Inn betimes: and more, they hardly dare adventure in the dark, because they
cannot see either your dangerous defenses, or their own advantages, or spy
pistols or other private weapons: and you have time your money to convey from
them, and diverse other advantages the day denies; but since this is ordained
for rest, I can say no more, but it is my best advice, to keep yom from the
dangers of the road: and it is a general rule with high-way-men, to keep their
station upon the greatest roads, that of those number which pass by, they may
select such as they think are richest prize: but on your petty rodes, where
scarc any use to pass; they never use to come: there you may pass secure:
which I advise you choos if possible you can, rather then on great reads. But
it is a foolish custom you have gotten, when you ride by any place that
commonly speaks danger, you bussle up together side by side, which is most
commonly your overthrow: but take my counsel here, when e're you ride in fear,
especially, ride far asunder, a Buts length at least, and then be sure they
will never attempt to rob you, when your straggling order will give some of you
leave undoubtedly to escape, and to raise the Country in their pursuit:
Besides, their Company is set in several parties, when should you ride in a
cluster, they will surely sallie out; and seiz their purchase; when if they
should fall upon a straggling party, before they can do any thing it is strange
but rescue comes, which easily will make the Cutters fly.

CHAP. VII. If he be beset.
I Have thus traced them in every meander of their sinful courses, whereby to
discover them to you, that you may avoid them; it shall be my next work to
instruct you how to behave your self if unhappily you are beset; Look not as if
amazed about, as if you hoped for rescue, this incourages them to height of
resolution; but look as stern as they, and so, as if to fear you were a
stranger, and make your brow the throne of rage and fury; and this is the
readiest and most certain way to save your money, and your reputation too; for
they fighting with a guilty conscience within, and without against a
Countrie-Law and Justice, right and equity, which I speak by experience, if
nobly you resist, will make the most undaunted spirit of them all stoop to
discouragement; for I have known them that of themselves have been of so
unresistable a resolution, that they durst out-brave the roaring Canon to the
mouth, and scorn to stoop to baseness; yet in this act, when men have but
seemed to resist, they have shook and trembled, even to a remorse of their
wickedness; for though they swear to shoot you if you yield not, it is but to
fright you, for they dare not do it, because they know that murder never
escapes the hand of heavens just punishment, and by thus doing oftentimes
Thievs may be taken, and so others freed by their apprehension from the like
danger you were in, and by this act you will gain honor and repute.

CHAP. VIII. By telling them of a fault most Travelers are guilty of, if
Thievs assault them.
YOur meanest hearts submit too soon, and oft-times yield almost before they
bid you stand, and then wish they may escape, that so the Hundred may repair
your loss, if they are not apprehended by the Hue and Cry, and unworthily you
oft-times ad to, and if not double the sum, knowing the Hundred will be glad
for to compound; and so you cozen both the Country and the Thievs, and to
convince them that you fought like men, you cut and slash your clothes, and
swear they did it in the fight who robbed them; when yet ten to one your blows
were tears, crying for life, and then bid them take all; but these ignoble
spirits I hate, and by my work intend no love to them, but to the nobler sort.

CHAP. IX. If by chance he be unawares surprised, how to behave himself.
BUt if by your own negligence, and the frowns of fate, the pleasure of your
Journie be eclipsed and clouded by a sudden surprisal, blame not me, who
endeavor if you please to hinder those accidents if you be careful, else the
fault's your own; Yet let me still advise you what to do if you see no hopes
but you must yield, strive not at all when it is too late, but give the fairest
words you can, racking your finest wits to please their ear; and most devoutly
wish you had more money to supply their wants, and with a kind of
cheerfulness deliver some, and so perhaps they will let you pass without further
to do; but if they make an offer, seem to yield freely to it: then will they
fist you soundly, but do not hold your hand upon your money, but seem to be a
stranger unto fear, and that will vanish their suspicion of a greater sum;
for when I have took so much as pleased me well, I have by men's fear had
grounds to think that they had more, and so by laying my hand upon their arm
or thigh, or near where it lay hid, they would cry out, they were undone, when
I as yet found nothing more, but by their temeritie have been encouraged to
make a stricter search, and found considerable sums that secretly lay hid,
when if they had been discteer, they had been secure and safe from me.

CHAP. X. Being Robbed, how to follow them, which way to set Heu-and-ery, how
to coast, and where to find the Thievs.
IF you have lost your wealth, their is no help; but to endeavor to surprise
the thievs by strict pursuit: therefore be wary, and follow with all speed, I
you obtain your wish: and seiz the rogues that lately seized you. But be
careful, as it becomes you to follow undiscerned, lest they lay Ambuscadoe to
surprise your liberty, and it subdue to bonds; for if they see you in your
chase, the foremost he will slip into some by place, when you supose no ill, ride
on: but when you do draw nigh, they sally, and secure you in strong bonds,
where fast bound they leav you, and then he that comes next releases you; to
him you tell your adverssfates, and say they left the road, but whither they
went you know not how to tell, but admit me to your counsel, and I Will tell
you how to shun their escape; and by example the surest Shool-Master, I shall
direct you what to do in this: as suppose in Coal-brook-road you lost your
purse, the Thievs to Vxbridg-road or Stanes will surely ride and not fail to
take up their lodging, there for that night this is most certain, and the
soundest precept in their law, and truly for invention, the wittiest secret
that I er'e knew or heard, and stands with reason, therefore let reason guide
you to secure these Thievs if they have robbed you: for they know full well
none use to travel from road to road: no not the Hue-and-cries they never
cross the passages, but go straight along; so that by this close way they rest
at pleasure, and are gone again before the lazy Hue and Cry salutes them with
an alarm, nay, and with grief I speak it, some silly fellow newly crept into
office searches and enquires, and by Authority seizes poor Travelers, as far
from wrong as they from wit and knowledge, thinking by this false apprehension
to get credit, and be esteemed double-diligent, when they poor harmless souls,
now under hold, though free from guilt, do oft-times lose their lives for what
they never were once so much as privy to; therefore to regulate this error,
and that you may avoid the like, take my advice, and then I hope you will find and
secure the right offender: and so to do, with all possible speed scour the next
great Road, not straight before, but either on the right hand, or on the left;
and if you miss them, then conclude they are sheltered in some Inn which you
have past, and therefore observe my good advice, and you shall surely find and
apprehend them, as thus; If you have mist them, set some careful Spies with a
sufficient assistance near at hand, and be confident you will see them come that
way without the least apprehension of fear; and if (because I have betrayed the
secrets of their Trade) they leav this use, I am sure neither their wit, nor
the Devils assistance, can ever devise the like again; and I seriously protest,
I see no way for them to fly with fafetie, or the least hope to esape: But
this observe, that if they light of any considerable sum, then they rid that
night to their randezvouz in the City of London, which is too sure a shelter
for them; but with a real heart to fright them from that way, who I cannot
draw from it with advice, I will pursue them hither with the best instructions
for their apprehension; but observantly take notice, for here is as eminent an
example of their subtlety as any ever the Devil enriched their knowledge with;
for if you are robbed in the Eastern quarter, pursue them not in the direct
road to London with Hue and Cry, for by some other way they are fled;
therefore have to the City, and in Westminster, Holborn, the Strand, and
Commongarden search speedily, for there they are. If Northward they light on
you, then to Southwark, the Bank-side, or Lambeth they are gone, and so of the
West and South; and when you find them, seiz all you find, for they are all
Companions that are together.

Thus they always do contrive to take those places where they may most
seemingly be safe from dangers of pursuits, and in thus doing as I have showed
you, they think the City is between them and the Hue and Cry, and they
secure; and so before the search comes to them, as it seldom goes so far, they
have time enough to stay, and then be gone. Thus have I laid such a form of
Instructions for the Hue and Cry, as if observed, they cannot escape his hands.

CHAP XI. An extraordinary Charge the Country usually put themselves unto,
which is both needless and hurtful.
Custom, that Mother of absurdities, has not only Tolerated, but Naturalized
a practice, which though well intended, is not only unnecessary in a discreet
eye: but hurtful, as shall be made manifest; for where any robbery is
committed, the Hundred commonly puts a watch immediately to guard that place
where it is done. Which verifies the old Proverb used in dirision of the like
acts: To shut the stable-door when the Steed is lost: it is not to be imagined
that ever the Thief should come to make a needless breach to thank the Groom
for feeding of the beast so well, and rubbing, dressing, and looking to him with
honest care: for just so it must needs fare with them that should ignorantly
come to the same place where they seized their prize, knowing this custom to
be in use, but say they should com there, and at that time the watch is sat; I
really protest, I ever held that road that had a watch upon it, to be the
surest and best place for purchase. For first the honest Travellours supposes
it impossible for them to be robbed, being guarded thus, which makes him
careless to secure himself, because they fear not; whilst alas! the Thievs do
what they list, and freely pass, and the watch men never the wiser; for they
stand on that place commanded for their station, and move not from it, when
it is indifferent with the Thievs when he lays hold on what he looks for, his
booty, which where he singled it out, all places are alike to him, and so
another's as good as that: so that the coast be clear in sight; and when he
has done the deed, he may securely pass the watch, who cannot discern or know
him from another man, but lets him pass for honest. For I never past them, but
they gave me civil language: it is true, they bid me have a special care I was
not robbed, when in truth it was my trade to plunder others: but then suppose
they had examined me, I would have answered them with such respect and civil
language, and praise the work they stood to do, that they could not suspect me;
and I have known some of my fellow Cutters, that when examined, have carried
themselves with that discretion, that to encourage them to be careful in their
place, has thrown twelve-pence, or a half-crown piece but newly borrowed,
where they never mean to pay, that they have promised to drink his honest
health. Nay, suppose they should suspect me and my Company, alas! they are
poor silly old men, that are decrepid, weak, and altogether unable to make
resistance, and good for nothing but to loyter there; for I have seen a dozen
such stand all together with Halberds, Pikes, Pitchforks, and Clubs, amazed and
frighted, not daring to stir to rescue them that were distressed; whilst we
before their faces have bid men stand; assaulted, surprised, and rifled such as
we liked; when we had done it, and were upon the gallop, then they faintly
cry, Thievs, Thievs: Stop them, stop them; when none but Trees and Hedges that
heard their clamours: and I have known some that by way of parley have grown
familiar with them, and watched opportunity, and seized and bound them hand and
foot; then in a ditch have charged them on their lives to lay so quiet that
none may hear them: and then like a safe guard, set to preserve the Travellour
from wrong, with the watch-mens bills have stood with confidence till booty
come that way, and then made bold as with authority to stop and hold such as
they think have coin, and on pretense of search for what was lately lost upon
the way: if they find purchase worth the taking, seaz it and be gone: so that
a watch does hurt, not good. But if you needs will have it so, choos lusty able
men, resolved and yonug, arm them with bows and arrows, Muskets, or good
Carbines, or Fowling-pieces, and with a horse or two let them coast up and
down: this may do good, that they may not be so abused as I have shown, but if
occasion be, may follow on to purpose; and this is my advice proceeding from
experience.

CHAP. XII. Diverse Instructions for the Innkeeper, how to know Thieves from
his honest Guests.
THus have I traced them from their first entrance to their action, and from
their action to their flight, and I hope therein given so clear light to those
that desire their apprehension, that yet may occasion either their Conversion,
or Imprisonment, and that their Conviction; and having spoke sufficiently unto
the Travilor to be careful in his carriage in each particular: Give me leave
to add a word unto the honest Innkeeper, that so he may discern between the
honest Travilor and the Thief, which I shall perform in a word; which to do,
let him make it his chiefest care not to wink at such dishonesty for hope of
gain, least that sweet be imbittered by futer trouble and disgrace: therefore
let thy respects, who ever thou art that reads in this, be levelled at honesty
more then gain, knowing that a certain little with a godly peace of
contentment, is a greater gain, and a higher happiness, then an uncertain deal
with a terror of conscience. And to discover them is easy, if you observe my
Rules.

First, let the Ostler observe and he shall discern their extraordinary
curiosity about their Horses, they must be strangely dressed, and as strangely
fed, with mashes, bread, and mingled provender, and that in an unusual
quantity; and if he wonder at this, they cannot forbear but praise their
Tricks, and show how by their good abilities they do deserve it, and sometimes
they will boast their worthy services will soon repay the cost, or some dark
words to that effect, that are palpable grounds for to suspect them; and then
they will ask, whose Horse is that, and what is the owner, that stands there?
what function is their Master? what manner of men? whither they travel, how
far, and when? So by his answer they surmise which will be the richest purchase.

And, secondly, if you note their Clokebags, they are empty, only they carry
them to make a show.

And then thirdly, when the Chamberlain has ushured them to their Chamber, he
strait is sent away; but let him hearken, and if they are surely Thieves, it is
ten to one, but they fall to share what prize they have got that day, and let
him pry narrowly into their Chamber and he shall see them share as well as
hear the money, and every one shall take what is his lot; this they never
defer, if they have had any purchase, lest he that has the purse should cheat
the rest: this done, they hug each other, and then they knock in have,
complaining at his negligence that should attend, and call for Sack, and then
they want my Hosts company, whom with the highest strain of Complement they
salute and bid him welcome; but if my Host mark their discourse, he may
conjecture much, and know what men they are, as also by the saucy carriage of
their men; and if their several Names you do inquire, enjoin your servants to
do the like, and you shall soon perceive they have more Names then one a
piece; and when they are at supper let some one hastily knock at your gate, and
bid him that attends observe their carriage then, and he shall see them start,
as in a fearful maze, and stare each other in the face with ghastly looks, and
if you are in the Chamber, ask what Officers are those? who do they look for?
Or if forth from them, ask aloud that they may hear, what would Mr. Constable
have? who does he seek? or what is the Constable mad to knock so hastily, or
the like: and if they seem much frighted, bid them not fear, none shall come up
or offer him that wrong to search his house, so to disparage him, for he has no
guests but honest Gentlemen, and if they command him, he will use his authority
that none shall enter; there by this you may pry into their private thoughts
so far, that they will confess something, and reply, they shall be much engaged
for your succor, and then you may use your own discretion.

And you may see by their needless stay, their disregard of time, what they
expect, for they but bait to stand and gaze what purchase they can see go by,
and when they have spied a likely money booty pass by them, they pretend
immediate business calls them to be gone.

And when they come to take up Inn to lodge, they commonly come in divided,
and come in several companies, to frustrate the Hue and Cry as to their number:
besides if one part be surprised the other may escape; and when the residue
comes in, they seem as strangers, and of mine Host they will enquire what their
Companions are, and what Countrymen, whether he know them, and if they find he
has a jealousy or suspect either of them, they will presently will some
business to be gone with speed: but if for honest Travilers you take them, as
it is like you may, in your kitchen they do meet by seeming chance, they as
mear strangers one another salute, and drinking there together ere they part
they become familiarly acquainted and conclude to sup together, when if you
mark them well you shall find by their behavior that they are not strangers but
bosom friends, there they embrace, rejoice, and praise their plot, and laugh
at mine Host, that he suspect them not. The fairest Innes they usually
frequent, presuming that they will not so much disparage mine Host, as to make
search among his guests, which commonly are persons of account.

Thus have I laid open their devises and deceits, that so the honest Traveller
may escape their hand, and they fall into the hands of justice, thereby
endeavoring to repair the wrongs my Country has suffered, by endeavoring to
prevent others from living in the like sin, and so subvert sin that would raise
its own dominion by their fall and ruin; to which end that it may become
effectual, the Lord assist my endeavors to discover, and others by this
discovery to apprehend them, and that apprehension expose them to the Law of
justice, if they reject the Law of mercy.

Some very material Relations of certain passages, concerning those who are
less noble in their way of villainy then the Cutters on the road, known by the
Names of Housebreakers and Night-robbers, with many of their devices laid open,
by a friend to honesty, and an enemy to their deceit.
BEing by a serious consideration convinced how advatagious to a public good,
the discovery of every evil is, and finding that of Robberies to be of the
greatest magnitude, my own thoughts prompt me on readily to set a helping hand
to the writing out of so eminent an evil, as that practiced by such as make a
trade of sin, whose wages is death, if once subjected to Law and Justice, and
to the stopping of that Torrent whose streams produce a double prejudice;
Destruction to him that robs whose gain in the end is loss, and no small
damage to him that is robbed, who often times is thereby undone: Therefore I
shall endeavor to put a period to both, by in deavoring to discomfeit the
first, and instruct the other, so far forth as the best of my inquisitive
search can accomplish, either by report or History; and so to do, I shall
first present unto your perusal, what my ears presented unto my Intelects the
last Sessions in the Old Bailey, concerning a Robbery acted within the County of
Middlesex, which when providence led me thither one afternoon, I heard there
Examined before that Court of Judicary, which was thus.

The most subtle craft of a notable Thief, in Robbing a house in Shoreditch,
in October 1657.
ON the Wednsday before the said Robbery was done, came unto the house of an
ancient couple (whose many past careful years had competently provided for
their age) two or three stout lusty fellows to drink a cup of bear (for the
said aged people kept a kind of a vitling house) whose then in tentions without
question, were either to act, or to prepare for action of a Robbery there, as
the people did in part mistrust, but seeing no advantage answerable to their
desires for that time they departed; and on the Friday next following, they
came again, diligently noting all particulars, and viewed with so strict an
observation the strength of the house, and asked some such doubtful questions,
that the peoples jealousies became downright fears, or rather assurances, that
they intended evil, but their just fears made them so observantly to heed
their carriages, that no opportunity could crown them with their wished for
advantages, who seeing it impossible to effect any thing at that time, they
departed also; but here observe the subtilty of those villains, as they went
forth either to make water, or as they departed, they took an occasion to mark
on the outside of the doorpost whether the bolts and locks wear within, that so
thereby they might exactly know where the greatest strengrh of the door lay,
that thereby with the more privitie and less difficulty they might force it
open; and so on the Sunday following, about midnight, they came and effected
their wicked purpose, forced the doors, came to their bedside, swore to have
either their blood or their money, and so took about a hundred pounds in money,
plate, and Jewels, and went their way; having first sworn the aged people not
to pursue them at that time.

By this may people learn to be cautious of such as they suspect, and to be
careful to fortify their habitations with competent strength; and if they are
lone people, like those, not to keep such sums or goods of value in their house.

Some of the Laws and Customs of the City Thieves, laid open to the ingenious
Readers, who may thereby be enabled to avoid their vilany.
ANd for those that are of this function, they are Governed by Laws and Orders,
as an historian of that fraternity relates. First, they have a Captain or
Superior, whom all Thieves observantly obey, and he is the cunningest and
oldest of that Trade; who appoints each man his station and Robbery, reserving
the wisest for the most desperate and most dangerous thefts, which their Law
makes them submit unto, not passing his limits, nor undertaking greater matters
then he is capable of: every novice is first tried before he is employed, and
then according to his inclination and ability, he is put in office of a
stafadours, grumet, hobgobling, or mullets, that are such as are conveyed into
men's houses in packs or hogsheads, or the like; and these Laws are always
observed amongst them, they never fall out one with another unless feignedly
to avoid suspicion: they must not go two twice together into one Tavern or
Alehouse above once in ten days, neither must they go two of them together
through the City, or to speak familiarly together when they meet: and every one
is to carry his private badge, whereby the Society may know what he is when
they meet him; the Robbers bear always a glove hanging and made fast by one
finger, the Cheats button their dublets by intercession one buttoned and the
next unbuttoned, the Stafadours always stroke their mustaches every three or
four steps, the Cutpurses have a little white mark in their hatbands, etc. They
have their certain meeting places on every Satturday night, to give an account
of each exployt, the manner and the purchase of it, and that they devide
amongst themselves according to their several shares: and the meeting place of
late has certainly bin at the house of the common Hangman of the City of
London, near or in Goldenlane, for there on a Satturday was apprehended
several, some known and others propably suspected to be Thieves, where they
were on notice given apprehended, and with the Executioner committed unto safe
custody, who on examination the last Sessions was either favored and so under
Bail set at liberty, or else pardoned and so acquitted for that Fact, to see
if he will mend. Thus have I endeavored to set before the eyes of the world
their deceits, that so they may with the more ease be either avoided or
apprehended, and so surrendered unto the hands of Justice: I heartily wish, that
whosoever reads may profit by it one way or other, to the edification of honesty.

FINIS.
