Church of ENGLAND, observing present differences between the Parliament and
Army.

KINGDOM. From a Scholar in Cambridge to his friend in London.

THE MISTAKE OF THE TIMES, WHEREIN Is observed the present difference between
the PARLIAMENT and ARMY.
IT has ever been held an unfit course to Intermeddle with other men's actions,
especially when one has nothing to do with the matters in question, yet here
methinks every good subject as well as every great subject, may challinge an
interest; I have therefore (though in the midst of my own private distr^ctions)
lent thy observations to those public distances between Parliament and Army.
Indeed I have often heard it that a King is the husband, and the Commonwealth
is the wife, now whom God has joined together let no man nor malice seek to
separate; ye^ if any differences arise, I shall pray they may compose them
themselves, or else they throw themselves upon the c^^^u^e of others, but
sometimes they may be liable to such distempers, that they may need a
Physician, and Parliaments have been held the fittest and best Physicians to
cure disquiets in either; For as household jarrs may rend and ruin a family, the
husband pulling one way, and the wife another, to their own infinite disquiets;
So when theose differences are composed, it does knit the bond of affection the
firmer, that many times they may cry out, we are happier by our failings and
falling out; But if any go about to make the breach wider now horrid a task
they undertake, they and they only can tell, who have been liable to such
mischances, for when bad persuasions meet with such untoward humors as are apt
to entertain ill conceits of one another, how easy a thing it is to make that
irr(...), which by (...) and seasonable advice is soon composed, even so in a
distempered Kingdom, where either the Prince plays the wanton with his
prerogatives, and gives others power to abuse his Subjects, thinking his people
bound to suffer any thing he lays upon them, or where a distempered Nation
^egin^ to think evil of their Princes, ^^pi^^ing to see any in grea^er power
then themselves, how easy is it for any siding with either, to make the
sparks of devision grow to such a flame as may set the whole Kingdom in
combustion. And how easy is it on the other side to procure a fair composure,
if any will modestly and mannerly show their Prince how he is abused by his
instruments, and what a derrogation it is to his Princly dignity to employ bad
agents, because the worst of the evil ^^flects upon himself, Therefore
entreat him in time to prevent such growing evils by taking advice by a
Parliament, and no the other side to persuade the people to have a reverent
esteem of their Prince, as of one God has set over them and that as soon as
the world became populous, there was a necessity of diff^rence and distinction
of persons, and that supreme powers are ordained by God, and those that resist
them resist the Ordinance of God. And so having brought both to see their
sickness, to persuade both to make their refuge to the Physician; but now if
this Physician shall proceed so cunningly with both, as to refuse to undertake
the cure, unless all the power they both have be conferred on him, presuming
the Prince will endure no such corasives if there be occasion to use them, nor
the people being of an untamed humor) will not be kept in fitting bounds, if I
say the Parliament be so cau^ious (as out of these considerations), not to
undertake the cure unless it be invested with this power the danger will be,
and is but to apparent, the cure man be worse then the disease.

For could it have been imagined that the King for his volun^ary desire to
satisfy his subjects in granting the continuance of this Parliament, that they
should not only make it perpetual, but deprive the King of all subjection to
him, nay of all livelihood, and did the Commonwealth immagine, that out of a
desire to be freed from all Monopolies, and all illegal demands, as Shipmony,
and the rest, they should have been thus ensnared, as to pay greater Taxes, new
Excises, such Contributions, as do not only far exceed all former demands,
but are still so increasing, that they not only groan under the burden of
them, but grow not able to discharge them, and yet they are made believe this
is for the liberty of the Subject, I have heard that none can manage an estate
so well, as those that are breed in the familiar use of it, which is the
reason, that the Sons of those men that suddenly grow rich, are for the most
part prodigalls; so I wonder not that this Parliament having such an expected
power put in their hands, prove and play the Prodigal with it, what vast sums
have been raised, and how disposed, not the wisest amongst them (I verily
believe) can tell, why Armies have been listed, hummunition provided, so many
Innocents killed, can any of them give a reason? for what good has all our
fighting produced, but breed an inviterate hate against one another, nay after
all our glorious (as they call them) victories, are we any whit the nearer
happiness? nay (I fear) we are rather falling into greater distractions; for
does not the Army prescribe rules to the Parliament, nay to the King himself,
by fetching him violently from Holmby, and still disposing of him as they not
he pleases, so as I fear they guard him for danger, not from danger, and do
they not impeach the Members of the House of Commons, and require a perfect
time for determination of this Parliament, and diverse other things, and do not
the Quer^es object against the Army, nay may not the Parliament justly wonder
that an Army should at one and the same time require pay from them, and
infringe their privileges, is not this strange bandying at one another, and
offing one another from hazard to hazard, even to the hazard of one another
ruin, for are we not next door to be again imbroyled in a new war, and so
to be made (and what is worse to make our selves) the scorn of all our
Neighbor Nations, but was it not so with the Children of Izrael when they had
no King? did not every man what seemed good in his own eyes and I pray
consider what strange thing have been acted both in Church and Common wealth
in this Kingdom of la^e, may it not truly be said? Thy holy Temples they have
defiled, and made Jerusalem an he^p^ of stones, so as it is a wonder to me that
the stones do not cry out, and now must we expect our happiness from further
divisions, certainly no, I wish therefore we would prevent so near an
approaching evil before it come upon us; for let us once more be engaged in
justifying our several conceits by the sword, it will then be too late to wish
a reconcilement.

O that both Parliament and Army would therefore (before it be too late,) throw
themselves at the Kings feet, and humbly acknowledge thing are done
improperly on both sides, for as it is man's weakness to err, so it is man's
wickedness to persist in error; for I am persuaded if we would yet at last
put all our mistries into the Kings hands, it will prove the likelyest way to
cure our overspreading maladies before they grow to such an height, as they
will be impossible to be cured, and that we would desire him to settle things
as seems best in his eyes; for certainly, as God has endowed him with
knowledge above his fellows, or else he could never have borne those high and
strange affronts as have been put upon him with so admirable a patience, so I
am confident, affliction has been prepared him to manage the Scepters of his
three Kingdoms, with more safety to his Subjects, and honor to himself, then
he has done before; for new he sees plainly, freeborne subjects will not
endure indirect demands, and therefore there is no doubt his own pious heart
desires so to manage those things are committed to his charge, as to prepare
and secure his way to Heaven, and future happiness; for here we have no
abaling City.

O Lord (for thy mercies sake) open the eyes of this si^full Nation, that not
trusting to their own (...), nor ^^^^ing to their own conceit, they may
reinvest His Majesty in his just rights, and learn and resolve to submit to
his Commands, and then upon the dissolution of this Parliament* it is not to be
doubted but His Majesty will call another, and so settle the Peace of this (now
totterring) Kingdom, but if still we keep him at distance, and continue our
thwarting and crossing one another, we may undoubtedly (and that very shortly)
say, we might have been happy but would not; therefore woe, woe, woe, is but
too likely to be our portion, let us O let us, therefore devote with all
reverence a day of general humiliation for our crying sins, so may our
general desolations be Prevented, nay let us (for (...) we had needs) (...)
mi^^^ily to the Lord) to ^^ver^ his ^udgements (...), King, meet with condign
punishment, we were of all Nations most miserable, but there is mercy with him
that he should be feared, if therefore we can truly humble our selves, and
implore his mercies in an humble, lowly, pennitent, and obedient manner, there
is yet hope, we may not quite perish; for as man cannot commit greater sins
then God can forgive, yet if we persist in these crying impieties, it is to be
feared, we may commit those sins God will not forgive, but that other Nations
and our future Generation, may have cause to bemoane our just desolations, and
that our gardens be given to those will make a better use of them then we have
done; for if famine, murder, rape, (which are the bitter Attendants of war)
be the effects of our reformed religion, how will the mother be detested that
brings forth such loath some issue; let us therefore take heed we not only
wound, but altogether destroy our religion we seem with so much zeal to
establish, I wish therefore we would take warning by the parable of him that
planted a Vineyard, and let it out unto husbandmen, and when he expected
fruit, and sent a servant to them, they beat him, and sent him away empty, and
ceased not there, but used two others in the like or worse manner, nay they
killed the Son himself, but what the Lord of the Vineyard did I tremble to
think on, least the like punishment for the like impieties befall us.

FINIS.
