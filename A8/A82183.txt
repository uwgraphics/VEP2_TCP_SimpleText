A Declaration of the Loyalty of the Citizens of London to the KING and
Parliament.
MAny expressions of loyalty to a Prince from his subjects may be showed,
acceptable, but not profitable to the public good, some aiming at their own
particular preferment, and some to win his Prince his favor, this fidellity is
in these unfortunate times too frequent, this is loyalty without considerable
premeditation, hurtful and pernicious, this is exercised by temporary
observances, the very Papists Enemies to the cause of Christ, may be indewed
with this kind of loyalty, but there is a loyalty which is unparallelled,
which the best and wisest men, which are not indewed with worldly, but
spiritual wisdom, have rooted and fast fixed in their hearts, this loyalty is
Duplex nay triplex, and unremoveable, as Solomon, a threefold Cord is not
easily broken, this has its aspect fixed upon a triple object, upon their
Prince, upon religion and upon law, upon their Prince as the head of that body
of which they are members, and this loyalty is expressed in the endeavor to
preserve both from Indemnity and dislocation or Fraction, for if either, both
must needs languish and in the end perish by a Consumption, the second is upon
religion, this should be the primum mobile, the chief mover and loadstone to
draw the sincerest and heartiest affection thereto, if this loyalty be wanting
which is called fidelity to God, in vain can a Prince expect hearty affection
from his people, if piety be not the ground of all their actions, all will come
to naught and prove frustrate whether it be by Counsel, or external actionate
apparances: But here is not to be understood every man's religion regulated by
particular fancy, for there is but one true religion grounded upon Devine
Doctrine recorded in the sacred and Canonical writings of the Old and new
Testament; loyalty in religion must be constant and settled, not mutable: retain
the truth and keep it, let not times alteration change our Religion, let not
temporary division divide the heart from his God and his verity. The third
object is love, and this is Duplex, Divine and humane, upon the law of God, and
Ordinance of man, the first is Devine obedience and loyalty, the other is
politic fidelity, of the last I will most speak, because it is now the
secondary cause of dissension, this is also twofold, grounded upon common and
fundamental laws of this kingdom, and upon Parliamentary government both
known and of long continuance, the first unalterable, the last mutable
according to the mutability of times, both the only preservatives
conjunctively, of kingdoms prosperity and tranquillity. If either fall or be
destroyed, the total frame of pollitick government must needs perish, for in
this Consists the well being of the whole nation, no surer ground of peace and
happiness, then the preservation of this ancient established government, the
neglect of which breeds such ulcers and deep wounds in the body, that the cure
must be so sharp and bitter that the remedy seems to many worse then the
disease, being tedious and wearisome: It happens just so in these times; the
oppressions of the subjects of this kingdom by tyranicall courts arc now
almost buried in oblivion, through the dilatory preventions of Malignant
spirits, actors in the precedent tragedy of state oppression, whose power has
been and is so prevalent that they want not regal protection to defend their
actions. Now then is the time to show true loyalty to God, king and country:
now is the time to lay open the distinction of true and false obedience, now is
the time if ever to show who are true Patriots of the country, and who are
perfidious betayers of the same to the will malice and tyrany of particular
persons, Court favorites, and public enemies to peace and piety.

Having now to my weak abillity made distinction between true loyalty and
false, I will proceed to parallel the Actions of the worthy Citizens of the
City of London, to particulars before recited whereby it may be made manifest
to the whole world, that their loyalty has been singular and indefatigable, no
trouble raised against them either in their persons or estates, has changed
their true loyalty no, thunderbolt of Proclamations or Declarations against
them can alter that fast grounded fidelity seated in their hearts, although in
this kind they have had many discouragments if the same might have wrought
upon there affections well versed in sacred writ, he that forsakes father
mother kindred friends, lands, houses, goods, even all for the cause of God,
shall receive an hundred fold in the day of their Accounts.

The many contributions and dibursments that have been parted from by them,
like continual streams flowing with constancy, without intermission might
have been ground sufficient to have declined their fidelity, and the little
benefit they have as yet received by the same, might have drowned their hopes
of future happiness, if they had not been truly loyal to the King and
parliament.

But they are well read in Physical documents, concerning the health of
material bodies similized to pollitick, contracted and composed of a
Commonwealth, that a long sickness must have long cure and a dangerous sore
have a desperate medicine, and that if the same be applied and withdrawn
before its operation, it may prove more dangerous and deadly then the malady:
Therefore the having well considered and pondered the premises, count it no
loss either of time or expense to wait Gods leisure for the redress and
curation of their evil, and lay no negligence or carelessness therein, upon
the Parliament whose daily labors, dangers and vast distributions exceed any
Parliament that ever sat in England before, for the defense and maintenance
of the public good.

No record of former ages can manifest the like loyalty. But to the shame of
those times, the subject has happened to forsake their Parliament in Ric. 2.
and exposed both them, and themselves to the government of particular Parasites,
and Herodian foxes, which proved destroyers of their country and Prince too at
last: for it is received Maxim in State policy, he that is a traitor to
himself can never be loyal to his king, and he that is a Traitout to his
Country, is a traitor to himself, being a member and part of his Country.

I now come to the loyalty of the Citizens of London, in their personal
actions as well as in their purse-contributions, and in this respect the City
may be called the Chamber or Storehouse of true loyalty, a glass wherein the
whole Kingdom may see not only the stamp or character of loyalty, but the
substance it self. What City in England can compare with it, I mean not in
respect of its largitude, but in respect of its alacrity and cheerful
performances of public personal Offices tending to the common safety, the
willing mind is discerned as well in little as much, and the affection as really
expressed; their industry so great, and operative actions so tractable, that it
is meet to be recorded in tables of brass, to be had in perpetual memory, a
pattern of constancy to be imitated by all nations in the world. I am not able
to express the worthiness of their actions, conducing not not only to their
own safeties and preservations, but to the benefit and profit of these whole
Kingdom.

Their extraordinary guards, by the heroic Companies of trained soldiers,
daily exercised for the security both of Parliament and City is another
demonstration of their true loyalty, maintained at their own charge, without
being burdensome to the rest of the Kingdom, the activity of their spirits,
complete habiliaments, may well render her to be the Lady and Queen of Cities,
and glory to other nations, not equalized by the most famous cities of Europe,
none or very few serving in this cause but the chiefest and best of the
Citizens both for personage and estate, and so experienced in their martial
discipline and exercises, that the meanest may be an Officer for his skill, in
a Regal Army, the pattern of magnanity and true valor, and what can more
strengthen a King, and preserve the peace of his Kingdom, then true loyalty
joined with valor and courage in his people.

No antiquity can record the like fortifications, bulwarks and trenches to have
been about this city, as now are raised and made, for the strengthening and
security thereof, who can testify that former ages have produced such examples
of loyalty; that even from the greatest to the least of the said City, from the
highest to the meanest, have put their hand to the work, who can report of
times past, that ever so many thousand did daily work in their own persons, as
now is seen, freely and with the work of their own hands, secure themselves by
such outworks? who living can report that every day in the week in a warlike
manner with their Commanders Colors, Drums and weapons of war in one hand, and
instruments of labor in the orher, so many thousands should march to the work,
as to a field of fight, imitating the Israelites in the days of good Nehemiah,
working with one hand, and upon the sound of the Drum, Arma parata, to fight
with the other, and all this out of true loyalty to their King and Country,
for the defense of the person and royal posterity of their Sovereign, of the
true religion grounded on the Word of God, of the Fundamental and
Parliamentary Laws, and the Rights, Privileges and Immunities of the
freeborn subjects of the English Nation. This is the triple object upon which
the true loyalty of the Citizens of London has been hitherto, and yet is fast
fixed and grounded: yet one mark more of their true fidelity (I had almost
forgotten) worthy to be retained in perpetual memory to succeeding ages, and
that is, their searching out and rejection of the disloyal hearted amongst
them, and willingly exposing them to exemplary punishment for the same. There
is no garden, be it never so decked with rare flowers and variety, but has in
it some weeds that must be plucked out and cast away, for the better growing of
the serviceable and delectable flowers: no city that is free from evil
members, that must be taken notice of, and either cropped or rooted out, least
they overgrow the good, and hinder their flourishing and increase. And thus I
end, wishing the whole Kingdom in general may imitate this renowned City in
its true loyalty and fidelity to God, their King and Country.

FINIS.
