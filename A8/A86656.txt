A WORD From the NORTH, Sounded into the SOUTH, Heard, and received of Many.

Jesus Christ the Son of God, which is the true light which lights every man
that comes into the world; and all that receive this light, and believe in
this light, and are obedient to this light, they receive power and do become
the sons of God.

And as I have heard, so I have and do see in the true light, and am bold to
give forth my testimony that it is true, and there is no other way to
salvation but by it.

And therefore do I warn all the people, and thee, O Kent, with the city of
Canterbury, and town of Maidstone, and all thy Magistrates in you all, betimes
to consider and take heed that none of you be any longer enemies to it and its
Ministers, lest you be found fighters against God.

Thomas Howse^o^.

of Paul's, 1657.

A Warning unto all people that live wantonly upon the Earth.
WOE, woe, says the Lord to the Inhabitants of the Earth, that live wantonly and
proudly upon the earth, which oppresses the innocent, and murders the just;
that say, Who is the Lord? and to the Almighty, Depart, we desire not the
knowledge of thy ways; we will not have this man Christ, the light which
enlightneth every man that comes into the world, to reign over us, to rule in
us, to be the only true Teacher unto us, by him to be governed and convinced of
all sin, and to be reproved for all our evil deeds of darkness; for if him we
receive, then all our gain of unrighteousness will be lost; all our pomp and
glories of this world must be denied; all our evil vain thoughts; all our
formal Profession without the life, out of the possession, by this light will be
condemned; and all our forms without the power, by it, and by the children of
it are denied; and if this be received, all sin and iniquity must be denied
while we are here in this life.

And we have been taught by our Teachers and Priests, That while we are here we
cannot be freed from sin; and that none can be without sin while they are in
this life; and that freedom from our sins should be in another world; and them
we have believed, and this for truth we have received. And for the light of
Christ that shows sin and leads out of sin, which was in the beginning; we
confess Scriptures speaks of such a thing, and there is something in our
consciences tells us it is truth; we should not serve sin and the Devil here in
this life; and we are condemned often by it when we do evil, though no eye of
man sees us; and this is the Witness of God in our consciences, and the Witness
is true, but it is a cross to our Wills and Lusts. And our Priests and learned
men they must needs know, and they have taught us otherwise, That we cannot be
free here; and we see they are as we, and do the same things that we do, and we
hope we shall do as well as they. And further, we see that the Rulers and great
ones but very few of them receive this Testimony, nor own this Light of Christ
to be ruled by it; and if we receive it, and be ordered by it, then we must
deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, all our pride and oppression, all our
vain words, and light idle communication, jesting and foolish talking, lying,
and double-dealing. etc.

And this is a great cross to our own wills, and we shall be a cross to the
will of man, and the powers of the Earth, and the Priests of the Nation will
frown upon us. Yea, further, it tells us, we may not think our own thoughts,
nor speak our own words; but a watch must be kept over all. And that tells us,
if we commit sin we are of the Devil; and that him to whom we yield obedience,
his servants we are; and that the Tree is known by its fruit; and that no
unclean thing can enter into the kindom of God: and that if we be Christ's, we
must be new creatures; and that his blood cleanses from all sin, we
acknowledge this to be truth: But we have received another testimony of men,
and most professors and people are of this judgment, that is, We cannot be
free from sin here.

And with the Enemy to their eternal peace here many join, and deny the pure
Light of Christ within them, and refuses its teachings and leadings out of all
ungodliness and wordly lusts, to a holy and godly life and conversation in this
present evil world, and to have no fellowship with the unfruitful works and
workers of darkness, but to reprove them plainly: Here the vain world and
carnal professors joins together, and both conclude that this they cannot be
nor do, and so exclude themselves from its leadings, which would make them to
be found meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.

These say to the Almighty, Depart, depart, we desire not the knowledge of thy
Law; these deny the grace of God which brings salvation; these deny the
living way to the Father; these deny the power of God; these resist the Light
in which the power is placed, and he that resists this Power, resists the
Ordinance of God: these deny the Lord that bought them, and such shall bring
damnation upon themselves; for this is witnessed and testified, that there is
no other way to salvation then that which was from the beginning, Christ the
true Light, which enlightneth every one that comes into the world, and was
given for a light of the Gentiles, the salvation of God unto the ends of the
world, Isa. 4.9.6. Acts 13.47. (Mark) He was given for a light, he was, he is
the true light; he was given for a Covenant, Isa. 42.6. All that have not him
to be the true Light, have not the Covenant, are out of the Covenant, denies
the door of entrance to the Father; for none can come to the Father but by him.

And so all people be warned what you do; for where this cursed ground is
standing, and darkness over the face of the earth, and the light denied, there
the cursed fruit is brought forth as hatred, pride, envy; wrath, emulation,
strife, seditions, hypocrisy, heresies, etc. and all fruits of the flesh have
a habitation in that kingdom where Pharaoh rules, which oppresses the Israel of
God; there Judas dwells that betrays the just; there is that envious
generation harbored that cries, Deliver to us the murdererer, and crucify the
light, the Son of God.

Therefore all people, I warn you all betimes, consider what you do that deny
the light of Christ, and ^y it to be ordered, and calls it natural; it matters
not what you profess or talk of in words; all your Religion and Profession is
but vain, your vain words will not save you, no more then it did the generation
which you may read of, who said to Christ, we have eat and drunk in thy
presence, and preached of thee in the Streets, and in thy Name done great
things, which went far; yet said Christ to them, Depart ye workers of Iniquity,
I never knew you, Matt. 7.22.23.

And here you are all that hate the light, and denies the teaching of it, and
hates the Messengers and Messengers of it, who are sent to you of the Lord to
bear vvitness of the true Light which enlightneth every man that comes into
the world, to them many of you say, Depart out of our Coasts, our Cities, and
Towns, we desire not the knowledge of this way; and some of them you stock,
whip, and imprison, by the which you are made manifest of what generation you
are: And this I declare from the Lord unto you all whatever you be, high or
low, rich or poor, who are Enemies in your minds to the light of Christ, and
the vvitnesses of it, and refuse by it to be ordered in all your whole lives
and conversations, to the glory of our God: There vvil a day come upon you in
the which he shall say, Depart, depart from me and mine, ye workers of
Iniquity, I know you not; and then a sad lamentation of hovvling and
bitterness will be upon you, and vvo and misery shall be your portion for ever.

Therefore now while you have time, prize it; now is the day of your
visitation, and many large declarations has been of late sent forth amongst
you in this Nation, by which you shall be left without excuse, for his sound is
gone forth throughout the earth, have ye not all heard? and have not many been
convinced by the Light, and that your Teacher is nigh you, and the vvitness for
God is within you, and by it you have been often judged and condemned for your
evil deeds and hard speeches, done and spoken maliciously against the innocent
servants of the Lord: But how few among you have received and believed the
vvitnesses for God, and have felt the strong Arm of the Lord in power to pluck
you as brands out of the Fire.

Are ye not yet for the greatest part both Priests, Professors, and people,
under all your names and titles whatever called, opposing and resisting the
spirit of the living God when it moves in you, and strives with you, or speaks
in any sent of the Lord unto you, for the eternal good of your poor souls,
which is of more vvorth then all the world, even as your fathers have done so
do ye, and therein have declared your selves enemies to God and his Ministers,
and judged your selves unworthy of eternal life.

Oh Nation! oh people! repent, repent betimes, and break off from the evil of
all your vvayes and doings, that have been acted against the Lord, his vvitness
within you, and his servants sent amongst you, and if you will return, return
indeed to the Lord, and forsake all thy abominations by which the seed of God
has long been oppressed, and groans and cries for deliverance from under
Pharoahs cruel bondage, the cries of the which seed the Lord has heard, and
has brought forth at this day in thousands of his tender Lambs, who are
redeemed from off the earth, to praise and glorify his holy Name for evermore,
who stand living Witnesses for the living God of power this day, in this and
many other Nations, who have not loved their lives, but given them to death for
the testimony of Jesus, who has purchased them to be to himself a peculiar
people, out of Kindreds, Tongues and Nations.

And many more has our God, with his eternal Love, looked upon, and his living
pure light shined into, who stand single in their souls, and in the light of
Christ do wait for the pure living manifestation of the whole counsel and
revelation of the will of God in every thing what he vvil have them to do and
suffer for his Names sake, who through Grace received, do witness, and in the
light of Christ do see, and testify against the world its wickedness, its
vvayes, words, worships, works, customs, fashions, and ungodly
conversations, and abominable uncleanness thereof, and dare not have any
fellowship with the unfruitful works or workers of darkness, but as moved of
the Lord are made to reprove them plainly: Praises, praises be to our God for
evermore.

And now all people in love to your souls, which is more vvorth then all the
world, do I speak, and do you warn and beseech, to come off and forsake all
your false Teachers and Hirelings, who walk not in nor by the Light of Christ,
but are in Cains way, and Korahs way, and Balaams way, who deny to be ordered
and guided by the Light of Christ in their own particular, and are Enemies to
those that walk in it, that vvil not receive it themselves, nor enter the
Kingdom of Heaven themselves, nor suffer others to enter.

I say once more, Come off, come away from off all those hard Mountains of
leanness, where no pure Waters are, and come down to the true teacher, Christ
the Light, which is nigh you all, in you all, which if you hear and obey, vvil
lead you into the good Land, the fruitful Land, where fresh Springs are always
open, where no want or barrenness is; it is to him I exhort you all to come,
which will tell you truly all that ever you have done, that ever you have been,
and let you see your secret sins, and convince you of them, and bring you to
condemnation for them, and purify and cleanse you from them; and to all you
that abide in him, and look for him, he shall appear the second time without
sin, unto salvation: But for all you who will not own him here before men, he
shall you deny before his Father, which is in Heaven: And so while you have
time prise it, before that hour come upon you, in which time shall be no more,
and then repentance shall be hid from your eyes, and the day of your visitation
be over-past: Now is your day, prise it, and receive the counsel of your
friend, called

T. H.

Oh County! Oh People! hear counsel in time.
O Kent! Kent! hear the Word of the Lord unto thee: Thou art full, thou art
full; thou art increased in Goods; thou art waxed wanton before me, says the
Lord: thou have kicked with the heel; thou have given me the back, but the face
thou have turned away: thy iniquities are many; the sins of Sod^m are found in
thee, pride, idleness, and fullness of bread; but the cry of the needy in thee
is not heard; thou have broken the Covenants and solemn Promises made unto me
in the day of thy calamity and sore troubles, when the Sword was within thy
borders, and Wars within thy Gates. Thou wast less indeed in the fire, in the
furnace, then many other Shires and Counties; not so much blood was shed in
thee; not so much plunder and burnings done in thee; but thou have forgotten
the hand by which thou wast smitten, and have not minded him whose Arm was
stretched over thee to save, even me says the Lord thou have forgotten and
forsaken, who delivered thee for my own Names sake, who has now given thee
peace, and sent thee plenty in thy dwellings; and thou have taken my Corn and
my Cattle in excess to gluttony; my Wine and my Drink to drunkenness; my Wool
and my Flax to satisfy thy lusts, thy pride and lasciviousness, worse then the
Heathen; and herein thou have exceeded many other Counties and Shires, even as
thou have exceeded them in my mercies: And these are thy Fruits, with many
other abominations committed in thee O Kent, and yet thou drawest near to me
with thy lips, as a people use to do, and thou have gotten many in thee that
make a profession, and talk of me in words, says the Lord, and they have
gotten them several forms and likeness of me, and my worship, and my truth,
even as they imagine in their carnal minds and fallen wisdom; and so they cry,
Lo here, lo there is Christ: Babel, confused in their Languages, rejecting the
Cornerstone, and builds not upon the Rock of Ages, against which the powers of
hell and death shall not prevail: My people perish for want of knowledge, says
the Lord; they feed on Wind, they eat on that which dies of it self; they know
not the day of my power, and feel not my power; but says the Lord, O
professors, where is the power? for my Kingdom stands not in words, for then
you might all have it; it is easy to get words, you have all words, but it
stands in power; and now says the Lord, I will see the power of you all, for
mine is the Kingdom and the Power, and my people are a willing people in the
day of my power, and they are led by my fpirit and power; and my Worship is in
the spirit and in the truth; my truth is but one in all, my spirit, my light,
my truth leads into oneness singleness, pureness, one heart, one soul, one
faith, one Lord, one baptism; my Spirit, my Truth, my Son makes free indeed
sits a top of all the world, over the world, all its pollutions, all its
glories, profits, pleasures, vanities; my spirit helps infirmities, and leads
into all truth, into nothing but truth; reproves the world of sin, of
righteousness, and of judgment; the life of my spirit consists not in words,
in visible carnal perishing things, its not meat, nor drink, but righteousness,
and peace, and joy within, that is it which helps with sighs and groans that
cannot be uttered.

And now all professors and people, with the light of Christ, the Candle of the
Lord, let all your hearts be searched, and the secret thoughts and imaginations
be brought to light; for that will, and shall make you all manifest what you
are, and where your power is, and with what you worship me, says the Lord; for
now all vails and coverings shall be pulled off from all your faces, and woe to
those that are covered with a covering, but not with my spirit says the Lord
And woe to all you professors and people that say you know me, and worship me,
and yet by your works deny me, says the Lord, striving who shall be greatest
among you, and in your hearts and habits out of my fear, and in the vanities,
lusts, profits, pleasures, honors, places, and worldly preferments, seeking to
establish your selves and posterity in the midst of the earth, and build and
make great your own houses, but the house of God lies wast, not minding the
poor and needy within you, nor those honest simple hearted ones who were ever
found faithful to that cause and trust committed unto them with you, who
freely left all, ventured all, Estates, Wives, Children, yea, and their own
lives in the high places of the field, for no other end, but that they might
enjoy free, true, pure liberty to worship me, says the Lord, in purity, as I
have promised to reveal and make known unto them by my spirit of truth, without
traditions or inventions of carnal man, and for the preserving and restoring
that just and good Laws of God written in his, To do unto others as they would
be done unto, upon which all the Laws of man should be grounded, and not the
wills of men established for a Law.

But they see and feel by sad experience otherwise; for now many of them are
thrown into Holes and Prisons in many places in this Nation, and some in this
County, because they cannot submit unto the wills, and traditions, and
inventions of fallen man; and now all manner of profaneness, as Drunkards,
Swearers, Riotous, etc. find more favor of many, or most of the powers of this
Nation, then my poor innocent harmless Saints (says the Lord) who fear me, and
tremble at my word, and many of them beaten, reproached, and shamefully abused
by this filthy, ungodly, profane generation, and some Magistrates so called,
have justified their beastly actions, by their beholding of them who did it
without reproof; yea, and in thee O Kent some violence (prisonning and
whipping) has been acted against them for their true and faithful obedience
unto me in what I commanded them; and still the actions of violence and
oppression are done upon some of them, who cannot in their consciences submit
to the will of unjust and unreasonable men who fear not me.

And you oh professors in the County, who are entrusted with Power and
Authority, have you not seen and known these things, and yet kept silence; to
my Witness within you do I speak, which will not lie; you have not remembered
the afflictions of my innocent Joseph's; and now says the Lord, I will arise
and plead their cause my self, in truth, in righteousness, and in judgment,
and I will support them with my strength to suffer and bear patiently, and
will clear up their innnocency, and they shall give me the glory; but shame
and confusion shall hasten upon the top of mine and their Enemies for ever.

And as in this whole Nation, so these iniquities are found in thee O Kent,
which is none of thy least abominations in my sight, says the Lord; The Heads
in thee judge for rewards, and the Priests in thee teach for hire, and thy
Prophets prophecy for money, and yet thou vvilt lean upon me, says the Lord;
and thou have given me many words and promises of reforming these things,
says the Lord; but thou art deceitful; and thou have engaged and vowed in my
presence against them, and all other Popish Innovations, but thou have not kept
them, and as yet I have nothing but thy back, I have not thy face; and yet thou
talkest of me, and say, Is not the Lord amongst us? though all these
abominations are found in thee: But for these things, as with the Nations, so
will I plead with thee oh Kent, and except thou repent and turn unto me says
the Lord, and forsake these thy abominable things in my sight, ye professors,
Priests, and people, I will come upon thee on a day before thou art aware, and
will reward thee double for all thy iniquities, says the Lord; and as thou
have drunk deep of the Cup of thy Fornication, so thou shall drink deep of the
Cup of my Indignation; and if these things thou departest not from, and turn
unto me with all thy heart, oh people unworthy to be beloved; if thou wast as
Zion, for these things thou should be plowed as a field; and as Jerusalem,
thou shall be laid on heaps; and though the Mountains of thy House be as the
High Places, yet thou shall be laid as a Forest before me says the Lord.

But if thou will repent and turn unto me says the Lord, unfeignedly with all
thy heart, and hear and obey the voice of my servants and Ministers which I
have sent unto thee, and now of late raised up in thee gifted with my own
spirit, in the light of my own Son, who is the true light which enlightneth ery
man that comes into the world; and turn away from all thy false Hirelings and
Teachers, which run and I never sent them, and have not received their words
from my mouth, who profit not the people at all, but declare their own dreams,
and tell of visions and imaginations of their own hearts, which I never spoke
to them, which reaches not my Witness, and burdens my seed; which seed cries
for the bread of life, living bread, living water from my living Fountain of
light and life.

Then, oh then shall it go well with thee oh Nation! oh County! oh people! says
the Lord; and I will be your Teacher, I will be your Pastor, your Father, and
you shall be my children; and I will be with you, and bless and multiply you,
and you shall know your Teacher in the midst of you, and your Bread and Waters
shall never fail you, no want in your dwellings, and peace shall flow in as a
River, and plenty as a Flood unto you; and I will be a Wall about you, and for
good will watch over you; and I will bring forth my living Witnesses in you,
which shall declare and make known my everlasting Gospel with life and power
unto you, and shall freely and boldly declare it in the midst of you, who shall
not flatter nor spare mine Enemies among you, who shall not seek themselves,
but my glory and Name to be exalted in the midst of you; who shall not preach
for hire, nor seek gain from any quarter of you, but shall preach the Gospel,
and live of the Gospel with you; and I will be with them, to preserve and keep
them as the apple of mine eye in the midst of you. And you Powers, touch not
mine anointed, nor do my Prophets no harm, I warn and charge you says the
Lord; for vengeance is mine, and I will repay it unto you. And you O people,
prise the Lords love now tendered unto you, and know this day of your visitation
before it be hid from you, and that day of his fierce wrath over take you, in
the which you will say, We have no pleasure in it; and then you shall remember
that you were warned in your life time by him who is a lover of all your souls,
and known unto many of you by the Name of

Thomas Howseyor.

Oh City and Town, you are weighed, and found too light: Repent, repent.
AND thou City of Canterbury, and Town of Maidstone, to you the Inhabitants and
people thereof are these lines given forth and written: You are great, and
greatly increased in riches and strength of this World, and you set as Ladies
and Queens in the County, and in your hearts (as your actions declare) say you
have need of nothing; but with the light of Christ you might see, and are
seen, that you are poor, miserable, blind and naked; you have gotten names and
distinctions of Worships, and in words with your tongues spoken, you say
(every party of you) we worship the true God; and so that which is but one,
and without seam or division, you would rent and divide among you, and in your
sensual and fallen wisdoms you would imagine a worship to me, and according
to the number of your Tribes so you make you Gods to worship: Oh foolish
people! says the Lord God, and will not come down to my Witness, my Spirit of
Truth, the Light, my Son, with whom I am well pleased, and with all those who
have learned of him to worship me in the Spirit and the Truth; and so you not
receiving him and his vvitness within you, know not me, nor cannot come to me;
for no man knovveth me but him to whom my Son (the true light, which
enlightneth every one that comes into the world) draws and reveals,
Matthew. 11. 27. And not receiving him, nor feeling him within to guide, you have
gotten a Profession, but want the possession; and forms you have, but want
the power; the Saints words and practices to talk of you have gotten, and
imitations you have gotten, but want the life which they were in, and feel
not the life that they felt, who in the life had dominion over their wills,
their lusts, their pride, their passion, their envy, their hatred, strife and
debate, wrathfulness, maliciousness, idle words, idle talking, and vain
jesting, whispering and backiting, they were in the life, and witnessed
redemption from the world and its vain conversations, profits, pleasures,
vanities, lusts pollutions, fashions, words, ways, worships, and empty
traditions, and beggarly Elements and Rudiments, that perish in the using: They
witnessed the life, that grace that taught them to deny all ungodliness and
worldly lusts, and that led them to live soberly, holy in all manner of
conversation in this present evil World.

Now then try your selves you professors in these Towns, all of you, see if
this life you vvitness, and by it set over the world and your lusts, otherwise
all your professions are vain; and to the light in all your consciences come
down, that will let you see where you are, and vvitness for God against you all,
that you are far from the life and power of God, and not like the Saints that
gave forth Scriptures; and so with the light of Christ you are seen, and by
the children of Light denied.

And you who call your selves Independents in these Towns, you are become many
of you more proud, and vain, and light in your Attires, and more envious and
malicious in your practices against the children of light then that people of
the Nation and Towns that you say you are separated from; and though you talk
of Liberty, and Freedom, and Church Privileges as you call them; and though
you once cried out against your forefathers, the Bishops and Presbyters, when
you were servants and in bondage under them, yet now your selves being become
Masters, your hands are as heavy as their loins, and that many of the servants
of the Lord have felt in this Nation, and some in this County in your Towns.

And though you are as Sisters together, as Samaria the elder, and Sodom the
younger, yet thou art become worse then thy elder Sister Samaria, and art become
more brutish and beastly then many of the Heathen; thou art grown haughty and
high minded, r^^sting truth with impudency, refusing to hear the counsel of
the Lord from the mouth of his Messengers, which would deal pl^^nly and
faithfully with thee, and show thee all thy abominations; but thou must have
them to teach thee that will speak pleasing things unto thee, and daub thee
with untempered mortar, and healthy wounds slightly, and lay Pillows under thee
that thou mayestly down softly; but woe to you that live at ease, you careless
Daughters that are at ease, and to you Pastors that are at ease, and thou O
Babylon that art at ease, thy Inhabitants will I disquiet says the Lord, Moah
has been at ease from his youth; woe to the Heathen that are at ease; woe, woe to
all you that have slain the Witness in the streets, and now grow merry on the
earth over the Witness; the Lord God of Power will raise to life his own
Witness, his true and faithful Witness; Rev 1.5. Jesus Christ the Light of the
world, he is the faithful Witness, and by him all shall be judged; he will call
forth his own Witness in you all, and he will be a swift witness against all
that do wickedly, against all you scorners, haters, despisers of them that fear
the Lord; you proud and lofty ones, I warn you all betimes, Come down to the
Witness of God in you all which will tell you that you should not live in your
pride, nor lusts, nor pleasures, for he that is there, is dead while he lives.
So I warn you all again, Take heed you go not from it, but hear its voice; do
nothing which he reproves and testifies against, and when any from the Lord
speaks to the raising of him in you, be still, let the Witness stand on his
feet, hear his testimony I warn you all that the enemy of your eternal peace
may he discovered, and with the breath of his mouth, and brightness of his
coming utterly destroyed, that so the life of the Just by you may be witnessed,
which is by faith in the Son of God, the Light; it is not in words and shadows,
as Clouds without rain; but in life and power, with joy and peace in the Holy
Ghost. So all of you while you have time prise it, and mind the light of Christ
in you all, by it to be ordered in every thing, that your lives may preach
forth holiness in all manner of conversation; which is the desire of him who is
a friend to truth, and to some of you known by the name of

T. H.

To those called Magistrates and Justices in the County of Kent, a warning that
you shed no innocent blood.
To Michael Leusey, High Sheriff of the County, with those in present Power and
Authority.
THis is the Word of the Lord God of life and power to you all, who is over you
all, blessed for evermore: I am he by whom Kings reign, and Governors make
Decrees, who searches all hearts, and knows all secrets, and will do
righteously, and reward all according to their works and doings; I am he that
respects no man's person, but every where those that fear me, and work
righteousness, shall be accepted.

Yea, I am he says the Lord, who has preserved and defended many of you when
the Sword was drawn, and drunk much blood in your Land, and in your County; and
you have seen my strong Arm, which is mighty to save and deliver in the day of
battle, and have brought to naught the plottings and conspiracies of mine and
your Enemies to this day.

And you are preserved to this day, and entrusted with my power, and in places
of Government in this County, not to please your selves, not to seek your selves,
but in all things him who has kept, and preserved, and entrusted you in his
service, and for me (says the Lord) to govern, and on me to wait, pure wisdom
and counsel to receive, all things to do and order, to the praise and glory of
my Name, who has the whole power, and there is no other with me, nor like unto
me, says the Lord, who kills and makes alive; throws down one, and exalts
whom I please.

Therefore O ye Powers of the earth, fear before me continually, and tremble
at my word, which is a sword and a fire that will devour all briars and thorns,
yea all that stand against it, but it is good to all that walk uprightly; yea,
my Word is nigh unto you, I have placed a measure of my self, my eternal
Witness, that will not consent to any evil; in your consciences it is, that
vvil, that shall accuse you when you do evil, and excuse you when you are
righteously, justly, singly, uprightly: And this my word is light in you all,
and does make manifest all your deeds of darkness, and does not spare, but
reproves plainly, it is that which searches the heart, and tries the reins,
and knows all your thoughts; I am he, says the Lord, stand in awe before me.

And this is my word now to you all, that you mind my eternal Witness placed in
the midst of you, and that to it you keep at all times, in all places, and by
it to be ordered in all you do, in every thing committed to your trust, that
you never depart from it, but in its power you always stand, that the unruly
and disobedient by it in you all may be brought low, and your own wills denied
in every thing; that you begin at home to lay the yoke upon the unruly, and the
sword upon the transgressor, to cut him out out of the Land, that it may be
cleansed from the evil doer in your own particular, that so my will which is
pure being done in you, and by you, and my Law which is undefiled being written
in your hearts, and you all in my fear abide, waiting in the light of Christ
which has shined into your own souls, and shown you the Enemy there, and past
judgment on him there, you in that abiding will be completely furnished with my
wisdom, says the Lord, to govern and rule over men in righteousness, and so
you will all become a terror to the evil doer at home, abroad, at all times, in
all seasons, but a praise and encouragement to them that do well; and then the
end for which I the Lord have ordained Magistrates to rule, will by you in your
places be truly accomplished; and then shall the righteous in you rejoice, and
that wicked shall be brought to shame; then shall you be to the just as the rain
to the Land new sown; then shall the righteous in the County praise my Name for
you, and I will establish you in peace, who makes peace, and none can make war,
and exalt you above all your enemies at home and abroad; but if from my
teachings, my Witness in the midst of you ye turn, and his voice will not hear
and obey, then my will by you will be denied, your own wills which are
corrupted vvil be done, and then I make war, and none can make peace.

Now therefore, O ye men of place and authority in that Nation and County, I
am moved of the Lord to vvarn you all to take heed what you do in all things
committed to your power and trust, that you therein be found faithful, as the
Lords Stevvards, and that none of you go beyond your power, nor yet from the
true Power, the Light of Christ in all your consciences, which vvil show
you, if you keep to it, how and when to give Caesar his due, and God his; the
conscience is the Lords, he rules there, that must be kept single, holy for
him; I vvarn you, Meddle not with them that cannot bovv to the wills of any
but God alone; touch not Gods anointed, harm not his innocent Lambs, who are
as the apple of his eye, who dare not do their own wills, nor please
themselves, but in all things him, in him all power is; and for him at this day
stand single, and rather suffer the loss of all their outword enjoyments, then
to sin against their God by doing any thing contrary to the Witness of God
within, and the Scriptures recorded without; I am free to tell you it is a good
report of you, I mean many of you in thy County, who have not appeared
forward as yet to shed innocent blood, nor to restrain and imprison the
Messengers and Ministers of Christ sent amongst us; and if you keep faithful to
the Witness of God in your consciences, you vvil never do it whatever it cost
you: And for such of you as are and have been friendly to truth, and the
declarers of it, I can safely tell you who are single and upright in what you
do, you do, and shall know that your rewarder is nigh you, with the Lord our
God; and for any who are enemies to us and the truth of our God; their rage
shall he restrain, and we shall be enabled with patience and long-suffering to
bear his vvil and good pleasure, and in the midst of all our cruelties to pray
our Father to forgive them, they know not what they do.

Also, I desire and warn you all in Authority to take heed that you do not
lend your ear to the Priests of this County that preach for hire, and divine
for money, and if it be not put into their mouths they prepare war against
their Neighbor; for that generation the Scriptures of truth declare to be
bloody, they smote the Prophets, they cried, crucify the Son of God, and said
he was worthy to die; that generation in these days are little behind them,
their Fathers eat the Grapes, and their teeth are on edge; they go so fast as
they durst, and wait for further power: Oh ye Power of the Earth! take heed
what ye do in delivering the innocent servants of God into their hands; for the
best of their mercies and cruelties, as many prisons in this Nation, if not
some in this County, will witness, where many of the servants of the Lord have
lain many months, because they cannot in their consciences pay them (as they
call it) tithes, that idle, antichristian, beggarlie Rudiment, which none of
the Ministers of Christ do, or durst own or compel the Saints unto, but did
rather labor with their hands then make their Gospel chargeable to any, who
said they had freely received, and did freely give; and so the Ministers of
Christ do now: Paul said 1 Cor. 9.14. That God had ordained that they which
preach the Gospel shall live of the Gospel. Therefore take heed you Powers that
you do not go beyond your Power to compel any to pay Tithes to maintain a
Gospel Ministry, when God has ordained that they were to live of the Gospel,
and should live of the Gospel and not by the Law; for if you do compel any to
that thing, I declare unto you all, you are Enemies to God and his children,
and do inasmuch as in you lies, cause them to disobey the Ordinance of God.

And you may read, that tithes to be paid to the first Priesthood, the
Levitical Priesthood, which was after the Order of Aaron, not of Christ the
second Priesthood, the everlasting offering; so all that pay tithes, that take
tithes, are of the first Priesthood, they deny the second to be come, and the
Priesthood to be changed, and the Law changed

Therefore consider what you do, all of you, lest you resist the Power, God is
the Power, what he has ordained stands with power, and his Gospel has in
it a power, and he that resists the power, resists the ordinrnce of God:
and all such shall bring upon themselves judgment. So all that vvil be out of
fear of the Power, do well, and so thou shall have praise o^ the same; but he
that does evil is under the power, and the Svvord is not placed there for
naught; but vvil take vengeance on them that do evil without respect of
persons.

Let none deceive you with their vain words, and flattering speeches, who
seeks not the good of your souls but their own bellies, and now do the same
things the Prelates and Priests did before them, by whose means much innocent
blood has been shed in these Nations.

So to that of God in all your consciences I have and do speak, which is the
witness for God, and will not deal deceitfully with you, but will speak the
truth, if you will hear it, to all of you; and if any now shall refuse to hear
its voice, and will not receive its testimony which is truth, there will come a
day in which the Lord will have his everlasting witness come forth, and if that
condemn, he is greater; so in the mouth of two Witnesses all shall be confirmed;
therefore now hear and be warned every one of you, and do nothing in your own
wills but wait in the pure light of Christ, and by it be directed and ordered at
all times in all things; quench not its motions, stay not behind it; neither
go before it, for if you do you shall be judged and condemned by it: And blessed
are all those that love the light and walk in the Light, and believe in the
Light, and become obedient children to the Light, such have their part in the
first Resurrection, and over them the second death shall have no power.

And to so many as receive him, and believe in him, and obey him, of him they
receive power, and are become the sons of God.

But all that deny him before men, he will deny them before his Father which
is in heaven.

So in love to all your souls, which are more worth then all the world, then
all your honor, then all your riches, I warn you all to mind the light of
Christ in you all, the witness for God, by it to be ordered in every thing,
word, and work, believe it, become children of it, and if you walk in the
light, as he is in the light, you have fellowship with him and his Father, and
by his blood you are all purged from all sin; but if you deny the light of
Christ, and will not obey its teachings, by it you shall be eternally condemned,
and then woe and condemnation shall be your portion for ever.

This is the Word of the Lord God unto you all, whether you hear or forbear,
declared and given forth by him who is a friend to all your souls, and seeks
the redemption of the seed out of bondage; and am known to many of you by the
name of

Thomas Howseyor.

THE END.
