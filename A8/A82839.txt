THE SPEECH Made thereupon by the Honorable DENZELL HOLLES Esquire One of the
COMMISSIONERS.
Dread Sovereign,
YOur faithful Subjects the Commons of England assembled in Parliament have
sent us hither, Twelve of their Number to wait upon your Majesty; and by their
Commands we are here prostrate at your Royal feet, where themselves are all of
them present with us in the sincere and most Loyal affections and desires of
their hearts, and would have been in their persons, if your Majesty's service,
and the trust reposed in them by all the several parts of the Kingdom did not
necessarily require their attendance and continuance in the place where they
now are, and where all their thoughts and endeavors are wholly taken up, and
employed in those two great and main works, which are the proper and genuine
ends of all Parliaments, the Advancement of their Kings service and the
discharge of their Countries trust.

And certainly, Sir, we can speak it with a great deal of Joy, and with no
less of Truth, that never Parliament made greater demonstrations of Zeal,
Affection and Loyalty to any of the Kings of England, then this Parliament has
done, and does, and we hope, and doubt not, nay we know it that it ever will do
unto your Majesty, our Liege Lord and King. Their hearts are filled with a
Veneration of you, Longings for you, Confidence in you, and Desires to see and
serve you, and their tongues do upon all occasions express it; and in so doing
they are (according to the Nature of Parliaments) the true Representative of
the whole Nation: for they but do that in a more contracted and regular way,
which the Generality of the people of the Land, from the one end of it to
another, do in a more confused and disorderly manner, yet as heartily and as
affectionately, all degrees, and ages, and sexes, high and low, rich and poor
(as I may say) Men, Women, and Children join in sending up this prayer to
Heaven, God bless King Charles, Long live King Charles; So as our English air
is not susceptible of any other sound, and echoes out nothing else; our Bells,
Bonefires, peals of Ordinance, Volleys of shot, the shouts and acclamations of
the People, bears no other Moral, have no other Signification, but to triumph,
triumphs of our King in the hearts of his people.

Your Majesty cannot imagine nor can any man conceive it but he who was
present to see and hear it, with what Joy, what cheerfulness, what lettings
out of the Soul, what expressions of transported minds, a stupendous
concourse of people, attended the proclayming of your Majesty in your Cities
of London and Westminster, to be our most potent, mighty, and undoubted King,
the oldest man living never saw the like before, nor is it probable, scarce
possible, that he who has longest to live will ever see the like again,
especially (and God forbid he should) upon such an Occasion, for we wish and
heartily pray that your Majesty may be the last of men of the Generation now
in being, who shall leave his place to a successor.

We have here the Proclamation it self to present unto your Majesty and the
Order of the two Houses enjoining it to be proclaimed throughout England,
Ireland, and your Dominions of Wales; And likewise their Orders for all
Ministers in their public Prayers to pray for your Majesty, and for the
Illustrious Prince the Duke of York your Majesty's Brother, and for the rest of
the Royal Progeny; and another Order of theirs for taking down every where the
assumed arms of the late pretended Common wealth, and setting up the Arms of
your Majesty in their stead.

Here he tendered the Proclamation and the several Orders unto his Majesty,
offered to read them, but then said, he thought that his Majesty had already
received them from the Lords, and that therefore it would be but a trouble to
his Majesty to hear them again. To which his Majesty answering that he had
received them, was pleased further to enlarge himself in some discourse to this
effect; Expressing his sense of the miseries which his people had suffered
under those unlawful Governors which had ruled over them, and of his
gladness for their returning unto him, with those good affections, which they
now showed toward him; adding that he had always made it his study, and ever
would to make them as happy as himself, which was the Sum and Substance of
what his Majesty said.

To which was replied with humble thanks for those gracious expressions, That
his Majesty would ever find both Parliament and People to be full of Loyalty
and Obedience unto his Majesty: as his Majesty was of grace and goodness
toward them. And then he went on with his Speech, relating to those orders and
proceedings of Parliament; And said,

These are some testimonies of their love and affection unto your Majesty such
as can as yet be expressed by them, which are but as a picture in little of a
great and large body, which far exceeds in its true, and natural dimensions,
the whole compass of a small piece of cloth, on which notwithstanding it is
drawn and represented to the life.

And may it please your Majesty to gives us leave to say, that as the
affection, so your Subjects expectations of you are high, and their longings
after you, great and vehement. And both expectations and longings have
increased by the long time; that your Majesty has been kept from them. Hope
deferred makes the heart sick. And the sickness still augments till the thing
hoped for be Obtained.

You who are the light of their eyes, and the breath of their nostrils, their
delight and all their hope, to have been so long banished from them into a
strange land, it is no wonder that the news of your return, should put a new
life into them, what then will it be when their eyes shall be blessed, with the
sight of your Royal Person? And therefore are we commanded humbly to acquaint
your Majesty with the earnest desires of both Houses for your speedy return
unto your Parliament, and the exercise of your Kingly Office; And that in order
to it, they have given directions to General Montague one of the Generals at
Sea and to the other Officers at Sea, to observe such Commands, as your
Majesty shall please to give them for the disposal of the Fleet; And we have
it in our instructions further to beseech your Majesty to let your Parliament
know when, and where, your Majesty purposes to take shipping, and where to
land; and after your coming on shore, whither to come all the way to London
by land, or by water from Gravesend; And which of your Houses your Majesty
intends to make use of at your coming to London, that accordingly provision
may be made for your Majesty's reception, for then, and not till then will be
the completing of your subjects rejoicing.

True it is (as your Majesty was pleased just now to touch upon it) that in
your absence, other Lords have had Dominion over them, have reignned and ruled
over their bodies, and estates; but their better part their hearts and minds
and souls were free, and did abhor such Rulers, and still continued faithful
and loyal to your Majesty, their rightful Lord and Sovereign and with you
and under you they now expect to re-enter into the possession of their ancient
rights, and privileges, to enjoy again their Laws, and Liberties, and which
is above all their Religion in purity, and truth; of all which those Lords (who
called themselves so, and made themselves so (that is, to be so called, but in
truth were not so, for they were nothing less, those kind of Lords I say had
so long deprived them. This is our expectation from your Majesty and we are
more then confident, we shall not be deceived in it, but that your Majesty
will answer and go beyond all that can be expected from you: A King of so many
vows, and of so many Prayers, cannot but crown the desires of his people.

Sir to tell you what men think, and say, and wish, and even are assured of in
relation to your Majesty and the happiness which your Government will produce,
would seem a description of the Golden Age, that Poets fancy.

Truly we dare not undertake it, in your Majestys presence, least we should be
thought to flatter, and should offend the sacred modesty of your ears, and of
your princely mind. Though it would all be but a real truth; yet looking like
that, which you do not like, we fear you would dislike it for the look sake,
Great princes will not be flattered, but really, and truly served, and we
desire to serve your Majesty in your own way.

Your Majesty has been pleased to declare your royal intentions unto your
Parliament, in your gracious letters, to either house and the two houses have
severally given unto your Majesty a faithful account of that grateful sense,
wherewith they have received them, and of their humble submission unto and
compliance with, all-your Majestyes desires, which by their Letters in answer
unto your Majesty's they make bold to signify. That from the House of Peers
has been already presented and we who are before your majesty are entrusted by
the House of Commons with the delivery of theirs, an honor not more conferred
upon us beyond our deservings, then embraced and received by us, with an
excess of joy and with all due respects, which is the errand upon which we are
now come. That Letter and the Proclamation and the several Orders, together
with our selves, our lives and fortunes, and the vows and services of those
who sent us, we do with all humbleness lay at your majesty's feet, lifting up
our hearts and hands to the God of Heaven, for your majesty's long and happy
reign over us, and speedy return unto us.

FINIS.
