THE ORDER Of the House of the LORDS, FOR calling in, and suppressing of a
SERMON, falsely Fathered upon JAMES ARCHBISHOP of ARMAGH, Under the Title of VOX
HIBERNIAE.

LONDON. Printed by R. B. for PHILEMON STEVENS. 1641.

TO The RIGHT HONOURABLF, THE House of PEERS, NOW ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT. The
Humble Petition of JAMES Archbishop of ARMAGH.
Humbly shows,
THAT whereas your Lordships, were pleased to employ your Petitioner in
preaching before you on the Fast Day, the 22. of December last: (which service,
according to his mean ability, he was careful to perform:) so it is, that
one JOHN NICHOLSON, having got into his hands, a collection of some rude, and
incoherent Notes of that Sermon, took the boldness to publish the same (under
the Title of VOX HIBERNIAE) as a true Relation of that which was uttered before
your Lordships that day. Which being in many places void of common sense, and
in the whole, every way unanswerable unto what was fit to have been delivered
before so Honorable and Judicious an Audience,

His humble request is, That your Lordships would be pleased, to call in that
supposititious Pamphlet, etc.

Die Veneris 11. Februarii, 1641.
Ordered by the Lords in Parliament, That a Book concerning the L. Archbishop
of Armagh, being published and Printed by John Nicholson, shall be called in
and suppressed.
