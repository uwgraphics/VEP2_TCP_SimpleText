LONDON, Printed for Nathaniel Butter, Jan. 17. 1643.

Don Alonso de Cardenas, The Ambassador Ordinary for the King of Spain, His
Speech unto His Majesty at Oxford, December. the 30. 1642. occasioned by the
taking out of the Port of Sancto Domingo one of the King of Spain his Ships
called Sancta Clara, laden with Plate, and other merchandise of rich value, by
Cap. Bennet Strafford, by him brought unto Southampton, and there made prize;
together with the answer of his Majesty sent on New-yeers day unto the said
Ambassador, by the Lords Mowbray and Faulkland.
SIR,
THe unsufferable wrong the King my Master has lately sustained by a Subject
of your Majesty's (wherein many of his own Merchants have likewise borne some
share, and what your Majesty for the future may do is not yet known) have in
obedience to my Masters commands (who is but too sensible of this affront, and
his peoples losses,) constrained me to make this my repair unto your Majesty,
and to trouble you in these your most serious and important affairs of your
Kingdoms, it having not been my unhappiness since I had first the charge of
this honorable employment, to provoke discontent by such messages unto your
Majesty, especially at such a time wherein my Master perfectly understanding
how it fares with your Majesty, for the cordial reference he ever bore unto
your Majesty's own person, had rather afford your Majesty a cordial then a
corrasive: yet this in brief must be the sum of my complaint unto your Majesty.

That on the eighth of October Stilo veteri, there arrived in the harbor, or
rather close port of Sancto Domingo of the West Indies (the very center of my
Masters Dominions) a Ship of your Majesty's, and a Pinnace, under the command
of Captain Bennet Strafford, an English man, and a member of your Majesty's
Fleet at Sea, which letting fall anchor under color of ^aking in fresh water,
and some other necessary provision, about one or two of the clock the same
evening (the Master and other Officers of my Masters fair Ship, called La
Sancta Clara, lately having taken in her lading of Silver Ingots, to the number
of 2000. with Coucheneale, Tobacco, Indie hides, to eight hundred tun weight)
was in a thievish and Piratick manner stolen out of the said harbor by the
Captain of your Majesty's Ship above mentioned, that is, Bennet Strafford,
whose men coming aboard the said Ship, under pretense of chearing and merry
making, observing the wind served for their design, cut the cables, and let
her drive, till such time that the Captain perceiving his advantage, forthwith
seized and boarded the said Ship, clapping all my Masters Sailers and other
Officers there aborad her under the hatches, carried the ship unto Cape de bona
Speranza there landed them ashore in his long boat like slaves and captives,
manned my Masters Ship with his own men, unto your town of Southampton, and
there made prize of her, exposing my Masters goods to most unconsiderable rates
and valuation, to make the better dispatch of his unlawful attempt. Sir, I am
rigorously commanded by the King of Spain my Master, to intimate to your
Majesty, that an affront of this kind has never been committed against him by
the Crown of England, or by any other Crown or State, during the time of
their league and amity, neither during his peace, sworn either between your
Majesty's father or your self, can any evident proof be brought of the least
appearance of violation either betwixt Crowns or Kingdoms on his Catholic
Majesty my Masters part: For instance whereof, my Master desires your Majesty
to consider his sincere and princely dealing with your Majesty's self, as
touching your Rebels in Ireland, whom he has been any way so far from
succouring, ayding, or countenancing, that he has straightly charged all his
Subjects of all his Territories and Dominions, by open proclamation, upon pain
of death, not only not to aid or relieve them with any arms, shipping,
ammunition or victuals; but not to trade with them during the time of their
rebellion against your Majesty, upon any terms, semblances, or pretenses
whatsoever; having further given in command unto the officers of his Finances
and Excheate, that the pensions usually paid unto certain of the nobility of
Ireland, in way of acknowledgement that they or their fathers have done him any
memorable service, either in the Low Countries or any other his Dominions,
shall in no wise be any longer paid to any of them, either father, child, or
any of the lineage that stand at this time, or ever shall stand in opposition
against your Majesty or undoubted issue; and has in particular disabled Sr.
Philomie O neale of the large gratuite annuity of 4000. ducates per annum,
though granted not by his now Majesty and my Master of Spain, but by his father
unto the Earl of Tyrone his heyrs and successors by pattent; by all which I
earnestly desire your Majesty to weigh my Masters high discontent, and in that
regard his just demands: a Ship of that estimate is taken in such a daring
scornful manner, not upon the maine (that in some sort had quallified the
affront though not the damage) but out of my Masters Port, laden with Bullyon
for his own particular use, by a Subject, yea, a servant of your Majesty's
Crown arriving there (as it seemed) for relief; and having partaken of all
the favor the haven then could afford, his Subjects and servants turned ashore
as villains and slaves; his Ship and goods made prize. My Masters demands unto
your Majesty in a wrong of so high a condition are these: That the said
Captain may receive condign punishment, as who (what lay in him) has broken
the league on your Majesty's behalf; that full restitution be made both to my
Master and the owners, according to the just valuation of the goods, as by bil
of lading shall be made manifest; that strict orders may forthwith pass from
your Majesty, for the staying of farther havoc, and embeselling of the goods
yet remaining in the Ship at Southampton; that full reparation be likewise made
for stay of the Ship, and frustration of her voyage; upon refusal of which I
am expressly to declare unto your Majesty, that the King my Master will cause
speedy stay and arrest to be made upon all the English Merchants ships
throughout his ports, which must needs occasion great discontent, loss and
inconvenience to both the Crowns, if no other worse thing arise.

This Speech, or rather Complaint of the Ambassadors ended, the King withdrew
him unto the window in his presence chamber at Christ Church; there spoke
certain words in private, and after (before certain Lords there about him)
told him, that unto his message or complaint some time to morrow he would by
his Secretary, or some other, send him an answer; whereat the Ambassador took
leave of the King, and repaired unto his lodging in New-Colledge.

New Years Day (being Sunday, January 1.) about four of the clock in the
Afternoon, the Lord Mowbray and the Lord Faulkland brought from the King unto
the Ambassador this Answer following.
My Lord, The King Our Master has commanded Us to return this Answer as
touching your heavy complaint unto Him yesterday.
THat His Majesty has with deep discontent resented the particulars of your
Lordships Message, or Complaint. Yet neither himself, nor any Ministers,
Agents, or Servants of His, by Sea or Land, are in any wise (as from Him) to be
blamed of any breach of amity; much less of this, being in so high a nature
as his Lordship had lately related it.

That Captain Bennet Strafford was never employed by Him in any of His Ships or
Pinnaces: and therefore (when time should serve) should not only answer for
what he did in His Majesty's Ships, but by whose authority he came there.

That His Majesty further desired, that what at this time, above all other,
might be done against the League, either by Sea or Land, might not be imputed
unto Him; his Majesty (through the distempers of some of his Subjects) having
as little command over his ships, as he had over his Towns and Castles.

That He would issue forth a Proclamation, with all convenient speed, to
prevent the further embezelling of the Merchandises of the Ship; and likewise
for the restoring what should be found in the hands of any of His Subjects or
Officers, and therein would give especial command unto the Judge of His
Admiraltie. But would be sorry the King of Spain should make all his Subjects
trading under him to suffer, for the villainous act of one person, authorized by
he knew not whom.

By the King.

A Proclamation prohibiting the buying or disposing of any the lading of the
Ship called the Sancta Clara, lately brought into SOUTHAMPTON.
COmplaint having been made unto His Majesty, by Don Alonco de Cardenas
Ambassador from the King of Spain, that a Ship called the Sancta Clara,
belonging to the said King and his Subjects, has been lately treacherously
brought to Southampton, by one Captain Bennet Strafford and others, from
Sancto Domingo, the said Ship being laden with Silver, Cocheneal, and other
Wares and Merchandises, to a very great value; And that the said Ship and Goods
being by the said Ambassador arrested, and the said Bennet Strafford
apprehended, whilst a suit for the said Ship and Goods is depending in the
Court of Admiralty, the Silver (part of the lading of the said Ship, to a very
great value) has been disposed of, contrary to Law, without any other security
given for the same, then the empty name of Public Faith; which without His
Majesty cannot (as is well known to all the world) be engaged; or if engaged
without His Majesty is not valid, or to be relied on for satisfaction. And it
is further complained by the said Ambassador, that the Cocheneale, and other
Merchandises formerly sequestered at London and Southampton, albeit they are not
perishable, but have rather increased in their price and value, are likely to
be sold against the will of those who pretend to be the Owners, (Parties to the
suite depending in the said Court of Admiralty) which is alleged to be
apparently against the Rules of Law, and practices of that Court in such cases.
His Majesty well weighing what may be the ill consequences of such injurious
Proceedings, manifestly contrary to the Law, and the Articles of Treaty
between the two Crowns, and plainly foreseeing how heavily it may light upon
such of His good Subjects who have estates in Spain, and how destructive it
may prove to the Trade and Commerce of His Subjects and Kingdoms, does hereby
not only expressly charge and command the Judge of His Admiraltie, and all
others whom it may concern, to proceed in a business of such value and
consequence, with Care, Expedition, and according to Justice: But does also
expressly prohibit all persons, of what condition soever, upon pretense of any
Order or Warrant from one or both Houses of Parliament, or any authority
derived from thence, to buy, meddle with, or dispose of any part of the said
Cocheneale, or other Goods or Merchandises belonging to the said Ship, until
the propriety thereof shall be judicially decided and determined, upon pain of
His Majesty's high displeasure, and of being responsible and liable to payment
and satisfaction for whatsoever damage shall happen to any of His Majesty's
good Subjects, whose Goods or Estates shall for that cause be embargued or
seized in Spain.

Given at the Court at Oxford, the second day of Januarie, in the eighteenth
year of His Majesty's Reign.
God save the King,
FINIS.
