A DECLARATION FROM THE Poor oppressed People OF ENGLAND, DIRECTED To all that
call themselves, or are called Lords of Manors, through this NATION; That have
begun to cut, or that through fear and covetousness, do intend to cut down the
Woods and Trees that grow upon the Commons and Waste Land.

Printed in the Year, 1649.

A DECLARATION FROM THE Poor oppressed People of England.
WE whose names are subscribed, do in the name of all the poor oppressed people
in England, declare unto you, that call your selves Lords of Manors, and Lords
of the Land, That in regard the King of Righteousness, our Maker, has
enlightened our hearts so far, as to see, That the earth was not made purposely
for you, to be Lords of it, and we to be your Slaves, Servants, and Beggars;
but it was made to be a common Livelihood to all, without respect of persons:
And that your buying and selling of Land, and the Fruits of it, one to another,
is The cursed thing, and was brought in by War; which has, and still does
establish murder, and theft, in the hands of some branches of Mankind over
others, which is the greatest outward burden, and unrighteous power, that the
Creation groans under: For the power of enclosing Land, and owning Propriety,
was brought into the Creation by your Ancestors by the Sword; which first did
murder their fellow Creatures, Men, and after plunder or steal away their
Land, and left this Land successively to you, their Children. And therefore,
though you did not kill or theeve, yet you hold that cursed thing in your hand,
by the power of the Sword; and so you justify the wicked deeds of your
Fathers; and that sin of your Fathers, shall be visited upon the Head of you,
and your Children, to the third and fourth Generation, and longer too, tell
your bloody and theeving power be rooted out of the Land.

And further, in regard the King of Righteousness has made us sensible of our
burdens, and the cries and groanings of our hearts are come before him: We
take it as a testimony of love from him, That our hearts begin to be freed from
slavish fear of men, such as you are; and that we find Resolutions in us,
grounded upon the inward law of Love, one toward another, To Dig and Plough up
the Commons, and waste Lands through England; and that our conversation shall
be so unblameable, That your Laws shall not reach to oppress us any longer,
unless you by your Laws will shed the innocent blood that runs in our veins.

For though you and your Ancestors got your Propriety by murder and theft, and
you keep it by the same power from us, that have an equal right to the Land
with you, by the righteous Law of Creation, yet we shall have no occasion of
quarreling (as you do) about that disturbing devil, called Particular
Propriety: For the Earth, with all her Fruits of Corn, Cattle, and such like,
was made to be a common Storehouse of Livelihood to all Mankind, friend, and
foe, without exception.

And to prevent all your scrupulous Objections, know this, That we must neither
buy nor sell: Money must not any longer (after our work of the Earths community
is advanced) be the great god, that hedges in some, and hedges out others; for
Money is but part of the Earth: And surely, the Righteous Creator, who is King,
did never ordain, That unless some of Mankind, do bring that Mineral (Silver
and Gold) in their hands, to others of their own kind, that they should
neither be fed, nor be clothed; no surely, For this was the project of
Tyrant-flesh (which Landlords are branches of) to set his Image upon Money.
And they make this unrighteous Law, That none should buy or sell, eat, or be
clothed, or have any comfortable Livelihood among men, unless they did bring
his Image stamped upon Gold or Silver in their hands.

And whereas the Scriptures speak, That the mark of the Beast is 666, the
number of a man; and that those that do not bring that mark in their hands, or
in their foreheads, they should neither buy nor sell, Revel. 13. 16. And seeing
the numbering Letters round about the English money make 666, which is the
number of that Kingly Power and Glory, (called a Man.) And seeing the age of
the Creation is now come to the Image of the Beast, or Half day. And seeing 666
is his mark, we expect this to be the last Tyrannical power that shall reign;
and that people shall live freely in the enioyment of the Earth, without
bringing the mark of the Beast in their hands, or in their promise; and that
they shall buy Wine and Milk, without Money, or without price, as Isaiah speaks.

For after our work of the ^arthly community is advanced, we must make use of
Gold and Silver, as we do of other metals, but not to buy and sell withal; for
buying and selling is the great cheat, that robs and steals the Earth one from
another: It is that which makes some Lords, others Beggars, some Rulers, others
to be ruled; and makes great Murderers and Thieves to be imprisoners, and
hangers of little ones, or of sincere-hearted men.

And while we are made to labor the Earth together, with one consent and
willing mind; and while we are made free, that every one, friend and foe,
shall enjoy the benefit of their Creation, that is, To have food and raiment
from the Earth, their Mother; and every one subject to give account of his
thoughts, words, and actions to none, but to the one only righteous Judge, and
Prince of Peace; the Spirit of Righteousness that dwells, and that is now
rising up to rule in every Creature, and in the whole Globe. We say, while we
are made to hinder no man of his Privileges given him in his Creation, equal
to one, as to another; what Law then can you make, to take hold upon us, but
Laws of Oppression and Tyranny, that shall enslave or spill the blood of the
Innocent? And so your Selves, your Judges, Lawyers, and Justices, shall be
found to be the greatest Transgressors, in, and over Mankind.

But to draw nearer to declare our meaning, what we would have, and what we
shall endevor to the uttermost to obtain, as moderate and righteous Reason
directs us; seeing we are made to see our Privileges, given us in our
Creation, which have hitherto been denied to us, and our Fathers, since the
power of the Sword began to rule, And the secrets of the Creation have been
locked up under the traditional, Parrat-like speaking, from the Universities,
and Colleges for Scholars, And since the power of the murdering, and theeving
Sword, formerly, as well as now of late years, has set up a Government, and
maintains that Government; for what are prisons, and putting others to death,
but the power of the Sword, to enforce people to that Government which was got
by Conquest and Sword, and cannot stand of it self, but by the same murdering
power? That Government that is got over people by the Sword and kept by the
Sword, is not set up by the King of Righteousness to be his Law, but by
Coveteousness, the great god of the world; who has been permitted to reign for
a time, times, and dividing of time, and his government draws to the period of
the last term of his allotted time; and then the Nations shall see the glory of
that Government that shall rule in Righteousness, without either Sword or Spear,

And seeing further, the power of Righteousness in our hearts, seeking the
Livelihood of others as well as our selves, has drawn forth our bodies to
begin to dig, and plough, in the Commons and waste Land, for the Reasons
already declared,

And seeing and finding our selves poor, wanting Food to feed upon, while we
labor the Earth, to cast in Seed, and to wait tell the first Crop comes up; and
wanting Ploughs, Carts, Corn, and such materials to plant the Commons withal,
we are willing to declare our condition to you, and to all, that have the
Treasury of the Earth, locked up in your Bags, Chests, and Barns, and will
offer up nothing to this public Treasury; but will rather see your fellow
Creatures starve for want of Bread, that have an equal right to it with your
selves, by the Law of Creation: But this by the way we only declare to you,
and to all that follow the subtle art of buying and selling the Earth, with her
Fruits, merely to get the Treasury thereof into their hands, to lock it up from
them, to whom it belongs; that so, such coveteous, proud, unrighteous, selfish
flesh, may be left without excuse in the day of Judgment.

And therefore, the main thing we aim at, and for which we declare our
Resolutions to go forth, and act, is this, To lay hold upon, and as we stand in
need, to cut and fell, and make the best advantage we can of the Woods and
Trees, that grow upon the Commons, To be a stock for our selves, and our poor
Brethren, through the Land of England, to plant the Commons withal; and to
provide us bread to eat, till the Fruit of our labors in the Earth bring forth
increase; and we shall meddle with none of your Proprieties (but what is called
Commonage) till the Spirit in you, make you cast up your Lands and Goods, which
were got, and still is kept in your hands by murder, and theft; and then we
shall take it from the Spirit, that has conquered you, and not from our
Swords, which is an abominable, and unrighteous power, and a destroyer of the
Creation: But the Son of man comes not to destroy, but to save.

And we are moved to send forth this Declaration abroad, to give notice to
every one, whom it concerns, in regard we hear and see, that some of you, that
have been Lords of Manors, do cause the Trees and Woods that grow upon the
Commons, which you pretend a Royalty unto, to be cut down and sold, for your
own private use, whereby the Common Land, which your own mouths do say belongs
to the poor, is impoverished, and the poor oppressed people robbed of their
Rights, while you give them cheating words, by telling some of our poor
oppressed Brethren, That those of us that have begun to Dig and Plough up the
Commons, will hinder the poor; and so blind their eyes, that they see not
their Privilege, while you, and the rich Freeholders, make the most profit of
the Commons, by your over-stocking of them with Sheep and Cattle; and the poor
that have the name to own the Commons* have the least share therein; nay, they
are checked by you, if they cut Wood, Heath, Turf, or Furseys, in places about
the Common, where you disallow.

Therefore we are resolved to be cheated no longer, not be held under the
slavish fear of you no longer, seeing the Earth was made for us, as well as for
you: And if the Common Land belongs to us who are the poor oppressed, surely
the woods that grow upon the Commons belong to us likewise: therefore we are
resolved to try the uttermost in the light of reason, to know whether we shall
be free men, or slaves. If we lie still, and let you steal away our
birthrights, we perish; and if we Petition we perish also, though we have paid
taxes, given free quarter, and ventured our lives to preserve the Nations
freedom as much as you, and therefore by the law of contract with you, freedom
in the land is our portion as well as yours, equal with you: And if we strive
for freedom, and your murdering, governing Laws destroy us, we can but perish.

Therefore we require, and we resolve to take both Common Land, and Common
woods to be a livelihood for us, and look upon you as equal with us, not above
us, knowing very well, that England, the land of our Nativity, is to be a
common Treasury, of livelihood to all, without respect of persons.

So then, we declare unto you, that do intend to cut our Common Woods and
Trees, that you shall not do it; unless it be for a stock for us, as
aforesaid, and we to know of it, by a public declaration abroad, that the poor
oppressed that live there abouts, may take it, and employ it, for their public
use, therefore take notice we have demanded it in the name of the Commons of
England, and of all the Nations of the world, it being the righteous freedom of
the Creation.

Likewise we declare to you that have begun to cut down our Common Woods and
Trees, and to sell and carry away the same for your private use, that you shall
forbear, and go no farther, hoping, that none that are friends to the
Commonwealth of England, will endeavor to buy any of those Common Trees and
Woods of any of those Lords of Manors, so called, who have, by the murdering
and cheating law of the sword, stolen the Land from younger brothers, who have by
the law of Creation, a standing portion in the Land, as well* and equal with
others. Therefore we hope all Wood-mongers will disown all such private
merchandise, as being a robbing of the poor oppressed, and take notice, that
they have been told our resolution: But if any of you that are VVood-mongers,
will buy it of the poor, and for their use, to stock the Commons, from such as
may be appointed by us to sell it, you shall have it quietly, without
diminution; but if you will slight us in this thing, blame us not, if we make
stop of the Carts you send and convert the VVoods to our own use, as need
requires, it being our own, equal with him that calls himself the Lord of the
Manor, and not his peculiar right, shutting us out, but he shall share with us
as a fellow creature.

For we say our purpose is, to take those Common Woods to fell them, now at
first, to be a stock for our selves, and our children after us, to plant and
manure the Common land withal; for we shall endeavor by our righteous acting
not to leave the earth any longer entangled unto our children, by self-seeking
proprietors; But to leave it a free storehouse, and common treasury to all,
without respect of persons; And this we count is our duty, to endeavor to the
uttermost, every man in his place (according to the national Covenant which
the Parliament set forth) a Reformation to preserve the peoples liberties, one
as well as another: As well those as have paid taxes, and given free quarter,
as those that have either born the sword, or taken our moneys to dispose of
them for public use: for if the Reformation must be according to the word of
God, then every one is to have the benefit and freedom of his creation, without
respect of persons; we count this our duty, we say, to endeavor to the
uttermost, and so shall leave those that rise up to oppose us without excuse,
in their day of Judgment; and our precious blood, we hope, shall not be dear to
us, to be willingly laid down at the door of a prison, or foot of a gallows, to
justify this righteous cause; if those that have taken our money from us, and
promised to give us freedom for it, should turn Tyrants against us: for we must
not fight, but suffer.

And further we intend, that not one, two, or a few men of us shall sell or
exchange the said woods, but it shall be known publikly in Print or writing to
all, how much every such, and such parcel of wood is sold for, and how it is
laid out, either in victuals, corn, ploughs, or other materials necessary.

And we hope we may not doubt (at least we expect) that they that are called
the great Council and powers of England, who so often have declared themselves,
by promises and Covenants, and confirmed them by multitude of fasting days,
and devout Protestations, to make England a free people, upon condition they
would pay moneys, and adventure their lives against the successor of the Norman
Conqueror; under whose oppressing power England was enslaved; And we look upon
that freedom promised to be the inheritance of all, without respect of persons;
And this cannot be, unless the Land of England be freely set at liberty from
proprietors, and become a common Treasury to all her children, as every portion
of the Land of Canaan was the Common livelihood of such and such a Tribe, and
of every member in that Tribe, without exception, neither hedging in any, nor
hedging out.

We say we hope we need not doubt of their sincerity to us herein, and that
they will not gainsay our determinate course; howsoever, their actions will
prove to the view of all, either their sincerity, or hypocrisy: We know what
we speak is our privilege, and our cause is righteous, and if they doubt of
it, let them but send a child for us to come before them, and we shall make it
manifest four ways.

First, by the National Covenant, which yet stands in force to bind Parliament
and people to be faithful and sincere, before the Lord God Almighty, wherein
every one in his several place has covenanted to preserve and seek the liberty
each of other, without respect of persons.

Secondly, by the late Victory over King Charles, we do claim this our
privilege, to be quietly given us, out of the hands of Tyrant-Government, as
our bargain and contract with them; for the Parliament promised, if we would
pay taxes, and give free quarter, and adventure our lives against Charles and
his party, whom they called the Common enemy, they would make us a free people;
These three being all done by us, as well as by themselves, we claim this our
bargain, by the law of contract from them, to be a free people with them, and
to have an equal privilege of Common livelihood with them, they being chosen
by us, but for a peculiar work, and for an appointed time, from among us, not
to be our oppressing Lords, but servants to succor us. But these two are our
weakest proofs. And yet by them (in the light of reason and equity that dwells
in men's hearts) we shall with ease cast down, all those former enslaving,
Norman reiterated laws, in every Kings reign since the Conquest, which are as
thorns in our eyes, and pricks in our sides, and which are called the Ancient
Government of England.

Thirdly, we shall prove, that we have a free right to the land of England,
being borne therein as well as elder brothers, and that it is our right equal
with them, and they with us, to have a comfortable livelihood in the earth,
without owning any of our own kind, to be either Lords, or Landlords over
us: And this we shall prove by plain Text of Scripture, without exposition upon
them, which the Scholars and great ones generally say, is their rule to walk by.

Fourthly, we shall prove it by the Righteous Law of our Creation, That
mankind in all his branches, is the Lord of the Earth and ought not to be in
subjection to any of his own kind without him* but to live in the light of the
law of righteousness, and peace established in his heart.

And thus in love we have declared the purpose of our hearts plainly, without
flattery, expecting love, and the same sincerity from you, without grumbling,
or quarreling, being Creatures of your own Image and mould, intending no other
matter herein, but to observe the Law of righteous action, endeavoring to shut
out of the Creation, the cursed thing, called Particular Propriety, which is
the cause of all wars, bloodshed, theft, and enslaving Laws, that hold the
people under misery.

the whole world. Gerrard VVinstanly John Coulton John Palmer Thomas Star Samuel
