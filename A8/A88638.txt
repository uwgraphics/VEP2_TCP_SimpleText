The mournful form of the Rumps last end, as it was with great applause acted
at Dublin on Monday May 14. 1660.

In the Evening of the aforesaid day, about the hour that Mortals make
Bonfires, there appeared four hideous Moors or Negro's, apparelled in black
with Devils shapes, cloven Feet and large Horns on their heads, on their
shoulders was carried a goodly Rump, with which they marched to the Bonfire at
Mr. Mayors door, being attended with forty Negro's more in Devils shipes also,
twenty going before the Rump, and twenty following it with Links in their
hands, and when they cast it into the fire, they sent forth high and hideous
cries and shreeks after it: Exit Rump. Nay good Rump do not swagger.
