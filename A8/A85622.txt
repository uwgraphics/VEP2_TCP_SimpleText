A great Robbery in the North.
AT a lone house near Wetherby in Yorkshire, there dwelt a rich Gull (by name
Tailour) whose wealth was so abundant, that he is known all about those Coasts
by the name of Rich Tailour, but it seems by the story, that he was as it were
wedded to his riches, and thought it more Religion to adore his Gold than his
God, insomuch that his parsimony was such, that he had even choked his chests,
with his store; but God will not thus be cheated of his honor, but he will
show himself to be a God, and a jealous God, not failing to punish the
offenders, to some purpose: it thus therefore happened, Our most gracious
Sovereign which now is (I beseech the Heavens to bless him, and send him long
to reign) stood in great need of money to pay his Soldiers which he had
levied against the Scots, and was fain to borrow money of some good meaning
men, amongst the rest, an hundred pounds were required from this fatned Bore,
which took such delight to wallow in his silver dirt, but he would part with
his eyes as soon as with his money, as soon the one as the other, and at last
gave a flat denial, saying, that he neither could nor would spare it, and so
dismissed the messenger. O Cur! that any man should adore dirt and dross so
much, that he would not spare a doit to so good a purpose; surely, like a
greedy rascal as he is, he does think he shall never have enough, just like
to the Rich man in the Gospel, he was forced to pull down his old Barnes and
build new, because the old was too little to contain his store, and yet never
contented: or like the Horseleech, he still cries, Give, give, and yet his
gutts are ready to break. I hope the devil loves him so well, that ere it be
long he will give him his guts full of no goodness: but my pious rogue has
caused me to digress, for he was not long without a match.

The Soldiers hearing what a mass of money this scraping wretch had gleaned
up together, and how il-natured he was, that he was unwilling to spare an
hundred pounds, which was (as it were) but a mite, in comparison of his store,
thus plotted it, that they might be revenged of this griping, beastlike man.

A company of Troopers about eight or nine agreed together to go to this
Tailour, and to search and see what money he had so wickedly gathered together;
well, they all agreed, and each man taking his Horse, to the house of this rich
Tailour they ride, and all things were very fit and convenient for them, for it
was about twelve of the clock at night when they came thither; when they came
thither, they found only a man and a maid besides rich Tailour himself, these
three they took and bound, each man drawing his sword and putting it to his
breast, vowing to kill him, if he told them not where his Gold was, he
straightwayes desired them that they would spare his life, and then he began to
bid them look in the till of such a chest, and there they might satisfy
themselves: the chest by relation was at the least three yards long, and when
they had opened it, they sound it as full cramb'd with silver as one piece
could lie to another, which made them almost amazed, then they opened the till
of the chest, where they found two thousand pounds in Gold, that they took in
the first place, and so much of the Silver that it amounted in all to the value
of sourteen thousand pounds. Now you must here understand, that the ringleader
in this act was one Knowles, who was heretofore a dancer on the ropes, and also
a jester to Master John Punteus the French Mountebanke, which traveled
throughout this Kingdom; who (when they had gotten the money) began to show his
feats of activity, upon the table, relling Master Tailour, that he would not
take his money for nothing, he should have some sport for it, and after that
done, they each man to his Horse again, got as fast as they could, and away
they went to shift for themselves. They had not been long gone, but Tailour got
himself loose, and unbound his man and his maid, and with all speed sent his
man to make hue and cry after these Troopers which had robbed him, but they
were not so foolish as to be taken, for every man sought to shift for himself,
and they did it most completely; but this by the way.

It seems by the sequel, that their eyes were more than their bellies, and
that they had taken more than they could well tell what to do with, therefore
they cast a bag with two hundred pounds in it into a bush, and so hied away.
Now it chanced that two men were at plough together, and he that held the
plough going that way where the bush stood, and espied the bag with the two
hundred pounds in it, he had no sooner cast his eyes upon the money, but he
called to his man to shoot off, for he would work no more that day, his man
began to grumble and grutch (...), saying, I se not shoot off, nor Ise not
leefe my days work not I: his master answered, I say, thou shall not, for I
will pay thee thy wages, as also to give thee thy supper; Marry, Gods blessing
on your heart master, said the man, and so they ganged along together to the
next Alehouse, which was not far from them, and there they began to call for
their liquour about them, and in a while they bespoke meat for their suppers;
which incontinently they had, and to it they fell and fed heartily, but the old
proverb says, That sweet meat must have sower sauce, and so it had indeed,
too sower for the poor harmless men who were as innocent in the knowledge of
the robbers, as the child which was but even then borne. And thus it came to
pass.

Old Tailour having sent Hue and Cry after the Troopers which had taken his
fourteen thousand pounds from him, had this accident by the way,

The Hue and Cry chanced to come into the same house where these two poor
plough men were which had found the two hundred pounds, where they poor
innocent men were taken for suspected persons, to he of the Robbers, and also
the money which they had, old Tailour knew very well to be his, for there were
nothing but half Crowns in the bag, and they had diminished but twelve
shillings of it in beer, and their supper, the rest was all told, and found to
be right; well, these men were suspected fellows, old Tail thought, and he
swore he would hang them if it cost him half his estate. Accursed rogue, that
will spend more to cast away an innocent man, than he will lend to his King;
well, to the Goal they were conveyed, whilst the offenders revelled abroad in
security, for some slipped over into France, some into Ireland, some to this
place, and some to that place, where they all knew themselves to be in
security; but God will never suffer the poor and innocent to perish, for after
they had been a while away, they with unanimity wrote to the King for a pardon,
showing the cause that they did this deed, because they had not their Pay, and
that iron-bound rogue would not give a Soldier a cup of drink, if he should
come and crave it at his gate: when our King had understood how the cause
stood, and that it was (as it were) but equity to do as they had done, desired
the Parliaments consent, and so pardoned them all; now they came powdring back
again, when they heard how graciously our King had dealt with them, and this
Knowles with old Tailours money has bought a place at Court, and lives most
gentilely; but those two poor plough-men they were enforced to stay in Prison
till Jail-delivery, and indeed I think that they had done well to have alloted
the two hundred pounds to those two poor men which found them, whereby they
have suffered all this wrong.

Thus have you heard the true relation of old Tailour, of his riches, how he
was robbed by Knowles and his company, how they fled, and how they were
pardoned, how two poor plough men were taken and apprehended for finding what
they had cast away, and (the more is pity) they lie in durance for it at this
time, and shall till a Jail-delivery, and in my foolish conceit, old Tailour
was served well enough, I pray God it may be a warning to all such griping
villainies. The Troopers they sped well, but I would not wish men to attempt the
like, least they fall short of their fortunes.

For if the Fates do once begin to frown,
They Will kick the stoutest, and the strongest down.
FINIS.
