Medicina Animae: Or, The LAMENTATION, And CONSOLATION of a Sinner.

Together with several Collections out of the Holy Scriptures.

By Joshua Mullard.

I said I will confess my sins unto the Lord, and so thou forgavest the
wickedness of my sin. Psa. 32.6. LONDON, Printed by Tho. Harper, 1652.

To the Reader.
GEntle Reader, I began some part of this Penitential Meditation long since,
when it pleased Almighty God to give me a sight of my sins, and grace to hate
and forsake them. It may seem strange that I should make a public confession
of them, when they are only known to Almighty God and my self. But I find
David confessing his Adultery, and Manasses his Idolatry, and S. Paul
confessing himself to be the greatest of sinners; and also I find that
whosoever confesses his sins and forsakes them, shall find mercy: I must
confess I did not intend to publish them, but that I was pressed by many of my
friends to it, but more especially when I had read the judgment pronounced
against the unprofitable servant that hid his Talent, Matthew. 25.30. I thought
it more safety to show my imperfections to men, then to disobey my Redeemer,
and to lose my Talent. I desire thee, Reader, to read it all over before thou
censure, and to pardon the imperfections thou meetst with.

CHAP. I.
O Who shall give water to my head and a fountain of tears to my eyes, that I
may be able to bewail the losses of my soul with grief agreeable thereunto?
for there is a manifest and great cause of sorrow, when with the sight of my
mind I do behold my ancient days, and my youthful years: in this Meditation
my spirit has failed me; for I know what I was, nay rather what I should have
been, and understand what I am, and fear what I shall be.

And the less I sorrow, so much more do I fear: I would to God I sorrowed
more, that I might fear less.

But woe to me, O Lord, for now a long time thou smitest, and yet I sorrow not:
Thou call me, and yet I hear not: thou knockest, and yet I open not the
bar of my hard heart unto thee.

The sorrows of Death compassed me round about; and being filled with many
sorrows without, I feel inwardly no sorrow that may work unto salvation: and
I feel not only sorrows of old age, but I am a man of sorrow from my youth
upward; and all my days are full of travel and grief, and yet I sorrow,
because that always sorrowing, I cannot sorrow as I ought to sorrow.

O mavelous and unspeakable wisdom of the heavenly Physician! O wonderful
goodness of the most merciful God! O singular benefit of him that is the
Giver of all good things! for thou, O Lord, give unto me sorrow, lest I
should parish in pleasures, and that I may learn to rejoice without offense,
thou give me sorrow for a time, that I may not suffer everlasting pain: thou
afflictest my body, that thou may save my soul.

Thou scourgest, that thou may heal; thou killest, that thou may quicken.

But alas! how unwillingly do I receive thy salve out of the secret hand of
thy mercy? and being ignorant, do not acknowledge the sovereigne medicine of
healthful sorrow, wherein thou art mercifully severe against me: and how do I
acknowledge it, if earnestly I desire to be delivered from sorrow, who without
sorrow cannot be healed? for how can he be healed without sorrow, who by
delight is made sick?

Therefore, O Lord, make me to sorrow, and teach me a saving sorrow, that my
grief may be turned into joy, and that I may rejoice in thy salvation.

CHAP. II.
Days pass away, and years slide away; but I unhappy man, after so many
corruptions of my soul, after so most grievous and long follies, do not yet
repent, nor am not afflicted for my sins; but continue the often falling into
them again, and care not for rising, from heaping new unto old, and greater
unto less.

What shall I do, O Lord, or whither shall I go, when my last time shall
come? where shall I be hidden from thy wrathful countenance? or whither shall
I fly away from thy face, when thou shall call me unto judgment, and require
of me an account, of the talent bestowd upon me? what shall I answer unto thee?
or how shall I excuse my negligence, when thou shall sit upon thy throne of
Majesty, and command me to give an account of my stewardship to the uttermost
farthing? Surely I have nothing to say, but Lord I beseech thee to answer for
me: for who am I that I should answer to thee in judgment? but if thou compel
me to answer, I will say as a man confounded, trembling, and fearing; O Lord, I
have gained nothing thereupon, but have wickedly and vainly misspent and
consumed thy talent by my base living; I should better have said by dying; but
then I thought I lived, but I was dead, because I lived without thee my true
life; yea the life of a wicked man may rather be called death then life. I may
say I sooner began to die then live; first I did not understand what life was,
when I had forsaken the life of lives, and fountain of life. And malice did
supplant my young age in manifold wickednesses. I was scarce come out of my
mothers womb, but I was already a sinner: coming into the world, being yet
ignorant of sin, I did bewail the sins wherein my parents begot me:
neither did I altogether leave bewailing others sins, when I committed my
own, which I knew, and did not bewail. Being an Infant, I followed iniquity,
and spent my childhood wherein I should have been pure, impurely. There
breathed slimy vapors from the sinful corruptions of my flesh, and the spring
of my youth did shadow my heart, that it could not discern light from
darkness, and the clearness of the mind, from the mist of lust; and
traiterous and crafty pleasures, did carry my weak and forgetful loose age
into the headlong rock of lust, so as I boiled up in wicked desires to be
satisfied in Hell.

From my childhoode I grew to growing years, neither was I sooner growing
toward youth, then my wickedness did grow ripe, and I was bold to grow wild
in diverse inordinate lusts, by the which being drawn, by the grief of
wickedness, I was drowned to death, and destruction: the evil and wicked
days of my growing years passed on, and I grew toward youth, but I returned
backwards in filthiness and vanity: And as I was elder, I was a young man, and
came to be a man; but Vice always flourished in me instead of Virtue: I waxed
old and gray, and did not walk in thy ways, but as a child, being now an Old
man, I lived childishly.

Where then at any time have I bin innocent, that I should be judged of thee
according to the time of my innocence, though thou did appoint it me unto
judgment? for thou art just, O Lord, and righteous in all thy judgments; for
thou rendrest to every one according to his works: and I fear all mine,
because they are the works of darkness: And I have been a worker of iniquity
from the beginning and have always willingly followed the works and paths of
unrighteousness; I have wallowed in sin, as the Swine in filthiness, and as the
Prodigal was fed with Husks, so was I delighted with filthy and evil words,
and grieved with earnest, and profitable sayings; I did communicate with those
that wrought iniquity, and did banquet with the chief of them, and did glory in
sin.

Being mighty in iniquity, I loved to excuse, and could not accuse my self,
and made heavy my heart; and the more incurable is my sin, for that I did not
think my self to be a sinner: Neither did I not only seek a medicine for my
soul which was sick unto death, but refused it being offered, yea, with an
unreverent and untamed mind was wroth against them that would minister it unto
me; I despised them that reproved me, and embraced them that spoke pleasing
unto me, and delighted in their speeches that had not their hearts right unto
me: I studied devices, and lies in all things, and loved rather darkness then
light: Behold, O Lord, I have delivered my self unto thee; this is the course
of my life, wherein I have deserved thy wrath; this will I answer unto thee,
when thou shall ask of me: But do not remember the offenses of my youth, nor my
ignorances, O Lord, and enter not into judgment with thy servant, for no
living creature shall be justified in thy sight; but if thou will enter,
because thou art a God that loves judgment, do judgment unto me, but not
justice; and judge me according to the judgment of those that love thy name,
that I may sing unto thee mercy and judgment.

Remember, O Lord, that though I am wicked, yet I am thy servant, and the son
of thy handmaid; and do not look into the multitude of my sins, but unto the
greatness of thy mercies, and when thou shall be angry with me for my
wickedness, remember thy mercy, and be not angry with me for ever; but have
mercy upon thy afflicted servant, that my soul may praise thee, and confess
thy mercifulness.

CHAP. III.
VVOE unto me, wretched man, because I have made my Redeemer angry with me,
and I have rebelliously neglected his Law, and I have willingly forsaken the
right way; and as a sheep that refuses the shepherd, I have been carried far
and wide round about, through dry unwatered places, wandering in the wilderness
of wickedness, and not in the right way. I have gone to all rough and
unaccessible places, and every where was anguish and tribulation: I have been
wearied in the way of iniquity and perdition, and have walked in hard ways,
seeking rest, and finding none; because I did not seek thee, O Lord, but was in
a barren land, in the country of Death, where is no rest, but continual labor
and affliction of spirit dwells there. I dwelt in anguish with pleasures, and
amongst thorns did I make my bed, and sleep in death, and hoped for rest in
torments: now therefore what shall I do, whither shall I turn my self in these
great dangers? All the hopes of my youth are fallen down, and I am like one that
suffers shipwreck, who having lost all his wealth, swimmeth away naked, being
tossed with the wind and sea, and am driven far from the haven of happiness, and
do not take hold of the way of salvation, but am carried away on the left
hand: the enemy had placed nets for me which way soever I went, and snares for
my feet, and I despised them, and walked securely in slippery places, and
flattered my self in sins; I thought youth was not held by the laws of death,
and being deceived by this confidence, I followed the filthy desires of the
flesh, and gave the reins beyond the measure of sensuality, following it
wheresoever the force thereof did carry me; and said like a fool in my heart,
Wherefore do thou think of the end before the middle? thou have many days
yet remaining, and may be converted when thou listest: so waxed I old in
sin, and a most wicked custom was turned into nature: and now as a bondslave
to sin, I serve as it were chayned, and as a mad man haling his own flesh
seeks to hurt himself, all reason of deliberation being quenched, so I more
grievously and dangerously have hated my own soul; for the impenitency of my
heart, and obstinate wilfulness, has laid violent hands upon me, and has
distracted and disturbed my poor distressed soul: and so having brought unto
my self the horror of Hell every day more and more, according to the
hardness of my impenitent heart, I do heap up wrath against the day of wrath.
I have made trial sometimes to shake off the old yoke, but am not able,
because it cleaves to my bones. Oh that at length it may fall from my neck,
that I may love thee though late! It shall surely fall away, if thou command, O
Lord, and send me help from above. I confess I have not deserved it, but thou,
O most gracious giver, who make the Sun to rise indifferently upon the good,
as also upon the bad, and grantest temporal blessings to the unworthy, even
when they ask them not; how can thou deny spiritual things to those that
require them? have mercy upon me therefore, O Lord, and fulfill the desires of a
poor penitent sinner: thou that art rich in mercy, and wont cheerfully to
have mercy, and do purge the will from evil custom, and hear the
groanings of those that are bound, and loosest us from the bonds which we have
made to our selves, unless we refuse thy mercy: Give thy right hand unto the
work of thy hands, that when I fall I may not be bruised; and that I may not
be drawn into the deep pit of perdition: Deliver me from the mouth of the
cruel Lion that is ready for the prey, and gapeth for my soul that he may
devour it; for thou only art my protector, and my deliverer, and in thy mercy
is my hope; let thy mercy therefore be showed unto me, as I have trusted in
thee; Lord, in thee do I put my whole trust and confidence, Lord let me never
be confounded.

CHAP. IV.
MY nights pass away in grief, and vex me with innumerable terrors: my
Conscience shakes me while I am awake, and I am tormented therewith as if I
were wounded with a two edged sword; my sleep is troubled with diverse
illusions, bringing me no rest, but travel; I watch all night in my thoughts,
and when (as being wearied) I do endeavor to give some sleep to my eyelids,
by and by sleep departs from my eyes, and when I sleep, I sleep always in
sorrow, being wakened with an unquiet weariness from the Care of the day, and
all my inward parts are inflamed without rest: the meat which before I desired,
is made abominable to my soul, and my drink is mingled with tears, and
confusion is before my eyes, and redness in my cheeks, when I remember how
grievously I have offended thee, O my God, and in how many thoughts, deeds, and
desires I have abused my strength, and thy gifts I have spent in vanity:
Everlasting cares have consumed me, and being carried hither and thither with
senseless cogitations I have spent my time: I feigned to my self dreams
sometimes, and rejoiced, and vanished away being deluded in vanities and
madness. To conclude, I lived in all kind of pleasure in the world, being
banished far from the delights of thy house; and if at any time the fear of
death and the last judgment did quicken my sloth, and for a little time call
me from the deep gulf of pleasures, by and by I returned as a dog to his
vomit, being dead in them, I yet live, and abiding in death, I hasten to death,
and see death swift by coming to me: But let thy mercy quickly prevent me,
before the terrible day of misery and calamity do come, the great and bitter
day, that though I die, I may live, and declare thy mercies above all thy
works: Look back, Lord, and behold how my soul lies in her concupiscence,
sick of the Palsy, and is evil vexed therewith; deliver it from death, that
it may cleave to thee alone who art only the true life, and leaving all others,
follow thee that art above all: say unto my soul, O Lord God of my salvation,
be it unto thee as thou desire; make me to hear this thy voice a voice of
rejoicing, and salvation, that I may run after thee, and take hold of thee, and
not let thee go until thou sendest me whole away; for (being sick) to whom
should I go but to thee, that I may be cured? or who can heal my infirmities
but he, that for me, and mankind, came down from Heaven, that they may be
healed of their griefs? who can quicken but he that can mortify, and quicken
all things? who can save, but thou O my God and Savior? save me therefore,
and quicken me, thou that art the life, and salvation everlasting, of all that
put their trust in thee; and to thee that art without beginning, be glory
without end: To thee be Praise and Honor, to thee be continual Worship, and
thanksgiving; thou art the everlasting Spring of mercy, for I was gone far from
thee, and did run away, and yet thou do speedily come to him that is sick,
and does run away, when he does call upon thee, and do grant his health
before thou hear his sighs; for to be willing to be healed is enough that
thou should heal, and to be willing to live, that thou should grant
life; and in the blessings of thy sweetness do prevent the desires of a
sinner that does know himself; therefore I will say unto thee, I know my
iniquity, and what it is to know, because all my bones are vexed within me, and
my soul is very much troubled for my sin.

Behold! I lay all my iniquities before thy sight, O my God, that thou might
heal and cure my soul, because it has sinned against thee: for thou art a
God that desire not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be
converted and live; for the dead shall not praise thee, O Lord, but we that
live do bless thee, O Lord, and do confess that thy mercy is everlasting,
and thy compassions never fail.

CHAP. V.
I Have revealed my miseries to thee, O Lord, not to make known my ways unto
thee, that did not know them all from the beginning, and have numbered all my
steps; for thou know the hidden places of darkness, and all things are
naked open to thy eye; and thou do not only see, but discern the lurking
places of our thoughts, and the marrow of our affections: but I uncover, that
thou may cover and protect: I reveal, that thou may hide and give me an
humble and contrite spirit, and by the offering of this sacrifice, which is
most acceptable unto thee, be merciful unto me, and forgive me my sins. I have
spoken many and great things, and yet said little; for the worm of my
conscience does prick me in more: I would to God it might draw away the
rottenness, that by grieving it might consume it, and withal be it self
consumed: but woe is me, for when I think I have made an end of telling my
evils, then am I constrained, as it were, to begin again, and my memory being
full of uncleanesse, does abundantly remember much more filthin^sse; for I
have sinned above the number of the sands of the seas; and if I had a hundred
tongues, and a hundred mouths, I shall scarce answer one of a thousand
thousand; yet that increases all my grief, that I cannot remember all my
filthiness past, and the fleshly corruptions of my soul; for while I forget
new sins I forget the old, but those that I remember I will not hide, not that
I will love them again more, but that I may love thee more earnestly, O my God,
and that I remembering my wicked ways in the bitterness of my remembrance, thou
may be sweet unto me by the pardon of them: But I have not purged the old,
but rather from them did spring up many new sins, for the which I am as it
were cast out from before thy face, O my God; and being deprived of the comfort
of thy presence, I fall almost into desperation, knowing not whither I go; and
who will look upon my face, if thou turn away from me, and as a Reprobate
deprive me of thy sight, I shall undoubtedly become hateful unto all men, and
as a wanderer, and a runnagate in the Land, I shall be made a slave unto them,
when they shall ask of me, where is thy God? and wherefore has he put thee
from him? what shall I do therefore, O wretched man that I am? or what shall I
say when I see my self estranged from thy protection, and forsaken in the midst
of my enemies that fight mightily against me? I will seek thy face, O Lord, and
with sighs and tears beseech thee not to leave me, nor in anger to depart
from thy servant; for all mine enemies follow me as a fugitive to destroy my
soul: and therefore I must seek refuge at thy hands to whom I fly, O my God,
my strength, my health, my refuge, in the day of tribulation: for as there is
no God besides thee, so there is no Savior besides thee. Thou therefore, O
Lord, that know all my miseries, and from whom the works of my weakness
are not hidden, cast behind thy back all my offenses, and do not remember all
my old iniquities, but save me according to thy mercy from all those that
persecute me, and deliver me because there is none can redeem me and save me,
but thou, O Lord, who savest all that trust in thee, and deliverest the poor
from the mighty, and from the hands of them that are stronger then he. Hide not
therefore thy face from me, O Lord, neither despise me, my saving God, my
strength, and my deliverer; for I am poor and in misery, and thine eyes look
upon the poor: and if thy justice seek me, hide me in the bosom of thy
mercy, wherein thou have with long suffering been with me, and invited me to
repentance; for thou art long suffering, and very patient, and exceeding
merciful above all my wickedness; yea nothing is more proper to thee, O Lord,
then to spare, and therefore thou have mercy upon all, and drawest the sons
of men to repentance, because thou can do all, and thou sparest all, because
they are thine, O Lord, thou love souls; turn me therefore unto thee, and
deliver my poor afflicted soul from danger, that my mouth may be filled with
thy praise, and say unto thee, Blessed be thou, O Lord, who have not suffered
me to be delivered into the hands of my adversaries; except thou, O Lord, had
been my Helper, they had swallowed me up quick: my soul as a sparrow was
delivered from the snare of the Fowler; the snare is broken, and I am delivered.

CHAP. VI.
O Wretched man that I am! what shall do? for the great wild Beast has almost
devoured my soul, and I have been made a prey to the enemy: he has spoiled me
of all those goods wherewith thou, O Lord, have beautified me, and I am afraid
to appear before thee; I departed rich and beautiful from thy face, and went
wandering after filthiness in a corrupt way, and in the wickedness of my heart
my soul is made black, and the excellent color thereof is changed, and I have
so impoverished and deformed my self by wearing the foul garment of sin,
(according to the likeness of Adams offense) as thou O Lord, wilt not know me,
according to the image wherein thou have created me, and wilt not suffer me
(as a scab'd sheep) to dwell among the sheep of thy pasture: How then shall I
presume to return to the presence of thy Divine Majesty, in whose sight the
Heavens are not clean, but empty, vile, and unclean? or how shall I presume to
communicate amongst thy chosen people, being made foolish by offending: I
desire to return unto thee, though ashamed, and afraid, trusting to thy mercy,
for thou art a sweet Father to thy Son that did travel into a far Country;
be more sweet to him when he returns from a long pilgrimage: O my God, I want
power to come to thee, for I am kept fast bound by a most cruel robber, not
with strong iron, but with iron of my own will, whereof the enemy has made a
chain for me, and brings my heart into sorrow, slavery, and bitterness: my
refuge is far from me, for salvation is far from sinners, and I am compelled
to die in most miserable bondage, unless thou, O Lord, looking down from
Heaven, do help me: I stick fast in the slimy filth of the earth, and a
tempest of temptations, even like the wavs of the cruel sea, has overwhelmed
me, and almost drowned me, so that I am in despair of avoiding these eminent
dangers, unless thou, O Lord, shall take me up; for the more I endeavor to
rise, the more I am bruised; I am both within and without troublesome to my
self, and every where I do find domestic enemies that do beat me down; I
look on the right hand, and on the left, and see none to whom I may commit my
self in safety, but every where fear does shake me, and to whomsoever I come,
I find not a faithful friend; and how should I find any, when my self do not
keep my faith given to my God? I have sought means to comfort me in my
afflictions, and calamities, and there was none of my dear friends that would
comfort me, but I met with friends that were full of words, nay dumb rather,
and therefore dumb, O my God, because thy word did not sound from their lips,
who did condemn my wants without Compassion, and did falsely provoke strife
against me: I have often consented to foolish deceivers, and swerving from the
right Path, I ignorant agreed to their opinions, and by little and little was
brought to such toys, and madness, as though by the help of thy Grace, I
never departed from thy true Religion, yet I did believe in many fables, which
makes me unexcusable; for that when I knew thee to be always a God in truth,
I did not worship thee in spirit, and in truth, but changed this truth into
lies, and served the creature, rather then the Creator, and sought my self,
and my pleasures in corruptible things: But thou, O Lord, and my Savior,
proceed on, and as thou have made me by true faith to acknowledge thee, awaken
me up from the sleep of sin, that I never sleep unto death: lighten, kindle,
and lift up my heart unto thee, that in thy light I may behold the everlasting
light, the unquenchable light that never fails, the sweet and delightful
light, that I may see, and rejoice, and covet that light, and to know, that
nothing is to be loved besides thee, but in thee, and for thee: Thou, O Lord,
art the true light that do illuminate all men coming unto thee; cause this
light to rise in my darkness, and make me to desire to see thy salvation, that
my soul being melted away with the force of love, may attain to thy saving
health, and thirst after thy delights: My soul I say, but let me not call it
thine, because thou did make it, and give i^ unto me, and mine because I
receiced it from thee: keep therefore thy creature, which thou have especially
framed according to thine own Image, and suffer not thy precious gift which
thou have purchased with thy most precious blood to perish; but upon my body
and members work what it pleases thee; let my flesh be clothed with
rottenness, and my bones consumed with worms; but I beseech thee, O Lord,
only to spare my soul, and stretch not out thy hand against it, but bring me
back again into the way, before the going down of the Sun, for it grows
toward the evening of my age, wherefore compel me to come unto thee, if to
call be too little; compel me as it pleases thee, so I may come, and not
perish; not for my self, who have so often abused thy mercy, and made my self
unworthy thereof, but for thy holy name sake, take from me a stony heart, and
give unto me a heart of flesh, and place thy spirit in the midst of me, that I
may walk in thy Precepts, and keep thy Judgments: I come too late unto thee,
O Lord, I confess, I would to God I had come sooner; but I know, and am
assured that thou prescribest no time to those that come, so they come at last,
and thou receivest the last as gently as thou do the first: for although thou
hate sin, yet thou hate not the sinner; neither do thou rejoice in his
destruction: therefore though he tarry long before his conversion, yet thou
do patiently look for him: O how sweet and pleasant is that saying wherewith
thou have given hope and comfort to my soul! thou have played the harlot with
many lovers, yet return thou unto me and I will receive thee: How delightful
and pleasant is that word wherewith thou comfortest sinners that are in
despair of themselves I if a sinner repent him for all his sins, he shall
live and not die; for the death of a sinner is not thy will, for with great joy
I hear thee, when thou say that the sheep that had gone astray, shall be
brought home upon the Shepherds shoulders, and that the groat shall be laid up
in the treasures; the neighbors rejoicing with the woman that found it, and
the joy of the solemnity of that house did force tears from me, when I read of
the younger son that was dead, and lived again: Therefore give, O Lord, unto
my soul the voice of thy virtue; and not of thy virtue alone which shakes off
the sleep of souls; but also the beams of thy light which does show to men
their sins, but gives light also to the hidden places of darkness: Let thy
voice sound in the years of my heart, and say unto my sleeping soul, why art
thou so long oppressed with a deadly sleep, and kept in Captive bonds? It is
now time that thou forsake thy sins, and to return to thy Maker that Redeemed
thee: Return, O thou Shunamite, return, that I may behold thee to return, and
defer no longer to come to me; for I am the Lord thy God that calls thee; I
am he that blotteth out thine iniquities for my self, neither carry in
remembrance things past: Then will I say boldly to my soul, turn thee to thy
rest for the Lord has done well unto thee; go safely unto him, and though thou
be weary in thy wicked ways, go on the swifter in the ways of goodness, that
thou may the sooner take rest; be not made afraid for thy sins, for if they
be as red as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow; as a Cloud they
shall be put away; and fear not to be accused of boldness, where thou art
praised for obedience: Go, and make have, O my soul unto him that came not to
call the righteous but sinners; and if thou art a sinner, thy God is the God of
sinners, wherefore do thou fear to go, thou that art not called of a cruel
Judge, but by the Father of mercy, that thou may obtain mercy: therefore go
now willingly, being called to mercy, that thou be not hereafter compelled to
go unto judgment. In thee, O Lord, do I trust, wherefore I will not be ashamed
to confess unto thee my deformities, and blasphemies, who was not ashamed to
confess them before men, and to bark against thee: Let the Pharisees murmr
and say, who can forgive sins but God alone? for it is God that speaks unto
me, and to whosoever that puts his trust in him; he that calls me is
mild, and pitiful, and in his wrath remembers mercy; and therefore upon thy
words will I assuredly come unto thee, O my God, my trust and my portion, in the
Land of the living; I will come and fall down before thee, and not fear thy
Majesty, because thou call me, and that I offend not thine eyes, when I
shall appear unclean in thy sight, I will wash away my filthiness with
continual tears, and my ey-lids shall not rest from weeping, but my bed shall be
privy to my sorrow, wherein I hope to please thee, though I displease my self,
and being by thee converted unto thee, I repent me of those things that I have
committed against thee, that I may praise thee with a clear heart, saying, O
Lord, who is like unto thee? for then is thy praise seemly in the mouth of a
Sinner, and he that has sowed in tears, shall reap in gladness.

CHAP. VII.
HAve mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble, and vexed with unspeakable
miseries; for floods of iniquity do vex me, and the waters have entered into
my soul, as a River that is overflown: for my sins which I have hitherto
dissembled, and much neglected to confess and amend, are grown so high that
they have passed over my head, and bowed my mind and will to the concupiscence
of sensual desires, yea made me subject to the slavery of the Devil: Woe be
unto me, for I am mortally wounded, and there is no health in me, from the
crown of my head, to the sole of my foot: for my enemy has supplanted me, and
as a most cruel tyrant tormented me, and has deprived me of all my senses,
leaving only my understanding, thereby joining the knowledge of my hurt and
loss, that he might also increase my sorrows: he had done little hurt if
he had deprived me of the use of all my senses, and had made me utterly
senseless in all my actions; but he has deprived me thereof for doing that
which is good, and has violently enforced me unto evil, and has so infected
my mind which is altogether bent toward things with a certain astonishment
of inward senselessness, that she cannot feel her inward hurts: for when I
should have heard, I was deaf, and turned my ears from the truth, when it had
been fitter for me to stop my ears from hearing unprofitable things, and the
toys of many men, I was swift to hear and a gentle hearer: Heavenly things I
tasted unsavory, and my soul loathed all spiritual meats, but I judged
earthly things sweeter then honey, or the honey comb: I was blind and an
earthly man in beholding those things that were good, but worldly things I
looked on with a proud eye, and desired them with an unsatiable heart: neither
in my senses alone, but my members also which God gave me for the service of my
soul, did the ancient enemy shut up from me the way of salvation, and
prepared such cruel ambushes against me in this cruel siedge, as I was never
able to avoyde them, and as often as I tried to fly away, I fell into his
hands: for I did offend both by seeing and refusing to see, by hearing and by
being deaf, by speaking and holding my peace; to conclude, I changed all the
peculiar and common use of my senses, and members, into a filthy abuse, burning
in my unclean desires, for that I have transgressed all the Laws both of God
and man, and Nature, and have lived diligently only observing the laws of
sin. I would to God I had been only so, and now were not, but alas! because I
am the same that before I was, and nothing changed from that, I followed the
worst, for my sick will does yet bear rule, and my most soul and stinking
soul that is filled every where with horrible sores that does proceed only
from it self, does still persevere in the old evils. I am often angry with
my self, because I am weary to live, when I am not weary to sin; I know my
folly, and am confounded, and being confounded I reproove my self saying; O
carnal lover, why do thou so long walk in the mire of concupisence? why
art thou so carefully busy for earthly things, and do so earnestly desire
those goods that shall perish? or by what reason call thou them goods which
thou gainest with so much labor, and the great hurt of thy soul, and being
gained possessest in fear, and being possessed losest with grief and sorrow?
O my soul! why do thou forget thy own proper estate and nobility, and art
not ashamed to endure a miserable and shameful bondage under the corruption of
thy corporal sense? why art thou deceived with the unfaithful promises of the
world? the chiefest good whereof is a mist, or vapor, that appears but a
little season, and vanishes as vanity of vanities: Blush, and be ashamed, O
miserable sinner; how often have thou departed from thy Creator, and turned to
deceitful creatures? and coming again to thy self, behold with the sight of
thy mind, how cruelly thy soul has bowelled her self of her own bowels,
whilst with an inordinate desire catching at a vile prize of Flies, she has
like the Spider made nets for her own self, of her own bowels: again, and
again, I say, blush at that where thou have had no fruit, and lament thy lost
time, and yield thy soul unto God: with these speeches I rail against my
self, when being inwardly admonished, I enter into my self, and consider with
my heart, what I have lost, and what I have found: and I find that I do not
that good which I like, but the evil that I will that I do; for my Enemies
hold my will and do keep me, (being fashioned according to the former desires
of ignorance) captive under the law of sin: but thou, O Lord of virtues, and
the tower of my strength, do not withdraw thy help from me; look, Lord, unto
my defense, and protect me under thy wings, left I fall in the sight of my
adversaries, and my enemies rejoicing against me say, I have prevayled against
him: Break the bonds of my reproach under which I have been made crooked; and
loose the cords of my sins wherewith I am strongly bound, O most mighty Lord,
and make known thy power to thy enemies, that I may offer unto thee a
sacrifice of gladness, saying, who shall speak to the power of the Lord, or
what shall declare his praises, that delivers my soul from death, and my
feet from sliding? who has saved me from the Lions mouth, and from the
devouring Dragon. To whom shall I fly but to thee, O Lord, upon whom all our
Fathers have called, and have been saved? to thee I say, who never deceivest
them that trust in thee, and let any man's hand be against me, for I will fear
no evil, because thou art with me: O Lord, all my desires are before thee,
blot out, and put away whatsoever is displeasing unto thee; renew, create, and
confirm whatsoever thou have given me; that casting away all carnal and
unprofitable desires, the sinner may be accepted in the desires of his heart,
and coveting to enjoy thee the only treasure, my request may come before thy
face, and I may be confident to say unto thee, Grant unto me, O God, the
desire of my soul; for I know, and am assured, that no man can desire thee but
by thy self, nor come to thee unless thou draw him: draw me therefore, O Lord,
and grant unto me that I may begin in a good desire, that I may end and
perfect it in a good work, before my old custom oppress my new desires, and
my former will strengthened by age, conquer my new will: cloth me therefore, O
Lord, I humbly beseech thee, in the precious garment of thy salvation, and put
off the vile clothing of my wicked life, wherein being deprived of thee, I
walk according to the ancient conversation of the old man, but being newly
clothed in thee, and become a new man, I may with a new spirit serve thee in a
new life, and in the sweet smell of thy ointments running unto thee I may
rejoice in Jesus my Savior.

CHAP. VIII.
O Lord Jesus Christ, the son of the living God, who with thy hands stretched
forth on the Cross, have drunk the cup of thy Passion for the redemption of
all mankind, succor me this day, I beseech thee; behold, O Lord, I that am
needy, do come to thee that art wealthy: I that am full of misery do approach
to thee replenished with mercy; suffer me not therefore to depart void, or as
one worthy to be despised; I begin hungry, let me not end empty, I approach as
one hunger starved, let me nor depart unfed, and if I sigh before I eat, grant
that I may eat at least after I have sighed; first therefore, O blessed
Savior, I confess against my self mine iniquity; behold, O Lord, for that I
was conceived and born in sin, and thou have washed and sanctified me from
the same, and I after this have defiled my self with greater offenses, because
those sins wherein I was borne, were of necessity; but those in which I
afterward lay wallowing were voluntary: this notwithstanding, thou not being
unmindfull of thy mercy and goodness, have drawn me from wickedness, and from
the fellowship of sinners, inspiring me with thy grace to follow thee in the
company of those that seek thy face, who walk the direct way that leads to
felicity: but I ungrateful and forgetful of so many benefits received, have
after my entrance into a Religious way, committed many sins and abominations,
and where I ought to have amended my faults, and to have repented for them, in
stead thereof I have added sin upon sin: these, O Lord, are the faults by which
I have dishonored thee, and defiled my self; to wit, Pride, Presumption,
Vainglory, and Hypocrisy, and many other sins almost infinite, by which my
unhappy soul is troubled and afflicted, rent, and destroyed: Behold, O Lord,
mine iniquities have overwhelmed my head, being unto me a grievous burden
unsupportable to be endured, insomuch as if thou (whose property is to pardon
and to show mercy) do not lift me up with the right hand of thy mercy, I
shall woefully sink down into the gulf of eternal misery: behold, O Lord God,
and see how my ghostly enemy does insult over me, saying, God has forsaken
him; I will pursue and take him, because there is none that can deliver him:
how long, O Lord, will thou thus leave me? turn back, and deliver my soul, O
save me for thy mercy sake: take pity of me thy son whom thou have begotten in
the great grief of thy passion, and do not so look to my wickedness, that
thou forget thy goodness: what Father is there that seeing his son in danger,
does not endeavor to set him free? or what son is there whom his Father does
refuse to correct with the staff of his pity? wherefore, O Lord, and Father,
albeit I am a sinner, yet I do not cease to be thy Son, because thou have made
me, and new made me again; like as I have sinned, so correct me and amend me,
commit me to the care and custody of thy only begotten Son Jesus Christ our
Lord: Is it possible for a woman to forget the child of her own womb? and
albeit she should forget it, yet thou, O most merciful Father, have promised
not to forget the same: Behold I cry, and thou do not hear me; I am
afflicted with grief, and thou do not comfort me; what shall I do or say,
being in this extreme misery? alas, I am altogether comfortless, and which is
worse, am chased from thy presence: wretch that I am, from how great good into
how great evil am I fallen? whither did I attempt to go? and whither am I
come? where am I? and where am I not? how is it that I that did sigh after
Heaven, do now sigh through so great tribulation? I have sought comfort, and
have found affliction, and truly it is better for me not to be, then to be
without thee, O sweet Savior, It is better not to live, then to live without
thee, the only true life; where are now, O Lord Jesu, thine accustomed
mercies? will thou be displeased with me always? be appeased, I beseech thee,
and take pity of me, and turn not away thy loving face from me, who to
redeem me, have not turned away thy face from those that did mock, and spit
upon thee: I confess that I have sinned, and my conscience does adjudge me
worthy of damnation, neither is my repentance sufficient to make satisfaction,
nevertheless it is a thing infallible, that thy mercy does surmount all
offenses whatsoever, be it never so abominable: wherefore, O most merciful
Lord, I beseech thee enter not into judgment with thy servant, but according
to the multitude of thy mercies blot out mine iniquities: woe be to me at the
day of judgment, when the Books of our Consciences shall be opened, wherein
our actions are registered, when of me it shall be openly proclaimed; see here
the man and his deeds committed; what shall I do, O Lord my God, at that
dreadful day when the Heavens shall reveal my iniquities, and the earth shall
bear witness against me? verily I shall be mute, and able to say nothing, but
holding down my head through shame and confusion, I shall stand before thee
shaking and blushing; alas! what shall I say? I will call and cry unto thee, O
Lord my God, why am I consumed being silent? nevertheless if I speak, my
grief will not cease; and if I hold, I shall inwardly be tormented with
unspeakable bitterness: weep, O my soul, and make lamentation, as a young
married woman for the death of her new married husband; weep, and bewail thy
misery for that thy Bridegroom (which is Christ) has forsaken thee: O anger
of the Almighty rush not upon me, because thou can not be contained in me;
verily there is nothing in me that is able to contain thee; take pity of me,
lest I despair of thy mercy, that by despairing of my self, I may find
comfort in thee; and albeit I have done that for which thou may justly
condemn me, yet thou have not lost thy accustomed property of showing mercy
and pity: thou, O Lord, do not desire the death of sinners, neither do
thou take pleasure in the perdition of those that die; nay rather that those
that were dead might live: Thou thy self have died, and thy death has been
the death of that death that was due to sinners: and if thou dying, they have
lived, grant, O Lord, I beseech thee, that thou living, I may not die; let thy
heavenly hand help me, and deliver me from the hands of those that hate me,
lest they insult and rejoice over me, saying, we have devoured him: How is it
possible, O blessed Savior, that ever any one can despair of thy mercy, who
when we were thy enemies have redeemed us with thy most precious blood, and
reconciled us to God? Behold, O Lord, (protected with the shadow of thy mercy)
I run (craving pardon) to the throne of thy glory, calling, and knocking until
thou take pity on me; for if thou have called as to pardon, even when we did
not seek it, by how much more shall we obtain pardon if we ask it? remember
not thy justice, O blessed Savior, toward me thy creature; remember not
thine anger toward me guilty, but be mindful of thy mercy toward me in
misery: forget my Pride, provoking thee to displeasure, and weigh my
wretchedness imploring thy favor; for what does thy sacred Name Jesus signify
but only a Savior? wherefore, O Savior Jesu, be thou my succor, and
protection, and say unto my soul, I am thy salvation: I do presume very much
of thy divine bounty, because thou thy self do teach us to ask, seek, and
knock at the door of thy mercy; wherefore I do ask, seek, and knock at thy
door, as by thy word thou have commanded me to do: thou therefore that
willest me to ask, grant that I may receive; thou that do bid me seek, grant
me likewise to find; thou that do teach me to knock, open unto me knocking
at the door of thy mercy: recover me being diseased, repair me being crazed,
raise me being dead; vouchsafe likewise so to direct and govern all my
senses, thoughts, and actions in that which is pleasing unto thee, that I may
from henceforth faithfully serve thee, and that I may live, and give my self
wholely unto thee: I know, O Lord, that by reason thou have made me, I do owe
my self unto thee; and by reason thou have redeemed me, and have been made man
for me, I do owe (if I had it to give thee) much more then my self unto thee,
by how much greater then me, thou art; who have given thy self for me: I have
nothing else to give thee; neither can I give thee this without thee: take me
therefore, and draw me unto thee, that I may be thine by immitation, and
affection, like as I am by condition, and creation.

CHAP. IX.
TAke pity, O Lord, take pity, O merciful Savior of me a most miserable
sinner, doing things worthy of blame, and worthily suffering for the same,
being by thee daily afflicted, for that continually I am found to offend: if I
ponder the evil which I daily commit, that which I endure is nothing in
comparison of it; that which I have done, being much more grievous then my
affliction: thou art just, O Lord, and right is thy judgment: all thy
judgments are just and true: thou, O Lord our God, art just and full of
goodness, neither is there in thee any wickedness: because when we do offend,
thou do not unjustly and cruelly afflict us, who when we were not, have
powerfully made us; and when for our sins we were guilty of damnation, thou
have by thy wonderful mercy and goodness, set us in a state of salvation: I
know, O Lord God, and am assured, that our life is not governed by the
unadvised Influence and concurrence of secondary causes, but is wholly disposed
and ordered by thy Almighty providence; wherefore I humbly pray and beseech
thee, that thou will not deal with me according to mine iniquities, by which I
have deserved thy anger, but according to thy manifold mercies, which surmount
the sins of the whole world, take pity on me: thou, O Lord, who do punish
me outwardly, give me always an invincible, patience inwardly, to the end I
may never cease to praise thee: take pity of me, O Lord, take pity of me, and
help me, like as thou know to be expedient for me both in soul and in
body, thou who know all things, and art able to do all things whatsoever it
pleases thee.

CHAP. X.
O God most powerful and potent over the spirits or souls of all flesh, whose
eyes behold all the ways of the children of Adam, from the day of their birth,
unto the day of their death; to the end thou may render to every man
according to his actions, be they good or evil: Teach me, I beseech thee, how
to confess unto thee my poverty, because I have heretofore vanted that I was
rich, and need nothing, not knowing that I was poor, blind, naked, wretched,
and in misery, for that I thought my self to be something, when I was
nothing; I said with my self, I shall become a wise man, and I became a fool;
I thought my self to be prudent and discreet, and I was deceived, for that I
now perceive that it is a gift gratis by thee given, without whom we can do
nothing; thus, O Lord, by leaving me, and proving me, thou have taught me to
know my self, not to respect of ti^e, that thou might know me, but in respect
of me, that I might know my self, because I thought my self to be something
of my self, and sufficient of my self; neither did I perceive that it was
thou that did govern me, until thou did for a while forsake me;
whereupon I forthwith fell, by which I did see and know, that it was thou that
did govern me, and that my fall happened through my own fault, and my ^ing to
grace, by means only of thy grace.

Thou have opened mine eyes, O divine light, thou have awakened and enlightened
me, so that now I see that man's life is a temptation upon earth; neither has
frail flesh, or any mortal man living, just occasion to glory of himself
before thee, or to presume of his justification, since all the good we have, be
it little or great, proceeds wholly and freely from thee; neither can we
attribute any thing justly to our selves, saving only our iniquity.

Whereof then shall any mortal man glory? shall he glory of his iniquity? this
is not glory, but mere misery: shall he therefore glory of his goodness?
shall he glory of that which is another? Because all goodness and glory is
thine, O Lord, and belongs unto thee; he therefore that usurpeth that glory to
himself that is due to thee, is a thief, and a robber, and like unto the
Devil, who desired to bereave thee of thy glory; for he that desires to be
praised in respect of the gift which thou have given him, and does not seek
thy glory therein, but his own, albeit in respect of thy gift he be praised
of men, yet by thee be is thought worthy of blame, for that with that gift
which thou have given him, he has not sought thy glory, but his own; but he
that is praised of men, being by thee thought worthy of blame, will not be
defended by men when thou shall condemn him.

Thou therefore, O Lord, who did form me in my mothers womb, permit me not
to fall into that reproachful infamy, as to be upbrayded as one that would
bereave thee of thy glory, who art the author of all goodness, and to thee is
due all glory, but to us shame and misery, who according to our deserts, are
worthy of all wretchedness, were it not that thou do take pity upon us: Thou,
O Lord, art pitiful indeed, full of compassion toward all men, and hating
nothing of those things which thou have made bestowing on us many benefits, and
enriching us with thy greatest gifts, because thou do favor those that are
friendless, making them abound with the riches of thy goodness.

I know, O Lord, and confess that they only that acknowledge themselves to be
poor and needy, and confess unto thee their poverty, shall be enriched by thee;
insomuch that they that imagine themselves rich (being indeed poor and needy)
are not to expect any spiritual gift or grace from thee: wherefore, O Lord my
God, I do acknowledge and confess unto thee my poverty, rendering unto thee all
glory, because all the good that is done by me, proceeds wholly from thee.

I confess, O Lord, that I am nothing else but mere vanity, the shadow of
death, a dark bottomless dungeon, a void and unprofitable plot of ground,
bringing forth nothing without thy blessing, the natural fruit thereof being
confusion, sin, and eternal death and damnation: all the good that ever I
had before, I had it from thee, is wholly thine, and proceeds from the hands of
thy liberality.

When I have stood upright, it has been by thy assistance; when I have
fallen, it has been through my own negligence: when I was fallen likewise, I
should for ever have remained in misery, if thou had not raised me: and being
blind, I should for ever have been blind, if thou had not enlightened me:
when I was fallen, I should never have risen, if thou had not with thy hand
raised me: yea after thou had raised me, I should have fallen immediately,
if thou had not upheld me; I should likewise have perished many times, and
been utterly undone, if thou had not governed me.

Thus, O Lord, and in this manner has thy grace and mercy prevented me from
time to time, and continually delivering me from all mishaps that might have
befallen me, preserving me from perils that are past, delivering me out of
those that are present, and strengthening me against those that are to come,
cutting in sunder before me the snares of sin, removing likewise all causes
and occasions of the same; for if thou had not afforded me this favor, I
should have committed all sorts of sins what soever: because I know, O Lord,
that there is no sin committed by one man, which another could not likewise
do the same, if man's Creator by whom he was made, do not assist him.

Thou therefore have caused, and commanded me to abstain from iniquity, giving
me grace that I might believe in thee: for thou, O Lord, did direct me to do
that which was to thy glory and my own salvation; giving me grace and
understanding, that I might avoyde many grievous sins that I was inclinable to.

CHAP. XI.
REmember, O Lord I beseech thee thy mercies showed toward me of old time,
through which thou have prevented me with the blessings of thy sweetness,
even from the beginnings for thou, O Lord, and my hope, from the very time that
I was a suckling, (yea before I was borne) have provided and prepared the ways
that I should walk in, and by them attain to the glory of thy heavenly
Kingdom: thou have known me before thou did form me in my mothers belly;
and before I issued out of my mothers womb, thou have preordained of me
whatsoever seemed good to thy divine pleasure.

I know not, O Lord, what things are written of me in thy Book, in the secret
of thy Consistory, which make me to fear exceedingly: but thou know them
all particularly, because that which I expect by succession of days and times,
a thousand years hence to be fulfilled, in the sight of thy Eternity is
already accomplished, and that which is to come is already done: but I, for
that I know not these things, (living here in a dark and obscure night) cannot
but fear and tremble, whilst I see sundry dangers on every side assaulting
me, troops of enemies pursuing me, and infinite miseries of this life
invironing me. And were it not that the aid of thy grace does succor me in
these my manifold tribulations, I should soon fall into desperation; but I have
a great hope and confidence, O my God in thee, who art a God of unspeakable
mercy and pity: and the consideration of thy infinite mercies are no small
comfort unto me in my miseries.

The former tokens likewise of thy love and mercies showed toward me before my
nativity, but appearing now especially, do put me in hope for the time to
come, to receive more ample and greater favors, from the hands of thy
bountiful liberality, which thou do reserve for thy friends, and those that
love thee to the end, that my hope may rejoice in thee, O Lord my God, with a
sacred and lively cheerfulness, with which thou do continually comfort my
old disconsolate years.

CHAP. XII.
O God of Gods! O Lord in mercy surmounting the malice of men; I know thou will
not always be silent: then I mean when a flaming fire shall burn before
thee, and a terrible tempest shall shower down round about thee, when thou
shall call both Heaven and earth to judge and discern thy people; and lo, in
the presence of so many millions of people, all mine iniquities shall be
revealed, before so many troops of Angels all my abominations shall be
displayed; not only of my actions, but likewise of my words, and cogitations;
there shall I (poor wretch) stand to be judged by so many as have gone before
me in doing good: I shall by so many accusers be thought worthy of Hell, as
have given me example to live well: I shall be convinced by so many witnesses,
as have admonished me by their wholesome speeches, and by their godly and pious
conversation, have carried themselves worthy of imitation: O my Lord! I know
not what to say, I know not what to answer: and albeit I am as yet free from
that terrible danger, nevertheless my conscience does afflict me, the hidden
secrets of my heart do torment me, coveteousnesse does press me, pride does
accuse me, envy does consume me, concupiscense does inflame me, lust does
molest me, gluttony does disgrace me, drunkenness does convince me, detraction
does rent me, anger does disturb me: behold, O my deliverer, who have
delivered me out of the hands of cruel people; behold with whom I have lived
from the day of my birth, with whom I have studied, and with whom I have kept
promise: those very studies which heertofore I affected, do condemn me,
which in times past I praised do now dispraise me. These are the friends to
whom I have assented; the teachers whom I have obeyed; the masters whom I have
served; the counselors whom I have believed, and the familiar acquaintance to
whom I have consented

Woe is me, O my God, for that my abode here is prolonged, woe is me, O my
light, for that I have lived with those that live in darkness: and seeing holy
David said so much, how much more may I be able to say? my soul has dwelt
too long in a strange land? O my God, my force and my fortress, no man can be
justified in thy sight, my hope is not in the sons of men. Whom would thou
find justified, if thou should judge severely, setting mercy aside? neither
is there any thing whereof a just man may vaunt, or which can bring him to
glory, unless thou prevent him before hand with thy mercy, and pity: I
therefore, O my Savior, believe what I have heard, that it is thy goodness
that does draw me to repentance, thy holy lips have told it me: No man can
come to me, unless my Father, who has sent me, draw him. Seeing therefore it
has pleased thee to instruct me, and by instruction have vouchsafed mercifully
to inform me; I beseech thee, with all the forces of my heart and mind, O
Almighty Father, together with thy most beloved Son, I beseech thee likewise, O
most blessed Savior, with the holy and blessed Spirit, vouchsafe to draw me
unto thee, that I may run after thee, and forsaking all things transitory, I
may only adhere unto thee, and devote my soul and body only to thy service.

Who is like unto thee, O Lord my God? thou art great in sanctity, terrible,
and worthy to be praised, doing things that deserve to be admired; too too late
have I known thee, O true light, too late have I known thee, and the cause
was, for that there was a great and dark cloud before my eyes, that delighted
in vanity, which hindered me from beholding the Sun of justice, and the Light
of all verity: I was wrapped in darkness, being the child of darkness, and I
loved darkness, because I knew not the light; I was blind and loved blindness,
and walked through one darkness into another: who has delivered me from thence,
where I remained as a blind man, sitting in darkness and in the shadow of
death? who has taken me by the hand, and led met forth of the same? who is he
that has thus enlightened me? I sought him not, and he called me: but who is
he? thou art he. O Lord my God, being most merciful, and pitiful, yea, the
father of mercies, and God of all comfort.

Thou, O Lord my God most holy, art he that has done the same, whom I confess
with my whole heart, rendering thanks to thy holy Name: I did not seek thee,
thou have sought me; I did not call upon thee, thou have called me.

Thou have thundered from Heaven with a great voice into the internal care of
my heart, saying, let light be made; and light was made: whereupon that great
and dark cloud, which had covered my eyes, departed, and was dissolved, whereby
I have seen thy light, and known thy voice, and I said, truly, O Lord, thou
art my God, who have delivered me out of darkness, and from the shadow of
death, calling me into the admirable light, so that now I see, thanks be to
thee, O Lord, who have enlightened me: and I looked back, and beheld the
darkness wherein I had lived, and the deep dark dungeon, wherein I had
remained, which made me with fear and trembling, to cry out, saying, woe is me
in respect of the darkness in which I have remained; woe is me in respect of
my former blindness, in which I could not see the light of Heaven; woe is me in
respect of my former ignorance, when I did not know thee, O Lord; thanks
therefore be to thee, O my Inlightner, and Deliverer, for that thou have
enlightened me, and I have known thee.

Too too late have I known thee, O ancient Verity, too late have I known thee,
O eternal Truth: thou remainest in light, and I in darkness, and I knew thee
not, because I could not be enlightened without thee, for that there is no light
besides thee.

O God! the Holy of Holies, the God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, of inestimable
Majesty, whose wonderful greatness cannot be uttered or imagined! before
whom the Angelical powers do shake for fear, O most mighty, most holy, and
most powerful God, the God of the spirits or souls of all mortal creatures,
from whose sight the Heavens and the earth do fly away for fear, to whom all
the Elemens do obey at a beck; let all thy creatures adore and glorify thee,
amongst whom I, unworthy wretch the son of thy handmaid do bow down the neck
of my heart under the feet of thy supreme Majesty being taught so to do, by
the faith which thou have given me, rendering thanks unto thee, for that thou
have vouchsafed by thy mercy to inlighten me.

O Light most true, sacred, and delightful, most worthy of praise, and most
admirable, which inlighteneth every man coming into this world, yea, the eyes
of the Angels themselves: Behold, now I see, for which I humbly thank thee:
Behold, now I see the light of Heaven, a heavenly bright beam proceeding from
the face of thy brightness does shine upon the eyes of my mind, which makes
all my bones to rejoice.

Oh that this light were perfect it me; increase it in me, O author o^ light
I beseech thee: increase I beseech thee that light that shines in me: let it
be augmented, I beseech thee, by thee.

O fire, which do always burn, and art never extinguished, inflame me. O
light, which do always shine, and art never darkened, enlighten me. Oh that
I were made hot by thee, O sacred fire! how sweetly do thou heat, how
secretly do thou shine, how desiredly do thou burn? Woe be to those, that
are not made hot by thee, woe be to those that are not enlightened by thee. O
true light enlightening all the world, whose brightness does replenish all the
world. Woe be to those blind eyes which do not see thee, who art the Sun
that gives light both to Heaven and Earth. Woe be to those dim eyes which
cannot see thee. Woe be to those eyes that are turned away from seeing verity.
Woe be to those eyes that are not turned away from seeing vanity.

Verily those eyes that are accustomed to darkness, cannot behold the bright
beams of thy supreme righteousness, neither do they know what to think of
the light, whose dwelling is in darkness. They see, love, and approve the
darkness, so that walking from one darkness into another, they stumble, and
tumble they know not whither. Doubtless they are wretched that know not what
they lose, but they are more wretched that know what they lose, who fall with
their eyes open, and descend alive into perdition.

O light most blessed! who can not be seen of those eyes that are never so
little defiled: Blessed are the clean in heart, for they shall see God. Cleanse
me, O cleansing virtue, cure mine eyes, to the end that with sound and clear
eyes I may be able to behold thee. Remoove from my eyes the scales of my
former blindness, by the means of thy brightness, that I may be able
steadfastly to behold thee, and in thy light I may see light.

Behold O my light! now I see, for which I most humbly thank thee. Let this my
light, O Lord I beseech thee, be increased by thee. Open mine eyes, that I may
see the wonderful things of thy Law. I give thee thanks, O my light, for that
I now see, albeit obscurely, as it were in a Mirror or looking glass: but
when shall I see thee apparently face to face?

Oh, when will that day of joy and mirth arive, in which I shall enter into the
place of thy Tabernacle, so match to be admired, even into the house of my God,
to the end I may see him face to face that sees me* that so my desire may be
accomplished.

CHAP. XIII.
I Have exceedingly sinned, and I know my offenses to be many, which I have
committed, yet I do not despair, because where sins have abounded, there
grace has superabounded. He that dispayreth of obtaining pardon for his
sins, denies God to be merciful; he does God a great injury that
mistrusteth his mercy: as much as in him lies, he denies God to have charity,
truth, and power, in which three does depend my whole confidence: that is, in
the charity of his adoption, in the truth of his promise, and in the power of
his redemption: I cannot be terrified with the multitude of my sins* if the
death of my Savior come into my mind, because my sins cannot overcome the
multitude of his mercy. The wounds of my Savior do tell me that I am truly
reconciled to him, if I love him: wherefore, blessed Savior, give me grace to
love thee truly and sincerely, because love chaseth forth fear: verily the
whole world does not afford such a powerful and present remedy against sin,
as is the death of my Redeemer. He stretches forth his arms on the Cross,
and spreads out his hands, as one ready to embrace sinners: I purpose to live,
and desire to die between the arms of Christ that has saved me, there will I
sing securely: I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou have received me, and have
not permitted mine enemies to triumph over me.

Who more can crave
Then God for me has done?
To free a slave
That gave his only Son.
Blessed be that hour
When he repaired my loss,
I never will
Forget my Saviors Cross:
Whose death revives
My soul; once was I dead,
But now I Will raise
Again my drooping head,
And singing say,
And saying sing for ever,
Blessed be my Lord
That did my soul deliver.

CHAP. XIV.
I Render unto the most humble thanks* O most gracious and merciful God, for
that coming loader with so many and so grievous sins to make my humble
confession unto thy divine and sacred Majesty, thou art pleased to give me the
grace, that I am not ashamed to open my sins and iniquities unto thee, whereby
I may obtain thy pardon; which being granted unto me by thy mercy, and the
merits of my Savior Christ Jesus; I most humbly beseech thee to indue me with
thy holy spirit, that I may forget all my wicked inclinations, and that I may
offend thee no more, but remain constant to my good intentions proposed at this
time: I confess unto thee, O Lord, that it was thy mere mercy and goodness,
that thou had not cut me off many times before this in the height of my
horrid sins, and cast me immediately into Hell for all eternity: O Lord, thou
have had mercy upon me, being but poor dust and ashes; and thou art pleased at
this instant to reform my deformities, and to keep me from sudden death and
despair, lest I should be swallowed up in the deep: O Lord, I humbly
confess, that before thou did give me a sight of my sins, and hearty
sorrow and repentance for them, I was going headlong to Hell, carrying all my
sins along with me; but thou, O my Lord and my God, did call me back unto
thee, who art the way, the truth and the life, and did inlighten my cloudy
mind with the brightness of thy light, that seeing my relf at the brink of
Hell, thou have pulled me back by thy divine mercy and providence, that I may
live to see thy glory: what shall I therefore render unto thee, my most
merciful Savior, for the mavelous ways that thou have used to correct, and
direct my ways into the way of salvation? I was carried away with vanities, O
my God, and made my ways far from thee; but thou, O Lord, moved with mercy
did call back my filthy life from the dirt of earthly pleasures, and did
restrain my untamed mind with the bit and bridle of the calamities, and
labor of this wretched world, that I might understand my own misery, and come
unto thee: I will therefore glory in my infirmities, and afflictions, that thy
grace may dwell in me, O Lord, to whom I owe all that I am, for that thou have
forgiven me many heinous, and grievous sins; and for those great benefits, and
most holy blessings by which my poor soul shall be saved, I do give unto
thee most humble thanks upon the knees of my heart, and in gratitude for thy
gracious favors, I do most willingly offer my poor life to be sacrificed for
thee, my liberty, and all my worldly substance, and my most humble prayers,
saying, Bless the Lord, O my soul, and do not forget all his benefits, who is
merciful to all thine iniquities, and heals all thine infirmities, who has
redeemed thy life from death, who crowns thee with loving kindnesses and
tender mercies: Behold, O Lord, how I am comforted with thy mercies, and thou
have so enlightened me, that I now desire to embrace thee before all the
pleasures which have waited upon my miserable life: therefore I humbly beseech
thee, O most merciful Father, not to fail in helping me, that I also by thy
grace may not fail in confessing thy mercy unto me; and I desire thee to
accept of my broken and contrite heart, and my sorrowful soul for my sins
past, and grant unto me thy fear, that I may never do any thing to displease
thee; but conceiving hope by thy promises of thy mercy, I may henceforth be
cherished, and delighted with heavenly things: O Lord, protect me under the
shadow of thy wings, and cherish me in the bosom of thy mercy; for while I
live in this valley of tears, I will cry unto thee, O my God, and my helper in
time of trouble, and need, that thou deliver me from all temptations unto the
end; and that thou will nourish me as thy child, who having received the
strength of thy virtue so long as I shall run in the course of this world,
forgetting that which is behind, and earnestly bending my self to thy holy
blessings, by thy grace and protection I may go on to the appointed place that
thou have prepared for those that love Christ Jesus our Lord, who lives and
reigns with thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit God world without end. Amen.

A Preparative to Prayer.
WHen to thy God thou speak,
O creature mean,
Lift up pure hands,
lay down all foul desires;
Fix thoughts on heaven,
present a conscience clean,
Such holy Balm
to mercies throne aspires;
Confess faults guilt,
crave pardon for thy sin:
Tread holy Paths,
call grace to guide therein.
It is the spirit,
with reverence must obey
Our Makers will,
to practice what he taught:
Make not the flesh
thy Council when thou pray,
It Is enemy
to every virtuous thought:
It is the foe
we daily feed and cloth;
It is the Prison
that the soul does loath,
Even as Elias
mounting to the sky,
Did cast his mantle
to the earth behind;
So when the heart,
presents the prayer on high,
Exclude the world
from traffic with the mind.
Lips near to God,
and ranging hearts within,
Is but vain babbling,
and converts to sin.
Like Abraham,
ascending up the Hill
To sacrifice,
his servants left below,
That he might act
the great Commanders Will,
Without impeach
to his obedient blow;
Even for the soul
remote from earthly things,
Should mount salvations shelter,
mercies wings.
Nothing more grateful
in the highest eyes;
Nothing more firm
in danger to protect us:
Nothing more forcible
to pierce the skies,
And not depart,
till mercy do respect us;
And as the soul
life to the body gives:
So prayer revives
the soul, by prayer it lives.
A Prayer.
BEcause I have sinned, O Lord, and done wickedly in thy sight, and provoked
thee to anger by my abominable wickedness, making my body which thou have
ordained as a vessel of thy honor, an instrument of most detestable
filthiness, O Lord be merciful unto me, and pardon me this great wickedness:
look not upon me, good Father, with the eyes of justice, neither do thou draw
against me the sword of judgment; for now shall I that am but dust, stand in
thy presence, when thy wrathful indignation comes forth as a whirlewind,
and thy heavy displeasure as a tempest, seeing the earth trembles, the depths
as discovered, and the very heavens are shaken when thou art angry? Exercise
not therefore thy fury against me, that am but chafe before the wind, and as
stubble before a flaming fire: though I have sinned grievously in thy sight,
preferring my wicked desire before thy holy commandments, esteeming the
pleasure of a moment before eternal and everlasting joys: nay which is worse
making more account of vileness and vanity, and extreme folly and madness,
then of the glory and majesty of the most excellent, wonderful, and blessed
God, nothing dreading his displeasure, whose wrath makes the Devils to quake,
and burns unquenchable unto the bottomless pit of hell: whose might is so
great, that by the breath of his nostrills he can in the twinkling of an eye
destroy a thousand worlds: yet am I bold prostrating my self before the throne
of thy Majesty, heartily to beseech, and humbly to entreat thee, that thou will
not deal with me according to my merits; for I have deserved that thou
should rain down fire and brimstone from out of heaven to devour me, or to
open the earth under me, to swallow me up quick into hell: but thou art
gracious and full of compassion, and rich in mercies, therefore do men put
their trust under the shadow of thy wings. I have none in Heaven to fly unto
but thee, nor in Earth of whom I may receive any comfort but at thy favorable
hands, which are stretched out day and night to receive all that by earnest
repentance turn to thee, being ready to ease all those that are laden with the
burden of their sins, and to refresh their distressed consciences. In the
multitude of thy mercies I approach unto thee. O Lord, desiring he to look
down from the height of thy sanctuary upon me poor, and wretched sinner, and
to wipe away all mine offenses, and to blot out all my misdeeds; especially
these my ungratious, unclean, and ungodly sins, which I have confessed unto
thee, O Lord; oh let them not come up in remembrance before thee, nor be
imputed to me for ever, for thy sons sake O Lord, in whom thou art well
pleased, in whom thou wast fully satisfied upon the Cross for my sins: grant
me free pardon and remission of that I have so foolishly by my exceeding
frailty committed against thy divine Majesty: and work in my heart an utter
detestation of all my sins, that I may ever hereafter keep my self pure and
unspotted for thy kingdom. Thou that art able to make of stones children to
Abraham, mollify I pray thee my stony heart, that all manner of son-like
affections may be imprinted therein: pluck up, O good Father, these roots of
bitterness, that no unsavory fruit may come off the tree, which then by thy
own hand have planted; I desire, I look, I call, I cry for thy assistance,
that I may conquer all my unruly, and disordinate motions, and desires, and
affections. O blessed Savior, that have granted so many Petitions upon earth,
to them that were careful for the body, fulfill, I pray thee, this my desire,
not for health, nor strength, nor riches, nor honor, nor for food, nor
apparel, but for thy heavenly grace and inspiration: yea let me lose all
those rather then be left in my sinful flesh, that I should be ruled any
longer thereby. Mortify in me, good Father, the old body of sin, and give
unto me a new body, purged from dead works, to serve the living God: renew my
spirit daily, that I may cast away the works of darkness: let it be enough, O
merciful Father, that my weakness heretofore, has been made known unto
me, lest I should be too proud Now let thy strength appear, in putting this
my enemy under my feet, that thereby I may be bold to put my confidence in
thee. Why should my body made by thy hand, and my soul framed according to thy
Image, be given as a prey into the hands of Satan? Deliver me, O Lord, from
the snares of the hunter, and preserve me from the hands of mine enemy, who
lies in wait for my spiritual life, and labors my everlasting destruction;
so shall I praise thee for thy goodness, and magnify thy Name, for giving me
conquest over my adversary that is too strong for me. To thee I ^ie for
succor, till this tempest be overpast; hide me, I pray thee, under thy shield,
and buckler, that no^e of the fiery darts of Satan take ho^^ of me. Good Lord,
for the lov^ thou bear to mankind* for thy Sons sake, who has taken our
nature upon him, grant that I may not be tempted above my strength, and that
in all temptations I may fly unto thee, giving thee most humble and hearty
thanks for that thou have given a desire to withstand my sinful flesh, which
thy work, I beseech thee, for thy Name sake, to perfect and fully accomplish,
Amen.

A Meditation of the glory of the new Jerusalem.
Unto the spring of endless life,
My fainting soul does thirst,
Full feign the cloister of her flesh
With speed she wishes burst.
She seeks, she sues, she strives exild,
Her Country to obtain,
Wailing that nothing here she finds
But misery and pain.
Contemplating the glory, which
She when she sinned lost,
Her woes increas her grief the more
To think how dear they cost.
For who can utter with what joy
That happy peace delights?
Where Palaces stand stately reared
With living Margarites;
With gold the lofty turrets shine,
And chambers glittering bright,
And all the frame, with only jems
And precious stones is dight,
The streets, the City out are paved
With gold as crystal cleene,
Where dirt, nor rays, nor dung annoyes,
Nor any filth is seen.
Stormy winter, scorching summer,
Come never there to brawle,
Rose flowers spring continually
With spring continual:
Lillies still white and saffron ruddy
And balsome sweating grows;
Meads always green, corn always grown
And honey in rivers flows,
Sweet spices breath out fragrant smells,
Rich liquors and perfumes,
Fair orchards overshaded stand
With fruit that near consumes,
No varying course of sun, or moon,
Or stars, comes in their sight;
The Lamb is to that happy City
A never failing light.
Nor night, nor morn, nor time is there,
But a continual day,
Where Saints in glory shine like suns
And glittering beams display;
In triumphs crowned, together they
With joy conjubilate,
And the battles of their vanquishd foe
Secured, now relate.
Purged clean from either blot or spot
They grudge of flesh seele none;
For flesh made now spiritual,
With the spirit grees in one,
Abounding with untroubled peace,
No scandalls them annoy,
Who freed from mutabilty,
Their center re-enjoy;
Where now they present see that truth
Which mortal eyes near saw,
And from the everlasting spring
A living sweetness draw.
Where ere they go they still retain
The same unaltred state,
Fair, lively, cherefull, subject to
No change, of chance, or fate.
Whose health, no sickness does decay,
Whose youth no age does waste,
Whose being without passing is,
For passing now is past.
They spring, they bloom, they flourish still
From all corruption free,
Mortality is swallowed up
By Immortality.
Who knowing him, who all does know,
Can ignorant not be,
Who in each others patent breasts,
All inmost secrets see.
The same they will, the same they nill,
One mind the same of all,
Though according to their several pains
Their guerdon's several.
Thus what is another, Charity
By love so makes her own,
That what is proper to every one,
To all is common grown.
Where ere the body's, the Eagles there
Are duly congregated,
And with it are those blessed souls
And Angels recreated.
One bread both Country, Citizens,
Does feed; one bread they crave,
Still hungry, and yet always full,
Still wishing what they have.
Whom no saciety does cloy,
Whom hunger does not bite,
With apetite they ever eat,
And still have appetite.
There the melodious singing voice,
New harmonies concents,
Their ears are lulled with sweetest sounds
Of rarest Instruments,
To him by who^ they conquered have
Due praises there they sing.
O happy soul! who present do
Behold so great a King,
And from thy lofty throne surviewst
The underwheeling Globes:
The sun, the moon, and all the heavens
In star bespangled robes.
O Christ, the palm of warriors,
Vouchsafe me of thy pity,
To make me when I end my war,
A freeman of this City.
Grant me among these Citizens
Thy bounties to partake,
Mean while assist me with thy aid,
A happy fight to make:
That warring out my time, the rest
In quiet I may spend,
And for my guerdon thee enjoy,
For ever without end.
Amen.
A serious discourse concerning the Day of Death.
LET us imagine how the time being now come, in which the sinful soul is to
be separated from the bands of the body with how grievous fear it is
terrified! with how great anguish of an afflicted conscience it is tormented!
it remembers the things forbidden, which it has committed; it beholds the
Commandments of God, which through negligence and contempt it has omitted: it
grieveth that the time which it had to repent has been so vainly employed: it
grieveth the imutable moment of severe revenge is so near at hand, not possible
to be avoided: it would fain stay, it is forced to depart; it would feign
recover that which it has lost, and cannot be heard; it looks backward upon
the course of its whole life past, and esteems it to be but as it were one
only little pace; it looks forward and sees infinite worlds of time, which
shall never have end: It lamenteth therefore, for having lost the joys of all
eternity which it might have gained so quickly; it weepeth likewise, that for
the short pleasure of the alluring flesh, it is bereaved of everlasting
happiness; it blusheth that for the substance sake, which is to be meat for
worms, it has neglected that which should have been placed amongst the quires
of Angels.

At length it lifts up the eyes of its mind, and considering the glory of the
immortal riches of Heaven, it is ashamed, that for the love of the beggary of
this present life, it has lost that glory: again, when it looks downwards
upon the veil of this world, as upon a mist, and contrariwise, seeing above it
the brightness of that eternal light, it plainly perceives that that which
was loved, was but darkness, and night. Oh if it could obtain the favor to
have some little time for repentance! how austere would it be in life and
conversation? how many, and how great matters would it promise to perform? how
strictly would it bind it self to piety, and devotion? in the mean season,
whilst the eyesight fails, and whilst the heart pants, and the throat does
draw breath with difficulty, whilst the countenance grows pale, and all the
members of the body become stiff through cold; whilst these things, and other
such like, happen, as certain signs of death approaching, all its works and
words present themselves before it, yea, its very thoughts are not wanting; and
all these give bitter testimony against it, as against the Author of them: All
its sins and iniquities are laid as it were in heaps before its eyes, and those
which it is unwilling to see, it is forced to behold, whether it will or no.

Moreover, on the one side of it, it beholds a terrible troop of dreadful
Devils, on the other side a multitude of heavenly Angels; the soul that lies
in the midst, quickly perceives to which of these companies it appertains,
for if there be seen in it the signs and tokens of goodness, it is comforted
by the comfortable speeches of the Angels, and by the sweetness of their
harmonious melody, it is allured to come forth of the body: contrariwise, if
the darkness of its deserts, and deformity of its filthiness do adjudge it to
the left hand, it is forthwith stricken with intolerable fear; it is troubled
through the fo^ce of the sudden violence that is used; it is thrown down
headlong, and assaulted, and (poor soul) is forcibly plucked out of the prison
of the flesh, that it may be drawn to eternal torments with unspeakable
bitterness.

Now after it is departed out of the body, who is able to express how many
troops of wicked spirits do lie in wait to entrap it? how many bands of
frowning fiends being ready with cruel torments to afflict it do beset the
way to hinder his passage? and to the end it may not escape and pass through
them whole legions of them do assault the same.

Wherefore, to consider these* and such like things, by frequent meditation, is
a sovereign means to contemn the enticing allurements of sin, to abandon the
world, and to subdue the unlawful motions of the flesh; and finally does
cause, and conserve in us a continual desire of attaining to perfection, which
God of his mercy grant us, Amen.

ALmighty God, and all merciful Father, which art the Physician of my body and
soul, in thy hands are life and death; thou bring to the grave and pullest
back again: I came into the world upon condition to forsake it whenever
thou would call me; and now the Sumners are come, thy fetters hold me, and
none can loose me but he that bound me: I am sick in body and in soul, but
he has stricken me, which in judgment shows mercy; I deserved to die so
soon as I came to life, but thou have preserved me till now; and shall this
mercy be in vain, as though I were preserved for nothing? who can praise thee
in the grave? I have done thee no service since I was borne, but my goodness is
to come; and shall I die before I begin to live? but, Lord, thou know what
is best of all, and if thou convert me I shall be converted in an instant; and
as thou acceptedst the will of David as well as the act of Solomon, so thou will accept my desire to serve thee, as well as if I had lived to glorify
thee: the spirit is willing, but the flesh is frail, and as I did live
sinfully whenever thy spirit was from me, so I shall die unwillingly, unless
thy spirit prepare me; therefore, dear Father, give me that mind which a sick
man should have, and increase my patience with my pain, and call unto my
remembrance all which I have heard, or read, or felt, or meditated, to
strengthen me in this hour of my trial that I which never taught any good
while I lived, may now teach others how to dye, and to bear their sickness
patiently: apply unto me all the mercies and merits of thy beloved Son, as if
he had died for me alone: be not far from me when the enemy comes, but when the
tempter is busiest, let thy spirit be busy too, and if it please thee to loose
me out of this prison, when I shall leave my earth to earth, let thy Angels
carry up my soul to Heaven, as they did Lazarus* and place me in one of those
Mansions which thy Son is gone to prepare for me; this is my Mediator which
has reconciled me unto thee; when thou did abhor me for my sins, thou did
send him from heaven to me, to show that thou art ready to hear him for us,
therefore in him I come unto thee, in him I will call upon thee, O my Redeemer,
Preserver, and my Savior, to thee be praise with the Father, and the Holy
Spirit for ever. Amen.

Who shall stay me from my Father, and my Brother, and my Comforter.

I Owe God a death, as his Son died for me: ever since I was borne I have been
sailing toward this Haven, and gathering patience to comfort this hour,
therefore shall I be one of those guests now that would not come to the banquet
when they were invited? what hurt is in going to Paradise? I shall lose nothing
but the sense of evil, and anon I shall have greater joys then I feel pains;
for my head is in Heaven already, to assure me that my soul and body shall
follow after: O Death where is thy sting? why should I fear that which I would
not escape, because my chiefest happiness is behind, and I cannot have it
unless I go unto it; I would go through Hell to Heaven; and therefore if I
march but through death, I suffer less then I would for God: my pains do not
dismay me, because I travel to bring forth eternal life; my sins do not
affright me, because I have Christ my Redeemer; the Judge does not astonish me,
because the Judges Son is my Advocate; the Devil does not amaze me, because
the Angels pitch about me; the grave does not grieve me, because it was my
Lords bed. O that Gods mercies to me, might move others to love him; for the
less I can express it, the more it is: the Prophets and Apostles are my
forerunners, every man is gone before me, or else he will follow after me* if
it please God to receive me into Heaven before them that have served him
better, I owe more thanks to him: and because I have deferred my repentance
till this hour, whereby my salvation is cut off if I should dye suddenly: lo,
how my God in his merciful providence, to prevent my destruction, calls me
by a lingering sickness, which stays till I be ready, and prepares me to my
end lik a Preacher, and makes me by woeful pains, weary of this beloved world,
lest I should depart unwillingly, like them whose death is their damnation: so
he loves me whilst he beats me, that his stripes are Plasters to salve me:
therefore who shall love him, if I forsake him? this is my whole desire now to
strengthen my body with my heart, and to be contented, as God has appointed,
until I glorify him, or he glorify me; If I live, I live to sacrifice; if I
die, I die a sacrifice, for his mercy is above my iniquity: therefore if I
should fear death, it were a sign that I had not faith, nor hope, as I
professed but that I doubted of Gods truth in his promise, whether he will
forgive his penitent sinners or no. It is my Father, let him do what seems
good in his sight. Come Lord Jesus, for thy servant comes; I am willing, help
my unwillingnesses.

For the Morning.
NOw that the day star does arise
Beg we of God with humble cries
Hurtful things to keep away,
While we duly spend the day,
Our tongues to guide, so that no strife
May breed disquiet in our life:
To shut and close the wandering eye,
Lest it let in vanity:
To keep the heart as pure and free
From ^^nd and troubled fantasy:
To tame proud flesh, while we deny it
A full cup and wanton diet,
That when the day light shall go out
Time bringing on the night about,
We by leaving worldly ways,
May in silence sing God praise.
Amen.
Come Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,
And lighten with celestial fire;
Thou the anointing spirit art
Who do thy sevenfold gifts impart;
Thy blessed unction from above,
Is comfort, life, and fire of love;
(...) with perpetual light
The ^nesse of my blinded sight.
Ano^^t and cheer my soyled face
With the abundance of thy grace:
Keep (...) my ^oes, give peace at hom
Where thou art guide, no ill can com.
Teach me to know the father, son,
And thee of both to be but one.
That through the Ages all along,
This may be my endless song,
Praise to thy Eternal Merit,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
A Prayer for the Morning.
O Lord be merciful unto me a miserable sinner.

O Lord I beseech thee, let thine ears be attentive unto the prayer of thy
servant that desires to fear thy name, and prosper I pray thee, thy servant
this day.

And good Lord I beseech thee, send thy holy Spirit into my soul, so to teach
me to pray unto thee, that both my self, and my prayers, may be acceptable in
thy sight, O Lord my strength, and my Redeemer. And good Lord I beseech thee,
to remove all my sins out of thy sight, that they may neither hinder my
prayers from ascending up unto thee, nor thy mercies from descending down upon
me: And good Lord, I humbly beseech thee, to banish out of my heart and soul
all evil thoughts and desires, all fond love and affection, all carnal lust
and concupiscence, and whatsoever else may any way hinder me from the true
love, and worship of thy divine and sacred Majesty.

O Eternal God, maker and high possessour both of Heaven and Earth, look
down, I humbly beseech thee, with pity and compassion upon a poor, miserable,
distressed sinner, who am not worthy to lift up my eyes toward the throne of
thy divine and sacred Majesty much less worthy of any of thy mercies, and
gracious blessings, which continually from time to time thou have been pleased
to bestow upon me* for, O Lord, so many and so mighty are my sins, wherewith
I have offended thy divine and sacred Majesty, both in thought, word, deed, and
desire, that if thou should enter into judgment with me, and deal with me
according to thy justice, and my desert, I must expect nothing but eternal
death and damnation: But I most humbly beseech thee for Jesus Christ his sake,
that it will please thee to have mercy upon me, and to pardon me all my sins
and offenses, and to remove all those judgments away from me, which my sins
have deserved: and give me grace ever hereafter to amend my ungodly life, and
to love, and serve, and honor thee, truly, faithfully, and unfeignedly,
without pride, presumption, vain glory, and hypocrisy; from these and all
other deadly sins, good Lord deliver me. And good Father, I give thee most
humble thanks for all thy mercies and gracious blessings which continually from
time to time thou have been pleased to bestow upon me, more especially for that
it has pleased thee this night past to preserve me from all evils,
notwithstanding all my sins, and ill deserts; Lord thou might have made my
bed my grave, and thrown my soul into the deep pit of hell, had thou dealt
with me according to thy justice, and my desert, but good Father, as thou have
given me time, so I beseech thee, for Jesus Christ his sake, to give me grace
to repent and amend my ungodly life, and to spend those remnant of days which
thou have appointed me to live, only in thy service. And to that end, O Lord I
humbly beseech thee, withdraw my heart and soul from the love of the world
and worldly vanities, and wholly devote it unto the love and service of thy
divine Majesty. And good Father, I humbly beseech thee, for Jesus Christ his
sake, that it will please thee to continue thy loving favor unto me, in
preserving me this day from all sin and wickedness, from all evil thoughts,
words, deeds, and desires, and from all evil and misfortune, both of soul and
body: good Lord, sanctify my soul and body this day and evermore to thy
service; Lord bless and prosper all my proceedings, all my thoughts, words,
deeds, and desires, and grant that they may all be directed to the honor and
glory of thy Name, the good of others, and the peace and comfort of my own
soul and conscience, when I shall come before thee to make my last accounts*
Lord keep me in thy faith, fear, and love; and give me grace to live in thy
fear, and die in thy favor; and good Lord, I humbly beseech thee to grant me
the use of my sight, senses, and limbs, whilst I live in this transitory life,
that I may be the better enabled to serve thee: Lord be merciful to thy
whole Church and chosen people every where, and in thy good time establish thy
true Religion and Worship amongst us, which is agreeable to thy holy will and
word. And now good Lord, Into thy hands I humbly commend my soul and body my
life and all that ever I have, to be guided directed and protected by thee:
good Lord, suffer me not this day to do any thing to displease thee, but let
thy holy spirit guide and direct me, thy holy Angels pitch their tents round
about me, to keep and protect me from all the assaults of my enemies both
bodily and ghostly this day and ever: Good Lord, show me the way wherein I
shall walk, and the thing that I shall do; and give me grace to walk
humbly, faithfully, and sincerely before thee this day and all the days of my
life; grant this, O most merciful Father, and whatsoever else thou in thy
divine wisdom know most needful for me, and that for the merits of thy
dear son, my Savior Jesus Christ; to whom with the Father, and the holy and
blessed Spirit, be ascribed all honor, praise, power, and glory, world without
end, Amen.

O Lord pardon the imperfection of my Prayers.
Dum expiro spero.
For the Evening.
BLessed Savior, Lord of all,
Vouchsafe to hear when we call:
And now to those propitious be,
That in prayer bow to thee,
Still to be kept from misery.
Great ruler of the day and night,
On our darkness cast thy light,
And let thy passion pardon win
For what we have offended in
Thought, or word, or deed of sin.
And as thy mercy wipes away
What we have done amiss to day,
So now the night returns again
Our bodies, and our souls restrain
From being soild with sinful stain.
Let not dull sleep oppress our eyes,
Nor us the enemy surprise,
Nor fearful dreams our minds affright
While the blacknes of the night
Holds from us the cheerful light.
To thee who do by rest renew
Our wasted strength, we humbly sue
That when we shall unclose our eyes,
Pure and chaste we may arise,
And make our morning sacrifice.
Honor Lord to thee be done,
O thou blessed Virgins Son,
With the Father, and the Spirit,
As is thine eternal merit,
Ever and ever to inherit.
Amen
An Evening Prayer for a private Family.
O Eternal and most glorious Lord God, Creator and Maker of Heaven and Earth,
we the most miserable, most sinful, and most unworthy of all thy creatures, do
here presume to present our selves before the Throne of thy most glorious
Majesty, from the bottom of our hearts humbly acknowledging our vile
wickedness, and upon our knees beg pardon of thy gracious and most glorious
Majesty, for all our sins past, committed in thought, word, or deed, against
thy divine Majesty: And as in duty we are bound, we give thee glory and praise
for all thy mercies, and good blessings from time to time bestowed upon us: and
more especially and in particular, we laud and magnify thy great and most
glorious Name, for that thou have preserved us safe this day past from all
evils, and from all dangers, both of body and soul, and have bestowed thy
blessings upon us both spiritual and temporal: for which, as for all the rest
of thy good gifts and benefits, which either this day past, or at any other
time, thou have been graciously pleased to bestow upon us, we magnify thy
great and glorious Name; beseeching thee, that with thy blessings thou will
give us thy Grace, that we may live to glorify thy great and most mighty Name
for them all. And good Lord, we beseech thee, pass by our great, manifold,
and most numberless sins and transgressions: Lord grant us true repentance for
them all; and grant us grace ever hereafter, to serve and please thee in
newness of life, all the the days we have to live in this our Pilgrimage.
Lord teach us so to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto
wisdom, and grant us grace, good Father, that we may so spend our remainder
of days that we have to live in this world, that they may be to the glory of
thy great Name, and to the salvation of our own souls, for Jesus Christ's sake.
And as thou have been a mighty and most glorious Lord God, in preserving and
keeping of us, all the days and times of our life hitherto, and especially
this day past, so good Lord, vouchsafe to take us all this night into thy most
glorious protection: Lord, defend and keep us from all evils, and from all
dangers, that may happen unto us either bodily or ghostly Lord, let thy holy
Angels guard us to deliver us from all evils. Lord bless us all with the quiet
rest and sleep of our bodies: Save us, good Lord, waking, and keep us
sleeping, that we may wake in Christ and rest in peace. Bless us, that both
sleeping and waking we may be thine. O Lord, leave us not to our selves, nor
forsake us utterly, but in thy blessed time, make us to be sheep of that flock
whereof our blessed Lord and Savior Christ Jesus is the great Shepherd. Hear
us, good Lord, in these our weak and most imperfect prayers; grant us them, and
what else thou in thy mighty wisdom know to be most necessary for us, and
that for the glory of thy great Names sake, for thy mercy sake, and for our
blessed Lord and Savior Christ Jesus sake; in whose most blessed name and
words we further call upon thee, as he in his holy, and Heavenly, and most
blessed Gospel has taught us saying:

Our Father, etc.

Let thy mighty hand and outstretched arm, O Lord, be still our defense; thy
mercy and loving kindness in Jesus Christ thy dear son, our salvation; thy
true and holy word, our instruction; thy grace and holy spirit, our comfort and
consolation, unto the end, and in the end. Amen.

When we enter into our bed.
IN the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, (who was crucified upon his Cross, and
laid into his grave for me) I lay me down to rest: he bless me, keep me, and
raise me up again, and bring me at last to life eternal. Amen.

I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest, for it is thou Lord only, that
make me dwell in safety.

Have mercy upon me, O Lord, now and at the hour of death.

Preserve me while I am waking, and defend me when I am sleeping, that my
soul may continually watch for thee, and both body and soul may rest in thy
peace for evermore, Amen.

An admonition before we go to sleep.
PErmit not sluggish sleep
To close your waking eye,
Till that with judgment deep
Your daily deeds you try.
He that his sin in conscience keeps
When he to quiet goes,
More desperate is then he that sleeps
Amidst his mortal foes.
At night lie down
Prepare to have
Thy sleep, thy death,
Thy bed, thy grave.
Awake, arise,
Think that thou have
Thy life but lent,
Thy breath a blast.
O thou God Almighty!
Father of all mercy,
Fountain of all pity,
Grant I beseech thee,
Of thy great clemency,
On me to have mercy,
Now, and at the hour of death,
Amen.
Proverbs of Solomon,
Chap. 10.
TReasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivers from
death.

The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casts
away the substance of the wicked.

Blessings are upon the head of the Just: but violence covers the mouth of
the wicked.

The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.

The blessings of the Lord it makes rich, and he does add no sorrows with it.

The fear of the Lord increases the days: but the years of the wicked shall
be diminished.

The patient abiding of the righteous shall be gladness: but the hope of the
wicked shall perish.

The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not dwell in the
Land.

Chap. 11.
RIches avail not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivers from
death.

The righteousness of the just shall deliver them: but the transgressors shall be
taken in their own net.

He that is merciful rewards his own soul.

As righteousness leads to life: so he that follows evil, seeks his own
death.

They that are of a froward heart, are abomination to the Lord: but they that
are upright in the way, are his delight.

He that trusts in riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a
leaf.

Chap. 13.
THe hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the desire
comes, it is a tree of life.

He that despises the word, he shall be destroyed: but he that fears the
Commandments, he shall be rewarded.

Chap. 14.
IN the fear of the Lord is an assured strength, and his Children shall have
hope.

The fear of the Lord is a Wellspring of life, to avoid the snares of death.

Chap. 15.
THe Lord is far from the wicked: but he hears the prayer of the righteous.

The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom: and before honor goes
humility.

Chap. 16.
COmmit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be directed.

By mercy, and truth iniquity shall be forgiven: and by the fear of the Lord
they departed from evil.

Age is a crown of glory, when it is found in the way of righteousness.

He that is slow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that rules
his own mind is better then he that wins a City.

Chap. 17.
A Joyful heart causes good health: but a sorrowful mind dries the bones.

Chap. 18.
THe name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runs to it and is
exalted.

The spirit of man will sustain his infirmity: but a wounded spirit who can
bear?

Chap. 19.
HE that has mercy upon the poor, lends unto the Lord, and the Lord will
recompense him that which he has given.

The fear of the Lord leads to life; and he that is filled therewith, shall
continue, and shall not be visited with evil.

Chap. 21.
HE that follows after righteousness and mercy, shall find life,
righteousness and glory.

Chap. 22.
THe reward of humility, and the fear of God, is riches, glory, and life.

My son, give me thy heart, and let thine eyes delight in my ways.

Chap. 28.
HE that hides his sins shall not prosper: but he that confesses and
forsakes them, shall have mercy.

Blessed is the man that fears always: but he that hardneth his heart, shall
fall into evil.

He that walks uprightly shall be saved: but he that is froward in his wages,
shall fall at once.

Job. Chap. 28.
THe fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding.

Ecclesiastes. Chap. 7.
A Good Name is better then a good Ointment, and the day of death then the day
that one is born.

It is better to go to the house of mourning, then to the house of feasting,
because this is the end of all men: and the living shall lay it to heart. Anger
is better then laughter; for by a sad look the heart is made better.

The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning: but the heart of fools is
in the house of mirth.

The end of a thing is better then the beginning thereof: and the patient in
spirit is better then the proud in spirit.

In the day of wealth be of good Comfort; and in the day of affliction consider.

Surely there is no man just upon the earth, that does good and sins not.

Ecclesiasticus.
Chap. 1.
THe fear of the Lord is glory, and gladness, and rejoicing, and a joyful
Crown.

The fear of the Lord makes a merry heart, and gives gladness, and joy, and
long life.

Who so fears the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last, and he shall
find favor in the day of his death.

Who so fears the Lord shall prosper, and in the day of his end he shall be
blessed.

A patient man will suffer for a time, and then he shall have the reward of joy.

Chap. 2.
YE that fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts shall be lightened.

Consider the old generations of men, ye children, and mark them them well:
was there ever any confounded that put his trust in the Lord? or who has
continued in his fear, and was forsaken? or whom did he ever despise that
called upon him?

For God is gracious and merciful, and forgiveth sins, and saves in the time
of trouble, and is a defender for all them that seek him in truth.

Chap. 6.
HOld friendship with many, nevertheless have but one Councellor of a thousand.

Depart from thy enemies, and be wary of thy friends.

Chap. 7.
LEt not them that weep be without comfort: Bur mourn with such as mourn.

Whatsoever thou take in hand remember the end, and thou shall never do amiss.

Chap. 8.
DEspise not a man that turns himself away from sin, nor cast him not in the
teeth withal, but remember that we are all worthy of blame.

Chap. 9.
TRy thy neighbor as near as thou can; and ask Counsel of the wise.

Let thy talk be with the wise, and all thy communication in the Law of the
most high.

Let just men eat and drink with thee, and let thy rejoicing be in the fear of
the Lord.

Chap. 10.
GOd destroys the memorial of the proud, and leaves the remembrance of the
humble.

Pride was not created in men, neither wrath in the generation of women.

The fear of the Lord is the glory as well of the rich, and the noble, as of
the poor.

It is not meet to despise the poor man that has understanding: neither is it
convenient to magnify the rich that is a wicked man.

The great man, and the Judge, and the man in authority, are honorable; yet is
there none greater then he that fears the Lord.

Chap. 11.
VVIsdome sets up the head of him that is low, and makes him to sit among
great men.

Commend not a man for his beauty: neither despise a man in his outward
appearance.

Be not proud of clothing and raiment, and exalt not thy self in the day of
honor; for the works of the Lord are wonderful, and glorious, secret and
unknown are his works among men.

Blame no man before thou have inquired the matter: understand first, and then
reform righteously.

Give no sentence, before thou have heard the Cause, neither interrupt men in
the midst of their tales.

Prosperity and adversity, life and death, poverty and riches come of the Lord.

The gift of the Lord remains for the godly, and his good will gives
prosperity for ever.

In thy good state remember adversity: and in adversity forget not prosperity.

For it is an easy thing unto the Lord in the day of death to reward a man
according to his ways.

The adversity of an hour makes one to forget pleasure: and in a man's end his
works are discovered.

Judge no man blessed before his death.

Chap. 12.
When thou will do good, know to whom thou do it, so shall thou be thanked
for thy benefits.

Do good unto the righteous, and thou shall find great reward, though not of
him, yet of the most high.

Bind not two sins together, for there shall not one be unpunnished.

Chap. 14.
BLessed is the man that has not fallen by the word of his mouth, and is not
tormented with the sorrow of sin.

Blessed is the man that is not condemned in his conscience, and is not fallen
from his hope in the Lord.

Do good unto thy friend before thou dye, and according to thy ability stretch
out thy hand and give him.

He that fears the Lord will do good: and he that has the knowledge of the
Law, will keep it sure.

Chap. 21.
MY son, have thou sinned? do so no more, but pray for the former sins, that
they may be forgiven thee.

Fly from sin, as from a serpent, for if thou come near it, it will bite
thee: the teeth thereof are as the teeth of a Lion to slay the souls of men.

All iniquity is as a two edged sword, the wounds where of cannot be healed.

The prayer of the poor going out of the mouth, comes unto the ears of the
Lord, and justice is done unto him incontinently.

Whosoever hates to be reformed, is in the way of sinners: but he that fears the
Lord converteth in heart.

Chap. 23.
ACcustom not thy mouth to swearing, for in it there are many falls; neither
take up for a custom the naming of the Holy one, for thou shall not be
unpunished for such things.

A man that uses much swearing, shall be filled with wickedness, and the
plague shall never go from his house* when he shall offend, his fault shall be upon
him; and if he acknowledge not his sin, he makes a double offense: and if he
swear in vain, he shall not be innocent, but his house shall be full of
plagues.

Who shall set a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips,
that I fall not suddenly, and that my tongue destroy me not?

O Lord, Father and Governor of my whole life, leave me not to the Counsel of
the wicked, and let me not fall by them.

Who will correct my thought, and put the doctrine of wisdom in mine heart,
lest my ignorances increase, and my sins abound to my destruction, and lest I
fall before my adversaries, and my enemies rejoice over me, whose hope is far
from thy mercy.

O Lord, Father, and God of my life, leave me not in their imaginations,
neither give me a proud look, but turn away from thy servant a haughty mind.

Take from me vain hope and concupiscence, and retain him in obedience that
desires continually to serve thee.

Let not the greediness of the belly, nor lust of the flesh hold me, and give
not me thy servant over into an impudent mind.

FINIS.
