Beware the Bear. THE STRANGE, BUT PLEASING HISTORY OF Balbulo and Rosina.

Who having appointed a Midnight meeting ere the consummation of their
intended Marriage, were extremely disturbed by the saucy intrusion of a
Licquorish BEAR.

Who not only frustrated their Solace, Sindg'd his own Hyde, and put ROSINA
into a Cold Sweat, but procured the destruction of a most enabling POSSET.

Full of pleasant Mirth and Variety.

LONDON. Printed for EDWARD CROWCH, 1650.

THE ARGUMENT.
Balbulo wounded by Loves dart,
Wooes, and wins her, that rules his heart;
Appoints the day his Wench to Wed,
But first desires a proof in Bed:
She yields, yet he neglects the hour,
Which makes Rosina look full sour.
A Posset, she prepares, with cost,
To cause the young Man do his most:
And 'twixt the Sheets, with longing eyes,
She awaking waits a prize.
By chance a Bearward, with his Beasts,
Near to Rosina's lodging rests;
One of which Cattle, making room,
Does to Rosina's Chamber come;
Torments the Damsel with strange fears,
And pulls an old house over his ears.
Balbulo by his promise bound,
Visits his Mistress in a swound;
And thinking that he near her draws,
Feels a rough Hide, and sharpened Claws;
Retires amazed, and hides his Head,
His Vitalls much endangered.
THere lived (not many years since) in the North part of England a young Farmer
named Balbulo, who became extremely Enamoured on a Damsel (his next neighbor)
called Rosina, at last he obtained his desires to Marry her; but before the
time appointed, they had agreed to be anticipatious in the business, and too too
forward in yiedling one another benevolences before they were due: For the
effecting whereof, time and place were appointed, Rosina was the first Champion
that appeared in the field, Balbulo met with some good Fellows by the way that
fore-slow'd his march, and retarded his appearance to the Court of Venus.

Yet for all that Balbulo would approve himself mindful of his promise; and
though he were obstructed (by an unlook'd-for accident) from prostrating his
person, to the disposure of his pliant Para-nymph: yet to signify his reality,
and that his Mistress aspect (with sorrow for his procrastination) might not
be muffled (at his approach) in sullen mists of dolor, though he had ever
hated (hitherto) to pick out his own brains with his Pen, he took pen, ink, and
paper, and thus elegantly exerciz'd his Genius.

Prithee sweeting be content,
And accept this Complement
In my stead, until I come
In person for to clap thy Bum:
Know a crew of Bonny Blades,
None of the meaner, courser swades,
But Tom the Shepherd, Will the Ditcher,
And Ralph that loves to beat the Pitcher;
Dick the Thrasher, Hal the Weaver,
Ned the Neatherd, Nic the cleaver
Of lusty Loggs, have bem'd me in
At Mother Red-caps, with the Chin
So hung with Hair: We sing and drink,
Laugh, and quaffe, and club our Chink,
That the House seems to run round,
Sure the place is Faiery ground.
Be assured I shall endeavor,
Soon as I can, my self to sever
From my Companions, fair and free,
To toy, and sport, and play with thee.
Sweet morsel of Maids-flesh, thy most damnably devoted Servant, Balbulo.


After he had finished this elaborate Epistle, he called for Starch, and after
the best manner cementing both ends of the folded paper, he superscribed it
thus:

To the most voracious Virgin my very loving Landabrides
these present.


Having brought to period this Important business, he speedily dispatched an
Emissarie, with charge to diliver his Epistle to none save his dear Rosina,
who poor soul (having given him over for a lost man, her Hostess being of
the same faith) were once resolved to wait his leisure no longer, but Rosina
(something more confident of his performance then the other) was willing to
spin out a little more time, and busies her self in making a Sack-posset
against his coming, the Posset being made, but no Balbulo, patience was quite
worn out, when, as good luck would have it, in comes mother Red-caps Son, with
a letter in his hand from Balbulo, as welcome (God knows) to the red cheek'd
Rosina, as a shower of Rain to a parched Dunghill; Oh quoth Rosina, I little
thought Balbulo would have served me thus, I am like to have great good of him
when we are Married, that fails in the performance of his first promise; Ah
Balbulo, Balbulo, did thou know the ardour of my longing desires, thou
would rob Cupid of his wings and fly into my Arms, with a strict charge to
conjure Balbulo, by all that was, is, and like to come: the messenger returns
to Balbulo, whom he found in the very same posture he left him, Bowsing, and
Braying, with the rest, to whom approaching, he craved his ear in private, who
fetching a deep sigh from the very bottom of his belly (a sigh God knows, so
hot, and Sulpherous that it had endangered his Beard, had not his numerous
tears opportunely dropped, and allayed the fervor thereof) taxing his dull
delay, and resolving speedily to break up School, and have to his beloved, he
returned to his companions.

And now also, let us return to forlorn and pensive Rosina, who having quite
tired out her patience, and being no longer able to contain her self, took
the Sack-posset and set it upon the Cubberds head, covering it with a Trencher,
and a napkin, placing a candle by it, took leave of her Hostess, and prepares
for bedward, putting the door only too, for fear her Sweetheart should find
any difficulty in his approach, if (as he was like) he should happen to come
late, or she disturbed to let him in, if it should be locked, or bolted; late
brought all to bed, that were in the house.

Now you must understand, that in the evening before this happened, that a
Bearward had brought three lusty Bears, to town and had taken up quarters for
them in the same Inn, lodging them in a little Stable that happened to be just
underneath the Chamber where Balbulo and Rosina had intended to be very
Superlative, in the degrees of happiness. But it happened that Rosina was no
sooner got into her bed, but one of the great Bears, senting the stream of the
Posset, broke loose, and happened to pull down a whole pane of the wall, that
opened at the foot of the Staire case, that led up to Rosina's lodgings, up
Stairs climbs the Bear, Rosina hearing some body coming up, was in good hope
it had been her Sweetheart, though she thought the party came up, somewhat
heavily, and trod (though not more gently, yet) more softly then Rosina was
wont to do, which she conjectured to be, because (it may be) he was in the
dark, and had no body to light him up the Stairs, and it would be otherwise
so soon as he should come into the light, [enter Beare] Rosina (perceiving so
ugly a creature coming in, upon all four, winding with his nose, and
twinkling with his eyes) she sinkes down in her bed, and falls a praying, but
durst not cry out for fear she should give the devouring creature notice of
her being there: but tears, which had so little way to fall, and fall so
softly, and trembling, that could make no noise upon a bed of down, she makes
use of sufficiently, to express the woefulness of her condition, and the
greatness of her fear which was presently augmented, and multiplied upon her
like numbers, in Arithmetic, for the Bear (senting the Posset) rises up an
end, and with his forepawes, rests upon the Cubberd, and nuzzells the Trencher
that covered the Posset off the Goblet, and thrusting his snout into the
hot-kept licquour, he so burnt his nose, that he made a most fearful noise,
and endeavoring to leap down, his nails so stuck in the Cubberd-cloth, that
down comes the Sack-posset about his ears, the Candle into his eyes, which
the melted tallow (together with the hot liquour) so got into, and made them so
smart that it caused him to Roar, as if all the Devils in hell had been in
the room: all this while the Bears claws were not dis-engaged from the
Cubberd-cloath, nor the cloth from what it covered, so that at last (with the
Bears striving) down comes the great canopied Cubberd, and all upon the Bear,
so that the Bear began to be worse afraid, and more hurt, then terrified
Rosina, who laboring to discharge himself of the weight that was upon him,
(the Candle all this while lying upon the ground still blazing) the Bear (at
last) intch'd, and intch'd, so near unto the flame, that it set all the hair
upon the Bears back on fire, whereat the Bear set out a wider throat, then
all the baitings that ever he had could force him to; Rosina (hearing a great
deal of noise besides what the Bear made, and received no hurt as yet)
thought that some body had come in unto her rescue, and was ordering the Bear,
and that the Bear Roared by reason of some correction, wherefore she took the
boldness, to peep out of the bed, to see whether it were so or not, but when
she perceived a thing all on fire, and another thing over it, stirring up and
down the room, she began to be afraid of the Devil, worse then of the Bear,
wherefore she flings the clothes over her head again, and falls to making
vows, that if ever she were delivered from that just Judgment that was upon
her for that unlawful assembly, she would never violate the old Laws and
Customs of her devout Ancestors, by such deeds of Anticipation; whereupon the
Bear (dis-ingag'd of his toil) left Roaring, the Candle, and the Hair went
out, all was quiet, the Bear fell to licking up his Posset, all about the
room, (to which the Bear had not been accustomed) that his brains were
intoxicated, (who wanting a place, to repose his giddy brain) Skip-frogs up
upon the bed, and lays him down half on, and half off the miserable Rosina:
the Bearward hearing the noise, was rising out of his bed, to know the cause of
their unrulinesse, but perceiving them to be quiet, went to bed again.

By this time Balbulo had parted with his merry Mates, and comes (more drunk
then sober) to the door, the outward door of the house) the Hostess asks
who is there? Balbulo cries, it is I: who are you said the Hostess? it is I
Balbulo, don't you know my voice? you know my business well enough: it is you
(said the Hostess) is this a time a night? well I come, she slips an old
Petticoate over her shoulders and comes to the door and lets him in, telling
him, that he was a fine man indeed to have a Sweetheart, if she were as she,
she would make him stay the good hour, and if there were a year to the end
on it.

Well said Balbulo, get you to bed, trouble not your self, where is she? is
she in the Chamber I bespoke? I, I, said the Hostess, can you find the way in
the dark? there is a light in the Chamber, and a Sack-posset, provided for you,
you are a sweet youth, y-faith, y-faith she is too good for you, goodnight,
goodnight old woman, (said Balbulo) too good for me, who is to good for me? up
the Stairs comes Balbulo, and finds the door open, but seeing no light in the
Chamber, he asks her, what are you? in darkness? he had not advanced three
steps into the room, but what with the slipperinesse of the boords, by reason
of the Sack posset, and the licking of the Bears tongue, down comes Balbulo
all along, up he gets upon his legs, but had not made one step nearer the bed,
but over the Cubberd comes poor Balbulo, hurts his hands, and breaks his
elbowes, lies still a while and asks, where am I? what have we here? what is
here to do?

Rosina heard a man's voice, but was afraid there had been another Bear, at
last he gets up, and resolves to order his steps more watily, and laying hold
upon one of the Beds posts, he thought himself safe enough, and that he had
her sure, when behold opening his Arms to embrace his beloved, and his mouth
to bestow this pleasing language upon; Ah my sweet heart, I hope thou will not
be angry with me, for staying so long, in troth I could not help it, and
therewith falling down upon the bed, to take his mistress in his Arms, he
embraced the Bear, who having awaked with his kindness, Roared him forth such
a curtain lecture, as I think never any such Delinquent was so miserably
served before, Balbulo recoiles, forsaking his station with such violence as
Rocks and Stones do use to make, when they are removed out of their places;
when Hell finds out a new mouth, by some eruption of the earth, so that
(forgetting his stumbling block which lay in his way) he breaks his Shins
against the Cubberd, and over and over he tumbles, being most miserably
tormented, in which agony (knowing not what he did) mistaking his way in the
dark, at the bottom of the Stairs instead of going out at the door, he runs
into the broken place in the wall, that the Bear had made, and so stumbles
upon the other two, [Ba-a] cries one of the Bears, [Ba-a] cries the other too,
Balbulo imagining no less, but that flying from one, he had fallen into Hell,
amongst all the Devils, Scrambles (he knew not how) from between them, and so
got loose from both, and recovers his feet, but durst not make any other use of
them then standing upon them, so unfortunate had his motion been unto him of
late, that still he ran into further mischief, till at last this Bears
unrulinesse, made him venture farther off the danger, so that he got close to
the Manger, then he knew where he was, up he gets into it, and for his greater
security sake climbs up into the rack, the Beare-ward (hearing a second Alarm)
rises out of his bed, and came to see what was the matter, where he spied one
of his Bears missing, and the wall broke down, where she had got out,
presently he raises the House, saying, he was undone, one of his Bears was
broken loose and got away, up they all rise, unchaine the Dogs, search for the
Bear, enter the Stable, see where the Bear broke out, which while they were
viewing, they could hear a voice from the Rack side, saying, do you hear,
do you hear, I know where your Bear is, with a pox to you, they looked up,
and spied Balbulo amongst the Rack staves; they asked him, where, where I pray
now? where? (says Balbulo) I know where well enough, but look that your
Bears be safe, and I Will come down and show you: they securing him from all
danger, he descends from his Pallisadoes, and directs them up into his
mistress Chamber, giving the Beareward, and the Dogs leave to go before him,
who find the Bear fast asleep in Balbulo his place, so that with much
convenience, they got the string into the ring, and pulled the Bear from off
the bed, Balbulo turning down the bed to see what was become of his sweet
heart, there ascended such a wreake of Baked, and Boiled, and Stewed, and
Roast-meat, that his Stomach was quite turned, but espying his beloved you may
Imagine what a doleful congratulation there was betwixt them, but the result
of all was, the Beareward descended with his Beasts, Rosina ascended, and what
with the help of her Hostess, and the assistance of water, became sweet
again; Balbulo having drunk hard the day before, and having been so
turmoiled the very night, laid him down to rest, and (as well as his broaken
Elbowes, and sore Shins, would give him leave) slept some hours.

Rosina and her Hostess, by this time, had sufficiently execrated the Malice
of Fortune, together with the Beareward, his robustious Beast, Rosina condoling
her own disappointment, her Hostess deploring Balbulo's Infortunitie but at
length, being weary with bewailing, they resolved to bemoane an helpelesse Ill,
but clear up their dejected Spirits, with good meat and comfortable licquours,
a Dinner therefore they resolved to prepare against Balbulo's Resurection, and
that nothing might be wanting to expel Melancholy, and drive away sullen
thoughts, they agreed with Godfrey a blind Harper, that he should strike his
strings all that day, till having received his supper, together with his hire,
he might grope his way home.

By this time Balbulo awakes, comes down (what with his excessive tippling the
day before, and what with his nocturnall anxieties) looking more like a Ghost
then Balbulo, to the ineffable sorrow of Rosina, and the Hostess, who
endeavored to comfort him all they might. Be contented my dear Balbulo, (said
Rosina) our delights are but adjourned, not annihilated by the late unhappy
disaster; pox on the Bearward, and his liquorish Beast, by whose means we were
hindered of that sweet sollace we had otherwise enjoyed; but my beloved Balbulo
(said she) the approaching night shall make amends for all. I remember what my
old Mother was wont to say, Pleasures delayed
When once attained,
Are the sweeter made.


Come sweet Balbulo fall to, cheer up thy afflicted spirits ( Balbulo all this
while sat like the Devil in his Dumps) fie for shame (said the Hostosse)
shall a woman, who is the weaker Vessel, exceed you in courage? She (poor
soul) was almost ravished by the savage Creature, life and chastity at once
endangered, and all for your sake. Well, with much ado Balbulo was allured to
eat, and by degrees to drink; and (after that) with slender arguments, to
Mirth, the Harper all this while making mellodie, equal to the wheels of some
empty Cart, hurried upon the stones; after a plenitude of Meat, Wine, and
Mirth, Godfrey departed home, and Balbulo and Rosina (maugre their late
infortunity) to their Chamber, hand in hand, their Hostess blessing them all
the way.

But alas, poor Balbulo, and loving Rosina were ever two Inamorates; so
thwarted in the fruition of each others Love; they had scarce proved one
another of a different sex, but behold loud rapping at the door, and raving
for entrance, the Hostess having taken a lusty cup the day before for joy, (to
use her own words) that since things were no better, they were no worse; slept
as supinely as a drunken Dutchman, or a Watchman, at four of the clock in the
morning, with much ado was awaked; and between fear and despair, at last
opened the door for the Constable, his Painted Staff, and his drove of
Watchmen to enter in.

Now you must understand, that not many hours before, a notable Robbery was
committed in the Town; and a Gentleman having lost to the value of 3000 l.
wherefore the Constable being desired to use his Authority for the detecting,
and apprehending of the Theives if he could catch them; thought no place more
likely to abscond such kind of fellows then Innes, and Alehouses; and having
alarumed many, he at length came hither, and presently searches room by room
for the Theives.

Balbulo and Rosina hearing a Tumult in the house, became almost out of their
wits, and could willingly have thought the Bear was again entering on the Stage
to Act the second part of his last nights Tragy-Comedy, save that they heard
the voices of Men, and not the grumbling of Bears; they knew also that the
door was locked, neither was there any Inviting Posset on the Cubberds head:
Well, they lay trembling a long time, and blamed the blameworthy Destinies for
so constant a perseverance in the frustrating of their designs. Oh! quoth
Rosina, I perceive now that bad accidents wait on bad actions By this they
might hear the tumult draw near them, Oh, quoth Balbulo, we are undone! rise,
rise, good love for Heavens sake, we shall be both carried to Prison; Hark,
hark, the Officers are even at hand to ceise upon us. Unfortunate Rofina, of
two evils, being desirous to choose the least, quickly hung on her Garments
very Geometrically, and with her beloved, took her journey out at a Window
opening into a Garden, escaping not without great danger of their lives, the
descent was so high: being down, they both concluded to wait the leisure, when
unlawfulness should be less attended, with so heavy Judgments: What became
of them afterward, Turpin, my Author, does not relate; but certainly the
Protean Goddess never excercised her power more Tyrannically over two Lovers,
than over Balbulo and Rofina; for never was a story of more woe but that of
Juliet and Romeo.

FINIS.
