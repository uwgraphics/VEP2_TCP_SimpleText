The KINGS Last farewell to the World, OR THE Dead KINGS Living Meditations, at
the approach of Death denounced against Him.
THrough fear of sharp and bitter pain,
by cutting off my days,
No pleasure in my Crown I take,
Nor in my Royal Rays.
I shall descend with grieved heart,
(for none my life can save)
Unto the dismal gates of death,
to moulder in the Grave.
Farewell my Wife, and Children all,
wipe off my brinish tears.
I am deprived of my Throne,
and from my future years.
Farewell my people every one,
for I no more shall see
The wonders of the Lord on earth,
nor with you shall I be.
Mine eyes do fail, and to the earth
to worms I must be hurled:
Henceforth no more shall I behold
the people of the world.
My Crown and Scepter I must leave,
my glory, and my Throne:
Adieu my fellow Princes all,
I from the earth am gone.
Mine Age (which did approach to me)
departed is away;
And as a Shepherds tent removed,
and I returned to clay;
And as a Weaver does cut off
his thrum, even so my life,
Must be cut off, from people and
from Children, and from Wife.
In sighs by day, and groans by night
with bitterness I moan,
And do consume away with grief,
my end to think upon.
Fear in the morning me assailes,
Death Lion-like I see,
Even all the day (till night) to roar
to make an end of me.
I chattered as the schreeking Crane,
or Swallow that does fly:
As Dove forlorn, in pensiveness,
does mourn, even so do I,
I looked up to thee, O Lord,
but now mine eyes do fail.
Oh ease my sad oppressed soul,
for death does now prevail.
What shall I say, to Gods Decree,
if he would speak, I then
should live; it is a work for God,
I find no help from men.
Yet if my life prolonged was,
my sins for to repent,
Then softly I would go and mourn,
until my life was spent.
And all my years, that I should live,
for mine offenses foul,
I would pass over in bitterness,
of my distressed soul.
O Lord, thou have discovered
to me, that by these things
Men live; Through thee, Princes do Reign,
thou swayest over Kings.
In all things here Gods providence,
and will alone commands,
The life of my poor spirit sad,
is only in his hands,
Oh, that the Lord would me restore.
my strength then I would give,
To serve my God in humbleness
whilst he would let me live.
Behold, O Lord, when I in peace,
did look to be restored,
Then was my soul in bitterness,
cast off, and I abhorred,
Yet in the love of God most good,
his righteousness most just
Has thrown me down into the pit,
and to corrupted dust,
Because that I have gone astray,
and cherisht war and strife,
My days are now cut off, and I
am quite bereft of life,
Oh cast my sins behind thy back,
good God, I humbly pray,
And my offenses with the blood
of Christ wash clean away.
When my dead body is interd,
I cannot praise thee there,
Death cannot celebrate the Lord,
my God, most good, most dear;
They that go down into the pit
destructions them devour:
For in thy truth they cannot hope,
but perish by thy power.
The living, Lord, the living, they
shall praise thy holy name.
With all the glorious host above,
and I shall do the same,
The father to his children here,
that are of tender youth,
Shall them forewarn, and unto them
make known thy glorious truth.
Forgive my sins, and save my soul
O Lord, I thee entreat,
And blot out mine offenses all,
for they are very great:
Receive my soul for Christ his sake,
my Prophet, Priest, and King,
That I with Saints and Angels may
eternal praises sing.
FINIS.
