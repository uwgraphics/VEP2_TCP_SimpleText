PAX QVAERITVR BELLO OLIVARIVS DEI GRA: REIPVB: ANGLIAE, SCOTIAE, ET HIBERNIAE,
andc PROTECTOR blazon of the Commonwealth
A Declaration of His HIGHNESS, for a Collection toward the relief of diverse
Protestant Churches driven out of Poland; And of Twenty Protestant Families
driven out of the Confines of Bohemia.
HIs Highness the Lord Protector, having received a Petition from several
Churches of Christ, professing the Reformed Religion, lately seated at Lesna,
and other places in Poland, representing their sad and deplorable condition,
through the persecution and cruelty of their Antichristian Enemies in those
parts, in the time of the War in Poland, by whom they have not only been
driven from their habitation, and spoiled of their goods upon the account of
Religion only, but forced to fly into Silesia for preservation of their
lives, and for the Liberty of their Consciences, where a considerable number of
them continue in great want and misery. The truth whereof has been witnessed,
as well by Deputies sent unto His Highness from the said Churches, authorized by
an Instrument under the hands of the Pastors of five of those Churches, as also
by the Testimony of several Protestant Princes, who out of a deep sense of the
Calamity of those distressed Exiles, have afforded them shelter until it shall
please the Lord otherwise to provide for them. And His Highness having in like
manner received a Petition from Twenty Protestant Families heretofore seated in
the Confines of Bohemia, where Misnia belongs unto it, representing their
distressed and lamentable condition, through the persecution of the Jesuits
and Inquisitors of the House of Austria, by whom they have been driven out of
their habitations, and spoiled of their goods, upon the sole account of
Religion, who now for the safety of their lives, and for the liberties of their
Consciences, are retired into the Marquisate of Culembach, where they find a
present shelter in this their very sad and calamitous condition, which has
been witnessed both by their Deputies sent unto His Highness, authorized by an
Instrument under the hands of the chief of those Families, as also by a
public Certificate from thence. And it being the earnest desire of the said
afflicted Churches and Families, as well by their several Petitions, as by their
Deputies, that His Highness out of compassion to their sufferings, would be
pleased to recommend their lamentable condition to their Brethren in these
Nations, in whom they hope to find Bowels of Mercy, yearning toward those,
who professing the same Faith with them, are now under so great extremities and
misery for the Cause of the Gospel, and testimony of the Lord Jesus.

His Highness being greatly afflicted with the miserable and calamitous
condition of the said Churches, and Families, and not doubting but the people
of these Nations, whom the Lord has graciously and wonderfully preserved from
that Antichristian Bondage and Tyranny, will have a fellow-feeling of the
afflictions of their Brethren, has with the Advice of His Privy Council,
thought fit to recommend their case to the Charity of those whose hearts the
Lord shall stir up in these Nations, to afford them some seasonable relief,
whose liberality in this kind has been testified in their large Contributions
to the relief of the poor Protestants in the Valleys of Piedmont, to the
refreshing of their Bowels (touching the faithful distribution whereof an
account is ordered by His Highness to be printed for general satisfaction.) And
to the end the said Collections may be carefully made, and the moneys thereupon
collected be disposed of, to the relief of the said poor Churches, and their
Members, and the Families aforesaid, and to no other uses, His Highness does
hereby require and command the Ministers and Churchwardens of the respective
Parishes within England and Wales and Town of Berwick upon Tweed, the next
Lords Day after this Declaration shall come unto their hands, to publish the
same, and on the Lords day following to make a Collection of the charitable
Contribution of the People in their Parishes, and that within three days
after, they pay over the sum or sums so Collected unto the high Sherif of the
respective Counties, to be by him paid into the hands of Sir Thomas Viner, and
Sir Christopher Pack Knights, Aldermen of the City of London, who are appointed
Treasurers for this service, and who shall transmit the moneys so to be by them
received for the relief of the said poor distressed Churches, and their
Members, and the aforesaid Twenty families, in such manner and proportions as
the Committee formerly appointed for the disposing of the moneys for the relief
of the said poor Protestants in Piedmont, shall, with respect to their several
numbers and sufferings, think fit, and direct, and to the end none of the
moneys collected for so pious and charitable an end may miscarry, The Minister
and Churchwardens aforesaid, are enjoined upon payment of the said money to the
respective Sheriffs as aforesaid, to send up unto the said Sir Thomas Viner a
note in writing under their hands, of the sum so Collected, the Parish and
County where such Collection was made, and the person to whom the same was
paid, to the end care may be taken, and the same may be duly returned and
employed to the use intended.
