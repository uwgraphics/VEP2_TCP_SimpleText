Touching the Judges and the late Lord Keeper.



Printed in the Year, 1641.

THE LORD FAULKLAND HIS Learned SPEECH in Parliament, in the House of COMMONS.
Mr. Speaker:
I Rejoice very much to see this day, and the want has not lain in my
affection, but in my lungs, if to all that has past, my Tongue has not been
as loud as any man's in the House, yet truly my opinion is, that we have yet
done nothing, if we do no more, I shall add what I humbly conceive might be
added, as soon as I have said something, with Reference to him that says it.

I will desire forgiveness of the House, if in ought J say, J seem to
entrench upon another profession, and enter upon the work of another Robe,
since I have bin instructed by the report of a learned Committee, and confirmed
by the uncontradicted vote of the whole House, since J shall say norhing of
this kind, but in order, to somewhat further, and which moves me most to
venture my opinion, and to expect your pardon, since J am confident that
History alone is sufficient to show this judgment, contrary to our Laws, and
Logic alone sufficient to prove it destructive to our properties, which every
free and noble person values no less then his profession

I will next profess that I know of my self, and all those that know me,
know it of me, that my natural disposition is far from inclining to
severity, much less to cruelty, That I have particular provocation from their
persons, and have particular obligations to their callings, against whom I am
to speak.

And that though not for much, yet for more then all I have, so J hope it will
be believed, that only public interest has extorted this from me, which J
would not say, if I conceived it not both so true and so necessary, that no
meat undisgested, can lie heavyer upon the stomach then this unsaid, would
have lain upon my Conscience.

Mr. Speaker, the constitution of this Commonwealth, has stablisht, or rather
endeavored to establish to us, the security of our goods, and the security of
those Laws, which should secure us, and our goods, by appointing for us
Judges, so settled, so sworn, that there can be no oppression, but they of
necessity must be accessory, since if they neither deny nor delay us Justice,
which neither for the great nor little Seal, they ought to do.

The greatest person in the Kingdom cannot continue the lest violence upon the
meanest. But this security, Mr Speaker, has been almost our Ruin, (this
Bulwark) for us has been turned, or rather turned it self, into a Battery
against us, and those persons who should have been as Dogs to defend the
flock, have been the Woolves to worry it.

These Judges, Mr. Speaker, to instance not them only, but their greatest
Crimes, have delivered an opinion, and a judgment, the first in an
extrajudiciall manner, and both upon an extrajudiciall matter, that is such as
came notwithin their cognizance, they being Judges of Law, and not of
necessity, that is being Judges and neither Philosophers, nor Politicians, in
which, when it is absolute, and evident, the law of the Land seaseth, and that
of general reason and equity, by which particular Laws at first were framed,
returns to her Throane and government, when salus populi becomes not only
su^rema, but sola le^, at which time, and to which end, whosoever would
dispense with the King, to make use of money, dispenses equally with us, to
make use of his, and one another.

1 In this judgment, first they contradict both many, and clear Acts and
Declarations of Parliaments, and those in this very case, and in this very
Reign, so that for them, they needed to have consulted with no other Records,
then their Memories. 2 Secondly they contradicted with apparent Evidences, by
supposing mighty and eminent dangers, in most serene, quiet and halcyon days,
that c^uld possibly be imagined, a few contemptible Pirates, being our most
formidable enemies, and there being neither Prince nor State, with, and from
whom we had not, either Ambassadors, or Amity, or both. 3 Thirdly, they
contradicted the writ it self, by supposing that supposed danger, to be so
sudden, that it could not stay for a Parliament, which required but forty
days stay, the writ being in no such haste, but being content to stay seven
months, which is that time four times over.
Mr. Speaker, it seemed generally strange, that they who saw not that Law,
which all men else saw, should see that danger, which no man saw, but
themselves, got, though this begot the more general wonder, three other
particulars begot the more general indignation.

1 The first, that all the reasons for this judgment were such, that they
needed not those of the adverse party, to help them to convert these few, who
had before the least suspicion of the Legality of that most illegal writ,
there being fewer who approved of the judgment, then there were that judged
it; for I am confident they did not that themselves. 2 The second that when
they had allowed to the King the sole power in necessity, and the sole
judgment of necessity, and so enabled him to take from us, what he would, when
he would, and how he would, they yet contemned us, enough, to offer to persuade
us, that they had left us our property. 3 The third and last, and which J must
confess moved me most, that by the transformation of this Kingdom, from the
estate of free Subjects, (a good Phrase Mr. Speaker, under Doctor Heylins
favor) into that of villains, they disabled us by legal and voluntary
supplies, to express our affections to his Majesty, and by that to cherish his
to us, that is to Parliaments.
Mr. Speaker, the cause of all the miseries we have suffered, and of all the
jealousies we have had, that we should suffer more, is, that a most excellent
Prince, has bin most infinitely abused by his Judges, telling him that in Law,
his Divines telling him that in Conscience, his Counselors telling him that in
policy, he might do what he pleased: with the first of these we are now to
deal, which may be a good leading cause to the rest, and some in penning those
laws, upon which, these men have trampled, our Ancestors have showed the
utmost of care and wise dome, for our unsettled security, words having done
nothing, and yet done all that words can do, we must now be forced to think
of abolishing the grievers, of taking away this judgment, and these Judges
together, and of regulating their successors by their most exemplary
punishments, who would not regulate themselves by most evident laws; of the
degrees of this punishment, I will not speak, I will only say we have accused
a great person of high Treason, for intending to subvert our fundamental
laws, and introduce arbitrary government, where is what we suppose he meant to
do, we are sure these have done, there being no Law more fundamental, then
they have already subverted, and no government more absolute, then they have
already introduced. Mr. Speaker, not only the severe punishment, but even the
sudden removeall of these men, will have a very large effect, in one very
considerable consideration, we only accuse, and the house of Lords condemns,
in which consideration they usually receive advise, (though not direction from
the Judges: And I leave it to every man to imagine how prejudicial to us,
(that is to the Commonwealth) and how partial to their fellow-malefactors,
the advice of such Judges is like to be, how undoubtedly for their own sakes
they will conduce to their power, that every action be judged to be a less
fault, and every person to be less faulty, then in Justice they ought to be.

Amongst these, Mr. Speaker, there is one whom I must not lose in the crowde,
whom J doubt not, but we shall find when we examine the rest of them, with what
hopes they have been tempted, by what fears they have been assailed, and by
what, and by whose importunity, they have been pursued, before they consented
to do what they did, J doubt not I say, but we shall find him, to have bin a
most admirable Soliciter, though a most a bominable Judge, he it is, who not
only gave away with his wealth, what our Ancestors had purchased for us, at
so large an expense, both of their time, their care, their treasure, and their
blood, and employed an industry as great as his injustice, to persuade to
join with him in that deed of gift, but others strove to root out those
liberties, which we had cut down, and to make our grievances mortal, and our
slaverie irreparable, lest any part of posterity might want occasion to curse
him, he declared that power to be so inherent in the Crown, that it was not
in the power, even of a Parliament to divide them.

I have heard, Mr. Speaker, and I think here that Common Fame is ground enough
for this House to accuse upon, and then undoubtedly enough to be accused upon
in this House, they have reported this so generally, that I expect not you
should bid the name whom you all know, nor do I look to tell you nevves,
when I tell you it is my Lord Keeper, but this I think fit to put you in
mind, that his place admits him to his Majsties ear, and trusts him with his
Majesty's conscience, and how pernicious every moment must be to us, whilst
the one gives him means to infuse such unjust opinions of this house into his
Majesty's ear, expressed in that libell rather then declaration, of which many
believe him to have been a Secretary, and the other puts the vast and almost
unlimited power of the Chancery into such hands, which in the safest would be
dangerous, for my part, I can think no man here secure, that he shall find
himself worth any thing when he rises, whilst our estates are in his breast,
who has sacrificed his Country to his ambition, whilst he had prostituted his
own conscience, has the keeping of the Kings, and he who has undone us
already by wholesale, has power left in him of undoing us by retayle.

Mr. Speaker, in the beginning of this Parliament, he told us, and I am
confident every man here believed it, before he told it, and not yt more for
his telling it, though a sorry witness is a good Testimony against himself,
that his Majesty never required any thing from any of his Ministers, but
Justice and integrity, against which if any of them have transgressed, upon
their heads, and that deservedly, it was to fall, And truly after he has in
this saying propounded his own condemnation, we shall be more partial to him,
then he is to himself, if we slow to pursue it.

If therefore my just and humble motion, that we may choose a select Co^mittee,
to draw up his and their charge, and to examine the carriage of this
particular, to make use of it in the charge, and if he being a Judge, shall be
found guilty of tampering against the public property with Judges, who has
thought tampering with witnesses in private defenses, worthy of so severe a
Fine, if he shall be found to have gone before the rest, to this judgment,
and to have gone beyond the rest in this Judgment, that in the punishment for
it, the Justice of this House, may not deny him that due honor, both to
preceed and exceed the rest.
