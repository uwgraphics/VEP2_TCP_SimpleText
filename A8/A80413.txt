What the INDEPENDENTS would have: or a Character declaring some of their
TENANTS, and their desires to disabuse those who speak ill of what they know
not.
BEing called to the study of the great Controversy of this age, many years
since, by an occasional residence with some, who dissented from the Church of
England, concerning Independency of Churches, I stood as stiflly as I could,
for Episcopacy: I read with a single eye Master Ainsworth, Master Jacob, Master
Robinson, Master Johnson, and every Book else I could find of that subject Pro
and Con, as concerning the Kingly office of Christ Jesus to be the only point
worth studying; and when the points of their arguments stuck so close that I
could not answer them, I grew angry (the Lord lay it not to my charge) and held
a fair correspondency with the Church of England, in all the Ordinances, so
long as I could possibly get leave of my conscience so to do; and the question
truly stated, is but this; whether the inventions of men ought any more to be
mixed with the Institutions of Christ in his Kingly Office, then their good
works in his Priestly Office; which I am confident ere long, will be as much
out of question, as whether the Protestant or the Popish be the true Religion,
whereof I hold it altogether impertinent to discourse, it having been so
clearly vindicated by learned pens. But because there is a great noise made,
what would the Independents have? They never yet told us their desires; the
poor children are kept fasting all day, and then some rigid spirits like the
cursed stepmother (to whom they dare not speak for fear of a flap on the
mouth) quarrel with them; why, what would these untoward children have? Is any
body troubled with such paltry Rascals and harlotry baggages as I am? These
scurvy children make me weary of my life, when as she knows, well enough, it is
bread that the children cry for. I shall tell you in a word what will content
all the Independents in England; it is this; they desire neither more nor less,
then what the Puritans desired of Queen Elizabeth, and King James; viz. an
entire exemption from the jurisdiction of all Prelates and Ecclesiastical
Officers, other then such as themselves shall choose, and to be accountable to
the Magistrate for what they shall do amiss, submitting to the Civil
Government in all things; and to be liable to all taxations that by law are
chargable upon persons of their condition, not holding any opinions destructive
of State-polity, not having a natural tendencie to disturb the peace of the
Kingdom, as all seditious practices have: but otherwise to be as free to choose
their own company, place and time, with whom, where and when to worship God, as
they are in the choice of their wives; for a forced marriage will not hold.
This I say will satisfy all that go under the name of Independents, which
name and the word Presbyters, as it is used, I wish they were extinct and
buried: If there must be a distinction, I wish rather they might be called
Conformists and Reformists; but to give you an account of some of the Tenants
of him that is properly and singularly called an Independent by way of a
Character.

He is one that judges every man in a happy condition (though he hold many
errors) that believes in Jesus Christ, and is content to be every man's
servant, so as Christ may but reign over his conscience: which if he should
not, he knows not where he is to reign; he holds a subordination of Officers
in the same Church, but an equality in several Congregations; which as sisters
depend not upon one another, but are helpful as one hand to another; as God
has ordained a paritie and eminency in power between several Kings and
Princes, and that one ought not to invade the others Sovereigntie, not
excepting against the consultative, persuasive, and deliberative Synod, but the
ruling Synod that shall command any thing, Imperio voluntatis, by a
Pythagoricall authority without demonstrating any utilitie or advantage to
accrue thereby; and therefore an Independent is he, that depends not of any but
Christ Jesus, the Head in point of Canon and Command for Spiritual Matters;
but is dependent upon man in all Temporal Matters absolutely, and for
Spirituals by way of advise and counsel, it being an Article of his Faith,
that every man must be saved by his own faith, and knows no Medium between a
reasonable service and an Implicit faith; He counts the Royal Law of Unity
amongst honest men to be the supreme law of the most noble Descent, to which
all inferior orders of Uniformitie must do homage, as the Ceremonial Law to
the Moral, loving every man that has any thing of Christ in him, or common
honesty, and would not have Discipline breed disaffection. Concerning the
Discipline of Christ's Church, does no more depend upon man then the doctrine;
and counts it the most glorious Light in the World to see Jesus Christ walk as
King, ruling by the Scepter of his Word in the midst of his golden
Candlesticks. He is ever privy to his own infirmities, being far from
dreaming of perfection in this life, therefore does not separate from mixed
communions, because he thinks himself too good, or better then his neighbors,
for he thinks himself the greatest sinner, being most privy to the
deceitfulness of his own heart,, and is sure he has more errors then he can
discern, nor is it because he would displease any man, but because he dares not
displease God, for he is fully persuaded it is a sin in him to do otherwise.
He thinks no man will be godly, unless he will promise to be so; therefore
wonders that any Christian should speak against a Church Covenant, which is no
more then to promise to do that, by Gods assistance, which the Gospel requires
of him, yet will not say that it proceeds out of a desire of carnal liberty,
or contempt of the ordinances; for rigid censures seldom lodge in meek and
humble breasts; he esteems protestation against practice, prevarication; as if
Bilhah had said, though I lie with Reuben, my heart is honest to my husband;
for one acre of performance, is worth a whole land of promise. He is a
professed enemy to all imperative, co-active violence in matters of conscience,
which are not an offense against civil justice, and thinks that to force men
to come to Church is but to make them hypocrites. He cannot be content with an
inferior accommodation for his soul, when he may have a superior, going to
the Ordinances to meet Jesus Christ there, and to hear good news from heaven:
he desires to find him in the fullest manner, but is not of so strong a
constitution as to fast till authority settle a form of worship. He holds the
Word and Sacraments not to be the constitution of a Church (no more then the
Law is the Commonwealth, or the axe the house) but the means and instrument of
constitution, and counts him the only extravagant man that flies from reason,
which makes all men so noble: he is of an opinion that the far greater part of
men in the Kingdom believe, that an honest, upright meaning will win heaven,
and hope so to live, as by their good works, Prayers, and good meanings to be
saved, and therefore does not conceive these men to be visible members of
Christ's body, and consequently not to communicate in the distinguishing
Ordinances; He thinks it ill done to enforce any under penalties to receive
the Sacrament, possibly to seal up his own condemnation; he is for every
reformed Church, so far as it is reformed; but says many Scotch Ministers
complain, that things are not thoroughly reformed with them; he counts it
licentiousness, not Christian liberty, to affront those that be in Authority,
and never speaks any thing against the National way of worship, but to
justify his own, if called thereunto. He will not be beaten but by Scripture
weapons; and in reading Scriptures, neither stretches things wider, nor draws
them narrower then God has made them; he holds persuasion to be the Gospellary
way, and that liberty of Religion to all Protestants, is the bond of Religion
against Papists; he believes the community of the faithful in appearance to
be the immediate receptacle of all ecclesiastical authority, and holds
Non-communion with Churches, when one Church after fasting and Prayer, shall
tell an heretical company that it appears, they are in the state of damnation,
as Heathens and Publicans, and better a millstone were hung about their necks
then to give such just offense, to be as effectual to attain the spiritual
end, as Excommunication: He is sorry that Brethren should fall out by the way,
being all animated by one Spirit, as the body by one soul; but is glad that
himself is not the least cause of the disagreement. He thinks spiritual
diseases must have spiritual cures, and thinks it is no proper way to confute
an Heretic, to break his head with the Bible. He is one that desires to live
lovingly with all the World, and loves most where he sees most of God; he does
not so much desire that Jesus Christ should love him, because he knows he
loves him already, nor that he should love him more, because he knows he
loves him enough, but that he might love Christ and love him more; and he
joyn^s himself in Church Fellowship, not to gain Heaven, but to witness his
love to Jesus Christ, and desires to love himself no farther then he finds the
Image of God renewed in him.

He counts it a great honor and security to Protestants to join all as one man
against Popery, and desires heartily a Union with our Brethren the Scots, which
he conceives may very well be without a Uniformity, which is a condition for
the Saints above fully enlightened; he thinks Religion is ab eligendo, as well
as a religando, and that the French Protestants are cordial and sincere, that
may either go to Mass or to Church, as they please. He conceives a moderate
Presbytery, such as men cannot except against, in point of Reason or
Conscience, is best consistent with the happiness of this Kingdom, and why
should not moderate men be content with a moderate Discipline? He loves an
honest Presbyterian better then an dishonest Independent, and believes that the
want of Morality excludes from Heaven; he believes that this Army would fight
as heartily for the State against Popery, or any that should do them wrong, as
ever they did for the Liberties of this Kingdom; and desires that the
Parliament and Army would grant as much to the City of London, as may possibly
consist with the safety of the Kingdom. He freely forgives all those that rail
against him in Pulpits, and prays that God would make such Ministers more
zealous to advance the power of godliness then their own power.

He desires to learn the truth with all diligence and humility, and if for the
present he be in an error, he hopes all good Christians will excuse it,
because it proceeds from a desire of all possible purity in a Congregation; as
if a servant be over diligent, thinking to please his master, by doing his
business too well, no ingenuous man would blame him. He judges him the best
Commonwealths man that will suffer much himself, when it may conduce to the
public peace, and that is most forward to go in a way safe for the Kingdom,
though dangerous to himself: and him the best Christian that studies Truth and
Peace, yet so, as a Union of hearts rather then a vicinity of Houses, is to
make up a Congregation according to the New Testament, then which he conceives
his way no Newer.

Concerning the Errors of the times, many whereof pretend from weak
judgments, but strong affection to Jesus Christ, he thinks all this smoke is
not without some fire, but because the common enemy, the Papists, have more
differences among themselves, lest our jarring should be their music, he
desires we may spend our wits upon them, and our charity upon one another; and
if all truths be seasonable, he conceives that the Assembly sitting so long
before they agreed upon any thing, was a great occasioner of them; they kept
the Kingdom too long fasting, as if all men had been of a like strong
constitution, whereas passengers to heaven are in haste, and must walk some way
or other; and he that has gone far in a Wood is loath to turn back though he
be wrong; so dangerous is it to procrastinate in their matters, and very rare
for a man to confute himself. His practice is to baptize the children of one or
both believing parents, as foederally holy; the contrary opinion of some
Anabaptists, or Antibaptists make him study Scripture in piety, and devotion
more; there being neither express precept nor example for it, and the
correspondency of the Seals under both dispensations more, and possibly that
may be a truth, which for want of light, he conceives to be an error; if it
be an error it is a very harmless one, resting there, and cannot disturb the
public Peace. If an Antinomian doctrinall do not prove an Antinomian
practical, he thinks some of those opinions are very comfortable, and learns
hereby, not to exalt duty too much, but to study free grace the more, and
believe that the Doctrine of Justification and satisfaction, have never been
more clearly taught then by them that have been so called. He hopes Seekers
find the way to Heaven, yet counts it sad that any should wait for new
Apostles (they may as well seek a new Gopel,) and that those Ordinances which
Christ has purchased with his precious blood should be counted shadows, much
derogatory to his love and wisdom; yet he suspects his own heart, and thinks
that possibly some men live at a very high rate in spiritual enjoyments, being
wholly at rest in God, and have the less need of Ordinances, and for those that
think the Saints are here in full perfection of grace and glory, his sinful
heart tells him it is an error; yet he will not judge any tree to be evil but by
its fruits. He knows no hurt in a million of millenary-like errors; who would
not be glad to see Jesus Christ? That Christ died for all, he judges to be a
great error, for then all must be saved, or possibly none may be saved, yet
there are prudentiall reasons and motives for it, as the Papists have for good
works; if not meritorious, why commanded? If he dyed not for all, why is he
preached to all? Yet the maintainers aim is thereby to honor and exalt Christ
which is the great design of the Father, and thereby his greater study and so
by different opinions he learns to do things upon clearer principles, and so
to walk in love and peace, as seeing him who is invisible, and knows no
reason, why their brethren (by the good leave of the maof the family, and
Parliament) may not live lovingly together.

He thinks it very absurd that Popish Bishops should ordain Ministers, as if
the sheep should have no shepherds, but such as the Wolves appoint; the rather
for that the Apostles did not abridge the people of that liberty of choosing an
Apostle, much less may a Synod deprive them of choosing their own Officers.

He desires no Toleration for any Errors against Religion or State-policie,
but of some errors in Religion which do not raze the foundation, conceiving
liberty to be the best means to cure all such differences, and that the Sword
has no capacity to settle Religion being not sanctified to that purpose; and
if imprisonment cure an heretic, it is but like his curing an enemy by letting
out the Impostume, when he thought to kill him; for mystical Wolves are to be
killed mystically; and therefore marvels that any politic Christian should
oppose his desires, for why may not he which five years since was for Bishops,
considering the wheeling vicissitude, and revolution of things, five years
hence be an Independent. He thinks compulsion is the only way to make
Hypocrites, and if Church Papists were ever accounted most dangerous, he
wonders why men should be forced to go to Church.

He thinks it strange that Christians should have most wars who can least
justify them, but conceives it is for want of liberty of conscience. The Turk
has more color to come with three or four hundred thousand men to invade
this Kingdom, because we are not of his Religion, then one Protestant has to
persecute another. And he verily believes that if every man might take his
Religion upon choice and trial, thousands would be saved which dye securely,
making no question of their salvation. He thinks it is a soloecisme for
Ministers to bid men search the Scriptures, when they may not profess that
which they find to be true. He finds that this Kingdom has had little peace
since the Bishops banished men into New England, where Independencie has bin
so far from being the root of evil, as it has cured Schisms and Heresies. He
conceives the rigid Presbyters are notable Politicians, to put the Parliament
between themselves and the envy of the people, for they do but untie the
points, and deliver the party to the Magistrate to be whipped; as the Papists
do, who put Protestants to death, because Protestants delight in persecution,
but wishes they would be moderate if they intend to last, for the rigidness of
the Bishops was their ruin. He does not find any punishment in Scripture for
tender consciences, and by that politic Law which puts Idolaters to death,
their cattle also were to be destroyed. He would gladly conform to the
present government, if he had his conscience at command, in his own power, and
knows no reason why carnal professors should oppose liberty, but because they
desire not to be troubled about Religion, but have it put into their mouths by
authority, which they hope will stand between them and harm. He conceives
variety of opinions in circumstantials, is, but as one star differs from
another; difference in hearts cannot hurt, nor difference in heads need not
breed difference in hearts; and understands not why Covenants should be made to
repair Castles in the air, and since the moderate Disciplinarians agree that
every congregation in America has entireness of jurisdiction, intrinsecally
within it self, he wonders that any man should hold, that Churches are in
worse condition where the Magistrates profess christianity, or that it is not
a favor that corporations may determine differences within themselves; but he
looks not at the likelynesse of the means, but Christ's institution, who is
only King of the conscience, and conceives that all the world has no more
power over the conscience then a Tinker has, which can be no disparagement to
say, that a stone has as much life as the Sun. He conceives that Mat. 18.
Tell the Church, are very plain words, but that learned men have inve^ted
distinctions to make them intricate, and that Christ has entrusted the keys,
to hang rather at his Spouses girdle, then with the Stewards, and that a
Churches censure being ratified in heaven, there can be no appeal on earth to
any other Church.

He conceives that such a liberty will wonderfully indeare all conscientious
men to the Magistrate, the King and Parliament; will gain the hearts of the
people, without which all obedience will be uncordiall. Compulsion can no more
gain the heart, then the fish can love the fisherman. As for those arguments
of disorder and confusion, the two Theological Scar-crows: he conceives they
are but imaginary, vain fears, yet have been so drunk with the blood of the
Saints, that like Lycurgus Vines, he would never have them more urged; for an
Heretic is but to be rejected, and as Luther said, to be burnt with the fire
of charity, nor should we send them to hell who give no signs of repentance.
He is an irreconcilable enemy to tyranny and popery, and it is the joy of his
heart, that God may have glory, though in his confusion. He counts every godly
Presbyterian to be his dear brother, but not to be preferred before the truth.
He conceives that whosoever is above his brother in spiritual matters (unless
empowered) is a pre ate; and the only way to make the Assembly more victorious
then Alexander, is, by reason and gentleness to conquer consciences without
blood. He conceives that Magistrate, in probability, to be more religious, that
will suffer diffring opinions consisting with the public peace, then he that
Haman-like will have all to bow and stoop to his sheaf; and that all the wars
in Christendom have sprung from this one depraved principle, to suffer no
opinion but his own, for how can truth appear but by argumentation? He thinks
it a sin either to follow an erring conscience, or to do against it, but to
oppose it the greater sin, for he that will do the least sin against
conscience, is prepared in disposition to do the greatest. He marvels any man
should hold Independencie not to be Gods Ordinance, and yet a national
Assembly to be Apostolical, which is most Independent. He thinks there are
many Deer without the pale, straying sheep without a fold, and when all is
done, there will be wolves within; and lambs without; but think that to honor
Christ is to do his will, and is most troubled to consider how one sheep should
bite and persecute another. He believes the government of the Church, lies upon
the shoulders of Jesus Christ, and that the Pope may as well maintain a
Priesthood under the Gospel, after the example of Aaron, as that Magistrates
may punish different opinions after the example of the godly Kings of Ifrael
and Judah, who were types of Jesus Christ, and directed infallibly; and yet
suffered Herodians, Alexandrians, Saduces and Pharisees; unless the errors be
of a moral and capital consideration, that may endanger the peoples welfare.
He verily believes that the ardent endeavors of the godly Presbyterians and
Independents, are to conserve the Ordinances in purity, and purging of the
Church from scandal, and would fain believe that the difference between them
is but small, that the union may be the more easy, and sees it most
apparently, that the interest of all honest, godly men is wrapped up in a speedy
union, to love one another entirely, though of different judgments, otherwise
Gods people are likely to be in a worse condition for their liberties then ever
they have been.

He has ever been a faithful wel-willer to King and Parliament, an enemy to
all oppression and cruelty, a real friend to speedy justice and urbanity, and
thinks he is no good neighbor that desires it should only rain in his
Garden; he thinks all the delight in this World without the liberty of his
conscience, is a burden intolerable. And judges Christ's Kingdom to be only
there where his Laws are in force: for that County is no part of a Princes
Dominion which is not regulated by his Laws. He is a homager to King and
Parliament for the exercise of a good conscience, not to beg liberty from man
to be a Christian, nor to settle the divine right of worship, but to be
protected in the free exercise of it: he cannot act contrary to his light
received without manifest ruin of his own soul, nor practice (but by the
Magistrates permission) without apparent hazard of his person and family,
therefore entreats all Christian spirits who have any credit with the
Magistrate, and have felt the weight of an oppressed conscience, to mediate for
him, as Men, Christians, fellow sufferers, and fellow-helpers. Some think it
the greatest miracle in the world, that any generation of rigid men should be
so unnatural to kill their own fathers, and persecute their own brethren, who
but lately suffered with them: but concludes that superstition is an
unreasonable thing, and that Pride and Covetousness in some men, are enough to
make a man of the Indians mind, by any means, not to be of the Spaniards
Religion. He marvels any man should be an enemy to tender consciences, the
want whereof is the plague of this wicked world, and that rich man that cannot
feast till his poor neighbors have bread to eat, has a tender conscience. He
knows no Injustice in an error, or opinion, and marvels why believers should
contend about the faith, which they have already and can never lose, and thinks
it far better that Protestants, who in a Parish are of three opinions, should
rather have three several meeting places, then fight and live in perpetual
jars with one another; therefore reckons Liberty of Conscience to be Englands
chiefest good, because nothing else can procure love and peace; for did God for
the safety of a sheep dispense with his own law, and are men so Wolvish to
prefer an inferior Law of uniformity to the royal law of love, which is the
life of a Kingdom? but men may ruin themselves, they can never ruin the
truth. He thinks it a very uncivil part, for any man not to yield to a civil
government, but in matter of opinion thinks it misery enough to refuse Christ
Jesus and salvation, and that to tie up the outward man, unless he be
turbulent or unjust, is a reformation for dogs and bears. He thinks it is but
dissembling for young people to contract themselves, and after ask their
friends consents; to fast and pray for that which is already resolved upon, and
believes that never did any bloody Bonner persecute any man under the notion of
a Saint, but as an instrument of evil, or disturber of the State.

He thinks it strange that none but in office may preach, and yet one may
preach to get an office, and how Beza, who was never ordained, could ordain
others, but he thinks there is less need of an accessory solemnity then of the
peoples salvation, and marvels why a man may not greach by his tongue as well
as by his pen, the rather for that Jehosaphat sent to his Princes to teach in
the City of Judah. Princes have preached in Geneva and Lairds in Scotland* not
to be a Minister without an outward calling, but having an inward call, to
preach to edification, though the line of ordination were never stretched over
him; he thinks him not zealous of men's salvation, that murmures at all men's
preaching that are not fashioned in his shop, and wishes that Me^chants would
send men to preach Jesus Christ to the Indians, as well as Factors, for he
thinks the true interest of England is the Protestant cause, to be as zealous
to advance that, as the Spaniard is for popery. He thinks it impossible that
the civil peace of a Kingdom should be broken, unless the Laws be violated;
and how Lillies should scratch, and Lambs tear Wolves, and Doves persecute
Hauks, and Virgins scold, are things that lie very remote from his intellect.

He thinks nothing more hinders a reformation then taking things upon trust,
not supporting authority by solid reason. He wishes that every ingenuous man
would disclaim all practices (specially in matters of law) that are against the
law of true reason; a confident adherence to authority, and a ready prostration
to Antiquity, preferring old Errors to new discoveries of Truth, being prime
causes of all injustice and oppression, as if an Argument from Authority were
any proof to a wiser man; a Generation of rigid Formadists making Religion
overthrow it self, by destroying mercy and Humanity. It Is well for many
scandalous Railers, that he is a man of a peaceable spirit; and all the hurt
that he wishes to the Kingdom, is, that Independents were the worst men in it.

He draws his sword for public Liberties, which being substantially settled by
King and Parliament, and secured, He will gladly sheath it, and say, The Lord
has done all; and hope; that no ingenuous man will envy him those Liberties
which were purchased for him by the blood of Christ, knowing that a Communion
in Unity will be a glorious supplement to the rent of Uniformity, which may
seem strange for a time, but will quickly be embraced by all honest men. A
solid Reason will at any time convince him, and he loves to read discourses
which are rational, therefore to charge him with wilfulness and obstinacy is
a supercilious and censorious severity, if not an uncivil and unchristian
offense: for God is the searcher of all hearts. To whose grace and goodness,
he commends the courteous Reader.

FINIS.
