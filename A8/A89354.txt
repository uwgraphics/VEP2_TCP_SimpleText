The most Deplorable Case of the Orphans of the City of London.
WE have these Ten Years last past attended all Sessions of Parliament, humbly
Imploring your Compassions, (for the Redressing the unexpressable Wrong we have
sustained by the City of London, taking and keeping our Properties from us by
force) this Honorable Assembly being the True Representatives of our
Protestant Nation: We come with humble Confidence, believing your Honors will
not send us away Starving; we find by long and doleful Experience, That the
Court of Aldermen have secretly, and last year publicly opposed the Wise and
Just Proceedings of this Honorable House toward our Relief, we cannot but
humbly hope that this August Assemhly, will be pleased to exert your own
Prerogative in Extercating us from the Intolerable Grievance we Groan under;
We poor Fatherless Ones, being the Only Subjects that no Law yet extant can
Relieve, the City having both Power, and our Portions, to defend themselves and
thereby Ruin us.

We humbly beg for Gods sake, who hears the Cries of the Fatherless, that your
Honors will not please to let any more time elaps, but keep the day that is
now appointed for our speedy Relief, that so no more of the Lives of Orphans
may be lost, through Necessity and Want, which many have done since last
Sessions; We tremble to think so much of this Sessions is spent, and that your
Merciful Inclinations toward us, have yet had no Effect.
