HUmane nature is covetous of novelties; never had that Axiom so pregnant
proofs as in these days; never were the people so appetitious of news; never
were their desires so answered with diversity of Narrations; and to say truth,
never were there broacht so many false and improbable relations: every man
speaking according to his fancy and wishes, and diverse sons of audacity and
impudence, confidently committing many illegitimate conceptions of their own
to the public view, which have no more affinity with truth, then the opinions
of Copernicus, of the motion of the earth, or that relation of our Countryman
of the new world in the Moon, or of Domingo Gonzales and his flight thither
upon the wings of his Ganzas: But this abs^re, good wine needs no bush: veritas
non quarit angulos, our present discourse needs no preface to excuse it, being
a positive and confirmed truth: on Tuesday last, All Saints day, destined for
holier uses, Prince Robert, with his well beaten troops, after they were routed
in the late known battle by the Parliaments forces wearied with their
flight, and bleeding with the wounds they had received there, sought to refresh
themselves in the pleasant and plenteous County of Buckingham, in which all
things exuberate that might please their appetites, or satisfy their wants
(that Country being most odious to them, cause most faithful to the
Parliament) they left no expressions of their hostility and rapine unperformed
soldiers (especially wanting ones) wishing no better place for plunder then a
^ich and fertile Province, till they arrived at Ailesbu^^, a town one of the
most signal and wealthy of that Shire, where Prince Robert with some ten
thousand horse and foot, on T^^sd^y morning, about six of the clock entered to
the great amazement and fear of the honest inhabitans, who little expecting
such a sudden greeting from the Enemy, were unprovided for defense, the
faithful M^ of that good town, being unable to make resistance against such a
multitude of half desperate men, made a virtue of necessity, and gave them a
free entertainment; the chief Magistrates there knowing it was, Prudemiae
multum dissimulare, affording them good words: and to give the Devil his due,
there they remained in indifferent peaceble disposition, till some of Prince
Roberts scouts or horse sentinels, upon the spur came in, and with a sudden
alarm, gave a speedy and dreadful notice to their General, that there were
great and formidable forces approaching the body of an Army, as their fears
made them conjecture, of at least six thousand men, when as since it was
certainly known, and credibly astirmed they were not above fifteen hundred
men, or thereabouts, under the command of the valiant, Sir William Belfore,
sometimes Lieutenant of the Tower, and now Lieutenant General of the present
forces for the defense of the kingdom, under his Excellency, the Earl of
Ess^x, who after the late battle, were sent by the said Earls careful
directions, to advance through the neighboring Counties, and to secure their
safeties, there being nothing so requisite and full of commendation in
general, as to consider distant dangers of his friends and confederates, with
the same eye he looks upon those which are present, and threatening himself:
for that end therefore was Sir William Bels^re sent forth, who investigating
the Enemies passages, had certain intelligence, that Prince Robert, with some
of the prosligated troops, was returned into Bucking hamshire, and had sixth
their place of rendezvous at Al^sbury; whither with all convenient speed the
said Sir William made, knowing that delays in affairs military, as in all
other actions beget dangers, with his fifteen hundred men, being six horse
troops, and the foot part of Colonel Hampdens, and part of Colonel Granthams
Regiments, which were the army of six thousand foot and horse, which the
Sentinels gave information to the Prince, were then invading him at not half
an hours march distance, with which alarm, not affrighted, but a little
troubled, he prepared not for his defense, but to give them the bein, or the
mal venu (take it as you please) to Alasbury, leaving, lest the townes-men whom
he durst not confide in, should fall upon his rear, a troop of horse, and two
companies of foot there in perada to secure the inhabitants, where, when they
heard of their friends, approaches, were all unmindfull to act their parts on
that Theater of war for their own safeties: active spirits forces young men,
like Lapwings, to run out of their nest, part of the shell ye^ sticking to
their temples; so it has done with this Prince Robert, whose fiery soul has
rendered him too great a stickler in this kingdoms quarrels, but he having
drawn forth his Companies into one entire body, without the town, he espied
within a quarter of a mile the Parliaments forces, which were as ready to
charge him, as the Prince was them: but their wise and prudent Chief, Sir
William Belfore, knowing that hasty attempts beget dangerous and uncertain
successes, kept them in, facing the Prince with a narrow body of horsemen, his
troop being drawn out like a Pyramid, sharp at the top, and broad by degrees
in the gross. Prince Robert with his own troop, the flo^er of the Cavalry,
charging through Sir Will. Belfore his front: and thinking to make us find as
easy passage through the rest, Was bid to a bloody dinner in the heart of his
squadrons. The florsemen there being at least ten broad in rank, thundering
death from those engines of destruction, their Carabines and petronels into the
bosom of the Princes Soldiers, who neither knew well to advance nor to
retreat. Another Troop if I mistake not, young Master Pyms (the hopeful Son
of an excellent father, charging them hotly in their right flanks, so that
Prince Roberts mauger his native courage was at his non plus ultra, till Sir
Lewis Dives a man of as much acrimony and spleen as any of the malignants
against the Parliament: fell in pell mell to the princes rescues: having
behind each of his horsemen a musketier, who being at competent distance,
alighted and diffused their dreadful and death bearing bullets through our
squadrons, which then began to totter from their order, some ten or fourteen
falling in that furious charge: till Captain Herbert Blanchard, Captain of
the Earl of Peterborromes Troop came in with much courage to the aid of Sir
William Balfores Troop, and the foot forces on our side having gained both
wind and sun, sent cheerful vollyes of fire, smoke, and bullets, on the left
flank of the Princes squadrons, the horses gald with the shot overthrowing
their riders, And the Soldiers of our foot taking fire from their resolved
Captains, animating each other to an assured conquest: Commissary Willmot who
all this while had stood as a reserve to the Princes Forces, then falling into
this game of blood and slaughter, reduced the Conflict to an equal scale,
killing some threescore of our men, when Sir William Balfore who leaving his
own Troops to the charge of his Lieutenant, had retired into the rear of his
horse and brought them up to the face of the Enemy, our foot in the interim
wheeling about, came in upon theirs with a full charge, beating them from their
stations, and disordering their ranks. They sent at least two hundred of their
men to salute the earth never more to rise thence. The Prince all this while
made good the fight against Sir William with his horse till Commissary Wilmot
receiving a shot into the shoulder, They began to shock together, and as it
were to retreat: when the flight of their foot, who began to use the virtue of
their legs: drive them, spite of Prince Roberts fury, to bear them Company
and outstrip them at their own exercise of running away: that Troop and those
two foot companies advancing forth of the town to the relief of their
companions were undertaken by Captain Ascoughs Troop and some foot forces,
till the Townes-men near being rid of their unwelcome guests, to the number of
two hundred well armed, charged them upon the backs, then they fell into an
appatent rout, following their flying fellows, our horsemen having them in the
chase, they did execution on their foot fon the space of a miles riding:
killing in the chase and the fight to the number of six hundred men, most of
which were the infantery their Cavalry escaping by the benefit of their Horses,
found the Proverb verified, one pair of legs is worth two pair of hands.
Prisoners of the common sort there were taken two hundred; of note, not any but
one Dudley Smith a young gentleman of much courage, who died some hours after
of his wounds received in the battle: of our part there fell about fourscore
and ten persons: too great a number to be lost, yet gloriously they did being,
as it were, their Countries Martyrs. Sir William Balfore after his victory,
marching to Alisbury, spent the rest of that day in prayers and thanksgiving
for his good success, to that great God of battles, in whose dispose is
Conquest, and by whose almighty and and out sirecched arm, this victory
arrived to his servants, Prince Robert with his flying Troops, as it were, in
revenge of that overthrow, burning the poor Country villages in his retreat
toward Oxford, where it is reported he is: and whence shortly it is hoped,
he and all those perverse malignants will be brought to condign punishment.
Thus it has pleased the Lord of Hosts to give victory to the Parliaments
Forces by an handful, if compared with the Enemies numbers: In his power it is
to fave with few, as well as with multitudes. To him therefore we ought to
ascribe all praise, trusting that he will deliver us from all our enemice.
Amen.

FINIS.
