THE SPEECH Of the Right Honorable Sir THOMAS LANE, Knight Lord Mayor Elect For
the CITY of LONDON, At Guild Hall, upon Michaelmas-day. 1694.
GENTLEMEN,
I Acknowledge your extraordinary Respects in Choosing Me to Serve You in the
Highest Station of your Government.

I am very sensible of my own Unfitness for so great an Employment, and could
have much rather chose a Retirement; but since you will have it so, I shall, by
God's Assistance, apply My self to the Work you have called Me.

And for the carrying of it on, I will take the best Advice and Direction of my
Honored Brethren of the Court of Aldermen; and, on every emergent Occasion,
call in the Assistance of your Representatives, the Common Counsel.

And, Gentlemen, I desire your most Free Access unto me at all times: For what
Bylaws you will have Made, or Repealed, I will readily call a Common Council,
as often as you shall desire.

One thing I must beg of you, That as I shall always Design and Endeavor
nothing but the Public Good, so let my Actions receive a Favorable
Construction; and think me not so unworthy as to employ the Power and Trust you
have invested in me, to your Prejudice.

I shall be ambitious to follow my Worthy Predecessor in all the Good Ends of
Government, though I despair of coming up to his Great Example.

If Emulation be Commendable upon any Account, it must certainly be upon so
good a one, as doing the Best Service for the Greatest City in Europe, and for
such Fellow-Citizens as have in the Worst of Times exposed Themselves to the
Greatest Dangers for the Defense of their Religion and Liberties.

May the same Noble Principles still inspire you with a True Zeal for God, your
King, and Country; and may the Glorious King William and Queen Mary always be
Happy in the utmost of your Affections and Assistances, that the Tranquillity of
this City, and of the Nation in general may Flourish.
