The Manifesto or Declaration, wherein the Roman Imperial Majesty makes known
to the States and Peers of Hungary, what reasons and motives have compelled
him to proceed in open War against the Prince of Transylvania, etc.
FERDINAND the third by the grace of God Elected Roman Emperor of Germany,
Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia and Sclavonia, King, Archduke of Austria,
Duke of Burgundy, Slyria, Karndten and Craine, Marquis of Moravia, Count of
Tyroll and Gortz, etc. To all and every one of our well beloved and loyal
Prelates, Nobles, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, and all other States and Peers of
our Kingdom of Hungary and other Provinces belonging thereunto, Greeting.

With what fatherly care ever since we begun to enter into our Royal
Government, we have continually strived, that this our here before much
afflicted Kingdom of Hungary, as a wall and Bullwark to Christendom in these
modern heavy troubles and distractions, might be preserved in a good
condition, peace and tranquillity, is not unknown to any of our loyal Subjects
of the said Kingdom: to which end also in these latter years we have of set
purpose entered into peaceable treaties with the Turk, and admitted nothing
that has been advantageous and serviceable to the preservation of a firm
peace, safety or tranquillity of the Kingdom. But in the mean time the Prince
of Transylvania, George Ragoczii, unknown to Us, what has caused and moved
Him hereunto, has suffered Himself to be seduced, that, though We for our
part have given unto Him not any cause or occasion hereunto, He notwithstanding
has entered into a most dangerous and most pernicious league with Our enemies
the Swedes and French, that He thereby also might highly endanger this Our
Kingdom of Hungary, which hitherto through Gods mercy has sat in peace and
quietness, and draw, and involve the same in this heavy war, wherewith
diverse Countries in Christendom are now overwhelmed, yea so far also, that
presently in the beginning of the aforesaid league He did not stick upon it to
pawn by way of promise His two sons, that all the days of His life He would
further and advance with all his strength and power the profit, welfare and
benefit of the Confederates; whereof the letters and treaties, that passed
betwixt Them by Gods special mercy and providence are come to Our hands and
are still with Us in original: By which principally and most clearly
appears, with what earnestness, as also with what high promises, and
presents, as well also through persuasion of the Ambassadors of Our public
enemies and Rebels, He has solicited the Turk for His assent and
approbation, that He first of all might invade Hungary, and then afterward
some other of Our Countries, subdue Our loyal Subjects in a Warlike manner,
extremely afflict them, and thereby disturb and destroy the common peace and
tranquillity: He has tied and bound Himself also so fast to His Fellow
Confederates, that neither He, nor His Successors, neither the States and
Peers of Transylvania, nor also the Inhabitants of Hungary, that take His
part, shall have any power to enter into any treaty with Us or conclude any
Peace or cessation of Arms without the knowledge and consent of all the
Confederates, promising withal, not only to introduce into Hungary the
Swedes, and their hostile Army, but also to deliver over into their hands
certain places, especially our Cities of Tirna and Presburg, which places are
ordained for the preservation of the Crown of the Kingdom, insomuch that highly
is to be feared, that thereby the glorious and precious treasure of that
Crown, which hitherto has been preserved and protected with so much blood of
the Hungarians may fall into strangers hands and be transported over sea into a
strange Country. That He also may involve this Kingdom, and Himself yet deeper
into this heavy fire of war, He did not stick also upon it to promise, that as
often as Our enemies should be invaded in a warlike manner, as often He
together with His Confederates should be bound to take up arms, and faithfully
to assist them, as necessity should require: He declares Himself thereby
further, that His principal desire is to fall upon Us and Our loyal Subjects
in a warlike manner, and to join with His forces to the enemies forces in the
Kingdom it self. All which and yet much more largely appears, as well by the
Articles of the league, (the acceptance and confirmation whereof the said
Prince with much opportunity desires of both the Crowns France and Sweden) as
by the Princes, Master Bisterfields, and other our enemies letters. Whereby the
most pernicious design of the said Prince is come to light how He namely
forgetting all duty to the Native Country intends to kindle a fire to the ruin
of the Country, to disturb the Common peace and tranquillity of Our loyal
Subjects, to set the Transylvanians and Hungarians by the ears together for to
destroy one another themselves with their own swords, and thus to draw the
Hungarian Nation, which in former overthrowes has already been weakened very
much, into a Civil War, and to the shedding of their own blood and of their
own kindred. Hereby appears also the great ingratitude of the aforesaid
Prince of Transylvania to Us and Our Illustrious House of Austria, from which
His Predecessors have received great benefits and privileges, whereas they
were not only raised from a low condition to Honor and Dignity, but also his
Father Sigismund Ragoczii was richly rewarded, and had bestowed upon him large
dominions and lands, yea this Prince himself had bestowed upon him the most
rich and fair Dominion of Monchatz, and other presents: But to pass by all
these things, yet contrary to all Divine and Humane right, his faith, troth,
corporal oath, and his own bonds and obligations (wherein He more then once
bound Himself to Us and Our Crown) He has entered with others in an agreement
and league, as well to the great prejudice and damage to His own Countrymen
and Hungarian Nation, as to Our and the Kingdoms, yea also the Countries of
Transylvania: And first against Our selves, whereas He has promised to invade
in a hostile manner not only Our Kingdom of Hungary, but also others of Our
hereditary Countries and Kingdoms, and to conquer them: And then also against
the Hungarian Nation it self, because the rising of an Inlandish Prince and the
taking up of arms will produce nothing else but their utter ruin and
destruction: Further also against the Kingdoms Rights, and Privileges,
whereas He has sought to include the inhabitants without their knowledge and
consent in his secret league and confederacy, and under a pretense of their
names to make agreements: No less also to the prejudice of the Country of
Transylvania it self, which by these secret treaties and agreements with Our
and the Crowns enemies He purposes to make it wholly subject and hereditary
unto Himself. For He has brought the two Crowns France and Sweden so far,
that they have promised to protect by force all his Heirs and Successors in
the Principality of Transylvania, albeit long ago a free election was promised
to the Transylvanians.

Herewith not yet being satisfied, the said Prince has labored with all his
strength, and considerable presents and sums of money to annull and to make
void the peace with the Emperor of Turkey, (which has been hitherto obtained
with so great charges, pains and so much blood, and hitherto also with much
ado preserved) and to move the Turks to the breaking thereof to the hazard
and great damage of the Kingdom of Hungary, and his own Nation. Of all which
calamity, as also shedding of Christian blood, ruin of the Country, hazard
of Hungary, and other inconveniences, which use to rise and spring out of the
like insurrections, there is no other cause but the private affections and the
Princes untimely pride and haughtiness.

As for Us, We protest before God and the whole world, that to these troubles
We have given no cause to the Prince, but that We seek and desire nothing else,
but the preservation and upholding of Our Royal Right, (which We have received
from God) and protection of Our loyal Subjects, which God has put to Our
trust, and that to all these things We are provoked and forced. Declaring
further, and withal assuring all Our loving and loyal Subjects and
Inhabitants of the Kingdom, that by this taking up of arms, and introduction
of a succor of German forces We aim at nothing else, but that after driving
out of all Our enemies, and laying down of arms, ye be reduced, your former
peace and tranquillity, and thereby all States and Peers of the Kingdom may
continue without diminution in the enjoying of the Rights and Privileges.

And hereupon We graciously admonish and exhort all our said Kingdoms,
Prelates, Earls, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Cities, Provinces and Frontier
Towns, as also the Heyducks and Soldiers, that they will continue firm and
steadfast in the loyalty and obedience which next unto God they owe unto Us and
the Kingdom of Hungary, and not take part under any title or pretense with
the said Prince, much less yield to his obeisance, but rather valiantly take
arms in hand, oppose Him in all places and times, beat Him back, and thereby
show unto Us with unwearyed care and with undaunted courage all due obedience.
But if there be some, that hitherto being compelled by force or fear have been
fickle in their loyalty, and adhered the said Prince, those we will receive in
favor again, and accuse them of no disloyalty, if they do turn but in time,
come away from the adversary party, yield again to Our due obedience, service,
and loyalty, and present themselves to our trusty and well beloved the Right
Honorable Count Nicalao, Esterhasi of Galantha Palatine of our above named
Kingdom of Hungary, or to our Military Generals. But those that will not
observe neither the Divine Justice nor the due obedience toward their King,
but go on in their obstinacy, and boldness, adhere yet further to the Prince
not depart from Him, and thus neglect their obedience toward Us, those shall
be Proclaimed public enemies to their native Country, and that they shall fall
into our Imperial disgrace, and by force of our arms be severely punished
according to their demerits. But the States and Fellow Members of the Country
of Transylvania, with whom We and Our Kingdom of Hungary by many treaties of
peace and firm leagues are tied fast one to another, We admonish of their
faith and troth, and obligations in writing most graciously, that they will
wholly abstain from all hostility against the Kingdom and our loyal
subjects, and in no way undertake to invade our Countries, but rather keep
firm the agreements, and thus not draw upon themselves a ruinous war, and
involve themselves perhaps merely in regard of their private profit, favor or
hate into the most dangerous tempest of war, which storms as yet heavily at
Christendom. For we perceive, that principally in regard of force and fear of
their Prince they are fallen into these troubles out of which they may easily
escape again, if they do turn but without delay, and by laying down of arms
return home to their own and betake themselves to peace and quietness, and
then all their transgression and fault shall rather be ascribed to the
oppression of their Prince, then to their several contrary opinions and
inclinations.

Given in our Austrian City of Vienna the 23. day of February in the year of
Our Lord God 1644. Of Our Reign of the Roman Empire the eight, of the
Hungarian and the rest the 19. But of Our Bohemian the 18. year. Ferdinand.
