To the Right Honorable the, etc. The Humble Petition, etc.
Humbly shows,
THat whereas we your Honors poor Petitioners, having most lamentably served
more then a Pentarquie (even almost the time of an Apprentiship) to the Lunary
profession (or Art Mad-cap) wherein we have been so miserably proficient, that
Herostrates Franciscus Gaticus, Balthazar de Castro, Diego Engrenis, and even
Adam Bolacius himself (so celebrated by Antiquity) were but mere novices to
us; we do outstrip in mad humors all our Predecessors; whatsoever mad
exploits have bin reported as done heretofore, to ours will hold no parallel;
we have exceedingly surpassed all the mad shavers, mad Companions, mad Blades,
mad Rognes, mad Rascals, mad Toms, mad Maudlins, mad Besses, and mad-caps what
or whosoever: How we have justified the premises in these late past years,
has been sufficiently, and if it be possible, more then apparent to all
Christendom; England was the Theater for action, and the gazing (and admiring
world) the Spectators; were ever any of our Predecessors so frantic, as to
engage Lives and Fortunes in as unnatural war against an unequalled virtuous
King, our dread, undoubted, and Anointed Sovereign? Were ever Turks, Tartars,
or Caniballs, so barbarously inclined as we have been, making no esteem not
difference between blood and blood; kindred or alien? Has not the father
murdered the son, the son the father; brother has ( Gaine-like) killed
brother, the uncle slain his nephew, and the nephew his Uncle, and thought
they had done good and godly service? Have we not been so frantic, that
without any legal consideration or suspicion of eyes or thoughts; we have
madly dislocated a principal Joint of our Parliament (and indeed next to the
head) and yet we are so consoperated in our Lethargy, that we have not so much
as mentioned it for a fault, and that is the Places and Vo^es of the Bishops,
for ever since Parliaments have been used in England, all till this present)
have consisted of Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the House of Commons, but
now these spiritual Lords (which are the Bishops) are not once named (nor
thought on) and yet we pretend for a legal and complete Parliament, is not
this extreme madness? what is, if this be not, when such a notorious thing
as this is, shall pass by (and through) so many eyes and ears, without taking
notice of?

In the next place, have we not madly thrust out of doors our ancient and
Orthodox Faith, and both willingly and foolishly lent our hands to pull in
unheard of Novelisme, Fantastic profanation, and even Mimicie in Divine
Worship? We have translated the Episcopal Cathedra, to the Cobblers Chair;
the Doctors Pulpit, to the Coopers Tub; the East and West end of the Church, to
the Tailors Tables end; and the Weaver, (whose shuttle runs through his
brains as well as his Loome) takes upon him to be a wrester of Gods Word (out
of its proper sense) because it shall be like himself, void of good sense:
The Plebean will be a Predicater of highest Mysteries; and the Sylvestrick
Swain is become a Reverend Rabin of Revelations.

Nay, moreover (Right Horrible) we your poor Petitioners are so egregiously
infatigated, and so strenuously infatuated with the preposterous vain of
Diabolical zeal, that to blaspheme God seriously, and rail against our
Sovereign sincerely, has instead of Atheism and Treason, been accounted
(among us spiritual mad people) for Religious duties; our women (a thing
unexampled in any precedent age, whom the Apostle prohibits speaking in the
Church) are grown so impudently mad, that they assume the office of Preaching;
so that it well appears (Right Horrible) that between the Incubus and the
Succubus, (those male and female Devils) these Predicating Tradesmen, and
these dis-illuminated women were begotten; and although Humphrey thinks the
time too long to be barred from Jones bed, for the month of her lying in, but
makes use of (in the intrim) his double-diligent Nurse, or his Neighbors wives
assistance, under the pretense of a tolerated Gandermonth, yet he (and indeed
all we mad people) thinks it a small matter to separate gracious Charles and
Mary, not for a month, or months, but for whole years; what madness ever
equaled this? What Spirit but the Devil can dictate such horrid and
mischievous thoughts as we have been possessed with (and hope to be dispossessed
of by your pious endeavors?)

We old men and women, whose age should admit of no noveltie, are as far
intoxicated with the supine Sallad of this illiterate Lettice, that forgetting
all antiquity (and the example of our prudent Predecessors) we have (as being
indeed turned children again) as greedily sucked in the Milk of Schism, and
overthrow of Government, as the youngest addle brain of them all. We of the
middle sort (of men) have madly armed our selves, madly marched into the Field,
madly waged Battle, madly killed one another, not regarding (as before is
mentioned) either Proximity, Consanguinity, Affinity, Alliance, Christianity,
Vicinity, or Natural Affection. We the women, both old, middle aged, and
young, have with our tongues been as active (as men with their hands) to draw
the cords of ruin upon the whole Nation, as if we had been to persuade all
Christendom to take up Arms (against Christ's) and our common enemy the Turk.
We the younger sort of men, Boys, Apprentices, and Striplings, (especially in
and about the Cities of London, and West. Villages adjacent, and Lines of
Communication, have madly put our selves forward by the notion and example of
mad, blood-thirsty Reformadoes and Commanders, to set the said City, and
consequently the whole Kingdom on a flame of a new and most horrible
destructive war.

Briefly (right Horrible) we your Petitioners, of all Ages, Sorts, Sizes,
Sexes, Sects, and Complexions, have madly involved our selves in an (almost)
universal Lunacie and Apostasy from God and our King; from Religion, to
Sensuality; from Virtue, to Vice; from Chastity, to Lubricitie; from
Christian Charity, to Heathenish Cruelty; from Unity, to Singularity; from
Piety, to Hypocrisy; from Verity, to Vanity; from Humility, to Superbitie;
from Moderation, to Ostentation; from the right understanding of Divine
Mysteries, to blind Zeal without knowledge; and from the Path of Heaven, to
the Ways of Hell, eternal Death and Destruction. This our deplorable
Condition, be pleased with your Power and Charity rightly to consider; and
weighing in the Balance of your unquestionable (and infallible) Intelects,
every Part, Parcel, Branch, and Bud of the premises, vouchsafe to let our mad
Petition find as favorable access to your Honors, as many Petitions (in the
like nature) have found heretofore: The sum of all our desires is, that you
will take into mature consideration (and commiseration) That whereas a great
multitude of people, of both Sexes, commonly called Mad people (but nothing
near so Mad as we) are confined in an Hospital, between Bishops-gate-street
and More-fields, vulgarly named Bedlam (or Bethlem) that you will be pleased to
turn them out into the wide world, and let us (for so many as the said
Hospital can contain) to be possessed of their rooms: for indeed the case is
plain (and therefore considerable) that those people (for the most part) grew
distracted through super-abundant Love, not finding a r^ciprocall
correspondencie in affection; but (wretched) we are Mad through superabundance
of Malice, we most madly and desperately hating, maligning, abusing (both with
Tongue and Hand) a gracious, loving, merciful, pious, and prudent King (the
mirror of Monarchs and example of Princes) who all this too long time of our
hayre-brayn'd Distraction, has wooed and invited us to his Highness love,
patiently expecting the returning of our Senses to their offices, and us to our
just obedience: but all to little, or no purpose; we were madly resolved, and
so went madly on, to our own and the hazard of the whole Kingdoms Ruin.

Furthermore, be pleased to take notice, that the said Hospital being very
small (in respect of our vast number) to give a charitable Purge to all the
Prisons in and about the Cities of London and Westminster, the Villages
adjacent, and Lines of Communication, and also to all other respective Prisons
throughout the Kingdom of England and the Dominion of Wales, wherein are most
unnaturally and cruelly enclosed and detained many honest, sober, wise,
discreet, religious, and virtuous Knights, Esquires, Gentlemen, and others of
good rank and quality, only (and solely) for their integrity and loyalty
to God and his Anointed; these we would likewise (by the aforesaid Purge) have
relaxed, discharged, and restored both to their Liberties and Livelyhoods, we
madly possessing their places: notwithstanding the premises, we do desire
(in this general work of Justice and Mercy) to except some who are now in
Prison (among those sober men aforesaid) that are altogether (if not madder) as
mad as the maddest of us all, and chiefly (as the Chief indeed) John
Lilburne, who being a mad Lieutenant Colonel already, we desire to make
Commander in Chief of all our Mad multitude.

Lastly, when by these Chains of Affliction we shall be restored to our lost
Wits, that then you will be mildly pleased to accept of a sober Petition for
our lost Rights, Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Privileges, all which we
(miserable mad people) have purchased with the loss of our Wits, and Loyalty,
and some of us, Lims and Livings.

This if your Wisdoms shall think convenient to grant, it will be a Beacon to
your Charity, a Lantern to your Lenity, a Mirror of your M^rcie, and a
Trumpet to your Fame; and we your poor Petitioners (as in duty obliged)
shall be ever beholding to your Clemency, and always pray for your increase
of Grace, and Loyalty toward God and Caesar, and an equal, legal, and
charitable distribution of all the Wealth which you (by your Wit and Subtletie)
have gotten of us foolish Mad People, etc.

A Postscript concerning the deliverie and Receipt of the foresaid Mad Petition.
No sooner this Petition came unto
the hands of those to whom it was presented,
But all of them (as well the high as low)
began to rave; Thus being discontented,
They gave this Answer: Why, you frantic Elves,
Sue you to us, who are stark mad our selves?
Have you not danced after our mad Pipe?
have we not been examples to you all?
Think you, if that our wits were sound and ripe,
we could our selves stand by, and see you fall?
No, no, Plebeians, we will no further wrong you,
We are as mad as he that is made among you.
Yet be you comforted (and so are we)
hoping we shortly shall our wits recover;
We something now regard his Majesty,
so let the people do all England over:
Then, by Gods Blessing, (to our joy and gladness)
We shall see England cured of her Madness.
By th'influence of that bright Northern Star,
which now auspiciously upon us shines,
Mad England shall regaine her wits so far,
that all shall praise his Name, who thus inclines
The hearts of Subjects to their Sovereign Prince;
O such a Cure, Mad England lacked long since.
FINIS.
