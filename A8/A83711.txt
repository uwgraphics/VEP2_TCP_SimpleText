The Humble Petition Of the House of Commons.
IF Charles thou will but be so kind
To give us leave to take our mind
Of all thy store.
When we thy loyal Subjects find
Thou have nothing left to give behind.
We Will ask no more.
First for Religion it is meet,
We make it go upon new feet,
I was lame before.
One from Geneva would be sweet
Let Warwick fetched home with his Fleet,
Weel ask no more.
Let us a Consultation call,
Of honest men, but Round head all,
God knows wherefore.
Allow them but a place to bill,
Against Bishops Courts Apocryphal,
We Will ask no more.
Let him be hanged that Surplice wears,
And Tippet on his shoulders bears;
Wr^g^ of the Whore.
Secure us from our needless fears;
Let Prin and Burton have their ears;
We Will ask no more.
Reform each University,
And in them let no learning be;
A great eyesore.
From thence make James Arminians flee,
Should any have Free Will but we?
We Will ask no more.
Lest the Elect should go astray,
Let Cobblers teach them the right way,
To Heavens door.
And lest their souls should wear away,
Let them the Sisters underlay;
We Will ask no more.
Next for the Bishops Hierarchy,
Oh the word sounds so scurvily,
Lets hear't no more.
It nere was taught, the Apostles by
Lay Elders may the place supply;
We Will ask no more,
Next for the State we think it fit,
That Mr. Pym should govern it,
He Is very poor.
The money that is for Ireland writ,
Let them have the Devil a bit,
We Will ask no more.
For ordering the Militia,
Let us enact a new new way,
Nere heard before.
Let the great Counsel bear the sway,
If you will give us leave, you may;
We Will ask no more.
In this we will not be denide,
Because in you we will not confide;
We know wherefore.
The Citizens their plate provide,
Do you but bring in yours beside,
We Will ask no more.
Now if you will make Hull your own,
There Is one thing more we must set down,
Forgot before.
Sir John shall then give up the Town,
If you will but resign your Crown;
We Will ask no more.
FINIS.
His Majesty's Answer, to the aforesaid Petition.
I Charles your King will be so kind,
To give you leave to take your mind,
Of all my greatest store.
When I you loyal Subjects find,
And you those Members have resigned,
Which I have asked before.
Or when Religion is all your cares,
And London has such heads of theirs,
As they have had before.
When Warwick from Geneva dares,
New printed bring the ^o^^^n p^^yers,
And read them public ore.
When all your Consultations tend,
To pay what you have made men lend,
God knows why or wherefore.
When you will no more say you will send,
And bring me surely to an end,
I know you will ask no more.
When your Sme^^im^ius Surplisse wears,
Or Tippet on his shoulder bears,
Those rags of Babylons Whore.
When Prin, Burton, and Bastwick dires,
With your good leaves but show their cares,
I know they will ask no more.
When what I have borrowed I shall see
You have paid each University,
Out of the City store.
And Doctors Chaplains Fellows be
Free willers of Plurality,
I know you will ask no more.
When the Elect shall make such have,
By the Brethren to be imorac't
In Tubs behind the door;
When Cobblers they shall preach their last,
All Conventickles on a Fast,
I know you will ask no more.
Whhn Bishops all the house adorn,
And Roundheads for their absence mourn,
A great, a great eye sore.
When every Citizen less scorns,
Lord Wentworths head, then Essex horns,
I know you will ask no more.
When you no more shall dare hereafter,
A needless thing, and gain much laughter,
To ask things granted before;
When Pim is sent to Irelands slaughter,
And nere more hops to mary his Daughter;
I know he will ask no more.
When you have found a clear way
For ordering the Militia,
Which I near heard before;
When Atkinson on the Trayning day,
Should dare his Office to bewray,
I know he will ask no more.
When naught to me shall be denied,
And you shall all in me confide,
There Is reason good therefore;
When Denmark shall for me provide,
And all the Scots be on my side,
I Will make you ask no more.
Last when you shall make Hull my own,
The one thing more I will set down,
Which I forgot before;
When I am got into the Town,
I Will make ten more besides that clown,
Shall never ask no more.

THere dwells a People on the Earth,
That reckons true Alleagiance Treason,
That makes sad War a holy mirth,
Calls madness Zeal, and nonsense Reason;
That finds no Freedom but in slavery,
That makes Lies truth, Religion Knavery,
That Rob and Cheat with yea and nay,
Riddle me, Riddle me, what are they?
That hate the flesh, yet firke their Dames,
That make Kings great by curbing Crowns,
That quench the fire, by kindling flames,
That settle Peace, by Plundring Towns,
That govern with implicit Votes,
That stablish truth, by cutting throats,
That kiss their Master, and betray,
Riddle me, riddle me, who are they?
That make Heaven speak by their Commission,
That stop Gods Peace, and boast his power,
That teach bold Blasphemy and Sedition,
And pray high Treason by the hour,
That Dam all Saints but such as they are,
That wish all Common, except prayer,
That I (...)
Riddle me, riddle me, who are they?
That to enrich the Common wealth,
Transport large Gold to For^^igne parts,
That hous't in Amsterdam by stealth;
Yet lord it here within our gates,
That are staid men, yet only stay.
For a light night to run away,
That borrow to lend, and rob to pay,
Riddle me, riddle me, what are they?
