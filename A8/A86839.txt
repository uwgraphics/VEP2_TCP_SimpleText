LONDON, Printed 1641.

The Humble Petition of the Protestant Inhabitants of the Counties of Antrim
Down, Tyrone, etc. part of the Province of Vlster, in the Kingdom of Ireland.
As it was humbly Presented to the Right Honorable Assembly of Knights,
Citizens, and Burgestes in this present Parliament. And accepted of that
Honorable House.
Your Petitioners,
HUmbly represents unto your grave wisdoms, and juditious considerations,
that your Petitioners having translated themselves out of several parts of his
Majesty's kingdoms of England and Scotland, to promote the infant Plantation
of Ireland, wherein your Petitioners by their great labor and industry, so
much contribute to the settlement of that Kingdom: As they were in a most
hopeful way of a comfortable abode, and when they expected to reap the fruit
of their great and long labor, partly by the cruel severitie and arbitrarie
proceedings, of the civil Magistrate, but principally through the unblest way
of the Prelacy with their faction, our souls are starved, our estates undone,
our familles improverished, and many lives among us, cut off and destroyed;

The Prelates, (whose pretended authority, though by some published to be by
divine right, as we humbly conceive is directly against the same) have by
their Canons of late, their Fines, fees, and Imprisonments at their pleasure;
their Silencing, Suspending, Banishing, and Excommunicating of our learned and
conscionable Ministers, their obtruding upon us, ignorant, erroneous, and
profane persons to be our Teachers, their censuring of many hundreds even to
Excommunication, for matters acknowledged by all to be indifferent and not
necessary, their favoring Popery (in this Kingdom a double fault) their
persecuting purity, and indevouring to bring all to a livelesse formalities,
diverse of them being notorious incendiaries of the unquietness and unsettled
estate between these Kingdoms, with many the like; too tedious to relate, as
more fully in our ensuing Grievances does appear. These our cruel
Taskmasters have made of us, who were once a people, to become (as it were) no
people, an astonishment to our selves, the object of pity and amazement to
others, and hopeless of remedy, unless he with whom are bowels of
compassion work in you an heart to interpose for Your Petitioners relief.

They therefore most humbly pray, that this unlawful Hierarchicall government
with all their appendices may be utterly extirpate, such course laid down, as
to your great wisdoms shall seem meet, for reparation in some measure of our
unutterable damages sustained by the parties thus injuriously grieved; your
Petitioners settled in a way, whereby their persecuted Ministers may have leave
to return from exile, and be freed from the unjust censure imposed on them,
and an open door continued unto us for provision of a powerful and able
Ministry, the only best way to promote Plantation, and settle the kingdom in
the profession and practice of true religion; which as it is the earnest
expectation, so it shall be the daily prayer of many thousands your
Petitioners, who will ever entreat the Lord for your direction herein, and in
all other your weighty and important affairs, as becomes your poor
Petitioners, etc.

A particular of manifold Evils, and heavy pressures caused, and occasioned by
the Prelacie, and their dependants.
1 BEfore they had so much as a pretended Canon, for their warrant the Prelates
urged their Ceremonies with such vehemence, that diverse of our most learned and
painful Ministers for not obeying them were Silenced, and many of us for the
like oppressed in their Courts.

2 In the year 1634. they made such Canons and constitutions Ecclesiastical,
as enjoined many corruptions in the worship of God, and government of the
Church, which exceedingly retarded the work of reformation to the true
Protestant Religion, animated Papists, and made way for diverse popish
superstitions.

3 Our most painful, godly, and learned Ministers were by the Bishops and
their Commistaries silenced and deprived for not Subscribing and Conforming to
the said unlawful Canons, yea, through the hotnesse of their persecution
forced to flee the Land, and afterward Excommunicated, to the danger of all,
and loss of some of their lives.

4 In their places others were obtruded, not only ignorant, lazy, and
lukewarm, but many of them unfound in doctrine, profane in life, and cruel
in persecution.

5 Many, though sufficiently furnished, were not admitted to the ministry,
only for not swallowing down their groundless innovations, yea some, though
conform, yet for strictness in life, were likewise kept out.

6 Good and painful Ministers are not suffered to exercise that function which
God has called them unto, nor suffered to enjoy any living, many livings,
besides those proper to their Bishoprics; and do confer livings upon their
children and retainers, studendi gratia (as is pretended) and diverse Benefices,
as four, five, six, or more upon their favorites; Hence

7 The cure of souls are committed to hyrelings, who receive 5.6, 8. or 10.
pounds by the year for their cures; Diverse of which are put together to the
charge of some illiterate curate, by which means, the people perish for want
of food, though the Parson or Vicar, through connivance of the Bishop is
utterly non resident, and by each one of the many Benefices he injoyeth, has a
competent allowance for a moderately minded man, to maintain himself and
family upon.

8 Whereas the Bishops should give all good example, by painful preaching and
holy conversation, they preach very rarely themselves; and like these in the
Gospel, who will neither enter themselves, nor suffer others to enter, they
have suppressed diverse others from preaching, both on the afternoon on the Lords
day, and in many places where weekly Lectures were maintained, either by the
free will of the Minister, or cost of the people, they have utterly forbidden
the same, and shown all manner of discountenance to those who were forward
therein, so that a Lecturing Minister appeared before them, under more
prejudice then a popish Priest, or undermining Jesuit;

9 Lest those who could not be admitted into the ministry, undertaking to
teach School, should there lay impressions of piety and good learning, they
urge on the very School masters a subscription beyond what is enjoined by
their own Canon, and punish by Excommunication, and otherwise the refusers
thereof; So as the Schools formerly much frequented, are now utterly desolate,
to the spoil of youth and promoting of profaneness and ignorance.

10 Thus whiles they proceed so severely and uniustly in punishing the refusers
to their unlawful commands, though otherwise never so honest and able men,
they favor popery to the continuance, and great increase thereof, Hence,

11 Popish titulary Bishops are by them winked at in the exercise of
jurisdiction from Foreign power; Mass priests are frequent, and pretend a
title to every parish in the Kingdom, Masses publicly celebrated without
controlement, to the great grief of Gods people, and increase of idolatry and
superstition.

12 They permit Frieries and Nunneries to be within their Diocesses, whereby
they continue and increase of late in many places, yea diverse of them suffered
to remain in the very places where some of the Bishops have their special
residence.

13 In many places of the Land where Protestants are forbidden and restrained,
Papists are permitted to keep Schools; unto some whereof such multitudes of
children and young men do resort, that they may be esteemed rather
Universities, teaching therein not only the tongues, but likewise the liberal
Arts and Sciences.

14 They set forth and suffer to be published wicked Libells and ungodly
Pamphlets, tending to sedition, faction, and disunion of the British
Inhabitants, such as Examen conjurationis Scoticae, Lysimachus, Nicanor, etc.
And in their Sermons, Prayers, and ordinary Table-talke, diverse of the Bishops
in matters quite besides their Calling, have not desisted to rail, curse, and
most bitterly inveigh against the Kingdom of Scotland, and all their
proceedings laboring to make them odious, thereby proving themselves
firebrands of sedition between the two Nations; yea, proclaiming their
prophannesse by drinking healths to to the confusion of that Nation.

15 The most learned and seemingly moderate and pious of the prelates,
publicly in Sermons at Dublin, exclaimed against, and condemned the Scottish
Covenant and Religion professed in that Kingdom with most invective terms; And
in the Star Chamber in Dublin, at the censure of Henry Stewart Esquire, his
Wife and two Daughters, and James Gray, for refusing to take an oath, for which
there was no other ground then the Earl of Straffords command, which was
against the Covenant of Scotland, uttered these words; These people with Corah,
Dathan, and Abiram, do withstand the ordinance of God, and therefore I leave
them to the judgment of Corah, Dathan, and Abiram.

16 They have frequently made Symonicall pactions and bargains in the
conferring of Benefices, and ordinarily permit Ministers to exchange their
livings, thereby to nullify Leases of tithes, which the former incumbent
Ministers have let at certain rates.

17 The Prelates have usually appointed such men to be their Commissaries,
Officials, and Registers, who altogether neglecting the punishment of vices
cognizable in their Courts look only to their own gain; Hence

18 Though they pretend themselves the advancers of virtue, and punishers of
vice, yet they usually without further satisfaction absolve the most scandalous
persons for a sum of money, and often question not all such from whom they
privately before hand receive such a sum, which is a cause that many
wickednesses do more and more abound.

20 If any be presented by their Apparitors (who are usually Papists) if it
be but for nonpaiment of the Clerks groat, or not observing some one of their
most frivolous injunctions; yea, though the party presented be not found
culpable, yet they require most excessive and unjust fees; And if their demands
be not satisfied, (though never so great poverty might plead for mercy) they
presently proceed to the censure of excommunication, thus vainly and
blasphemously abusing the high-ordinance of God, so many hundreds of us remain
under that censure, and multitudes constrained to run out of the Land, to the
undoing of them and theirs.

21 The Prelates that they might manage Peter's sword as well as his keys have
some of them procured that most unlawful Writ of assistance, whereby his
Majesty's Officers and Ministers are required to yield assistance unto the
Bishop his Official, or any deputed by him; which Writ is by their Officers
most notoriously abused, and many times put into the hands of their
Apparitours, who under color thereof apprehend honest men and women, casting
them into prison, until they be forced to free themselves by an heavy
composition.

21 They charge Churchwardens with Articles far beyond their understanding;
to every particular whereof, if they refuse to answer or present, then are they
bound to answer for it at Council table, or high Commission court, or both,
and though there acquitted, yet no remedy left them for their great damages.

22 They force Churchwardens to attend all their visitation and circular Court;
And there, for their Articles, Oaths, Admissions, and Discharges, they make
them pay most excessive and undue fees, never before practiced or required.

23 The communications for penance, which either should not be at all, or if
exacted, then set apart for the poor, and other pious uses comes either to
the Prelates kitchen, and Commissaries purse, or both;

24 The Prelates and their faction, as they inherit then superstition of the
Payacy, so of late they exact with all severity the absolute customs of S.
Mary gallous, Mortuaries, Portions, etc. which as they were given by
superstition and used to Idolatry, so now they are taken by oppression and
applied to riotousnesse.

25 They have also constantly practiced and suffered, the buying and selling of
the Sacraments, which is an heavy burden; And where the poor have not to pay
the Minister and Clerks fees, they will not marry them, nor suffer their dead
to be buried.

26 In the high Commission court against all law and equity, they sit as
ludges in their own cause, and take Cognizance of the highest and smallest
matters, going therein without control; Hence

27 In the said Court they usurp with an high hand the judicature of civil
causes, impose Fines, beyond all bounds, and imprison at their pleasure,
whereby many have been utterly undone.

28 They proceed in the said Court, by way of most cruel and lawless
inquisition, not only into men's actions and words, but reaching even to their
very thoughts, in imposing that most unlawful oath Ex officio, to force to
accuse, not only others, but likewise their own selves, contrary to law, and
the very maximees of nature; And if any refuse to take this oath, then are they
imprisoned, and fined beyond measure, to the ruin of all that fall under the
weight of there indignation.

29 Diverse of the Prelates did jointly frame and wickedly contrive with the
Earl of Strafford, that most lawless and scandalous oath imposed upon the
Scottish-Brittish among us, who were Protestants, for receiving all commands
indefinitely; And some of the Prelates were the occasion, that women and maids
should be forced thereunto; Hence Commissions issuing to all places for the
exacting of it, they were persecuted with so much rigor, that very many as if
they had been traitors in the highest degree, were searched for, apprehended,
examined, reviled, threatened, imprisoned, fettered together by threes and
foures in Iron yoakes, some in chains carried up to Dublin, in Star Chamber
fine in thousands beyond ability, and condemned to perpetual imprisonment;
Diverse poor women but two days before delivery of children were apprehended,
threatened, and terrified; others of them two or three days after childbirth,
so narrowly searched for, that they were feign to flee out of all harbor, into
woods, mountains, caves, and corne-fields, and many days and nights together
absent themselves, to the impayring of the health of very many, the death of
diverse, and loss of their goods, which the enemy at their pleasure made
havocke of. These, with many more unexpressible, have been the woeful effects
of the Oath drawn up by advice of the Prelates, and so unjustly pressed by
authority of the Earl of Strafford.

30 The Prelates with their faction have been injurious, not only to the
spiritual, but also to the temporal estates of most men; for under color of
Church lands they have injuriously seized into their hands, much of the best
lands in every County, so that there is scarce a Gentleman of any worth, whom
they have not bereaved of some part of his inheritance, few daring to oppose
their unjust demands; and if any did, yet non able to maintain their just
titles, against their power and oppression.

31 By their ways have they enivated and undone many families, destroyed and
cast away thousands of souls, and moreover in their own persons have been a
scandal to the Gospel, and a stumbling block even to the common enemy, by
their swearing, cursing, drunkenness, Sabbath-breaking, etc. having such
servants usually in their Families, as are most profane in the Kingdom, few
others countenanced by them, but such, and if any seem to be of an holy life,
he is scorned and persecuted by them.

Thus they publishing and proclaiming themselves the children of Ishmael and
E^au, we most humbly beseech you as the true sons of Israel to take order with
them as God shall direct, whom we shall ever pray to be ayding, and assistant
unto you in this great and glorious work of reformation.

FINIS.
