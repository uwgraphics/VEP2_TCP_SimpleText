A DECLARATION Of the Actions, intentions, and resolutions of diverse of the
Inhabitants of the County of Hartford. etc.
AT how deer a rate we have valued our liberties, both in matters of Conscience
and common Right, let our actions speak, and the world judge: as first, for
matter of Conscience, when the Bishops and their tyranizing Clergy and Courts
did vex and torment all honest Conscientious people in our Nation, who did ever
oppose them more than we did? and who did ever appear before us, or with a
greater number in person, with a Petition to the Parliament, for the stocking
of them up root and branch? and what pains we took, and what charge we were at,
with the seeking f^r justice to be done upon scandalous Priests, let the Clarks
books of the Committee for Plundered Ministers speak; and our many weary
journeys to London, with many men and women: And yet if a Priests actions were
never so foul, as his friends were in the Committee, so was his sentence; as
some of us can by deer bought experience witness.

And although there is much said to be done, in the reforming of Religion, yet
we see little fruit of it, for in some Parishes there is Common Prayers still
read to this day, and as wretched scandalous Priests as ever: yea, and those
Priests who cost some Parishes twenty or thirty pounds to cast out A glorious
Reformation.
(were presently admitted to another) yea, and one Parish that had spent above
forty pounds to throw out one base fellow, were by an Assembly-man forced to
have one that had been thrown out three several times before: And those that
have not had such as are so scandalous in their lives, yet at the best are but
ridged Presbyters, who are so proud and covetous that those who could not in
Conscience give them the benefit of their labors, under the name of Tithe, by
the power of a cruel Ordinance, have made their little finger heavier than
their Predecessors loins. And in the midst of this See the Zeal of these
religious men.
Reformation, abundance of Parishes that have not great livings are wholly
destitute of any Priest at all, and we were never yet so far beholden to any
sort of men in power, as to have an Order made for impropriators to allow some
means to help to maintain a Priest in any Parish where there was none, although
the Tyth was worth five hundred pound per annum. No nor so much as an Order for
Although this had been no charge nor loss to themselves.
giving Liberty to those whom God had taught to know himself, and made willing
to teach others freely, what they knew and believed, concerning God, without
Tyth, or other reward. Yea, and all penal Statutes suffered to stand still in
force, whereby many peaceable people suffer to this day. And if God had not of
late days made Jurymen more wise and honest than some other men, they were
like to suffer as deep as ever.

And thus much for our Reformation in that which is called Religion. But the
Apostle James says, Pure Religion and undefiled, is to visit the fatherless
and widows, and to releeve the oppressed, and such like acts as these. And
Christ himself said, His Kingdom was not of this world. He has declared
himself to be the King of Saints, and all such whom he has taught, know his
Voice, and follow him, and dare not follow any other; for they know he has
prescribed them a perfect rule to walk by, and has been very faithful in all
things in his House, more than Moses was, who left nothing undone in matter of
Worship, for any other.

And therefore we conclude, That no civil power in the world, can meddle with
Religion, but they must entrench upon the Prerogative Royal of Jesus Christ.
And for a more full discourse of this point, we referr you to a Sermon of Mr
Dell's, entitled, Right Reformation. Yet we desire such a course might be
taken, as might cherish Virtue, and punish Vice, more strictly than it has
ever yet been.

And for our Common Rights and Liberties, we shall give a brief account of our
actions, and let the world judge at what a rate we valued them: for when by an
overruling Providence, the grand Tyrant Charles Stuart, was constrained to
call a Parliament, although himself and his crew by their Power, intended
thereby to set up iniquity by a Law; yet then we stood it out, in our Election,
against Charles Stuart's interest, as much as any one County whatsoever,
although much abused and threatred.

And when the Parliament came to contest ^i h Charles Stuart about the Nations
Rights and Freedom, from under his Tyranny, who ever stuck more close to them
then we did, both with purse and person; witness our free loan upon the
propositions, some of us borrowing moneys at eight per cent. to lend upon that
account, thinking nothing too dear to recover our freedom from Tyranny and
Bondage; many other that were not worth twenty pounds in the world Who now
would be glad of five to buy them bread.
, did lend ten pounds; and others, if they had no money themselves, if their
Wives had but a Ring or a silver spoon, presently carried it to Guild Hall for
public use, and had no other end in it, but the recovery of long lost
Freedom; and no other ground for it but a Declaration of Parliament; in which
we found Salus populi Suprema Lex; upon which we resolved not to be wanting for
the true establishing of that Law: Yea, and when it came to the contest with
the sword, who ever appeared in the Militia, and who ever opposed the
Commission of Array when it was in our County, more stoutly and resolutely then
we did; although our great men did threaten us with Bullets in our foreheads,
and hanging by the neck, and burning our houses, etc. And many poor honest
hearted men that had not 30 shils. in the world, did spare 20 of it to buy a
Musket in this contest; yea, and found all Ammunition, and hired experienced
men at their own charges, to exercise them in the use of Arms, for the end and
cause aforesaid: And yet this did not rest here, but we sent out a Regiment of
men at our own cost and charges, and maintained them abroad for many months
together: And after this, we did raise three Regiments more, and maintained
them at our own charge, and were upon motion very often, sometimes a month or
five weeks, sometimes more; and all at our own charge, without any allowance
from the State, or one penny abatement in our proportion of Taxes; although no
County in the Land of our quality were at the like charge: Yea and when by
neglect of doing justice upon Charles Stuart and his crew, Kent and Essex did
join with the old Cavaliers and raised a new War, we did not only keep our own
County at quiet, but were as ready to help others, and did never forsake our
first Principles, viz: common Rights and Freedom: And whereas there is great
complaining of parties carrying on the design of Charles Stuart, under the name
of Levellers, we are sure this cannot be spoken by us who never appeared
directly or indirectly in his design. But we declare to the world, that we
would be glad to enjoy what these men's declared Principles hold forth: For
their intentions, if they had any base end, we cannot see their hearts, but are
to judge of their intentions by what is declared in words; for we had nothing
but Declarations to cause us to do all that we have done. And whereas there is
much said to be done in order to the ends declared for, truly we could be glad
we were truly sensible of it. But in answer to what is said to be done, viz: in
taking away his Commissions, Star-chamber-Courts, Ship Money, and Monopolies,
projects and purveyancies, and the Court of Wards To this we answer,
, they were all taken away except the Court of Wards at the beginning of this
Parliament, before any contest with Charles Stuart with the sword, and used as
an Argument to induce us to assist the Parliament against Charles Stuart: So
that it is clear, this is just nothing in answer to our expectatations,
grounded upon the Parliaments Declarations, which were made before these things
were done: And truly this is but a small requital for our service and expense,
this being all paid for before by way of Subsedy. And for the Court of Wards,
we acknowledge it has bin taken away since: But we desire to know if this
becomes those, who say they are, and desire to prove themselves good Patriots
and good Christians in the discharging their trust, to free themselves from all
oppressions that lay upon them, and the rest of the great men of the Nation;
although they know the greatest part of them have bin their professed and
deadly Enemies: And to keep all those, or the greatest part of those that have
adhered to the first declared Parliamentory principles, in slavery to
themselves, and the gaeatest Cavaliers of the Land, by base tenures, fines,
hariots, fealty, homage, etc. and by tithes, and the Laws in the Norman
Tongue; for it is notoriously known, that those that hid adhere to Charles
Stuart, were such whose interest was in the peoples oppressions: And that the
most of those that did adhere to the Parliament, were not great men, but such
as were oppressed by great men, either in Coppy-holds or Tithes; or by the
subtilty of the Lawyers, who Caterpillar-like, eat and devour all they possibly
can, not regarding equity or justice, but how to get money right or wrong. Now
although there is much talking of common freedom, in that book, yet how far
this is off, or short of common freedom, let the world judge: This single Act
of taking away the Court of Wards, being all that can be said in order to
common freedom, and this reaches only the Actors, and the rest of the great
men of the Nation; of which he greatest part are perfect Cavaliers, who make
the utmost use of their power to ruin and destroy all those who oppose their
Tyranny, by imposing great fines upon them, in their Estates by alienation or
decent, even to the ruining of some men's Estates.

And others have found the like from Impropriators, in the matters of Tithes,
who have by Ordinance of Parliament destroyed some of the Parliaments faithful
friends.

We are also left in the like condition for many other oppressions, as the
Norman Laws in an unknown Tongue, and the cruel practice of the same, by
Vipers: as also the towle of Markets, that none may sell their corn, which is
their own, but first there must come Publicans and take away what they please,
to feast some who never take any pains for it.

By what has been said, let the World judge whether this tend to Common
Freedom, or to self interest; or whether it is not an act of grace to the great
Tyrants of the Land, rather then Common Freedom; and whether it is not an act
of cruelty to the greatest part of the People of the Nation, who have spent so
much blood and treasure for the ends before mentioned. And whereas there is
much said about some men's going into Egypt, under Pharaohs oppressions, We
declare to the whole World, that we are resolved never to look back to
Pharaohs bondage again: we confess we are brought into the Wilderness, and
there we meet with hardship and difficulty, but we are resolved for the Land
of Promise, in the power of the Lord of Hosts, and the God of all our mercies
we have already received: and he who brought us from Pharaohs bondage and
Tyranny, we believe will carry us into the Promised Land, where none shall
hurt or oppress or make a prey of us in any kind: and although many (like
Israel of old) when Canaan was to be possessed, gave an ill report of it, and
said, There were Giants, and the Walls high; so now, many say in the way to
Common Freedom, There is the Giants of Self-interests, Lords of Manors, and
Impropriators, and Lawyers now in power, who will never y^eld to let the
People go free: in this we shall like Ioshuah and Caleb rest upon, That God,
who brought us thus near to the Promised Land, to bring us into the possession
of our deer bought Liberties: and though we are now in straits and troubles
in the Wilderness, yet if ever God shall be pleased to raise us up a Ioshuah
to go before us; we mean a New and equal Representative, chosen and elected
upon the grounds of equity and reason, we shall with all cheerful readiness
go along with them, for the attaining all just ends desired and labored for
by all good men. And if any shall say, There is a Parliament already firing. To
this we answer, in our understandings there can be none, for we are sure if
there were, there ought to be some elected by us, to treat for us in things
concerning our Freedom and Liberty, which we sensibly know there is not, and
therefore of necessity we must appeal to a New.

It is also declared in that book, that some complain of, or aggravate the
charge and burden of the Nation, and that there can be no accounts given of
their money; and truly we say, none need to tell us of our burdens or
oppressions that are laid upon us, for they are so heavy, that we feel them
sufficiently; and for Accounts, we believe that those who share the Nations
Treasure among themselves by hundreds and thousands, never intend to give
account for it, unless they are forced to it. It is also said, there are
special Commissions given out to Try some men as Disturbers of the
Commonwealth; At which we stand amazed, that those who call themselves good
Patriots, and good Christians, should (at this time) set up that which at the
beginning of the Parliament was so much cried down for cruelty, when it was done
by Charles Stuart; but truly we declare to those men who sit to do such Acts,
that they would have got as much credit and love, if they had spent that time
to have done some good Action for the Nation, which they spent to destroy
honest men that have stood always for Common good. And taking notice also of a
thing called an Act for taking the Engagement; We declare our resolution at
once for standing against King, or kingly power, we are fully resolved upon the
grounds of reason, that Government being tyranical, vexatious, and very
chargeable; and for the House of Lords, we are the like, for when we had a
Parliament (although the House of Commons made but few good motions for us,
yet) we always found the Lords obstructing and hindering, and therefore we
shall to the utmost, endeavor against them; but to engage to be true to the
Commonwealth as it is now established, we know not what that means; for
Government we see none, but the old tyranical Norman Government, or a
Government by the power of the Sword, which if it continue, is very tedious to
us; but put the case there were a just Government settled, which we see none,
yet in reason we could not engage to stand to it, because we have no men
empowered by us that have bad any hand in making or establishing it, if it
were, for in so doing, we (...) up our whole Right of Election, by consenting
and seting out (...) such a Government as was made when we had no part or
share in the making of it; and by this our resolution is declared concerning
it. We also declare to the whole World, that if ever we recover our Right of
a New Election of a New Representative, for which we engaged against the
chief Tyrant of the Norman Race; We also resolve against all his Creatures, and
never intend to choose one of them more for a Parliament man while we live;
we mean lords of Manors, Impropriators, and Lawyers, whose Interest is in
our oppression, and at this day keep us in bondage like Egyptian Taskmasters,
having by policy and our money, got the Soldiers to decline their promises to
us, and support them. We also resolve never to petition these men more who now
rule over us, nor never to recruit them if they would have us; By this it shall
be known to be a general consent of those expressed in the Title.
