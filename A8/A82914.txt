An Order and Declaration.
WHEREAS the pay of His Majesty's Armies depends upon due satisfaction of the
Arrears of former Assessments, and of the Assessment of One hundred thousand
pounds by the month, now collecting by virtue of an Act for six months,
beginning the Twenty fifth of December last past, and ending the Twenty fourth
of June next, and other Revenues due by Recusants and others; Whereof, if
punctual and timely payment be not made, (though not originally imposed by such
an Authority as was Legal) the Soldiers will be necessitated upon Free Quarter,
to the great oppression of the several Counties: Out of a tender care therefore
to prevent so great an inconvenience to the Country, and discouragement to the
Soldiery, and to promote His Majesty's present service, The Lords and Commons
in Parliament assembled, do hereby Order and Declare in respect of the instant
necessity, there being no other way to avoid the Inconveniences herein
mentioned, that the Commissioners for the Assessment in the several Counties,
Cities and Places by virtue hereof, do proceed effectually for the getting in
of all Arrears of Assessments, and of the Monys unpaid upon the said Act, or
any other Act, according to the proportions and powers therein contained; and
all Collectors and other persons whatsoever, charged with the gathering or
payment of any part thereof, are forthwith (all pretenses and excuses to the
contrary set aside) to satisfy and pay their several and respective
Proportions according to the directions of the said Acts, as they will avoid
such penalties, as will necessarily fall upon them in case of their refusal,
and the further displeasure of the Parliament; And it is further Ordered and
Declared, That all Receivers, and other Officers and Persons, as well Tenants
as others whatsoever, concerned in the Receipt or Payment of any part of the
Revenue, do make due Accounts and Payments of what they and every of them are
charged with, or liable to, as they will be answerable for their contempt and
neglect, in a time when His Majesty's and the Kingdoms service and occasions
requires, the most punctual satisfaction of what is respectively due from them;
And the Receipt of the several Treasurers appointed for the said Assessments,
and the Officers of the Exchequer thereunto appointed respectively, shall be a
sufficient discharge to all Person and Persons that shall make payment of any
Sum or Sums of Money by virtue hereof.

Thursday, 17 May. 1660.
ORdered by the Commons assembled in Parliament, that this Order and
Declaration be forthwith Printed and Published.
