Die Dominico 8 Aug. 1641. Nemine Contradicente, that this ensuing Declaration
shall be printed.
WHereas both Houses of Parliament found it fit to sit in Parliament upon the
eighth day of August, being the Lords Day, for many urgent and unexpected
occasions concerning the safety of the Kingdom, and being so straightened in time,
by reason of His Majesty's Resolution to begin his Journey toward Scotland on
Monday following, early in the morning, it was not possible for to settle and
order the Affairs of the Kingdom, either for the Government thereof in the
Kings absence, or for the present safety, as was requisite: Upon these present
necessities, though the Houses thought it necessary to sit, yet the Lords and
Commons now assembled in Parliament think it meet to declare, that they would
not have done this, but upon inevitable necessity, the Peace and Safety both of
Church and State being so deeply concerned, which they do hereby declare, to
the end that neither any other inferior Court, or Council, or any other
person, may draw this into Example, or make use of it, for their encouragement
in neglecting the due observation of the Lords Day.

Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1641.
