All is not GOVLD THAT GLISTERS; WITH A Vindication of His Majesty from the
scandalous Aspersions concerning former TAXES and SHIP MONEY.

WRITTEN To inform the ignorant, to satisfy the unsatisfied, and to stop the
mouths of all such as carry two Faces under one Hood.



December 29Printed at London, 1648.

All is not Gold that glisters.
IF all were Gold that glisters, a filly Glo-Worme were pure mettle, and Ignis
fatuis, the Moone-shine in the water, or a Blazing-Star would be made into
ingots and wedges, and consequently translated into Coin by out most earned
Astronomicall Star-gazers.

This old Provetb is so full of my sterie, that it has matter enough in it to
make a History: and as it is mystical, so it is sophistical, metaphorical,
and alegoricall, and literally true to a tittle, and an excellent fore-warner
and discoverer of dissimulation; a deadly enemy to Liars, Flatterers,
Iugglers, Traytots, Agitators, Levellers, and a mortal foe to all the pack of
Knaves that carry two faces under one hood, or pretend one thing, and intend
another; that salutes a man friendly in the front, and wishes him hanged in the
rear: of these inconveniences, this Proverb gives you warning; All is not
Gold that glisters.

Caine offered sacrifice, Jezabell fasted, Ahab repented; these made a
glistering show of piety; Joab saluted Abner and Amasa, and Judas seemed to
kiss lovingly; this was all hypocrisy.

Thus did the dross and dregs of vilianie shine and glister; and thus is
King Charles made the most glorious King that ever reigned in England: the
corruscancie and fence-blinding refulgency of those golden promises, misguided
many thousands of people into a fools paradise, like a false light called
William with a wispe, or a Fire-drake, that leads folks out of their way in
the night. These glistering promises were no gold, for his Majesty has too
much tried them, and touched them with the touch store of his hard and
unexampled Afflictions, whereby he has found them false, base, and counterfeit,
mere rottenness, gilded over on the outsides with the varnish and polishing
of adulation and delusions.

Anti-Jessus railes against Antichrist, and Religion is strangely metamorphoied
into snarling; all such as are without the walls of the new many-headed
Reformation, must not live within the Line of Comunication, amongst those
spirituall-gifted Creatures, whose opinions do roll and wheel with the
various humors of Rhewmatick Enthusias^^s, for our long-winded Schismatiques
are (most of them) tongue-swolne with inspiration. It was a custom amongst the
ancient Romans, first to learn to he silent, and after that Lesson was
perfect, then they learned to speak: But a generation of Tautologicall
Tongue-men, have not yet learned how or when to speak, or hold their peace;
these grave ungrammar'd Thebans, and most learned illiterate Athenians, (with
much pumping for wit, and belabouring the cushion) have brought too much gall
to the Pulpit, and such store of worme-wood to the Press, that has drenched
too many of us in the gall of bitterness, and ensnared us too fast in the bond
of iniquity. For as Copernicus imagined that the Terrestrial Globe turned
round with a quotidian vertigo, when it was his own giddie brain that put him
into that whimsey conceit; so these sorts of Phoolosophers are infected with
three strange diseases of body and mind, (namely, Frenzy, Heresy, and
Jealousy) their mischievous imaginations do hold all such as are not of their
Round opinion to be in a dangerous and most desperate condition.

But the wise man says, Ecclesiast. 21. That a wise man's tongue is in his
heart, but a fools heart is in his tongue. So I will conclude this point, That
he that does nothing but talk, does talk nothing.

What a glorious show of Allegiance and Loyalty did too many of his Majesty's
false servants make; but all those fair shows were no better then false
shadows: the Assurance of their faithful duty, was like an Obligation sealed
with etc. they were only tinsel'd over with Oaths, Vows, flattering Cringes,
and dissembling words and gestures: and yet this kind of scurvie counterfeit
Stuff did make an abominable shameful glistring show at the Court; but that
was not Gold that glistred.

Our Blew-bonnetted bonny Brethren did swear by their Souls, that they waud
leeve and dey for the guds of the King and Kingdoms: Those Golden Promises did
glister to us; for which, our Golden Treasure shined on them abundantly,
foolishly, knavishly. We had ungodly false Knaves, and cutthroat Plundring
Thieves and Villains of our own, but our own would not serve our turns; we
were so prodigal to waste our Money, to buy and hire thousands of
Tatterdemalian, mad Raggamuffin, terrible Tarmagant Scots: but now our
after-wit tells us, that we have as sufficient and able Rascals of our own
English breeding, as either Scotland or Hell it self could afford us; so that
our Money which we laid out, was merely cast away: for if we consider what they
did to deserve it, we shall find, that they did us but little good, and much
mischief; all which we could have done our selves, and so have saved our
glistring Gold in our purses. But though we did buy many Scots, yet we did not
buy their Religion and Kirk Discipline: for if we could have bin content to be
Protestants, we would never have bin so mad as to have purchased a Presbyterian
Church Government; nor had they any reason, or manners, to presume audaciously
to prescribe Religion and Laws to us: Let them keep their Doctrine and
Statutes beyond Twede; we have no mind to impose our Rites and Customs upon
Scotland, neither will we receive any from them: As much as their Religion has
cost us, we are willing to lose; and we are contented, if they will take it
again for ha^fe the Money: which they may do with a safe Conscience, for it
is not a Groat the worse for our wearing. Yet we would have them to know, that
we do not write of, or to the whole Nation; we confess, that there are many
thousands Just, Re^igiou^, Loyal, and Valiant persons of that Nation, whom we
do most entirely love and honor.

If the most powerful amongst us were the most peaceful, we might then have
some hope to see some part of our former happiness: But there are a Generati^n
of Peace-haters, who drive a mighty Golden g^istring Trade out of the Ruins
and Spoil of their Country, with the blood and sl^ughter of their Brethren;
these Monsters do make Murder to be their May Game, and cutting throats their
Pastime.

The two great Generals, Joab and Abner, when they met together by the Poole of
Gibeon, they made but little account of the lives of men, when they made sport
with the deaths of 204 at one time, as it is in 2 Samuel 2.13, 14, 15, 16. the
words are these.

And Abaser said unto Joab, Let the young men now arise and play before us; and
Joab said, Let them arise.

Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained
to Ishhosheth, the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.

And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his
fellows side, so they fell down together.

This was the pleasing tragical play before Joab and Abner: and that bloody
sport was much like ours, for they were all of one Country, and one Nation, as
we are. But the gallants of the^e days are so madly desperate, that the name
of Peace in Odious to them; they will daily venture their lives in seeking
their deaths, and hazard the loss of Heaven to purchase Hell; their felicity
is in Arms and most redoubted Deeds, Wars, dreadful Wars, and politic
designs: But all this stir is not to kill Pagans, Heathens, Infidells, Jews,
surkes, or savage Monsters; these bloody Bickrings and surious Slaughters have
not bin, or are like to be, for the glory of God, or making the King glorious,
for the Kingdoms good, for the peoples freedom, for the Laws preservation, or
the liberty of the Subject; These were the promises that glistered like Gold,
which appears now to be mere dross: for the very contrary calamities to all
our forenamed blessings are now upon us; God is blasphemed, in stead of being
glorified; his Word profaned, in lieu of obedient reverence; his Church
despised and dispersed, in stead of honorable and Christian settlement; his
Houses of Prayer pollured and desiled, in stead of repairing and regard; the
King has had a great share of thraldom, and longlasting captivity, which
attends His Majesty in the rooms of Loyalty and Allegiance; the Laws are
trampled down, in stead of being kept up in authority; the Subjects right is,
that no man can be certain to call any thing his own; and the liberty of the
people is bondage and slavery; insomuch, that (as the case stands now) it is a
dangerous thing to be rich, for every man's wealth is his crime; a good estate
will trans form a man into three shapes in short time: first, to a Delinquent;
secondly, to a Malignant; and thirdly, to a Beggar.

To draw to a conclusion, let us think a little upon the King: let us
consider, that disloyalty to him, is disobedience to God; Kings are called
Higher Powers, Heads of Tribes, Children of the most High, high Hills, and tall
Cedars; and therefore God is to be accounted (amongst us) in the first place,
and the King in the second: four ways the King is the Minister of God for the
good of his people; first, he is our Natural Good, in the preservation and
conservation of life and body, by his sovereign Power in maintaining the
Laws; secondly, he is our Moral Good, for that he protects Virtue, and
corrects Vice; thirdly, the King is a Civil Good, in his securing our estates
and possessions: and fourthly, he is a Spiritual Good, in defending the Faith,
and Gods true Religion. All these Goods, good King Charles was, as long as he
had Power; and all, and more then all these, would be heaped upon us, if he did
but enjoy his right Dignity and K^^gly Authority.

As God is our Almighty invisible King, so (by his grace and favor) the King
is our visible God: A King is said to be the Light of Israel; people without a
King, are like sheep without a Shepherd, 1 Kings 22, 17. The Crowns,
Scepters, Thrones, and anoyntings of Kings, are Gods peculiar Rights; and God
is Master of the Substance, whosoever is Master of the Ceramonie: And that God
that made all men, did make some men to be Kings; amongst whom, our gracious
Sovereign Lord, King Charles, is one, and one of the best that ever reigned in
England; and absolutely the best, but the worst dealt withal.

If it were considered how the case stood with him when he came to the Crown,
that consideration would give all reasonable men satisfaction, he was hemd
round about with cares and troubles; first, his Father King James (of blessed
memory) left him deeply in debt, besides great debts he himself owed;
secondly, he had Wars with two mighty Kings, of France and Spain, both at
once and the same time; thirdly, the Coffers and Treasury was low, or near
empt^e; fourthly, the King had no Navy at Sea, nor any means to set forth
one, and the Ships much out of repair; fifthly, the King had no f^wer then
fifteen or sixteen of the Blood Royal to keep and maintain; yet (according
as the time was then, and as it is now) without any great Taxes he paid his
Fathers debts and his own, he secured himself and Kingdoms from soreigne
Invasion, he maintained his great charge, and kept a Royal House, as befitted
the Majesty of a King of Great Britain and Ireland, he refurnished the Navy,
and in that showed his clouded magnificence on the Seas, to the admiration and
astonishment of other Nations: for the effecting of which the Ship Money was
laid upon the people, whereof his Majesty had never the value of one penny into
his Coffers, but it will be easily proved, that he did lay many thousand pounds
to it to increase it, and all was little enough to defrand so great a charge;
which Tax was levied for no other end, but for the honor and safety of the
Kingdom, and to desend those that have sought to destroy the King for doing so
good a work.

Let us with grief of heart call to mind the happiness which we have lost
(which we enjoyed sixteen years) by his gracious government; then we had
peace and plenty, no taking prisoner or being taken, uo leading into captivity
and no complaining in our streets; a man might then (in those days) not have
been ashamed or afraid to be a true Subject and an honest man, he might
boldly say (as I now say) God save the King: which good days and times I hope
are suddenly coming; and so I close up all with, Vive le Roy.

FINIS.
