THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE TREATY Between the KING'S Majesty, and the
Commissioners of PARLIAMENT At NEWPORT.
THe Commissioners came to Newport late last night: This morning (Saturday) at
10. they waited on the KING. The Earl of Northumberland made a short Speech to
His Majesty, who returned answer,

That none could have more hearty desires of Peace then He. How He had nothing
of ill will to any, but indeed was, and would to the utmost, endeavor to
appear a Friend to all, especially to the languishing Kingdom.

The KING desired the Treaty might not begin on a broken part of the last day
of the week, so that to morrow, Gods day, prepares (we hope happily) and
Monday the 18 day at 9 a clock in the morning begins the Treaty.

NEWPORT in Jnsula vectis. September. 16. 1648.
A PRAYER, Drawn by HIS MAJESTY'S special direction and Dictates, for a
blessing on the TREATY at NEWPORT.
O Most merciful Father, Lord God of Peace and Truth, we a People sorely
afflicted by the scourge of an unnatural War, do earnestly beseech Thee, to
command a blessing from Heaven upon this present Treaty, begun for the
establishment of an happy Peace. Soften the most obdurate Hearts with a true
Christian desire of saving those men's blood, for whom Christ himself has shed
his. Or if the guilt of our great sins, cause this Treaty to break off in
vain, Lord let the Truth clearly appear, who those men are, which under
pretense of the Public good do pursue their own private ends; that this
People may be no longer so blindly miserable, as not to see, at least in this
their Day, the things that belong unto their Peace. Grant this gracious God,
for his sake who is our Peace it self, even Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.
FINIS.
