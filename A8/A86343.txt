A HIGH AND HEAVENLY ECHO. Explanatory Verses, containing, as the occasion of,
so cautions for the understanding the following Scripture-Ecchoes.
NIgh to ones house an answering Echo is;
Many have heard it, and they say it is
A Nonesuch Echo, the like not having found,
With some content hearing the same re-sound,
Once, and again, mean while 'twas well remembered
What had long since been out of Pulpit heard;
Another Echo, That God commanded
Seek ye my face, It was returned,
Lord we will seek thy face: not properly,
This then was called an Echo, certainly:
Echo the self-same words, as spoken, does re-sound,
The words which now are here, now there are found:
On this occasion musing, 'twas thought
A Scripture-Eccho, sure might be found out.
Great is (indeed) Gods blessed condescension,
Who teaches man by man, to the same passion
Subject, And in the self-same condemnation,
That men might learn, being taught with much compassion
Not only thus; but God to help man's faith,
Teaches things heavenly by the things on earth.
The print on Wax answers the Seal that made it;
So does Gods grace in man unto the God who gave it.
Or as a face does answer unto face in Glass,
So does man's heart to God, where there is grace.
Men speaking to an Echo, Echo does answer them,
Even so Gods grace in man does answer unto him.
Great familiarity 'twill seem there is
'Twixt God and such men as are nearly his.
That you mistake not then the following Ecchoings,
Observe well first some premised cautions:
What of the Lord is said, with reverence is said,
Not God debasing, but let him be adored:
God being infinite, the distance then,
Is infinite betwixt our God and men.
What Is said by him, he not depending on them,
It Is said, but what is by them's depending on him.
He from himself is what he is to them,
Saints from their God are what they are to him.
God what he is, it is without bounds to them;
What measure men receive, they are to him.
They not beginning thus, and thus with him.
But he beginning thus, and thus with them,
What Is done by God, is done with great perfection,
What Is done by Saints on earth has its pollution.
Reserving thus to God what is due to him as God,
To Gods dishonor dreading to pen a word;
Reading what follows to be read, therefrom
Improvement make (with care) first to inform.
The Lord is not to them a portion, no:
Whose hearts answer not him, Ecchoing so;
But in whose hearts the Lord his Law has put,
They happy are; examine we our state.
As print to Seal, as face to face, and Echo answers;
Does so thy heart to God? if there be grace in truth
It will; if yet it do not, do not thou
Conclude it never will; no, do not so.
The Lord may seize upon thy heart, and make
Thy heart to him, as follows, Echo back.
But as for such as Echo to the Lord,
Answering him according to his Word;
They may not boast: for all the good they have,
Was first in Christ, from him they did receive.
Such thanks should give to Christ, as from a Spring,
From him they have this blessed Ecchoing.
Comfort most safe as well as sweet may such suck out from this,
Who Ecchoing truly unto God, there God they know he is.
These cautions taken as an Antidote,
More uses may be made then here are wrote.
Twelve Syllables at once that Echo well repeateth,
Twelve Syllables in this [ Reader] each line rehearses,

Unto the Tune, as when six Bells are rung.
