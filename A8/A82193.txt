The Declaration of the Nobility and Gentry of the County of Stafford, etc.
ON Tuesday the 4th of this Instant December, most of the Protestant Gentlemen
of the County of Stafford met at Stafford, and after some time drew up the
following Declaration, viz.

His Majesty having issued out Writs for the summoning of a Parliament to meet
at Westminster the 15th of the next Month, the only visible way to preserve the
Kingdom, to heal the present Distractions, to prevent greater, and to procure a
Settlement. We the Noblemen and Gentlemen of the County of Stafford, whose
Names are subscribed, being met this 4th of December, 1688. do heartily wish
and humbly pray, that his Majesty would be graciously pleased to remove from
his Presence and Council, and from all Offices and Places of Trust, Civil and
Military, all such Persons as are not qualified by Law: But in case any such
Persons shall continue in Office or Arms, and by their underminings and
Arbitrary Council, endeavor the further endangering of his Majesty's Person
and Government. We do declare, that we will with our Lives and Fortunes support
and defend the Protestant Religion, his Majesty's Person, the Laws of the
Kingdom, and the Rights and Liberties of the Subject.

In pursuance of this Declaration, some of the Gentlemen of this County are
getting into Arms: Particularly Mr. Lewison Gower of Trentham with about 50
Horse lies this Night at Derby, being on their March to Nottingham to join the
Earl of Devonshire.
