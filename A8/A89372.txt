The most STRANGE AND WOVNDERFVLL apperation of blood in a poole at GARRATON In
Leichestershire, which continued for the space of four days, the redness of
the color for the space of those four days every day increasing higher and
higher, to the infinet amazement of many hundreds of beholders of all degrees
and conditions, who have dipped their handketchers in this bloody poole, the
scarlet complexion of the linen will be a testimonial of this wonderful
truth to many succeding generations.

The most strange and wonderful apperitions of blood, in a Poole at Garraton
in Leichestershire, which continued for the space of four days, the redness
of the color for the space of those four days every day increasing higher
and higher, to the infinet amazement of many hundred beholders of all degrees.
WHosoever shall consider these sad times, wherein not only the son rises
against the father the brother against the brother, and the spirit of
dissension and wary is spread over the whole face of the earth but such
prodigious and wonderful things have apheared as no age before have ever seen
or heard of he must confess that he lives now in the evening of time, and in
the last age of the world, wherein all things do begin to suffer a change.

I will not trouble you with any thing which in this nature has heretofore
been delivered to you: The Sword at Plaist^ flourishing without hands, and the
great Stone clambring up the stairs and whatsoever there is strange or
wonderful are but sluggish miaclous compared to this, which does the raither
prefer it self to your observation, because in the buisnesse of Plaiste there
are as to be seen for the most part but some knavish lights and as it were the
Hocus Pocus of a spirit but in this which now shall be represented unto you the
immediate anger of God in great Charactes of blood is most appearently to be
read.

At Garraton a Town in Leichestershire, not far from Loughborough is a great
pond of water, which for many generations has been known to be there time
out of mind, it is above an Acre on the length, and about an Acre in the
breadth. It was made at first to satisfy the thirst of the Cattle, which from
the commons and pastures thereabouts did daily resort unto it and sometimes it
allayed the drought of the poor and thirsty travailer, but now (as if it were
another element,) it altread both its nature and complexion, for the beasts did
refuse to drink thereof and some few days afterward being passed they would
not come near the water, which the Countrymen and Inhabitants who were owners
of the Cattle thereabouts perceiving they repaired to the pond to see what tht
reason of this strange thing should be.

Being come unto the pond they found the color of the water changed, for it
began to look red, and the substance thereof, was thicker then before, amazed
at the nouelty of this sight they departed from the place, they make a relation
of it to their friends and one neighbor brings in another to behold this
wonderful chance.

The noise is spread over all the Country, and in thronging numbers they make
haste to see it. The water which at the first began to look but reddish, does
now look higher and higher, and as the people came in it did increase in
color. This continued for the space of four days, the Country far and
near (who had notice of it) coming in to be spectatiors of it. It waxed more
red the second day then it seemed at the first, and far more red the third
day then it did of the second, and on the fourth day it grew a perfect sanguine.

There is no wonder in this nature but carries some divotion in it, the people
stand round about the banks of the pond, and from looking on the water they
look up to heaven from whence they believe that the wonder came; with reverence
they discover this miracle of the water turned into wine, but of the water
turned into blood they never heard of that wonder before. Some of them more
hardy then the rest would undertake to taste of it, to understand if it were
already as much in taste as in complexion, but they were severely charged by
those that did stand by them, and were told that they might follow the more
wise example of the beasts for since the Cattle refused to drink of the water
by so doing they would now show themselves more brutish then the Beasts.

The water still continues in its bloody color and had all one standing face
of blood, and with all it seemed so thick that if a high wind had blown it is
believed that it would very hardly at all or else very gently have moved Every
day brought in new observers to behold this admirable poole, and who had but
feeue it the day before could not be content with one days, wonder, but must
come the next day to behold it again.

It was the object of all the eyes thereabouts, and on their return homewards
the subject of all their discourse. The Knights the Gentlemen, and the Ladies
the Peasants, and their Families stood all closse together round about it, and
being overcome with the amazement of the sight there was regard unto degrees or
distinction of persons, and it seems they learned this instruction from the
Pond which they now made use of. That they were all but one blood.

From the observation of the blood they fall into the consideration at last of
the bloody times, where in they live, and being so near to Lough borough they
grow in discourse of how much blood has been spilt by the Lord of
Loughborough his means who being there the great Agent for the King has
robbed many housekeepers in those parts of their goods and their treasure and
which is far more dear to them many of their Childrens lives.

Report in the way is made how many families has he robbed of their fathers,
and how many he has left without their children, they report from the
beginning all the skirmishes that have been made in those parts, and all the
battles that have been fought and all the sieges that have bin laid and raised
and passing from one devovring buisnesse to another, they do curse the
proceedings of the civil war.

The true narration of this water turned into blood may be put into succeding
calanders, and it may be printed in its own rubric, in our days did this
prodigious sight appear and afterward, the crimsin color of the pond did
begin to change, and every day to look paler and paler until at lenght it by
degree* turned unto its first complexion of water the bloody substance sinking
down, and by its own weight settling it self in the bottom of the pond. In
the mean time the rumor of this flying up and down the Country, there being
above one thousand witnesses to justify the truth of it, one Master Neale a
Gentleman of good account living at great Leake in Nottingham-shire, being
travailing on his occasion unto London, and hearing the report of it to be
commonly spoken as he did ride upon the way thought it was four miles out o^
the rod, he resolved to see it and making haste he easily overcome the lenght
of the way, out of a desire to in enjoy the nouelty of the sight being avived
he sat a long time on horseback at the entrance into the Pond musing and
looking on it, (for it was just at that time) when the water did begin to
return to its first complexion and perceving the red substance in the nature
of a filmy body to descend toward the bottom, he did put spurs unto his
horse who did fling back and snorted and was unwilling to go into the Pond,
but after he had forced him to enter a little way into it, and stirred toward
the bottom of the water with his Cane he perceied clots as it were of
congealed blood in great abundance to rise up and having stayed upon the top of
the water for a little space to descend afterward by degrees again.

Not able to satisfy himself with any reason from whence this wonder should
arise, he departed but the Country people resolving to examine and dive into
the cause thereof, they had a meeting amongst themselves for that intent and
concluded at it to have the pond dreyned* It being believed that the enemy had
thrown some Carcasses into the pond to stayne the water, and to bring thereby
some sudden destruction upon the Cattle.

This believe being entertained, the sluice is opened and now the water comes
trumbling forth as if it were glad of its liberty, and was afraid to stay any
longer in the portentous place where before it was in a swift to rent it made
good its passage as if one part were emulation to overtake the other, and the
latter strove with the former for the honor of proceeding. And to perfect the
work wherein some deeper places of the pond, the water stood still, and could
not disadvantage it self into the chennell, the Countrym^n some with scoopes
and some with pailes did carry forth the water, with many hands they overcame
the task which seemed at first almost impossible. And the pond being drayned
and found nothing but fish of which in diverse kinds there were great store, and
those fish seemed still to be very good and nothing the worse for that
miraculous accident which had made red the water. We may learn by this what
God can do who in a most wonderful way can express his power without the
least damage to the Creatures.

Howsoever the pond being drayned dry which may increase the wonder, the blood
in many places was discovered in extended degrees to be like so many scarlet
Carpots on the bottom of the poole, to the unspeakeable amazement of the
beholders, and indeed they may well put wonder on, for though in out own
Chronicles and in other Histories we have read sometimes of Clouds that have
rayned dropes of blood, which though it is very wonderful, yet because
Phelosophers have undertake to give a natural reason for it, it substracteth
some thing from the greatness of the wonder, but this as no cause can be
assigned for it, so no story that I remember can example it, but being as far
beyond nature as example it shows it self to proceed from the immediate
power and the hand of God.

I will not presume to give you the interpretation of it not say it is suitable
to the present condition of these bleeding times, neither will I be so hardy as
to affirm that the four days wherein the water every day seemed to increase
in the redness of its color does signify the four years of the war which
now are already or near expired and that as the water every day for the four
days exceeded one another in the desines of its sanguine dye, it looking every
day redder then before, so the watre for these four years has every year
been one year more bloody then the other, surely it will prove good news
could I from hence assure you that as after the four days being ended, the
water did begin to return in its first genuine color, so the fourth year of
this war being expired, the Kingdom shall again return to its ancient
blessing and habit of peace, and that as the water bringing its first cleanes
the blood did sink down and vanish away, so now the crying sins of blood
shall be washed away from this Kingdom by the cleanes of a new life and by the
tears of true repentance.

There were many of the town of Carraton both men and women, and of the
inhabitants of the Country thereabouts who dipped their handkechers in this
pond when it was of a bloodly color, and the linen retayning the complexion
of blood, it will be a testimonial to succeeding times of this most strange
and wonderful accident and of the truth of what we write.

But to give you a good pond to all these wonderful events, we have received
intelligence and it is confidently reported that the King having of late
received to many overthrowes, and loss upon loss and despairing of and
success by Arms, has now sent unto the Parliament at Westminster to desire
hostages for the security of his person, that he may come and sit among them to
compose the differences of the Kingdom.

It it the desire of many thousands that His Majesty may continue in this happy
resolution, and that after so many deffiulties and dangers past, and so much
blood spilt he might at lenght by the mercy of God return and be reconciled to
his Parliament, and to this there is no good Subject (unless he be a desperate
Malignant or some arch Papist) but will say Amen.

In these sad days when the voice of Gods wrath are poured forth on the face
of the whole Earth wonders were never more frequent. Every day almost brings
forth some new Miracle.

In Shoolane London, on Tuesday September sixteen there was a monstrou* and
prodigious Birth of which the good-woman was delivered with infinet pain and
danger. It seemed to be as it were two children the one arising from upper
monstrous part of the other, the first child out of which the other lid proceed
had neither head not feet, but was only content with thighs and two-stumps
for legs, neither had it any arms but two imperfect branches came from the
shoulders of it which had no hands at all.

The nails both for the hands and foot in a sormidable length and shapenesse
did grow out of the hipps on each side to the great amazement of the beholders:
It had no head, but in Head thereof there did arise from the neck a great and
hollow lump of flesh, and from thence did proceed another birth in the shape
of a man child, and perfect in every limb, it was but little but very lovely to
behold, spare and lean and its feet were fastoned in the hollow trunk which
grew about the neck of the other monster out of which it does appear the whole
body does proceed, it is crediable that it received its original and the
beginning of its growth from the imperfect ruins of the other which (as I have
said) having neither head nor feet, receive perfect shapes in all other parts
the arms only excepted, and it was very plumpe and fat, and (as it seemed)
designed by nature a female. These birth, do carry with them remarkable
observations, sad and monsterous times must labor still with sad and monstrous
births and this (as it was still-borne) was exposed unto puplick veiw to the
infinet amazement of the beholders and to the great grief of the Parents.

FINIS.
