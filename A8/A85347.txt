A good Motion.
IF the rich will deal their Bread to the Hungry, as Isaiah 58. 7. by
forbearing one Mealss Meat in a week, and giving the value of it but for one
year to maintain the Children of the poor: and the poor do the like to
maintain their own Children; the rich may be re-imbursed in one year
(without any doubt of Sacrilege) the four hundred thousand pounds lent upon
the assurance of the Bishops Temporalities (which will be six years sooner
then all the rich are likely by a doubted course to get in their Moneys) the
Children of the poor may have the whole revenue of the Bishops Temporalities
to breed them up in Learning. A glorious University may be founded in London,
every Bishops House in the Countries be employed as Eaton College, Victuals
become cheaper, spiritual and corporal Famine be avoided: And all these (in
reason) be certainly effected without expense of one half penny.

For if the value of one Meal in a week in each Parish (one with another)
amounts but to twenty shillings) there being almost ten thousand Parishes in
England) and ten thousand pound weekly amounts to five hundred thousand
pounds in one year; then in one year the four hundred thousand pounds will
be re-imbursed with an overplus. And God, the Rich, the Poor (yea all) be well
pleased.
