AN ORDINANCE OF The Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament,
Authorizing Robert Earl of Warwick Lord High Admiral of England, to execute
Marshal-Law upon such Captains, Commanders, Officers, Mariners, Seamen and
Soldiers as shall not be subject to his Power and Authority.

WHereas it is found that great inconveniences have ensued for want of a strict
and severe Discipline to have been observed in the Navy or Fleet set forth by
Authority of Parliament, under the Command of Robert Earl of Warwick Lord High
Admiral of England; It is now Ordained and Declared by the Lords and Commons in
Parliament assembled, That from henceforth the Captains, Commanders, Officers,
Mariners, Seamen and Soldiers, and all other whatsoever thereunto belonging,
under the Command of the said Lord High Admiral, shall expect no further
forbearance of such punishment as may be condignly inflicted upon them,
according to the Civil Laws, Law-Marshal, and Customs of the Sea, and according
to such Laws and Ordinances as shall by him the said Lord High Admiral and his
Council of War, by him put in Commission under his Hand and Seal, be concluded
and agreed upon, but shall therein be subject to his and their Power and
Authority, to be punished by Death, or otherwise according to their demerits,
and as shall be due unto them by the said Laws and Ordinances.
