Die Mercurii 22. Julii 1646.
WHereas diverse Malignants and others that have adhered to the King against the
Parliament, are now come to the Cities of London and Westminster, and other
places within the Parliaments Quarters: And under pretense of several Articles
do repair to the Kings Person, whereby much inconvenience may arise, The
Lords in Parliament do declare, That no such person whatsoever shall presume in
the future to repair to the Court, or to the Kings person, without the
special leave of this House, and a Pass under the hand of the Speaker of this
House, as they will answer the contrary to this House at their perils. And that
this Declaration may be communicated to the Scots Commissioners, who are hereby
desired to give directions, that this Order be performed accordingly. And
lastly, That all such persons as have been in Arms against the Parliament, and
in particular Edward Walker, a dangerous Malignant and a person ill affected to
the Parliament, now about the King, shall be forthwith dismissed and sent away
from about his Majesty. And it is Ordered, That the Scots Commissioners be
desired to prevent the coming of any of their Nation to the King, who have
been in Arms against the Parliament of either or both Kingdoms.
