LONDON, Printed by John Clowes for Richard Wodenoth, at the Star under St.
Peter's Church in Cornhill, 1649.

CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNING The present Engagement.
SIR,
YOu have obliged me many ways to serve in all that I can for your good; but
the matter of your special concernment, wherewith you have acquainted me of
late, does lead me of mine own accord, by mine own inclination, beyond all
obligations, to endeavor your satisfaction. Seeing then your conscience is
scrupled about the engagement which by the Parliament is offered to be taken,
and you say you cannot subscribe thereunto, till three main doubts concerning
the same be cleared; I shall take them into serious consideration, to show you
what I think of the weight thereof, which indeed is of exceeding great moment.
For you say, 1. That the Oath of Allegiance, and the National Covenant are
still binding, and contradictory to this present engagement.

2. That the present Power by which the engagement is tendered, is very
doubtful, as a power unlawfully usurped; to which usurpation you think you
will be accessory if you take the Engagement.

3. That the consequence of the Engagement, seems to tend to an opposition
against the lawful Heir of the Crown, and the right constitution of the
Parliaments, whereunto you are pre-engaged, and from which you cannot recede.

To satisfy your desire, I shall lay before you, as briefly as may be, my
sense thereof, that you who have been always welaffected to the common cause
of Liberty, against the designs of Tyrany may be helped somewhat, to discern
how lawful or unlawful, how expedient or unexpedient, it will be for you, to
take, or not to take this Engagement for the public good, and the discharge of
your duty toward the same.

First then, concerning the Oath of Allegiance, and the National Covenant,
represent unto your self the true meaning thereof, and so order your thoughts
to do that which is answerable thereunto.

The Oath of Allegiance, as you know, did bind all men as Subjects in Law, to
be true and faithful to the Kings Person, to his Heirs and Successors, as they
were invested with the Authority which the Law did give them: nor was it ever
meant by the Parliament which Enacted the Oath of Allegiance, that any should
be absolutely bound to the King and his Heirs, as they were men, to be true and
faithful to their personal wills, but only to them and their wills as they had a
Legal standing: that is, to the Authority conferred upon them by the consent
of the People, which was testified in and under a Law; whereunto the King and
his Heirs were bound for the Kingdoms good by Oath: So that the obligations of
King and subjects are mutual, and must needs stand and fall together,
according as the condition by which they are begotten is kept or broken; which
is nothing else, but the Law according to which he and his Subjects agree, that
he shall be their King, and they shall be his Subjects. For as you were sworn
to the King, so he was sworn to you: as you were bound to be faithful to him,
so he was bound to be faithful to his trust: nor is he your Liege further then
he is faithful thereunto. If then he be found unfaithful to his trust, you
are ipso facto, absolved from your Allegiance unto him; and if according to Law
he receives not his Authority, you are not in Law his Subject at all. Now the
just and natural foundation of all Laws, is the reason of the Body, of every
Nation in their Parl. which has the sole Right to propose and choose the Laws,
by which they will be Ruled. Whence it has been (as I suppose) a perpetual
custom in this Nation, for the Commons at all times to ask and propose the
making of Laws; and for the Lords and King, to give their consent thereunto:
the Lords as the Judges in cases of transgression, and the King as the
executer, and public Trustee, for the administration of the common good and
wealth thereby; for in a Kingdom there is a Commonwealth, as the intrinsicall
substance of the Being thereof; for which all things are to be done by King and
Lords, as the public servants thereof; and Ministers not Masters of State
therein. If the King then should set himself wilfully to be above this Reason
of the Nation, which is the only Original of the Law, and refuse obstinatly
the Laws, which they shall choose to be settled: he puts himself ipso facto, out
of the capacity of being a King any more unto them, and if this can be made
out, to have been the way wherein the late King set himself, and that it was
the design of the House of Lords, to uphold and enable him to follow that way:
it is evident, that so far as he did by that means actually un-King himself as
to this Nation: so far also, they that assisted him in that design, did un-Lord
themselves in the State thereof, and if this was the guilt of the house of
Lords by other practices and proceedings more than by an indifferency and
compliance with the Hamiltonian in vasion, to help the King to such a Power, I
know not what to answer for them.

But as to the meaning of the oath of Allegiance, as by the perpetual consent
of all ages it never was otherwise understood; and by the third Article of the
National Covenant, (which is another branch of this doubt) may be made
manifest. It is then undeniable, that the third Article of that National
Covenant, was never meant by those that made it, or that took it, to be
opposite to the sense of the Oath of Allegiance; but altogether agreeable
thereunto. What then the meaning of that Article is, must needs also be the
true sense of the Oath of Allegiance. That Article then does oblige you, to
preserve the Right and Privileges of the Parliament, and the Liberties of the
Kingdom in your Calling, absolutely and without any limitation; but as for the
Kings Person and Authority, it does oblige you only thereunto, conditionally
and with a limitation; Namely in the preservation and defense of the true
Religion and Liberties of this Kingdom: If then the King did not give to the
Representatives of the Nation that assurance which was satisfactory and
necessary, that their Religion and Liberties should be preserved, none but his
Subjects were bound either by their Allegiance or Covenant, to defend his
Person and the Authority, which was conferred upon him. The Oath of Allegiance
therefore was bottomed upon the Laws, which the Representatives of the Nation
in Parl. had chosen to be observed concerning their Religion, and the Liberties
of the Kingdom; which he refractorily either casting off, or seeming to yield
unto, in such a way that no trust could be given him, that he would keep what
he yielded unto; the Parliament did actually lay him aside, and voted, that no
more Addresses should be made unto him: from which time forward he was no more
an object of your Oath of Allegiance, but to be looked upon as a private man: and
your Oath by which you were engaged, to be true and faithful to the Law, by
which the Religion and Liberty of the Kingdom was to be preserved, did still
remain in force: which if it may be the true substantial sense of the present
Engagement, which you think is contradictory to this Oath and to the National
Covenant, then you are to look well to it, that you be not mistaken. For to an
indifferent eye, it may be thought so far from being opposite to the true sense
of either, that it may be rather a confirmation of the ground; for which both
the Oath of Allegiance, and the third Article of the National Covenant was
then binding; For the ground of all these Obligations, is nothing else, but the
welfare of the Commonwealth, which was intrinsicall, to that which was called
the Kingdom, to which you are bound by the Law of Nature and Nations, to be
true and faithful for it self, and to the King, to the particular Laws whereof
the King is a servant to keep them and see them kept; and to the Liberties,
which by Law were limited (lest they should be exorbitant) and preserved, (lest
they should be incroached upon) you were bound for that Commonwealths sake,
which in the bosom of the Kingdom was then, and is now without it exstant,
and in being by it self. So then it may seem that you are so far from being
put by this Engagement upon any Declaration contradictory to your former Oaths,
that you are rather obliged thereby to stand firm to the same, by the
fundamental Reason thereof, as it is wrapped up in the common cause of Religion
and of the Liberty of the Nation: which notwithstanding any alterations which
are fallen out, or may fall out hereafter are to be constantly and unalterably
preserved: for this or that outward form of Government, is wholly accidental,
and no ways essential to any Nation of the world: and therefore is alterable,
in respect of forms, as is most expedient for their exigent necessities; but
to be governed by Laws, and to have the use of the true Religion, and of the
National Freedom, is absolutely necessary, and essential to the being of a
Commonwealth.

It may be conceived then that the intent of the Engagement is to this effect;
that seeing there is still a National tie and Association remaining amongst
the people of this land; whereof the Common good ought to be procured truly,
and faithfully by all that belong thereunto; therefore you are required to
declare, that the want of that accidental form of Government, which stood in
the having of a King and House of Lords, shall not take you off from being
willing to procure the same: which I think you are bound in conscience, as to
intend, so to declare and really to endeavor.

But you will press this further and say, that in the third Article of the
Covenant you are sworn to preserve the Rights and Privileges of the Parl. now
(say you) amongst the Rights and Privileges of the Parl. this is one; that
therein should be a house of Lords distinct from the Commons, and this another,
that all the Members of the Commons should sit and Vote freely; for when you
swore, you meant a parliament so constituted, and none other: but now (say you)
I am put upon a Declaration contrary to the intent of that part of my Oath:
because I am obliged to be true and faithful to the Commonwealth, as it is
without such a House, and such Members of the Commons.

To examine this Scruple I shall grant materially all that you say; First
concerning your sense of the Rights and Privilege of Parliament. Secondly the
present Parliament that it is not such as the former was without any
alteration. Thirdly concerning the intention, which you say you had in that
Part of your Oath: that it cannot now be prosecuted to that effect, whereunto
you say you took it; for if you took it, to preserve those Rights of
Parliament which you have mentioned; it must be granted that such an intention
cannot now be prosecuted by you in your private calling: But yet for all this
which I have granted, I must say that the taking of the present Engagement,
will not make you more guilty of the breach of this part of your Covenant than
you are already: for if you did when time and place was, according to your
calling, what in you lay, to prevent the breach of those privileges; you did
observe your Covenant, and cannot be accused of the infringement thereof;
forwhen a fatal necessity of State; in the course of Divine Justice, with a
power irresistible, not only to men of private, but to all that were in public
vocations, did bring about that Change upon the Parliament, no particular men's
engagements were considerable. Therefore of that charge, whether you attempted,
or attempted not to hinder it, you cannot be counted guilty; what ever the
intent of your promise was in the Covenant, because it was neither morally
possible nor lawful to you in the way of your calling, to hinder the cause or
effect of that change; and therefore to you it cannot be imputed as a breach of
Covenant. But you will here say, true indeed I am not guilty; but others in my
opinion are: But if I promise now to be true and faithful to the
Commonwealth, as upon this breach of privilege they have settled it, then I
confirm what they have done, and so make my self accessory to their guilt and
breach of Covenant. Here I perceive is that which does pinch you in the
business: you think, they that made the change broke the Covenant, and if you
engage under this change, as is desired, you think you break your Covenant
also. To this I shall say; First, that they who made the change will plead for
themselves, that they are not guilty of any breach of Covenant notwithstanding
that change; but this I shall leave to them to justify, as not being needful
for the resolving of your doubt at this time; therefore in the second place as
to your self, I see not how it will appear, that the consequence which you draw
from the act of the Engagement to the breach of Covenant, does at all follow,
although those that made the change should be guilty, as you think they are.
And then also this I am confident of, to be able to let you see further, that
although you may think that the effect of this Engagement is materially
contrary to some intention which you had in the third Article of the Covenant;
yet that by the act of the Engagement, you are so far from breaking your
Covenant, that except you take it, and observe it faithfully, you will not
only materially, but formally break that very Article of the Covenant, for
which you scruple the taking of the Engagement.

As for the consequence you make from taking the Engagement to a breach of the
Covenant, it does not at al follow to my understanding; for the direct and
plain matter of the Engagement binds you only to procure the good of the
Commonwealth, as now it stands: and because at all times and in all
constitutions thereof, you are bound to do this; no less by the Covenant it
self than by this Engagement; therefore your taking of this, to this effect,
can be no breach of that, For the Negative words, without a King and House of
Lords, (whereat you stumble) in the Engagement, may be properly and most
obviously taken, as an explication of the words Now established, immediately
going before; and not an absolute abnegation of the things looked upon truly as
in themselves: so that the obvious meaning of the words, is to me as if they
had been utterly thus assertorily. This Commonwealth at present does stand
without a King and house of Lords, and although it does stand thus; yet I
promise to be true and faithful thereunto. Now it does not at all follow, if I
promise, to do my duty to the Commonwealth, although it is at this time thus
settled; therefore I am accessory to all that has been done to have it thus
settled; Nor does it follow, if I seek the good of the Commonwealth, although
it wants a House of Lords; therefore I am accessory to the abolition thereof,
or approve of the putting out of the Lords wholly from all share of Government
in the Commonwealth. These things are altogether incoherent: for what ground
is there for me to abstain from doing my duty to the public; because others
have done (I think) more then theirs? Or because they do it not so as I can
allow of it? Can their faultines one way, excuse my neglect of duty another
way? To think so is very absurd, and therefore the consequence which you make,
does not at all follow,

But let us now go a step further, and suppose that in your apprehension of
matters, this Engagement does materially settle something in the Commonwealth,
which is contrary to the intention which you had in taking the Covenant; yet I
say, that by giving your assent thereunto, as matters now stand, you break not
at all your Covenant, because your Obligation to those matters by virtue of the
Covenant, was extinguished, before you were called upon to take this
Engagement: now that which is extinct and made void, cannot be said to oblige
any more: and all promises are ipso facto made void and extinct, in respect of
their tie upon the Conscience; when the thing promised, is become in it self
impossible to be done, or in reference to our calling unlawful to be
prosecuted. It is impossible in nature to preserve the Kings life which is cut
off, and the House of Lords which is already put down; And it is not lawful
for any in a private Calling to attempt the restoring of that which by public
power has been abolished. Nor did the Covenant ever intend, to engage any to
such an attempt: nor could any be lawfully obliged to intend such an
undertaking: not is there any word of restoring, but only of preserving, in
the Article of the Covenant. But if in your meaning, the promise of preserving
should extend it self also to a restoring endeavor; yet still the limitation
of this endeavor must be in and according to your Calling, not out of it, or
beyond it: Now your Calling I suppose, at present, is only to acquiesce at the
abolition of that which is made void, and not to declare any abrogation (as
some would extend it) of the Right which the Lords have to sit in Parliament.
They may have a Title to this Right, and yet be obliged, even for the
preserving of that Right, which without an inevitable ruin to the public
welfare cannot be obtained. Suppose that in order to the public good, you
were obliged by Oath to prosecute some business, and that in following it, you
should evidently perceive, that by the change of circumstances the prosecution
of your business, intended for the good would prove the ruin of the public; I
say, that notwithstanding your Oath, by which you are engaged to follow such a
business, you are nevertheless obliged to desist from it; because your Oath
binds no further then it is evident that the public good is advanced thereby;
and if the change of circumstances alter the whole case of your business (as
often in State Affairs it falls out) I say your Oath is made ipso facto void;
And thus the clause of the Covenant which relates unto the King and the House
of Lords, as sworn in order to common welfare; if any should now prosecute by
force, it is evident that he would by a new war hazard the ruining of al; which
by all humane means possible in nature lawful and not contradictory to the will
of God, we are al bound to the utmost to prevent; for to preserve the public
in peace and safety, is the main end of all the promises of the Covenant,
whereunto all particular matters are subordinate; and if I should not suspend
my particular pretentions to Right in order to public safety, I transgress
the Covenant, which above all does bind me unto this, which also is nothing
else but the express sense of the Engagement which is now offered: so that the
iment thereof, is no way contradictory, but altogether coordinate and
consistent both with the Oath of Allegiance and the National Covenant, so far
as they are obligatory.

And to go yet a step beyond this consideration, I shall add this, that if the
third Article of the National Covenant concerning the Privileges of Parl. be
yet in force in any degree, as you suppose it is, then it binds you to preserve
the privileges of Parliament that now are, as well as those that then were.
For if there has not been a total dissolution of all Government amongst us,
but a Parl. notwithstanding all changes still kept up, and therein a right to
rule and to order matters for the public good preserved: then the Oath of
preserving these Parl. Rights is still binding, so far as the Parl. is in
being: nor can it be agreeable to the intent of that article, or to the rule of
conscience, and of sound reason, that because it is supposed some have made a
breach upon some of the Rights of Parliament; that therefore it should be free
for any to break and dissolve all the rest. For if you count them guilty, who
made void the Authority that then was in any degree, how can you be guiltless
your self, if you intend to make void all that which remains? Therefore so far
as there is yet any ground of order and settlement in the Commonwealth by the
Authority of Parliament, and by the Counself of State and Courts of Justice
depending thereon; you are by that very Covenant in Conscience still bound to
preserve it: and to this very thing also the Engagement which is now offered
does clearly bind you, and (as I conceive) to nothing else directly; for the
obvious sense of the express words can be none other but this: That so far as
the Association of this people is settled, in a course of Government and in the
administration of Justice, you shall not overthrow but preserve the same,
although the administration of this Government and justice, is not now carried
on by a King and House of Lords; but only by the Parl. that now is, which
certainly is your duty at this time; And if this is clearly your duty for the
public good then you cannot understand the words of the Covenant to be binding
in any other sense but in this; for the words must be taken in the sense which
they can directly bear, and which do impart the main end for which the Covenant
was taken; for the maine end of this very Article whereof you make a scruple,
was evidently to preserve the Parliament and Commonwealth for it self, and (if
need so required) also without the King.

Now this is that which the Engagement does directly also require, for which
cause I say, that by virtue of this very promise, you are bound to take the
present Engagement; and if you take it not, that you make your self a
transgressor of that very Article which you pretend to keep; for if you refuse
to be true and faithful to the Commonwealth as it is now Established, you do
what in you lies to make the remaining Rights of Parliament, and the
beginnings of our settlement void; which though at first it was not intended to
be without a King; yet it was clearly presupposed in the Article it self, as
possible to be without him; and consequently, that although he should not be,
yet that the Commonwealth by the Rights of Parliament, and the Liberties of
the Nation should be preserved; which is all that now is sought for by the
Engagement.

I hope then that you shall find no cause to scruple any further at this; but
that such as under the pretense of such scruples take a course to overthrow
this Parliament, will be made conscionably awake to see their error; and that
they Diametrically by such a purpose cross the main intention of their
Covenant, and become guilty of dissolving the whole tie of this Commonwealth.
And this shall suffice concerning your first scruple at this time.

As concerning the present power by which the Engagement is tendered, your
Doubt is, what you ought to think of it: whether you should count it a lawful,
or an unlawful and usurped Power? and if such, whether you will not be
accessory to their usurpation, by taking the Engagement?

To these Questions I shall answer distinctly, and let you see the Rules by
which I order my conversation, in these cases, that if you have nothing to
except against them, you may take them up, and walk in the righteousness thereof.

For mine own part then, I have taken this to be a Rule, whereby all private men
(such as I am) as Christians ought to walk unblameably under the superior
powers of this world. Namely; That it does not be long to us, to judge
definitively of the rights which the Supreme powers over us in the world,
pretend to have unto their places. And the Reason is this, because I find it
no part of the profession of Christianity to meddle with this matter, nor can I
see that God does allow private men to take so much upon them over their
Superiors, nor ought Superiors to suffer it in their Subjects, nor will sound
reason, or a good Conscience allow it in any.

It is no part of our Christian profession, to become Judges of the great ones
of this world, in respect of their rights and pretentions to power. For we are
to behave our selves as spiritual men in this world, by the Rule of our
profession; and as strangers and pilgrims therein. taking it as our passage to
a Kingdom that cannot be shaken; and using it as the subject wherein our Faith
and Patience, our mortification to things present and our hope for things to
come are to be exercised. A stranger, passenger and pilgrim, takes things as he
finds them on his way, makes the best of them that he can, and meddles only
with his own matters, how to advance prosperously, and easily toward his
journeys end; that is, how to behave himself without blame and offense toward
God and men, in all things, with a good Conscience: holding forth the Word of
life, which is the Rule by which he does walk in the fear of God toward
others This is all that a Christian as a Christian, that is, by virtue of his
Profession, is to meddle withal about the affairs of this world, which in so
doing he does judge in the spirit of righteousness; but if he does make himself
a judge in another kind of particular rights and pretentions of the great ones
in this world, he takes upon him that which does not belong unto him in his
Profession of Christianity, for he does more then Christ would do on earth; for
Christ our Master in this profession would not become a Judge of the least
matters between man and man in the world; and how shall we that ought to be his
followers and Disciples, take upon us, to judge of the greatest of all? How
shall we Answer this to him? Is not this one of the great Characters of the
spirit of Antichrist, that he exalts himself above all that is called God? and
wherein has he done this more remarkably toward Magistrates who are called
Gods amongst men, then by exalting himself over them to become a Judge of all
their Rights and pretentions to power in this world? We must therefore beware
of entertaining the motions and practices of his Spirit, whereof this is a very
eminent one, to judge of the Right of power to Rule in the world.

Nor does God allow in the Word, those whom he has made Subjects to Superior
Powers, to take upon them to judge of the Rights and titles of those that are
over them. The Rule of Subjects behavior as Subjects is clearly determined in
Romans 13.1, till 8. and 1 Pet, 2.13, 14. and Tit. 3.1. Where we find nothing but
a command of submission and subjection, of not resisting and of paying taxes
and dues, and of giving honor, fear and respect for Conscience sake unto
Superior powers, because they are Gods Ordinance over private men, and they
bear not the sword which God has put in their hand, in vain. Now the
Commandments thus delivered, without any limitation or restriction of their
Rights to rule, or of our obedience (further then that we are bound to obey God
rather than man) I suppose do oblige all Subjects that are under them either to
obey, or to suffer patiently if they find cause to refuse obedience: but that
private men in ourward and humane concernments; and for worldly considerations
of their own taking up, should not find any cause to refuse obedience, I
conceive is the meaning of those absolute and unlimited injunctions which the
Scripture lays upon Subjects, in respect of their Superior powers: so then the
duty which God has appointed Subjects to observe toward those that are over
them, in the places of power, is clearly inconsistent with the scrupulositie of
this question, concerning their Right and Title to Rule. Nor should those that
are in places of power suffer their titles by mere private Subjects to be
questioned; for either they should actually suppress the disputes and
disquiries of that nature in private men, as not at all belonging to their
cognizance, or they should prevent it in others who are to be accounted their
equals, and to whom in reason they are accountable of their proceedings (for
God has made no men so Supreme, as not to be accountable unto others in a
reasonable way) by some satisfactory declarations or demonstrations of the
grounds of their Right to their places and of the equity of their proceedings
therein. Nor lastly, can it stand with sound Reason or a good conscience in any
private man, to take upon him to be a Judge of that matter, and to suspend his
acts of obedience in things otherwise good and lawful in themselves, till his
scruples in that kind be satisfied. For first, no sound reason will allow any
man to take upon him the judicature of rights, whereof it is not obvious to
him, to know the true grounds circumstantially; and seeing al claims to places
amongst men depend upon the concurrences of many circumstances, which in the
way of justice give to one and take away from another a right to the same; and
it is in Gods hand alone, to order the incidency of those circumstances between
those that have power, and the competitors for the same places: and private men
cannot possibly in their ordinary way (wherein they are bound to stand and
walk) know assuredly the incidencies of these circumstances, which change the
nature of rights and claims to places; therefore no justice nor reason can
allow private men to be Judges of things whereof it is not morally possible for
them to have a true insight, and whereinto they have no calling by God or men
to make a special inquiry, without which they become unreasonably and
unconscionably presumptuous, if they settle within themselves, or utter toward
others any judgment definitively. Then in the second place, it is a most
unconscionable practice in any whom God has put in the place of subjection,
and of living in a private station, to resist the powers that are over him,
requiring good and lawful things, only because he is not satisfied in their
right to require those things of him, and in their Title to their places, as if
Superior Powers that are actually in the posession of places, which God has
put in their hands to rule others by, and serve the public with, were
accountable to every private man, concerning their right, by which they stand
under God in their Charges, and as if it were lawful for men professing
Christianity, to dispense with matters of duty in themselves commendable and
profitable to common edification, only because they will appear opposite for
some worldly respects unto those that are over them, to whom they owe due
respect and submission.

Now after all this; if you say: what? shall private Christians then make
themselves slaves to any that will rule over them; without judging rationally,
who are their lawful Superiors to whom they owe obedience, I say to this, no:
for Christians are the only free men of the world: all the rest are slaves to
their proper passions, lusts, opposite interests; but he that is subject to the
law of liberty, doing all by a Rule; is truly free and none but he. But you
will say; by what rule then shall he discern, who is his superior? I answer by
a rule agreeable to sense, to reason, and to conscience. Sense will show him
who is actually in profession of all power and places of Government over him,
and by this he will perceive under whom he does stand. Reason will show what he
who is over him pretends unto; whether yea or no, his pretenses are backed with
power to maintain his right against all adversaries therein? and whether yea or
no, the use of that power be limited by law; or let wholly to his own will
without any law? And Conscience will show that he to whom God has committed
the plenary administration, of public affairs with unconfrontable power, is
Gods vicegerent over the society of those to whom his administration does
extend it self, either by virtue of a contract, which makes a law, or by virtue
of a conquest, which is bound to no law but the will of the Conqueror; for if
the Apostle does teach us that [all souls ought to be subject to the higher
powers] because [there is no power but of God] and because [the powers that be]
in place [are ordained of God] then it will follow, that those who are actually
supreme, and in a plenary possession of power, ought to be obeyed as Gods
Ordinance; for it is not possible that any can attain to the height of power
without Gods disposal of it into his hands. Here then a Christian rests, and
freely performs his duty toward him in all things good and lawful and makes no
further inquiry, after the rights to titles according to laws of men; because
he does consider that the most high gives the Kingdoms of men to whomsoever
he pleases. Thus keeping my Spirit from flying out beyond his bounds one way,
and following the directions of a clear rule another way; I prevent this
example wherewith you trouble your self without cause, and entangle your
Conscience against your duty.

But here again it may be said, if this be the condition of subjects, and if
their duty toward Superiors is thus circumscribed; what way is there left for
them to be freed from the unnatural usurpation of tyrannical powers? I answer
there be three ways which God has left to the reason of men to make use of
partly to prevent, partly to redress the tyrannical usurpations of an over
ruling Roman. The first is to settle subordinate Officers under him with out
whom he cannot act. The second is, to settle laws whereby to circumscribe him,
and their actings, and a law making power to whom both he and they are to be
accountable. And the third is, the great and invincible law of necessity,
whereof every one is so far the judge in his own cause and in his own place as
he is moved thereby to venture his life and welfare to observe the dictates
thereof: by these means subjects without judging of the titles of Superiors,
may repress the undue usurpation of power in tyrannical spirits: where you
may take notice that although you and I, as private men ought not to make our
selves judges of the rights which superiors pretend to have in and to their
places; yet that they are not without a judicature over them in those places:
for the subordinate Officers belonging to a state are bound to judge of the
rights of those that are over them; both by which they stand in their places of
supremacy, and by which they proceed in their actings toward subjects, least
they be made the instruments of Arbitrary power and Tyranny, and then also the
law-making power, which in all Nations resides by the law of Nature. in the
convention of the Representatives of the whole body of the people (whether it
be made up of the heads of familes, or of chosen Deputies who are entrusted
with a delegated power from all the rest) does make or unmake rights in all
places and persons within it self, as it from time to time does see cause. As
for the Law of necessity which begets war, whereby God is immediately
appealed unto by those that pretend to have no Superiors on earth, that he may
judge of their rights; whatsoever his hand does determine in the event, is to
be counted the right of those in favor of whom the determination is made by
his judgment.

By these rules then quiet your mind according to your place, concerning the
right, which the present powers have to Rule, do not take upon you to define
matters whereof you are no competent judge: you are made a competent judge only
of your own actions which belong to a subject, as you are under a visible and
uncontrollable power which God has set over you, and your duty is to submit
thereunto, in all things agreeable to the will of God, judging your self that
you put no stumbling block, or an occasion of offense in any man's way, Romans 14:
13: yet I will not say but in the judgment of discretion as you are a member
of this Commonwealth, and concerned in the public welfare thereof, you may
look upon your superiors to see how they pretend to stand: that is, by what
apparent right, and with what visible power they possess their places, but this
you ought not to do so peremptorily, as to oblige your conscience as to be
suspended upon the observations which you shall happen to make of them, and
their proceedings; as if your private judgment in such cases should be the
Rule by which you ought to walk in point of obedience: I say you ought not to
set up this judgment of yours so high within your self and over others as to
drown the thoughts of all other rules: but you ought to limit it as I have said
before, within the bounds of Christianity, and discreet rationallity: wherein
that I may help you yet a little further: Consider soberly with your self what
can be answered to this plea, which they will allege for themselves.

1. Whether yea or no, the National tie and association, by which we were a
Commonwealth while we were yet called a Kingdom, has ever been dissolved.

2. If it has not been dissolved, what has kept it entire in the midst of
all these shakings? was is not a Parliament? and the subordination of all
Officers throughout the nation under it?

3. And if a Parliament is still remaining, and all subordinate Officers in
places of judicature and execution, stand under it throughout the whole nation,
so that all men may have a legal protection from injuries; what is there
wanting to a lawful power and government?

4. If nothing be wanting to a legal protection, for those that acknowledge
the jurisdiction, then such as acknowledge it not, do put themselves out of
that protection: and if they resist the power which God has set over them for
the public good, and which is actually and fully possessed with all the places of
public administration, they resist the Ordinance of God; and they that resist
this Ordinance (says the Apostle) shall receive to themselves damnation, Romans
12.2.

As for the point of enquiry, how these particular men in whose hands the power
and government is are come to their present places, whether in a legal way, or
that which you call usurpation, it does not belong to the Conscience of any
man, who is in a private station, to determine peremptorily, far less upon his
determination to suspend his actings toward the public good. Yet if in this
also you desire to reflect upon the passages of Right, without oblieging your
Conscience to stand engaged either way by that which you shall observe, I shall
further suggest these heads of matters appliable unto the case of those whom
you suspect to be usurpers, unto your impartial meditation, as a Plea which
they do allege for themselves.

First, Whether yea or no, it be any way unjust by the law of Nature, among men
that are equals, to resist force with force?

Secondly, If it be just among equals to resist force with force, the second
point will be to consider, Whether he that invades another man's natural right,
or he that defends his own, is to be accounted the Usurger?

Thirdly, If he that invades and seeks to deprive another man of his right, be
the Usurper; then he that by resistance is deprived of that whereof he
attempted to deprive his neighbor, is not wronged by way of usurpation, but
justly defeated of the power which he did abuse.

Now they will say, that the case was thus first between the King and
Parliament, if you count them Equals (which is the least can be given, say
they, to a Parliament by the Law of Nature and Nations) and then afterward
between the one party and the other in the Parliament, the same case was acted
again, as between Equals: whereupon the City Militia on the one hand, and the
Army on the other was depending and see on work for action. And how far (these
powers having dashed) those that prevailed did think themselves necessitated to
settle the safety of the Commonwealth in their own way, and what settlement
that has by Gods permission brought forth, and upon what ground it now stands,
I shall not need to represent unto you: only the sober consideration of the
grounds which the party accused of usurpation does allege for its
proceedings, are to be thought upon indifferently, without prajudicat affectus,
if you will free your Conscience from a snare.

And this shall suffice also, concerning the first branch of your second doubt:
but let us now come to the second branch thereof, which supposing the power to
be usurped, does question how far by taking the Engagement, you become
accessory to the guilt thereof?

To this question, I shall answer briefly thus. That the Engagement being a
duty just to be required by the present Powers from their subjects; without the
performance of which, there is no protection due unto them; and necessary to be
performed by all, that will not profess themselves desirous to overthrow the
present safety and public welfare of the nation: it cannot make those that
take it accessory to the guilt of those that tender it, if any be in them;
because the performance of a thing good in it self, and just and neceessary for
me to do in reference unto others can derive no guilt before God from others,
of the evil which may be in them, upon me. All Moral actions are to be
counted good or evil, lawful or unlawful, according to the justice of the
rule by which they are done, and according unto the usefulness and convenience
of the imediate and proper end, for which they are done: and if both these be
found in the Agent thereof, no guilt can from without be brought upon him, by
any co-Agents.

Now the Rule of Justice in this case, is, That we are bound to show fidelity
unto those of whom we desire protection: And that we are bound to be ready to
every good work, toward those with whom we live, which is all that in the
present state of this commonwealth is required of us; which if we desire not
10 perform, we deserve not to have a being in it: and if we desire to perform
this, there can be no cause why we should not profess it, or why the
profession of our willingness to do this should make us guilty of other men's
sins.

As concerning the end for which the Engagement is to be taken, it is to
obliege all to ented one and the same public good, so far as in the present
constitution of affairs, it may be advanced: and to give the Supreme Power an
assurance that we shall not betray it, but that we are willing to maintain all
good intelligence for publiqe Governments with it, notwithstanding the present
changes brought upon the Commonwealth.

Suppose those that have the present Power had without any apprehension of
necessary for common safety or danger to their own safety and liberty, only for
some finister ends usurped the places wherein they are, yet by Gods permissions
and direction over me they being now therein, and finding themselves obliged
by their places to procure peace and unity among the subjects of this Land, and
to preserve the public interest for the good of all, according to their best
understanding, if they use any expedient which does tend thereunto, and offer
it unto me to concur with them therein, with what Conscience can I refuse a
concurrence to such an intention? If they having done amiss formerly, set
themselves now to do well, can I with any conscience oppose them therein? Is it
just or pious, that because they found no safety in the way by which I would
have settled the Commonwealth, and have altered it, that therefore I should
refuse to concur with them henceforth in any other way or at their motion do
any thing although it may be found never so useful and necessary in it self
for the good of the Commonwealth? If they were guilty one way (as you imagine)
by taking upon them more then they had right to do: take heed least you be more
guilty another way, by refusing to do that which before God and men you are
obliged to do: if you are afraid of pertaking of their sin, then take heed
that you disturb not the public welfare as much or more by this sin, then
they did by that: If their guilt was by the usurpation of power to dissolve the
way of settlement wherein we were, take heed lest you obstruct al other ways
which henceforth may be taken toward a happy settlement only by the refusal
of due subjection unto the power that is now over you, because you think your
self or your party wrongfully deprived of the power which you had. If you
strive for power as much as you think they have done, then you are more
accessory to their usurpation by doing that your self for which you condemn
them, then by yielding to any lawful Engagement for the good of the
Commonwealth, which they propose unto you. Thus while you pretend to avoid a
doubtful guilt of another man's sin, least it reflect upon you; you contract an
undoubted guilt of your own sin by refusing a necessary duty to the
Commonwealth. The truth is, they cannot be said guilty of Usurpation of Power;
for it was by all the Authority of the Commonwealth that then was, both of
King and Parliament, put into their hands, but if their guilt lies any where,
it is this, that they abused their power: now you cannot be made accessory to
this abuse thereof, which is already part, if you give not your express
consent and approbation to that which they did, which I am confident they will
never urge any man to do, who will promise henceforward to be faithful to the
peace and prosperity of this state, for some of the council of State
themselves, would not be engaged to approve of all proceedings past, and yet
sit still in council with them to advance the public welfare in time to come,
whereby you may perceive that by this engagement they mean not to draw in others
to be accessory, to their past proceedings, but to know who they are that are
faithful in the land, and wiling to concur in good and lawful undertakings in
due time: for this is all that the engagement can rationally be stretched unto,
and he that will not admit of it in this sense makes himself actually liable to
a greater sin then that which he pretends to be afraid to fall into, which is a
way of proceeding very preposterous and unconscionable of sin for fear of being
found sinful.

Hitherto I have insisted upon your two first doubts, more largely then I did
purpose at first, therefore in the third and last, I shall be more brief, for
if in the two former you be well satisfied concerning that which is your duty,
I cannot see how in this last you can be much further scrupled, for if your
conscience is once thoroughly convicted of the lawfulness and necessitsy of a
duty, it must cast the events and consequences upon the performance of Gods
providence, and not by the conjecturall appearances of your own apprehensions,
in the balance therewith. In the third doubt you say the [consequence of the
engagment seems to tend to the opposition of two things] first [to exclude the
lawful heir of the crown from his right]: Secondly [to exclude the Lords from
sitting in Parliame] to which things you say, you [are preingaged, and from
which you cannot recede.] To which I shall offer these considerations to your
more deliberate judgment. First, if those be only seeming inconveniences, and
the other a certain and undoubted convenience, nay a necessary and a
dispensable duty your conscience cannot justly suspend the latter for the
formers sake, for there is no proportion of obligation in respect of
conscience, between that which is seeming a, and that which is undoubtedly
certain, we are commanded [not to judge according to appearances but to judge
righteous judgeme] Joh: 7.24: by which we must conclude that to follow
appearances; is not to follow the rules of righteousness, and consequently,
that it is not conscionable to act unrighteous, or to suspend righteous
actings, only for appearances of evil, and as it is absund to do evil that
good may come of it: so it is also unconscionable to leave off the doing of
that which is infallibly good, that no doubtful evil may come of it: and then
confider the duty which you refuse to do; relates to the whole Commonwealth,
the safety of all, and your own necessary peace and preservation, and the evil
which you fear will come upon it, relates only to the seeming violation, of a
particular right of some few persons which is, or may be doubtful, whether you
be any further engaged thereto yea or no, for when you say that you are
preingaged so that you cannot recede; I must suppose that you mean not a
wilful but a conscionable preingagement, and that you cannot lawfully recede
from it: but if the contrary has already appeared and is clear to your
conscience now, that your duty and preingagement to the whole Commonwealth
cannot lawfully and conscionably be put in the balance, with a particular
engagement to some persons depending thereon; then you cannot make any further
doubt of that which should be done in this case: for I cannot imagine that you
will think it lawful for you to dispute your interest toward the universal
good of the Commonwealth, for any particular engagement though never so strong
otherwise, and lawfully undertaken at first: for if the interest of him, who
you call the heir of the crown, and of the men called the Peers of the Kingdom,
is of so much weight with you, that you will do no good also to the
Commonwealth without them: then it is clear, that in your esteem they are more
then the Commonwealth to you, and that the common cause, for the maintaining of
which a'l your engagements, are wrought upon you is not so much valued by you,
as the particular cause of these persons, which how you can with a good
conscience allow in your self, I am not able to understand. I say then that if
the particular interests and pretentions of any, come to justle with the
public good in your affections, and justle out the same, it is clear that you
are not faithful to your principles of conscience and reason before God and
men, but that you are willing to betray the common cause to particular designs
and consequently that you will seek your self in the bottom more then the
public good: because it cannot be doubted, that if you will subordinate your
zeal and love to the commonwealth unto the respect which you have to other
men's advantages, that you will far more if occasion be offered, subordinate the
same unto the respect which you have to your own advantages. For the rsolution
of this scruple you ought as I conceive to understand your self thus far, that
you cannot entertain the thought of any engagement or obligation lawfully,
which does cause your engagement and obligation, to be true and faithful to
the Commonwealth, at all times or at any time, therefore with a good
conscience if you find your obligation to the heir of the crown, or to the
Privileges of Peers, fall cross and opposite by change of circumstances (as
all human masters are changeable by circumstances) to the common good of the
nation; (I say) you cannot in such a case maintain that obligation so, as not
to be receded from it with a good conscience: and if the proposal of this
engagement, does discover thus much of your corruption unto you by such a
scruple, you are to be humbled for it before God, and laying aside henceforth
all Hypocrisy, rectify the intentions of the heart with uprightness and
sincerity. And all this I offer to be confidered by you, supposing your
preingagement to have been just and lawful, as no doubt it was, but yet that
now your resolution not to recede from it, cannot be still just and lawful as
matters now stand in the state, if you will make that preingagement to justle
out of your affection this engagement, which now is offered unto you to be
taken.

As for the dissolution of your tie and obligation to the heir of the crown, I
shall refer you to look upon God, whether he has not dispossessed him wholly
by his own doings and counsels, and by the guilt derived from his father and
mother upon, him of all his interest in this Kingdom, and Commonwealth: for
because his aim and the aim of those that are about him is not for the
Commonwealth, but for the Kingdom, that is not for the good of the society:
but for self greatness.

Therefore God, who takes and gives the Rights of Government by the putting of
one into the actual possession of a ruling power, and by taking of the same
power away from another, to fulfill his own counsel and judgments over this
people, and over those that exalt themselves over them by destroying the earth,
he has done as it seems good in his own eyes, both with him who according to
men claims the Crown, and with those that were the supporters thereof, more
then promoters of the public good: And what God who does exalt one and put
down another, determines in this kind, in the fight of all the world, and (I
may say) against the clear intentions of all that engaged themselves at first
for the good of the Nations, and for the Kings good also; what I say, he
determines thus in this kind against men's intentions and expectations, whose
affections have been sincerely set for the Kings just Rights, no less then
yours you and I have no warrant to contradict or oppose in our thoughts: but we
must observe this way of changing the rights, and shaking the titles of the
earth, that the Lord alone may be exalted in the day of our common, and their
special visitation; for I conceive that the Prophecy of the Prophet Isaiah,
cap. 24. v. 21. is begun to be fulfilled amongst us, somewhat more remarkably
then in other parts of the earth as yet, which is this: And it shall come to
pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that
are on high, and the Kings if the Earth upon the earth; and they shall be
gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shall be
shut up in prison, and after many days shall be visited. Then then the Moon
shall be confounded and the Sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in
mount Sion and before his ^^^cients gloriously. I shall not now stand to open
these words unto you further then their sense is obvious to show that which
with another ear the same Prophet says, to the same or like effect, That the
lofty looks a men shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men bowed down, and
the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day, for the day of the Lord of hosts
shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted
up, and he shall be brought low: which is a warning also to those that are now
exalted in power over us: lest they be high minded in their own conceits and
their ruin come suddenly, and without remedy, if they all or any of them will as
Israel once did say to the seers, see not, and to the Prophets prophecy not
right things unto us; prophecy deceits, and cause the holy one of Israel, and
his law to cease from before us, and if when they begin to despise his word (as
some of them otherwise very active and instrumental in outward changes seem to
do) they trust then in oppression, and perverseneses, and lean upon their word
and stay thereod, they must take notice, they shall be taught to know with dear
experience, if they alter not their course; Esa. 50.11.12.13. that this
iniquity shall be to them as a breach ready to fall; swelling out in a high
wall, whose breaking comes suddenly and at an instant; for if the tallest
Cedars are not spared, but cut down, when they exalt themselves above the Trees
of the Forest: how shall the smaller shrubs be borne withal, when they are
guilty of the same misdemeanor? they therefore that stand before the Lord of
the whole earth, let them be wise and fear; he stands among the Gods and
judges: even he, who being the King of Kings, came to serve all men through
love, and does teach all men to deny themselves, and deceive his Disciples;
learn of him that he is meek, and humble of heart. If they seek themselves
and not the Commonwealth, whereunto they pretend to engage others; they shall
be found out by those whom they engage to the Interest of the Commonwealth,
who mind it sincerely; and being discovered, they shall be cast out of their
greatness in it. We have seen several ^^^ties up, and their several
Interests set a foot; and their changes came, because the true Interest of
Christianity, wherein all Commonwealths alone can prosper, has not been so
much minded by them as their own Interests, we should therefore pray for those
that are over us now, that though they may have had, and have still their
failings, yet that they (...) not be split upon this Rock, and we should watch
also over our (...) ^^les, least we be made a cause of their own splitting, and
of the (...) ^f all, by being intised to be wilfully scrupulous in these
matters; (...) ^erhaps some are for ends of their own, to make the way of
Government difficult, and the standing of those that are in places of power
unsafe: If any be such (of which number I know you are none) they shall eat of
the fruits of their own doings assuredly. For if they acknowledge the
jurisdiction deceitfully to betray it; God will find them out, if they will not
acknowledge it, nor any thing (though never so good) offered to the public
interest by it; only because they will keep men's spirits at a distance from
it: they shall not escape to be consumed by the fire, which they do maliciously
kindle to destroy the Commonwealth: if the common interest, which I am
persuaded, is in simplicity to be aimed (...) by the engagement, according to
their sense that offer it; were with^^^ scrupulosity and contradiction taken up
and intended by all; what (...) matter would it be in a short time to bring at
last about a real (...) ^^^mation of all our grievances; but if those that
complain of pressures (...) ^^^evances, and of the charge of an Army, by their
own disaffection (...) ^ublick, and unruliness under Government; make an Army
abso^^^^ (...) ^^cessary, and occasion the grievances themselves, whereof they
make complaints only to cast an odium upon the Government: they will be found
to be the Children of their Father the Devil, and receive with him their
reward; for he obstructs all that is good in every one, and tempts all unto
distempers and disorderly Carriages, and then lays them to their Charge to
make them odious thereby. Besides the scruples which you have made in this
business, I have met with some, that labor to make strange interpretations and
inferences upon every word of the Engagement, as if it were in the meaning of
those that offer it, a bundle of snares; but trouble not your self with that,
for in all promises of this kind, the Rule is, that you must take the sense
which is most obvious, to express an undeniable duty; and by following this,
you shall not be entangled into scruples and suspicions, what others may strain
the words unto. Another told me, (and if I understand by him that many are thus
scrupled) that although he could take the Engagement in a lawful sense, and
approve the obvious sense of it; yet that he ought not to do it, by reason of
the offenses, which many godly people would take at him for it, who cannot but
think it a breach of Covenant. To this I answered, that in a necessary matter
of duty, an offense wrongfully taken at it, ought not to be regarded by those
that perform it; but they ought rather to follow their own Conscience, and give
to those that are offended at them in their way, a satisfactory reason of the
justice thereof, to instruct them; but in things of an indifferent nature,
which are free to be done or left undone, there we are bound to suspend the
action which may be taken offensively: as for this matter I say, that on both
hands there will be offenses given, or taken, and that by the Godly. For as
some godly will be offended at the taking of the Engagement, so some others
will be offended, at the not taking thereof: the case then will be which of
these two offenses I am most to avoid; whether that which is wrongfully, or
that which is justly taken, both by the godly, and also by those that are in
superiority; whom I offend, so as to give them just cause, to deny unto me for
my offense their protection, and my necessary safety, and us here, of the same
act: the offense on the one hand is sinfully given, and on the other wrongfully
taken; it is easy to judge which of the two is to be avoided. I shall leave
these things to your conscionable and unprejudicat consideration, to be weighed
in the fear of God by you; as in his presence without humane respects they are
offered to you, by

From my Chamber November. 27. 1649. Your faithful and affectionate Friend in
