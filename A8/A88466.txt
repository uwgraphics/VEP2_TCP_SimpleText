By the Mayor.
WHEREAS the Lords Day, (commonly called Sunday) is of late much broken and
profaned by diverse disorderly people, in carrying and putting to sale diverse
victuals and other things: Yet in regard of the inevitable necessity of milk
for many Infants, sick, aged, and many medicines, as well on the Lords day as
in the week days, without which they cannot subsist; by reason whereof, the
sale of milk on that day cannot be avoided. And whereas the Milkewomen in the
City of London, and places adjacent, have most earnestly petitioned, That Order
might be taken as well about the sale of Milk on the said Days, that they
might nevertheless enjoy the Ordinances of God, and sanctify the Sabbath in
obedience to the Commands of God, and the pious Laws of the Kingdom in that
behalf made. As also to prevent the great abuse and fraud which is used by
diverse single persons using the said calling, give great prices for their milk
to the Milke-masters, (those of the said calling (which have Families to
maintain, and many Parish, and Church duties to pay) not being able to give
the like) and to make up their money again in retailing their milk, do
usually deceive the Common wealth, in selling by false measures, and vending
flatten milk for new: It is therefore Ordered, That all and every person using
the said calling of Milke-selling, and which are House keepers within the City
of London and places adjacent, may repair to the houses of their Customers,
and serve them only in the morning of every Lords day with Milk, they not
exceeding the hours of eight of the clock (in the Summer,) and nine of the
clock (in the Winter time) of the same mornings, for the sale and serving
thereof at the furthest; And that no such retaylers of Milk, shall presume to
cry or sell any milk during the residue of the said days, nor in the evening
of the same. And it is further Ordered, That no Milkemasters within the City of
London, and places adjacent, shall sell the Milk (which their Kine does yield
in the evening of the Sabbath days) to any of their retailing Customers
whatsoever; And that the same evenings milk (from time to time) of every
Sabbath day, shall remain and be unto the respective Milkemasters (Owners
thereof) unto their own Accounts, as their own proper goods and Chattels,
without (any way) charging the same, either to, or upon their (then) retailing
Customer; Or mollesting, suing or troubling them or any of them, for any loss
or damage that shall or may arise or grow thereby. And lastly, for the
preventing of the inhancing of the prices of Milk, and the great deceit which
is daily used as foresaid, by many idle and extravagant single persons in
retailing of Milk. It is ordered, that no milkemaster whatsoever at any time
or times hereafter, shall utter, vend, or sell their milk to any retailing
single person or persons whatsoever: And if any person or persons shall be
found offending in the premises: That then they be brought before me the Lord
Mayor, or some other of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace, to the end they
may receive such punishment as to Justice shall appertain.

Given under my hand this nineteenth day of June, Anno Dom. 1643. And in the
nineteenth year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord King Charles, of England,
etc. ISAAC PENNINGTON Mayor
