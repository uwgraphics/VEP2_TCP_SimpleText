A COLLECTION Of diverse Papers Presented unto the Houses of Parliament By the
Commissioners of SCOTLAND since May last, 1645.

Published by Authority.

LONDON, Printed by Moses Bell. 1645.

Ingenuous and Courteous Reader.
HEre I present unto thee a Collection of some Papers, of which I shall only
say that in them thou will find Reason and Truth, the publishing whereof I am
persuaded in the first place will give content to men of judgment and
integrity, concerning diverse things murmured and rumored every where almost
against men so well deserving in the service of this Cause of God, and of his
people, and consequently against the Cause it self, for which they have, and
do undergo so much hardship, toyling care, and hazard, etc. in all these
three Kingdoms; not only in opposing the violence and plots of the open and
declared enemy, but also in declining and stopping the undermining devices of
counterfeit friends, and false brethren. In the next place it will make
false-hearted and by-ended men blush for shame if they have any, as also the
simpler ones acknowledge their own sillyness, suffering themselves thus to be
deluded, and as it were led by the Nose, by the specious lies of crafty and
deceitful men; but before thou go to the reading of the papers themselves,
give me leave to detain thee a little with these ensuing lines: Of late many
reproaches have been cast upon the Scots, in the pursuance of the service in
this common Cause, namely for three things. First, on the one side the
Malignants, that is, the enemies of Church and State, adversaries to our
solemn Covenant blame the Scots, for pressing and urging the settling of the
Church Government, to the end that all gross Idolatry and Superstition, with
Tyranny may be pulled down; as also all fanaticall errors and Heresies, with
confusion may be repressed in the Church, and it preserved pure as the Spouse
of Christ, according to his holy Word, and conform to the practice of the
first times, and example of the best reformed Neighbor Churches, as we are all
bound by our solemn Oath; on the other side diverse men of zeal, to the glory
of God, and good of his people, blame the Scots, that they are too
white-lipp'd, and do not put home with vigor enough the settling of the
Church, as they are conceived to have done in their own Country, and so they
are wished by these Zelots to make their stoutnesse more clearly appear in
this business of the Church, for these well-meaning men are grieved from their
heart to see the settling of the Church, these five years in hand so slackly
pursued; yea in the latter times, stopped by some of those who formerly did
make a show of an earnest affection for the settling of the same as aforesaid;
but now with an unparalled impudency do publicly affirm, that Religion was
not the first and maine quarrel betwixt the Parliament and the common enemy,
against the Declaration of both Houses when they took Arms, and against the
Declaration of both Kingdoms jointly, and more particularly against the
National Covenant. To this it is answered; the Scots in conscience and duty to
God and his people, and particularly by solemn Oath are bound to put on the
settling of the Church with all faithfulness and earnestness, and yet they
have to this day proceeded therein with all meekness, longanimity and
tenderness, studying to gain by fair means those who are so backward to the
settling of the Church if it were possible.

2. The Scots on one side are blamed by those who are enemies to the settling of
Government in the Church, and good order in the State, for expressing so
seriously their desires of peace, the Church being settled in truth and purity,
and the State secured, with due Privileges and lawful liberty. And on the
other side, diverse blame the Scots for not pressing home enough the obtaining
of Peace, so much the rather that they are afraid to have a Peace, both long
in coming and uncertain when it is come, except the Scots press it, and be
engaged in it. To this it is likewise answered; the Scots have undertaken war,
not to make a Trade of it, but to obtain peace, and the sconer the better for
the stopping of the torrent of wickednesses of all kinds so openly, and with so
high a hand committed against God, and the wrongs done unto his people in
war; for they find by woeful experience that the Sword is the heaviest of
the three maine scourges wherewith God punishes the children of men for their
iniquities; yet they conceive the thing is to be done with judgment and
discretion, for fear of surprisall, and circumvention by the common enemy, who
studieth to undo us by deceit, in making an uncertain peace (if not prevented
by wisdom) since he fails in his plots and open violence by war to destroy
us.

3. The Scots are blamed that their Army has done nothing this Summer, and
has lain heavily upon the people, yea, and put Taxes upon them, to a huge and
immence value if it went through the whole Country. To this also it is
answered; If the Scots have done nothing, I pray you where does the fault lie,
for they have been ever willing and ready; with us when we will have the Plough
to go, first we give meat both to man and beast; next we furnish the Plough
with all instruments, as sock, culter, etc. fit for the work: then let it be
known with what and in what measure the Scots have been furnished for any
undertaking, yea, in downright terms, they have been so dealt withal, that
it seems there has been a set design to keep them from doing, and to make
them odious to the people; yet they have not been idle notwithstanding their
wants, for the sending of the King twice Southward, and the breaking his
Northern design is as advantageous to the main service of the common Cause as
any thing has been done any where this year; all wise and judicious men do
acknowledge and confess this. To lay aside diverse other particulars done by
the Scots this year, but as for the Taxes or Assesments, said to be against
the liberty of the people, it is answered; that first they are moderate, and
reach no further then the places nearest unto their quarters, not going through
the whole Country, as some do seem to intimate in their letters; then if it
be against the liberty of the people without Ordinance from Authority to lay
Assesments upon the Country, it is against the nature of men to live upon
nothing, or starve till Order from Authority come. Again, I pray you whether
or not is it more convenient for the people that moderate Assesments should be
laid upon them, then that the Soldier driven by necessity should take at
discretion. Further, whether or not is it better for keeping an Army of foot
for the good of the people to have a set Tax paid and appointed in a place,
then to run up and down at all times for provisions; are not the forces in the
West driven to the same exigencies for want of pay? yea, some of late although
they have been formerly with care looked unto, have abandoned their Colors and
run away: yet I am sure if the Scots Army had the fourth part of pay that the
Western has had this Summer, they would render ten for one for any thing that
should be taken from the people, of this they have given evidence enough by
their former carriage in this Kingdom: moreover, they have frequently and
earnestly solicited for pay to fit them for action, and keep them from being
troublesome to the people; and since they speak of liberty, I pray you if the
Scots had not come in where had the liberty been, and where had the Parliament
been siting for judgeing of the liberty of the people? Is it not known to all
that the Parliament is Assembled at the occasion of the in-coming of the Scots,
then the Court Plots against the Parliament were disappointed by reason of the
being of the Scots Army in England Thirdly, the Scots being solicited by the
Court upon great promises to side with it against the Parliament, not only
refused to do it as most base, but also gave notice of it to the Parliament
with assuranee of their service. Lastly, if the Scots had not come in when they
came, where had the liberty of the Parliament and people been ere now. After
all this, some malicious men studying to advance their worldly condition and
private ends, by confusion in the Church, and disorder in the State, do what
they can to give a distaste to Parliament, City, and Country of the Scots, but
in vain, for as sure as the malicious calumnies of Papists, and Prelates, with
their adherents has come to nothing, and their devices fallen upon their own
heads; so without doubt ere it be long these enemies to the settling of the
Church of God with their wickedness and pride, will fall to the ground
notwithstanding all their cunning and craft, for nothing can subsist but truth
and honesty.

A Collection of diverse Papers given in to the two Houses of Parliament by the
Commissioners of Scotland.
THe sense of the goodness of God in the late victory granted to the Forces of
the Parliament, the experience of all ages wherein the greatest and most sudden
victories, have through security or negligence so far miscarried, that they
have proved either hurtful or unprofitable; and the desires we have that this
present victory may be thankfully and wisely improved to the honor of God and
the public good; have constrained us humbly to offer our thoughts and desires
about this matter of so great weight and consequence, that by this honorable
Committee they may be represented to the honorable Houses of Parliament.

First we desire, that unto the public and solemn thanks giving already
offered unto God, there may succeed a public and real testimony of
thankfulness in the speedy settling of Religion and the House of God, wherein
his glory and honor is nearly concerned; no monument or Trophee of victory
can be so pleasant in his sight; nothing will more confirm and encourage all
good Christians at home, and comfort and satisfy all the Protestant Churches
abroad; no means will be more effectual for settling of unstable minds, for
curing and preventing of Sects, Schisms and Here Is es, and for stopping the
mouths, and shaming the faces of such as have not been ashamed to say; That
the Parliament in policy pretends religion, but does not really intend it,
and thereby draw many Disciples after them.

Secondly, least victories run continually in a vicissitude, as they have at
some times done formerly, which is not only a sign but a means of the
continuance of this unnatural war; we desire that presently, while the iron
is hot, and before the Enemy gather strength again, course may be taken by the
joint Councels and forces of both Kingdoms, for the speeedy vigorous and
constant prosecuting of the war, that by the blessing of God it may at last be
brought to an end, and nothing may be left undone which may be a means to
deliver these Kingdoms from their present sad condition, under the heavy hand
of God.

Thirdly, we humbly move and desire it may be considered, whether the present
condition of the Kings Army, and the blessing of God upon the Parliaments
forces, both of them joined, make not an opportunity and such a season as is
very desirable for renewing the desires of the Parliaments of both Kingdoms,
in the most convenient and conduceable way for a just and well grounded Peace.
Thus apprehending all occasions of demanding Peace, it will appear, that
although War be necessarily in our hand, yet Peace is in our heart, and that we
follow not War as a trade, or for it self, but as a means of Peace. If it
shall please God to move the Kings heart to listen unto our just and necessary
desires, our troubles are at an end, and we may sit down in peace: But if God
shall so far desert the King, that he will still prefer the pernicious and
destructive suggestions of wicked men, unto the Counsels of the Parliaments of
both Kingdoms; In that case we may say before God, our own consciences and the
world, that we have delivered our own souls, our Enemies will be convinced
that peace is our desires, our friends will extend themselves to the
maintenance of a necessary war, and the Armies of both Kingdoms will do duty
with the greater resolution and courage, when they see no other remedy, which
may be a means upon this side to bring the war to a speedy and happy conclusion.

These our motions and desires, we humbly present to be seriously considered by
the wisdom of the honorable Houses, that the Lord Chancellor of Scotland,
being now about his journey into that Kingdom, may be acquainted with their
resolutions, and may make the same known unto the Scottish Army in this
Kingdom, and to the Parliament of Scotland, that all matters, whether of Peace
or War, may still proceed with the consent of both Kingdoms.

20 June, 1645. By command of the Commissioners for the Parliament of Scotland.
John Cheisley.

HAving now seen and perused the diverse Letters and Papers of great importance,
mentioned in the Answer of the honorable Houses of Parliament, to our paper of
the twentieth of June, which may give light to the future proceedings of both
Kingdoms, having also observed the good success of the Parliaments Forces
since that time, whereby the King and his Armies are brought to a much lower
condition, which in Divine Providence may be a further preparation to an happy
Peace; and having reason from what we have learned in time past, to apprehend,
that men will not be at rest, but still be dealing under hand, and tampering
for a Peace of their own making, and for their own private ends, to the great
prejudice of the Public, the further alienating of the Kings heart from a safe
and well grounded Peace, and the delaying of the intentions of both Kingdoms;
We do in all earnestness desire, upon the grounds and considerations presented
in our former paper, to know the mind and resolution of both Houses in a
matter of so great consequence, as is the renewing of the desires and
propositions of Peace, (in such wanner as shall be thought fit,) that we may
make the same known to the Parliament of Scotland now sitting, which may
expect no less from our trust and diligence.

28 July, 1645. By command of the Commissioners for the Parliament of Scotland.
John Cheisley.

THe pressing necessities of the Scottish Army do enforce us to represent by
your Lordships and these Gentlemen, to the honorable Houses of Parliament,
that notwithstanding the whole four months of the Ordinance be long since
expired, there is but a very small and inconsiderable proportion of money
assessed upon the several Counties for entertainment of that Army, as yet come
in to the Committee of Goldsmiths Hall, for repayment of the months pay
advanced by the City of London, and for satisfying the necessities of that
Army, which is reduced to that extremity in the present service wherein they
are engaged, that without Pease, Apples and green Wheat, they gather from the
ground, they are not able to subsist; some of the Counties, as Lincoln and
Rutland, desire to be excused, and pretend their inability to afford any
proportion of the Money assessed upon them for that Army, and little or none
comes in from the rest of the Counties. It is above a twelve month since a
months pay was ordered by the House to be paid to the Scottish Army out of the
Fines and Compositions for Delinquents Estates, immediately after the Battle of
Longmarston, a good proportion whereof is yet due, the payment of which is
obstructed by several Orders procured from the House, for payment of Moneys
for other uses, out of those Fines and compositions. Our earnest desire to the
honorable House is, That some speedy and effectual course be taken for
bringing in of the moneys due by the Counties for the four Months past, that
the Ordinance may speedily be renewed; that the House will be pleased to
appoint the Committee of Goldsmiths Hall, first to pay the remainder of that
months Pay, voted after the Battle of Longmarston, out of the Fines and
Compositions for Delinquents Estates, notwithstanding any subsequent Orders,
and that the Committee of Goldsmiths Hall may be enabled for the speedy
payment thereof, and other incident charges, that the House would call for
their reports concerning those Fines, wherein they can proceed no further
without the approbation of the Houses.

7 August, 1645. By command of the Commissioners for the Parliament of
Scotland. Joh. Cheisley.

HAving received from your Lordships some Votes of the honorable Houses
concerning the Propositions of Peace, and after some conference thereupon,
being desired by your Lordships to give our answer in writing, we hereby
present our thoughts, and offer it to your Lorships consideration, whether it
were not fit to shun all occasions of delay, in sending the Propositions of
Peace to the King, least thereby we neglect the improvement of so seasonable an
opportunity of obtaining Peace, as we have expressed in our former papers: That
to this end we are most ready, presently to concur with the honorable
Houses, for sending to his Majesty the Propositions, either all, or some, as
they have been already agreed upon in the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, for
matter and manner: That until we understand what Propositions are intended by
the Votes of the Houses, to be next sent, we cannot give a clear answer anent
the manner. That if the Propositions presented at Vxbridge, be understood with
any other of those already agreed upon by both Kingdoms, which upon mutual
debate shall be adjudged most necessary for the Peace of both Kingdoms to be
now sent, we shall be ready to concur with the Honorable Houses to desire a
positive answer thereof from His Majesty without any Treaty.

But in case any new Propositions of Peace be thereby understood, or any
material additions to, or alterations of the former Propositions, we shall be
necessitated to send these to the Kingdom of Scotland, to be there considered
and approved, as all the fotmer were; and as it is evident that we are not the
cause of this delay, so that no prejudice may thereby arise to the public, we
desire in the interim that those already agreed upon by both Kingdoms (which at
the time were thought sufficient) may be presented to His Majesty with all
convenient speed. Concerning the third Resolve of the Houses for presenting
their desires by Bills to His Majesty; If the meaning be to send the
Propositions that are already agreed upon by the Parliaments of both Kingdoms,
and seek the Kings Majesty's positive answer thereunto; and together therewith
to present Bills conform to those Propositions, for the more legal securing
of this Kingdom in the Kings grant of these Propositions, although we think it
more safe and convenient for both Kingdoms, that the security of both should
proceed hand in hand, and simul and semel, be perfected and consummated, yet if
the Honorable Houses shall insist upon the sending such Bills with the
Propositions, we are so far from giving any occasion of delay (for which we
are by some unjustly blamed) that we will be ready to concur, the Kingdom of
England securing us, as they did in the large Treaty, both in relation to the
King, and in relation to themselves, as we are bound to do the like to them.
And withal we desire, that if these Bills be not ready, the sending of the
Propositions be not delayed, the grant whereof by his Majesty will be an
engagement, and make way for his assent to the Bills. But if the meaning be to
send Bills without sending the Propositions agreed upon by both Parliaments, or
without desiring the Kings Answer thereunto, then we shall be necessitated to
know the pleasure of the Parliament of Scotland, concerning this new way before
we can join in it, and in the mean time desire the Honorable Houses to take
into their serious consideration, that the former way agreed upon by both
Kingdoms is laid aside, and that this new way of sending Bills without
Propositions was not thought necessary in any former address to his Majesty
for peace. Neither was it proposed to us, or communicated to the Parliament of
Scotland which is now adjourned, so that we cannot communicate the same unto
them for the present. That it is not in the power of any Commissioner from a
Parliament to form the Propositions in Bills, or Acts of Parliament, and to
desire the Kings ratification thereof, before such Bills or Acts be known and
agreed upon by the Parliament it self; that the way of the Propositions as
they are conceived by both Parliaments is a joint way, uniting the Kingdoms in
their desires, tying the King to both in his Grants, and obleiging both to see
these performed and preserved, each in favor of the other, and so does double
the security, as both by way of Law, and way of Covenant, and agravates the
violation of any Article, as the violation of both Law and Covenant, whereas
the way of Bills without the Propositions is a more dividing way, both of the
desires of the Kingdoms, of the Kings Answers thereunto, and of their
Obligations to see the same performed; and therefore a disjunctive way was most
earnestly pressed by the Kings Commissioners at Vxbridge, as most conducible to
their ends, and pre^^diciall to ours, and for that cause was opposed by the
Commissioners of both Kingdoms.

That seeing the Parliament of Scotland is not presently siting, and did not
know of this way, and that we cannot have power to form Acts of Parliament,
this were to propose, and desire the settling the peace of the one kingdom
without settling of the other; which as it were contrary to the Covenant, and
the Treaty, so would it be made use of by our common adversaries, to be the
occasion of ruining the peace of both; and therefore we rather desire that the
way already agreed upon by both Kingdoms may be observed, as that which will
occasion both least delay, and less danger, especially seeing we are willing
to crave a positive answer to the Propositions without any Treaty: And for the
way of security, we desire that the way so solidly agreed upon by both Kingdoms
for est^blishing of the large Treaty, and inserted in the beginning and close
of the Acts of Parliament of both Kingdoms in the year of God 1641. may be
seriously considered, as containing a threefold security, the one of
engrossing all the Propositions, and passing them by way of a Law, and Act of
Parliament; the other by way of the Kings Covenant, and Oath to his people; the
third, by the Parliaments of both Kingdoms; giving their full assurance, and
making Public Faith in name of both Kingdoms respectively for the true and
faithful observance thereof; all which upon the Kings grant of the
Propositions may be speedily dispatched; and securely settled, which is our
chiefest desire for the good of both Kingdoms.

And it were earnestly to be wished in a matter of so tender a nature as the
business of peace, wherein the mutual advise and c^nsent of both Kingdoms is
necessarily required, that neither Kingdom should engage themselves without a
previous debate, especially in alteration of any thing formerly agreed on.

14. Aug. 1645. By command of the Scottish Commissioners for the Parliament of
Scotland. Joh. Cheisley.

UPon several occasions we have represented to the Houses of Parliament the
extreme wants and necessities of the Scottish Army, and particularly of late in
a paper of the seventh of August, to which we have received no answer.

It is fourteen months since a months pay was ordered by the House of
Commons to be paid to the Scottish Army out of the Fines, and compositions for
delinquents Estates, immediately after the battle of Long-marston, a great
proportion whereof remains yet due, and cannot be paid by reason several
Orders are procured from the House in prejudice thereof, for payment of moneys
for other uses out of those Fines and compositions. It is about seven months
since the House of Parliament did pass an Ordinance assessing the several
Counties toward the entertainment of that Army, of all which there is only
come in to the Committee of Goldsmiths Hall about seven or eight thousand
pounds, for repayment of the months pay advanced by the City of London, which
is all that Army received for these seven months past; and for the months
pay Ordered by the House upon the fifteenth of August, to be forthwith provided
and furnished, there is no appearance of the providing thereof till the House
give further order.

The Houses of Parliament were also pleased to appoint two hundred pound per
diem to be paid toward the maintenance of the Infantry of that Army, which
though it has been assessed by the Commissioners of Parliament, yet has
proved very in effectual, as the Commissioners themselves have certified to
the House of Commons. We do therefore again renew our former request to the
Houses, that they would be pleased to call for the Reports of the Committee of
Goldsmiths Hall concerning those Fines, and compositions, to enable them for
speedy payment of the remainder of that months pay Voted immediately after the
battle of Long-marston, and to order no moneys to be paid by that Committee
out of those Fines and compositions, till it shall be paid. That the months pay
Ordered by the House upon the fifteenth of August to be forthwith provided and
sent to the Army, may be accordingly furnished; and that a more effectual
course be taken for bringing in the moneys assessed upon the several Counties
for entertainment of that Army.

We are informed that the Houses of Parliament have now in consideration the
sale of the delinquents Estates, and therefore have thought fit to put the
Honorable Houses in mind of the fifth Article of the Treaty between the
Kingdoms, wherein it is provided, that the Scottish Army shall be paid by the
Parliament of England, out of the Estates of the Papists, Prelates, Malignants,
and their adherents, or otherwise; and since it is clearly evident, that all
other ways for the maintenance of that Army have failed, we desire that a
stock of credit and security may be settled by Ordinance of Parliament out of
the Lands and Estates of delinquents, for payment of what is due to the
Scottish Army, and that the Lands and Estates of delinquents be engaged for no
other use, till that Army receive satisfaction, which is now most necessary in
regard of the great distractions of the Kingdom of Scotland; and we hope the
Houses of Parliament will be the more ready to supply them, that the only
quarrel the enemy does pretend against that Kingdom is, the assistance given
by them to the Parliament of England.

4th. September, 1645. By Command of the Commissioners for the Parliament of
Scotland. John Cheisly.

IT has pleased the Lord our God, who works all things according to the
counsel of his own Will, in his wise and and righteous Providence so to
dispose at this time, upon the affairs of the Kingdom of Scotland; that they
are upon the sudden brought to a more deplorable condition then could in any
probability have been expected, or the enemy himself in his pride could have
presumed.

We speak not of the devouring Pestilence, which in many parts of the Land,
especially in and about the chiefest City, has raged for a long time, in many
degrees above any thing that either our selves or our Predecessors have ever
known, and has taken away many thousands of the people, nor is it yet stayed:
This (although it has been a great advantage to the enemy, and no small
discouragement and hinderance to the opposing of his power) we acknowledge to
be a Plague from the more immediate hand of God, against which there is no
remedy from man, but the fervent prayers of the people of God, which we
earnestly desire may be here continued, as they are piously begun, till the
Lord be entreated for the Land.

Our desire is to represent what the sword of the enemy has done, after many
conflicts in diverse places of the North of the Kingdom, whereby great numbers
have fallen, and the enemy, despicable in the beginning, had increased in
strength and boldness; at last, in the very bowels of the Kingdom: He has so
far prevailed, that not only thousands of the best affected have lost their
lives, and diverse of them taken prisoners, but also our whole Army and Forces
are put to the worst and scattered. Such as were most zealous of the Covenant
and Cause of God (having no Armies on foot to join with, nor Garrisoned Towns
for places of refuge) are forced to fly for their lives, and to leave their
habitations, possessions, and all that they have in the world to the cruelty
and spoil of the enemy. Many of the common sort are drawn away by his
flatteries and promises, by the Proclamations which he makes, and the
Declarations which he emitteth at his pleasure, offering to them Protections to
their persons and estates, freedom and exemption from all the Taxes,
Impositions, and burdnings, which they are pressed with for the maintenance and
supply of their Armies in England, Jreland, and at home in their own Country;
together with the liberty of their Religion according to their National
Covenant, and all other liberties and privileges formerly established with his
Majesty's consent, upon condition that they will renounce their Covenant with
England, and take an Oath that they shall no more lift Arms against the King
and His assistants. Some of place and power, who formerly were either professed
enemies to Religion, or never took Religion to heart, have dealt falsely in the
Covenant, and presuming upon the success of the enemy, and waiting for such a
time as this is, have joined with him against their Country. The most faithful
of the Ministry, by the principal enemy, and by Malignants in their own
Congregations, are driven from their stations, and forced to seek shelter for
the saving of their lives, whereby the people left behind are laid open to all
sorts of tentations, and Religion it self is in no small danger. As we are not
willing to conceal or extenuate their misery, in this day of the Lords
visitation, so are we not able sufficiently to express them; the yoke of
their transgressions is bound by his hand, they are wreathed and come up upon
their neck, he has made their strength to fall, the Lord has delivered them
into their hands, from whom they are not able to rise up.

In this their extremity, the Committee of the Estates of the Kingdom, being
for the present put out of all hope of any success from the Forces in Ireland,
and knowing no other means of help, found it necessary, unless they would
lose the Kingdom, and lie still under such miseries as are more intolerable
then death; That the Scottish Army in England should march Northward, to the
end, that (if God in the mean time did provide no other way) they might come
to their deliverance, and withal to implore the affection, counsel, and
assistance of their Brethren in England; and therefore to send the Lord
Chancellor for representing their distresses and desires to the Honorable
Houses.

Concerning the speedy march of the Scottish Army Northward for their relief,
they supposed that Charity would move the Honorable Houses and all charitable
Christians to consider, that in time of extreme trouble, natural affection on
both sides, in calling for and in giving of help is unresistable, and that
there was no liberty left in such a case, when both the public, and every man's
private were in hazard and well near lost, either for the Committee or for the
Army, to consult or to choose what to do. That their Justice would bring to
their remembrance, that this Army (as is contained in the Treaty) was levied
and came into England for the pursuance of the ends expressed in the Covenant,
which were the safety of both Kingdoms, and their mutual defense against the
Popish, Prelaticall, and malignant party their adherents in both Kingdoms: and
that they were to be employed where they were to be most useful for the common
Cause, and for opposing the Enemy where his power and the danger was greatest.
In this notion was their marching to the North, when the King went Northward,
looked upon. And now when his Forces have so far prevailed in Scotland, their
marching thither is to be interpreted to no other sense. They supposed also
that the wisdom of the Honorable Houses would make them see, that this
expedition might, by the blessing of God, not only be a mean of deliverance to
Scotland, but also prevent the invading of England by a new Army; which, if
Scotland be altogether subdued, may certainly be expected. The timous
prevention of such an Invasion may prove no less serviceable for the good of
the cause, and of the Kingdom of England, then the present opposition of any
hostile Army within the Kingdom of England. As these necessary considerations
have moved the Committee of the Estates of Scotland to desire the marching of
their Army Northward, so are they confident, that the Honorable Houses will
rest satisfied therewith. And do expect from them, and from all the
well-affected in England, a brotherly compassion, and Christian fellow-feeling
in their bitter sufferings, all necessary assistance and seasonable supply of
Arms, Ammunition, and money, and in due time such Forces as may be spared, as
through the increase of their troubles their need shall call for and require
them. It shall not be necessary to multiply arguments to this purpose: the
wisdom of the Parliament can call to remembrance the expressions in their own
Declaration of the 7 of November 1642, and in the Papers delivered in by their
Commissioners in their names to the Convention of Estates in Scotland, August
12. 1643. Together with the Treaty and the solemn League and Covenant. It will
never be forgotten by our Brethren of England, that when our Country was in
great quietness, and the greatest assurance that was possible was offered for
our future security, we choosed, rather then to enjoy our own peace without
the peace of this Kingdom, upon the reasons contained in the Declaration of
the Kingdom of Scotland, to come with an Army into England against all
discouragements that might arise, either from the stormy winter season, or the
power of a mighty Army in the North of this Kingdom ready to encounter us.
What the endeavors, the actions, and the success of that Army were, let the
Enemy before that time prevalent, from his own sense give testimony. When the
Kingdom of Scotland had laid forth their strength for the recovery of Ireland,
and the defense of England, and promised to themselves security from foreign
invasion, especially from Ireland, upon grounds contained in the large Treaty,
and in the Propositions made by Commissioners sent from both Houses, and
particularly by the Ships, which according to an Article of the late Treaty,
were to be employed for defense of the Coast of Scotland; An Enemy
nevertheless from Ireland entered the Kingdom of Scotland, having no other
controversy, nor pretending any other cause against them, but their Treaty and
Covenant with England, and their assistance following thereupon, and has
prevailed so far, as has made this sad Remonstrance necessary at this time.

It is no matter of great difficulty (unless we will shut our eyes, and hide
from our selves our own danger and threatened ruin) to discern and determine
what is the great and maine design of the Enemy, now waxed proud and insolent
by the afflictions which the Lord has brought upon the Kingdom of Scotland:
When he has brought all there under his power, a work, which through the
malignancy of some open, and many formerly secret enemies, now appearing and
joining with him, through the sufferings, calamities, and hatred brought upon
the best affected, and such as have been most active and isntrumental in this
Cause, and through the discontent and distemper of the multitude for the loss
of their means and friends in this war at home and abroad, he presageth to
be more easy and faesceable, then what he has already brought to pass. His
second expedition is against the Parliament of England, which is not any
uncertain conjecture, but his own professed resolution and confidence; And is
too apparent, that unless he be speedily suppressed, he may through the
concourse and combination of the Malignants of Scotland, and of the Northern
Counties of England, grow to a greater strength, especially if he join with
the King and his Forces, which he is also very confident of, then be afterward
easily opposed, and thereby may reduce these Kingdoms to a more miserable
condition, in respect both of Religion and Liberty (beside all their
intervening sufferings) then they were in before the beginning of this unhappy
war.

We know the cause is the same which it was at the first undertaking, that the
Godly in Scotland who loved it from the beginning, and are resolved to live and
die in it; that the conjunction of the two Kingdoms which the enemy labors
to divide, and so to overcome, is no less beneficial to both, then it was
formerly conceived to be; That the Popish and prelaticall faction in foreign
parts as well as His Majesty's Dominions, upon the union of these Kingdoms,
are more strictly and powerfully combined then they have been at other times;
That the Reformation of Religion, the common interest of all the reformed
Churches in Christendom, groaning so long under the cross is as much to be
looked unto as ever, and who knows but the Lord in his wisdom and justice is
putting both their Kingdoms to a further trial, the one by suffering the
other by doing that it may be known, whether they have been seeking their own
peace and preservation, or the honor of his name, and the good of Religion. We
may without giving the least cause of offense in this conjuncture of time make
use of the words of the Declaration of the Convention of Estates of the
Kingdom of Scotland to the subjects there, concerning their expedition into
England, for the assistance of their Brethren only changing the persons, and if
they were not extant in that Declaration we would have expessed our selves in
another manner: The Lord save you from the curse of Meroz, who came not to
help the Lord, to help the Lord against the mighty, when we look upon the
cause which Scotland maintains, the Prayers, Tears and Blood which they have
powered forth, and the insolences and blasphemies of the Enemy, we cannot doubt
but enlargement and deliverance shall come unto Scotland, but England has
reason to fear, if upon so fair a call they sit still, and hold their peace,
they shall perish by the hand of the same enemy, and there shall be none to
deliver them. We have many grounds of assurance that this cloud shall pass
over, and after the Lord has proved and tried the constancy of his servants,
the malignancy of hipocrites, and the fellow feeling of our Brethren, his face
will again shine upon us, and his hand will raise us up and ruin our enemies;
Our desire and expectation is that in the day of our rejoicing, our Brethren
may rejoice with us and be comforted in this testimony, that they did not
forsake us in the day of trouble.

We cannot deny that during the sitting of the Parliament, and diverse times
before, this Kingdom has laid to heart the dangers of the Kingdom of
Scotland, nor can it be denied that the Kingdom of Scotland has of late given
abundant testimony of their affection and faithfulness to this Kingdom, in
departing the Kingdom in such a manner, in the year 1641. which we mention
because of the many sinister suspicions and unjust calumnies vented to the
contrary, and by their coming again to this Kingdom at such a time, for such
ends, and against so many impediments.

If any discontents, differences or jealosies have been raised, which were
nothing strange, because very ordinary and incident in time of War, a time that
uses to produce many and great difficulties, we desire they may be all
mutual forgiven and forgotten, that the War be managed in Scotland, as in
England by the joint counsels of both Kingdoms, and that in every thing a
right understanding, and a strong mutual confidence may be revived and
renewed, that either Kingdom may help the other in time of trouble, as if
they were but one Kingdom, and that the Lord may delight to bless the
endeavors of both.

Sep. 1645. By command of the Committee for the Parliament of Scotland. JOHN
CHEISLEY.

Whereas in answer to our paper of the date June 20. 1645. bearing our earnest
desires of the settling of Religion and Peace in these Kingdoms, and our other
papers since to the same effect, diverse votes of the Lords and Commons in
Parliament assembled, have been communicated unto us, which for so long a time
have not been effectual to produce the intended, and so much desired ends. We
are upon many and very urgent causes, constrained to renew our former desires,
and are very confident, that the honorable houses judging of us in relation to
the trust committed unto us, as if we were their own Commissioners in the like
case, And consider that our demands of establishing Truth and Peace, are not
only agreeable unto, but confident with their own maine intentions, for which
they have done and endured so much; We shall not only be free of the censure
of importunity; but shall have their approbation, with such an answer as may
give us satisfaction, and put our minds to rest hereafter.

And first concerning Religion, we bless God and thankfully acknowledge the
zeal and endeavors of the Parliament, for what is already done in the matter
of the Directory for the public worship of God; But cannot wonder enough what
should be the cause that the government of the Church, which is the wall of
Jerusalem, and the hedge for preserving of other parts of Religion, is so long
expected by all the Reformed Churches, especially by the Church of Scotland, so
earnestly desired by the Assembly, by the godly of the Ministry and people both
in City and Country, is opposed by the enemy as the final determination of
the controversies of Religion, and the ruin of all their presumption and
expectation ever to recover themselves, and would so much conduce for Order and
Peace both in Church and State; should stay so long in the birth, and not be
brought forth and established.

We cannot conceive the want of the love of Religion which is so acceptable to
God, that without it nothing can be accepted, and so profitable both to the
public and to every man's private, that it is the one thing that is necessary,
to be the cause; when we remember that the honorable Houses by their
Commissioners, and in their Declarations to the Kirk and Kingdom of Scotland,
and the reverend Assembly of Divines in their letters by their direction, have
so fully and frequently professed, That Religion was the controversy betwixt
them and the contrary party, And the chief ground of craving aid and assistance
from the Kingdom of Scotland, And of the solemn League and Covenant, now
known to all the World, the prime Articles whereof, are for the Reformation of
Religion as well in discipline and government, as in doctrine and worship, and
for unity and uniformity in all these, in the three kingdoms. Like as upon the
other part, it was the principal cause that moved the Kingdom of Scotland, to
deny themselves, to forsake their own peace and ease, and to join with their
Brethren in the time of their distress, for prosecuting this war, wherein they
have spent so much blood in this Kingdom and at home, lost so many worthy and
precious men and endured so many miseries; In all which and against death it
self, their chiefest comfort has been the testimony of their consciences,
that they were contending, suffering, and dying for Religion, And for the Cause
and Covenant of God, which is also the consolation of their Widows, Orphans
and Friends, whom they have left behind them.

Nor do we apprehend how the judgment or obstruction does come from any other
party: Such as have wilfully refused to join themselves in Covenant, or do
deal falsely in the Covenant, are not to be regarded, but are to be reckoned
amongst the enemies, And what ever their professions or pretenses be, are not
indeed serving the Lord Jesus Christ, or the public, but seeking themselves
and their own ends, And such as have taken the Covenant, and make conscience of
the Oath of God, will not slight Reformation, Uniformity, or the extirpation
of superstition, heresy, schism, and profannesse, far less appear against
the settling of the government of the Church, But will with all their strength
endeavor it, as the mean appointed of God for so necessary ends; No man can
be so destitute of sense and reason, as to think such an Anarchy and confusion
as now prevails in the Churches of this Kingdom, to be the Ordinance of God;
No Christian can be so void of knowledge and faith, as to imagine such a
monstrous deformity, to be the beauty and glory of the Kingdom of Christ on
earth; No brother can bear a mind so contrary to charity, as to judge such an
intolerable condition, to be the reward of so much blood as has been shed in
this cause, And of the so many and greevious sufferings of all the three
Kingdoms; Nay we are persuaded that God has provided better things for us,
that necessity will bring all that tender the preservation of Religion, and the
peace of the Church, to join at last in the right order, and government of the
Church, and that both Houses (which is all our desire, concerning this) will
add from that authority, wherewith God has vested them, their civil
Sanction, to what the pious and learned Assembly after long and serious
debates, have advised as most agreeable to the Word of God.

There be always some Incendiaries and evil instruments who will be raising
jealousies against Church Government, as a collateral power erecting it self
at the side of the Civil, and in the and overtopping it, which is nothing else
but to raise jealousies against the spiritual Kingdom of Christ, as if it
were inconsistent with the Kingdom of this World. In other places where Civil
powers are no less tender to their greatness and superiority, there is no
such thing. Upon the contrary, the Civil powers find their honor and
authority increased, the people under them more dutiful and obedient, and
their places more comfortable both in peace and war, by the Discipline of the
Church in Presbyteries and Synods. Ministers in their persons and professions
are subject to Civil authority, and though they receive the rules and
directions of their Ministry from Christ, yet may the Civil power command
and compel them to do their duty in preaching, administering the Sacraments,
and exercising of Discipline, and may hold them to such principles as are well
known by the confessions of the Reformed Churches, and their long peaceable
practice agreeable thereunto: And therefore no danger is to be feared from
their power, but much help and happiness from their faithfulness, if they
find encouragement from the Civil power, which they will greatly need against
so many difficulties as they have to wrestle with before this Church be settled
in purity and peace.

It is no mervaile that wicked men the sons of Belial are unwilling to submit
their necks to this yoke that Christ may reign over them; this is their
corruption and will prove their misery. But it is the excellency and praise of
Church Government, that it is terrible to such as an Army with banners. Nor
should it seem strange that some of the godly, who have been sore pressed with
Prelaticall tyranny and usurpation, should be afraid of all Ecclesiastical
government. But this will appear to be needless fear, when they cast their
eyes upon the sweet and peaceable government of all the reformed Churches for
so many years; and when they consider that the power of the Keys is not to be
exercised at the pleasure of any one in a Monarchical way, but by a Company
and College of Ministers and Elders, chosen with the consent of the people: Or
that others of the godly measuring the constitution of Presbyteries and
Assemblies by the corruption and profaneness of many Presbyters in the
Prelaticall times, should conceive of them as formidable to the power of
godliness; But when they shall perceive that by the wisdom and care of the
Parliament, the Presbyters and Assemblies are constituted and made up of
orthodox, pious, and select persons, zealous of the honor of Jesus Christ, and
of the edification of souls, this fear will vanish. Nor can there be any
other remedy of so many fears and jelousies, but the setting up of the
government it self, which by the power of God accompanying his own Ordinance,
will prove a comfort to the godly, a means to win many to Christ, and a
matter of rejoicing to all who have been instruments of so good a work,
especially to the honorable houses of Parliament, whom we therefore earnestly
desire, against all obloquies and impediments, by their authority to establish
it, that it may in reality speak for it self above any verbal expressions of
ours; and when we see Religion so far promoted, we may the more cheerfully
proceed in the common cause, as knowing that we have not been beating the air.

Our other renewed desire is concerning peace, which of all things, next to
truth, is most desirable; for attaining whereof, we conceive two things to be
necessary: One is, that seeing by Gods good providence, the Scottish Army is
not yet necessitated to go for Scotland, but may remain in this Kingdom, a
solid course may be taken, according to the Treaty for their necessary
maintenance, that they be encouraged to act their part, and be kept from such
other ways, as have been, and must be uncomfortable to themselves, and
hurtful to their brethren here, whereupon much discontent arises on both
sides, and by joint counsels may be directed and set in such a way for
prosecuting of the war, as may be most effectual and beneficial for this,
and consequently of both Kingdoms.

The other thing which we conceive to be necessary is, that Propositions of
peace be speedily dispatched to His Majesty. This we have pressed diverse times
before, and have waited for the results of the consideration of the business
by the house of Commons, conform to their Order of the 18 of August, but till
this time we have not heard what progress they have made. Our opportunity
herein is not greater then our Commission is urgent, and our Commandments
frequent, to take all occasions for speeding the setlement of truth and peace,
the ends which have engaged us to this war. Of late when our Kingdom in the
wonderful providence of God was brought low, we were altogether silent, lest
our desire should have appeared to proceed rather from impatience under the
sense of our sufferings, then from our sincerity and zeal of the public
peace; But now when the mighty hand of God has wrought a notable deliverance
for Scotland, and has blessed the Armies of this Kingdom with mavelous
success, by which means the King having no considerable strength to rely
upon in Scotland or England, may be humbled, and his heart prepared for
hearkening to peace, we conceive the motion to be more seasonable, and do
hope it will be more successful then ever before, and what the Lord will do
hereafter when opportunities have not been taken hold of, we do not know, nor
is it for us to conjecture: but so much we may in certainty foresee, that if
the King shall grant such Propositions as may be the foundation of a safe and
firm peace, we have that which ought to be the common desire of all the three
Kingdoms in the most easy way. And if (which God forbid) his heart shall be
still averse, our advantage is great, having besides the approbation of God,
and the eternal peace of our own souls, the testimony of the world and the
conviction of our enemies, together with the stronger resolution, when we are
at out wits end to follow the war, and thereby within a short time (through the
blessing of God) to obtain our peace.

Concerning the Kingdom of Scotland, the reports of others, and their own
speculations of the miseries of war in foreign parts, are felt of them, and
verified of late in their lamentable experience; as the want of ordinary
Courts, and courses of justice; the decay of commerce and trade by Sea and
Land, to the impoverishing of the Kingdom, and making of thousands of families
to beg, who hardly can find supply from the richer sort, because their
revenues are not paid them; the plunder and devastation of the Soldiers; the
assesments, pressures, and unnecessary burdens laid upon the Subjects for
intertaining the war, above that which they are able to bear; the great
effusion of blood, and the cutting off of many of the best affected, with other
sufferings of women and children, which are grievous to remember. And when by
the calamities of a long lasting war, they are brought low and exhausted of
men and means, the danger of drawing in the barbarous Irish, or some other
foreign enemy to their utter undoing: The difficulties and distresses of this
Kingdom through the long continuance of this unnatural war, are better
known to the wisdom of the honorable Houses, then to us: Yet after so long
residence upon public employments in this place, we cannot be so void of the
knowledge and sense of them, as not to apprehend the danger of the like
extremity at last, unto our brethren of England.

Seeing therefore the Fields are now white to the Harvest both of perfecting
the Reformation of Religion, and of making a sure and well-grounded Peace, and
there be so strong inclinations and desires, so many invitations and
encouragements, so fit preparations, and suitable dispositions on all hands for
so blessed a work, we do in all earnestness desire, that the opportunity
which can hardly be redeemed when once lost, may be improved to the greatest
advantage by the wisdom and zeal of the honorable Houses, and do expect
their speedy answer, that we may be able to render an account to the
Parliament of Scotland, or to those that sent us, and wait for it at our hands.

By command of the Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland, JOHN CHEISLEY.
September, 1645.
UPon the 26. of this instant your Lordships did communicate to us the
resolutions of both Houses, to which you desired a speedy answer, and further
acquainted us, that the Papers by us lately given in were under consideration
of the house, and that we shall receive their answer with all convenience; and
upon the 27 your Lordships renewed the same desires.

We cannot give a positive answer to the desire of both Houses concerning the
disposal of the Army because it is not in our power, but we shall communicate
their desires forthwith to the Committee with the Army, and press them with
all the earnestness we can, to which we expect they will be ready to give all
just satisfaction, so far as the season of the year may admit; and in the
mean time we desire a speedy answer to our Paper of the fourth of this
instant, and the other of the twelfth, so far as concerns Money, Arms, and
Ammunition, which is still as necessary for accomplishment of our desires, as
if the Army had marched into Scotland, and the speedy proceeding thereof will
be a great encouragement to that Army, and furtherance to their undertakings.

It is well enough known to the honorable Houses, how far that Army has
been disappointed of provisions formerly, (having, for instance, received but
one months pay these seven months past) how much their proceedings have been
retarded this Summer, and some of their undertakings frustrate for want of
necessary accommodation. And we desire it may be considered, what hinderance it
may be to the public service, if for the future effectual course shall not
be taken for their entertainment, and other necessaries.

It is agreed upon by the Treaty that 31000 li. should be monthly allowed, and
paid toward the maintenance of that Army, for real performance whereof,
many Declarations have been made by the honorable Houses of Parliament, before
and since the entry of that Army into this Kingdom; and finding the moneys
arising out of the Assessments and Revenues of the Northern Counties, were not
sufficient for maintenance thereof, did in February last pass an Ordinance of
Parliament for assessing 21000 pound monthly upon the several Counties
therein mentioned: of all which (there being now full seven months past) there
is only come in to the Committee of Goldsmiths-hall about 12000 li. which
together with 19000 li. yet to be brought in they are obliged to repay to the
City of London, for the months pay by them advanced; so that there is no
probability that any considerable proportion can for a long time be brought in
to supply the necessities of that Army, especially there being two other
assessments which precede the assessments of the Scottish Army, (although the
Treaty between the Kingdoms does precede them all, and ought to be observed as
soon as any particular Ordinance,) and these assessments for other Armies are
really executed, and moneys thereupon collected by the Counties and brought in:
whereas the assesment for the Scottish Army is almost wholly neglected, is not
executed by others, and cannot be executed by us, our very demanding the
question being clamored against, as intermedling with their estates; Neither is
it our desire in the least kind to intermeddle, providing that it were
remembered that not a written Ordinance, but real payment can satisfy the
necessities of the Soldiers.

By the same Ordinance 20 February, 1644. the Commissioners of Excise appointed
by Ordinance of Parliament, or their respective Deputies and Commissioners are
ordained to pay 3000 li. monthly out of the whole Excise arising out of the
six Northern Counties. And though the Excize is accounted, and does really
prove to all others, to be one of the best securities within the Kingdom, yet
all ways are taken to make it ineffectuall to that army, so that there has
not been one hundred pound thereof received in all, for these five months
past, the profits thereof being almost wholly anticipated and fore-stalled here
in the South, and applied to other uses, and in all appearance shall still
continue in that condition, unless the honorable Houses give further order
herein to the Commissioners of Excize for payment of that 3000 li. to the Scots
Army, according to the intent of the Ordinance.

Concerning the Coal of Newcastle, the price thereof has been so much
diminished, and the trade thereby decreased, that this last month the profits
thereof have not amounted to above eight hundred pounds, whereas they were
estimated by your Lordships in a Paper of November 1644. to seven thousand
pound per mensem, for and toward the payment of the 31000 li. monthly due to
the Scottish Army.

There was also 200 li. per diem lately appointed to be paid to the Infantrie
of that Army, whereof they never received one penny to this hour, as was
certified to the house of Commons by their Commissioners, in their Letters of
August 31.

The obstructions and failings in the ways appointed by the Houses for the
entertainment of that Army, with diverse others, we have represented in our
former Papers, to which we have never received any answer, nor seen any
effectual course taken for redress thereof. And if the Houses shall be
pleased to remove these obstructions, supply the defects, and take an
effectual course for their entertainment, the Scottish Army will be very
far from giving the least occasion to the Parliament to make any Declaration
more concerning them, nor other Armies within the Kingdom against laying of
Taxes or raising of any contribution upon any County or part of the Kingdom,
or giving any cause of complaint to the Country. And we are persuaded it is
the earnest desire of that army to evidence according to the ninth Article of
the Treaty, that their entrance into, and continuance in England, shall be
made use of to no other ends then are expressed in the Covenant and Treaty.
But if no effectual course shall be taken for their entertainment, according
to the Treaty, and that it shall not be thought lawful for them to provide for
their necessary subsistence in the parts where they shall reside, we leave it
to the Houses of Parliament to judge whether it must not inevitably follow that
they shall either starve or disband, which we are confident is as far from
the intention of the Honorable Houses, as it is against the Law of Nature, the
cause wherein, and the Covenant and Treaty whereby, that Army was engaged.

These things out the conscience of our duty and sense of the trust put upon
us, we could not forbear to express for our own exoneration; nor do we
represent them to expostulate for the time past; but that a speedy and
effectual remedy may be taken by the Honorable Houses for the future, whereby
that Army may be enabled and rendered more active in advancing the public
service.

29. Sept. 1645. By command of the Commissioners for the Kingdom of Scotland.
John Cheisley.

TO give a more positive answer to the desires of the Houses concerning the
marching of the Scottish Army to besiege Newarke was not in our power, nor
within the bounds of our Commission: But what was in our power for satisfying
the desires of the Houses, that we have done with all diligence; for we did
forthwith communicate the desires of the Houses to the Committee of the
Parliament of Scotland residing with the Army, and entrusted for their part
with the power of disposing of the Army, and with all earnestness did press a
speedy and satisfactory answer, which we do shortly expect; because by Letters
which we have received by this Post, we understand there is a meeting of that
Committee, and of some of the general Officers of that Army upon the borders
with the Committee of Scotland, and we are very hopeful the result of their
consultations shall tend to the bettering the condition of that Army, the
advancing of the public service, and the satisfying the desires of both Houses
of Parliament.

As it shall be our earnest desire and constant endeavors, That the Scottish
Army may be active in the prosecuting the War until the peace of both
Kingdoms be settled, so we cannot but renew our desires to the Honorable Houses
to take more to heart the necessities of that Army, the removal of the
obstructions, and supply of the defects of the ways appointed for their
maintenance; and we earnestly entreat for a speedy answer to the particulars
represented by us in our former Papers concerning the Army, and for settling of
Religion, and procuring the common Peace of both Kingdoms, which were the maine
causes and ends that engaged us in this War.

It may be equally considered by the Honorable Houses, when now the Kingdom
of Scotland, out of the earnest desire upon the grounds contained in the
Covenant and Treaty to procure the peace of this Kingdom, have denied
themselves and lost their own peace, and are obliged by Covenant, Treaty, and
joint Declaration of both Kingdoms, never to lay down Arms till the peace be
settled. To what straits the Kingdom of Scotland is brought, if the Houses of
Parliament, being earnestly and frequently desired by that Kingdom, shall
delay to join in seeking a safe and well-grounded Peace upon terms already
agreed upon by the joint consent of both Kingdoms, and in the mean time shall
not provide a sure way of entertainment for the Scotch Army, and thereby enable
them, according to the Treaty, to prosecute the War. When this is laid to
heart by the wisdom and brotherly affection of the Houses of Parliament, we
do not doubt but in their justice and equity they will judge of our
difficulties and desires as if they were their own, and will determine and do
as in the like case they would expect from the Kingdom of Scotland.

9. October 1645. By command of the Commissioners for the Parliament of
Scotland. John Cheisley.
