The Censure of Captain James Francis de Latoure upon certain Articles
pronounced against him by Lewis Mareschall his Lieftenant before the Council
of War.
Whereas Captain Latoure has been questioned before the Council of War
upon several Articles exhibited against him, of the truth of which there
appears no sufficient proof, but merely out of malice, promoted by Lewis
Mareschall his Lieftenant, The whole Council of War do this day fully and
wholly acquit and discharge the said Captain Latoure as clear from all the
said former Charge.

The Censure of Lewis Mareschall Lieftenant.
It is ordered by the Council of War this day, that Lieft. Mareschall being
accused and questioned upon several Articles proved against him by many
witnesses, and more especially for abusing his Quarters, resisting and opposing
his Captain, and laying to his charge several scandalous matters proceeding
merely from malice, That he shall be forthwith cashiered from his Command, make
an acknowledgement before the head of his Captain Latoures Troop, that he
has very maliciously and impudently scandalized the said Captain Latoure in
his honor and good reputation, as also humbly crave pardon for the same before
this honorable Court, and utterly be disabled from bearing of Arms, and that
he shall stand imprisoned during the pleasure of the Council of War.
