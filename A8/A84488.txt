By the Council of State appointed by authority OF PARLIAMENT.
Whereas for the encouragement of Seamen, a considerable augmentation has
been made of their Wages, and seasonable provision for such of them as have
been sick, or Wounded, and due consideration had of the Wives, children, and
impotent Parents of all Officers and Seamen that have been slain in the
present service, as also their Months gratuity, and Wages fully paid them upon
coming in of the respective Ships in which they have served, notwithstanding
all which, and the extraordinary care that has been taken by the State from
time to time for their encouragement, diverse Seamen, and others, did on the
26. and 27. days of this instant October, in a mutinous and seditious manner,
assemble together in numerous Companies, with Pistols, Swords, and other
Weapons, on the Tower Hill, at Charing Cross, and other places in and about the
Cities of London and Westminster, to the disturbance of the Public Peace; Now
to the end that such practices for the future may be prevented, which we have
too much cause to believe have been animated and fomented by discontented and
ill affected persons, and that others in time to come may not be seduced to
their own ruin, We do hereby declare, that exemplary justice shall be inflicted
upon the chief Authors or King-leaders in this Mutiny and Sedition, some of
which are now under custody; And do straightly charge and command, That no
Mariners, Seamen, or other persons whatsoever, upon pain of death, do presume
to assemble together in a mutinous or seditious manner, or any ways
countenance or abet such mutiny or sedition. And we do further declare, That a
speedy course shall be taken for the adjusting and payment of the money due to
the Seamen for their shares of Prizes, and that all due encouragement (which
shall hereafter be particularly expressed) shall be given to such as shall
voluntarily engage themselves in this present Service.

Dated at White Hall, this 27. day of October 1653. Signed by command of the
Council of State, JOHN THURLOE Secr.
