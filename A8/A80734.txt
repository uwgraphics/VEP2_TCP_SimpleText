Approved by diverse well affected Merchants, and others of the City of London.

Humbly represented to the Supreme Authority of the Nation, the PARLIAMENT of
the Commonwealth of ENGLAND.

By Francis Cradock. Merchant.

LONDON, Printed by Joseph Moxon. 1659.

To the Supreme Authority, The Parliament of the Commonwealth of ENGLAND.
The Humble Representation of Francis Cradock Merchant, by approbation of
diverse well affected Merchants, and others of the City of LONDON.
Shows,
THat the Customs and Excise being the Greatest part of the Commonwealths
Revennue, if duly Governed by a more proper Method; might be Improved at least
one hundred thousand pounds per Annum for the future: and a greater sum be
forthwith levied for supply of the present occ^sions; without distasting the
People by Letting out more then what is at present in Farm, or Raising the
Duties now Imposed.

That moreover thirty odd Thousand pounds per Annum now vainly expended, may be
preven^^d; and the business be better managed, the great trouble to Merchants
and other Traders (so much the cause of complaint against the Duty) be taken
away; to the encouragement of Trade, the Increase of Shipping, and general
satisfaction of all Men.

All which, with the anexed moddle, and Reasons demonstrating how the same may
be effected, is humbly represented; with prayers to God almighty to direct your
Honors in all things.

REASONS Humbly presented, For Reduceing the CUSTOM AND EXCISE Of the Nation
into one entire OFFICE.
1 THat the General Excise (so much decryed and Petitioned against) in its
proper Constitution is the most equitab^e of Impossi^ions: no man being charged
with it but he that sels it for profit, to the consumption of the Commodity,
who in truth pays it insensibly without Complaint.

2 That the Excise of Inland Commodities now in Farm, may be so continued for
the Interest of the Common wealth; being settled to great advantage: and having
no dependence upon the Fortain in poin^^ of mannagement is fittest to stand a
part as now se^^ed: for if reasumed the Charge in mannageing would return the
receipts thereof to the old account of above a third part less then now is made
by this Improvement.

3 That if otherwise this Honorable House of Parliament shall think fit to
Reasume other Inland farms of Beer and Ale, besides this of London: I am humbly
of opinion that the same may be more properly managed at less charge by the
following method; and the Excise now rendered so compulsive, become a more
voluntary duty.

4 That in reference thereunto all Judges now going abroad may have direction
to return an exact account of the number of Inns and Alehouses in their
several Circuits; which number being divided from the sum or number of pounds
Starling each County now stands Let at per Annum, I believe will be found to
give a reasonable product for each Alehouse to pay yearly.

5 That the former Laws Prohibiting all persons to sell Beer, Ale, Perry*
Cider, etc. without License may be revived, and enjoined to be duly executed;
and that Lycences may be granted only to such, and so many persons in each
County at so much per Annum as the Justices of Peace in the same County shall
think fit and a point: unto whose assistance may be added a Commissioner,
without whom nothing shall be transacted: who with a servant or two at most may
be sufficient to manage any indifferent County according to this method, at
little charge in respect to what is now therein expended.

6 That the unequallity in the Trades and draughts of several persons appearing
the greatest obsticle in this design; I conceive may be rectified by the said
Commissioner, who making it his whole business, may inform himself by the
former receipts, or by the People themselves, that are apt ennough to inform
him also what they paid the last Farmers; which together with the assistance of
the said Justices may enable them to put an equal estemate upon all Lycences,
according to the quallity and trade of the Persons desiring them; who will not
be unwilling to pay down a quarters rent, and give Bond yearly to be renewed,
for the remainder

7 That all Towns, Parishes and Villages, may be allowed a competent and
certain number of Inns, and Alehouses; which being once settled by Lycences at
certain rates, and all offenders th^^ sell Drink contrary to law without
Lcyence, duly punished. There will not be a License either fallen by death or
otherwise but will presently be re-taken, and the revenue be thereby brought in
voluntary, that now is paid with much trouble and unwillingness by the People.

8 That no License granted to any Person may extend further then for what Beer.
Ale, etc. he shall spend in his dwelling house; so that the Drink sold at
public Fairs during the Fair time may not be colloured or exempted from
paying Excise; which by the said Commissioner and his servants may with much
ease be collected.

9 That the said Justices or any one of them together with the said
Commissioner may have power to command all Constables, and other Officers to be
assistant unto them in their districts; and also to lay a Fine or other lawful
punishment on oftenders according to their demerrits: to be paid one Moyery to
the State, and the other to the poor of the Parrish where the offense is
committed by which means the People will be made strictly to observe the plain
laws by them understood, and be freed from that of Excise often intrapping
them, and so mystical to vulgar apprehensions.

10 That all common Brewers not selling within London, and lines of
Communication by means thereof may be dis-obliged of paying Excise for all
strong Beer, or Ale; and a penalty be imposed on such as shall sell to persons
not Lycensed that usually tapp out or retayle the same: and that in
consideration of the six pence per Barrel laid on smaller Beer, the Brewer that
will not compound may be made liable to such Imposition quarterly to be paid as
two of the said Justices and Commissioner shall reasonably calculate. Always
provided that any Brewer finding himself Injured by such esteemation and shall
together with the testimony of another make proof thereof upon Oath before the
said Justices etc. that then due allowance may be returned him accordingly.

11 That this way of management will not be so propper in London, and lines of
Communication, where the Brewer serves all that is expended; and from whom the
duty will be collected at the least Charge; but as to the Country duty the case
is much different: for there Excise being paid promiscuously by others as well
as by Common Brewers, both must be kept to a survey, which if exactly done, the
one fourth part of the receipts will not defraud the charge: by which means
both the former Commissioners and present Farmers have been enforced to
compound with all in the Country at as good rates as they could: which in
effect is the method here prescribed, dearly paid for, and brought from Holland
to England, for expedition over the Alps.

12 That what the Commonwealths revenue hereby may be advanced, I shall not
presume to estemate, but do leave it to better judgments: only shall say, that
by this way of mannagement (which more fully may be Illustrated) I conceive all
frauds practiced by Officers will be prevented; besides the expense of fifty
thousand pounds per Annum, now paid in Sallaries be taken off, and the rents
paid for Lycences (thought less then the present Compositions made with the now
Farmers) will bring in more yearly to the revenue. But my design being to
enlarge on the Customs, and Foreign Excise: I Humbly submit this, and return.

13 That the Customs and Foreign Excise if Let to Farm, or otherwise managed
by Persons Interressed, would both discontent the Merchants, and obstruct
Trade; for that the manner of placing Persons to judge in that, which if but
Implicitly concerns them, though the judgment given be just, yet will not be
so pleasing to the People, as that done by Persons more indifferent, as those
put in to manage the same properly for the Interest of the Commonwealth will
be rendered.

14 That the said Foreign Excise and Customs being dependent one upon the
other might be reduced into one Entire Office, and be better managed by the
same Comissioners and Officers, to the ease and accommodation of Merchants in
their dispatches, and the trouble to shop keepers and others in fetching of
tickets (the cheifest cause of complaint against the duty) be prevented.

15 That all Collectors and receivers of Customs their Journal or day Book of
receipts may serve as a charge to the Merchant for Excise, whose firm may also
serve for bill of entry at Custom house, and from thence be transferred to the
Ledger, which is all the trouble extraordinary, and both accounts are
completed, the trouble in this and all things else will be to both Merchant
and Officer shortened, the accounts upon occasion readier to be Examined; and
many mistakes and other inconveniences that now happen between both be
prevented.

16 That in order thereunto, in stead of the first buyer, the Merchant may be
made alyble to pay the Excise; who does the same voluntary already, in all the
out parts, and many also in London selling their goods accordingly.

17 That by making that a standing Law, which is now so differently practiced,
and falls out often as Controversies between the Merchant and first buyer, who
(although by the Law in being) is liable to pay the duty, yet the Merchant also
stands obliged to see it done, and discharged upon his account (which trouble
is in small parcels of goods sold, a greater inconvenience then the payment of
the duty) many suits in Law would be thereby prevented, and the Merchant have
more possitive warrant to demand for, and sell, both the Custom and Excise
with his goods.

18 That in liew of the Merchants standing liable to pay Excise, four months
time may be given him to pay for the like quantity he entered inwards, and paid
Customs; regard being had only to Wines and such like perrishable Commodities;
which if not sold or exported within the said term, then to have three months
time more, and no longer.

19 That a certain allowance may be computed for Leakage of Wines, and other
liquid or wasting Commodities, in favor also of Merchants, at so much per
Cent, for three months: and no other allowance to be made upon any pretense
whatsoever.

20 That the prejudice to the State for want of sooner reduceing the Excise to
a more certain method is evident; in that the said duties of Excise set on
Wines, Tobacchoes, and many other Commodities* is double as much, and in no
particular less then the duty of Customs, yet as to the same Commodities it
ever came short of bringing in as much to the Commonwealths Revenue as the
Customs has by many Thousand pounds per Annum.

21 That the Officers of Customs and Excise, are so far from corresponding
one with the other, or the one to question that which might prevent a fraud to
the others Office, (if it bring no profit to himself as servants of one Master
should do) that they are rather helpful to cheat the State against each others
Office, and the Excise man most villified, as though servants of two different
Interests; which shows how unnecessary and Inconsistant one of them stands for
the Public good.

22 That a due regulation may be made in the Officers of the Customs; so that
the inferior ones (whose truck as to the States Interest is greater then the
Comissioners) may not be enforced to pay themselves with bribes as many of them
do: and the Commissioners go away with sixteen hundred pounds per Annum, each,
for attendance but three hours in the day.

23 That eight hours in the day may be allowed at Custom House free for all
men to do business, both for Customs and Excise (that is to say) from eight of
the clock in the morning till twelve, and from two till six in the afternoon.

24 That six persons well quallified both for integrety and ability may be
chosen for Commissioners: whose sallary need not exceed three hundred pounds
per Annum, each and that two of them by turns may always be abroad in the
several Circuits, Surveying the out-ports which cannot be two often inspected;
there being most frauds practiced* not the persons of Commissioners improper
for that trust; it being the greatest of all* and most apt for Corruption when
referred only to a particular standing person; there being none to supervize
him: but according to this method they will be one supervizers to the other.

25 That one of the remaining four Commissioners by monthly or weekly turn may
also serve as a General Surveyor abroad in the port of London, without whose
inspection, or the inspection of one of the Commissioners at Custom house no
damage of Sea-wet or otherwise upon goods shall be allowed: also that bills of
sight may not be granted for the future for that under Couller thereof, and by
the prejudice of the other the State is deceived of many thousand pounds yearly.

26 That according to this regulation barely in the Commissioners sallaries
there will be preserved of what is now vainly expended, nine thousand pounds
per Annum, and the buisiness be better managed by persons that will make it
their whole employment, who only are fit for that service.

27 That a moderation may be had in other great Sallaries, fit also to be taken
down without hazard of breach of trust: and that more Competent ones may be
allowed the Inferior Officers, in whose hands the greatest trust is reposed:
their opportunities being such to favor the Merchants, who work upon their
necessities, insomuch that they often practice to deliver half the Ships
charge, without the knowledge of the superior Officers, for a small matter to
the poor Wayter on board, to the great prejudice of the Commonwealth.

28 That by the preventing the before said abuse to the State, a greater will
also be prevented; and the greatest hinderance and prejudice to Trade, now
practiced in saving Customs; whereby the honest Merchant is under-sold by such
unfair dealing persons; insomuch that he must either keep his goods by him, to
his prejudice till the others be sold and expended, or else must sell it at the
others price; which he cannot do, that truly paies the duties, without being a
looser by his adventure; especially of goods that pay great duties: which is
much to the discouragement of Trade, and worthy of consideration.

29 That better inspection may be taken to goods exported, which returns the
half subsidy: so that more may not be repaid then was received inwards; which
is now commonly practiced by Merchants; to the great prejudice of the State:
and no care taken to prevent the same.

30 That the Collectors and other Officers in all the out-ports may be governed
also by the same rules, and ordered to attend their Office for eight hours in
the day; keeping their accounts according to such propper method as shall be
prescribed.

31 That power may be given the said Commissioners to appoint Officers in the
presence of a Constable, by them to be especially authorized, in the day time
to break open any door or other place upon information where Prohibited goods
or goods stolen a shore without payment of duties are housed: or otherwise in
case of refusal that the refuser may by law be made liable to some great
forfeiture; which will prevent many frauds practiced.

32 That power also may be given the said Commissioner in case of frauds
suspected, so much practiced by Merchants coullouring the goods of others to
refuse entry, and not to permit such goods to be Landed till oath be given for
satisfaction therein, which if truly observed the Commonwealth by Alian
Custom may receive many thousand pounds per Annum the more, from Jews and
other strangers; who by means of such frauds here, are admitted into a like
fellowship, which we are denied abroad.

33 That also for an other expedient to prevent the aforesaid Frauds and
faylings frequently practiced by many (Free-marchants who though they
coullorably give but the value of 6d for a hundred pounds worth of Foreign
goods, yet will presume to enter the same as their own, and swear it also upon
a light occasion; I humbly conceive it most propper to enact that all persons
whatsoever that should either Export or Import Commodities in any Foreign
Bottom (that is to say such Ship or Vessel whereof the Master and of the
Mariners are not really naturally born subjects of England, that such persons
and no other should pay Alian duties: which will be of greater advantage to the
State, the Nations Shipping will be thereby again brought in request and
increased; with more encouragement to the poor dejected Seamen; who for want
of employment at home are enforced many of them to serve Foreign Nations abroad.

34 That for further encouragement and to prevent the Alination of Ships and
Sea men, which probably will befall England, by means of an Act made the 15th
of May last by the French King: Prohibiting all Ships not there built to export
any the Commodities of his Kingdom without License* I humbly conceive it
propper to be forthwith Enacted that any Ships not built in England, and
whereof the Master and of the Mariners are not English, as aforesaid,
Importing any the Commodities of France, may here pay 20 shilling per Tunn,
according to the burden of such Ship to be entered in Custom House, and
receive accordingly.

35 That by Impowring the said Commissioners also to refuse such Merchants
entries as stand oblidged for goods four months before entered (until he pay
the same) will be also preserved many Thousand pounds per Annum, now lost in
bad debts, by several decaying persons, whose practice is to take up the goods
of other Merchants, and firm for the Excise; with intent never to pay the duty:
but as the buisiness is now managed do upon pretense of Exportation or getting
the Officers to return the goods un-sold, and by not truly accounting once in
two or three years (if at all,) runs high in debt to the State; who are paid at
last by a beggarly apearance, or Non est Inventus.

36 That to reduce all accounts into a fair method, and prevent such and other
the like abuses for the future, all Merchants might be ordered to clear their
accounts in two months for all goods Imported before the 29th day of September
1657. the time allowed them to clear their accounts, by paying the one sixth
part; and that all such as had not the benefit of that Act against whom no
possitive proof can be made, may have their accounts balanced to that time by
remitting all which they stand charged for in the Excise books; which will be
well resented by all, and the State not prejudiced by Merchants: for that most
of what they stand charged with, is by forging of hands, and the like abuses
placed wrongfully on their accounts; who in reason ought not to suffer thereby;
and that all other goods since Imported, for which the Merchant stands liable,
may be forthwith discharged until a month before the date of such ordinance;
whereby will be brought in at least one hundred and twenty thousand pounds to
help supply the present want of moneys in the Nation.

37 That notwithstanding all provissions yet made, many frauds are still
practiced by Dutch Merchants, and others, in causing their own Ships and goods
to be seized, and setting up pretended prosecuters in the Exchequer; who serve
only for coullor: whereby the State is abused, and the penalty of an Act made
in 1651. For increase of Shipping, and encouragement of Navigation also
avoided; to the great discouragement of the native Merchants and Seamen: which
may be prevented by giving the said Commissioners power to examine the matter
of fact, and grounds of such seizure made upon oath presently after the goods
are seized; which if they find not seizable, forthwith to discharge; but if in
their judgments either coullorable seized or really seizable, then to Exhibit
a Copy of the evidence given, with the information into the Exchequer, by such
informant as they shall think fit: so that hereby the opportunity now given the
Informant and defendent to comply as they usually do against the States
Interest will be prevented, and the evidence so often wilfully forgotten by means
of their long Correspondency, and better understanding each others favors,
will be also preserved.

38 That the manner practiced by the Barrons of Exchequer and Attorney General
to compound for seizures does Encourage Merchants to make attempts of Stealing
Duties, who having also found ways to conceal much of their goods, and to
procure the rest appraysed very much under the true value; that when taken,
they are but small loosers by the adventure: which if otherwise were to be
really sold, and the said Barrons only in case of equity to give the defendent
releef in moneys according to the proportion or sum the goods should yield,
that then the owner would be engaged to procure them sold for the real worth,
much more to the States advantage, the terror be greater to offenders, and
such abuses the less Committed.

39 That this Honorable House of Parliament, will when opportunity shall
permit, take the Book of Rates for Customs into consideration; wherein by
reason the Trade is now differing from what it was at the time of making that
Book, many things are worthy of amendment, for that by taking down the great
duties set on silks, and other fine Commodities of small bulk fit to be stolen a
shore, whereof the one sixth part is not at present entered, many Merchants that
now make it their usual Custom to save their duties, will not then hazard
their goods, but make true entries; and the receipts be more improved on such
Commodities.

40 That by the Books of accounts for Customs and Excise if the same may be
produced, shall be made appear that for many years last past the Commonwealths
revennue by this method* might have been Improved (as it now may for the
future) at least one hundred thousand pounds per Annum upon the same goods
entered in Custom house: and that moreover by this regulation and by better
inspection the said Duties may be also advanced to forty Thousand pounds per
Annum more; and all men dealt justly by; according to a moderate Calculation.

41 That several other particulars propper to be put is practice for preventing
many other frauds in and about the mannagement thereof by the inferior
Officers, whereby the Revennue might be also much improved is here omitted; as
being more propper to be communicated to those unto whose care the said
mannagement shall be committed.

42 That by reason of the War with Spain (a place which vended much of our
Native Commodities) with other discouragements to Trade, now fallen into the
hands of other Nations, the Imports of this Nation for some years late past
has so much exceeded the Exports, that the plate (being the sinnues of Trade)
is drawn much away into Foreign parts; which if set at a higher value here
would not only stop that current; but cause the stream to return with increase
of Trade, also worthy of consideration.

43 That Persons undertaking to discover the frauds daily practiced by
Exportation of Wools, Leather, and Fullers-earth, so much to the increase of
Foreign Manufacturies, and decay of our own, together with the means how to
prevent the same for future may be rewarded and so encouraged, that things of
such concernment to the Nation may not ly concealed and the poor People for
want of work be driven to vehement extremities.

44 That by such regulation the forgeing Orders and Tickets, whereby the State
has been abused, and still are, with other frauds frequently practiced between
the Merchant and first buyer will be prevented; the Merchants coullor of being
so much in Arrears as he has been, (whereby the Commonwealth lost five parts
of six at once of all the Debts in the Nation) and no good way to this day
found to make the Merchant truly accountable, countable, will be also remedied;
the Shopkeeper and others be also freed from the trouble of fetching Tickets,
the Revennue be so as aforesaid improved and brought to a more certainty, all
the vulgar exclamations that the Excise so much obstructs the Nations Trade
will be also silenced, the Merchants by the Assent of the most knowing of them
be better satisfied, the Excise Officers so Obnoxious to the People be taken
away, the Commonwealths charge in Sallaries allowed them of thirty odd
Thousand pounds per Annum be lessned, and the business more quietly managed,
to the content of all People and the encouragement of Trade.

45 That if your Honors shall be pleased to agree this method and to put the
buisiness into this or the like way of mannagement, there are several other
things material fit to be added, which at you Honors Commands shall be also
prepared, and Exhibited accordingly.

49 That the Committee for regulating the Excise may again have power to
Indempnify; being the most propper and indifferent Judges between the Merchant
and Excise Officer, who on the one hand (if left to a Jury) is as sure to be
overthrown as the Merchant on the other is of delay, and expense; and that also
a Committee for agrievances may be appointed, before whom miscarriages at Law
by corrupt Council, or mis-apprehension in judgment may be rectified, and the
perjuries, cheats, and other base actions committed by such as seek the ruin
of others to raise themselves being made manifest (and not remediable at Law)
may be punished according to their demerits.

All which I Humbly submitt.
