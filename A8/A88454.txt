WHereas this Court upon the hearing of the Report made by the Committee
appointed to confer with the Lord Fleetewood touching the Safety and Peace of
this City, have received Information (amongst other things) That a Parliament
shall be called with all Convenient speed for the Settlement of this Nation;
And thereon to Act without any disturbance from the Army: It is therefore
ordered by this Court, That every Member thereof do repair to the several
Householders within their respective Wards and Precincts, requiring them to use
all diligence to prevent all Commotions, and to preserve the Peace of this
City, and in order to their own Defense and the Safety of the City, to come
forth when by the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of this City they shall be Commanded:
And this Court does hereby most strictly require and Command all Masters of
Families within this City, to keep in their Sons, Apprentices and other
Servants, to forbear any Meetings and Concourse in the Streets in any
tumultuous way whereby the Peace of this City may be disturbed: And this Court
do hereby declare, That they are fully resolved (by Gods assistance) by all
lawful means to Defend themselves and this City to their utmost, against all
Persons whatsoever, that on any pretense shall disturb the Peace of this City.
