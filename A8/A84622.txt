A PANEGYRIC To His Renowed Majesty, Charles the Second, King of Great
Britain, etc.
REturn, return, strange Prodigy of Fate!
Gird on thy Beams, and reassume thy State.
Miraculous Prince, beyond the reach of Verse,
The Fame and Wonder of the Universe!
Preserved by an Almighty hand, when Rome,
And raging Oliver had read thy doom!
Delivered from a bloody Junto (men,
That gladly would be Murderers again!)
Thy valiant Arms have strugled with the Tide,
Encountered all the Winds, and scorned their Pride:
Guarded with Angels; yet preserved to be
Distracted, heart-sick England's Remedy!
Come, Royal Exile! We submit, we fall,
We bend before thy Throne, and give thee all:
Accept Eternal Honor, and that Crown,
Which Virtue, and rare Actions make thine own.
Thou shall Eclipse the petty Courts, where Thou,
Too long a Noble Sojourner, did bow.
The Monsieur's bravery shall vail to Thee,
And the grave Don adore thy Majesty,
While thine increasing Glories shall outshine
The Plumes of the One, and t'other's Golden Mine.
The German Eagle, when thy Lions roar,
Shall flag her wing, and tower above no more;
Shall gaze upon Thy Luster, crouch down lower,
And bask within the Sunshine of thy Power:
As for those Potentates that lesser be,
They shall be Greater if they stoop to Thee:
Subjects to such a King, are better far,
And happier, than other Monarchs are.
Heaven, and brave Monck, conspire to make thy Reign
Transcend the Diadems of Charlemain.
T. F.

LONDON, Printed for HENRY MARSH at the Princes Arms in Chancery Lane near
Fleetstreet, MDCLX.
