and direct what reparations shall be done within the said churches or
chappells, and limit and appoint the time for the doing of the same; and if the
Order aforesaid be not performed, they shall bind over the said churchwardens
or collectors, or any of them, for their negligence herein to the next Sessions

the said Rents and profits, and shall have power by Warrant from the Justices
to cause the parties who ought to pay the same to be bound over to the next
Sessions, where they shall be, upon due proof and hearing the said Parties,
ordered to pay the said Rents and profits to the churchwardens, and collectors
aforesaid, who shall dispose of the same according as it ought to be disposed
of, and thereby ease the Parish of so much of the charge, and shall yearly
account for the same in their Accounts as churchwardens; Provided that this
Ordinance, as to the repairing of churches shall not extend to Parishes, or
chappelries where the churches or chapels are totally subverted or ruined by

be leavied by this Ordinance; and that they be elected and chosen in such
manner as formerly in every Parish has been accustomed.
