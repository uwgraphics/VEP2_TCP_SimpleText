CONCERNING the gouverment of the present PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND, Those are in
the behalf of the Supreme Judge to be delivered to the Lord Major and the
Aldermen of the city of London, and are by them to be made known and
manifested unto all the other Magistrates of the Cities and Provinces of the
whole Kingdom.
EVery sin is as a sharp sword, Sirach. 21. 1. Johan. 3. Johan. 8. 18.
and does so wound, that no body can heal it. For he that commits sin is of
the Devil, who is a liar and murderer from the beginning, with all those
which do not continue in the truth, but have resisted God; Therefore has he
thrust and throune Epist. Iudae. 2. Petri. 2. 1. Johan. 5. 2. Timot. 3.
the hellish Angels out of heaven. Apocal. 12. Now therefore they which after
his manner do stir up the most part of the world, Esai. 59. they do heap
sin upon sin, upon their own selves. Sapient. 2. But they which inwardly
in their Romans 1. 2.
hearts or consciences do resist the grace of God our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ Tit. 2. according 1. Petri. 1. 5. Roma. 8. 9. Johan 12. Hebr. 10. 12.
Apoc. 20. Esai. 29. 2. Pet. 2. 3. Matt. 5. 7. Lucas, 6.
to the humble Spirit of innocence, Galat. 4. 5. 6. they walk not at all in
the light; and do outwardly exalt and promote themselves to be judges one of
an other, 1. Corint. 4. and are already as much under the power of the Devil,
as those scoffers and tyrants in the first world were; whom God by reason of
their perverse courses overwhelmed with the Deluge, Genes. 6. 7. And especially
in the new Testament it is no where taught that any one shall revenge or judge
his enemies. Romans ^* Therefore principally they of England Ephesians. 4.
may according to the words of Christ, his Disciples 1. Cor. 11.
and Apostles, judge and try themselves, Ephesians. 5. whether or no they be in
the faith of Christ, or Romans 11. Collos. 1. 3 Ierem. 23. 1. Pet. 2. 4.
if Christ be in them 2. Corint. 13. for they which have not the Spirit of
Christ are not his, Romans 8. And they which do not believe the word of God or
Christ, those shall according to that same word Matt. 21. 24. Marc. 12. 13.
Ierem. 7. 8. 19. Nahum. 3.
be judged, scattered and consumed. John. 12. Which therefore to avert, noe
false Prophets, Matthew. 7. 24. no shows of any outward Temple or false service
of God shall help. And moreover no roueing, murdering, stealing, public
abominations or bloodsheading, Hosea 4. 9. 12. shall be Hezec. 6. 11. 13. 22.
Matt. 23. 1. These. 5. Luc. 3. 12. 17. Matt. 3. 13
covered, hid, or forgotten. By reason of which the day of the Lord is at
hand, in which the Lord will cleanse his barn, and the chaff (namely, the
children of iniquity, which would hinder his harvest; by whose means the good
wheat is choked,) shall be cut down and burnt in the everlasting Esai. 9,
27, 65. 66.
fire.

The only, eternal, incorruptible, invisible, 1. Tim. 1. 6. Deuteronomy. 10. 32.
Ierem. 10. 32 50. 51. Mich. 6. 7.
only wise immortal King of all Kings and Lord of all Lords, Revel 19. viz.
the strong, true and living God, Iesai. 10. 40. 45. 66. who from the beginning
has judged righteously here upon the face of the earth, which is his, Psalm. 9
17. 18. 75. 89 96. 97. 98. and Revel. 17. 19. Ierem. 23. Ezekiel. 13. Romans 16.
Phil. 3. Psalm. 89. Zach. 12. 14. Daniel. 7. 11.
appointed the ancient people, Iesai. 44. will before the end of the world, not
only have destroyed the Babylonical Whore, but also revealed and overthrown
(Psalm 141.) the hypocrisy and lies of all the other false teachers, 2. Pet. 2.
mercenaries, John. 10. or Servants of the belly. Wherefore also he still
causes to be fought forth, according to truth and righteoosnesse, 2. Tim. 2.
4. and his Judgment to be denounced: In regard of which 4. Esd. 11. 12. 15.
16. Amos. 3. Heb. 4. 10 Isai. 47. 48. Ierem. 50. 51.
it is signified, according to the power of the living word of God, more and
more, unto the Emperor, King of Spain and others, that are under the great
Babel, Revel, 16. to leave the idolatry and witchcraft of their false Prophets,
and to go out of Babel, if they desire to escape the fierce anger of God.

But amongst the pretended Evangelical hypocrites Ezekiel. 34. Matt. 24. Mar. 13.
or false Christians, he has not found to his Servant David, in no place, any
help at all, concerning the full deliverance of the elect, Ierem. 30. as also
neither faithfulness nor love, Ose. 4. nor faith, Galat. 5. Revel. 16. Titum.
1. 3 Psalm. 10. 52. 68. 94. Isai. 42. 48. 49. 60.
nor justice, Luc. 18. Those envious, nay wicked, proud, angry, haughty and
tyrannical men, who in their doings or purposes desire not at all to look
principally upon the glory of God, nor upon the universal, temporal and
eternal welfare of mankind, they should kill Christ himself, or seek Matt.
23. Luc. 11.
after his live, if he should begin to overthrow, according to the Zeal of the
Lord, their outward temple-doings and false worship of God, whereupon, 2. Tim.
4. Ierem. 7. 8. 18. Romans 1. 9. 11. Psalm. 69. 109. John. 2. Luc. 19. 1. John. 3.
Isai. 57.
for the Salvation of their souls, they do stiffneckedly and obstinately
rely, as in former times the Jews did.

But for as much as in this regard there is no peace 1. Thessal. 5. For the
furious, envious and bitter Cain in his generation, they in England especially,
may look very well to themselves, how to behave them, concerning these so long
lasting troubles Luc. 21. Matthew. 24. Psalm. 2. 99.
and insurrections of war, whereby Satan is wholly set loose with rage and
fury, Revel. 20. and to take heed, least they further trespass and sin,
Obad. 1.
in using ill those poor innocent souls, Ierem. 2. Romans 1.
the soldiers or the flock of the slaughter, Zachar. 11. who, by the unjust,
nay crafty, murtherous and traitorous design, Ezekiel. 22. of the Scots, are
fallen into their hands.

For no body ought to be himself judge over another Romans 12. 1. Pet. 2. Psalm.
10. 94. Sap. 6.
1. Cor. 4. Seeing it is not only against the new, but also against the old
testament, and cannot avail nor subsist before God, the judge of all. Hebr.
10. 12. And because no wordly magistrates, no nor those, Amos. 2. 3. 4. 5.
who in their office are by God himself appointed to judge and to govern,
have any power or license, to charge the poor people and subjects, Isai. 1.
32. 53.
with such a burden, nor to flay them, according as they please, for to
maintain their violent gouvernement Mich. 3.
invented by themselves, Amos. 6. therefore this printed letter, sent thither
once already, Iam. 5.
is before all other things very well to be considered: Eccles. 10. 35.
It has been directed many years ago, because of the troubles of Germany
principally, to the two Princes Electours, of Saxen and Brandenbourg, but it
belongs also unto all the other pretended Evangelical Magistrates, Princes,
Judges and Sap. 6. Romans 1. 11 Mich. 7. Isai. 30. Matt. 29. Psalm. 82. Isai. 8.

States there; who in their apostasy, hypocrisy, falsehood, unbeleefe and
prevailing iniquity, have also undertaken to protect and defend themselves
against the Counsel and Spirit of the Lord. Isa. 1. 8. 30. 31. Whereupon there
has been kindled such a fire, in that murdering den. Ierem. 7. 11. 15. 17. or
bloody city of this false Jerusalem, Matthew. 21. 24. Marc. 11. that in many
places or countries there have not been left neither men nor beasts, Zephan. 4.

1. To pass over in Silence, that the afflicted fellowmembers, or those that
are of the household of faith. Gal. 5. 6. by reason of such cunning despisers,
Isai. 28, and inconsiderat violent men, are constrained to remain under the
Babylonien yoke or abomination, and to be in danger, to perish eternally with
body and soul, Dan. 12. which also will bring Ierm. 23. Act. 20. Matt. 7.

their dreamers. (Epist. Iud.) the terrible ravening wolves risen in the flock,
first off all into hell, as being such, upon whom men have relied concerning
their salvation, and by whom Satan has enticed to all wickedness. Wherefore
it has bee^ written very sharply and powerfully unto the Scots, especially,
that for the maintaining, establishing or propagating of their Covenant, they
should not Subject themselves unto the whisperings of such unclean Spirits,
the false prophets, in such a manner, as a time hitherto has been done with
the destruction of the poor and miserable by other warriors and tyrants,
theefs and murderers, Ierem. 7. 19. and principally by those in Germany, by
whom all is so far become a Spoil, nay quite a curse. Ierem. 2. 17. All
which shall as yet be judged on the children of that wicked one Isai. 3. who
have Deuteronomy. 32. Romans 12. Tit. 3. Matthew. 7. 13. 24. Romans 2. 14 1. Cor. 4. 2.

entrenched upon the vengeance of God the Most high. Psalm. 94. Hebr. 10. and so
undertaken, by their unjust purposes or envious doings, according to the
working of the furious Satan within the^, to hinder, nay quite to bring to
naught the harvest, wherein God according to his word and Gospel, will judge
the hidden things of the hearts; Who therefore shall thrust in his Sickle and
cut off many into the very hell, and execute vengeance in anger and fury,
Mich. 5. and make all his ennemies his footstool. Psalm. 110. Hebr. 1. 10.

men should have waited and hoped according to the righteounesse in the Spirit
by faith, Gal. 5. and by no means in such a manner, as the stubborn,
obstinate Jews blinded by the Devil, have done, when Christ their poor
despised king came, Isai. 53. Zach. 9. 11. 12.

CONCERNING The troubles and the false JUDGMENT In ENGLAND.
GOD is just, and his word does not lie. For Deuteronomy. 10. 32. Tit. 1. Hebr. 6.
John. 8. 12 Ierem. 23. Matthew. 5.
it is impossible, for God or for the strength of Israel to lie, 1. Samuel 15.
Malac. 3. And he will have that same his word kept, or performed according to
his council and will, Matthew. 7. 24. 25. According to which he has dearly
signified unto those in the second or new Testament, that they should not
revenge them selves on their ennemies Romans 2. 12. 14. 1 Thessalonians. 5. Wisdom. 6.
12. Psa. 10. 94.
and judge nothing 1. Cor. 4 nor render evil for evil, but to leave all
revenge unto God 1. Pet. 2. Who judges righteously and without respect of
persons, Deuter. 10. and will not suffer vengeance to be taken from him, as a
while hitherto diverse have attempted, intending to hinder the Kingdom of God,
nay to bring to naught (Matthew. 24) Dan. 2. 7. 12. Marc. 13. Revel. 16.
his Judgment, concerning the universal redemption of his elect, Luc. 18.
When I being there present had put to mind unto the King of England, that what
He and his Parliament had taken from the subject, for to kill and destroy one
another, they maight have employed it for to help their poor neighbors in
Germany, He did answer, that it was true: Which those his adversaries, by whom
he is killed, have not done, nor desired to regard the common temporal and
eternal welfare of mankind: but they undertake after the fashion of the Jews
2. Cor. 10. Romans 1. 16.
in former times, to set up an earthly and worldly Dominion, wherein the inward
obedience within, the conscience toward God shall cease, nay have no place at
all amongst them: And besides this, the 2. Tim. 3. 4. 1. John. 2. 4.
strive and discord of the Scribes or worldly learned men, whence originally
all the destruction in whole EUROPE is risen, shall remain. It agrees
therefore very ill, that such men who in regard of the hope of faith are quite
separated from Romans 8. Hebr. 11.
God, do hope the confirmation of their Commonwealth from those under the
great Babel, namely Romans 16. 17. Psalm. 125. 146.
from the King of Spain and his like, and approve thereof, whereas they have
killed there King even for this cause, that, as they pretend, he had favored
the Roman Catholics and complied with them. But there will be an ill end with
those men that do Epist. Iudae. Mica. 6. Iam. 5. Mica. 3. Malac. 3. 4. Isai.
57. Psalm. 10. 68. Amos 5. Hebr. 10. 12. Luc. 12. 17. 18. 21. Matthew. 24. Romans
2. 12. 14. Psalm. 94.
not obey, nor take notice of this present and last time, Dan. 8. 11. 12. but
dare begin with the revenue of the country and means of the subject, the which
they force and squeeze out of them and wast, according to their pleasure, such
tumults and insurrections, whereby the outward opposition grows the longer
the greater, and the inward fire, because of envy and bitterness, becomes
burning more and more. The true believers ought, according to truth and
Justice, Psalm. 89. 97. to look upon God and upon the universal temporal and
eternal welfare of mankind, and therefore not to be judges themselves, 1. Cor.
4. For God suffers not vengeance to be taken from him, Hebr. 10.
