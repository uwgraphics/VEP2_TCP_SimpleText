A CRY FOR REPENTANCE, UNTO THE Inhabitants of London chiefly, AND Unto all
the WORLD, Whose fruits do shame their profession, and that they may come to
yea and nay, in all their communications and dealings, that their life may
judge the world; for who are out of that, are in the evil, and falls into the
condemnation of the DEVIL.

Given forth for the information of the simple, that they may know the way of
life, out of the evil communication which corrupts good manners.

Lonnon, Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate. 1656.

A Cry for Repentance.
REpent, repent ye tradesmen of London; repent ye Merchants and great men of
the City, the Day of the Lords hand is coming upon you; the day of the Lords
Wrath is to be poured upon you who have lived in wickedness, fullness and
gluttony, and serving the creatures more then the Creator, who is God blessed
for ever; and serving your lusts more then Christ, and making your Bellies your
Gods, fatting up your selves with the Creature, until you have forgotten God,
until you grow proud and wanton: Alas! heap not up Treasure upon earth, where
Thieves, and Rust, and Canker is, but consider all of you what Treasure you
have in Heaven: Ye Tradesmen, and of whatsoever Calling you follow turn to the
Lord by Repentance: Ye Watermen and Fishermen repent, and put away your evil,
and turn to the Lord to Repentance whilst you have a day of Mercy offered
you: Ye poorer sort of people, who are drudging laboring and toiling in the
earth under the great ones, repent: All ye small and great, is not your labor
for the mouth and Apparel, yet your Appetite, your Lust and Eye is not
satisfied: Ye Teachers of the people, called Priests, who are got into the high
places; Repent, and give over deceiving them, that ye may be found in the life
of what you profess: And ye Rulers and Magistrates of what sort soever, high
and low, small and great, repent, repent, that ye may be found all in Justice
and Judgment, that this may run down your Streets, and in them righteousness
reign, and the Streams and Floods of ungodliness may not run down, but be
stopped: Ye proud and idle people, men andwomen, repent, and come to acknowledge
the Lord the Creator; and ye proud of the earth, great, rich and small, turn,
turn to the Lord: And all you Lawyers repent whatsoever, that oppression may be
taken off, and exacting there may be no more; and mercy may be showed to the
helpless, and the Jaws of the wicked may be broken that would woory and rend,
and tear the innocent to pieces, that the oppressed, the needy, and the
helpless may be sought out, and of his burden eased that the Lord may bless
you: And all ye Husbandmen, Tillers of the earth, or Keepers of Cattle, repent,
that your minds may be brought out of the earth, and ye turned unto the Lord,
and that your minds may be brought out of the greediness of gain; ye buyers
and sellers of Cattle, and all others that are greedy of Gain, greedy after the
earth greedy after riches, greedy after fashions, for this will men and women
destroy one another, the world of ungodly ones will destroy one another with
lies and flattery, through greediness after Gain and the earth; Repent, the
voice and sound of Repentance is cried through you all, which reaches to the
root of you all; and the Ax is laid to the root of the Tree, and every Tree
that does not bring forth good fruit to the Lord God must be cast into the
fire; for the cry and voice of Repentance is sounded and sounds through you
all, rich and poor, small and great: All Tradesmen, Lawyers, Merchants, Seamen,
Husbandmen, Traders among Cattle, Judges, Justices, Rulers and Magistrates, and
ye idle people of the Land, repent, for the day of the Lords Wrath is at hand;
his Vial is to be poured out on you all. And again all you Tradesmen,
Merchantmen whatsoever, or Rulers, or Judges, or Justices, or Lawyers, or
Husbandmen or buyers or sellers of Cattle, keep to yea and nay in all your
communication, whatsoever is more is evil: Is it not as well to say yea, and
nay, as to use so many words? Is it not as good to keep to yea and nay to keep
you out of the evil? This is the Word of the Lord God to you all men whatsoever.

And again you Tradesmen, Merchantmen of all sorts whatsoever, buyers and
sellers, set no more upon the thing you sell or exchange but what you will
have; is it not better and more ease to have done at a word, then to ask double
or more? Does not this bring you into many vain words, and complements, and
talks that fills the vain mind? This is deceitful before God and man. And is
it not more savoury to ask no more then you will have for your Commodity, to
keep to yea and nay in your Communication, when you converse in your Calling,
then to ask more then you will take? and so is not there the many words where is
the multiplying of sins? This is the Word of the Lord to you, Ask no more then
you will have for your Commodity, and keep to yea and nay in your
Communication, and here will be an equal ballancing of things, and a
consideration before you utter words, and a useing of this world as though you
used it not; and a possessing as though you possessed not; and so you will come
to show a life like Christians, and the spirit like Christians, and you a
people in Christ's Doctrine, that loves his Doctrine which keep to yea and nay
in your communication; and you will not be a people that be high, and proud, and
lofty so a child shall trade with you as a man, because of the Equity, and
yea and nay, and righteousness and true weighing of things, and true
consideration of things, and people shall not be afraid of one cheating the
other, or destroying one the other where truth and equity is among them, and
mercy and righteousness, and no more is set upon the thing then what they will
take, who are in their yea and nay in their Communication here is the
consideration before words be uttered, and where the power is over the tongue,
the life of a Christian is seen.

Ye Porters and other Laborers, and light and loose people, repent; and all ye
laboring people whatsoever, and Judges of the earth, repent, repent, and turn
to the Lord God, lest against you the Lords hand be turned speedily, and you be
found those that are convinced, and do not repent, to give glory to the Lord
God, lest into the bed of sickness ye be cast, and sudden Judgments and
Plagues come upon you, for God is able to abase the Pride and Vanity, who have
boasted in Hills for salvation who cannot save themselves; therefore all ye that
have lived unrepented, whose lives* are not changed, you are them that have
cumbred the ground; fruitless Trees that has not brought forth fruit to God;
therefore has the streams of ungodliness, streams of unrighteousness, rivers
of wickedness, floods of many wate^s running so up and down the Nations of the
World, which the woman set upon which sits upon the beast; so has Christians
been an ill savor, their Conversation, their Communication, who has been out
of the Yea and Nay, the Righteousness and Judgment and are more then at a
word in their Calling and Trading, and Commerce with people, which the Heathen
which are not Christians, these judge them as the Gentiles the Jews. Oh ye
Christians, let your ways judge the Heathen, let your Lives, Communication,
Conversation judge the heathen; let it not be in the earth, but in heaven; ask
no more for the Commodity you exchange then you would have. You Tradesmen,
Buyers and Sellers of all sorts, or Hirers of Laborers, at a word speak, and
see before you speak keep to yea and nay in all your Communications, this will
keep you out of the evil, whatsoever is more comes of evil; with this will you
come to answer that of God in the Heathen, who in righteousness God will
judge. Alas for you! all your Profession of the Scriptures, of the Apostles,
Christ's and Prophets words, and you be found out of the life of the Prophets,
Christ and the Apostles, ye are but as the Jews were, which Christ said the
Devil was their Father; and as the Pharisees, Scribes and Priests which Christ
cried woe against, called whited walls and graves, vipers and serpents, venoming
and poisoning one the other, being not in the life the Scripture was given
forth from, are found such as the Apostles spoke of, vain Janglers about words,
and vain Disputers, and bring the Scriptures to oppose one another, and
disputing of Christ and the Saints words, brings Scripture as the Devil did,
are out out of the life that gave it forth, and disputing about the Body of
Mose, such be in the unrepented estate, which eat and drink damnation to
themselves, not discerning the Lords Body; therefore be ye warned. This is the
Word of the Lord God to you all ye Rulers of the earth, that righteousness
mercy, and judgment and equity may run down, streaming in the Nation, that the
oppressed may feel relief, and the peaceable eased, and the poor and needy may
not be turned away, that this may run down; all that which is called
Christendom, that professes Christ who is come to reign, and set up his
Kingdom in Power, and Authority, and Majesty, who raises up Jealousy as a
man of War in all unrepented ones, that the thoughts of men are full, and their
imaginations and conceivings are at work: But the Lord is risen and rising, who
will make waste him that has made desolate, who will judge righteouslie,
according to the secrets of every man's heart, who will enter into the house,
bind the strong man, and spoil his Goods. The heart of all will I search says
the Lord, the re^ns of all will I try; the ways of all will I bring to light;
the spirits of all will I manifest, and according to them will I judge, who will
make every one to confess that my ways and judgments are righteous, and
renders to every one a reward according to his works, whether they be good, or
whether they be evil; I come quickly, and my reward is with me says the Lord
God Almighty, and there is nothing shall escape in the heart, but its secrets
shall be revealed, and the things that thou have done in the body shall thou
give account for; I will exalt my kingdom, and set it upon the highest Throne
who tread Dominions and Principalities under my feet, who puts down the
authority, who bears my Government upon my shoulders; the Lord our
righteousness is his name, who judges according to the secrets of every man's
heart who does enlighten every man that comes into the world, with which he
shall see when he does evil, and when he does wrong, which is his condemnation
that hate it; but he that loves the Light which he is enlightened withal, and
believes in it, shall receive the Light of Life.

And all you makers of Images, and makers of Baubles and Toys to please the
Lusts and Vanity of people; Repent, repent, lest God consume you with the
Vanity; Repent, lest God lay you in the dust with them, and make you like unto
them. And all you that delight in fine Houses, and Apparel, and the eyes are
fixed in those things; repent, least God destroy you with them. And all you
Star gazers and Tellers of Fortunes, and drawing people to gaze after your
fancy more then after the Lord, repent, and be silent, and cover your lips,
and give over your witchcraft, lest God cut you off, and destroy you, and make
a sudden end of you for your heap of confusion that has long reigned and ruled
against the Lord; Gods Arm is turned, with which he will gather his people to
himself* the Furnace is prepared; the Oven is provided, and the high buildings
shall be laid low, and the Cities waste and without Inhabitants: The Lord God
is bringing his people to his City, and many are in their way wandering to it;
and many are entered into their rest. Therefore to you repented ones is this,
and to you unrepented ones, that you may come to see the way hither out of the
earth, clay and unrighteous, the way and path of life, which leads to God the
Father of Life: And to you this is the word of the Lord God, from him that
dwells in that which comprehends the world, and answered this shall be with
that of God in every one of you,

G. F.
Have not Ribans, Jewels, Images and Baubles carried away the eyes and hearts
of people, which brings them to loose sincerity; O repent ye whose hearts and
eyes are given to vanity, least the Lord come upon you like Mortar and Clay,
and tread you to pieces like Potsherds:
