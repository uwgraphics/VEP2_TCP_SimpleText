HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER To the Message, or Proposition, sent the last of December
past, by the House of Commons, for a GUARD.
WE have taken the last Message from you, touching your desire of a Guard, into
serious consideration, and truly with great grief of heart (that after a whole
years sitting of this Parliament, wherein you have obtained those things, for
the happiness and security of your selves, and the rest of Our Subjects, as no
age can equal) instead of reaping in Peace and tranquillity the fruits of your
Labors, and of Our Grace and affection to Our People, We should find
Jealousies, Distrusts, and Fears still so prevalent amongst you, as to induce
you to declare them unto Us, in so high a measure as you have done at this time.

We are wholly ignorant of the Grounds of your Apprehensions, but this We do
Protest before Almighty God (to whom We must be accountable for those, whom he
has entrusted to Our care and Protection) that had We any knowledge, or belief
of the least design in any, of Violence, either formerly, or at this time,
against you, We would pursue them to condign punishment, with the same
severity and detestation, that We would do the greatest attempt upon Our Crown.

We know the duty of that place where God has set Us, the Protection We owe
to all Our Loyal Subjects, and most particularly to you, called to Our Service
by Our Writs; And We do engage unto you solemnly the word of a King, That the
security of all and every one of you from violence, is, and shall ever be as
much Our care, as the Preservation of Us and Our Children.

And if this general Assurance shall not suffice to remove your Apprehensions,
We will command such a Guard to wait upon you, as We will be responsible for
to Him, who has encharged Us with the Safety and Protection of Our Subjects.

WHITE HALL, 3. Jan. 1641.
FINIS.
