Die Martis 25 April, 1648.
WHatsoever dangers are threatened or feared, either by divisions amongst our
selves, or practices from Enemies abroad, we have assurance out of the word of
God that we are not in the least danger, if God Almighty be not incensed
against us for our sins and wickedness, which our Consciences testify that he
is exceedingly against every one of us in particular, and the Kingdom in
general, yet we believe that if we do heartily and sincerely humble our
selves and turn to the Lord, crying mightily to him in fervent Prayer, with a
lively faith in Christ we shall certainly be delivered from all evils and
dangers, and enjoy all needful blessings and benefits to the whole state and
Kingdom, therefore the several Ministers within the Cities of London and
Westminster and the late Lines of Communication in their respective
Congregations are desired upon this ensuing day of Humiliation, being the six
and twentieth of this Instant April, earnestly to seek the Lord, who is the
God of all wisdom and help, in much mercy to this sinful and distracted
Nation, so to direct and bless the Counsels and proceedings of the Parliament
at this present, that his heavy Judgments may be diverted from us and truth
and peace established throughout the three Kingdoms.

Ordered by the Lords and Commons, That this Declaration be sent by the Lord
Mayor, to the several Ministers in the several Congregations within the
respective places aforesaid.

Joh. Brown Cler. Parliamentorum.
