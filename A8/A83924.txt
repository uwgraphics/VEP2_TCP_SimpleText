Die Iovis 18 Februarii 1646.
WHereas Provision is made by the Statutes of this Realm for the perservation
of Game in this Kingdom, and that the Justices of the Peace, and others are by
the said Statutes authorized, and required to punish the Offenders in that
kind as by the said Statutes does appear. But by reason of the great liberty
that several idle and loose persons at this time take unto themselves by Guns,
trasing of Hares in the Snow, setting Dogs, and other unlawful means to kill
and destroy the Game of all kinds throughout the whole Kingdom, in contempt
of Law and Authority, which if not timely prevented will prove a destruction to
the said Game in all parts. It is Ordered by the Lords in Parliament assembled,
That the Justices of the Peace in the several Counties of the Kingdom, and
especially about the Kings Honors, Castles, Parkes, Chases, and Houses, are
hereby charged and required by virtue of their places, and the tenor of the
said Statutes, to take special care that they put the said Statutes in due
execution against all such Offenders, as shall trespass in this kind
according to the nature of their several Offenses: And herein the said
Justices of Peace, and others authorized, are hereby required to take special
care in the execution of the Premises, as the contrary will be answered to
this House.
