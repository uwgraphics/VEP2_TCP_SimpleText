Critical REMARKS Upon the ADVENTURES OF Telemachus.
IN truth, Sir, you are a dangerous Enemy; it is neither fair nor civil to take
so much Advantage of the Power ye have over me. I have my Reasons for my
Silence; why should you urge me to Garrulity? I tell you over and over again,
all People look upon Telemachus to be an admirable Piece: Never did Hero appear
upon the Stage with such an universal Applause. It Is witty, delicate, natural,
it is mysterious and enchanting; what would you have more? Oh! but say you, I do
not ask your Sentiments about the relish of the Public; I am sufficiently
informed of the great noise which this little Romance makes among the curious;
it is the Subject Alamode for Conversation; but I desire to know you Thoughts
concerning it. To what an inconveniency do you expose me? I must now be looked
upon in your Judgment for a ridiculous Manhater, if I cannot discover in this
Piece, those pretended Beauties that charm all other Readers. Am I not already
sufficiently unfortunate, to be posess'd with a cross thwarting Humor, but
that I must be obliged my self to reveal my own Shame? All the World admires
Telemachus; on the other side, I that can find nothing in it worthy Admiration,
yet do my self this Justice, for my want of a good Palate, that I admire my own
Stupidity. This I take to be an ingenious way of shifting off the Condemnation
of the Piece; and any other Person but your self would discharge me, after such
a Confession. You might blame me for my want of Judgment, without putting your
self to the trouble of exacting my bad Reasons. But I know your Humor in
respect of my self; my fantastical Conceits divert ye, and you have done me
the Honor to tell me, that you take some kind of delight to see me fencing
with the Multitude. It shall not then be said, that it is long of my ill Nature,
or Momus-like Temper that you are not satisfied. I will then faithfully Copy
out the Idea which I have fancied to my self of the famous Telemachus, and give
you leave to Laugh, upon condition that you laugh in a corner alone. I have but
three Assaults to make upon this impregnable Fortress. I shall first examine the
design that sent Telemachus abroad into the World; in the next place, I must
attack the Style of this ingenious Fiction: And lastly, I shall endeavor to
unfold the meaning of this same Satyr, altogether Mystical, which as some will
have it, the Author has with such a zealous Devotion displayed against the
Wisest and most Potent Government that ever was.

Now then, that I may make my Conjectures, as all others do (for I must tell
you, I have no other foundation to assure my self either of the Name or
Intentions of the Author) The aim of the Work is Great, Noble and Lofty: To
teach a young Prince the purest Maxims of Wisdom, to set Vice before his Eyes
in all the hideous shapes of it, to make him relish the lovely sweets of
Virtue, to rehearse in his Ears a thousand and a thousand times over, that
Wickedness is the cause of all Misfortunes, and that Justice is the Fountain of
all Happiness; to form his Mind according to the most lively Lights of
Knowledge and Understanding; to render his Heart impenetrable against all
Irregularity, this is to conceive a design to raise his Royal Pupil to the
Pinnacle of Glory, and to procure the Felicity of the People, who are one Day to
live under the Dominion of this young Prince. But with your good leave, has
this design been put in execution, in such a manner as to promise good Success?
For my part, had I an intention to spoil a young Inclination, I would give such
a Youth Telemachus for his Pocket Book. Nor can I disapprove the Raillery of a
Courtier, who was saying the other Day, that if the Duke of Burgundy were wholly
guided by this Romance, the Crown of France would be in danger of falling under
the Government of a Distaff. They with whom he was joaking, understood no other
wit in his Jest, but that he meant Minerva in disguise. But he drove higher, as
I understood from one of his Acquaintance; for his meaning was, that if ever a
Telemachus reigned, under the Auspices, and by the Counsels of such a severe
Goddess, Vision, Chimera, and Fanaticism would sit upon the Throne. If you
guess, as I make no question but you do, at the Brain that was delivered of
this Fancy of a Romance, beware of revealing it: For in jesting with Jupiters
Wisdom, you would ruin the Reputation of a judicious Man, which an illustrious
Friend has acquired in the World; there would not be a Wit o'th'Town but would
be ready to throw a Stone at him, and all would cry out, that 'twould be better
for them to be lodged in a Mad-house than in his great Palace. But since it is
yours and my Profession not to judge of things by the common relish, let us
weigh his Proofs, and see who is in the right, whether he or all Mankind
beside. You your self have told me a Hundred times, that the Labors of Fiction
are poisoned Springs, from whence young People know not how to draw, without
interesting the Exactness of Discernment, and and without receiving dangerous
Impressions against the uprightness of the Soul. Poets and Writers of Romances
never speak like other Men, being forced to follow another Road then that of
Nature, to arrive at that sublimity which they seek for in themselves, they
overdo what ever they go about. The Fire of Imagination, in them, supplies the
place of profound Reasoning. But reduce these pompous Descriptions, these
glittering Images, this refined Tour to the Terms of good Sense, it is only the
flash of the Powder that has passed before your Eyes, and leaves nothing behind
but the ill scent. Nature and Truth are in the Hands of these Gentlemen to be
daubed, and fucuss'd over as much as they shall think proper for their own
Purposes: Never believe that they present before us those two Countenances with
that simplicity which is their principal Ornament. They are ashamed to say with
the Vulgar, that the Sun rises and sets; that it has been a plentiful Harvest;
that the Meadow is covered with Flowers; that the Water is clear; that the
Trees are laden with Fruit. Pitiful Expressions that would make those inspired
Enthusiasts blush There is a much more noble elevation of Wit to be made use of
in explaining to us the Motions of Nature, under the sublime Emblems of Dewy
Charies, Crystal, Pearls, Diamonds, and all those other pretty Toys of which
our Telemachus is a true Magazine. Is he to commend a good Prince? He is exempt
from all humane Infirmities; his Merit surpasses Imagination, and he has
performed those Achievements for which there want examples in Story; and the
Virtue of that Hero is as inconceivable as Pure Love. It is his business to
censure the Conduct of an ill King? there is no mercy to be expected, he is a
Tyrant; he has made unjust Wars; he has broken Faith with his Confederates; in
the midst of Peace he has surprised 'em, pillaged their Cities, burnt their
Houses under ridiculous pretenses; he has violated his Oaths, ruined his
People; he has invaded the Rights of God, oppressed his most faithful Subjects;
he has openly justified Adultery; he is a monster abandoned to his own
Obduracy; it is in vain for him to have recourse to the Gods, they are
inexorable to his Prayers; their anger is just ready to thunder upon his Head;
Monsieur the Poet has pronounced the Decree, nor will he bate a tittle of the
Sentence. Well, Sir, what do you think ont? do you believe a young Prince to be
well plae'd in the Hands of such a sort of Guides? Sometimes climbing to the
top of a Mountain, sometimes descending to the bottom of a Valley; never moving
upon even Ground; to have always a slippery Ice before their Eyes; call you
this an easy Road to arrive happily at a Throne? To what purpose is it to
create an imaginary World in order to teach a young Prince how to reign in
ours? Our Kings are not like Kings upon a Theater, who only enter upon on the
Stage to represent fabulous Persons; They ought to govern according to the
Laws, and according to the present time, and this is that wherein they ought to
be instructed, without fetching compasses about, and the refinement of
Hyperbolical Language. You will not deny but that Kings have more need of
Judgment and Penetration then other Men, for they suffer themselves too
frequently to be surpised by prejudice; and that crowd of Flatterers which
environs 'em is a Rail that Truth has much ado to leap over. How then is it
possible for a young Prince to walk in a hazardous Country, where he runs from
Phantom to Phantom, from falsehood to falsehood, where he meets with none but
Objects capable to seduce a better instructed Reason then his own? Did you
never spend a serious thought, Sir, upon these Portraictures so flattering and
so apt to tickle the Senses? I am certain you would never, upon such
Considerations, expose such charming delusions to the Eyes of your Family, much
less, if you have been called to the Prelature, would you do it to any other
Person. What shall we say of those Courtesans of Goddesses, amourous even to
Transport, pensive, jealous, restless, furious, and sometimes driven to
despair? The devotion of the Cretan Women for Venus and her Pleasures? the
Passion of Calypso to captivate Telemachus in her golden Tresses, and the
fruitless Toyls of Cupid to the same purpose? You may look upon these things as
Trifles if you please, but in my Opinion, the leading of a young Prince into
these slippery places, is in some measure to couple his Mind with Superstition,
and expose his Heart to dangerous Attacks; for in short, what a strange method
is it for the instructing of a Christian Soul, to teach it down right Paganism,
to carry a Disciple into enchanted Places with an intent to infuse into him an
abhorrence of Pleasure, to expose him to violent Temptations, with a design to
render his Innocence invincible? This is the utmost that a consummate Quietest
durst presume to undertake; and yet perhaps, he would find a necessity of
intrenching himself well before hand in his passive Condition, to digest his
Scruples, and to prevent his consenting to the sweet impressions of Objects.
But youth is not sufficiently hardened to those interior Combats, to be led
after such a manner into the Fire: We know it has a far greater inclination to
Vice then of Virtue: It needs no encouragement to idolize Pleasure; rather,
unless it be of an extraordinary Temper, what should incite him to despise it?
The reason of a young Man is not ripe enough for Truth; Age and Experience are
absolutely necessary to convince him of those noble and great resemblances and
agreements wherein this Truth consists: But has the Sense of a young Man
sufficient Vigor to resist the Allurements of Voluptuousness? Now then to
expose before a young Prince the view of Pleasure almost stark naked, under
pretense that it unfolds the Truths of Salvation and Morality, what is this but
to enervate his Mind by flattering his Passions? rather is it not as if a
Physician should give Poison to a feeble Stomach, to procure the digestion of
strong Food? Is not this to corrupt at the same time that he pretends to
instruct? This is but a bad sort of Pedagogie; however it is Telemachus all
over. Mentor speaks the noblest things in the World, I must confess it; but the
Author with his Romantic Chain of yolle Stories, destroys the virtue of the
Exhortations, like an old Dotard as he is. Mentor preaches up one Holy God,
Almighty, Immense, Incomprehensible, and Adorable; the Author teaches a company
of vicious Deities, bounded in their Power; Vagabonds, familiar, ignorant and
passionate. Mentor corroborates the heart against Sloth and Female tenderness;
the Author does all he can to render it Effeminate. Mentor makes Happiness to
consist in Virtue; the Author makes it always unfortunate, and introduces the
wicked always happy till Death. Mentor would have a King to be just, and that
he should Sacrifice himself for the welfare of his People; the Authors Hero's
are two Princes, one of which abandons his Subjects to revenge the Quarrel of a
Mistress; the other Scaperloiters about the World like a Coxcomb, leaving his
Mother and his Country a Prey to a company of Rivals. The parallel would make
you stare, should I carry it as far as I could stretch it. Stay but till I
examine the Tomes apart, and you shall have more pleasant Encounters to make you
merry. In the mean time I beseech ye allow me one thing; That this Piece being
an Ambiguous Contexture of Piety and Superstition, of Error and Truth of Figure
and Natural, of Vice and Virtue, of good and bad Sense, it favors the
Inclination of a young Prince to Evil, and is only fit to perplex and confound
his Ideas of Good. But here you will object and cry, this is all but slashing
the Air. He that proves too much proves nothing: According to your Conclusions,
Youth must be excluded from reading the Poets, and all manner of Fictions, and
then the Lord have Mercy upon ye; for all the Regents of Colleges, and
Masters of Schools, would fall about your Ears, and those Pedantick People are
a terrible sort of Enemies, who are always in Arms, and their Lashes will fetch
Blood through a Quire of Brown Paper. Well, Sir, let 'em be as terrible as they
please, their Menaces are not able to terrify me. Thanks to my evil Destiny, I
fear neither Eagles nor Crows. But you mistake the sense of my Sentiments, and
therefore for your better information, let us argue a little after the
venerable manner of the Schools. I offer ye this Proposition. A prudent Tutor
ought not, on purpose to compose a Romance interwoven with Sacred and Profane,
to form the Mind and Heart of a young Prince: From whence you conclude, that
all Poetry is pernicious to young People. But this is no good Logic; for you
argue from a Particular to a General. Though I had Learning, and Credit
sufficient to banish out of Colleges the Illusion and Bombastical Style of
Poetry, I would not desire to merit the Name of a Reformer in the Republic of
Learning: That Honor would be due to a Person who for Erudition and Delicacy,
is none of the meanest Ornaments of the Age: You know who I mean. But I pretend
not to go too far. I agree with whosoever pleases to agree with me, that good
Poetry may be profitable to Youth in many things; It is an Art that requires
Application, and procures to the Wit a Felicity to unfold and penetrate many
Difficulties. Salt and Poynancy, which are as it were the Soul of that
ingenious Amusement, afford Matter for that which is called Brilliant. Neither
are Fictions barren Images; they serve to render the Wit inventive, and
Invention is the Mother of public Benefit. But what is all this to my Thesis?
Is it less certain, that Poetry and Romances are two Rocks against which good
Sense and Virtue split themselves a thousand times, and suffer Shipwreck? For
which reason it is, that prudent Masters will never let their Disciples be out
of their sight when they give 'em leave to ramble that slippery Tract, so steep
and full of Precipices. Have a care they cry, this Idea is false, that Conceit
is poor and flashy, that piece of Morality is corrupt, that Example is to be
abominated. We only pass these Phantoms slightly before your Eyes, because it is
fit you should know every thing, and because there is a necessity of submitting
to the Tyranny of Custom. What would you think, Sir, after all this of a grave
and devout Preceptor who should bethink himself of rammassing all these Follies
together, and incorporating 'em into one Romance, with an intention to
infuse-into a young Prince his Pupil, a solid Piety, Justice incorruptible, a
Patience proof against all Trial, a Courage unsurmountable, a right Sense, and
an exact Discernment; in a Word, all the Qualities that might render a King
worthy his Distinction. A goodly Catechism you will say, and presently reply,
such a Guide would lay the Snare, dig the Ditch, and make the Bait himself.
Nevertheless, this is Telemachus's design, if the public have done him
Justice. It may be you will be skirmishing with your Objections against me, and
tell me that it is lawful for a Tutor to make use of his own Romances, as well
as of those which are composs'd by theirs, and that provided he order his
Disciples to read 'em with necessary precautions, nothing hinders but that his
Wit may prove an Honor to him. But what you get by this you may put in your
Eye. For a Tutor is made choice of to meet the mischief, not to give occasions
for the growth of it. It Is his duty to weed away whatever may prove destructive
to his young Plant, and not to set any thing near it, that may feed it with ill
juice. This Tutor is the young Princes Spiritual Physician, it is his Duty to
let him know which are good, which are bad Nourishments; but if the Physician
should himself prepare dangerous Food for his Patient, in hopes to have the
Honor of preventing the ill Consequences of it, think you that would be well
done? I am sure, you do not belive that such a man could act with a safe
Conscience; nor would you, if once it came to be known, discharge him upon a
bare Repentance. Let us drive the Nail as far as it will go. Telemachus is a
Composition of Fiction and Truth, of Vices and Virtues, of Good and Evil: The
Tutor who is a Man Able, Eloquent, Persuasive and a profound Mystic every Inch
of him, employs all the strength of his great Genius to hinder the young Prince
from mistaking his course between these two opposites. He makes him understand
the Ridiculousness of Ficton, the deformity of Evil, the beauty of Virtue, and
the reputation that attends Men of worth: But who has told this Aristotle that
his Alexander will believe him upon his Word? If the young Prince be of a
temper to be carried away with Hyperboles and Figures; If he be of a merciful
Humor, not to let a fair Goddess dye for Love; If Cupid subdue him under the
Empire of Venus; If he takes a liking to the Religion of the Inhabitants of
Craete; If the dispoticism and avarice of Pygmalion do not offend him; And
lastly, If instead of taking out all the Honey of the Romance, he sucks out all
the Venom, There Is a young Prince quite spoiled: and when he comes to be King,
his Subjects must be miserable; and all this will be charged to our Tutors
account. Would you believe it, Sir, that this famous Telemachus, upon whom all
People bestow their Panegyricks, and strew Flowers, that I may speak like a
Poet, by whole Baskets full, should one day prove the cause of most dismal
effects, and consequently become the Object of public Malediction? I know that
I combat with a Fly, and that the Misfortune will never happen: It may be
Telemachus will be better advised then to turn Pedagogue: But though he should
have aimed at the Education of a Prince so well known to us, there would have
been no danger. That Prince is too well born to turn to his ruin what was only
composs'd for his preservation: But in short the thing is not impossible; and
that is sufficient for me to condemn the design which is ascribed to the Work.
In a Word, Sir, Why should he not follow the beaten Road? Why should not every
Flower be gathered from its own Bed? The true Method of instructing Youth is
rightly to teach the distinction of Ideas, by never confounding Matters. Every
Instruction ought to be derived from its own Spring: Let Religion be drawn from
the sacred Scriptures; Mythology from Fables; The knowledge of Nature from
Philosophy; Actions from History; And Morality from the World, which is the
great Volume. Upon these different Subjects let 'em a Gods name, make as many
and as long Commentaries as they shall judge convenient; but let it be done
without anticipating one matter by another. For if you once confound 'em, you
make a Gallimawfrey that distracts the Understanding of the Disciple; and while
you go about to teach him all at a time, he learns nothing as he ought to do.
From whence there is so much the more reason why great, Capital, and Essential
Truths should never be inserted in Romances. In good earnest, this is to
enchase precious Stones in pitiful gilded Clay: Those false Adventures are
recounted with an Air of sincerity, exact Circumstances, and all the
appearances of Truth. Which way now to prevent a Youth from being deceived? If
he believes 'em, he is in a fair way to mistake Error for Truth. Is he then
capable of those sublime Speculations and of those noble Maxims which they
endeavor to infuse into him? If he be apprehensive of the Fiction, he stands
upon his guard against surprise. He reads those things which are least subject
to contradiction, as those things which are most remote from good Sense. So
that in a well continued Romance, and Pieces well knit together, such as is
Telemachus, Falsehood becomes an obstacle to Truth, and Truth inclines the
Reader to believe the Falsehood. Would you know to whom I compare Mentor in the
frequent Exhortations which he gives Telemachus? Even to an Orator that never
would pronounce any other then false Panegyricks, nor ever would explain
himself but by false Texts. For example, Sir, Mentor preaches like a Doctor in
Romances: He raises some Persons to the very Skies, and throws down others to
the bottom of Hell: There is not one action that he praises but what is
invented; nor is there any one which he condemns which is not Chymerical, what
credit is there then to be given to these charming Discourses? When he
Dogmatizes like a Plato, Moralizes like a Socrates, and Discourses like a Cato,
concerning the Happiness and Liberty of the People, they are like Structures
without a Foundation: They are Consequences which being erroneous in the first
Principle, fall and themselves destroy themselves. For example, behold an
Inference of Mentors Morality. Such and such were happy or miserable, because,
they did so and so; therefore it concerns you as you value your Happiness, and
would avoid Misfortune, to do so or so. Should the Disciple answer, such and
such were neither Happy nor Miserable but in your Imagination; therefore there
is nothing real or solid in your Precepts; What shall the Master say? Well,
while he is considering of it, I tell ye what I think of the Style of this
Piece.

You guess no doubt, Sir, what I drive at; and knowing my Genious so well as
you do, it is easy for you to imagine that I am clearly out of conceit with this
sort of Poetical Prose. I do not pretend to refineness of Wit; you are in the
right on it, I admire, as another Man would do, when I am spoken to plainly and
Politely, provided they speak to me in the Language of Mankind, as three famous
Writers in your Holland very luckily do. But when Men pretend to disorder all
Nature, never to name an Object without a Figure or a Phoebus at the end of it,
my language seems so barbarous that I Am at a stand whether I shall acknowledge
it any longer or no. The Poets boast, that their Language is the Language of
the Gods. In good truth, they speak better then they are aware of; for from
this Confession we may conclude, that neither mortal Men understand them, nor
that they understand themselves. However, if they have received by infusion the
understanding of what they write, let 'em write for the Gods as much as they
please; Let 'em walk upon Stilts; Let 'em heap Fiction upon Fiction; Let 'em
descend from their high flow Jargonry; Let 'em climb up to the Clouds; Let 'em
immure themselves within the narrow limits of Measure, Number, and Cadence, we
have nothing to say to 'em. These are a sort of Birds that make use of their
Wings to fly to Parnassus: the beauty of their Plumage is as real as the
Divinity of Apollo. That's nothing to the purpose; these Birds have the
privilege to support themselves in the Air; let 'em enjoy it; there is nobody
envies 'em their Happiness; But let 'em not infect the Earth with their Visions
and their Dreams; Let 'em not intrude among us to set Mankind and good Sense
together by the Ears. It Is not just that falsehood should cloth it self in the
Vestments of Truth, for then what way will there be to distinguish the one from
the other? Prose is the natural means that Men make use of to communicate their
Ideas one to another, to open their Hearts and intermix their Souls; it is the
Vehicle of the light and warmth of Wit, as the Air is the conveyance of the
Light and heat of the Sun. Through this the Sciences are transfused; by this
the Laws are published and observed, Equity subsists, and Sincerity maintains
it self. It Is the Language of Society; nor do I know any People in the World
that express themselves, that Reason, that Instruct one another or govern in
Verse. It Is upon this Ground, as I believe, at least I do not know a better,
that among clear sighted People there is so much pains taken to polish the
Language of the Country: they pare off the mean, impure, excessive and too much
figured Expressions: The People are desirous to think nothing but what is
solid, they are willing to speak as they think, and they are in the right on it.
It may be, it is in this Sense that our Authors are so scrupulous about the
least Rhyme, and that when they write, they will stiff a thousand Words, as
proper as they are to express their thought, so soon as they have found another
that will better suit with the Cadence, though not so well with the Sense: I know
not whether you have ever examined the Reason of this niceness; but if you will
believe Monsieur Jourdain, a great Master in Philosophy, it is because all that
is Verse is not Prose, and all that is Prose is not Verse. But I know this
Gibberish will not pass in payment with you for current Money. I am then rather
willing to believe, that it proceeds from hence, that Prose being only composed
to clear the Wit, and persuade good Sense, it cannot endure any thing that
flatters the Ear, or tickles the Imagination. Upon this consideration, Sir,
does not your Heart rise against the Versify'd Prose of Telemachus? When the
Author of that Romance displays before ye, in his simple and natural Style,
yet grave and Majestic, those fabulous Beauties fit only to amaze Fools, or to
divert Children, tell me truly, do you find one once of that solidity which you
search for through the whole Piece? Rather are you not seized with a secret
Indignation that a Man should employ a Language that is admired and spoken in
almost all the Courts of Europe, in such Fopperies as those? Could it be
possible that a Prelate who reasons so profoundly upon Celestial Verities,
that neither the Pope nor the King, nor the Bishops understand him, should
consecrate his Pen to copy out in serious Prose the Chimera's of the Poets and
the most abominable Superstitions of Paganism? How was it possible for a
complete Quietist, when he was composing so profane a Piece, to preserve a
sight of God, acting immediately upon the Faculties of the Soul? Could the
Presence of God inspire him to paint forth a Lie, with a laborious Pencil in
the Colors of Truth? Had the Author wrote in Verse, he could not have been
altogether excusable, but there might have been less Cause to blame him. It Is
true, that he could never have escaped the Reproach of having misspent his
leisure Hours, in having dishonored his Profession; and having interrupted
mystical Contemplation by vain Amusements. But in short the Reader, having
perceived the Style of the Fiction could have been in no danger of a Surprise;
'twould have been taken for a Sport of Wit and Devotion incompatible with
innocent Diversion. But to counterfeit an idolatrous Historian, to compose a
Romance, representing Truth under the Fabulous Action of Persons exclaimed
against in Pulpits, and exploded in private Confessions, truly the Operation
was not mystical, neither does it savor at all of the Interior Man. Stop a
little, say you, you run too fast -- What! do you rank Telemachus among the
Cassandra's, Claelia's, Cyrus's and Astrea's? Yes, without Question: -- Where
would you have had me placed him better? I must confess that Wedlock is not the
thing that is aimed at there: But it is not for that Reason your devout People
have thundered down these sort of Books. If Romance be a Serpent, the Venom
lies not in the Tail, it always ends in Conjugal Union: -- Nothing is more
Civil nor more Natural. Where lies the Poison then? -- Is it not in the
Intrigues, and tender Movements, the amorous Impatiences -- and Copulations
obtained with so much Mystery -- carried on with so much Secrecy, performed
with so much Passion, and, in a Word, in the Management of their Amor? How
could an Amorous Commerce be described after a more sensible Manner, then it is
done in Telemachus? What is there wanting to delight a Reader, who has a tender
Heart? The Declarations, the Rendezvouzes, the Ejaculations of Impatience usual
in other Romances, are they not to be found there. It Is true, there is no
revealing there of secret Favors. But as you very well know, Romantic Lovers
are much more discreet then Common Lovers; for their Authors will not let them
commit an Error. They are not like the French who never think 'emselves fully
happy, unless they publish their good Fortune to all the World; besides that
Telemachus might steal something from his dear Nymph, and never let Men know of
it. No, Sir, call me Obstinate and Incredulous as long as you please, I will
never agree to the Sentiments of the Public. The Public, notwithstanding all
the Respect that I owe it, is a Backbiter. It Is not possible, that a Mystic
should be such an Artist in making Love, though it was a pure Amor, intended
only to lawful Enjoyment. There is too great an Opposition between Sacred and
Profane Love. Sacred Love is without Interest, and without return of Reward.
on the other side, Profane Love is not satisfied with the Pleasure of Loving;
his Generosity is interested, there must be a Reciprocal Return of Body and
Soul. What likelihood then, that a Prelate, swallowed up in the Disinterestment
of Divine Love, should understand so well the petty Traffic of Lovers? A
Quietist lives at Rest without Action; bur two Hearts that love each other are
always in Motion. No, believe me, it is not the great Archbishop, who is the
Author of Telemachus; and could I write with so much ease, as I have Veneration
for his Merit, I would stoutly undertake his Defense and write his Apology,
though I ran the hazard of having the Lie given me by all that knew the
contrary. But to return to my Text, for I perceive that I swerved a little too
far from it; it is yet more contrary to good Sense, that such a sublime,
judicious Wit, so exact and wonderful in his Relish, should bethink himself in
our Age to continue the Rhapsodie of Homer, and gives us in Prose a true
Ogliopodrido of Poetry. Pardon me the Expressions; for here it is that I find
my Wrath a little inflamed; insomuch that I could wish my self Proctor General
of the Nation, that I might have the Liberty to prosecute the Author. I would
summon him to appear before the Tribunal of Good Sense, that he might be fairly
and duly condemned to stand in a white Sheet, with a Torch in his Hand, for the
Honor of the French, with a Prohibition never to relapse, and put his
Countrymen under the Temptation of changing Wit like the the Fashions, and to
quit a good Taste for a bad Relish: What, do you laugh? You talk at your ease with
your Dutch Phlegm. But it is in good earnest that I am angry at this Minute, and
without any other Form of Process, I condemn Telemachus that is in my Study, to
be burnt by all the common Hangmen of France. How! Telemachus that was composed
for the Education of the Duke of Burgundy! You mistake sure: The Author had
another Design in his Head. As he has a great deal of Wit he had a mind to
sport with the Inconstancy of France, and to divertise himself alone behind the
Curtain. Do not you call my Conjecture a Vision; I ground it upon the Success
of the Work, and if the Author had built upon that Platform, he would have had
all the Reason in the World to have been sa, tisfi'd with his Design. It Is in
Matter of Wit the French strive to excel other Nations, in judging soundly of
another Man's Works. They flatter themselves that they enjoy by a certain
Privilege that happy Penetration which makes them distinguish Solidity from
false Luster. Never till now did they push on so far this pretended Delicacy of
theirs. I know not whether it be with you in your Boggs as it is here. But it is
a Pleasure at Paris to see the Booksellers Shops full of a Number of Censurers;
who decide the Fate of Books like Oracles, and tell ye with an erected Eyebrow,
this creeps, that clambers. We are come off from these Simplicities; why should
the Press be sullied with such nasty Sotticisms. Men are become altogether Men:
they are no longer pleased with any thing but what is Natural and Judicious; we
desire something that may instruct us, not amuse us. Yet would you think it,
Sir? these rigorous Judges are the greatest Adorers of Telemachus. Those lofty
Wits take a singular Delight to see the Sun come forth from the Bosom of his
Amorous Theirs, bound from the Arms of his Mistress to get into his Coach, at
his leisure make his Tour about the World drawn by his Free-breathing Streeds.
Aurora appears charming to them in her Dewie Waine. -- Dewie Wain! Mark that:
Dew is nothing but drops of Water that fall from the Sky. Nevertheless those
Drops make a Wagon -- How Natural that is? Venus goes to kiss her Darling
Papa, and conjures him with Tears in her Eyes, that he will be pleased that
Telemachus may suffer himself to be debauched. The good Papa is mollifi'd; and
but for cruel Destiny that gives him Laws, he would consent that Telemachus
should become the greatest Whore-master under the Sky. These are but faint
Sketches of the Beauties of Telemachus. If our Correspondence continues, you
shall see a great many more. How is it possible to cry down such a Piece of
Juicie and Florid Prose! after this, talk no more of our French Men: It belongs
only to them to aspire to the Universal Monarchy of Wit. This brings a Fancy
into my Head. The Enemies of our incomparable Prince, have given out a long
time that he was projecting the Conquest of all Europe. The Calumny was too
palpable. The King's Justice and Moderation is too well known, and his Majesty
has given illustrious Proofs of in, in stopping several times the Rapid Course
of his Victorious Arms, and giving Peace to Europe: The Truth is this, that if
Lewis the Great did not seek to be Master of Europe, he was very near being so,
till Heaven, whose Designs are profound, and who carries them on by ways
unknown, raised as it were out of Nothing, another Prince that was capable of
humbling a haughty Potentate, and disappointing the vastest of his Designs.
There has something of this Nature befallen our Nation, prepossessed with her
own Merit, through the Success with which they have cultivated the Liberal Arts
and Sciences and all manner of Learning. She set up for an Arbitratrix of good
Relish, arrogating to her self a Prerogative to decide as a Sovereign, the
Works of Wit, and pretending that nothing ought to pass for good Sense, but
what was sealed with her Approbation. But an unknown Person comes and throws
himself in the way, and not being able to endure so much Pride, it comes into
his Head to bring her a Pegg lower. What does he do? Like an honest Plagiarie,
He Pillages the Poets; he pilfers a Dream from one, a wild piece of Dotage from
another, to give a kind of Solidity to these hollow Imaginations; he dresses up
a Fable Alamode; and let us it run about the Streets; presently behold all the
French Men at the heels of it: It Is in vain to cry, Stop: This Prose is a
Curtisan in disguise; her Dress has no resemblance with what she is. It Is the
same that you chased and exploded with so much ignominy forty Years ago. No
matter for that, she talks better then she did at that time; and her Language
infinitely pleases us. But she still repeats the same fooleries: Let it be so;
she plays the fool wittily; that is what we would have. Oh the excellent Genius
of the French Nation! Have we not reason to reproach her for being fond of her
Language, when she prefers it before Truth and good Sense? What reason has she
to laugh at the Swisses? They, good People, pay themselves with words, and
provided the Cadence pleases, never trouble themselves about the figuification.
Our Admirers of Telemachus, do they not do the same thing? Let us talk with a
little more Equity. A Swiss never conttadicts himself; he knows what he loves,
and seeks it after his own manner. But the French who cry out every where for
Substance, good Nourishment, good Juice, serve their Tables with painted
Messes, and devour 'em. I excuse this Transport in your Refugees: Not but that
I believe 'em to be People of Wit, but their Souls are not in their natural
situation. Living as they do without Callings, without Estates, they stand in
need of Amusement, and besides that, since the time that you separated from us,
we may look upon ye as half Strangers. But that in Paris, the source of
Illumination, the Country of Understanding, the Center of good Relish, they
should be so hungry after Telemachus, that they should throw their Louidores at
the Heads of the Booksellers, to carry away that Romance as a piece of value; I
cannot in that respect acknowledge my self for a Frenchman, and I Am afraid,
that the Age of our August begins to decline in point of Judgment, which would
be but a bad Prognostication of the Continuance of the Monarchy. You will not
fail to ask me here whither Mentor spoke Greek for me, and whither I could
comprehend nothing of the Divine Lessons, which that wandering Goddess gives at
every end of the Field to her Favorite Telemachus? Yes, Sir, I understand 'em
all very well, but I know not whither it procceded from the dullness of my Wit,
or the hardness of my Heart, I was not at all moved with 'em. Mentor, who is
Wisdom it self, teaches his Disciple to subject the Animal part of his Soul to
the Spiritual part; to make himself Master of his Passions, to prefer
Conscience and Integrity before all things. What do you find so wonderful in
all this? A petty Schoolmaster does it as well: Was this worth the trouble of
prostituting the Divinity of Minerva, and making a Gadding Huswife of her, to
tell him the simplest and most common things in the World? The Author might
have let alone that Daughter of Jupiter to enjoy the Advantages of her Birth in
quiet, and have taken the first that came of the Clarks in his Diocese; I speak
only by way of supposition. I am sure that with a little good Sense, and
easiness to express himself, he might have said as much as the Divine
Pedagogue. Wherein consists the Excellency of that Morality which enchants the
World so much? In continually repeating the same Precepts? I assure ye, that
Mentor had great need of being a God, to succeed in his Persuasions: His
Doctoral Style could not be thinner, He neither proves, nor demonstrates the
Effect by the Cause, nor the Cause by the Effect. All his Philosophy is reduced
to this small Inference: They did this, and were commended, therefore you ought
to do so too. They did this and were blamed, therefore you ought to have a care
how you follow their Example. Must a Man be cleft out of Jupiter's Skull to say
this? It Is true indeed, that the fluency of the Words supplies the force of the
Reasoning. If it be true then, that a Judicious Reader be no Friend to a
Concise Style, then indeed I am too blame, to wonder that Telemachus is so much
admired; for instead of including much Sense in few words, it is much more when
a pompous display of words furnishes us with a relish of good Sense. The
Mischif is, that the same Expressions as frequently return as the same Things.
Never was Man so wealthy in Synonimous Terms; so that I would willingly adopt
in his favor the Eulogy, which an Enemy of the Accademy formerly gave to a
Member of that Illustrious Body. It Is said he, the best dough of Man in the
World, he has a number of words which boults and sifts over and over again,
with a wonderful Dexterity. But it is now high time that I should have a fling
at Telemachus for his Mysterious part; and I agree with you, that this is the
Part which makes his Reputation soar so high.

My business, Sir, is here to penetrate the Intention of our Author. By all the
Rules of Probity, my Criticism ought not to go so far; it is forbid me to grope
another Man's Heart; it is a secret part, reserved only for God, a Confessor,
and a Confident. Though Mentor with his Political Exhortations should visit all
the Courts of Europe, that gives me no Prerogative to accuse him of having a
design upon any one. Suppose the King should send to ask a great suspected A.
Bishop, whether he had any design in Telemachu to censure the Governmen; there
is no question, but that laying his hand upon his Conscience, and lifting up
his Eyes to Heaven, he would reply, God forbid: and we ought to believe him
upon his word. For Holy Men, and especially Mystical Holy Men, will never tell
a Lie; so that had I nothing else to say to ye but that, the Mystery will be at
the bottom. But because Men are wicked enough to envenom the Intentions of the
most upright. and for that the Public has been so unjust, as to report to our
Court the vehement Declamations of Mentor against the Tyranny of bad Princes, I
will leave the Author to his own Conscience, and endeavor to root this
malignity out of your mind. It Is very great; and I must frankly acknowledge,
that were they English or Polanders that were to interpret the Intention and
discourse of Mentor, I should have nothing to object. Those Idolaters of
Liberty look upon us with an Eye of Scorn and Disdain, and are straight upon
our Bones if we give Slavery the least good word. As for your Genlemen
Resugees, there is nothing else to be expected from them; exasperated as they
are against the King, it cannot be, but that the shadow of a Censute made by a
devout A. Bishop must tickle their Hearts. You look upon your selves as Martyrs
for the Cause of God and the Laws: And indeed if Patience, Charity, Humility,
Piety and good Living were eminent among your People, your Faith would make the
Conscience of the most zealous Catholic tremble: But in short, you believe
your selves the Victims of an unjust Oppression; it is no wonder then, you
should be so highly pleased with whatever decrys the Conduct of your
Persecutor; in a word, I pardon you your Commentaries and your Exultations over
Telemachus: The least favor that can be granted to Innocent Unfortunates; much
less will I quarrel with your Brethren that languish in the midst of us; their
misfortune is still greater then yours.

But I have a secret Grudge against a Crowd of People, who boasting to bear the
glorious Titles of Catholic and French Men, profane both the one and the
other, by seeking in Telemachus the Censure of our Admirable Government: For I
ought not to conceal our Shame: it is certain, that Telemachus has run through
France, with as much or more Applause as in Holland: and that which vexes me
most is that they write me word from several Courts, that the Ambassadors make
this Book their Favorite Companion; so that if what you send me word be true,
that the worthy Minister that we have among you gave order that the Bookseller
should be well schooled, I shall have a greater Esteem for him then ever I had,
and hope to thank him in the Name of all good French Men, so soon as he shall
return. But don't you see, Sir, by this the Character of our Nation, without a
Prospective Glass; When the French Men do not love their King, they are
insolent; when they obey a Prince whom they adore, even to dotage, they are
overjoyed when he is reviled and rayl'd at. But let us see whether there be any
ground for the imagining that Mentor has done it in Telemaehus. For my own
part, who am a little Scrupulous and who should be very much troubled to think
ill of my Neighbor, I had rather believe that the Author of the Romance,
filled as he is, with veneration of our incomparable Monarch, has fetched a
compass about to draw his Portraiture, and being unwilling to resemble those
flattering Historians, who blind the Eyes of Princes with their Incense and
their Smoke, he makes Minerva speak in general. To be short, in all that Mentor
unfolds to us of the Vettue, Glory and Merit of good Princes, is there any
thing which does not presently cause us to think of Lewis XIV.? In the hideous,
and extravagant Pictures that Minerva gives us of Tyrants, can we refrain our
Joy when we consider, that we have a Prince who is not so wicked as they? But
you will not be fatisfi'd with an Idea so general. I know your Exactness; you
must have a particular Account; go too then: The first and greatest Quality
that Mentor seeks in a good Prince is, that he should live only for the sake of
his Subjects. Does not the King do so? It Is only out of a desire to reign over
his Subjects, that he desires to live, and he will Reign to the last gasp of
his Breath, or else he would not be Master. Mentor would have it, that the
Prince should be the Father of his Country, and love his Subjects with as much
tenderness as his own Children. Well, Sir, d' ye not see his Majesty to the
Life in all this? People judge of the Tenderness of a Father by his
extraordinary zeal, to seek the good of his Children: Now I defy you and all
your Historians to find me out, since the foundation of Royalty, a Prince that
has longer and more successfully applied himself, as well in Person as by his
Ministers, to seek the welfare of his Subjects; I mean their Spiritual and
Temporal Welfare: and to prove it to ye, for with a Hugonot, we must be sure to
have good proofs for what we say; do not you conceive; Sir, that the true
welfare of the People consists in Plenty? Riches perhaps are a more dangerous
Enemy; they are only fit to enfeeble natural Vigor, to feed Passion and hasten
Death. The chief Happiness of Life is to be Master of his own Hearth, to eat
his Bread in Peace under the protection of Justice: Now are not we beholding to
the Kings Bounty for this inestimable Blessing? When he ascended the Throne, he
found Subjects that knew not how to make use of Fortunes Favors: Money was in
their hands, like a Knife in the Hand of a Madman. Troubles, Disorders,
Rebellion was all the Talk of that Time: The Nobleman oppressed the Peasant;
the Great men made the Little Ones turn about with the wind of their Pride and
Capriccio; the Stronger gave Laws to the Weaker; From whence Duels, Murders,
Robberies, Injustice and Violence multiplied; the People swelled up with their
own fat, no longer acknowledged any Master; or to speak more properly, they
groaned under the Yoke of an infinite number of petty Tyrants, and forgot their
Respect to their lawful Sovereign. The Princes, Governors, Parliaments, the
Men in Credit, all these were like so many Flambeaux, that kindled and fed the
Fire of Revolt, under the specious pretense of maintaining the Law, and the
preservation of Liberty: Good Pleasure, full Power and Sovereign Authority,
depended upon all these Heads; and when Abuses were to be reformed, or Money
was to be raised to supply the Public Necessities, the Royal Majesty was
exposed to Affront or Refusal. Our Prudent Father of his Country has plucked
up all these Mischiefs by the Roots, as a prudent Head of a Family ought to do:
he has made himself Master of the whole. By that means his Kingdom is like a
House well regulated, where the Father disposing of the whole Estate, retains
every body in Order, in Subjection and in their Duty. Do we see any
discontented Prince under Lewis the Great, betake himself to Arms to do himself
Justice? Do we see Governors draw whole Provinces after 'em, contrary to the
Interest of the Sovereign? Do we behold Seditious Libels presented in an
Assembly by the People's Deputies? Do we hear of any sharp and Stinging
Remonstrances from a Parliament? So far from it, that the Ambition of Princes
is calmed, the Governors are submissive, the Parliaments set open their
Registers, the People have no more to do but to open their Purses; absolute
Power spreads its Influences every where, and every body libes in peace under
his own Fig Tree. This Sir, is that; which among the Heroes is called seeking
the Temporal good of the People. You Dutchmen with your shadow of Liberty, have
no mind to agree to this. You look upon all us as Slaves and Beggars. It Is true
our People are not so fat as yours, nor our Country Peasants so rich: But if
Murders and insurrections should happen among you, is it not true, that you
would wish to be in our places. Besides, you are not to imagine that our Prince
heaps up abundance and draws it to himself, to make a benefit of it, but to be
a good Steward and a just Dispenser of it. Do you not see that he labors still
under the same Necessities, that his Edicts observe their Course, and that though
he be actually at peace, he is constrained to augment the Taxes? What does he
do, say you, with those prodigious Numbers of Millions that go every Year into
his Coffers? He generously divides a Part to those who have the Honor to serve
him, and principally to those notable Head-pieces that manage the Finances: He
maintains sormidable Armies that make him the Arbiter of the Laws, and the
Terror of his Neighbors: He enlarges his Palaces, and makes Embellishments
there, that surpass even wonder it self: He reforms Nature, by levelling Hills
and digging new Rivers. Has he not need of Immense Sums for those incomparable
Beauties, who had Charms sufficient to engage his Heart, and often refreshed him,
wearied with the Toils of Government? How many Cities purchased? How many Spies
maintained abroad? I say nothing of his famous Trafficking at Constantinople;
which if it were not the most famous of all, was yet the most beneficial to
France. There is no need for me to inform ye at this time how our great King
has sought, and still seeks the Spiritual Welfare of his Subjects; you that are
an Obstinate Heretic know it too well: but the hardness of your Heart will not
permit you to reap the Benefit of it; and this Pious Monarch stays but till the
day of Judgment to reproach you with it. Mentor would have a King be just; ours
is so.

He has made Restitution in earnest, and restored to every one the best part of
what belonged to him. Just, do you say, to his People? Yes, juster then to his
Enemies? The same is Lewis the Grand: If we understand by Justice that which is
rendered in Tribunals; never Prince was so exactly careful in his
Administration. He has turned out, and turned in all Officers of all sorts and
sifted their Employments. He has created new ones in Superior and Inferior
Jurisdictions; and if the Judges are the Eyes of a Prince, as some will have
it, it may be said without Flattery, that Lewis the XIV. is the most
quick-sighted among Monarchs. If we mean Justice that a King ought to render
himself to his Subjects, it is that which our Prince never failed of. The French
love Money, and when they have it can never live at quiet; they love Honor,
and feed 'emselves with it. What has our Prince done? He has taken away their
Money, and given 'em Quiet and Honor in Exchange. Is not the one better then
the other? The French love their Trade; but as a good Catholic People, they
love their Religion better. The King has spoiled Trade, but he has exterminated
Hugnenotism, have the People any reason to complain? You shall hear a French
Peasant, that can hardly pay his Taxes, chatting after his Rustical Manner,
over a Pint of Wine of the King's Conquests and Victories; and then is he in
his Kingdom. I hold an even Wager, he would not change his Condition with one
of the Burgo-Masters. Had you seen, in the time of the War our Beggars dancing
about a Bonfire, you would agree with me, that Poverty becomes a French Man,
and that it is but Justice to reduce him to that Condition. But lastly, one
convining Proof of the King's great Justice is, that the People never complain.
You who so regularly read the Gazette, have you ever observed that the People
cry out for Bread, or that they murmured at the scarcity of Money, or pasted up
Pasquils, injurious to the Court? It Is true, the Gazetters and News Papers
mention some such thing sometimes; but as we are not obliged to keep Faith with
Hugnenots, so there is as little reason to credit 'em. Mentor declaims against
unjust War; Is there any such? The Right of War is authorized by the Possession
of all Ages. Alexander is not quoted in History for a Robber, nor the Romans
for Usurpers; were it so, the Pulpits would not ring so often as they do with
their Names; and the Preachers would have a care how they suly'd their Sacred
Eloquence, by extolling every Day thd Noble Actions of those famous Conquerors.
The King made use of this Right as another would have done. His Majesty has
extended his Frontiers, he has conquered Cities and Provinces, and acting with
more sincerity then those ancient Lords of the World, who took all and restored
nothing, the King has restored more then he took, and has kept nothing but what
he could not restore. But who told these Interpreters of Telemachus that our
King ever undertook an unjust war. Let 'em consult all the Declarations of War
that have been published since the King's Marriage; I am sure they will not
find one that does not contain a great deal of Reason. That concerning bad
Satisfaction which one of our illustrious Deserters explained among you with
his usual Delicacy, is may be the weakest of all. But they who penetrate the
Reasons of that bad Satisfaction, agree that the Complaint was not altogether
ill grounded.

You see then that Telemachus is not more happy in his Mysterious Part, then in
his Designs and his Style. But to give something to the Public; I suppose with
them, that Mentor's Politics are the Reverse of the Government, and that it is
that which has caused the disgrace of the A. Bishop of Cambray. Do you not
believe with my self, that Mentor's King is a Fantastic King, and that if
Princes would reign according to the Memoirs of that old Dr. Minerva must have
descended to the Earth to overturn the World. If a King should observe all
those divine Precepts, he would become a Victim to his People, and his
Condition would be worse then that of a private Person; I wish all Nations one
of Mentor's Prince: but where will you find him: Mentor would have a King
without Infirmities and Passions: Is this possible; King's being Masters, and
always Flesh and Blood, it is impossible but that they should be subject to
notorious Vices. An ambitious King ruins his People by War. A voluptuous
Prince can give no good Example. A covetous King will suck the Blood of his
Subjects. A Heart of Iron will never be moved to Compassion. A proud and
despotick Prince will domineer over all Mankind. A Prince prejudicated with a
false Zeal will persecute to death; and so of other Defects. It Is for the
People to lay down their Necks, and bear the Burden. These, Sir, are the
General Remarks which I have made in Reading your Telemachus. You will hence
conclude, that there is no great Matter in the Piece, or that I am but a Novice
in these Matters. However, I shall comfort my self with a full Persuasion, that
I have said nothing but what is true, and with the delight which I shall take
in having obeyed your Orders. If you think fit, burn this little Epistle, and
take a special Care that no Refugee may see it. Those Gentlemen never love the
Apologists of our Court; and as I have a great Esteem for their Perseverance, I
should be very much troubled to incur their Displeasure. Farewell, Sir, you know
I am yours, ad Aras and Focos. The rest by the Porter. -- Paris, etc.

FINIS.
