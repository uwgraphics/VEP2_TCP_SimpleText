LONDON. Printed in the Year, 1649.

A DECLARATION Published by the Right Honorable, JAMES, Earl of Darby, Ld.
Stanly, Strange of Knocking, and of the Isle of Man, etc.
PLausible beginnings are not always the forerunners of good ends; they may
promise fair, but it is the end, that either crowns all undertakings with
reputation, or brands them with shame; making a most exact discovery of the
Undertakers intentions, whether good or evil: Many honest-meaning-men, who
eight years since viewed the face of the Parliaments actions, and judged of
their integrity, by their Protestations and Declarations, entertained a very
charitable and honorable opinion, both of them and their Cause, and therein
thought not too much to hazard both their Lives and Estates with them: who are
long since sat down in the chair of repentance, having by sad experience
found, their large pretenses to prove but the shadows of weak performances,
and their greatest labors to produce no other effects, then to burden this
distracted Nation with unheard of tyranny and miserable oppression: But they
that beheld their actions, even in their primitive and best times, with a
considerate and judicious eye, did easily perceive them to pursue their own
ambitious ends, more than the welfare of this miserable Land; that they were
men, whose thoughts were filled with blood, and judged them through pretense of
Zeal to be Wolves in Sheeps clothing, and what better could be expected from
the illegal proceedings of those Men, who presumed from Servants to become
Masters, but that they should endeavor to bring in Democracy, and abolish
Monarchy; their actions being altogether such, as must needs produce strange
effects, and set open the floudgates of ruin, to overflow this Kingdom in a
moment.

For my own part I have, with my utmost power and skill, taken most perfect,
and exact notice of all their proceedings from their first beginning of
entrance into Action unto this day; and therein can find nothing but a large
comment upon that Text of Samuel, Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft. I sat
in their House of Peers more then a full year, till finding their courses to
be so strangely un-Parliamentary; I was constrained, with diverse others of the
Loyal Nobility, to forsake the House, and repair into my Country, being truly
ashamed to bear any part in their rebellious enterprises, wherein they have
proceeded with such impudent violence: that they have Plundered, and Ruined all
the Ancient Nobility, and Gentry of this Kingdom; fought many Desperate, and
Bloody Battails against their Sovereign, His Children and Subjects, imprisoned
His Sacred Person; and not only so, that but they might out-go all their
Predecessors in Rebellion, and become unprecedented therein; they clouded the
very Rays of Sacred Maj. in bringing the Royal Owner of the Throne to their
Bar of Injustice; and beyond all that, upon a Scaffold, at high noonday, in
the face of the world, as a Malefactor, before His own Court Gate in his usual
place of Recreation, after a most shameful manner by the hands of the common
Hangman, inhumanely murdered their Sovereign, un-headed the Lords Anointed;
and not contented with His Blood, in prosecution of their most deadly, and
implacable malice have since to the utmost of their power, endeavored to
stain the Candor of His Royal Name, in fixing thereon, the ignominious
brands of Tyrant, Traitor, and Murderer: styling Him in all their Prints, the
Grand, and Capital Enemy of the Kingdom; and laying their Guilt of all the
Blood that has been shed, upon His Innocent shoulders: and beyond all this,
have quite discarded, banished, and casheired all the Royal Issue; and
solemnly proclaimed our present dread Sovereign Lord King CHARLES the Second,
and His Pincely Brother the Duke of York Traitors, in the usual places, to the
amazement, and detestation of the whole world.

And whereas of late, there has been some overtures made to me, by one Henry
Ireton, who styles himself Commissary General of their Army, whom his manners
styles the Parliament of England; In whose name, and for whose service he
demands, that I deliver up this I Will of Man: And for a grateful acknowledgement
of that service he ingages on their part, that I shall have an act of
Indemnity for all that I have done, and my Lands to be restored to me without
Composition, and upon my Engagement not to oppose the proceedings of the
Parliament in their present Government, I shall peaceably, and quietly enjoy
the same. In answer to which I declare; That according to the dictate of my own
Conscience and Reason, and according unto the obligation I stood engaged unto
His Majesty, my late dread Sovereign, as well by my common Allegiance, as by my
more particular duty of personal Service, in the beginning of these unhappy
Differences, and Divisions of the Kingdom, I engaged my self on His Majesty's
Party* wherein I have constantly persever'd, either in acting, or suffering,
until this day; concurring with those of the contrary Party, only in hating
detestable Newtrality.

According to my best ability I did diligently execute all such Commissions as
I did receive from His Majesty; and did always use my utmost endeavor to
retain the people in their due obedience unto Him, as I shall ever faithfully
practice toward my present Sovereign, His Son, holding my self bound unto
Him in the same Bonds of Allegiance and Loyalty, as I was to the late King, of
ever blessed Memory, His Father; and do hereby declare, that I do, from my
very Soul abhor, all base compliance with any of His Majesty's Enemies, whether
Foreign, or Domestic: And particularly, if I could endure to be Treacherous,
I would never do it with the prevailing Party in England, whom I know to have
renounced all principles of Civility. Honor, Honesty, and Conscience; and
whose Engagements, Vows, Protestations, or Oaths, I would not take, as
security for the least attome of dust on which I tread: And I do protest in
the presence of God, and the whole world, that in balance to my Allegiance,
Honor and Conscience, I scorn their pardon in reference to any thing I have
acted, or shall act hereafter: and value my Estate no more then the most
contemptible mote that flies in the sun.

And I do hereby declare, that to the utmost of my power I shall faithfully
endeavor to hold out this Island to the advantage of His Majesty and the
annoyance of all Rebels and their Abettors; and do cheerfully invite all my
Allies, Friends, and Acquaintance, all my Tenants in the Counties of Lancaster
and Chester, or elsewhere, and all other His Majesty's faithful and loyal
Subjects to repair to this Island as their general Rendezvous and safe
harbor, where they shall receive entertainment, and such encouragement as
their several qualities and conditions shall require, where we will
unanimously employ our Forces to the utter ruin of these unmatchable and
rebellious Regicides, and the final destruction of their Interest both by Land
and Sea: Neither shall any apprehension of danger either to my Life or Estate
appall me, but I shall on all occasions (by Gods assistance) show my self
ready to express my duty and loyalty with the hazard of both; and this I shall
adventure for the future with more alacrity, forasmuch as in all my former
actings in His Majesty's service, I never did any thing with relation to the
trust reposed in me, that awakens my conscience to repentance.

From Castletowne in the Isle of Man, July the 18. 1649. DARBY.


A LETTER sent from the Right Honorable, JAMES, Earl of Darby; to Commissary
Gen: IRETON: in Answer to his Sommons of the Isle of Man.
SIR,
I Have received your Letter with indignation, and with scorn return you this
Answer, That I cannot but wonder whence you should gather any hopes, that I
should prove like you, treacherous to my Sovereign; since you cannot be
unsensible of the manifest candor of my former actings in His late Majesty's
service, from which principles of Loyalty, I am no whit departed: I scorn your
proffer, I disdain your favor, I abhor your Treason; and am so far from
delivering up this Island to your advantage, that I shall keep it, with the
utmost of my power, to your destruction: Take this for your final Answer, and
forbear any further solicitation; for if you trouble me with any more Messages
of this nature, I will burn the Paper, and hang the Messenger; this is the
immutable resolution, and shall be the undoubted practice of him, who accounts
it his chief glory to be

His Majesty's most loyal and obedient Subject, DARBY.
From Castletowne, July 12. 1649.
FINIS.
