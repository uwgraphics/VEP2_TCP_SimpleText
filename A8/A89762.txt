A NOSE-GAY FOR THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.

Made up of the stinking Flowers of their seven years labors, gathered out
of the Garden of their New Reformation.

Fierce judgments now like hemlocke springs apace,
To root out Rebels and their weedy Race;
Your Thistle, May-weed, Darnel-Ordinance
Shall now no longer have continuance.
Treason shall now expire; Justice and Law
Are taking place; will Rebels keep in aw:
Loyalty and Truth shall Reign, and chase away
All mosty Errors from our clouded day:
The King.
Sun shall with his quickening rays give birth,
Ana Queen
^una's silver-shine re-blesse the earth,
The Prince C
Morning Star shall mount the azure skies,
Till Fame does echo forth his Victories.
That D. York.
Royal Dove inarked on the Sea
Shall make you know, what it is to disobey.
Three Suns appeard at once not long ago,
Three Sons shall set a period to our woe.
As stars do shoot, so swiftly shall they fall,
That now contrive a Ruinr general.

THE DEDICATION.
TO all you zealous snufflers through the Nose,
I dedicate this Posie in Verse and Prose,
Smell out and spare not, for from thence
More savor comes, then your New Reformation.
surreverence;
Be you Presbyter or Independent,
Rebel or Traitor, it is to you I send it;
You, whose edifying Noses can smell Plots
Betwixt Langdale, and your Brethren Scots,
For which Malignant Reprobates do say,
You voted have a new Thanksgiving-day:
Praise God for this too, turn up your goggle eyes,
Then smell to your proud treasonous sacrifice;
I offer this too, for your bretherens good,
Written as your Religion is, in blood
Of Innocents whose sad and dying groans
Make the earth tremble, rends the rocks and stones,
Piercing the Heavens, does for swift vengeance call
So loud, ere long it will confound you all:
Whilst you give thanks for blood and murdering
I Will sing, the glories of a gracious King.
A Nosegay for the House of Commons.
Smell, smell I pray, sirreverence unto the lower House,
And if from it there comes a stench, pray take it in your mouth.

WAs there ever Garden in this world so soon overrun with stinking and
banefull weeds, that not long since flourished with all the choicest flowers
both for scent and color, that Flora watered with pearl drops, and Titans
warming beams gave birth unto, whose roots twined in chaste embraces, as if
they sympathized of each others virtue, that Nature her self was prided to
walk into the twined Meanders of her curious Mazes; here might you see the
Princely Rose [the King] so full of fragrancy, that for its smell and color,
it was the envy of all the world; yet guarded so with its sharp pricking
Thorns, [Militia,] that no rude hand durst touch it; there might you see the
Lilly, [Queen,] whiter then Innocence it self; a fruitful Vine bearing such
tender Clusters, as might tempt the Gods to taste; there might you see the
Olive-plants, [the Royal Progeny,] placed round about a table, where Kings and
Queens did feast, and there might kiss those fruits that their own hands had
planted: Here grew hearts ease, there precious Time, guarded with herb of
grace, and Winter-savoury, the curious Tulips, Posies, Pinkes, and Mary golds,
[Nobility and Gentry,] strived to emulate each other, and to excel it
sweetness, [Loyalty,] and with their spicy breaths to bloom each other, and
beget the blushing heats of love; here grew the Physic herbs, there those
for nourishment, that nothing wanted to add perfection to a complete Paradise,
that might reblesse the sin scorched earth, caused by our first Parents
crimes, and regaine the blessing that they lost by disobedience; so set a
period to all the thorny cares and weedy troubles that ^^mpasse weak humanity.
In the midst of this Garden stood the Tree of Life, [pure Religion,] for hungry
souls to feed on; then stood a Fountain, [Baptisme,] in whose Crystal
streams, Angels like Swans might bath their silver wings, so pure and clear,
that you might read your name at bottom, so shallow that an infant but of
eight days old might wade, and yet an Elephant might swim; next to whose banks
was planted by Heavens curious workmanship an Arbor, in the midst whereof was
a Table furnished with all delicates, Manna, [Lords Supper,] that God might
feast on, the reverend Attendants [Bishops,] wear white robes, the emblems of
true innocence, the inscription over the Arbor was, Hoe, come every one that
thirsts, buy milk and wine without money; run, run my soul one drop from
thence will quench the fire of hell, make thee for ever happy in immortallity,
and never thirst again On the other side stood an Angel holding a flaming
sword [Justice prefigured in King Charles the chief Minister thereof, and to
render justice on all offenders,] to kill all venomous and unclean creaturs
that durst approach this place of happiness. The Angel was as a God to
distinguish between good and evil, virtue and vice, the one by him cherished,
the other punished; to whose praise you might hear contending Nightingals, and
sky mounting Larks [Poets,] warbling out anthems to his earthly Diety; there
the two Tuttle-doves of peace and truth to kiss each other, prosperity and
plenty danced upon the downy frets of this blessed Albion, the people of which
thrice happy Island in their white standard of peace might give this Motto,
beati populi, a blessed people, no Island under Heaven so stored with all the
chiefest treasures of nature, being for martial achievements not only
honorable through the whole world, but famous in the production and government
of many glorious Kings and Princes, where peace did spread her silver wings,
and Christian unity from the root of unseigned love, did branch it self into
the furthest boundaries of this happy Island, that all Neighboring Nations
might participate, and taste the fruit thereof.

Now being at the height of all our happiness, surfeiting with excess of
blessings, being full of bread we kick the heel against Heaven by our pride,
which breaks out into contention, and so by evil and pestiferrous vapors
blasts all this happy Island the Garden of the world; nothing visible can be
permanent, all things are sublunary and subject to change; who would seven
years ago have thought to have seen this flourishing Kingdom embraced in the
arms of destruction; here could I break this brittle glass of nature, when I
see we are certain in nothing but uncertainties; by times mutability turned
and tossed on fortunes angry wheel, unconstant as the Sea, sometimes billowing
up, and by and by calm; or like a ship, sometimes floating, sometimes sinking,
sometimes running, then wheeling about; the Suns most glorious Body sometimes
is Eclipsed; truth may for a time be clouded over, and loyalty in a shade, but
shining forth they are more glorious made, and if these glorious creatures
suffer, pray what must treason suffer? what must paricide, Sacrilege, blood,
theft, and such foul crimes suffer? Good Parliament resolve me, you that have
by your cursed rage, ambitious to show your Omnipotency ruined all this
happiness, shut in our day of beauty, love, and peace, within the black and
dismal clouds of contention, blasted all our Roses and Lillies of happiness,
and long enjoyed amity with noisome and pestifferous showers of sanguinolent,
and bloody wars: but this as a parhenthesis.

The Keeper or chief Lord of this Garden, being of a credulous and tractable
nature, committed the care of this Garden to some servants, through whose
negligence some weeds sprang up, and a breach was made in the fence
[Monopolizers] thieves entered and stole away some flowers a Lamb or two was
missing; the Lord perceiving the negligence of his servants, and their ambition
for self ends, which had caused a murmuring in the people, which he no sooner
perceived, but he summoned together all the chief of the Land to advise with
him which way this Garden might be weeded, and how this breach might be made up
and to help him execute justice on his servants, that had betrayed their trust,
and so show himself the most willing in this great work; he began to weed
with his own royal hands, plucked up the thistles, the Mayweed, and Darnell
that choked the corn [Ship-money, and other monopolies, high Commision,
Star Chamber.] and committed the sole care and governance of this Paradise to
these unskilful Gardiners, who no sooner were by this royal authority
convented, but presently every frog began to swell into an Elephant, to lift up
their heels against their head, and to kick at that power that had given them
being, and in stead of putting their hands to help him wo^ke, lifted up their
hands against him, and forced him to fly for safeguard of his life, and instead
of making up the breach, made the breach wider, and instead of pulling up the
weeds, sowed seeds of strife and dissension, [feares and jealousies,] when
presently in rushes the Wolf, the Tygar [Anababtists and other Sectaries now
under Fairfax,] the slye and crafty Fox, [Presbyter,] and the wild Boar, who
all conspired the ruin of this most happy vineyard, rooting up the tender
Vines, and the fattest Olives, rooted up with their round snouts the rose-tree,
spoiled the curious knots and borders, made holes through the fence, [broke the
laws,] that all manner of unclean beasts entered, rooted up the Arbors, over
threw the Tables, [the Commandements] spilled the Manna, mudyed the fountain,
[old Ford saints,] and quickly made that which was a Paradise of pleasure, a
wilderness of woe, bareness, and famine: that which was the Phoenix of
Christendom [London] they made a habitation for Owls and Jackdawes; that
which was the paragon of beauty [the Church] now the pattern of deformity, and
that which was lately the Crown and pride of all Europe, now to be the
scar-crow and scorn of the world.

And this has been the seven years labors of this blessed Parliament that
will hereafter be inroled in the monuments of fame for the most Traytorous that
ever was [Treason never went without a just reward.] who instead of curing the
national maladies of this Kingdom, have added fresh fuel to their increasing
flames, disinthroned and imprisoned their Liege Lord and Sovereign, raised a
most dreadful and bloody war, laid more heavy burdens on the people then ever
Pharohs Taskmasters did on the Israelites, and finally have brought a general
ruin and destruction on the whole Kingdom: all this is real truth, so help
us God.

Now instead of a Postscript, give me leave to speak a word or two to a
stioking Kingdom, and a disconsolate City, and he that has guided my hand in
composing this Nosegay, which I know will not be favoury to the Saints; guide
your hearts and understandings to that resolution that you shall be instructed
unto by one that had he ten thousand lives would ve^^u^e them all for the
reestablishing of his Majesty, the freeing him from his abhorred imprisonment,
the procuring of a personal Treaty, obtaining of an act of Oblivion, and his
Majesty's gracious general Pardon, the Soldiers their arrears, and every man
his own, and truth and peace established in the Land, with a favorable regard
to tender consciences.

Which till this be obtained, let all true subjects keep their money from
these pr^ers over our lives and estates, endeavor to preserve and defend his
Majesty's Royal person, the power and privilege of Parliament, and the Laws
and liberties of the Subject, and by all good ways and means oppose and
endeavor to bring to exact trial, all such, as either by plots or
conspiracies have done, or shall do any thing to the prejudice of the purity
of Religion, the Laws, Liberties, and Peace of the Kingdom. And further
withal just and honorable ways endeavor to preserve union and peace betwixt
the three Kingdoms; do this and expect a blessing, otherwise assured
destruction.

The NOSEGAY.
A Little Hemp, Hemlock, wormwood, and Rue
Would make a Poesy fit for such as you,
Rebels, and Traitors, Cut-throates, men of blood,
Fitter to hang then do the Subject good;
Others by fit election, you by Fate
Are made the Executioners of State,
And not distinguished from the rank of those
Who only know you are, not whence you rose;
You countenance give to Error and, and curb in,
Bold Reprehension, make all truth a sin,
L^ve uncontrolled, and in contempt of Law
Do kill, do rob, Tyrannize, and overawe,
Yet this your comfort is the more you strive
To Ruin us, the better do we thrive,
Like Herbs, the more you bruise us, we the better sent,
Plain truth can nere be stained, but may be shent.
FINIS.
