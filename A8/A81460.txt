THE DIFFERENCE Between AN USURPER And a LAWFUL PRINCE, EXPLAINED In their
several Characters, for the satisfaction of all men.

Printed in the year, 1657.

THE CHARACTER OF AN USURPER, That has no Title at all.
AN Usurper without any Title is one that necessitates himself to be always a
Tyrant; For as a Thief after some few notorious detected Robberies, knows he
must always remain an Outlaw; so he that usurpes a power with a Faction or
part of the people to dispose of the Lives, Liberties and Fortunes of a whole
Nation at his pleasure, knows himself to be so public a Robber and exasperater
of all interests, that he is necessitated to hate the Laws that would punish
him, and by consequence those people most who are most zealous for their
preservation; That is to say, all people that have Fortunes to be preyed upon,
and all who have reputation and interest in their Country to disturb him, and
all who conscienciously adhere to former rules, contracts, protestations,
oaths and agreements, for liberty of their fortunes, persons, or Consciences.
For self-preservation will as necessarily teach him to hate, as to fear all
these, though perhaps they are too many to feel the effects of his displeasure
all at once. But to oppose all these enemies he must fortify himself with
people of as contrary tempers, principles and interests, (that is, with such as
have no reputation, fortunes, or religious principles) that they may neither
care nor fear to seize on the persons, or fortunes of any honest men; or cut
their throats for their Masters, or their own advantage, who is to raise
himself and them to greatness out of other men's ruins: and he must have so
great an Army of such impious and desperate persons to secure his ill-gotten
Power, that they are seldom to be found in any one Nation; but he must at last
be forced after the raising of one Militia (and then finding most of them
unfitting for his ends) to raise new Guards for the securing of his interest;
and in conclusion by continuance of his dis-satisfaction in the people of all
principles, and by consequence of the far greater part of the whole Nation, he
is forced at last to rely upon foreign Guards for the securing of an interest
so contrary to that of the whole Nation; and so because his Country has not
Rogues enough to surpress it, the rest of the world must be raked to find them
out. And this is so consequent a calamity, that no Usurper can avoid it, though
he would incline to moderation; for he that has once acted against the
affections, and interest of a Nation, must have a National power to defend him,
and he must maintain this power, with a heavy burden to the Nation. And all
this power is so far from securing the people where it is, that it rather
entails quarrels upon them: For there is no Tyranny like the insolent
government of a great Army, which will as much irritate the people against
them, as the necessity of a recovering their ancient rights. And though part of
the people would acquiesce under the burden of the great Taxes, that must
maintain his great power; yet still there will be a contentious and necessitous
party, that will be ready to give the Nation a purge and letting blood, to
recover it of the languishing consumption of its oppression and slavery, rather
then to expose it to those perpetual distempers, that will flow from the
endeavors of the legal excluded government, which has reason to make use of
any foreign assistance for the recovery of its own and the Nations Rights, and
will never desist though after many repulses, from renewing the quarrel, till
the Nation grows unanimous against usurpation with the bitter fruits of
distraction and oppression that so necessarily attend it. And I conceive
nothing to be more evident, then that such an Usurper can never with his safety
quit his Tyranny though he would; but must proceeed from one injury to another,
till he arrive at the highest extreme. For besides the unlimitted power that
he must exercise himself for the security and maintenance of his authority,
with his fellow Thieves and Murderers against his honest enemies, he must
transfer the same unlimited power, in every Province, into as ill hands as his
own, upon the same pretense of safrey, and they cannot choose but multiply their
injuries by the same rules that he does; for beside their charge of maintaining
their particular Power, and unsatiable avarice, and their having the same
quarrel that he has to all free minded and conscientious persons, they will
fall more particular heavy upon some out of malice, and others as they are more
eminent and popular, and by consequence where any one family is excessively
oppressed, they think they must needs be hated by all its kindred and alliance;
and so evere single injury begets a necessary offering of many more, according
to their Maxims of illegally punishing all whom they shall think they have
cause enough to suspect, and by consequence to hate and suppress; by which it
is evident that no man can escape this many-headed Monster with so sharp teeth,
but those who will make themselves subordinate beasts of prey.

THE CHARACTER Of a Lawful PRINCE, Tied to Rules by the Peoples consent.
A Well-regulated Prince established by the universal consent of the People of
one or many ages, without any ambiguity in his Title, whether it be Successive
or Elective, is a felicity best known to those who have felt the Calamity of an
Usurper; for he is established in so secure and high a prosperity, that he must
be guilty of as much folly as injustice, to hazard that eminent happiness for
any thing which he does not want, and that no necessity can oblige him to a
constant continued course of oppression is so evident, that it is more against
his interest to offer at it, then it would be of some extravagant person that
had twenty thousand pounds per annum, to spend hiss whole time in robberies,
with the perpetual hazard of his life and so great a fortune together with
infamy. And this has been so manifest in the worst of our weak and wicked
Kings in England since the Conquest, that though they have sometimes raised
forces and moneys too unjustly, yet none of them went about to establish the
first for the maintenance of their latter injustice; but when they have had
their present wills, they have (without any continuance of blood and
oppression) fallen into their old Channels again with but few examples of their
Cruelty because they had but few or no Competitors, to make them fear so much
as to be cruel, unless they would make the People so, by the folly of their
continued pressures, to the hazard of their own well established interests,
which all of them were so counseled if not so wise to avoid. And if we
consider how little charge, the avarice of profuseness of one family with half
a dozen favorites, and their dependants can be to a whole Nation; we may
conclude that it cannot be the interest of any lawful Prince, that makes a
Nation miserable, but only the necessities of him that must always maintain
thousands of as bad people as himself to seize upon the Persons and Sequester
the Estates of whomsoever their interest leads them to seem to be afraid of
for the disturbance of their ill-gotten power.

And if we consider the education of hereditary Princes, we shall find them put
into the best Masters hands that can be found, to infuse Wisdom, Learning,
Piety, and an high sense of honor into them with so great a care, that they
must be natural fools, or persons of extraordinary abilities. And Machiavil
himself teaches them to be no more wicked then needs must, and therefore his
Rules are more appliable to an Usurper then a lawful Prince, who having a great
reverence and power legally invested in him, has more interest then any other
person in the preservation of those mutual Laws between him and his people in a
regulated and mixed government: and we find in our Civil Wars of England, that
they flowed more from usurpation then any other cause, though those Usurpers
could not be so cruel who had but one or two Competitors, as he must be who
has thousands.

And to speak a little of the excellent constitution of our Laws, we find they
did almost provide for all hazards, for though the Militia were solely in a
single person, for the more ready common defense, yet the arms were in the
Countrey-mens hands by the name of Trained bands, who were not obliged to any
duty out of their own Country; that there might be almost an impossibility of
drawing a power together, to enslave the People without their consents;
especially since these Trained bands were commanded neither by Courtiers, nor
necessitous strangers, but Lord Lieutenants, and Deputy Lieutenants of their
own Country, who were men of too great fortunes and interest in their Country
to contribute to the enslaving of it, and their own posterity together.

And the Civil parts of our Government appear no less excellent then the
Military, for as the liberty of our Persons and Estates are provided for by
frequent and Free Parliaments, who only could dispose of our purses, as
appears by Magna Charta, and other excellent Laws; so lest Parliaments
themselves should usurp a perpetual and unlimited power of a many-headed and
immortal Tyranny, which they are as naturally apt to grow to as Kings; as they
are men a negative power was always thought necessary to remain in the worst
of our Kings, when the people had them at the greatest advantages, lest a
faction of subtle and ambitious ill people, should delude a Parliament with
their premeditated speeches, or by the help of force procure sudden and
destructive Votes to all our Laws and Liberties for the advancement of their
own Authority. For our Ancestors knew they had so well provided for our lives,
liberties, and properties, that it was more our own concernment to preserve our
good old Laws already established, then the making of any new ones could be to
us; and though Parliaments are the best Conservators of Liberty, yet all grant
unlimited Counsels are subject to decline into Factions and confusion, which
is he worst of Tyrannies; for we will suppose what we have formerly seen is
like to be so again; and to go no farther for an example, the late long
Parliament, before it had quite subdued the King was divided into a
Presbyterian and Independent Faction, and had not the Army proved all
Independent, we had seen those sparks of a war which were then kindled, grow to
a great flame: And were there a free and absolute Independent Parliament,
experience has taught us, that we are to expect no less animosity between the
Independents and Anabaptists, and other subdivisions of Sects, who would take
part with the weaker Faction for the pulling down of the stronger; as all those
did that sheltred themselves under the name of Independents against the
Presbyterians; and as they had formerly done against the Episcopal party. And
it must be always thus, for interest will make use of zeal to drive on
Confederacies, and if one Faction have the major part in a Vote one day, the
other will find opportunities to unvote it another day, either by a new state
of the Question, or getting earlier into the House, or by corrupting of some,
or watching the absence of others of their adversaries, till their animosities
grow from contradictory Votes, to Declarations, Proscriptions, Seisures, and at
last to blows, with the miseries that attend them. And thus we see how our
Laws, Liberties and Peace it self may be voted from us in a tumultuary have; if
there be not a negative to this absolute power, which is so much the worse, the
more avaritious interests it consists of, though it were only for the
oppression without danger of confusion; which our Ancestors knew to be so much
the worst of all evils, that they preferred the worst of hereditary Princes,
before the best new elected person, or form of Government that must be
maintained with an oppressing force and many successive Quarrels.

And now I shall desire all men to consider the obligation that every honest
man has to any particular contract with his Neighbor, and how much greater
that must be to all men of honor, Religion, or Moral honesty, which involves
all interests as certainly that implicit reciprocal contract between a People
and their lawful Governor, or Governors does, which is or ought to be
confirmed by the solemnity of mutual Oaths; since there can be no security, or
protection of all interests where subjects are not obliged to an active, as
well as a passive obedience of their Superiors. For the office of Governors
is to protect the lives, liberties, and estates of all their subjects, against
any foreign or domestic power that would usurp upon them. But if every
particular person will judge when it is fit to obey or assist his Governor,
according to the rule of his own interest, the whole government can be but a
mockery, and men can have no more security or property then beasts where the
stronger prey upon the weaker at their pleasure. And our Laws which are
grounded upon Religion and reason, do give us a clear evidence of this in case
of murder; where any man that hinders not a single murder is made an
accessory: and how much greater must the obligation be in case of Treason; that
comprehends so many murders, rapines, and miseries of all sorts, that the same
Laws do ruin the posterity of Traitors for their offenses; and with very great
reason, for they that attempt to dissolve a legally established Government by
force, though they were sure they intended a better form, are still the worst
of men: For since men's reasons are weak and various, and all forms of
government disputable in themselves, and that men do naturally oppose any thing
they are unjustly compelled to, how reasonable soever in it self, such Usurpers
can hope for nothing but to entail distractions with their many consequent
calamities upon their Country for many ages, till the memory of the security
and liberty they have lost be quite worn out of the Nation. And if the
possession of any such ill-gotten power, shall be pretended to make it lawful,
it is such an encouragement to the highest of all sorts of villainies, that no
real Christian can have the impudence to argue a thing so destructive to the
property of all good men.

And to conclude, let every man examine how positively the word of God obliges
us to obey the higher powers; and whether Saul a wicked King, and Cyrus a
heathen, were not called his anointed: Let us know that we are not to dissolve
all bonds of humane safety at our pleasure, by making our selves judges of
those whom we have consented to be our Judges, when and how we ought to obey
them, for our public defense, though God did never intend those texts for the
protection of the immediate subverters of the lawful authority they are
subject to, which all men of Conscience and honor are as much bound with their
lives and fortunes to obey out of possession, as in it: since that can less
alter a public right then any other claim. And since God who could have
planted the Christian Religion by the Sword, declined this way, it is evident
that he is called the Lord of such Hosts, as are for the defense of common
right, and the protection of innocents against their oppressors, and only such
soldiers are men of an universal charity, and the true men of honor; for all
the rest are monstrous Thieves, Murderers, betrayers of their Country, and
enemies of man kind; whosoever neglects a seasonable opposition of such
opposers and betrayers of their Countries trust, are accessaries to all its
Blood, Rapine, and Slavery.

FINIS.
