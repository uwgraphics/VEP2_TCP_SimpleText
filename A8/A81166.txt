TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader;
SO great are the Afflictions wherewith our heavenly Father has been pleased
to exercise me his poor handmaid, that I have not only lived to see my dear
husband, the stay and solace of my life, taken from me: but it has been my
hard hap also to see his Reputation, and Memory (which will be dear to all
Posterity, for the Works he has written for the common good of this Nation)
blemished, and eclipsed, by the covetous and unjust forgeries of one, who
though he calls himself Nathanael, is far from being an Israelite in whom
there is no guile; who was not content to publish a hodge-podge of indigested
Collections, and Observations of my dear husband deceased, under the Title of
Culpepper's last Legacy; but to make the deceit more taking, he steeled his
forehead so far, and braised it so hard, as not to be ashamed to forge two
Epistles, one in mine, and the other in my husbands name; of the penning of
which, he nor I never so much as dreamed: And yet he impudently affirms in my
name, that my husband Laid a severe Injunction on me to publish them for the
general good, after his decease; and that they are his last Experiences in
Physic and Chyrurgery* And in the Title of his Book, he says, They are the
choycest and most profitable Secrets, resolved never to be published till after
his death. All which expressions in the Title and Epistles, are as false as the
father of Lies; and every word in them forged and fained. And he knew well
enough that no discreet honest man, that was a friend to my husband, or me,
would ever have agreed to such infamous and dishonest practices; and therefore
I desire all Courteous Readers of the writings of my husband, to take notice of
this Deceit, and to assure themselves that it never entered into his head, to
publish such an undigested Gallimoffery, under the promising and solemn name
of his Last Legacy, and that whereby he gained his reputation in the world, as
the Imposter makes him speak in his forged Epistle. And I desire any
indifferent Reader, that has observed my husbands lofty, and Masculine manner
of expressing himself in his Prefaces, and Epistles Dedicatory, whether in
case he had been minded or disposed to take so solemn a farewell of the world,
as the Forger makes him to do; whether, I say, he would have done it in such a
whining fashion, and so in the style of a Ballade-maker, as to say, And now if
it shall please Heaven to put a period to my life, and studies, that I must bid
all things under the Sun farewell: Farewell to my dear Wife and Child, farewell
Arts and Sciences, farewell all worldly glories, adieu Readers. Certainly my
husband would have been far more serious, and material, in such a case, as any
discreet man will judge. Neither can it be thought, that in such a solemn
valediction, he could possibly forget his wonted respects to the College of
Doctors, to whom he did so frequently address himself, in diverse of his
Writings.

Courteous Readers, I shall say no more touching the abuse of the Bookseller,
only to prevent (as much as concerns me) thy being abused for the future, know,
That my husband left * seventy-nine Books of his own making, or Translating, in
my hands, and I have deposited them into the hands of his and my much Honored
Friend, Mr. Peter Cole, Bookseller, at the Printing Press, near the Royal
Exchange, (for the good of my Child) from whom thou may expect to receive in
Print, such of them as shall be thought fit to serve thee in due season without
any disguises or forgeries, unto which I do hereby give my attestation. Also my
husband left seventeen Books completely perfected, in the hands of the said Mr.
Cole, for which he paid my husband in his lifetime.

In the mean time, to save thy longing, accept herewith of one of the choycest
of his writings (as I am informed by a learned friend that has taken a view
thereof) for sublimity of matter, and style, being (it should seem) a Treatise
touching Aurum Potabile, or rare Golden Liquor, the TRVE LEGACY, which he left
me, which Aurum Potabile, is a rare Cordial, and Universal Medicine, the
perfection whereof was studied out, and attained unto by the joint endeavors
of Dr. Freeman, and my husband: And as my husband sold it in his lifetime, so
has he left it to me, of whom any that please, may have it, at the
dwelling house of my deceased husband, where I yet remain; the virtue whereof
in his own words Printed with the sixth Edition of the London Dispensatory,
are as follows.

The Virtues, Use, and Varieties of Operations of the true and Philosophical
Aurum Potabile. Now made and sold by Dr. Freeman, and by the Widow of Dr.
Culpepper, in Spittle-fields, on the East side, next door to the red LION.
IT Cures all Agues, whether Quotidian, Tertian, or Quartain; also it cured
diverse people of that most horrid putrid Fever, which so violently seized on
men's bodies (both before and after Michaelmas, 1653.) to the great admiration
of many. And when the parties diseased, have been both senseless and
speechless, so that neither that, nor any other Medicine, or Panacea, though
never so gentle, could safely be administered into the body, it has beyond all
hopes, by external application on the stomach, revived them from death. It
Cures the Gout, being fitly administrated, and the patient abstaining from the
causes. It prevents Miscarriage in women subject thereunto, and being
administered when their time is come, it causes a speedy and easy delivery.

It is an universal Remedy for all Diseases, for its chief aim is to
exhilarate the heart, and vital spirits, which supply the Microcosme, as the
Sun does the Macrocosme: It binds and stops Fluxes, and yet purges; it provokes
and stays Vomiting: It causes sweat, yet Cures praternaturall sweating, and
performs all its operations as Nature her self would have it, because it only
fortifies her in her Center, and then she is her self able to expel or
correct and amend her enemy.

To conclude, It Is an universal fortification for all Complexions, and Ages,
against all sorts and degrees of Pestilentiall and Contagious infections, both
preventing before their possession, and extirpating of them after it.

I shall say no more at present, but refer you to a Treatise that shall shortly
be published on this subject.

Jan. 1. 1653. NIC: CULPEPPER.

And this is that Treatise (Courteous Readers) which has hung long in the
birth, but never saw the light till now, and that thou may not delude thy
self with thy own imaginations, suffer me to tell thee before (...) part,
That thou may not expect (...) this following Treatise, a plain descri^tion
of my husbands Aurum Potabil^ so that all the world reading this Boo^ might
make it: No, it had been in va^^ to leave me this Medicine as a Legac^ and to
make it common to every bod^ His scope in this Sublime Treatise^ to convince
the Incredulous, from pri^ciples of Nature, That it is possib^^ to make such a
Medicine of such ra^^ and general Virtues: And witha^ To give such hints to
the learned a^^ experienced Philosopher, as mig^^ direct him in the search of
this exc^^lent Secret. In a word, If thou sh^^^ expect the Mysteries of Nature
laid ^pen after the method of Hermetic^^ Philosophers, in a more distinct
mann^^ then perhaps has ever been Printed (...) the English tongue, peruse
this follo^ing Treatise, and (as a learned friend has assured me) thou shall
receive no small satisfaction.

Neither let the Name offend any man, as if there were some deceit couched
therein, or as if we would have the world believe that it consists of nothing
but Gold, reduced to a quintessentiall Liquor; no, we are sure that it must
then be sold at a far higher rate then we now afford it. Let it suffice the
ingenious Reader to know, That it is the most precious of all Medicines (as
Gold is of Mettalls) and worth its weight in Gold, for the Excellency thereof:
And that there is in it of the substance of Gold reduced into its principles,
and made agreeable to man's constitution, by Art, therefore it is called Aurum
Potabile. Such as it is (Courteous Readers) with all its excellent virtues, if
you please to take the pains to come, or send to my house, you m^^ have of it
for your use, and there I sha^^ be ready face to face, to assure any o^^ (that
doubts) touching the truth (...) what has been asserted in this Epistl^ by
your well-wishing Friend

Ready to serve you Alice Culpepper.
From my House, next door to the Red Lion, in Spittle-fields, October 9. 1655.
Mris Alice Culpepper subscribed this Epistle, the presence of nine Witnesses,
who are ready to testify the truth thereof, if n^ require.



Mr. Culpepper's Treatise of Aurum Potabile.
The motives which first moved the ancient Philosophers to this study. LIB. I.
THe ancient Philosophers (however they have been traduced with the ^ame of
Heathens by new upstarts) ^ost certainly had the wisdom of God ^anifested to
them; they knew that God reated all things by his own Almighty ^ower, at first
in a Chaos, which after^ards he separated in a natural way, and preserves by
Nature being so sepa^ated; they knew there is nothing done in leaven, but what
is managed by the administration of Angel; nor nothi^^ brought forth, or
generated on or in (...) Earth, but it is regulated by Natur^^ they knew that
God made man an E^^tome of all his works, and had giv^^ him such a divine
spirit of knowing wh^^ the high Creator was, by the things the he had made,
according to that of Dav^^ in Psalm. 8. When I consider the heaven the work of
thy hands, the Moon and (...) Stars which thou have make; What is m^ that thou
art mindful of him, and (...) Son of man, that thou visitest him? (...) thou
have made him a little lower then (...) Angels, and have crowned him with gl^^
and honor. Thou have made him to h^^ dominion over the workds of thy han^ thou
have put all things under his feet. (...) that it was the desire of the
knowledge God, and not covetousness to be ri^^ which first set them a studying
these m^steries; for God did never reveal th^^ yet, nor never will do we are
confide^^ to any person whose conversation is (...) Earth, and not in Heaven.
This we c^^ceive to be one great reason, if not (...) only reason, why
Philosophers ha^^ written of the Philosophers stone to my^^eriously, and as it
were in riddles. We ^^ppose the eternal God suffers them to ^^rite no
otherwise, lest such divine and ^^avenly mysteries should be discovered (...)
such unworthy Wretches, who ac^^unt this World their Heaven, Mam^^on their God,
and Gain their Godli^esse. Truly we considering how myste^ously God by his
Spirit has penned ^^e scripture to the sons of men, that none ^ut his own
chose ones understand ^e mysteries of it, have ceased to que^^ion the integrity
of Philosophers in ^enning such riddles. That prophecy (...). Isa. 6. which is
so often repea ed in ^^e New Testament, must be verefied: ^o unto this peole,
and say, Hearing you ^all hear, but not understand; and seeing ^^u shall see,
but not perceive: for the heart (...) this people is waxed gross; etc. But to
^^oceed, we conceive that which moved ^hilosophers first to this study, was:

1. Their thoughts reflected upon their ^^ter ends; they considered how short a
^^me they had to live upon earth, which ^^ade them double their diligence in
this knowledge, that so they might not (...) like fools, but do something for
(...) glory of God, and good of other whilst they lived. It is noted by
T^vellers, that the Birds in Norway, wh^ the days be at the shortest (and the
they are not above four hours long) the fly so much the swifter: So were the
a^cient Philosophers more studious, upon consideration of the shortness of the
lives; this set them upon this subject, (...) invent such an Art which might
prese^ their lives in health, even to the utm^ period; for they knew well
enough t^ the eternal and only wise God had (...) dained that all things on
earth should (...) made up with a composition of contries, and therefore must
consist of c^^trary principles: If so, then the de^^ of one must needs be the
life of the oth^^ and that which produces one thi^^ must needs consume
another, and br^^^ forth a third more noble then the f^^mer; for whatsoever was
naturally co^^pounded in time, they knew in time m^^ also naturally be
separated; where^^^ their studies were bent how to lengt^^ ^^eir lives, and
strengthen their know^^dge. But how to do this, requires ano^^er Query.

2. It is not to be admired, for it is ^ell known to them that follow their
^^udies in the fear of God, and follow ^ot the biass of the world, but aim with
(...) single eye at the glory of God, and ^^e good of their neighbors; that he
^^ernall God the great first Being of all ^^ings, does by his Spirit inspire
wisdom (...) those that seek him, and wait, and ^^ely upon him: And some
conclude, he ^^id to these Philosophers according to that gracious promise of
his, Jam. 1.5. ^f any man want wisdom, let him ask it ^f God (that gives to
all men liberally, and uphraideth not) and it shall be given ^im. Therefore in
the second place they ^ook'd back to their own original, and ^onsidered the
rock from whence they ^ere hewed; and there they found that man was at the
first created of perfect, ^ure, and incorrupted Elements, equally ^empered and
proportioned in quality, the one not exceeding the other in any measure of
inequality whatsoever, as they do in the world; as Ovid well ^^scribes,

-- quia corpore in (...)
Frigida pugnabant calidis, humentia si^^^
Mollia cum duris, sine pondere habe^^^ pondus.
-- for in one body joy^^^
The cold and hot, and dry and hu^^^ fight,
The soft and hard, the heavy with (...) light.
Now then, if inequality be the ca^^^ of death, as we showed you before, a^^^
all the world is framed by the four ^^ments, which are contrary the one (...)
the other, there must needs be some co^bustion between them, sometimes (...)
must overcome, sometimes anoth^^ for as all likes agree with their likes, (...)
all dislikes disagree with their disli^k^^ every Element cherishing his own
q^^lity in the body of man; and hence co^^ diseases, decaying, and death in the
bo^^ of man: So man being created of p^^^ ^lements, all opposition coming by
rea^^n of impurity; for all virtues in the ^inde of man agree, its vices only
^^sagree, not only with virtue, but ^ith one another, We say, Man being
^reated of pure Elements, equally pro^ortion must needs be created in an
im^ortall condition, and so must have con^nued, had he not by his offense put
himself into a corruptible condition.

The knowledge of these things indu^ed them to reason out their Causes and
Changes, they knowing how it once ^ere, and how it now is, sought to find ^he
Cornerstone, and where should they ^oe for examples of their work, but ^here
Nature was acting? a Chaos were ^ot to be found whence to begin anew, ^n
imitation of the Creation; neither were they so simple to go about it, ha^ing
examples sufficient from what was readily separated or distinguished is the
Chaos. As,

First, the generation, growth, preservation, and deliverance of the Child in,
through, and out of the Mothers womb.

Secondly, in very truth the Unive^sality of all things produced into this
h^bitable world, especially of living cre^tures, whether by generation or
co^ruption, plainly shows them, that (...) they would be perfecting of Natu^^
they must begin where she her self do^^ This place will permit us to speak
(...) more then others have done before (...) as occasion serves;
aenigmatically we sh^^ deliver it.

3. They know that the Garden (...) Eden, as the Scripture calls it, in which
Adam was created, and which he was s^^ to till, was created also of pure
Eleme^^ uncorrupted, equally and harmonical^^ proportioned, even in the highest
pe^fection, and that all the sustenance the^^ whereupon man lived was pure,
made (...) pure Elements, not Elements elementate^ as the rest of the world was
which the Lord made for beasts to live in. The^ if there were no corruption in
the Garden how could there be mortality? as ther^ shall be no mortality after
the resurection because there shall be no corruption. W^ shall not go about
here to define wha^ this Paradise was, and what it is, only it is probable to
us it may be still remaining, though the common tenent be, that it was
destroyed by the flood. We read, Genesis 3. that the Lord turned man out of the
Garden, lest he should eat of the tree of life, and live for ever; and he
placed in the Garden Cherubims, and a flaming Sword, which turned every way, to
keep the way of the tree of Life. We say, we shall not dispute the point where
the place is; yet these few things give us leave to lay down, as being very
probable to us; in which notwithstanding we shall submit to better judgments.

1. That the place is still probably remaining, as appears by the former
Scripture; and that the bodies of Enoch and Elias may be there, it being no way
probable to us that it was consumed by the flood, for that were impossible:

First, because it was pure, and therefore no way subject to corruption.

Secondly, because there were Angels set to keep it, which had been but a
feeble guard, if they could not have kept out a little water.

2. That God created this Paradise for men only, and not for beasts; and thi^
we conclude from Genesis 2.19. where it i^ said, that God brought every beast of
the field, and foul of the air to Adam, tha^ he might name them; which plainly
shew^ they were not there before; but Paradis^ was a peculiar place, different
from the rest of the earth. We quote this the rather^ because some have stood
to prove a resurrection of beasts.

3. We conceive the resurrection of Man may be proved from hence, even from
Natural Philosophy.

First, because his body was at first made incorruptable.

Secondly, because he had an immortal Spirit breathed into him, according to
th^^ Genesis 2.7. God spirited into his nostril the spirit of life, and he became
a livin^ soul; which spirit cannot be corrupted, because it is not nourished by
food, and experience teaches us, that even in our own bodies it still
maintains a continual enmity and combat against the vices of the flesh.

4. We conceive the ancient Philosophers studied out the cause of this change,
how man being immortal, came to put on mortality; which they found to be this:
After man had sinned, God drove him, or put him out of the Garden, to live
amongst the beasts in the corruptible world, which was composed not of pure
Elements, but of Elements elementated, unequally proportioned, in respect of
heat, coldness, dryness and moisture; and being there, seeing he could not
live without nourishment, he was forced to take his nourishment from corrupt
food, by which those pure Elements of which he was made were infected, and by
degrees (though very slowly) declined from incorruption to corruption, until
at last one quality exceeded another in his body, as it did in the food which
he took for sustenance: So his body became subject to corruption, after
corruption to infirmity and sickness, and after sickness to death.

Besides, we read Genesis 5.3. that Adam begat a Son in his own likeness; that
is, as we understand, not of pure and temperate Elements, of which he wa^
created, but of corrupted and mixe^ Elements, and therefore mortal; for that
which is procreated of corrupte^ seed, such as is bred of corrupted foo^ and in
corrupted Elements, cannot b^ durable; and this is clear, if you do^ but
consider that the children of weakl^ and sickly Parents seldom live long.

Here by the way (if we may digresse^ little) we conceive the reasons,

1. Why the Patriarchs in the prim^tive times lived so long; because the^^
nature was corrupted by degrees, o^^ quality exceeded another by degrees, an^
but very leisurely; all Philosophe^ know that sudden and hasty changes a^^
inconsistent with Nature, as appea^^ plainly by the declination of the S^^ when
he is upon the tropicks; or to com^^ a little lower, by the ebbing and flowin^
of the water at London Bridge.

2. We conceive the more temperate^^ men live, the longer their lives may b^^
preserved, because they take in the les^^ corruption, and by consequence
burde^^ Nature the less.

3. We conceive that in process of ^ime, considering men's lives grow shor^er
and shorter, and their natures weaker and weaker, generation it self must needs
cease, and so the world rationally come to an end.

4. All that we know can be objected against this is from the prayer of Moses,
Psalm. 90.10. Man's years are threescore and ten, and if he live fourscore, it is
but labor and travel; intimating, that men lived in Moses his days no longer
then now they do. But to that we answer thus:

1. We conceive that Moses intended the years of his Manhood, not the years of
his Life, for himself lived much longer.

2. The difference of the Climate must also be considered, which there was far
hotter, therefore men's lives far shorter. We are informed that 40 years is a
great age there now, which is but the one half mentioned by Moses.

3. Hence we conceive the reason why not only the Patriarchs of old, but also
ancient Philosophers were wiser then now men are. We know the Animal spirit is
formed of nothing else but a mixture of blood and air, so that men by breathing
in a corrupted air, and that being mixed with corrupt blood, must need make a
corrupt Animal spirit, and b^ consequence a corrupt Understanding, though we
confess a great part of ou^ corruption of Understanding at present comes by
reason of a curse, as we shall show hereafter, which we hope shall speedily be
done away, because we have (...) promise, Dan. 12.4. That in the latter days
many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. To proceed,

5. The ancient Philosophers finding that the cause of this shortness of life
proceeded from corrupt food, and the unequal temperature of the Elements; and
knowing that where pure Elements are joined together equally in their virtues,
such a subject must needs be incorrupted in it self, and therefore preserves a
man that uses it from corrupt on; therefore they bent their studies about
finding out such a principle; in doing which, we conceive they took this course:

First, they knew that the whole Crea^ion was natural, and therefore they
^ought up and down in the Book of Nature for it. They viewed the Creation,
whether such uncorrupted Elements might be found in it, or whether impure
Elements might by Art be reduced to purity; and being so produced by
separation, whether those pure Elements might be joined together again. This
was carried in the Affirmative.

Secondly, they found this was not to be had in the Animal Kingdom, because
all creatures preserve their lives by corrupted Elements; they live by
corrupted food, and breath in corrupted air.

Thirdly, in the Vegetable Kingdom it was in vain to look for it, for all
vegetables consist of unequal temperaments, one quality exceeds another by
far, as is well known to all Physicians, that one herb is colder then another,
another hotter, a third dryer, and a fourth moyster.

Fourthly, they are resolved to make trial in the Mineral Kingdom, what
possibility of Nature might be foun^ there for such a business; there the mo^^
high God and Maker of all things r^vealed to them that there was such a^
equality to be found in Gold, that the Elements were to be found equally p^sed
there, no one quality exceeding another, and no where else.

Fifthly, then they considered wh^ was friendly to Gold, and what inim^call,
that so they might embrace the on^ and reject the other; they found that (...)
was impossible to preserve, much mo^^ to exalt a Metal, unless its enemies
we^^ known; they found out that the chiefe^ enemies of Gold were Lead, all
shar^^ and corroding water, and indeed all corrosive things, Salts, Antimony,
common Sulphur, and common Mercury: How ever, late Alchymists make use of man
of these in making their Aurum Potabil^ which we shall omit in this place t^
speak of the evil such paltry stuff man do to the body of man, but reserve it
t^ its proper place; howsoever, let it b^ sufficient that Nature teaches
Philosophers to mix likes with likes, and no ^^slikes, so Nature produces all
things (...) the Creation; But our modern Al^ymists go as preposterously to
work, as ^^ought a man should attempt to get a ^^ilde by copulation with a
Timber-log, (...) to calcine metals out of Horse-dung, (...) distill wood out
of a dog.

6. They considered whether it were ^ossible for man to attain to the know^^dge
of that; and this was carried in the ^ffirmative also, and upon good reason,
^^r Man is an Epitome of the whole ^^orld; nay, he was at first made of the
^^ery quintessence of it, that so he might ^^old forth the wonderful power and
wis^ome of God, and glorify and praise ^od; therefore if whatsoever be in the
Creation, be to be found also in the body ^f man, he must needs be capable of
^nowing whatsoever is in the Creation, because he may find it in his own body:
^^lence is the reason of the influence of ^^e stars upon the body of man,
because ^^e has a Microcosmical Sun, Moon, and ^^tars in his own body.

7. Then to work they went, and con^^dered in Gold (mystically meant) how they
might separate the pure from (...) impure; and by joining pure to pu^^ they
might by the help of fire form (...) much more noble then it was at first;
(...) they knew well enough that all cor^^ption was nothing else but a gross
m^^ter mixed with the pure, and that th^^ was no way to separate this but by
put^^ faction, and that this putrefaction w^^ to be performed by the mediation
of fi^^ which we shall speak of more anon.

8. They searched out where the great harmonies in the world consisted, a they
found that it consisted between (...) Sun and Gold, the Moon and Silve^
(Philosophically) Wine and Man; (...) they considered, that the vital hear^
all things proceeded from the beams (...) the Sun; and the radical moisture
(...) things, from the beams of the Moon, (...) because there was no harmony
betw^^ these and man, without a medium, t^^ resolved to spend their wits to
unite (...) terrestrial Sun and Moon to the body (...) Man, by the help of
spirit of wine; t^ put them into diverse disquisitions, (...) which God revealed
unto them ma^^ divine secrets in Nature; as namely,

First, Aurum vitae, which though it were the first thing we found out in this
study, yet we shall be silent in the way of preparing it, it being the secret
of one already in London, whom we shall not dishearten in future studies; only
this commendation we will give of it, that it is a singular medicine,
especially in diseases of moisture, it being very probably the first matter of
our Creation, and therefore a true medicine to restore and preserve us.

2. Aurum Potabile, which we have at last through Gods assistance attained, and
about which this Treatise is the Philosophical way of making, which we shall
give you by and by; and no farther have we yet gone.

What Natural Philosophy is requisite to a Student in this Art. LIB. II.
LEt him that intends to employ his Natural Philosophy this way, namely, for
the preservation of life and health, go learn it of Nature her self, and not
of Aristotle, lest he beshrew himself for his pains: Let him take notice, that
the most high Creator of all things has given commission to Nature, to be
Princess both over the Celestial and Terrestrial words (for as there is a
Trinity in Unity in the Godhead, and a Unity in Trinity; so is there a
triplicity also to be found in all his works) therefore consider that God has
created a threefold world.

First, Elementary; which is lowest in dignity.

Secondly, Celestial; which is next above that.

Thirdly, Intellectual; which is the highest of all; and thrice happy is he
that attains unto it.

2. Consider, that of these three worlds the eternal and only wise God has
so ordered it, by his eternal and unsearchable decree, that every inferior
should be governed by its superior, and receive its influence and virtue
therefrom: For God the first Being, and chief Worker of all things, governs the
Celestial world, namely, the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, and all the host of
heaven, by the Intellectual world, namely, the Angels; and the Elementary
world, and all Elementary bodies, namely, Minerals, Animals, and Vegetables, by
the Celestial world, namely, the Stars.

3. As there is a Unity in the Godhead, so is there also one entire Unity in
every one of these Worlds: For,

First, in the Intellectual world there (...) one Archangel Michael, the
supreme (...) all the Angels.

Secondly, in the Celestial world ther^ is one Sun, the giver of life, light,
and motion to the Creation.

Thirdly, in the Elementary world ther^ is one Philosophers stone, the Epitome
o^ all Natural virtues.

Fourthly, there are three Arts for t^ find out these three Unities, their
mysteries and divisions.

1. Natural Philosophy. 2. Astrology. 3. Divinity.
1. The Natural Philosophy seeks after the virtues of the Elementary world and
the various mixtures of Natural things in Minerals, Animals, and Vegetables;
(and here by the way take notice, that when at any time we mention Animals, we
do not include Man, the ridiculous description of whom was give^ by Plato, Homo
est animal bipes sine plumis; A Man was an Animal without feathers, that went
upon two feet; for which Apish definition he was sufficiently laughed at by
Diogenes, we account man to be of a far nobler nature;) the natural
Philosopher moreover inquires into the causes, effects, times, places,
fashions, events; the whole, and every part of the whole in the Mineral,
Animal, and Vegetable Kingdom; and how Nature produces them by the Elements.

2. The Astrologer is, or at leastwise ought to be, very well versed in every
part of Natural philosophy, (or else he will hang betwixt heaven and earth (as
the Papists say Erasmus does, between heaven and hell) being not able to reach
the one, nor get sure footing upon the other) from thence he enquires, and
searches the motion and course of the Celestial bodies, and what effects
such motions must naturally produce upon Minerals, Animals, and Vegetables.

3. Then in comes the Divine, who being admirably skilled in both these Arts
(else we conceive him unfit to be a Divine, and unfitter to receive tithes) and
he teaches what God is, what the spirit and soul of man, what an Angel is, and
wh^^ Religion is, and how a man should glorify God in his life and
conversation.

Here, by the way, you see the first reason of the institution of Universities
for the first institution of most thing was good, corruption came in by time it
was questionless that people might b^ studious in these Arts, that so they
might the better teach others.

Thus you have in general what knowledge is requisite for him that intends the
study of Hermetick Philosophy, which that we may declare more clearly, we sha^^
branch it out into particulars, and show how far an Hermeticall Philosophe^
ought to be skilled in the knowledge o^ these three worlds; and let each stand
in a Section by it self.

Of the Elementary World. SECT. I.
HE that would attain to these Arts, must first begin at the lower end of the
Ladder, and so climb up to the top; but let him be sure one foot be fast
before he remove the other, let him take heed of building his foundation upon
falsehoods; let him not stick to the Letter what we or others write, but let
him consider whether it be possible in, or agreeable to Nature, or not; if not,
there is some mystical meaning in it, which he must diligently search out.

Also, he that would attain the true knowledge of the Elements, must begin at
generals, and afterward come to particulars, and so shall we at this time:
therefore consider in the general.

First, that there are four Elements, viz. Fire, Earth, Water, and Air; by
which all things in the Elementary world are generated, not by beating o^ them
together, as men beat clay, to mak^ Tobacco-pipes, but after another mos^
secret manner, as we shall show you by and by.

2. Consider that pure Elements are invisible, not subject to our sight, that
water which we see, and that fire which we see, is far enough off from being
pure, but are more or less mixed, and are often changed into one another by
Nature; as the Fire is changed into Smoke, the Smoke into Air, the Air into
Water, etc. as we shall show you more anon: it is but the garment of an Element
that is to be seen by a vulgar eye; pure Elements are only to be seen by
Philosophers, and that by Art.

3. If we may make bold a little to deal with Aristotle, and his followers in
folly; they held themselves, and also taught others, that every Element had two
specifical qualities; as, the Fire was hot and dry, the Water cold and moist,
the Air hot and moist, and the Earth cold and dry; so the Fire was inimicall to
the Water, and the Air to the Earth; but if you are minded to find the truth,
you must look for it far another way, for these qualities are no way inherent
in the Elements themselves, but accidental to Elementary bodies; for he that
has but half a grain of Philosophy in him, must needs know that pure Elements
are temperate, else how could they be pure?

4. We told you before there was a Trinity in the Deity, and if so, there must
needs be a Trinity in all his works; and because there is a Trinity in the
Godhead, therefore is the number Three a most powerful number, a number of
perfection, all creatures both in the Vegetable and Mineral world, consists of
three principles, Sulphur, Mercury, and Sal; nay, Man himself, which is an
Epitome of the Creation, and bears the image of the Creator, consists of three
essences, Spirit, Soul, and Body; as the Apostle Paul witnesses in these
words, That your spirits, souls, and bodies may be kept blameless at the
coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. These three essence^ in man, answers to the
three worlds; the Spirit of man to the Intellectual worl^ the Soul to the
Celestial, and the Bod^ to the Elementary; so also every Element consists
of three qualities which are essentially in them, viz.

1. The Air has motion, thinness, an^ darkness. 2. The Fire, motion,
brightness, an^ thinness. 3. The Water, motion, darkness, an^ thickness. 4.
The Earth, darkness, thickness and quietness. 5. We desire you to take
special notice of this, that the Fire is twice more thin then the Air, thrice
more movabl^ and four times more bright.
The Air is twice more bright, thric^ more thin, and four times more movab^^
then the Water.

The Water is twice more bright, thric^ more thin, and four times more movabl^
then the Earth; and vice versa: as therefore the Fire is to the Air, so is the
A^^ to the Water, and the Water to the Earth; and on the contrary, as the Earth
is to the Water, so is the Water to the Air, and the Air to the Fire.

6. Seeing then the Elements consist of three qualities, we will take them all
under a threefold consideration.

First, pure Elements, which are neither compounded nor changed, but are
incorruptible, not of which, but by which the virtues of all natural things
are brought forth to act; no man is able to declare their virtues, because they
are able to do all things upon all things: He that is ignorant of these, will
never be able to obtain either the Philosophers stone, or Aurum Potabile.

Secondly, compounded Elements, changeable and impure, yet such as may be
reduced to their purity again by Art; by the virtue of such, when they are thus
reduced to their simplicity, is perfected all the common operations of Nature,
and they are indeed the foundation of the whole work of Aurum Potabile, and
perhaps of the Philosophers stone also.

Thirdly, there are those things which a^ called Elements, which indeed
originalls of themselves are not Elements, but a^ twice compounded and
commixed, various and interchangeable one with another.

7. These things we thought good t^ lay down in the general, concerning the
Elements; we confess these are dee^ mysteries, which but few know; nay none
but those few that learned of Nature; (Tradition is a monster, away with it;)
yet never think to obtain A^rum Potabile, till thou know how to reduce these
out of one order into another, impure into pure, compounded into simple, and
understandest distinctly the nature, power, and virtue of them, i^ number,
degree, and order, without dividing the substance; and when thou dos^ so, there
is nothing almost in the three worlds, but thou may understand. These things
we thought good to premise concerning the Elements in general, we come now to
speak of them in particular, and shall place each of them in a Chapter by it
self.

Of the Element of EARTH. CHAP. I.
BEfore we begin, give us leave,

First, to premise a Caution. Secondly, to answer an Objection.
For Caution, consider that the ancient Philosophers minded, followed, and
regarded Nature her self in all her ways, and nothing else; they knew the
steps of Nature were clearly seen in the procreation and generation of Man,
where she observes her own law and rules; and they being contented with the
plain way of Nature alone, attained to the utmost period of all their studies
and hopes also, and found out those things which the wi^^ of the modern
Alchymists would not, no^ could not reach to, for they neglecte^ the plain way
of Nature, and ran altogether upon intricacies; and were so bu^^ in Distilling,
Calcining, Circulating Sublimating, and Precipitating, that Hermes himself (the
Father of Philosophers) were now alive, or Gober, or Ra^mundus Lullius, they
would have bee^ accounted Fools, and not Philosopher amongst them; for they
neglect always what they know, and either abuse wha^ they have already found, or
else throw it by, like an old Almanac out of date and are still seeking after
strange whimsies making Nature her self subject to their addle brains, and idle
fancies.

The objection we shall answer before we begin, is this:

What is the reason, seeing there is a Trinity in Unity in the Go head, and all
the world consist of a triplicity, that there are four Elements, how or which
way came the fourth cre^ping i^?

To this we answer thus: The Deity which governs all things is a^tive, yea the
Author of all action and motion; so ^lso is there but a triplicity of Elements
which have motion, and are active; the ^arth is fixed and passive, and only
^upplyes matter for the other to act upon; ^or as nothing can be acted, but
there must needs be matter subministred to act upon, man cannot build a Castle
in the air with nothing; the Children of Israel (you know) could not burn
bricks without straw, therefore of necessity ^here must be one Element to
subminister matter for the rest to act upon; for as ^here could be no influence
in the Heavens, unless there were Elements, or Elementary bodies to receive
this influence. Or, to come home a little nearer to the point, and use a
comparison a little more familiar to the vulgar; as in ^he procreation of
children, the man only ^cts, but it would be long enough cro^^ got a child,
were there not a woman ^o supply matter to act upon; and then you know well
enough that every active ^rinciple must needs be in motion, else it cannot act,
every passive principle must ^eeds be fixed; for when a Carpenter hews a
timber-log, the Carpenter m^^^ needs move, and the log must needs (...) still,
for it is impossible his work should go forward all the while he sits sti^^
upon it; or hew it, whilst it is draw^ about with horses; and according as the
Carpenter is an Artist or not an Arti^^ in his Calling, so the timber-log is
eith^^ well or ill hewed: Just so, for all the world it is in this point we now
discour^ of, three of the Elements have motion and therefore are active; the
other, vi^ the Earth, is passive, and supplies matt^^ for the other to act
upon; and accordin^ as the Elements acting are either pure impure, so they are
either well or ill; lame man cannot run, neither can a blin^ see; according as
the Earth they act upon is either pure or impure, so is the conclusion of the
work either good or bad for the wisest Carpenter breathing cannot make a good
timber-log of an o^ rotten tree. And thus by the way yo^ see the reasons why so
many have bee^ studying after the Philosophers ston^ and so few found it,
because they eith^^ work upon impure principles, or else the work impurely upon
pure principles.

Having premised this, we come now to treat of the Element it self, viz. Earth,
in which consider,

1. That the Earth brings forth nothing of it self, but is the Nurse and matrix
of all things, it receives whatsoever seed, sperm, or commixtion the other
three Elements distill or project into it; when the sperm is good, it brings
forth good things; when the sperm is impure, it brings forth what it can, for
it is ordained so to do.

2. When the Earth has received the sperm from the other Elements, it keeps
what of it is to be kept, and what of it is to be brought to light, it brings
to light.

3. It receives the Celestial rays and influence of all the Stars, as being
ordained of God to be the object, subject, and receptacle of them, whereby it
does not only bring forth what is to be brought forth, but it multiplyes what
it receives, and separates the good from the bad, the pure from the impure.

4. In the Earth are contained the seeds and seminal virtues of all Elementary
bodies, and it has also a triplici^^ in it self.

1. Mineral. 2. Animal. 3. Vegetable.
5. It is made fruitful by the oth^^ Elements, as we told you before, as al^
by the influence of the Heavens, a^^ therefore it receives the abundance of a^^
things, and is the fountain, foundation and mother from whence all things
spring.

We shall a little satisfy those that a^^ studious in Philosophy in the truth
(...) this, and so conclude this Chapter.

1. Take as much Earth as you will separate it, wash it, cleanse it, purify i^
calcine it, bring it even to purity it sel^ if thou know how to do it,
Philosophers do; then take this Earth thus purified, and lay it in the open
air, the other three Elements and heavenly influence of the Sun, Moon, and
Stars, will in short time impregnate it with such virtues, that it shall bring
forth plants, m^^tals, stones, worms, or whatsoever it fit to produce.

2. Take the ashes of any herb, be it what herb soever, provided they be all
herbs of the same sort, purify the ashes with fire and water, till you have
brought them to pure Earth; then set this Earth thus purified into the open
air, and the heavenly influences by mediation of the Elements will again
impregnate it, and bring forth the same herb again in its due season; for
indeed a plant though it be burned to ashes, yet by a secret and wonderful
power of the Almighty, whereby he teaches wisdom to the Sons of Wisdom, it
retains still the same form it had before, though not visibly to the eye of the
vulgar.

3. We have read that this may be visible to the eye by Art, and that a
Physician of Crocaven, kept in glasses the ashes of most known herbs, which
with a gentle heat he could reduce to their own proper forms; a Gentleman that
came to him once for curiosity sake, desired to see a Rose, he took down a
glass wherein the ashes of a Rose were kept, and held it over a lighted
candle; the ashes so soon as the heat came to them, began to move, and
dispersed themselves up and down the glass, like a thick cloud, and at last by
equal division of themselves, represented a Rose so fresh and fair, as if it
had been naturally growing on a tree; the learned Gentleman that saw it,
practiced himself to do the like, but without success, till a last accident
gave him the sight of what his Art could not, for having one time extracted
salt out of certain Nettles he set the Lee of the ashes abroad one Winter
night, and in the morning he found it frozen, but to the admiration both of
himself and all that saw it, the nettles presented themselves upon the Ice in
such perfect form and color, that living Nettles could not surpass them upon
which he made these verses thus translated into English:

This secret proves, that though the body dye,
The form does still within its ashes lie.
We conceive it probable, the reason why this Gentleman bestowed this labor in
vain about the trial of this rare experience, was, because he did not draw the
salt well out of the ashes, for till that be all drawn away, it remains still a
compost; however, this will absolutely prove a resurrection of man, and if
wisely considered, gives no small help to the attaining not only of Aurum
Potabile, but also of the Philosophers stone.

And so much for this Chapter.
Of the Element of FIRE. CHAP. II.
WE told you in the last Chapter that the Elements could no^ work unless they
had matter to worl^ upon, which matter the Earth supplye^ them with; in the
next place we ought t^ consider by what Nature works, an^ then how she works,
viz. by putrefactio^ and generation.

As for the matter by which Nature works, it is the other three Elements, on^ of
which, namely Fire, is the subject o^ our present discourse; for indeed Fir^
both quickens all things, and destroy^ all things: This was very elegantl^
(though something fabulously described by the Poets; (And here by the way, we
desire young students in Philosophy to be very studious in reading of them, for
he shall find excellent truths to be fained in th^^^ Fables, and that we
conceive was the reason of the first learning of them in the Grammar Schools,
which practice is still followed, though few know a reason why:) the Poets say,
that Prometheus having made curious Images, asked Pallas what he should do to
quicken them, she took him up to heaven with her, and bid him take what he
pleased there; and as he rode up and down in her chariot, he saw all things was
quickened by Fire, whereupon he took his ferula and lighted it at the chariot
of the Sun, and brought that fire down upon earth, and quickened his Images. I
forbear to give the moral, it being very well known to all Philosophers, and
they know well enough by the help of Pallas or Wisdom, how to fetch fire from
the Sun to quicken their operations.

But that we may be plain in this E^^ment, we shall consider,

1. What it is. 2. What its effects and oper^tions are.
1. What it is. Consider (...) t^^ Fire is but one, though it center in ^^vers
places; it is the most pure of a^ the Elements, so hating all impurity that it
dissolves and separates whatso^ver compound comes aneer it.

2. It is in this work, though it be b^^ one, yet to be taken under a threefor^
consideration.

1. As it is in the Heavens. 2. As it is central in the Earth. 3. As it is
common upon the Earth, though we confess this last conduces not much to this
operation, something it does.
1. As it is in the Heavens it is bound less and invisible, guarding and
preserving nature, enlivening all the Creation giving life and light to all the
creature^ and making them fruitful. But of th^^ we shall speak more when we
come t^ treat of the Sun.

2. As it is centrall in the Earth, it causes that heat which is in the Earth
and Fountains, and is not only that that which makes Minerals, Metals, and
Stones, by joining it self with the beams of the Celestial Sun and Moon, and
causes all Vegetables to spring and grow, but also it imparts part of it self,
whatsoever it brings forth; for whatsoever lives, lives by reason of its own
proper enclosed heat, which it receives from this centrall fire.

And here by the way give us leave to tell you what was the first original of
that notable fiction, that Hell fire was placed in the middle of the Earth. The
Moderns knew by the Writings of ancient Philosophers that there was a centrall
fire in the Earth, and Divinity told them that there is or should be such a
place as Hell; and they being ignorant of the whole course of Nature, how that
there must needs be a centrall fire in the Earth, or else the Earth could not
subsist it self, nor yet bring forth its increase, imagined that to be Hell
fire; a sottish opinion, more beseeming a Jackdaw then a Philosopher, as thoug^
the heat of Hell fire caused the Ear^ to bring forth fruit for the benefit
mankind.

3. Fire is to be spoken of as it is upon Earth, and so it is a composition
ver^ much commixed: This is that people u^^ to dress meat withal, and
sometime to warm themselves with, though exe^cise is a far better way, when it
can b^ used to procure heat, because it quicken the vital spirits, and equally
distribute them through the body, and hears man by a principle within him,
which proper to himself, and his own; an^ not by a principle without him,
which is improper to himself, and not his own and that is the reason that that
hea^ which is acquired by exercise, remain^ much longer then that which is
procured in the Chimney corner. Besides, experience will teach every man, that
tha^ heat which is procured by action, animates the spirits, and makes them
active; that which is procured by sitting by the fire, makes a man dull and
sleepy, unfit for all actions.

To proceed: This fire is burning, destroying, and consuming, making head
against, and opposing every thing that opposes it, as you may plainly see,
that the more it is blowed, the more it burns, it dissolves and separates
whatsoever Nature has conjoined, it mischiefs and unmakes whatsoever Nature
has made.

Thus having showed you what Fire is, come we now in the next place to show you
what its opperations are; to which purpose consider,

1. Fire is stirred up to opperation, either by Nature, or by the skilful Son
of Nature; or if you will, naturally and artificially.

2. All impurities and pollutions are naturally purged by Fire, all compounded
things are dissolved, and made simple by it, if a wise man have but the
handling of it.

3. We desire you to consider of this also, and consider of it seriously, that
as Water purges, cleanses, and dissolveth all things that are not fixed, so
Fire purges and perfecteth all things that are fixed; and as Water conjoy^^^
all things that are dissolved, so Fir^^ separates all things that are conjoined.

4. Fire separateth, cleanses, digestet^^ colors, and causes all seeds to
grow to ripen, and being ripe, it expels the^^ by the sperm into several
matrixes, (...) (if you will, into diverse places of the Earth, for the Earth is
the Mother an^ womb of all things, as we showed yo^ before) these places of
the Earth, a^^ they are hotter or colder, dryer or moyster, purer or impurer,
so is the diversity of things in the bowels of the Earth caused; for the
eternal and only wise God has ordained that all things o^^ the Earth should
be contrary to on^ another, that so the death of the on^ should be the life of
the other, that that which produces one thing, should consume another, and
produce a third pure clear then the former.

Thus have you the Philosophical cause or reason of the natural death of all
things, viz. because they are made up with a^composition of contraries; yet
this ^s certain, that where pure Elements are joined together equally in their
virtues, such a subject must needs be uncorrupted, because in purity there is
neither inequality, nor yet contrariety; and such must the Philosophers Stone
be, and so in a great proportion is Aurum Potabile.

Of the Element of AIR. CHAP. III.
THis is a most certain truth, d^^nyed by no Philosophers, th^^ all things are
generated by putrefaction and that putrefaction is caused by continual moist
heat, or hot moisture, which you will; for by mean of this all things are
changed from on^ color to another color, from on^ smell to another smell,
from one virtue to another virtue, from one property and quality to another
property and quality: But here is that which will try the skill of a
Philosopher and which we desire every one that ^ntends this study, to be very
careful, (...) that this change is made either into better or worse diverse
ways, so that if Philosopher go not wisely to work, ^e will mend his
operations, as sour A^e mends in Summer.

The reasons of this we conceive to ^e these:

1. Things are changed into better or worse, according to the nature of the
things changed; for it is impossible to ^ake an Animal of Gold, or Aurum
^^otabile, of any excrementitious thing. 2. Things are changed into better or
worse, according to the temperature of ^he Air changing; and this Philosophers
must be very careful in, that the Air neither come short of, nor yet exceed
its ^ue proportion. 3. Things are changed into better or worse, according to
the quality of the ^ombe or matrix they are changed in; ^or if that be foul, so
will the matter ^e; you know, if the pot be dirty, so will the porrage be.
We desire Philosophers to view th^^ with a heedfull eye, the exact kno^ledge
of which is infinitely necessa^^ to the attainment both of Aurum Po^^bile, and
the Philosophers Stone.

We come now to the matter it self this Chapter, viz. the Air, in whi^^
consider,

1. That it is a body volatile, (...) such as may by Art be fixed, and wh^^ it
is fixed, it makes every body pe^^trable.

2. It shows forth clearly to the So^^ of men that God is ubiquitary, beca^ if
the Air which is but a creature fi^ all places, much more must the Creat^ do it.

3. It moves, fills, and give subsistence to all things. It is held (...)
diverse Authors to be the chiefest E^ment, and that which gives subsistence all
the rest of the Elements; for they (...) Fire is nothing else but inflamed A^^
and Water nothing but congealed A^^ and Earth nothing but congealed Wat^^
therefore the Hebrew Rabbis accou^^ it not an Element, but a certain Medium or
Glue, which joins together all things in the Creation.

4. It receives the influences of all the Celestial bodies, and communicates
them being received to the other Elements, and to all mixed bodies.

5. It receives into it self the species of all things, all Ideas, both natural
and ^rtificiall; it receives and retains all manner of speeches, whether good
or bad, both prayers and imprecations; and that is the reason some peoples ill
wishes, especially when they come from (...) venomous mind, work such bad
effects, and many times do mischief; for it makes impression upon men and women
breathing in this Air.

6. It many times causes strange and true Dreams to those that are asleep, and
divinations and sudden true apprehensions even to those that are awaked,
according as it is ordered or disposed either by the Spirit of God, or
mediation of Angels; hence it comes ^o pass, that a man passing by the place
where a man was murdered, or a^^ great battle sought, or the like, he^^
presently surprised with fear and h^^ror, together with trembling and sh^^king
all over his body, because the A^^^ is full of the dreadful species of ma^^
slaughter and Ideas of blood, whi^^ being breathed in troubles the intern^^
spirit, with the like species which c^seth fear and astonishment; for (...)
very sudden impression astonisheth Nature.

Thus we have showed you what (...) operations of the Air are; now, (...) we
may come a little closer home the point, we shall treat of the (...) properly
as it is, and so it is to be co^dered as it is,

1. Pure. 2. Less pure. 3. Gross.
First, as the Air pure, or of its purest substance, are the vital spirits of
all living creatures made, and this is that which causes them to breath, the
word Spiritus coming from spiro, to breath: If the Etymology of words were
rightly considered, it would set a period to diverse of scores, if not hundreds
of errors, which are as frequent among ^our Divines, as Butter-flyes in the
Sun, they taking them up upon trust without any examination.

Secondly, as it is less pure, so it is ^n its own proper sphere; and this is
that we breath in, and commonly call Air; it was in Paradie pure, and is indeed
the food of the spirit, as meat is of the body: But in the habitable world in
which we live, it is not pure, but author sometimes of diseases, and sometimes
of death.

Thirdly, the Air which is grosse^ compassed about with Water, as t^^ centrall
Fire is with Earth, because t^^ Water and the Air are friendly (...) one
another. It is the Air bei^^ mixed with Water in the body of t^^ Earth, which
causes Earthquake and being mixed with the water (...) the Sea, sometimes
makes the S^^ work extremely when there is no win^ or but very little, as
Seamen know w^ enough.

Fourthly, the Air lives in all thing and places a seed in the other E^^ments,
as Males do in Females, it n^^risheth them, makes them concei^ and preserves
the conception, bei^^ conceived; for in this Element is (...) seed of all
things, which by Circu^^tion it distributes into Matrixes (...) Wombes, by the
sperm and menstru^^ of the World, which we shall speak m^^ of in the next
Chapter.

Fifthly, in and by this Element, not only Minerals, Animals, and Vegetables
live, but also all the other Elements.

For proof of which consider,

1. Water, if it be kept from the Air, putrefies. 2. Fire, if it be kept from
the Air, is extinguished, and quickly goes out, though it were never so hot
before; those that are practitioners in the Art of Alchimy, know how by adding
more or less Air to their Fire, to make it burn more or less fiercely;
according to the quantity of Air it receives, so is the quantity of the heat it
gives. 3. To wind up all briefly, the whole structure and fabric of the World
is preserved and upheld by Air, which clearly appears, in that all Animals, yea
man himself dies, if you take A^^ from him; for as we told you before the
spirit was made of pure Ai^ so is it preserved by breathing in the Air. 6. In
this Element, by virtue of t^^ Fire; is contained that imagined se^^ which
constringeth the menstruum (...) the World, as is clearly seen in t^^ growth of
Trees and Herbs; f^^ there goes forth a sperm through t^^ pores of the Earth,
by reason of t^^ perpetual acting of the centrall F^^ which the Air by an
equal proportion according as it is decrced by the G^^ of Nature, and acted
and perform^^ by Nature, constringeth and congeale^ by drops, so that Trees
grow (...) degrees, day after day, drop aft^^ drop, till at last they come to
great. 7. We told you before, that in the Element was the seed of all thing we
shall now show you how it make use of this seed, and so conclude this Chapter.
Presently after the Creation, there was included in this Element a magnetic
virtue, by the great Creator of all things, which if it had not, it could not
attract nourishment, and if it did not attract nourishment, the seed could not
increase nor multiply. It is conceived by no wise man we are confident, but
that when God bid all things multiply and increase in the beginning, he gave
them some natural means whereby they might increase or multiply (this we
confess few study after, the more is the pity, a little knowledge will serve
their turn, so they can but get money) then we conceive he placed this
magnetic virtue in the Air, that so as the Lodestone draws Iron, so the Air
draws to it self the nourishment of the menstruum of the World, viZ. Water,
for it is the Leader of the Water, and the hidden virtue of it is included in
all seed, tha^ so it may attract to it radical moisture, to make it fruitful.

Of the Element of WATER. CHAP. IV.
BEfore we come to the matter it self, give us leave to premise a few things
which are very necessary to be understood of all that intend this
Philosophical study.

First, that the Seed of a thing is one thing, and the Sperm another.

Secondly, that the Earth receives the Sperm of things, and the Water receives
the Seed in like manner.

Thirdly, that the Air distills into the Water by means of Fire, and the Water
conveys the very same into the Earth.

Fourthly, that there is always ple^^ of Sperm, but not always Seed
answ^rable: This causes many defects i^ the operation of Nature. We sha^^ lay
them down in a general way, a^^ leave every Philosopher to apply th^^ every
one to his own particular oper^tions.

I. Sometimes the Seed comes in to sparingly, or not so plentifully as (...)
expected, and this is caused by wa^^ of a sufficient heat to digest it; an^
this must needs hinder many goo^ things which nature would have prod^ced, had
she had a sufficiency of heat, for where the Sperm enters without seed, (...)
goes out again as it comes in, and bring forth no fruit.

II. Sometimes the Sperm enters in to the Matrix with a sufficiency of Seed but
the Womb of the World is fou^ and not fit for conception, as being burdened
with gross, foul, sulphurous and phlegmatic vapors, so that (...) brings forth
either Abortives or Monsters.

Have a special care of this in your operations, or else you will never get
Aurum Potabile while your eyes are open.

We come now to a particular disquisition of the Element in hand, in which we
shall observe the same method we did in the former, and show you,

1. What it is. 2. What its operations be.
1. What it is.

It is the Menstruum of the World, the heavyest of the Elements, full of
unctious phlegm, cold and moist, and well tempered with Air.

Secondly, it is divided into 1. Pure. 2. Less pure. 3. Gross.


1. The most pure Water is Celestial, yea above the heavens, as w^ shall show
you more at large in the third Section.

2. The less pure Water remains i^ the Air, being dissolved or distille^ into
Air, by the heat of the centra^ Sun.

3. The plain and gross Water remains in its sphere, and makes one glob^ with
the body of the Earth, and according to the will of God, by the operation of
Nature, preserves an^ keeps every thing that is subtle the particular way. How
it does it, we sha^ show you in the third Section.

Having thus showed you what Wate^ is, we come now to show you wha^ its
operations are, and therefore consider,

1. That it is the Menstruum of the World, which penetrating the Air, b^ reason
of the continual distillation of the central Fire, draws along with it a war^
vapor, which causes a natural generation of those things which the Earth as a
Matrix is impregnated with; for he that is well skilled in the generation of
Man, cannot be unskilled in the way how Nature generates all things else, it is
impossible he should; because himself is an Epitome of them all; for when the
Earth as a Matrix receives a due proportion of Seed, mixed proportionally with
Sperm (be the Seed of what kind soever, it matters not) Nature presently
begins the conception, and proceeds without intermission, till she has brought
it to perfection, and when she has brought it to perfection, she nourishes
it, and cherishes it, even to its utmost period.

2. The remaining moisture or sperm which is not fit for any generation that is
excellent, Nature expells to the sides or superficies of the Earth, where the
heat of the centrall Fire putrefies it, and by that putrefaction is generated
small vermin and worms.

3. We desire you would diligently heed this, that the Earth is easily
dissolved and purified in the Water; ever one that has but the least skill in
A^^ chymie knows how to do it; but the Air is congealed in it, and radicall^
joined with it, but how this is done, onl^ Philosophers know.

4. He that is a real student in Philosophy, may easily see diverse wonder of
Nature in this Element, as it were i^ Sperm; but it is the best and safe^^
course to take that Sperm in which the Astrall Seed by the influence (...) the
Stars is already proportioned, b^ cause Nature produces pure things b^ the
first putrefaction, but far mo^^ pure and noble by the second.

These things we thought good (...) inform you of concerning the Elementary
world, wherein you may see,

First, that the Fire preserves the Earth, that it be not drowned and di^solved.

Secondly, the Air preserves the Fir^ that it be not extinguished.

Thirdly, the Water preserves the Earth that it be not burnt.

And thus much for this Section.
OF THE CELESTIAL WORLD. SECT. II.
Proemium
BEfore we begin, we desire to premise these few things to all such as are
studious in Philosophy, and indeed they shall find them very necessary.

1. That these inferior Elemen^ which we have treated of in the former
Section, have a mutual sympath^ with the Celestial bodies, viz. the Sun,
Moon, and Stars, and must need have, because they are all made out (...) one
and the same Chaos.

2. That they are governed by the superior as the more worthy, and the we
prove by this argument, becau^^ this thing which we call obedience is to be
found only in the Elementa^ world.

3. We desire you to consider ser^ously, that motion is the cause of a change,
both of growing and with^ring, both of being born and dying and although the
action of movin^ shall continue in the general, yet ev^ry particular motion
begins and en^ in its proper time.

4. We also find out, and it is a truth, that time it self is measured out by
motion, and that the original of all motion is in the Heavens, and
particularly in the Sun; by which motion in the Heavens, the constant change
and conversion of all things out of one thing into another proceeds; he has
not lived a Philosopher a Summer and a Winter, nay indeed not a day and a
night, which ignorant of this.

5. Consider also that there is no way from the beginning to the end without a
mean; for there is no passage from Spring to Autumn but by Summer, nor from
Winter to Summer but by Spring; and if you heed it by the eye of reason, you
shall find that all changes follow these conversions of time and years; these
conversions of times increase heat and dryness, coldness and moisture, and
both life and death, generation and corruption increase and decrease of living
creatures, comes by reason of heat, cold nesse, dryness and moisture.

6. If you consider it well, you sha^^ find that the Celestial bodies tal^
them, quatenus bodies, are not change^ nor capable of change till the fina^
dissolution, but these Elementary b^dies are always changing continually
either increase or decrease, and never stand at a stay; and if so, as is mo^^
certain, then of necessity the Coelesti^^^ bodies are by nature active, and
the^^ Elementary bodies by nature passive^^ and it is that which is active
whi^^ causes or produces alterations in th^^ which is passive; then it will
follo^^ the Celestial bodies give the form (...) all things, the Elementary
world su^^^ ministers matter for this form.

7. The truth of this will appear (...) we may make such a comparison) (...)
all Handy crast Trades; in a Carpe^ter in building houses, a Brick-mak^ in
making bricks, a Tailor in stitching garments; the Carpenter by his motion hews
the timber-log into its proper form, the log subministers matter for the
Carpenter to work upon; the Brick-maker makes the clay into the form of a
brick, the clay subministers matter to this form; the Tailor cuts out and sows
the cloth into the form of a garment, the cloth administers matter to this
form: Just so for all the world it is between the Celestial and Elementary
bodies, and can be denied by none, unless any be so frantic to deny that to
be in the Heavens, which is conspicuous upon the Earth; or that to be higher in
dignity, which God has made higher in place. We cannot but admire to see any
should be so sottish to deny it, as ever saw it rain, or knew that the rain
which comes from above made the Earth fruitful.

8. All things are moved by the Sun, who by moving his own body, moves the
Creation, and thence comes a continual acting and procreating faculty from
thence comes that inbred he^^^ both in Animals and Seeds, and cause^^ them to
produce their like; which production is either good or bad, pure o^^ impure,
small or great, according (...) the Luminaries receive good or bad^ friendly or
inimicall Aspects or Raye^ from the five Planets; for as a Key (...) formed
either well or ill by a Smith according to the measure of heat, magnitude,
number, and manner of th^^ strokes and fi^ings, viz. according to the quan^ity
of motion and skill o^^ him that moves, and the goodness o^ the thing moved:
Just so for all the world is the operation of the Coelestia^^ world upon the
Elementary world; the^^ Sun and Moon form things either good or bad, perfect or
imperfect, according as they receive pure or impur^ Rays from the five
Planets, and accor^ing as they find fit matter in the Elem^nts to work upon.

9. Consider, that as in the generation of Man; (for we confess ingenuously we
have much bettered our knowledge by the due consideration of that)

The first principle of Man's generation, is the first kindling of the
Microcosmicall Sun in the midst of the Seed, even as the Sun is in the midst of
the Creation, (of which we shall speak more in the next Section) and this
Microcosmicall Sun procreateth and disposes the rest of the parts of the body,
according to his own inward force and power, according as he is supplied with
radical mysture from the Microcosmall Moon, and fit matter from the Parents:
so the Celestial Sun, which is the centrall Fire of the Creation, according
as he is affected by the Moon and the five Planets moves and disposes these
inferior and obedient bodies, whose office is to subminister matter for him
and the Moon to work upon.

10. Here by the way, you see the errors of almost all Writers in Anatomy; some
hold the heart of man is first formed, and that forms all the rest of the
parts; others hold, the Liver is first formed, and performs the same office;
when indeed the one is as true as the other, yet both of them false, for it is
the Microcosmical Sun is first formed in the body; and does all.

Again; some hold the Heart moves the body of man; others hold, the Brain moves
the Body and Heart also; a third holds, it is a force of the vital Blood in
the Arteries: But if you let Reason be Judge, and that will quickly tell you,
that if it be the Celestial Sun that moves the Macrocosme, it must of
necessity be the Microcosimicall Sun which moves the Microcosme.

11. To conclude, for we hate tediousness; We conceive the influence of the
Heavens to conduce to the procreation of all things here below after this
manner.

1. The Elementary world is the womb of all living creatures, both Minerals,
Animals, and Vegetables; (we desire you once more to take notice, that we never
include Man under the name of Animal, for we hold him to be a more noble
creature, and made for another end and purpose, being an Epitome both of the
Intellectual, Celestial, and Elementary world, and therefore capable of the
knowledge of either) it conceives them, nourishes and cherishes them being
conce^ved.

2. This Womb is always full of matter and useful menstrues, fit for the
forming, increasing, and conserving bodies of all sorts, whether they be
Animals, Minerals, or Vegetables.

3. The Celestial Sun gives a vital Seed, and stirs up all to motion and
action, dries, cherishes, quickens, defends, and preserves what it has
quickened, neither suffers he that which dies, everlastingly to dye, nor that
which is killed, never to live again.

4. The Moon subministers moisture to perfect and finish all this, and this is
that which is called radical moisture in the body of man, viz. the
Microcosmicall Moon. We confess many have talked and written of radical
moisture, but few understand what it is; this preserves the Elements and
Elementary bodies from the scorching heat which motion causes, and so
temperateth the beams of the Sun, that they may not be extreme, that they may
serve for conservation, and not for destruction.

5. Because the beams of the Celestial Sun and Moon, cannot pass to the
Elementary world, but by a Medium, viz. the Air, that is the reason Animals must
needs breath, and all Vegetables and Minerals have an Aeriall spirit in them.

6. For as this Nature of ours makes use of the Microcosmicall Sun, to cherish,
and quicken, and move the whole body; and of the Microcosmicall Moon, to feed
the body, and all parts of the body, with radical moisture, that so they may
be conserved and not burnt up; so the Celestial Nature quickens and
cherishes things by the Celestial Sun, moystens them by the Moon, and
preserves them by both.

7. Then consider, that as the Microcosmicall Sun and Moon make use of other
parts of the body to assist them in their office, as the ventricles of the
Brain to apprehend, judge, and remember things; the Spleen to help the
retentive faculty, the Liver to make blood, and the Gall to clarify it, being
made; the Testicles, instruments of generation, and seminall vessels for
procreation, etc. So the Macrocosmicall Sun and Moon make use of the five
Planets for the effecting and varying things below, and tempering them diverse
ways, which is performed by their diverse and various motions, else all the
things that are generated in the world, would be of one nature and quality, and
then the World could not subsist, nor Man neither; for he having all qualities
in himself, cannot subsist without any one of them.

Thus much shall suffice to have been spoken in general, concerning what
knowledge of the Celestial world is requisite to a Philosopher that studies
this Art.

We come now to show particularly what the office of the Sun, and Moon, and
five Planets is; and we shall afford each of them a Chapter by it self.
OF THE SUN. CHAP. I.
IT would make a man admire, when he considers how plain the course of Nature
is in all the actions of Nature, which are especially discovered to the Sons of
men in the birth and conception of man himself: What the reason should be of so
many preposterous opinions now conversant in the brains of the Sons of men, we
knowing that Admiration was the daughter of Ignorance, labored in the first
place to find out their ignorance; we knew well enough Nature would make all
men happy, according to that ancient Proverb,

-- Natura beatis
Omnibus esse dedit, si quis cognoverit uti,
She has enough, if men knew how to use it,
To make them happy: Pray do not abuse it.
The most probable cause of the Brain-sicknesses of our age, we shall show you
in the next Book; however, we consulted together which was the best way to
obtain that knowledge which has now been a long time almost lost in the world;
and that we might proceed methodically in this, we propounded two ways to our
selves, whereby we might come to find out the truth; those that account
themselves learned, call the first an Argument a priore, and the second an
Argument a posteriore.

I. We went to School to Nature, to see which way things were made in a
Natural way, and guided being made; and we supposed, that way we might come to
know their Natures, by knowing of what matter, and by what means they were made.

II. We viewed the signatures in things that were made, we searched if that we
might find their Natures thereby; we perceived work enough in this for a man
to busy his head about all the days of his life, and yet learn something
every day.

We have heard of some that will undertake (and they say, perform what they
undertake) to tell a man what his diseases be, by the view of his countenance.
We confess our selves either through want of age, or experience, or something
else, are not able always to do it, yet we really believe it may be done;
because,

1. We have read of a Physician that knew a young Prince was in love with his
Mother in Law, because his pulse always moved swifter when she was in his
presence. It seems all Creatures have their proper beams as the Stars of heaven
have.

2. We have read in Alkindus in his Treatise de Radiis, where he affirms, that
every thing in the Elementary world contains its species in it self; for it is
manifest, that every thing in this world, whether it be a Substance, or whether
it be an Accident, casts out its beams as the Stars do, or else it had not
the figure of the Starry world in it self. The Fire (as it is most manifest)
casts out its beams to a certain distance. The Earth sends out its beams of
cold, of health, and of medicine; and medicines taken into the body, or
outwardly applied to the body, diffuse their beams through the whole body of
him that receives them; and every colored body sends out its beams, by which
it is perceived of what color it is; whence it appears to be an apparent
truth, that every thing which has actual existence in the Elementary world
sends forth its beams, which fill the Elementary world after their own manner;
and every place of this world contains the beams of all things, which are
actually existent in every place; and as every thing differs from another, so
the beams of every thing differ in effect, and nature from the beams of all
other things; by which it comes to pass that the operation of the beams is
diverse in all diverse things.

Much more Alkindus speaks, which for brevity sake we shall omit; yet the truth
of this we conceive can be denyable to no man that does but consider that he
may smell many things when he sees them not; and then we entreat you but
soberly to consider, that if the beams and signatures of Herbs and Plants,
etc. have their significations, must not the beams of the Sun, Moon, and Stars
have much more, seeing they cause the variety and changes of the other, as
Spring and Summer, Autumn and Winter evidently declare.

We have been very long upon generals, yet nothing is tedious which is
rational.

We come now to speak of the Sun particularly, therefore we entreat you to
consider,

1. That the Sun gives vital heat to the whole Universe, to all and every part
of the Creation.

By the Celestial Sun was the Centrall Sun in the Earth kindled, and also the
Microcosmicall Sun in the Body of Man.

2. This Sun by his vital heat quickens moisture, heat and moisture so
quickened is the cause of the generation of all things are bred by heat and
moisture.

3. Though it be true, that radical moisture comes from the Moon, as we shall
clearly prove in the next Chapter; yet it is as true that it comes principally
from her when she receives the full beams of the Sun, as is palpably and
apparently seen not only in all shell-fishes, but also in the marrow both of
men and beasts.

4. For as the Sun when he is up enlightens all the Hemisphere, and this light
departs again when he is down; so our life remains so long as the Celestial
Sun quickens the Microcosmicall Sun; but when either the Celestial Sun fails
in that office, or else the vessel that holds the Microcosmicall Sun is
broken, life departs, and man dies.

5. And this also is very agreeable to reason, that the Celestial Fire should
have some center, from whence it should quicken, cherish, inspire, and move the
Creation; it must have its place where he may keep his Court like a King, that
so the Sons of Wisdom, real Philosophers, such as prefer a dram of
knowledge before the riches of the whole world, may be instructed where to go,
and how, and which way by Art to help Nature in her operations; therefore the
Eternal God, in mere mercy to mankind, fixed its center in the Sun, that so
his creatures which fear him, and hate covetousness, when they want vital
heat to quicken either themselves or their operations, they may know where to
fetch it, if they know but how; and that they may easily know, if they do but
know themselves; it was not for nothing that wise Greek so often exhorted men
to know themselves.

5. We shall be yet a little plainer with you, do but seriously take notice of
the common operations of the Sun, viz. how in Winter he prepares the Earth for
Spring; in Spring, how he prepares it for Summer; in Summer, how he prepares it
for Autumn; and in Autumn, how he prepares it for Winter: Nay, do but note how
dayes-labour prepares a man for night-sleep, and night-sleep for dayes-labour:
Heed but this with the eye of Reason, for plainer then this thou shall never be
taught.

7. Take notice that all operations are perfected by the Sun, not upon a
sudden, but by degrees, and require time and patie ce.

You see the Sun makes it day by degrees, and changes the seasons of the years
by degrees, and that is the the reason all sudden changes are averse to Nature.

8. The Celestial Sun causes the Heliocentricall motion of the Earth, and
all the Planets. The motion of the Earth upon her own Axis, is caused by the
Terrestrial Sun.

9. Both Celestial and Terrestrial Sun join in the generation of things upon
Earth, neither can there be any generation without both.

This will appear clear to you, if you do but consider, that the vital spirit
of all seeds proceeds from the Celestial Sun; but yet they must be set in the
Earth, that so they may take the influence of the Terrestrial Sun, that so
they may grow, and bring forth their increase.

Lastly, the Celestial Sun is in the Creation like a mighty Prince in a
Kingdom, only he is neither tyrannical nor covetous, nor yet will he be
flattered; for as a Prince distributeth offices to people, both great and small
offices, according as their capacity is to perform them; some things he acts
himself, some he permits others to act, and some he commands; he prescribes
one administration to one man, another office to another man, and a third to a
third: Even so does the Sun in the Creation; for,

1. He gives light to the whole Creation.

2. He gives motion to it, whence proceeds that heat which quickens all things.

3. This motion heats and clarifies the Air, from whence men and boasts come to
breath, and therefore the Latins derive Spiritus from spiro.

4. According as this spirit is retent or remiss, vehement or not vehement,
benevolent or malevolent, according to the administration of other Planets, so
is the qualities and appetites of things below, either acute or dull, vehement
or moderate.

5. The truth of this is clearly seen in Vegetables; for Leeks and Onyons are
hot, by the administration of Mars; Lettice and Purslance cold, by the
administration of the Moon; Hemlock, and Henbane stupefying, by the
administration of Saturn.

Heed this well in all your Philosophical operations.

6. As in a Kingdom it lies in the power of a Prince, to redress what wrongs
his Officers or Admistrators commit upon his Subjects; so also in the Universe,
it lies in the power of the Sun to rectify the evil influence of the rest of
the Planets, and he will do it to such Philosophers as know him.

And so much shall suffice to have been spoken concerning the Sun, we shall be
a little briefer in the rest.
OF THE MOON. CHAP. II.
AS concerning the Moon, we desire you to consider,

I. That by her generation is perfected in all things here below, and with out
her nothing can be perfected, no more then a Man could beget a Child without
the help of a Woman; for though the Sun give vital heat to the Creation, yet
this vital heat will consume, and not preserve, were there not radical
moisture; for the Moon adds that moisture to the heat of the Sun, without which
the Sun could generate nothing in the World: So also Philosophers have their
own peculiar Suns and Moons, wherewith they perfect their operations; as also
their Saturns, and their Mercuries.

And here let us give you warning once more, that when Philosophers speak of
their Sun, or their Moon, or their Saturn, or their Mercury, they intend not
the vulgar or common Sun and Moon, but things far different, things which are
in all things, and to be found every where, but no where to be bought for money.

We dare write no plainer, search them out in your selves, there you may
soonest find them.

2. In the Habitable world she answers to the Menstruum of the world, and
concocts it, giving concocted moisture to all Creatures, both Mineral,
Animal, and Vegetable; for as the Sun quickens them, and gives vital heat to
them, so the Moon subministers radical moisture to them.

3. Philosophers know how to fetch radical moisture in their operations from
their own Philosophical Moon, when they can but find her in the
Philosophical Sea, for she is not always to be found there; for though the
tree of the Moon always grow upon the bank, yet is not the fruit at all times
to be gathered.

The Poets laid down this in some places very truly, though very fabulously.
We confess we cannot much blame them in so doing, since God has opened the
eyes of our understanding to conceive of some of the deep mysteries that are
laid down in scripture; for God has laid down his will and meaning in the
Scripture to the Sons of men in deep mysteries, and though most men understand
the Letter, yet few understand the mystery, which is the cause of all those
errors in judgment now amongst us; and of all that fighting both of tongues
and hands, whereby so many men have lost their lives, and yet the truth more
obscured; and the ancient Philosophers couched their truths under Riddles, that
so none might understand them but such to whom God pleased to reveal them,
which are those who live above this present world. So the ancient Poets
delivered excellent truths under fables, of which this of Virgil was one.

Munere quinetiam lanae (si credere dignum est)
Pan Deus Arcadia captam, te Luna, fefellit,
Per nemora alta vocans, nec tu aspernata vocantem.
By help of Wool (if it you will believe)
Pan the Arcadian god, did once deceive,
And caught the Moon; when to her he did cry
Out of the Wood; nor did she once deny.
4. What the operation of the Moon is in the Elementary world (and Philosophers
must make use of their Philosophical Moon in like manner, else they will bring
their Hogs to a fair Market) may be clearly seen, if we look no farther then
the generation of Man, in which thou may see a lively Epitome both of the
operations of the Sun and her.

5. In the generation of all things in the Elementary world, as the Sun gives
heat, so the Moon gives moisture, and that is the reason that the generation and
growth of all things is performed by heat and moisture.

6. The truth of this is more clearly shown no where then in the Conception of
Man; for the seed of both sexes being mixed, the Mother furnishes the
conception with excrementitious blood, called Menstruis, which she receives by
means of what food she eats or drinks; which the Microcosmicall Sun in the
Embryon by his heat compels into a mass, ferments it by concoction, and forms
into the shape of a Man.

7. Just so for all the world the Moon does in the Macrocosme; for by her swift
circulation about the Earth, she receives the virtue of the Sun and the five
Planets, from which like a Mother she gives nourishment and growth to things
below, in the Elementary world.

8. The Earth like a Womb receives the vital heat of the Celestial Sun, and
the radical moisture of the Celestial Moon, which the Centrall Sun in the
bowels of the Earth concocts (as the stomach concocts food) and makes it fit
nourishment for the several Ideas in the Elementary world.

9. Thus are all things in the Elementary world, both Minerals, Animals, and
Vegetables, first formed in the Earth, till at last they live, and being alive,
they grow to perfection, being nourished by the same breasts of the Sun and
Moon. Heed this carefully in all Philosophical preparations; if you do not
forget it in the study of Aurum Potabile, you cannot do amiss.

10. Some Philosophers hold that the Microcosmicall Moon keeps her Court in the
brain of Man, and that we conceive might probably give the first rise of that
foolish opinion of Ar^stotle's, viz. that the brain was cold and moist, and
tempered and allayed the heat of the Heart; whereas there proceeds nothing from
the Brain to the Heart, but only one small Nerve, and the least child in
Anatomy knows well enough that it is not the office of the Nerves to convey
coldness and moisture to the Body.

You see what low principles those which our Dons account famous men, were
guided by, and that they understood the letter, and not the meaning of
Philosophy.

Also, because they held the Microcosmicall Moon kept her Court in the Brain,
that we conceive was the reason why such as are afflicted in the Brain, are
commonly said to be Lunatic.

11. Only take notice of thus much, and so we shall conclude this Chapter.
That seeing the Moon so variously applies, sometimes to this Star, and
sometimes to that, seeing she is always inconstant, always varying; this is
the reason of those inconstancies in all things here below, which the eternal
and only wise God has caused to be, that so his people seeing no constancy in
this world, should look for it in another world hereafter, when this shall be
no more.

And thus much for this Chapter.
CHAP. III. OF SATURN.
THose things which the Vulgar call Elements, are indeed and in truth nothing
less but compounds mightily commixed, and that appears in that they are
convertable the one into another, and are daily changed into one another; he
that knows not how to do that, will never get Aurum Potabile; and according
to the measure of this conversion proceeds all the varieties of things below in
the Elementary world: for the Planets operate upon things below very variously,
of which we come now to speak: And first we begin with Saturn, concerning whom

1 All know what an ill name he has gotten amongst the Sons of men. He is
called an infortune, nay, the greatest of infortunes, malevolent, and a
destroyer of Nature, and what not? If all the rest of the Planets had hired men
to have spoken against him, they could not have given him worse language: yet
as bad as they make of him, Nature can produce nothing in the Elementary world
without his assistance; neither can Philosophers either make Aurum Potabile, or
the Philosophers Stone, without his help.

2 It is confessed he is cold and dry, and therefore inimicall to both the
Luminaries: To the heat of the Sun by his coldness to the moisture of the Moon
by his dryness; but if you please to look a little further, you may see,
especially if you put on your spectacles.

1 There must of necessity be something to counterpoise or balance the heat of
the Sun, and moisture of the Moon, or else there could not possible be any
Generation: All things upon the earth, must needs be as the earth her self is,
Ponderibus librata suis.

2 The composition of the earth it self is made up of contraries, else it
could not be a suitable place for the things in it: And if it be composed by
contraries, it must needs be also maintained by contraries, which could not be,
unless the influence of Saturn, or some other Planet, were contrary to the
influence of the Luminaries.

3 It is impossible that either the heat of the Sun, or moisture of the Moon
could be fixed, if there were not a Planet of a contrary nature to them both:
And he is yet to go to School to Philosophy, that knows not that without
fixation there cannot be Generation.

4 That there may be a harmony in the Creation, that so the Creation may stand
and not fall by a composition of contraries, consider, that there is a simpathy
as well as an antipathy between Saturn and the Luminaries; for he agrees with
the Sun in dryness, and with the Moon incoldnesse.

3 The Nature and disposition of Saturn was a little more wisely and
excellently described by one in the Verses.

Nigra semi facies, tardus gradus, horrida barbar,
Et cani crines, and membra aeffeta senect a:
Ingenio tamen ipse bonus, nec inutile pectus
Consilijs, constansque animi, prudensque futuri.
Black face, slow pace, with hoary beard and hair
Stooping with age, old Saturn does appear,
But yet he wants not a special brain,
Nor constant soul; good counsel does remain
Within his breast, he wisely can presage
What is to happen in the worlds last Age.
4 Saturn chiefly Rules over the Earth by reason of his coldness and dryness,
and therefore he cherishes its qualities, and helps it forward toward
Generation: For,

1 He stops and stays the beams of the Celestial Sun and Moon. You know
Joyners make fast their boards before they can plain them; for nothing can be
wrought upon unless it be fixed, neither can any thing be produced by the
beams of the Sun and Moon in the Elementary world, unless they be fixed.

2 His inimicallnesse to the Sun and Moon by reason of contrariety of
influences, conduces something to the putrefaction of things, and without
putrefaction there can be no Generation, it being an old and true adage,
Corruption unius est Generatio alterius.

3 He stands the world in the same steed that the bones (over which he rules)
do the body of man; for he fixes, setleth, upholdeth, and helps to
maintain all things.

Thus you see that Saturn, as much as they cry out against him for a destroyer
of Nature, yet he is a helper of Nature in all her actions.

5 The Spleen answers to him in the body of man, and so does Lead amongst
Minerals. We have spoken as much as is needful to a Philosopher.

6 Because Omne nimium virtitur in vitium, we will not deny but Saturn has his
vices (and so has Jupiter also, as we shall show in the next Chapter) which
that you may avoid in your Hermeticall works, we shall lay them down here
Physically; any Philosopher may apply so many as are needful Philosophically.

1 He afflicts the body of man with coldness and dryness, stirs up pernicious
humors which have been long bred in the bodies of men, especially of old men:
He stirs up madness, melancholy and pain in the joints, pains and
swellings of the Spleen, Ruptures, Foractures, and Dilocations, Fevers,
Pestilence and Quartane Agues, Drowning and Shipwreck, Toothache, Strangling,
Poisoning and Witchcraft, Impurites in the act of Copulation, Barrenness and
Widowhood, Captivity and Beggary, these proceed from the malignity of the Star:
And if he threaten death in a Nativity, he effects it one of these ways,
according as he is posited or joined with other Stars; and by some of these
means he may (if not prevented) spoil Philosophical preparations.

2 By his cold and dry quality he infects the very mind of man with
Covetousness (and then he may well be called the greatest unfortunate) Envy,
Solitariness, Austerity, Dissimulation, Sadness, Grief, Deceit, and
Sloathfulnesse.

Thus much for Saturn, and also of this Chapter.
CHAP. IV. OF JUPITER.
IT is well known to all that have studied Astrology, the Houses of Saturn are
opposite to the Houses of the Luminaries, but the reason of this few know, viz.
why Capricorn and Aquary are the Houses of Saturn. We shall clear this in the
first place, that so we might make way for that which follows.

1. You may remember we told you in the former Chapter, that Saturn fixes the
influences both of the Sun and Moon, and stops the unbridled motion of their
beams; for though the Sun and Moon be the authors of all Generation, and
growth, in that sense that the father and the mother are Authors of a Child;
yet such is the unequal disposition of man, that unless their beams were
qualified by the other Planets, they would be found to be little better then
venomous, nay, perhaps the strongest poison in the world. We entreat you not to
mistake us, neither the Astrologers whom we honor, think we slander the Sun
and Moon in the least. That is properly poison which is inimicall to a
particular individual. For example, a Toad is poison to a man, yet is it very
good nourishment to a Duck, and a Duck fed with nothing but Toads and water,
proves very good nourishment to a man. If you will not believe this, ask the
next Musician you meet, whether one concord will not sweeten two discords, and
make them harmony.

2 As great a prevarication as there is between a concord and a discord in
Music, is there between Saturn and the Luminaries, therefore the Ancients, not
without cause, place his mansions opposite to the Houses of the Luminaries.

3 We told you before that all things were fixed by coldness and dryness; the
next piece of Ice you see will prove what we say is truth; therefore Capricorn
a cold and dry Sign, is allotted for one of his Mansions.

4 But because there must be putrefaction of the one, before there can be
production of the other, therefore Aquary the other house of Saturn, being hot
and moist, makes them the fitter for putrefaction.

5 Pray to God to open the eyes of your understanding. Hagar could not see the
Well before God opened her eyes: Neither could Elisha's man see the Angels
which compassed him round about. We shall deliver you the whole truth briefly.

6 Saturn in Capricorn, and Aquary, fixes the beams of the Luminaries, Jupiter
in Pisces putrifies them, Mars in Aries calcines them, Venus in Taurus makes
them fruitful, Mercury in Gemini indues them with a spirit; Is it possible an
Astrologer should live half a year, and not give the Moral to this Fable?

7 But we must recall our thoughts to Jupiter, who presently steps in and
begins to putrify what Saturn has fixed, and that is the reason Sagitarius and
Pisces were allotted for his Mansions, because they are contignous to the houses
of Saturn in each side, and they cast Trine to the houses of each Luminary,
whereby they assisting Jupiter, and Jupiter them, a putrefaction cannot choose
but be made, and being made, be turned to a very good use.

8 We care not greatly now if we tell you why Jupiter is called a fortune, he
is a Star hot and moist in quality; or to speak more like Philosophers, his
Radij hot and moist; for one Star is as hot and as cold as another: And because
he agrees with the Sun in heat, and the Moon in moisture

9 Be but pleased to consider that the whole Heavens are divided into two
Semi-circles, the one of which begins at the beginning of Leo, and ends at the
latter end of Capricorn, or beginning of Aquary, which you will, and is called
the Solar semicircle; the other begins at the latter end of Cancer, and makes
a Retrograde motion to the beginning of Aquary, for women use to fall
backwards, and is called the Lunar semicircle.

10. Then do but so much as consider, that in the Solar semicircle, the house
of Saturn is Capricorn, cold, and therefore contrary to the Sun, who quickens
by his heat; but Aquary in the Lunar semicircle is hot, contrary to the
disposition of the Moon; wherefore Saturn stops and fixes both their beams,
and causes them to putrify.

11 We can teach men no better way what the wonderful works of God in the
Creation are, then by bringing them home to their own bodies; and this was the
reason that wise man, whom our Priests call a Heathen, we mean Solon, said, The
first step to knowledge was for a man to know himself. The meat being taken
down into the stomach, Saturn fixes it there, and putrifies it by meditation
of the Spleen, and turns it into such a nasty, loathsome, and venomous quality,
as would turn the strongest stomach to smell to; this loathsome stuff Jupiter
takes and concocts again, and by mediation of the Liver turns it into most
pure blood, which afterward Mars calcines, as we shall show by and by.

12 We told you before that all things were generated by the Sun and Moon, then
which nothing is truer; yet are not the other Planets useless, as we shall
explain a little, because upon this depends the key of the whole work, as in
the body of man; for a plainer and more familiar example cannot be; it is the
Microcosmicall Sun and Moon which beget their like, and cherish it being
begotten; yet they make use of certain vessels to ferment the seed of others
to concoct it, of a third sort to keep it being concocted, and of a fourth to
cast it out, just so for all the world does the Celestial Sun and Moon in
generating things here below, and so must Philosophers also in their
operations, or else they will make nine pences, and when they expect the
harvest of all their pains and care, they will set down and scratch their
heads with a pair of fools nails: We dare presume the way will scarce ever be
taught plainer; when you want any thing in your operation, look for it in your
selves, you may sooner find a thing in the Epitomy, then in the Text.

13 Thus you see that whatsoever rays the Luminaries let fall upon the earth;
after Saturn has fixed and putrified them, Jupiter by his friendly and
temperate beams concocts them, and from being venomous makes them wholesome and
healthful.

14 Indeed Jupiter performs the same office in the M^crocosm, that the sense of
feeling does in the Microcosme, by which sense all the rest of the senses
subsist; and when that leaves any part of the body, the part of the body so
left is dead: Now feeling consists of heat, coldness, dryness, and moisture
equally balanced; and this plainly appears, that it is only access in some of
the first qualities, which are the objects of this sense; you cannot feel the
weight of a feather, because it has no excess in weight; neither if heat and
cold be equally tempered in any subject, are they discerned by feeling; just so
Jupiter by his equal temper, preserves the same harmony in the Creation. This
is enough to a Philosopher.

15 But Jupiter, as great a fortune as they make of him, has his infirmities
also as well as Saturn, and those shrewd ones also, such as will as soon, if
not sooner, spoil your Hermetical operations, as those of Saturn: We shall
give you them in a Physical way, as we did the former ( Nam nobis nudis non
datur venia promere verbis) or at leastwise so many of them as may be applied
to our Philosophical intents.

1 He causes all diseases of the Blood, especially inflammations, as
Pleurisies, Quinseyes, Inflammation of the Lungs, etc. 2 He causes wind in the
body, especially such as proceeds from too much air mixed with the blood. 3. He
causes blastings with lightning, that is the reason the Poets attributed
thunder, and lightning to him. 4 He causes all diseases of heat and moisture. 5
He causes hypocrisy and dissimulation, a couple of bad qualities in a
Philosopher. 6 He causes inordinate lust. 7 By stimulating matters to
Generation before the due time or before they are sufficiently cleansed and
purified, he often produces monstrous conceptions, and as monstrous births,
both in the Microcosm, and in the Macrocosm.
And let this suffice to have spoken of Jupiter.
CHAP. V. OF MARS.
MArs though he be commonly called an infortune, yet if his opperations be
heedfully viewed, you shall find him as helpful to Nature, and by consequence
to all hermetique preparations (of which Aurum potabile is one of the greatest,
neither shall it yield in dignity to any, the Philosophers stone excepted,) as
any of the rest of the planets, and indeed if we should speak the truth, we
must tell you really we do not know that the influence of one planet is more
necessary then the influence of another, but to come home to Mars, who else
would be angry, we desire you to consider.

1 After Saturn has fixed and purified things in Nature, and Jupiter laid the
foundation of their Vegetable growth, Mars comes in and blows the Bellows
hard, that so he may increase the heat, and this does a Philosopher two notable
good turns.

1 It calcines his matter, that so by a second production in may be made better
th^n it was at the first. An Alchymist will tell how much calcined Vitriol is
stronger then crude; and a Sope-boyler can tell you how much calcined Ashes are
stronger then others.

2 It urges on all things to motion, and by Philosophical motion
Philosophical time is found out, even as the time of the day is found out by
the seeming motion of the Sun; This you will confess to be a truth, if you do
but consider, that when you are angry, your thoughts are swifter and quicker by
half, then they are when you are pleased. But to proceed.

2 Mars clarifies that putrefaction which Jupiter causes in his digestion, and
makes all things fluid in the body of man. There is scarce a Physician
breathing, though he be never so great a Dunce, but he knows this well enough,
that the blood in our bodies is clarified and made fluid by Chollor; and if he
do so in the Microcosm, Philosophy will teach any one that knows what it is,
that it must of necessity do the same in the Macrocosm.

3 By his heat he is assistant in distributing vital heat to the Creation, and
urges forward the motion of the rays of the Sun; this we suppose to be the
reason why Astrologers say, He is the Suns Captain General, and why the Sun
is exalted in his house; It is pity Astrologers study Philosophy no more, that
they might the better be able to give a reason for their own Principles.

4 Because he is hot and dry, he is Diametricall opposite to the operation of
the Moon, and therefore he calcines and clarifies the radical moisture both
in the Macrocosm, and in the Microcosm; he also causes it to keep its Center,
that so it may not dissipate it self too much, or in plain terms, exhaust it
self all in seed; nay more then that, that which will seem stranger, it
fortifies radical moisture, by opposing it, for indeed, without opposition the
world could not subsist, because it consists of contrarieties; and therefore
the one must needs strengthen the other, and causes it to make head against
what opposes it; and this need be doubtful to none that ever sat still and
blowed the fire.

5 As all things are bred and generated by heat and moisture, as they are fixed
by coldness and dryness, as we told you before: So in the vegetable
Generation in man, there must needs be some exsuperance or abounding, this Mars
by his heat exhales, and converts into excrements, that so they may be cast out
from the pure.

6 He heats and quickens the powers of the other Planets, and stirs them up to
action; he is amongst the Planets like a Criminal Magistrate in a
Commonwealth, he punishes their slacknesse, and sees they be not idle.

7 We care not greatly if we give a reason why at the first Mars came to be
called an infortune, or at leastwise what we conceive to be the reason, what
is this, Because by his congruity with the Sun he either increases the vital
spirit in quantity, or makes it too hot in quality; a strange position; let us
see if we can make it good. To effect which, consider,

1 That there might be no confusion in those active causes, the first
Principles, because they are contrary the one to the other, and therefore
known Enemies; but that all things may flow from one head, as God is one,
therefore God drew all the force of working, and virtue of begetting into one
narrow round compass, and this is that which we call the Sun.

2 This he placed in the Center of the Creation, that from thence his virtue
might be sent out, spread, and bestowed equally about the world, to make one
general heat, light, life, nature, and cause of all things.

3 God cast in the known four fighting enemies, viz. The Elements, and set
all the rest of the Creation in a restless race too and fro, this way and that
way, that so by their various influences upon contrary qualities, there might
be a continual change of things here below, that so man should Center in
nothing but in God himself, when he sees all other things are subject to
change.

4 After God had done so, he created man after his own Image, and infused a
spirit into him, clothed with a fine windy coat of the cleanest
super-celestial Air, from that place which Philosophers call Ether, if you
will from the third Heavens.

5 In the Generation of man, when our life in the lusting parts thereof, is by
the bellows of thought stirred up and moved to action; it sends forth out of
every part of the body the hot natural spirit, or breath of begetting clothed
with a Garment of seed, which is cut out from the dewy part of our meat, ready
to be turned into our own like, if not already turning.

6 Give us leave here a little by the way, to have one word or two with
Aristotle, who is not ashamed to aver That the seed of man is an excrement,
whereas if it were our business in hand, we could easily prove that it is the
best juice in all our body, and the finest workmanship which is made of all our
food, and that is the reason the immoderate use of Venery weakens Nature so
much. But to proceed.

7 This fine Oil or food of life after it has remained forty days in the
double natural heat of the begetting spirit and the womb, is formed and
fashioned into the shape of a man.

8 Now is radical moisture at its full growth and perfection, and daily
decreases, even to the time of dissolution, for the Child in the womb is put
over by Nature for the rest of its nourishment, to the Menstru's of the mother,
and she can add nothing to the food of life, if she could, a man might live for
ever, she only adds to the increase of the body.

9 As man's body lives by food, so does the spirit also, and consumes the
radical moisture, which is indeed its proper food, and when it has consumed
that, sometimes it consumes the body also, as is evidently seen in Hectique
Fevers.

10 To make this evident by an example; No longer then you add combustible
matter to the fire, no longer will that burn, but goes immediately out, so soon
as that is consumed, even so the fine Aetheriall spirit of man feeds upon that
fine fatness which is indeed its food, and in truth his tie to the body of
man, which is commonly called radical moisture; and when he has consumed it,
away flies he as fast as be came, and leaves his old Host at six and seavens.

11 Then we entreat you to consider, and so we have done, that if the vital
spirit be not great, a little radical moisture will serve the turn, for its
food, and out of the slack working of them, small store of refuse breath and
smoke arises, to make any great need of fresh and open air to cleanse ^^d
feed them, as it appears in Flies, which live all the winter without air; but
if the vital heat be great and lively, great store of radical moisture is
required to feed it.

12 Thus you have the reason, as we conceive, why Mars was at the first
accounted a malignant, because he increases the violence of the vital heat,
and thereby the sooner consumes radical moisture, to which he is inimicall,
and so causes death. But to proceed.

8 Mars has also his faults in all Philosophical preparations, and those not
a few; we shall give them Phisically, as we did the former, and leave every man
to be his own Interpreter; and we shall be pretty large in them, because they
are more subject to Philosophical operations, or at least Philosophical
operations are more subject to them, then to the faults of all the rest of the
Planets, for by his intemperate heat and torrid dryness, he causes many vices
both to the body and mind of man, as also to Hermeticall operation, which you
may easily perceive by what follows.

1 Wars. 2 Brawling. 3 Contention. 4 Violence. 5 Enmity. 6 Disgrace. 7
Banishment. 8 Loss of Virginity. 9 Adultery. 10 Sodomy. 11 Incest. 12
Abortion. 13 Perfidionsnesse. 14 Anger. 15 Rash actions. 16 Breaking of
Vessels. 17 Over heat. 18 Impatience. 19 Thest. 20 Perjury. 21 Wounds. 22
Mutilation. 23 Slaughter. 24 Rapine. 25 Barrenness. 26 Torments. 27 Fevers.
28 Wounds. 29 Ulcers. 30 Burnings. 31 Danger by Fire. Iron. Pride. Prating.
32 Sentence of the Judge. 33 Precipitations. 34 Hurt by four footed Beasts.
If you do but consider, That Mars can operate no otherwise in the Microcosm,
then he does in the Macrocosm, the meaning is easily understood.

CHAP. VI. OF VENUS.
THe chief operation of Mars in the Commonwealth of Nature, is by his heat to
prepare and calcine matter for seed, which Venus comes afterward, which by her
kind moisture makes fruitful; and this is the Moral of those Poetical Fables
of the adultery of Mars and Venus, because they are both so infinite necessary,
both for the making of seed, and Generation of man; for as Mars by his
exceeding heat and dryness tends but little to Generation, but burns rather
than cherishes, calcines rather then quickens, so Venus being cold and moist,
tends not at all to Generation, without the help of Mars; for all Generation is
performed by heat and moisture.

Let us now see a little Philosophically how we can make Mars and Venus agree
in Philosophical preparations, and we will give it you only by a parallel
taken from our own bodies, therefore be pleased to consider,

1 All the quoile and fighting in a man's body which causes him sometimes to be
merry, sometimes sad, sometimes loving, sometimes hating, sometimes joyous,
sometimes grievous, sometimes angry, sometimes pleased, sometimes sick, and
sometimes in health, together with all the other changes in a man's life,
proceeds from the fighting and quarrelling of those four first known enemies
within him, viz. Heat, Coldness, Dryness, and Moisture, and he that knows
how this comes to pass in man, who is a perfect and complete Microcosm, may
easily know how this comes to pass in the world, and what the reason is that
men fall out, and fight, and kill one another; whereas nature teaches men to
love and preserve one another; and he that knows it in the Microcosm, or
Macrocosm, and knows it not in Philosophy, is not like to be taught by us.

2 These four first Principles, or noted Enemies, which you will, which can
never be reconciled if the strength of one of them be never so little greater
then the strength of his fellows, he subdues, digesteth, and turns them into
his own Nature, he eats them up, and is strengthened by them.

3 But if his unlikes and contraries be equal in power with him, and so prove
his matches, then neither devoureth each other, but both stand amazed and
dulled; and this is that they call an equal mixture of the four first
Principles, and by this equal mixture our life and health is maintained.

4 For example; Fire which is very hot, and something dry withal, and water
which is very cold, and moist withal, if both these be in equal power in man's
body, they dull the violence of one another, but neither of both can be lost or
destroyed, but if this water by heat of the fire (it being too strong for it)
be turned into air, then it is partly like the fire, and if it be not friendly
to it, yet at leastwise it is its weaker foe, and so yields to it, and
strengthens the nature of the fire, for all Alchymists know, that the more air
you give the fire, the more fairer it burns; but if this air gets more watery
moisture and coldness, as is clearly seen in misty and foggy weather, it will
easily overcome the fire, and eat him up, and that is the reason foggy weather
makes men cough, by breathing in a moist air.

5 Now the harmony of the world consists by a consent or dulling of the four
first famous Enemies, even as Music is a harmony made by consent of concords,
and discords; for when this harmony between the four first Principles, is in
the least broken, they begin to stir and fight and strive for superiority, till
at last one conquers the rest; this is that which in our bodies we call pain
and disease.

6 At last when one first Principle gets the Lordship and dominion over all the
rest, he turns them all into his own nature, and then the old consent and knot
of life is broken, lost, and spoiled, and still goes downward till man return
to the earth from whence he came.

7 To give you an example of this in a dead man.

1 When the breath is out of the body, the natural fire waxes lukewarm
presently, and in a short time is devoured by air.

2 The air presently waxes thick, cold, and watrish, putrifies, and by
putrefaction breeds a Generation of Vermin, and presently vanishes in a watery
filth.

3 The water waxes dry and heavy, and still dryer and dryer, till it be all
devoured by earth, from whence man set forth at beginning.

We have now showed, and we hope sufficiently too, the Reasons of the opposite
qualities of Venus and Mars, seeing unless they were opposite, and equally
opposite in the acting and generating of things here below, the world could not
multiply. Come we now particularly to show you what the Office of Venus is in
this our Hermeticall medicine.

1. We desire you to take notice, that you here have the reason why Venus,
being a cold planet, should be the A^^hor of g^ne^ation seeing all generation
i^ caused by heat and moistu^^. The heat of Mars fitteth the Elementary world
for her cold and moist influence, that so the second production of things, by
nature might be better then the first.

2. As the Celestial Sun makes use of the heat of Mars to calcine things and
fit^ them for procreation, so the Celestial moon in like manner makes use of
Venus to moisten them, that so they may be fit to generate and that's the
reason the Poets feigned V^nus to be born in the Sea, because the Ancients held
the Centrall or Terrestiall Moon to be there.

3. Considering what an antipathy there is between Mars and Venus, and yet what
a simpathy they hold one with another in generation, you may easily find out
the reason of that simpathy and antipathy of things generated.

4. If you take notice how all things are bettered by a second Generation, and
that so palpably (or else what need a woman boil water and Oat-meale to make
Pottage) what need any man question but that Aurum Potabile, yea and the
Philosophers Stone also is attainable.

5. As there is one sort of heat which cherishes, and another sort or measure
whch burns, so there is one certain measure of moisture also to be observed
both in generating and nourishing; for too much moiture in hermeticall
preparations will spoil all, for Omne nimium vertitur in vitium, this just and
certain meaof moisture, Venus by most held to give to the world, and therefore
she obtained the name of a fortune.

6. But as great a fortune as she is held to be, she may do mischeifs enough,
if not heedfully looked too; for she makes men's bodies very voluptuous,
cowardly, immode^^* much given to women, and always averse to study, unless it
be in such books as are in sheet^.

7* If she must be a fortune because she furthereth Generation, then is Mars a
fortune as well as she; for he adds heat, as well as s^e adds moisture, he
tempers her moisture, as well as she tempers his heat.

8. However, this is true enough, that as Magistrates in a Commonwealth leave
inferior businesses to be acted by their Substitutes, of which they have
diverse in Authority under them; so in matters of procreation, and increase, the
Sun leaves the matter of heat to Mars, and in matter of moisture the Moon
leaves it to Venus. He that is a Philosopher knows well enough how by the Sun
and Moon to rectify the errors or neglects of either Substitute, and can go
boldly to the Sun and Moon at any time for redress, and shall never be ^enyed
Justice.

9 And here by the way you may see in what an equal balance Nature governs
things; and from thence you may sore a little higher, and know what Government
is best pleasing to the God of Nature: If Kings and Magistrates would Govern
so, what gallant lives might men live upon Earth? But the contrary appearing,
bids the Sons of wisdom expect and hope for Heaven, where all shall be
amended.

To proceed.

10 As the Sun gives vital heat to the Creation, which stirs up to action in
Generation, and the Moon moistens the rays of the Sun, least he should burn
rather then comfort; end again the Sun heats the rays of the Moon, least they
should conjeale rather then moisten: Just so for all the world it is betwixt
Mars and Venus, in respect of multiplication; for just as the Sun and Moon
generate, so Mars and Venus multiply, and that Mars and Venus have this
multiplying quality, appears in this, in that their bodies are nearest the
Earth, amongst the other Planets.

And thus much may suffice for this Chapter.
CHAP. VII. OF MERCURY.
WE are now come to treat of Mercury, and having looked up and down for him,
we could not find him, which made us think at first he was run away from us, as
he did from the Alchymist; but after we had made a little more diligent search
after him, we quickly discovered him, and then we found he was every where.

1 We found him in Gold, and then he was ^ure Sol. 2 We found him in Luna, and
there he was pure Silver. 3 We found him in Lead, and then he was pure Saturn.
4 We found him in Jupiter, and then he was pure Tyn, etc.
Whilst we were admiring at his versattill Nature, and how volattill he was,
and yet we had read long ago in the works of many Astrologers, that Mercury
assumed the nature of every Planet he was joined wi^h, or aspected to, and we
understood the letter of it well before, but never the mystical meaning till
now, which made us conceit that many Histories had Philosophical mysteries in
them. But whilst we were deeply considering this, in came a company of
Philosophers, and their business was to seek Mercury, as we did, and because
he was so volattile and unconstant, making fools of such as are fools; but
always obedient to the Sons of wisdom, we resolved to take diligent notice
how they caught him, and what they did with him after they had caught him.

And here we saw most wonderful strange, and mysterious things, such as it is
not lawful to speak plainly, at leastwise till such times as plain
dealingcomes again to be in fashion: Yet we shall relate very truly what we
saw, if they seem Riddles, look after the meaning of them, as we did, you have
the same means we had, and if you are no idler in Hermeticall studies th^n we
have been, there is no question but you may as easily catch him as we have done.

But let us return again to the Philosophers whom we saw searching for Mercury.

1 We saw them search for him in the fire, and there they found him and
calcined him with his like, and fixed him, neither did he once offer to fly
away, but followed read^ly, and did* whatsoever they comm^nded him, because
they went to work with him in a natural way.

2 We saw them search after him in the air, and there also they found him, and
mixed him with his like, in equal weight and proportion, there also they fixed
him with ease, and without any relunctancy, and put him in their pockets, and
did what they pleased with him.

3 We see them search for him in the water, and there they found him, and by
mixing him with his like, they fixed ^im with ease and pleasure, and made him
their servant, neither did he once gainsay.

4 We saw some other most wonderful things almost incredible, yet most true.

1 We saw them calcine fire. 1 Into air. 2 Into no air.
2 We say them boil air. 1 Into water. 2 Into no water.

We had also the happiness to s^e how they did this, and how they made Aurum
Potabile when they had done it, but in plainer terms it must not be revealed,
nor upon our credits never will.

We have now showed you what the Nature of Mercury is, amongst the Elements,
and Elementary body, and how Philosophers deal with him: We shall now in a few
words declare to you what he is in the Heavens, and leave you to busy your
brains about the harmony between them, and so we shall conclude this Section.

1 He is changed into so many qualities, as he meets with Stars, yet because
naturally he rules over reason, he makes their influence rational to the Sons
of men, indeed he causes that harmony which is between the motions of the
heavens, and man's body; therefore the Poets called him, The Messenger of the
Gods, and say, that he brought down the will and command of the Gods to the
Sons of men, which if you will construe Philosophically, and without prejudice,
it is no more then thus.

1 The Sun gives vital heat to the Creation. 2 The Moon gives radical
moisture. 3 Saturn fixes this, and putrifies it. 4 Jupiter turns it into
nourishment. 5 Mars calcines it. 6 Venus makes it fruitful. 7 Mercury makes it
rational.
A word or two to prove the last would not do amiss, and in so doing we will
not exceed the dimensions of man's body: Therefore consider,

1 If you cast an eye upon your own bodies, you shall find that Mercury
causes such a penetrating and acute humor, which stirs up the mind of man
to contemplation, and inquiry after the Reasons of things, and this is that
causes that imbred desire of knowledge which is in the Sons of men. And this
appears plainly to be a truth, if we do but consider, that the stronger
Mercury is at the Nativity of any, the more thirsting desire they have after
Knowledge.

2 He stirs up all the spirits to action and motion, which causes those
various fancies in the body of man, the variety of which seeks after the
variety of knowledge of things, and finds them being sought for, the which
Saturn fixes, being found, and that is the reason Astrologers say Saturn and
Mercury are such friends.

3 The Excellencies which Mercury bestows upon the World we have showed:

We shall only speak a word or two of what inconveniences he brings to the
body of man, and if you can find them readily in the Epitomy, you may easily
find them in the Book.

1 In the body he causes Madness, Doting,


And all Diseases of the brain, which disturb reason, all diseases of mind. In
the body Coughs, Falling Sickness, Appoplexy etc.


2 To the mind he gives Folly, Lying, Unsettlednesse, Unfaithfullnesse, Evil
thoughts,


And as bad actions; from whence many times arise many Calamities.

So much for the Second Section.
SECT. III. OF THE INTELLECTUAL OR, AETHERIALL WORLD.
WE told you in the beginning, That God had Created a Threefold world,
Elementary, Celestial, and Intellectual, which last is the highest in dignity,
and thrice happy is he that attaines to the right knowledge of it. This he
whoever intends to attain the Divine Mysteries in Philosophy, must not be
ignorent of; for,

1 Of these three worlds every inferior is Governed by its superior, and
receives all its power and virtue from the influence and rays thereof; for God
the great first being, and chief worker of all things, governs the Celestial
world by the Intellectual or Aetheriall: The Stars keep their constancy in
motion by the mediation of the Angels; and he governs the Elementary world by
the Celestial Elementary bodies, whether vegetable, animal, or mineral, are
governed by the Stars. One summer and no more winters, are sufficient to
testify the truth of it.

2 Consider, that the virtue and knowledge of all Elementary things comes to us
from God by degrees, by many and equal steps which we suppose God did in mercy
to man, that so by the same progression we might climb up to the knowledge both
of our God, and our selves; for the virtue of all things comes from God to the
Angels, from the Angels to the Stars, from the Stars to the Elements, and
Elementary bodies.

3 The ready way for man to climb up to the top of this knowledge, is by the
same steps and degrees this knowledge comes down unto us, beginning at the
lower end of the ladder, viz. the Elements, and climbing up by steps to the
top, viz. the Intellectual or Aetheriall world: But withal have a care one
foot be fast before you remove the other; we mean, take heed of building upon
rotten foundations, believe nothing because we or others write it, but examine
it first, whether it be possible in nature or not, if not, there is some
mystical meaning in it, search that out diligently. And now you see the reason
of this our method.

4 As there is a unity in God, so is there one en^ire unity also in every one
of these three worlds; for as in Divinity, all points are tried by a Trinity in
unity, and a unity in Trinity, in a Divine way, (we confess we are mistaken,
we should have written, they should be tried, indeed they are tried by general
Counsels and Synods, and Committees for Plundered Ministers, the more is the
pity.) So in Philosophy, all things are tried by a Trinity in unity, and a
unity in Trinity in a natural way: The unities in the three worlds are these.

1 In the Intellectual or Aetheriall world, is on supreme intelligence, the
very Ani^^a mu^d^, the first Creature and fountain^ of all ^ines, Michael the
Arch-Agel, whose name in the Scripture has so often p^^zled our dull-headed
Priests.

2 In the Ce^estiall world there is one Sun, the Author of Generation and
preservations in the Elementary world, the giver of life, light, and motion to
the Creation.

3 In the Elementary world there is one Philosophers Stone, the instrument of
all Natural virtues, having the quintescence of the virtues of all Elementary
bodies compacted in it self.

5 There are three Arts to find out these three unities, their mysteries, and
divisions.

1 Natural Philosophy. 2 Astrology. 3 Divinity.
1 The Natural Philosopher seeks after the virtues of the Elementary world,
and the various mixtures of natural things, enquires into their causes,
effects, times, places, fashions, events, the whole, and every part of the
whole, and how they are produced by the Elements.

2 The Astrologer is well versed in every part of Natural Philosophy, and from
thence searches out the motions and course of the Celestial bodies, and what
their effects of their influence is upon the Elements, and Elementary body.

3 Then comes the Divine, or at leastwise he should come, and from both the
former Arts, being admirably skilled in them both, teaches what God is, what
the Spirit and Soul of man is (for the one of them is Aetheriall, and above
the Celestial world,) what an Angel is, and what Religion is, and how a man
should glorify God in all.

6 The last of these is our present Task in this SECTION, in which, that we may
be methodicall, be pleased to Consider, That before you attain to the Heavenly
Knowledge of making Aurum Potabile, here are belonging to this Intellectual or
Aetheriall world.

1 Some things to be known. 2 Some things to be practiced.
Of both which, so much as is necessary for these our present occasisions, we
shall lay down, and aford each of them a Chapter by it self.
CHAP. I. OF Intellectual or Aetheriall Knowledge.
THat God does some things extraordinary, over now in this declining Age of the
world, is a truth so manifest, that we suppose no Clergi-man now living, be he
Episcopal, Presbyterian, or Independent, we suppose will once offer to deny:
As also, that God out of grace and love to those that fear him, bestows many
influences or beams of Heavenly knowledge upon such, more then upon others;
which made a great Philosopher say, The Judgments of the Lord are a great
depth, yea, I have infinitely admired at Divine providence, in my greatest
misfortunes; for I always had the protection of our great Creator at hand, and
the Angel of the Lord of this Treasury have been always my keeper. And a
little after he says, So great blessings have I received from the most high
God our Creator, that it is impossible not only for my pen, but also for my
mind to comprehend. God scarce ever conferred to any mortal man greater things
then he has done upon me. And a little after that, he says, Thou that
desire to attain this Art, in the first place put thy whole trust in God thy
Creator, for it is a vain thing to trust in Princes, they are but men, seek
God by prayer, and then assuredly believe that he will not forsake thee; for
when God knows that thy heart is sincere, and thy whole trust is put in him,
he will by one means or another, show thee a way, and assist thee in it, that
thou shall obtain thy desire. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
wisdom. And truly this we can say by experience, that had it not been for
Divine providence in instructing us in a special way, but in what manner we
know not, we had never attained to it our selves: We wish that we had so much
wisdom and affection, that we could render due thanks to him.

This is sufficient to prove that there is an Aetheriall or Intellectual
knowledge requisite to such as intend the study of this deep Mystery. We are
not writing Divinity, as we told you, but Philosophy, therefore expect not that
we should teach you what God is, nor of what materials the body of Angel
consists, etc. we shall only meddle with Divinity so far forth as it is of
necessity to be known and acknowledged of such as intend the study of Aurum
Potabile, in which studies thou must diligently weigh:

1 That there is one God, a unity in the Godhead, and a Trinity in that unity;
for in the right knowledge of this depends all the knowledge of the Saints,
both in this world or that to come. This is the key of all knowledge, which
alone must let thee in to the secret Chambers of wisdom and knowledge here,
and eternal glory hereafter. We confess we have heard much talk, both in
Pulpits and out of them, of a Trinity, but all the real knowledge we had of
it, we had it from God himself: Yet in this let us give you a Caution or two,
if it be three, it makes no great matter.

1 Take heed of making Riddles of the Trinity, in thinking of it some strange
and unheard of thing that never was known nor never can be; for if thou art a
Saint thou art united to the father by the person of the Son, and the Spirit
dwells within thee; therefore God who is goodness it self, will not deny
thee the knowledge of himself; For this is eternal life, to know him the only
true God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent; and the way how to come by this
knowledge, thou have, Jam. 1.5. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God
that gives to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.

2 Do not make non sense of the Trinity, by conceiting the Trinity to be 3
several persons, as we are, as the Papists do, who feigned God to be an old
man sitting in Heaven, with long arms that can reach all about the world, and
Jesus Christ a little boy sitting at his right hand, and the Holy Ghost a Dove
sitting between them. It is very like Athanasius was of this opinion, when he
made that non sensicall thing which he called his Creed.

3 Above (...) ^^^^s beware you deny not a Trin^^^ (...) ^^^y, and a unity in
Trinity, (...) ^verthrowes the foundations of (...) ^sophical operations wh^^
(...) if every herb consist of (...) and Mercury, and you be (...), is not
there an Embie^^ (...) ^^inity in unity? And before (...) ^ow how to join and
separate these, you can never attain the making of Aurum Potabile.

This was delivered by a gallant Philosopher, who wro^^^^ like himself, in
these terms, There is one God, of this one God the Son is begotten, one
produces two, two have produced one Holy Spirit, proceeding from both; thus
was the world made, and so shall be the end of it. This is the first Principle
in Divinity thou must not be ignorant of.

2 Although the true understanding of the first Chapter of Genesis be the radix
and groundwork of all the knowledge in the world, and the deep mysteries of it
understood by few, if by any, yet something of it must be known by him who
intends the effecting of this Medicine: We desire of God to direct us in this
so hard a task, that we may wright with such discretion, those men which can
use it, and are worthy of it, may see the truth, and the rest may be blinded.
The wisest way we can direct you in, is this, Compare what we wright, with what
the Spirit of God did indite in that first Chapter of Genesis, and see how they
agree.

The first beginning of all things which the Scripture tells you, was without
form, and void, which Authors call Chaos, or confusion, was a Divine work of
the Trinity, performed in a most wonderful and unconceiveable manner, before
there was any such thing as Nature created, the distribution of this into this
present glorious form in which now it is, was acted by the Spirit of God in
such a way as we conceive God has in no wise hid from the Children of men,
neither is it out of their capacity, as the former was, therefore we conceive

1 In the beginning the only great and wise God exalted the Quintessence or
purity out of the Chaos, and having circled it round made it the outmost bounds
of all things: This being pure, can endure no impurity, and therefore keeps all
impure things within it self, and in its proper bounds; this is that
Aristotle, as we suppose, and from him our Divines call Calum Empyreum, which
they say is the seat of the blessed souls, if a man were so mad as to believe
them. It is a strange thing men of that Coat should say Aristotle was a
Heathen, and yet teach such notions for pure Divinity.

We shall only relate one story which one of us heard from a Priests mouth in
a Pulpit, who taking occasion to speak of the Imperial Heavens, affirmed, That
they were square, and therefore he said a square form was the exactest. We
wonder how he came by that notion, considering a round form is the first in
forms. Is the Preaching of such notions the way to convert souls? Or does it
deserve Tithes think you?

2 But to proced. After this, God lifted up the purest substance of fire (for
one fire is purer then another, as we shall show by and by) above all things,
and placed it next unto the pure quintessence, above described.

3 God kindled a fire in the midst of the Chaos, in the very Center of it, and
this is that we commonly call the Sun, which distilled up those most pure
waters which were next to the former pure fire described; this we conceive to
be that which is commonly called the Christalline Heavens; for the true meaning
of ancient Philosophers being not understood, and Aristotle must do something to
get him a name, having all the studies of Philosophers, so far as the Conquest
of Alexander the Tyrant extended, delivered to him, and he reading as much in
an hour, as would cost a wise man two year to understand, invented this name
of Christalline Heavens, which is now quoted as a piece of Divinity.

4 The dry Land began now to appear, and because there is always an
inimicalnesse in contraries, each first Principle retired close to it self,
from thence, as also from the influence of the Sun, were the Centrall fires
kindled in the worlds. We hope we may use the name worlds in the Plural number
without offense, because the Scripture does it, as may appear if you read, Heb.
1.2. and 11.3.

5 Because the most pure fire has obtained the uppermost part in the
Firmament, the most pure waters are condensed and made thick under it, and that
they may be strongly settled and fixed there, there is a Celestial fire more
corrupt then the former, which was Aetheriall exalted, which keeps them from
falling down, so that they are shut up betwixt two fires and the Heavens.

6 The Centrall fire in the worlds never cease working, but is still
distilling water into air, which because it cannot exceed its bounds, is
turned again into water, and this is that which causes rain, so that there is a
perpetual circulation in the Elementary world.

Thus you see

1 The fire preserves the Earth that it be not drowned nor dissolved by
continual flux of water upon it. 2 The air preserves the fire that it be not
extinguished. 3 The water preserves the Earth that it be not burnt.
We shall only propound two things more, and so conclude this second point of
Aetherial Knowledge.

1 Give us leave to answer one frollick of Van-Helmont, who goes about to prove
vacuity in the air, which if there were, all the waters upon earth would have
been distilled and resolved into air; but the sphere of the air is full, and
always filled with the distilling of water by the Centrall fire, which when it
is over-burdened returns back again upon the earth by rain, so that the rest
of the waters being kept down by the air, are rolled about the earth. This is
a wonderful mystery we should not leave you ignorant of, for

1 The Centrall fire in the Earth is always kept vigorous by a universal
motion. 2 Being thus kindled always warmes the waters. 3 The waters being
warmed are resolved into air. 4 The air compresseth and keeps down the
residue of the waters, and also the Earth; so that according to reason, it is
impossible that the earth, as heavy a body as it is, should move out of its
place. And thus is the world maintained in a natural way, by the infinite
power and wisdom of an Almighty God.
2 The second thing we thought good to give you notice of, is this, That from
the way and manner of the first distribution of the Elements, and according to
that example all Philosophical distillations whatsoever have been invented.
What we have written is that which gave being to their Rules.

And let this suffice for the second Point.

3 The knowledge of that imbred corruption which is in man, as also the cause
of it, ought to be known. The first cause of it is manifestly Original sin,
whereby the whole bodies of men are depraved, but not their souls and spirits,
as we shall plainly show in the next Book. It Is not our present task to declare
what the first sin of Eve was, it was something else far different from eating
Apples, 'twas such a thing as must of necessity according to the Rules of
Nature corrupt her, her husband, and all her posterity.

4 The restitution of man, and his being united to the Godhead, by the person
of Jesus Christ, who took part both of God and man, must not be forgotten, for
thereby is man brought into an Estate far above the Angels. God has made the
Angels ministering spirits to the Saints, and there is no man will deny but the
Master is above the Servant; hold fast this as an Article of Faith, and this
will beget hope, yea, such a hope as will never make thee ashamed: Such a hope
as will arm thee with patience in all thy operations, according to that
Scripture, 1 Thessalonians. 1.3. And patience of hope in the Lord Jesus Christ.

And let this suffice for this Chapter.
CHAP. II. What Points in Divinity must be Practiced by such as intend the
attainment of Aurum Potabile.
1 THe heart must be unwedded from this present world, from the things of the
earth whatsoever they be, the beauty, glory, pomp, profit, pleasure, and honor
of this world, from whatsoever tends not to, and ends not in the great first
being of all things; The Scripture seems to speak so much, Ro^t. 12.2. Be not
conformed to this world, bu^ ^he transformed in the renewing of your ^^^d that
you may prove what is that good that acceptable and perfect will of God. Were
we writing Divinity, we could easily given paraphrase upon the Text. This we
conceive to be the reason why Philosophers of old shun the very baits of, and
intisements to riches: One of which, if Histories be true, having a large sum
of money given him, gave it all away, receiving only so much to be paid him
again workly as would buy him food and r^yment. Another took his money and
threw it in the Sea, saying, Be gone you filthy riches, for unless you perish,
I should: And Dingenes preferred his T^o before Alexanders Court.

Let us not be mistaken herein, we do not say Riches are a sin; we know a
competent estate is necessary, but we know as well that riches when they exceed
a competency are a snare, yea, perhaps the greatest snare in the world; for as
far as the Heavens are above the Earth, so far is the knowledge of A^^um from a
covetous man. Though our Treatise be not concerning Divinity, yet give us leave
to give you a few admonitions concerning this particular: We know not but that
in your reading of them the Lord may speak to your hearts.

1 Do not account Riches the greatest things, neither let them take up the
best and choicest of thy thoughts. When Solomon was put to his choice what he
would desire, he desired knowledge, and not Riches, God gave it him, and Riches
to boot, and he is the same God still.

2 There is a mighty uncertainty in Riches, but there is none at all in
Knowledge. Look upon this Nation at this present, and you may see the truth of
it through a pair of spectacles glassed with an inch board.

3 It Is the foolishest thing in the world for a man to spend the strength of an
immortal spirit in gathering earth together, it transformes a man into a
Hog, as the Poets say, Cerse did Ulysses his Companions.

One of us heard lately of a Lady that had a vast Estate that was so besotted
with folly, that she would get up into the Coach box, and drive the Horses, and
the Coachman rode in the Coach: This was a madness you will say, yet is the
madness as far greater, and surpasses it as much as eternal life does this,
for a man whom God has united unto himself to make himself a slave to the
world.

4 Thou bestows that upon the world which is ten thousand times more worth
then the whole world is; if thy endeavors which thou spendest upon the world
had been rightly employed, they would have carried thee through the Heavens,
yea, above the Heavens, and taught thee what the Trinity in Unity, and Unity in
Trinity is, thou might have reached even to Eternity it self, and the great
first being of all things.

5 Did you never hear that God sent Jesus Christ to dye for man, and unite him
to the Godhead, then certainly man was made for something else then to mind
the earth* and eat, and drink, and grow rich, this might have been purchased
for him at a cheaper rate by odds.

6 That Riches is sufficient for any man that will carry him but through this
world with comfort; a man that goes a journey, carries no more* with him then
is sufficient for his journey. A godly Minister, who in his lifetime Preached
near London, brings a pretty Simile to this purpose, If you should see a man,
says he, that is going a journey, carry a great bundle of staves upon his
shoulder, and if you should ask him. why he did so, he should tell you, he did
not know but he might have need enough of them before he came to his journeyes
end, for he could not walk without a staff, when one staff would serve his
turn very well, would it not seem ridiculous in your eyes? A little will serve
your turn to carry you to Heaven, all the rest is superfluous and burdensome,
and when you dye you must lay it down, and leave it, you know not to whom,
nor, as Solomon says, whether they will be wise men, or fools. It Is a common
Proverb, Nature is content with little, it is Appetite which is like the
daughter of the Horse-leach and does nothing else but cry Give, Give.

7 God has promised to take care for those that trust in him. Cast your care
upon him, and he will ease you of the burden, he cloatheth the Lillies, and
feeds the Sparrowes: Are not two Sparrowes sold for a farthing, yet not one of
them falls to the ground without your father. If God take care for Sparrowes,
one of which is worth but half a farthing, will he not much more take care of
the Saints? We shall conclude this first practical admonition with that
Scripture, and desire you often to meditate upon it, Col. 3.1, 2. If ye be
risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteeh on
the right hand of God: Set your affections on things above, and not on things
on earth.

2 Labor to have Communion with the God of Heaven. It Is easier done to have
communion with the God of Heaven, then it is to speak with the Committee, for
it will cost no bribes.

Plutarch reports, that Anaxagoras a Philosopher, who was a despiser of riches,
being demanded wherefore he lived, he said, He was borne to contemplate the
Heavens, and saw such a beauty in heavenly knowledge, which he thought
sufficient for the whole man. We can easily describe to you what a Philosopher
ought to be that intends these studies, He ought to be guided by heavenly
Principles in all his ways, to love and fear God above all: God is all in all
to them, and all their study is to know the wonderful works of God in the Book
of the Scripture, and Book of the Creatures, to admire at his glory and
excellency, and to do good to their Neighbors for Gods sake. These be the
Principles that move them to work, and not to grow great and rich in this
world. In short, they are guided by heavenly and not by earthly Principles, and
this is the cause that

1 They have fellowship with the God of heaven. 2 God communicates his secrets
to them.
Give us leave to enlarge our selves a little upon this, and but a little.

1 This brings much joy to a man, indeed it is the joyfullest life in the
world, we know it by experience; they that have their conversations in heaven,
know they are risen from the earth with Christ.

2 All the changes and chances in this world move them not; they can be as
comfortable and as joyful in the loss of all, as in the enjoyment of it. The
reproaches and scandalls of the men of this world, which are but the Embrions
of the idle brains of time, are great comforts to them, they esteem of them as
badges of their Christianity, because they are so used as Christ and his
Apostles were at his birth.

3 The joys of Heaven are always present before their eyes, so that they fear
not death.

It was a most excellent speech of a Philosopher, and a great one in his time,
Believe me, says he, if I were not a man of that rank and condition as I am,
nothing would be more pleasant to me then a solitary life, or with Diogenes to
lie hid under a Tub, for I see all things to be but vanity, and that deceit and
covetousness are altogether in use, where all things are to be bought and
sold, and that vice does excel virtue; I see the better things of the life to
come, before mine eyes, and rejoice in these. And now I wonder not, as before I
did, why Philosophers have not cared to have their days shortened, because
every Philosopher has a life to come so clearly set before his eyes, as thy
face is in a glass. And so give us leave to conclude this second point, with
this sacred and Divine speech of a noble Lord now deceased, whose name we are
forbidden in his writings to manifest.

3 There remains but one more, and that is this, Labor to be contented in
your present conditions. Discontent makes a good condition bad, content makes a
bad condition good. Do not only seem to be contented, but be so really; be
not so by constraint, but willingly; and give us leave to tell you

1 There is an emptiness in the Creature, yea, such an emptiness as is
incapable to satisfy the better part of man, neither is it any way suitable to
it. The spirit of man is Aetheriall, and the soul of man Celestial, and this
world Elementary, therefore that part of this world which satisfies a man, must
first be brought by Philosophical Art to a Celestial, and then to an
Etheriall constitution, before it can satisfy the better part of man.

I have read of one covetous Prince who employed all his subjects in digging up
Gold Mines, insomuch that he left not sufficient to till the earth; on a time
when he went to dinner, his wife furnished his table all with gold, the poor
man being hungry calls for victuals, his wife told him she had no other
Victuals but gold, and withal, if he did not suffer his subjects to till the
earth, he must in a very short time either eat gold or starve. Also a godly
Minister, now dead, upon the same occasion, brings this Simely, Suppose a man
is hungry, and to satisfy his craving stomach, should gape with his mouth to
take in air, and think he is not satisfied because he has not air enough,
when indeed the reason is because it is not suitable to his stomach; and yet as
suitable as the things of this world are to the soul or spirit of man.

2 This content must of necessity make things worse, but it is impossible it
should make them one jot better. If a Master of a Ship when he is at Sea in a
storm, should walk up and down in a discontented mood, fretting, and fuming,
and scratching his head, and not give order to regulate the Ship, were not his
danger much greater? And so truly it is with discontented people, they make the
matter worse, but cannot make it better.

3 The whole world is governed by vicissitude and change of times; there is a
winter as well as a summer; a night as well as a day in the Creation, why
therefore should not we expect adversity, as well as prosperity?

'Twas an excellent speech of a Philosopher; says he, If thou would subject
all things to thy self, first subject thy self to reason. And Theodotius who
once had been a King, and afterward dispossessed of his Kingdom, and living
in a mean estate, one asked him what he had gotten by all his Philosophy which
he had gotten, seeing he could not keep his Kingdom by it, I have gotten this,
says he, I can live as contentedly without my Kingdom, as with it.

4 Take but a little notice what a base thing discontent is, how dishonorable
it is to a man, much more to a Saint.

Plutarch mentions a certain people, who to manifest their disdain they bore
to such as were dejected in spirit, for outward losses, they forced them to go
in a certain time in women's Apparel, in token of disdain, because they have
so unmanned themselves to be discontented.

5 Discontent makes a man more like an Antic, then like a man: Look but upon a
discontented soul the next time you see him, and you shall see what a
behavior, what an unseemly carriage, insomuch that they are burdensome to our
best friends.

6 And lastly, It is a great hinderance to the enjoyment of Gods mercies, of
which we account this we treat of, none of the least. You will not give your
Children any thing whilst they cry, neither will God you.

It was an excellent speech of a Minister now living, The Spirit of God, says
he, never rests upon an angry, or a discontented soul.

And thus much for this Second Book.
THE Conclusion.
YOU have, Courteous Reader, heard a Discourse of the three Worlds, and four
Elements, and that to no other end then to let you know, You must be seen in
them before you undertake so sublime a business in hand: To let you know that
particulars are included under the universalls.

That in and to the Process of the Aur: Potabile is required a serious
contemplative and active spirit.

And to let you know, though not so much what is, yet what is not to be used,
but shunned and avoided.

In the process of which, truly we wish you Happy Arrival too.

And to let you know, That it is a Universal Work that is begun when ever you
begin it, and a work whose attainment lies in the way to a higher scrutiny,
and further proceedings.

It is not every precipitating corisive thing that will do it; not every thing
that reduces the Philosophers living gold to a soluble substance: Not a
destructive fire, but such a fire as Pontanus describes, though in our
Judgments his Description of the fire is the most Enigmatically described of
any Philosopher that writes. Such a radical Humidity and Menstrum must be had
whereof Gold had its Original: I mean in respect of Tincture, not of Basis,
which received but of Tincture which were given by Natures Administrator.

But here some may object, and say,

That You tell us no more then what Ancient Philosophers have long ago wrote,
so that we are no nearer then we were.

To which we Answer, That though at the first sight we do not, therefore for a
help to that, we use not so many Riddles and Aenigma's in the whole, as many
others have done.

Besides, let us tell you, that he whoever it is that once attaines the right
Process, can write no otherwise then others have done before him, unless it
may be in some one word or two; for which cause Philosophers sayings are
diligently and seriously to be enquired into, and in that word or two a
diligent mind may attain the whole process.

We confess it is an old saying, That better is the good the more common it
is.

To which we Answer, That if this Jewel fall into such hands, by that means of
community as may and will do hurt, but cannot do good, the Question is
already answered.

For the greatest blessings ever turn the greatest curses, if not well and
warily used.

To conclude, We have not much to say, but only to crave every man's gentle
acceptance of what we have said, and more especially what we shall now say, We
exhort every one that has a Philosophical faith (and no other man) to read
the writings of Philosophers, and measure them all according to Natures
universal and general course of Creation, Preservation, Destruction, and
Restitution of things Natural; and not to trust one word of their sayings
unless he can find some fundamental Maxim of Nature to second it. Let him
have a pure contemplative mind, and trust in the Eternal Essence of all
things, and take this one thing along, and that is worth all that has been yet
said, That unless the Art be revealed him by a friend, he shall not attain it
by that manner of Knowledge and Reason with which he first began the study.

But this is not to dehort any man from its study, but to him that truly
understands it is the greatest of all Comforts and Encouragements; for while by
his contemplation and earnest study he finds himself to be below, and unable,
and unworthy of what he seeks: Behold the Angel of this Treasury of God
Eternal reveals it.

Gentle Reader,

This is but a Theory, but know well that it must be gained before the Praxis,
which will shortly be discovered, with many other things needful and useful
to the wise, to the foolish a snare; yea, such things as may reduce all labor
to an end: This is no Prophecy.

FINIS.
