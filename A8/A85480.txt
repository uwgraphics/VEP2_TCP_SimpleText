THE COURT OF THE GENTILES: OR A Discourse touching the Original of HUMAN
LITERATURE, both Philologie and Philosophy, from the SCRIPTURES, and JEWISH
CHURCH In order to a Demonstration, OF 1. The Perfection of Gods Word, and
Church Light. 2. The Imperfection of Natures Light, and mischief of Vain
Philosophy. 3. The right Use of Human Learning, and especially sound
Philosophy.

Antiquior omnibus Veritas, ni fallor: and hoc mihi proficit Antiquitas
praestructa Divinae Literaturae, quo facile credam, Thesaurum eam fuisse
posteriori cuique Sapientiae. Et si non onus jam voluminis temperare^, etia^
excurrerem in hanc quoque probationem. Quis Poetarum, quis Sophistarum, qui non
omnino de Prophetarum Font potaverit? Inde igitur Philosophi sitim ingenii sui
rigaverunt; ut quae de nostris habent, ea nos comparent illis.

READER.
IF thy curiosity leads thee to make Inquisition into the original Motives,
Grounds, and Occasions of this following Discourse; Know, that some rude Idea
or the first lines thereof were drawn many years since, in the Authors
Academick Studies and Employments. For meeting with some brief hints and
intimations, in Grotius and others, touching the Traduction of Human Arts and
Sciences from the Scriptures, and Jewish Church; he conceived this Notion, if
made good, might prove, as very choice, so no less useful and advantageous,
for the confirming the Authority of the Scriptures, and so by consequence the
Christian Religion. This put the Author upon farther Inquiry into the
certainty of this Position: and after several years contemplations of, and
researches about it, he found a general concurrence of the Learned, both
Philologists and Divines, of this and the former Age, endeavoring to promote
this Hypothesis. Thus Steuchus Eugubinus, Ludovicus Vives, with other learned
Papists of the former Age; as also Julius and Joseph Scaliger, Serranus,
Vossius, Sandford, Heinsius, Bochart, Seldom, Jackson, Hammond, Usher, Preston,
Owen, Stillingfleet, with others among the Protestants, have given very good
Demonstration, and confirmation of this Assertion. Yea we find not only those
of the latter Ages, but also many of the Ancients, especially such as engaged
in the vindication of the Jewish and Christian Religion, against the Gentile
Philosophers, abounding much in this Argument; namely, that the wisest of the
Heathens stole their choicest Notions and Contemplations, both Philologick, and
Philosophic, as well Natural and Moral as Divine, from the sacred Oracles. So
Josephus against Appion, Origin against Celsus, Clemens Alexandrinus, in the
first book of his Strom. Eusebius, in his Praepar. Evang. Tertullian, Austin,
De Civit. Dei, Johannes Grammaticus, de Creat. Mundi, with others, as is shown
in the Body of this Discourse.

Having collected such evident notices of the truth of this Assertion, from so
many concurrent Testimonies of the Learned, both modern and Ancient; the
Author essaied what Artificial Demonstration might be procured, for the
strengthening this Argument, In order hereto he read Plato, (the chief of those,
who are supposed to transport Jewish Traditions into Greece) and that with what
diligence he might, to find out what traces and footsteps were to be discovered
in his works, of Jewish, and sacred Dogmes. What progress he has made herein,
will appear partly in this, but more fully ((...)) in the following Discourse
of Philosophy.

Moreover, to furnish himself with yet fuller evidence and convictive
Arguments, touching the verity of this Hypothesis, he made it his business to
inquire into, the Travels and Lives of the wiser Heathens, especially the
Grecians; hereby, if it might be, to find out some Tracks of their
Correspondences, and Conversation with the Jews. Wherein, I think, it is
manifest, he has gained great advantages for the Advance of his Design. For
(not to mention Sanchoniathon and Mochus, those great Phenician Sophists, who,
as it is very likely, had immediate and frequent Conversation with the Jews; nor
yet the Egyptian Priests, who seem to have been instructed at first by Joseph,
who founded and endowed a College for them, as some conceive from Genesis 47.22.
etc.) it appears evident, by the best Records we have of those times, that
several of the first Poets, Sophists, and Philosophers of Greece, traveled
into Egypt and Phenicia; and made a considerable abode there, at those very
times when the Jews, in great multitudes, frequented those parts. That Orpheus,
Linus, Homer, and Hesiod were in Egypt, or Phenicia, is proved in the account
of Pagan Poesy, its Original, etc.

That Solon was in Egypt, and instructed in the great pieces of Mythologie or
Jewish Traditions, by an Egyptian (if not a Jewish) Priest, is also proved out
of Plato, once and again. That Thales also was in Egypt, and there informed
himself touching the Creation of the World, the Chaos, and other Physiologick
Contemplations; which he transported with him into Greece, and traduced,
originally if not immediately, from the sacred Oracles lodged in the Jewish
Church, the Author has endeavored to demonstrate in the account, of his
Philosophy. Farther, that Pherecydes (Pithagoras's Master) was, though a Syran
by birth, yet of Syrian or Phenician extract, and well instructed in the
Phenician and Jewish Dogmes, may be conjectured from the Heliotrope, which he
is supposed to have invented, and that in Imitation of Ahaz's Dial; as also
from his, (...), Theogonie or Generation of the Gods, conformable to that of
Sanchoniathon; which had evidently its original from Jewish Persons, and Names;
as in what follows of the Pagan (...). That Pythagoras had much conversation
and correspondence with the Jews, both in Egypt, where he is said to have spent
twenty years, as also in Babylon, where he lived ten years with them, the
Author has endeavored to render very probable, both by the story of his life,
as also from the Idea of his Schole, Dogmes, Symbols, and Institutes, and their
parallel with those in the Jewish Church; as it will appear in the Story of
his Philosophy. He has likewise endeavored, to demonstrate the same of Plato;
who is reported to have lived fourteen years with the Jews in Egypt, and we
need no way doubt, derived the choicest of his contemplations, both
Physiologick and Theologick, originally if not immediately, from the Jewish
Church and sacred Oracles; as hereafter in his Philosophy. The Author has also
examined the other Sects, and traced their first Institutors up even unto the
Jewish Church; at least endeavored to evince, that their chief Dogmes were
originally of Jewish and sacred extract.

From so great a Concurrence and Combination of Evidences, both Artificial and
Inartificial, we take it for granted, that the main conclusion will appear more
than conjectural, to any judicious Reader. In maximis minimum est maximum.
Or suppose we arrive only to some moral certainty or strong probability,
touching the verity of the Assertion; yet this may not be neglected: for the
least Apex of truth, in matters of great moment, is not a little to be valued.
Besides, we may expect no greater certainty touching any subject, than its
Ground or Foundation will afford; according to that of Aristotle, Arist. Eth.
lib. 1. cap. 3.
(...), it is the part of a Student, to require subtilitie or exactnes in every
kind, so far as the matter will bear it: for it is all one, to require
Rhetoric or Eloquence of a Mathematician, whose office it is to demonstrate,
as to require Mathematick Demonstration of a Rhetorician, whose business is to
orate and persuade. Thus also Judicious Chillingworth: Chillingw. Preface to
the Relig. etc.
As he is an unreasonable Master, who requires a stronger Assent to his
Conclusion, than his Arguments deserve; so, I conceive him a froward and
undisciplined Scholar, who desires stronger Arguments for a Conclusion, than
the matter will bare. Now the matter of this Discourse is not Logic, but
Philologick; touching the springhead and Derivations of human Arts and
Sciences; wherein we are constrained, now and then, to make use of Annals and
Records of Antiquity, which are not so authentic as could be desired; yea
sometimes, when Memoires fail us, of conjectures, which peradventure are liable
to many exceptions: Wherefore it cannot reasonably be expected, that every
Argument produced should be clothed with Logic or Mathematick Demonstration.
No, it may suffice (which is all the Author presumes or endeavors) that upon
the whole of his Discourse laid together, his Conclusion appears evident or
certain according to moral estimation.

The Design of the following Discourse.
Reader, if thou inquire farther into the Ends, Designs, and Usages of this
Discourse, I shall nakedly lay before thee, what has been chiefly in the
Authors eye, while under the Contemplation and Composition of it.

1. To confirm the Authority of the Scriptures.
1. His main and original design is, to confirm the Authority, and
demonstrate the Perfection of the Sacred Scriptures. For his Position, that the
chief parts of human Literature had their derivation from the sacred Oracles,
being supposed, or proved; what credit and Authority will hence redound to the
same? how much will their Divine Majesty, Perfection, and Precellence beyond
all human books and Records, be enhanced hereby? This made the ancient Jews and
Christians abound so much in this Argument. This also has induced many Modern
Divines, particularly Jackson, Preston, and Stillingfleet to reassume this
Argument, to evince the Authority of the Scriptures. And that which has much
strengthened the Author in this design, was a passage he had from great
Bochart, who (upon the view that he gave him of Stillingfleets Origines Sacrae)
told the Author, that his main design in composing his Geographia Sacra (a
book worth its weight in the purest Gold) was the same; namely to strengthen
the Authority and perfection of the Scriptures

2. To show Christ's favor to his Church.
2. Another great End the Author has in this Discourse, is to demonstrate what
great Marquis of Divine favor, and rich Tokens of his Grace, Christ, the
Mediator, has been pleased to vouchsafe to his poor afflicted Church. And
indeed is it not a great Marque of Honor, that his poor infant Church, so much
despised and persecuted by the Gentile World, should be, not only the Seat of
his own Presence and Worship, but also as the Moon, to reflect some broken
Rays, or imperfect Traditions of that Glorious light she received, from the
Sun of Righteousness, to the Pagan World, which lay wrapped up in night darkness?
What; that the proud Sophists of Greece, esteemed the eye of the World for
human Wisdom, should be fain to come and light their Candles at this sacred
fire, which was lodged in the Jewish Church! That the poor Temple of Jerusalem,
should have a Court for the Gentiles, to which they must be all beholding for
their choicest Wisdom; how great an honor is this for mount Zion the Church of
God!

3. To show the Imperfection of Natures Light.
3. A farther Design the Author has in promoting this Hypothesis is, to beat
down that fond persuasion, which has of late crept in among, and been openly
avowed by many, too great Admirers of Pagan Philosophy, (especially that of
Plato) as if it were all but the Product of Natures Light. Whereas, I take it,
the Author has, or will in what follows, evidently evince, that the choicest
Contemplations of Gentile Philosophy, were but some corrupt Derivations, or at
best but broken Traditions, originally traduced from the Sacred Scriptures, and
Jewish Church.

4. Another great End the Author had under Contemplation, in Composing this
Discourse, was to disabuse the minds of many young Students, prepossessed with
gross, yea in some degree blasphemous Ideas and Nations touching God, his
Names, Attributes, Nature, Operations, etc, sucked in together with those
poisonous Infusions, they derived from Ethnic Poets and Mythologists. The sad
experience hereof made many of the Primitive Christians, as well learned as
others, greatly decrie and declaim against the reading of Pagan books,
especially Poets. Yea Plato himself, in his discourse of Mimetick Poesy, is
very invective against it; demonstrating, how the minds of young Students, by
reading such Romantic or fabulous Stories, of the Gods, and things Divine, are
first abused with false Images, and then adulterated and corrupted with false
Principles; which draw on corrupt practices. Wherefore in the Idea of his
Common Wealth, he gives order, that such Mimetick or fable-coining Poets be
banished, though with respect, from his Common Wealth. For the prevensing or
removing of such corruptions, the Author has endeavored to decipher or
unriddle, the whole Pagan (...), or the Genealogy of the Pagan Gods; as also
other parts of historick Mythologie, touching the first Chaos, the Golden Age,
the several floods under Deucalion, etc, the Giants War, with other pieces of
Mythologie and Pagan Theology, so common among the ancient Poets, and
Historiographers. Hereby we shall come to understand the otiginal Ideas of
those monstrous Fables; as also disabuse our minds from those false Images of
things Divine and human, which are so pleasing to corrupt Nature, and too often
prove a foundation of Atheism.

If thou shall, Reader, farther inquire into the Motives and Reasons, which
have induced the Author of this Discourse, to suffer it to come under public
view; then be pleased to take notice, that he is not so much his own flatterer
as not to be sensible of many imperfections, both as to Matter and Form, which
may render it unfit for any curious eye or palate. Indeed the Author has neither
time nor Capacity, no, nor yet a Will to polish and flourish it so, as to
render it acceptable to every curious Critic. He has always affected, with
that great Master of Wisdom, Padre Paul the Venetian, P. Paul, in his
Introduction to the History of the Council of Trent.
to suit his Form to his Matter, as Nature does; and not his Matter to his
Form, as the Schools are wont to do. This, with other moving Considerations,
has hitherto detained the Author form publishing this Discourse; which was in
the first draught thereof, inttnded for the private Instruction of some persons
of Noble Condition, committed to his Tuition. But that which has now prevailed
upon him, to let it pass a more common View and Censure, besides his general
Ends above specified, is the persuasion of several Judioious, Learned, and
Pious Friends; who conceive it may be some way useful, at least for the
instructing of young Students; which is a main consideration the Author had in
his eye, when he first undertook the Composition thereof.

Farther the consideration that there is nothing of this nature or subject, as
yet extant in English, save an Argument in Preston and Jackson; with several
Improvements and Inlargements in Stillingfleets Origines S. (who yet does not
professedly treat of this Subject, though he has given a great Advance thereto)
yea the Author not meeting with any Latin Discourses, which do professedly and
entirely treat of this Subject, as by him designed and proposed; this makes him
to conceive it worth his while, to make some Essay herein, were it only to
provoke others, who have more Capacity and Time, to engage more deeply in this
Study and Argument.

Yet farther, Reader, before I permit thee to enter on the Body of the
Discourse, I must advertise thee, that this Discourse of Philologie, which is
now first in execution, was last, or at best least, in the Authors first
Intention. For that which he sirst designed was, the Traduction of Pagan
Philosophy from the Jewish Church and Sacred Oracles. So that (...)
Philologie, is but the Product of a second or after Intention. This (...)
because thou will find, in the Body of this Discourse, many Quotations
referring to a following Discourse of Philosophy, composed before this of
Philologie; which may, if the Author sees his way clear, follow in due time.

Argumentum hujus Libri omni Literaturae genere refertissimi.

Aures.
Upon this ELABORATE Work.
1.
IF with attentive eye we look
Upon the six days volumne of the Book,
Where God, and mighty Nature both appear,
Wrote in an Universal Character:
We still shall find in eve'ry part
Space, and dominion left for Art.
Or rather all our Arts are but to know,
How, and from whence was made so great a show,
As in this Scean of life has bin,
Though dark'ned by the vail of Sin:
How from wild Motion, and its matter grew
Number, and Order too:
And did in Artful Figures smoothly fall;
What made this Graceful measured dance of All?
How circling Motion does swift time divide,
And round the flipp'ry Sphere
(Though no Intelligence be conjured there)
The restless Seasons slide?
And by what mighty stroke the earthen Ball did pierce
To the fixed navel of the Universe;
Whilst Stars, and Sun, (who runs the Day,
But walks the year) do never stay:
Where all those Arts, and Men begun,
That over the Earth are run:
And what is the Coast,
That first can boast
Safety to both their Treasures, when
Cities were built for Business, and for Men.
2.
And would we know from whom
Philosophy did come,
With all her handmaid Train
Of Sciences, again
To make the Tree of Knowledge grow,
And unto all her precious fruits bestow:
Whose taste does never from Paradise dethrone,
But would the Universe make one:
Though yet of Knowledge it has bin the fate,
To have a straight, and narrow gate;
Like that of life, which few do enter at.
To find the Sacred pedigree,
To Ancient Hebrews look, and see
How thence this Savior too did spring,
And to mankind Salvation bring
From black Ignorance rushing in,
As the great Shilo did from blacker Sin.
3.
Hail holy Land! thou Canaan made to flow
With milk and honey, and with knowledge too:
As Rivers from their spring, Arts from thee Rise,
Both in perpetual Circulation
Into their Sea their mighty Cistern run,
Whence they refunded are again:
And still to needy places roll their prize.
For Knowledge with the liquid main must glide,
And by an inexhausted Sourse
Must carry on its everlasting Course;
And, with the Sun, both round the Earth still slide.
Some places do their greater Tides adore:
Learning still Sounds, and Shallows knew,
Its Streights, and wide Ocean too:
And oh that it may hear of Rocks no more
(Tempests their rage here giving over)
But allways pay its peaceful Tribute to the shore.
4.
Hail slender-limb'd Mediterranean!
Where ships those floating Isles began
In the worlds infant age
Their watery pilgrimage.
Isls never more Fortunate can be;
Nor can Apollo a more happy Delos see.
Hail Libanus thou sacred Grove!
Whose Trees did Trees of knowledge prove;
For thence it was that skilful Tire,
Whom all with thanks admire,
Her vessels took
To load the neighboring brook,
Fraught with her riches, and her learning too,
Both given more for use, then show.
She thus to foreign Climes at once imparts
Both of her Countries Fruits, and of her Arts.
5.
Phenicia must with Palms no longer crown
Sanchoniathon, falling down,
Like Dagon, to the Ark, who there adores
Diviner stores.
Nor let proud Babylon
Berosus bear so high upon;
His Works were Babel-like Confusion.
Nor Egypt Hermes boast, or Manetho
Her' leventh Learned Plague, the great'st she knew
These Giant Authors, or their pigmie Fry
Can near with Moses vie,
For truth, or for Antiquity;
They all in one long Row like Ciphers stand,
He at their Head the Figure to Command;
They all had signified just naught,
Had he not all their force of wisdom taught.
If holy Cherubs up arise,
And over the Ark their Wings display
Their Reverence to pay
To his ten Words, ten sacred Categories
Let Us never on Heathen Authors feed;
Two Tables he has richlier furnished
And all his, like the volumnes of the sky,
Evince their own Divinity,
Both clear, and constant show
(The clouds are from below)
Both equally dispense
To works and labors All,
Upon this Earthen Ball
Their Heavenly Influence;
But with this Difference;
His more especially impart
To Humane Learning, and to Art.
So moving here
In as much Nobler, as a Narrower Sphere.
6.
Supreme Idea both of Truth and Good?
To God, and Angels kin,
Why should not thou the Universal flood
Escape of Tyrant Sin?
Pity! so chaste a Virgin should be forced to wear
Apparel of an Harlot still,
Turn prostitute against herwill.
In Heathen Temples when she would appear
There Is naught but Scean, and pageant of her there:
They still conceal the Real Saint,
And show some Iezabel in paint;
This still has bin Religions fate,
She always in her veil as Mourning sat;
And like the Ancient Jew,
Whence her Original she drew
Long has her cruel Pharaohs seen,
And long in bondage been.
Where ere she moved,
The whole World her wide Wilderness has proved;
Far worse, then that in which
The holy men their Tents did pitch:
For still she had in sight
Much of their Cloud, but little of their light
7.
The Sun about the aged world
Three thousand years was hurled,
When Greece both young, and weak
Learnt first to speak;
And we can tell,
When she began to spell;
For all her pride, and learned Crew,
We knew her Alpha, and Omega too.
Phenician Cadmus, when he Thebes did raise
('It Is his humilities, or Fortunes praise)
Resolved to set
His Alphabet,
Toward the left began,
And so it always ran;
Leaving to Ancient Hebrews still the Right hand space.
For Reve'rend Age the Place.
And if we scan their letters All,
Some are Rough Guttural,
Some Dentals hissing far,
Some Palatins, and Linguals are,
And Others they are murmuring Labial.
When these with their great train of Vowels move,
Which at the others feet do stand,
Yet them command,
They do so comprehensive prove,
They read each Sound and Note that Nature can
Express by Man.
This Holy Language was for Natures Empire fit,
But Sin and Babel ruined it.
So pure, and of so Universal sense,
God thought it best for Innocence.
Others her Daughters be,
The Reverend Mother she.
Though Tongues, like men, are frail,
And both must fail:
Her Universal Empire to maintain,
She in her Numerous off spring over the World does reign.
8.
Arabia the happy made the World so
Preserving Arts from Overthrow.
Mecha did the great Stagirit admit,
Mahomet Prince of Arms, but him of Wit:
The Saracens and he
Did join in Monarchy.
Long had Philosophy in that great School
Maintained her Intellectual Rule;
Had she not fled from Ruins of the East,
To shelter with the Eagle in the West.
She longer would have lived so near her ancient seat,
Her long consumption there to cure, to get
Her youthful vigor, and her health repair,
By breathing in so sweet an air.
She with the Roman Eagle, as she flew,
Would fain her Age renew,
Be made a Christian too:
But to her, and the Holy Dove
The Eagle did too cruel prove,
Both in the Fright
Fled out of sight,
And neither found an Ark, or Resting place;
So Barbarous was then of things, and Men the Face.
9.
Great Bochart did the Exile trace, never made to stray
(Men's Errors hers increased throughout her way)
The barren wilderness he past,
And Canaan found at last.
His Canaan too methinks does yield
Fruits of a pleasant Field.
But chiefly when this Learned Author's found
The Trees to prune, and cultivate the Ground;
The plenty shed
With Care is gathered,
The Vintage great, so Rich the store,
The Presses sure must needs run ore:
Yet these first Fruits but earnest are of more:
These please our Taste, and sight,
But still increase our Appetite:
Who as on Jordan's Banks now stand
Expecting t'see the other part of the blessed Promised Land.
On the Subject of this Book.
1.
AS Wards, who long suppose
All, that they spend, to be
Their Guardians Liberality,
Not what Inheritance bestows,
Their thanks to others ignorantly pay
For that, which they
At last perceive to be their own,
To their rich Ancestors obliged alone.
So we as vainly thought,
Our selve, to Greece much bound,
For Arts, which we have found,
To be from higher Ages brought;
By their, as well as our Forefathers taught.
2.
Insatiate Greeks! who not content
With the Worlds Continent,
Affect an Intellectual Regiment.
Why should you learned Jews despise,
Of whom you learnt thereto to rise?
And with their Detriment
Promote your Gain?
To brighten your own Glory, theirs distain?
So as we see the Sun
Obscured by his own exhalation:
And vexed water boiling over
(However Sedate before)
Put out that Fire,
By which it did aspire.
Nay you have got the Wile
The Jews to wrong, and the whole World beguile;
While those your Masters you Barbarians style.
Your learned Stagirite
Did Plato's Nipple never so bite;
As your Platonicks those Breasts do,
With purer Milk which freelier flow.
But some to show their skill are proud to hit.
Those Fencers, who first taught them it.
And Knave, and Rogue are Parrats pay
To him, who taught them Language to essay.
3.
Should all you grand Impostors now awake,
Small pleasure you would take,
To see your Country you so dearly prized,
And with stolen Arts so Civilized,
Grown Barbarous again:
Sure such Relapse you would confess a Curse,
For wronging Hebrews thus:
How well might you complain,
The Jewish Doctors you had robbed in vain?
In all your great Designs thus crossed,
And Voyages to Canaan lost:
Since that Arts plundered Golden Fleece
Was or restol'n, or stole away, from Greece.
(4)
Yet should you Greece call learned now,
I would believe you spoke as true.
As when you say 'twas so before,
You sailed from the Phenician Shore:
I should as soon believe it too,
That all even now are Poets there,
As that you Poets were,
Before your Linus had great Moses read,
And Sacred Scripture pillaged.
But though w' allow ye not to be
Those, who invented Poesy;
Yet this you must near be denied,
YOU ARE THE FIRST OF POETS THAT ERE LY'D.

Authors absence from the Press, require thy more candid construction.

Part I. Of Philologie.
Book I. A general account touching the Traduction of Human Literature from the
Scriptures. Particularly of Languages.
Chap. I. The Original of all Arts and Sciences from God.
That there is one first Being God. His infinite perfections and
incomprehensibility. His Understanding, and eternal Ideas, which are the great
Exemplar of all his Creatures. The Divine Wisdom impresseth some created Ideas
on the creature, contained in the Law of Nature, whereby all things are
governed and directed to their respective ends. This Light of Nature, is the
objective Idea or matter of all Arts and Sciences; which are but reflexe Images
of those natural Ideas which God has impressed on things. The Light of Nature
being darkened, God gave a Divine revealed Light, whence Arts sprung.

. 1. That there is a God.
THat there is one, first, eternal, simple, and absolutely necessary Being,
whom we call God, is evidently manifest both by sensible and rational
Demonstration. For were there not a first Being, nothing else could be. We may
as well, or better doubt of our own beings than of Gods. In things Subordinate,
take away the first, and you take away all the rest: as in motions etc. Neither
is it possible to conceive, that a finite, subordinate Being should be
independent, or eternal: infinite Contradictions would attend such a position.
Therefore this Proposition, God is, is the first truth; whence all other truths
flow: and were not this true, nothing else could be true or false, affirmed or
denied. So that Speculative Atheism is not only unnatural, and monstrous; but
very difficult, if not impossible, to be impressed on a human spirit. For though
some have been sufficiently willing, yet have they not been able to raze out
those connate, and essential Ideas of a Deity so deeply stamped on their
natures. See Derodon L'Atheisme convaincu.

. 2. The Infinite perfection of God.
God is the most pure, independent, and perfect Act, comprehending all Divine
perfection, in his nature, without the least composition of matter, or power,
to receive farther degrees of perfection. This Grandeur and sovereign
Perfection of God consists principally in his being the first principle and
last end of all things: from whom all things at first flow as from the
Plenitude of Being: St Cyran lettres chrestiennes.
to whom they again have their refluxe, as rivers to the Ocean. So that every
thing is more or less perfect, as it draws near to God (...), the first beauty
and light; the great Archetype and original Idea of all good; as Plato styles
him, (...). Those Glorious Eminences, and singular excellences of God, are all
comprised in, and drawn from that essential name (...) Exodus 6.3. as being of
himself, Exodus 6.3.
and giving being to all things else out of nothing; and able, when he pleases,
to reduce all things to nothing: which bespeaks him also infinite, eternal, and
immutable in all his perfections. For to make something out of nothing,
requires an active power infinitely high, because the passive power is
infinitely low, or rather none at all. Again, where there are no bounds to the
essence, there can be no bounds to the duration: whence result eternity and
immutability.

: 3. The incomprehensibility of God.
God Being one, pure Act, a simple, infinite Being, cannot be comprehended by a
finite compound capacity; neither can he be truly apprehended but in his own
light and works. Indeed, the knowledge of causes by their effects does
comprehend the best, and most certain part of our Philosophy: Derodon
L'Atheisme convaincu page 4.
how much less then may we presume to contemplate the first cause; the Father
of lights save in his own light, shining in the book of Nature or Divine
Revelation? That our natural understanding suffices not to penetrate the
Divine essence, is evident: because all knowledge supposes some proportion
betwixt the faculty and the object, in order to the reception of its Idea, and
image: but the disproportion 'twixt our natural apprehensions and the Divine
perfection, is infinite. Yet are we not left destitute of all means for the
apprehending the Divine perfections, by way of causality, negation, and
eminence; as he is the first cause of all things, and infinitely distant from
all things caused by him: besides his own immediate revelation by his word.

. 4. God the first intelligent and his Divine essence the first intelligible or
original idea of all things.
God being the first, living, moving, Being and Act, void of all matter, or
passive power, he must of necessity also be the first Intelligent. For every
thing is by so much the more perfect in Knowledge, by how much the more it
partakes of immateriality. In God (who is a pure Act) the intelligent,
intellect, intelligible species, the act of understanding, and the thing
understood are but one and the same. For God understands himself, and all
things without himself, which were, or are, or shall be, or may be, under any
hypothesis; as also the several (...), modes, orders, and respects of all
things among themselves; and that not by species or abstract images received
from the objects, but in the glass of his own Divine Essence; not
successively, but by one intuition, without discourse: and lastly not in time
but in his own eternity. God contemplating himself beholds in his Divine
Essence or sufficience, by an act of simple intelligence, the eternal Archetype
and Ideas of all things possible: as also by an act of vision he contemplates
all things future in his will, their efficient cause: as if we could suppose a
body full of eyes, it should see all things about it in a moment.

. 5. Divine wisdom end Decrees the universal idea or exemplar of all things
made.
God being the first intelligent, and his Divine Essence the universal idea of
all things intelligible; it necessarily follows, that the Divine understanding
and Decrees be the first, great Exemplar or original idea of all things made.
For look, as in every Artificer, who works judiciously, there is an idea
preexisting in his mind, according to which he frames and forms his work: so
with much greater reason must we conceive in God (who produces all things in
the most perfect measure, weight, order, and wisdom) some preexistent Idea, as
the Archetype or original pattern of all things made. Plato in Timaeo.
This is that which Plato (receiving it by Tradition from the Jews) understood
by his Universal Ideas, which he makes to be the (...), the great Exemplar and
image of all singulars. These eternal increated ideas, Plato, in his
Parmenides, and else where, terms the Intelligible, ideal world etc. whence it
is apparent that these original ideas of Divine wisdom are the platform and
measure of all that beauty, light, truth, and wisdom which is lodged in the
creature.

6. Divine Wisdom and Will the effective cause of all that Wisdom and truth
which is brancht forth in the Creation.
Neither are the Divine Decrees, and wisdom only the ideal cause or exemplar,
but also the effective, productive principle of all that wisdom, and truth
which is impressed on the creatures. God being an increated, infinite Sun of
light and wisdom, has shed some rays thereof on all the works of his creation.
This whole Machine has some prints and footsteps of the wisdom and skill of
this great Architect. There is not the most inconsiderable part of this great
Universe, but has some beams of Divine Wisdom shining in it. The world is an
universal Temple, wherein man may contemplate natural images and pictures of
Divine Wisdom and goodness. The Sun, Moon and Stars, yea this dull element of the
earth, furnishes us with some Divine Characters, ideas, and representations of
eternal Wisdom. Notwithstanding the many monstrous defects of Nature, which sin
has brought upon it, there are a great quantity of productions, which give us
almost infinite Marquis of that increated wisdom, whereby they were produced.
But nothing affords more sparkling ideas and images of the Divine Sapience;
than the human soul; especially when it is clothed with those Divine glorious
rays of saving light and wisdom.

. 7. Divine Wisdom shining in the ordering and governing things.
As the Wisdom of God discovers it self in the framing and composing all
things, so likewise in the ordering and governing of all. This is greatly
manifest from the order, harmony, beauty and subordination of things. You see
how the more imperfect subserve the perfect; the inanimate the animate; as the
earth the plant: the animate serves the animal; as the plant is fruitful for
the beast: and the animal the rational creature. Now where there are many
things void of understanding, and yet keeping a regular motion and due
subordination, there must needs be an infinite wisdom that frames, orders, and
disposes these things. Derodon L'Atheism convaincu.
The ordering variety of things to one common end, cannot proceed but from a
Divine Disposition. An established order, and harmony among multiplicity of
things void of understanding, cannot flow from any, but infinite understanding.
The ordering the world is a work of Intelligence: for order being nothing else
but an agreeable disposition of things, according to their dignity and usages;
it is necessary fot the right disposing of them, to compare them together, and
understand their natures, dignity and uses; and then to order them accordingly:
which presupposes a most sovereign intelligence and infinite wisdom.

. 8. Habitual ideas of Divine wisdom stamped on the creature, which we call the
Light of Nature.
This Divine wisdom which beams forth it self thus in the composing and
ordering all things, leaves some created emanations of wisdom and order upon
the things themselves, whereby they are directed and disposed to those ends and
usages, for which they were appointed. This we usually term the Law of Nature
which is (as a statute law) that Ordinance of God, whereby every creature is
governed and guided to its respective end. This Law of Nature, which is deeply
engraven on the natures of things, is but the counterpart, or transcript of
that Eternal Law lodged in the bosom of Divine Wisdom. It Is a created Idea,
objective light, and order stamped on the beings of things, whereby they
resemble and answer unto their Archetype, that increated idea, and are directed
to their several ends answerably thereto. For as God, at his first creation,
produced all things by his fiat, or command, so he continues to govern his
Creatures to their appointed ends by this Ordinance, Rule or Law of Nature
impressed upon their Beings.

. 9. Human Arts and Sciences are reflexe ideas of those objective ideas and
images of Divine Wisdom that lie hid in the Creature.
As this Light of Nature or created Wisdom, which the Father of Lights has
impressed upon the natures of things, is but the reflexe irradiation or shine of
his eternal increated Wisdom; so all human Arts and Sciences, as gathered up
into systems, or inherent in men's minds, are but the reflexe ideas or images of
that objective light, or internal law engraven upon the beings of things. For
all Arts and Sciences (whether active or contemplative) are but general ideas
or notions: and all notions are but (...), pictures and imitations of things:
whence the regular use of all Arts, is to be (...), or (...), images,
manifestations, or notices of things to the glass of our understandings. So
that look as those created ideas of light and wisdom which lie hid in the
creature, (...).
are but the parelius or reflexe image of Divine wisdom, that eternal law, and
original idea of all truth: So all Arts and Sciences are but the image or
likeness of the things they relate unto.

. 10. Human Arts originally beams of Divine Wisdom.
Whence it follows, that all human Arts and Sciences are but beams and
derivations from the Fountain of Lights, created ideas flowing from, and
answering unto that one simple increated eternal idea of Divine wisdom; which
shining forth in things, created, receive several forms, shapes, and
denominations according to their respective natures and Operations: and thence
being gathered up, by the inquisitive mind of man, under certain general rules
and order, they become universal ideas or notions; and pass under the
denomination of Arts and Sciences. So that an Art may be well defined to be an
universal idea or image of that statute Law or order, which the Divine eternal
Wisdom has stamped upon things; whereby he governs them unto those ends, for
which they were appointed.

. 11. The book of Nature being defaced by sin God sends forth a book of Grace.
But now man by reason of his fall being greatly wounded in his Intellectuals;
and thereby disenabled to contemplate that natural Wisdom or objective light,
which shines in the book of Nature; it pleased Divine Wisdom to send forth a
book of Grace, a more resplendent and bright beam of Scripture Divine
Revelation; which as the greater light, irradiates and enlightens the world,
not only in the more sublime mysteries of Salvation, but also in many natural,
historical, moral and civil Truths; which the faint glimmerings of Natures
light, burning so dimly in human understanding, could not discover, without the
assistant rays of this glorious heavenly Revelation.

. 12. Whence Arts and Sciences sprung.
Hence the scope and tendence of this Discourse, is to Demonstrate, that most
of those Arts and Sciences which shone among the Gentile Philologers and
Philosophers, were indeed but Traditional beams o^ Scripture-Revelation. The
wisest of the Heathens were fain to light their candles at the fire of the
Sanctuary; to derive their Knowledge from the Oracles of God, seated in the
Jewish Church; as it will evidently appear by what ensues.

CHAP. II. A general Demonstration of the Traduction of human Literature from
the Scripture, and Jewish Church.
The Traduction of human learning from the Jews proved by the Testimony of
Jews, Christians, and Heathens. Plato's (...), referring to sacred Scriptures.
His (...) a Tradition of the Divine Essence and decrees or ideas. His (...)
from Exodus 3.14. His (...) and (...) from Gen 1.1,2. etc. His (...) of the
worlds beginning. Mythologick Traditions of the first chap: of Genesis. Why
Plato disguised his Jewish Traditions with Fables? How he mentions the Jews
under the names of Phaenicians, Barbarians, Syrians, Chaldeans, Egyptians. The
Testimonies of Modern Critics. Philologie, and Philosophy of Heathens from
the Jewish Church. The proof thereof in an abstract both of Philologie and
Philosophy.

. 1. The original of human Literature from the Scripture and Jewish Church.
THat the greatest part of Human Literature owes its original to the sacred
Scripture, and Jewish Church; is an Assertion which wants not Antiquity, nor
yet Reason for the Demonstration thereof. The ancient Jews and Christians made
much use of this Position, in their Disputes against the Heathens; and
Apologies for their own Religion. Neither are we without evident
acknowledgments and proofs from the Heathen Philosophers themselves, touching
the verity of this Assertion: besides the manifest Demonstration which may be
collected from matter of fact: namely, those evident Characters of Scriptural
or Jewish Tradition, which are to be seen in the several pieces of Pagan
Philologie and Philosophy.

. 2. Jewish Testimonies.
Touching the Traduction of Human Wisdom, and Philosophy from the Scriptures
and Jewish Church, we have first the Testimony of the Jews. Clemens
Alexandrinus Strom: (...) makes mention of Aristobulus a Jew, who affirmed this
of Plato: He followed (says he) our institutes curiously, and diligently
examined the several parts thereof. We find the like affirmation of Aristobulus
in Eusebius Praepar. Evang. lib. 9. c. 6. This Aristobulus lived about 200
years after Plato. He affirms the same also of Pythagoras: who (says he)
translated many things out of our Discipline into the opinions of his own Sect
etc. And Josephus in his Dispute against Appion lib. 1. says positively, that
Pythagoras did not only understand the Jewish Discipline, but also greedily
embraced many things thereinconteined. See Seldom de jure not. Hebr. l. 1. c. 2.

. 3. The Testimony of the fathers.
The Primitive Christians also much insisted upon this Argument, in their
Disputes and Apologies for the Christian Religion. Tertullians own words see in
the in the Title page
Tertullian in his Apology for the Christians (Cap. 45.) speaks thus: Truth is
more ancient then all. and if I am not deceived, the Antiquity of Divine writ
has in this profited me, that I am fully persuaded it was the treasury of all
following Wisdom. Which of the Poets, which of the Sophists, who did not drink
altogether of the Prophets fountain? Thence also the Philosophers quenched
their thirst: so that what they had from our Scriptures, that we receive again
from them. Thus Tertullian. So again, cap. 47. he treats professedly of the
same Argument, and thence proves the Antiquity and Dignity of the Scriptures.
So Tertullian Apol. cap. 18. says: That the Philosopher Menedemus, who was a
great Patron of the Opinion of Divine Providence, admired that which the LXX
related, and was in this point of the same opinion. Thus also Clemens Alexandr:
Strom. 1.5. speaking of Plato, calls him the Hebrew Philosopher: and in several
places, says: that the Grecians stole their chiefest opinions out of the books
of Moses and the Prophets. The like Justin Martyr Apol: 2. affirms of Plato
viz: That he drew many things from the Hebrew fountains; especially his pious
conceptions of God and his Worship. The same is affirmed by Theodoret,
Johannes Grammaticus, Ambros and Augustine de civit. Dei lib 8. cap 11. as
hereafter.

. 4. The Testimony of Philosophers.
But we have a more full, and convictive evidence of this Assertion from the
sayings and writings of the learned Heathens. Hermippus, an ancient, and
diligent Writer of Pythagoras's life, says in express words: Seldom. de J^re
Not. Hebr^. l. 1. c. 2.
that Pythagoras transferred many things out of the Jewish Institutions, into
his own Philosophy. Thence he styles him: (...). The Imitator of the Jewish
Dogmes. Whence Grotius (in his votum page: 124.) says: that according to the
Testimony of Hermippus, Pythagoras lived among the Jews. As for Plato, there
is a common saying of Numenius the Pythagorean: (...): What is Plato but Moses
Atticizing? And that Plato derived hence the best, and choicest part of his
Contemplations touching God, his Nature, and Worship, the Production of the
Universe, the fall etc. will be most evident to any who shall examine his own
words and writings.

. 5. Plato, Edit. Hen. Steph. fol. 85.
Plato in his Phaedo, treating of the Immortality of the Soul, tells us: that we
must search out the strongest and best arguments to prove it, unles any can, by
a more safe and certain way, namely by a more firm conveiance, that is to say
some Divine word or Tradition, transmit it to us. Plato's (...).
His own words are: (...). Nisi quis potest tutiore ac certiore modo firmiore
videlicet vehiculo i:e. Divino quodam verbo traduci atque transmitti Serranus.
Now what this (...), Divine Word, should signify, if not a Divine Tradition,
either Scriptural, or Jewish, I cannot imagine. So, else where, Plato makes the
like mention of an (...) a Knowledge of God by Tradition. Which Plutarch calls
(...), the old faith or Tradition, whereby in all likelihood, they understood
no other than those old scriptural Traditions, their Ancestors, and they
themselves received from the Jews, by the Phaenicians or Egyptians; if not
immediately.

. 6. Plat. Phileb. fol. 17.
This will farther appear, if we consider Plato's own confession, as we find
it, in his Philebus, where he acknowledges: Plato's (...) an old Jewish
Tradition touching the Unity of the Divine Essence and Plurality of Decrees,
persons, or creatures.
That the Knowledge of the one, infinite Being was from the Gods, who did
communicate this Knowledge to us by a certain Prometheus together with a bright
fire: and then he adds: (...) etc. This story of one and many, is a Tradition
which the Ancients who were better, and dwelt nearer the Gods than we,
transmitted to us. This Tradition of (...) One and Many, was a point of great
discourse amongst the Ancients. Platonicae ideae ^rtn^ habuerunt ex Parmenide
cujus magnum principium fuit (...).
It was the great Principle on which Parmenides founded his Divine Ideas,
delivered by Plato in his Parmenides: the sum whereof is this; that All is
One, and Many: One in the Archetype idea God; Many in their individual natures.
It may relate otherwise, to the Unity of the Divine Essence, and the Plurality
of Persons: for the Platonists speak much of (...) a Trinity. Whatever they
meant by it, it seems most certain to me, that this Tradition was originally no
other than some corrupt broken derivation from the Scriptures relation of God.
Which indeed Plato does more then hint, in saying: that they received it from
the Ancients who were better, and nearer the Gods than they themselves. Who
these Ancients were, that lived so near the Gods, if not the Patriarchs, and
ancient Jews, I cannot conceive. These he else where calls, Barbarians,
Phaenicians etc.

. 7. Plato's (...) from Exodus 3.14.
That Plato received his notions of (...), the first Being, which he calls
(...) etc, by some Jewish Tradition from Exodus: 3.14. I am: is sufficiently
evident from the cognation of the notions, as also from the common consent of
the Learned. See August: de civitat. Dei l. 8. c. 11. and Lud. Vives's notes
thereon. Plato's (...) from Gen 1.2.
The like may be said touching Plato's notions of (...), and (...): which seem
all to refer to Gen: 1.1,2. as in its place. But more expressly Plato in his
Timaeus, treating first of the Body of the Universe; Plat. Timaeo. fol. 36.37.
its visible part; he then speaks of its Soul; and concludes: that after the
Father of the Universe had beheld his workmanship, he was delighted therein
etc. answerable to Genesis 1.31. Genesis 1.31. Plat. Tim. fol. 29.
And God saw every thing that he had made etc. and in the same Timaeus,
treating of the beginning of the Universe, he concludes thus. It is equal that
both I that discourse, and you that judge, should remember, that we have but
human nature, and therefore receiving (...), the probable Fable, or Mythologick
Tradition concerning these things, it is meet that we inquire no farther into
them. That this Probable Fable was no other than some Jewish Tradition, is in
self evident, and will be more manifest by what follows. Touching his (...),
the Divine Spirit and Providence of God, which governs the world, he says
expressly, that he received it by Tradition from the Wise men: as hereafter.

. 8. Plato's custom to disguise the Traditions he received from the Jews; and
why?
That this was Plato's usual way (as Pythagoras before him) to wrap up those
Jewish Traditions in Fables and enigmatick Parables, is asserted by Origin
Contra Celsum. lib. 4. where he affirms: that it was Plato's Custom to hide
his choicest opinions under the figure of some Fable; because of the vulgar
sort, lest he should too much displease the fabulous people by making mention
of the Jews, who were so infamous amongst them. Thus much also Plato himself
seems ingenuously to acknowledge in his Epinom; where he says: that what the
Greeks receive from the Barbarians, (meaning the Jews) they put it into a
better form or garb: i.e. they cloth those Jewish Traditions with Greek
Fables and Emblems. Without peradventure, Plato being in Egypt about the same
time the Jews resorted thither, could not but be very inquisitive into their
Opinions; and as it is very probable, receive the most of his sublime and
clearest contemplations of God, the Creation, Fall etc. from them, by some
immediate or mediate Traditions; which he wraps up in enigmatick, parabolick,
metaphorick, and Allegorick notions; thereby to concele their original; for
these Reasons. 1. To avoid the odium he should contract, by making any
Honorable mention of the Jews. Thus Serranus in his Preface to Plato: These
Symbols (says he) Plato drew from the doctrine of the Jews, as all the learned
Ancients of Christians assert; but he industriously abstained from making any
mention of the Jews, because their name was odious among all Nations. 2. Hereby
to gain the more credit to himself, in seeming to be the Author of these
Contemplations, which he borrowed from others. 3. To gratify the itching Humor
of the Grecians; who were so greatly taken with fabulous narrations etc.

. 9. How Plato makes mention of the Jews under other names? as Phaenicians.
Though Plato thus discolored, and disfigured the habit of his Jewish
Traditions, and conceled their original; yet we are not without some evident
notices and discoveries that he owned the Jews under other Names, as the
Authors of them: for.

1. Plato acknowledges that he received the best, and choicest of his Divinity
from the Phaenicians: Plato de Repub. l. 3. fol. 44.
So Plato de Repub. lib. 3. makes mention of a Phaenician Fable touching the
Fraternity of all men made out of the Earth; which relates to Adams formation
out of the Earth, as Serranus on this place: This Fable (says he) is a
footstep of that primitive truth; noting by the name of the Phaenician, the
Jewish Doctrine: and indeed Plato often mentions his (...); which he calls
(...), and were no other than Jewish Traditions. This seems evident by what
Herodotus mentions of the Jews whom he calls Phaenicians: as great Bochart.
Phaleg. lib. 4. c. 34. And learned Hammond on Mat. 15.22. says expressly that
when the Heathens speak of the original of Literature from the Phaenicians they
thereby mean the hebrews see this more fully chap. 4.. 2. hereafter.

2. Again Plato (in his Cratylus) tells us plainly: Plat. Cratyl. fol. 426.
that they [the Grecians] received Letters from the Gods, by certain Barbarians
[(...)] more ancient then themselves. That by these Barbarians, can be meant no
other than the Jews, is most evident from matter of fact: namely the deduction
of the Greek Letters from the Hebrew; as also from the concurring Testimonies
of Justin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, Epiphanius, and Nicephorus; who by
Barbarians under stand the Jews: as Serranus.

3. Egyptians.
Sometimes Plato speaks of the Jews as the Authors of his Traditions, under
the name of Egyptians; because at that time, when Plato was in Egypt, the Jews
resorted thither.

4. Chaldeans, Syrians.
For the same cause he also calls them Syrians, and Chaldeans: because they were
then subjects and slaves under the Chaldeans Empire and Dominion. Xenophon
tells us that Cyrus in his decree for restoring the Jews, calls them Syrians.
See chap. 4.. 2.

. 10. Besides Philosophers, we have the Confessions of Pagan Historians and
Legislators. Srabo lib. 16. fol. 761. Ed. Cas.
Strabo lib. 16. makes honorable mention of Moses in this regard; as also
Diodorus Siculus, who acknowledges Moses to be the first Legislator, from whom
all Laws had their rise: of which in its place. Testimonies from Modern
Critics.
To conclude; we have the universal concurrence of Modern Critics and Learned
men to confirm this Position, touching the Traduction of human Literature from
the Scriptures and Jewish Church. As Ludovicus Vives, Steuchus Eugubinus,
Julius and Joseph Scaliger, Serranus, Heinsius, Seldom, Preston, Parker,
Jackson, Hammond, Cudworth, Stillingfleet, Usher, Bochart, Vossius and Grotius.
The Testimony of Grotius we have on Mat. 24.38. That which the ancient
Philosophers (says he) drew from the Theology of the Phaenicians, and the
Poets from them, the Phaenicians drew from the Hebrews. The like Grotius on
Mat. 8.22. That the dead bury the dead] This also (says he) Pythagoras brought
from the Philosophy of the East. Thus also Hammond on Mat: 15.22. A woman of
Canaan] This woman of Canaan Mark. 7.36. is called a Syro-Phaenician: That
which is said by the Heathens of the original of Letters and Literature by
Cadmus from the Phaenicians confirms the same; by the Phaenicians meaning the
Hebrews: from whom ( according to Clemens's observation that (...)) the
Grecians stole all they had. Also Bochart. Phaleg. lib. 1. cap. 1. speaks
expressly thus: Among the Characters, and Criteria of the heavenly Doctrine,
its Antiquity deservedly has its place; so that from hence much of Dignity and
Authority amongst men is given unto it. Moreover this Antiquity of Doctrine
cannot be better confirmed, than if we teach; that whatsoever was most ancient
amongst the Heathens, the same was fetched or wrested from our Scriptures. As
for example the ancient Fable of Saturn and his three sons dividing the
government of the world amongst themselves, was taken from Noah and his three
sons peopling the Earth. etc. The like Jackson frequently on the Scripture: as
fol. 49, he says: that Poets have borrowed their best stage-attire from the
Glorious Wardrobe of Israel. The same ( fol. 56.) etc. of which hereafter.

Parker de descensu Christi ad inferios lib. 2. 83.
Parker speaks thus: Origin demonstrates that we receive not what we believe of
the holy land from Plato or other Greciaus, but they rather have borrowed from
Moses and other prophets whatever they have translated into their own
commentaries touching this land etc. The other Learned men's Testimonies will
follow in this, and the following Discourse of Philosophy.

. 11. The several parts of Gentile Wisdom from the Jews and Scriptures.
The greatest and best Demonstration of our Position, will arise from matter of
fact; by running through the parts of human Literature; and finding their
Parallel in the Scriptures, or some Jewish Tradition.

Philologie.
As for Philologie, we no way doubt but to demonstrate 1. That all Languages
and Letters had their derivation from the Hebrew. 2. That Pagan Theology, both
Mythick, (which takes in the (...)) and Politic, (which refers to Pagan Rites
and Institutes about Sacrifices etc.) as also their Physic, or Natural
Theology, ( assumed by the Philosophers) had all its rise, and improvement
from some Scriptural, or Jewish Names, Persons, Institutes, Stories, or
Traditions. 3. As for Pagan Poesy, we suppose, there are evident Notices of
its Traduction (and that both as to matter and form) from Divine miraculous
events, sacred Hymns, and Poems lodged in, and traduced from the bosom of the
Jewish Church. 4. The like we endeavor to prove touching Pagan Stories (both
Mythologick and simple) of the Origin of the Universe, the Golden and Iron
Ages, Deucalions flood, the Giants war etc. which are evident, though but
corrupt fragments of sacred Stories. 5. Also it seems very evident that Pagan
Laws had their Traduction from Divine and Jewish Institutes. 6. Besides some
conjectures of Pagan Oratory from sacred will be given.

. 12. Philosophy.
Touching Philosophy, we make no question ((...)) but to give very
considerable Discoveries of its derivation from sacred Oracles, or Jewish
Institutes; and that not only by Inquisition into the several Sects, their
chief Founders, and their Conversations, or Correspondences with the Jews; but
also by an examen of their choicest Dogmes, and Institutes; with their several
Modes of Philosophizing, both Symbolick, and Dialectick: as in like manner by
taking a cursory view of the several parts of their Philosophy; both Physic,
Ethick, Metaphysick, and Mathematick. All which will afford us great, and more
than opinionative Conjectures of their Traduction originally, if not
immediately from the Jewish Church, and sacred Scriptures lodged therein.
Particularly.

Pagan Physics.
1. Pagan Physics, or Natural Philosophy, (at first broached by Sanchoniathon
and Mochus those great Phaenician Physiologists; and afterward transported into
Greece by Thales the Founder of the Ionick Schole, and much improved by Plato
in his Timaeus) seems evidently traduced from the first chapter of Genesis, and
some Physic Contemplations of Job; as it is in part evinced in the following
Discourse, of the History of the Creation, Book 3. chap. 3. but more fully in
Plato's Physics: of which hereafter.

Ethics.
2. As for the Grecian Ethics, or Moral Philosophy (began by Socrates, and
promoted by Plato, and Aristotle, with the Stoics) we have very strong
conjectures, inducing us to believe that it received its first lines, and
conformation from the Mosaic Institutes, David's Psalms, Solomon's Proverbs,
with other sacred precepts.

Metaphysics.
3. Touching Grecian Metaphysics or Natural Theology, (began by Pherecides,
but mostly improved by his Scholar Pythagoras Founder of the Italick Schole,
and Plato Institutor of the old Academie) we have Reason enough to persuade our
selves, that the choicest parts thereof, received their first lineaments, and
configuration from Scripture-Relations or Jewish Traditions of God, Angels, and
the human Soul. Whence had Pythagoras and Plato (who delighted themselves much
in Jewish Mysteries) their Metaphysick Contemplations of (...), and (...),
Being, very Being, and the first Being, but from Gods Description Exodus 3.14. I
am. Hence also Aristotle following his master Plato, (so far as his reason
guided him) makes (...), Ens, i.e. Being the Object of his Metaphysics; and
Unity, Verity, and Bonity, the Affections of this Object; which are all but
corrupt imitations of Scriptural Descriptions of God. The like may be argued of
Pythagoras, and Plato their Metaphysick notions of (...), and (...) etc. of
which in their proper place.

. 13. Mathematics.
4. Touching the Mathematics, we find very considerable conjectures, such as
seem cogent to persuade us, that they received great advantages, as well for
their first Production, as after advance, from the Church of God.

Astronomy.
1. For, not to mention Seth's, and Enoch's skill in Astronomy, which is more
dubious, it is generally concluded among the Learned, that Abraham was well
skilled in Astronomy; and it is maintained by several, that he was the first
that brought Astronomy from Chaldea, into Canaan and Egypt. We need not doubt
but the ancient Patriarchs, Noah and his holy Seed, were much in the
contemplation of those Celestial Bodies, the Sun, Moon, and Stars; and thence
made many great observations, touching their excellent Constitutions, Natures,
Order, Situation, Conjunctions, Aspects, Eclipses, Motions, and admirable
Influences, (which takes in the main of Astronomy) whereby their minds were
elevated and raised up to a spiritual Contemplation, and admiration of their
Creator: albeit the degenenerate seed of Noah, had their hearts hereby enticed
and inveagled into an Idolatrous adoration of those Celestial Bodies.

Geometry.
2. As for Geometry, another part of Mathematics, it is supposed to have had
its rise in Egypt, and that upon occasion of the overflowing of Nilus, which
required a Geometrick Art, for the Division of their lands, when the flood was
over. This being granted, we need not doubt but that Geometry received a good
advance from the Church of God: for of Moses it is said that he was learned in
all the Learning of the Egyptians. Act. 7.22. But I am more apt to persuade my
self, (and that from some conjectures of the Learned) that Geometry received
its first great advance, if not rise, from the Children of Israel's first
Division of the Land of Canaan, which was made by Rules Artificial and
Geometrick, as Joshua 13. etc.

Arithmetic.
3. Somewhat also may be said for Arithmetic, which is supposed to have been
first invented by the Phenicians, in order to their Navigation; but yet, as we
may presume, had a great advance, if not its first original, among the Jews.
Yea it is evident, that the first Arithmetic had its foundation from God
himself: for the first computation of time is made by God. Genesis 1.5. etc.
Besides, we read of no computation more ancient than that of Moses, by Gods
appointment, touching the distribution of Times and Seasons; as the New Moons,
Sabbaths etc.

Navigation.
4. As for Navigation, (another part of Mathematics) though some ascribe it to
the Phenicians, as the first Inventors thereof; yet it seems manifest, that the
first Idea thereof was taken from Noah's Ark appointed by God.

Architecture.
5. The like may be proved of Architecture (which refers also to Mathematics)
that the exact Idea thereof, both among the Greeks and Romans, received its
original from the proportions in Solomon's Temple and other of his Structures,
as Villalpandus in Ezech. Tom. 2. part. 2. l. 5. Disp. 1. c. 13. observes.

Geographie.
6. That Geographie traduced its first lines from the Mosaic Description of
the several Plantations of Noah's posterity, we have proved Book 3. chap. 2.. 7.
of this Discourse.

Music.
7. Lastly that Music had its main Traduction from the Music in the Jewish
Schools and worship is easy to prove.

. 14. The form of Grecian Philosophy originally Jewish.
Lastly, we conceive it not difficult to prove, that not only the matter, but
also much of the form or mode of Grecian Philosophy received its Origination
from the Scriptural and Jewish mode of Discourse and Ratiocination. For 1. May
we not rationally conclude, that the ancient mode of Philosophizing by Symbols,
Allegories, Fables, Enigmes, and Parables (brought into Greece by Pythagoras
and Plato) received its original Idea and Traduction from the Jewish Symbols
Allegogories, Types and Parables? This we doubt not but to prove in its place.
2. As for the more simple mode of philosophizing by Dialogues, or
Interrogations and Answers, (whence Dialectick had its name; which was the main
Logic used in all the Grecian as well as Italian Schools, before Aristotle
brought in the syllogistick form of mode and Figure) it seems exactly
conformable unto, and therefore, as we may presume, received its derivation
from the Scripture, and Jewish mode of Reasoning by Diologues, or
Interrogations and Answers; whereof we have a great quantity of instances, both
in the Old and New Testament; especially in Christ his Disputes with the
Scribes, and Pharisees; which were usually managed and carried on by Questions,
and Answers: as we hereafter prove. Thus Grotius on Mat. 7.6. Chaldaei,
Hebraei, Aegyptii, vetustissimi sapientiae professores, pr^ecepta sua
tradebant, and (...), ut docet Clem: Alexandrinus, Pythagoras hunc morem in
Graeciam attulit, sive ex Aegypto, ubi vixit aliquandiu, sive ex Syria, unde
erat magister ejus Pherecides sed and Judaeos adierat, ut plures de eo
scriptores prodiderunt, etc.
Thus briefly, and in sum, touching the Traduction of human Literature from the
Scriptures and Church of God.

CHAP. III. The Original of the Phenicians from the Cananites.
The Phenicians cognation with the Cananites, and their identity in name.
Phenicians the posterity of Anak. The Anakims their fame for strength and
learning. Josh. 15.15,49. The Phenicians original from those Cananites, which
were expelled Canaan by Joshua; who retreating unto Phenicia, thence sent forth
Colonies into all parts that bordered on the Midland Sea, as Africa, Greece
etc. Thence the Phenicians were styled by the Grecians (...) and Phenicia
(...), and (...) from Canaan; as also (...) from (...) Surim. Why the Cananites
changed their name into Phenicians, Syrians etc. The Phenician Gods the same
with the Idols of Canaan Psalm. 106.37,38. Farther evidence from Antiquity that
the Phenicians were Cananites.

. 1. The original of the Phenicians from the Cananites.
HAving mentioned the Phenicians, as the chiefest instruments by whom the
Jewish Doctrine and Traditions, were conveyed into Greece and other parts; it
will greatly conduce to the confirmation of our Assertion, to treat a little of
the original of the Phenicians; their cognation with the Jews; the advantages
they had to inform themselves more fully touching the Jewish Doctrines; their
Art and skill in imitating and improving the same; as also their opportunities
and industry to convey the same to other Nations. First, touching the original
of the Phenicians; that they were the same with the Cananites, is sufficiently
proved by learned Bochart, Bocharts Phaleg. lib. 4. cap. 34.
whose Arguments seem more then conjectural; being drawn from the Identity of
their Names, Situations, Languages, Institutes, Manners, and Arts. The
Phenicians and Cananites have the same name.
That the Phenicians and Cananites have the same Names promiscuously given
them, is apparent from the LXX, who call the Land of Canaan, the land of the
Phenicians, and the Cananites Phenicians. So the same Shaul is by the LXX
called the Son of a Phenician Exodus 6.15. and the Son of a Cananite Genesis 46.10.
as in the Hebrew. So Exodus 16.35. and Jos. 5.12, That which the Hebrew calls
the Region of Canaan, the LXX interpret the Region of Phenicia, and Phenicians.
So in like manner, she who is called a Cananite Matthew 15.26. is by Mark the
Evangelist (a faithful interpreter of Matthew) called a Syrophenician. Mark.
7.26.

. 2. The Origination of (...) from (...) the sons of Anck.
That the Phenicians were originally Cananites, may be farther evinced from the
Origination of the Name. Touching the Etymology of the Greek (...), Critics
are exceeding various; some deriving it from (...) the abundance of palm trees
that grow there: others from the color of the red sea: So Vessius de Idololatr.
lib. 1. cap. 34. (...) (says he) is the same with (...) red, thence the Latins
from (...) made Puniceus and from (...) Paenus. That the Tyrians came from the
Idumean sea he proves out of Pliny, Solinus, Herodotus, and Procopius. Whence
he concludes, that from the Idumeans Esau's posterity the red sea was styled
erythraeum mare; from whence the Tyrians transplanted thence were styled (...)
Phenicians. Others derive this name from the purple color: others from (...)
slaughter. All these make its original to be purely Greek. But others who have
been more exact in the comparing the Greek with the Hebrew, give it an Hebrew
origination: so Joseph Scaliger derives it from (...): and Fuller from (...):
Chald. (...). Thus Fuller ( Miscel. Sacr. l. 5. cap. 16.) the Tyrians being
delicate Merchants, the ancient Punicks were so styled from (...) chald to live
delicately whence (...) the name of the Phenicians q. d. (...) delicate, as
Glass. Grammat. S. l. 4. tract. 3. observe. 15. But that which carries most of
likely hood in it, and suites best with our design is the Etymology which
Great Bochart gives it, Bocharts Canaan lib. 1. cap. 1.
who derives the Greek word (...) from the Hebrew (...) or (...) the son or
sons of Anak. From this Cananitish name Ben Anak, or contracted Beanak the
Grecians at first formed (...) (it being very usual with them to turn (...)
into (...), as from (...) arrhabo) thence (...) and (...) Phenicia.

. 3. The PhEnicians sons of Anak.
And that these Phenicians were indeed the sons of Anak, according to the
forgoing Etymology, is yet farther evident by their own confessions. For when
a Colonie of them had seated themselves at Carthage, they call it Chadre-Anak
that is in the Hebrew or Cananitish tongue (...) the seat of Anak or the
Anakims, as Plautus in penulo Act. 5. Scena 2. gives it unto us.

Deuteronomy. 9.2. The Anakims their strength and Learning.
These Anakims or sons of Anak, were the most Noble and renowned amongst all
the Cananites. They had two Cities which were the chief seat of their Family;
the one called Hebron, where their main Fortress and strengh for War lay: the
other Debir, the seat of their Learning, which was therefore called
Kirjath-Sepher the City of books and Kirjath Sanna the City of Learning or the
Law. Josh. 15.15,49. The strength of these Anakims was stupendous, Numb. 13.34.
Hence they are usually called Giants: yet they were overcome by Joshua, and
forced to retreat to the Western part of Canaan, thence called Phenicia, and
the country of the Philistines, 1 Chronicles. 20.4. where some relics of them
continued unto the time of David. For Goliath as the Hebrews prove, was an
Anakim. See Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 1.

. 4. That the Phenicians were the posterity of the old Cananites.
A farther proof of this Assertion, that the Phenicians were the posterity of
the old Cananites, may be gathered from the Grecian account and relations. For
though the Greeks make but small and obscure mention of the Cananites, yet were
they not altogether ignorant of the Phenicians original from Canaan. So in
Austin's age the Carthaginians called themselves Cananites. see chap. 5.. 7.
Bochart (in his Phaleg. lib. 4. cap. 34.) gives us a famous place of Eupolemus,
where it is said that from Saturn Belus sprung: and also Canaan, and that this
Canaan begat the Father of the Phenicians: his words are (...). Alexander the
Polyhistorian cites this out of Eupolemus, and out of him Eusebius praepar.
lib. 9. has it also. This is also confirmed by what Eusebius ( praepar. lib.
1.) quotes out of Philo Biblius the interpreter of Sanchoniathon (that most
ancient and famous Phenician Writer) where we find mention of a certain XNA
(...) XHNA, being first styled among the Phenicians XHNA. Now it is very
evident that the name XHNA is but the contract of Canaan. So in Stephanus
Byzantinus (...) Phenicia is called XHNA, and the Phenicians XHNAI. His words
are XNA; (...), and a little after (...). Bochart. l. 4. c. 3.

. 5. Why the Cananites changed their name and were called Phenicians, Syrians,
Assyrians.
If there be required a Reason why these Cananites should change their ancient
name, and assume that of Phenicians, the said Bochart gives us this account
thereof. The Cananites were ashamed of their ancient name by reason of that
curse which was pronounced against their father Canaan; especially when they
saw themselves so fiercely persecuted by the Jews, merely upon this account,
because they were Cananites: Wherefore they chose rather to be called
Phenicians, Syrians, Assyrians, Sidonians, Syrophenicians. The name Syrians was
common to them and their neighboring Nations, coming from (...) Tire the
Metropolis of Phenicia; whence the Inhabitants are called (...) Syrim, thence
(...) Syri, and by praefixing the article Hassyrim i.e. Assyrians, as 1 Chronicles.
22.4. Neh. 13.16. by which name the Phenicians and Tyrians are often called,
though differing much from (...) those Assyrians which came from Ashur and
inhabited beyond Euphrates. Hesychius calls these Phenicians Sidonians etc.
Bochart. Phaleg. l. 4. c. 34.

. 6. The Phenicians and Cananites agreement in Gods.
That these Phenicians were really Cananites; may be farther argued from their
agreement in Customs, Rites, Arts, and Gods. That the Phenicians had the same
kind of Worship, and Gods with the Cananites, is very apparent from Psalm
106.37,38. where v. 37 it is said the Jews sacrificed their sons and daughters
unto Devils: that is, as it is else where interpreted unto Moloch, which was
the chief God of the Phenicians, or Syrians: now in the following verse 38.
These Phenician Gods are styled the Gods of Canaan: and we have sufficient
evidence that these Idols of Canaan were none other, than those that the
Phenicians worshipped as Gods: for Moloch, the Idol of the Ammonites, was the
same with Baal, the Phenicians worshipped. Thence Jer. 7.31. They are said, to
sacrifice their children to Baal. So 2 Kings 23.5. They are called, the
sacrifices of Baal. And indeed, all the Baalim were but Phenician Idols, from
Belus one of their Kings. So Baalzebub was the God of Ekron, a City in
Phenicia; and Baalsemes, Baal peor, the Gods of the Moabites and Mideanites,
were also Phenician Idols. See more of this in Seldom de Diis Syrum, Owen de
ortu Idololat. lib. 5. c. 2. etc.

. 7. The Cananites expelled by Joshua retreat to Phenicia and theace transplant
Colonies into all parts.
Lastly, that the Phenicians were originally Cananites, is manifest from the
Identity of their Languages, (of which hereafter, chap. 11.. 2.) as also from
the most ancient pieces of Antiquity we have. Procopius, in his Vandalicis,
makes mention of certain pillars, erected in Africa, with an Inscription in the
Phenician tongue, which he renders thus (...). Bochart. Chanan. Praef.
We are they who fled from Joshua the son of Naue (i.e. Nun) the Robber. How
ancient this Inscription is, we cannot say; but thus much we may collect, that
those Africans, who were Phenicians originally, reckoned themselves amongst the
Cananites expelled by Joshua. And we have the Testimony of Eusebius (in his
Chronicon fol. 11.) coincident herewith: (...): where they (that is the
Phenicians) fled from the face of the children of Israel, and built Tripolis in
Africa. Neither is it, at all improbable, that these Cananites, who were
expelled by Joshua out of Canaan, should first retreat to Phenicia the West
part of Canaan, which lying on the Midland sea gave them great Advantages to
transport their Supernumerary Colonies into Africa, Greece, and all those
Islands or Territories which bordered on the Midland-sea; and together with
them, to transport all Letters and Learning into those parts, where they came:
as it will appear by what follows.

CHAP. IV. The Correspondence betwixt the Jews and Phenicians.
The mutual Agreement betwixt the Jews and Phenicians. The Jews styled
Phenicians, and Syrians. The Phenician Language, and Letters from the Jews.
Grecian Learning from the Phenicians and Jews; which would have been more
evident by those Ancient Phenician Monuments of Learning, written by
Sanchoniathon and Mochus, which are lost. That which made the Phenicians so
famous for communicating Jewish Traditions, was their Navigation, which at
first Necessity taught them, being furnished with Conveniences. This Art of
Navigation improved their Desire of Gain, Ambition, and Curiosity. Whence their
first Undertakers in Navigation Saturn, Astarte, and Hercules were reputed
Gods. The Grecians learnt Navigation, and Geographie from the Phenicians. The
Ark, the original Idea of Ships.

. 1. The Correspondence betwixt the Jews and Phenicians.
HAving discoursed at large of the Original of the Phenicians, and their
Identity with the Cananites: we now proceed to treat of their Cognation,
Correspondence, and agreement with the Jews; which will not a little conduce to
the confirmation of our first Position.

What advantage Abraham had for the propagating the Knowledge and Worship of
God amongst the Cananites.
The Cananites had no small Advantage to acquaint themselves with the Hebrew
Religion, and Worship, even from Abraham his long abode amongst them; who built
Altars, and places for the public worship of God; and, as we may presume, did
what he could to propagate, and promulgate the knowledge, and worship of the
great God among his Neighbors, and Kindred the Cananites. And that which gave
him a considerable Advantage to promote such a glorious design, was his
Potence, prevalence and Interest amongst the Cananites; which he obtained
partly by his kindnesses toward them, but especially by the Conquest he made
over the Kings of the East Genesis 14. Thus Brentius on Esa. 41.2. gave the
Nations before him etc. God, says he, gave to Abraham this favor, that
wheresoever he came he was formidable to the Nations. This sprang hence that
Abraham erected unto the Lord Altars in the Land of Canaan, and published,
without control, amongst the Nations, the true Doctrine of Religion. Genesis 12.
etc. Thus he. That Abraham was in great veneration amongst the Cananites, and
in following Ages worshipped under the name of Saturn and Israel, is evident
from the account which Sanchoniathon and Porphyry give of Saturn: of which see
what follows Book 2. chap. 1.. 3. of Saturnes parallel with Abraham.

As for the Correspondence 'twixt the Cananites and Jews after their return to
Canaan; it is true, there was at first as well by Divine Constitution, as their
differing Inclinations, Interests, and Rites, a vast distance and feud betwixt
the Jews, and Cananites, or Phenicians. But in process of time, the Israelites
affecting an imitation of their neighbors the Phenicians, especially in point
of Religious Rites, and Idols, the Phenicians also began to incline unto a
Correspondence with them, and an Affectation of their Mysterious Doctrine,
Rites, and Ceremonies. Thus they, by frequent Commerce, and Correspondences,
barter, and exchange commodities each with other. The Jews, they assume the
Name, Customs, and Idolatrous Worship of the Phenicians: and these, the
Mysteries, Rites, Laws, and Traditions of the Jews. This Correspondence betwixt
the Jews, and the Phenicians began early, even in the time of the Judges, as it
is evident by Scripture, as also by the Story of Sanchoniathon, who is
supposed to have lived about the time of Gideon, and to have had conference
with the Priest of the God of Israel, from whom he received the foundation of
his Mythologie, which gave Being and Motion to the Grecian Fables. But yet this
familiar commerce 'twixt these neighbors, came not to its perfection till
Solomon's time; who entered into a near League with the Phenicians, and so gave
them, and their Idolatrous Customs free Admission.

. 2. The Jews styled Phenicians.
That the Jews agreed with the Phenicians in Names, has been already hinted,
and is farther evident, by the Stories of Herodotus, Trogus, and Diodorus
Siculus; who derive the Original of the Phenicians from the Red Sea, which
relates to the coming up of the Israelites out of Egypt, and passing through
the Red Sea. And Herodotus else where under the name of the Phenicians, treats
of the Jews, whence Josephus ( contra Apion. lib. 1.) rightly collects, that
Herodotus writing of certain Phenicians in Palestine, who were circumcised,
means thereby the Jews. For its certain that circumcision was not used by any
Inhabitants of Palestine besides the Jews Genesis 34.14. if we may credit Learned
Bochart. Phal. l. 4. c. 34. The Jews called Syrians.
Hence also were the Jews called Syrians. So Preston on Gods Attributes Sermon.
3. tells us: that when Cyrus did restore the Kingdom of the Jews, Xenophon
reports this, that when he came into Babylon he gave commandment that no Syrian
should be hurt. Now Syria lies upon Judea as one Shire does upon another; so
that they were all called Syrians. Thus their vicinity, and mutual
entercourses, made the Jews pass, under their neighbors names, for
Phenicians, and Syrians etc. So Diodorus l. 5. tells us; that the Syrians first
found out Letters; meaning the Jews: as hereafter.

. 3. The Phenician Language and Letters from the Jewish.
Hence it is apparent, that the Phenicians received their Language and Letters
from the Hebrews. That the Phenician Language was but a Dialect of the Hebrew
is asserted and proved by the most learned of this age. So G. Vossius de
Histor. Graec. lib. 3. cap. 16. Bochart. Phaleg. lib. 1. cap. 15. and in his
Canaan lib. 2. cap. 1. unto the 6. And it is evident by the Punick Language,
which was the same with the Phenician, as well as with the Hebrew; as it
appears by many Fragments of the Punick Tongue, found in Plautus, Augustine etc.
of which in its place. And, as the Phenicians Language, so their Letters also
owe their original to the Hebrew; as it will appear hereafter, chap. 11.. 2.
Which, at present, we only mention, to show the great Affinity, and
Correspondence 'twixt these two Nations: whence it came to pass, that most of
the Grecians Learning, and Letters, which they acknowledge to have been derived
to them by the Phenicians, sprang originally from the Jews: as chap. 11.. 3.

. 4. Grecian Learning from the Phenicians.
As the Phenicians were very emulous of Affinity with the Jews, thereby the
better to inform themselves touching their mysterious Doctrines, Rites, and
Customs; so were they not less Artificial and Industrious, in the improving
and propagating the same. And indeed, had we but those ancient Phenician
Monuments written by the Mythologist Sanchoniathon, Mochus the Physiologist,
and others, it is most likely, that we might therein find the Original of the
Grecian Philologie and Philosophy, as well as many footsteps of Jewish
Traditions, and Antiquity. Learned Bochart in his Preface to his Canaan, says:
That if those ancient Monuments of the Phenicians were yet extant, we should
thence receive a great light, both as to sacred, and profane History; and
that great hiatus or gap betwixt Moses and the Grecians, would be filled up:
and we should learn much touching the ancient Inhabitants of the Earth, and
their Peregrinations etc. I think it will be sufficiently evident, by what
follows, that Pythagoras, Plato, Zeno, and the rest of the Grecian Philosophers
owe their choicest Notions touching God, the Human Soul, the Creation etc. unto
the skill and industry of the Phenicians, and Hebrew Traditions by them, if not
immediately to the Jews.

. 5. The Phenicians the first Inventors of Navigation. Why, and how?
That which made the Phenicians most famous, and gave them the greatest
advantage for the transporting and communicating their Jewish Traditions and
Learning unto other Nations, was their Navigation and Transplantation of
Colonies into other parts. That which at first put them upon this undertaking
was their own Necessity. For the Israelites, under the Conduct of Joshua, being
possessed of almost the whole of Canaan; the whole body of the Cananites
expelled thence, were crowded up in that narrow skirt of Phenicia, which being
too strait for so numerous a people, they were fain to commit themselves to the
Sea, and seek out for some larger habitations. And for such a design, they had
all the advantages that might be. For they had the Midland Sea open to them,
with convenient Ports to set out from and put into. As for Materials for
shipping, they might easily furnish themselves from Libanus: neither wanted
they men, skilful, industrious and courageous; or any thing else requisite for
such an undertaking. Hence, if we may give credit to Tibullus. Prima ratem
ventis credere docta Tyrus.


That the Phenicians were the first, that found out Navigation, and by reason
of their skill, and strength at Sea, for a long time kept a sovereign Dominion
over the Midland Sea, is, not without probability: asserted, and proved by the
Learned Bochart: Can. l. 1. c. 2. Thence Lucian in Toxari, asserts, that there
were none (...) more divine Merchants than the Phenicians: in as much as they
did yearly sail, almost, into all parts of the Midland Sea, as else where,
returning at spring. See more Bochart. Can. l. 1. c. 2. Where he largely proves
this out of Curtius Salust etc. Esa. 23.8.
Thus Esa. 23.8. Tire (the chief City of Phenicia) is styled the Crowning
City, whose Merchants are Princes whose traffiquers are the honorable of the
Earth.

. 6. What moved the Phenicians to improve themselves in this Art of Navigation.
As Necessity was the Phenicians first Master in their Art of Navigation; so in
after times, Curiosity, Gain, Ambition, and Desire of Empire, with other
motives, did greatly provoke them to continue industrious in this their Art,
and Trade; which gave them continued opportunities for the propagating their
Jewish Mysteries and Traditions. Indeed this desire of Navigation found a kind
of natural implantation in these Phenicians, even from their first settlement;
which was much greatned by those inconveniences, they found in their own
Country; their unsatiable desire of riches; their itch of vain glory; their
inquisitive humor, and curiosity, to acquaint themselves with the Customs and
Affairs of other Nations. These, and such like considerations, made them so
famous for Navigation. In so much, that those who first were bold to venture in
such Sea voiages, got so far the Admiration of their Posterity, as that they
obtained, for this their daring exploit, the reputation of Gods. In this number
were Saturn, and Astarte, whom Sanchoniathon describes as such who compassed
the world (by Saturn, if we consider him historically, we may understand Noah,
who by Gods appointment made the Ark, and sailed therein, which gave the
original Idea to all Navigaiton) also Hercules, who having overcome Antaeus, in
the utmost part of Africa, is supposed to have dyed at Gades, whence the story
of Hercules's Pillars Neither was this inclination of Navigation quenched in
Jeroms time, who writing of these Phenicians on Ezech. 27. says, that even
unto this very day there remains in the Syrians an ingenite ardor of
Negotiation; who for gain traverse the whole world. From these Phenicians it
was that the Grecians got their skill in Navigation, as also in Geographie. For
it is manifest that the Phenicians had visited the chiefest parts bordering on
the Midland Sea, long before the Grecians durst look abroad to view foreign
Countries; Bochart Can. Praef.
as learned Bochart observes in his Canaan. The full demonstration whereof will
result from the following chapter.

CHAP. V. Of Phenician Expeditions into Spain, and Africa.
The Phenicians Navigation into Spain and Africa under Hercules. Conjectures,
from Eusebius, that the Phenicians were in Africa about Moses's time. The
Phenicians possessed in Spain, Gadir, Malaca, Audera, and the Baleares. The
several names of Spain, Iberia, Tarshish Ezekiel. 27.12. and Elysian fields of
Phenician, or Hebrew origination. Phenician Colonies in Africa. The name Africa
Phenician from (...). Carthage received its name and people from the
Phenicians. The Carthaginians call themselves* Cananites. Their Magistrates
called Suffetes from (...), the name of the Hebrew Judges. Utica and Tangier
peopled by Phenician Colonies.

. 1. The Phenicians Navigations.
THe Head of our design is to prove the Traduction of human Literature from
the Jewish Church. The Medium we have insisted on, is the Phenicians
Correspndence with the Jews; with their Motives and Advantages for the
transporting Jewish Traditions, and Mysteries into Greece, and other parts. To
strengthen this Medium, we shall endeavor to show, how these Phenicians
transplanted Colonies, or visited, at least, the chiefest places in Europe, and
Africa; especially such as border on the Midland Sea; besides some parts in
Asia: which gave them all the Advantages, that could be expected, to propagate
the Hebrew Language, and Traditions. In which undertaking we shall follow the
learned Bochart ((...)) who in his Geographia Sacra, has given us an
incomparable Demonstration hereof: which he also mentions in his late elaborate
piece, De Animalibus Sacris part 1a. Praef: His words are these: Some years
since, says he, we treated of the first inhabitants of the Earth, chiefly out
of the writings of Moses, who in one chapter of Genesis, has more, and more
certain account of this Argument, than all the Grecian or Roman Monuments, that
are extant. To these we subjoyned the ancient Navigations of the Phenicians,
who, some centuries of years before Jason, and the Argonauts began to diffuse
themselves throughout the whole of the Midland Sea etc.

. 2. The Phenicians expedition under Hercules.
The first great Expedition the Phenicians made, was under Hercules, whom, some
make to be contemporary with Moses, but others upon surer grounds place him in
Joshua's time: so learned Bochart ( Phaleg. lib. 3. cap. 7.) The Phenicians
(says he) sailed, as it is thought, so far as the Gades in Spain, under
Hercules the Tyrian Commander, whom some make contemporary with Moses, but I
rather think 'twas in that age wherein the Jews having possessed Canaan, drove
out the old inhabitants, the Cananites; whereof one part transported themselves
into Baeotia in Greece; the other into Spain and Africa. This truly appears
from the two pillars anciently to be seen at Tangiers with this Phenician
inscription. We are they that fled fom the face of Joshua the Robber, the son
of Naue. As Procopius lib. 2. Vandalicorum. It Is true, the Poets attribute this
Expedition to their Grecian Hercules: but this Fable of theirs, is sufficiently
confuted by the Temple at Gades; wherein Hercules is worshipped according to
the Phenician, not the Grecian Rites. So Appianus in his Ibericis: The Temple
of Hercules, which is at his Pillars, was built, as it seems to me, by the
Phenicians. For he is worshipped at this very day with Phenician Rites. And
their God, is not to them a Theban, but Tyrian. Thence Diodorus writes, that
the Phenicians built this Temple, and in it instituted (...) Splendid
Sacrifices which were administered after the Phenician Rites.

. 3. Conjectures from Eusebius, that Phenicians were in Africa in Moses's time.
This was done, as is supposed, in Joshua's time; yet Bochart in his Preface to
Canaan tells us, that there is more than light suspicion that the Phenicians
sent forth some Colonies into Africa, before Joshua's conquest of Canaan. For
Eusebius, in his Chronicon, to the number 498, which was the 73 year of Moses
life, says (...). So Jerome. Hercules, Surnamed Desanaus, is reputed famous in
Phenicia. Moreover, this Phenician Hercules, firnamed Diodas, or Desanaus seems
to be altogether the same with that first Hercules who at the number 442, is
reported to have overcome Antaeus, in the utmost part of Libya, about Zilis and
Tingis, ^ow called Tangier; for there Anteus reigned. Whence it follows, that
the utmost part of Africa, began to be frequented by the Phenicians 287 years
before Carthage was built.

. 4. Phenicians in Spain. Bochart Phaleg. lib. 3. cap. 7. and Canaan lib. 1.
cap. 34.35.
That the Phenicians, in their first Expedition under Hercules, possessed
themselves of several considerable towns on the Spanish, as well as the
African Shore, Bochart proves at large, both in his Phaleg, and Canaan. Strabo
(says he) adds, that the Phenicians possessed many places of Spain abont
Tartessum, and Turdetania; and built Gadir, and Malaca, and Audera, and New
Carthage; and the Gymnesian Islands being possessed by them, received the name
of the Baleares. That these names are purely Phenician, is evident: For Gadir,
is by Pliny, and Solinus interpreted an hedge. So Hesychius (...). Now the
Hebrew (...) gader, as the Syrian, and Arabian (...) gadir, signifies the same.
So Malaca, in the Phenician or Hebrew (...) Malacha, signifies the town of salt
meats: thence (...). And Audera in the Phenician tongue, (...) Audar a
fortress. As the Inhabitants of the Gymnesian Islands, by the Phenicians were
called Baleares; which Polibius and Stephanus Byzantinus expound, and that
rightly, (...) for Baleares, in the Hebrew (...) Baale harea, signifies, word
for word, masters of projection, he^ skilful in the Art of casting stones. So
Bochart.

. 5. Yea that the very names of Spain it self were of Phenician, or Hebrew
origination, Bochart proves. Bochart Phaleg. lib. 3. cap. 7.
For (...) Spanija, coming from (...) a Conie, signifies the Region of Conies;
The sundry names of Spain of Phenician origination.
by which Epithet, Catullus noted that part of Spain, which is called
Celtiberia; but the Phenicians called the whole Region of Spain by this name,
by reason of the multitude of Conies there. So the name Iberia is in the
Phenician tongue (...) Terms or bounds, because, according to the Phenicians
estimation, the Spaniards possessed the ultimate bounds of the earth: thence
they affixed on Hercules's pillars a ne plus ultra. So in like manner Tarsis,
which is taken for Spain, or that part of it which was called Boetica, is
derived from the Hebrew (...). This part of Spain called Boetica (which takes
in the Gades, now Cades, and Tartessum) was greatly frequented by the Tyrians,
Ezekiel. 27.12.
as we have it Ezekiel. 27.12. Tarshish was thy Merchant by reason of the
multitude of all kind of riches, with Silver, iron, tin, and led. That Spain
abounded with these metals, which attracted the greedy Tyrians into these
parts, and in a short time furnished them with such vast treasures, see Bochart
Phaleg. lib. 3. cap. 7. and in his Canaan lib. 1. cap. 34. In this part of
Spain called Tarsis, and since Baetica, were seated the Elysian fields, so
styled by the Phenicians from (...) to rejoice: thence Virgil calls them laeta
arva. That Lusitaniae is also of a Phenician origination see Bochart Can. l. 1.
c. 35.

. 6. (...) Navigation and Co^ies i^ Africa.
As the Phenicians seated themselves in Spain, especially on the Maritime
Coasts, so likewise in the chiefest parts of Africa opposite thereto. This has
been already in part demonstrated out of Bochart his Phaleg: which he does more
fully prove in his Canaan lib. 1. cap. 34, 35, 36. where he tells us: a that the
very name Africa comes from the Syrian, and Arabian (...) or (...) an ear of
corn; whence the Phenicians called it (...) Africa in the same signification;
neither does the mutation want the like instances: and the country of Africa is
called, (...), a land fertile for ears of corn. The same it signifies in the
Punick phrase: and such indeed is Africa properly so called, i.e. that part of
Lybia which lies next Carthage, as all men know. And touching the Phenicians
Navigation into Africa, nothing is more notorious in Antiquity; nothing more
common in history, than that the Carthaginians were originally Phenicians: the
very names Puni and Paeni import so much. Thus much the Carthaginians made
annual commemoration of, by paying yearly Tithes to the Tyrian Hercules: of
which Tertullian in his Apology, makes mention. And so when Tyrus was besieged
by Alexander, the Tyrians (as Polybius observes) did chiefly confide (...) in
their nephews the Carthaginians. Yea the Grecians affirm, that Cadmus himself;
who was the chief conductor of the Phenician Colonies into Greece, and Founder
of the Theban fortress (which was about Joshua's time also) after many
victories obtained over the Africans, built there several Cities: as Bochart
Can. lib. 1. cap. 24.

. 7. Carthage built and peopled by Phenicians.
That Carthage was built, and peopled by a Phenician Colonie, is universally
acknowledged: and the very name imports so much. For the original name of
Carthage was Carthada, as Solinus and Stephanus Byzantinus write it, which
signifies in the Phenician tongue, a new city, from (...) Kartha-hadath; The
old name Carthada i.e. the new city.
and it was so styled by them, because it was built after Utica etc. See
Bochart Can lib. 1. c. 25. And that Carthage was indeed builded, and planted by
the Phenicians, and Cananites, is manifest by the common confessions of the
Inhabitants of those parts, according to Traditions continued amongst them even
till Austins time: for he, upon the Epistle to the Romans, tells us, that if any
of the common people about Hippo, or Carthage, were asked who he was, or what
Country man; he presenty replied that he was (...) Chanani a Cananite; The
Carthaginians call themselves Cananites see Chap. 3.. 2. 3. 4.
and so Livy, lib. 34. says of Annibal, that when he came to Tire he was
received of the Founders of Carthage as into his own Country. Hence says
Bochart Can. l. 1. c. 24. it appears that Dido did not build Carthage, but
restored it, and added Byrsa; she being dead the Kingly government was changed
into a popular or Aristocratical; (as Livy lib. 33.) for the government of
affairs was in the hands of a few Judges, The Carthaginian Magistrates called
Suffetes from the Phenicians and Jews. Utica i.e. the old city peopled by
Phenicians.
whom the Roman writers call suffetes i.e. in the Phenician (...), as they were
called among the Jews.

. 8. Among the African Cities, excepting Carthage, there was none more famous
than Utica, according to the Greeks (...), which in regard of Antiquity, had
the Preeminence of Carthage (as before) and is thence by Learned Bochart, as to
its origination, derived from the Phenician name (...) atica, which signifies
ancient, so that its Antiquity, when Carthage was built (which signifies the
new City) gave it this name. That it was built by the Phenicians, Stephanus
(...) tells us, saying, that it was (...) a Colony of Tyrians: and Velleius
Paterculus relates unto us: that the Tyrians built Utica a few years after
Gades, about the time of Codrus, who was equal with Saul. See Bochart Can. lib.
1. cap. 25. Tingis or Tangier peopled by Phenicians.
That Tingis (now called Tangar or Tangier) received its name from the
Phenician (...) tagger, to negotiate, it being a town of much trade, also that
it had a Colony of Phenicians, see Bochart Phal. l. 3. c. 7. and Can. lib. 1.
cap 25.

CHAP. VI. Phenician Navigations into Greece under Cadmus.
The Phenicians expedition into Greece under Cadmus. That Cadmus was a
Cananite, and Hivite. The Cadmonites mentioned Genesis 15.19. the same with the
Hivites Josh. 11.3. (...) from (...) Cadmoni i.e. orientals, and Harmonia from
Hermon, the Seat of the Hivites. The Fable of Cadmus's being changed into a
serpent, Phenician. Cadmus's sowing the teeth of a Serpent etc. from a mistake
of the Phenician words. Of Cadmus's being the Kings Cook, or Steward etc.
whence this mistake? Cadmus a name common to several. Letters brought into
Greece by Cadmus. The story of Cadmus's causing the Ismen river etc. from the
Phenician (...).

. 1. The Phenicians fend Colonies into Greece under Cadmus etc.
THe Cananites having been driven out of Canaan by the Israelites, first sit
down upon the Shore of the Midland Sea, which they call Phenicia: but that
being too narrow for such a numerous multitude, they thence transplant
Colonies, throughout all Coasts on the Midland Sea; and so disperse themselves
into several parts of Africa, Europe, and Asia. We have already shown how they
sent Colonies into Spain, and Africa, under the Conduct of Hercules, about
Joshua's time. We are now to manifest how these Phenicians, or Cananites, about
the same time of their expulsion from Canaan by Joshua sent forth Colonies into
Greece, and the parts adjacent, under the command of Cadmus, and other
Phenician Commanders. So Eusebius tells us: that about the time of Joshua and
Othoniel, lived Cadmus, and Phaenix; two brothers, or two sons of Agenor King
of Phenicia; of whom the first i.e. Cadmus seated himself, first in Baeotia,
and afterward in Illyricum: this latter Phoenix fixed his seat in Thracia, and
Bithynia. The like Carrion, in his Chronicon lib. 2. de Graecis, acquaints us,
that Cadmus sailed from Phenicia into Baeotia etc. And learned Bochart in his
Preface to Canaan, adds, that if we believe Mythologists, there sprung from
the same family of Agenor, Cilix, who gave original to Cilicia; and Thasus, who
gave name to the Island Thasus, and Membliarus, kinsman of Cadmus, who reigned
in Thera, near Crete etc. Touching the original of the Grecians we find this
general account in Carrion of Greece l. 2. The name Japet, says he, was well
known to the Greeks, but whence it came they knew not. From Japhet descended
Javan, from whom the Grecians sprang, as the name Jonia shows. Hellas descended
from Hellus, who reigned amongst the Dononaei the offspring of Dodanim the son
of Japhet. The latter name Graecia was from Graecus the son of Thessalus. Thus
Carrion.

. 2. That Cadmus was a Phenician Cananite.
As for Cadmus, that he was a Phenician Cananite, of the posterity of the
Hivites, who were seated near the Hill Hermon, we have very strong presumptions
from learned Bochart, and others. Concerning Cadmus, see Stillingf. Orig. Sacr
chap. 1. Sect. 19
It Is true Apollodorus, and others, too much addicted to the fabulous
narrations of Poets, make Phaenix to be the son of Belus, and father of Cadmus,
and both Phaenix and Cadmus to be born in Egypt. Whence Eusebius in his
Chronicon lib. 2. on the year 1062, says: that Phaenix, and Cadmus coming from
the Egyptian Thebes into Syria, reigned at Tire and Sidon. But this fable is
sufficiently refuted by the names of Belus, Phaenix and Cadmus, which are
purely Phenician, and not Egyptian; and the ancient Phenician Annals, composed
by Sanchoniathon, prove thus much. Where (...), the Surname of Phaenix, is said
to arise out of Phenicia: now Chna (as has been proved) is but the Contract of
Canaan. And that Cadmus was no other than a Phenician, descended from that part
of the Cananites called Hivites near Hermon, we have good evidence from the
Origination of the name etc.

. 3. Cadmus from the Kadmonites Genesis 15.19. which were Hivites Josh. 11.3.
We read in Gen: 15.19. of Kadmonites which are the same with the Hivites
mentioned Josh. 11.2. where the Hivites under Hermon are reckoned amongst the
Cananites on the east. This mount Hermon was the most eastern part of all
Canaan: thence in Psalm. 87.13. Hermon is put for the East, as Thabor for the
West, whence these Hivites were called Kadmonites, i:e: the eastern people.
Hence Cadmus received his Origination and Denomination. The Greek (...) from
(...)
For the Greek (...) answers exactly to the Phenician or Hebrew (...) Cadmoni
i:e: a Cadmonite descending from the Cadmonites, or Hivites. Thus Carrion Chron.
l. 2. Cadmus sailed from Phenicia into Baeotia: and his name discovers his
original. For Cadmus in the Phenician tongue signifies Oriental. This is
farther evident, from the name of Cadmus's Wife, who is called Harmonia, or
Hermione, from the mountain Hermon, whence they both had their original. So
Psalm. 42.6. Psalm. 42.6. Judge. 3.3.
These Hivites or Cadmonites are called Hermonites as Judge. 3.3. See Bochart
his Preface to Phaleg: also his Canaan lib. 1. cap. 19, 20.

. 4. The Fable of Cadmus's being changed into a Serpent from a Phenician word.
That both Cadmus, and his Wife Harmonia were Cadmonites, or Hivites, receives
farther appearance from that ancient Fable of their being both changed into a
Serpent, which seems to have its original from the near cognation betwixt the
name Hivite and Serpent in the Syrian or Hebrew tongue: for (...), which
signifies a Serpent, is of the same sound with Hivite: whence the Greeks, who
frequently coined Fables from the imitation of sounds, raised this fiction. So
Boch. Phal. lib. 4. cap. 36. The habitation of the Hivites (says he) was on
the mount Hermon; deservedly therefore were the Hivites called Cadmonites, i:e:
orientals Genesis 15.19. Genesis 15.19.
From Cadmon, and Hermon, is Cadmus ( Graec. (...)) and his Wifes name Harmonia
plainly drawn. That they were both Hivites is from thence manifest, that they
are both said to be turned into a Serpent: for the name Hivites sounds
Serpents. The Gibeonites, and Sichemites were Colonies of these Hivites Josh.
11.19. Thus Bochart.

. 5. The Fable of Cadmus's sowing Serpents teeth etc. from Phenician sounds.
We have farther illustration hereof, from that old Grecian Fable touching
Cadmus's sowing the teeth of a Serpent, whence sprung up a numerous company of
Soldiers, who destroying each other, there remained only five which subjected
the whole of Baeotia to their Empire. This Fable, though ridiculous enough, yet
has it much to discover its original to be from the Phenician tongue: Learned
Bochart in his Canaan lib. 1. cap. 19. does thus decipher this riddle: first,
(says he) Cadmus in the Hebrew phrase, is said to make Soldiers which he
listed: So 1 Samuel 14.48. (...) and he made forces i.e. listed. But why of the
teeth of a Serpent? In the Phenician tongue, which is partly Syrian, partly
Hebrew, (...) teeth of a Serpent, signifies also spears of brass, with which
Cadmus first armed his Soldiers in Greece: for he was the first finder out of
brass: so Hyginus cap. 274. Cadmus, the son of Agenor first purifyed brass
found at Thebes. Thence Pliny lib. 34. c. 1. says: that the stone or mineral
of which Cadmus made brass was even to his time called Cadmia. Now that the
Soldiers are said to be reduced to five; was occasioned from the ambiguity of
the word (...), which, according to its variety of sound, may signify either
five, or him who is prepared for war. Exodus 13.18. to sum up the whole: it is
most likely the Phenicians writ thus of Cadmus, in their own Language (...),
which words the Grecians, not understanding the Phenician tongue, thus rendered?
He made an army of five men armed with the teeth of a Serpent: whereas it
should have been rendered thus: he gathered an army furnished with the spears of
warlike men: i.e. with spears made of brass; such were the spears of the old
Grecians, who used brass in stead of iron.

. 6. Cadmus commander of the Phenician Colonies.
We have another Grecian Fable touching Cadmus, which argues his original to be
Phenician. Athenaeus lib. 14. makes mention of Cadmus, being the Kings (...),
he fled with his wife Harmonia: (...), is usually rendered Cook, but here it
signifies Steward answering to the Hebrew (...), such were Potiphar and
Nebuzaradan, which the LXX render (...), but the Chaldee better (...) the
master of the Guard; and Jerome, the master of the Soldiers, or the General of
the Army: and the mistake was easy because (...), in its common signification,
imports both to play the Cook, and to kill: so that indeed Cadmus, being
General of the Phenician Colonies, went with his Wife Harmonia, into Greece
etc. See Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 19.

. 7. Cadmus a name common not pro^r.
Some make Cadmus a Tyrian; others a Sidonian; but the latter seems most
probable: because Tire was not built in Cadmus's age. Though I am apt to think,
the name Cadmus was not appropriated to any single person, but common to
several of those Phenician Hivites, or Cadmonites, which settled in Greece. For
Suidas makes two milesian Cadmus's; whereof the one he makes to be Pandonians
son; the other the son of Archelaus. The former he counts more ancient; whom he
makes to live between Eumelus and Pherecydes the Syrian. Strabo, lib. 1. makes
mention of the same, affirming: that there were three that began to write in
prose, Cadmus, Pherecydes, and Hecataeus. This Clemens Alexandr. l. 6. calls
(...), Cadmus Senior: yet was he far younger than our Phenician Cadmus, who
seems to be contemporary with Joshua. Voss. H^st. Graec. lib. 4. C. 1.

. 8. Cadmus's bringing Letters into Greece.
Cadmus transported into Greece, together with his Phenician Colonies, the
Hebrew Alphabet, at least sixteen Letters thereof; which by an inversion and
change of the manner of writing, from left to right, received a Grecian form.
To these Pythagoras added one; and Simonides, or Epicharmus four more, of which
hereafter. Neither did the Grecians receive their Letters only, but also much
of their Mythologie or Fables and other Learning from Cadmus, and the
Phenicians. I shall at present only mention that one Fable of Cadmus, who at
his landing is said: to have made more than ordinary impression with his foot
on the mud; and so to have caused the Ismen River; thence styled the foot of
Cadmus. Which Fable arose hence; because the Phenician (...), according to the
various apposition of the letters, may signify either a foot or a river:
therefore for the river of Cadmus, Ismenus is called the foot of Cadmus; and
thence the Fable. See Bochart praef. ad Canaan.

CHAP. VII. Phenician Colonies in Greece.
Cadmus first seated himself in Boeotia, Thebes etc. The Phenicians possessed
the Cyclades, as Syra etc. The Invention of the Heliotrope taken from Ahaz's
dial, and communicated to the Syrans, by the Syrians. Delos had its name, God,
Temple, and Oblations from the Jews, by the Phenicians. Of Anius Apollo's
Priest, his Name, and Oblations of Corn, Wine, and Oil, Jewish: as Deuteronomy.
14.23. and 18.3,4. Phenicians at Athens, and Salamine. Phenicians in Laconia,
Cythera. etc. Of the old Pelasgi, and that they were not the sole Authors of
the Hebrew Letters, Names, Fables, and Traditions found in Greece. Phenicians
in parts adjacent to Greece.

. 1. Cadmus's building (...).
CAdmus first seated himself in Boeotia, as Eusebius, Carrion, and Bochart
assure us, and built the upper part of Thebes, which was from him called
Cadmia; and the whole City of Thebes, was by the Phenicians named (...) Thebes,
from dirt: for it had much dirt in it, being all watery. We read of the same
name Judge. 9.50. Then went Abimelech to Thebez etc. which Josephus renders
(...). And that Thebes, was really built, and peopled by the Phenicians, is
evident from one of its seven Gates called, Oncea, i.e. from Onca, the name the
Phenicians gave Minerva, to whom Cadmus erected an altar in that place. So
Stephanus: (...). The Phenicians styled Minerva Onca, from (...) to move war:
see Seldom de Diis Syrum Syntag. 2. cap. 4. From Baeotia, the name of Gadmus
was transferred into Ionia, where the City Priene was called Cadme, because
founded by Philota the Beotian. So Bochart Canaan lib. 1. cap. 16.

. 2. The Phenicians possessors of most of the Cyciades, as Cea, Naxus,
Astypalea, Jes, Syra etc.
The Phenicians possessed most of the Islands in the Egean Sea, commonly called
the Cyclades, as it is sufficiently manifest, both from the Founders, and Names
of the Places. In Cea reigned Aristaeus, the son in law of Cadmus. Bacchus the
nephew of Cadmus possessed Naxus. Astypalaea had its name from Astypalaea, the
daughter of Phaenix, and mother of Ancaeus, who held Samus. Oliarus was (...) a
Colonie of Sidonians; as Stephanus. Who tells us also, that Jos was formerly
called Phenice. Yea several of the names, which the Phenicians imposed on those
places, continued a long time after; Phenicians in Syra where they communicated
the knowledge of the Heliotrope taken from haz's dial. King. 20.11.
as Syra, where the Syrians, or Phenicians arriving, planted a Colonie, and
called the place from their own name. This is farther evident from the
Knowledge and use of the Heliotrope, which is supposed to have been first
invented by these Syrans, but was indeed communicated to them by the
Phenicians, who who received it (as Bochart conceives) from the original
pattern of Ahaz's dial 2 King. 20.11. This was improved by Pherecydes,
Pythagoras's master, who was a Syran, not a Syrian immediately, as most think,
but upon a mistake; as Bochart, from his own mouth, informed me: see more
Bochart Canaan l. 1. c. 14.

. 3. Delos from the Phenicians.
The most famous Island in the Egean Sea is Delos; which received its name, with
many other Fables touching Apollo, from the Phenicians, and Jews. The figment
of Delos's receiving its name from (...), because Latona lying hid in the Sea,
at the time of her bringing forth, was made manifest by Jupiter, is not more
ancient, than fabulous. Bochart's conjecture, that Delus had its origination
from (...) Deel (as Belus from (...)) fear, according, to that: Primus in orb
Deos timor fecit, is more probable. Thence (...) is often used, in the Chaldee
Paraphrasts, for the Gentile Gods: Exodus 20.23.
so Exodus 20.23. wherefore the Phenicians called Delus (...) Deel: that is, the
Island of the God Apollo: or in the plural (...) of the Gods viz. Diana, and
Apollo: for the birth of whom this place was famous. Inopu^.
Thence Inopus was called by the Phenicians (...) the fountain of Python; being
a river in the same Island, derived by secret passages under the earth from
Nilus, as it is supposed. Cynthus.
And Cynthus the mountain of Delos, where Latona brought forth Apollo, from
(...) to bring forth: whence the Phenician (...), and the Greek (...) being put
for (...), as in Cadmus's Alphabet Boch. Can. l. 1. c. 24.

. 4. That the several names of Apollo, his Temple, and Idolatrous Worship at
Delus, were all but corrupt degenerate derivations from Jewish Traditions,
conveyed thither by the Phenicians will hereafter, I hope, be manifest. See
Dickinsons Delphi Phaenizantes. Of Anius King and priest at Delus.
I shall at present only mention the story of Anius, who is said, by Virgil
Aene. lib. 3. to be both King of Delos, and Priest of Apollo about the time of
the Trojan war. This Anius, is supposed to be of the race of Cadmus: His Mother
Rhaeo, from Staphulus the son of Bacchus. He was called Anius (...) from his
Mothers sorrow, says the Etymologist: for being with child by Apollo, as the
Fable goes, and driven from her fathers house, after many wanderings, she brings
forth Anius, in the den Eubaea. Now (...), in the Phenician tongue, is (...)
any; which signifies also affliction: so that the name Anius is Phenician, as
well as Grecian. And that this whole story of Anius, and his Priesthood, was
but an imitation of the Jewish Rites, traduced to Delus by the Phenicians, is
apparent from his offerings: Anius's Offerings of corn, wine and oil, from
Jewish Traditione. Deuteronomy. 14.23. and 18.3,4. (...) 18.12.
for it is said, that this Anius, in the time of the Trojan war, brought to the
Grecian tents, store of wine, oil, and bread corn: which were but the Relics
of those Offerings he had received in Apollo's Temple. For the Devil, who
delights to imitate Divine Rites, required of his worshippers, out of all the
fruits of the earth, the Tenths, and first fruits of wine, oil, and corn, in
imitation of Gods Institution, who laid a special obligation upon Israel, to
offer the first fruits, and Tenths of their wine, oil, and corn. Deuteronomy. 18.3,4.
Numb. 18.12. Deuteronomy. 14.23. See more Bochart. Can. l. 1. c. 14.

. 5. Phenicians at Atheus
That the Athenians were, originally, Phenicians, Bochart Can. l. 1. c. 21.
Thus proves; Aristogiton, and Harmodius, who killing Hipparchus, delivered the
Athenians from Tyranny, were of the stock of the Gephyreans: Now the
Gephyreans, according to the testimony of Herodotus, were Phenicians, of those
who came into Boeotia, with Cadmus, and first seated themselves at Tanagra: but
being beaten thence by the Beotians, they turned away to Athens, where, upon
certain conditions, having obtained the power of the City, they built Temples
to Ceres etc. The Phenicians, which were in Boeotia, near Asopus, betook
themselves unto Salamin the Attack Island, as we may gather (says Bochart) from
this, that the Island (...) Salamin, is the Island (...). The Arab. (...), which,
from the biting of the Serpent was thence called Salamis, anciently possessed
by the Dragon which Cycraeus killed etc.

. 6. Phenicians in Laconia.
Although that Fable, of the Spartans being brethren to the Jews, and of the
posterity of Abraham, be of little credit; yet are we not without probable
conjectures that Laconia was frequented by the Phenicians. Cythera.
That Cithera, a Laconick Island, was possessed by them, Bochart makes evident:
whence Venus, the Phenician Goddess, was called Cytherea: because passing from
Phenicia, she landed here at Cythera: thence that poetic figment, of Venus's
arising out of the sea, and landing at Cythera, Stephanus takes the origination
of Cythera (...), from Cytherus the Phenician: but Bochart will have it derived
from (...) Cethare i.e. stones: for, as the Beotian Citheron, so this Island
Cithera abounded much with rocks. And hence, as Pliny lib. 14. c. 15. telsus,
it was also called Porphyris, or Porphyrusa, by reason of the many Purples
(which delight mostly in rocky places) hereabouts. Boch. Can. l. 1. c. 22.

. 7. But here we may not pass over an objection, which a learned person of
this age and Country, has cast in our way: Stillingf. Orig Sacr. lib. 3. chap.
4. Sect. 11. Of the old Pelasgi.
namely, that the ground of the affinity between the Jews and La cedemonians,
was from the Pelasgi, whose chief seat was in Arcadia; to which adjoynes
Laconia. That these Pelasgi sprang from Phaleg the son of Eber, from whom
Abraham and the Jews came. Genesis 11.17,20. That the Hellenes were not the first
inhabitants of Greece, but these Pelasgi, who spread themselves over Greece,
and brought with them the Hebrew language; whence an account may be given of
many Hebrew words in the Greek tongue, which came not from the Phenicians, as
Bochartus, but the old Pelasgi. This is the objection.

The old Pelasgi not the sole Authors of the Hebrew letters and names found in
Greece.
Answ. 1. How far the Pelasgi prevailed in Greece, is not material as to our
present design. 2. Neither do I see how it would overthrow Bocharts Assertion,
should it be granted, that many Greek words owe their origination to them. 3.
Yet cannot I see sufficient ground to make any reasonable conjecture, that
these old Pelasgi brought the Hebrew tongue, or left any considerable footsteps
thereof in Greece. 4. Whether they did, or did not; yet this is certain, that
many, if not all those names of places, mentioned by Bochart, will not admit of
any but a Phenician origination: as Oncea, Cadmia, Cadme, Astypalaea, Phaenice,
Syra etc. are manifest Derivations from the Phenician tongue. 5. We have the
common consent of learned Antiquity, for the Transportation of Phenician
Colonies, Letters, and Words, into Greece by Cadmus, and others. But of this
more hereafter.

. 8. Phenician Colonies in Cilicia, Pisidia, Caria, Rhodes etc.
That the Phenicians sent Colonies into, or at least frequented Cilicia,
Pisidia, Caria, Rhodes and Samus see learned Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 5, 6, 7,
8. Also that the Island Icarus, or Icaria, received its name from (...) Icar, an
Island for pasture, not from that fabulous Icarus. And Patmos from the Syrian
(...). That Phaenix led a Colonie into Bithynia; and that Thracia, Thasus, and
Samothracia were all frequented by Phenicians, Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 10,
11, 12. proves. Also that the Phenicians proceeded Northward so far as
Illyricum, see the same Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 23. By all which, we may
easily guess, how the Jewish Mysteries, and Traditions were traduced into
Greece and the parts adjacent, by these Phenicians.

Corsica; which Ezekiel. 27.6. is called Citthim.

. 1. AS the Phenicians dispersed Colonies into Greece, and the Northern parts
adjacent thereto, so in like manner Westward, throughout all parts of the
Midland Sea; for which they had all the advantages that might be, both from
their skill in Navigation, and the situation of their Country Phaenicia, as
before. We shall begin with Cyprus, which lay next to Phenicia, and mighty
commodious for their Trade. Phenicians in Cyprus.
This Island Cyprus seems to be one of the first, that came under the Dominion
of these Phenicians. Eusebius in his Chronicon, on the number 1089 observes,
that Paphos a Phenician City in Cyprus, was built when Cadmus reigned at
Thebes. Bochart also Praef. ad Canaan, tells us: that before the time of the
Trojan war Cinyras King of Phenicia, possessed this Island of Cyprus, by virtue
of right received from his Ancestors. Cynyras, Myrrha, Adonis Phenicians.
This Cinyras by Myrrha begot Adonis, Venus's sweet heart. Cinyras by the
Phenicians, was called (...), Myrrha (...), Adonis (...) Cinnor, by the Greeks
is rendered (...) a kind of harp; whence Cinyras had his name given him; the
reason whereof you may find in Suidas on (...). This is that Cinyras, by whom
Agamemnon had his breast plate given him, as Hom. Iliad l. Boch. Can. l. 1. c.
3. Yea the very name Cyprus, shows its origination to be Phenician. Cyprus from
(...) Cant. 1.14.
For in Stephanus and Eustathius, Cyprus is so called (...), from the flour
Cyprus which grows there, which in the Hebrew is called (...) Copher Cant.
1.14. Neither are we without likelihood, that the Island Cyprus received its
name from this Plant Cyprus, which grows in such abundance there, though else
where it be more rare. Plin. lib. 12. cap. 24.

. 2. That the Phenicians enjoyed, even from their first Navigations, the
possession of Cyprus, is also apparent from the common fame of Belus's reigning
over Cyprus, and founding the Cities of Citium and Lapethus. Belus.
This Belus was one of the ancient Kings of Phenicia, (though not the first of
that name) whose son Pygmalion reigned after him in Cyprus. Belus reigned 32
years, and Pygmalion 40 years. Belus comes from (...) Baal Lord, because he was
King of Phenicia; from whom all the Phenician Baalim had their denomination.
Pygmalion.
Pygmalion, in the Hebrew is (...) Pygmeelion, i:e: rest from the most high
God: in Greek (...). Elion was one of the Phenician Gods, as it appears out of
Sanchoniathon. Melchisedec King of Canaan worshipped the true God under this
name Genesis 14.18,19. Genesis 14.18,19. Elion.
Unto Pygmalion, succeeded Paphus, who built Paphum in Cyprus, where stood that
famous Temple dedicated to Paphia Venus, of which Tacitus speaks much Hist.
lib. 2. At this place it is said; that Venus arising out of the sea first
arrived etc.

. 3. Citium.
Also that Citium, a famous City in Cyprus, was possessed by the Phenicians,
Laertius, and Suidas write, on the life of Zeno: the like Grotius: and Vossius,
out of Cicero, proves that the Citieans sprang from the Phenicians, Citium,
says he, a town of Cyprus where Zeno was borne, had Phenician Inhabitants: So
Cicero lib. 4. de finibus, know that the Citieans, thy clients sprang from
phenicia: Vossius de Philos. Sectis l. 2. cap. 1. Citium, as Bochart tells us,
was so called from (...) Cethim, (not Cethis the son of Javan Genesis 10.4.) and
was famous for nothing more, than for the birth of that famous Philosopher
Zeno, who was thence styled Citiensis. Urania.
Urania, another City of Cyprus, received its name from Urania Venus, whose
worship was translated from Ascalon into Cyprus, by the Phenicians, as
Herodotus writes. Idalium.
Idalium a town of Cyprus seems to be so called, by the Phenicians, in the
Hebrew (...) Idala. We have a town in the Tribe of Zabulon, mentione^ by the
same name Jos. 19.15. jad-ela verbatim the place of the Goddess, ie. dedicated
to Venus: whence Idalia Venus. Bochart Can. l. 1. cap. 3.

. 4. Phenicians in Crete.
That Crete also received both its name, and Inhabitants from the Phenicians,
is not improbable. For the name Cretes, seems to be taken from (...) Crethi
i.e. darters; from their fame for darting: thence the Cretian bow, and the
Cretian arrow. So the Inhabitants of Palestine, the Phenicians, are called
(...) Cherethims Ezekiel. 25.16. Zeph. 2.5. Ezekiel. 25.16. Zeph. 2.5.
which the LXX render (...) (and the Vulgar Cerethi) i.e. Cretians. Also in
Gortyna, a City of Crete near the river Lethaeus, Atymnus, the brother of
Europa, was worshipped; whose Phenician name was (...) Theman: and the whole
story, of Jupiter King of Crete, his stealing Europa a Phenician, and bringing
of her into Crete on a bull, arises merely from a mistake of the Phenician
words. The fable of Europa's being carried away by Jupiter, under the form of
a bull, from a mistake of the Phenician word.
For the Phenician (...) signifying either a bull, or a ship; when in the
History it ran thus: that, Jupiter carried away Europa (...) in a ship; the
Grecians had rather understand it of a Bull, to render the story more
fabulous: so from the equivocation of the word, the Fable sprang: as Bochart
Can. l. 1. c. 15. or it may be, the ship had ((...)) the sign of a Bull; as
the Ship Paul sailed in, had the sign of Castor and Pollux: it being usual to
call their Ships by the names of the signs they carried, so Stillingfleet
orig. saer. l. 3. c. 5. sect. 5. Europe whence so called.
Europa in the Phenician Tongue, is (...), from the whitenes of her face; whose
beauty was greatly esteemed: whence Europe borrows its name, Crete (where
Europa was) being the utmost extent thereof.

. 5. Melita the seat of the Phenicians
Melita, an Island in the Midland Sea, famous for the shipwreck of Paul, and the
chief fortress of the Knights of Rhodes, now called the Knights of Maltha, was
also possessed by the Phenicians. So Diodorus lib. 5. (...) etc. This Island is
a Colonie of the Phenicians. Hence it is that to this very day, the dialect of
the Country people in this Island, is thought to be half Punick; or rather, as
Bochart will have it, Arabic. As for the Etymology of the name Melita,
Bochart draws it, either from (...) to free: thence (...) Melita a Refuge;
because standing in the midst of the Sea, and having commodious ports; as also
being in the midst of the way from Tire to Gades, it was a mighty shelter to
the Phenicians in their yearly Navigations to Gades. So Diodorus lib. 5. Melita
is a Colonie of the Phenicians, who extending their Negotiations even unto the
Ocean (...) made this Island their refuge. Such indeed it was to Paul. Bochart
gives it another origination, from (...), which signifies mortar made of lime
and sand, which the Romans call Maltha; whence the Island is called Calicata;
this kind of mortar being much used here, as Diodorus l. 5. About the lower
part of this Island, Ptolemy places the Temple of Juno on the one side, and the
Temple of Hercules on the other, both Phenician Gods, whereof there remain some
relics to this day. In that of Juno, there were ivory teeth of an incredible
Magnitude, with this Punick inscription: MASINISSAE: Bochart Can. l. 1. c. 26.

. 6. Phenicians in Sicilie.
The Pheniciaus from Tire, or else from Carthage, possessed the Shores of
Sicilie, long before the Greeks. So Thucydides lib. 6. and it is most probable
that the Phenicians settled themselves in these parts, about the same time they
invaded Africa: which Bochart proves from many ancient Fables, and names of
places, which have a note of the Phenician Dialect: Lilybe.
So Lilybe, or Lilybaeum, which lies over against Africa, in the Punick tongue,
is called (...) to Libya; or (...) Lelybae, to the Lybians; because over
against them. Eryx.
Near Drepanum stands the most high mountain Eryx, inferior to none but Aetna:
its name is purely Punick. So the Hebrew (...) Harucas, signifies an high
place, as Esa. 40.4. On the top of Eryx, stood the Temple dedicated by the
Phenicians to Venus, who was thence styled Erycina. Scylla. Charybdis.
In the Sicilian strait, near Pelorus, lies Scylla, and Charybdis. Scylla,
according to the Punick (...) Scol; signifies destruction Levit. 10.19. as the
Chaldee: in which sense (...) is used by the Greeks. Again, Charybdis, in the
Phenician (...) Chor-obdan signifies a gulf of perdition: So Seneca, hiatu
magno sorbet navigia. Aetna.
The mountain Aetna, was called by the Phenicians (...) Attuna, a furnace or
chimney; or Aetuna darkness Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 28.

. 7. The Phenicians inhabited, almost, all parts of Sicilie; having at first
possessed themselves of the sea coasts, the better to carry on their
negotiation. But in after time many of the Grecians, seating themselves in the
same Island, they inhabited together. The Cyclopes.
The Cyclopes, who were Inhabitants of Sicilie, were, as Bochart observes, so
called from the Phenician (...) Chek-lub, i.e. a sinus toward Lybia; which the
Greeks rendered (...): whence their Fable, that they had but one eye, and that
orbicular. Sicilie, so called from (...) a grape.
As for the name Sicilie, it seems to be derived from the Phenician (...)
Siclul, i.e. the Island of perfection: because of its fertility: or else (which
Bochart esteems truer) from the Syriack (...) a grape; as in Genesis 40.10. (...)
is used for grapes: so the Phenicians called Sicilie, as if it were the Island
of Grapes. The Reason of the name is manifest: for in those ancient times, the
Carthaginians had no vines nor grapes, but what they had from Sicilie: which
Homer describes as most abounding with vines. Whence the Mamertine, Potaline,
Taurominitane and Syracusane Wines. Thence Sicilie was called Naxus; from the
plenty of vines. For all know that Naxon was an Island dedicated to Bacchus by
reason of its plenty of vines, Boch. Can. lib. 1. c. 30.

. 8. Phenicians in Italy.
That the Phenicians sent their Colonies into, or frequented, at least, some
parts of Italy, is confessed by Bochart, Tyrrhenians not from Tyrians.
though he differ from Fuller, and Grotius about the Tyrrhenians, who make them
to be the posterity of the Tyrians; but Bochart makes the Tyrrhenians,
according to Homer, Thucydides, and Herodotus, the same with the (...), and so
not to descend from the Tyrians. Yet he grants, that the Italian Shores were
very well known to, and frequented by the Phenicians; as it is easy to gather
out of Homer; who seems to have drawn all his Italian Fables from the the
relation of the Phenicians. Cimmerians.
As the Aurunci had their name from light, so the Cimmerii from darkness,
because, according to the Phenicians (...) Cimmir is to wax dark: whence (...)
Cimrir signifies blacknes of darkness Job. 3.5. Job. 3.5.
Thence the Fable, of Cimmerian darkness: Italia.
Yea Bochart derives the name Italia, from the Phenician (...) Itaria; which
coming from (...), signifies a country abounding with pitch; such was Italy;
whence it was anciently called the Brutian, i.e. the pitchy Country. As for
the permutation of R into L, that was easy and usual. Calabria.
Hence also the Hebrew (...) signifying pitch, gave name to Calabria. Latium
and Lat^.
So in like manner Latium is, by Bochart, derived from the Phenician (...),
which in the plural is (...) latim, or (...) latin, i.e. enchantment. Whence
that famous Grecian Fable of Circe's being a Witch; and Latium the neighboring
Country, its abounding with enchanting herbs etc. Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 33.

. 9. Phenicians in Sardinia.
That Sardinia was anciently possessed by the Carthaginians, or Phenicians,
Bochart Can. l. 1. c. 31. proves, 1. From its name. For Sardinia from potters
clay was anciently called Icknusa, and Sandaliotis: by the Carthaginians (...),
from the Hebrew (...), i.e: vestigium, (...) being inserted by the custom of
the tongue. 2. That the Phenicians sent Colonies into Sardinia, about the same
time that they invaded Africa, Spain and Sicilie, may be gathered out of
Diodorus lib. 5.3. We have mention made of Caralis, Sulchi, and Charmis
Phenician Cities in Sardinia.

. 10. Corsica.
That Corsica also was possessed by the Phenicians, appears. 1. From its name
Corsica, or Corsis, which is the same with the Phenician (...) Chorsi; as if
one should say, a place full of woods. 2. Corsica was also called by the
Grecians (...), from the Phenician (...) horny: that is to say, the Horny
Island: because of its many Promontories, and angles. 3. Callimachus in his
hymn on Delus, calls Corsica, Phaenissa. 4. We read Ezech. 27.6. Ezech. 27.6.
Citthim Corsica.
That the Tyrians made the benches of their Ships of box brought out of
Citthim, that is the Island of Corsica, as Bochart proves Can. lib. 1. c. 32. It
is, says he, doubted, whether the Phenicians possessed Corsica: neither do the
ancients make any great mention of it. Yet seeing they possessed Sardinia for
so many ages, I can hardly believe, that they would spare an Island so near, and
so easily to be gained. This appears by what I have proved from Ezech. 27.6.
also because this Island is called Phaenissa in Callim^chi hymn. in Dedlum.

CHAP. IX. Phenicians on the Western Ocean of France, and England, as also in
the East.
The Greek (...), which signifies the ocean, from the Phenician (...) the sea
ambient Esa. 40.22. Phenicians on the western ocean. Cassiterides, the British
Islands. Britannia so styled from the Phenician (...), thence (...) etc. Whence
it was called by the Greeks (...), the Island of Tin and Led. Hercules's landing

Phenicians and Egyptians conveyed Jewish Letters and Dogmes unto the Grecians.

. 1. Phenician Navigations West and East.
BEfore Homers time the Phenicians circuited the greatest part of the habitable
world; from whom he learned some things of the Ocean, and the ut most
Inhabitants of the Earth. Strabo lib. 1. speaking of the Phenicians, says,
that they went beyond Hercules's pillars, and built there many Cities a little
after the Trojan wars: namely under David and Solomon's reign; in which age the
most conceive Homer to have been borne. And Herodotus reports that the
Phenicians sailed under Neco from Egypt, and the Red Sea into the West; so that
they had the Sun on their right hand; whence they returned by the Gades unto
Egypt, and their own Country yearly. Ocean in Greek (...) from (...) Og i.e.
the Sea compassing.
And that the vast Ocean received its name, from the Phenicians, seems
probable, if we consider its old name, which among the Grecians was (...); so
Hesychius, (...). The like in Alexandra Lygophronis. Now the Greek (...) in
probability was derived from the Phenician (...) Og, i.e. the sea ambient. And
indeed (...) Og (whence the Greek (...) ocean) according to the Scripture
account, seems to be a Cosmographical name: Esa. 40.22.
so Esa. 40.22. upon the circle (...) of the earth: the like Job 22.14. Prove.
8.27. as Bochart Began. lib. 1. cap. 35.

. 2. Phenicians visit the western Ocean of Africa.
Although it appears not that the Phenicians sailed about the world; yet this,
I think, is evident, that, at several times, they visited most shores of the
Western Ocean. That they sailed beyond Hercules's pillars, on the western
shore of Africa, and there built several Cities toward the Ocean; we are
informed by the Periplum of Hanno; who being commanded, by the Decree of the
Carthaginian Senate, to sail beyond Hercules's pillars, and to build the
Lybiphenician Cities; and furnished with a Navy of sixty ships: he dispersed
thirty thousand men into several places, to build Cities, and inhabit the same.
Which done, he returns to his own Country, and writes his Periplum of Africa,
in the Punick tongue. But touching the Phenician Navigations into Africa and
Spain, we have already largely treated ( chap. 5.) and England.
We are now to treat of the Phenicians visiting France, and the British Islands.
So Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 36. tells us, That Himilco being sent to find out
the utmost parts of Europe, penetrated into Britanny, and the Cassiteridan
Islands, about the same time that Hanno went toward the South etc.

. 3. Phenicians in the Cassiterides that is the British Islands.
Srabo lib. 3. makes mention of, the Cassiterides, who in times past, were
known to the Phenicians only, who traded with them for Tin, Led and Skins etc.
Bochart ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 39.) by these Cassiterides understands the British
Islands; because there are are no other Islands besides these, to which Strabo's
description agrees, viz: that they are situated on the Ocean beyond the Artabri
Northward, abounding with Tin, and Led. This may be farther collected from the
very name Britannie. For in the book de mundo, which they attribute to
Aristotle, (...), are called Albion and Ierne. Britannie so styled from the
Phenician name (...) the land of Tin or Led: thence it was called by the Greeks
Cassiterides.
And Strabo often calls Britannie (...), or with a single (...), which seems to be
no other than (...) Barat. Anac, i.e. the field, or land of Tin and Led. (...)
bara, and in Regimen (...), in the Syriack signifies a field, as Dan. 2.38. and
4.12. As in like manner (...), is by the Hebrews rendered Led, or Tin: as Amos
7.7. So (...), whence Cassiterides, is by the Greeks used for Tin. Mela renders
it Led. And Pliny tells us, that the Cassiterides were so called by the Greeks,
from the abundance of Led therein found. Tin and Led, according to Pliny, being
but one and the same Species: and Britannie, as it is well known, is most
plentifully furnished with both these, beyond all other Countries. Whence we
may conclude that from (...), the Greeks first framed (...), and thence the
contracts (...) and (...) as Bochart Can. l. 1. c. 39.

. 4. Yea, the same Bochart makes the Greek (...), which signifies Tin (whence
these British Islands were called Cassiterides) to be of a Phenician
origination; because the Chaldees call Tin (...) Kastira: whence, says Pliny
lib. 7. cap. 56. The first that brought Led from the Islands Cassiterides, was
Midacritus. Hercules called Melicarthus landed Phenicians in Cassiterides.
Bochart for Midacritus, reads Melicarthus, or Melcarthus, which name
Sanchoniathon gives to the Phenician Hercules (to whom the Phenicians refer
their first Western Navigations) who is supposed to have landed Phenicians
both in Britannie, and Gallia or France. Farther, that the Phenicians
frequented Britannie, is proved out of Strabo lib. 4. who mentions that Ceres
and Proserpina were worshipped in or about Britannie, according to the
Samothracian i.e. the Phenician Rites.

That Ireland was not unknown to the Phenicians, Bochart conjectures from the
name, which seems altogether Phenician: Ireland called Hibernia from (...)
for Hibernia, is no other then (...) Ibernae, i.e. the utmost habitation;
because beyond Ireland, toward the West the ancients knew nothing but the vast
Ocean. Boch. Can. l. 1. c. 39. Ireland by the Greeks was called (...), as by
the Latins Hibernia, Ierna, Juverna. Which seem all derivations from the
Phenician (...) Ibernae.

. 5. Phenicians in France.
As the British Islands, so also Gallia (now called France) was visited by the
Phenicians, under the conduct of Hercules; who is reported to have invaded the
Gauls, about the same time he set foot in Spain; and that, not by the Pyrenean
Mountains, which was too difficult a passage, but by the Ligustick Sea.
Hercules's Battle with the Ligurians.
This is made evident by that famous battle, fought betwixt Hercules and the
Ligurians: of which, not only the Poets and Historians, but also the
Astronomers make mention. Hercules might also find a way into France, from the
Gades, by the Ocean. However it were, this is certain, that the Gauls, as long
as Carthage flourished, had no small commerce with the Carthaginians: for
Polybius, Livy, and Appian tell us, that in the first and second Carthaginian
war, the Gauls served them. Whence it was that Scipio being Conqueror, gave
peace to the Carthaginians upon this condition, that it should not be lawful
for them, for the future, to entertain any stipendiary Soldiers from Gallia, or
Laguria. Moreover, History teaches us, that Aquitania, which is part of
Gallia Narbonensis, was possessed, and long held by Hannibal. And, before
Hannibals time, it is not likely, that the Phenicians, in their Voyages into
Britannie, passed by the Gallick Shores unsaluted Bochart Can l. 1. c. 41.

. 6. The Affinity betwixt the old Britains and and Gauls in Language, Gads and
Officers.
The great Identity, or, at least, Affinity that was betwixt the old Britans,
and Gauls, both among themselves, as also with the Phenicians in names, Gods
and customs, does much conduce to prove our Assertion; that the Phenicians,
had not a little correspondence in these parts. Concerning the old Language of
the Gauls; what it was, and whence it sprang the Learned dispute much: but yet
it is agreed by the most, that the British Tongue (which at this day, is in use
among the Welsh in England, and the Britains in France) is but the Relics of
that Tongue, which both the old Britains, and Gauls used. In this opinion were
Rhenanus, Gesnerus, Hottomanus of old, with our famous Camden; who has lately
put it beyond doubt, that the old Britans and Gauls used one and the same
Language. The old Briti^ tongue, its Affinity with the Phenicians.
Whereto Bochart has added this: The old Britain^ and Gauls agree with the
Phenicians. 1. In Gods. 2. In Officers.
that this common Tongue, wherein both the Gauls and Britains agreed, agrees
also in many things with the Phenician Tongue. This Bochart Can. l. 1. c, 42.
proves 1. From the names of their Gods, which were Taramis, Hesus, Teutates,
Belenus, Onvana, Hogmius etc. all of Phenician original, and offpring; as will
hereafter appear. 2. From the names of Officers and Dignities, wherein the
Gauls, and Britains agreed, Brennus.
as 1. Brennus was a name of Dignity amongst the Gauls and Britains. We read of
two of this name famous for their exploits amongst the Gauls; the one was
Brennus the elder, who sacked Rome; the other Brennus the younger, who pillaged
the Delphick Temple. And there are some that think the name Brennus was common
to the Emperors of those times, because the Welsh to this day (as Camden
observes) call their King Brennis: and so amongst the Britains in France, Barn
signifies a Judge, and Barner is to judge, as amongst the Phenicians, (...)
Parnas is used for a Prince or Governor, as the Chaldee Esa. 3.4. Prove. 14.28.
The Radix of (...) signifies to feed; thence a Prince, whom Homer styles (...).
Mar Lord.
2. Mar, (which the Britains now sound Maur; whence the Gallick Condomarus
etc.) is derived from the Phenician (...) Mar a Lord. Rix or Rich.
3. Rix also was much used in the names of the Gallik and British Nobles as
Sinorix etc. which the French, English and Germans at this day pronounce Rich;
that is, strong or potent; from the Arabic (...), strength, or force. 4.
Patera a Priest, from the Hebrew (...) to interpret, Genesis 40.41. as Coenae from
(...): Druides from an Oak, as hereafter. Lastly Bardi, which signified Poets,
or Singers, is derived from (...) to sing, Amos 6.5. as Bochart Can. l. 1. c.
42.

. 7. Phenician Navigations into the East.
Neither had the Phenicians their navigations only Westward, but likewise into
the Eastern parts. So Bochart Canaan Praef. tells us: that in the time of David
and Solomon, the Phenicians sailing through the Red Sea, visited the Asian
Shores. Yea India itself, for traffic sake, taking Colonies from Elana, the
chief Mart town of the Arabic Gulf, and sailing even unto Tyrus and Aradus,
Islands in the Persian Gulf, of Phenician original. Solomon, by the assistance
of Hiram, sends his Fleet unto Ophir, and has thence Gold etc.
Whence Solomon entering into a Strict League with Hiram King of Tire, by the
assistance of the Phenicians, furnished himself with a Navy, which evry three
years he sent forth, from Elana and Esion Gaber, unto Ophir, that is (as he
proves in his Phaleg. lib. 2. cap. 27.) the Island Taprobana, now called Zeilan;
whence they brought Gold, Silver, Ebury, precious stones, Apes, Peacocks etc.
as 1 Kings 9.26,27,28. and 10.11,12,22. and 2 Chronicles. 8.19. That Ophir was the
Island Taprobana is made evident from Cant. 5.11. Dan. 10.5. Taprobane i.e. in
the Phenician tongue (...) Taph parvan, which signifies the Shore of Parvan,
whence we read of the Gold of Parvaim 2 Chronicles 3.6. Neither are we without
strong conjectures, that the Phenicians frequented this Hand; in that we find,
both in Pliny, and Solinus, Hercules the Phenician God, was worshipped here.
Boch. Can. l. 1. c. 46. That Ophir mentioned in these places is the same with
that we now call Peru, see Glassius Grammat. S. lib. 4. Tract. 3. Obser. 15.
page 847 Edit. 2^.

. 8. ^ow far these conjectures may be of use.
Thus have we shown how the Phenicians frequented most of the Sea Coasts of
Europe, Africa, and Asia; wherein, consider though many of the Arguments are
built on conjectures, yet 1. They are not conjectures of mine own framing, but
of the Learned. 2. Some conjectures may amount to moral demonstrations, or
certainty. 3. Conjectures in things so obscure, are not to be rejected
altogether. 4. Take the whole together, and I think, no sober judgment will
deny the conclusion viz. That the Phenicians frequented the chiefest Maritime
parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia.

. 9. Phenician learning from the Jews, Ut ex Hebraeis ad Phaenices, itae ex
Phaenicibus ad Gr^cos cum literis veaerunt Scientiae. Both. Phal. l. 1 c. 15.
And that the Phenicians traduced their choicest Mysteries, and Traditions,
which they transported into other parts, from the Jewish Church, will be
hereafter evident. At present take the Testimony of Lud: Vives in these words:
the Phenicians, for lucres sake, sailed throughout the world, where they
conveyed Science and Philosophy from the Jews. So Grot. on Mat. 24.38. Bochart
Ganaan lib. 2. c. 17. Vossius de Philosophorum Sectis lib. 2. c. 1. of which
see Part 2. of Philosophy book 1. chap. 3.

. 10. How the Egyptians conveyed Jewish Dogmes and Institutes unto the Gre^ians.
To conclude this our General account touching the Traduction of human
Literature from the Scriptures and Jewish Church. As we have shown how the
Phenicians, by reason of their Navigations, traduced Hebrew Letters and
Mysteries into Greece, and other parts of the world; so the same might be very
far demonstrated, touching the Egyptians, who gave a great vent to Jewish
Learning and Institutes though in a different mode of conveyance. For, as the
Phenicians propagated Jewish Literature, and Dogmes by Navigation and
transplantation of Colonies, so the Egyptians promoted the same design, by
reception of, and daily conversation with Forreiners, and Travelers. Hither it
was that many of the first Grecian Poets, Orpheus, Homer etc. resorted, and
furnished themselves with Jewish Traditions. Here the first Sophists Thales and
Solon; as also the Philosophers, Pythagoras, Plato etc. gleaned up the choicest
of their Jewish Dogmes, and Institutes, which they transported into Greece.
This we have endeavored to demonstrate at large in our second part of
Philosophy, Book 1. Chap. of Egyptian Philosophy, and in what follows.

CAP. X. Of the Traduction of all Languages and Letters from the Hebrew.
Philologie its Use and Distribution. God the first Institutor of Names; which,
by Adams Ministry, are imposed on things. Names, at first, but Images of
things. How words, and names are from Nature; and how from Institution. Genesis
2.19. All Languages originally from the Hebrew Genesis 11.1. Plato's
acknowledgment, that the Greeks received their Language from the Barbarians,
i.e. the Hebrews. Hebrew Letters at first invented by Moses. Testimonies of the
Learned to prove that Moses was the first Inventor of Letters. Moses the
Egyptian Theuth or Mercury, who is supposed to be the Author of Letters. The
Hebrews under the name of Syrians are said, to convey Letters to the Phenicians.

. 1. HAving given, in the former Chapters, a General Demonstration, of the
Traduction of all Learning from the Jewish Church and Oracles; with the manner
how it was diffused throughout the world, by the Phenicians; we now proceed to
demonstrate the same by Induction of particulars. All human wisdom may be
reduced to these two Heads of Philologie and Philosophy. Of Philologie its
Original.
As for Philologie, according to its original, and primitive import, it implies
an universal love, or respect to human Literature. Thus, they say, the name
(...) Philologus was first given unto Aristophanes, because he was a person,
according to the common vogue, adorned with manifold Wisdom and Learning. Hence
afterward (as Suetonius attests) Atteius assumed the Title of Philologus; and
that upon the same Ground. We find the very same appellation given to a
Christian Convert Romans 16.15. Romans 16.15.
Philologus etc. who (as Grotius on this place) probably was a Libertine,
brought up in human Literature; and for his great hopefulnes therein, surnamed
by his Master Philologus. So that Philologie, according to its primitive and
general notion, imports a comprehensive Knowledge in human Literature. We shall
not extend the notion, to its utmost, but only discourse of Philologie as
distributed into these severals. 1. The Knowledge of Languages. 2. Pagan
Theology. 3. History. 4. Poetry. 5. Rhetoric. 6. Jurisprudence, or the
knowledge of Laws: and we shall endeavor to evince the Traduction of each of
these from the Jewish Church and sacred Oracles.

. 2. The original of all words and languages from the Hebrew.
We shall begin with the knowledge of Languages, anciently styled Grammar, and
lately Criticisme; with endeavors to prove its original from the Hebrew
Language and Oracles. That all Languages and Letters were derived originally
from the Hebrew, or Jewish Tongue, is an Assertion generally owned, and
maintained by the most learned Philologists of this Age; and that not without
the consent of some of the Ancients, and learned Heathens. Plato tells us in
plain terms, that the Gods were the first Authors of Letters, and words; and
that they (the Grecians) received their Language from certain Barbarians more
ancient than themselves. Who could be no other than the Hebrews. Take his own
words ( Cratylus fol. 426. Edit: Steph.) thus, (...). The first names were
appointed by the Gods etc. Then he adds, how these names were conveyed down
from the Gods to us, (...). These names we received from certain Barbarians,
more ancient than our selves. Here Plato acknowledges, 1. God the first
Institutor of names, which by Adams miaistrie are imposed on things suitable to
their natures.
1. that the first (...), or institution of words, and letters was from God.
For as he at first gave Being unto things, and prescribed a certain Law as the
boundary or limits to their Nature, whereby they are differenced each from
other; so in like manner has he instituted certain Names, and affixed them as
appendents to the things themselves; thereby to represent their proper Natures,
Offices, peculiar Respects unto, and Differences from each other. For look as
our Conceptions are (...), the resemblances and images of things; so names and
words are the images both of our conceptions, and also of the things
themselves. Names are but pictures or images of things.
Thus much Plato frequently hints unto us, especially in his Gratylus, as fol.
430. (...). A name but the Ape, or, as it were, the picture of a thing: so fol
433. (...), a name is but the manifestation of a thing: Again, he says, (...);
a name is an instructive and discretive instrument of the essence. Whence that
of Aristotle, Rhet. lib. 3. cap. 3. (...). Names are imitates. So Arist. (...).
cap. 1. (...). There are in speech certain Symbols or notices of the Souls
passions, as in Scripture of things spoken. i.e. Look as in the mind, there is
a a certain (...) Character or Idea of things; so likewise in oration or
speech, there is a Character or Idea of the Mind; as also Scripture (...) does
characterize, and represent our speech. So that as the Mind gives us an Idea of
the thing; so speech of the mind, and Scripture of speech. Whence speech also
gives some adumbration of the thing it self. Answerable whereto is that of
Democritus, (...), Speech is the shadow of a work: as also that of Damascene
(...) external speech is the Messenger of the mind. By all which it appears,
that names are but pictures, shadows, or resemblances of things; so that as the
Natures of things are determined, and limited, so must the names likewise, by
which their Natures are expressed and represented, be: not as though the essences
of things should be pictured, or drawn to the life in words and names, which is
impossible; but that the (...), the sundry Respects and Affections of things,
should be expressed in their names. For, as it is observed, things have a kind
of (...) and (...) speech, figure, and color, which ought to be expressed by
their names; How words and names are from nature? and how from Institution?
which has made some conceive that words and names are appointed vi Naturae,
even from the Institution and Law of Nature: not, as words and names are now
confusedly used by several Nations, but according to Gods first Institution,
when all Languages were but one, and names were by Adam, according to Divine
appointment, given unto things proportionable to their respective Natures, and
operations; so that the image, picture, and face of the thing, might be
discovered in the name. This is, or should be the aim of all such as impose
names on things. So Ammonius on the Categor. page 16. (...) Men agreeing
together by common accord amongst themselves, impose a proper name on every
thing; having regard to this only, how they may by speech, represent things to
others. Thus we see how, according to Plato's mind, words and names had their
original, both from, at least conformable unto, Nature; as also by Institution.
Hence likewise it appears, how God may be said to be the first (...) Institutor
of names; namely as Adam, by his appointment, and special inspiration, gave
names, suitable to the Natures of things: Genesis 2.19.
according to Genesis 2.19. This is the first (...), rectitude of words, which (as
Plato here observes) God instituted by the ministry of Adam, that great
Naturalist, who imposed names on things, proper and fitted to their Natures.
That all languages were derived from the Hebrews called by Plato Barbarians.
But 2. Plato in the forementioned citation, expressly avoucheth, that they (the
Grecians) received their names and language from certain Barbarians, more
ancient than themselves. He affirmed, that the first (...) Institutor of names
was God; but he also affirms, that the conveyance of those names and words to
them, was by certain Barbarians etc. That these ancient Barbarians were no
other than the Hebrews, will seem more than probable, if we consider what Moses
testifies of the whole earth Genesis 11.1. Genesis 11.1.
And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. This Language was,
without doubt, the Hebrew; whence the Greek, and all other Languages received
their derivation; as we shall hereafter prove. And that Plato refers hereto, is
affirmed by Serranus, on these words of Plato fol. 380. By the appellation of
one language (says he) is signified the Hebrew tongue, as Plato seems to
acknowledge, who conceling the name of the Jews, does yet ingenuously deny the
primitive antiquity to his Grecians: ( as in his Timaeus he openly confesses
that all the Grecians were children.) And this he does here now and then
inculcate, that the right account of names or words is to be fetched from the
Barbarians, as the more ancient. Now by the name of Barbarians, Justin Martyr,
Clemens Alexandrinus, Epiphanius and Nicephorus under stand the Jews. Thus
Serranus. So that, this second rule which Plato gives for the right
interpretation of names or words, is, that they be derived from the Barbarian
language more ancient than their own; whereby we cannot, rationally, understand
any other than the Hebrew, as it will farther appear when we come to
particulars.

. 3. That the Hebrew was the first unick language.
That the Hebrew was, according to Genesis 11.1. The original language, whence all
others were derived, is excellently demonstrated to us by learned Bochart, in
his Phaleg. lib. 1. cap. 15. where he proves 1. That before the building of
Babel there was but one language, Genesis 11.1.
and that according to the acknowledgment of Heathens, as Abydenus in Eusebius,
and Cyrillus, and the Sibylle in Josephus. 2. That this one original language
was the Hebrew; as we are taught by the Chaldee Interpreter, R. Selomo, Aben
Ezra, and the Cabalists in Gematria; as amongst the Fathers by Jerome and
Austin. Farther that the Hebrew tongue was of all most ancient, he proves from
the Etymology of the names extant in the History of Moses, from the Creation
of the world to the Dispersion of the Nations. So the Garden of Eden (...),
signifies with the Hebrews a garden of pleasures or delights. The land of Nod,
is called by the Hebrews (...) i.e. a land of banishment; because Cain was
banished thither. So Babel (...) Confusion, (...) Adam, (...) Eva, (...) Cain
etc. thus Bochart fol. 57.3. Hence he proceeds to show us, how God, at first,
instituted the Hebrew Tongue, as also the several derivations thence. In the
Creation (says he) God inspired into Adam and Eve, the first moment in which
they were created, the knowledge of the Hebrew Tongue; that so they might
understand the Language of God conversing with them, as also enjoy mutual
conference and conversation amongst themselves. This same power of God shone
forth also in the confusion of Languages, which God only introduced. Genesis 11.7.
confound their Language. Genesis 11.7.
Thus Bochart Phaleg. l. 1. c. 15. fol. 59. This Assertion, touching the
Traduction of all Languages from the Hebrew, Ut nosse possimili^guam Hebraicam
omnium linguarum esse matricem. Hier^nym. Comment. in Sophon. 3.18.
I find again laid down by Bochart, in his Preface to his second part called
Canaan, fol. 11. thus: moreover, according to the writings of the Prophets,
there is nothing that will bring more Authority and Majesty to the Hebrew
Tongue, than if it be taught, that from it sprang, almost what ever was any
where most ancient, even amongst the nations most remote from the Jews etc,
Thus Fosterus in Praefat. Lex: It is, says he, the huge glory and felicity of
this (Hebrew) Tongue beyond others, that it begges or borrows nothing from
other tongues, but other tongues borrow many words from this. see Collatio
linguarum quatuor principalium a Crucigero.

. 4. The original of Hebrew Letters and the derivation^ thence from Moses.
Having demonstrated the priority of the Hebrew Tongue, and the derivation of
all other Languages thence; we now proceed to the original of the Hebrew
Letters, and Scripture, with the Traductions thence. Concerning this, we have
this good account in Austin, and Ludovicus Vives on him. August: de civit: Dei
lib. 18. cap. 39. speaks thus. There is no nation therefore, that may boast it
self touching the Antiquity of its wisdom, beyond our Patriarchs, and Prophets;
in whom there was a Divine wisdom -- But the Hebrew Letters began from the Law
given by Moses etc. Lud: Vives on these words [the Hebrew Letters] speaks thus:
The vulgar opinion, both of our Christians, and the Hebrews is; that the Hebrew
Letters, had Moses for their Author: which Eupolemus, and Artapanus, and other
profane writers do assert; who deliver, that Moses was the most wise of men,
and the Inventor of Letters, which he delivered over to the Jews, from whom the
neighboring Phenicians received them, and the Grecians, by Cadmus, from the
Phenicians. Moreover the same Artapanus believes, that Moses gave Letters to
the Egyptians; Moses under the name of Mercury is said to give Letters to the
Egyptians
and that Moses was that Mercury, ( for so the Egyptians call him) who, as it
is manifest amongst all the Latin and Greek Authors, taught the Egyptians
Letters. But if any inquire, in what Letters that wisdom of the Egyptians,
wherein we read Moses was instituted, was contained, he shall peradventure,
find that it was delivered by vocal Tradition, and was preserved in the memory
of Teachers and Learners. If there were at that time any Letters, they were no
other than forms, or images of beasts, which they called (...), Hyeroglyphick
Letters, i.e. Letters engraven in sacreds. Philo the Jew refers the Invention
of the Hebrew Letters to Abraham, but these Letters, seem to have been many
years before Abraham for Josephus Antiquit. 1. declares, that by the sons of
Seth, the son of Adam, there were erected two pillars, the one of stone, the
other of brick whereon they engraved the Arts by them invented, and that the
column of stone remained in Syria, even unto his time. Thus touching the
several opinions about the Invention of Letters: whereof the first seems most
probable; namely, that their original was from Moses. The Testimony of
Eupolemus, we find in Clemens Alexandrinus, Strom: lib. 1. (...): They say,
that Moses was the first wise man; and that he first delivered Grammar or
Letters to the Jews; and that from the Jews the Phenicians received them; as
the Grecians from the Phenicians. Plato in his Philebus, and Phedrus, contends,
that the first Inventiou of Letters was in Egypt, by Theuth: who whether he
were a God or man, is doubtful. That this Theuth, who by the Ancients, is
supposed to have been the Inventor of Letters, was the same with the Egyptian
Mercury, I conceive, will not be doubted by any versed in Antiquity. So Cicero
de nature. Deor: lib. 3. Whom the Grecians call Mercury, the Egyptians call
Thoith: that is Theuth. So Eusebius: praepar. Evang: lib. 1. cap. 6. produces out
of Philo Byblius, that Mercury was called by the Egyptians Thoith; who also was
the Inventor of Letters. Now that Mercury, or, as the Egyptians style him,
Thoith, or Theuth was the same with Moses, is affirmed by Artapanus, in
Eusebius, praepar: Evang: lib. 9. c. 4. Whom the Hebrews call Moses, the Greeks
style Musaeus, and the Egyptians Mercury: I am not ignorant, that many apply
the name of Mercury, or Theuth unto Joseph, who was esteemed as a God amongst
the Egyptians, and worshipped under the Hieroglyphick of Apis etc. But yet we
must remember, that the same names were, upon differing accounts, attributed to
differing persons: as the name of Saturn was, by some attributed to Adam, and
by others to Noah; they being both, in some respect, the first Heads and
Parents of mankind. So the name Mercury or Theuth, was given to Joseph, as he
was a person divinely inspired for the interpreting of dreams etc. and the same
name was given unto Moses, as the Inventor of Letters etc. Hence Mercury
passed for the God of Learning; because he was supposed to have been the Author
of Letters. Cyrillus lib. 1. against Julian, relates out of Artapanus, that
there was a rod preserved in the Temple of Isis, and worshipped as a monument
of Moses. The same is testified by Eusebius lib. 9. de praepar. Evang. cap. 4.
The Hebrews under the name of Syrians are said to convey Letters to the
Phenicians.
To which agrees that of Pliny lib. 7. cap. 56. I judge (says he) that Letters
were of an Assyrian (i.e. Jewish) origination: but others conceive that they
were found out amongst the Egyptians by Mercury, as Gellius; others amongst
the Syrians. However, they were brought into Greece out of Phaenicia by Cadmus,
being in number at first but sixteen. Hence Eusebius, de praepar, Evang: lib.
10. cap. calls them (...) Phenician Letters, as hereafter. Whereas it is said,
that the Syrians were the first Inventors of Letters; that hereby we must
understand, not the Syrians properly so styled or Phenicians, but the Hebrews,
is evident from what we find to this purpose in Diodorus Siculus lib. 5. (...).
The Syrians are said to be the Inventors of Letters, and from these the
Phenicians learnt them. Where, opposing the Phenicians to the Syrians, it is
manifest, that by the Syrians can be meant no other than the Hebrews; from whom
the Phenicians received their Letters, as the Hebrews from Moses: so Owen de
Theolog. lib. 4. Digres. 1. page 301. I doubt not (says he) but to affirm,
that it may be demonstrated by arguments worthy of belief, that there was no
use of Letters, properly so called, more ancient than the Mosaic [(...)]
Institution of Laws: wherefore I do altogether acquiesce in the opinion of
Eupolemus, that Moses first delivered Letters to the Jews etc.. To which we may
add that of Mariana the Jesuit, in his Preface to his Annotations on Genesis;
where he speaks thus: And truly Moses was the first who invented Letters,
notes of prolation or discourse comprehended (even unto great wonderment) under
22 literal characters, out of which all words, which are innumerable, are
composed. I treat n ot now of Hieroglyphick Letters, which are notes of things:
nor of prolation, or words, more ancient than those Letters which Moses
invented. Thus Mariana.

. 1. The origination of the Hebrew.
HAving given some general account of Languages, Names, and Letters with their
derivation from the Hebrew; we now proceed to particulars. And first, as for
the origination of the word Hebrew, whence it sprang, its not determined
amongst the Learned. Daille in his French Sermons on Philip. chapter 3. v. 5. Ser.
3. supposes the Hebrew to be so called from (...) he passed; and so common, at
first, to all such who passed the river Euphrates; as hereafter. But the more
probable opinion is that of Bochart, in his Phaleg. lib. 2. cap. 14. fol. 104.
where he proves, that the name Hebrew had its original from Heber Genesis 10.25.
Genesis 10.25.
the father of Phaleg, so called from the confusion of Languages. Thus also
Owen de Theol. lib. 3. cap. 2. page 172. The Hebrews (says he) were so called
because they were the sons of Heber. The reason of the name is very easy to be
understood. All the Nations of the Cananites were distinguished amongst
themselves by Sirnames, assumed from the most known Authors of their families,
mentioned by Moses Genesis 10.15. etc. Genesis 10.15. etc.
where this is called an Amorite, that a Jebusite etc. Abraham living amongst
them from Heber (the famous Head of the Family whence he sprang) was called an
Hebrew; by which Patronymick name, he and his Posterity were distinguished from
all the Posterity of Cham. Thus Owen, who also adds lib. 4. cap. 2. We have
showed that the Tongue used by Abraham, was the same with that of the first
men, and that it was at length, from Heber, called Hebrew. The purity of the
Hebrew 'till the captivity.
This was kept pure and uncorrupted by his Posterity; who traveled through
many parts of the East, where were many Dialects in use, especially the
Syriack. This appears by the distinction the Scripture observes betwixt the
speech of Laban the Syrian and Jacob, as Genesis 31.47. Genesis 31.47.
where Laban makes use of the Syriack. This Hebrew continued, even after the
confusion of Languages at Babel, in its native purity, and simplicity, until
the Babylonian Captivity. So Bochart Phaleg lib. 1. cap. 15. fol. 59. where
showing that Babylon had ever been fatal to the Hebrew, he affirms: that where
as the Hebrew Tongue had flourished from the Creation of the world even unto
the Babylonian Captivity almost 3040 years; it then ceased to be vulgar, or at
least, it much degenerated from its ancient purity. For the Jews, upon their
return from the Captivity, infected the Hebrew Language with the admistion
partly of the Chaldee, partly of the Syriack, and partly of the Philistin Idiom
etc. Thus also Owen Theolog. lib. 3. cap. 2. As the Hebrews by little and
little deflected from the true worship of God, so by little and little they
lost the purity of their Language etc.

. 2. The Phenician Tongue the same for substance with the Hebrew.
We shall begin with the Phenician Language, which endeavors to demonstrate its
derivation from, and Cognation, yea indeed samenes for substance with the
Hebrew. This I find excellently well done to my hand by Learned Bochart; to
whom I shall also add the Symbols or consents of other Learned men. That the
Phenician Tongue was the same with the old Hebrew see Jo: Scaliger in what
follows.. 4.
Bochart Canaan lib. 2. cap. 1. fol. 776. lays down his Hypothesis thus What I
have hitherto in this whole tractation laid down, that the Phenician Tongue is
very near akin to the Hebrew; seems demonstrable by manifold Reasons. His
Arguments follow. The Affinity of the Phenician with the Hebrew 1. From the
names of places in Canaan.
His 1. Reason, for the Affinity of the Phenician with the Hebrew Tongue, is
taken from the Names of places in the land of Canaan, which were of Hebrew
import, and that before the Israelites departed from Egypt; as it appears by
the books of Moses and Joshua, who lay down the same Names of places, as they
were in use amongst the Cananites, only with a change of the flexion, as in a
different Dialect. Thus fol. 776. 2. The Hebrews and Canananites (...).
2. It appears from Scripture, that the other people, neighbors to the Jews,
namely the Egyptians, Syrians, Babylonians, Ammonites, Moabites, Philistines
etc. were (...) differing in Language: Thus in Josephus the Amalekites and
Mideanites are styled. But now, no such thing is mentioned of the Cananites: On
the contrary, Rahab, a woman of Canaan, and the spies sent by Joshua, confer
together as (...) of the same Language. So Bochart fol. 777. 3. The Hebrew the
Language of Canaan. Esa. 19.18.
3. Neither is it a light Argument, that the Hebrew Language is called the
Language of Canaan Esa. 19.18. and in Chaerilo, Josephus supposed (...) the
Phenician Tongue to be the Hebrew. And in Herodotus those Phenicians, who are
circumcised after the Egyptian manner, are the same with the Hebrews. And
Lucian uses the names Hebrew and Phenician promiscuously. Phenician words of
Hebrew origination.
4. In the Relics of the Phenician Tongue there are many names and words
purely Hebrew, which sufficiently demonstrate the Cognation or samenes of the
former with the latter. To begin with the Relics of Sanchoniathons history,
which was turned into Greek by Philo Byblius, the fragments whereof are to be
found in Eusebius Praeparat: Evang: lib. 10. cap. 3. where we find mention of a
Chaos (...) dark Chaos so called from (...) Genesis 1.5. Genesis 1.5.
this Chaos was called also by the Phenicians (...) which is the same with the
Hebrew (...) mod or mud, matter or slime. He gives us likewise an account of
many of their Gods which were evidently of Hebrew import, and original. So
making the Sun to be Lord of Heaven, he styles him (...), which is the same
with (...). Also his (...) is the same with (...): El with (...): Beel with
(...): Elohin with (...): Baetulia with (...): Myth ( Greek (...)) Pluto's
name, the same with (...) death. (...) Sydyk is the same with (...): Israel
with (...). as Bochart Can. lib. 2. cap. 2.

. 3. To these Phenician words collected out of Sanchoniathon, we may add many
others to be found scattered up and down in other Authors. As in Josephus the
Sun is styled at Emesa Elagabalus, from the Hebrew (...). So in Hesychius (...)
is rendered Lord; the same with (...): In Plutarch an ox is styled Thor, and
Alpha which are the same with the Hebrew (...) and (...). So Porphyrie tells us,
that his own name (...) signifies properly in the Phenician Tongue, a King,
which exactly answers to the Hebrew (...). Punick words of Hebrew origination.
Farther this very great Affinity, and for substance Identity 'twixt the
Phenician and Hebrew Tongue is very evident from those Remainders we have of
the Punick Language, which was originally the same with the Phenician. Thus
Grotius, in his Epist: ad Gallos Epist: 114. ( page 242) touching the identity
of the Punick with the Phenician, as also of both with the Hebrew, writes thus
to Salmasius. In this Letter my Salmasius, thou do rightly gather, that there
were Phenician words remaining in the Punick Language even unto Austins time.
This is taught us in Jerome by Alma (...), which (says he) signifies amongst
the Phenicians a Virgin, as also in Austin by Salus (...), which, he says,
^ignifies with the Phenicians Three. These things being thus, it is yet true
that Austin, who was skilled in the Punick, was ignorant of the Hebrew. Without
doubt; long custom had foisted many things into the Punick Tongue, which were
extrinsick thereto: and those very words which agree with the radical Letters
of the Hebrews, differ somewhat in the sound of the vowels and flexion; as it is
evident from Sena in Plautus. Thus Grotius. Yea this Affinity 'twixt the Hebrew
and Punick Tongue was long since observed. Mat. 6.24. Mammon.
Austin, expounding those words of Christ Mat. 6.24. says, that riches amongst
the Hebrews were called Mammon, conformable to the Punick name: for gain in the
Punick Tongue is styled Mammon. So again August: Sermon: 35. The Hebrew word
Mammon (says he) is akin to the Punick Tongue: for those Tongues are joined
together, by a certain vicinity of signification. So Bochart ( Can. lib. 2.
cap. 16.) tells us, that both in the Hebrew and Phenician Dialect, (...) Mammon,
or (...), often signifies riches; whence it is that Psalm. 37.3. the Greeks
render (...), instead of (...). The Radix is not, as some will, (...), but
(...), which signifies to wax rich. Moreover the Chaldees, as well as the
Punicks, put (...) for gain; which is frequently used in the Paraphrasts, for
the Hebrew (...): see an example Genesis 37.26. Thus Glassius ( Philolog. Sacr.
lib. 1. Tract. 4. Sect. 2. can. 5.) (...) Sir. (...) Mammona, some derive from
the Hebr. (...), which, among other things, signifies plenty of riches etc.
Again Austin, on John Tract 15. tells us, that anointed in Greek is Christus,
and in the Hebrew Messiah, whence also in the Punick Tongue Mess signifies
anointed. Mess is the same with (...): whence 1 Samuel 16.22. (...) anoint him
etc. But nothing does more evidently demonstrate the Identity of the Punick
Language with the Hebrew, Plautus's Paenulus explicated.
than that famous fragment of the Punick Tongue in Plautus's Paenulus, whereof
we have an excellent explication, and that according to the Hebrew form, given
us by learned Bochart in his Can. lib. 2. cap. 6. fol. 801. Where we find the
words of Plautus. N'yth alonim Valonuth etc. thus reduced, by Bochart, to the
Hebrew (...) Deos Deasque veneror, I worship the Gods and the Goddesses etc.
(...) (says he) is a particle of Prayer: (...) a note of the accusative case
following. The reason why alonim Valonuth must signify Gods and Goddesses, is
given us by Joseph Scaliger, in the Appendix to his Emendatio Temporum: where
we are told, that (...) amongst the Phenicians signifies God; as Philo Byblius
and Sisensa on this place have observed; that Alon in the Punick Tongue is God.
Thus this fragment of the Punick Tongue, mentioned by Plautus (which has so
much tortured Critics to interpret) is by Bochart reduced to, and explained by
the Hebrew; which is an evident demonstration, that the old Punick differed
not, in substance, from the Hebrew. Now that the Punick Language is the same
originally with the Phenician, I conceive, no one skilled in these Tongues, can
deny. And indeed the Cognation 'twixt the names Paeni or Puni, and Phaenices
declares the same. Besides it is a General Concession, that Carthage, the chief
seat of the Carthaginians, was founded by a Colonie of the Phenicians; from
whom also they received their Language.

. 4. The Phenicians Symbolizing with the Hebrews in Tongue, and why? Phil. 3.5.
Farther that the Phenician Tongue was the same originally with the Hebrew, may
be evidenced from the Phenicians, their symbolizing with the Hebrews in Names,
Customs, Country etc. Thus the Land of Phaenicia is called the Land of
Canaan, as before. And the name Hebrew was given to the Phenicians, as well as
to the Jews: so Daille on Phil. 3.5. Sermon. 2. This word, Hebrew has been in a
particular manner given to the people of Israel, although it seems, that at the
beginning, the Chaldeans called all those, who dwelt in in the Land of Canaan,
Hebrews; and the Egyptians acknowledged them as such; as you may easily
remarque by all those passages of Genesis, where this word is used. But the
Posterity of Israel having since occupied all this country of Canaan, whereof
the Inhabitants were called Hebrews, thence it came to pass, that the name
Hebrew was appropriated to the Israelites. Thus Daille. And Bochart Can. lib.
2. cap. 1. fol. 779. gives us the reason why this sacred Hebrew Tongue was, by
God, permitted to be in use amongst the profane Cananites or Phenicians; namely
for the benefit of the Patriarchs, that so their Peregrination in the Land of
Canaan, might be more tolerable and easy. Yet (says he) I will not content,
that the Cananites Dialect was, in all things, the same with the Hebrew: for
amongst the Hebrews themselves there were diverse Dialects: so Sibboleth and
Scibboleth Jud. 12.6. so the Levite was known by his speech, Jud. 18.3. and
Peter for a Galilean Mat. 27.73. But I shall conclude this Argument touching
the Phenician Tongue, its derivation from, and samenes for substance with the
Hebrew, with some Attestations of the Learned. Bochart, Phaleg. lib. 1. cap.
15. speaks thus: The 3d is the Language of Canaan, or the Phenician or Punick;
which was brought out of Phenicia into Africa, and possessed the whole
Country, even from Cyrene to Gades. In this Tongue Mochus the Sidonian writ of
Philosophy, and Sanchoniathon the History of the Phenicians, and that before
the Trojan wars. Srabo lib. 16. Eusebius. Praepar. lib. 1. Esa. 19.18.
Here it suffices to observe that the Hebrew Tongue, is called by Esaias the
Language of Canaan: Esa. 19.18. not only because the Jews possessed Canaan, but
also because the Language of Canaan and Hebrew were very near akin. Thence in
our fifth Book we shall, if God favor us, illustrate many places of Scripture
thence. So Boch. Canaan Praef. fol. 11. We take (says he) the Phenician and
Hebrew tongue almost for the same; because the Phenician is an Hebrew Dialect,
little unlike to its Prototype, as I prove by many particulars in a peculiar
book; wherein I have collected with great care, and endeavored to explicate, as
well from the Hebrew as from the neighboring Tongues, almost what ever there
remains of Phenicisme in the the writings of the Ancients, without excepting
Plautus, or the African names of herbs, which are found in Apuleius, and in the
Auctarie of Dioscorides; which have hitherto so much vexed the most Learned. To
this of Bochart we might add also that of the Learned Ger: Vossius, de Histor.
Graecis lib. 2. cap. 16. where he asserts: that the Phenician Tongue differs
from the Hebrew only in some Dialect: and he instanceth in Porphyrie's name
Malchus, which, as he himself confesses, in his own Phenician Tongue signifies
a King, as the Hebrew (...) does. That the Phenician Tongue was the same
originally with the Hebrew, is also asserted and proved by learned Joseph
Scaliger Animadvers. in Eusebius. Chron. ( fol. 51. edit. 1658) thus: We know
therefore that the Phenicians spoke originally the Language of the Cananites,
which was mere Hebrew. This is attested, as by other things, so by the Relics
of Philo Byblius -- who shall deny that (...) is the same with (...)? etc. as
in the Appendix to our book de Emend. Temporum. The like he adds fol. 111. of
which see what follows chap 12.. 3. See also Grotius Epist. 113. ad Gallos page
237. and Breerwoods Inquiries cap 7. page 52-57. But more particularly, Owen
Theol. lib. 3. cap. 2. tells us, that the Phenician or Syrian Tongue received
its original from the Hebrew, and not the Hebrew from the Syrian; as all, who
understand any thing in their Analogy, acknowledge; as also the Purity and
Simplicity of the Hebrew Tongue proclaims etc. so lib. 4. cap. 2.

. 5. Of the Egyptian Hicroglyphicks.
But to pasle to the other oriental Languages, which differ little or nothing,
save in Dialect, from the Hebrew. We shall begin with the Egyptian Language,
which was twofold, Symbolick and Hieroglyphick; or Simple. Touching their
Symbolick mode of discourse and writing, we find a good account in Clement.
Alexandrin. (...). l. 5. They (says he) who are taught by the Egyptians, learn
first the method of all Egyptian Letters, which is called, (1.)
Epistolographick: (2.) Hieratick, used by those who write of Sacreds: (3.) the
last and most perfect is Hieroglyphick; whereof one is Curiologick, the other
Symbolick: of the Symbolick; one is properly spoken by imitation: another, as
it were, tropically; another does allegorize by Enigmes etc. These (...)
Hieroglyphick Letters, were images of beasts etc. engraven principally for
sacred use. We find some mention hereof in the fragments of Orus, that most
ancient writer. And indeed this ancient mode of setting forth things worthy
memory, by Hieroglyphick notes or Symbols, was very common amongst the
Ancients, (in those oriental parts, especially) both Poets and Philosophers;
and exceeding proper for that infant state of the world, wherein knowledge was
so rude and impolite. And we need no way doubt, but that this Symbolick kind of
Discourse or Language, had its original from the Divine Oeconomie, which God
prescribed his Church, consisting of many terrene Images and sensible forms,
for the shadowing forth heavenly Mysteries. Which way of conveying, and
preserving Knowledge is not only helpful to the Memory, grateful to the fancy,
and judgment, but also very efficacious for the moving of Affections. Thus
were the greatest pieces of Jewish Wisdom couched under the covert of Symbols
and Types: whence the Egyptians and other Nations borrowed their Hieroglyphick
and Symbolick Wisdom, and Fables, which Pythagoras etc. brought into Greece.
But more of this Par. 2. B. 1. of Egypt. Philos.

As for the simple Language of the Egyptians, and its Affinity with the Hebrew,
we have some discoveries thereof in Scripture Egyptian names. So Joseph's
Egyptian name, given him by Pharaoh Genes. 41.45. Zophnat-paaneach, Genesis 41.45.
seems evidently to evince an Affinity 'twixt the Hebrew and Egyptian Tongue:
for Zophnat seems to have Cognation with the Hebrew (...), which signifies to
concele, or keep secret: whence this Egyptian name is rendered by the Chaldee
(...) the man to whom secrets are reveled. So Josephus renders it (...) a
searcher of secrets. And Theodot. (...) an Interpreter of things ineffable: which
agrees with the Hebrew, as Glassius de Grammat. S. lib. 4. Tract. 3. obser, 14.
de Nomine proprie. But we have a more full Demonstration of the Cognation
'twixt the Hebrew and Egyptian Language in Bochart, Phaleg lib. 1. cap. 15. The
fourth, says he, is the Egyptian Tongue, of which Psalm. 81.5. Ps. 81.5.
When he went out of the Land of Egypt, where I heard an unknown Tongue. And
Ps. 114.1. Ps. 114 1.
When Israel went forth of Egypt, and the house of Jacob from a people (...)
barbarous, i.e: of a strange Language. Thence Esaias prophesies, that five
Cities of Egypt, should, for the Egyptian, speak the Language of Canaan. Esa.
19.18. Es. 19 18.
And Joseph, dissembling himself to be an Egyptian, speaks to his brethren by
an Interpreter: Whence they, speaking among themselves, thought he understood
them not. Genesis 42.23. Thus by way of objection,

The Cognation 'twixt the Egyptian and Hebrew.
To which Bochart thus replyeth. Yet notwithstanding because the Egyptians were
neighbors to the Jews, I no way doubt, but that the Hebrew and Egyptian
Language had some things common; from the collation whereof, some light may
arise. For example: it is demanded, why Egypt, or part of Egypt is, in the
Psalms, and Esaias called (...) Raab? Psa. 87.4. and 89.10. Esa. 51.9.
Here Interpreters are much at a loss; being ignorant that the Hebrew Raab is
the same with the Egyptian Rib or Eiph; by which name Delta, or the triangular
part of Egypt, comprehended in the mouths of Nilus, is at this day called, from
the form of a Pear: for that was properly Rib. Again Interpreters hesitate
about the name (...) Channa Ps. 80.15. Ps. 80.16.
Whereof I find seven versions at least, and those, many of them, most remote.
I render it (...) the plant, out of the Egyptian Tongue, in which the Ivy is
called (...), i.e. (...) the plant of Osiris; according to Plutarch: in Iside.
The Psalmist having a little before said, that God had transplanted a vine out
of Egypt; touching the same vine, he subjoyns: O God etc. visit this vine (...)
Vechanna i.e. and the plant which thy right hand has planted. He uses an
Egyptian word, because he treats of a vine translated out of Egypt. From the
same Tongue is derived the name of Joseph, which Pharaoh imposed on him, (...)
Tsaphnath Paaneach Genesis 41.45. Genesis 41.45.
The LXX, who published their version in Egypt, write it (...): i.e. the
Interpreter of secrets, or Reveler of futures. Consult of this Amama in Genes.
and Kirchir. Prodr. Copt. c. 5. Also (...) Sohar a prison Genesis 39.20. is
supposed by Abenezra to be an Egyptian word, and that from Moses's
Interpretation. And Moses, or Moses, if we may believe Philo, and Josephus,
and Clem. Alexandrinus, signifies among the Egyptians; one preserved out of the
waters: which answers to the Hebrew origination. So the Egyptian word Rephan,
or Remphan, still in use amongst the Coptites, (whose Language is composed
partly of the Greek, and partly of the old Egyptian etc.) of which see more
Book. 2. chap. 2.. 8. To these we might add many other Egyptian names and
words, which seem to have evident cognation with, and so derivation from the
Hebrew. As Amun, Jupiters name, whom the Egyptians so styled, from Cham, whence
the Grecians called him (...), as Vossius. Idolatr. l. 1. c. 17. So the
Egyptian Neel (whence by the Elision of (...) came Nilus) seems evidently the
same with the Hebrew (...) Naal or Neel: Glass. Gramm. S. l. 4. Tract. 3. Obs.
13.
as Fuller and Glassius after him have observed. The like might be proved of
the Egyptian Gods: as Horus from (...) light, or the Sun: Apis from (...) a
Father etc. of which hereafter.

Thus much for the Cognation 'twixt the Hebrew and Egyptian Language. And for a
more full Solution of the objection above mentioned from Ps. 81.5. and 114.1.
etc. which places seem to imply an Essential difference 'twixt the Hebrew and
Egyptian Language; Whether there be an essential difference 'twixt the Egyptian
and Hebrew?
it may be answered, 1. that a different Dialect in Languages originally the
same, is sufficient to constitute such a difference, as that the persons to
whom each Dialect belongs, may not understand each other, when they discourse.
This is evident from the Syrian or Chaldee Language: which, as it is generally
confessed among the Learned, is but a different Dialect of the Hebrew; and yet
the vulgar Jews did not understand it: as it appears from 2 Kings 18.26. Then
said Eliakim etc. speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian Language,
(for we understand it) and talk not with us in the Jews Language, in the ears
of the people that are on the wall. The like may be instanced in other
Languages, wherein different Dialects render their discourses unintelligible.
2. We may grant, that the Egyptian Language was somewhat a more remote
derivation from, and yet originally the same with the Hebrew.

The Original of the Coptick.
As for the Coptick or latter Egyptian Language, it was composed out of the old
Egyptian and Greek Tongue. For after Alexander's death, Egypt becoming the
chief Seat of the Grecian Empire, this gave the first occasion and rise to the
combination of the old Egyptian with the Grecian Language. Inter Coptitas,
quorum lingua partim ex Graeca, partim ex veteri Aegyptia conflata est Bochart
Phaleg. l. 1. c. 15.
But that which gave the greatest advantages to this commixture of the Egyptian
and Greek Tongue, was the famous Schole of Alexandria (erected by Ptolemy
Philadelphus) whether all the Virtuosi or great Wits of Greece had recourse for
their Institution in Philosophy, which flourished no where so much as in this
famous Schole. Thence the Greek Tongue being most in fashion, not only in this
Schole, but throughout Egypt, and so by little and little incorporating with
the old Egyptian, both concur to the production of the Coptick or new Egyptian
Tongue. See more of the Coptick Tongue, Kircher. Prodr. Copt. and Walton
Introduct. ad Ling. Oriental.

. 6. The Azotian Language from the Hebrew.
Next unto the Egyptian, we shall mention the Azotian or Philistine Language,
which is supposed to be a middle between the Egyptian and Hebrew. So Bochart
Phal. lib. 1. cap. 15. The fifth is the Azotian Language concerning which, see
Nehem. 13.24. Neh. 13.24.
And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in
the Jews Language etc. To this Language of Ashdod called Azotick ( i.e. the
Tongue of the Philistines, of whom the Azotians were part) agrees that which
Hiron. in Esa. l. 7. writes of the Cananitish Tongue, that it is a middle
Language 'twixt the Egyptian and Hebrew. For the Philistines came out of Egypt,
and occupied part of the land of Canaan. Also Dagon, the God of the Azotians,
derives his name from the Hebrew (...) Dagan, which signifies bread corn. So
Philo Byblius, out of Sanchoniatho, (...). Dagon because he found out bread
corn, and the plough, is called Jupiter Arotrius. So the Gazeans God, called
Marnas is merely Syrian or Phenician: for (...) Marnas, among the Syrians,
signifies the Lord of men. Also Baalzebub, the appellation of the Accaronitish
Idol, is plainly Hebrew, signifying the Lord of a fly, or (...). Urania Venus
among the Ascalonites, concerning whom Herodotus in Clio speaks, is called by
the Hebrews Astaroth i.e. Astarte from the care of the flock 1 Samuel 31.10.
Itaque verum est quod diximus Azotiam, vel quod idem est Philistaeorum linguam
Hebrae^ suisse affinem. Bochart Phal. l. 1. c. 15.
So in like manner Saran (...), which often occurs in the books of Joshua,
Judges, and Samuel, for the Philistine Prince, seems to be derived from the
Hebrew (...) Sar. And Abimelec, a name common to the ancient Philistine Kings
Genesis 20. and 21. and 26. is notoriously Hebrew. Also many names of the
Philistine Cities are apparently Hebrew. Whence Bochart concludes: It is
therefore true, what we have affirmed, that the Azotian or Philistine Tongue is
akin to the Hebrew.

. 7. The Chaldee, its origination from the Hebrew.
As for the ancient Chaldee and later Syriack; they are both evident
derivations, and very little different from the Hebrew. Touching the old
Chaldee, we have many fragments of it in Ezra, Jeremiah, and Daniel. as Ezra
4.7. unto chapter 6.15. and 7.12. unto 26. So Jerem. 10.11. and Dan. 2.4. unto v.
8. In the Scripture it is styled the Aramean i.e. the Syrian Language; also
(...) the Tongue of the Chaldeans Dan. 1.4. Others style it the Assyriack
Language. We have an ancient Specimen of this Tongue Genesis 31.34. where the same
place is called by Laban in the Chaldee (...) Jegar Sahadutha, i:e: a monument
of writers; and by Jacob in Hebrew (...) Galed, or, according to the common
pronunciation, Galaad, which signifies the same. It Is true, the Vulgar Jews
understood not this Language (which often happens in differing Dialects of the
same Language) as it appears from Jerem. 5.15. 2 Kings 18.26. Yet the more
Literate Jews, as Eliakim with the rest 2 Kings 18.26. understood the same;
which argues its Cognation with the Hebrew. This is farther demonstrable from
the several Chaldee Names of Gods, men, places etc. mentioned in the
Scriptures. As Bell Esa. 46.1. (...) from (...) el, Gods name (not from (...)
baal the Phenician God, as many conjecture, but upon a mistake) as Bochart
informed me. And Adad from the Hebrew (...) Achod Esa. 66.17, if not from
(...). Likewise Ur, a City of Chaldea, is evidently the same with the Hebrew
(...) Ur which signifies Light and fire. Whence this City is so called Gen:
21.31. from the Sun, which was worshipped here under the Symbol of sacred fire:
of which more hereafter. Touching the Chaldee Tongue, its original, Affinity
with, and difference from the Hebrew, see Walton in Bibl. Polyglot. Praeleg:
12. De Lingua Chaldaica.

. 8. The Syriack.
As for the Syriack, it sprang up, after the Babylonian Captivity, from the
complexion or combination of the Hebrew and Chaldee: Post Captivitatem ex
Hebraismi cum Chaldaismo mistione natus est tertius sermo, qui ad Haebraeum ita
accedit ut Chaldaeo sit multo propior. Hebraicum tamen passim appellant
Evangelistae, quia Hebraeorum erat sermo: nos hodie Syrum vocamus. Hoc fermone
Jesum Christum, and Apostolos loquutos, Constat. Bochart Phaleg. lib. 1. cap.
15.
and though it inclines more to the Chaldee, yet was it derived originally from
the Hebrew; as it appears by those many Fragments we find of it in the New
Testament. So Racha Mat: 5.22. Sir. (...), signifies either (...) (as
Theophylact) from (...) Hebr (...) he spues forth; or a vain emty fellow, one
void of wit, from the Hebrew (...) in Hiphil (...) he makes void: as Frantzius
de Interp: Scrip: orac: 129. Again Mammon Mat. 6.24. Luke 16.9,16. Mat. 6.24.
Luke 16.9.16.
Gr: (...): Sir: (...) Mammona, owes its derivation either to the Hebrew (...),
which among other things, signifies plenty of riches; or to the Hebr: (...) he
is firm or strong. So Maranatha 1 Cor: 16.22. 1 Cor. 16.22.
(...). which some read, in the Syriack, as one word: others read it (...)
Maharem Attha, be thou cursed: So it answers to the Hebr: (...) harem one kind
of malediction and excommunication. Others, more properly, read it (...) i:e:
our Lord comes; as Jude 14. (...): which was the highest degree of
excommunication: as if it should be said: The Church despaireth of this man's
Salvation, and therefore he is given up or remitted to the final judgment, at
the Lords coming. Both words are of Hebrew origination. Again, we find another
Syriack word John 5.2. John 5.2.
Bethesda. Sir. (...) i:e: the house of benignity. (...) Esda, in its proper
Syriack notion, sign fies reproach; but here, in composition, it imports
benignity, from the Hebrew (...) benignity, or mercy: This place is supposed to
be thus styled, from the benignity and mercy, which the Lord here manifested in
the curing of all diseases. Others read it (...), and so render it the house of
effusion; from the blood of the Sacrifices effused (which gave a medicinal
virtue to these waters) as Caninius, etc. or as others, because rainy waters
emptyed themselves into it: and so the Sir: (...) effusion, is derived from the
Hebr: (...). See more of this Anton: Kebrissensis in quinquagena sua cap: 5. of
Bethesda. To these we might add several other Syriack words used in the N: T:
as Corban, Mat: 27.6. Mat. 27.6. Mar. 7.11.
(...) Sir: (...) a gift or oblation: Hebr: (...), from (...) he drew near, and
in Hiphil, he offered. And Mark 5.41. Mar. 5.41.
(...) Sir: (...), from (...), or (...) an infant, child, or young person, and
(...). So Mark 7.34. (...) Ephphatha, Sir: (...), from the Hebrew (...). Thus
Apoc: 16.16. Apocal. 16.16.
We find (...) Armageddon; which is variously explained by Interpreters: but
that of Drusius seems most commodious; who supposes the name to be composed of
(...) Arma, which ^ignifies destruction (by which name the Jews called the
City, wherein they destroyed the Cananites, Numb: 21.3.) and (...) or (...)
geddon contracted, i:e: Their Army. So Act. 1.19. Act. 1.19.
(...) Aceldama Sir: (...), from the Hebrew (...) blood and (...) a field.
Lastly we find a whole sentence, taken from Ps: 22.1. and expressed in Greek
Characters Mat. 27.46. Mat. 27.46.
Mark: 15.34. Mark. 15.34.
thus (...), Eloi Eloi lamma sabachthani: which are all Syriack words of Hebrew
origination, and very little different from the Hebrew Text Ps: 22.1. for the
Syriack (...) answers to the Hebrew (...): and (...) is the same both in Hebr:
and Sir: and albeit the Syriack (...) answers not, in notion, to the Hebrew
(...), yet it is evidently Hebrew in its origination. By all which, it is
evident that the later Syriack (in use among the Jews after the Captivity, even
unto, and some while after Christ's time) though it has a mixture of Chaldee
with it, yet is it, for substance, Hebrew. Yea the Scripture calls it Hebrew: so
John 5.2. which is called in the Hebrew Tongue Bethesda: on which place
Glassius ( Philog: s. l. 1. Tract. 4. Sect. 2. can. 4.) observes; that the
Syriack Tongue was then vernacule to the Jewish Nation, and is called Hebrew by
reason of the Cognation it has with the Hebrew, the daughter attributing to her
self the mothers name. The like John 19.13. the Syriack Gabbatha is styled
Hebrew. Again v. 20. the Syriack Title, which Pilate wrote on the Cross, is
called Hebrew. Quotquo^ vocabula ex lingua tum illis vernacula citant
evangelistae sunt mere Syriaca. Bochart Phal. l. 1. c. 15.
So Acts 21.40. and 22.2. and 26.14. the Syriack is styled Hebrew; which
evidently expresses the Cognation, yea Identity 'twixt those two Languages:
for indeed the later was but a corrupt derivation from the former, as commix'd
with the Chaldee. So Seldom de Diis Sir. Prolegom. 2. As many of the Hebrews
(says he) did by little and little turn away from the true worship of God, so
also proportionably from the purity of their Language; whence sprang the
Chaldee Dialect, ( i:e: the Syriack.) I shall conclude this Discourse of the
Syriack with an excellent observation of Bochart, Phaleg: lib. 1. cap. 15. In
this Syriack Tongue (says he) there were various Dialects, as we may gather
from what the maid said to Peter Mark 14.70. (...), for thou art a Galilean,
and thy speech agrees thereto. Namely, the Galilean Dialect was much more
impure, as learned Buxtorf proves at large, in his Talmudick Lexicon on (...).
This Tongue is very necessary for Divines, because it is near the Hebrew; and
the Apostles borrowed not a few words from it. Not to mention the Chaldaick
paraphrases of the Old Testament, and the Syriack versions both of Old and N.
T. which are very ancient, and of great use, as daily experience teaches us.
The Syriack Tongue is now no where vernacule, save in some few towns about
Libanus. Of the Syriack, see more Walton in Bibl: Polyglot. Prolegm: 13. De
Lingua Syriaca etc.

. 9. The Arabic, its cognation with and derivation from the Hebrew
Next follows the Arabic, of which we find mention Acts 2.11. The original
whereof the Greek Fathers refer to Asarmoth, of which Gen: 10.26. The Arabes
themselves refer its original to their fater Iectan. Who ever was the first
Institutor of it, certain it is, that it was originally traduced from the
Hebrew. This is evident from those many Arabismes, which are found in the
Poetic books of Scripture; especially in Job. So Hieronymus, Praefat: in
Daniel asserts; that Job has much society with the Arabic Tongue. Thus also
Great Bochart Phaleg: lib. 1. cap. 15. And this, if God give it me, I hope,
some time to make manifest. This Arabic Tongue was in old times very obscure;
neither did it, for almost three thousand years, extend it self beyond the
limits of Arabia, until, with the Empire of the Saracens increasing about a
thousand years since, it began to propagate it self every way; so that now it
occupies almost a third part of the world as anciently known. It confers to the
Knowledge of the Hebrew much more than it is believed. Which we are taught by
the Hebrews Commentaries on the Scripture, who, when they hesitate, have
recourse to this Language, as to their sacred Anchor. Although they might have
observed many more things out of Arabisme, for the illustration of the sacred
text, if they had been more skilful in that Tongue. Out of the same^ Tongue,
there might much light accede to many Sciences; especially to Medicine, and
Geographie, and the Mathematics, if those Arabic books, which every where
throughout the oriental parts lie in MSS. were published. For it is well known,
that Arts, and Sciences have flourished among the Arabians, for almost six
hundred years; whilst amongst us rude Barbarism has reigned, and Literature
almost been extinct; Thus Bochart: who has since performed what he here
modestly promises, touching the Cognation 'twixt the Arabic and Hebrew
Language, in his elaborate and most learned book de Animalibus Sacris, wherein,
he corrects many vulgar opinions, touching Leviathan, which he interprets of
the greater Crocodile; the Unicorne, which he makes to be an Arabian Goat; the
Whale, which swallowed up Jonah, which he takes to be the dogge-fish called
Carcharias; with other sacred Animals Also Bochart interprets Behemoth of the
Seahorse.
; as also illustrates many difficult Scriptures out of the Arabic, from its
Cognation with the Hebrew. He was also pleased to favor me with some good
observations, touching the Arabic Language, in an oral conference I had with
him: namely, that we have but three Arabian writers more ancient than Mahomet;
which are Poets, whose books hang up, with Mahomet, in his Temple. Also that
Chimistry received its origination from the Arabians etc. Of the Arabic, its
Antiquity, Amplitude and Affinity with the Hebrew, see Walton in Bybl: Polygl.
Proleg. 14.

. 10 The Persick from the Hebrew
We now come to the Persick Language, with endeavors to demonstrate its
original derivation from the Hebrew. This seems manifest from many fragments of
Persian Names and Titles scattered in sacred and profane History. Strabo lib.
11. makes mention of (...) Amanus, the chief Persian God (whereby they
understood the Sun) which received its origination from the Hebrew (...) ama
the Sun or fire: From whence also sprang the Persian (...) amanim, which the
Greeks called (...) the sacred Hearths whereon their sacred Fire was
worshipped, as a Symbol of the Sun. This Amanus was called also by the Persians
Mithras, from (...) Mither, Great, as hereafter. We find farther notices of the
cognation 'twixt the Hebrew and Persick Languages, in those many Persick words,
extant in the books of Daniel, Ezra, and Esther; which contain stories of
things done under the Persians. So Esther 3.9. (...) ginze (or as the ancients
read it Ganze) hammelec, the Kings Treasuries, is of an Hebrew root, (as
Bochart Phal: lib. 1. c. 15. will have it) which the Persians at this day sound
(...) Ceniz. Thus likewise (...) paradise Nehem: 2.8. is supposed to be a
Persick word, as well as Hebrew. Also (...) Pur a lot, so often repeted in the
book of Esther, (whence the solemn feast of (...) purim amongst the Jews) as I
am apt to conjecture, had its origination from the Hebrew (...) Ur. That Ur of
Caldea had its derivation from the Hebrew (...) Or, or Ur, we doubt not but to
demonstrate in its place. Now its confessed by the Learned, that most of the
Persian Sacreds were traduced by their Magi, from the Chaldaick Zabii.
Herodotus l. 9. cap. 85. makes mention of a custom among the Persians, when
they went to sight, to cast a rope, with a gin at the top of it, on their
enemies, whereby, they being entangled, were drawn into their hands. Bochart
Phal. 4. c. 10.
From these gins or snares Bochart supposes the Sagartii, for Saragtii, a
people of Persia, were so called, from the Hebrew (...) or (...) Sarag, which
signifies both in the Syriack, Chaldee, and Arabic, as well as Hebrew, to
implicate and entangle. Thence the Syriack (...) Serig, the Arabic (...)
Sarga, and the Greek (...) 2 Cor. 11.33. signifying a basquet and net, had
their derivation. So in like manner from the Hebrew (...) Illustrious,
Magnificent, the Persick (...) of the same signification, had its origination;
whence the compounds (...) Ardschir Artaxerxes, and (...) Ardovan Artapanus
etc. which Hesychius expounds Great Illustrious: (...). So Herodotus Musa 6.
(...). Whence their ancient Heroes were called Artaei. Hesychius, (...): Such
were Artabazus, and Arbanus, and Artaphernis, and Artaxerxes etc. Yea the very
name Persa seems to be of Hebrew, and Arabic origination. For the Arabic
(...) pharas signifies an horse; and (...) pharis an horseman, from the Hebrew
(...): whence the Country was called (...) Paras, Persia: and the Inhabitants
(...) Persae i:e: Horsemen: they being taught, even from their childhood, to
ride the horse; which was their Glory. So Xenophon lib. 4. Cyropaediae. The
Persians of footmen being made horsemen, they so accustomed themselves to
horses, that (...) no good man among the Persians would willingly be seen to go
afoot. This Art of riding the horse, was first brought in fashion by Cyrus: for
(as the same Xenophon tells us lib. 1.) before Cyrus's time, it was very rare to
see an horse in Persia; it being a Country unfit for the breeding, as also for
the riding of horses, by reason of the mountains there. This Bochart gives as a
reason, why Moses, with the rest of the Penmen of Scripture, before Daniel and
Ezechiel, make no mention of the Persians under this name, but call Persia Cuth
and Elam: namely, because this name Persia was given it after Cyrus's bringing
up the Discipline of Horsemanship, whence the name (...) paras had its
origination, as Bochart Phal: lib. 4. cap. 10. Concerning the Persian Tongue,
its original, and use; together with the Persian versions of the Scripture, see
Walton, in Bibl: Polyglot: Proleg: 16. De Lingua Persica.

. 11. The original of the Samaritans, and their Language from the Hebrew
We now proceed to the Samaritan Language; to demonstrate its derivation from,
and cognation, or rather identity with the Hebrew. The original of the
Samaritans was briefly this. The ten Tribes falling off from Rehoboam (as 1
Kings 12. and 2 Chronicles. 10.) and chosing Jeroboam for their King, they
constitute Samaria the Metropolis of their Kingdom; where they had not long
seated themselves, but, by reason of their Defection from God, and corruptions
in Religion, were transported thence unto Babylon. Yet was there a remnant left
behind; unto whom there were sent, from Babylon, some Colonies of the
Cutheites, which incorporated with them; and in process of time, became one
body, not only as to Civils, but also as to Ecclesiastics. The occasion whereof
was this: these new Inhabitants, the Cutheites, being infested by Lions, were
willing to to be instructed by the Israelitish Priest, touching the true
Religion and worship of the Israelitish God. That this was the original of the
Samaritans, we are assured by Josephus Antiq. lib. 9. c. 20. and 12. c. 7.
These mixed Samaritans at first worshipped their Idols, as well as the true God.
Yet did they receive the Book of the Law, as written in the old Hebrew Letters.
After the return of the Jews from Babylon, there arose an implacable feud
'twixt them and the Samaritans; the rise whereof some make to be this. See more
of this Walton: in Bibls Polyglot. Proleg. 11.
The Samaritans lived under the Kings of Assyria, at first without giving any
molestation to the Jews, (yet were they in Religion (...), for what made most
for their interest) until Ezra, and Nehemiah, with the rest of Jewish Reformers
(who endeavored the reedifying of the Temple, and the restoring as well the
Ecclesiastic, as Politic Government) rejected their Assistance, and
Contributions. Which repulse these Samaritans (who pretended to worship the
same God with the Jews) received with so much indignation, as that they did
what they could, both by calumnies suggested to the Persian Kings, as also by
building the Garizitan Temple, to oppose, and undermine the zealous undertakings
of the Jewish Reformers: as Joseph Antiq: l. 11. c. 4. The Samaritans (says
he) accused the Jews that they fortified the City, and built a Temple more
like unto a Castle, than a Church: asserting also, that this made not for the
Kings interest etc. Hence sprang an inveterate hatred 'twixt the Samaritans and
Jews, as John 4.9. John. 4.9.
and that which added to it, was this; that many of the profligate Jews fled to
the Samaritans. The Jews and Samaritans contended before Ptolomaus Lagus
touching the Authority of their Temple. Hircaenus destroyed Samaria, and the
Garizitan Temple. Herod rebuildeth both one and the other. Yet the Samaritans,
despising Herod's Temple, chose rather to worship on a bare Altar in mount
Garizim; Walton in Bibl. Polygl. Prol. 11.
which some gather from the Words of the Samaritan Woman, John 4.20. our
Fathers worshipped in this Mountain etc. After the Garizitan Temple was
erected, the Samaritans, rejecting their Idols, worshipped one only God; and
had their Priests, at least as they pretended, out of the house of Aaron. Yet
they received only the Pentateuch or 5 books of Moses; because, when the ten
Tribes revolted from Rehoboam, the other books were few of them extant, and
those that were, not so common and received: besides, the Prophets were
generally very invective against the ten Tribes; which inclined them to reject
their Prophecies. The greatest specimen we have of the Samaritan Tongue, is in
the Samaritan Pentateuch; which is evidently the same, for substance with the
Hebrew. Yea some learned men make the Samaritan Character, the same to be the
old Hebrew; and the present Hebrew character, with the old Chaldean: whence
also they conclude, that the Grecian Alphabet was formed not out of the present
Hebrew character, but out of the Samaritan, by an inversion of the letters:
which Bochart also in a personal conference, acquainted me with: of which more
in the following chap. 12.. 3, 4.

. 12. Of the Ethiopick Tongue its cognation with and derivation from the
Hebrew. That Chus Ezech. 29.10. is ill expounded for Ethiopia see Ralegh Hist.
part 1. B. 1. c. 8.. 10.. 3.
As for the Ethiopick Language; we need say but little. Ethiopia, in the
Scripture, is described by the Land of Lud, (not of Chus as many versions upon
mistaken grounds have it) according to Bochart, Walton, Sr Walter Ralegh and
others. The Ethiopick Tongue has great Affinity with the Chaldean; and
therefore is by some, made the same with it. Scaliger attests, that the
Ethiopians call themselves Chaldeans; and that not without cause; because of
those many sacred and profane books, which they have, written in their most
elegant and ancient Tongue, so near akin to the Chaldee, or Assyriack. So
VVaserus ( in notis ad Gesn: Mithridat: cap. 2.) says, that the Ethiopick
Tongue is next unto the Chaldaick, and Assyrian, as also to the Hebrew; which
the Relics of the Christians brought into Ethiopia. Marianus Victorius (who
was the first that reduced the Ethiopick Tongue to rules of Grammar) in his
Proem: tells us, that the Ethiopians call their Tongue Chaldean, as that which
sprang from the Babylonick of Chaldea, and is very like to the Hebraick, from
which it derives its origination, as well as the Syriack, Arabic, and also
Babylonick, or Assyriack. Whence he concludes, that this Ethiopick Language may
easily be learned by those who are skilled in the Hebraick. Niceph. l. 9. cap.
18. relates, that in times long past, many Colonies wandered from Assyria unto
Ethiopia and so conveyed the Chaldee Tongue thither. The Affinity 'twixt the
Ethiopick Language, and the Chaldaick, as also the Hebraick, will easily appear
to any that shall confer the Ethiopick versions of the Psalms, and N. T. with
the Hebrew and Chaldee. Diodor. Sicul. lib. 4. affirms that the Ethiopians, at
first, had the same Letters with the Egyptians. Mariana Victorius makes three
Dialects of the Ethiopick Tongue, the Vernacule, the Babylonick, the sacred
etc. See more of this Walton in Bibl. Polyglot. Proleg. 15. de Lingua
Aethiopica.

CHAP. XII. European Languages, especially the Greek and Latin, from the Hebrew.
The Greek Tongue its original from the Hebrew. The Grecians received their
Letters, and Literature immediately from Cadmus, but originally from the
Phenicians and Hebrews. Arguments which prove the Traduction of the Greek
Letters from the Hebrew or Samaritan, by the Phenicians. Instances out of Plato
to make good the same. (...) darkness from (...) ereb night Genesis 1.5. (...) from
(...). (...) from (...) etc. The Latin immediately from the Greek, but
originally from the Hebrew. The proof hereof by instances, especially from
those verses of Virgil, Tityre tu patulae etc. the other European Languages
originally from the Hebrew. Several old Gallick, Britannick, and Saxon names of
Gods of Hebrew origination.

. 1. The Greek tongue its original from the Hebrew.
WE now proceed to the Grecian Language; to demonstrate its Traduction from
the Hebrew originally, though immediately from the Phenician. There is some
difference amongst the Learned about the immediate Parent of the Greek Tongue.
The Italian Kircher makes the Greek to be originally traduced from the old
Egyptian Language. But this is sufficiently refuted by learned Bochart Phaleg:
lib. 1. c. 15. where he shows, that this persuasion, of the Egyptian Tongue,
its being the old Matrice of the Greek, is but a dream of Kirchers; which may
be easily refuted from the ancient names of places in Egypt: as also from
Herodotus, and Plutarch, and Horus, and Iamblichus, with others; wherein you
may find a long series of Egyptian words, which savor not more of Grecisme,
than of the Illyrick, or German Language etc. Stillingfleet makes the Greek
Tongue to be derived, not from the Phenicians, but from the old Pelasgi: so
Stillingfleet Orgin. S. Book 3. chapter 4.. 11. The ground of the Affinity between
the Jews and Lacedaemonians was from the Pelasgi, whose chief seat was in
Arcadia, to which adjoyneth Laconia. Besides the Spartans were a part of the
Dorians, who sprang from the Pelasgi, and these from Phaleg, the son of Heber,
from whom Abraham and the Jews came, Genesis 11.17,20. -- The Hellens were not the
first Inhabitants of Greece, but the Pelasgi; who spread themselves over
Greece, and, being descended from Phaleg, brought with them the Hebrew Language
into Greece: whence an account may be given of many Hebrew words in the Greek
Language; which came not from the Phenicians as Bochartus, but the old Pelasgi.
So again Sect. 14. Having evidenced (says he) that the first Planters of
Greece were the Pelasgi; and these derived from Peleg, it will be easily
supposed, that the Language they brought with them, was the same with that used
in the family whence Phaleg came, as to the substance of it, namely the Hebrew,
which appears by many Hebrew words in the Greek, and the remainders of the
Eastern Languages in the Islands of Greece, both which came, not from Cadmus
and the Phenicians, as Bochartus thinks, but from the old Pelasgi. This learned
man here fully grants our conclusion; that the Greek had its Derivation from
the Hebrew; though he dislikes the medium of conveyance by the Phenicians. But
yet (under submission to the Learned) I see not any Demonstrative Arguments
against Bocharts Assertion. For grant, that the old Pelasgi were the first
possessors of Greece; yet it is generally confessed that the chiefest parts of
Greece were afterward possessed by the Phenicians, and peopled by their
Colonies; so that the Greek Tongue and Alphabet, may be justly said, to owe its
original perfection to Cadmus, and other Phenicians: as we have before Chap.
7.. 7. proved. (...) Plutarch.
We have also demonstrated, chap. 10.. 4. that there was no use of Letters more
ancient than the Mosaic Institution, according to that of Eupolemus in Clemens
Alexandrinus (...). lib. 1. They say that Moses was the first wise man, and
that he first delivered Grammar, or Letters to the Jews, and from the Jews the
Phenicians received them, as the Grecians from the Phenicians. That the
Phenicians had the knowledge and use of Letters before the Grecians, is plain
from that of Lucan, Phoenices primi, famae si credimus, ausi
Mansuram rudibus vocem signare figuris.


2. The Grecians received their Literature immediately from Cadmus.
That the Grecians had their Letters and Literature immediately from the
Phenicians, but originally from the Hebrews, is confirmed by the Authority of
the most learned; so Lud. Vives on August de civit. Dei l, 18. c. 39. It is
(says he) the common opinion both of Jews and Christians, that the Hebrew
Letters had Moses for their Institutor: which Eupolemus and Artapanus, with
other Heathen Authors assert, Inde (...) and (...) Laert.
who make Moses the first Inventor of Letters, which he delivered over to the
Jews, from whom their neighbors the Phenicians received them, and the Grecians
by Cadmus from the Phenicians etc. Herodotus lib. 5. cap. 58. speaks thus:
(...) etc. But the Phenicians, who came with Cadmus, as they brought other
Learning with them into Greece, so also Letters, which the Greeks had not
before. So Philostratus lib. 2. de vitis Sophistarum (...) Letters came from
the Phenicians. And Diodorus lib. 5. tells us, that the Phenicians received
these Letters from the Syrians, whereby we can understand no other but the
Hebrews: as before chap. 4.. 2. and c. 10.. 4. So Eusebius de praepar. Evang.
lib. 10. The first who delivered Letters was Cadmus; whence they called them
the Phenician Letters. There are some who affirm, that the Syrians first found
out Letters; but by the Syrians is meant the Hebrews. So Bochart Canaan lib. 1.
cap. 20. proves at large, that Cadmus, and those Phenician Colonies that came
with him, brought Letters into Greece. And indeed the Greek Letters themselves,
carry in them sufficient (...) or notices of their Phenician and Hebrew
origination: Arguments to prove the Greek Letters to be of Phenician
Origination.
for 1. If we regard the very figure; the Greek Letters, especially such as are
more ancient, (whereof we have some characters given us by Jo: Scaliger in his
notes on Eusebius) are so exactly answerable to the old Phenician Letters, (now
called the Samaritan, as Bochart,) that there is no one but will grant, the
former had their original from the later. 2. Many of the names in the Greek
Alphabet are Phenician or Hebrew: as (...), which is the same with (...) Aleph;
and (...) the same with (...) Beth; (...) Gimel the same with (...); and (...)
Daleth the same with (...), etc. Neither was this origination of the Greek
Alphabet from the Hebrew hidden to the Greeks, who, according to Varro,
acknowledge these names were not of Greek, but Barbarian i.e. Phenician or
Hebrew Extract. 3. The Greeks, in their Letters, observe the Phenician order;
which that it was most ancient appears by the Acrostick verses of David and
Jeremiah etc. 4. The power both in one and to 'ther is very much the same. It Is
true, Cadmus brought but 16 letters into Greece, whereunto Palamedes, or
Simonides, or Epicharmus added 4, and Pythagoras one more: yet this hinders not
the former Assertion: for the Arabic and Ethiopick Tongues have their proper
Letters, which yet hinders not, but that they are Hebrew Dialects.

. 3. We find a learned Digression touching the samenesse of the Grecian Letters
with the Phenician, in Joseph Scaliger, his Animadversions on Eusebius's
Chronicon, fol. 110. etc. ( Edit. Amstelod. 1658.) where he gives us the
parallel 'twixt the Greek and Phenician Letters; and then adds, fol. 111. You
have an Exemplar of the Phenician Letters, together with the different Figures
of the Greek; by comparing of which, you may of your self collect, that the
Greek Letters sprang from the Phenician; seeing they have one and the same
Order and Form with the Phenician; which in times past all the Cananites and
Hebrews used; as also the Samaritans now use the same: neither were there any
other in use, from the time of Moses, to the destruction of the Temple. For
those Letters, which the Jews now use in their sacred Books, and other
writings, are novitious, and of late original; being but depravations of the
Syriack, and these from the Samaritan. (Then he adds) having given an Exemplar
of the Phenician from the Samaritan, Cananitish, or Mosaic Alphabet, every one
may plainly see, that not only the Ionick, but also the Latin Letters are drawn
according to, and from the Phenician; and that it is true, what Pliny writes,
that the ancient Ionian Letters were the same with the Latin; which Ionian
Letters he also calls Assyrian. For the Jones received their Letters from the
Phenicians, which, as in all things else it happens, by long use and Progress
of time, declined from their primitive form; yet so as their origin may be
discovered. Therefore Herodotus says, that the ancient Ionick Letters were
most like to the Phenician; and that he saw some monuments of them in Asia --
The Greeks called their ancient elements (...), Phenician, because they were
given them by Cadmus from the Phenicians. They also called them (...) Cadmeian
Letters, as it is manifest out of Herodotus and Timon. etc.

. 4. Bochart also ( Canaan lib. 1. cap. 20.) undertakes to demonstrate to us,
how the Greeks, by inverting the Position or situs of the Phenician Letters,
brought their Letters to that Form they now have. The Greeks (says he)
inverted the situs of the Phenician Letters, (after they began to alter the
Mode of writing toward the right hand.) Thus of the Phenician Beth was made
the Greek, and of Gimel, G etc. For after they began to write from left to
right, it was necessary also, together with the mode of writing, to change the
Situs of the Letters. This mutation was made by the conduct of Nature: for as
Julius Scaliger ( de causis linguae Latin. lib. 1. cap. 46) rightly observes;
the natural motion is toward the right hand. Yet the Hebrew, or Phenician mode
of writing toward the left, was not unknown to the Grecians: for the most
ancient of them imitated the same for the most part. So Solons Laws are said to
have been written from right to left, after the Hebrew mode: Thus Bochart fol.
494. The like also, Owen Theolog. lib. 4. Digress. 1. There is no mention
(says he) of any Letters amongst the Gentiles before the Age of Cadmus. The
Phenicians, of whom Cadmus was, are said to receive the use of Letters from the
Syrians. So Diodorus lib. 5. That the Hebrews are called Syrians none can be
ignorant. That the Phenicians received not the Figures, nor the Number, but the
use of the Letters from the Syrians, is evident from what we have mentioned of
Cadmus. As for the wonted mode of writing amongst the Syrians toward the left,
the Grecians had some fame thereof, which they called the Taepocon; though the
use thereof be not so apparent amongst them. Thus this learned man; and though
he differs somewhat from Bochart in these points, yet they both agree, with the
ancient, herein: namely, that the Grecians received, by Cadmus, their Letters
from the Phenicians; who had theirs from the Syrians or Hebrews, according to
that of Eupolemus mentioned in Clem: Alexandr. (...). lib. 1. as before.

. 5. This also is demonstrated by our learned Jackson, of the Divine Authority
of the Scriptures fol. 57. where he speaks thus: The Greek Alphabet has been
taken from the Hebrew, as it is evident to such as will compare both. The
Grecians themselves acknowledge, they had their very Letters from the
Phenicians; who were next neighbors to Judaea -- And as both the first
Elements, and sundry primitive words of the Greek and Hebrew scarce differ one
from another as 3 from 4: so are the principal or first Heads of the Grecian
invention derived, for the most part from the Hebrews; although by successive
artificial imitation, their variety grow greater, and their resemblance of
Divine Truth less. Thus Jackson. To which we may add that of Grotius de
veritate Relig. Christ. page 17. whereunto (says he) accedes the undoubted
Antiquity of Moses's writings, with which no other writing may contend. Whereof
this is a sufficient Argument, that the Grecians, whence all Learning was
diffused amongst the Nations, confess that they received their Letters else
where; which Letters of theirs have the same ancient Order, name, and fashion
or draught, with those of the Syriack or Hebrew. As the ancient Attick Laws
(whence the Roman Laws were also afterward derived) had their original from
Moses's Laws. I shall conclude this Argument from Authority, with that of the
learned Hammond, in his Annotations on Mat: 15.22. [a Woman of Canaan.] This
Woman of Canaan (says he) is, Mark 7.37. called a Syrophenician -- That which
is said by the Heathens of the original of Letters and Literature by Cadmus
from the Phenicians, confirms the same; by the Phenicians meaning the
Hebrews; from whom (accorunto Clemens's observation, that (...)) the Grecians
stole all they had. Thus Hammond. As for Cadmus, who is generally supposed to
have been the first that transported Letters into Greece, we have ( cap. 6.. 1.
etc.) proved out of Bochart and others, that he was descended from those (...)
Cadmonites, mentioned by Moses Genesis 15.19. the same with the Hivites, who were
called Cadmonim i.e. orientals, Josh. 11.3. Jud. 3.3. because they occupied
mount Hermon, which is the most oriental part of all Canaan. Hence also
Cadmus's Wife was styled Harmonia, from mount Hermon, whence she came: and,
because (...) Hivite signifies also a Serpent, they were also said to be turned
into Serpents. All which I have been confirmed in, by learned Bochart upon
personal Conference, as well as by reading his account hereof laid down in his
Canaan lib. 1. cap. 19. So Bochart in his Phaleg. lib. 1. c. 15. tells us
expressly, that as Letters and Sciences were derived from the Hebrews to the
Phenicians, so from the Phenicians to the Greeks.

. 6. A full proof of the derivation of the Greek from the Hebrew by instances
out of Plato etc.
But to give a more Artificial, and Physical Demonstration of the Traduction of
the Greek Language, as well as Letters, from the Phenician and Hebrew Tongue.
Plato, in his Cratylus, assures us, that they, the Grecians, received their
Names and Language from certain Barbarians, more ancient than themselves etc.
And, to make his Position good, he cites many words, which, he presumes, were
of this Barbarian Origination. Now these words he cites are evidently of Hebrew
Extract; which gives us an irresistible evidence, that by the Barbarian Tongue
he meant the Hebrew. I shall instance in a few particulars. One word mentioned
by Plato, as of a Barbarian original, is (...) darkness, which is naturally and
evidently derived from (...) ereb, Genesis 1.5. as we have elsewhere proved. So,
in like manner, he makes (...) to be of Barbarian origination; namely from
(...). But this will more evidently appear in those Trojan words he there
cites, and their Affinity or samenes, as to substance, with the Hebrew, as
Serranus has well observed. So (...), the name of a River, owes its original to
(...) he hears, by reason of the noise of the water. And (...) seems derived
from (...) to wonder, because he was a person of great wonder and admiration.
So (...) from (...) to bring forth fruit, because he was fructificator Patriae.
Yea the very name (...) seems borrowed from (...) Exploration, by reason of
that known fable of Neptune and Apollo their searching Troy, when it was built
by Laomedon. To these mentioned by Plato, we might add many more Greek words,
which are most apparently of Hebrew and Phenician origination. As (...) wise
men, from (...) Sophim, speculators, or Seers; which is a style the Hebrews
gave to their wise men, as we have elsewhere observed. So (...) Heaven, from
(...) Or, or Ur, Light. (...) an Earnest, from (...), which signifies the same
in the Phenician tongue, as Grotius on 2 Cor. 1.21. Thus (...) from (...) vice:
and (...) from (...) El, God: as (...) from (...) Cadmon, Genesis 15.19. (...)
Malchus, ( Porphyries name) from (...) a King. So (...) a Chimney, or Hearth,
from (...) Hearths, where they kept their sacred fires, mentioned Lev. 26.30.
Lev. 26.30.
So likewise (...) an Ode, from (...) I will praise, and (...) from (...); and
(...) from (...), as Grot. on 2 Cor. 12.9. 'T would be endless to proceed, as
far as we might, in such derivations of Greek words from the Phenician and
Hebrew. He that will, may see more of this in Crinesius, de confusione
linguarum, cap. 10. page 83. Bochart Can. lib. 2. cap. 1. to the 6.

. 7. The Latin immediately from the Greek, but originally from the Hebrew.
As the Greek Tongue had its origination from the Hebrew, and Phenician; so in
like manner the Latin from the Greek. That the Latin, as well as the Greek
Letters, had their origination from the Phenician or Hebrew, is proved at large
by learned Joseph Scaliger, in his Animadversions on Eusebius's Chronicon, fol.
111. etc: Edit. 1658. Thus Grotius, de satisfactione Christi cap. 8. page 164.
The whole of the ancient Latin (says he) was but a depravation of the Greek.
So again Grotius Epist. ad Gallos ( Epist. 58. page 146.) The Latin Tongue
(says he) had its original from the Greek, as this from the Syriack, or the
Hebrew, which is the same, etc. And learned Bochart is so confident of this
Traduction of the Latin from the Greek, as that, once in a conference with him,
he undertook to show me, how, in those two verses of Virgil, Tityre, tu patulae
recubans sub tegmine fagi,
Sylvestrem tenui Musam meditaris avena.
Each word had its derivation from the Greek: as Tityrus from (...), tu from
(...), patulus from (...), etc. I shall instance but in a few Latin words,
which had their origination immediately from the Greek, but originally from the
Hebrew. So Astrum from (...), as this from (...) Aster. Caminus, a Chimney,
from (...), and this from (...) Chaminim. Lev. 26.30. Oda, from (...), as this
from (...) Ode. Arra from (...), and this from (...) arrabon. Sicera from
(...), and this from (...) Secar. A (...) vide, tur fluxisse Graecum ^al.
Glass. Gram. l. 3. ^rac^. 8. Can. 1.
So from the Hebrew (...), or (...), or (...), the Greek (...), and the Latin,
vae, seem to be traduced: as from (...) ah and aha: and from (...), and nae:
from (...) Gamel, (...), and hence Camelus: from (...) Tor, (...), and hence
Taurus: from (...) Sac, (...), saccus: as Glassius Grammat. S. lib. 4. Tract.
3. Obser. 5. Thus from (...) El, (...), and Sol: as from (...) Iah Chus, (...),
Iacchus: so Vossius de Idol. lib. 2. cap. 16. From (...) Jajin, wine, (...),
and hence ( o being expunged) vinum: as Voss. de Idol: l. 1. cap. 18. Also from
(...) Mom, vice, (...), and Momus: from (...) Keren, and horn, (...), and
Cornu. Mede clavis Apocalyp. page 108. makes Acheron, a river in hell, to be
derived from Accaron, or Ekron; 1 Samuel 5.11. Acheron, the river of hell, (says
he) as they heard from the Grecians, in sound differs not from Accaron, or
Ekron, the city of the Philistines, 1 Samuel 5.11. where Beelzebub was God, and
thence styled Accaroneus. From Accaron also comes Charon, the Boatman of Styx,
(whom Vossius makes the same with the Infernal Mercury) and Acheron. The
Grecians by Acheron understood Hell, so also the Latins; whence that of the
Poet, -- Acheronta movebo. He that will, may find more on this Head, of the
Traduction of the Latin from the Greek immediately, but originally from the
Hebrew; in Beckman de origin linguae Latinae: Also in Ger. Vossius his late
book de origin ling. Latinae. Crinesius de confus. linguarum cap. 8. page 83.
Johan. Buxtorf. Philolog. Dissertat. 2. Brerewoods Inquiries touching the
Diversity of Languages chap. 7. page 52.

. 8. Other Western Languages from the Hebrew.
As for the other European Languages, the Italian, Spanish, French, German,
English, etc. its evident, that they are, as to their present constitution,
made up, for the most part, of the Latin, and so originally from the Hebrew, as
has been proved in the former. Quod argumento esse debuisset, Hebraeorum voces
in omnes omnium linguas se diffudisse. Sandford De Descensu. lib. 1.. 17
I shall only cull out some of the old Gallick and Britannick (which, as
Camden and Bochart prove, are for substance the same) Tongue, with some Saxon
and English words, which seem evidently to derive their origination from the
Phenician or Hebrew. First the very name Britannie, is, by Bochart, made
parallel unto, and derived from the Phenician (...) Barat anak, a land of Tin,
or Led. Whence the Welsh Brith (which signifies diverse colors) seems to
receive its Derivation; and hence also (as a curious Cambrobritan informed me)
the more curious Welsh Critics derive Britain. Thus Shivers, from (...)
Shibber, he brake; and nod, from (...), to nod: as also Mud, from the Phenician
(...) Mod or Mud, which signifies slime; whence in Philo Byblius, the first
Chaos is called (...) mud or slime. I shall conclude this Discourse of Western
Languages with some account of the old Gallick, Britannick, and Saxon Gods,
with the Traduction of their Names from the Phenician or Hebrew Language.
Jupiter was styled in the old Gallick Tongue Taramis; in the Britannick, (as in
the Cambrick or Welsh to this day) taram or taran; in the old Saxon and
English, Thur, (whence Thursday for Dies Jovis,) and all these from the
Phenician (...) tarem, whereof the radix is (...) to thunder, as hereafter,
Book 2. chap. 1.. 7. Again, Mercury was styled in the old Gallick, Teutates,
(and I presume the same in the Britannick,) as in the German, Tuisto, or Teuto,
from the Phenician, Taautus, whom the Egyptians styled Thoyth, or Theuth: (as
also the English and German Man, or Men, according to Vossius, came from the
Egyptian, Menas) of which see what follows B. 2. C. 4.. 3. So Hesus, another
Gallick God, whereby, it is presumed, they understood Mars, received its
origination from the Hebrew (...) hizzuz, potent, or strong, which is an
Attribute given to the true God, Psalm. 24.8. (...) Jehovah Hizzuz, the Lord
strong, of which see more B. 2. c. 5. of Mars. Farther; Apollo was styled among
the old Gauls, Belenus, ( Herodian reads it (...),) which seems evidently a
Derivative from the Phenician (...) baal, or beel, whence Belus, as B. 2. C.
4.. 1. Again Hercules passed among the old Gauls under the name of Ogmius, as
Lucian in Hercul. (...): The Celticall Hercules, in their vernacule Tongue,
Ogmius: which Bochart derives from the Hebr. (...) strangers, as B. 2. c. 5.
Lastly, the Britains (who, as Tacitus, and Caesar write, had the same sacreds
with the Gauls) worshipped a certain Goddess called Adraste, which Bochart
makes to be the same with the Phenician Astarte; whence also the Saxon Goddess
Aestar, or Easter, which they sacrificed unto in the month of April, as
hereafter Book 2. chapter 2.. 6. As for the several names of Dignities and Offices
among the old Gauls and Britains, viz. Brennus, Mar, Rix, Patera, Coena, etc.
with their origination from the Hebrew, see what precedes chap. 9.. 6.

BOOK II. Of Pagan Theology, both Theogonick or Mythick, Physic, and
Politic; with its Traduction from Sacred Names, Persons, Rites, and Stories.
CAP. I. The Theogonie of Saturn, and Jupiter from Sacred Names, Persons, and
Stories.
Pagan Theology in general, and its Distribution, into Theogonick, Physic,
and Politic. Theogonick or Mythick Theology distributed into Zabaisme and
Hellenisme; with the Idea of each. The Theogonie of Saturn: his Grandfather
Eliun the same with (...) Elion, Gods name Genesis 14.19,22. His Grandmother Bryth
from (...) berith Gods Covenant. His immediate Parents the Heaven and Earth
from Genesis 14.19. His proper name Ilus from (...) El Gods name. He was called
also Molech from (...), Baal from (...) etc. His Parallel with Adam in 6
particulars; with Abraham in 4 particulars; and with Noah in 14 particulars.
The Theogonie of Jupiter; who is called Belus from (...) beel Hos. 2.16. (...),
which answers to the Hebrew (...) heat, and so is an allusion to (...) Cham,
who past for Jupiter among the Egyptians and Africans. Again, he is styled
Sydyk from (...) Gods name; Taramis from (...) thunder; Jupiter from Ja or Jev
(...), answerable to Gods name (...), Sabasius from (...). Phenician Fables
applied to Jupiter.

. 1. Pagan Theology, and its derivation.
HAving dispatched the Discourse of Languages, and proved their Derivation from
the Hebrew and Mosaic Scripture: we now proceed to a second part of
Philologie, which refers unto Pagan Theology or Idolatry, with endeavors to
demonstrate its Traduction from, and that by a cursed Diabolick Imitation of,
sacred Oracles and Worship. All Pagan Theology is by the Ancients reduced to
this Distribution. 1. (...) Mythick, or Fabulous Theology, at first broached
by the Poets, which chiefly regards the (...). Generation of the Gods. 2. (...)
Politic or civil Theology, hatched, as it is presumed, by States men,
Politicians, and the common people; but seated amongst their Priests. This
properly relates to their (...) Idolatry or Worship: which takes in all their
Sacrifices, Priests, Temples etc. 3. They had also their (...) Natural
Theology; which consisted chiefly in (...) (mentioned 1 Timothy 4.1.) 1 Timothy 4.1.
Demon Dogmes and Canons, and was the figment of the wiser sort of Heathens,
namely of the Philosophers, who rejecting the multiplicity of Gods, brought in
by the Poets, reduced their Theology to a more Natural and Rational Form,
wherein they suppose but one Great and Sovereign God, which generally they made
to be the Sun: but he being too remote and distant from human Condition and
Affairs here below, had certain Demons (called by the Phenicians Baalim) or
Midling-made-Gods, which were to be as Mediators 'twixt him, the Supreme God,
and Men etc. Now, that all these three kinds of Pagan Theology were but
borrowed, by an helbred imitation, from that sacred Theology and worship
seated in the Church of God, we shall demonstrate by each part.

. 2. As for the Pagan (...) Mythick Theology, Mythick or Theogonick Theology.
termed by some (...) Mythologie, it consisted chiefly in their (...)
Theogonie, or Generation of the Gods. The first that undertook to give an
account of the Genealogy of the Gods, was Sanchoniathon, that famous Phenician
Writer, who was followed herein by several of the Poets; namely by Orpheus,
Hesiod etc, yea, and by some of the Philosophers, especially by Pherecydes, (
Pythagoras's Master) who is supposed to have written several Books of (...),
the Generation of the Gods; whence he was, in a more eminent degree, styled
(...) the Divine. Now that all these Fables touching the Gentile Gods, their
Generations etc had their original from some Name, Person, or Thing mentioned
in sacred Scripture, I shall endeavor to demonstrate, first, in the general,
and then from particulars. As for the general Demonstration hereof, it will be
necessary to consider, though but cursorily, the rise and progress of all Idol
Gods, and Idolatry: all of which is comprehended, by some learned men, under
these two common Heads of Zabaisme, and Hellenisme. See Owen Thelog. lib. 3.
cap. 4. p. 187.
Zabaisme (so termed from the Zabii, a Sect of Chaldean Philosophers) was the
first and more natural piece of Idolatry; which consisted in a Religious
Worship given unto the Sun, Moon, and Stars, styled in Scripture, the H^sts of
Heaven. Hellenisme, which superadded hereto an infinity, almost, of fictitious
and coined Gods, was of more late date, and proper to the Grecians, most
skilful in the art of making Gods.

Of Zabaisme its rise from sacred tradition.
1. As for Zabaisme, which gave a Deity and Divine worship to the Sun, Moon and
Stars; it began very early, even in the infancy of the Church; and had made
good progress in the world about the Age of Job, and Moses, as it appears by
Job 31.26,27. If I saw the Sun etc. as also by Deuteronomy: 11.6. take heed lest thine
heart etc. And, as Owen ( Theolog. lib. 3. cap. 4.188. etc.) observes, this
pagan humor of Idolizing these glorious celestial bodies, seems to have had its
rise from some broken Traditions, conveyed by the Patriarchs, touching the
Dominion of the Sun by day, and of the Moon by night: according to Gen: 1.16.
Genesis 1.16.
and Psalm. 136.7.8.9. Ps. 136.7.
where the Sun and Moon are styled the greater Lights, not only by a (...), or
condescension to vulgar capacities, as some will have it, but from their
peculiar office; the Sun being appointed to govern by day, and the Moon by
night. So that albeit the Moon be, in regard of its substance and borrowed
Light, inferior to many of the Stars, yet, by virtue of its Office, it is above
them, and so termed a Greater Light. Now its very probable, that the fame of
this Dominion, conferred by God on the Sun and Moon, was diffused amongst the
Gentiles, first in the Oriental parts; whence their corrupt imaginations, very
prone to Idolatry, conferred a Deity on these Creatures, which to them seemed
most glorious. Thence they termed the Sun (...) Molech, or Melec, the King:
also (...) Baal, the Lord; and (...) El, God, (whence the Greek (...) the Sun:)
likewise (...) Bell Sames, Lord of Heaven; and (...) Eliun, the most High. All
which are names, which the Scripture gives the true God of Israel; and, without
all peradventure, had their original thence, as hereafter.

2 Of Hellenisme, its rise from sacred story.
2. As for Hellenisme; its derivation from sacred Oracles will sufficiently
appear from the enumeration of particulars which follow; only take this
general account hereof. The Light of of Nature, and those (...) or (...),
common principles touching the Being and Unity of God, Owen Theolog. lib. 1. c.
8. p. 86.
having been very much obliterated by sin, the Greek Poets, who were the first
Broachers of Mythologie, having gleaned up many oriental broken Traditions
touching God, and the wonders he wrought in behalf of his people, turned all
into Fables, or figments of, I know not what, new Gods. These their fables they
divulge, first by Hymns and Songs, made concerning their new coined Deities,
whereby they ravish the ears of the credulous Idolatrously-disposed people.
Thence they commit the same to writings, stuffed out with all manner of fables;
so that there was scarce discernable any ragge of the old sacred Tradition,
whence at first they received their fables. For whatever they heard touching
the Existence, Attributes, or providence of God, they wrested unto such
fabulous senses, and augmented by such monstrous figments; Ostenditur secundo,
Graecoru^ Deorum nomina origin nou alia, quam Hebraica esse Sand ford, de
desc. l. 1.. 6.
and out of these, by a strange artificial imitation, and successive
multiplication, coined so many prodigious comments relating to some new
Deities, as that in a short time their Gods were multiplied to a kind of
Infinity. Thus did Hellenisme, or Polytheisme spring originally, though by a
monstrous kind of Satanick imitation, from true sacred stories touching God,
his Names, Attributes, Providence, or People; as 'twill farther appear by the
several Deities amongst the Pagans, and their Theogonie.

. 3 1. Of Saturn his original names, etc.
The first great Idol-God, universally owned by the Pagans, was by them called
Saturn, whose Names and Attributes were, as it is most evident, but corrupt
imitations of sacred story. Saturn is supposed to be so called from (...)
latuit, whence he was styled Deus Latius, and his proper seat was Latium, as
Glass. Gram. 1. l. 4. Tract. 3. But we shall begin with Saturnes names and
genealogy, as we find them given us by Sanchoniathon, according to Philo
Byblius's version, mentioned by Eusebius, who brings in Sanchoniathon thus
discoursing of Saturn's Generation and Names. He says first, that the great
God (...) Eliun, called the most high, generated the Heaven and the Earth.
Eliun, heb. (...) Elion, is one of Gods proper Names, and signifies most High.
Bochart, Canaan lib. 2. cap. 2. fol. 784. supposes this passage of
Sanchoniatho^, to have been taken out of Moses's words, Genesis 14.19.22. Genesis
14.19,22.
where it is said, (...) The most high God possessor or (as Bochart) generator of
Heaven and Earth: for (...) is rendered by him, to generate; it being so rendered
by the LXX Zach. 13.1. The wife of Eliun, Sanchoniathon makes to be (...)
Beruth, i.e. (...) berith; whence we read of the Phenician Goddess Berith,
Judge. 8.33. Judge. 8.33.
which, I presume, received her origination from (...); whereby the Covenant
which God made with his People, which was, as it were, the Mother of all their
Mercies, is usually expressed. For the blind Cananites or Phenicians, hearing
much from the Jews, of their (...) berith, Covenant, (which they made the great
Parent of all their Mercies,) they thence grossly conceited, that this (...)
berith was a Goddess, the wife of (...) Elion, the most high God. Saturnes
immediate Parent is (...), (from (...) Ur, the light) Heaven, because God is
said first to produce the Heaven. Genesis 14.19. Whence it follows in
Sanchoniathon, that the first born son of the Heaven was (...), Ilos, who also
was called Saturn. Saturn called (...) Ilos, from (...), Gods name.
This (...), given to Saturn, Bochart makes to be the same with the Hebrew
(...) El, a proper name of the true God. And that the Phenicians called Saturn
(...), is manifest by the words of Damascus in Phot. CCXL 11. thus: (...), The
Phenicians, and Syrians, call Saturn El, and Bell, and Bolathes. Hence from
this name (...), given to Saturn, the Sun, which is made his royal Throne, was
called by the Greeks (...). Molech.
Another name whereby the Phenicians expressed Saturn, was Molech, according
to Amos 5.26. from the Hebrew (...), a King. They call him also (...) Baal,
which was originally one of Gods sacred names, as Hos. 2.16. Saturn is also,
according to Bochart, called Chiun, Amos 5.26. and Rephan or Remphan, (which is
an Egyptian style, or title, the same with Chiun) Act. 7.43. of which see more
what follows chap. 2.. 8.

But to come to the original Idea of Saturn, by which it will more evidently
appear, that not only his Names, but also his Extract, and Attributes were all
but corrupt imitations, taken up from some sacred Person and Tradition. As for
the genealogy of Saturn, some make him to be the same with Adam; others refer
him to Abraham; and a third sort suppose him to be the same with Noah. We may
indeed take in each of these relations. For its well known, that these poor
blind Heathens were wont to attribute Traditions and Relations, originally
different, to one and the same person, according as their inclinations led
them. Hence they framed more than one hundred Jupiters, by applying different
stories to one and the same name and person.

. 4. 2 Saturnes genealogy referred to Adam in 6. particulars.
To begin therefore with those, who refer the story of Saturn to Adam. 'So
Plato in his Politicus fo. 272. describing the golden age, under the reign of
Saturn, says, that God, as supreme Lord, disposed of all; neither were there
possessions of wives and children, or polices, but all lived on the fruits of
the Earth, which brought forth fruits, without any agriculture, of its own
accord. Then he adds, that these first Parents lived naked, sub Dio, and had
conference with the beasts etc. which plainly relates to Adam and Eves state in
Paradise. And in a conference with Bochart, upon the mention of this discourse
of Plato to him, he seemed to grant me, that this story of Saturn might be
referred to Adam, though (as he said) 'twas not proper for him to mention it,
because he referred Saturn rather to Noah. And Stephanus (...) on (...), tells
us, that (...) Saturn, was called (...); and that this Adanus was the son of
Heaven and Earth, (...), which is a perfect description of Adams production by
God out of the Earth. Whence Sanchoniathon, speaking of Adams formation out of
the Earth, styles him (...), the character here given to Saturn. And indeed,
the very name (...) seems to be the very same with (...) Adam. For the Greeks,
having no words terminating in m, for Adam they pronounced (...). Thus Vossius
de Idololatr. lib. 1. cap. 38. Neither may we conceive that the memory of our
first Parents was lost in Asia among the Gentiles: many things prove the
contrary. Adana, an ancient city of Cilicia, built by the Syrians, was so
called in memory of the first man Adam. For it is evident, that the Grecians,
having no words ending in m, for (...) read (...), and the termination added,
(...): whence the city (...). This (...), says Stephanus, was the son of
Heaven and Earth. Which agrees to none more properly than to Adam. The same
Stephanus says, that he was called Saturn and Rhea: I suppose, because
Saturn was the first man, and Rhea the mother of all, Eve, etc. Again, Vossius
de Idololatr. lib. 1. cap. 18. gives a good parallel 'twixt Saturn and Adam.
1. Adam is called the son of God Luke 3.38. because he had no father but what
was heavenly: so Saturn is called the son of Heaven. 2. Adam was formed out of
the dust of the Earth: so Saturnes Mother was called Tellus Earth, as Hesiod,
and Orpheus tell us. 3. The Worship given to Saturn among the Greeks and
Romans, adds to this parallel. In the month of September 19 Kal. on which day
the Saturnals were acted at Rome, the Servants enjoyed their liberty; yea the
Masters served, while the servants sat at Table; which was a shadow of the
liberty which was in Paradise under Adam's innocent state etc. Thus Saturn is
brought in speaking in Lucian. (...). And therefore every where applause, and
singing, and play, and equality of Honor to all, both servants and free: For
under my Government there was no servant. There are many other particulars
wherein Saturn seems parallel to Adam, as 4. Adam is said to be the first that
taught men Husbandry; so Saturn. 5. Adam hid himself from the presence of God;
so Saturn; whence he was so named from (...) Satar, to hide. 6. Adam was cast
out of Paradise; so Saturn expelled from his Dominion etc. Saturni nomen ex
Heb. (...) fluxisse dicunt: unde is Latius Deus fuit dictus etc. Glass. Gram,
s. lib. 4. Tract. 3. obs. 5.
More of Saturnes Parallel with Adam see Vossius de Idolol. l. 1. c. 18. and
Book 3. chapter 4.. 5. of the golden Age.

. 5. Saturn parallel to Abraham in three particulars mainly.
Others refer the original of Saturn to Abraham: so Sanchoniathon in his (...)
generation of the Gods, says that Saturn (...) offered up his only son (...)
also he circumcised the privy parts, and forced his companions to do the same:
which evidently refers to the story of Abraham: and so it is more full
explained by Porphyrie, in his book (...) quoted by Eusebius, praepar: Evang:
lib. 1. cap. 9. where he makes Saturn, who after his death became a Planet, to
be called Israel: his words are these, (...) etc. Saturn, whom the Phenicians
call Israel, after his death was consecrated into a star etc. Then he adds,
that the same Saturn had, by a Nymph called (...) Anobret, an only son (...),
whom, for this, they called Ieoud, as he is so called, to this day, by the
Phenicians. This only son (says he) being clothed with a Royal habit, was
sacrificed by his father, being under great calamity. This Phenician Fable is
excellently well deciphered by Bochart ( Can. l. 2. c. 2. fol. 790) and applied
to the story of Abraham's offering up Isaac etc. 1 Isaac styled Jeud. from
Genesis 22.2.
Thus Jeud amongst the Hebrews is (...) Iehid which is is the Epithet given to
Isaac Genesis 22.2. concerning whom, it is evident, that Porphyrie treats. 2
Saturn, from Abraham's being styled a Prince of God Genesis 23.6. called the
principal God.
Then he adds, this only son was offered by his father: So Sanchoniathon --
Thence this Saturn, the same with Abraham, whom the Scripture styles (...) a
Prince of God Genesis 23.6. the Phenicians made the principal God: And they called
him Israel, the name of that people that sprang from Abraham: and they
consecrated unto him one day in seven, as holy, that is, the Sabbath day, which
was sacred amongst the Jews: 3 Saturn sacrifices his son in imitation of
Abraham. Genesis 22.2,3.
and they sacrificed their sons unto him, after a wicked kind of manner,
wherein they would imitate Abraham Genesis 22.2,3. Though, when God had tried
Abraham's faith and obedience, he forbids him to offer his son: but
Sanchoniathon, and Porphyrie bring in Saturn, as really sacrificing his son.
Namely, the Devil would fain make men believe so, that it might pass for an
example: (as indeed it did so amongst the Phenicians, who offered their sons to
Saturn etc.) 4 The Nymph Anobret an imitation of Sarah, who being barren
received Grace, Heb. 18,11.
The Nymph Anobret or (according to the Phenician name) (...) Annoberet,
signifies conceiving by Grace; which is an appellation properly belonging unto
Sarah, who, being barren, received, by Grace, a power to conceive etc. as Heb.
11.11. Thus Bochart, who is followed herein by Stillingfleet Origin. s. Book 3.
c. 5. Abraham is here called by the name of his posterity Israel, Isaac Jeoud.
So Genesis 22.2. Take thy son: (...) is the same with Phenician Joud. That Sarah
is meant by Anobret, the original of the name implies, as Bochart etc. of
Saturnes parallel with Abraham, Vossius de Idolol. lib. 1. cap. 18. page 142.
thus writes: peradventure also the Patriarch Abraham was worshipped in Saturn.
For which nothing else occurs but that of Porphyrie, Eusebius. praepar. Evang.
lib. 1. Therefore Saturn, whom the Phenicians name Israel, and whom, after his
death, they consecrated into a Star of the same name, when he reigned in those
parts, he had an only son, by a certain Nymph of that country called Anobret,
whom therefore they called Jeoud, a word, which to this very day signifies in
the Phenician tongue, only begotten. And when the King fell into a dangerous
war, he sacrificed this only son, adorned with royal apparel, on an Altar
erected for this very purpose. Wherein (says Vossius) we have three
observables. 1. That Israel, the most ancient King of the Phenicians, was the
same with Saturn. 2. That Israel had an only son, thence called by the
Phenicians Jeoud. 3. that this Son was sacrificed by his father: whence may we
suppose these things had their original, but from the confounding Israel with
his Grandfather Abraham, who was commanded by God to sacrifice his only son?
as Genesis 22.1. Take thine only son etc. where the Hebr. (...) greatly suits
with the Phenician Jeoud. Neither do these languages differ save in Dialect.
And truly in Orphaicis Abraham is styled (...); where Abraham and Isaac are
confounded, as here Abraham and Jacob. Thus Vossius.

. 6. 3. Saturnes parallel with Noin 14 particulars.
But the chief stories of Saturn and his genealogy seem to refer to Noah,
according to that excellent parallel drawn by Bochart, Phaleg lib. 1. cap. 1.
fol. 1. That Noah (says he) passed among the Heathens under the name of
Saturn, there are so many things to prove it, that there is scarce left room
for doubting. 1. Saturn is styled (...), the father of all; so was Noah. 2.
Saturn, as Noah, was styled a Preacher of righteousness. 3. Under Saturne's
reign, as under Noah's, all things were common and undivided. 4. All men enjoyed
the highest peace under Saturn; as under Noah. 5. In Saturnes time, as in
Noah's, all men used one speech etc. 6. Saturne's wife was called Rhea, or
Earth, because Noah was called a man of the Earth, as Genesis 9.20. Genesis 9.20.
(...) a man of the Earth, i.e. according to the Hebrew Idiom, a Husbandman:
which the Mythologists took in a proper sense for (...), the husband of the
Earth: whence Saturn, the same with Noah, is made the husband of Rhea, i.e.
the Earth. 7. Saturn is also said to be an Husbandman and planter of Vines, as
Noah was. 8. Saturn is styled the president of Drunkenness, from Noah's being
drunk. 9. Hence also came the Saturnalia, or Revels, consecrated to the memory
of Saturn. 10. Saturn is also said to be the Author of that Law, which forbad
the Gods to behold men naked: which was but a Tradition of the curse on Cham,
for beholding his fathers nakedness. 11. Saturn is said to arise, together
with his wife and children, out of the Sea; a Tradition of Noah, with his wife
and children, their deliverance from the Deluge. 12. Hence a Ship became
Saturne's symbol; and Saturn is said by Sanchoniathon to sail about the world.
13. Saturn is said to foretell Deucalion's flood, making use of a Dove etc.
answerable to that of Noah, etc. 14. Saturn is said to have devoured all his
children besides three, (...), viz. Jupiter Hammon, the same with Cham;
Neptune, the same with Japhet; and Pluto, the same with Shem. Thus Bochart more
largely. The like parallel 'twixt Saturn and Noah I find in Vossius de
Idololatr. lib. 1 cap. 18. Farther, in Saturn are conserved some relics of
the Patriarch Noah. Namely, they saw, as Adam was simply the first of all men,
so Noah the first of all that lived after the flood. Adam had the empire of all
the world: so had Noah with his family. Noah had three sons: so had Saturn.
Noah his three sons divided the world: so did Saturnes. etc. So Owen theol.
lib. 1: cap. 8. page 89. Saturn, by the Poets styled (...), was Time. Thus
they mythologized. Noah also, according to the most corrupt Tradition, was
styled such. Time is a space measured by the motion of the Heaven: hence
Saturn was styled the son (...) of heaven: so also Noah was esteemed. They
feigned Saturn to have devoured up his sons, and to have vomited them up
again, which alludes to Noah's deluge etc. Thus also Stillingfleet, Origin. s.
book 3. chapter 5.. 8. where he mentions Bocharts parallel betwixt Noah and Saturn
in 14 particulars as before. See Dickins: Delph. Phoen. Diatribe of Noah's
Names. Thus we have shown how the fabulous stories of Saturn his Genealogy,
Names, Attributes, and Offices, were but broken Traditions of sacred Scripture,
referring either to Adam, Abraham, or Noah, etc.

. 7. Jupiters Names and Genealogy from sacred story.
We now proceed to Jupiter, (who succeeded Saturn,) to demonstrate, that his
Genealogy, Names, and Attributes were but fragments, or broken Traditions of
some sacred story. First, as for Jupiters names, in the fragments of
Sanchoniathon, it is said; The son of Saturn was (...) Zeus Belus. Belus.
(...) Baal or Belus, the chief God among the Phenicians, (whereof there were
many) signifies properly, Lord: and it was a name assumed by Jehovah, the God
of Israel, before abused to Superstition, as it appears Hos. 2.16. Hos. 2.16.
It is elsewhere written (...) Beel, as (...), which answers to the Hebrew
(...) the Lord of Heaven. (...)
As for (...), though it be, as to its immediate origination, a Greek Title,
yet the original Reason thereof is Phenician or Hebrew, answering unto Cham,
the son of Noah. For (...) is derived (...), which signifies heat: which
answers exactly to the Hebrew (...) Cham, from the radix (...) Chamam, to wax
hot. By which it is evident, the Greeks styled Jupiter (...), in allusion to
his Phenician or Hebrew name (...) Cham. Hammon.
Whence Herodotus tells us, that the Egyptians called Jupiter Ammun: (...), for
the Egyptians call Jupiter Ammun. So Ralegh, Hist. of the world, Part. 1. B. 1.
c. 6.. 6. tells us, That the Egyptians, even after the flood, began to entitle
Cham, the parent of their own Mizraim, Chammon, or Hammon. Thus Vosstus de
Idololatr. lib. 1. c. 27. Unto Saturn succeeded Jupiter Ammon, that is Cham,
or Ham; whence the Egyptians made (...), the Grecians (...), from Cham (...)
Noah's son. Which appears from this, that Egypt is styled, not only the
country of Misraim, Cham's son, but also the land of Cham, as Ps. 105.23.27.
Also Plutarch, of Isis and Osiris, testifies, that Egypt, in the sacreds of
Isis, was termed (...): whence this but from Cham? yet I shall not
pertinaciously dissent, if any will have the name Ammon primarily to agree to
the Sun rather than to a man, from (...), which signifies heat, and so
agreeable to the Sun, the fountain of heat, etc. So Bochart Phaleg lib. 1. cap.
2. informs us, that the Africans (who were originally Phenicians) called
Jupiter, Hammon, as the Egyptians (...) Ammun, (whence Ammonius.) So also in
his Preface to Phaleg, Bochart assures us, that the Africans worshipped Cham, or
Ham, under the name of Hammon; as Noah under that of Saturn; whence Africa was
called Hammonia, or the country of Hammon. By all which it is evident, that this
name Hammon, given to Jupiter, had its original from (...) Cham, or Ham, unto
which (...) alludes. Sydyk.
Again, Sanchoniathon terms Jupiter (...) Sydyk. So Philo Byblius, (...) from
Sydyk sprang the Cabiri: or, as Damascius in Photius. (...) Sadyk. Now this
name is evidently taken from the Hebrew (...) Sedek, the just, which is a name
given to God, as also to the first Patriarchs, whence Melchisedek. Taramis.
Another name given to Jupiter, is Taramis, or Taranis, which, according to
Camden ( Britan. page 14. edit. Land. 1586.) is the same with (...) Jupiter
thundering: to whom Augustus consecrated a Temple. Taram vel taram Cambried
lingua, hodie^ est tonitru, et veteri Sueciea, Thor; unde Jovis dies Suecica
Thorsday, Anglicae Thursday. Boch. cars. l. 1. c. 42.
For Taram or Taran in the British tongue signifies Thunder, as in the Saxon
Thor, or Thur, whence Jnpiter's day was by the Saxons called Thursday. Now this
name Taram, given to Jupiter, Bochart makes to be derived from the Phenician
(...) tarem, which, by casting away the Servile (...) prefixed, is the same
with (...) to thunder.

. 8. Jupiter from ja (...).
But nothing indeed does more evidently prove, Jupiters origination to have
been, from some corrupt imitation, of sacred story, than the very name it
self. For Jupiter (as Muis on the Psalms well observes) is evidently the same
with (...) or (...), that is, Father Jah, or Jeu. Jovis nomen a Sanctissimo Dei
apud Hebraeos nomine (...) Glass. Gram. s. l. 4. Tract. 3. Ps. 68.4.
Now its well known, that (...) Jah is a name properly, yea most essentially
attributed to God in Scripture, as Psalm. 68.4. etc. it being but a Contract of
(...) Jehovah, and so most expressive of the Divine Being, or Essence. That
Gods name (...) Jah was well known to the Phenicians, who communicated the same
to the Grecians, is evident by what we find to this purpose in Porphyrie; who
tells us, that Sanchoniathon had much assistance for the compiling of his
History from Jerombalus the Priest of the God (...), Jao. So Diodorus lib. 1.
tells us, that Moses inscribed his Laws to the God called Jao. Indeed the
Grecians seldom, if ever, express the ineffable name of God, Jehovah by any
other than (...), or (...), according to the Oracle of Clarius Apollo (...). So
the Gnostics, in Irenaeus lib. 1. cap. 34. call God Jao: and Jerome, in his
Comment on Psalm. 8. Jaho. which Greek name Bochart supposes to have been
framed out of the 4 letters (...) of Jehovah, which may be read Jaho: for which
some of the Greeks read (...) Jeu pater i:e: jah, or jeu the Father. And as
Jupiter owes its origination to the sacred name of God Jehovah, Jah, or Jao; So
also the oblique cases of Jupiter, namely Jovi, Jove etc. for how
inconsiderable, if any, is the difference in the Hebrew 'twixt Jove, or Jova,
and Jehovah. This same name Jao, in the Oracle of Clarius Apollo, is given also
to Bacchus. As it was not unusual with those Mythologists, to give the same
name to differing persons, as their humors inclined. Vossius, de Idol. lib. 2.
cap 16. page 386. endeavors to prove, that Jupiter was allo called Janus from
(...) Jah, as Jacchus from jah chus, and reputed to be the same with the Sun,
as Jana, Diana or Juno the same with the Moon, Sabasius.
Again, whence was it that Jupiter was styled Sabasius? but from that Title of
God (...) Jehovah Sabbath the Lord of hosts, a style so often given to God: as
Esa. 1 9. Esa. 1.9.
which is rendered Romans 9.29. the Lord of Sabbath. Owen, Theol. lib. 3. cap: 13.

. 9. By all which laid together, I suppose, 'twill seem more than a mere
conjecture, that the chief, if not the whole of Jupiters Titles were of sacred
origination, though by cursed imitation. Fables applied to Jupiter, of
Phenician original.
We might also show, that many of the Fables applied to Jupiter, were, indeed,
of Phenician or Hebrew original: as that of Jupiters rebellion against his
father Saturn, from Chams rebellion against Noah etc. The fabulous Jews
relate, that Cham cut off his fathers Virilia, whence the Fable of Jupiters
cutting off Saturn, his father Genitalia as Lact. lib. 1. cap. 12. But I shall
instance chiefly in that famous Fable of Jupiters stealing away Europa, which
seems evidently of Phenician and Hebrew extract, and that from a mistake of the
original words. For whereas it is said, that Jupiter stole away Europa, under
the form of a bull; the Fable, as learned Bochart demonstrates, arose from the
Equivocation of the Phenician (...), which signifies either a Ship or a Bull.
Now the Grecians, to make the fable more admirable, understand it of a Bull;
whereas the Phenician story meant it only of Jupiters carrying away Europa in a
Ship etc. So the Fable of Jupiters having Horns, according to that of Ovid,
Metaph: lib. 5. Lybi is est cum cornubus Hammon. Exodus 34,29.
Amongst the Lybians Jupiter Hammon is pictured with Horns; seems borrowed,
and that upon a mistake, from the story of Moses's coming down from the Mount
with his face shining: where the Hebrew (...) signifies both a beam of the Sun,
as also a Horn: from which ambiguity the Fable sprang. Again, in the
Metamorphosis of the Gods in Egypt, it is said that Jupiter was turned into a
Ram; which Fable Bochart ( de Animalibus sacris part 2. lib. 1. cap. 10. fol
62.) supposes to have had its rise from the cognation 'twixt the Hebrew words
(...) El (the name of God transferred on Jupiter) and (...) ajil a ram: which
being Paronymous, and the Plural number of both the same viz. (...) Elim: the
Grecians mistake the later for the former. The Poets fiction of Minerva the
Goddess of wisdom, her being produced out of Jupiters head, seems to be drawn
from the Scriptures relation of Christ, the wisdom of God, his eternal
Generation Prove: 8.23. Prove. 8.23.
etc. as eloquent Du Bosc. (Pastor of the Reformed Church at Caen) observed in
a Sermon preached at Caen. Lastly the Tradition of Bacchus's being taken out of
Jupiters thigh, is supposed, by Bochart, to be but a Tradition of the
Patriarchs proceeding ex femore Jacobi, out of Jacobs thigh mentioned Gen:
46.26. Genesis 46.26.
where the Hebrew words, which properly signify out of Jacobs loins, are, by
an easy mistake from their ambiguity, translated by the Greek and old Latin,
out of Jacobs thigh: whence sprang this Fable etc. Thus we have shown how the
many fabulous Names, Genealogies, and Attributes given unto Jupiter, had their
original, by Satanick imitation, from sacred story, Names, and Persons etc.

CHAP. II. The Theogonie of Juno etc. of Hebrew origination.
Juno the same with Jana from (...) Jah, Gods name. Juno called Diana, Urania,
Belisama, Astarte etc. The original of Astarte, 1 Kings 11.5,33. Why she is
said to have on her head a Bulls Head. Jo the same with Juno. Isis the same with
Juno. Venus, among the Phenicians, the same with Juno. The British Adraste, and
Saxon Easter from Astarte. Juno styled Baaltis, Ier: 7.18. and 44.17,18. Juno
styled by the Arabians Chiun Amos 5.26. Which is the same with the Egyptian
Rephan Act. 7.43. whereby Bochart understands Saturn. Juno Nabo, Esa. 46.1.
Juno Anitis, Here, Esa. 34.12. Chora, Libera, Proserpine.

. 1. The Theogonie of Juno.
HAving given the Genealogy of Saturn and Jupiter, with their parallel in
sacred story; we now proceed to Juno (whom the Mythologists make to be the
sister and wife of Jupiter) with endeavors to demonstrate, that the chief Names
and Fables given to this Goddess, were of Hebrew origination. And to give a
general key to this, (...), Theogonie, or Generation of the Gods, we must know,
that the two chief Gods amongst the Heathens, were the Sun and Moon: to which
they attributed most of those sacred Names, Attributes, and Stories, (which
really belonged to the true God, or some one of the Patriarchs) traduced to
them by broken Traditions. Thus they applied the chief names of God to the Sun;
which some termed Saturn, others Jupiter, others Apollo, others Ianus, etc. 1.
Juno the same with Jana, from (...), the name of God.
So in like manner they styled the Moon Urania, Juno, Iana, Diana Venus, etc.
And as the Sun was called Jupiter from (...) ja (...), and Ianus, from the same
(...) Jah; so also the Moon was called first Iana, and thence Juno, from (...)
jah, the proper name of God. So Vossius de Idololatr. lib. 2. cap. 26. Juno
(says he) is referred to the Moon; which Grammarians derive from juvo: but
this is not more likely, than that Jupiter should be derived from the same
root. I conceive that Juno is of the same origination with Janus and Jana,
which comes, not from Javan, but from (...) jah, the proper name of God; (as
Iacchus from (...) ja Chus) so amongst the ancient Romans Jana and Juno were
the same. But O in women is the Grecanick termination; as Dido etc. A is no
less Roman than Greek. But the change of A into V is very ordinary, as Calamus
into Culmus etc. Thus Vossius: the like he mentions before lib. 2. cap. 16.

. 2 Juno called Diana.
Hence some make Juno to be the same with Diana, which they suppose to be the
contract of Dea Jana. So Vossius de Idololatr. lib. 2. cap. 25. The Latin Diana
(says he) is the contract of Diva Jana, or Dea Jana, and both the same with
the Moon; which, according to the diversity of its influences, was styled by
the Romans Diana or Juno. For when the Moon was considered with regard to her
illumihation, she was styled Diana: thence the Roman-hunters, who needed light
by night called upon Diana, not on Juno. But when the calefactive or generative
influence of the Moon came under consideration, she was called, not Diana, but
Juno: whence persons with child invocated Juno, not Diana. Thus Vossius.

. 3. Urania.
Whence also Juno was styled by the Greeks (...), and by the Phenicians,
Belisama. As for (...) Urania, it evidently received its origination from the
Hebrew (...) Or or Ur; which signifies Light, as Genesis 1.5. (...) Or: whence the
Greek (...). Heaven etc. Belisama.
Of the same import also is the Hebrew or Phenician Belisama, from (...) the
Queen of Heaven, which was the Title the Phenicians gave the Moon; as they
styled the Sun (...) the Lord of Heaven; or, in one word, (...) Molech, the
King. All which seems borrowed from Genesis 1.16. Genesis 1.16.
This name Belisama was not confined to the Phenicians, but by them
communicated to these Western parts, as Bochart Can. lib. 1. c. 42. Belisama,
a Gallick name, in the Punick signifies the Queen of Heaven, and therefore
seems to appertain to the Moon, or Urania, which in Jeremiah is frequently
styled the Queen of Heaven, (...). The Moon is the same also with Diana, which
the Gauls greatly idolized. Thus Bochart: who here joins Belisama, Urania, and
Diana, as one and the same.

. 4. Astarte.
The same Juno was also styled by the Phenicians (...) Astarte, which is
evidently of Hebrew origination. So August. lib. 7. locut. cap. 16. Juno (says
he) was without doubt called by the Phenicians Astarte. Why Astartewas said to
impose on her head a Bulls head.
Thus Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 33. Sanchoniathon in Eusebius praepar. lib. 1.
calls Astarte the daughter of Heaven; of whom he says, (...): She put on her
own head, as an Ensign of Empire, the head of a Bull. This gives us a good
account of her origination, which Vessius de Idololatr. lib. 2. cap. 21. thus
draws forth. The Moon (says he) is here called Astarte. Now the Buls-head is a
good Emblem of the Moon, which has her horns like those of a Bull: whence
also the Egyptian Isis, which was the same with the Moon, had horns in like
manner. Thus Vossius. Who again de Idololatr. lib. 1. cap. 22. tells us, that
this Astarte was, according to Sanchoniathon, a Phenician. And that she was
worshipped by the Phenicians as a Goddess, we are taught out of the Scripture, 1
King. 11.5. 1 King. 11.5.
And Solomon went after Astoreth, the Goddess of the Sidonians; where it is in
the singular (...) Ashtoreth. Chald: (...) Astarata, whence contractedly,
(...), or Astarta. And because (...) signifies a flock, or, as some of the
Rabbines think, femal sheep, therefore Rabbi D. Kimchi supposes, that her
Image was the figure of a Sheep. Others more likely judge, that she was called
Astarte, because sheep were sacrificed to her. But these opinions are not
repugnant. This Astarte, as an Animal Goddess, was the daughter of Agenor,
King of Phenicia, who, after she was made a Goddess, was called Astarte by the
Phenician Priests, as Lucian. lib. de Dea Syria relates. etc. But Bochart Can.
lib. 2. cap. 2. fol. 787. following Kimchi and other of the Hebrews, draws the
original of Astarie, as also of this Fable touching her wearing a Bulls head,
from the signification of the Hebrew (...) Astoreth, which signifies herds of
sheep, or Kine; thus Astarte, in the Syriack (...) Astarta, amongst the Hebrews
is (...) Astoret, 1 King. 11.5.33. 1 King. 11.5.33.
hence the plural (...) Astaroth, herds. So Deuteronomy. 7.13. Deuteronomy. 7.13.
(...) the herds of thy sheep. Thus all the Hebrews explain it, and will, that
the Idol Astarte have the figure of a sheep. I conceive the word (...) Astaret
may be taken in a more extensive notion, and signify as well herds of Kine, as
of Sheep. Truly the Chaldee on Deuteronomy. 7.13. renders the Hebr. (...) by (...),
and the Arabic by (...), which are words common, and signify as well herds of
cattle, as of sheep. So Joel 1.18. and Genesis 32.16. Thus there being included in
the name Astarte the signification of a Bull, as well as that of a Sheep, thou
may with ease understand, why she is said to impose on her head, the head of
a Bull, as the Ensign of her Empire, i.e. a kind of Crown made in the fashion
of a Bulls head: in which habit she is described by Sanchoniathon, as (...),
traversing the whole Earth: Astarte the same with Io.
so that she seems to be the same with the Greek Io, who, being changed into a
Cow, is feigned to have viewed many countries. To which concurres that in
Euripides Phaenissis, how the Thebans and Phenicians account Io the same with
the common mother. Thus Bochart. By which we understand the full origination of
Astarte, as also why she was said to impose on her head, as a Crown, the Bulls
head: namely because (...) signifies a herd of Cattle.

. 5. Io the same with Juno.
Hence also the fable of Io her being turned into a Cow. For Io was the same
with Junno, it being a contract thereof, if not of (...) the name of God, as
before. And it is possible, that this whole fable of Juno, here called Astarte,
her having a bulls head for a crown; as also of her being changed-into the form
of a Cow, under the name Io, had all the same original with that of Isis, (who
passed for Io, and had also the form of an Ox, Bull, or Cow,) namely from
Joseph's fat and lean kine, which were the means of preserving Egypt from
famine, and therefore made the Hieroglyphick of their chiefest Gods, Apis and
Io, i.e. Jupiter and Juno. Isis the same with Io and Juno.
That Io is the same with Juno, appears farther from the description of the
Egyptian Isis, which they make to be the same with the Greek Io, and therefore
give her the same form, as Herodotus, in Euterpe: (...), The image of Isis is
feminine, formed with bulls horns, as the Greeks describe Io. By which it is
evident, that the Greek Io, was the same with the Egyptian Isis, and both these
the same with the Phenician Astarte; they having all one and the same image and
form, namely a crown, after the fashion of a bulls head; which was an
Hieroglyphick representing the Moon, but originally taken, as it is conceived,
from Joseph's kine; as Joseph himself passed amongst them for Apis, from (...)
Ab, father, as he is styled a father to Pharaoh, Genesis 45.8. whence Serapis from
(...) a Bull.

. 6. But to return again to Astarte, and her identitie with Juno or the Moon;
which may farther be proved from that of Lucian, de Dea Syria: (...): There is
also another Temple in Phenicia, which the Sidonians have, and, as they say,
belongs to Astarte. And I conceive Astarte to be the Moon. But here occurs a
difficulty arising from the opinion of many Ancients, that Astarte is the same
with Venus. So Philo Byblius out of Sanchoniathon, (...): But the Phenicians
say, that Astarte is Venus. So also Suidas, (...); Astarte, which is called by
the Grecians, Venus. Venus amongst the Phenicians the same with Juno.
This difficulty is resolved by Vossius Idololatr. lib. 2. cap. 21. thus. In
the oriental parts Venus and Juno signify one and the same Planet, viz. the
Moon, which has the government of moist bodies. So that hereby its easy to
reconcile the differences, so opposite, touching the Goddess of Hieropolis,
which we find joined together by Plutarch in M. Crassus, (...). The first omen
was given to him by this Goddess, whom some call Venus, some Juno, others that
Goddess which affords the principles and seeds for all things out of moisture.
By which description its apparent, that this Hieropolitan Goddess (I suppose
Isis) was no other than the Moon, which, by reason of its moisture, was
esteemed to be the passive Principle (as the Sun, called Osiris, the active) of
all Generations, and so called by some Juno, by others Venus. Astarte and Venus
the same.
So learned Bochart, Can. lib. 2. cap. 16. fol. 850. With some Astarte is
Venus, with others Urania and the Moon: but nothing is more uncertain than the
deliries or dreams of the Mythologists touching their Gods. So Tertullian:
Every Province has his God; as Syria Astartes, and Africa the Celestial Urania.
This Goddess Astarte, called by the Africans Ourania, and by the Grecians
Juno, was transported by the Phenicians, and worshipped almost in all parts where
ever they came. We find her worshipped in the Island Erythia, betwixt the Gades
and Spain, which was possessed by the Phenicians, and by them termed (...)
Astoreth; or (...) Astarta, i.e. the Island of Astarte: whence it was called by
other (...), as by others (...) the Island of Venus, or Juno; because Astarte
passed sometimes for Venus, sometimes for Juno: as Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap.
34. fol. 679. Again the Phenicians transplanting a colonie into Cythera, they
there erect a Temple to their God Astarte, then unknown to the Grecians: whence
Venus was styled Cytharea; because, say the Mythologists, arising out of the
Sea, (ie. Phenicia,) she first sat down at Cythera. The British Adraste the
same with Astarte.
Yea we find some footsteps of this Goddess Astarte, and her worship amongst
our old Britains. So Dion in Nero, brings in a British Amazon, called
Bundovica, with her hands lift up to Heaven, thus praying: I give thee thanks,
O Adraste, and invocate thee, thou Mother of Mothers. Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap.
42. fol. 738. makes this Adraste the same with Astarte, by the transposition of
D and T, which are of the same Organ. Easter from Astarte.
To which the same Bochart adds fol. 751. And to Astarte the Phenician God,
alludes Aestar or Easter that Saxon Goddess, to whom they sacrificed in the
month of April; which Bid, in his book de Temporibus, styles Easter-moneth.
Yea to this very day the English call their Paschal Holy Days, Easter-time. So
that the Hebrews would have the Germans the progeny of the Cananites. Thus
Bochart: who also cap. 44. proves, that the Island Astarte, in the Arabic
sinus, was so called from this Goddess Astarte, to whom the Phenicians
consecrated this Island. Astarte amongst the Hebrews Astaroth.
Lastly this Goddess Astarte got no small footing in the Jewish Church,
passing amongst the Hebrews under the name of Ashtaroth: as 2 King. 23.13.
where Solomon is said to build a Temple to Ashtaroth, the Idol of the
Sidonians: which the LXX render (...) Astarte. And 1 King. 31.10. the Temple of
Astaroth is called by the LXX (...); which the Scholiast expounds (...). So
Judge: 10:6. the LXX reads it (...), as also the Vulgar Latin. See Vossius
Idololatr. l. 2. c. 21.

. 7 Juno styled Baaltis.
Juno was also called, by the Phenicians, Baaltis or Beltis, whom some make the
same with Dione: so Philo Byblius out of Sanchoniathon in Eusebius: praep. Evang.
l. 1. (...) And thence Saturn gave the City Byblius to Baaltis, who was also
called Dione. The same Philo Byblius makes Baaltis sister to Astarte: but
Vossius ( de Idololat: lib. 2. cap. 21.) proves that Baaltis can agree to none
so properly as to Juno or the Moon, called also Astarte: for as Baal or Belus,
the Title which the Phenicians gave the Sun, passed amongst the Grecians for
Jupiter, so Baaltis, the Moon, for Juno, The same also may be said of Beltis:
namely as Saturn, or Jupiter, or Apollo were styled (...) whence (...); so
Rhea, or Juno, or Diana (...) bela whence (...): whence Baaltis or Beltis, from
(...) Baal or (...) Bell, signifies Queen, answerable to Jeremiah (...) Queen of
Heaven Ier: 7.18. and Chap. 44.17,18,19,25. Jer. 7.18. and 44.17,18.
It Is true David Kimchi, and the Chaldee Paraphrase understand by this Queen of
Heaven, the Sun it self, i:e: Molech or Saturn, to which learned Bochart (as I
had it from his own mouth) inclines. But Vossius, following Jerome herein, seems
to give very probable conjectures that this Queen of Heaven is the Moon; and so
the same with Astarte, Juno and Baaltis; which appears 1. from that (...) is a
Feminine. 2. Because the Prophet in these places treats of the Idolatry of the
Gentiles; amongst whom the Sun was not reputed a Goddess but God. 3. It Is not
to be doubted but that Baal and Astaroth, amongst the Sidonians, were distinct
Gods, and that the former denoted the Sun, and the later the Moon. That this
Title Baaltis is of Hebrew origination from (...) a sacred name (as Hos. 2.16.)
has been before sufficiently proved. It seems to refer to Genesis 1.16,18.

. 8. Juno called Chiun.
Juno or the Moon was styled by the Arabians Chiun, of which we find mention
Amos 5.26. and Chiun. Amos. 5.26.
Some by Chiun understand Saturn: and indeed (...) Chivvan, the name whereby
the Arabians and Persians denote Saturn, is very near akin to this (...) Chiun
here, though not without some difference, at least, in the points. Hebraeorum
quidam existimant Chiun signisicare Saturni Stellam [(...) iis dictam] quae in
Arab^ca and P^rsica lingua dicatur (...) cui voci cum (...) (mutatis modo
punctis jbene convenit. Ita and Arias Montanus. Glass. Gram. S. l. 4. Tract. 3.
Observe. 17. de nomine proprio.
But that Chiun here cannot be understood of Saturn, seems probable to
Vossius: because there precedes the mention of Molech, who is Saturn;
therefore Chiun, which follows, must be distinct from Saturn i.e. the Sun; and
cannot be understood of any more properly, than of the Moon or Juno. That Chiun
signifies the Moon, the same Vossius de Idololatr. lib. 2. cap. 23. proves from
the propriety of the word, and its Identitie with Rempham Act. 7.43. Yet
Bochart by Chiun understands Saturn: so Bochart Phaleg. l. 1. c. 15. The
Egyptian word Rephan for Saturn, as Molech for Mars, is also at this day in
use among the Coptites, whose tongue is composed partly of the Greek, partly of
the old Egyptian. Whence a clear light may be given to Stephen the Martyrs
words, Acts 7.43. (...), or as others will (...), or (...): In the
interpretation of which words, Interpreters have hitherto been puzzled, not
comprehending why the Hebrew word (...) Kijun should be rendered Rephan. For so
it is read in Amos 5.26. But now the reason is manifest (...) Kijun, according
to the attestation of Aben Ezra, is Saturn, and this name he had also among
the Persians and Ismaelites. Whence the Egyptians were persuaded that Anubis,
which the Greeks term Cyon, was the same with Saturn, as Plutarch in Iside.
Also in Plauti Paenulo Saturn is called Ciun, as Samuel Petit Miscellan. lib.
2. cap. 2. Therefore (...) is the same with the Egyptian Rephan i.e. Saturn.
And the Greek Interpreters (whom Stephen follows) did the more readily use this
Egyptian word Rephan because they wrote their version in Egypt etc. Touching
Chiun Amos 5.26. and how Remphan Acts 7.43. answers thereto see more largely
Glassius Gram. S. lib. 4. Tract. 3. Observe. 17. page 867. etc. Edit. 2a. That
Chiun was an Attribute borrowed, though not without blasphemy, from the sacred
Oracles, was attested by Learned Le Moyen (Pastor of of the Reformed Church at
Roan) in a Sermon at Caen, who affirmed, that (...) Chiun in the Arabic,
signifies the same with Jehovah in the Hebrew.

9. Juno Nabo.
The Moon or Juno was called also by the Chaldeans and Assyrians Nebo: so Esa:
46.1. Esa. 46.1.
Bell boweth down, Nebo stoopeth etc. The Prophet here mentions the two chief
Babylonian Idols. That Bell signifies the Sun, from the Hebrew (...) El, Gods
name, whence (...) Hell, and (...) the Sun, has been before proved. Hence, by
proportion and parity of reason, Nebo or Nabo signifies the Moon: and as from
Bell came Belus, Nimrods name, so from Nabo came Nabuchodonosor, Nabonasser,
with others.

. 10. Anitis.
Amongst the Persians Juno, or the Moon was called Anaitis or Anitis, whom some
suppose to be Diana, others Venus. But Vossius de Idololatr. lib. 2. cap. 22.
proves, that Diana, Juno, and Venus, in those Oriental parts, signified one and
the same Deity; namely the Moon, called by the Persians Anitis: according to
that of Strabo, lib. 11. The Medes and Armenians religiously worship all the
Sacreds of the Persians; but the Armenians more especially worship Anaitis, to
whom they consecrate their Daughters, men and maid servants, giving her also
Temples in Acilisena etc.

. 11. Juno styled Here, and whence.
Juno was termed by the Grecians (...) Here, which is derived by Vossius de
Idololatr. lib. 2. cap. 26. from (...) aer, by a wonted Metathesis or
transposition of Letters: and the reason he gives of this origination is taken
from the regence or presidence of the Moon, called Juno, over the Air. For as
Jupiter was taken to be Lord of the Sky, and therefore sometimes styled
Ether; so Juno, or the Moon, was reputed as Queen, or Regent over the Air,
next unto her, on which she diffused moist influences, and was thence termed
(...). But I should rather fetch the origination of (...) Here, from the Hebrew
(...) Hoar, or, as the Chaldee reads it, (...) Here, libera, a name given to
Juno, as well as to Proserpine. For the Hebrews termed Princes (...) Horim,
i.e. Liberi, free men: so Esa. 34.12. Esa. 34.32.
where the Chaldee reads it (...) Herin, whence sprang (...) Heroes, and, as I
presume, (...) Here, which signifies Libera, a Princess, as Juno was reputed
to be.

. 12. Juno called Chora, Libera, or Proserpine.
Hence also Juno was styled by the Greeks (...) Core, i.e. according to the
Latins, Proserpine, Libera: so Servius on Aen. 3. where having showed how
Latona brought forth first Diana, and then Apollo, he subjoins concerning the
first: for this is Diana, Juno. Proserpina. The Moon was called either supera,
above, and so she was the same with Ceres; or infera, beneath, and so she was
identick with Proserpine, who was called (...) Cora, because the daughter of
Ceres. Which originally sprang from (...) Hora or Kora, libera. Whence Vossius
de Idololatr. lib. 2. cap. 28. tells us, that the Moon, as she enlightened the
lower parts, was called Libera, or Cora, the Sister of the Sun, (who, as he
enlightened the lower parts, was called Liber) and daughter of Ceres.

companion, Silenus, from Silo, Genesis 49.10,11,12. and Pan from the Shepherd of
Israel. The Bacchae their lamentation from Prove. 23.29. etc.

. 1. The several Ages after the Flood.
THe (...), or Generation of the Gods, may be reduced to the sundry Ages after
the Flood, whereof the Poets made four. The first they called the golden Age,
wherein Saturn reigned, Righteousness and Peace flourished, and all things
were enjoyed in common; which Bochart Phaleg. lib. 4. cap. 12. refers to the
first hundred years after the Flood, even unto Phalegs birth. 2. Then follows
the Silver Age, wherein Jupiter reigned, and men began to divide the Earth, to
till the ground, to build houses, according to that of the Poet, Tum primum
subiere domos etc. namely in this Age began the structure, not only of private
habitations, but also of that vast, impious Fabric, the Tower of Babel: whence
followed, 3. The Brazen Age, wherein sprang up Nimrod, who proved first an
Hunter, and then a Warrier, or mighty Tyrant; who converting his designs from
Beasts to Men, by Tyranny erected an Empire: as Virg. Georg. 1. Tum laque is
captare feras, and fallere visco,
Juventum, and magnos canibus circundare saltus.
Bacchus his Names and Attributes from sacred Traditions.
Now in this Age flourished Bacchus, who is supposed by the Mythologists to be
the son of Jupiter, but by Bochart to be the same with Nimrod; though some
refer him to Noah, and others to Moses; as hereafter. And here, in prosecution
of our undertaking, we shall endeavor to demonstrate, that the many fabulous
narrations of Bacchus, his Names, and Attributes, were but corrupt and broken
imitations of Jewish Names and Traditions. Thus Sandford de descensu lib. 1..
17. where having attested, that the names of Bacchus, Iacchus, Euvius, Adonis,
and Sabus, were of sacred or Hebrew origination, he shows, how those
acclamations Hie and Euvion made to Bacchus, were certain names of Jehova,
Whereby the Ancients in their solemn feasts, called upon the true God; but in
following times, vice abounding, these sacred Titles were given to their Idol
Gods. Whence he concludes thus. Hence the Thebans, Colonie of the Sidonians, to
whom the Religion of the Jews (their neighbors) was known, being willing that
their Citizen, the son of Semeles should be inserted into the number of their
Gods, they thought it most advised, to traduce, not only Acclamations, and
Names, but also festival days, and Ceremonies, and things done, from the
Histories of the Jews. Therefore we see that those things which are
commemorated in the sacred Scripture, as most worthy to be known by the
Worshippers of Jehova, are many of them, albeit confused, and detorted unto a
fable, transferred on Bacchus. Therefore Lactantius had what we would, when he
truly said: that those things which the Poets spoke were true, but disguised
or veiled over with appearance or shadow. Which appearance has place especially
in the names of the Gods; which he shows; saying: That the lies of the Poets
were not in the Fact, but in the Name. And truly he calls those lies, which often
are feigned in the Name; whereas they well understood the fiction: yea the more
c^nning Priests of the Gods understood the same, albeit they conceled it from
the common people. Thus Sandford.

. 2. 1. Bacchus from (...) the son of Chus.
We shall begin with Baechus his Names; and first with his chief Name Bacchus,
which (as Bochart observes) is evidently derived from the Hebrew (...)
Bar-chus, the son of Chus i:e: Nimrod, whence those (...) in Bacchus's garment,
as also in his chariot (...) i.e. Tigres; which are allusions to the name
Nimrod, or Nebrodes: as. 4. 2. Iacchus from Jah Chus.
2. As for his Greek name (...) it seems identick, or the same with the Hebrew
(...) jachus i.e. Jah the son of Chus. Thence also in the Oracle of Clarius
Apollo, the name Iao is attributed to Bacchus; whence some derive the name Io
bacchus i.e. the God Bacchus. Now that Iah and Iao are but contracts of Gods
essential name (...) we have already proved chapter 1.. 8. of this Book: of which
more hereafter. Also Iacchus, according to the Syriack is (...) or (...) Iacco,
i:e: a child sucking: the letter ^lying hid in Daghes. Whence that of Orpheus
(...) the child Iacchus. 3. Dionysus from Exodus 17.15. Jehova Nissi.
3. Bacchus, from the place of his education, was called Dionysus; so Plutarch
makes mention of the flight (...) of Dionysus. This name Bochart (Canaan
praef.) fetches from Ezod. 17.15. Iehova Nissi. Concerning Nysa the City
sacred to Bacchus, Homer, being taught by the Phenicians, writes thus, in his
hymn of Bacchus (...)
(...)
Namely, Nysa or Nyssa is a mountain in Arabia, near Egypt where is extant this
Inscription of Moses Exodus 17.15. (...) Jehovah N^ssi i.e: the Lord is my
Banner. In hac Arabica India, quam Moses incoluit primo, postea perlustravit,
omnia illa Bacchi loca nullo negotio inveniemus. Sandf. Descens. l. 1.. 18.
But the Phenicians interpret it, the God Nisaeus, and the Grecians (...); as
if the name sprang from the mountain Nisa. So Bochart. Others derive Bacchus's
name Dionysus from the mountain Nysa, which, by a transposition of the letters,
they make to be the same with Syna. Thus Sandford de Descensu l. 1.. 18. This
Nysa, of which there is so much mention in the History of Bacchus, is of all
most famous; namely, because from Nysa he was called Dionysus. But what the
Poets call the Nysa of Bacchus, is with us no other than Moses's Syna: for by
the artifice of anagrammatisme, Syna is made Nysa; as the very testimony of
our senses prove. And the very situation accords. For albeit some later
Geographers seek for Nysa among the Indians, yet the most ancient fix it in
the proper place; so as it agrees well with the sacred History (touching
Syna). So Herodotus places Nyssa above Egypt; and Diodorus Siculus lib. 4.
'twixt Egypt and Phaenicia. 4. Bacchus was also called (...) Attes, according
to that of the Rhodian Oracle. Magnum Atten placate Deum; qui castus Adonis,
Evius est largitor opum, pulcher Dionysus.
Attes. Hues.
What the proper import of this name was, the Grecians know not: so Eustath.
Odyss. ( p 592.23.) (...). It is not for us to find out the origin of Atta.
neither has it any Interpretation. But what they knew not, the Hebrews well
understood. For (as Sandford de descensu Christi l. 1.. 15.) Atta, as all know,
is the same with the Hebrew (...) atta Thou, which the Scripture often applies to
God, as Ps. 90.1, Thou Lord. Whence also the Grecians added to Attes, Hues. So
Demosthenes Hues Attes, Attes Hues. This Hues Sandford makes to be the same
with Jehovah, and so Attes Hues to be no other than (...) atta Jehovah, Thou
Lord; which often occurs in the Psalms of David, and was thence traduced by
the Grecians, and applied to their Idol Bacchus. Bochart Can. l. 1. c. 18.
derives (...) from (...) Hues, thou art fire, Deuteronomy. 4.24.
Deuteronomy. 4 24. 5. Zagreus.
5. Bacchus was styled likewise (...) Zagreus. i.e. a mighty Hunter, from the
character given unto Nimrod Genesis 10.9.
Genesis 10.9, where it is said he was a mighty hunter before the Lord etc. as
hereafter. 4. 6. Liber.
6 Bacchus was also called Liber, according to the proper import of the Hebrew,
(...) Horim, which signifies Princes, i.e. free men; whence the name Heroes
etc. of which also hereafter. 4. 7. Thriambus Lychirambus Dithyrambus.
7. The names Thriambus, Lythirambus, and Dithyrambus given to Bacchus, are one
and the same, though variously inflexed; which the Syrians express by (...)
dithere abhan, which signifies (...) from the fiction of Bacchus's being twice
borne, as hereafter. 8. Brisaeus.
8. Bacchus was also called Brisaeus, from (...) briz doubsa, that is, a lake
of honey; from the Fable, of his traveling through a land of Honey, which
refers to Canaan. 9. Jao.
9. Several other proper names of God were given unto Bacchus as ja, jao,
whence Jo Bacchus from (...) and (...). That Jao is the same with (...) or
(...), is made evident by Sanfordus de Descens, l. 1.. 10. It appears, says
he, that the Tetragrammon, or four lettered Name Jehovah, was known not only by
the sound, but also, by its Country and origination; for they pronounced it
Jao, and, as Hebrew, interpreted it out of the Hebraicks. -- Then he adds. 11.
that Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origin, Eusebius, Epiphanius, and Theodoret, make
Iao to be the same with Jehovah Gods essential name. See what follows c. 8..
11. Heinsius Aristarcho. S. cap. 1. and Glassius (after him) Grammat. S. lib.
4. tract. 3. observe. 5. tell us, that Bacchus was styled Iacchus, from (...)
Gods name. Eleleu Hie, est insissimum Hebraeorum Hallelujah. Sanford de
descensu Chapter l. 1.. 5.
And from Hallelujah sprang that famous Greek acclamation to Bacchus, (...);
which was translated (from the Jewish Church) by the enemy of mankind, for a
contumely of the Divine name. 10. Adonis.
10. Bacchus was called also Adonts, and Adoneus, from (...) Adonai. That
Adonis received its origination from (...) Adonai, God's name, Sandford de
descensu Christi l. 1.. 9 proves thus: That Adonis descended from Adonai, is
sufficiently proved by the testimony of our senses, ( viz. eyes and ears.)
This Adonai had among the Hebrews a vicarious power in the place of Jehovah: --
for its very probable, that the Hebrews abstained from sounding the sacred name
Jehovah, when they perceived it was traduced by the Gentiles, to signify their
Idols. The like he affirms of Adonis. 15. 11. Eleleus.
11. Bacchus was also styled Eleleus, from (...): El eloah. 12. Evius.
12. Evius, from (...): 13. Sabus.
and 13. Sabus, from (...) Sabbath: (as Plutarch. Sympos. 4.) Heinsius,
Aristarcho S. cap. 1. makes Sabus or Sabasius, Bacchus's name among the Greeks,
to be derived from (...), to drink down full draughts of Wine: so Bochart; but
Sandford derives it from (...). See Sanford, de descens. Chr. l. 1.. 13, 14.
All these being names peculiar to the holy God, were, by a blasphemous
imitation applied to this Idol God, Bacchus.

. 3. But to pass on to Bacchus's Geuealogie; first, some there are who refer
the original of Bacchus to Noah; and that not without some seeming likelihood,
which may be drawn 1. from their cognation in name: Bacchus or Boachus, having
much the same sound with Noachus, though this is not of much weight. 2 Bacchus
is said to be the first inventor of Wine, which exactly answers to the
character the Scripture gives of Noah, that he first planted Vines etc. Genesis
20,21.

But the chief contest amongst the Learned, is concerning Moses and Nimrod; to
which of these two Bacchus owes his original. Vossius refers him to Moses;
Bochart to Nimred. I conceive we may take in both, without any contradiction.
For it is evident, that those blind Mythologists, who brought in these
Genealogies of the Gods, were not so distinct and uniforme in the application
of their oriental broken Traditions, as to keep close to Persons; but admitted
a very great latitude herein; some applying their stories to one person, some
to another; some a piece to one, and a piece to another, as they affected. Thus
some referred the stories of Nimrod, others those of Moses, to their Idol
Bacchus. Bacchus the same with Moses.
We shall begin with those who make Bacchus originally the same with Moses. So
Sandfordus de descensu Christi ad inferos lib. 1. Sect. 17.18.19. Whoever shall
examine all the Reasons of Truth in this Theology of Bacchus, will find that
the true Bacchus was Moses, or the true God of Moses: and that those things
which are chiefly mentioned of Bacchus, are only fabulously to be referred to
the Theban Bacchus, or also to Osiris, whom ( according to Herodotus) the
Egyptians affirm to be Bacchus. So Owen Theol. l. 1. c. 8. Voss. Idol l. 1. c.
30. by whom we find an exact parallel drawn 'twixt Bacchus and Moses in these
particulars. Pergit Orpheus Bacchi sui natalis eum in modu^ celebrare, ut
Baccho insanior sit oportet, qui non videat, eum Mesis potius incunabula, quam
alterius cujuspiam, depingenda suscepisse. Sandfordus de descensu Christi lib.
1.. 18.
1. As Moses, so Bacchus was feigned to have been borne in Egypt. 2. Orpheus
calls Bacchus (...), a name of the same origination with Moses. So Sandfordus de
descensu Christi l. 1.. 18. There is extant in Orpheus a Hymn, wherein he
celebrates Mises; whom in the first verse he styles Dionysus, and in the third
Iacchus. Now Mises differs not from Moses save in punctuation etc. 3. Bacchus
is said to have been shut up in an Ark, and imposed on the waters; as Moses
was. Thus Sandford de descensu Christi lib. 1.. 18. Moses 's Ark, as also his
danger in the waters, and deliverance thence, was known to diverse Nations,
albeit by several, variously, and that most fabulously, detorted unto Bacchus
etc. 4. Bacchus is made to be beautiful in form, and (...), one that had two
Mothers; as Moses. Thus also Sandford de descensu Chr: l. 1.. 18, Moses's
Adoption was also known: therefore the Poets fable Bacchus to be Bimatrem,
double mothered, which they call Isidas. The Egyptians (says Plutarch)
affirm, that Isis, with a pensive mind, and weeping, was, by the maids,
brought to the Queen, and thence made familiar, as also appointed, by the
Queen, to nurse the child. Moreover, Moses's eximious beauty was well known:
for when the Poets say that Bacchus was most beautiful; whom do they paint
forth but Moses? 5. Plutarch makes mention of (...), the flights of Bacchus;
which answers to Moses's flying from Egypt, as Stillingf. origin. S. book 3. c.
5.. 11. So Sandford de Descens. l. 1.. 18. The Banishment of Moses was known,
whence Plutarch (de Iside) says, that Bacchus's banishment was a common song
among the Grecians. Also Moses's flight was a matter of common fame; unto which
Bacchus's flight, so much celebrated by the Poets, refers, as every one ought
to acknowledge: especially seeing those things, which they mention of Bacchus's
flight toward the red Sea, can be understood of none but Moses. 6. Bacchus is
said to be educated in a mount of Arabia, called Nysa; according to that of
Moses, who resided there 40 years. 7. Bacchus was hence called (...) Dionysus,
which (as Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 18.) answers exactly to the inscription of
Moses, on the Altar by him erected, Exodus 17.15.
Exodus 7.15. (...) Jehova Nissi: which Posterity interpreted, the God
Nessaeus, i.e. in Greek (...) Dionysus. 8. Amongst the mysteries or Bacchus,
Serpents are reckoned; which answers to Moses's brazen Serpent. So Sandf. Des.
l. 1.. 18. Moses, at the command of God in the desert of Arabia, made a Brazen
Serpent; according to the image whereof, it was said, that a Serpent was in use
among the sacreds of Bacchus, as Nonnus attests. 9. Bacchus is said to have a
Dog for his companion; which answers to Caleb, Moses's companion, whose name
signifies a Dog. So Sandf. l. 1.. 19. Caleb, who in Hebrew sounds a Dog,
gave rise to that fable of Bacchus's dog, which alone followed him wandering
on the mountains. 10. Bacchus was famous for his passing the red Sea, and wars;
especially for that he had women in his Army; as Moses, in his march toward
Canaan. So Sandford de descens. l. 1.. 18. Moses's expeditions are well known:
for hence it is that Diodorus Siculus, lib. 1. memorates especially two
expeditions of Osiris ( the Egyptian Bacchus,) the one into Aethiopia, the
other into Arabia through the red Sea. 11. In Euripides, the Bacchae are said
to draw water out of a Rock, having struck it with their Rod; and where ever
they went, the Land flowed with wine, milk, and honey. Moses percussa rupe
aquas elicuit: quid aliud sonant a Theatro, illa Euripidis in Bacchis: virga
quis arreptaferit rupem, statim exultat inde rossidus fontis liquor. Sand.
descens. l. 1.. 19.
The first part of this fable answers to Moses's striking the Rock, whence
gushed forth waters: the later part answers to the description of Canaan, which
is said to flow with milk and honey. Exodus 3.8,17. and 13.5. and 33.3. etc.
Whence Bacchus was called Brisaeus, i.e. (...) a lake of honey. 12. Orpheus
calls Bacchus (...), i.e. the Legislator; and so attributes to him (...), as it
were, two Tables of Laws, in imitation of Moses, Ezod. 34.20. 13. Bacchus was
also called bicornis, two-horned; as Moses is usually pictured, from the
mistake of that text Exodus 34.29. the skin of his face shone. To which we may
add what is mentioned in Nonnus's Dionysiacis, that Bacchus having touched the
rivers Orontes and Hydaspes with his rod, and dried them up, he passed over;
and his staff being cast on the ground, it began to creep as a Serpent, and to
wind it self about an Oak. Again, that the Indians continued in darkness,
whilst the Baechae enjoyed the Light. All which exactly answer to the storre of
Moses, as face to face in a glass. 15. Farther, Moses learned on Mount Sinai
the Rites of Sacrifices, and thence taught them to the people: The same is sung
of Bacchus by Ovid. Fast. Ante tuos ortus arae sine honor fuere.
16. Again, Moses was the first that brought in sacred Music: thus in like
manner Strabo lib. 10.453. informs us, that the Bacchick Music was famous
throughout Asia; and that many music Instruments had obtained a Barbarick
name, as Jambla, Sambuke, Barbitos, Magades, etc. which seem all to be of
Hebrew origination. 17. Moreover Moses, with the Princes of the Tribes, (who
are for Honor sake styled in Scripture the sons of Joseph) took the bones of
Joseph, and carried them to Canaan, Exodus 13.19. whence sprang the old Poets
fable of Osiris's bones, and of his sons, etc. For the ancient Osiris, whom Pan
nourished, was Joseph, as Sandford will have it. 18. Lastly, we find a fabulous
mention of Bacchus's Maira, who is referred and seated among the Stars. This
Maira, Sandford, by an easy Anagrapsis, resolves into Maria, or Miriam, who
was Sister to Moses and Aaron. Thus Sandford and Vossius show, in many
instances, how the whole story of Moses was translated to Bacchus. And Bochart
himself grants, that these many parallels could not but be borrowed from sacred
story; though he adds, Yet I cannot collect, with this great man (Vossius,)
that Moses was the Phenician, and Egyptian Bacchus. For it is not likely, that a
person so much hated by these Nations, should be worshipped by them as a benign
God. Only, I think, these Mythologists alluded to the story of Moses; as in
the fable of Silenus, to the Prophecy of Silo. And truly not only the
stories of Moses, but of others also, lie hid in the Mythologicks of Bacchus:
Thus Bochart Canaan lib. 1. cap. 18. fol. 486. which leads us to the following
genealogy of Bacchus.

. 4. Bacchus the same with Nimrod.
Though many pieces of Moses's story and character are applied to Bacchus,
yet, I conceive (with learned Bochart) that the chief Prototype, or original
Idea, according to which Bacchus's picture was drawn, was Nimrod. This may be
demonstrated 1 Bacchus the same with Barchus.
1. from the very name Bacchus, which seems the same with (...) Barchus, the
son of Chus; as also from the Greek (...), the same with (...) Jah of Chus.
Thus Bochart Phaleg lib. 1. cap. 2. Now who sees not, that Nimrod was Bacchus?
for Bacchus is the same with (...) bar-chus, i.e. the son of Chus. Barchus and
Bacchus are the same, as (...) Darmesek, and (...) Dammesek for Damascus. Thus
much the Grecians themselves tacitly hint to us. 1 By making Bacchus to be the
son of Jupiter, as Chus, the father of Nimrod, was the son of Cham, who past
among them for Jupiter, as before. 2. By consecrating unto Bacchus, amongst the
birds (...) the Pie, and amongst the Plants, (...) the Ivy; because he was
(...) Cissius, Hebr. (...) a Chusean, or son of Chus; as Nimrod was. 2 Nebrodes
the same with Nimrod.
2. This is likewise evident from Bacchus's other name (...) Nebrodes, which
Bochart makes to be a derivative from Nimrod, and this from (...) Marad, to
rebel. It is true, some suppose that Bacchus was called Nebrodes, from that
Exuvium hinnuleum, which he, and his Bacchantes were wont to wear: for, say
they, this (...) properly imports. But I should rather think, and say, (as
before. 2.) that Bacchus wore these (...), as also that he had in his Chariot
(...) Tigers, in allusion to his original name (...), or Nimrod. So Bochart
Phaleg lib. 1. cap. 2. The name alludes to (...) Nimra. The Chaldeans call a
Tiger so. Thence Tigers in Bacchus's Chariot. (...) Hinnuli pellis, exuvium
hinnnuleum quod Bacchus and Bacchantes gestare solebant. Bacchus (...) vocari
dicitur, quod Bacchantes hinnulorum pellihus uterentur. Stephan. in (...).
Others rather derive the name from (...) Nebris, and call Bacchus Nebrodes. So
Anthol. lib. 1. c. 38. Epigr. 1. (...)
as if he were clothed with an Hinnulean skin; being ignorant that this is the
very name of Nimrod among the Grecians. See the LXX, Josephus, and others. Thus
Bochart derives Bacchus his name Nebrodes from Nimrod, and this from (...)
Marad, to rebel. Whence this name Nimrod seems to be given unto him, either
Prophetically, or else eventually, after he had rebelled against his Ancestor
Noah; and usurped an universal Empire over his brethren. 3. Zagreus.
Hence, 3. he is styled Genesis 10.9.
Genesis 10.9. a mighty Hunter before the Lord, i.e. most potent, as Jon. 3.3.
Act. 7.20. Luke 1.6. proportionably whereto, Bacchus is also styled (...) a
Hunter: and what is said of Jupiter, that he expelled his father Saturn, i.e.
Noah, from his Kingdom, Bochart applies to Bacchus or Nimrod, who, by reason of
his rebellious usurpation, was called Nimrod; 4. Belus.
and 4. by reason of the extent of his Dominion he was styled Belus. For that
Belus, the Head of the Assyrian Monarchy, was the same with Nimrod (who had
the first name given him from his Dominion, and the later from his Rebellion)
is proved by Bochart, (in his Phaleg: lib. 4. cap. 14. fol: 264.) only the name
Nimrod, in so much as it was contumelious and odious, was obliterated; and that
of Belus only retained by the chaldeans. 5. Liber.
5. To this name Belus, answers that of Liber, given to Bacchus, which Bochart
makes the the same for import, with (...) Horim, liberi free men or Princes;
which is given to the Babylonian Princes Esa. 34.12. where the Chaldee reads it
(...) been herin sons of liberi, or Heroes, Heroes.
For thence the name Heroes was derived. Whence Methodius calls Nimrod (...) the
brother of the Heroes, i:e: in effect Liber, a Prince. 6. Staphylus Bacchus's
son the same with Ninus.
6. The Greek Mythologists themselves, though they are ambitious of vindicating
Bacchus for their country man, yet they acknowledge that Staphylus his son and
Successor was King of Assyria; which is as much as if they had said, that
Bacchus reigned in Assyria. Yea in the Epitaph of Ninus, Nimrods son and
successor, there is mention made of the Bacchae; as Athenae lib: 12.7. Bacchus
is said to be be the God of Wine; because Nimrod was the first that ruled over
Babylon, where that most excellent Wine, celebrated so much among the Poets
under the name of Nectar, was found. So Athenaeus Deipnos: l, 1. Chaereas
(says he) reports that there was a wine in Babylon which the Natives call
Nectar: Owen Theolog. l. 3. c. 8.
which they called also the drink of the Gods, etc. 8. Lastly the expeditions
of Bacchus into the East, even unto India, seem evident References unto Nimrod
and his successors Achievements in those parts, as Bochart Phaleg, l. 1: c. 2.
That Bacchus was the same with Nimrod; and that the whole of his worship was
transported, out of the oriental parts into Greece, by the Phenicians, see
Bochart Can: lib. 1. cap. 18.

. 5. Grecian fables touching Bacchus of sacred original.
But we proceed to give instances of many Fables attributed to Bacchus, which
were originally Traditions from sacred Scripture, Genesis 46.26. Bacchus borne of
Jupiters thigh.
as 1. That Fable, of Bacchus's being borne out of Jupiters thigh: which
Bochart ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 18.) makes to be but a mistaken Tradition from Genesis
46.26. Bacchus (says he) is feigned to have been borne out of Jupiters thigh;
because the Phenicians understand (...) and (...), which properly signify the
thigh, of the verenda; whence that common saying in Scripture, to proceed out
of the thigh of the Father, as Genesis 46.26. Exodus 1.5. etc. So Vossius de
Idololatr: lib. 1. cap. 19. more largely. Genesis 49.11. The blood of the grape.
Deuteronomy. 32.14.
2. In the Tyrian Fable of Bacchus and Icarus, Wine is said to be the blood of
the Grapes; which is an Idiom purely Hebrew; so (...), is used by Jacob Genesis
49.11. and by Moses Deuteronomy. 32.14. Where the Greeks render it (...), as Bochart
Can. lib. 1. c. 18. Bacchus's Ark from 1 Samuel 6.^9.
3. Pausanias, in Achaicis, makes mention of a Fable, touching the Greeks
finding at Troy, (...) an Ark consecrated to Bacchus; which when Eurypilus had
opened, and beheld the statue of Bacchus hid therein, he was presently, at the
very sight thereof, deprived of his senses. 1 Samuel 6.19.
This, says Bochart ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 18.) was taken from 1 Samuel 6.19. where
it is said, that God therefore struck the Betsemites, because they pryed into
his Ark etc. 1 Samuel 6.4,5.
4. There is another Grecian Fable of Bacchus's being angry with the Athenians,
because they dishonored his Sacreds, neither received them with that
solemnity, when they were first brought from Boeotia, unto Attica, by Pegasus:
wherefore he afflicted them with a grievous disease in their privy parts; from
which they could find no remedy, until, being admonished by the Oracle, they
yielded themselves more obsequious to the God; and erected Phallos i:e: certain
Images of those privy parts he had afflicted, for his honor. An egg is not
more like unto an egg, (says Bochart Can: lib. 1. cap. 18.) than this Comment
to the History of the Philistines; who, when God brought upon them the
Haemorrhoides, for their unworthy treatment given the Ark, upon consulting
their Oracle, were answered; that they could not be otherwise cured, than by
consecrating golden Images of the Hamorrhoides to God; which accordingly they
did etc. 1 Samuel 5.9. 1 Samuel 6.4.5. 5. There is another Fable, of Bacchus's
attaining unto Immortality etc. which is evidently a corrupt imitation of the
Scripture account of God. So Sandford de Descensu Christi lib. 1. cap. 17. We
need no way doubt but that belongs to the Great God, which Diodorus Siculus
lib: 3. relates of Bacchus, namely, that among all the Gods Dionysus only
attained to a fixed immortality. To which we might add that of Diodorus lib.
1. and Strabo lib. 17. who affirm, that Osiris (who was the Egyptian Bacchus)
his sepulcher was unknown to the Egyptians; which, says Sandford ( lib. 1..
21.) answers to what is said of Moses, Deuteronomy. 34.6.
Deuteronomy. 34.6. But no man knows of his sepulcher unto this day.

. 6. Bacchus his expeditions into the East.
The whole fabulous story of Bacchus's expedition into the East, seems
evidently no other than a corrupt imitation of the Israe ites passage unto
Canaan under Moses and Joshua; as it may appear by these particulars. 1 Bacchus
his companion Silenus, the same with Silo, mentioned Genesis 49:10,11,12.
1. Bacchus is said to have for his companion Silenus; which fable (as Bochart
makes it very plain) owes its original to the Prophecy of Silo, Genesis 49.10.
This also Justin Martyr long since observed; showing, how the Devils horridly
wrested this Prophecy, to establish the mysteries of Bacchus. 1. To begin with
the name Silenus; it seems apparently the same originally with the Heb. (...)
Silan; and this the same with (...) Silo, the name of the Messiah, the Angel or
messenger, sent by God to conduct Moses and the Israelites unto Canaan. 2.
Hence the Greeks make Silenus to be Bacchus's (...) praecepter or instructor;
as Moses was instructed by Silo, (or the Angel,) who is said to be the Lawgiver
and Instructor of the people, Genesis 49.10. 3. Thence they make Silenus to be
employed in treading out the Grapes: which answers to Silo his character Genesis
49.11. and his clothes in the blood of Grapes. 4. They make Silenus to be
always drunk with wine, and to feed on milk: which fully agrees with what is
prophesied of Silo, Genesis 49.11. his eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth
white with milk. But of this more hereafter. Pan another of Bacchus his
companions.
2. Another of Bacchus's companions was Pan; who is reckoned amongst one of his
chief Commanders, etc. That this fable is also of Jewish original, seems
evident 1. from the very name Pan, which, in the Hebrew (...) Pan, signifies
one that stands astonished, or stupefied with fears, whence Pan is fabled to
send Pannick fears, which gave rise to that proverbial speech, Pannick fear. 2.
Pan is made the God of Shepherds: which fable evidently sprang from that
character of the Messiah, who is styled frequently the Shepherd of Israel; as
hereafter.

. 7. The Bacchae their lamentation.
Bacchus is fabled to have women in his Army, which were called Bacchae, and
Thyades, and Mimallonides, etc. 1. These Bacchae were Prophetesses of Bacchus,
so called, as some think, from (...) to lament, according to that, Ezech. 8.14.
Ezech. 8.14. (...) Mebaccoth, weeping for Tamuz; for it is certain, that the
sacreds of Bacchus were performed with much lamentation and houling. Heinsius,
Aristarcho cap. 1. deduceth the Bacchae (as Bacchus) from (...) ululari, to
houl, or lament; which word Virgil Aen. 7. uses of the Bacchae. Ast aliae
tremulis ululatibus aethera complent,
Pampineasque gerunt incinctae pellibus hastas.
Also he shows, that the lamenting exclamation (...), used by the Bacchae,
flows from the Hebr. (...) heu eheu. Prove. 23.29,30
So in Prove. 23.29,30. (...) vae, is used for immoderate drinking of Wine.
Drusius, lib. 1. Animad. cap. 33. derives the Bacchae's (...) from (...),
answerable to the Syriack (...) a Serpent, Ezech. 8.14. The women which
celebrated Thamuz, or Adonis, whom the Greeks make the same with Bacchus, are
said to be (...) weeping; from (...), i.e. Bacchae, or, according to the Greek,
(...). Whence it appears, that these sacreds were first celebrated in the East,
by these She priests of Bacchus. Thus Heinsius, and Glassius after him. Bochart
( Can. lib. 1. cap. 18. fol. 480.) shows, how these Bacchae cried usually Euoe;
which he derives from Prove. 23.29,30. (...) Euoe, or vae! 2. Thence Bacchus's
Thyades, the same Bochart derives from (...) to wander: because, being overcome
with wine, and fury, they wandered here and there. 3. And so Mimallonides, he
draws from (...) Memallelan, pratlers; according to that Prove. 23.29,30. So
Heinsius, in Aristarcho sacro Cap. 1. supposes, that Mimallonides, Bacchus's
Priests, were so called from the noise and clamor they made. For (...), with
the Chaldeans, signifies pratlers, or garrulous persons. Likewise Thyades, from
(...) to wander, or Stray; which is used Esa. 28.7. for drunkards. So that
Thyades must be the same with (...), ie. such, as being touched with Wine, or
fury, wander up and down: whence Euripides calls the Bacchick Priests (...)
Erraticks, or wanderers, as Glass. Gram. S. l. 4. Tract. 3. obs. 5. Quae in
sacris literis de Jehovae cultoribus dignissima cognitu commemorantur, eorum
pleraque vel confusa, vel ad fabulam deflexa, in Bacchum licet congesta
videamus. Vere igitur Lanctantius: Mend acium Poetarum non est in facto, sed in
nomine. Sandford de descens. l. 1.. 17.


. 8. But I shall conclude this of Bacchus with that of Bochart ( Can. lib. 1.
cap. 18. fol. 486.) These examples (says he) show, that in this fable of
Bacchus there is more than enough, that every where alludes to the rest of the
Scripture: yet so, as that the most of these Fables were fetched from the
history of Moses, because, when the Phenicians first came into Greece with
Cadmus their Commander, the memory of things done by Moses was yet fresh. For
Cadmus lived under Joshuah, and was Captain of those Phenicians, who, to save
themselves from imminent danger, betook themselves to Sea, to search out for
other Countries. Thus we see how these Fables were conveyed into Greece.

CHAP. IV. The Theogonie of Apollo, Mercury, Pluto, Enceladus, and Typhon,
Hebraick.
Apollo, from (...) to destroy, the same with Apolluon, Rev. 9.11. which
answers to the Hebrew (...) Shad, the Devils name, Deuteronomy. 32.17. Apollo called
Pythius, from Phut, or Python. Delus from (...) deel, fear. Exodus 20.23.
Belenus from (...) beel, Lord. Paean, and Iepaeeon from (...), to heal. Eleleus
from Halelujah. A parallel betwixt Apollo's sacreds, and those in the Jewish
Temple and Institutes. The Theogonie of Apollo, as parallel to Joshua: 1. in
Names; as (...) answers to Joshua or Jesus: the like Paean etc. 2. In Stories:
Python slain by Apollo, the same with Og slain by Joshua. (...), which began
and ended the (...), sung to Apollo, the same with Hallelujah. Apollo's
parallel with Phut. Mercuries parallel with Canaan proved by the origination of
his name from (...) Machar, and other Fables. Mercury called Taautus, Theuth,
Momimus, Casmilus. The Theogonie of Pluto: his names Muth, Hades, Axiokersos,
Typhon. Enceladus the same with the Devil, Esa. 27.1. Typhon's original from
Tophet, Esa. 30.33. Typhon's parallel with Moses in 5. particulars. Briareus.

. 1. The Theogonie of Apollo.
WE have given the Genealogy or Theogonie of Saturn, Jupiter, Juno, and
Bacchus; with evident notices of their origination from the Hebrew language,
and sacred Oracles. We now proceed to Apollo, another supposititious son of
Jupiter, whom the Wiser of the Mythologists reputed as their Supreme God; and
therefore termed him the God of Wisdom; whereby they generally understood the
Sun; which being as the eye of the world, and the greatest Natural Efficient of
all sublunary corporeal Effects, might well pass for an Idol God, amongst
those blind Pagans. But, whatever fond conceits these poor Heathens had of
their Idol Apollo, we doubt not but to evince, that his chief Names,
Attributes, and Offices were, by I know not what Satanick imitation, of Hebrew
and sacred Original. Apollo from (...).
And to begin with his chief name Apollo, in Greek (...) a Destroyer, whence,
says Eustathius, Iliad. a. (...), Apollo is so named from apollein to destroy:
which exactly answers to the Hebrew (...) Shad, the Devils name, from (...)
Shadad, to destroy: Deuteronomy. 32.17.
whence Deuteronomy. 32.17. (...) to Devils. Ex Abaddon natus est Apollon, aut, sacra
si quis mavult, Apolluon. Sandf. de descens. l. 1. 6.
We find the same name for substance given the Devil Rev. 9.11. Apollyon, i.e.
a Destroyer, according to the import of the Hebrew Abaddon. So that it is
evident, this name Apollo answers exactly to the Devils name (...) Shad, a
Destroyer. Phoebus, e Jehovah Hoibe: and ex Hoibe sactum esse Phoibe non est
quod quisqua^ dubitat. Sandf. Pythius.
2. Another name of Apollo was (...), which Sandfordus de descens. Christi l.
1.. 16. derives from the Anagrapsis or rescription of Jehovah: whence (says
he) at first came Hoibe, and hence Phoibe; for it is certain, that to words
beginning with a vowel, the Aeoles were wont to prepose a Digamma, the force
whereof is expressed by Phi, whence the ancient Greeks for (...) writ (...). 3.
Another name of Apollo was Pythius, which Bochart derives from Phut the son of
Ham. Genesis 10.6. whence Apollo was said to be the son of Jupiter Hammon, i.e. of
Ham, as before. Thence also they supposed him to have been a Lybian, because
the Posterity of Phut settled in those parts. Others derive Pythius from
Python, and this from (...) Pethen, a Serpent, which Apollo destroyed, as. 3.
Delus from (...) fear.
4. Apollo was also called by the Ancients, Delus: whence the Island, where his
Temple was seated, received the same name. Its true, the Mythologists would
persuade us, that Delus was so named from (...), made manifest; because Latona
lying hid in the Sea, when she was about to bring forth, was made manifest by
Jupiter. But Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 14. gives us a more authentic
origination of Delus, from the Phenician and Hebrew (...) daal, as Belus from
(...) baal. Now (...), amongst the Phenicians signified fear; thence God:
because the main object of their fear was God, according to that of the Poet,
Primus in orb Deos fecit Timor: Fear was the first that made Gods in the
world. Which suits well with the Hebrew Idiom, which expresses the worship of
God under the old Testament, by fear. As also the Grecians expressed their
worship of Demons by (...), Demon fear, Act. 17.22.
Act. 17.22. And that this name (...) or Delus, attributed to Apollo, was of
Hebrew origination, seems probable, in that we find the same word given to the
Gentile Gods frequently, by the Paraphrastes on the old Testament: Exodus 20.23.
as Exodus 20.23. (...) Daalin, Gods of silver. Hence the Island Delus was so
called by the Phenicians, from (...) daal, anciently deel, (as from (...) Neel,
and Nilus.) i.e. the Island of the God Apollo, whose Temple, Name, and Worship
was at first brought into Greece, and fixed in this Island of Delus, by the
Phenicians, as it is made evident by a learned Treatise of Dickinson, styled
Delphi Phoenicizantes. Belenus from (...) beel, Lord.
5. Apollo was also styled by the Ancients Belenus, as it appears, not only by
Ausonius's verse, but also by the Aquileiense Inscription, Apollini Beleno to
Apollo Belenus, as in Gruterus: whence the Spaniards call him Veleno. To which
agrees that of Herodian lib. 8. who for Belenus has (...). Thence also the
Herb, which the Latins styled Apollinaris, the Gauls termed Belinuntia. Now as
Delus was originally the same with the Phenician (...) daal or deel: so
Belenus, or Belin, the same with (...) Baal, or Beel, or Belus, the chief
Phenician God, of which hereafter, chapter 7.. 1. Only, as to our present purpose,
we may take notice, that as the Phenicians termed the Sun, their chief God,
Belus, and Beelsamen, because they reputed him (...) the Lord of Heaven: so
also the Grecians styled their Idol Apollo (...) Belin, or Belenus; supposing
him to be the sun, and so the Lord of Heaven, in imitation of the Phenicians,
who by Satanick inspiration, took the original idea of this their chief God
Belus, and Beelsamen from Divine constitution, whereby the Sun was appointed
Lord of the day, Genesis 1.16.
as Genesis 1.16. which the Phenicians had traduced to them by some broken
Tradition, from the Jews or Patriarchs, (the later is most approved by
Bochart,) as elsewhere. Paean.
6. Apollo was also styled Paean or Paeon, and Iepaeeon, from those sacred
Hymns which were sung unto him, for his victory over Python; which was but an
imitation of Joshua's victory over Og, as in what follows. 3. And because the
Paeans or Hymns sung to Apollo, were both begun and ended with (...) Eleleu
Hie; Eleleus.
thence also Apollo (as Bacchus) was called (...) Eleleus, (...) Hallelujah
convertebatur in (...). Dickins. Phaen. c. 6.
and (...) Jeius from that sacred Hymn sung to the true God (...) Hallelujah
as hereafter.. 2. and 3. and B. 3. c. 1.. 11.

. 2. A Parallel 'twixt Apollo's Sacreds and those of the Jewish Temple.
Thus we have shown how the chief Names of Apollo were of Phenician
immediately, but originally of sacred Derivation. And it is not less easy to
demonstrate, that not only his Names, but also his chief Attributes, Offices,
Temple, Sacrifices, and Oracles were all originally, by, I know not what,
Satanick allusion and delusion, borrowed from the Attributes, Temple,
Sacrifices, and Oracles of the true God worshipped at Jerusalem. A parallel
twixt the Tabernacle Ark, propitiatory and sacrifices of the true God, and the
Cortine, Tripos, Oracles and Sacrifices of Apollo.
Namely, First, as God had his Tabernacle; so Apollo had his Cortine, exactly
answering thereto. 2. As God had in the Tabernacle, his Ark; so Apollo, in his
Cortine, his Tripos. 3. As Gods Ark, so Apollo's Tripos was overlaid with Gold.
4. As God had on his Ark a propitiatory seat, where stood the (...)
Responsorie, which the Priest consulted, and thence gave forth Oracles; so
Apollo had, on his Tripos, a certain seat which the Greeks called (...), on
which his Pythian she Priest or Prophetess sat, and after a pretended
consultation with him, or the Devil under his name, gave forth Oracles. Apollo
is said to learn his Art of Divination from Pan the God of Shepherds: which
fable seems borrowed from the Divine Oracle touching the Messiah, styled the
Shepherd of Israel, etc. 5. As Gods Priests had their Ecstasies, and Raptures,
whilst the spirit of prophecy remained on them; so Apollo's Priests, etc.
Sacred fire.
6. God had his sacred fire always burning on his Altar, Lev. 6.12,13.
Levit. 6.12.13. So also Apollo, proportionable hereto, had his (...) always
burning fire, which they called (...) Estia, as it is supposed from (...) es ja,
i.e. the fire of Jah or Gods Sacred fire: as hereafter Chap. 9.. 2.

Apollo's Paean from sacred Hymns.
7. Apollo had a sacred Hymn dedicated to him, called Paean, consisting of
that solemn acclamation Hie, Hie; and Elelu Hie; which is evidently the same
with that Sacred Hymn Hallelujah. This will appear evident both from the
Original of those Hymns, as the Fable goes, was this: Quid aliud vero suisse
in initio (...), vel (...) putemus quam Hebraeoru^ (...) Hallelujah Dickins.
Delph. c. 6.
Apollo having destroyed the Serpent Python, the first seventh day after he
instituted his Pythick Games, or Holy days; wherein the chief contest was
among those who sung (...), in the Honor of Apollo. That this Pythick
Institution was but a fabulous Tradition, of the Hymns sung by Joshua and the
Israelites, upon their Victory over the Cananites, is proved in what follows..
3. Thus Sandford, Descensu l. 1.. 21. From the Solemn Praises which the
Israelites poured out to God, for the Victories they obtained under the conduct
of Joshua, Jo Paean was sung to Apollo; at least hence Paeanismes, especially
the more ancient, had their rise. This appears from Eustathius's description:
(...) etc. Paean is an Hymn for the cessation of evils either present or to
come. Hence the Athenians called Apollo (...) he that drove away evils. As for
the Proper Idea of Paeanisme; it began with (...): to which they added (...),
or (...), which makes up (...) Eleleuie, the very same with that sacred Hymn
(...) Hallelujah, as hereafter. 3. and c. 9.. 1. and B. 3. c. 1.. 11.

Apollo's Sacrifices.
8. God had his Sacrifices, especially the first fruits of Corn, Wine, and
Oil, Deuteronomy. 14.23. and 18.3.4. Numb. 18.12.
as Deuteronomy. 14.23. Deuteronomy. 18.3.4. Numb. 18.12. In imitation whereof, Apollo, or
the Devil under his form, injoins his Devoto's to sacrifice to him Oblations
of Corn, Wine, and Oil. This appears from the story of Anius, Priest of
Apollo, who, in time of the Trojan war, brought unto the Grecian Tents, great
store of Wine, Corn, and Oil, which he had received as Offerings to Apollo,
etc. Farther, God enjoined the Israelites to offer expiatorie sacrifices, a
escape goat, etc. which were as (...) and (...), expiatorie sacrifices: as Homer
informs us, the Grecians were enjoined by the Priest of Apollo, for the
stopping the Plague, in their Camp, at the Siege of Troy, etc.

9. As Gods name Jah was Sacred in the Jewish Temple; so the Delphick Temple
had this sacred name (...) or (...) engraven on it as chap. 9.. 2. Yea the very
name (...) Temple, owes its derivation to this sacred name Jah or Hje, as chap.
9.. 1. Thus we see how accurate Satan was in parallelizing the Names,
Attributes, and Worship of the true God.

. 3. But to give the true historick Genealogy or Theogonie of Apollo; some
make him to be the same with Joshua; others take him to be Phut the son of
Cham: we shall take in both, because (as it has been once and again observed by
us) the Greek Mythologists did, according to their differing Interests, Humors,
Inclinations, and Fantasies, ascribe different Traditions, and Fables to the
same persons; or one and the same Tradition and Fable to different persons. We
shall begin with such as refer the Theogonie of Apollo to Joshua. Thus
Sandford, de descensu Christi lib. 1.. 21. and Dickinson, Delphi Phoeniciz.
cap. 3. The Parallel betwixt Apollo and Joshua consists of these particulars.
The parallel betwixt Apollo and Joshua, 1. in Names.
1. They agree in Names. 1. Ieios, the same with Jesus, or Joshua.
(1) Apollo was called (...), either (...), from his skill to heal; or (...),
from his casting darts. If we consider this name Ieios, as to its first
Etymology, viz. from healing; so it answers to the Hebr. (...) Jehoscua, or
Joshua, and the Greek (...) Jesus, a Savior or Healer; which Joshua indeed was
to the Israelites, and so a Type of Christ. Hence also, in imitation of Joshua,
Apollo was styled (...), the expeller of evil. If we derive Ieios, Apollo's
name, from (...), to cast darts, this also refers to Joshuah's victory over
the Cananites, as anon. 2. Paean, or Paeon, and Iepaeeon the fame with Joshua.
2. Apollo is styled also (...), or (...), and (...). So Apollonius de
Argonautis sings: (...)
(...)
(...)
On which place the Scholiast, thus: (...). Apollo is called Iepaieon, either
for his casting darts, or because he is the God that causes health. If we
derive Apollo's name, Iepaieon, from casting darts, so it is the same with
(...), shoot Child. Thus Apollo is often introduced by the Poets, as casting
darts, and that (as Sandford) in imitation of Joshua, and the Israelites under
his conduct; who being terrified at the sight of the Giants, durst not approach
near, but assaulted them by darts, at a distance. Ab eo quod praelium contra
Bazanitas gestum sit Ekebolois, ut narrat Josephus, Apollo passim apud Poetas
sagittas jaciens introducitur. Sandf. desc. l. 1.. 21.
If we draw this name Iepaeeon, or Paeon, from Apollo's skill in Medicine, then
it comes from (...), which among the Ancients was of the same import with (...)
to heal. Paio antiquis therapeuo fuit. Sandf.
Thence Lucian de podag. (...), Paean is, of all the Gods in Heaven, the
Physician. 3. Apollo suits with Joshua.
(3.) Yea the very name Apollo, though, as to its formal notion, it be
diametrically opposite to that of Joshua, yet it may conduce to make up the
parallel betwixt these two. Qui res gestas a Joshua spectabant, and ante oculos
habebant legem praeceptumque Dei, quibus obstrictus Joshua, Cananaeos omnes
funditus evertere aut fugare tenebatur; illi, inquam, Josuam non inepte
Apollinem vocabant. Dickins. Delphi Phaeniciz. c. 3.
For albeit Joshua signifies (both name and thing) a Savior, and Apollo a
Destroyer; yet may the later Title, on different respects, well agree with the
former: for as Joshua was the great Savior of the Israelites, so was he in like
manner the great Destroyer of the Cananites. Thus Sandford, desc. l. 1.. 21.
Joshua, with the Hebrews, signifies a Savior: -- (but) from this that the
Cananean nation was destroyed by Joshua, the Poets name him Apollo, (...). To
which accords the Historian ( Diodor: Siculus l. 1.) who says, that by the
wars of the Gods, the progeny of the Giants grew wholly extinct.

Python, Og.
2 As Apollo may be very far parallelized with Joshua in Names, so also in
Things, or Exploits done. Postqnam Joshua Amorrhaeos and Ogum expugnasset, vero
plusqua^ simile est eum proximo subinde Sabbatho gratias Deo maximas et
solennes egisse; ac epinicialibus hymnis suam populique Israelitici victoriam
celebrasse. Graeci igitur (qui rem omnem a Phaenicibus una ac Hebraeis
sciebant) Judaeorum Sabbatum, in quo primum facta erat solennis ea ae
religiosissima Victoriae recordatio, spectantes, Apollinem septimo statim die
ab occiso Pythone Festum Pythicum instituisse fabulantur. Dickinson, Delph.
Phoenic. c. 8.
1. Apollo was very famous for his destroying Python; whence on the seventh day
from the destruction of Python, they suppose that Apollo instituted the Pythick
feast or Holy days, in commemoration of his victory over Python. So the
Scholiast in Pindar. prolegom. ad Pythia: (...), when Apollo had destroyed the
serpent Python, the seventh day after he instituted the Pythick Game. This
seems exactly to answer to Joshua's destroying of Og, Number. 21.34,35. compared
with Deuteronomy. 3.11.13. So Sandford, descens. l. 1.. 21. Lastly Apollo is for
nothing more famous, than for his destroying Python. Homer also does greatly
celebrate him for the destroying Typhon. What means this? Why truly, that
Python and Typhon are the same, and that by a manifest Anagramme, as by evident
relation Typhon is Og. Thus also Dickinson, Delphi Phoenic: cap. 1. Its
necessary that we show, how Python and Typhon are one. And first of all we
shall, by the artifice of Anagrammatisme, unite these, which a Transposition of
the letters have made two. Hence therefore, peradventure, (...) and (...) (for
in the letter (...) lies hid (...)) being transposed, (...) became (...).
Typhon and Python have truly Letters, at least in power (which is enough for
Anagrammatisme) the same. But not to build only on these Grammatick
punctilio's, lo the consent of the most ancient Poet Homer, (hymn. in Apol.)
who sings openly, that Typhon was destroyed by Apollo, whom the Sun, upon
Apollo's prayer, turned into putrefaction; and from thence, says he, (...) or
(...) was called (...), and Apollo (...). (...) etc.
That Typhon is Og, see more what follows chapter 5.. 3. of Hercules. Ad haec, quia
S. Scripturae frequenter assolent impios and populi Dei hosts (quales erant
Ogus, and reliqui Cananaei,) draco. number serpentum. que nominibus infamare;
proinde etiam Typhonem modo serpentem modo draconem vocarunt. Strabo l. 16.
Quoniam vero serpens vel aspis Hebr. (...) Pechen dicitur, hinc (...), vocabulo
ad Hebraicam vocem ficto, postea (...) appellari coepit. Dickins. Phaen. c. 1.
2. Apollo is said to destroy Serpents etc. which is referred to Joshua, and
the Israelites destroying the Cananites, who are compared to Dragons and
Serpents, Psalm. 74.13,14. Thou brakest the heads of the Dragons etc. So
Sandford descens. l 1.. 20. They referred to Joshua, under the masque of
Apollo, the destruction of the Cananites, as set forth under the name of
Dragons, by the Prophets, who in some places assimilate the enemies of God's
people unto Dragons and Serpents. And because a Serpent or Aspe is in Hebrew
called (...) Pethen, hence some conceive Og, the Cananean Serpent, which
Joshua, under the fable of Apollo, destroyed, was called Python, etc. Amorrhaei
quondam Josuae atque Israelitis per gentem suam transituris ad Sciluntem (ubi
Dei Arcam divinumque Oraculum fixuri erant) via interdicebant; celeberrimus
autem Rex Amorrhitarum fuit Ogus; adeoque pro more quicquid ab aliis insigniter
gestum sit, in eum Poetae deferunt: narrant itaque Pythonem obstitisse
Apollini, quo minus ad Delphos accederet, Oraculique praefecturam mancisci
posset. Dickins. Delphi Phaen. c. 2.
So again Sandford, descens. l. 1.. 21. From this, that the Amorites are said
to hinder the Israelites in their passage to Canaan, where they were to fix
the sacred Tabernacle, and Ark of God, and Divine Oracle; those Dragons and
Serpents, against which the Poets feign that Apollo fought, are said to oppose
themselves against his instituting his Oracle.

(3) Joshua, with the Israelites, upon the destruction of their Enemies the
Cananites, sung solemn Hymns to God, in commemoration of their Victories:
Whence those solemn Hymns, (...), and (...), which they sung to Apollo in
commemoration of his victory over Typhon, or Python. Ie, is the same with
(...) Iah, God's name; and Eleleu Ie with (...) Halelujah, (as before. 2.) Jul:
Scalig poet. l. 1. c. 44. tells us, that the Paeans were Hymns, wherein they
gratulated the immortal Gods for victory. And Dickinson, Delphi Phaeniciz cap.
6. gives us a good account of the original of these Pythian Paeans. It remains,
says he, that I clearly show, both how (the Paean) the first and chiefest
contest in the Pythian Games, as also that famous Brabium, which was wont to be
conferred on the Victor, drew their origin from the History of Joshua. Which,
when I have performed it, will give us a most certain Demonstration, that the
Grecians drew the famous occasion of their Pythick solemnity, as also the
chiefest materials of that Pomp, from the Phenicians, or sacred scriptures,
etc. (...). Plutarch. in Theseo. (...) Hallelu. Jehovah, inde (...). Dickins.
Delph. c. 6.
Hence he proceeds to show how the Grecians, in imitation of the sacred Hymn
(...) Hallelujah, began and concluded their Paean with (...) Eleleu Ie, and
then he concludes: And because they began their (...) Paean with Eleleu Ie or
Eleleu Iou, and so distinguished it hereby from other Hymns, hence I presume,
Apollo was called (...) Eleleus, and (...) Ieios. The Grecians therefore, as
out of the Hebrews exploits (under Joshua) they coined their victorious God
Apollo; so also out of their Hymns they framed their (...), etc. The like
account of this Paean, and its Traduction from the sacred Hymn Hallelujah, I
find in Sandford, de descensu Christi l. 1.. 5. as hereafter book 3. chapter 1..
11. who indeed laid the main foundation of, yea gave the greatest advance to
this (as to others) parallel betwixt Apollo and Joshua.

Apollos parallel with Phut the son of Ham.
Albeit there are such evident notices, that the fabulous Grecians borrowed
much of their pompous attire, wherewith they adorned their victorious Apollo,
from the wardrobe of Joshua, his noble exploits and victories over Og, with the
rest of the Cananean Giants; yet we may not exclude the parallel betwixt Apollo
and Phut the son of Ham, as it is given us by Bochart, Phaleg lib. 1. cap. 2.
In the family of Ham or Jupiter Hammon, Put is the Pythian Apollo, who that he
lived in Africa, we are taught by the History of the slain Dragon: seeing
there is scarce any where found Dragons of so great a magnitude as in Africa,
or India then unknown Moreover there are of the Ancients, who write, that
Apollo was a Lybian, and the son of this Hammon. Thus Bochart; whose parallel
betwixt Apollo and Phut, may have its place as well as the former betwixt
Apollo and Joshua: for its to me most evident, that the ancient Mythologists
were no way uniforme in the application of those fabulous Traditions they
gathered up; but some applied this story to that person, another the same
story to another person, as their different humors and affections inclined
them. We may without contradiction to truth suppose, that the fabulous Poets
applied the story of Joshua his victory over Og, etc. unto their famous
Apollo; (as unto Hercules,) but the Historians (who affected truth more than
delight) referred their Apollo to Phut the son of Ham, who passed for Jupiter
Hammon.

. 4. Another supposed son of Jupiter Hammon was Mercury, whose Genealogy,
Names, and Attributes were all (as it seems probable) of Phenician and Hebrew
origination.

Mercuries parallel with Canaan.
1. Mercury, as to his Genealogy, was said to be the son of Jupiter Hammon;
which makes him to be the same with Canaan, the son of Cham, Genesis 10.6: for
Jupiter Hammon was the same with Cham, as before. So Bochart Phaleg. lib. 1.
cap. 2. finds Canaan the son of Cham to be the same with Mercury the son of
Jupiter, etc. Mercurii nomen a (...) vendidit. Glass. Gram. 5. l. 4. Tract. 3.
2. Thence Mercury is derived, by the Learned, from (...) Macar, to
merchandise or sell; which exactly answers to the Hebrew (...) Canaan, which
signifies a Merchant; for such, Canaan and his posterity, who settled in
Phenicia and Canaan, were. 3. Hence also Mercury was made to be the God of
Trade and Merchandise; as likewise famous for Theeverie: all which alludes to
the great trading, merchandising, piracies, and craft of Canaans posterity,
the Phenicians. 4. Mercury is painted with wings; which some refer to the
ships of the Phenicians. 5. Mercury is brought in as always employed in
servile messages; which is supposed to be an allusion to the curse of Canaan,
Genesis 9.25.
Genesis 9.25. Cursed be Canaan a servant of servants. 6. Mercury passes among
the Grecians for the God of Eloquence; because the Phenicians, Canaans
posterity, were supposed to be the Inventors, though they were indeed only,
the Conveyers, of Letters into Greece. Thus Bochart, Phaleg lib. 1. cap. 2. The
name of Canaan (says he) is preserved in Mercury; for both are so styled from
Merchandise and mercature. And Mercury was a servant, as Canaan; and the
father of Eloquence, because Letters came from the Phenicians.

Mercury called Taautas, and Theuth, etc.
Mercuries chief name, amongst the Phenicians, was Taautus. So Sanchoniathon,
according to Philo Byblius's Version, (...) etc. From Misor sprang Taautus,
whom the Egyptians call (...) Thout, and the Alexandrines (...) Thouth, and the
Greeks (...) Mercury etc. Joseph the Egyptian Mercury.
This Theuth or Mercury the Egyptians make to be the first Inventor of
Sciences, as also the Gods Interpreter: whence he was called by the Greeks
(...) the Interpreter; which Bochart refers to Joseph, who was the Egyptian
Mercury, as Canaan the Phenician. Plato, in his Philaebus, styles this
Egyptian Theuth, (...) God; and (...) a Divine man, or Damon: for so the
Egyptians esteemed Joseph. Again Plato, in his Phaedrus, terms him (...), the
father of learning, with whom Thamus King of Egypt had many conferences,
touching the use of Letters, which is applicable to none more truly than to
Joseph. Cicero also makes mention of him under the appellation of Thoyth and
Theuth. This Egyptian Theuth was called also Thot, whence Vossius derives our
English God. This Phenician Taautus, and Egyptian Theuth the old Gauls styled
Teutates. So Lucan to Taramis Jupiter joins Teutates; whom Livie lib. 26.
interprets Mercury. Whence Bochart proves, that Teutates amongst the Gauls,
was the same with the Phenician (...), and the Egyptian Theuth or Thouth. The
same Theuth or Mercury was called by the old Germans Teuto; whence the Germans
themselves were styled Teutones, and their Tongue lingua Teutonica. So Bochart
Can. lib. 1. cap. 42. speaking of the Germans, says out of Tacitus, The German
Teuto or Tuito.
That they celebrate Tuito their God, produced out of the Earth, and Manus his
son, as the first founders of their Nation etc. where he proves, that both came
from the Egyptians, who worshipped for their chief Gods Theuth, or Mercury, the
Inventor of Sciences, as also Menas or Menes, the first of men, which is
supposed to have reigned in Egypt. So Herodot. lib. 2. (...), 'They say that
Menes was the first of men that reigned in Egypt. so Diodorus Siculus lib. 1.
And as the German Tuito or Teuto came from the Egyptian Theuth, so also the
German Man, or Men from the Egyptian Menas. Whence the names German, Aleman,
Norman, and our English Man, as Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 42. fol. 751. Another
name given to Mercury is Monimus; which seems also of Phenician origination.
So Julian the Apostat, in his oration of the Sun, tells us, that those who
inhabit Edessa, a place sacred to the Sun, make Monimus and Azizus his
Assessors. Which Jamblichus thus interprets: (...). As Monimus must be
Mercury, so Azizus Mars. So Vossius de Idololat. lib. 2. cap. 5. page 332.
Bochart Can. lib. 2. cap. 8 Casmilus.
Mercury as reckoned up amongst the Cabiri, or Samothracian Gods, is called
Casmilus. So the Scholiast on Apollonius Argonaut. 1. (...), Casmilus is
Mercury. This Casmilus, who is made not one of the supreme Gods, but a
minister to the other Cabiri, or great Gods, Bochart ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 12.)
makes to be the same with the Phenician, or Hebrew (...) Chadmel, i.e. a
minister of God, which was Mercurie's name, and office, of which hereafter. By
all this laid together, it seems very probable, that the chief Names,
Genealogies, and Attributes given unto Mercury, were of Egyptian, Phenician,
or Hebrew original. Lastly, whereas there is mention made in Sanchoniathon of
Taautus or Mercury his giving unto Saturn, as Ensigns of his Kingdom, four
eyes, whereof two were open, and two shut; because Saturn (...), sleeping did
see, and watching did sleep: This Bochart ( Can. lib. 2. cap. 2. fol. 789.)
refers to Balaam, Numb. 24.4.
Number. 24.24. falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: or to to the
Spouse, Cant. 5.2. I sleep, but etc. More concerning the Egyptian Theuth or
Mercury, and his Identitie with Joseph see in that follows of Egyptian
Philosophy. part. 2.

. 5. Pluto's Theogonie and parallel with Shem.
Having discoursed at large of Jupiter and his posterity, Bacchus, Apollo,
Mercury, with their Theogonie or Genealogy from Cham, Nimrod, Phut, and
Canaan; we now proceed to Pluto, another son of Saturn, with endeavors to
demonstrate his identitie with Shem the son of Noah; yet so, as that many
Attributes belonging to Moses, are given unto him. For, as we have again and
again observed, the Greek Mythologists were no way uniforme in the application
of their fables; but frequently patched up their Idol-God, by a piece of one,
and a piece of another oriental Tradition: as it will farther appear in these
fables of Pluto; whose Names, Attributes, and Genealogy seem to have a very
great cognation with, yea derivation from sacred Names, and Story.

Pluto's name Muth.
1. Sanchoniathon, according to Philo Byblius's version, brings in Pluto as the
son of Saturn, whom he styles (...) Muth: (...), the Phenicians name him Death
and Pluto; so that he plainly styles Pluto (...) Muth, from the Hebrew (...)
Muth Death. So the Hebrews use Muth for death, Ps. 49.14.
Psalm. 49.14. (...) Death shall feed etc. Now that the Phenicians and
Egyptians, by Muth or Pluto, understood Shem, the son of Noah, (who passed for
Saturn,) is asserted and proved by Bochart, Phaleg. lib. 1. cap. 2. where also
he gives us the reason of this appellation, in these words. Shem being hated by
these Idolaters, and so thrust down to Hell, passes for Pluto: which alludes
to (...), which the Greeks render (...), to darken. Thus also Typhon was called
by the Egyptians (...) Smu, not without manifest allusion to the name of Shem:
By the name Typhon the Egyptians understood all ill. Sanchoniathon's entire
words are these: (...): Not long after (Saturn) consecrated his other son, by
Rhea, called Muth dead: this the Phenicians name Death and Pluto. Sanchoniathon
acknowledges Pluto to be the son of Saturn, that is Noah. And if any demand
the reason, why he is called Death, Diodorus Siculus lib. 5. of Pluto, gives us
some account thereof: (...) etc. Pluto, Hades:
They report that Pluto was the first that discovered the Rites of Funerals,
and Sepulture, and honors due to the dead; the former Age having no regard
hereof: wherefore this God is said to have power over the dead: and anciently
the principality and care of the dead was ascribed to him. Thus Diodorus
Siculus. Hence a Key was made the Ensign of Pluto; according to that of
Pausanias, Iliac. (...): They say, that Pluto shuts Hades (i.e. the Grave, or
state of the dead) by this Key: answerable to that character of Christ, who is
said to have the key of death and the grave, Rev. 1.18.
Rev. 1.18. (...), the key of Hades. See more Vossius de Idolol. lib. 1. cap.
19. where he makes Saturn the same with Noah, but Pluto the same with Cham.
Proportionable to this Phentcian name (...) Muth, Pluto was styled by the
Grecians (...), Hades. For that Hades, among the Poets, was Pluto, it is evident.
So Sandford de descens. l. 2.. 35. who knows not that Pluto was Hades? yet this
difference I note: Pluto is always a name of the person; but Hades sometimes
also of the thing: whence it is that we read (...); but only (...), not (...).
So also it is said, that Pluto descended (...), unto Hades; not that (...) Hades
descended unto Pluto. So Diodorus Sic: (...). So Apollodorus brings in Pluto
reigning (...). By Hades the ancient Poets understood the Earth: for as they
made the Sun to be Saturn, or Jupiter, and the Moon, Juno; so the Earth Pluto.
Thus Plato Cratyl: (...). Pluto was so styled, because Plutus i.e. riches are
dug out of the Earth: where also he calls Pluto (...) Hades, because he was a
companion of the dead, who are lodged in the Earth or Grave. Whence Homer
feignes (...) Hades to govern the Manes in subterraneous places, that is in
cavernes of the Earth, or graves. This is farther evident from the origination
of (...), which, according to Plato's Canon, must be drawn from the Barbarians
language, i.e. from the Hebr. (...) Earth, as Sandford l. 1.. 26. and l. 2..
35. Hence we learn what is the proper import of (...) in the Scripture; Act.
2.31.
as Act. 2.31. He seeing this before, spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that
his soul was not left in Hell. (...), in the grave, or rather, in the state of
the dead. For (...) (the very name which the Poets gave to Pluto, feigned to be
the God of the dead as before) in its primarie notion signifies the state of
the dead: and because the dead are usually lodged in Graves, therefore the same
word is also used to signify the Grave, proportionable to (...) Seol, Psalm.
16.10. unto which (...) Hades here (Act. 2.31.) refers. Ps. 16.10.
That (...) Psalm. 16.10. signifies not properly Hell, but the state of the
dead, or Grave, is evident from the like import of the word elsewhere, Ps.
18.5.
as Psalm. 18.5. (...) which we render (but ill) the sorrows of Hell: Whereas
this phrase signifies properly the cords, i.e. Sorrows of death; so it is
explicated by the following phrase (...) the snares of death; as also by what
precedes v. 4. (...) the Cords or sorrows of death; which is evidently the same
with (...) the cords or dolors of death. Yea we find these two (...) and (...)
joined together and the later exegetick of the former Psalm. 116.3. Ps. 116.3.
(...) the cords or dolors of Death, and the pains of Seol: where Seol, which
answers to Hades, is made exegetick of Maveth, or Muth, death, which was also
Pluto's name. Ps. 86.13.
So Psalm. 86.13. what we translate the lowest hell, is in the Hebr. (...) etc.
from Seol, the grave, or state of the dead beneath. By all which it appears,
that (...) Act. 2.31.
Act. 2.31. and elsewhere, Ps. 16.10.
as (...) Psalm. 16.10. (which answers thereto) signify not properly Hell, but
the state of the dead, or grave. And Bochart was so confident hereof, as that
he stuck not to affirm, that (...) is seldom, if ever, used in the New
Testament in any other notton or sense. This also I find in his learned and
acute conference with (as also against) Veron, the Papist, page 951. The
Descent (says Bochart) of Jesus Christ to Hell, is nothing else but his abode
in the state of the dead, after his death and sepulture, unto his Resurrection.
So Romans 10.7. Romans 10.7.
to bring up Christ from the dead. The same Bochart explains more fully page
952. and S. Peter Act. 2.24.27.30.31. shows, that this prophecy of Psalm.
16.10. thou will not leave my soul in hell, could not agree to David, because
he yet continued in the state of the Dead; but well to our Lord Jesus Christ,
whom God had raised up; having untied the cords, or dissolved the dolors of
Death, Hebr. (...) i.e. those bonds of Death and Hell were dissolved or untied
by his Resurrection: so this word Seol must be taken, Psalm. 49.14. they are put
into Seol as sheep etc, i.e. simply into the condition of the dead; for there
is no other Seol for sheep. Briefly, to show that Hades signifies not always
the place of the damned, there is made an express distinction betwixt the one
and the other, Apoc. 20.14. where Hades (which is rendered Hell) is said to be
cast into the lake of fire, ( i.e. local or real Hell.) Thus Bochart, who here
acutely demonstrates the distinction betwixt Hades, and the real Hell, as also
its identitie with Death, or the state of the dead; whereof Pluto was by the
Poets made the God, and thence styled Hades. Of which see Sandford descens.
Christi lib. 1.. 26. and l. 2.. 35. etc. more largely.

Axiokersos
3. Answerable to these names (...) Muth and (...) Hades Pluto is styled in the
Samothracian mysteries of the Cabiri, (which had their Original from the
Phenician Cabiri, of which hereafter) (...) Axiokersos; which is the same with
the Phenician or Hebrew (...) Achazi Keres i.e. Death is my Possession for
(...) Achazi, which the Samothracians read (...) Axio, signifies my possession:
and (...) Keres, amongst the Greeks (...), is used for Destruction or Death as
Jer. 46.20. Jer. 46.20.
Hence (...) Achazi Keres death is my possession, strength or power: which is a
Character given, by the Hebrews, unto the Devil: Heb. 2.14. Bochart.
Thus the Author to the Hebrews styles him Heb. 2.14. that through death he
might destroy him that had the Power of death, i.e. the Devil. Where, according
to the Hebrew Idiom, he styles the Devil him that had the power of death, i.e.
(...) Achazi Keres, or, according to the Greek (...) the Lord of destruction
which was Pluto's name, amongst the Samothracian Cabiri. The Scholiast on
Apollonius Argonaut 1. tells us: (...). Axio Kersos is Hades, i.e. death etc. as
Vossius Idolo. lib. 2. cap. 57. page 620.

Typhon.
4. As Pluto was termed by the Phenicians (...) death; and by the Samothracians
(...), so also by the Egyptians Typhon; whom they supposed to be a Monstrous
Giant cast down by Jupiter into Tartar, as an enemy of the Gods: that is, in
plain language, the Evil God or Devil cast down to Hell. That Typhon amongst
the Egyptians was the same with Pluto amongst the Grecians, and both originally
the same with Shem, is evident from what was before mentioned out of Bochart;
namely, "That Typhon was called by the Egyptians (...) Smu, which (says he)
refers to Shem. But more of this in the following Section.

. 6. Enceladus the same with the Devil Esa 27.1.
To the Fable of Pluto, the God of Hell, we may subjoin that of the Giant
Enceladus, who was very near akin unto, if not the same with, Pluto. The
Mythologists fable, that this Enceladus was (...), a Giant that fought against
the Gods; who therefore was either by Minerva, or Jupiter himself, cast down to
Hell; and there overwhelmed with that very great mountain Aetna: whence, say
they, proceeded fire out of his mouth and nostrils; which some refer to the
burnings of Aetna etc. That this fable was brought into Greece, by the
Phenicians, originally from the the Jewish Church, seems evident (as Bochart
Canaan. lib. 1. cap. 28. fol. 581.
has well observed) from many considerations. 1. The very name (...) Enceladus,
is, by Bochart, made to be the same with the Hebrew (...) akalathon, i.e.
tortuous or crooked: which is the very Epithet given to the Devil Esa 27.1.
Leviathan that crooked serpent (...) Nahas akalaton. The transmutation of the
Hebrew (...) into the Greek. (...) seems natural and easy: which is soon done,
by the change only of (...) into (...), and (...) into (...); as in (...)
crooked, from (...) akul.

Typhon his Origi^.
2. That Enceladus is exactly parallel to the Devil his character Esa 27.1.
etc. is evident from his other name Typhon, or Typhos; who is thus described,
by Pindar, Pythia 1 (...). There lies in Tartar that hundred headed Typhos the
enemy of the Gods. So Apollidorus lib. 1. There appeared the hundred headed
Dragon, Typhon, etc. The like Hyginus, cap. 152. Tartar procreated out of the
Earth Typhon, of huge magnitude, of a monstrous form, with an hundred Dragon
heads. Which being laid together, Bochart (Can. lib. 1. cap. 28. fol. 581.)
thus explicates to us: If we will look (says he) to the reason of the
Allegory, there is no doubt, but this Giant Enceladus, (or Typhon) whom
Jupiter by a Thunderbolt struck down to Tartar, (because he made an
insurrection against the Gods,) and kept in those Abysses of the Earth, there
to burn in everlasting flames, is the same with that Akalathon, or crooked
Serpent the Devil, which God Esa. 27.1. smote with his sword, and 2 Pet. 2.4.
(...) but cast them down to Hell etc. And that these Grecian Fables of Typhon,
had their original from the Hebrews, appears

1. Typhon from Tophet, the same with the Devil.
First from the very name Typhon, which Bochart fetches from the Hebrew (...)
Tophet; whence the Greek (...), which signifies the same with (...) to burn:
Thence Esa. 30.33. (...) Tophet is the same with that place in the valley of
Hinnom, where they sacrificed their children to Moloch, by casting them alive
into the fire, Esa. 30.33. 2 King. 23.10 Jer. 7.31,32.
as 2 King. 23.10. Jer. 7.31,32. This valley of Hinnom, wherein Tophet stood,
by reason of those barbarous cruel flames became a symbol or type of Hell;
whence from (...) Gehinnom, the Greeks termed Hell fire (...) Gehenna. Hence
also Tophet, the place in this valley of Hinnom, where this fire burned, gave
original to Typhon.

2 The Attributes given to Typhon prove him to be the same with the Devil,
according to that character given him in Scripture. For 1. it is said, that
Typhon waged war with Jupiter, and contended with him for the Empire; whence he
was struck down by Jupiter into Tartar etc. So the Scripture assures us
touching the Devil, that for his sin against God, he was cast down to Hell. 2.
It Is said, that when Jupiter had, by a fiery Thunderbolt, struck down Typhon, he
laid upon him the mountain Aetna in Sicilie, which was by him set on fire:
whence all mountains, that had any eruptions of fire, were fabled to lie upon
Typhon: which answers to the Devils character 2 Pet. 2.4. 2 Pet. 2.4.
cast them down to hell.

3. And because the Egyptians looked on Typhon as an evil God, or the cause of
all ill, Typhons parallel with Moses.
therefore they take the stories of the Patriarchs, especially such as most
infested them by opposing their Idolatry, and attribute them unto him. We have
already mentioned the story of Shem, who being always hated by the posterity
of Cham, (amongst whom the Egyptians were) passed among them for Pluto and
Typhon. We shall now endeavor to show, how the Egyptians, out of their cursed
humor, applied the whole story of Moses unto Typhon. Learned Bochart (in a
conference with him) informed me at large out of Plutarch and others, touching
the parallel betwixt Typhon and Moses. Plutarch (said he) in his Isis and
Osiris, tells us, 1. that Typhon made war with the Gods, i.e. with the Egyptian
Idols: so Moses Exodus 8. etc. 2. Typhon was the son of a Queen: so Moses the
adopted son of Pharaohs daughter. 3. Typhon was hid in an Ark, and cast on the
river Tanais: so Moses, Exodus 2.3. 4. Typhon had command of all the beasts: so
Moses of the Frogs etc. Exodus 8.5. etc. 5. Typhon is said to divide his Army
into 13. parts: so Moses the Israelites into 13 ( i.e. reckoning the two sons
of Joseph as distinct) Tribes. These, with some other instances were given me
by Bochart, touching the parallel betwixt Typhon and Moses: and I find some
mention of the same in his History de Animalibus sacris part. 1. lib. 2. cap.
34. Illustres illae Mosis victoriae adhuc recenti memoria celebres, magis
innotuisse putandae sunt. Sandf. l. 1.. 22.
That which gave occasion to the Egyptians and Greeks to insert so many parcels
of Moses's story into their Mythologie of Typhon, was the freshnes and
novaltie of Moses's Achievements, who lived much about the same time, when
this Fable-coining Art began: as before, in Bacchus's genealogy. Typhons
parallel with Og.
Sandford, Vossius, and Dickinson make Typhon, by the art of Anagrammatisme,
the same with Python, the Serpent Apollo destroyed; which they take to be a
fable of Og, the Giant of Basan, destroyed by Joshuah, as before. 3. and in
what follows chap 5.. 3. We may take in both one and the other of these
References; because the Mythologists agreed not in the application of their
Fables.

3. Another name given to Enceladus, which argues his genealogy to be the same
with the Devils, was Briareus. This name Bochart ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 28.) makes
to be the same with (...) Belial, the name given, by the Hebrews, to the Devil.
Thence for (...), 2 Cor. 6.15. the Syriack has (...), as also the Arabic. So
in Hesychius (...) is (...), etc.

CHAP. V. The Theogonie of Hercules and Mars of Hebraick Derivation.
Hercules's origination Phenician or Hebraick. (...) from the Chaldee (...)
Hera, a Princess. (...), q. (...) the glory of Juno, or the great Hero:
whence he was called also by the Phenicians Melcarthus, the King of the City.
Hercules's Temple in the straits, of Phenician origin; as it appears by the
Rarities therein: Hercules called Ogmius, either from Og King of Basan, or from
(...) Agemi, strangers. Hercules's character by Lucian: his expedition into
Spain, and Gallia. The Phenician Hercules the same with Joshua: which is proved
1. from the place of their Expedition; which was Arabia, called by the
Grecians, India. 2. From the Identitie of the persons they fought against. The
Giants were the Cananites, and Typho^ was Og of Basan. 3. From their mode of
fighting. 4. From the place where the battle was fought. Nyssa the same with
Syna, or Nissi, Exodus 17.15. 5. From Typhon's Bed; which is the same with that
of Og, Deuteronomy. 3.11. 6. From Hercules's name Melicarthus; which is proper to
Joshua, as also to Mars. (...) the same with Mars and Joshua. The Phenician
Hercules contemporary with Joshua. The Theogonie of Mars, and his parallel with
Joshua, as also with Nimrod.

1. Hercules origination Hebraick.
HAving gone through the Genealogy of Saturn, Jupiter, Juno, Bacchus, etc.
Apollo, with the several Attributes given to them, we now proceed to Hercules;
whose name is by Fuller lib. 2. miscel. S. cap. 7. derived from the Phenician
or Hebrew (...) beholding all things: whence he makes Hercules to be the Sun,
and so the same with Baal. Others, supposing Hercules to be the son of Juno,
draw the origination of his name also from her; according to that of the
Etymologist, (...), Hercules, is so called, because he was the glory of Juno.
Though I cannot mislike this Etymon, yet I shall reduce it originally to a
Phenician or Hebrew extract; making the Greek (...) the same with the Chaldee
(...) Hera, or (...) Herin, as Esa. 34.12. whence the Greek (...), and the
Latin Heroes received their derivation. The Hebrew (...), which the Chaldees
read (...) and (...), and the Syrians (...), coming from (...) albuit,
signifies albatos; thence principes, primates, and Heroes, because such usually
wore white garments. So Eccles. 10.17. (...), also Jer. 27.19. (...) Princes:
and Jer. 39.6. (...) from (...), the faem. (...) white: so Schindler. So that
according to this Phenician or Chaldee origination, Hercules signifies the
great Hero, or Prince. This also suits with Hercules's Phenician name
Melicarthus, mentioned by Phylo Byblius out of Sanchoniathon, Eusebius. praepar.
lib. 1. (...), Of Demaruntes is begotten Melcarthus; who also is Hercules.
Melcarthus, in the Phenician tongue, is Melec Kartha (...) the King of the
City, i.e. (says Bochart) of Tire. Thence also the Amathusians called
Hercules (...), i.e. King; as Hesychius: and others (...), which answers to
(...), i.e Hero, or Prince, etc. Hercules's Temple at his pillars, of Phenician
origin.
Farther, that Hercules, both name and person, was originally, not of Greek,
but of Phenician extract, is evident by the Places, Temples, Worship, and Rites
consecrated unto him. To begin with that ancient Temple dedicated to Hercules,
in the place called Hercules's pillars, at the mouth of the Straits. It is
evident, that Hercules was worshipped here after Phenician Rites, as Appianus
in Ibericis: Hercules 's Temple, (says he) which is at the Pillars, seems to
me to have been built by the Phenicians; for he is worshipped to this very day
after a Phenician rite: neither is their God Theban, but Tyrian. Mela would
have this Temple to belong to the Egyptian Hercules, but to be built by the
Tyrians. But Bochart proves, that the Egyptian Hercules was the same with the
Phenician. The Rarities in Hercules Temple.
This Temple, dedicated to Hercules, was very famous for many Rarities, (which
were mostly fabulous) appendent and belonging thereto: as 1. that it was
placed, as they anciently conceited, at the most extreme part of the world;
whence Hercules's pillars had a ne plus ultra attributed to them. 2. This
Temple is conceived to have been most ancient, and to have had its original
structure from the Phenicians, in their first navigations into those parts,
about Moses and Joshuah's time. 3. They say also, that the matter of the Wood
continued after many ages incorrupt. 4. There were various Sculptures, which
added value to that Temple, with many donaries, as the Hydras, Diomedes's
horses, Hercules's 12 labors cut in stone, Pygmalion's golden Olive. 5. They
imagined also, that Hercules himself was hid in that Temple; and that by the
presence of that Deity they were secured from all danger, as Bochart Can. lib.
1. cap. 34 fol. 676.

. 2. Moreover, that Hercules was of Phenician or Hebrew original, will farther
appear by what footsteps we find of him amongst the old Gauls and Britains.
Hercules called amongst the Gauls, Ogmius.
The Gauls termed Hercules, Ogmius: so Lucian in Hercul: (...): the Celti (a
Tribe of the Gauls) call Hercules in their mother tongue, Ogmius. Some deduce
this name Ogmius from Og King of Basan, who was slain by Joshua, the Phenician
Hercules. See more of this. 3.
Thus Dickinson Delphi Phoeniciz: cap. 4. But whence (...)? was it not from Og,
the slain Giant? For as the Grecians called Apollo, from the slain Dolphin,
(...); so, peradventure, Hercules, or Joshua, from slain Og, was called (...)
Ogius: for I suspect that (...) (either from a Celtick or Greek Epenthesis) was
more lately foisted in. For the Grecians often insert (...) in the middle of
words, as Eustathius in Il. 2. But Bochart ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 42. fol. 737.)
makes Ogmius to be a Phenician, or Hebrew appellation, the same with (...)
agemi, i.e. in the Arabic, Barbarians, or strangers; because Hercules coming
from Africa, or the Gades, after many unwearied labors and travels both by Sea
and Land, at last arrived amongst the Gauls. Hercules's character by Lucian.
So much the picture of Hercules, related by Lucian in Hercul. gives us to
understand; where he is described (...) etc. A decrepit old man, bald behind,
with the remainder of his hair white; of a wrinkled skin, and swarthie, just
like old Mariners. More touching this description of Hercules, see in Bochart
Can. lib. 1. cap. 42. fol. 737. and Dickins. Delph. Phoen. c. 4. As for the
way, by which Hercules passed into Gallia, we find good conjectures thereof in
Bochart, Can. lib. 1. cap. 41. Hercules his expedition into Gallia.
The same Hercules (says he) who fixed his foot in Spain, seems also to have
invaded Gallia, not by the Pyrenaean mountains, which was too difficult a task,
but by the Ligustick Sea; by which the Rhodanians first, and after the
Phocaeans, found passage into Gallia. As an instance hereof, take the sharp
battle fought betwixt Hercules and the Ligures, near the mouth of Rhodan;
whereof not only the Poets, but also Historians and Astronomers make mention.
Hercules might also pass from the Gades, through the Ocean, into Gallia. Yea
the same Bochart proves also, that Hercules was in Britannie. So Can. lib. 1.
cap. 39. Pliny lib. 7. c. 56. says, that Midacritus was the first that
brought Led from the Islands Cassiterides. For Midacritus we must read
Melicartus, or Melcarthus, the Phenician Hercules in Sanchoniathon; to whom the
Phenicians referred their Western navigations. For Midacritus is a Greek name:
now the Grecians knew nothing of the Islands Cassiterides, as Herodotus
acknowledges. Who this Phenician Hercules, who visited these Western parts,
was, and in what Age he lived, is disputed by the Learned. Bochart in Phaleg
lib. 3. cap. 7. tells us, that the Phenicians are thought to have sailed into
Spain, and even unto Gades, under Hercules the Tyrian commander; whom some make
synchronous to Moses: but I am deceived, if this expedition were not in that
Age, wherein the Jews, being masters of Canaan, forced the ancient inhabitants
to wander elsewhere: so that as one part of them passed into Boeotia under
Cadmus, so another into Africa and Spain, under Hercules. This is manifest by
the two Tingitane ( called Hercules 's) pillars, which were to be seen with a
Phenician inscription; which taught, that those pillars were erected, by those
who fled from the face of Joshua, the son of Nave, the Robber, etc. Eusebius,
in his Chronicon ad numerum 498. tells us, that (...). Hercules, surnamed
Diodas, was said to be in Phenicia about this time. If so, he must then be
contemporarie with Moses: for the year 498. falls in with the 73 year of Moses,
as Bochart Can. praef. fol. 3.

. 3. Hercules his parallel with Joshua.
As for the many Fables touching Hercules his unwearied labors, and warlick
achievements, some conceive them to be traduced from Esau; but others, on more
probable conjectures, from Joshua his victorious exploits, etc. Thus Sandford
de descensu Christi l. 1.. 20. Some one perhaps will wonder, seeing things are
thus, how it comes to pass, that Joshua found no favor among the Poets, who
seem to be silent concerning him. But truly it proves quite otherwise: for they
mention more of him than of any other, except Moses: so that who their true
Hercules was, who also their true Apollo was, will easily appear, when the true
account of all those things, which they so much sing of the Giants wars, is
brought to light. For its manifest, that the Poets drunk in almost all this
whole History from the Hebrew monuments; and that the war undertaken (by
Joshua) against the Cananites, was the fountain, whence Greece sucked in the
most of those things they fable of their Giants, overcome by the Gods. The
Fables agree, that the Gods, which engaged against the Giants, i.e. Cananites,
came up out of Egypt, and that they were twelve Tribes; also that they
constituted Bacchus, i.e. Moses, commander in chief of the whole Army: but
because the main conduct and stresse of the war (after Moses's death) was
incumbent on Joshua, therefore they attribute the chief management of the war
unto him, under the disguise of Hercules, etc. Hercules the same with Joshua,
as it is proved by many particulars.
So Vossius de Idololat. lib. 1. cap. 26. where he gives us a lively parallel
betwixt Hercules and Joshua, in these particulars. 1. The place of their
expedition the same, viz. Arabia.
1. Whereas it is said that Hercules, as well as Bacchus, made an Expedition into
India, hereby he proves must be meant Arabia: for the Greeks esteemed all
countries beyond the mid-land Sea, as parts of India. His own words are these.
For the expedition both of Liber and Hercules was undertaken in Arabia; which
cannot be denied, when we have proved, that Liber was Moses, and Hercules
Ioshuah etc. Thus also Sandford de descensu Christi l. 1.. 20. That under
Hercules must be understood Joshua, firstly appears, by commemoraring that
(which is the head of this affair) the Egyptian Hercules and Dionysus, by
common counsel and consent, engaged against the Indians. That these Indians
were the Cananites, we have already shown. That this Dionysus was Moses, I hope
none can further doubt. Must not this Hercules then be Joshua? truly the time
exactly accords, according to Austin, who assigns to Hercules and Bacchus,
their times betwixt the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt, and the death
of Joshua, etc. 2. The persons the same, namely Hercules was Joshua, and Typhon
Og.
2. As for the persons which engaged in this Expedition, Apollodorus biblioth.
1o. relates, that on the one side there were engaged Typhaeus, with the rest of
the Giants; and on the other part, Jupiter, with Hercules, and the rest of the
Gods. This oriental Hercules (says Vossius) for some Ages, more ancient than
the Theban, was by his true name called Joshua, who made war with the
Cananites; amongst whom were the sons of Anak, and other Giants, as Numb.
13.29,34. But more particularly, the land of Basan was called the land of the
Giants, Deuteronomy. 3.13.
as Deuteronomy. 3.13. amongst whom Og was King, as v. 11. Now this Og is called by
the Grecians, (...), or (...); which words being derived from (...), to kindle
or burn, have the same import with Og; which comes from (...) i.e. burnt. So
that Typho is the same with Og. Thus Vossius. Quid enim Hog Hebraeis
significat? ustulatum scilicet: and quid Typhaeus Graecis, annon pariter ac
penitus idem? Tuphein enim Hesychio est choris phlogos Kapnon aneinai; item
phlegesthai, kaiesihai. At vero Poetae Typhaeum, nomine ardentem cum primum
repraesentassent: nihil illis deinde in promptu magis, (nomini omen ut
responderet) quam eum etiam introducere ardentem corpore and percussum fulminc,
ex acie denique fugientem. Sandford de descensu Christi l. 1.. 20.
The same is mentioned by Sandford, (from whom Vossius seems to have borrowed
this, as many other of his choicer notions) de descensu Christi l. 1.. 20. We
see that the war of Hercules against the Giants, and that of Joshua against the
Cananites, exactly agree both in time, and place, and mode of fighting. Let us
now consider the enemies, whereof Typhoeus was the prince; who, that he was the
same with Og of Basan, I am convinced by many indubitable arguments; the chief
whereof is taken from his bed. For Homer ( Iliad. ^.) tells us, that the chief
of the Giants had his Bed (...) in Arimis: which exactly answers to that of the
sacred Scripture, Deuteronomy. 3.11. For only Og King of Basan remained of the
remnant of the Giants; behold his Bedsted was a Bedsted of Iron: is it not in
Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four
cubits the breadth of it, etc.

It Is possible, that Hercules, from this name Og, was by the Phenicians first,
and then by the old Gauls styled Ogmius; as Lucian in Hercul. The Celti call
Hercules Ogmius, as before.. 1. 3. Their mode of fighting the same, as Jos.
10.11.
3. Hercules seems parallel with Joshua in the mode of fighting, and victory.
It Is said of Hercules, that whilst he was fighting with the Giants; Jupiter
rained down stones, etc. This answers exactly to the story of Joshua his
strenuous achievement, and God's raining down stones, by which he slew a great
part of the Giants, Josh. 10.11. The Lord cast down great stones from heaven
upon them, unto Azekah, and they died, etc. Thus Sandford descensu Christi l.
1.. 20. Nonnisi a Jehoschuba lapidibus e coelo cadentibus adjuto, ortum habere
potuisse de Hercule fabulam, qua is similiter adjutus dicitur a Poetis.
Sandford desc. l. 1.. 20.
whence had Homer the Tradition of this horrible Earthquake, thundering, and
lightning (in the Giants war?) It may be he had it from the thing it self: for
this fight in Basan (mentioned Josh. 10.11.) was of all most formidable, both
by reason of the immense preparation, as also from the horrid Judgment of God,
which in that day he most powerfully showered down on his most fierce
Adversaries: although we want not probability, that the Poets here mixed
stories, which in the sacred Scriptures are distinct, and so drew to this
story ( Josh. 10.11.) like passages; such as we find in David's Psalms, as,
Ps. 77.18. The voice of thy thunder was in Heaven the lightnings lightened the
world, the Earth trembled and shook, etc. Thus likewise Dickinson (who follows
Sandford herein, as in many other like Parallels) Delphi Phoeniciz. cap. 4.
Moreover as Joshua, (Josh. 10.11.) So Hercules also was aided by stones sent
from Heaven: whence, I suppose, he received the name Saxanus; the origination
whereof Lillius Gyraldus, (in Hercule) confesses he was ignorant.

4. In the place of the Battle which was near Nyssa in Arabia.
4. There is also a very great agreement 'twixt Joshua and Hercules as to the
place where this battle was fought. It Is confessed that some make this place,
where Hercules thus contended with the Giants, to be in Narbonne, between
Massilia and the mouth of Rhodan; other in Pallene; others in Arcadia; But
Vossius ( de Idololatr. lib. 1. cap. 26.) gives us a more probable conjecture,
that this place, where Hercules and the Giant Typho fought, was in Arabia near
Nyssa and Serbonis; Hic nobis peropportune succurret Apollonius: Typhaon
fulmine percussus, and ardens, ad Nyssaeos montes venit, ibique videri desiit.
Hoc testimonio confect, res est. Est enim hic Serbonidis lacus in confinio
Aegypti, Nysa autem in Arabia Sandford Descens. l. 1.. 20.
This may be proved out of Apollonius in (...) -- (...)
(...), etc. He (i.e. Typhoeus) came thus to the mountains and Nysseian field;
where also he lies overwhelmed under the water of Serbonis etc. That by Nyssa
here is to be understood a mountain of Arabia, the Scholiast acknowledges:
which mountain Nyssa or Nysa some conceive to be the same with mount Syna,
different only by a transposition of letters: Exodus 17.15.
others take it to be the same with the mount Nysa, sacred to Bacchus or Moses,
who was called (...) the God of Nysa, from Exodus 17.15. Jehovah Nissi, the Lord
is my banner, as before chap. 3.. 5. of Bacchus.

It Is true, some Mythologists place this Nyssa, near which Hercules overcame
the Giant Typhon, in India; but it is evident that the ancient Grecians meant
thereby no other than Arabia; for they styled all the Oriental parts beyond the
midland Sea, by this name of India: as it appears by that of Ovid de Art
amandi. Andromedam Perseus nigris portavit ab Indis.


Whereas Perseus brought not his wife Andromeda from India but from Joppa, a
town of Phoenicia as Strabo l. 1. (...). So Dickins. Delp. c. 4. and Vossius as
before.

As for Serbonis, the other place near which the Giant Typho, was overcome by
Hercules; Ptolemaeus tells us, that Serbonis was betwixt Egypt and Palestine;
and according to Plutarch (in the life of Antonius) the Egyptians call the
Marshes of Serbonis the exspirations of Typho. Quin, and mihi penitissime
persuasum est, fabulam istam de Typhone in lacu serbonidis pridem submerso non
aliunde confictam fuisse quam ex Jobi 26.5. Gigantes ge munt sub aquos.
Dickins. Delph. Phaen. c. 2.
And whereas it is said by Apollonius, that Typhon lies overwhelmed under the
water of Serbonis; this fable some conceive to be drawn from Job 26.5. where
that which is rendered by us: dead things, are formed under the waters, is
translated by others: The Giants groan under the waters. Whence it evidently
appears that Hercules's destruction of Typho near to Nyssa and Serbonis;
relates to the destruction of Og, and the other Cananitish Gians, by Joshua and
the Israelites in their passage to Canaan. 5. The bed of Typho the same with
that of Og Deuteronomy. 3.11.
5. Whereas it is said Deuteronomy. 3.11. that Og king of Basan had a bedsted of iron
etc. a learned man has thought that the memory of this iron bedsted remained
amongst the Gentiles. So Homer Iliad. ^. speaking of Jupiters striking down
this Giant Typho by his thunderbolt, adds (...). In Aromaea, where they say
Typho's bed remains.

This is thus expressed by Virgil, -- Durumque Cubile
Inarimes, Jovis imperiis imposta Typhoeo.
Where, what Homer expresses in two words (...) Virgil, upon a mistake, joins
in one Inarimes, yet so as we may safely conclude he means the same. Sive autem
Typhonis nomen spectes, sive historiam vix, ovum O vo similius invenias, quam
Typhoni Ogum. Dickins. Delph. Phoen. c. 2.
Farther that this (...) Arima, where Homer and Virgil place Typhon's bed, is
the same with Syria is evident from that of Strabo l. 13. (...), by the Arimi
they understand the Syrians who are now called Arami: rightly indeed; for Aram
the Son of Sem, was the father of the Syrians; whence Syria was also called
(...) Aram, and the Syrians Arimeans; as Strabo l. 16. (...). Graeci fere per
omnia Hebraizantes, Typhonem non modo (...) Gigantem feruntsed and -- tene
brosa in Tartara mittunt. Dick. c. 1.
Of this see more Dickinson Delphi Phaeniciz. cap. 2. where he proves that Og
and Typhon are the same. 1. From their names. Typhon comes from (...) to burn;
which answers to (...) Og burned. 2. Og was the Head of the Giants, who
fighting against the Lord, were destroyed, yea cast down to Hell; which is
thence styled Prove. 21.16. (...) the Congregation of the Giants. Hence the
Grecians fabled, that Typhon was not only (...) a Giant that fought against the
Gods, but also by them cast into Tartar, there to burn for ever. That by the
Giants war, we are to understand, that of Og and the rest of the Cananites, see
B. 3. C. 8.. 1. Dick. c. 1. Hereby we may gather that Typho answers to Og; who
was slain in Aramaea or Syria by Joshua. Vere locum signaverat Homerus ein
Arimois, quod Virgilius cum non intellexisset, uno verbo Inarimes reddidit:
Errore manifesto. Diserte enim princeps ille Poetarum Arimos notat, quos in
Syria collocat Possidonius, cui Strabo astipulatur tous Surous Arimous
dechontas, etc. Sand. Desc. l. 1.. 20.
So Vossius de Idololat lib. 1. cap. 26. where he concludes: These things
sufficiently show, that Hercules's battle against the Giants, and Typho was
committed in Arabia and Syria in which places they fought against the
Canaenites, and Og King of Basan, as Moses teaches. Neither does the Age of
Hercules and Joshua differ: only we may not understand the Theban but the
oriental Hercules hereby; whom we may call the Egyptian Hercules, because he
(i.e. Joshua) was borne in Egypt; also the Indian i.e. the Arabian, Hercules;
because he performed his great achievements here; also the Tyrian or Phenician
Hercules; because the Tyrians transferred the things done by this Joshua, to
their Hercules.

. 4. Hercules name Melicarthus proper to Joshua.
6. The Identitie betwixt Hercules and Joshua, may be concluded from the name
Melicartus, given to Hercules by Sanchoniathon, Eusebius. praep. li. 1. (...)
Melicarthus, who also is Hercules. Melicarthus is either the same with the
Phenician (...) Melec Kartha, which signifies King of the City: or else with
(...) Melec arits, the terrible or strong King: for from (...) arits strong or
terrible, by an easy transposition, came the Greek (...) the name which the
Egyptians give unto Mars, who in these oriental parts passed for the same with
Hercules. Melicarthus the same with Mars
So Vossius de Idololatr. lib. 1. cap. 22. where, having given the first Etymon
of Melicarthus, from (...), he adds, but it is lawful to affirm that the last
part of the word is the same with (...). For Mars and Hercules were
promiscuously used in those oriental parts. Now (...) with the Egyptians was
Mars, and of the same original with (...); namely from (...) arits, which, by
the trajection of t, makes Artis or (...); and hence by the rejection of (...)
came (...). Now the Heb: (...) arits signifies a terrible, and ((...)) a
valiant man, or warrier. This is the proper character of Joshua, who was
contemporary to, and, I presume, the same with the Phenician Hercules. And
indeed this Age, wherein Hercules is said to live, afforded no one comparable
to Joshua for warlike achievements.

7. (...) the same with Mars and Joshua.
7. Yea the Greek (...), the name of Hercules, gives us farther conjectures,
that he was amongst the Phenicians the same with Mars the God of Battle, and
both the same originally with Joshua. For (...) (as before) is the same with
(...) Hera's Glory, or fame. Now (...) is either (by an usual transposition of
letters) the same with (...), Mars's name, from (...) arits or aris (for the
Greeks and Latins write (...) by S.) terrible or valiant; or else with the
Chaldee (...) herin and the Syriack (...) Harin, which signifies Princes or
Heroes so Eccles. 10.17. (...) sons of Princes as Jer. 27.19. (...); whence the
Greek (...) Heroes. Hence we find both these joined together by Hesychius, in
his character of the Persian Princes or Heroes: (...), the Artaei, or Martial
Commanders, are called by the Persians, Heroes. (...) from (...), the name of
Mars and Hercules, signifies a great and terrible Champion. So Herodot. l. 6.
tells us, that according to the Greek tongue, (...), Artoxerxes is a great
warrier: from (...), which denotes a terrible and valiant warrier. And then,
whereas Hesychius says, that these Artaei, or warriers, were by the Persians
styled (...); this is the same with the Chaldee (...) Herin, Princes, Nobles,
Heroes, eas before. So that whether we derive Hercules from one or the other, it
comes all to the same; namely, that he was the same with Mars, a terrible
champion or Hero; which answers exactly to Joshua's character, who was the most
renowned Champion of his Age, wherein Hercules was supposed to live. 8. That
the ancient Hercules was a Phenician, and the same originally with Joshua.
8. That the most ancient Hercules was not a Grecian, but a Tyrian, or
Phenician Hero, and the same with Joshua, may be concluded by what we find of
him in Lucian, Eusebius, and others. First, that the most ancient Hercules was
not a Grecian but Tyrian, is evident by what is delivered concerning him in
Lucian, of the Syrian Goddess. That Temple (says he) of Hercules, which is at
Tire, belongs not to the Theban Hercules, which the Greeks so much extol; but
him that I speak of is more ancient, styled (...) the Tyrian Hercules. Thus
Lucian: who calls Hercules (...), whence (...), and both from (...) Herin,
princes, Heroes, etc. as before. 9. Hercules contemporary with Joshua.
9. That this Phenician Hercules was the same with Joshua, Vossius ( de Idolol.
lib. 1. cap. 26.) proves, as by many other arguments, so especially from their
parallel as to the time, and age, wherein they lived. Fuit Hercules ille
Aegyptius, Possevino test, ad annos circiter 200 ante Alexandrum, quod Josuae
temporibus apt convenit. Dickins. Delph. c. 4.
His words are these: Yea that this Hercules lived in the same Age with Joshua,
is the opinion of the Ancients: as Eusebius, in Chronicis. For number. 142. he
brings in Moses enjoying the blessed Vision of God on Mount Sina: and 5. years
before, namely number. 137. you find, that Hercules, surnamed Desanaus, was
greatly famous in Phenicia. Thus Vossius. Desanaus.
This name Desanaus, given to Hercules, some make to be derived from (...)
Daschen, fat and strong, whence Psalm. 22.30. Ps. 22.30.
(...) the fat or strong of the Earth, i.e. the potent, or mighty of the earth:
which appellation exactly suits with Hercules, (who was styled potens) as also
with Joshua. Hence also Hercules is fabled to be fellow soldier with Bacchus;
and together with him to appear at the mountain Nysa against the Giants: which
exactly answers to Joshua's accompanying of Moses, whom many of the Poets
called Bacchus, as before chap. 3.. 3. Lastly, whereas some make Hercules to be
the same with Samson, Vossius de Idololat. lib. 1. cap. 22. refutes this; by
showing, that the Phenician Hercules lived about the same time that Moses was
present with God in the Mount, according to Eusebius; and therefore he cannot
be the same with Samson, whose Age suits better with the Theban Hercules. Thus
much for Hercules his genealogy from, and paritie with, Joshua, etc.

. 5. Mars his Theogonie.
Having done with Hercules, we shall add a little more touching Mars, who
amongst the Phenicians was the same with Hercules, and so originally Joshua; as
it may farther appear both from his Names and Attributes.

1. As for the Greek name (...), it may fetch its Etymon either from (...)
Aris, terrible and strong; or from (...) harin, princes, heroes; as in the
foregoing Section. Heinsius deduceth (...) from (...), the Sun; which the
Greeks worshipped also under the name of Mars. The Latin Mars might be derived
from (...) by the apposition of M: but Glassius Gram. S. lib. 4. Tract. 3.
obser. 5. derives Mars from (...) he rebelled, and so we may look on him as the
same with Nimrod. Vossius fetches it rather from (...) Marats, pollere, to be
strong, etc. Whence also Mars was called by some (...). So Julian the Apostate,
in his oration of the Sun, speaks thus: It is lawful yet to draw forth somewhat
from the Theology of the Phenicians. Those who inhabit Edessa, a place from
all eternity sacred to the Sun, give him two Assessors, Monimus and Azizus.
Which Jamblichus thus interprets, as Monimus is Mercury, so Azizus Mars, etc.
(...) seems apparently but a derivative from the Syriack and Arabic (...)
Aziz, which signifies strong. So Psalm. 24.8. Ps. 24.8.
(...) Jehovah Hizzuz, the Lord strong: whence Mars was styled by the
Phenicians (...) Hizzuz. The same name also was given him by the ancient Gauls,
as it appears in the History of the old Gauls, by Antonius Gosseninus lib. 1.
cap. 28. also by Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 42. Hesus properly signifies strong
or mighty; as (...) Hizzuz amongst the Hebrews, and (...) aziz with the
Chaldees, etc.

Mars his parallel with Joshua.
2. As for the Genealogy, and Attributes of Mars, some make him to be the same
with Hercules, and so, by consequence, parallel unto Joshuah. So Vossius de
Idololat. lib. 1. cap. 22. tells us, that Melichartus, Hercules's name, may be
derived from Melec-Artes; for Mars and Hercules passed promiscuously, amongst
the Orientals, for one and the same God. If so, then Mars, as well as Hercules,
runs parallel with Joshua. This seems to agree with what Diodorus lib. 5.
speaks of Mars: (...). The Mythologists report, that Mars was the first who
furnished armature, and soldiers with Arms, and brought in the mode of
fighting by signs given; and destroyed all those who would not believe the
Gods. I am not ignorant, that Vossius ( de Idololatr. lib. 1. cap. 16.) refers
this description of Mars to Nimrod, whom they make to be the first Inventor of
Arms, and military Affairs: but there are some things that may incline us
rather to believe, that Joshua gave the original Idea to this Oriental
Tradition touching Mars. As 1. Diodorus tells us, that this Mars destroyed such
as disbelieved or disobeyed the Gods: which cannot properly be referred to
Nimrod, who was the first that taught men to disbelieve and disobey the Gods;
but it may be very appositely applied unto Joshua, who was zealous and bold in
destroying the unbelieving and disobedient, both Jews and Cananites, etc. 2.
Whereas he tells us, that the Mythologists say, Mars was the first that invented
military weapons and affairs, etc. This may as well refer to Joshua, as to
Nimrod. For albeit Nimrod began wars in Asia the greater, or Babylon; yet we
find no considerable wars amongst the Cananites, or Phenicians, till Joshua's
time; who by reason of his great military Exploits and victories, might well
be reputed the God of War, Mars, or Hercules. 3. That which may add to this
parallelizing of Mars with Joshua is, that the Mythologists (whom Diodorus here
brings in as the Authors of this description) found abundant more matter and
reason to reduce the stories they had received by Tradition touching Joshua,
unto Mars, than those of Nimrod. For the stories of Joshua were then, when
Mythologie began to creep into the world, very fresh and pregnant, etc. 4. We
have proved before, out of the concessions of Vossius himself, that Mars was
the same with Hercules, and therefore with Joshua.

3. Mars's his parallel with Nimrod.
Yet we need not reject, but may also allow, without any contradiction, a
parallel betwixt Mars and Nimrod: as 1. Nimrod was called by his subjects,
Belus. So Servius on Virg. Aen. 1. says, that Belus was the first that reigned
in the Assyrian Monarchy. Mars also had the same title given to him; whence
some derive bellum war, from Belus, Mars's name. 2. Nimrod is said to be a
mighty hunter, i.e. Warrier, Genesis 10.8. so Mars. See more of this parallel
betwixt Nimrod and Mars, in Vossius, de Idololatr. lib. 1. cap. 16.

CHAP. VI. The Theogonie of Vulcan, Silenus, Pan, Prometheus, Neptune, Janus,
Aeolus, Rhea, Minerva, Ceres, Niobe, and the Sirenes.
Vulcan the same with Tubal cain, Genesis 4.22. Silenus's parallel with, Silo,
Genesis 40.10. etc. Silenus the same with Silas and Silo. Silenus is said to be
without Father and Mother; as Silo and Melchisedek his Type Heb. 7.3. Silenus
is said to be the greatest Doctor of his Age, from Silo's Character Genesis 49.10.
Silenus's riding on an Ass, from Silo's Genesis 49.11. Silenus's being filled
with Wine, from Silo's Genesis 49.12. Silenus's meat Cows milk, from Silo's
Character Genesis 49.12. Silenus's Parallel with Balaam. The Theogonie of Pan and
his Parallel with the Hebrew Messiah. Pan the same with Silenus, Faunus, and
Satyrus. Pan's parallel with Abel, Israel, and Cham. Prometheus's Theogonie and
Parallel with Noah: as also with Magog. Neptunes Theogonie and Parallel with
Japhet. Janus's Parallel with Noah, and Javan. The Theogonie of Aeolus, Rhea,
Minerva, Ceres, Niobe, and the Sirenes, Hebraick.

. 1. Vulcan the same with Tubalcain Genesis 4.22.
FRom Mars we pass to Vulcan, who was exactly parallel unto, and derived from
Tubalcain, as both their Names and Attributes prove. Vnde nisi a Tubalcain
Vulcanus. Sandf. de Desc. l. 1.. 21.
First, as to the name Vulcan, Vossius de Idolatr. lib. 1. cap. 16. shows us
that Vulcanus is the same with Tubalcanus Genesis 4.22. only by a wonted and easy
mutation of B into V. and casting away a syllable: as from (...) lacte and from
(...) rura.

2. As for the main Art or Office attributed to Vulcan, we have it mentioned by
Diodorus lib. 5. (...) etc. By Vulcan, as they say, was invented the
fabrication of Iron, Brass, Gold, Silver, and all other metals, which receive
the operation of fire; as also the universal use of fire, as employed by
Artificers and others. Whence the Masters of these Arts offer up their prayers
and sacreds to this God chiefly: and by these, as by all others, Vulcan is
called (...) fire, and having by this means given a great benefit to the common
life of men, he is consecrated to immortal memory and honor. Thus Diodorus:
wherein he gives us an exact account why the Mythologists consecrated Vulcan,
and made him the God of Fire, and all Arts perfected by fire. Which exactly
answers to the character given to Tubalcain Genesis 4.22. Genesis 4.22.
Tubalcain an instructor of every Artificer in iron and brass, etc. Thence
Bochart in his Preface to Phaleg speaks thus: The Grecians, when they write of
the first Inventors of things, to Tubalcain, who first invented the conflature
of Metals, they substitute the Curetes, or the Cyclopes, or Vulcanus Lemnius,
etc. This also exactly answers to Sanchoniathons character of Vulcan, whom
(according to Philo Byblius's Version) he calls (...), in the Phenician Tongue
(...) Chores-ur, i.e. (...) one, who by the operation of fire, fabricates
metals into any form: whence Lucian calls Vulcan (...); and the Poets feign him
to be the chief fabricator of all Jupiters thunderbolts, etc. So Bochart Can.
lib. 2. cap. 2.

. 2. Silenus the same with Silo. Genesis 49.10.
We now come to Silenus, so famous amongst the Poets, whom they place in the
order of their Gods; whose Names, Genealogy, and Attributes, apparently prove
him to have been, by a monstrous Satanick imitation, of sacred origination. 1.
As for his Greek name, which is variously written either (...), or (...), or
(...), or (...) Bochart ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 18. fol. 482.) makes it to be an
evident derivative from the Hebrew (...) Silo, the Messias's name Genesis 49.10.
for from (...) Silo comes (...) Silan, whence (...) Silenus.

2. Neither does Silenus agree with Silo, the Jewish Messiah, in Name only, but
also in Genealogy, according to that of Diodorus lib. 3. (...), 'The first
that ruled at Nysa was Silenus; whose Genealogy is unknown by all, by reason
of his antiquity.

Nysa where Silenus reigned the same with Sina, or Nissi.
1. As for Nysa, where Silenus reigned, it seems either the same with Mount
Sina (by the transposition of S. and N.) the place where God delivered the law
to Moses, who therefore was said to reign there, as Vossius; or else Nysa is
the same with the place where Moses, Exodus 17.15. built an Altar, and called
the name of it Jehovah Nissi. as C. 5.. 3. Whence Nysa according to Bochart, as
before. And that which makes this more evident is, that this Nysa, where
Silenus reigned, is the same with that of Bacchus, who is called (...) the God
of Nysa from that of Moses, Exodus 17.15. Jehovah Nissi. For Bacchus and Silenus
are made by the Poets to be inseparable companions as C. 3.. 3.

Silenus's Genealogy, as Silo's unknown. Heb. 7.3.
2. As for Silenus's Genealogy, Diodorus also tells us, that it was unknown to
all by reason of its Antiquity or Eternity: which answers to the Hebrews
account of their Messiah, Hebr. 7.3. without father, without mother, having
neither beginning of days, etc. the character of Melchisedek, the type of
Christ.

Silenus and Silo agrees in offices. Genesis 49.10.
3. There is yet a more exact Parallel betwixt Silenus and the Hebrew Silo or
Shiloh, as to Attributes, and Offices: for 1. Of Silo it is said Genesis 49.10. and
to him shall be (...) the Doctrine of the people, or the Congregation of the
people, to be endoctrinated. Thus Silenus is also made by the Poets to be the
greatest Doctor of his Age: for he is called (...) Bacchus's Praeceptor, i.e.
according to Vossius's account, Bacchus was Moses, and Silenus was Silo or
Christ, who instructed Moses on Mount Sina or Nysa, the place where Bacchus and
Silenus were said to be. Silenus the great Doctor; as Silo is styled.
Again Tertullian, de Anima cap. 2. makes Silenus to be a Phrygian, who being
brought by the Pastors to Midas the King, he lent him his great Asses ears.
Vossius (de Idololat. lib. 1. cap. 21.) thus deciphers this fable. It is no
wonder that Midas is said to lend Silenus his Asses ears; because he was the
most intelligent of his Age both in nature and Antiquity. The import is; that
Midas listened greatly to him as his Instructor. I suppose Silenus is said to
be a Phrygian, because the Phrygians were some of the first great Mythologists,
who traduced fables into Greece, particularly this of Silenus, from the
Phenicians and Hebrews.

Silenus's riding on an Ass, from Silo's Genesis 49.11.
2. Another Attribute given to Silenus is (...) carried for the most part on an
Ass: and hence Silenus had a particular remarque for riding on an Ass: which
Bochart refers to that prophecy of Silo Genesis 49.11. binding his Asses colt to
the choice Vine. 3. The Mythologists fable Silenus, camrade of Bacchus, to be
employed in treading out the Grapes. This Bochart refers to Genesis 49.11. he
washed his garments in wine, and his cloths in the blood of Grapes, which is
explicated Esa. 5. of such as tread out the grapes.

Silenus's being filled with wine, from Gen 49.12.
4. They characterize Silenus, as one that was always drunk; as it is supposed
from what follows Genesis 49.12. His eyes shall be red with wine: which Solomon
makes the character of one overcome with wine, Prove. 23.29,30. to whom rednes
of eyes, etc. Silenus's meat Cows milk, from Genesis 49.12.
5. They ascribe to Silenus for his meat, Cows Milk: which Bochart makes to be
traduced from Genesis 49.12. and his teeth white with Milk. Whence he concludes
thus: The Devil could have imagined nothing more abominable whereby to profane
the most holy mysteries of our Religion, and to expose it to the cavils of most
wicked men, etc.

6. That Silenus had his original traduction from Silo the Jewish Messiah will
farther appear from that of Pausanius Eliacon. 2. (...). The monument of
Silenus remains in the Country of the Hebrews, i.e. all the Traditions of
Silenus came from the Hebrews, whose Messiah he was. Silenus's parallel with
Balaam.
I know, that Sandfordus de Descensu Christi l. 1.. 21. supposes Balaam to be
Silenus. Nothing, says he, hinders, but that Balaam should be Silenus; namely,
he who was so famous for his Ass, and Prophecy. The Ancients fable, that
Bacchus gave a reward to a certain Ass that he should speak with human voice,
with which the Giants, which were Bacchus's enemies, were terrified. Whence
came these things but from the sacred Scriptures? Numb. 22.28. Number. 22.28.
the Lord opened the mouth of the Ass, etc. which being divulged far and near,
we need not doubt but that the Moabites were terrified thereat. So
Stillingfleet, Origin. S. Book. 3. cap. 5. sect. 11. makes this whole fable of
Silenus to be taken from the story of Balaam, to whom he seems parallel; in
that both were noted for their skill in Divination; both taken by the water,
Numb. 22.5. Number. 22.5.
both noted for riding on an Ass, etc. Though it is possible, that many Branches
of Silenus's story may be referred to that of Balaam, yet I should rather
refer the main of it to Silo, Genesis 49.10. according to that of Bochart ( Can.
lib. 1. cap. 18. fol. 482.) The first of Bacchus 's companions is Silenus,
whose fable took its original from the prophecy of Silo, Genesis 49.10. in a
monstrous manner detorted etc. This may be farther evinced by what follows, of
Pan, which some make the same with Silenus.

. 3. The Theogonie of Pan, and his parallel with the Jewish Messiah.
That Pan, whom the Poets feign to be the God of Shepherds, was parallel to,
and, as it is presumed, originally traduced from the Jewish Messiah, styled the
Shepherd of Israel, may be evinced from their parallel Names, Attributes, and
Offices. 1. As for the origination of Pan, Bochart ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 18. fol.
483.) groundedly draws it from the Heb. (...) Pan, which ^ignifies such an one
as is struck, or strikes with astonishing fears, and stupifying terrors, as
Psalm. 88.16. and the reason of this notation is considerable: for Pan being
supposed to be one of Bacchus's Commanders, is said to have sent astonishing
fears on all their enemies; whence that proverbial speech, of Pannick fears.
This seems to allude to the story of Israel's being conducted in the
wilderness by Christ, the Shepherd of Israel, who cast Pannick fears on all
their Enemies: according to that confession of Rahab, Josh. 2.9,24.
Joshua 2.9. Your terror is fallen upon us, etc. so v. 24. The inhabitants of
the country do faint because of us. The like Joshua 5.1. Josh. 5.1.
Their heart melted, neither was their spirit in them any more, because of the
children of Israel. Pan the same with Silenus.
2. Pan is called also by the Latins, Sylvanus: which some derive from Sylvis;
but other, on more probable conjecture, make it the same with the Greek
Silenus, or Silas: and so in Scripture the same person, who is called Sylvanus,
1 These. 1.1. is styled Silas, Act. 17.4. as Grotius, and Deodati. Now Silas is
the same with Silenus, from (...) Silo, or (...) Silan. Pan the same with
Faunus.
3. That which makes this farther evident, is the identitie betwixt Pan and
Faunus; which Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 18. asserts in these words. Faunus,
amongst the Latins, is the same God, and of the same original with Pan: for
(...) with some sounds Fun. Thence Ovid, in Phaedra; -- Faunique Bicornes
Numine contactas attonuere --
And Bochart ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 33.) affirms, that many make Faunus to be the
same God with Sylvanus, and both the same with Pan: and then he adds, And
truly, Evander Arcas was the first that brought the worship of Faunus into
Latium, out of Arcadia, where Pan was worshipped. Satyrus the same with Pan and
Silenus.
4. Yea Vossius de Idololatr. lib. 1. cap. 8. seems to make Satyrus the same
with Pan, Faunus, and Silenus: and the main difference he makes between them is
only this; That whereas Pan, Faunus, Silenus, and Satyrus, are all wood
Deities, the name Satyrus is more general, and usually attributed to the
younger; whereas that of Silenus was given to the more ancient. That which
makes for this affirmation is, that Pan, Faunus, Satyrus, and Silenus are all
reckoned as companions of Bacchus in his expedition. Bochart ( Can. lib: 1.
cap. 18. fol. 483.) derives Satyr from (...) Sair, which amongst the Hebrews
signifies both a Goat and Devil; (as Maimonides) because the Devil often presents
himself in the form of a Goat etc. But

2. To pass from names to the thing it self. Pan is said to be an Egyptian
God, who came up with Bacchus to fight against the Giants. So Diodorus Sic.
Bibl. 1. Unto this God Pan the natives not only erect (...), Images in every
Temple; but also they have a city in Thebais, which they call (...), [i.e.
Cham's city,] but interpret it, (...), the city of Pan. By which it is
evident, that Pan was an Egyptian God, and, as we may presume, the same with
the Hebrew Messiah, who conducted Moses (the Egyptian Bacchus) and the
Israelites out of Egypt, unto Canaan, striking terrors into the Cananites, as
before. Pan a fable of the Messiah.
That Pan, the God of Shepherds, and those many fabulous Attributes and Offices
given unto him, were originally borrowed from the Jewish Messiah, held forth in
the old Testament under the Emblem of a Shepherd, is proved at large by
Jackson, in his discourse of the Divine Authority of sacred Scripture, fol. 31.
where he cites a relation out of Plutarch, touching the mourning of the
Demoniack Spirits, for the death of their great God Pan, and the ceasing of all
their Oracles thereupon: which was truly and only verified in Christ, whose
death put a period to all Heathen Oracles, as both sacred and pagan stories
relate. Pan Abel.
But to finish this Genealogy of Pan, Bochart (in the Preface to his Phaleg
fol. 2.) reduces his original to Abel. The Greeks (says he) when they write
of the first Inventors of things, substitute Pan the Arcadian unto Abel, the
Prince of Pastors, etc. Pan Israel.
Sandford, de descensu Christi l. 1.. 19. supposes Pan to be the same with the
Patriarch Israel, or Jacob. Israel Patriarcha verus forte Pan Gentilium. Park.
ex Sandf. Pan Cham.
His words are these: for Joseph is that old Osyris, nourished by Pan, whom I
conceive to be Israel. Dickinson, Delph, Phoenciz. cap. 4. makes Pan the same
with Cham: which he endeavors to prove from that of Diodor. Sicul. l. 1. where
the same city in Egypt, which is called (...), i.e. the city of Cham, is
interpreted by the Natives, the city of Pan. We need not exclude either of
these Parallels with Pan; because we find that the Mythologists were, according
to their different humors, very difforme and different in the application of
their Fables. Only, I suppose, the great Pan, so much idolized by the Poets as
the God of Shepherds, refers chiefly to the Jewish Messiah, the great Shepherd
of Israel, as before.

. 4. Prometheus his Theogonie and parallel with Noah.
We now proceed to Prometheus, and his Genealogy, Names, and Attributes, with
their parallel in sacred story and persons. There is some difference among
Philologists about the Traduction of Prometheus; some reducing him to Noah,
others to Magog, Japhet's son: which controversy may be, with much ease,
reconciled, by taking in both reductions. For its certain that the old
Mythologists were no way uniforme or conform in the application of those
fables, they gleaned up in the Oriental parts. Therefore to begin with those
who make Prometheus the same with Noah: as Vossius de Idololatr: lib. 1. cap.
18. page 141. The Patriarch Noah (says he) is adumbrated to us, not only in
Saturn, but also in Prometheus, whose Feast is called at Athens (...), in
which there is a contest of Lamps; also an Altar in the Academie, on which the
Lamps are wont to be kindled in this Contest; as it is attested by Harpocration,
etc. Thus Vossius. This Rite, consecrated to Prometheus, I presume, had its
original Idea from the Lamps which burned in the Temple at Jerusalem, and from
the fire on the Altar: whence also that fable of Prometheus's stealing fire
from Heaven: (which may allude to Elijah's praying for fire, which descended
from Heaven, etc.) But as to the parallel betwixt Prometheus and Noah, take
these particulars. 1. As under Noah, so also under Prometheus, the great Flood
was supposed to happen. So Diodorus, lib. 1. (...) etc. They say that Nilus
having broken down its bounds, overwhelmed a great part of Egypt, especially
that part where Prometheus reigned, which destroyed the greatest part of men in
his Territory. Whereas some may object, that this is meant only of a
particular Deluge in Egypt, under Prometheus etc. It Is replied, that as the
Grecians attributed the general Flood to Deucalion, so the Egyptians attributed
the same to Prometheus, or, as Eusebius, to Ogyges; whereas all these fabulous
Deluges, were but broken Traditions of the real universal Deluge under Noah.
And particularly, that this under Prometheus was the same with that of Noah,
Vossius endeavors to prove from the notation of the name: for (says he) (...)
signifies one who is so wise, as to foresee evil; whereas on the contrary,
(...) is one, who is too late, or after-wise. which agrees to Noah, who being
divinely taught, foresaw the flood, and so preserved himself and his. 2.
Prometheus is said to rebuild and restore human kind after the flood: which
exactly answers to Noah, the father of Mankind, etc. 3. Herodot: lib. 4. tells
us, that Prometheus's wife was called Asia. And indeed, Noah's wife was no
other than Asia, or Asiatica, an Asiatick. But whereas it may be objected, that
Prometheus is made to be the son of Iapetus, and therefore cannot be Noah, but
must be his Grandchild; Vossius replies, that it is no wonder, if in Ages so
remote, posterity miscalled the Father and the son, and so confounded one with
the other.

2. Prometheuss's parallel with Magog.
2. Bochart, to avoid this contradiction, makes Prometheus to be Magog the son
of Iapetus, or Japhet. So Bochart Phaleg lib. 1. cap. 2. fol. 11. also lib. 3.
cap. 13. where he proves, that Prometheus is the same with Magog. 1. In that he
is styled the son of Iapetus; as Magog was the son of Japhet. 2. From the
eating of Prometheus's heart; which fable sprang from the name (...) Magog;
which, being applied to the heart, implies its consumtion, or wasting away. 3.
Prometheus is said to have his seat, and to lie in Caucasus; because Magog, and
his posterity seated themselves there. 4. They fable, that fire and metals
were invented by Prometheus, (as formerly by Vulcan:) because there are many
subterraneous fires and metals in these places. Stillingfleet; Orig. S. book 3.
cap. 5.. 9. etc. follows Bochart herein.

. 5. Neptune the same with Japhet.
From Prometheus we pass to Neptune; which is indeed a name rather appellative
and common, than proper. For as in ancient times, especially before the Trojan
wars, they styled all illustrious Kings, Jupiter, and all renowned Captains,
Mars, or Hercules; so also they called every Insular Prince by the name of
Neptune: whence multitudes partook of one and the same name; which made their
characters and stories the more fabulous and ambiguous: yet are we not without
evident ideas and notices of their Traduction, originally, from some sacred
person or story, as has been already demonstrated by a large enumeration of
particulars; which will farther appear by the genealogy and stor^ of Neptune,
who according to the general consent of the (...), was originally Japhet the
son of Noah. For look (...) memory of Noah was preserved in Saturn; Unde
etiam Japetus nisi a Japhet. Sandf. Desc. l. 1.. 22.
and of Shem (whose posterity possessed the septentrional and oriental Asia)
in Pluto; and also of Cham (whose progeny seated in the Meridional, Asia, and
Africa) in Jupiter Hammon: so also the memory and story of Japhet was
continued in Neptune, as Philologists generally accord, and that one these
rational conjectures: The parallel 'twixt Japhet and Neptune.
1. From the very name Neptune; which Bochart derives from (...) Niphtha, which
belongs to Niphal, or the Passive Conjugation of (...) Patha to enlarge; whence
(...) Japhet, according to the allusion of Noah Genesis 9.27. Genesis 9.27.
(...) Japht Elohim lejaphet, i.e. God shall enlarge Japhet. (...) of the same
origination with Japhet.
Proportionable whereto Neptune was called by the Greeks (...); which
Grammarians in vain attempt to deduce from the Greek tongue; seeing, as
Herodotus in Euterpe assures us; the name (...), was at first used by none, but
the Libyans or Africans, who always honored this God. Namely (...) or (...) is
the same with the Punick (...) Pesitan; which signifies Expanse or broad; from
(...) Pesat to dilate, or expand. Whence it appears, that (...) and Japhet are
Synonymous; and both derived from Radix's, signifying latitude: which well
suits with Neptune's Character; who is styled (...) late imperans and
latisonans; as also (...) one that has a large breast, etc. See more of this
Bochart, Phaleg. lib. 3. cap. 1.2. From the Genealogy of Neptune; whom the
Mythologists make to be Saturnes son; as Japhet was son to Noah, who passed for
Saturn.

Neptune the God of the Sea, from ^phets posses^ (...) Islands.
3. Neptune was fabled to be the God of the Sea, and Instructor of Navigation;
So Diodorus lib. 5. (...). etc. The Cretenses say, that amongst other Gods
borne of Saturn and Rhea, Neptune first began to manage the Affairs (...) the
Sea, and to instruct for Navigation; he having obtain^ this prefecture from
Saturn, whence it came to pass, that in af^ time the common Vogue so far
obtained, that whatever ever was done at Sea, was said to have been in the
power of Neptune, and therefore the Mariners sacrificed unto him. Thus
Diodorus. All which seems to have been taken up from the real story of Japhet,
and his Posterity, their possessing the Islands in the midland Sea, Greece,
etc. So Bochart Phaleg lib. 1. cap. 2. Japhet (says he) passed for Neptune the
God of the Sea; because his portion was in the Islands and Peninsules. In the
Islands are Britannie, Ireland, Thule, Crete, Sicilie, Sardinia, Corsica,
Baleares, etc. In the peninsules are Spain, Italy, Greece, Asia minor, etc. So
Lactantius de falsa Relig. l. 1. c. 11. All the maritime places, with the
Islands, belonged unto Neptune, etc. This suits with Plato's origination of
Neptunes Greek name; who (in his Cratylus) deriveth (...), from his giving
drink, i.e. the Sea and Water unto all: which argues thus much, that they
looked on Neptune as the God of the Sea, and that in allusion to Japhets
possessing the maritime parts of Europe, etc.

4. Neptune was also called (...) Equestris: which is thus explicated by
Diodorus lib. 5. where having spoken of Neptune as God of the Sea, he adds.
(...). They add also this of Neptune, that he was the first that tamed horses;
and that the Science of Horsemanship was first delivered by him; whence he was
styled (...) a good horseman. This also Vossius applies to Japhet: ( Vossius de
Idolol lib. 1. cap. 15. page 118.) his words are these: Japhet had for his
portion the Mediterranean Islands, and the European continent: wherefore his
posterity had need of a twofold Science, 1. Of Nautick, to direct them in
their Navigation, 2. Of Horsemanship to conduct themselves in those rude and
wild countries, through which they were to pass into the Northern and Western
parts of Europe. This I conjecture was the cause why Neptune, whom I interpret
Japhet, was made to be the God of Nautick Science and sea Affairs, as also of
Horsemanship, etc. But touching the Parallel 'twixt Japhet and Neptune, see
more Bochart Phaleg. lib. 3. cap. 1.

. 6. Janus's Theogonie and Pa^allel 1. With Noah.
As for the Theogonie of Janus and his parallel; if we consider him
historically, and according to the Mythologie of the Poets, so he refers to the
story of Noah, or Javan. That which inclines some to make him Parallel with
Noah, is 1. The cognation of his Name, with the Hebrew^" jain wine; whereof
Noah was the first Inventor, according to Vossius. Again, 2. Janus was pictured
with a double forhead; because he saw a double world, that before and after the
Flood: as Noah. 3. As the beginning and propagation of mankind, after the
Flood, was from Noah; so also they ascribe the beginnings of all things unto
Janus: whence the entrance to an house is called by the Romans, Janua; and the
entrance to the year Januarie. Whence some make the name Xisythrus, given by
the Assyrians to Noah, (as in the story of the Flood Book. 3. chap. 6.. 4.) to
signify an entrance or door, from (...) ziz a post or threshold of a door; as
Vossius: 4. Latium, where Janus's seat was, (whence part of old Rome was called
Janicule) was called Oenotria. Now (...) comes from (...) Wine. Thus much for
Janus's parallel with Noah. 2. With Javan.
Others refer the origination (both name and person) of Janus to Javan the son
of Japhet, the parent of the Europeans. For 1. (...) Javan is much the same
with Janus. 2. Thence that of Horat. l. 1.3. Japeti Genus. So Voss. Idol. l. 2.
c. 16. Janus's name taken historically is the contract of Javan.

. 7. Of Aeolus his Origination.
To Janus we might subjoin Aeolus, the God of the winds and King of the Aeoliar
Islands, with notices of his Traduction from the Phenicians and Hebrews. But we
shall touch only on his name, which seems to be a good key or Index to decipher
his fabulous Office. This fable of Aeolus, the God of the winds, is supposed to
have been first brought into Greece by Homer; who had it from the Phenicians;
with whom (...) aol (as the Greek (...)) signifies a storm or tempest: which
the Chaldee Paraphrase more fully expresses by (...) alol: and the King Aeolus
is thought, by the Phenicians, to be the King (...) aolin of Tempests: as
Bochart Can lib. 1. cap. 33. fol. 658.

. 8. Grecian Goddesses of Phenician and Hebrew extract.
Having discoursed, at large, touching the chief of the Grecian Gods, and their
Traduction from the sacred Oracles; we shall briefly touch on sundry of their
Goddesses, and their derivation from the same sacred fountain, 1. Rhea from
Genesis 29.20.
1. Noah is called Genesis 29.20. (...) a husband of the earth, i.e. a husband
man. Whence the Mythologists made Saturn, i.e. Noah, the husband of Rhea, i.e.
the Earth. Some derive Rea, by an easy anagrammatisme, from Era. So Sandford
Descens. l. 1.. 26. The Greeks refer Era. (Heb. (...) eres.) i.e. the Earth,
unto the number of their Gods: by what ceremony? Namely according to the old
Grammarian rule, changing Era into Rea. After the same manner Aer began to be
Hera: for this origination (...) we have from Plato. I should rather derive
(...) from the Chaldee (...) Hera, Libera, which was Juno her name; whence also
(...) Cora, or Hora, and Cerea as before, C. 2.. 1. and C. 5.. 1. etc.

2. Minerva.
2. As for Minerva; Vossius ( de Idololatr. lib. 1. cap. 17.) makes her to be
the same with Naamah, Tubalcains sister, Genesis 4.22. Her name (...) Stephanus
makes to be Phenician; (...): which Bochart derives from (...) to move war;
whence the Oncean Gates at Thebes. The fable of Minerva her being borne out of
Jupiters head, they generally refer to the generation of Christ, the Divine
wisdom.

3. Ceres.
3. Ceres is by Bochart substituted, and made parallel to Adam, or Cain, the
first tillers of ground. 4. Niobe.
4. Niobe is by some made the same with Lots wife, who was turned into a pillar
of Salt, i.e. of Sulphurous, bitumenous, and salty matter; wherein she was
partaker of Sodoms judgment, which overtook her: whence the fable of Niobe,
her being turned into a pillar of stone, etc. 5. Sirenes.
5. As for the Sirenes, (which according to the fable were in number three,
partly Virgins, partly Birds, whereof one sung with voice, the other by pipe;
and the other by Harp) Bochart ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 28.) makes the name to be
purely Phenician, or Hebrew; in which tongue (...) Sir, signifies a song,
(whence Solomon's Song of songs,) thence (...) Siren, a singing monster, etc.
6. As for Juno, and Jana, from (...), thence also Diana, Astarte, Venus, etc.
we have fully handled them before, chap. 2.

. 9. Thus much for the Theogonie of the Grecian and Roman Gods, and Goddesses,
which will receive farther evidence from what follows touching the Genealogy
of the Phenician and Egyptian Gods. For that the former were but the product of
the later, is evident. Thus Sandford de descensu l. 1.. 6. We may not fetch the
names of the Gods from the Grecians, but from the Phenicians or Egyptians. It
remains therefore that we treat of the Apotheosis of the Barbarian names, which
among those Ancients had not one and the same origination. For either some
thing was coined out of foreign letters, the name being relinquisht: or the
name, together with the thing, was traduced unto some mysteries of Religion.
This again was accomplished two manner of ways; either when a foreign Name, (so
far as the nature of the Tongue would admit it) the right order of the Letters
being relinquisht, was referred unto the Gods; or else the Letters being
transposed or changed, a new name was composed out of the old; which thence,
according to the same laws of Tongues, was invested with the Rite of some
Deity. Thus all those appellations of the Gods, which Greece borrowed from the
Barbarians, may be digested into 3 ranks. 1. Either they flow from the sole
explication of Nature; as from Abaddon sprang Apollon; or if you will rather,
according to the sacred Phraseologie, Apolluon: or 2. from the pronunciation of
the name; thus from Japhet was made Iapetos: or lastly from an Enallaxis of the
Letters; according to which form it is as clear as the light, that from Adamah
first sprang Hadam, and hence Hadan. Thus Sandford of the origination of the
Grecian Gods from the Egyptian, Phenician, or Hebrew names. See more of this
Chap. 7.. 12.

. 1. The Theogonie of the Phenician Gods Hebraick.
HAving gone through Hellenisme, or the Grecian (...), we now pass on to the
Oriental Gods, with endeavors to demonstrate how their Genealogy, Names, and
Attributes, received their derivation from the sacred Language and Oracles. We
shall begin with the Phenician Gods, which were the first, if not as to time,
yet as to dignity; whence the Grecians traduced the chiefest of their Gods. Of
Baal from (...), and Bell from (...) El.
And amongst the Phenician Gods, the chief was Baal, Bell, or Belus; concerning
which there is some difference amongst Philologists; yet all unanimously concur
in this, that its origination was from some Hebrew and sacred name; which will
evidently appear from the notation thereof. Damascius, in the life of Isidore,
mentioned by Photius, tells us, (...): The Phenicians and Syrians call Saturn
El, Bell, and Bolathen. Vossius makes Bell the contract of Beel, from (...) Baal,
the Lord, which name belonged originally to God, as it appears from Hosea
2.16,17. Hos. 2.16,17.
But Servius, on Virgil, supposes Bell to come of (...) El, Gods name; whence
the Greek (...) El, and the Digamma being added, (...) Bell, and so Belus.
Bochart, in a personal conference he favored me with, gave me a good
conciliation of these two opinions, by affirming, that there was originally a
twofold Belus, the one Assyrian, from (...), Heb. (...), originally (...), the
Assyrian God; whence Nimrod, the first of the Assyrian Monarchy, was called
Belus: the other Belus was a Phenician, from (...) Baal, the Phenician God;
whence Ithobaal, King of Tire, and Jezabel his daughter; as also many of the
Phenician Kings, who were called Belus. It Is true; Bochart makes the Phenician
(...) Baal, to have had its original from the first Phenician King of that
name; but yet I conceive it not improbable, but that the first Phenician King,
might be so called from their Gods name (...) Baal; which was the title they
gave the Sun, from his office, Genesis 1.16. as he was reputed the Lord of Heaven:
or else, which seems most probable, we may suppose the Phenicians to have had
various (...) Baalim; some supreme, which they styled (...), natural and
immortal Gods; such were the Sun and Moon: others, which they styled (...),
mortal Gods, viz. the souls of their great Heroes and Kings. As for the former
supreme natural Gods, they called the Sun Baal, and the Moon Baaltis or Beltis,
that is, in the Scripture language, the Queen of Heaven. As for the mortal or
made Baalim, they were no other than the Souls of their chief Heroes, or
Princes, which after their death received an (...), or Deification; and so
became a kind of midling Gods, or Mediators betwixt the supreme Gods and men,
(which the Greeks called (...) Demons) whereof we find frequent mention in
Scripture as Jud. 10.6.13. The Supreme Baal styled Beelsamen.
The Phenicians styled their supreme Baal (...) Baal Samen. So Sanchoniathon,
according to the Version of Philo Byblius, in Eusebius praepar. lib. 1. cap. 7.
(...) A drought happening, they lift up their hands to heaven, to the Sun. For
this (says Sanchoniathon) they account the only God; calling him Belsamen, the
Lord of Heaven. Beelsamen here, according to Philo Byblius's explication, is in
the Phenician Tongue (...) beelsamen i.e. the Lord of Heaven: whence Philo
Byblius immediately subjoins. (...) which is in the Phenician Tongue, Lord of
heaven. To which he adds: (...), but in the Greek tongue, he is zeus Jupiter.
So that Belsamen is the same with (...) Jupiter Olympius. So Vossius, de
Idolol. lib. 2. cap. 4. This (says he) we may confirm from the Hebrew Tongue,
which differs in dialect only from the Phenician. For what the Phenicians
pronounce Beelsamen, the Hebrews write (...) baal Schamaim, i.e. Lord of heaven
etc. Thus also Bochart ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 42.) And indeed all this touching
Belsamen, Sanchoniathon seems to have evidently traduced from that function or
Office, which God had laid on the Sun, mentioned Genesis 1.16. the greater light
to rule the day as Psalm. 136.8.

. 2. The Theogonie of Baalzebub. 2 King. 1.2.
This Phenician God Beelsamen, the Jews called Beelzebub, as 2 King. 1.2.
Baalzebub the God of Ekron. Concerning the Etymon of Baalzebub, various are the
conjectures of the Learned. The additament (...) zebub signifies a fly: whence
some think it was added by the Jews in a way of opprobium, or scorn; as if one
should say, the Lord of a fly. It is most probable, that this name Beelzebub
was given this Idol God, not by the Accaronites or Phenicians, but by the Jews;
and that from a great contempt and just hatred of the Accaronitick Idolatry.
Yea Vossius (de Idolol. lib. 2. cap. 4.) following the conjecture of learned
Jos. Scaliger herein, thinks that this name Beelzebub was curtaild by the Jews;
who, by an easy mutation, turned the Accaronitick name (according to Scaliger)
(...) baal zebahim, the Lord of Sacrifices, into the contemptuous Title of
(...) Baal zebub, the Lord of flies, i.e. a God that regarded only flies; or
that could not drive away the flies, by reason of their multitude, from the
Sacrifices. This name Beelzebub is, in the New Testament, changedinto (...)
Beelzebul. (...) being made (...) zebul, for greater contempt sake: for (...)
signifies dung or abominable, by which name the Gentile Gods are characterized,
2 King. 23.24. 2 Kings 23.24.
whence this name (...) is in the New Testament applied to the Prince of the
Devils: as indeed this Accaronitick Beelzebub was the chief of their Idols.
Hence also Hell was by the Greeks called Accaron, according to that of the
poet, Acheronta movebo; because Beelzebub the Prince of those Demon Idols, was
God of Accaron, as Mede and Bochart. The like Glassius ( lib. 4. Grammat. S.
Tract. 3. observe. 4.) The name Baalzebub 2. Kin. 1.2. 2 Kings 1.2.
which in the New Testament is written (...), B being changed into L. Mat.
12.24. Mat. 12.24.
Luke 11.15. refers to the Idol of Ekron, and signifies the Lord of a fly or
flies: peradventure because it was thought to drive away those pernicious flies
which infested the Ekronitish country, as Hercules was styled (...), from his
driving away Locusts, and Apollo (...), from dispersing the Phrygian mice. The
Jews traduced the name of this Idol to express the Devil by, and moreover
changed Beelzebub into Beelzebul, which ^ignifies the Lord of dung. See more of
this in Seldom de Diis. Syrum Syntag. 2. p. 211. That Beelzebub was the same
with Beelsamen etc. See Owen de Idolol. lib. 5. c. 5.

. 3. The Theogonie of Baal Peor Hebraick. Number. 25.2,3,6. Hos. 9.10.
This Phenician, Baal passed amongst the Moabites and Midianites under the Name
of Baal Peor. So Numb. 25.2,3,6. Psalm. 106.28. Hos. 9.10. (...) Baal peor,
which the LXX render (...). He was called Baalpeor from the mountain Peor,
where he was worshipped as Number. 23.28. So Apollinaris (Catena patrum Graecorum)
on Psa. 106.28. Psalm. 106.28.
And they were joined to Baal peor] (...): The Idol of Baal is in the place of
Peor; but the Greeks call Baal Belus, whom they affirm also to be Saturn.
Joseph Scaliger makes Baal Peor to signify the same with (...) Thundering
Jupiter. Jerome on Hos. 9. lib. 2. tells us, that Baal peor the Idol of the
Moabites, is the same with Priapus. So Isidorus Orig. lib. 8. cap. 11. Baalpeor
(says he) is interpreted an image of ignominy; for it was an Idol of Moab,
surnamed Baal, on the mount of Peor, which the Latins call Priapus, the God of
Gardens, etc. That this Baal peor was the same with the Grecian Priapus, seems
evident by their parallel sacrifices and worship. For, as fornication was a
main piece of worship, they performed to their lascivious God Priapus, so we
find the same performed to Baal peor, even by the Israelites. Number. 25.1,2,3.
So Numb. 25.1. Israel is said to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab:
which is explicated v. 2. by bowing down to their Gods] i.e. in a way of
fornication: whence it is said verse. 3. Israel joined himself to Baal peor] i.e.
worshipped him by fornication. We have it expressed in the same manner, Psalm.
206.28.
Psalm. 106.28. By, joining themselves to Baal peor, is meant their worshipping
him by fornication: and by eating the sacrifices of the dead we must understand
(with Austin on this place) their sacrificing to dead men, as to Gods or
Baalim. They worshipped Baal peor, their chief God, (which Vessius makes to be
the Sun) by fornication and sacrifices: or else we may refer these sacrifices
of the dead to those they performed to their inferior Baalim, which were but
some noble Heroes or Princes; who after their death were deifyed, and so became
midling Gods or Mediators; as elsewhere, But thus much for Baal peor,
concerning whom, see more Vossius de Idololatr. lib. 2. c. 7.

. 4. Moloch amongst the Ammonites the same with Baal.
The Phenician Baal passed amongst the Ammonites under the name of Moloch, from
(...) Melek, the King. So 1 King. 11.7.
1 King. 11.7. Moloch is styled the Abomination of Ammon, which v. 5. is styled
Milcom, etc. Lev. 18.21. Lev. 20.2,3,4,5. 2 Kings 23.10.
So Lev. 18.21. Lev. 20.2,3,4,5. 2 Kings 23.10. Amos 5.26. Act. 7.43.
Thus Amos 5.26. with the parallel, Act. 7.43. we find mention of the
Tabernacle of Moloch; where Iunius and Tremelius subjoin this exegetick Note:
You have ministered in show in the Tabernacle of the Living God; but you have
worshipped really Moloch, the God of the Ammonites, (which by your impiety you
have made yours) and other Gods of the Heathens, Synecdochically. This God of
the Ammonites the Prophet, in this place only, mentions, because the Ammonites
being their neighbors, he would more sharply strike at their Idolatry.
Tarnovius says, that the Affixe in (...) notes, that the Israelites framed an
Idol proper to themselves, according to the form of the Ammonitick Idol. See
more Glassius Gram S. lib. 4. Tract. 3. observe. 17. ( page 867. edit. 2a.) That
Moloch is the same with Baal or Belus, appears 1. from the parallel import of
the names: for as Baal ^ignifies Lord, so Moloch King. 2. We find them also
both joined in one word, Malech Belus, i.e. Lord King. 3. Their identitie is
farther evident from the image of Moloch; which consisted of 7 conclaves,
relating to the Sun, Moon, and 5. Planets; answerable to that of Baal. 4. Baal
and Moloch had also the same reference: for as Baal passed for the Sun and
Saturn, so Moloch. 5. Their Identitie is farther apparent from the samenes of
their worship. So Owen ( de Idololatr. lib. cap. 7.) That Moloch (says he) is
the same with Baal, seems to be evident from the samenes of their worship: for
they sacrificed also their sons to Baal and that in the valley of Hinnom, as
Jer. 7.31. etc. As for the worship performed to Moloch, we have a general
account thereof in the Scriptures above named; namely, that the Parents in
honor of this Idol God, were wont to traduce their children through the fire.
This Traduction, as Vossius ( de Idolo. lib. 2. cap. 5.) will have it, was not
a burning of them, but februation, i.e. purgation of them; or a certain kind of
expiation, wherein the children were led or drawn by the Priests, or parents,
through a space between two great fires, etc. This he conceives is the meaning
of all these Scriptures which mention their passing through the fire, not their
combustion. Though he denies not, but that, besides this kind of Februation,
there were also expiations made by burning of persons in times of calamity,
etc. This explication of that Learned man seems not to answer fully the mind
and import of those Scriptures, which mention the sacrificing their children to
Moloch: Ps. 106.37.38.
for Psalm. 106.37,38. it is said, they sacrificed their sons and daughters to
Devils, and shed iunocent blood, the blood of their sons etc. Adramelech and
Anamelech.
Unto Moloch we may refer the Gods of Sepharvajim, Adramelech, and Anamelech;
to whom also they burned their sons, 2 King. 17.31.
as 2 King. 17.31. Adramelech, from (...), signifies the great and valiant
Moloch, or King. (...) Addir is an attribute given unto God, which signifies
properly potent, valiant, great, excellent, as Psalm. 93 4. Anamelech imports
the oracle, or answer of Moloch: for (...) implies an answer. Or else it may be
derived from the Arabic (...), which signifies rich, as Voss. lib. 2. c. 5.
Bochart ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 28. fol. 584.) tells us, that Adranus is the name of
a Syrian or Phenician God, as the Compound Adra-melech, 2 King. 17.31. which
Idol, some of the Hebrews make to have the effigies of a Mule, others of a
Peacock. This Adramelech signifies a magnifick King, etc. I shall conclude this
of Moloch, with that account I find of him in Bochart, ( Can. lib. 1. cap. 28.
fol. 528.) Tophet, amongst the Hebrews, is (...) the fire of Gehinnom, i.e. the
valley of Hinnom, or Hell, Job. 17.6. Esa. 30.33.
as they take it Job. 17.6. and Esa. 30.33. the translation being taken from
the valley of Tophet, which is also Gehinnom; in which they were wont to cast
their children alive into the fire, in honor of their Idol Moloch, 2 King.
23.10. Jer. 7.31,32.
as 2 King. 23.10. and Jer. 7.31.32. which custom the Phenicians usurped
before Moses's time; as it appears Levit. 18.21. Deuteronomy. 18.10. and the
Carthaginians retained this impious superstition even unto Hannibal's time.
Thus Bochart.

. 5. The Samothracian Cabiri, Phenician Gods.
Amongst the Phenician Gods we may reckon the four Samothracian Gods, The
Samothracian Cabiri Phenician Gods.
called Cabiri, which, though worshipped in Samothrace, yet were they of
Phenician origination, and extract, as 'twill appear by the consideration of
particulars. We have a good general account of these Cabiri in the ancient
Scholiast on Apollonius Argonautic (...) 1, Thus, (...) They worshipped in
Samothrace, the Cabiri, whose names are mentioned by Muaseas. They are in
number four, Axieros, Axiokersa, Axiokersos, Kasmilos. Axieros truly is Ceres;
Axiekersa Proserpine; Axiekersos, Pluto, or Ades; and the fourth, Casmilus, is
Mercury; as Dionysodorus relates their names. Thus the Scholiast. That these
Cabiri were of Phenician extract, is evident by what we find of them in the
fragments of Philo Byblius, taken out of Sanchoniathon, as Eusebius praepar.
lib. 1. (...) from Sydyk sprang the Dioscuri or Cabiri. Sydyk or Sadyk from
Saddik Gods name.
We find the like mentioned by Damascius, in Photius: (...) Sadyk begat
children which, they interpret Dioscuri and Cabiri. First Sydyk or Sadyk was a
Phenician God, yea their chiefest God, answering to the Grecian Jupiter, and no
other than a Satanick Ape of the sacred name (...) Saddik, attributed to the
true God of Israel, Psalm. 119.137.
as Psalm. 119.137. and else where. And as the parent Sadyk, so all his children
called Cabiri, were also of Phenician and Hebrew extract. This is excellently
well demonstrated by Bochart, Can lib. 1. cap. 12. fol. 426. where he asserts
that the Cabiri, from (...) Great, were Phenician Gods worshipped chiefly at
Berytum: and all the Samothracian Cabiri were of Phenician origination, as
their names import. Cabbir.
The same Bochart ( Can. lib. 2. cap. 2. fol. 784.) on these words of
Sanchoniathon [(...)] affirms, that the (...) Cabbirim were the Great and
potent Phenician Gods, as the word imports. This will be put out of doubt by an
examen of the particulars. Axieros Ceres.
The first of these Cabiri, as mentioned by the Scholiast on Apollonius, is
(...), whom he interprets Ceres: and so indeed the Phenician signifies
(according to Bocharts Origination) the God of the Earth: for Axieros amongst
the Phenicians sounds (...) Achazi-eres, i.e. the Earth is my possession or
Dominion; which was Ceres her title. Axiokersa Proserpine.
Thence follows Axiokersa and Axiokersos which differ only in gender and
termination, and are by the Scholiast attributed to Proserpine and Pluto,
whereunto they answer according to the Phenician Origination: for (...) keres
signifies destruction and death, as in Jer. 46.20. Axickersos Pluto.
and so (...) Achazi Keres, death is my dominion or possession, according to
the Hebrew character of the Devil, Heb. 2.14. whom the Grecians called (...),
from (...) the Earth, and the Phenicians (...) Muth, Death, and the Latins
Pluto: as before chap. 4.. 5. Casmilus Mercury,
Lastly (...) Casmilus, or Cadmilus, another of the Phenician Cabiri, is the
same with (...) Chadmel, which signifies the minister of God, proportionable to
Mercuries name, who passed for the Minister of the Gods. So Bochart ( Can. lib.
1. cap. 12. fol. 429.) Chadmel (says he) Mercury is changed into Cadmilus,
because the Phenician (...) is by the Greeks rendered (...), whence, in the
Phenician Theology, (...) is the same with (...); namely Saturn is callel
(...) el, thence (...), as in Damascius. Yea Bochart, in the same place proves,
that the very Priest of these Cabiri, called by the Greeks (...) or (...), as
Hesychius, (...), was of Hebrew origination; Coes from (...) Coen.
for (...) Coes is the same with the Hebrew (...) Coen a Priest: It being usual
with the Greeks, from Hebrew words ending in N, to form their Accusatives; as
from Jonathan (...).

. 6. Of Esun his Thcogonie, or Genealogic, and Attributes from sacred n^es and
stories.
Hence there follows, in Sanchoniathon's (...) or description of the Phenician
Gods, another Generation of Gods called Eliun, etc. Philo Byblius words are
these (...), According to these is generated Eliun, called the most High. The
Greek (...) Eliun is exactly the same with the Hebrew (...) Elion, a name in a
peculiar manner attributed to God, signifying the Most High; and so indeed
Philo explicates his name, calling him (...), the Most High. This God Eliun had
for his wife (...), i.e. in the Phenieian and Hebrew (...) berith, a covenant.
Beruth, her Theogonie Judge. 8.33.
We find mention of this Goddess Judge. 8.33. Baal-Berith their God: which, as
it seems probable, had its original from a satanick imitation, of Gods entering
into covenant with Abraham; whence he was styled a God of, or in covenant: And
hence the Devil (who affected nothing more than to be an Ape of the Great God)
would needs assume the same style of (...), in the Phenician (...) Elion
Berith, the Most High of (or in) Covenant: which is rendered Jud. 8.33. Baal
Berith, as in what precedes, C. 1.. 3. The Carthaginians (who were but a branch
of the Phenicians, as the name Poeni imports) make use of the same Title to
express their supreme Gods by; Plautus's Paenulus,
as it is evident by Plautus's Paenulus: (which is the greatest Relic we have
of the Punick Language) in the beginning whereof we find these words: N'yth
alonim Valonuth: which Scaliger, in his Appendix to Emendat. Temporum; and
Bochart Canaan lib. 2. cap. 6. (...). 801. thus explicate (...) I worship the
Gods and Goddesses. (...) is a particle of asking, (...) a note following the
Accusative case. The reason, says Bochart, why I explicate alonim Valonuth the
Gods and Goddesses, is given us by Scaliger. (...) is the name of God amongst
the Phenicians (as Philo Byblius teaches us) who style each of their heavenly
Host by this name, as in Plautus's Paenulus; and Sisensa on that place has
noted, that Alon, in the punick Tongue, is God: The Theogonie of Uranus
Hebraick.
Philo Byblius proceeds to show, how that this (...) Eliun, called the most
High, lived near Byblus, and begat (...); whence the Heaven was called by this
name (...) Uranus. That this whole fable of Eliun's begetting Uranus, is but a
Satanick imitation of Genesis 14.19.22. is excellently demonstrated by Bochart
Can. lib. 2. cap. 2. fol. 784. That Eliun is said to generate Heaven is (says
he) taken from Moses's words, Genesis 14.19.22.
Genesis 14.19.22. (...) The most High God generator of the Heavens, For (...)
signifies also to generate, as the LXX render it Zach. 13.5. (...): and so it
ought to be rendered, Genesis 4.1. I have begotten. (...) Elion is the same with
Philo's (...): only for the Hebrew (...), Philo puts (...); which is of the
same import, signifying Heaven, as also of Hebrew origination from (...) or
light, whence (...) and (...) Heaven, as before, C. 1.. 3. Philo adds that
this Eliun or most High engaging with beasts, perished, but was by his
Posterity adscribed to the Gods (...) whom his Posterity worship with drink
offerings and sacrifices. This part of the fable seems to refer to Adam, and
Eve their engaging in conference with the serpent, and fall thereupon, who were
notwithstanding reputed and worshipped as Gods, by their Idolatrous posterity.

. 7. The genealogy of Ilus from El Gods name.
After Eliun, and his Son Uranus, there follows, according to Sanchoniathons
(...), the sons of Vranus or Heaven, which are Ilus, Baetylus, Dagon, Atlas.
The first borne of Vranus was (as before chap. 1.. 3.) Ilus. Genesis 14.19.22.
So Philo Byblius (...). Ilus who also was Saturn. (...) is evidently the same
with (...) El, a proper name of God. For what the Phenicians and Hebrews write
(...) El, the Greeks usually write (...), Ilos. So the Phenician (...) Chadmel,
the minister of God, or Mercury, the Greeks render (...) Cadmilos, as before.
And that Sanchoniathon writ (...) El, according to the Hebrew, not (...) Ilos,
(which was added by Philo Byblius) is evident by what we find mentioned, by
Photius 262 out of Damascius; (...): The Phenicians and Syrians call Saturn
El, and Bell, and Bolathes. Where (...) is perfectly the same with (...) the
strong or mighty God: and Genesis 14.19.20. We find (...) El joined with (...)
Elion. From the Phenician (...) and (...) El, or hell came (as our English Hell,
so) the Greek (...) the Sun, which generally passed amongst the Phenicians for
Saturn their chiefest God; as elsewhere. Hence also the Sun was worshipped, at
Emesa in Phenicia, under the Title of (...) or Heliogabalus. Heliogabalus.
So Herodian lib. 5. (...), This the natives worship, calling him, in the
Phenician tongue, Elagabalus. Some give this Elaeagabalus a Greek origination,
and so make it to signify the sun of the Gabalites. But Bochart, on more
grounded reasons, gives it a Phenician Origin from (...) Elagabal, which in
Greek signifies, (...), or (...), God the fictor or Creator: which the Hebrews
express by (...), God who created all things; and the Arabians by (...)
algabil, God the maker. Namely, the Phenician Philosophers Sanchoniathon Mochus
etc. persuaded themselves, that the Sun was the great Architect or framer of
all things: whence Porphyrie calls the Sun, (...) the creator of the world. This
is a paraphrase on the Phenician name Elaeagabalus, or Heliogabalus, which was
not of Greek but Phenician origination: For the Emissenes, amongst whom the
worship of this God flourished, had nothing to do with the Gabalites. By all
which it appears that (...) and (...) were all traduced from (...) El Gods
sacred name. The Phenician Elohim.
Hence it follows in Philo Byblius, (...), The companions of Ilus, i.e.
Saturn, are called Eloeim, that is to say, Chronies or Saturnians. As Ilus
comes from (...) El or (...) Eloah, so (...) from (...) Elohim Gods name, which
is applied also to Angels and Judges.

. 8. The Phenician Baetylia from Bethel. Genesis 28.18.
Hence follows another Product of Uranus, called Baetylus, or Baetylion. So
Philo Byblius out of Sanchoniathon, (...), The God Vranus excogitated Baetylia,
having fashioned them into living stones. Bochart ( Can. lib. 2. cap. 2. fo.
785) conceives, that Sanchoniathon, for living stones, writ (...) anointed
stones, from the radix (...), which amongst the Syrians signifies to anoint;
but, (...) and (...) being transposed, for (...), Philo Byblius read (...);
whence he changed anointed into living stones. How these Baetylia came to be
Theogonized or made Gods.
And it is not improbable, but that the Devil might have an hand in this
transmutation, thereby to infuse a principle of Idolatry into the credulous
people; persuading them, that these Stones were indeed living. So Damascius
tells us, (...), I saw a Baetulus moved in the Air. As for the original of these
Baetylia, or Baetyli, it is made very probable by the learned Jo: Scaliger,
Bochart, and Owen, that they had their original, by an hel-bred imitation, from
Genesis 28.18,19. and Genesis 31.13. the stone which Jacob erected, as a memorial of
Gods apparition to him; whence he called the name of the place Bethel, the
house of God: and thence the Phenician Baetylia, or Baetyli. Thus Bochart Can.
lib. 2. cap. 2. f. 785. Sanchoniathon called the Baetylia, anointed stones:
which sprang from the example of Jacob, Genesis 28.18.19.
who Genesis 28.18. called the place Bethel etc. Genesis 31.13.
which God confirms Genesis 31.13. The Phenicians therefore imitating this, first
worshipped this very stone, which the Patriarch anointed. So Scaliger in Eusebius.
( fol. 198. edit. 1a.) tells us, that the Jews relate so much; namely, that
although that Cippus (or stone) was at first beloved by God, in the times of
the Patriarchs, yet afterward he hated it, because the Cananites turned it
into an Idol. Neither did the Phenicians only worship this stone at Bethel,
but also, in imitation of this Rite, erected several other Baetylia, and that
on the very same occasion. For look as Jacob erected this pillar of stone, as a
memorial of God's Apparition to him; so in like manner the superstitious
Pagans, both Phenicians and Grecians, upon some imaginary (...) or Apparition
of some God, (or the Devil rather) would erect their Baetylia, or Pillars, in
commemoration of such an Apparition. So Photius, out of Damascius, tells us:
(...) etc. that near Heliopolis, in Syria, Asclepiades ascended the mountain of
Libanus, and saw many Baetylia or Baetyli, concerning which he relates many
miracles. He relates also, that these Baetylia were consecrated some to
Saturn, some to Jupiter, and some to others etc. So Phavorinus: (...):
Baetylus is a stone which stands at Heliopolis, near Libanus. This stone some
also call (...) stelae, which is the same word by which the LXX render Jacob's
pillar, Genesis 28.18. (...), where the LXX read it (...): so Lev. 20.21. Abaddir
the same with Baetylus.
Again, this Baetylus or Baetylion is by some called Abdir, Abadir, Abaddir. So
Priscianus lib. 5. Abadir is God: also that stone which Saturn devoured for
Jupiter, called by the Greeks Baetylus, has the same name given it. Bochart (
Can. lib. 2. cap. 2.) thinks this Abdir or Abaddir, to be derived from (...)
Ebin dir, which signifies a round stone: for such was the figure of the
Phenician Baetylia, as Damascius in Photius: The Baetylus was a globe exact and
round, of a whitish color, in length the Diameter of a span; but it appeared
sometimes greater; sometimes lesser, sometimes also of a purple color. Or else
Abaddir may be the same with the Hebrew (...) Ab-addir, the magnifick father;
by which name the Phenicians called their Gods, as Austin Epist. 44. All which
laid together gives us evident notices, that this Baetylus (the product or
issue of Uranus) was but a corrupt Ape of Jacob's Bethel, Genesis 28.18. etc. See
more of this in Owen de Idololatr. lib. 3. cap. 8. page 224. Also Bochart Can.
lib. 2. cap. 2. and Stillingf. Orig. S. book 3. cap. 5. sect. 10.

. 9. The Theogonie of Dagon.
We find mention also in Sanchoniathon, of Dagon, (...), Dagon who is Siton: so
in what follows, (...): Dagon, because he found out bread-corne and husbandry,
is called Jupiter the Husbandman: whence Dagon is referred to (...) bread
corn, as Bochart. We find frequent mention of this God in Scripture, 1 Samuel
5.1.
as 1 Samuel 5.1. etc. There were several other Phenician Gods (already
mentioned,) which had an Hebrew extract. Taautus.
As Taautus, the same with Canaan and Mercury, of whom see chap. 4.. 4. (...)
Muth.
Muth, the same with Pluto; as chap. 4.. 5. Astarte.
Astarte, or Ashtaroth, the same with Juno: chap. 2.. 4. Baaltis.
Baaltis, the Queen of Heaven: Jer. 7.18. as chap 2.. 7. Melcarthus.
Melcarthus, the same with Hercules: chap. 5.. 4. Azizus.
Azizus, Mars: c. 5.. 5. Chrysor.
Chrysor, from (...), the same with Vulcan, or Tubalcain: chap. 6.. 1. of this
book.

. 10. The Egyptian Gods, their Theogonie of Hebrew original.
Having gone through the genealogies of the Phenician Gods, we now proceed to
the Egyptian; wherein we doubt not but to give evident notices of their Hebrew
origination. Bochart, in a conference, assured me, that none of the Egyptian
Gods were more ancient than the Patriarchs, Joseph, etc.

1. Apis, a symbol of Joseph; which is proved by 3 particulars.
I shall begin with Apis, which seems apparently a symbol of the Patriarch
Joseph; as Vossius ( de Idololatr. lib. 1. cap. 29.) has well demonstrated. So
Julius Maternus, and Ruffinus lib. 2. Histor. Eccles. cap. 23. Also Suidas, in
(...), tells us, that Apis was a symbol of Joseph, etc. Vossius makes this
probable, 1. From the greatness of the benefits, which the Egyptians received
from Joseph, which no symbol was so apt to express as the Egyptian Apis, made
in the form of a bullock; and so resembling the fat and lean Kine: yea, we
find the spirit of God Deuteronomy. 33.17. comparing Joseph to a bullock. So Sandford
de descensu Christi l 1.. 19. Joseph also is Apis, who, for the supply of
bread corn afforded to the Egyptians, was worshipped under the form of an
Ox, (so that none may wonder he is mentioned in Scripture under the form of
an Ox, Deuteronomy 33.17.
Deuteronomy. 33.17.) according to which resemblance also Minucius, in times past, the
Prefect of Provision at Rome, was in very like manner honored with the form of
a golden Ox, or Bull. 2. The same is demonstrated from the great reverence and
esteem Pharaoh and the Egyptians had for Joseph; who received from them, whilst
alive, the greatest symbols of honor that might be. Pharaoh made him keeper of
his Seal; clothed him with a princely Robe and chain of Gold; called him
Saphenath paneah, i.e. according to Onkelos and Jonathan, the Interpreter of
secrets; and lastly made him High Steward of Egypt. Neither can we suppose, but
that he, who was so greatly honored by them whilst living, had also as great
honor after his death; especially if we consider, that it was the mode of the
Egyptians to preserve the memories of their noble Benefactors, by some
significative Hieroglyphics, or Symbols; which, though at first were intended
for civil commemoration only, yet were afterward abused to Idolatry. Thus
Suidas (in Sarapis) tells us, that Apis being dead, had a Temple built for him,
wherein was nourished a Bullock, the symbol of an Husbandman. 3. The same may
be evinced from the very names Apis and Serapis. Apis, from (...), Genesis 45.8.
For Apis seems evidently a derivative from (...) ab, a Father, as Joseph
styles himself Genesis 45.8. (...) for a father to Pharaoh: whence Vossius
inclines to think, that acclammation (...) abrech, which Pharaoh commanded to
be made before Joseph, had its rise: for Onkelos makes it a compound of (...)
ab, a father, and (...) rech, rex, a King. Serapis, the same with Apis.
As for Serapis, it was the same with Apis, and also a symbol of Joseph: which
Vossius collects from this. 1. That it had a Bushel on its head; as a symbol of
Ioseph's providing Corn for the Egyptians. So Suidas in (...). 2. From the
Etymon of Serapis; which is derived either from (...) an Ox, or from (...)
sor, a prince, and Apis: both of which are applicable to Joseph, etc.

2. Osiris, the same with Moses.
Next follows Osiris, who by the best conjectures we can make, seems to be the
same with Moses. For 1. Diodorus tells us, that Osiris was called by the Greeks
(...), the name of Bacchus, i.e. (...) Jupiter's son, and (...) Nysa, a place
in Arabia, where Moses was; as before chap. 3.. 3. 2. The body of Osiris was
said to be buried in an Island of Nilus: as Moses was cast into the river. 3.
Diodorus tells us, that Hercules was the chief Captain of Osiris's army: that
Joshua was Hercules, who accompanied Moses out of Egypt, and commanded the
Israelites in their military exploits, we have before proved chap. 5.. 3. 4.
Again, Diodorus says, that Osiris had in his army (...) Anubis, covered over
with a dogs skin; which thence was pictured with a dogs head, and called (...)
the dog-keeper etc. All which seems to refer to Calcb's name, which signifies a
dog, etc. 5. Farther, Pan is said to war under Osiris. By Pan is meant the
Jewish Messiah, who was the Shepherd of Israel, and led them in the wilderness,
as before chap. 6.. 5. etc. 6. Lastly, Osiris is said to have Horns etc. from
the mistake of Moses's character, who is thence pictured with horns. Osiris,
the same with Joseph.
Sandford de descensu Christil. 1.. 18. makes Osiris the same with Joseph.
Moses (says he) with the Princes of the Tribes, carried up the bones of Joseph
unto Canaan; hence the Poets fable of Osiris's bones etc. For Joseph was that
old Osiris, whom Pan nourished, whom I conjecture to be Israel. Osiris,
considered Physically, was the Sun, as hereafter c. 8. 9. Of Osiris see more
Vossius de Idololatr. l. 1. cap. 30. where he makes a threefold Osiris, the 1.
Egyptian, the same with Mitsraim: the 2. Theban: the 3. Arabian, the same with
Bacchus, and so with Moses, as before chap. 3.. 3. But Plutarch and Diodorus
seem to make the Egyptian Osiris the same with the Arabian. So Nonnus
Dionysiacon 4o. (...), and of Osiris the Egyptian Bacchus etc. Osiris, the
same with Adam, as Isis the samewith Eve.
Otherwise, we may make Osiris the same with Adam, and so his wife Isis the
same with Eve; from Ischa, which in Hebrew signifies a wife, as Vossius de
Idol. lib. 1. cap. 3.8. Isis vera Gentilium Mosis matter est. Sanf. l. 1.. 18.
Sandford de descensu l. 1.. 18. makes Isis to be the same with Moses's Mother,
as before c. 3.. 3. See more of Isis chap. 2.. 5. of June: and of Osiris chap.
8.. 9.

3. Mnevis, a sacred Bull at Heliopolis.
Another of the Egyptian Gods was called Mnevis, a sacred bull, worshipped at
Heliopolis. So Plutarch. lib. de Iside and Osiride: (...): The Bull, which is
nourished at Heliopolis, called Mnevis, ( which is sacred to Osiris, and, as
some think, the father of Apis) is black, and next in honor after Apis. Vossius
( Idol. lib. 1. cap. 29.) supposes Mnevis and Apis two distinct sacred bulls,
whereof Apis was worshipped at Memphis, and Mnevis at Heliopolis. Albeit we
allow them to be distinct, as to the seat of their worship, and some Rites;
yet, I conceive, we may grant them to have the same original Idea and
platform; namely Joseph, who was worshipped by them of Memphis under the form
of Apis, and by them of Heliopolis under the symbol of Mnevis. Vossius de Idol.
lib. 1. cap. 27. makes Mnevis a symbol of Menas, the first Egyptian King, whom
Herodotus calls (...) Men; whence the German and our English, Man, which refers
to Adam, as before chapter 4.. 4. Mnevis confidered physically, was a symbol of the
Sun: as c. 8.. 4.

4. Aaron, frater Mosis; verus Gentilium Orus est, frater Osiridis. Sand. des.
l. 1.. 19.
Another Egyptian God was Orus, who, taken historically, is supposed to be
Aaron; but if we consider him physically, so he is the same with the Sun, from
(...) Or, the Sun, or light, as chap. 8.. 9.

5. That Remphan Act. 7.43. was an Egyptian God, and the same with (...) Cijun,
Amos 5.26. as also with Saturn, see what precedes chap. 2.. 8.

6. Aegyptiorum Dii qui apud Poetas celebrantur, populorum Israeliticoru^
duodecim tribus sunt. Sand. desc. l. 1.. 20.
The Poets fable, that the Gods, who fought against the Giants, came out of
Egypt etc. This some refer to the twelve Tribes of the Israelites, that came
out of Egypt under the conduct of Moses etc. Thus Sandf. Descens. l. 1.. 20.
The fables agree, that the Gods, with whom the Giants fought, came out of
Egypt: these were the twelve Tribes. They constitute father Bacchus the General
of the whole Army: this is Moses, etc. The same is more largely asserted by
Dickinson, Delph. Phoeniciz. c. 2. of which see B. 3. c. 8.. 1.

. 11. The Metamorphoses of the Egyptian Gods.
I shall conclude this discourse of the Pagan (...), or genealogy of their
Gods, with an ingenious observation of Bochart, in Histor. de Animal. sacris,
part. 2. lib. 1. cap. 10. fol. 62. wherein he gives us the original of the
fabulous Metamorphoses of the Gods in Egypt, drawn from Hebrew paranomasies.
The Egyptians (says he) fable, that Isis was changed into a Swallow; because
Isis openly alludes to (...) Sis, a Swallow. And the fabulous metamorphoses of
Gods do often depend on the allusion of words. So Anubis was feigned with a
dogs head; because (...) Nobeach signifies barking. And the King Apis is
worshipped in an Ox, in allusion to (...), whereby the Hebrews express an
Ox. Thence the LXX read Jerem. 46.15. (...) for (...), as they would express
it for (...). And in the Giants war, the Gods, for fear of the Giants flying
into Egypt, changed themselves into diverse shapes, Ovid lib. 5. Metamorph. Dux
gregis dixit fis Jupiter-Lybiis esset cum cornubus Hammon. Jupiter, the
chiefest God is turned into a Ram; because (...), God's name, and (...) ajil, a
ram, are paronymous; and the plural of both is (...). Bacchus, called by the
Egyptians Osiris, is changed into a goat; because (...) Seir, which signifies a
goat, alludes to Osiris, Juno assumes the figure of a bullock; because (...)
Ashtaroth, whereby Juno was called, (also Astarte) signifies an herd of
Bullocks, etc. Thus Bochart. Whereby we see what a world of fables were coined,
touching the Gods their genealogies, and metamorphoses; and all from mistakes
of Jewish words, stories, or mysteries.

. 12. Thus we have dispatched the first part of Pagan Theology, called
Mythologie, or the fabulous genealogies of the Gods: wherein we have given very
probable, if not scientifick notices, that their chiefest Names, Attributes,
and Offices were assumed in imitation of, and dertvation from some Hebrew
names, Attributes, Persons, and Traditions. Whereof we have the sum in
Sandford, de descensu Christi l. 1.. 6. to the 25. where he first lays down
this conclusion, That the names of the Grecian Gods were of Hebrew origination:
and then, having shown how the Grecians formed and shaped their assumed Deities
out of Hebrew names, and stories, he proceeds to particulars; and demonstrates,
that (...) was traduced from (...) El, (...) Elohim,. 7. as from (...) di or
dai in Shaddai, (...), Jupiter's name:. 8. From (...) Iehova, (...), Iaoth,
Ieje, Heje; as also (...) in Jupiter, Jove, Euvios, etc. were traduced:. 10.
11. 12. 13. From (...) Sabbath, (...), etc.. 14. From (...) Adonai, (...)
Adonis:. 15. Also (...) Phoebus, as the American Hiob, from Jehovah. Lastly,
that (...) Iacchus was derived from (...) Iah, or Iehova; as in like manner all
the sacreds of Bacchus from the History of Moses, the same Sandford proves at
large. 17. 18. 19. The like he proves of Hercules, whose Theogonie he derives
from Joshua:. 20. 21. See more of this in what precedes chap. 6.. 10. of this
Book. As for the causes of this Mythologick Theology, they may briefly be
reduced to these heads. 1. One great spring of this Mythologick Theology, was
the ambiguitie and equivocation of the Hebrew words, wherein these oriental
Traditions were first delivered. This made the Grecians, unskilled in the
Hebrew Idiom, very apt to mistake things. 2. The sublimenes of the matters or
mysteries, unto which these fables related, gave a great occasion to their
original. 3. The imperfection of the Tradition; which was conveyed in a very
broken and mangled manner, especially to the Grecians, etc. 4. An affected
humor in Mythologists, inclining them to attribute the Attributes or Actions of
several persons to one chief, or of one to several; hence many Jupiters. 5. But
the main prolifick principle of Theologick Mythologie was a vain humor of
imitation, which possessed the Grecians, and led them to coin Fables; as
hereafter.

. 1. The distribution of Theology into Fabulous, Natural and Civil.
PAgan Theology, as we formerly hinted, was anciently distributed into (...),
1. Mythick; which sprang from the Poets figments. 2. Physic; which resulted
from the Mysteries of Nature, and man's corrupt contemplations thereon. 3.
Politik or civil; which owes its original to the Institutes of Legislators, and
the Idolatrous inclinations of the People. The first that gave this
distinction, was Q. Mutius Scaevola, the son of Publius, whom Tullie calls the
Pontifex. So August. de Civit. lib. 4. c. 37. It is related (says he) that
Scaevola, the most learned Priest, disputed of the three kinds of Theology;
the first from the Poets; the second from the Philosophers; the third from the
Princes of Cities. The first he says was Nugatorie etc. Terentius Varro
followed Scaevola herein, as August. de civit. Dei lib. 4. cap 4. There are
three kinds of Theology; the first is called Mythick or fabulous; used by the
Poets: another Physic; which the Philosophers used: a third Civil, in use
amongst the People. The First is accommodated to the Theater; the Second to the
Universe; the third to the City. thus Varro. The Poetic was accounted by the
more wise Heathens, Scaevola, Varro, etc. most fabulous and absurd: the Civil
was preferred before the Poetic; yet not approved by the forenamed Varro and
Scoevola; because 'twas mixed with many falsehoods and things unbeseeming the
Gods. The Physic Theology was that which the wiser Pagans, especially the
Philosophers, approved and commended.

We have treated at large of the Poetic or fabulous Theology, in the Seven
foregoing Chapters; wherein we have explicated the (...), or fabulous
Genealogies of the Pagan Gods, with, more than mere conjectural, proofs of
their Traduction from some Hebrew Names, Persons, Attributes, or Offices. We
shall now proceed to the Pagan (...) Natural Theology, with endeavors to
demonstrate its origination from sacred Oracles, or Operations.

. 2. Natural Theology most ancient; with its derivation from Divine Theology
demonstrated.
This Natural Theology was of all most ancient: for the Poetic or fabulous
Theology, was but an Allegorick Exposition of the Natural; as the New
Platonists will have it. Hence they make Jupiter to be the Sun, or Ether; and
Juno to be the Moon, or Earth, etc. As for the time when this Natural worship
was first assumed, we shall not be peremptory therein; but this, we no way
doubt but to prove, that it was taken up in imitation of, and derivation from
that Divine Worship, which was due to the true God, Creator of Heaven and
Earth. This we shall endeavor to demonstrate from the end, objects, authors,
and chief Seats of this Natural Theology.

1. From its End.
1. The chief end, for which this Natural Theology was at first instituted,
seems evidently no other than this, namely, a vain design or attempt to reduce
lapsed mankind to that pristine state of happiness, which it once enjoyed, by
virtue of the first covenant, and still retained some remote Physical capacity
of, and inclination unto. For, without all peradventure, these first Natural
Theologists, could not but receive some imperfect notices, or broken
Traditions, from their Ancestor Noah, concerning Adams happy State in
Innocence, his fall, and of the way of Redemption by a Savior; which comparing
with those (...), common Notions, engraven upon their Nature, made them
somewhat emulous of regaining that lost happiness: in order whereto, they
conceit this their Natural Theology, to be the most proper expedient. And that
this was the chief end thereof, will appear by what follows, concerning the
Object of Natural Theology.

. 3. 2. From the Object of Natural worship, which is 1. Supreme referring; to
some Planet, or the true God.
2. As for the Object of this Natural Theology, it was either ultimate and
supreme, or intermediate and next. The ultimate and supreme Object was, for the
most part, some Planetarie Deity, first the Sun alone; then the Moon, and
other Planets. Though I doubt not, but that the first Chaldean Philosophers, as
also the wiser Grecians, Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, etc. terminated their
Natural worship, ultimately on the true, eternal, infinite God; though they let
it pass through the hands of their Idol Demons, or false Mediators; of which
hereafter.

The Semi Gods or Demons.
2. The intermediate or next object of Natural Theology or worship, was some
Midling, made Gods; who had been originally some Heroes or Noble men; but after
death, by I know not what Satanick (...) or Consecration, were made (in
imitation of the Hebrew Immanuel) (...) God men, or Men-Gods, and Mediators
betwixt the supreme God and Men. These Mediators were styled, in the oriental
parts (...) Baalim; and by the Grecians (...) Demons. We find this distinction
excellently well explicated by Philo Byblius, who, in the Prologue of his work,
(as Eusebius. l. 1.) says, That the most ancient of the Nations, the Phenicians
and Egyptians, had, besides the Planetarie Deities, which he calls (...) Natural
Gods, also (...) mortal or Men-Gods: namely the souls of their great Heroes, or
Benefactors. For thus he speaks (...). The most ancient of the Barbarians,
especially the Phenicians and Egyptians, (from whom the rest of men received
this custom) esteemed as their supreme Gods, such as found, out or administered
things necessary to life, or in some regard afforded great benifit to Nations.
But those who were esteemed as Benefactors and Authors of many good things,
they worshipped as Gods, i.e. as made Gods or Mediators etc.

. 4. The First, Supreme natural God was the Sun: the original of his
Deification. Genesis 1.16. Gods delegated Dominion to the Sun communicated by
tradition.
I shall begin with the supreme natural God or Gods; and endeavor to
demonstrate his, or their Traduction from the True God Jehovah, his Names,
Attributes, Operations, or Oracles. The first great Natural God, the Idolatrous
sons of Noah began to Idolize, was the Sun. So Philo Byblius out of
Sanchoniathon, tells, that the Phenicians made the Sun their chief God: (...).
This they count the only Lord of Heaven, calling him Beelsamen, who with the
Phenicians, is Lord of Heaven i.e. Hebr. (...). The Assyrians styled him (...)
bell, and the Grecians (...) from (...) El, Gods Name. Thus Sandford de Descensu
Christi l. 1.. 7. where he speaks in these words, thus Englished: In the first
place, says he, (...) El, Gods name offers it self, also Elohim, and Elohe;
which differ so little, that (...) Helios seems to occupy all three. For
whence, I pray you, came Helios? the most learned confess, that it is not of
Greek origination. Some affirm that it is of Punick, others, that it is of
Assyrian Origin: both of which proves what we intend. For both Herodotus, when
he understands the Hebrews, calls them Phenicians; whose Tongue the Punicks
[Paeni ipsi quasi Phoeni, corrupto nomine appellati] so called from the
Phenicians, used: as also Tacitus affirms, that the Assyrians gave origin to
the Hebrews, and possessed their Country. Therefore they that make Helios an
Assyrian or Phenician name, confess also that it is Hebrew: which also the
Interpreter of Virgil ( Servius Aen. 1.646.) demonstrates from this argument;
because Helios is drawn from that Language wherein Hell, Hebr. (...), signifies
God. Now none can be ignorant, that in the sacred Scriptures Hael [Hebr. (...)]
is used for God, which the Greeks of old sounded Hell [Gr. (...)] as its confessed
by our Divines ( Theodor. contra Her. l. 5. c. de Spiritu. S. and Nicet.
Orthod. lib. 2. c. 29.) -- Which things standing thus; the Ancients ( Macrob.
Saturn. etc.) did, though darkly define, or limit the universal multitude of
the Gods by the Sun alone: and we less wonder at it, that this God (the Sun)
should traduce his name from the Prophetic Writings; seeing hence also he
seems to be furnished with his Chariot and four horses. For, that the Grecians
detorted Elias's fiery Chariot to make up this Fable, of the Sun's Chariot, is
affirmed by Chrysostomus Sermon. de Helia.

The original ground and spring of Idolizing the Sun seems this. First, God,
Genesis 1.16. bestows a delegated Dominion on the Sun, making it the Lord of the
day: so Psalm. 19.1,2,3, etc. And without doubt this delegated Dominion was, by
Sacred oral Tradition, handed down, throughout all Ages of the Church, by the
Holy Seed, until it was committed to the Holy Scripture by Moses. From this
Sacred Tradition, lodged in the bosom of the Church, we may safely grant, the
Apostate, sons of Noah, Cham, etc. received some notices and discoveries of
this Delegated Soveraigntie committed to the Sun; whence they, forgetting their
Creator, place the Sun, his creature, in his room; and so make it their Natural
God, and absolute Lord; calling it Baal, Beelsamen, Moloch, etc. titles which
import a Soveraigntie and Dominion, as Genesis 1.16.

2. The glorious structure and regular motion of the Sun caused it to be adored.
2. To this we may add, as another cause of the Suns being Deified, its
admirable composure, and motion; whereby the hearts of these Idolatrous Sons of
Noah were ravished, first into Admiration, and thence into Adoration of this so
glorious a creature. Indeed these Admirable perfections of the Sun, afford
excellent matter of Admiration and Contemplation to a gracious heart, that can
contemplate and admire the infinite perfections of his Creator, in this
glorious creature, as Psalm. 19.1,2. But an heart Idolatrically inclined, soon
loses the sense of its Maker, in such Illustrious and beautiful objects of
sense. Hence Plato, in his Cratylus, draws the origination of the name (...)
God, from (...) to run: because the course of the Sun (their supreme God) was
of all most rapid and swift, as Psalm. 19.5. Plato's own words we shall
hereafter mention. It may suffice at present to hint, that the swift and
orderly motion of the Sun, and other Planets, gave the first occasion of their
being so much admired and adored as Gods. This Lactantius lib. 2. cap. 24.
gives as the original cause of the Egyptian Idolatry. Seeing (says he) in
Egypt they could hardly contain themselves within doors, by reason of the
delicious constitution of their country, they spent whole nights in
contemplating those Celestial Bodies, moving in such a constant regular manner;
whence they insensibly fell into this persuasion, that the Stars were Gods, and
Conservators of the Universe, which therefore they worshipped with various
Rites and Ceremonies etc. 3. The Suns influence, another cause of its being
Idolized.
3. Another cause of the Suns being deifyed, was those sensible influences, and
effects, which flowed from him. Man naturally is apt to ascribe a Divinity to
what affords him relief and succor; especially if it be an universal Cause of
Good. Now the Sun having such a prolifick and powerful influence on all
sublunaries, and sensibles; no wonder if the corrupt imaginations of man's
foolish heart, attribute a Deity unto him, Romans 1.18,21.
as Romans 1.18,21. This was that which inveagled the Idolatrick Israelites into
a superstitious Adoration of these Planetarie Deities, Jer. 44.17.18.
Jerem. 44.17,18. for then had we plenty, etc. Therefore God checks them for
these Vanities, Jer. 14.22.
Jer. 14.22. and Paul, Act. 14.17. plainly indicates, that the Gentiles, from a
vain expectation of Succor from these Celestial bodies, were enticed into an
Adoration of them. Judicial Astrology.
And Judicial Astrology, which began to flourish amongst the Chaldeans and
Egyptians, even in the beginning of Idolatry, afforded a more powerful
influence to this Idolatrick deifying of the Sun. For these Judicial
Astrologers ascribed, almost all manner of influences and effects, both
Natural, Moral, and Divine, to these Celestial bodies; and then, no wonder, if
they pass for Gods. For if we grant the Hypothesis, which Judicial Astrologers
have to this very day contended for; That these Celestial Constellations and
bodies have an universal influence, not only on Natural bodies, but also on
Politic States, yea on the spirits of men, and that directly; this, I say,
being granted, I cannot see how we can rationally deny them a Deity.

4. The Suns refidence in Heaven a farther cause of its being Deified.
4. Another prolifick cause of the Suns being Deified, was his glorious
Residence in Heaven. There is, as it is observed, an innate persuasion in the
heart of man, that the proper Object of our worship resides in Heaven; whence
men naturally, on all occasions of Divine adoration, lift up their eyes to
Heaven, as Gods place of Residence. Now those Apostate sons of Noah, finding
nothing in Heaven more glorious than the Sun, conceit that the only object of
their Worship. That these were the genuine causes of that Natural worship and
Divinity, which the first Idolaters gave to the Sun, is evident from what we
find in Job. 31.26,27. Job. 31.26.27.
If I have seen the Sun etc. This good man treats here professedly, of that
Idolatrous worship given to the Sun; which in his Age (who lived about 450
years after the Dispersion) had gotten a great footing amongst those Idolaters.
And he gives us the chief springs and roots of this Idolatrick Deification of
the Sun and Moon; which were these.

1. An Eye pleasing contemplation of these Glorious Creatures, v. 26. If I
beheld the Sun when it shined etc. This is explained by Moses, Deuteronomy. 4.19.
Deuteronomy. 4.19. And lest thou should lift up thine eyes to heaven] whereby is
employed that an Idolatrick Contemplation of the Sun etc. was a main cause of
men's Idolizing of it. 2. Another cause is the hearts Admiration of, and
cleaving to these glorious objects. So Job 31.27. If mine heart did flatter me
in secret. The heart is the main fountain of Idolatry, Deuteronomy. 11.16.
as Deuteronomy. 11.16. beware lest your heart deceive you, and turn you aside to
other Gods: the heart is the great Idol-maker. Whence follows Adoration, which
formalizeth the Idol: so Job. 31.27. If my mouth did kiss mine hand; which was
a species of Adoration. Thus the contemplation of the Eye draws on the
Admiration, and affectionate inclination of the Heart; whence follows Adoration
and Deification of the Sun, etc. This was long ago well observed by Diodorus
Siculus, lib. 1. The most ancient Inhabitants of Egypt (says he) contemplating
the world above them, and the whole Universe, fell into a stupendous admiration
of the Sun and Moon, and esteemed them as eternal and first Gods: whence they
called the Sun Osiris, and the Moon Isis, etc. Thus we see, how first the Sun,
and then the Moon, and in after time the other Stars, came to have a Divinity
ascribed to them. We find this well set forth by Vossius, de Idol. lib. 2. cap.
5. As by little and little, mankind departed from the worship of the true God,
so in the same degrees (...) Polytheisme began insensibly to increase. First
Divine honor was given to the Sun; because there was nothing more conspicuous,
and more acceptable to our fenses than it. Next, the Moon seemed to gain the
same honor; which therefore was taken into a copartnership in worship. Hence
the same honor is communicated to the whole host of Heaven, and then to the
whole machine of Heaven. Afterward the like was attributed to the Elements,
and lastly to the whole Universe; because the whole was conceived to be of a
Divine nature. Mean while, as there is one nature of all things, so the more
wise directed their worship to one Deity etc. By which its apparent, that the
more judicious Philosophers (such as Pythagoras and Plato were) acknowledged
only one supreme and chief God; which some made to be the Sun, others the true
God, that first, infinite, eternal Being, which gave Being to all things;
according to the Scripture account of God his worship etc. as hereafter. See
more of the original of these Planetarie Deities in Owen, Theolog. lib. 3. cap.
4. who, I confess, has furnished me with much light herein. The Sun idolized
by the Jews.
Yea these glorious excellencies of the Sun, did not only inveagle the hearts
of poor Heathens into Idolatry, but also many of the carnal Jews were enticed
thereby. Joseph Scaliger, Trihaeres. cap. 27. tells us, that the Sun was
worshipped for a God by the Essenes in Judaea; and that which founded this
persuasion in him, is an expression in Philo the Jew (...), thus: (...). Twice
every day they (the Essenes) are wont to pray; morning, and evening: at the
rising of the Sun begging felicity, I say, true felicity; amely, that their
minds may be replenisht with heavenly light. That which adds to this
persuasion is a passage of Josephus, who, speaking of the Essenes, says, that
when they go to stool, having dug a pit, they sit thereon covered round with
their Cloaks, (...), lest they should injure the God of Light, i.e. the Sun.
Petavius, in his Notes on Epiphanius, follows Scaliger in this persuasion of
the Essenes worshipping the Sun, though C. Salmasius, Io: Croius, and G.
Vossius dissent.

. 5. The original of Demons, with their (...).
Having dispatched the supreme natural God, or Gods, which takes in the ultimate
object of Natural Theology and worship; we now proceeed to the (...), the
mortal or made Gods, which were intended as Mediators betwixt the supreme God
and mortal men. For these blind Heathens had so far a sense of their lapsed
estate, and distance from the supreme God, as that they conceive it too great
presumption, yea impossible for them to have communion with him, but by some
Mediators, or mediums of Worship. Whence they canonized, or instituted certain
midling Deities, and Semi Gods, which should be as Mediators and mediums
betwixt them and the supreme God, to transmit their Prayers and Sacrifices to
him, and his Precepts, Rewards and Influences to them. These made Gods and
mediums of worship were either Persons, or Things. The Persons were the souls
of some Heroes deceased, and canonized: the Things were Golumnes, Pillars,
Images, and at last whatever carried any thing of Divinity.

We shall begin with the Pagan Men-Gods, which were the first, and most
universally received Mediators or mediums of that Natural Worship, which the
Heathens performed to their supreme God or Gods. And here we doubt not but to
demonstrate, that these midling Men-Gods or Mediators, were taken up in
imitation of, and derivation from the Jewish Messiah, which was Immanuel and
(...), God man, or mediator betwixt God and men. The original of the Baalim and
Demons.
This we shall endeavor to make good both from their Names, Nature,
Institution, and Offices. 1 the origination of their names.
First as to their Names; these Men Gods were styled by the Phenicians (where
they seem to have had their original) (...) Baalim, Lords: which name was
originally sacred and peculiar to the true God of Israel, Hos. 2.16,17.
as it is evident from Hos. 2.16,17. And shall call me no more Baali, etc. They
were called by the Grecians (...), from the Hebrew (...) or (...), Princes, as
before, chap. 5.. 1. But the common name the Greeks gave them was (...),
Demons; because they had the knowledge and inspection of all human Affairs,
answerable to the character of the Jewish Messiah. The Romans called these
Demons, Semidei, half Gods, Medioxumi, midling Gods, and Deastri, star-Gods:
because they supposed their residence to be chiefly in some star: of which
elsewhere. 2 The orignal of their institution.
2. As for the original institution of these Baalim or Demons, Mede on 2 Pet.
2.1. ( Diatrib. 3. page 538.) proves at large, that the Baalim amongst the
Phenicians, were nothing else but the Souls of Great men deceased, deified, and
worshipped for Gods. For (says he) Baal, or Bell, a Phenician King, was after
his death Deified: whose worship Jezabel, the daughter of Ithobaal, King of
Tire, brought into Israel. Whence it is most probable, the Grecians received
their doctrine and worship of Demons. Rev. 9.20.
So Mede in clavis Apocalyp. on Rev. 9.20. discourses of these Demons, as the
same with those Baalim, styled also in Scripture the Host of Heaven, from Belus
a Phenician King etc. Though it is not improbable, that Belus the Phenician
King, might be so called from Baal, or Baalim, their Gods and Lords; and these
so called from Baal, God's name. That these Baalim, or Demon Gods, were none
other than the Souls of some Great Heroes deceased, is evident from Ps. 106.28.
Psalm. 106.28.
They joined themselves to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Hereby (says Deodati) is signified the origin of Idolatry, which began by
attributing divine Honor to persons deceased. Thales and Pythagoras seem the
first that brought these Demons to any exact Idea, form, or shape. It Is true,
the Poets Orpheus, Homer, and Hesiod brought some rude Ideas, or rather first
lines out of the Oriental parts, Egypt, etc. yet (as Plato well observes) they
made little distinction betwixt their Demons and superior Gods. But Thales and
Pythagoras, who conversed in Egypt, and dealt much in Jewish Traditions, paring
off many Poetic fables, and ridiculous Attributes applied to those Demons,
made them more Artificial and Philosophic Mediators. The mode of this Pagan
(...).
Plutarch gives us the mode how this Pagan (...) or Deification was
accomplished. We ought (says he) to judge, and firmly believe, that the souls
of virtuous men, according to Nature and Divine justice, become of holy men and
Saints, Demie-Gods; and of Demie-Gods, after they are perfectly (as in the
sacrifices of Purgation) purified, they become entire and perfect Gods.
Montaigne ( Essais live. 2. chap. 12.) gives it us more fully thus. See a little
this mode of ancient Deifications. After the grand and proud pomp of
Enterrement, when as the fire began to seize on the top of the Pyramide, and
the bed whereon the person deceased lay, they let fly, at the same time, an
Eagle, which flying aloft, signified, that his soul flew up to Heaven, whereof
we have a thousand Medailles etc. To this Pagan Deification of their Demons,
the Popish Canonization of their Saints exactly answers, as their Canonists
ingeniously confess; and both one and the other were but corrupt imitations of
the true Messiah, etc. as hereafter shall be proved.

3. The nature and condition of these Demons.
3. As for the nature and condition of these Demons, the Poets Orpheus, Homer,
and Hesiod discourse somewhat confusedly of them: but the Philosophers, who
were the chief Founders and Promotors of this (...) Demonlogie, treat more
distinctly of them. Thus Plutarch ( Placit. Philos. 1.8.) tells us, that Thales,
with Pythagoras, Plato, and the Stoics hold, that the Demons are spiritual
substances, of a middle nature and condition betwixt the Immortal Gods, and the
Heroes. This opinion Thales is supposed to have brought with him from Egypt
into Greece. For that the Egyptians held the same, is affirmed by Jamblichus de
myster. Egypt. But there is none that treats more accurately and amply of
these Demons, their nature, and quality, than Plato; who in his lib. 13. de
legib. calls them (...) begotten Gods, also (...) visible Gods. Again, he makes
them to be (...), Idols and Images of the supreme God, the Creator. Demons,
midling Gods.
And more fully in his Symposium, fol. 202. etc. he describes these Demons to
be of a middle nature, betwixt God and men: his words are (...) etc. Every
Demon is between God and man, being placed in the midst of both. He likewise
calls these Demons (...), the works of God; and (...), things made by God: and
sometimes he calls them (...) immortal. As for the quality and dignity of
these Demons, he says ( Politic. fol. 251.) (...), Demons are Co-rulers with
the greatest God. All which Platonic Contemplations exactly answer to the
Scriptures character of the true Messiah, who is said, in regard of his
Humanity, to be made, or begotten; also a visible Image of the invisible God;
(...), God Man, and Mediator betwixt God and man; also Co-ruler with God, etc.

4. The offices o these Demons answerable to those of the true Messiah.
4. Lastly, we have a very ample and exact account in Plato, concerning the
offices of these Demons; which fully answer to, and therefore, we may presume,
were originally traduced from the Scriptures account of Christ's offices. So
Plato, Symposium fol. 202. etc. After a discourse of the Nature of this Demon,
Socrates demands, (...), what faculty or power has this Demon? 1 Demons
transmit the worship of men to the Gods, and the rewards of the Gods to men.
Diotima replies: (...), (they have a faculty) to interpret and transmit the
Affairs of men to the Gods, and the Affairs of the Gods to men. Then he
proceeds to explicate, what these Affairs of men and the Gods were: (...), of
Men, the prayers and sacrifices; (...), but of the Gods, their Commands, and
Rewards for sacrifices. 2 Demons the Authors of Divination.
And hence taking occasion to open his mind more fully, he says, 2. that all
Divination proceeds from the conduct of these Demons. 3. Demons, mediators
betwixt the Gods and men in order to Communion.
3. That also by virtue of their Mediation, all Communion with the Gods is
transacted: (...) etc. God mixeth not with man, but by the mediation of this
Demon; by whom all communion and conference betwixt the Gods and men is
maintained. Wherein we have all the Offices of Christ explicated by Plato, and
applied to his Demon; which we cannot rationally imagine, could ever have
entered into his brain, without the assistance of some sacred Tradition.

The Pythagoreans held the same sentiments of these Demons; so also the
Stoics, as Laertius in Zeno: (...), they say also, there are certain Demons,
which have a sympathy with, or care of men. And as the Pagans took the Idea of
their (...) Demonologie from the Scriptures account of the true Messiah, so in
like manner the Papists received the original Idea of their (...) Saint
worship, from this Pagan Demonologie; as it is evident from 1 Timothy 4.1. (...),
doctrines of Demons: which is excellently opened and demonstrated by Mede on
this text, in a Treatise called, the Apostasy of the latter Times, from page
31. to 37. edit. 1. But more concerning the Traduction of Pagan Demons from the
true Messiah, in the following discourse of Pythagorean Philosophy.

. 6. Other mediums of Natnral worship.
Besides these Men-Gods, or Demons, the Pagans had many other mediums of
Worship, which were a kind of midling or representative Gods, interposing
betwixt them and the supreme God or Gods. 1 The Pagan Columns.
Amongst these we may reckon their sacred Columns, which the Greeks call (...)
Stelas: so the LXX on Lev. 26.1. Deuteronomy. 16.22. where they render (...) pillar,
by (...); which Kimchi makes to be a stone erected for prayer. Much of the same
import were the (...) Baetylia; which were at first only symbols of a Divine
presence, but afterward abused to superstition, and made Gods, as in the
former Chapter,. 8. Clemens Alexandrinus tells us, That these (...), or sacred
Columns, were invented in imitation of the pillar of Cloud, that went before
the Israelites in the wilderness. Certain it is, that the wiser of the Pagans
did not worship these Stones as supreme Gods, but at first only as
commemoratives of some Divine presence; and afterward as an Organ or Body,
which was informed and actuated by some Divine or rather Demoniack Spirit.

2 The Pagan (...).
2. Of the same import also were the Heathen (...), or Images artificially
composed, for the reception of some Divine spirit or Influence. For these poor
Heathens finding their supreme Gods, the Sun, Moon, etc. too remote and absent,
they conceit it necessary to have certain Images and Symbols, to represent and
receive the Influences of their absent Deities. This superstitious inclination
induced the Israelites to make a Calf, Exodus 32.1.
Exodus 32.1. Plotinus Ennead. 4. lib. 3. cap. 11. unfolds this whole mystery,
showing, that they esteemed not these Images or Pillars, simply and absolutely
as their chief God; but only as symbolick bodies, informed and influenced by
the soul of their God: as a Glass is informed by the Image or species that
falls upon it, of which elsewhere. Unto this Head also we may refer the numerous
multitude of Egyptian petty Deities; which were made, not the ultimate object
of their Adoration, but only mediums thereof. For finding, as they thought,
somewhat of Divinity in almost every Creature, they made it a medium of
adoring their supreme Gods. All these symbolick Images, sensible Forms, and
visible Representations, which the wiser Heathens used as natural Mediums of
that Devotion and Worship, they bestowed on their supreme God, seem to have
received their original Idea and derivation from those Symbolick Types and
shadows, which were appointed the Jewish Church, for the more solemn
Celebration of God's worship, as hereafter.

. 7. The original seats of Pagan Theology.
Having gone through the Objects of Natural Theology, with the original
grounds of their being Deified and Adored, we now proceed to a more full
Inquisition into the particular Places where this Pagan Theology first took
root, and whence it diffused it self into other parts; together with the Causes
thereof. We have before (. 4.) showed, that the ultimate and supreme Object of
this their Natural Theology was, amongst the first and most of the Pagans,
made to be the Sun; and that in Imitation of the true God, Creator of Heaven
and Earth, who inhabits the Heavens. The time when this Natural Theology began.
As for the Time when men began first to Idolize and adore the Sun, it cannot
be precisely determined: some fix the time about the Nativitie of Serug, 63
years after the Babylonian dispersion. But Owen ( de Idol. lib. 3. cap. 7. page
212.) conceives, that immediately after the Babylonian dispersion, the
Apostate seed, forsaking the worship of the true God, fell to adore the Sun.
And that which seems to confirm this persuasion is, that Nimrod, by the
Assyrians called Belus, the first that usurped temporal Monarchy and Dominion
over his brethren, whilst living and after his death, was Deified by them
under the name of Bell; which the wiser of them (...) applied to the Sun. That
the Deification and Adoration of the Sun was very ancient, is evident from
Moses, Deuteronomy. 4.19. and Job. 31.26,27.

The original seat of Pagan Theology not Egypt.
But to come more closely to our present substratum. The original seat or
place, where this Natural Theology began, is left somewhat uncertain by
Antiquity. Diodorus Siculus Biblioth. lib. 1.) makes the Egyptians the first
that led the dance to this superstitious Adoration of the Sun: who is followed
herein by Lactantius, and others. Chaldea the first seat of Natural Theology.
Yet I would, with submission, incline to think, that the Babylonians and
Chaldeans were the first, that broached this Natural Adoration of the Sun. And
that which confirms this opinion is, first Scripture evidence; as Rev. 17.5.
where Babylon is called the Mother of Harlots etc. i.e. says Mede, the first
Parent of Idols; for Babel, as she was the first seat of temporal Monarchy, so
also of Idolatry. This is farther evident from sacred Historical Observation;
which gives us an account of the mode, or manner how the Sun was at first
worshipped. Thus Job. 31.26,27. Job. 31.26,27.
If I have kissed my hand with my mouth etc. So 1 King. 19.18. Job. 31.26,27. 1
King. 19.18.
and every mouth which has not adored him, kissing the hand. These places refer
to the Gentiles mode of adoring the Sun, by lifting the right hand to their
mouth; of which there is frequent mention amongst Pagan Writers. So Apuleius
Apol. 1. for worship sake to move the hand to the lips. The same Tacitus
expresses, by worshipping with the hand; and Martial, by saluting with the
hand: which (says Vossius, de Idol. lib. 2. cap. 3.) was most ancient, and
perchance sprang from the manner of worshipping the Sun, in those first times,
especially at his rising etc. So Glassius, Grammat. S. lib. 4. Tract. 2.
Observe. 22. on Job. 31.27. (...) and my hand has kiss^d my mouth. The sense
is, If when I have seen the Sun and Moon, I moved mine hand to my mouth, by way
of worship. So Drusius lib. 1. Observe. cap. 20. where, out of Minutius felix in
Octavio, Apuleius apol. 1. Pliny lib. 28. cap. 2. he demonstrates this to be
an old Rite of Idolaters, that when they passed by any Temple, they moved their
hand, in reference to a kiss, whereby they worshipped their Idol God, etc. So
Mollerus in Psalm. 2.12. This (says he) was one kind of Idolatry: for seeing
men could not attain to kiss the Sun and Moon with their mouth, they extended
their hands to those Celestial bodies, and thence moving it back to their
mouth, they kissed it (in token of homage and worship). Now we know this Mode
of worshipping the rising Sun, was peculiar to the Chaldeans and Persians, at
leastin its primitive Institution. But more of this in what follows.

Genesis 11.28.31. Ur of Chaldea so styled from (...) Or the Sun, which was here
worshipped under the Symbol of fire.
Amongst the Assyrians, one chief Seat of this Natural worship given to the
Sun, was Vr of Chaldea, mentioned Genesis 11.28.31. so called from (...) or the
Sun, as he is styled Job. 31.26. For (...) Vr is evidently the same originally
with (...) the Sun: whence sprang the Egyptian (...) Orus, and the Greek (...),
and the Latin aurora; as from (...) Vr, the Greek (...), and the Latin Uro; of
which hereafter in the History of the Creation. This also suits exactly with
the wonted origination, which the Learned give of this Chaldean Ur; namely,
that it was so styled from (...) Ur, that sacred fire, which was worshipped
here; the Original whereof seems this. The Zabii, or Chaldean Philosophers,
supposed the Sun, their chief God, to be a globe of fire; whence they
worshipped fire as a symbol thereof; and so from the Suns name (...) Or, called
this City of Chaldea, where he was worshipped, (...) Ur, which signifies both
Light and Fire.

Thus Glassius ( Grammat. S. lib. 4. Tract. 3. observe. 6.) on Neh. 9.7. and I
brought him, (...), out of Ur of the Chaldeans. The vulgar Latin renders it,
from the fire of the Chaldeans; which elsewhere it translates, from Ur of the
Chaldeans, Genesis 11.31. etc. Ur is the name of a City, which the Greeks call
(...) and (...); wherein the sacred fire was (as it is conceived) conserved,
and worshipped by the Chaldeans; whence it was called Ur, which otherwise
signifies Fire. So For sterus in Lex, informs us, that Ur had its appellation
from fire; which the Chaldeans worshipped as a God: for when they saw, in times
past, fire descending from Heaven, and consuming the Sacrifices of the
Patriarchs, they supposed it to be a God. Thus Forsterus. Though I conceive
(with submission) that the main reason they worshipped fire as a God, was;
because they supposed the Sun, their chief God, to be a Globe of Fire, as
hereafter B. 3. C. 3. 9.

Nimrod the first institutor of sacred fire, as a Symbol of the Sun.
As for the first Institution of this sacred fire, they refer it to Nimrod: so
the writer of the Alexandr: Chronicon page 64. (...). The Assyrians surname
Nimrod Ninus, This man taught the Assyrians to worship fire. In this City of
Ur, where this sacred fire was worshipped, as a symbol of the Sun, Haran
Abraham's brother died, as Genesis 11.28. And it is conjectured Abraham himself was
borne here: from whence he went forth as Genesis 11.31. being called to the foot
of God. So Esa. 41.2. called him to his foot, i.e. God called him to leave his
Idolatrous kindred, and to follow his conduct to the promised land.

The Sun worshipped under Bell from (...) El, thence (...).
The chief names under which the Sun was worshipped amongst the Assyrians were
first Belus or Bell: which some derive from (...) baal a Lord; others, and that
more properly, from (...) bell (without (...)) and this from (...) El, Gods
name: whence the Greek (...) the Sun. Thus Servius and Sandford, as before. 4.
so Esa. 46.1. Esa 46.1.
Bell is broken down. That by Bell here is meant the Sun, Vossius asserts. It Is
true; if we take it (...) historically, it may be applied to Nimrod; who passed
amongst the Chaldeans under the name of Bell or Belus; but if we take it (...)
Physically, for their first supreme God, so it implies the Sun, as Vossius
Idol. lib. 2. cap. 6. Hence Pliny, lib. 37. cap. 10. makes mention of a
certain precious stone consecrated to the God of the Assyrians, called the eye
of Belus; by reason of its resemblance to the Sun. Now this name Bell, whether
we draw it from (...) Baal Lord, or from (...) El God, it is evidently no other
than a corrupt imitation of some sacred name of God.

2. The Sun called Adad.
2. The Sun was also called by the Assyrians Adad: so Macrob. lib. 1. Sat. cap.
23. See what the Assyrians (says he) imagine of the power of the Sun. The God
which they worship as the Supreme and greatest, they call Adad, which signifies
One, etc. This title is generally granted to be of Hebrew and sacred original,
though persons differ in its Radix; some drawing it from (...) Achod (mentioned
Esa 66.17.) one: others from (...) beauty. The Great Promotors of this (...)
Sunworship, among the Chaldeans were (...) Zabii their chief Philosophers. Of
whom see more largely in Part 2. B. 1. chapter Of Chaldean Philosophy. That the
Sun was worshipped as a God among the Sabeans (who appertained to the Chaldeans)
appears from that of Theophrastus, lib. 9. Hist. Plant. cap. 4. (...). So
Vossius de Idololatr. Addenda l. 2. p. 11.

The moon worshipped also as God: and the motives hereof.
As the Sun was the first and supreme God amongst the Chaldeans, so in
aftertimes, the Moon also began to receive Divine Honors and Adoration. The
Motives that induced these blind Heathens to Idolize this piece of Gods
workmanship, were these, or such like. 1. The Dominion which God in the first
Creation delegated to her as Regent of the Night. Genesis 1.16.17.
So Genesis 1.16.17. concerning which the Heathens received some imperfect
notices, by tradition from the Church of God, etc.

2. The admirable composure of the Moon, and its apposite situation in Heaven;
together with its differing (...), and Aspects; its Conjunctions and
Oppositions to the Sun; its Increases and Decreases; with its powerful
Influences on all Sublunary, especially moist bodies, gave a great occasion of
its first Adoration. Thus Aristot. de generat. Animal. cap. ult. (...). By
reason of its communion with the Sun, and reception of light: for it is as it
were a lesser Sun. Esa 46.1, Nebo.
Hence the Moon is styled by the Chaldeans Nebo, Esa 46.1. etc. as before Cap.
2.. 5.

Thus much for the Chaldeans supreme Gods, which filled up a great part of
their Natural Theology, especially in the beginning thereof. For the Chaldean
Philosophers styled Zabii, (whence the whole of their Theology was termed
Zabaisme) allowed not of any but (...) Natural Deities; the chief whereof was
the Sun. As for the Demons and Heroes, they seem to have had their first
institution in Phenicia, or Egypt; and belonged more properly to the Grecians.

. 8. Of the Persians, their natural Theology, and its symbolizing with the
Chaldean.
To the Natural Theology of the Assyrians, we may refer also that of the
Persians. For the ancient Persian Magi (as we shall hereafter prove in the
Persian Philosophy) received their first Institutes and Rites from the
Chaldean Zabii, which is sufficiently evident by their Symbolization. For look
as the Sun was called by the Chaldeans, Bell and El, from (...) El, and worshipped
at Ur under the Symbol of fire; (because they supposed him to be composed of
fire as, the original word (...) or signifies) so amongst the Persians, The Sun
styled Amanus from (...) the Sun.
the Sun was called (...) Omanus, or (...) Amanus, from (...) Chama or Ama,
which signifies both the Sun and fire, or the fiery Sun, from (...) Chom Heat.
Thus Strabo. lib. 11. makes mention of (...), the Persian God: from this Amanus
( Heb. (...)) sprang the Persian (...) Chamanim; which the Greeks called (...)
Pyraethea sacred fires, or rather Hearths, where their sacred fire was
preserved and worshipped as a symbol of the Sun, their fiery God. Hence Levit.
26.30. we read of (...) Chamanicem; Levit. 26.30.
which some render your images: but Vossius ( de Idol. lib. 2. c. 19.)
translates it Pyraea vel pyraethea vestra your Hearths, whereon your sacred
fire (the symbol of the Sun) is preserved and worshipped, answerable to that at
Vr in Chaldea. In imitation whereof the Grecians also had their sacred fire;
which they worshipped, called (...), i.e. says Vossius, from (...) the fire of
Jah, or Jehovah (of which see more in the Chaldean Philosophy.

This Amanus or Sun God, worshipped under the Symbol of fire, was called also by
the Persians, Mithras. So Hesychius (...), amongst the Persians the Sun is
called Mithras. Again, (...): Mithras is the chief God amongst the Persians.
Mithras.
The Origination of the word, Vossius ( de Idolol. lib. 2. c. 9.) fetches from
the Persian (...) Mether, or Mither; which signifies Great; and in the
comparative (...) Mithri or (...) Mithra, Greater, the same with (...) Lord or
Major: whence Scaliger derives Mithridates, etc.

Farther, that the Sun was the Supreme God the Persians worshipped, is evident
from the Sacrifices they performed; Horses sacrificed to the Sun.
Of which Herodotus lib. 1. gives us this account, (...), They worship the Sun
as the only God, and sacrifice Horses to him. The like Strabo 11. and Trogus or
Justin lib. 1. The Persians believe the Sun to be the only God, and consecrate
Horses to him. This piece of Asiatick Idolatry was imitated by the Israelites;
as it appears from 2 King. 23.11. where it is said, 2 King. 23.11.
Josias abolished the Horses, that the Kings of Judah had given to the Sun --
and burnt the chariots of the Sun with fire. This plainly refers to this
Persian Idolatry, which the Israelites had sucked in. Whence also Ezekiel. 8.16.
Ezekiel. 8.16.
The Israelites are reprehended for that they turned their faces toward the
East, and worshipped the Sun. Which was a piece of superstition they borrowed
from these Asiaticks.

Albeit the Persians admitted some kind of Symbols, in the worship they
performed to the Sun, their supreme God, yet they rejected all kind of (...)
Images, as unmeet to have any place in their Natural Theology: Thus Owen ( de
Theolog. lib. 3. cap. 8. page 223.) In those ancient times amongst many
Nations, (...), Images were in no use, no not known; yea, some abhorred them.
This is evident of the Persians, who took them away, etc. Thus we have gone
thorough the Natural Theology of the Chaldeans and Persians, showing how both
worshipped the Sun as their supeme God, under the natural Symbols of sacred
Fire, Kissing the hand, bowing toward the East, etc. without those pompous
Images, and Ceremonies, which the Grecian Hellenisme afterward introduced.

The Zabii and Magi, the first Institutors of this Natural Theology.
As for the main composers and promoters of this Natural Theology, they were
Philosophers, especially Astrologers, who were called by the Chaldeans Zabii;
whence their Theology was called Zabaisme; which contained Institutes for the
right worshipping their Planetary Deities; which were the figments of their
Astrological Contemplations and admirations. These Philosophers or Astrologers,
we called by the Persians, who borrowed the choicest parts of their Natural
Theology or worship from the Chaldean Zabii; as we have hereafter proved in
our Discourse of the Chaldean and Persian Philosophy. Yea according to the
relation of our English men, who visited East India Anno 1595. The Bamians,
Priests of those Indians who inhabit Cambaia, worship the Sun for their God;
professing themselves to be descended from Noah, etc. as Sandford Descens. l.
2.. 84. Now to sum up the Heads of this Demonstration. It seems evident, that
these Chaldeans and Persians took the Original Idea of this their Natural
Worship performed to the Sun, from that worship which was due, and so performed
by the holy seed of Shem, to the true God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, in
whose room they place the Sun; because their foolish hearts could not
comprehend the Invisible God.

. 9. The Egyptians Natural Theology.
We now proceed to the Natural Theology of the Egyptians, who also worshipped
the Sun as their chief Natural God. So in the Egyptian Theology, they style
the Sun (...) The only God of Heaven. The Original cause how the Sun came to be
Deified and worshipped by the Egyptians, was their natural inclination to
Astrology; for which they had no small advantages, by reason of the situation
of their country, and the serenitie of the Heavens in those Parts; which
induced them to spend much time, in eye-pleasing contemplations of the Sun:
whence their hearts were enticed, first into Admiration, and thence into an
Idolatrick Adoration thereof: as has (before. 4.) been proved out of Diodorus
lib. 1. and others.

The Sun styled Horus from (...)
The Sun was worshipped by the Egyptians under sundry Symbolick appellations.
1. He was styled (...) Horus or Orus from (...) light fire, or the Sun: Os
being added by the Grecians, according to their wonted mode, only as a
production of the name. That (...) signifies the Sun, is evident from Job.
31.26. Joh. 31.26.
if I saw (...) the Sun of which see more B. 3. C. 3.. 9. Thence (...) came
(...) Origenes, as (...). This Egyptian Orus or Horus Suidas makes to be the
same with the Grecian Priapus, and both Symbols of the Sun. Ex (...) Job.
31.26. Sell Aegyptius Orus appellatur Glass. Rhetor. Tract. 1. cap. 4.
So Suidas in (...). The image of Priapus, called by the Egyptians Horus, they
frame with a human form, bolding a scepter in his right hand etc. whereby,
says Vossius, is signified the Empire of the Sun over the whole world. Thus
for Orus considered Physically. If we consider Orus Mythically or Historically
for a man, then we may with Sandford ( de Descens. l. 1.19.) suppose him to be
the same with Aaron: whence the fable of Orus's being brother to Osiris; whom
Sandford takes to be Moses: or else we may take Orus or Horus to be the same
with Hur.

Osiris the Sun.
2. The Sun was also worshipped in Egypt under the name of Osiris. Thence the
Ancients call Osiris, Titan, and Phoebus. And Diodorus, Biblioth. 1. makes
Osiris to signify the same amongst the Egyptians, as (...) many eyed: an
Epithet given the Sun, by reason of his diffusion of rays and light, into all
parts of the World. It Is true, Osiris taken historically signifies Mitsraim the
son of Cham, or Moses (as chapter 4.. 10.) but if we consider him (...) Naturally,
he is usually made a symbol of the Sun. So Diodorus Siculus Biblioth. 1. (...).
The Sun reigned first in Egypt, surnamed by the star which is in Heaven, i.e.
Osiris.

Mnevis the Sun
3. Again at Heliopolis in Egypt, the Sun was worshipped under the Symbol of
Mnevis a sacred Bull; so Macrobius lib. 1. Sat. cap. 21. 'At Heliopolis, there
was a Bull consecrated to the Sun, which they worshipped under the title of
Neton, etc. For Neton, says Vossius, we must read Mnevis. This Heliopolis was
the same with that which the Hebrews call Beth seems the house of the Sun, or,
as you have it more fully Esa 19.18. Esa 19.18.
the City of the Sun* Heliopolis: Graecis urbs antiqua, praeci^ua Idololatriae
seeds. Grot.
I am not ignorant that our English version renders the Hebrew Here Is
destruction: but Grotius gives it another translation, rendering it the City of
the Sun, i.e. (says he) Heliopolis a city devoted to Idols, where Mnevis the
sacred bull was worshipped. Gataker on Esa 19.18. Esa 19.18.
(...), speaks thus: There is a double reading here in the Hebrew. Some render
the text Heliopolis, or the city of the sun shall be accounted one. There were
diverse Cities, in diverse countries, consecrated to the Sun, and that bare
therefore his name, being deemed one of the Heathens Principal Gods: of this
sort was Bethsemes among the Cananites: Kirheres, and Kirharesheth among the
Moabites: and among the Greeks Heliopolis; called by the Latins solis oppidum.
This City, called so anciently, but in latter times Damiata, was a City much
addicted to Idolatry; and is reckoned, by Herodote, for one of the six, unto
which the Egyptians used, at some set times, to repair out of all quarters;
because there was their famous Temple of the Sun, and there was kept Mnevis,
one of their sacred Bulls, which they worshipped for a God; as Apis, the other
of them at Memphis: so that the Prophets intendment is to intimate, that some
of those Egyptian Cities, that had been most polluted with Idolatry, should
receive the sincere service and worship of God etc. of which see more chap. 7..
10.

Apis the Sun.
4. As the Sun was worshipped at Heliopolis under the Symbol of Mnevis; so at
Memphis under the figure of Apis, another sacred Bull, which historically
refers to Joseph, (as before chap. 7.. 10.) but Physically to the Sun.

5. The Moon was worshipped amongst the Egyptians, under the name of Isis. So
Diodorus Biblioth. lib. 1. tells us; That the most ancient Egyptians,
contemplating and admiring greatly the Celestial bodies of the Sun and Moon,
judged them to be the eternal first Gods; whence they called the Sun Osiris,
and the Moon Isis; which they picture with Horns; because the Moon, in its
increase, is horned. Of Isis see chapter 2.. 5.

The Egyptian Demons.
As the Egyptians had their supreme God or Gods, so also their Deastri or
Demons; which were as Mediators 'twixt them and their supreme God. So Herodotus
lib. 2. makes mention of twelve Egyptian Gods, which were no other than the 12
Signs of the Zodiac; whereof one was supreme, and the rest subordinate to,
and Mediators with that supreme God etc. Yea, in process of time, the
Egyptians made every creature, that had any thing of Divinity in it, as a
medium or Symbol of that worship they performed to their supreme God. Whence we
may collect, that the Egyptian Gods came to multiply into such an infinity,
not from a multiplicitie of supreme Gods, but of mediums, or symbols, whereby
they worshipped the Sun their supreme God. That the Egyptians had their Demons,
or midling Gods, which were to be Mediators betwixt them and their supreme God,
is evident from what is generally asserted of Thales and Pythagoras, that they
brought their Demons and Demonologie out of Egypt into Greece. And Bochart, in
a Sermon at Caen, asserted, that the Egyptians had a city which was styled
(...), the city of the Heroes, or Demons, of whom Joseph is supposed to have
been the first.

. 10. The natural Theology of the Phenicians.
I come now to Natural Theology, as it flourished amongst the Phenicians; who
gave, if not the first lines, yet the main lineaments and form to the Pagan
(...) Demonologie. The Phenicians styled their supreme God (...) Baal, or
Belus; which historically refers to the first Phenician King, but (...)
physically to the Sun. Baal a symbol of the Sun.
This Phenician Baal is by Jerome, on Hos. 2.16, also by Bochart, distinguished
from the Assyrian Bell, which is written in Hebrew (...), (as in the Prophet
Daniel etc.) from El (...), God's name: whereas the Phenician Baal is written
(...) Baal, Lord, (which was also originally God's name;) So Beelsamen.
and when applied to the Sun, he is usually styled (...) Lord of Heaven. So
Philo Byblius, out of Sanchoniathon, tells us, that the Phenicians count the Sun
their only God, calling him Beelsamen, i.e. the Lord of Heaven, as before
chap. 7.. 1. Thence Bethsemes among the Cananites was so called, because of the
Sun's being worshipped there as God: as. 9. This Belus passed amongst the Romans,
under the name of Belenus, as Julius Capitolinus; or, as Herodian. lib. 8.
styles him (...), 1 Kings 9.18. 1 Chronicles. 8.4.
which name they applied historically to Apollo, but physically to the Sun. In
Palmyra, a city of Phenicia built by Solomon, and called by the Hebrews (...)
Thadmor, there was extant this Marble Inscription. Aglibelus and Malach belus
the Sun.
AGLILO KAI ALA
LO PATPOIS THEOIS.
To Aglibelus, and to Malach
Belus the Country Gods.
This is rendered by Bochart, ( Can. lib. 2. cap. 8 fol. 811.) To the summer and
winter Sun. This the Learned gather from the effigies of both graven in Marble.
Aglibelus, in the Phenician, (...), signifies the Round Lord; which is the
figure of the Sun. And Malach Belus, in the Phenician (...) Malach Baal,
imports the Lord King; both names given to the Sun: of which see more Jo.
Scaliger de emendat. Temper. lib. 5. and Seldom de Diis Syrum cap 1. syntag. 2.
Bochart Can. lib. 2. cap. 8. Salmasius and Vossius apply these Titlesto the
Sun, and Moon. So Voss. de Idol. lib. 2. cap. 5. where he makes Aglibelus to be
the Sun, and Malachbelus to be the Moon, i.e. the Lord King, and the Lady
Queen; as in Latin the Moon is styled both Lunus, and Luna. Thus Vossius in his
Addenda, lib. 2 page 4. If Malachbelus be Lunus the Moon, then Aglabelus must
be the Sun: however it may be, I as yet see no reason, but that Malachbelus may
sound The Lord of the Round, or of the Mundane Amphitheatre, etc.

Moloch the sun.
2. Hence in Caelosyria, the Sun was worshipped under the name of Moloch, (from
(...) Melech, the King,) which was the supreme God amongst the Ammonites: as 1
King 11.5.7. 2 Kings 23.10. Levit. 18.21. Levit. 20.2.3.4.5. In which we are
also given to understand the mode, how this God Moloch was worshipped; namely,
by causing their children to pass through the fire, which was a symbol of the
Sun: of which see Vossius de Idol. lib. 2. cap. 5. and before chapter 7.. 4.

Beelzebub the sun.
3. By those of Ekron (a part of Phenicia) the Sun was styled (...) Baal
zebahim, or, according to the Hebrew Title, (...) Baalzebub, the God of flies:
as before chap. 7.. 2.

Baal peor the Sun.
4. Again, the Sun passed amongst the Moabites (a Tribe also of the Phenicians)
under the name of (...) Baal peor, as before chap. 7.. 3. Thence we find
mention of a city among the Moabites called Kirheres, and Kirharesheth, i.e.
the city of the Sun, answerable to the Greek (...), as. 9.

Elagabalus the Sun.
5. At Emesa, the Sun was worshipped under the name of Elaeagabalus. So Julius
Capitolinus informs us, that 'the Phenicians call the Sun Heliogabalus. Thus
Herodian. lib. 5. So Vossius de Idol. lib. 2. c. 5. The Sun is called by the
Emissenes, Alagabalus, or Elagabalus, for which the Greeks and Romans write
Heliogabalus: yea, in Herodian, (...). That the Sun was hereby signified, both
Dio and Herodian show, who expound it (...); also the Stones, on which is
engraven, Sol Alagabalus; as the ancient Coin, on which there is sacerdos Solis
Dei Elagabali, prove the same. The first part of the name Elagabali, comes from
(...) Elah, or Arab. Alah, which signifies God etc. Now Elagabalus, in the
Phenician tongue, is (...) Elagabal, which signifies God the Creator; the title
given the true God of Israel, as chap. 7.. 7. and Boch. Can. lib. 2. c. 5.
where he shows, how the Phenician Philosophers persuaded themselves, that the
Sun was the great Architect and framer of all visibles; as it appears out of
Jamblichus, in his book de myster. Egypt. cap. 17. whose footsteps Julian the
Apostate following, in his Oration of the Sun, amongst other things has this:
Some forms the Sun perfects, others it effects, others it beautifies, others
it excites: neither is there any thing produced without the effective influence
of the Sun. Whence the Egyptians style the Sun (...), the Opificer of the
Universe etc. Thus Fuller, miscell. S. l. 1. cap. 14. Elagabalus is the same as
(...), the Sun the Opificer, or Framer of the world: as he is styled by
Porphyrie, in Eusebius praepar. Evang. lib. 3. cap. 4. Thence he makes (...)
gabal to signify the same with (...), a Framer, or Builder. But Vossius de
Idol. lib. 2. cap. 5. supposes (...) gebel in Arabic to signify a mountain;
and thence Elagabalus to import, the God of the mountain, wherein his Temple
was: whence a great stone rising up in the fashion of a mountain, was made a
Symbol of this God.

6. The Inhabitants of Edessa, in like manner, worshipped the Sun as their
supreme God. Thus Julian the Apostate, in his Oration of the Sun, says: We may
yet draw somewhat out of the Phenician Theology. They who inhabit Edessa, a
place from eternity sacred to the Sun, make him to have two Assessors,
Monimus, and Azizus; which Iamblichus interprets Mercury and Mars, two Demon
Gods. As for Mars, Julian calls him, (...), the Suns forerunner.

Adonis the sun.
7. Lastly, the Sun was called by the Phenicians (...) Adon, and Adonis; which
signifies Lord, and is the same with (...) Adonai, a name proper to the true
God of Israel. That Adonis was the same with the Sun, is evident from his
Identitie with Bacchus; as Plutarch. lib. 4. Sympos. cap. 5. where he brings in
the verses of Phanocles, touching Adonis's rape on Venus. Now that Bacchus was
the Sun, is proved in the following section, parag. 4. Of which see Vossius de
Idol. lib. 2. cap. 4. as elsewhere.

Though the Phenicians worshipped the Sun as their supreme God, yet they gave a
very great, yea the next honor to the Moon; which they worshipped also under
the names of The Moon styled Astarte.
1. Astarte, in the Phenician (...), which the Hebrews read in the plural, 2
King 23.13. (...) Astaroth: of which see what precedes of Juno, chap. 2.. 5.
Belisama.
2. Belsama. Baaltis.
3. Baaltis. Cijun.
4. Cijun, Amos 5.26. 5. The Queen of Heaven. All which titles belonged
mythologically to Juno, but physically to the Moon, as we have before proved of
Juno, chap. 2.. 7. etc.

The Phenician Baalim.
As the Sun and Moon were reputed by the Phenicians as their supreme Gods,
which they called (...), natural and immortal Gods; so they had their inferior
Baalim, Lords or Mediators betwixt them and their supreme God, or Gods; which
were none other than the souls of some great Heroes, or Princes deceased, and
deified. Thus Julian the Apostate, in his Oration of the Sun, makes Mercury
(who was historically Canaan) and Mars Assessors to the Sun, the supreme God.
So Hercules is generally reputed as one of these Phenician Heroes or Demons,
and so indeed his name imports; which some derive from (...), and (...) from
(...) Herin, Princes: whence Hero; as before ( chap. 5.. 1.) in our account of
Hercules, whom we judge the same with Joshua. Amongst these Baalim or inferior
Men Gods, we may reckon Belus with other of the Phenician Kings, who were after
death deified, and made Mediators betwixt Men and the supreme God: of which see
more in Pythagor. Philosophy.

. 11. The Grecian natural Theelogie.
We come now to the Grecians, their Natural Theology and worship; which in its
first rise and last refinement seems very probably the same with that in the
Oriental parts. The first Grecians worshipped Planetarie Deities.
As for the first rise of Natural Theology in Greece, Plato, in his Cratylus,
assures us, that the first and most ancient Grecians had the same Gods with the
Barbarians, viz. the Sun, Moon, and Stars: his words are, (...) etc. They, who
first inhabited Greece, seem to me to have had the same Gods, as many of the
Barbarians now have, viz. the Sun, Moon, etc. And then he subjoins, (...), when
therefore they beheld all these moving in continued course, from the nature of
(...) to run, they called them (...) Gods. Thence Herodotus tells us, that the
Gods were a long time worshipped by the Hellenes, without any proper distinct
names or Titles; only under the common name of (...): whereby, as we may
presume, they understood the Sun, Moon, and stars. Thus Sandford descens. l.
1.. 25. It seems to me, that the ancient Grecians conceived the Sun, Moon,
Earth, Stars, and Heaven to be the only Gods. And more fully in what precedes,
l. 1.. 6. Sandford assures us, out of Herodotus, that the ancient Hellens
worshipped not their Gods under any proper name, but called them only by that
common name (...), that is to say, (...) disposers; because they disposed of
all sublunarie Affairs. But at length, when the Pelasgi began to flourish,
Greece began to hear of the names of the Gods; which the Grecians received from
the Barbarians, especially the Egyptians; according to the Oracles approbation.
Plato derives (...) from (...), to run, and so applies the origination of the
Gods to the Planetarie or celestial Bodies, as before.

Zeno, in Stobaeus, says, (...), The Sun, and Moon, and other stars, are
intelligent and wise, fiery fire. The stars, bodies or seats of their Gods.
His meaning is, that these celestial Bodies, composed of fire, were informed
and actuated by some wise, intelligent, divine spirit. For we must know, that
the wiser of the Grecian Philosophers, Pythagoras, Plato, Zeno, etc. who were
the chief Institutors of this (...) Natural Theology, were not so sottish, as
to make the Sun, Moon, and Stars to be simply and absolutely Gods; for then
indeed they were no better than the Poets or Mythologists, whom they so greatly
cried down: but they made these Celestial bodies to be, as it were, the bodies
of their Gods, or the chief seat of their Residence. Thus Possidoneus, in
Stobaeus, says of the Stoics: (...), they say a star is a Divine body, or
the body of a God. So Philo the Jew, who did greatly Platonize, libro de
opificio mundi, calls the stars (...), Divine images, i.e. informed and actuated
by some Divine spirit: and lib. de somniis, he calls them (...), incorruptible
and immortal souls; i.e. in regard of that spirit which informed them. Others
refer the Physic Theology of the Grecians to the first principles of Nature.
So Sandford de descensu l. 1.. 27. That fable of the four sons of (...)
Saturn, all, that have indeavored to search into Antiquity, have understood
of the first principles of things. Also many by Jupiter, have understood the
fire; by Juno, the Air; by Neptune, the Water; by Pluto, the Earth etc. whence,
by an easy Anagrammatisme, he derives Aer from Hera.

This is a good key to open to us, what that Natural Theology, which the
Grecian Philosophers brought in, imports. Philosophers the composers of this
natural Theology
We must remember, that the Poets, who preceded the Philosophers, and were the
great broachers of Mythologick Theology, had, by their fabulous (...), or
generation of Gods, coined a world of Gods, which referred to some Oriental
person or tradition. The Philosophers being easily convinced, by their travels
into the Oriental parts, (where they found the original Records of these
fabulous persons, and stories,) that these Gods were but (...) mortal Gods, or
deceased men deified; they endeavor to reduce this mythologick, to a physic or
more natural Theology. And thus they make first but one supreme God, whose
chief throne or seat they suppose to be the Sun; and many other inferior
midling Gods, which they call Demons, or men Gods; which were the souls of
great Heroes deceased, residing principally in some star or other, as before.
5. As for their supreme God, the wisest of them, Pythagoras and Plato etc.
understood him to be the first eternal, infinite, and most unchangeable Being;
only out of fear or compleasance, complying with the superstitious humor of
the people, they expressed him by the common names of Jupiter, Apollo, etc.
This is evident from this; that the chiefest names of their Idol-Gods, are but
references to, as well as derivations from, the one true God. Thus in the
Grecians Iao, in the Latins Jove, in the Phenicians Ievo, in the Thracians
Evie, in the Athenians Hues, in the Eolians Phoibe, in the Americans Hioh, in
the Egyptians Bacchus; one and the same name Jehovah is evidently seen by all
that will, says Sandford de descens. l. 1.. 22. This supreme God the
Philosophers generally supposed to have his residence in the body of the Sun;
The Sun styled Saturn, Jupiter, etc.
which was thence called by some (...) Saturn, from (...) time, because the
Sun's motion is the measure of Time. 2. Others styled him (...) from (...),
heat; because the Sun was thought to be fire. Jovem autem fuisse Hebraeoru^
Deum and putavit Varro, and, siquid est in Augustini judicio merito putavit.
Sands. de desc. Christi l. 1.. 13.
Whence he was also styled Jupiter Hammon, from (...) Ham, or (...) Hamma,
which signifies the Sun; thence (...) Amman, the Temple of the Sun. He was
called also (...) Jupiter of Heliopolis, who was no other than the Sun, as
Vossius de Idol. l. 2. cap. 13. The Sun was also called (...) Dis, and
Diespater, (the names of Jupiter) from the Hebrew (...) di or dai in Shaddai,
Gods name. He was likewise styled (...), or (...), (another name of Jupiter,)
from (...) God's name. Thus Sandford de descensu Christi l. 1.. 10. This is
that which sometimes Apollo Clarius, being consulted, which of the Gods was
called Iao, is said to answer: ( Macrob. 1. Saturnal.) (...) etc.
Cunctorum dic as supremum numen Iao,
Hic tibi vere novo sit Jupiter, Helius aestu,
Dis cum saevit hyems, Autumno mollis Iao.


That the Sun is signified in these verses, the Interpreters of the Oracles (
Apollo Clar. etc.) have determined. And indeed it cannot be otherwise: for they
knew no other name of the Sun but (...). As for (...), the sacred fire, which
was the ancient name whereby the Sun was styled, before the introduction of the
other Gods, length of time had extinguished it. Lastly, the mention of the
Seasons of the Year, which follow upon the motions of the Sun, leaves no room
for dubitation, but clearly teaches us, that Helios and Iao are the same with,
or traduced from Elohim, and Jehovah. So also Orpheus: Unus and idem Dis,
Jovis, Helius, Dionysus.
This we mention, to show, that the name of Jehovah was known to the Ancients,
not only by sound, but also by its origin: for they pronounced it Iao, and as
Hebrew interpreted it according to the Hebrew writings. So Diodorus Siculus
Bibl. lib. 1. acquaints us, that Moses among the Jews writ Laws for the God
called Iao. By all which it evidently appears, that those Attributes (...),
etc. given to the Sun, were but Satanick imitations of sacred Attributes. Of
this see more what precedes of Jupiter, chap. 1.. 8. etc.

3. But the more proper name, by which the Grecians expressed the Sun, was
Apollo. So Julian the Apostate, hymno in Apoll. (...). Apollo is the Sun it
self; which name is amongst all common and known. Thus Plato, in Cratylus,
explicating the name Apollo, shows us how it signifies the Sun. So Cicero lib.
3. de Not. Deorum tells us, that the Sun is a God, which the Grecians call
Apollo, as the Moon Diana. Thus much is also evident from his other name (...);
which Hesychius explicates, by (...) i.e. from the most pure light of the Sun.
Farther that the Sun passed amongst the Grecians for Apollo, is demonstrated.
1. From his Form, which Julian, Hymno in Apoll. describes thus: (...) always
beautiful, always young; because the Sun never waxes old. 2. Apollo is said
to have invented Medicine, and to be father of Esculapius; because the
generation and virtues of Plants depend on the Sun, its influence. 3. Apollo is
said to be the eye of Jupiter, and the God of Divination; because the Sun is
the eye of the World, and that which discovers things most obscure and secret.
4. All the Sacreds and Rites of Apollo are applied to the Sun. So Vossius, de
Idolol. lib. 2. cap. 12. 1. The Laurel was consecrated to Apollo, as that with
which, they conceited, he crowned his head; whereby they signified the heat,
influence, and virtue of the Sun; the Laurel being a Plant always green, and
as they say, of a fiery nature. Thence the Athenians, in the seventh days
Hymn which they sung to Apollo, decked themselves with Laurel, as Proclus tells
us. 2. Of Animals, the Wolf was also consecrated to Apollo; either, because he
is, as the Sun, (...) most quicksighted, as the Scholiast on Aratus; or because
he is very watchful, and goes forth early, as the Sun, to seek his prey. Hence
Lupus from (...) light. Yea, Apollo himself was called (...), not because he
was worshipped in Lycia, as some will have it, but because he is the fountain of
light, as the Sun is. That the several Names, Rites, etc. given to Apollo were
of Hebrew origination. See what preceeds C. 4.. 1. etc.

Bacchus the Sun.
4. The Sun was also worshipped by the Grecians under the name of (...)
Bacchus. So Ulpianus, ad orat. Demosthenis, (...), because they call the Sun
Bacchus and Apollo; whence Bacchus was styled (...) borne of fire, from their
common supposition, that the Sun was fire. Hence also those Titles of Bacchus
(...): Hues is by Bochart derived from (...) Hu-es he is fire Deuteronomy. 4.24. as
Attes from (...) atta-es thou art fire; as in what precedeth C. 3.. 2.

5. Yea, Vossius de Idol. lib. 2. c. 13. makes Mercury and Mars, if we take
them Physically, to signify the Sun. So also Hercules as Voss. de Idol. l. 2.
c. 15. etc. All these and other of the Grecian Gods considered (...)
Physically, were but symbols of the Sun; though, if we consider them
Mythologically, they may be referred to some Oriental person or God as before.
This was long since well observed by Macrobius lib. 1. Sat. cap. 17. The
diverse virtues of the Sun gave names to diverse Gods. Again he adds; The
several appellations of the Gods may, by a certain hidden reason, be referred
to the Sun.

The Grecian Demons.
As the wiser of the Grecians seated their immortal supreme God in the body of
the Sun, so in like manner they placed their Demons in the bodies of the Stars.
So the Stoics styled a star, (...) a Divine Corpse, informed by the soul of
some Demon, and subordinate to the supreme God. Thus Austin explicates the mind
of the Stoics, de Civit. Dei lib. 4. cap. 11. The Stoics hold, that all the
stars are parts of Jupiter, (i.e. the Sun) and that they all live and have
rational souls; and therefore without controversy are Gods, i.e. Demon Gods.
So Philo the Jew, lib. de pietate, calls the stars (...), certain Rectors
subordinate to the Parent of the Universe: whereby he means the true God of
Israel, according to the opinion of some more intelligent Platonists; though
the most meant thereby the Sun.

. 12. We shall close up this discourse of Natural Theology, with some
reflections on it, in its highest elevation and refinement; The design of the
new Platonists to reform Natural Theology,
which was by the New Platonists, of the sacred succession, in the schole of
Alexandria, and that by means of the great Assistances, which they had from the
sacred scriptures and Churches of Christ. After that the broad and glorious
light of the Gospel shone on those oriental parts, especially on Egypt,
(according to that promise Esa 19.18. One shall be called the City of the Sun,
i.e. Heliopolis, devoted to the worship of the Sun) the wiser and more
ingenious of those Platonists, in the schole of Alexandria, saw a necessity of
reforming their Natural Theology; especially of rejecting those many
Fictitious Gods, which were crept into the body of their Theology. This, I
say, these Platonic Philosophers were forced unto, by Arguments the Christians
urged, not only from reason, but also from Plato's own Philosophy and
Concessions, which clearly disproves a multiplicitie of Gods. Hence these new
Pythagorizing Platonists, to salve their Natural Theology, pretend, that all
the ancient (...) Mythick Theology, was but an allegorick explication (...),
of the Physic Theology. Thus they reduce all their supreme Gods Saturn,
Jupiter, Apollo, etc to the Sun; and the lesser inferior Gods they make to be
Demons, or the souls of some deceased Heroes deified, and lodged in the bodies
of the Stars. Thus Plotinus, Ennead. 2. lib. 9. contends hard for these Deastri
or Star-Gods. This was the Theology which Julian the Apostate contended for;
as it appears by his Oration for the Sun; which he makes to be the one Eternal
supreme God. The Chief heads of this sacred succession in the schole of
Alexandria, who indeavored this Reformation of their Natural Theology, were
Ammonius, (whom some make to be a Christian) Plotinus his Successor, Porphyrie
successor to Plotinus, Jamblichus the Successor of Porphyrie etc. And the chief
means, which gave them most Assistance in this design, for the Reformation of
their Natural Theology, was indeed the sacred Scriptures, and Christian
Religion. For they had the LXX's Version by them in their Library: Besides,
Ammonius, the head of this succession, was either a Christian or well inclined;
who mixed Scripture notions with his Philosophy. See more, touching the
advantages these New Platonists had from Scripture light, for the Reformation
of their Natural Theology, in our following Discourses of Egyptian Philosophy
Part 2. Book 1. Also of Platonic Philosophy, Part 2. Book 2.

. 13. The Roman Natural Theology.
We should now come to treat of the Romans, their Natural Theology and
Worship: but herein we shall find little or no difference from that of the
Grecians, whence it had its original. For as the Grecians, so the Romans had
their Superior and Inferior Gods. The chief and supreme of their Gods,
considered Physically, was the Sun; which was worshipped amongst them under
differing Names and Forms, viz. of Saturn, Jupiter, Apollo, etc. Jani nomen
si ab historia arcessimus ex Javano fuerit contractum -- Sin Jani appellatio
primo non homini convenit, sed soli nempe ab (...) Jah etc Vossius de Idolatr.
lib. 2. ca. 16.
I shall mention only that of Janus, which was the chief God amongst the
Romans, and considered Physically, a Symbol of the Sun. As for the origination
of the name, we have before shown, how it was derived from (...) Jah, Gods
name, as (...) the Sun, from (...) El. And that the Sun was worshipped amongst
the Romans, under the name of Janus, is evident from the Testimony of Nigidius
Figulus, that learned Roman, who declares, that Apollo was Janus. Now all know
that Apollo was the Sun. So Arnobius lib. 3. says, that some made Janus to be
the Sun. 2. The Genealogy of Janus proves the same: for he is called the Son
of Heaven; which is proper to the Sun. 3. This is farther demonstrable from the
character Terentianus Maurus gives him viz. Jane pater Jane tuens, dive biceps,
biformis
O cate rerum sator, O principium Deorum.
This Vossius de Idololat. lib. 2. cap. 16. applies to the Sun. If we consider
Janus historically, and according to the mythologists, so he refers to Noah or
Javan; as before chap. 6.. 6. etc. The Romans had also their Demons or midling
Gods which they called medioxumi and Deastri, which were the souls of great
Heroes deceased and lodged in the Stars. So Julius Caesar is said to become a
star etc. But yet we must grant that the Roman Theology was not so much
Physic or Natural as Politic, and therefore belongs to the following Chapter.

CHAP. IX. Politic Theology traduced from Divine Institutes corrupted.
The Greek sacreds (...) etc. from (...), and this from (...) Jah, Gods name.
Numa the first Institutor of Politic Theology, and that in imitation of
Jewish Institutes. Pagan Laws concerning the worship of God, from God. The
Delphick Temple and its sacreds framed in imitation of Gods Temple, etc. Pagan
Altars in imitation of Jewish. Acts 17.23. The Grecian (...) from (...) Es-ja
Gods fire, Lev. 6.12. Pagan Priests in imitation of Jewish. Coena and Coes from
(...) Coen. The Pontifick College, Vestments, Orders, Qualifications, and
Purifications, of Jewish origination. Pagan Sacrifices Imitates of Jewish. The

. 1. Of Politic Theology.
HAving gone through Mythick and Physic Theology, we are now come to the
Politic; wherein we no way doubt but to discover evident notices of its
Traduction from Jewish Rites, Politic Theology was so called, 1. From its
first Institutors, who were Legislators, Statesmen, and Politicians. 2. From
its End; which was to keep the people in awe, and obedience to Laws. As for the
description thereof, we have it well delivered, out of Varro, by Austin de
Civit. Dei lib. 6. cap. 4. where, having described Mythick Theology seated
amongst the Poets; and Physic formed by the Philosophers; he describes
Politic or Civil Theology, seated amongst the Priests, thus: The third sort,
in the Cities the Citizens, but especially the Priests ought to understand and
administer: wherein we are taught, what Gods are to be worshipped publicly;
what Sacreds and Sacrifices are meet for every one to perform, etc. Herein we
have, besides the first Institutor and Ministers, also the chief matter of this
Politic Theology, which consists in those sacrifices, and sacred Rites of
worship, in use amongst them, whereby it is farther differenced from the
Mythick Theology; which chiefly respects the (...), or Genealogy of the Gods;
also from the Physic Theology; which mainly refers to the (...), and (...)
Sun, and Demon Theology. So that this Politic Theology may, in a more
peculiar manner, assume and appropriate to its self, the name of (...)
Idolatry or Idol worship. Now that all Pagan Idolatry or politic Theology
sprang from the Jewish Oracles, or Scripture misconstrued is asserted by
Godwin, in his Jewish Antiquit. lib. 4. cap. 1.2. (...) etc. from (...) or
(...), and this from Jah.
Hence some learned men derive the very Greek names (...) a Temple, and (...) a
Priest, from the Hebrew (...) Jah, Gods name. For (...), by an easy change of
the final aspiration (which the Greeks use not) they first sounded (...), which
exactly answers to, or indeed is the same with, Jah, according to that of
Hesychius (...), Ja, among the Hebrews, signifies God. (...) Apollinis soribus
in scriptum Hebraicum Jah denotat. Sandf. Descens. lib. 1.. 13.
Thence from (...) they formed (...): whence that common acclamation in their
Paean sung to Apollo, (...). But in as much as the ancient Grecians had not the
use of (...), till Simonides brought it in, according to that of Plato. (...):
hence, instead of (...) they used (...); whence sprang (...) a Temple, (...) a
Priest, and other sacred Names among the Grecians, as Dickinson Delphi Phoenic.
c. 10. Hie Graecorum est Hebraicum Jah, ex quo omnia sacrorum vocabula apud
Graecos. Sandf. l. 1.. 5.
Thus likewise Sandford, de Descensu lib. 1.. 5. All the sacreds of the
Grecians were taken from the Hebrews: many also of the names of the Gods were
drawn from the Hebraick. We will begin with Hieron: [(...)] whence had it its
origination, but from (...) Hie; as Grammarians teach us? Now, if from this one
little word, hie the Temples, Priests, Sacrifices, and lastly all sacreds were
denominated (for from whence (...), from thence also (...), and (...), and
whatever else of that kind came) we may not doubt, but that the Ancients
understood therein, some illustrious and eminent Nature and Power; which,
unless we have recourse unto the Hebraicks, we shall never find. And this
indeed the very Ceremony of the Greeks compels us unto: for their Sacred Hymn
Paean, consists chiefly of this acclamation, Hie, Hie; whereof they make Eleleu
the Proanaphonesis. Now if we, as the Law of Peanisme requires, prepone Eleleu
to Hie, it makes Eleleu Hie; which is the very same with the Hebrew Hallelujah
etc. Omnem sacrorum ornatum ab Hebraeis in Graeciam penetrasse, omnem caelitum
nationem ab Aeg^ processisse, om^ Deorum no^, anaphonemata, ceremonias, res
gestas a Judaeis desu^pta videas: Sandf. Descens. l. 1.. 22.
Thus Sandford of the Traduction of the Greek (...), Hie, (...), etc, from the
sacred name (...) Jah. Of this see more B. 3. C. 1.. 11. So also Cudworth in
his true notion of the Lords supper, page 15. says, that Paganism is nothing
else but Judaisme degenerated. I shall endeavor to prove this Assertion both
from the Causes, and Parts of Pagan Idolatry.

. 2. Numa Pompilius the chief Institutor of Politic Theology had his Laws for
worship from the Jews.
The chief seat of this Politic or Civil Theology, was the Roman Empire. For
look as Physic Theology had its original and chief Seat in the Oriental
parts, Chaldea, Egypt, Phaenicia etc; and Poetic Theology its chief seat in
Greece; so in like manner Politic Theology at Rome. And the first, at least
the chief Institutor thereof, was Numa Pompilius; who had his Original Idea or
Platform from the Jewish Church and Oracles. So Cassander (in his Consultat.
Art. 21.) acquaints us, That Austin out of Varro, affirmed, that the Romans,
for more than 170 years, worshipped their Gods without images: which, said
Varro, if it had yet remained, the Gods had been more purely observed. And to
confirm this his opinion, amongst others, he produces as a witness the
Jewish Nation. Clement writes, That Numa, the Author of this Institute, was a
Pythagorean; who being aided by those things which Moses had delivered,
prohibited the Romans from making any Image of God. Thus Cassander. The like I
find in Plutarch, in the life of Numa Pompilius: where he tells us, That Numa
forbad the Romans to believe, that God had any form or likeness of beast or
man, (which is agreeable to the Pythagoreans, who thought the Gods were
invisible, and incorruptible, and only Intelligible) so that in those former
times, there was in Rome no image of God, either painted, or graven, for 170
years. They built Chapels to the Gods at Rome; and yet neither with Picture or
image of God within them. For they took it at first as a Sacrilege, to present
heavenly things by earthly forms; seeing we cannot any way possibly attain to
the knowledge of God, but in mind and understanding. Thus Plutarch, conformable
to that of Varro, Austin, and Clement; who make Numa to have traduced this his
simple mode of worship from the Jewish Church. And, albeit that of Clement,
concerning Numa's being a Pythagorean may not hold true; because Pythagorass
coming into Italy, was not till many years after Numa's death; yet his, and
our Assertion, that Numa received the original Idea, of this mode of Worship
from the Jewish Church, is no way prejudiced hereby. For Numa might receive the
Traditions hereof from the Phenicians, who possessed many maritime towns of
Sicilie and Italy, and often sailed into these parts: as before B. 1. c. 8..
5. Or else it is possible, that this (as many other Institutes and sacred Rites)
was afterward added to the Constitutions of Numa, and so passed for his, by the
advice of Pythagoras, who was styled (...), the Jewish Ape, or Imitator.
However it came to pass, yet certain it is, those ancient Heathens, who first
instituted this Pagan Theology or Idolatry, had more refined apprehensions of
God, and of his worship, than their followers; which we cannot rationally
impute to any other cause save this, that they were more intimately and
thoroughly instructed in the Jewish Religion and worship. This will farther
appear by the ensuing particularities.

. 3. Laws concerning worship of Gods from God.
First, it was generally confessed, by the first great Institutors of Laws for
the worship of the Gods, that they received their Institutions and Laws from
some Divine Oracle. So Numa Pompilius, when he came to deliver his Laws for the
worship of the Gods, pretends to a Divine Inspiration. Thus Plato, de leg. 6.
fol. 759. lays down this as a general Concession, that all Laws and
Constitutions about the worship of God, must come from God: his words are
(...), Laws about Divine matters must be fetched from the Delphick Oracle etc So
again Plato, de leg. 10. (...), It is not lawful to constitute Gods or Sacreds,
beyond the Law. So likewise, de Repub. 5. fol. 468. Plato says, that
concerning the worship of the Demons, we must consult God's Oracle, in what
rank those blessed men are to be had; and with what Ensigns they are to be
honored etc. We have reason enough to conclude, that Plato learnt this, as well
as other Divine Traditions, from the Jews, with whom he had about 14 years
conversation in Egypt. De Graecorum religione ostenditur primo, sacra Graecorum
ab Hebraeorum ceremoniis deflux isse. Sandfordus de des^ens. Christi lib. 1.. 5.
Yea, we are not without probable conjectures, that Plato, when he refers us to
the Delphick Oracle, for all Divine Constitutions and Laws about Worship, he
means no other than the sacred Oracles of the true God, whence he borrowed the
choicest of his Contemplations and Traditions.

. 4. The Temple and Sacreds at Delphos framed in imitation of Gods Temple, and
other sacreds at Jerusalem.
More particularly; One great part of this politic and sacred Theology
regards the Heathens Temples, and their consecration to some God; which seem
exactly parallel to, and therefore, as we may presume, were framed in imitation
of God's sacred Temple at Jerusalem. The Devil indeed delighted much to play
the Ape, and to be worshipped by his Devoti in the same, or a like mode, as the
true God was worshipped at Jerusalem. 1. Hence, as God had his Temple, wherein
they prayed, and sung Hallelujahs unto God: so the Devil had his Temple at
Delphus, where they sung (...) or (...), Eleleu Ie, or Ia, unto Apollo. (...)
Iah, Graece (...) Delphici Templi foribus inscribebatur. Delph. Phoen. c. 10.
Sandf. desc. l. 1.. 13.
So Eustathius in Odys. (...), beseeching their Demon to be propitious to them,
they cry out Ie, Ie, i.e. Iah, Iah. Whence we are informed by some learned men,
that the ancient wise men of Greece writ this sacred name of God on the very
doors of their Delphick Temple. Hence also the very name (...) Temple, was so
styled from (...) Hie, which is the same with Iah, as before. 1. 2. As God had
his Tabernacle, so Apollo had his cortine, exactly answering thereto. 3. As God
had in the Tabernacle his Ark, so Apollo had in his Cortine a Tripos,
conformable to the Ark. 4. As the Ark, so the Tripos also was overlaid with
Gold. Whence Apollo is said (...), to give ambiguous responses from his golden
Tripos: and as the Ark was compassed about with a golden Crown, so Apollo's
Tripos; (...), the Tripos was bound about with a Crown. Scholiast in Aristoph.
Pluto. 5. On the Ark there was placed (...), a propitiatory seat: in imitation
whereof the Delphicks had a certain seat they called (...), which was placed on
the Tripos, whereon Apollo's Pythian Prophetess sat, and, after consultation
with the Demoniack spirit, gave forth Oracles, in Satanick imitation of Gods
Divine Oracles. Thus Dickinson, Delphi Phoenicissantes, cap. 11. Ad
similitudinem Tabernaculi, cortinam; ad Arcae faederis exemplum, Tripodem: ad
umbram Propitiatorii Epithematis, Holmum: etc. Dickins. Delph. c. 11.
Not only the mysteries of the Tripos, but also those of the Cortine and
Holme, seem apparently to be translated from the Tabernacle and Ark. For the
Delphicks, that they might compose themselves exactly to the Hebraick mode,
instituted the Cortine after the likeness of the Tabernacle; the Tripos
according to the pattern of the Ark; the Holme according to the form of the
propitiatory seat; and a Table, answerable to the table whereon stood the
Shewbread etc. Yea we are told, that not only the Pagan Temples, but also
their other more exact pieces of Architecture, were derived from that stately
structure of the Jewish Temple. So Seldom de Jure Not. lib. 1. cap. 2. fol. 27.
tells us, that Villalpandus, that Egregious Divine of our Age, as also
Mathematician, will have the more perfect and complete. Idea of all
Architecture amongst the Greeks and Romans, to have flowed from the Hebrew
proportions in the Temple of Solomon, and other of his structures. See
Villalpandus's own words in Ezech. Tom. 2. part. 2. lib. 5. disput. 1. cap. 13.

. 5. Pagan Altars in imitation of the Jewish.
As the Pagans Temples, so also their Altars, seem to have been taken up in
imitation of those amongst the Jews. I shall mention only the Altar at Athens,
dedicated to the unknown God, Act. 17.23.
Act. 17.23. The Altar to the unknown God.
That this Altar was dedicated to the true God of Israel, though unknown to
those blind Grecians, Paul's words seem to assure us: unto the unknown God
(says he) whom ye ignorantly worship etc. whereby he seems to intimate, that
the Altar was dedicated to the true God, albeit they knew him not. This will be
farther evident, if we consider the Original of this Altar; whereof we have a
good account given us by Diogenes Laertius, in the life of Epimenides thus:
Epimenides was counted (...), a great Devoto: he staid a Plague amongst the
Athenians thus: he took a black and a white Sheep, and carried them to
Areopagus, from whence he let them go which way they would; commanding those
that followed them, that wheresoever they laid down, they should sacrifice them
(...), to some peculiar meet God. And to this very day (says Laertius)
throughout the Athenian Pagi, there are Altars to be found without name, which
were then made in memory of this Expiation, as it is certain etc. That
Epimenides (reputed such a Devoto) by his peculiar God, meant the true God of
Israel, concerning whom he had received some traditional notices, seems very
probable, by the sacrifices which he institutes, which were but a corrupt
imitation of the Scapegoat amongst the Jews; as hereafter. 8. The Grecian
(...), and the Roman Vesta, in imitation of the sacred fire. Levit. 6.12.
Yea, not only the Altar, but the fire which burnt on the Altar at Jerusalem,
was very far imitated by the Grecians and Romans. Lev. 6.12. The Jewish Priests
are commanded to keep the fire burning on the Altar; and the Grecians receiving
some broken Traditions hereof, make a Law, that there should be preserved at
Delphe (...) unextinguished fire. This fire they called (...), as it is supposed
from the Hebr. (...) Es-ja, the fire of Iah or Jehovah. So Josh. 13.14. the
Sacrifices of God are called, (...) Ese, the fires of Jehovah: which answers to
the Greek (...), called by the Latins Vesta: as Vossius and Dickins. Delph.
Phoen. cap. 11.

. 6. The Pagan Priests in imitation of the Jewish.
Another part of Politic Theology regards the ordering of Priests, and their
Offices; wherein also the Pagans owe very much to the Jewish Priests, for their
Original Ideas. We shall begin with some appellations given to Pagan Priests,
which were but derivatives from the Jewish. Thus the Priest of the Samothracian
Cabiri was called Coes, from the Hebrew (...) Coen, a Priest. So a sort of
Priests amongst the Gauls were called Coenae, from (...) Coen. Also another
sort of Priests were called Patera, from (...) pater, to interpret, Genesis 40.41.
as Bochart affirms. But to pass on to the first institution of Pagan Priests,
especially amongst the Romans, wherein we doubt not but to give evident notices
of their Traduction from the Jewish Priesthood originally. Plutarch, in the
life of Numa Pompilius, gives us a good account of the original Institution of
the Roman Priests. The Pontifick College.
Numa Pompilius (says he) erected the Pontifick College, and he was the first
Pontifex. The chiefest of those Bishops, whom they call the great Pontifex,
has the Dignity and Authority of the High Priest, and master of the
Pontifick Law: who is to see, that none break the ancient Ceremonies, nor bring
in any new thing into Religion, but that every one should be taught by him, how
they should serve the Gods etc. Here we see an order of Priesthood amongst the
Romans, exactly answering to that amongst the Jews. For as the Jews had their
High Priest, and inferior Priests under him; so the Romans: as the Jewish
Priests were the conservators of the Mosaic Law; so the Romans of their
Pontifick or Canon Law etc.

The Pontifick Vestments in imitation of the Levitick.
2. The vestments the Roman Pontifices wore, seem much the same with those of
the Jewish Priests. For as the High Priest amongst the Jews, had his Miter; so
also the Roman Pontifex maximus. Thus Lud. Vives in August. civit. lib. 2. cap.
15. The Apex is the top in the flamen, or that which they wore upon the head;
to wit, a cap. The Romans give not the Apex to any but the chief Priests, as we
now the Miter etc. So Bochart, in his Discourse against Veron, proves, that the
ancient Pagan Priests had their Miters etc. Again as the Jewish Priests had
their Ephod, which was a white Linen Vestment they wore upon their upper
garment, when they administered about holy things; (whence a white garment was
much affected by the Jews, as Eccles 9.8. let thy garments be always white:)
so also the Roman and other pagan Priests, according to the institutes of
Pythagoras, were to perform all Acts of Worship in white garments etc. Thus
Diogenes Laertius, in the life of Pythagoras, tells us, that he held (...), that
the Gods must be always worshipped with praises, (or a good conscience,) and
with a white Vestment etc. This, without doubt, he learnt from the Jewish
Ceremonies, wherein he seems to have been very much versed, if not initiated.

The Pontifick Orders.
3. In the Pontifick College, instituted by Numa Pompilius, and perfected by
Pythagoras his Institutes, there were not only differing orders, but also
differing degrees in the same order of Priests: for some were Novices, who were
not admitted to the view and participation of their mysteries, but after long
purifications and probations, with many sacred ceremonies necessary for their
initiation: in order whereto, Pythagoras appointed those of his College, five
years probation and preparative discipline; which being expired, they, having
approved themselves worthy, were admitted to the state of, (...), the perfect,
and so made partakers of all mysteries etc. All which, as also the whole of his
Collegiate constitutions, orders, and discipline, Pythagoras derived from the
Jewish College of Priests and Levites; who had their Novices and perfect, their
five years probation or preparation for their Service and Office; as we prove
at large in our Discourse of the Pythagorean Philosophy, and the parallel
betwixt the Pythagorean and Jewish College.

4 The qualification of Pagan Priests the same with the Levitick.
4. Concerning the qualification of particular Priests, Moses's Law required
that they should be perfect, without blemish, or any bodily defect. The like
Plato requires in his constitutions touching Priests. Plato de leg. lib. 6.
fol. 759. He that is, by suffrage, chosen into the order of Priesthood, must,
after examination, be found to be, (...), without blemish, and legitimate.

5 The Pontisich purifications of Pagan Priests Judaick.
5. The Jewish Priests had their legal Purifications and washings, before they
entered upon any sacred administration: so in like manner the Pagan Priests;
especially such as were of Pythagoras his College. So Diogen: Laertius, in the
life of Pythagoras, tells us, that Pythagoras held the Gods were to be
worshipped with a pure body; which purity was attained by Expurgations,
Washings, Sprincklings, and Abstinences from all defilement etc. This, we need
no way doubt, he traduced from the Jewish Ceremonies, in which some think he
was initiated; at least, he could not be unacquainted with these Rites of the
Jews, with whom he had 20 years conversation in Egypt, and more than 10 years
in Babylon; as we prove in the story of his life. Justin Martyr, Apol. 2.
confidently affirms, that all those purifications and washings, which the
Ethnicks used in their Sacreds, had their original from our Scriptures, abused
by the Devils hell bred affectation of likeness to God; yea, that the Pythagorean
mode of discalceation, or putting off the shoes, at entrance into the Temple,
was taken up in imitation of Gods command to Moses, when he drew near to the
burning bush, Exodus 3.5. to put off his shoes etc.

. 7. Pagan Sacrifices from Jewish.
A main part of Politic Theology consisted in certain Canons or Rules, laid
down for the right ordering of Sacrifies; all which were but Satanick
imitations of, and derivations from Jewish Sacrifices. This we dare confidently
affirm, because we have such rational grounds for the demonstration thereof.
Neither are we without great Authority to confirm the same. Learned Bochart,
de Animal. S. part. 1. lib. 2. cap. 33. fol. 325. gives us an excellent
demonstration hereof. There were (says he) several sorts of Sacrifices amongst
the Jews; some Holocausts, or whole burnt offerings, some pacifick, some
propitiatory. There were also Sacrifices of Times and Persons, Votive,
Consecrative etc, which the Egyptians, Grecians, and Romans, in many things,
affected. Whence you may learn, that the Gentiles, from a cursed (...), evil
zele, affected to give the same worship to their Dunghill Gods, which the
Israelites gave to the true God.

The Jewish Holocaust imitated by Pagans.
This we may prove from the beginning of the first chapter of Leviticus, where
we have certain Rites prescribed for the offering an Holocaust. First, it is said
Lev. 1.2. Lev. 1.2. Bullocks etc.
That the Oblations should be taken, as well from Bullocks, as from Sheep, and
Goats; for (...) signifies both. In imitation whereof, the Heathens sacrificed
Bullocks, Sheep, and Goats to many Gods. Thus Achilles, in Homer, joins these
three together. Hence it follows, Levit. 1.3. Lev. 1.3. A Bullock perfect.
a burnt Offering of a Bullock etc. God begins with a bullock, which Livie
often calls the greater Sacrifice. So (...), in the Proverbs of the Ancients,
signifies to make pompous provision; because none but the rich could offer a
bullock, as Erasmi Adag. Then Moses adds, Lev. 1.3. That the bullock must be
[a male without blemish.] This also was observed by the Egyptians, as Herodotus
lib. 2. cap. 41. The Egyptians universally sacrificed clean bullocks, and those
Males and Calves. Moses requires that this Holocaust be (...), perfect; which
word is also used by Achilles, in Homer, who is said to make an offering to
Apollo (...) etc, of perfect Goats. It follows in Moses Lev. 1.4. Levit. 1.4.
On the head.
And he shall put his hand upon the head etc. namely, for the confession of
sin, as Lev. 16.21. Herodotus lib. 2. cap. 39. mentions the like of the
Egyptians, who were wont to lay an execration on the heads of the Sacrifices,
in these or such like words; that if any evil were impendent on them that
sacrificed, or on whole Egypt, it might be converted on this head. And
Plutarch, in Isis, says, that after they had imprecated on the head of the
sacrifice, they cut it off.

It follows Levit. 1.5. Levit. 1.5. Before the Lord.
And he shall kill the bullock before the Lord. [Before the Lord] i.e. at the
door of the Tabernacle, as v. 3. where the Altar stood, as Levit. 17.3-9. Thus
Plato, de Leg. lib. 10. lays down this as an inviolable constitution, that no
one have an Altar in his private house: wherefore they usually placed the
victimes before the public Altars. So Virg. lib. 9. Aen. Et statuam ante aras
aurata front Juvencum.
And lib. 2. Georg. Et ductus cornu stabit sacer hircus ad aram.
And the sacred Goat being led, shall stand at the Altar: which answers to that
of the Psalmist, Psalm. 118.27. Psalm. 118.27.
Bind with cords (i.e. bring bound with cords) the sacrifice to the horns of
the Altar. Levit. 1.5. He shall kill.
2. God commands [he should kill the Bullock] He, i.e. either he that offers
the bullock, or, as they will have it, some Levite: as it may be gathered from
2 Chronicles. 30.17. and 2 Chronicles. 35.10,11. where the Levites were to kill the
Paschal Lamb; but the Priests were to sprinkle the blood. Thus it was amongst
the Romans; the Priest did not kill the Victime, but the Popa or Victimarie, at
the beck of the Priest; who therefore standing by the Victime, now and then
said: Agon? i.e. Agone? shall I do it? Lev. 1.5. sprinkle the blood.
3. Then it follows [And sprinkle the bloud] The Levite having killed the
victime, the Priest received the blood in a vessel; which Moses Exodus 24.6.
calls (...) aganoth: and the Chaldee (...) that is to say, an Aspersorie: the
LXX render it (...); so the vulgar crateras. In imitation whereof, the Popa
having killed the Victime, the Priest received the blood in a Vessel; which
vessel the Atticks called (...). Homer Odyss. (...). styles it (...); The Latin
Pateras. So Virgil Aen. lib. 3. Sanguinis and sacri pater as -- which he
understands of the Victimes, as Servius. 4. This blood is said to be sprinkled
[upon the Altar] as Exodus 24.6. This also was imitated by the Pagans: whence
that of the Poet: -- Illius Aram
Saepe tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus.
The tender lamb from our flock shall often moisten his Altar, i.e. (says
Servius) pour out his blood on the Altar etc So Lucian, lib. de sacrificiis
(...) the Priest pouring out the blood on the Altar.

Thence it follows Lev. 1.6. Levit. 1.6. flay and cut.
And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it in pieces. After the killing
of the Holocaust follows the excoriation and dissection: whereof we find also
a satanick imitation amongst the Heathen; So Homer Iliad a -- (...)
(...) And they killed, and excoriated, and cut in pieces etc. So Virg. lib. 1.
Aen An Tergo diripiunt costis.

As to the Dissection, it was not made rashly, but with great Art and
Industry; as it appears in Homer often ( Iliad e and o etc) (...) they
accurately or artificially dissected etc which seems to have been taken up
inimitation of the Jewish^ Priests their accurate dissection of the sacrifices:
which the LXX express by (...), as Genesis 4.7. Prove. 3.6. and 9.5. which word is
also used in the New Testament, 2 Timothy 2.15.
2 Timothy 2.15. signifying rightly to divide; which refers to the accurate
dissection the Priests made of the Sacrifices. So Heb. 4.12. The word of God is
compared to the two edged knife, whereby the Priests divided the Sacrifices etc
See more of these things in Dilherri Tractatu de (...) Gentilium. Whence
Bochart acknowledges he had not a few of these notions. It follows Lev. 1.8.
put fire on the Altar. Whereto the Delphick (...) or sacred fire, from (...)
Es-ia the fire of God, as also the Roman Vesta seems to refer, as before. 5.

. 8. The Jewish expiatorie sacrifices imitated by the Heathens. The Escape goat
Lev. 16.7.
Besides the Holocaust or burnt Offering, the Jews had also their expiatorie
Sacrifices, especially that of the two Goats, whereof one was to be a escape,
goat, as Levit. 16.7,8,9,10. In imitation whereof the Egyptians had also their
Goat Sacrifices and worship, as Bochart de Animal Sacr. Praefat. In allusion to
Levit. 16.7. we have showed (says he) that the Egyptians were very exact and
pompous in their Goat-worship. Thence Tragedy from (...) a Song over the Goat
sacrificed to Bacchus etc. And indeed the Original of that Altar to the unknown
God Act 17.23. seems to have been taken from this Jewish sacrifice of the two
Goats. We have mentioned somewhat before. 5. out of Diogenes Laertius, who
relates the story, how Epimenides, to stop the Plague at Athens, took a white
and black sheep etc. I shall add, for a confirmation hereof, what I have met
with in Lud. Vives, in August. de Civit. lib. 7. cap. 17. There were (says he)
at Athens many Altars consecrated to unknown Gods, as Acts 17.23. So Pausanias
in Attica, (...) Altars of the unknown Gods: which Altars were by the invention
of Epimenides erected at Athens. For the Region laboring under the Pestilence,
the Pythian Oracle being consulted, made answer, That the city ought to be
expiated, as also the country; neither should the sacreds be performed to any
of their particular Gods. Epimenides, who was then at Athens, departs, and
commands that the sacrifices should be let go thorough the fields, and the
sacrificers follow them; and in that place where they made a stop, sacrifice
them to the propitious unknown God. Therefore from that time to the Age of
Diogenes Laertius, there were seen in the Attick Pagi many Altars, without name
etc. In imitation of the Jewish escape Goat Levit. 16.8. the Greeks had their
(...); which Tranquillus, in Julio Caesare, calls Vagum, as Glassius Grammat.
S. lib. 4. Tract. 3. Observe. 2. De Nom. Prop. These expiatory sacrifices were
called by the Grecians (in imitation of the Jewish expiatories) (...) and
(...). 1 Cor. 4.13. (...).
So Hammond on 1 Cor. 4.13. (...) etc. These terms (says he) signify those
things, that were used in the lustrating of a City amongst the Gentiles; which
Hesychius renders (...); denoting those that were paid for others ransomes, or
put to death in others stead. This Heathen custom, from whence all this comes,
being, in a manner, but a Transcript of the Azazel amongst the Jews, (the
scapegoat) that was sent into the wilderness, with all the sins of the people
upon him; which was therefore called (...) rejectaneous or refuse etc.

To this of the Scapegoat we may add that other Jewish sacrifice of the red
heifer, which was offered for purification, as Number. 19.2.9. a red heifer
without spot etc, whereto we find a parallel in the Egyptian Sacrifices, as is
well observed by Bochart, de Animal. Sacr. par. 1. lib. 2. cap. 29. fol. 290.
God, says he, commanded to sacrifice a red Heifer Numb. 19.2. Numb. 19.2. The
red Heifer imitated.
The Jews copulate these two together (...) a perfect red. Whence Maimonides,
in Tractat: de Vacca rufa, cap. 1. 2. If it has but two hairs white or black it
must be accounted unclean. According to which superstition, the Egyptians
sacrificed red Bullocks, with such an accurate observation hereof, that if the
Bullock had but one hair black or white, it must be accounted profane. So
Plutarch in Iside. To which we may add the Sacrifices of Pigeons, amongst the
Jews; which the Heathens, by a cursed, (...), emulation imitated, as Bochart in
his Preface to Histor. de Animalibus S. The sacrifices of Pigeons, the
Ethnicks, by a wicked emulation usurped etc.

. 9. The oblation of human sacrifices to Saturn, an imitation of Isaac's being
offered, and of Christ's sacrifice on the Cross.
But the great expiatorie sacrifice was the Paschal Lamb; which was in a more
peculiar manner a Type of the Jewish Messiah or Christ, who is styled the Lamb
of God slain from the foundation of the world: the Image whereof we have in
Abraham's intentional sacrificing his son Isaac, etc. All which the Devil (who
greatly affected to be Jehovahs Ape) assumed to himself as an homage due from
his Devoti. So Eusebius, praepar. Evang. lib. 1. cap. 9. proves out of
Porphyries Book, (...), that the Phenicians (by the Devils Inspiration) took
the original Idea of offering their Sons to Moloch or Saturn, from Abraham's
intention of offering his Son Isaac. Porphyries words are these, Saturn, whom
the Phenicians call Israel, had by a Nymph called Anobret, an only Son, which
for this they called Ieud, who being clothed in a Royal habit, was sacrificed
by his Father etc That by Saturn and Israel must be meant Abraham; by the Nymph
Anobret Sarah, from (...) conceiving by grace; by Jeud, Isaac who is styled
Genesis 22.2. (...) Jehid. We have sufficiently proved out of Bochart in our
discourse of Saturn chap. 1.. 5. But as Abraham's intentional sacrificing of
his only Son Isaac, was an Image or Type of Christ, the only Son of God, his
being offered on the Cross as a ransom for sinners; so we need not doubt, but
that the Devil in exacting human blood as an expiatorie Sacrifice, had a very
great reference to, and imitation of that sacrifice, which he knew Christ was
to offer on the Cross. This inhuman mode of offering human blood to Saturn,
began in Phaenicia, where Saturn passed under the name of Moloch. We have the
manner of it described by Diodorus, Biblioth. lib. 20. There was (says he)
amongst them a brazen statue of Saturn, of a vast magnitude, whose hands
hanged down on the Earth, so contorted and involved, that children who were
brought to it, fell down into a ditch full of fire. This cruel custom of
Sacrificing children to Moloch or Saturn, the Jews sucked in from the
Phenicians; whereof we find often mention in Scripture as Act. 7.4. The place
where these sacrifices were offered was Tophet, in the valley of Hinnom, which
thence was made an Image of Hell, as Esa. 30.33. whence sprang the Greek (...)
Gehenna, i.e. the valley of Hinnom, as before C. 7.. 4. From the Phenicians,
the Carthaginians also received the same Rites. So Tertullian, Apol. cap. 9. In
Africa they publicly sacrifice their Sons to Saturn. Thus August. de civit.
lib. 7. cap. 19. Carthaginians. Lud. Vives on this place says, that it was a
Custom very ancient, in dangers of war, for the Prince to sacrifice the Son,
which was most dear unto him, to pacify the wrath of the revengeful Devil. But
the Carthagineans, who sprang from the Phenicians, sacrificed a man to Saturn.
Also in Latium a man was offered to Saturn, etc. And indeed in process of
time, this horrid piece of Idolatry became Catholic and Universal: neither
was there any part of the Devils worship, wherein the Pagans did more generally
conspire, than in this of sacrificing human blood to their enraged Idols.
Arnobius tells us, that it was the common fashion, in past times, to worship
Jupiter of Latium, with man's blood. Yea the History of the Decii acquaints us,
that it was not unusual amongst the Romans, for men alive to devote themselves
to the infernal Gods. Herodotus affirms, that the Egyptians sacrificed living
men to their brutish Gods. Amongst the Thebans (who were also a colonie of the
Phenicians) the story of Menaeceus, is famous; who, for the preservation of
the City, devoted himself to the Infernal Gods. Procopius tells us, that the
Inhabitants of the I Will of Thule, observed this custom of sacrificing men, even
down to his time. The same Cicero and Plutarch mention of the Gauls: and of the
Britans, Caesar, Comment. lib. 6. gives this reason hereof, 'because the
Druides thought, that nothing was a meet expiation for man's life, but the life
of man. Thus we see how ambitious the Devil was to be worshipped with human
sacrifices in imitation of that to be performed by the Son of God; at least in
imitation of its Types in the Jewish Church. See Owen Theol. lib. 1. cap. 8.
also Grotius de Satifact. cap. 10, where he proves at large, that it was most
usual with the Heathens to pacify the Devil, the God of this world, by human
sacrifices, and that in imitation of the Jewish Sacrifice and Christ, the
original Idea of all.

. 10. The Jewish federal sacrifices imitated by Pagans.
As the Jews had their sin offerings, so also their Federal Sacrifices: as Genesis
15.9.10. God being about to renew his Covenant with Abraham, bids him take
certain beasts and divide them etc. The like we find practiced by the
Israelites, Jer. 34 18. And more particularly Psalm. 50 5. we find mention made
of a covenant by Sacrifice; which refers to the manner of federal sacrifices;
wherein the parts being divided, those who entered into covenant, passed between
the parts thus divided etc. These federal sacrifices were much in use amongst
the Heathens, and as it is presumed, in imitation of those amongst the Jews: so
Muis on Psalm. 50.5. Psalm. 50.5.
a Covenant by Sacrifice. It is (says he) a known phrase; Genesis 15.9,10. Jer.
34.18,19.
the original whereof seems to be taken from Genesis 15.9,10. and Jerem. 34 18,19.
In making covenants, to the end they might have a greater Religion and Faith
attending them, they killed victimes, and dissected the beasts: by which
Ceremony they, who entered into covenant, intimated an imprecation on
themselves, that he who first violated the Covenant, should be smitten as the
beast adhibited to establish the covenant was smitten: Yea, that his punishment
should be by so much the greater, by how much the more powerful God, whom they
appealed unto as a witness, was. Which custom obtained also among the Heathens,
(namely by Traduction from the Jews) who being about to make a Govenant and
Peace with their enemies, divided an Hog or Sow with a flint; as it appears out
of Livie lib. 1. and from that of Virgil Stabant and coesa jungebant foedera
porca.
The like Mede, on Mal. 1.11. Diatrib. 2. page 504. where he proves at large,
that a sacrifice is a federal oblation, or Symbol of a League and Covenant
'twixt man and his offended God. For the clearing whereof we must know, that it
was the universal custom of mankind to contract covenants of friendship by
eating and drinking together: so Isaac with Abimelech Genesis 28. Jacob with Laban
Genesis 31. David with Abner 2 Samuel 3. Jos. 9.14. Hence a covenant is called
(...), from (...) to eat. So Herodotus tells us, the Persians were wont to
contract Leagues of friendship inter vinum, and epulas. The like Tacitus
reports of the Germans. Amongst the Greeks and other Nations, they did eat
bread and salt together. Such are the sacrifices 'twixt Man and his offended
God; they are epulae foederales, wherein the sacrifice being first offered unto
God, and made his, he becomes the convivator, and vouchsafes this grace to
man, to eat and drink with or before him, in token of reconcilement. That the
Offerer did partake of the sacrifice, is evident from Exodus 34.15. and that the
Sacrifices were symbols of our covenant with God, is apparent also from that
salt, wherewith the sacrifices were seasoned Mark. 9.49. which, among all
Nations, is a token of friendship. Thence Levit. 2.13. it is called the salt of
the Covenant, because a symbol of its perpetuity, and friendship contracted
thereby. Now if the Salt, which seasoned the Sacrifice, were sal foederis, what
was the sacrifice it self but epulum foederis, as Genesis 15.9,10. and Psalm. 50.5?
Whence it is evident, that the Pagans symbolized with the Jews in their
covenants by Sacrifice. Thus Bochart, de Animal. S. part. 1. lib. 2. cap. 33.
Again, as Jerem. 34.18. the Israelites pass between the parts of a divided
Calf; so the Boeotians and Macedonians, between the parts of a divided Dog:
Xerxes's army 'twixt the parts of a divided man: the Greek and Trojan Heroes
'twixt the parts of a divided Hog. And the Molossi entered into Covenant by a
divided Bullock. And among the Scythians, those who were partakers of the same
conjuration, confirmed their mutual faith, by eating the flesh of a roasted
Bullock cut in pieces. We find somewhat of like kind performed by Saul, 1 Samuel
11.7. and by Abraham Genesis 15.9. Thus Bochart.

Pagan feasting on sacrifices from Jews.
As in those federal sacrifices, there was a Division made of the parts, so
likewise the persons entering into the covenant, were to eat of those parts, as
an argument of their mutual confederation and friendship. This is evident from
the Jewish manner of eating the Paschal Lamb, which being a Sacrament or seal
of the Covenant, 'twixt God and them, was first sacrificed at the Temple, and
then brought home to their private families, and eaten by them, as a pledge of
their reconciliation, and confederation with God. And indeed all the Jewish
sacrifices, at least such as were Types of Christ's sacrifice offered on the
Cross, were but federal oblations; and their feasting upon them, but symbols
or tokens of their federal communion with God, in those sacrifices: whence the
Pagans derived their federal sacrifices and feasts there upon. So Cudworth in
his Notion of the Lords supper, page 5. where he shows us, how the Gentiles in
their worship received the custom of sacrificing, and feasting on their
sacrifices, from the Jews. For Paganism is nothing else but Judaisme
degenerate etc.

The Pagan Lectisternia.
This is farther evident from the Pagan Lectisternia, or the feasts they made
to their Gods, in times of calamity; of which Austin de Civit. lib. 3. cap.
17. speaks thus There arising a great pestilence the people conceived that new
Lectisternia were to be exhibited. These beds were prepared for the honor of
the Gods, whence this sacred (or sacrilege) received its name. Lud. Vives on
these words Lectisternia etc, gives us this comment, In times past they feasted
lying upon beds: but as often as there was a feast exhibited in any public
Temple, for the pacifying the anger of the Gods, it was sacred: and there were
beds strewed or prepared, as if they were to lie down and feast with the Gods:
this they called Lectisternium, preparing the Beds. These Lectisternia seem
very answerable to the Jewish manner of eating the Passover, a symbol of their
federal communion with God; which at first institution they ate standing, in
token of their speedy motion; but after their coming to Canaan, they were wont
to eat it on their beds, according to their mode of feasting: as it appears by
our Saviors eating the Passover, Joh. 13.23.
John 13.23. where he that was the beloved Disciple, lay with his head in
Christ's bosom, and so the next in his etc. So that we need not doubt, but
these Lectisternia had their original Idea from the Jewish mode of feasting on
their Sacrifices; which was a federal Rite, or a seal of their confederation
with God, as the Lord's supper is to Christians.

. 11. The Jewish Tenths and first fruits.
Besides their expiatorie and federal Sacrifices, the Jews had also their
Thank-offerings, called more properly Oblations, in Hebrew (...) Minchah; which
consisted chiefly of the Tenths and first fruits of the Earth; especially of
Corn, and Wine, and Oil: Deuteronomy. 18.3,4. Numb. 18.12.
as Deuteronomy. 18.3,4. Numb. 18.12. Deuteronomy. 14.23. The same the Devil requires of his
Devoti, as it appears by the story of Anius, the Priest of Apollo, who, in the
time of the Trojan war, coming into the Grecian Camp, brought with him store
of Corn, Wine, and Oil; which (says Bochart, Can. lib. 1. cap. 14. fol. 440.)
were abundantly supplied to him from the Oblations: for of all the increase of
the Earth, these three the Devil, God's Ape, exacted of his Worshippers. The
like Bochart (in a Sermon he preached at Caen, December. 30. 1663.) asserted on
Genesis 4.3. Genesis 4.3.
At the end of the days: whence he proved, that by days was meant the year;
at the end whereof, which was in September, Cain and Abel offered up these
Sacrifices, which were 1. as commemorations of the Creation, which was in
Autumn: 2. as thankful acknowledgements of God's blessing them with the fruits
of the Earth; answerable whereto the Jews had their Feast of ingathering of the
fruits: whence we read of the joy of harvest etc. Deuteronomy. 14.22,23. Ps. 4.7. Also
the feast of Vintage, which was in September. Hence the men of Sichem had their
custom of sacrificing, and feasting at the end of the year; of which we read
Judge. 9.27. Jer. 41.1.5.8. Hence also other Heathens had the original of their
Bacchanalia, which they celebrated about the end of the year, with Tragedies
and Comedies, wherein also wine, corn, and oil were offered, answerable to the
Jewish institutes: which customs are retained by some to this very day. Thus
Bochart. Farther, the Heathens, in imitation of the Jews, offered Tenths to
their Gods. So Diogenes Laertius, in the life of Solon, says, that all the
Athenians separated the Tenths of their Fruits for public sacrifices, and
common good. So Tertullian, in his Apol. cap. 14. The Tenths of all are devoted
to Hercules.

. 12. Pagans generally observed the seventh days Sabbath, in imitation of Gods
Sabbath.
Hence it were not difficult to demonstrate, that all the Pagan Festivals, viz.
the Saturnalia, Bacchanalia, Lupercalia, Quirinalia, etc. had their original
from the Jewish Festivals. But we shall at present instance only in the
seventh days Sabbath; which was generally observed by the Pagan Idolaters, and
that in imitation of the Church of God. Linus makes mention of an (...), a
seventh day, observed amongst the Saints etc. So Hesiod. 2. dier. (...), the
seventh day holy day. So Porphyrie, in his book (...), of the Jews, (quoted by
Eusebius. praepar. Evang. l. 1. c. 9.) tells us, that the Phenicians consecrated to
their principal God Saturn; whom they also called Israel, one day in seven, as
holy etc. And the Grecians, in commemoration of Apollo's victory over Python,
(which is supposed to be but a fable of Joshua's victory over Og, King of
Basan) are said every seventh day to sing an hymn to Apollo, who instituted
the Pythick Games or Holy days, the first seventh day after his victory, as
before C. 4.. 3. Athenienses, septimo quoque Lunae die hymnum canentes
Apollini: ut Proclus monet in illud Hesiodi, (...) Vossius de Idolol. l. 2.
cap. 12.
Aulus Gellius lib. 13. cap. 2. speaks of certain Ethnic Doctors, who were
wont to philosophize only on the Sabbath day. To which suits that of Lucian,
in Pseudologista, touching the seventh days being granted to Schole-boies, as
an holy day: whence also Lampridius, in Alexander Severus, observes of him,
that the seventh day, when he was in the city, he ascended the Capitol, and
frequented the Temples. Thus Clemens Alexandrinus (...) lib. 5. (...), not
only the Hebrews, but also the Greeks observe the seventh day as holy. So
Eusebius. 14. de praepar. Evang. lib. 13. affirms, that not only the Hebrews,
but almost all the Philosophers and Poets, acknowledged the seventh day as more
holy. Yea Josephus, in his last book against Appion, affirms, that there could
be found no city, either of the Grecians or Barbarians, who owned not a
seventh days nest from labor. This Sabbath, or seventh days rest, which the
holy seed of Noah observed as holy to God, the Idolatrous seed consecrated to
the Sun, their supreme God, and thence called it Dies Solis, Sunday. This
Idolatrick Translation of the Sabbath from God to the Sun, seems to have been
very ancient, and therefore not so much in imitation of the Jewish Church, as
of the Patriarchs, and holy seed of Shem. So Lud. Cappel These. Salmur. de
cultu. In the most ancient writings of the Ethnicks, namely of Homer, Linus,
Orpheus, Callimachus, etc. there are extant various Testimonies of a seventh
day, sacred in general; as also of a seventh day recurrent, observed by the
Ethnicks as sacred: which observation seems to have been derived to them by
Tradition from the Fathers, and long usage. The like I find in Usher, his
Discourse of the Sabbath, p. 73. The Heathens (says he) had their knowledge of
God, and the Sabbath from the first Fathers, by Tradition, who lived before the
dispersion.

. 13. Pagan Oracles and Devotion, with Abstinencies and Ceremonies from Jewish.
The Pagan Prophetic predictions and Oracles had their original Idea from Gods
Divine Oracles, and Prophetic Revelations. So Iackson, on the Script. fol. 29.
shows us, how the Devil counterfeited God's manner of speaking, as well as his
manner of Apparition: for the Heathens (as well as the Jews) were resolved of
future events by Dreams, Visions, and Oracles. Godwin, Jewish antiquit. lib. 4.
cap. 20. proves, that all pagan Divination and witchcraft was derived from
Jewish Oracles corrupted etc. And as God answered the Jews by Urim and Thummim,
so the Devil his Devoti in the like manner. Thus Grotius, de Imper. sum.
potest. p, 135. Elian writes, that the chief Priest amongst the Egyptians, had
hanging about his neck, (...), an image of Saphir, which was called (...). The
like Diodorus Siculus relates. Whence it appears, that the neighboring Nations
imitated the Jewish mode, in respect of the Urim and Thummim, as the Devil is
wont to be God's ape. For in the time of the Hebrew Judges, the Idol Priests
had also their Ephod, whence they gave forth Oracles: Judge. 8.27.
as Judge. 8.27. So Mede on Deuteronomy. 33.8. ( Diatr. 2. page 368.) shows, how the
Teraphim, amongst the Idolaters, answered to the Urim and Thummim amongst the
Jews etc.

. 14. Twere easy to show, how much of the pagans Devotion, Abstinences, and
Ceremonies had their original from Jewish institutes. To begin with their
prayers; Vossius ( de Idol. lib. 2.) tells us, that (...), Lord have mercy upon
us, was an usual form of prayer amongst the Gentiles, as well as Jews. So
Arrian; Epictet. lib. 2. cap. 7. (...), calling upon God, we pray, Lord have
mercy upon us etc. 2. As for Abstinences, Bochart (in his Preface to Hist. de
Animal. S.) tells us, that not a few of the neighboring Gentiles abstained from
Swines flesh, after the custom of the Jews. 3. Touching Ceremonies, we have
before,. 6. proved, how the Pagans sacred Vestments, Purifications, and
Washings were but borrowed from Jewish Ceremonies. We might prove the same of
the Heathens Circumcision, (which Pythagoras is said to have received from the
Jews,) as Brerewoods Inquiries, cap. 13. But we shall content our selves with
the mention of some few other.

Phylacteries.
We know the vain glorious Jews, especially the Pharisees, wore their
Phylacteries, [i.e. little membranes, whereon certain sentences of the Law were
written,] as Math. 23.5. on their Foreheads, Arms, etc. from a false
construction of Exodus 13.16. Deuteronomy. 6.8. Whence the Indians, Persians, and
Babylonians took up the same, and that in imitation of the Jews. So Hieronymus
in Math. 23.5. Math. 23.5. Exodus 13.16. Deuteronomy. 6.8.
The Pharisees (says he) ill understanding those commands of the Lord by
Moses, Ex. 13.16. Deuteronomy. 6 8. Thou shall bind these words as a sign on thy hand
etc. wrote the Decalogue of Moses in Membranes, folding them up, and binding
them on their foreheads; making them, as it were, a crown for their head, that
so they might be always before their eyes; which to this very day the Indians,
and Persians, and Babylonians do; and he that has this, is accounted among the
people as Religious.

As for Funeral Rites, the Jews were wont to rent their mantles, and shave
their heads, in token of their sorrow, as Job. 1.20. and elsewhere: so in like
manner, in great Funerals, or fatal mournings, it was usual among the Heathen
to rent their garments, and shave their heads. As to the former, Virgil Aen.
12. describes a mourner thus. -- It scissa vest Latinus
Conjugis attonitus fatis urbisque ruina.
Herodotus lib. 1. records, that the like gestures were among the
Lacedaemonians, and Livy li. 1. among the Sabines; Job. 1.20.
as Caril on Job. 1.20.

This may suffice to make good our Assertion, that the Pagan Politic Theology
or Idolatry had its original from Jewish and Divine institutes corrupted.

. 15. I shall conclude this Head of Pagan Theology, with a great observation
of our learned Sandford, de descensu Christi lib. 1.. 17. Verissimum, pri scis
omnibus una^ eandemque esse Theologiam, qua^ Graeci ad fabulas traxerint: et
omnia adversus veritatem de ipsa veritate fuisse constructa. Sandf de desc. l.
1. 17.
They, says he, reason ill, who conjecture hence, that the Jews and Grecians
had one and the same God, because there are found among both the same Names,
and Anaphonemata, and things done: whereas that is more true, yea without all
comparison, most true, that among the most ancient people, there was one and
the same Theology; which the Grecians turned into Fables; and so from truth it
self all was turned against the Truth. To which agrees that, 1. Machab. 3.48.
(...), from the book of the Law did the Gentiles draw the similitudes or Ideas
of their Idols. For hence, for the worship of their Gods, they assumed Names,
in Religion and Antiquity, sacred: hence also they borrowed their Holy days,
Rites, Ceremonies, as also many noble Exploits; as Dickins. Delph. Phoeniciz.
c. 6.

BOOK III. Of Pagan Poesy, History, Laws, and Oratorie; with their Traduction
from sacred Oracles,
CHAP. I. Of Pagan Poesy, and its Traduction from sacred Oracles.
Poesy the most ancient of Human Literature. Divine Poesy most ancient, and
the Idea of Human: which is proved 1. by Authority, 2. by Artificial
Demonstration: 1. from the first Poets, Linus, Orpheus, Homer, and Hesiod. 2.
From the Original occasion of all Poesy, viz. God's Miracles and Apparitions
in, and for his Church. 3. From its Impulsive cause, viz. Admiration. 4. From
the agreement betwixt Divine and Pagan Poesy in their main end, viz. Worship.
5. From the parallel betwixt Divine Poesy and Pagan, in their form of
production; which was by Divine Enthusiasme. Plato's description of Poetic
Enthusiasme, as parallel to Divine Enthusiasme. The Greek Rapsodist parallel to
the Jewish Psalmodist. 1 Samuel 10.5,6. Poesy not an Art, but Divine Afflation.
6. The Traduction of pagan Poesy from Divine Oracles, is proved from its
Matter; which is either Theologick, Philosophic, or Historick. 7. Lastly, the
same is demonstrated from the parts of Poesy; which is either Eicastick, or
Fantastic; and both from sacred Symbols and Oracles.

. 1. WE have dispatched, in the foregoing Books, two chief parts of Philologie;
namely the original of Languages, and Pagan Theology. We now proceed to a
third branch thereof, viz. Poesy; with endeavors to demonstrate its derivation
from sacred Oracles. Poesy the most ancient part of human Literature.
First, that Poesy was the most ancient of all Artificial Literature,
especially amongst the Grecians, is generally affirmed by the Learned; and we
have for it the Testimony of Strabo, lib. 1. where he undertakes to prove,
that Prose is only an imitation of Poesy etc. Thus also Vossius, ( de Histor.
Graecis lib 1. cap. 1. page 7.) asserts, and proves, that the Greek Historians
and Philosophers were after the Poets. So also Jackson (on the Authority of the
Scripture) gives it, as from unquestionable Antiquity, that all other set
speech, whether Historical, or Rhetorical, was but the progeny of Poesy,
falling in latter times from its wonted state. And indeed its evident from the
thing it self, that all the ancient Learning of the Grecians, both History,
Morality, Philosophy, and Theology, was delivered in Poesy. Hence Orpheus,
and other Poets were anciently styled (...), Teachers, because they taught men
Theology, and Morality etc. Whence also the ancient Discourses of the
Philosophers were styled (...), Songs, etc. because they delivered their
precepts of Philosophy in verse. So Pythagoras, and the rest of the
Philosophers of his Sect: yea, among the Latins, carmina were used for moral
Precepts; as Stillingf. Orig. S. Book 1. chap. 4.

. 2. That Divine Poesy was most ancient, and the spring or Idea of Human.
As Poesy was the first piece of artificial Discourse amongst the Pagans,
particularly the Grecians; so it is as certain, that Divine Poesy preceded
Human; yea, that the latter was but a corrupt imitation of the former. We have
the original, form, and mode of Scripture. Poesy laid open to us by Joseph
Scaliger, Animadversiones in Eusebius. Chron. ( fol. 6.7. edit. 1658.) We find not
(says he) in the Psalter, or Lamentations any Cantick bound up by Laws of
Meter, but the Discourse is merely Prose, animated by a Poetic character. --
Only the Cantick of Moses in the last Chap. of Deuteronomie, the Proverbs of
Solomon, and almost all the Book of Job, are bound up under the necessity of
Rithme; which Rithme is like two Dimetrian Jambicks, with a Tinnulus to the
ears. -- The Cantick of Moses is a Rithme drawing near unto a Tetrameter
Jambick, not unto an Hexameter Heroic, as Josephus will have it. -- Yea, there
is no Hexameter or Pentameter to be found in the Sacred Bibles: neither does
the Rithme in them consist of any exact Modes; but the Rithme is sometimes
shorter, sometimes longer, according to the capacity of the sentence etc. Thus
much for the judgment of Jos. Scal. touching Scripture Poesy, its several
Modes, etc. That Moses was the most ancient of all Poets is proved by Josephus,
l. 2. contra Appion: as Mariana in his Preface to Genesis. We find Moses's
Prayer delivered in a kind of poesy, Psalm. 90. Also Moses's Song, upon Gods
delivering the Israelites out of the hands of Pharaoh Exodus 15.1. Then sang
Moses etc. which was seconded by the Song of Miriam ver. 20. Likewise Jobs
Discourses are, for the most part, in Verse. All which pieces of Divine Poesy
are much more ancient than any piece of Pagan Poesy: and we need no way doubt,
but that the latter was, by I know not what artificial Satanick imitation, the
Product of the former; as it may be demonstrated, both by Inartificial and
Rational Argumentation.

. 3. Testimonies to prove the Traduction of Pagan Poesy from Divine Oracles.
As for Inartificial Arguments or Authority, we shall begin with that of
Tertullian ( Apolog. cap. 47.) Who is there, says he, of the Poets who has
not drank of the prophets fountain etc? Thus Jackson, in his learned Discourse
of the Authority of the Scriptures, proves at large, that the most of those
fabulous Narrations, and feigned stories, mentioned by Heathen Poets, had their
original platform, as also their main foundation and rise from some real issue
of Divine Power; and therefore may be referred to some historical relation of
sacred writ. So Jacks. of the Scriptures fol. 27. Albeit the events, which the
most ancient Poets relate, through long distance of time seem most strange to
us, yet is the ground such, as upon better search, may always be referred to
some Historical Truth; which yielded stuff to Poetic structure, as day
spectacles do unto night Visions. Again the same Jackson, fol. 34. speaks more
fully thus: Continually, whilst we compare ancient Poets or stories with the
Book of Genesis, and other Volumes of sacred Antiquity, these sacred Books
give us the pattern, of the waking thoughts of ancient Times. And the Heathen
Poems, with other fragments of Ethnic writings, contain the Dreams and Fancies
which succeeding Ages, by hearsay and broken Reports, had conceived concerning
the same or like matters. For any judicious man, from the continual and serious
observation of this Register of Truth, may find out the original, at least of
all the principal Heads, or common places of Poetic fictions, or ancient
Traditions; which, it cannot be imagined, they should ever have come into any
man's fancy, unles from the Imitation of some historical Truth, or the
Impulsion of great events, stirring up Admiration etc. The like, the said
Author adds, fol. 49. where he proves, that the Poets have borrowed their best
stage attire from the glorious wardrobe of Israel. And again fol. 56. The
Sacred Antiquity of Jewrie was to other Nations, as Nilus to Egypt, the main
stream or principal river. Thus Jackson: of which more hereafter.

. 4. Artificial Demonstration.
We proceed to the Artificial or Rational Demonstration of our Assertion,
touching the Traduction of Pagan Poesy from Divine; which we shall endeavor to
make good, from the first Authors, Occasions, Ends, Principles, and Parts of
all Pagan Poesy. 1. From the first authors of Poesy amongst the Grecians.
As for the first Authors of Pagan Poesy, they are generally supposed to have
been the Grecians: but as for the time when Poesy began to take root amongst
them, it is somewhat uncertain. Carrion, in his Chron. lib. 2. makes Linus to be
the first of the Greek Poets, who taught Hercules Letters and Music, etc. His
words are these: What time Linus flourished in, we may gather thence, Linus,
the first of the Greek Poets, traduced the choicest of his Poesy from sacred
Oracles and Operations.
that he is said to teach Hercules Letters, and Music; who when young being
chid, fell into a passion of anger, and thence threw the Table, wherein he he
drew his letters, at Linus's head; with which blow he died. They say that Linus
was the first that brought Learning into Greece from Phenicia etc. Hence we may
safely conjecture, first that Linus was by birth a Phenician: for such the
ancient Hercules Tyrius his Scholar was, as before. 2. That Linus also lived
about the time the Cananites were expelled Canaan by Joshua. For about this
time Hercules Tyrius also lived; who transplanted some Colonies of these
Cananites or Phenicians into Africa, Spain, and such parts as bordered on the
Midland Sea; whence the chief parts of Joshua's achievements, are by the
Mythologist transferred to him; as before: (unles we make this Hercules
distinct from, and after Hercules Tyrius) 3. Whence also it appears that the
choicest materials of Linus's Poemps were of sacred Original. For he being a
Phenician, and living about that time, wherein God wrought so great wonders in
behalf of the Israelites, he could not but have some Notices thereof. Yea, we
have reason enough to conclude, that most of his Mythologie, or fabulous
Narrations touching the Gods, their (...), Genealogy, and exploits were but
broken Traditions, and Imitations of some sacred Persons, Exploits, and Stories
in the Jewish Church. And albeit we have few Relics of his Poems, yet what
remains seems to owe its original to the sacred Fountain, opened amongst the
Israelites; especially that most celebrated Verse (...)
Its easy for God to atchieve all things; and with him nothing is impossible.
This Golden Verse, we may presume, Linus gained from the Divine Oracles, or his
own observations of Gods Divine power in and with his Church.

. 5. Orpheus's Poesy derived from sacred Scripture.
Next to Linus follows Orpheus, whom Carrion ( lib. 2. touching the ancient
Learning of the Jones) makes to be Linus's Auditor, and companion of the
Argonauts. This Orpheus is said also to have writ the wars of the Titans, and
the Expedition of the Argonauts. Orpheo, qui sub Judicibus floruisse a
quibusdam dicitur, circa Cadmi tempus, qui ab illo edoctus. Sandford de
Descensu l. 1.. 22.
Its reported also, that he was torn in pieces by the women in Thracia, out of
a superstition; because he had changed their Laws. Thus Carrion. Some make the
Poetic Age to begin with Orpheus. Its certain he was a great Promotor, if not
the first Inventor of the (...), Generation of the Gods. Justin Martyr styles
him (...), the first Teacher of Polytheisme. He was a great Instrument the
Devil employed for the erecting of Idolatry, together with Melampus, Musaeus,
Arion, Methymnaeus, Amphion of Thebes, and Eumolpus the Thracian; who were all
great Promotors of Idolatry, as well as of Poesy; whereof, we need no way
doubt, but that they received the original Idea from the Jewish Church. For,
that Orpheus was in Egypt, is generally confessed: whence, as it is said also, he
brought most of his superstitious Rites and Customs into Greece; wherein those
who were initiated, were called (...). Thus Sanford, de Descens. l. 1.. 22.
Orpheus is said to be the first that brought into Greece the Sacreds of father
Bacchus; who also, as Diodorus reports, Diodor. l. 1.
at the same time, and with the same endeavor, brought in the mysteries of
Hades; according to those things which he had drunk in in Egypt, from the
sacred Hebraick Scriptures (...), imitating these things, but other things
framing of himself. Thus Sandford. Now that the Egyptian Rites, and
superstitions were of Jewish extract originally, is elsewhere proved. They say
also that Orpheus traduced much of his Learning from Phoenicia: which we may
very justly suppose, if that hold true, which we have before mentioned out of
Carrion, that Linus was his Praeceptor. This seems farther evident from that
Philosophic Tradition fathered on Orpheus, (...), of water Slime was made:
which was a great Phenician Tradition, as it appears by the fragments of
Sanchoniathon; wherein we find mention of this (...); which he makes to be the
same with his (...), in the Phenician Tongue (...) mod, the first matter or
Chaos, out of which all things were framed. Now that this Phenician maxim (as
the most part of their Learning) was originally derived from the Jewish
Oracles, has been elsewhere sufficiently demonstrated.

Orpheus (according to Eusebius) Eusebius. ex Tim. Chron. (...),
makes mention of the first Creation of man out of the Earth; as also of the
infusion of the rational Soul by God. And Suidas attests, Suidas. in (...).
that Orpheus held, there was a certain Country (...) invisible, (...):
following herein the Traditions of Moses. This Orpheus was very skilful in
Music, as well as Poesy; which gave him a mighty advantage on the Thracians
and Macedonians, for the Civilizing of them: whence 'twas fabled, that he drew
men and trees after him, i.e. by the Noveltie and pleasingnes of his Music,
and Poesy, he insinuated his Moral Precepts into the minds of men; and drew
them to a cheerful embracing of the same. This also he derived from the Church
of God; as elsewhere. So Vossius de Philosophorum Sectis C. 3.. 4. speaks
concerning him: Orpheus was a Thracian. Many have writ in the days of old,
(...), Poems according to the Doctrine of Orpheus. Suidas, in (...), enumerates
some of them. The chiefest of these was named Onomacritus; who lived in the
times of Pisistratus's Sons. Of whom Tatianus, contra gentes, thus speaks:
(...) etc. Orpheus was contemporary with Hercules. But the Poems that pass
under his name, are said to have been composed by Onomacritus the Athenian, who
lived under the Government of Pisistratus's sons, about the 50 Olympiad. There
are many Fragments of the (...), which Henry Stephanus, in his Philosophic
Poesy, has collected together. But the most famous fragment is that in Justin
Martyr; in which there is somewhat of Abraham, and the Mosaic Tables of the
Decalogue.

. 6. Homer's choicest notions from Scripture.
Next to Orpheus we may add Homer; who lived about 150 years after the Trojan
war, not far from the Age of the Prophet Esaiah, as Carrion Chron. lib. 2. That
Homer was in Egypt, is generally confessed by such as have written his life, So
also Grotius on Mat. 10.28. says, that Homer was in Egypt is evident etc. Yea
Sandford Descens. l. 2.. 37. thinks that Homer was born, and bred in Egypt.
Egyptum -- ubi and natum Homerum cum Heliodoro suspicor, and eruditum plane
videor. Sandf. Descens. l. 1.. 37.
That Homer had many of his Fictions from some real Scripture Tradition, which
he gathered up whilst he was in Egypt, we may safely conjecture, even from his
style and the Affinity of many of his expressions with the Scripture Language.
Thus Ralegh, Hist. Part. 1. B. 1. C. 6. Sect. 7. It cannot be doubted, but that
Homer had read over all the Books of Moses, as by places stolen thence, almost
word for word, may appear; of which Justin Martyr remembers many, in the
Treatise Converted by Mirandula. For the more full evidence whereof see Duports
Gnomologia, or parallel 'twixt Homer and the Scripture; also Bogan's Homerus
Hebraizans.

. 7. Hesiods Poems from Scripture.
Next to Homer follows Hesiod; who is said to live, 100 years after Homer,
somewhat before the Babylonian Captivity. Carrion ( Chron. lib. 2.) tells us, he
was a Priest of the Muses Temple in Helicon. His Poems contain partly
Discourses of Morality, partly a description of the year, or, as we phrase it,
a Calendar: for such was the Learning of the Ethnic Priests. -- He received
the chiefest part of his Learning from the Phenicians and Egyptians; unto whom
many of the Grecians sailed. They write that Hesiod being old was slain etc.
That Hesiod received some of his choicest Traditions from the sacred Oracles,
if not immediately yet originally, will appear probable to any that shall take
the pains to draw up the parallel. I shall only mention a particular or two; as
his description of the Chaos (...) etc. first of all the Chaos was produced,
etc. where he seems to give a description of the first matter or Chaos, exactly
parallel to the Mosaic Delineation thereof, Genesis 1.2. And indeed the whole of
his (...) or Genealogy of the Gods seems to be but a corrupt Imitation of
Divine Persons, Actions, and stories, as before.

. 8. A second Demonstration from the first occusion of all Poesy; which was
the stupendous works of God.
Having demonstrated the Traduction of Pagan Poesy from Divine Oracles, by
showing what recourse the first Inventors thereof had to the Phenicians,
Egyptians, and originally to the Jews; we now proceed to a second
Demonstration, namely to evince the same from the original ground (styled in
the Schools the procatartick cause) of all Poesy; which we doubt not but to
prove, was one and the same both in Divine and Human Poesy. As to the original
ground and first occasion of all Poesy, it sprang from the stupendous
Miracles, and affecting Providence, which God vouchsafed the infant state of
his Church and People, for their security and encouragement. Illustres illae
Mosis Victoriae adhuc recenti memoria celebres magis inaotuisse putandae suat,
etc. Sandford de Descens. l. 1.. 12.
For (as hereafter) the first Ages, after Gods delivering his People out of the
Egyptian bondage, being filled up with admirable effects, and wonderful
passages of Providence, which God was pleased to afford the infant state of his
Church, for the confirmation of her Faith, and to give the whole world ocular
demonstrations or sensible experiments of his Deity, and Providence; the sense
and apprehension of such wondrous issues of Providence, could not but make a
deep impresse, on the tender and soft Affections of his own People, in whose
behalf these signal providence were vouchsafed. Now the Church, in this her
Childish state, (like Children who are much affected with wonders) being struck
with the sense of these prodigious Appearances of Divine power in her behalf;
and having her Affections much stirred and moved hereby, was not able to
contain her self within bounds, (for Affections melted are very diffusive)
without venting her self in Poetic Hymns and Raptures. For Affections are the
greatest Wits that may be, and delight to vent themselves in Poesy; which is a
Witty Art, or rather passion; and therefore the most expressive of
extraordinary and choicer Affections. Alas! who so dull or phlegmatic, but
can, upon some more than ordinary experiments of Divine Providence, find some
poetic strains to vent his more warm and melted Affections in and by? Thus
much Experience learnes us, that where any extraordinary occasion happens for
the moving the Affections, especially Admiration, Love, Joy, or Sorrow; there
this Poetic vein is most pregnant and ripe. For as speech was given to man for
the communicating his conceptions or mind unto others; so Poesy (which is the
most witty and affectionate speech) seems for the more lively representation of
our choicer Apprehensions and Affections, stirred up by some extraordinary
events or experiments of Providence. This seems to be the genuine and original
ground or occasion of all Poesy, especially sacred. For we find in Scripture,
that the People of God, having received signal and unexpected deliverance,
found no more proper method for the celebrating of the same, than by spiritual
Hymns or Psalms, which are Divine Poesy. Of this sort were the Songs of
Moses and Miriam, Exodus 15.1.20. which, so far as we can learn, were the first
pieces of Poesy the world was made partaker of, and what the occasion hereof
was, is very plain; viz. Gods wonderful deliverance, vouchsafed the children of
Israel at the red sea. So likewise we find many other parcels of Sacred
Scripture, which were intended as commemorations of signal providence written
in verse. Thus was it usual with those Divine Writers, upon any extraordinary
Experiments or Observations of Divine Providence, to give lively expressions
thereof by extemporary Hymns, or Poems, as Judge. 5. 1 Samuel 2. Luke 1.46.68.
with other Scriptural Hymns and Songs, which were the ordinary effects of
extrordinary and astonishing Providence.

And as this gave the first occasion or rise to all Divine Poesy, so also to
all human and pagan. For what was it, that at first brought in the use of
Poesy amongst the ancient Heathen, but certain Experiments and Traditions of
the stupendous operations of God, which the first fabulous Poets Linus,
Orpheus, Homer, and Hesiod, having gleaned up in Phenicia and Egypt, made the
foundation and matter of their poetic fictions. This before we (. 3.) hinted
out of Iackson, who proves, that the chiefest part of those fabulous
Narrations, and feigned stories, with which the first Poets stuffed their
Writings, had their foundation in, and rise from those extraordinary issues of
Divine Providence, which the great God vouchsafed in the behalf of his Church
etc. To which we may add, that Satan (who greatly affects to be Iehova's Ape)
not only adulterated the miraculous Providence of God, by turning them all
into Grecian Fables, but also counterfeited the like, thereby to render himself
the more venerable. We have a full instance hereof in the Egyptian Magicians,
who counterfeited the miracles done by Moses. Thus also, as God vouchsafed his
Church and People many glorious Apparitions and manifestations of himself,
either by the second Person in the Trinity his assuming a transient corporeal
form; or by created Angels, as Genesis 28.17,18,19. where Jacob had an Apparition
of God, and thence called the place Bethel etc. So also the Devil, in imitation
of God's Apparitions, appeared in sensible forms and shapes to his Devoti, who
therefore erected their Baetylia, or pillars of Stone, in commemoration of
their Demon's Apparition, and that in imitation of Jacob's Bethel; as before c.
7.. 8. Thus Iackson, on the Scriptures, fol. 34. Whence came this conceit, of
God's appearing in sensible shapes, into Homer's, and other ancient Poets
heads? surely, as God had spoken in diverse manners unto the old world, so he
appeared in diverse forms unto the Israelites. And as the Devils had
counterfeited Gods manner of speaking to his People, so did they the manner of
his, or his Angels Apparitions. Thus did the Devil appear in the shape of
Castor and Pollux to the Romans etc. By which we come to understand whence the
Poets (...) Epiphanies, or Apparitions of their Gods had their Original.
Proportionable whereto, it would be no difficult matter to show, how the chief
Heads or common places of Poetic figments had their foundation and rise from
some sacred story of persons or things taken up, by I know not what, Satanick
imitation and Tradition. But of this more hereafter.

. 9. 3. Demonstr. from the Impulsive cause of all Poesy, which was Admiration.
Having gone through the Procatartick cause, or occasional ground of all
Poesy, both Divine and Human, we now proceed to its Impelling cause; thence to
demonstrate the derivation of Human Poesy from Divine. As the prodigious
astonishing Providence and Apparitions of God, in the behalf of his Church,
were the first occasion of all Poesy both Human and Divine; Divine Poesy from
Admiration.
so the immediate impulsive cause thereof was Admiration, with other suitable
Affections. And look by how much the more stupendous and amazing the Objects of
Admiration are, by so much the more violent will its impulsion on the Soul be.
Whence it could not be, but that the astonishing amazing Providence of God,
vouchsafed to his Infant Church, should fill the world with great admiration,
and other Affections correspondent therewith: and hence the Soul being impelled
by Admiration, found no way so proper to vent it self, as by Poetic Raptures,
and Hymns. Thus it was with Divine Poets; and thus also with Pagan. And by how
much the more admirable the Subject to be expressed was, by so much the more
studious and accurate these first Poets were, to deliver their matter in such a
form and manner, as should be most acceptable and pleasing. Hence we find the
more Affectionate parts of Divine Scripture, to be delivered in Verse; which
method was also imitated by the first Ethnic Poets: whence Jackson, on the
Scriptures, fol. 43. observes, that the reason why Divine Poems are so rare now
adays is, because the World being so far degenerate and drencht in Atheism,
our Senses are not moved with the admirable products of God's power; nor our
minds bent to observe the ways of his Wisdom, so as to be stricken with the
true Admiration of them. Whereas in the Worlds Infancy (when Atheism had so
little rooting) the Senses and minds of men were more struck with the Admirable
Experiments of Divine power; whence flowed deep Admiration, and commotion of
Affections, which are very witty and natural Poets. Neither was it Admiration
in general only, which we make to be the first impulsive cause of Ethnic
Poesy, Ethnic Poesy from Admiration of Divine Operations.
but a particular Admiration of those great amazing providence, which also
gave the first occasion to Divine Poesy. For the first Greek Poets, Linus,
Orpheus, etc. living in the Ages immediately following (if not in the same)
those, wherein God wrought such Miracles for his people the Israelite, we
cannot rationally presume, but that they must have some Notices of those
miraculous Operations of God, which could not but fill them with Admiration,
and thence impel them to vent the same in their Poetic strains, as before.

. 10. 4. Demonstr: The parallel betwixt Pagan Poesy and Divine, as to their
ends.
The Traduction of pagan Poesy from Divine, may be farther demonstrated from
their parallel Ends and Designs. We might draw the parallel betwixt Pagan
Poesy and Divine, in many secondarie lower ends: as they both agree in this,
that they were intended, by their first Inventors, 1. to give lively colors and
representations unto things: 2. to express our choicest conceivings, and most
raised Affections, in the most pleasing and taking manner etc. But to let pass
all lower ends; the Agreement of Ethnic Poesy with Divine in the supreme end,
though in relation to a different Object, sufficiently argues the Traduction of
the former from the latter. The main end and supreme intendment of Divine
Poesy was, to celebrate the great name of God, appearing in the stupendous
operations of his hands; and thereby to maintain his Adoration and Worship in
the world. This is evident by all the sacred Hymns, Psalms, and other Poetic
strains in Scripture. Now that all Ethnic Poesy had, at least in its first
rise, the same supreme end, though misplaced on a false object, or Idol, is
evident. Strabo ( lib. 1.) acquaints us, that the great design of their first
Poets, was (...) etc. gently to allure and draw on the people to a Reverence
and Adoration of the Gods. And indeed the Greek Idolatries and Superstitions
were never formed or shaped to any perfect stature, till the Poets came into
play, namely Linus, Orpheus, Amphion etc. especially Orpheus, who, by the
noveltie and pleasingnes of his Poesy, mixed with Music, insensibly drew, and
inveagled the minds of men into Idolatry. This seems apparently the design,
not only of Orpheus, but also of the rest of the first Poets; wherein indeed
they proved very succcesful: as it appears by their Poetic Theology, which
consists of nothing else but of fabulous Traditions of their Gods etc, in order
to the advancement of their Idolatrous worship and Superstition. Thus, as
Divine Poesy was calculated for the promoting of the true worship of God, so
Pagan for the Devils worship: yea, the latter seems to have been wholly taken
up in imitation of, and derivation from the former. For the Devil knew full
well, that God, out of infinite condescendings to the infant state of his
Church, was pleased to communicate to them this extraordinary gift of Poetic
Raptures and Hymns, thereby to render his Service more agreeable to them:
therefore he, out of an ambitious humor, woulds needs play God's Ape herein,
and communicate to his Devoti a Diabolick gift of Enthusiastic Poesy, thereby
to render his Idolworship more delight some and taking. Thus, as God was wont
to deliver his sacred Oracles in Ecstatick Poesy, so also the Devil his in
Diabolick Enthusiasmes: and both one and the other conspired in their supreme
End, which was the Establishment of their Service, and the Advancement of their
Names. Only the Devil, and his Idolizers, acted herein the parts only of
Blasphemers, Usurpers, and Apes of God. But of this more in the following
Section.

. 11. 5. Demonstr. From their parallel Form or Mode of Composure, which was by
Enthusiasme.
A fifth Demonstration, to evince the Traduction of the first pagan Poesy from
Divine, may be fetched from their agreement in the form and mode of Production
or Composure. We know, that the Form or Mode, wherein the first Divine Poesy
was delivered, was Enthusiastic. So the Songs of Moses, and Miriam, Exodus 15.1
were by Divine Afflation, or Extemporarie Enthusiasme. So 1 Samuel 10.5,6. 1 Samuel
10.5.6.
we find there mention made of a Music and Poetic meeting of the Prophets,
atttended with Enthusiastic Inspirations, and Prophecyings. It is conceived by
some, that those who are said to prophecy at these Meetings, were some of the
chiefest of them; who having their minds inwardly inspired, and agitated by an
Enthusiastic Divine Afflation, were thereby enabled to compose extemporarie
Hymns: so that being under a Divine Ecstasie, they were transported, beyond
the ordinary capacity of their natural Fancies, into a Rapture, for the
composing of such Hymns, as might most conduce to the celebrating the Name and
Honor of God. Hymni Paeanibus simillimi. Jul. Scalig. poet. l. 1. c. 45.
Such also were the Songs of Deborah and Barak, of Esaias, Si meon, and Anna,
Luke 2.25.36.
Luke 2.25.36. And we find the like exercise of this gift in the Church at
Corinth, 1 Cor. 14.26.
1 Cor. 14.26. where it seems evident, that those Hymns or Psalms, there
mentioned, were extemporarie, (as Grotius observes,) i.e. proceeding from an
Enthusiastic Afflation, or Divine Inspiration. Yea, Mede ( Diatribe 1. page
177.) interprets prophesying 1 Cor. 11.5. 1 Cor. 11.5.
to be singing of Psalms, or Divine Hymns; with this Observation, that a Poet
and Prophet were anciently terms equivalent, because Prophecies, both Divine
and Heathen, were delivered in Poesy. Now, in imitation of this ancient mode,
or form of Divine Poetic Enthusiasme, (or Enthusiastic Poesy,) the Devil
also vouchsafed his Poets (especially such as were immediately employed in his
Worship and Service) a Diabolick Afflation, or Enthusiasme. Thus the
Dithyrambus, or Song dedicated to Bacchus, was a kind of Enthusiastic Rapture:
and the Corybantes that sang it, are described as persons Ecstatick, or rather
phrenetick, and mad. So Strabo, lib. 10. (...): Enthusiasme seems to have a
kind of Divine afflation, and to come near the Prophetic kind. Yea indeed, as
in the Jewish Church a Poet and a Prophet were terms equipollent, so also in
the Pagans Temple. Tit. 1.12.
Whence Paul Tit. 1.12. calls the Cretian Poet a Prophet. So amongst the
Latins, Vates signifies both a Poet, and Prophet; because the Heathen Priests
and Prophets (in imitation of the Jewish) delivered their Oracles and
Prophecies, for the most part, in verse. And it is evident the Heathens
conceited their Poets to be divinely inspired, whilst they uttered Oracles
from, and Hymns unto their Gods: for they were herein transported, beyond the
power of sense or Reason, suitable to many Ecstatick Diabolick Enthusiasts of
latter Ages. Refert Pausanias in Phocaicis, primum omnium and praecipuum
certamen in Pythiis little fuisse, qui in Apollinis honorem (...) canerent.
Quippe ut (...) Baccho, Dianae (...) Cereri; ita (...) Apollini proprius fuit,
and primus qui in ejus laudem solum modo concinnabatur. Dickins. Delph.
Phaeniciz. cap. 6.
These Enthusiastic Poets had Hymns of all sorts; some dedicated to their
particular Gods, as (...) to Diana, (...) to Ceres, (...) to Bacchus, (...) to
Apollo, (...) to Adonis.

The chief of these Grecian Hymns was Paean, which consisted chiefly of that
solemn Acclamation (...), Ie, Ie, whereunto some prefixed Eleleu, and so sung
Eleleu Ie, which is the very same with the Hebrew Hallelujah. Epinicia erant,
quae in certaminibus victori canebant. Paeanes, quibus gratulabantur Diis
immortalibus pro victoria. Jul. Scalig. Poet. lib 1. cap. 44.
Thus Sandford, de descensu l. 1.. 5. This whole mode of acclamation, whether
we pronounce it Eleleu jou, or Eleleu Hie, was taken from the Hebrew Sacreds,
viz. from Hallelujah. For we may not but confess, that the Greeks, in their
common sacreds, of Hallelu made Eleleu, and of Jah, Hie; the Accent being
traduced on the first letter, according to the Grecian mode. Thus also
Dickinson, Delph. Phoeniciz. c 6. Before Paean, they were wont to pronounce the
solemn (...), or acclamation, (...); to which they added (...), or (...). That
(...) or (...), is the same with (...) Jah, Gods name, is evident from that of
Hesychius. (...).
Now what can we imagine this Eleleu Ie, or Eleleu Iou, in the beginning to
have been, but the Hebrew (...) Hallelu jah: which formule of words the Hebrews
were often wont to use in their Hymns; in the beginning, by way of
exhortation; in the end, as an acclamation. In imitation whereof, the Greek
(...), was both the (...), i.e. the exhortation of the Paeanisme; as also
(...), and (...), the Epode, and Acclamation, with which the Hymn was
concluded. See more of this in what precedes B. 2. c. 4.. 2. 3. and c. 9.. 1.
The Grecians had also their solemn Hymns for their Gods: some dedicated to
the propitious Gods, which the old Greeks called (...), and the Latins properly
indigitamenta, and carmina calatoria; others they had to their Vejoves, or
laeva numina, which the Greeks called (...), and the Latins Carmina
Averruncalia. Thus the old Romans had their Assamenta; which were Hymns
particularly made and sung to the honor of some peculiar God; whence the
Assamenta Janualia, Junonia, etc. These Diabolick Hymns some, on probable
conjectures, conceive to have been inspired by Satan (as many other parts in
Pagan Worship) in imitation of those Enthusiastic Hymns, which were in use
amongst the sacred Prophets and Poets, as before 1 Samuel 10.5,6. See more of
this Stillingfleet Origin. S. Book 2. chap. 2.

. 12. Plato's discourse of Enthusiastic Poesy examined and parallelized with
Divine Poesy.
But none treats more accurately and fully of Ethnic Poesy, its original
form or mode of production, than Plato; whose Discourse hereof, being examined
and parallelized with Divine Poesy, will give us a full Demonstration, that
the former was but a corrupt imitation of the latter. Plato indeed, supposes
all Poesy to have been, in its original, (...), an Enthusiastic imitation, or
Divine Enthusiasme; whereof he treats at large in his Io: where, being about to
explicate the Divine force of Poesy, under the person of a certain Rhapsodus
named Io, he shows, that Poesy came not by Art, but (...), by certain Divine
Enthusiasme etc. Now that this whole Discourse of Plato, touching the original
of Poesy, was but a Satanick imitation of and derivation from sacred Poesy
and Oracles, we shall endeavor to evince from the Severals thereof.

1. The Greek Rhapsodist from the Jewish Psalmodist.
The very Title of this Discourse carries somewhat of Sacred and Divine in it.
For (...) is but the contract of (...), the name which the Grecians gave to
God, answerable to the Hebrew Jah, as before. Plato in Ione, (...) non solos
cantatores, aut recitatores (...), sed and interpretes agnoscit. Eosdem vero
non modo (...), sed (...) quoque dictos legere est: (...), and (...): quippe
cum Scipionibus prodibant rubris, qui Iliadem profitebantur. Jul. Scal. Poet.
l. 1. cap. 41.
This Io, Plato makes to be (...), one of their Rapsodi, (who were also called
(...), because they carried rods, which were the Ensigns of their Art,) whose
Office it was to recite and interpret Heroic Verses, especially those of
Homer, as Serranus observes here. And Strabo, lib. 1. giving us an account of
the original of the Grecian (...) Rhapsodies, says, that they were Poems which
were sung (...), on the rod, or wand, i.e. the Rhapsodists, holding a Rod, or
branch of Laurel in their hands, (as Plutarch) sung Homers Iliads to the Harp,
as Hesiod's (...). For Poems amongst the old Greeks were (as the same Strabo
lib. 1.) but (...), Lessons fit to be sung by the Rhapsodists. Whence their
(...), and our English Rhapsodies. Thus much for Plato's Rhapsodist, which
seems exactly parallel to, and but an Ape of, the Jewish Psalmodist, whose
office it was to sing those sacred Hymns or Psalms, which were composed by
the Prophets, upon some Music instrument. This also seems to have been the
office of the Sons of the Prophets. By which it seems very probable, that the
Greek Rhapsodies and Rhapsodists, were but Satanick Imitates of the Hebrew
Psalmodies, and Psalmodists etc. Yea, the very name (...), whence Rhapsodie
comes, owes its origination to the Hebrew (...) Ode, as before.

2. Poesy an art of imitation.
But to pass on to the inwards and heart of Plato's Discourse touching Poesy,
its original etc. First he shows (in his Io, fol. 532.) that Poesy was (...),
a graphick Art, or Art of Imitation. I am apt to think, he hereby refers to the
true original of all Poesy; namely, that it was but an artificial imitation of
Divine Poesy, and Oracles. For he could not but know that the main figments of
the Greek Poets, were but dark shadows or artificial imitations of real
stories, conveyed to them by Oriental Traditions. Without doubt Plato, who
lived so long with the Jews in Egypt, could not but know, that most of those
fictions, wherewith the Poets had filled up their writings, were but imitations
of real effects and stories, exhibited in those Oriental parts, especially
amongst the Jews: whence he styles all Poesy a Graphick Art, or Artificial
imitation, i.e. of real Events, Persons, and Things, conveyed to them by
Oriental Tradition.

3. Poesy, not an Art, but Divine Afflation.
The principal thing that Plato undertakes to prove is, that Poesy properly is
not an Art, either Natural, or Acquired, but (...), a Divine power, or
Afflation; such as was in Euripides's his stone, called (...) (says he) (...).
Plato Jo. fol. 533. Whence he adds, that Poets being rapt into an ecstatick
fury, like unto that of Bacchus his Priests, were wont to Versifie. By which
we see how the Devil, in the Effusion of his Poetic Oracles, affected an
Imitation of Gods Divine Afflation, or Enthusiasme, vouchsafed his Prophets.
Thence Plato ( Jo fol. 538.) adds, that a Poet was a volatile, yet sacred
Person, (...); neither could he versifie before he was, (...), enthusiastically
inspired by God. He farther adds, that he must be (...) phrenetick and
ecstatick. Which is exactly parallel to the Scriptures character of sacred
Poets and Prophets; and their ecstatick enthusiasmes. Yea, yet farther, he
says: These Poets could not versifie by Art, (...), but this faculty came by
a Divine Afflation, according to the Impulse of their Muse. And he proves, it
could not come by Art; because Art extends it self to all under that kind etc.
Wherefore he adds, that God uses Poets as Instruments, (...), But it is God
himself that speaks in them. Hence says he, 'Tynnichus composed the Poean, and
styles it (...). And lastly, he concludes with a pretty Allegory, concerning a
long chain or series of ecstatick Poets, drawn by Apollo, or their Muse, which
way he listed, (...), but God by all these draws the soul, which way he
lists, etc. Plato here (as Serranus observes) makes God, under the assumed
names of Apollo and Musa, (...) the principal and first efficient of all
Poesy, by virtue of whose Divine Inspiration, the most unskilful if good men,
sometimes are enabled to versifie: whence that common Proverb, An Orator is
made, but not a Poet. Iccirco igitur invocant poctae Musas ut furore imbuti
peragant quod opus erat. Jul. Scalig. Poet. l. 1 c. 2.
Hence also that of Plato, (...), Poesy is an enthusiastic Madness and
Imitation. The like is asserted by Aristotle, Rhetor. lib, 3. cap. 7. (...),
wherefore enthusiasme is very agreeable to Poesy: for Poesy is a Divine
Rapture. Thence also it was, that Homer begins his Iliads with (...), calling
upon his Muse for Divine Inspiration, with confession afterward, (...), that
all Prophecy and Divine Inspiration is from God. So Ovid. Est Deus in nobis
agitante calescimus illo,
Impetus hic sacrae semina mentis habet.
To sum up this Demonstration. Its evident, by all that has been laid down,
that Pagan Poesy, according to its Original Form, Mode, or manner of
Production, was judged to be, not so much an Artificial or Natural Art, but the
Product of a Divine Afflation, or Inspiration; though indeed it were no other
than the issue of Diabolick Enthusiasme; whereby the Devil, under the names of
Apollo, Musa, etc. vented his Effusions and Oracles in imitation of that Divine
Poesy and prophecy, wherein the sacred Oracles and Hymns of God, were
delivered by his prophets, under Divine Afflation or Enthusiasme.

. 13, Sixth Demonstration from the matter of Pagan Poesy. Theologick. Primum
eum Theologorum: cujusmodi Orpheus and Amphion quorum opera tam Divina fuerint,
ut brutis ^ebus etiam mentem addidisse tredantur Jul. Scal. Poet. l. 1. c. 2.
Philosophic.
A sixth rational Argument to evince the Traduction of Pagan Poesy from Sacred
Oracles, may be drawn from its matter; which may be distributed into
Theologick, Philosophic, and Historick. The first and original matter of
Poesy was Theologick; namely, touching the (...), the Genealogies of the Gods,
their Metamorphoses, Apparitions, Oracles, and Worship; which were all taken
up, and brought in by Satan, the God of this World, in Imitation of the true
God, his Apparitions, Oracles, and Worship, as has been at large demonstrated
in the foregoing Book. This Theologick Poesy was introduced by Orpheus,
Amphion, and those other great Promoters of Idolatry as before,. 5. etc. 2. As
for Philosophic Poesy, it is either, 1. (...) Physiologick; which treats of
the origin of the Universe, the Chaos, the Principles of Nature, etc. Of which
sort are (besides somewhat in Hesiod of the Chaos) the Poems of Empedocles,
Nicander, Aratus, Lucretius, etc. All which Poetic Physiologizings were but
corrupt imitations of, and Traditions from Moses's description of the Creation,
Genesis 1. as it shall be made evident in the following Chapter. 2. Another branch
of Philosophic Poesy is (...) Ethick; which treats of Personal Morals; of
which Phocylidess, Pythagoras, Theognis, and others writ; who, we need no way
doubt, received their choicest Materials from the Divine Ethics of Moses, Job,
David, and Solomon. 3. As for (...) Oeconomick Poesy, taught by Hesiod, etc.
also 4. (...) Politic Poesy, used by Solon Tirteus, etc. it is as evident they
had their Original from Moses's Oeconomicks, and Politics: of which hereafter.
3. We now come to Historick Poesy; which is either Mythologick, simple, or
mixed; and all but traduced and borrowed from Divine Stories, as in the
following Chapter.

. 14. Seventh Demonstration from the several kinds of Pagan Poesy.
Lastly, I shall a little consider the several kinds of Pagan Poesy, and
thence endeavor to demonstrate its Traduction from Divine Poesy and Prophecy.
Plato gives Poesy a threefold Distribution. 1. Into (...), a simple narration:
2. (...), into mimetick Poesy. 3. (...), into that which is mixed of both. Thus
Plato de Repub. 3. fol. 392. We shall treat only of Mimetick Poesy: which the
Platonists distribute into (...) Eicastick, and (...) Fantastic. Eicastick
Poefie its original and parts.
The Original of Eicastick Poesy they make to be this. Oration or speech was
given by God to man, as a companion of his Reason, to the intent that he might
the more variously and happily express his conceptions, either for Necessity,
or common Conversation, as in civil Discourse; or for delight and ornament, as
in Poesy: which was at first instituted, as well to delight, as to teach; or
else to teach with delight; according to that of Horace, Docere volunt and
delectare poetae.
And the delights or suavities, which attend the teachings of Poesy, arise
from its Eicastick Art or skill in Imitation: whence also Eicastick Poesy
received its origination; namely, (...) from (...), to make; and (...), from
(...), an Image; because its main use lies in framing Images, and pleasing
representations of persons or Things. Now this Image-making Poesy, seems
evidently an imitation of sacred Images, Figures, and Types, so common in the
Jewish Church. Yea (as we have elsewhere proved) all the Egyptian
Hieroglyphics, and Grecian Symbols, or Images, seem no other than corrupt
Imitates of Jewish Types, and Figures. That Eicastick Poesy had its original
from Sacred Types, may be evinced from the severals thereof, as from Epicks,
Lyricks, Epigrammes; but especially from Comedies, and Tragedies. Of Comedies
and Tragedies, their original etc.
For a Comedy, as the name imports, was a song or hymn sung in their
villages: and a Tragedy (according to the import of its name) a Poem sung at
the sacrificing of a goat, etc. and both allusions to the Jewish Festivals and
hymns, whence they were borrowed, as elsewhere. Laertius tells us, that about
the 50th Olympiad, Thespis began to present Tragedies etc. And the people were
much taken with the Noveltie of the thing; for as yet there were no contentions
therein. At last Solon absolutely forbad him to teach or act Tragedies;
conceiving their falsitie hurtful, etc. by which it appears that Tragedies and
Comedies came not in use, 'till after the Jewish Learning was diffused thorough
Greece. Fantastic Poesy.
2. Fantastic Poesy is that, which altogether feigns things; and those for
the most part uncomely, or at least things comely in an uncomely manner. Such
are your Romances, which so much please the wanton wits and humors of this
corrupt Age. This kind of Poesy was greatly disliked by Plato ( de Rep: lib.
3. fol. 385.) who much disproved three things particularly in these Fantastic
Poets. 1. The Subject of their Poesy; which, says he, is not the truth it
self, but some (...) Idols only. 2. The Form of their Poems. 3. (...), the
manner of their singing, or (...). Whence he makes a Law in his Ideal Common
wealth, that such Romantic Poets, inasmuch as they corrupted the Simplicity
and Gravitie of Morals, should have no room in his Common wealth; but should
be, though with an honorable dismission, expelled. So Plato de Repub. 10.
(...). That no one embrace this kind of mimetick Poesy, because it corrupted
moral conversation. This Mimetick Poesy Plato styles Tragic: whereof he makes
Homer to be the first Parent. His own words are these: (...). May we not then
make all the Mimetick Poets to spring from Homer, who imitated the Idols or
pictures of virtue, and of other things on which they versified, but never
touched on the truth. This made Plato so much cry down Homer, and Hesiod;
because they wholly busied themselves about the phantasmes or pictures of
Truth, but regarded not the Truth it self. Yea, he comes to this general
conclusion, (...), that all Poets were but Hypocrites, or Stage. plaiers, in
that they only personated things, and embraced (...), false Images and Idols
without ever handling (...), the true Affections of things. That which made
Plato so severe against these fantastic Romantic Poets, was their dwelling
wholly upon Fables, without regard to those original Traditions or sacred Ideas
of Truth, from whence these Fables were derived.

Thus we have shown, how the ancient Heathen Poets stole their choicest Poetic
Fictions, both matter, and form, from the sacred Oracles; according to that
great Aphorism of Justin Martyr, who, speaking of the Gentile Poets, says:
(...): We think not the same with others; but they all imitating ours, (i.e.
the Scriptures) speak the same with us. That the Poets had many figments and
Fables, in imitation of the Jewish Messiah his Nativitie, Passion, and
Ascension up to Heaven, see what follows chap. 5.. 7. 8. Also their fictions of
the Creation and first Chaos etc, see chap. 3. Their fables of Adam his state
of Innocence etc, see chap. 4. Their figments of Man's Fall etc, see chap. 5.
Their fictions of Noah's flood, see chap. 6. Farther, what their Fables were of
the worlds conflagration, last Judgment etc, see chap. 7. Lastly, their
fabulous narrations of the Giants wars etc, see chap. 8.

CHAP. II. Of Pagan History, and its Traduction from sacred Records.
The Traduction of Pagan History from Sacred, is demonstrated; 1. from the
ancient Historiographers, 1. Phenician, as Sanchoniathon etc. 2. Egyptian, as
Manethos, and Hermes. 3. Chaldean, as Berosus etc. 4. Grecian, as Cadmus,
Milesius, Eumelus, Hecataeus, Aristeas, Pherecydes, Lerius, and Diodorus. The
2d Demonstration from the matter of pagan History, and its parallel with many
Matters, storied in Scripture. Eusebius's great design to prove, that Ethnic
Historians traduced their chief materials from sacred Records. Cleodemus's
imitation of Moses. Also Diodorus and Strabo mention many pieces of Moses's
History. Pagan Chronology derived from Scripture account of Times. Pagan
Geographie from sacred. Iapetus from Japhet, Chemia from Cham, Cadmus from
Cadmonim. Genesis 15.19. From Hermon Jos. 11.3. came Harmonia. Moses's Geographie
the most perfect Idea of all other Mythologick History not merely feigned, but
Fables of real stories. Its original ground was Gods miraculous works, storied
in Scripture, or conveyed by Tradition etc.

. 1. Saered History the original Idea and Springhead of all Pagan; which is
demonstrated,
HAving gone through Poesy, which is generally esteemed the most ancient of
Grecian Literature, we now pass on to History; wherein, we no way doubt, but
to give evident Demonstration of its Traduction from sacred History. That
sacred Scripture-Historie was most ancient, and that which gave the original
Idea and platform to all Pagan History, we shall endeavor to evince by
several Demonstrations.

1 From an inquiry into the originals of all pagan History.
1. This may be demonstrated by a particular examen or Inquisition into the
most ancient Pagan Historiographers, and pretenders to Antiquity. Amongst
Historians, the Grecians come so far short of any real pretension to precedence
herein, as that there is no one amongst them, who is not 500 years and more,
younger than the Trojan war. And indeed, they themselves ingenuously
acknowledge themselves to be, as to all Records of Antiquity, much younger
than the Barbarians. Whereby we must understand the Phenicians, Egyptians,
Chaldeans, and originally the Jews; whose sacred Oracles, and Ecclesiastic
History, was the Spring head of all that followed.

Phenician History from Scripture.
The first piece of pagan History seems to have been seated amongst the
Phenicians, who had amongst them two famous Historiographers, Sanchoniathon,
and Mochus. Sanchoniathon (who is by Bochart supposed to have been more ancient
than the Trojan war) writ in the Phenician tongue an History, partly Mythick
and Theologick, touching the Theogonie or Genealogy of the Gods; and partly
Natural, touching the first origin of the Universe, the Chaos, etc. The
materials, he confesses, he had from the Priest of the great God Jao, or Jeno,
i.e. Jehovah, the God of Israel, whom the Pagans called Jao, as before B. 2. C.
1.. 8. and C. 8.. 11. And that Sanchoniathon did really derive the choicest
parts of his Phenician History from the sacred Scriptures, we have elsewhere
sufficiently proved, by a parallel betwixt one and the other, according to what
fragments we find of Sanchoniathon in Eusebius. praepar. l. 1.10. out of Philo
Byblius his version. Thus Vossius de Histor. lib. 1. cap. 1. page 3. Greece
(says he) has none, who is not much younger than Sanchoniathon. Porpbyrie lib
4. adversus Christian. says, that Moses and Sanchoniathon gave the like
account of persons and places; and that Sanchoniathon extracted his account,
partly out of the Annals of the Cities, and partly out of the book reserved in
the Temple; which he received from Jerombalus, Priest of the God Jeno, i.e.
Jao, or Jehovah. The like we have proved of Mochus his Physiologick History,
in what follows of Phenician Philosophy. This Mochus continued Sanchoniathon's
Phenician History; his works were turned into Greek by Laetus: he is said to
be the first Founder of the Doctrine of Atoms; as hereafter.

. 2. The Egyptian Annals from Jewish.
But the great pretenders to ancient Annals and Records were the Egyptians; who
framed a monstrous Register or Account of Dynasts; even such, as if true, would
have extended beyond Adam. But this mistake Bochart (in a conference he was
pleased to favor me with) rectifieth, by showing, how these Egyptian Dynasts,
or Kings, could not possibly be supposed to have followed successively, (for
then they would have reached up even beyond Adam,) but were several Reguli, or
particular Dynasts, which governed at one and the same time several
principalities, (answerable to the Saxon Heptarchie:) so that the Egyptians,
out of a vainglorious humor, reckoned them as successive, who were
contemporarie. This Bochart farther confirmed, by showing, how the Egyptian
Gods, who were the most ancient of their Dynasts, extended not beyond Joseph,
Moses, etc. Others rectify these foul mistakes, touching the Egyptian Dynasts,
by showing, that the Egyptians reckoned their Dynasts according to the Lunarie
years, whereof 13 make but one entire Solarie year. See more fully of this,
Vossius de Idololatr. lib. 1. cap. 28. The Egyptian Dynasts were not
successive, as Manethos thought, but collateral, etc. But wheresoever the
mistake lies, it matters not: it seems probable, that these Egyptian Records
never publicly appeared in the world, at least in the Greek Tongue, till after
the LXX their Translation of the sacred Scriptures into Greek. Of Manethos's
^istorie.
For the first Egyptian Historian, we find any considerable mention of, was
Manethos, one of the Heliopolitan Flamens, who flourished under Philadelphus,
about the 130 Olympiad; and writ many things, as Eusebius praepar. Evang. lib.
1. thus. The Egyptian Manethos translated into Greek all the Egyptian history,
and all that belonged properly to the Theology of this Nation, compiled in the
sacred book which he writ, as in his other Commentaries. Vossius, Histor.
Graec. lib. 1. cap. 14. tells us, that by this sacred book of Manethos, must be
understood the History, which he composed at the command of Ptolomaeus
Philadelphus, wherein he begins from the most ancient and fabulous times, and
continues unto almost the times of Darius Codomannus, whom Alexander overcame.
And Eusebius, in his Chronicon, annotates on the 16th year of Artaxerxes Ochus,
( i.e. Olymp. 107.) etc. Manethos distinguished his History into 3 Tomes: the
first contained (...), the Dynasties of the Gods and Semi. Gods, in number
eleven: the second comprehended 8 Dynasties; the 3d two. Whence Manethos
traduced his History, he himself informs us; who says, (...), that in
writing his sacred books, he followed his Fore-father Hermes Trismegistus.
Eusebius, in his Chronicon, tells us, that Manethos extracted his History from
Pillars erected in the land of Seriadica; on which there were sacred notes
engraven, in a sacred Dialect, by Thout, the first Mercury. These Manethos
translated into Greek, and dedicated to Philadelphus. Josephus lib. 1. contr.
Appion, gives us some fragments of this Historiographer. We have also an
Epitome of this whole work, brought to light by Joseph Scaliger, in his notes
on Eusebius Chron. fol. 250. edit. 1a. It Is not improbable, that the ancient
Hermes Trismegistus, out of whose memoires Manethos is said to extract his
History, was either Joseph or Moses, as we have elsewhere proved. Touching the
ancient Hermes Trismegistus, see Stillingfleet Orig. S. book 1. c. 2. And it is
as probable, that Manethos had great assistance in compiling his History from
the sacred Scriptures, which had been newly translated into Greek, by the
appointment of Ptolomaeus Philadelphus. So Stillingfleet orig. S. lib. 1. cap.
2.. 8. etc. As for Manethos, and his History, it was published by the command
of Philadelphus, which might very probably be occasioned upon the view of that
account, which the holy Scriptures, being then translated into Greek, did give
of the world, and the propagation of Mankind; upon which we cannot imagine, but
so inquisitive a person as Philadelphus was, would be very earnest to have his
curiosity satisfied, as to what the Egyptian Priests could produce to confront
with the Scriptures etc. That the choicest parts of the Egyptian History, were
but broken Traditions of Jewish story, is hereafter demonstrated in the
Egyptian Philosophy etc.

. 3. The Chaldean Annals derived from the sacred Annals of the Jews.
The Chaldeans also were great pretenders to ancient Annals and Records: yea
there was (as Justin tells us) a great contest betwixt them and the Egyptians,
about the Antiquity of their Dynasties, and Records. But certain it is, the
Chaldeans may not compare with the Jewish Church, as to the Antiquity of
Records. For, albeit they had sufficient occasion given them for a contest in
this kind, from the Jews daily conversation with them in Babylon; yet the
first, that we find durst publish their Annals in Greek, was Berosus, who (as
Vossius Histor. Graec. lib. 1. cap. 13.) was borne two years before the death
of Alexander; and was only 64 years aged, when Antiochus (...) began to
reign; to whom he offered his Book, which he published in the time of
Ptolemaeus Philadelphus. Thus Vossius; who is herein followed by Stillingfleet,
Origin. S. Book 1. chap. 2. sect. 8.9.10. where he shows, how the Chaldean
Dynasties of Berosus, and the Egyptian of Manethos, were published about the
same time the LXX's Translation of the Bible was effected. And then he
concludes: Now for Berosus, that he published his History of the Chaldean
Antiquities, after the LXX's Translation, is evident, in that he dedicates it
to Antiochus (...). The like he adds, chap. 3.. 10. Now for Berosus, although
the Chaldeans had occasion enough given them, before this time, to produce
their Antiquities, by the Jews converse with them in Babylon; yet we find this
Author the first, that durst adventure them abroad in Greek. Now that Berosus
published his History after the LXX's Translation, is manifest etc. Though I
question, whether this Learned man's Assertion, [that Berosus published his
Annals after the LXX] can be clearly demonstrated: because Vossius ( de histor.
Graec. lib. 1. cap. 14.) makes him to be an old man, when Manethos was a Youth
etc. Yet this, I conceive, may be groundedly concluded, that both Berosus the
Chaldean, and Manethos the Egyptian Historiographer, in the composing their
Histories, could not but have much light, and assistance from the sacred
Records and Antiquities of the Jews, with whom they had daily conversation. For
as there were, about this time, many of the most learned Jews in Egypt, so also
at Babylon; where, after their return, they left three famous Schools, Sora,
Pompeditha, and Neharda: whence we need not to doubt, (as we have elsewhere
proved, viz. in the Chaldean Philosophy,) but that the Chaldeans received many
choice Traditions, and pieces of Antiquity. Yea, we find many fabulous
narrations in Berosus, relating to the Cataclysme, the Tower of Babel, etc.
which we cannot rationally conjecture, could have any other original Idea, and
spring head, but Scripture relation, or sacred Tradition; whereof we find very
many vestigia and characters, in those mythologick Historiographers, Berosus,
etc. though mixed with a world of their own figments. Neither need we suppose
these Traditions to have been derived to them by the Greek version of the LXX,
but by daily conversation with the Jews in Babylon, and Egypt. Yea, why may we
not assert (what we have elsewhere endeavored to prove) that the Egyptian and
Chaldee Tongues, differing from the Hebrew only in some Dialect; these Learned
men in both Nations, (as the Phenicians also,) might read the sacred Scriptures
(without much assistance) in its original Hebrew, without being obliged to any
Greek Translation or Interpretation. That the Chaldean Annals were conformable
unto, and derived from the sacred Annals of the Jews, I was informed by
conference with Learned Bochart, who proved his assertion out of Simplicius;
who makes mention of a Book of Aristotle's, wherein he relates, how he desired
Alexander to send him the Records of the Chaldeans; upon the view whereof he
found, that their Dynasties, or account of Times, contained but so many years
etc. which (said Bochart) answers to the Scriptures account of Times.

. 4. The Grecian Historiographie later than, and derived from the Mosaic.
We now pass on to the Grecian Records and Annals, wherein we doubt not, but
to give very evident notices and demonstration of their Traduction from Sacred
story, and Jewish Antiquities. Vossius, de histor. Graecis lib. 1. c. 1.
proves, that the Grecian Historiographers were much younger than Moses. For the
Grecians could not name any one Historian of their Nation, who was not more
than 500 years younger than the Trojan war. But Moses was more ancient, and
that by some Ages, as Pagan writers acknowledge; particularly Appion the
Alexandrine, who makes Moses to have lived in the time of Inachus: whence there
must be, betwixt the death of Moses and the destruction of Troy, no less than
685 years. But if we follow Eusebius, (as we ought,) Moses lived in the time of
Cecrops, the first Athenian King. And so Moses was 400 years younger than
Inachus; yet 285 years before the Trojan war. Yea, the same Vossius proves,
that not only the sacred Historiographers, but also the Phenician, Egyptian,
and Chaldean, preceded, by many Ages, the Greek Historians. For the Grecians
had nothing comparable for Antiquity to the Phenician Annals, composed by
Sanchoniathon; or to the Egyptian, which Manethos transcribed; or to the
Chaldean, collected by Berosus; not to name the fountains, whence these were
extracted. Justin Martyr assures us, that the Grecians had no exact History of
themselves, before the Olympiads: his words are (...); The Greeks had nothing
storied of them before the Olympiads. Yea Thucydides, in the beginning of his
famous History, confesses, that before the Peloponnesian war, which was waged
in Artaxerxes's and Nehemiah's age, he could find nothing, which he could
safely confide in, by reason of the extent of time. His words are, (...):
whence Learned Bochart, in the beginning of his Preface to his Phaleg,
collects, that all the ancient Greek Historians were but Mythologists,
fable-writers, or relaters of fabulous Traditions, which they had traduced from
the Oriental parts. So that the true and simple Greek History began, but where
the Sacred ended etc. The like is asserted by Stillingfleet, Origin. S. Book 1.
cap. 4. How far (says he) the Greek Historians are from meriting belief, as to
their account of ancient times, will appear to any that shall consider, 1. that
their most ancient Writers were Poetical, and apparently fabulous. 2. That
their Elder Historians are of suspected credit, even amongst themselves. 3.
That their best Historians either discover or confess abundance of Ignorance,
as to the History of ancient times etc. Greek Historians.
All this will be more fully evident, if we a little consider and examine some
of the most ancient Greek Historiographers, their Antiquity, etc. 1. Cadmus.
I shall begin with Cadmus Milesius, the son of Pandion, whom Clemens
Alexandrinus (...). lib. 6. calls (...), the ancient Cadmus, who is supposed to
have lived about the Trojan war; as Pliny lib. 7. cap. 56. But this, Vossius (
de Histor. Graec. lib. 1. cap. 1.) conceives to be a mistake, and therefore
inclines rather to the opinion of Josephus, who lib. 1. contra Apion. tells us,
that the first, who essaied to write History, were Cadmus Milesius, and
Acusilaus Argivus, who lived a little before the Expedition of the Persians
against the Grecians, etc. By which it is evident, that this Milesian Cadmus was
many Ages after the ancient Cadmus, who brought Letters out of Phenicia into
Greece. This Milesian Cadmus is supposed to have been the first, that left
behind him History in Prose. He is said to have written 4 Books, touching the
Edification of his own City, as also of all Ionia. 2. Eumelus.
2. To whom we might add Eumelus Corinthius, who lived about the 9th Olympiad;
whose genuine piece was (...), a precatorie Hymn of one entering into Delus:
whence Pausanias transcribed some things. To whom also is attributed the
Corinthian History. But of this Eumelus see more Vossius, Hist. Graec lib. 4.
c. 1. 3. Hecataeus.
3. Next follows Hecataeus the Milesian, who flourished in the beginning of
Darius Hystaspis, about the 64 Olympiad, as Suidas; who also makes him to have
been the Auditor of Protagoras, and to have led the way to Herodotus
Halicarnassus. Some make this Hecataeus the first that writ History in Prose;
as Pherecydes, the Syran, was the first, that writ, in prose, of the Gods, and
the Nature of things. 4. Aristeas.
4. To these we may add Aristeas Proconnesius, who writ in prose (...), the
Theogonie, or Genealogy of the Gods: also in verse 3 Books, wherein he
comprehended the History of the Hyperborean Arimaspes. He flourished about the
50 Olympiad, as Suidas. See more of him Vossius, Hist. Grae. l. 1. c. 5. 5.
Pherecydes Lerius.
5. The next we shall add, is Pherecydes Lerius, who flourished about the time
of Xerxes's expedition into Europe, (Olympiad. 75.) and was more ancient than
Herodotus, though younger than Pherecydes Syrus, with whom some confound him.
See Voss. Hist. Graec. l. 1. c. 1. 6. Diodorus.
6. As for Diodorus Siculus his history, it is much fabulous, or, as he himself
names it, (...), the ancient Mythologie, containing fabulous narrations of the
ancient Heroic times, or the great Exploits of the first great Heroes; wherein
there are to be found evident vestigia, or footsteps of sacred story, conveyed
to the Grecians by Oriental Traditions. And indeed, much of the first Grecian
History, as well as Poesy, was Mythologick or fabulous, relating to some real
story transacted or recorded in the Jewish Church, as will appear by what
follows. Thus we have dispatched our first Demonstration, touching the
Traduction of Pagan History from Divine; by showing, how all the first Pagan
Historiographers, both Phenician, Egyptian, Chaldean, and Grecian, were not
only much younger then, but also Imitators of, sacred Historiographers. This
will more fully appear in, and by the following Sections.

. 5. 2d. Demonstration from the matter of Pagan History, and its imitation of
Divine story
Our 2d Argument to demonstrate the Traduction of pagan History from Divine,
shall be taken from their parallel matter. That the ancient Ethnic Historians
traduced many of their choicest materials, especially of their Mythologie, from
sacred Ecclesiastic Records, is rationally evinced by the learned
Philologists, who have made inquifition hereinto. Eusebius Pamphilus his
design to prove, that Ethnic Historians traduced their choicest materials
from the sacred Records.
Amongst the Ancients, none have spent more elaborate studies herein than
Eusebius, (who flourished under Constantine, and was called Pamphilus, from his
friendship with Pamphilus the Martyr,) Bishop of Caesarea in Palestine, who
writ Chronicles from the beginning of the world, to the year of our Lord 326;
wherein his (...), or main design is to demonstrate, that the Mosaic Records
were more ancient, by far, than the origines of all the Egyptian, and Chaldean
Dynasties, or Grecian Antiquities; yea, than the (...), Genealogy of all the
fabulous Gods etc. In this Chronicon, he gives us abundant notices of his
indefatigable endeavors, and searches into the Libraries of Philosophers,
Historians, and Divines, not only Grecian, but also Egyptian, and Phenician;
thereby to convince the Gentiles of the prioritie of the Divine Records, as
also of the Traduction of their choicest Ethnic stories and Memoires from the
sacred Hebrew fountains. And this indeed he did most successefully accomplish,
both in this his Chronicon, also in his learned Commentaries de praeparatione
Evangelica; and in his 20 books Demonstrationis Evangelicae, whereof there are
now extant but 10: as Vossius de Hist. Grae. lib. 2. cap. 17. This noble
design of Eusebius has been carried on by many Learned Philologists of this
and the former Age, viz. by Joseph Scaliger, Vossius, Bochart, etc.

But to descend to particulars. That Sanchoniathon and Mochus amongst the
Phenicians, Manethos amongst the Egyptians, Berosus amongst the Chaldeans, and
the ancient Mythologick Historians amongst the Grecians, derived many of their
ancient Materials originally from the sacred Records, has been already in part
demonstrated, and will farther appear in what follows. I shall at present give
an instance or two more. 1. Cleodemus Malchus his imitation of Moses's history.
Vossius ( de Histor. Graec. lib. 4. page 510. Edit. 2a.) gives us an account
of one Cleodemus Malchus, who composed an History, according to the form, and
in imitation of the Mosaic; concerning which Alexander the Polyhistorian thus
speaks, in Josephus ( Antiquit. lib. 1. cap. 16.) (...) etc. Cleodemus the
Prophet, surnamed Malchus, who composed an History in imitation of Moses, the
Jewish Law giver, declares, that Abraham had some sons by Chetura, naming
three, particularly Aphera, Suris, Iaphra. From Suris, Assyria was so called;
from Aphera, and Iaphra, the City Aphra, and the Region Africa. By the conduct
of Hercules, these waged war against Libya, and Antaeus. Hercules also, by the
Daughter of Aphra, begat his son Dedorus, from whom Sopho sprang; whence the
Barbarians were styled Sophaces.

Diodorus and Strabo imitate Moses his History.
2. I shall add hereto what I find mentioned by Preston, on God's Attributes,
Sermon 3. page 54 etc. And for Abraham many speak of him, and also of Moses;
there are many that agree in their stories of him, but the Chaldee Historians
especially, and some of the ancientest Greek Historians. Diodorus Siculus
relates the history of him, (though mingled with falsehoods,) of what he did
in Egypt, and what Laws he gave the people, and how he cast out the Cananites;
and that he said, he received his Laws from a God called Jao; and that they
were such Laws, as separated that people from all others; and that his God was
such an one as could not be seen etc. And Strabo says, that he reproved the
Egyptians for worshipping visible Gods, and therefore he was cast out, and his
people with him, etc. We find also many other considerable passages of sacred
Records, though mixed with many fables, in Berosus, Hecataeus, Alexander the
Polyhistorian, Hieronymus Aegyptius, Mnaseas, and Abydenus, which we shall have
occasion to mention in the following chapters.

. 6. 3d. Demonstration from the form of Pagan History, which is simple, or
Mythologick.
A third Demonstration, to evince the Traduction of Pagan History from Divine,
may be drawn from its Form; which is either simple, or mythologick: whence
History, as to its formal constitution, is distributed into simple, and
mythologick. The chief parts of simple History are Chronology, and
Geographie, both of which owe their original to sacred Records.

Pagan Chronology derived from Scriptures.
1. As for Pagan Chronology, that it owes its original to sacred Annals, is
apparent by what has been formerly mentioned (. 3.) out of Aristotle; who, by
those Records he received from Alexander, of the Chaldean Dynasts, gives us an
account of times answerable to, and, as we may justly presume, in imitation of
the Scriptures account of Times. This also was the great design of Eusebius
Pamphilus in his Chronicon, wherein he makes the Mosaic account of Times, the
fountain and measure of Ethnic Chronology. We have an excellent observation
to this purpose given us by Learned Melancthon, in his Preface to Carion's
Chronicon; whose words are these: God would have the Beginnings, Instaurations,
and Conservation of human kind to be known by his Church. -- Therefore he would
also have an History written, and delivered to us by the Fathers, in the best
order, and most exact account of times. And this is the singular glory of the
Church, that no where else, in the whole mass of Mankind, there can be found a
more ancient series of Empires, and Times. Neither has any other Nation such
certain numbers of years passed, so exactly computed. -- And let the younger
Students consider, that Herodotus begins his History, where Jeremiah ends;
namely, in the King Aprye, who killed Jeremiah. Thus Melancthon. So also
Bochart, in his Preface to Phaleg. The Grecians, if they write History, as
soon as they rise up to the more ancient times, they presently fall into
Fables: and Thucydides confesses, he could know nothing certainly of things
before the Peloponnesian war, by reason of the Longinquitie of Time. Thus th.
Greek History began then, and there, when, and where, the Sacred left etc.
This very much demonstrates the Perfection, and Autiquitie of the Scripture
Chronology. But as for the Traduction of Pagan Chronology from Sacred, we
have it more fully demonstrated to us by Preston, of Divine Attributes, Sermon.
3. page 54.55. I will (says he) add to this but one Argument for the
Authority of the Scripture. Consider the exact Chronology which is found in
the Scriptures, and the agreement of them with the Heathen Histories. In latter
times, there have been great confusions: but the greatest evidence, that is to
be found, is the Table of Ptolomy lately found, which does exactly agree with
the Scripture. He exactly sets down the time, that Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus
reigned. -- So also the time when Jerusalem was taken; which compare with the
Scripture, and you shall find these agree with Daniel and Jeremiah. And this is
the greatest testimony the Scripture can have from Heathen men. Thus Preston.

. 7. Pagan Geographie from sacred Geographie.
A 2d part of simple History is Geographie, or the Description of Countries,
Cities, and other places; wherein also sacred Geographie, delivered in the
Scriptures, has had not only a precedence, but also a very great Ideal
causalitie on Pagan Geographie. Porphyry lib. 4. advers. Christian. tells, that
Sanchoniathon gave an account of Persons, and Places, conformable to that of
Moses; which account he received in part from Ierombalus, the Priest of Jeno,
or Jehovah: as before. 1. of this Chapter. This is incomparably well
demonstrated by Bochart, in his Phaleg; the design of which book is to show,
how the Geographick descriptions, which the ancient Pagan Historians give of
the dispersion of Noah's Posterity throughout the world, are exactly
conformable unto, and therefore, as we may regularly presume, derived from
Moses's Geographick narration of Noah's posterity their dispersion through,
and peopling of the world. Genesis 10. From Japhet, Iapetus etc.
So Phaleg lib. 3. cap. 1. Bochart proves, that from Japhet, mentioned Genesis
10.2. the Grecians refer their first Plantations and Genealogies to Iapetus,
whom they make to be the most ancient man; so that it passed even into a
Proverb, more old than Iapetus, or Iaphetus. Thus from Javan, Japhet's son,
Genesis 10.2. the Grecians derived their Ionians. Also from (...) Elisa, Javan's
son, Genesis 10.4 the Grecians traduced their Elis, Elysian fields, Hellas, and
Eolus; as Phaleg. lib. 3. cap. 4. So from Chittim Genesis 10.4. (...), the
Grecians named Citium, a City in Cyprus; as Phaleg. lib. 3. cap. 4. Thus from
(...) Tarsis, Genesis 10.4. came Iberis, or Spain; as Phal. lib. 3. cap. 7. The
like originations of Regions or Cities Bochart collects from the other sons of
Japhet. From Cham Chamia, etc.
He also demonstrates the same in Cham, and his posterity, who peopled Canaan,
Egypt, and Africa. Thus from Cham, Egypt is styled, in Plutarch, Chemia, for
Chamia, i.e. the land of Cham; as it is styled in the Psalms. And from Canaan,
the son of Cham, Genesis 10.6. Phenicia was called by the Grecians (...), which is
the contract of Canaan; thence in Stephanus the inhabitants of Phenicia, or
Canaan, are called (...), from (...) Chanaan; as Bochart Phaleg. lib. 4. cap.
34. Again, amongst the sons of Canaan, there were the Hivites, who inhabited
about the mount of Hermon, Josh. 11.3.
Ios. 11.3. and Judge. 3.3. which is in the Eastern part of Canaan, Psalm.
87.13. whence they are called Cadmonim, i.e. Orientals, Genesis 15.19.
Genesis 15.19. and Hermonijim, i.e. of Hermon, Psalm. 42.7. Hence the Grecians
called the chief Commander of this Phenician colonie, that came to build
Thebes, (...) Cadmus, and his wife, Harmonia, or Hermonia. And they feigned,
that both Cadmus, and Harmonia were turned into Serpents; because the name,
Hivite, according to the Hebrew, signifies a Serpent. Lastly, Moses tells us,
Genesis 10.13. Mizraim begat Ludim. From Misraim Egypt, and from Ludim Ethiopia
were so called. Answerable whereto Diodorus lib. 3. shows, what community
there was betwixt the Ethiopians, and Egyptians; and thence concludes, that
they were very near akin and allied: as Bochart, in his Preface to Phaleg,
about the middle. Thus has this Learned man demonstrated at large the parallel,
or rather samenesse, betwixt Sacred and Ethnic Geographie; whence we may
safely conclude the derivation of the latter from the former. And the same
Bochart, in his Preface to Canaan, (about the beginning) tells us, Moses's
Geographie most perfect.
that Moses, by Divine Revelation, approved himself more skilful in
Geographie, than either Homer, or Hesiod, or any of later times amongst the
Grecians. For he mentions more Nations, and those more remote by far. Neither
does it suffice him to name them, but withal he opens their original; showing
us in what Age, and from what Place, and upon what occasion, each were
dispersed into Countries most remote, even from the Caspian and Persick Seas to
the extreme Gades; and all this on one Chapter (Genesis 10.) and that obiter. Thus
Bochart: who is followed herein by Stillingfleet, Origin. S. book 3. c. 4.. 8.
The certainty of the Propagation of all Nations from the posterity of Noah is
evident hence, that in all that account, which the Scripture gives of the
propagation of Nations from the sons of Noah, there is some remainder in the
history of that Nation, to justify the reason of the imposition of the name,
from the names of the Nations themselves, which have preserved the original
name of the Founder in their own: as the Medes from Madas, the Ionians from
Iavan etc. Thus Stillingfleet. By all which it appears, that Sacred Geographie,
or the Scriptures account of the origin of all Nations from Noah's posterity,
is not only most certain, perfect, and ancient, but also the most perfect Idea
and measure of all Pagan Geographie.

. 8. Pagan Mythologick History from Scripture mysteries, and real events of
Providence.
Having gone through Chronology, and Geographie, (the chief parts of simple
History) we now proceed to Mythologie, another species of History, resulting
from its formal constitution. And indeed Mythologick History, as it was of all
most ancient, so was it most proper for the infant state of mankind, had it
been rightly (and according to its original Idea in Scripture) undertaken. For
in History, the form ought to be suited to its matter, as in Nature; not the
matter to the form, as in our Schools: wherefore the matter of the first
History being the wonders of Providence, with many Jewish Types, and more
sublime mysteries; no wonder, if the first Pagan Historiographers clothed such
mysterious, and, as to them, unintelligible matters with a mythologick form
and garb. Thus Strabo lib. 11. speaking of the ancient Records of the Syrians,
Medes, and Persians, tells us, that they gained no great repute in the world,
(...) etc. by reason of the Philomythie, or fabulous narrations of the
Historians. And Diodorus calls this Mythologick History (wherein he much
abounded) (...), the ancient Mythologie; which, he confesses, admitted of
great diversity, and thence obscurity; whereof he gives this reason, (...):
In the ancient fables, there is no umforme, and, in all things, agreeing
history to be expected. Thus Diodor. lib. 4. Wherein he grants, that the
history of ancient times was mixed with many fables, which yet had some
original Idea of Truth, unto which they related. Mythologick history not
merely fictitious, but fables of real truths.
Vossius ( de Histor. Graec. lib. 2. cap. 2.) makes an Apology for Diodorus
Siculus, and the rest of these ancient mythologick Historiographers, against
the imputations of Ludovicus Vives, and Bodinus; wherein he shows, how these
Mythologists, who delivered (...) mythick History, were not to be reputed as
merely fabulous, or feigned; for they had some historical truth wrapped up under
these fables delivered by them, as it is evident, by what is storied of the
Flood, and Tower of Babel by Berosus etc. Neither ought it to move us, that
these Mythologists differ amongst themselves in many things; for albeit these
fabulous narrations took their origin from some real story or truth, yet by
reason of the length of time, and the variety, and vanity of wits, it is no
marvel, if there be found some dissension, yea falsehood in mythick History. By
which its evident, that this mythologick History, though mixed with much
variety, vanity, yea falsehood, was but a corrupt imitation of some marvelous
issues of Providence; or some real story happening in, or about the Church of
God, and communicated to the Grecians, by Oriental broken Tradition. This may
be farther demonstrated by what Aristotle, in his Proeme to his Metaphysics,
(quoted by Stobaeus sermon. 3.) mentions, touching the original of Mythologie:
(...) etc. Men began to Philosophize from Admiraetion etc. then he concludes,
(...), a fable is composed of things wonderful. This holds true in mythologick
history as well, as Philosophy, the original of one and the other being the
same. For Mythologie, as well Historick, as Poetic, was founded on some real
event of Providence, or Scripture story, traduced by Tradition, as has been
well observed by Jackson on the Scriptures. fol. 47. where he acquaints us,
That from the true wonders of God storied in Scripture, and transacted in
Jurie, or thereabouts, the Medes, Persians, and Syrians were so much addicted
to fabulous narrations, which the first Ages were so much delighted in, and
thence were ambitious of coining the like wonders, as Strabo tells us. And
Greece, as it rereceived Artificial Learning from Asia, so did it drink in this
humor with it, whence sprang all that ancient mythologie. For the Scriptures
account of the Creation, Flood, Tower of Babel, with many other stories of
God's miracles, vouchsafed in the behalf of his people in Egypt, Jurie, and the
regions round about, having by some imperfect Traditions been far spread, when
Greece first began to affect fabulous relations; hence, as children
unacquainted with the real story, they made many additions of their own, and
applied those effects to many persons and things, which had no affinity
therewith: as it is common amongst men. Thus the reports of Gods miraculous works
of Creation, Providence, and Preservation of his Church (which were in that
infant state of the Church exceeding remarkable) flying up and down the world,
cut and mangled by artificial inlargements and alterations, those ancient Pagan
Historians, being possessed with a Curiosity, yet ignorant of the true causes,
and grounds of those extraordinary events, misapplied the same to unsuitable
matters, persons, and causes amongst themselves, which had no affinity
therewith; as in the foregoing Chapter.

CHAP. III. Moses his History of the Creation imitated by Pagans, etc.
The origin of the Universe proved, 1. by Testimonies, 2. by Arguments.
Plato's Ideas in imitation of Moses, Genesis 1.31. Gods real efficiencie expressed
by Pagans, as Gen 1.1. God's creating the Heaven how understood by Pagans. The
Gentiles derived their Chaos, and first matter from Genesis 1.2. (...) from (...),
Genesis 1.5. (...) from (...) (...). The Spirits forming the Universe, Genesis 1.2.
called by Plato the soul of the world etc. Hence proceeds the form of the
Universe, consisting in its order, perfection, and goodnesle, Genesis 1.31. which
Plato very far imitated. Moses's description of Light, Genesis 1.3. etc. (...)
signifies fire, out of which the Celestial Lights were framed: Genesis 1.14,15,16.
whence the Greek Philosophers traduced their notions, that the Sun and Stars
were fire. Genesis 1.5. the Night elder than the day. Genesis 1.6. the firmament
fluid matter, Water, or Air. From Genesis 1.16. the Sun was made Lord of Heaven
etc.

. 1. That the world had its beginning, as Genesis 1.1.
HAving given a general account of Pagan History, and its Traduction from
Sacred; we now proceed to demonstrate the same from particulars: and we shall
begin with some Pagan stories touching the origin of the Universe, which are
exactly parallel unto, and therefore, we need no way doubt, but were originally
derived from the Mosaic description of the Creation. And first, that the world
had a beginning, answerable to that of Moses, Genesis 1.1. In the beginning Est
(...) nomen abstracti^ a primitivo (...), quod caput significat, unde (...) non
simplex initium, sive ^rincipium significat, sed primum illud capitale, and
admirandam omnium rerum initium, quo exnihilo aliquid esse potentia Dei
ceperunt. P. Fagins Exeges. in Genesis 1.1.
etc. was generally asserted by all both Poets, and Philosophers, before
Aristotle. For that novel opinion, touching the eternity of the World,
Aristotle seems to ascribe to himself, as the first Founder thereof: whence
speaking of the ancient Philosophers, he says, (...), therefore truly they
all say the world was made. This is confirmed by Philoponus (de creatione
mundi,) who aslerts, that all before Aristotle asserted the origin of the
Universe. The same is affirmed by Bochart, as elsewhere. Aristotle's doubts or
objections against the origin of the Universe, see in his Top. 19. de coelo
1.10. wherein he confesses his contradiction to the Ancients, because he could
not (forsooth) bring his carnal reason to a compliance with Oriental Tradition
therein. For the great Hypothesis, on which the Ancients founded their
persuasions, touching the origin of the Universe, was not any humane argument
of their own, but some broken Tradition, originally sacred, which they gleaned
up in the Oriental parts. Thus Orpheus, Hesiod, Apollonius, Aristophanes,
amongst the Poets: and Thales, Pherecydes, Pythagoras, Numenius, Anaxagoras,
Anaximenes, Parmenides, Timaeus Locrus, Democritus, Empedocles, Xenophon,
Socrates, but none more fully than Plato, amongst the Philosophers. Also
Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, and Pliny, with others amongst the Historians; as
Euscbius Praepar. Evang. lib. 1. cap. 7. Owen Theolog. lib. 1. cap. 8. page 75.
And Strabo lib. 15. speaking of the Brachmanni, says, (...) etc. In many
things they have the same sentiments with the Grecians, that the world had its
beginning, and shall have its end; and that God, the framer and governor
thereof, influenceth the whole etc. Whence it appears, that it was the common
persuasion of the Grecians, (as well as of others) that the world had its
beginning. So the Egyptians, as Diogenes Laertius informs us, (prooem.)
constantly believed the same. That which made Aristotle (as we may justly
presume) disbelieve the same, was his vain philosophizing humor, which induced
him to reject all Oriental Traditions, which would not stoop to his reason etc.

. 2. Testimonies to prove, that the Pagan stories of the origin of the
Universe had their origin from Moses's description thereof, Genesis 1.
That these great Pagan Maxims, touching the origin of the Universe, had
their original by Tradition from sacred History, is sufficiently evident, both
by Authentic Testimony, and Rational Demonstration. As for Testimonies, we
shall begin with that of Johan: Grammaticus, de mundi creat. lib. 1. cap. 2.
page 4. where, speaking of Moses his description of the Creation, he adds,
(...), Plato teaching the production of the Universe by God, in many things
also imitates him, i.e. Moses etc. This is also most positively asserted by
Ludov. Vives de verit. fidei page 157. The production of the world (says he)
is so described by Moses, that the greatest wits have both admired its
profunditie, and embraced the truth of the narration. So the Pythagoreans, and
Plato, who follows them in his Timaeus, have followed the Mosaic description
of the world's procreation, almost in the same words etc. Yea Plato himself, in
his Timaeus, fol. 29. seems to acknowledge, that what notices he had of the
origin of the Universe, were communicated to him by some fabulous, or
imperfect Tradition originally sacred. His words are these. Its meet, that I
who discourse, and you who hear, remember we have but human Nature, and
therefore may expect concerning these things only (...), some probable fable,
or Tradition; neither is it lawful for us to enquire farther. Plato here
acknowledges, that concerning the origin of the Universe, we could have only
some probable fables, or Traditions, which were originally sacred. I shall add
hereto only the Testimony of Mestrezat, that great French Divine, in his
Treatise (on Heb. 11.2.) called, de la virtue de la foy, page 79. These
Egarements, or vain notions (says he) of the Philosophers, yea of the
principal, namely Aristotle, and the Stoics, touching an eternal first matter
etc, gives us sufficiently to understand, that they who have discoursed more
orthodoxly of the Creation, as Plato etc. derived that which they knew hereof
from the rays, which the Celestial Revelation had scattered amongst the sons
of Noah; or from Abraham and his Posterity, amongst the Syrians, and
Egyptians. Thus Mestrezat.

. 3. Rational arguments to prove the Pagans traduced their stories of the
worlds origin from Moses.
But to come to a more rational eviction of our position, we shall, though but
cursorily, run through the whole series of the Worlds Creation, as delivered by
Moses; and thence endeavor to show how far Plato, and others endeavored to
imitate Moses herein. 1. Moses makes God to be the first cause or creator of
all things, Genesis 1.1. God created. 1 Plato's Ideas answerable to Moses, Genesis
1.31.
And the first piece of this Divine efficience is by Divines referred to the
Divine Ideas or Decrees, according to which original exemplar all things were
made, as Genesis 1.31. very good: i.e. (says Austin) conformable to their
original pattern in the Divine Decrees etc. In imitation whereof Plato, in his
Timaeus fol. 30. treating of Gods orderly and wise production of the Universe,
sets forth these Decrees of God, under the notion of Ideas etc. He says, there
was an universal Idea beyond all things made, according to which they were all
made. For he makes this first universal sovereigne Idea the (...), Exemplar, or
(...) image of all things. This Idea, existing in the mind of God, he styles
(...), indivisible or simple, and eternal; namely, an uniforme, and eternal
exemplar, according to which the Universe was delineated or chalked forth. In
which regard Plato called the world eternal, i.e. (...), because its great
Exemplar, existing in the Divine Ideas or Decrees, was eternal. Thus Plato, in
his Parmenides fol. 134. tells us, That God, by virtue of these Divine Ideas,
has a perfect knowledge of all things. Which Ideas (says he) have their
original, not in us, but in the absolute will and sovereigne pleasure of God:
for otherwise God should not be our Lord, neither should he have the knowledge
of human Affairs, which to grant is absurd etc. All this answers fully to the
Scriptures, and our Divines account of God's decrees. Hence Plato supposes the
Universe to be (...), a living intelligible creature, i.e. as he himself adds,
(...), by reason of Gods prevision. By which living intelligible world he seems
to mean no other, than that (...), exemplar and intelligible Image of all
things existing in the mind of God, whereof he had before philosophized. This
he calls elsewhere his (...), Ideal world, and (...), intelligible, self-living,
always living. From all which we may collect, what was Plato's genuine opinion
touching these Ideas, which he makes to be separate from matter, existing
without their singulars, as certain universal exemplars of all things made etc.
And whence could such sublime distinct notices of God's Divine wisdom and
Decrees enter into Plato's head, if not by some Tradition originally sacred,
and Jewish? Of this see more what follows of Pythagorean and Platonic
Philosophy, where we have treated more professedly of these Diviue Ideas: as
Part. 2. Book 1. chap. of Pythagorean Philosophy.

. 4. Gods real efficience Genesis 1.1. how far imitated and expressed by Pagans.
As for the real productive efficience of God, and the manner how it produces
all things in Nature, we find a good account thereof in Plato, in his Phaedo,
fol. 101. telling us, there was one first beauty, or chief Good, which was the
cause of all the rest; (...) etc. Beauty of it self, and by it self, and
great, and good; and from it all things else proceed. So in his Theatet. fol.
57. Plato says, it was unworthy of a Philosopher to treat only of second
causes, and let pass God, who was the first and chief, or principal cause; yea
not only (...), the supreme cause, but also (...), the cause of causes: for
all other causes were but (...), concauses, and cooperative under God. Thus
also Plato, in his Sophista, fol. 215. says, that Natural things could not
spring up of themselves, but they were (...), the products of God's
workmanship. And more particularly, in his Repub. lib. 6. fol. 509. Plato
asserts one supreme (...), Idea of Good; which giving Being and virtue to all
things else, must of necessity excel all in dignity and efficacy. (And he
adds:) that in this chief Idea of Good (which is God) consists the hinge of
our life and happiness, and that it was the first cause of all things, both
(...), visible, and intelligible. 1. He says, it is the first efficacious
cause of the Being of all things, (...), the first fabricator, perfector,
essentializer of Beings, or he that gives Essence to Beings; yea, he calls him
(...), very Being etc. He speaks expressly thus: (...), Being and Essence sprang
from this Idea. 2. Plato says, that this Idea of Good is so the cause of all
things, that he is above, and beyond all things; yea altogether (...), immixed,
and simple; seeing his Majesty does far excel all things (...), in Antiquity
and power: whence he makes this Idea of Good (who is God) to be Eternal,
Infinite in power, and independent in working. But as for all created good
things, he supposes them to be not (...), the very good; but only (...), Good
by derivation from, or participation of God's original Goodness: whence he
styles them (...), products; and (...), works; and (...), fabricates of that
first chiefest good. Of all which he treats more fully in his Timaeus, as
hereafter in Plato's Philosophy.

. 5. God's creating the Heaven, and Angels. Genesis 1.1
We pass on to the effects of this Divine Creation; the first whereof is,
according to Moses's relation, Genesis 1.1. the Heaven. In imitation whereof the
Pagan Philosophers framed their coelum Empyraeum, etc.
Whereby some (if not the most Divines) understand the Heaven of Heavens; that
glorions seat or habitation of Angelick Beings etc. Answerable to, and in
imitation of this supreme Heaven, the Pagan Mathematicians framed a ninth
Sphere, void of Stars etc. Thus Johan. Grammaticus de creat. mundi lib. 1. cap.
2. Before Ptolomaeus, and Hipparchus the Mathematicians, no one acknowledged
the ninth and extreme sphere wanting stars. For Plato with others, mention
only eight spheres. This I only mention, to show, that Ptolomaeus and
Hipparchus who preceded him, consent with Moses, in supposing an extreme
Sphere, void of stars; yea, (...), from him [i.e. Moses] rather did they take
the original of this invention. Thus Jo. Grammaticus. The inhabitants of this
supreme Heaven were the blessed Angels, which Divines generally suppose to have
been created together with this first supreme Heaven, according to that of Job
38.7. when the morning stars sang together etc. Answerable whereto we find, in
Sanchoniathons story of the Creation, mention made of (...), intelligent
Animals, (or, according to Aristotle's notion, living Intelligences;) by which
Bochart ( Can. lib. 2. cap. 2.) conceives the Angels to be understood. So
Stillingfleet Origin. S. book 3. chap. 5. tells us, that Sanchoniathon sets
forth the creation of the Angels under the (...) contemplators of Heaven:
whence I presume, Aristotle's opinion of the Heavens being moved by Divine
Intelligences, received its original etc.

. 6. [Gen. 1.2. without form, and void.] Hence the Pagans derived their Chaos,
and first Matter.
Then it follows in the Mosaic History, Genesis 1.2. And the Earth was without
form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. From this
description of Moses, the Poets derived all their fabulous narrations, touching
the first Chaos, as the Philosophers also their (...), first matter of the
Universe. The first, and indeed the most exact description of the first Chaos,
we find in the ancient pagan Historiographers, in the fragments of
Sanchoniathon translated by Philo Byblius, and quoted by Eusebius praepar. lib.
1. c. 10. where it is said, that in the beginning of things, there was a spirit
of dark Air; which he calls (...), i.e. (says Bochart Can. lib 2. cap. 2.) in
the Phenician tongue (...) Chauth Ereb, Evening darkness. Graecum (...)
nonnunquam plane id ipsum est, quod Hebraeum (...) Ereb, nempe occasus, aut
vespera. Bochart Can. l. 2. c. 2.
The notion Chaos is taken from Genesis 1.2. the word (...) from (...), (as Plato,
and Hesiod read it,) and (...) from Genesis 1.5. (...) Ereb, Evening. Thus Hesiod,
(...) etc. first of all the Chaos was produced: whence follows (...), from the
Chaos sprang the Evening, and dark night: whence 2. it is added in
Sanchoniathon's fragments, (...). From the conversion of the spirit with the
Chaos, there emerged Mot, i.e. slime, or corrupt watery mixture, which some
call Ilus. That which Philo-Byblius translated (...) Mot, Bochart supposes to
have been in the Phenician Tongue (wherein Sanchoniathon writ) (...) Mod, it
being usual with the Greeks to express the Hebrew (...) by (...), (as from
(...).) Now (...) in the Hebrew signifies the first matter; which word, though
we find it not used in Scripture, yet Bochart supposes, it might have been
used by the Hebrew Philosophers, as (...) amongst the Arabians. This Mot, first
matter, or Chaos, is expressed much in the same manner by Plato, who calls it
(...), somewhat without form; and (...), a confused Mass: also he says it
was (...) darkness, the conjugate of the word used by Philo Byblius, in his
version of Sanchoniathon; as also by Hesiod, which sprang from the Phenician or
Hebrew (...) Ereb. Genesis 1.5. To which we may add that of Ovid Metamorph. l. 1.
fab. 1. Quem dixere chaos, rudis indigestaque moles etc.


The first chaos the seed of the Creation.
3. It follows in Sanchoniathon, (...), out of this Mot or Chaos proceeded the
whole seed of the Creation, and the genesis or generation of the Universe.
Mochus, another great Phenician Physiologist, (who continued Sanchoniathon's
Phenician History, and whose Books were interpreted by Laetus,) makes this
first matter of all things to be Atoms, which he derived from the Jewish
Physiologie, as hereafter in his Philosophy. But none describe this more fully
than Plato in his Timaeus. fol. 10. where he tells us, that this Chaos, or first
matter, was (...) the stock, or (...), the species, out of which every thing
was composed. Again he styles it, (...) etc. The subject of all Generation,
and, as it were, the Nurse thereof; which had no complete perfect Being of its
own, but rather was a potential inform passive subject only. So again in his
Timaeus, fol. 12. Plato makes this first matter to be (...), out of which the
four Elements, and all things else were composed, Whence Aristotle his scholar
derived his confused Notions of the first matter, that it was 1. Inform. 2.
Indefinite or rude. 3. A pure power, or passive principle, void, but capable of
any Form. 4. Hence also Aristotle borrowed his notions about Physic
privation, which he makes to precede the introduction of a Form, and appendent
to the first matter, answerable to, and, I doubt not but, originally from Genesis
1.2. without form, and void. R. D. Kimchi in radicibus suis sic sciibit. Thohu
and Bobu desolationem and vacuitateus significant. Et sapientes qui scrutantur
rerum naturas, dixerunt, Thohu, est res, cui non est similituda ac figura, sic
tamen disposita and praeparata, ut quamvis recipere possit similitudinem and
formam, id quod Graeci Hylin vocant. P. Fagius Exegescin Genesis 1.2.
Lastly, that the ancient Poets derived their Chaos from Genesis 1.1,2. is
asserted by Mariana the Jesuit, on Genesis 1.1. The like Velcurio in his Physica,
lib. 1. cap. 14. affirms of the Philosophers, that they derived their first
matter hence. See more of this in what follows of Plato's Physics.

7. Genesis 1.2. The Spirits forming the Universe, expressed under the notion of
the Soul of the world by Plato, etc.
It follows in Moses's description Genesis 1.2. And the spirit of God moved upon
the waters. In imitation whereof 1. In Sanchoniathon's History of the
Creation, his first matter, or Mot, is styled (...), slime, or corrupt watery
mixture. So in Orpheus, (...), of water slime was made. So Apollonius, (...),
out of slime the Earth was made: where the Scholiast tells us, that the Chaos,
or first matter was water, which settling became slime, and the slime condensed
became Earth etc. Hence Thales held water to be the first matter of all things.
Also Pythagoras, and Plato, their (...), first matter, was the same with this
Phenician (...), as both name and thing argue. And all but corrupt imitations
of Genesis 1.2. as we shall hereafter prove in the Physiologie of Thales, Plato
etc.

Genesis 1.2.
2. In this description of Moses Genesis 1.2. we have the Spirit's Motion,
Fomentation, and Formation of all things out of this Chaos, or watery mixture
in these words, [ and the spirit of God moved etc.] P. Fagius explains (...)
here, by motion and agitation; or by the Fomentation of an Hen, that sets a
brood. Verbum (...) non simplicem motionem, agitationem, and superletionem
significat, sed ejusmodi quam Milvus, aut alia a vis peragit, pendens in Acre,
ut Capnio. Vel qualem columba perficit, cum ovis ad excludendum pullos incubat:
ut R. Solomo. In hac ergo significatione si accipias verbum, pulchre
significabit vim illam Dei folricem, ex ruditate omnia formantis. Fagius
Exeges. in Genesis 1.2.
Chrysostom calls it (...), a vivifick Energie. The meaning is, that the spirit
of God moving on the waters, with a plastic and efformative virtue, formed and
shaped every thing into its proper form. Hereof also we find great imitations
in Pagan writers. For to begin with Sanchoniathon, who seems most ancient, and
one of the first that drank of the sacred fountain, (though he mixed his Jewish
Traditions with great fables and corruptions;) he calls this motion of the
spirit (...), a dark and blustering wind. Take the whole together, as we find
it in Eusebius. l. 1.10. where the first moving principle of the Universe is made
to be a dark blustering spirit or wind, who finding the Chaos confused, and
involved in darkness, without bounds or order, being moved with the love of
his own principle, he made a contexture, called Love, whence the first
production of all things proceeded: (though the spirit it self had no
generation,) from this connection of the spirit was produced Mot, which some
call Ilus, slime, or watery mixture; and of this was made the seed of all
creatures, and the generation of all things. This description of the Spirits
first Agitation or motion on the watery mixture, though it carries in it many
corrupt additions, yet it is not without considerable notices of its first
Traduction from Moses's story Genesis 1.2. And so Eumenius the Philosopher, cites
the very words of Moses Genesis 1.2. the spirit of God moved on the face of the
waters, to prove this opinion; as Porphyrie, de antro Nymph. This was also the
opinion of the Stoics, who held there was (...), a spermatick efformative
word, whereby the world was formed and shaped into its particularities etc. So
Diog: Laert: of Zeno, which Plato, in his Timaeus, calls (...). This others call
(...), a plastic power. Plato styles it (...), the soul of the world, or the
universal spirit. So Lud: Vives: in August: civit. lib. 10. c. 23. Any one
(says he) that inclines to favor Plato, may easily defend, that the soul of
the world, is that spirit which moved on the face of the waters, Genesis 1.2. whom
they seem to make the great efficient, who imparts life and essence to all
things throughout the mass of the Universe etc. So Cardinal Bessario lib. 3.
cap. 22. tells us, that what is spoken of Plato, and of all the Platonists,
touching the soul of the world, that, in our Religion, is interpreted of the
Divine spirit: as Carpent. on Alcinous digres. 2. page 235.. 8. See more of
this in Plato's Physics.

8. Plato's description of the form of the Universe conformable to that of
Moses, Genesis 1.31.
From this Universal spirit (or spirit of the Universe) his prolifick
Agitation, Fomentation, or Formation of all things proceeds, and that according
to Moses's description, the form of the Universe, which consists in that
order, harmony, beauty, perfection, and goodness, which appeared therein, and
in each part thereof, according to Gen 1.31. And God saw every thing that he
had made, and behold it was very good, i.e. God beheld all things clothed with
the most perfect order, harmony, beauty, Admonet Nachmanni per [dicere Dei]
productionem rerum creatarum significari, per [videre Dei] complacentiam and
approbationem ejus, qua rebus creatis ac productis, perpetuam subsistendi,
durandique vim addidit. Verba sunt haec: productio rerum ad actum vocatur
[dicere Dei] et subsistentia, vel duratio vocatur [videre Dei.] Reru^
subsistentia a complacito Dei etc. P. Fagius Exeges. in Genesis 1.31.
and form of goodness, conformable to those Universal Ideas of Goodness, lodged
in the platform of his Eternal Wisdom and Decrees. And Plato, discoursing of
the form of the Universe, speaks very far the mind, and almost in the same
words, of Moses. So in his Timaeus, fol. 12. Plato teaches us, that out of the
Chaos or first matter, confused and indigested, God most accurately formed and
disposed the Universe into the most harmonious, orderly, and beautiful form.
His own words are, (...), he adorned, disposed, conformed, composed, and
fashioned all things etc. Yea, he undertakes to lay down the mode, how this
rude indigested Chaos, was brought to this perfect form: namely, the Divine
Opificer, by whose (...), effective word, all things were essentializ'd, did by
a prudent persuasion formalize, or reduce into an exact light, order, and
form, the first Matter, otherwise dark, inordinate, and inform. And, in his
Timaeus, fol. 32. he gives us a more full account of this form of the
Universe. He supposes the whole Universe to be (according to his Allegorick
mode of philosophizing,) (...), a living intelligent Animal, consisting of
body and soul: the Body he calls (...), the visible and tractable Matter,
which consisted of the four Elemenss, Earth, Air, Fire, Water: but the Soul he
makes to be the spirit of the Universe, (or that Universal spirit) which
actuated and influenced the same: The form of the Universe consists in its
beauty, order, perfection.
whence sprang (...), an happy Analogy, Symmetrie, or proportion and Order,
amongst all its parts; by means whereof, things of themselves most opposite,
were copulated and linked together, by I know not what agreeing Discord,
wherein its form, perfection, and goodness consists. And Plato, having
discoursed at large of this perfect form, order, and harmony of the Universe,
which resulted from its universal spirit, or soul, he concludes, ( Timaeus fol.
37.) (...), God contemplating this new framed Image of the immortal Gods,
rejoiced and recreated himself therein etc. That Plato in all this imitates
Moses, seems very evident, both from his own expressions, as also from the
observation of Johannes Grammaticus, de creatione Mundi, lib. 7. cap. 11. (...)
etc. Rightly therefore the great Moses concluding the generation of the
Universe, And God saw (says he) all things that he made, and beheld they were
very good. Plato also imitates him in this, who, showing how the Universe was
framed by God, says, that the Father, who generated the Universe, had
considered this mobile Animal, the framed Image of the eternal Gods, he
rejoiced and recreated himself therein: especially when he considered it was
made exactly conformable to its Paradigme, or universal Exemplar. Thus Johannes
Grammaticus. Whence also Plato himself, Timaeus fol. 92. calls this Universe,
thus formalized and perfectionated, (...), a sensible or visible Image of the
intelligible insensible God. which, as it is supposed, he traduced from Moses's
description of Man, Genesis 1.27. in his Image etc. Thus Johannes Grammaticus de
Mundicreatione lib. 6. cap. 21. p. 249. (...) etc. What Moses spoke properly of
Man, that God made him according to his Image and likeness, this Plato
translates to all things in the world. Thus we have seen, how exactly Plato's
Notions of the form of the Universe, consisting in its Order, Harmony,
Beauty, Perfection, and Goodness, and that in conformity. to the Divine
exemplar, do conform to, and therefore, as we may presume, were derived from
Moses's description of the same, Genesis 1.31. I might add hereto the opinion of
Pythagoras, who asserted the like beautiful structure, Harmony, and Perfection
of the Universe, and thence (according to Plutarch) was the first that called
it (...), which signifies Ornament, Beauty, etc. Also Thales held the world,
being God's work, was most beautiful, well disposed, and perfect. Of which see
more Pythagoras's Philosophy.

. 9. Moses's description of the light Genesis 1.3. imitated by Pagan Writers.
Having discoursed at large of the first Efficience, Matter, spirit or Soul,
and form of the Universe, as laid down by Ethnic Physiologists, or
Naturalists, and that in imitation of the Mosaic History Genesis 1. we now
proceed to some of the chiefest parts of the Universe, and their original
Constitution; wherein we doubt not but to give evident vestigia, or notices of
many Mosaic Traditions in Pagan writers. We shall begin with that great
Masterpiece of the inanimate irrational world, Light; which is mentioned by
Moses, as the first species or part of God's Creation, Genesis 1.3,4,5,6. v. 3.
Let there be Light, (...): out of which Light the Celestial Lights were
composed, as Genesis 1.14,15,16,17,18. We shall not much concern our selves in
that great Philosophic Dispute, what this first Light (out of which the
Celestial Lights were composed) was? Only the opinion of the old Jewish
Philosophers seems to have been, that this original Light was fire. That the
first Light Genesis 1.3. etc. was fire, is excellently demonstrated by Richardson
(that acute Philosopher and Divine,) in his Exposition upon his
Divinitie-Tables, ( Table 5. MSS.) thus. Ignis] It Is made of the first matter;
when its said, [Let there be Light] if we look at (...), it comes from (...)
fire. Again, that light which made the day then, is the same light that now
makes the day: its not altered, after it was made. If our Light be a Substance,
its either Heavenly, or Elementarie. That Light is a substance, its local
motion shows. Accidents have it not, but by reason of the substance. Optics
confess, that Light radii, and species move in time. And we see, that Light
moves, by the Sun's dispersing its beams: which motion, though it be speedy,
yet it is in time. So place and time bear witness, that Light is a substance.
Some imagine, that the Sun etc. begets the species in the Air; and so Light is
only the species of the thing that is Light: but these species are substance,
by the testimony of Optics. That our Light is fire, appears farther from
the beams, and their burning; which is the property of fire, when the parts
are united. Again, their conceit is, that neither the Sun, nor the beams are
hot, but by accident, by reflection etc. But 1. why should the Sun beams come
down, if only to inlighten, and not to warm? 2. Again, there is an Element of
fire, as our fire shows: it moves localiter, and therefore it is a body;
and with a simple motion, and therefore it is a simple body, and its place is
above. Again, Creatures must enjoy fire, which would not of it self come
downward etc. 4. Again that [let there be Light] was the place of fire, made
before the Air: and if fire was not then made, then when was it made? And it
was good, therefore perfect; therefore no Quality without Substance, for that
is not perfect: its not an effect without a cause; nor a Light, after put into
the Sun, for then it were imperfect. 6. Again, if the beams of the Sun were not
fire, how could the beams shine in the Air? its therefore from the fire that is
in them. 7. If the Sun beams be not fire, they cannot draw substances unto
them: and why do these draw them nearer? do the beams grow weaker, when the
vapors come nearer? its not therefore by attraction, that these draw them
thither; but fire desires to carry them up. Thence Richardson adds, on the
Attribute of Ignis (...).] God commends fire unto us by Light, to show us the
use of fire. We say, bring hither a Light, i.e. a Candle or Torch, to give
light. Fire is Light, because the act of the form upon the matter, does so
subtilize, and so equal it, that it extends all alike, and makes it polite,
and so clear, and bright. Glass is clear from its politenes; and its full of
fire: so the Carbuncle. Air also is full of Light, because transparent, by
reason of the equality. Thus Richardson: whose acute Discourse I have quoted
at large, because the world has not yet been so happy, as to see it in public.
That (...) signifies the Sun, as well as Light, is evident from Job. 31.26. if
I saw (...) the Sun: whence sprang Orus the Egyptian God, whom they made to be
the Sun, as before B. 2. C. 8.. 9.

The primigenious Light Genesis 1.3. the same with fire.
And that the Hebrew (...) Or, or Ur, signifies fire, as well as light; it is
evident by Ur of Chaldea, which was so styled from (...) Or, or Ur, that sacred
fire, worshipped there as a symbol of the Sun. Hence also from the Hebrew (...)
Ur, came the Greek (...), fire. Thence also the Greek (...), which answers to
the Hebrew (...), signifies fire, as well as light. So in Euripides in Rheso:
(...): the Enemies never before lighted so great a fire. Yea Esa. 10.17. God
under the notion of Light, is said to be for a fire, i.e. a fiery light. So
Mark (who speaks according to the Hebrew Idiom) calls the fire light, Mark
14.54. (...), to the light, i.e. fire. So that according to the Jewish account,
Light and Fire are identick, both name and thing the same. Out of this
primogenious light or fire the Celestial Lights were made. Genesis 1.14 15,16. etc.
Out of this primigenious Light, or Fire, the Celestial Lights and Stars were
composed; as Moses, Genesis 1.14,15,16,17,18. Thus also Apollinaris, who says,
(...) etc. Out of the primigenious Light, whatever was most pure, God put into
the Sun: the rest he bestowed on the Moon, and other stars etc. Thus Maximus on
Dionysius: (...), on the fourth day he transformed the Light, created the first
day, into the Sun. All is well and fully laid down by Grotius, on the 2 Peter
3.7. Vossius de Idol. lib. 2. cap. 39. assaies to give us the mode, how all
this was accomplished. God (says he) on the 4th day created the Sun and Stars
in the upper part of the Firmament. God made these Celestial bodies out of that
primigenious Light, that first Light remaining according to form and nature,
but not according to its former state; being compact into the Sun, that so it
might alternate Nights and Days, and discriminate Years, Months, and other
Seasons. Which reason of the immutation of this Light, is given by Moses, Genesis
1.14. Thus Vossius: who, in what follows, proves, that the Stars are igneous or
fiery, both by Scriptural and rational arguments.

Now in imitation of this Mosaic description, touching the creation of the
first Light or fire, (out of which the Celestial lights were framed,) the old
Pagan Philosophers held the Celestial Bodies to be composed of fire. Thus
Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Zeno held, as Stobaeus in Eclog. Physic: fol. 85.
So Thales held the stars to be ignite; Empedocles the Heaven to be compacted of
Air and fire; Anaxagoras, Democritus, Metrodorus, that that the Sun was (...),
a mass or globe of fire; as the same Stobaeus in Eclog. physicis, fol. 55.
etc. where see this argument largely asserted. But none insists more fully on
this Theme than Plato, who in his Timaeus frequently calls Light (...), fire,
from (...) Or, or Vr, Genesis 1.3. which signifies light and fire. So in his
Definitions (collected by his Successor) we find the Sun thus defined, (...),
the Sun is a celestial fire: as Job. 31.26. the Sun is called (...) Or, or Vr,
whence (...) Pur, fire. The Pagans received these notions of the stars being
fire, from Moses Genesis 1.3.
Thence Sandford, de descensu Christi l. 1.. 10. informs us, that the ancient
name, whereby the Grecians styled the Sun, was (...), the sacred fire, which
they worshipped (in imitation of the Chaldeans) as their supreme only God: as
before, B. 2. c. 8.. 11. And that Plato received these his Physiological
Contemplations from Moses's relation Genesis 1.3.14. etc. is affirmed by Vossius
de Idol. lib: 2. cap. 38. page 517. Plato (says he) learned this doctrine from
the Mosaic Tradition, as Justin Martyr. Apol. 2. and cohort. ad Graecos. And
albeit he might not see any Translation of Moses, yet he might have it from the
posterity of the Jews in Egypt, who fled thither in the time of
Nebuchodonosor; or from the Egyptians, who had it from the Jews. Thus Vossius
shows us, how Plato traduced his opinion, touching the ignite nature of the
Stars, from Moses. Hence the Fathers (who generally Platonized) followed Plato
herein, as that which was very consonant to, and, as they presumed, derived
from Moses. So Tertullian (libro de Anima,) The Sun is a body, because fire.
Thus also Theodore, Basil, Chrysostom etc. as Vossius de Idol. lib. 2. cap.
38.39.

. 10. Genesis 1.5. The night elder than the day.
There follows in Moses's Description, Genesis 1.5. The Evening and the Morning
were the first day: whence the Jews always reckoned the beginning of their
day, as also of the Creation, from the Evening. In imitation whereof many of
the Grecians both Poets and Philosophers held, that the Night was elder than
the Day. Thus Stanley ( Histor. Philos. part. 1. chap. 6.. 5.) tells us, that
Thales held, the night was elder than the day. This circumstance of the
Creation was held also by Orpheus, and Hesiod, who had it from the Phenicians
etc.

. 11. Genesis 1.6. The firmament a fluid aerial or watery matter.
Again, Genesis 1.6. etc. it is said, let there be a Firmament in the midst of the
waters etc. where the Hebrew (...) signifies the Expanse, i.e. diffusive Air or
water. And that the Firmament was made of some fluid waterie or aereal part of
the Chaos, is strongly conjectured by the Learned, both from name and thing.
Thus Vossius, de Idol. lib. 2. cap. 39. page 516. Divine Moses (says he)
teaches us, that the first days work was the rude Earth, compassed about with
water, and the light, or the lucid body of fire. Thence he relates, that on
another day there was made the Expansum, or Firmament, and that in the midst of
the waters; so that beneath, it has the Terrestrial waters; and above, the
Celestial. This Expansum ( which in its upper part is called Ether, and in its
lower part, next the Earth, called Air) is made of water; because waters are
pellucid. Also this Expansum is said to be seated in the midst of the waters.
(...) Hebraeis, test Ab. Ezra, est res extensa, sive expansa; vel eo modo, quo
aulaea expanduntur, vel quo argenteum malleo deducitur and attenuatur. Ad vim
istius vocabuli, Scriptura in multis locis alludit, ut Psalm. 104.2. etc. Caelum
igitur Hebraeis ab extensione (...); and quod aquea quaedam materia est, (...)
dicitur. P. Fagius Exeges. in Genesis 1.6.
Farther, this appears from the name (...) given to it, the Etymon whereof,
according to general consent, comes from (...) waters there. Thus Vossius. The
like Paulus Fagius on this place. Answerable hereto many of the ancient
Philosophers held the Firmament, or Heaven, wherein the stars were, to be of a
fluid, aereal, or waterie substance. Thence Plato, in his Timaeus, affirms,
that the stars are not fixed in the Firmament, but move up and down, and as it
were dance in the same: and herein Plato is followed by Ptolomie, who affirms,
that not the Heavens, but the Stars therein move. And Aristotle ( de coelo lib.
2. cap. 9. text. 56.) acknowledges, that according to his Predecessors, it was
generally concluded, that the Heavens were either of an aerial, or fiery
nature. His words are (...). Empedocles (as. 9.) joins both these together,
making the Heaven to consist, partly of Fire, partly of Air: which opinion, if
by fire, we understand the Celestial lights, and by Air the Firmament, seems
most orthodox, and agreeing to Moses's Description. So Wendelin, in his book de
Coelo, makes the Heavens to consist of a fluid, aereal Substance etc.

. 12. Genesis 1.16.18. the Sun Lord of Heaven etc.
Again Moses tells us, Genesis 1.16. etc. God then made two great Lights, the
greater Light to rule the day etc. In imitation whereof the Phenicians called
the Sun (...), the Lord of Heaven, also (...) Moloch, the King; and thence they
worshipped him as their supreme Lord or God. Likewise the Moon they called
Belisama, and Baaltis; or, according to the Scripture Dialect, the Queen of
Heaven, which gave rise to the Phenician Baalim, and the Grecian Demons, and so
to the Pagan (...), Natural Theology, as before Book 2. chap. 8.. 3. etc.

CHAP. IV.
Ethnic Imitations of Adams creation and happy state in Paradise, Genesis 1.26.
Gen: 2.8. Adams Formation out of the dust imitated by Pagans: Also fables of
the Souls Creation and Infusion, Genesis 2.7. Eves Formation out of Adam expressed
Gen: 2.21,22. Imitated by Plato's Androgynon. Man's being formed after the Image
of God Gen: 1.27. expressed by Plato: and Man's happy state in Paradise, Genesis
2.8. expressed by Plato, under the Golden Age. Genesis 2.25. nakedness, Genesis 3.1.
Conference with the Serpent, of the Golden and Iron Ages. Adam's memory
preserved under Saturn, Tuisto: and Eves under Isis. Paradise or Eden imitated
by the Elysian fields. Adonis's garden. The tree of life, Genesis 2.9. expressed
by Nectar and Ambrosia. etc.

. 1. HAving dispatched the History of the Creation in general, we now come to
the History of Man, his Creation and Happy state in Paradise; whereof we doubt
not but to discover many evident Vestigia and broken Traditions in Pagan
writers; which were originally of Sacred Extract. Genesis 1.26. Genesis 2.8. Adams
formation out of the dust imitated by Pagans.
We shall begin with the Creation of man, mentioned Genesis 1.26. and Genesis 2.8.
and the Lord formed Man out of the dust of the earth, etc. In imitation whereof
the first Parent of mankind is styled by Sanchoniathon, (according to the
version of Philo Byblius) (...) One sprung out of the Earth, etc. So Plato de
Repub. lib. 3. fol. 414. makes mention of a Phenician fable, touching the
Fraternity of all men, in regard of their Original extract out of the Earth.
And Serranus upon this place observes, that Plato here illustrates the
Institution of Magistrates by a Fable, which he terms Phenician; because the
Phenicians affirmed, that Men sprang out of the earth; that so, by the
Community of the same original, they might the more sacredly defend mutual
Peace, and Concord. This Fable (adds Serranus) seems to be a Vestigium of the
Primitive Truth: so that truly by the Appellation, (...), of a certain
Phenician Fable, the Iudaick Doctrine may be understood, etc. The Reasons that
might induce Plato, to call these, and such like Jewish Traditions, Phenician
Fables, are such as these, 1. Canaan, which the Jews possessed, was originally
the Country of the Phenicians; whence Phenicia is still called by some Canaan:
neither is it indeed any other then a skirt of Canaan, as Portugal is of Spain.
Well therefore might Plato term the Jews who inhabited Canaan, Phenicians; in
as much as Phenicia was but an Appendix, or rather originally a part thereof.
2. Or it is likely Plato forbore to mention the Jews by name; thereby to secure
himself from that envy and Odium, which followed such as had any honorable
regard to the Jews. That those Fables which Plato terms Phenician, were
originally Jewish Traditions, we have once and again proved, and shall
hereafter farther confirm. Again Plato in his Politicus fol. 271, says
expressly, that the first man was produced out of the earth, as hereafter.

. 2. As for the Infusion of the Human Soul, it is thus expressed by Moses Genesis
2.7. and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man was a living
soul. We find the Creation and Infusion of the human soul expressed in the same
manner, yea almost in the same words, by Sanchoniathon, according to Philo
Byblius's version, thus, The first men (says he) were made (...), of the
Colpia of the wind, or Spirit. Bochart Can. lib. 2. cap. 2. fol. 784. gives
this account hereof: wind Colpia (for any apposite English word to expres it by
does not readily occur) is the same with (...) Col-pi-jah, the voice of Gods
mouth, by whose Inspiration and Word man was made as Genesis 2.7. Genesis 2.7. And
breathed etc.
whence also Orpheus, touching the Production of Man out of the dust, and the
Infusion of the Rational Soul, speaks thus: (...): Mankind (says Orpheus) was
framed by God himself, out of the Earth, and received from him a Rational soul:
as Eusebius. ex Tim. Chronographo (...).

. 3. Genesis 2.21,22. Eves Formation. Ephesians. 5.31.
Concerning the Formation of Eve, Moses tells, Gen: 2.21,22. that she was formed
out of Adams rib etc. Whence Man and Woman are styled by Paul, Ephesians. 5.31.
one flesh: which he seems to understand, according to the Jewish Cabal or
mystical sense; applying the whole to Christ and his Church, whose Union was
mystically expressed by this Formation of Eve out of Adam. In imitation hereof
Plato, in his Symposiastick Dialogue (concerning the Nature of love) mentions a
piece of Cabalisme, wherein he brings in Aristophanes discoursing in this
manner. The ancient nature of men was not as now it is, but very differing; for
then it was (...) Androgynon, both in name and kind, i.e. commixt of Male and
Female sex. This Platonic (...) or Man-Woman seems evident by some broken
Tradition of the Jewish Cabalisme, wherein we find mention thereof, (as Grotius
has observed) which originally sprang from the story of Eves being formed out
of Adam, and so one flesh with him, as Cudworth in his Discourse on the Union
'twixt Christ and his Church.

. 4. Genesis 1.27. Man's being formed after the Image of God.
Gen: 1.27. it is said God created man in his own Image etc. This Image of God
is elsewhere made to consist in Holiness and Righteousness. This Divine Formation
of Man after the Image of God, is lively described by Pagan Writers, and that,
as we may regularly conclude, in imitation of this Mosaic Description. Plato,
in his Critias (according to Serranus observation fol. 106.) affirms, that in
the days of old, there flourished, in the first men, (...), a Divine Particle
of God; also (...), a Divine Nature; which rendered them blessed. This elsewhere
he styles (...), the Old Nature. And more particularly in his Theaetetus,
Plato, discoursing of this Likeness of Man to God, makes it to consist in this,
that Man be (...) Holy with Wisdom and Righteousness: which exactly answers to
Paul's Character of the Image of God; Ephesians. 4.23,24.
Ephesians. 4.23,24. (...), in righteousness and true holiness: to which if we add
that Col. 3.10. (...) in knowledge, etc. we have a full explication of Moses,
and that conformable to Plato his Description of the Image of God in Man. Again
Plato in his Timaeus, fol. 92. makes mention of (...), a sensible Image of the
Intelligible God, which though we apply it to the Universe in general, yet has
it a more peculiar relation to Man, and that in Imitation of Moses, Genesis 1.27.
So Johannes Grammaticus de Creat. lib. 6. cap. 21. What Moses (says he) most
properly affirmed of Man, that he was created according to the Image of God,
Plato transfers to the whole Universe, etc. Neither had the Philosophers only,
but Poets also evident Notices of Man's Creation after Gods Image: This Paul
observes of Aratus one of the Heathen Poets, (...). For we are his offspring,
Act. 17.28,29. which the same Paul explains of man's Alliance or Resemblance to
God. We find Man's Creation after the Image of God, lively set forth by Ovid in
his Metamorph. lib. 1. fab. 2. of Man's Creation. Sanctius his animal Mentisque
capacius altae
Deerat adhuc, and quod dominari in caetera posset
Natus homo est, sive hunc divino semine fecit etc.


. 5. Genesis 2.8. Man's being placed in Paradise and happy state.
Man being made after the Image of God, was placed in Paradise etc. Genesis 2.8.
This happy state of Man in Paradise was shadowed forth by the Ancients, under
fabulous Narrations of the Golden Age; concerning which Plato discourses very
amply, and that in Imitation of the Mosaic description: so in his Politicus
(fol. 272. Edit. Steph.) Plato says (...), etc. God the most wise Governor,
distributed to them, and according to his first Distribution there were neither
human Polities, nor Possessions of Wives or of Children; for all lived from the
Earth. Then he adds, but they had abundance of fruits, Apples and Trees; and a
soil very fruitful, which subministred these fruits, of its own accord, without
the labor of Agriculture. All which is but a reflexe Image of Paradise, and
Man's happy state therein; where he had leave to eat of all the fruits of the
Garden save of the tree of Knowledge, as Genesis 3.23. etc. Genesis 2.25. Naked
conference with the Serpent. Gen: 3.4.
Again 2. Plato adds in the same place, (...) they lived naked and expedite
sub Dio: which exactly answers to that Genesis 2.25. And they were both naked,
etc. 3. Plato mentions also a Conference betwixt our first Parents and Beasts:
his words are (...): they did not only converse with Men but with Beasts also
etc. which suits well with the Conference 'twixt Eve and the Serpent Genesis
3.1,2. And then Plato concludes thus: These things we must omit, (...), until
there appear some one meet to interpret these things to us: whereby it seems
manifest, that Plato had received some broken Traditions or stories, originally
Jewish, whilst he was in the Oriental parts, touching the state of Innocence;
but wanting a clear and perfect account thereof, he was content to let these
things Pass, 'till he could have some skilful Interpreter to inform him
concerning them. Serranus fol. 251. gives this explication of these passages of
Plato: That Plato (says he) derived these Traditions elsewhere, he himself
acknowledges, in that he calls this narration (...) a Fable, whereof he
expects a meet Interpreter. He signifies therefore that the truth of these
things were delivered to him by Tradition, from the Primitive times. The
difference 'twixt the Golden and Iron Age.
Therefore that he might state the difference 'twixt the Golden Age under
Saturnes Reign, and the Iron miserable Age, which we live in under Jupiter,
(says he) he lays down these Assertions. The motion of the Universe which God
made, is twofold (...): one uniforme and (...) equally following the other
multiforme and various. The former uniforme motion he makes to proceed from the
Analogy, which he styles (...) wisdom, and this following (...), from a
peculiat gift of God harmonizing it according to its Principles: whence it has
(...), a framed Immortality from its maker. But as for the other motion,
(...), difforme, it springs from the Necessity of corporeal matter; and
variously hurries the whole Universe, and affects it so that great and
dangerous vicissitudes are brought on all inferior things. Saturn therefore
reigning, (says Plato) mankind enjoyed its (...) vigor, or (...), perfect
state, immediately after men's being produced out of the Earth etc. whence this
Age was truly Golden, when these (...), men produced out of the Earth, lived
sub Deo. etc. Thus Plato, and Serranus out of him. Again Plato, in his
Politicus, fol. 271. having mentioned many things of the Golden Age, speaks
thus thereof: Our first Ancestors, who sprang up immediately after the first
Revolution, delivered these things unto us, (...), which Fables many now
adays, not rightly, disbelieve. where Serranus upon the whole, observes thus:
Plato affirms that man sprang out of the Earth, 2. That he was (...) and
naked: 3. That he enjoyed a truly happy and Golden Age. 4. That he had
conference with Beasts. 5. That he was of all men (...), the greatest
Philosopher. 6. That he needed not external Accommodations etc. These are the
Mysteries of that Fable, which he learned from the Phenicians, as Serranus.
Saturn the same with Adam etc.
That Saturn, who is said to reign in the Golden Age, was the same with Adam,
we have formerly endeavored to prove in the Genealogy of Saturn, Book 2. chapter
1. To which we may add somewhat out of Vossius de Idolol. lib. 1. cap. 18. We
now (says he) pass to Saturn, whom we make to be Adam. And to make this more
clear, let us consider a little what the Poets fable of Saturnes Golden Age,
and its agreement with the Age of Adam. This is most lively painted forth, by
that ingenious Poet Ovid, 1. Metamorph. Aurea prima sata est aetas, quae,
vindice nullo
Sponte sua sine lege fidem, rectumque colebat.
Nondum praecipites cingebant oppida fossae.
Non galeae, non ensis erat. --
Ipsa quoque immunis, rostroque intacta, nec ullis
Saucia vomeribus, per se dabat omnia tellus:
Contentique cibis nullo cogente creatis etc.
How exactly does all this answer to the state of Man in Paradise? so that I no
way doubt but that the Poets drew this by some Tradition. Namely the first Age
of Men, in the Poets, is the same as in the Scriptures, and so Saturn is the
same with Adam. For that Saturn was no other then a Man, the very Gentile
Historians dare not deny. What wonder is it then if so many things, which
belong to Adam, were attributed by the Gentiles to Saturn. 1. From Adams
hiding himself from the face of God, Genesis 3.10. came the name Saturn, from
(...) Satar latere to hide: whence also Saturn was styled Latius. 2. The
Kingdom which Saturn first obtained was the same with Adams Gen: 1,18. 3. As
Adam was driven from his Government and Paradise; so Saturn. 4. As Adam turned
husbandman, so Saturn is said to find out agriculture, whence he is pictured
with a mowers Since. etc.

. 4. Vossius de Idolol. lib. 1. cap. 38. supposes, that the memory of Adam
was preserved amongst the old Germans under the name of Tuisto or Tuito their
chief God; who (say they) sprang out of the Earth, and had a son called MAN.
The same Vossius makes the Egyptian Isis a broken tradition of Eve, from the
Hebrew Ischa.

The Memory of Paradise preserved under the Elysian fields. Eden.
Others make the Elysian fields, so much talked of by the Poets, to be but a
corrupt Imitation of Paradise or the Garden of Eden. That which makes for this
conjecture is an observation I find in Bochart touching the origination hereof.
Bochart Can. lib. 1. cap. 34. fol. 664. That this Fable of the Elysian fields
is Phenician, may be gathered from the very name, which is of Phenician
extract: for amongst the Hebrews (...) and (...) alas signifies to exult and
rejoice: thence (...) alis, joyful; whence Elysius: for 'twas usual amongst the
Ancients to change A into E, as Enakim for Anakim etc. So that the Elysian
field signifies, a place of delight and pleasure, and so it is interpreted by
Virg. lib. 6. Aen. -- exinde per amplum
Mittimur Elysium, and pauci laeta arva tenemus.
All this suits with the import of the Hebrew (...) Eden; which signifies a
Garden of delight or Pleasure.

Adonis's Garden.
Others have conceived that the story of Paradise was preserved amongst the
Heathens under the Fable of Adonis's garden which comes near to that of Eden,
as Stillinf. Orig. S. book. 3. c. 3. yea Pagan writers seem to have had some
broken Traditions not only of the Garden of Eden in general, The tree of life.
Genesis 2.9. imitated by Ambrosia and Mectar.
but also of the Tree of Life Genesis 2.9. so Mr. Du Bosc (in a Sermon at Caen
March 11. 1663.) observed, that the Poets fictions of their Divine Ambrosia,
which makes immortal; and their Nectar which makes young, were but Traditional
fragments of the tree of life. This seems farther evident by what we find in
Athenae. Deipnos. lib. 1. (...). Chaereas reports that there is a wine in
Babylon which the Natives call Nectar: whence Nectar was styled, (...), the
drink of the Gods: for it came out of the East into Greece with the Gods
themselves; as Owen lib. 3. cap. 8. By which it appears that Nectar and
Ambrosia were Divine Drinks to make men Immortal; which came originally from
the East, especially Babylon, which is generally supposed to be near the place
where Eden was seated, and therefore we have probable grounds for this
conjecture, that these Divine immortalizing drinks Nectar and Ambrosia owe
their original to the Tree of Life in Eden.

CHAP. V.
Ethnic stories of Man's Fall and Redemption by Christ. Plato's conceptions of
Man's Fall, according to Genesis 3.23,24. Plato's opinion of the Praeexistence of
Souls, and their slavery in the Body, but a Symbol of Man's Fall. Plato's
notions of Original sin; Genesis 5.3. sin ingenite etc. Man's Natural state in Sin
termed a spiritual or Moral death, Genesis 2.17. Plato acknowledges an universal
contagion of Human Nature. 1. Of the Mind; which he makes to be immersed in
Ignorance. 2. Of the Will. 3. Of the Affections: the Tyranny of Love, etc.
Plato had some imperfect Notices of Man's Redemption and the Restoration of all
things by Christ. Plato had some imperfect Notices of a Trinity, which he
understood not. The New Platonists had their (...) Trinity from Scripture: the
Platonic (...) an Ape of Christ. Poetic Fables of Christ his Incarnation
Passion, Ascension etc.

. 1. Plato's Conceptions of Man's fall from Genesis 3.23,24.
HAving gone through Man's Creation and happy state, we now proceed to discourse
of his Fall and Recoverie; whereof the blind Pagans had also no small
discoveries, as we may presume, from Scripture, or Jewish Tradition originally.
Indeed I find no Heathen to discourse more Divinely of the Fall of Man then
Plato; who (as in the former chap. Sect. 5.) expresses the same under the
Symbolick Image of the Iron Age, wherein this Motion of the Universe was (...)
multiforme, which springing from the necessity of Corporeal Matter, hurried
the Universe into many vicissitudes etc. So again (in his Critias fol. 106,)
Plato having discoursed of (...) a Divine Nature, which flourished in men under
the Golden Age, he adds, this Divine Nature being at last contempered (...)
with the mortal or sensual part in man, (...) the human inclination or custom
prevailed, even to the pestilential infection, debauching, and ruin of
mankind; and from this fountain all evils rushed in upon men (...) loosing the
best of their precious things. So likewise in his Theaetetus, Plato, having
discoursed of Man's likeness to God in the Golden Age, adds, that by how much
the farther man departed from this rectitude, by so much the deeper he fell
into a kind of (...) Nothingnes and Inhumanity: whence he makes two (...)
Exemplars: the one, (...) Divine and most happy; which was the Pattern of Man's
estate in Immortality: the other (...) Atheistick or ungodlike; the pattern
of man's fall. All which coming so near to the Scripture language, we cannot
rationally conjecture what original it should have, if not from Scripture, or
Jewish Tradition. Thus Origin ( contra Celsum lib. 4.) conceives, that Plato,
by his conversation with the Jews in Egypt, understood the history of Man's
fall; which he (according to the Egyptian mode) in his Symposiacks, expresses
under the Fable of Porus (i.e. Adam) his being drunk with Nectar, and then
going into Jupiters Garden, (that is Eden) and being there circumvented by
Penia i.e. the Serpent, and thence cast out etc. which seems an evident
vestigium of Adams Fall. and being cast out of Paradise, according to Genesis
3.23.24.

. 2. The general loss by man's Fall.
Plato discourses also, very Divinely, of that general Confusion which
happened upon the Fall; and particularly, of man's loss thereby. So in his
Politicus fol. 251. After (says Plato) the Golden Age was expired, the supreme
God left the stern and Government of the World; and from that (...)
Confusion, or disorder, destruction, without all peradventure, had happened to
the World, had not God provided etc. And particularly, concerning man's
disorder and Impotencie by the Fall, Plato, in the said Politicus fol. 274.
speaks very plainly thus, (...). Men being rendered very infirm and unskilful,
and unable to preserve themselves, by reason of all these they were in great
straits.

. 3. Platos Traditions of the Praeexistence and present Slaverie of the Soul in
the Body.
Yea farther Plato seems to have understood, either immediately from the
Scripture, or from the Jews, by Tradition, much of the cursed slaverie which
Sin and the Fall brought upon mankind. So in his Phaedrus, fol. 245. Plato
compares the Soul to a winged Chariot, which while it was in its golden perfect
State, soared aloft, and passed through Heaven and Earth; but when it was
thrust into the body it lost its wings, and remained there a Prisoner, under
the Tyranny of unlawful passions, whence he gives this origination of the
Body; (...) the body, is as it were (...) a sepulcher, or Grave for the Soul.
Hence some make Plato's opinion of the souls Praeexistence, but a Cabal of man's
fall. So Stillingf. origin. S. Book 3. Chapter 3. Sect. 17. As to the degeneracy of
the souls of men; this was the common complaint of those Philosophers, who
minded the government of themselves, and the practice of virtue; especially of
the Platonists and Stoics. The Platonists all complain of the Slaverie of the
Soul in the body; and that it is there by way of punishment for something
which was done before; which makes me think that Plato knew more of the Fall of
mankind, than he would openly discover; and for that end disguised it, after
his usual manner in the Hypothesis of Praeexistence; which, taking it
Cabalistically, may import only this, that men's souls might be Justly supposed
to be created happy; but by reason of the Apostasy of man's Soul from God, all
souls now come into their bodies as into a kind of prison etc.

. 4. Plato's notions of original sin and its traduction; from Genesis 5.3.
Yea yet farther, Plato seems to have had some pretty distinct Notices or
Traditions touching Original Sin, and its Traduction from Adam; according to
that of Moses Gen 5.3. This likeness in which Adam is said to generate his sons,
is not to be understood so much Physically as Morally, id est, of a likeness in
sin: there was not a Lust in Adam's heart, but he communicated a seed thereof
to his posterity. So Plato ( Timaeus Locrus fol. 103.) Gives us very evident
notices of original Sin, and its propagation: his words are [(...)] (...) etc.
The cause of vitiositie is from our Parents and first principles rather than
from our selves; so that we never relinquish those Actions, which lead us to
follow those primitives blemishes of our first parents etc. whence else where,
he says, (...), there is well nigh in every one an ingenite evil and disease.
So Plato, de legibus lib. 5. (...) etc. the greatest evil of all is implanted
in many men, and fixed in their souls; wherein men pleasing themselves, at last
grow so entangled, as that they cannot wind themselves out. This ingenite
Corruption he terms self love etc,

. 5. Man's State in sin termed a moral or Spiritual death according to Genesis 2.17.
Again Plato ( Gorgias: fol. 493.) terms this state of men under Sin a Moral
or Spiritual Death: and that according to the opinion of the wise: whereby it is
possible, he means the Jews. His words are (...) I have heard from the wise
men, that we are now dead; and that the body is but our sepulcher. That these
wise men, from whom Plato received this Tradition or Hearsay, were the Jews
seems very probable; because it was a common expression amongst the Jews, and
that grounded upon the word or sentence of God Genesis 2.17. thou shall surely
die, that all men now are dead in Sins: hence we may presume Plato received
this Tradition. Or if we had rather, by these wise men we may understand the
Pythagoreans; who asserted, that sin was a moral death. Whence Pythagoras, when
any of his schole were given up to sin and excommunicated, he placed a Coffin
in his place; denoting thereby, that he was dead etc. Yet it is very probable,
that Pythagoras traduced this, as other Principles, from the Jews; as we have
here after proved in Pythagoras Philosophy. This spiritual death in sin is
farther expressed by Plato under the Notion of (...) Corrupt or bad Nature: so
in the Platonic Definitions, (...) is defined (...) an evil in Nature; again
(...), a disease of Nature. Answerable whereto we have a confession of Grotius;
who affirms, that the philosophers acknowledged (...) it was connatural to men
to sin.

. 6. The universal contagion of human Nature
Yea farther, Plato seems to acknowledge an universal Contagion, or Corruption
diffused throughout the whole of human Nature, both Understanding, will, and
Affections. 1. 1. the Corrup^ of the understanding.
As for the corruption of the Understanding, Plato, in his Repub. lib. 7. fol.
613 gives a lively Description thereof, under an Allegoril of a person, who
from his Infancy lay bound neck and heels tog there in a dark dungeon; where he
could see only some imperfect shadows, by means of a certain fire kindled at
the top thereof, whence he concludes, (...), The eye of the soul is immersed in
the barbarick gulf of ignorance. And else where he says (...), the present
life has but a dreaming knowledge of things; whence also he styles our present
knowledge (...) a night day. Yea Plato, in his Timaeus fol. 90. seems to give
us the original cause of this native darkness, that overspreads the soul;
namely Adam's Sin. Truth (Says he) is the food and proper Motion of the mind,
it being connatural to it; which, (...), was in times past lost in the Head
etc. what Plato should understand by the head, if not Adam the head of
mankind, we cannot imagine. 2. the corruption of the will
2. Plato mentions also the corruption of the will; and seems to disown any
Freewill to true Good; albeit he allows some (...) or natural disposition to
civil good, in some great Heroes. Yea, he brings in Socrates refuting that
opinion of the Stoics, that virtue was (...) teachable 3. the disorder of the
affections and Tyranny of self love.
3. Plato discourses very largely and divinely, touching the irregularities of
the Affections or Passions. So de Repub. lib. 9. fol. 575 he discourses of
self love, the root of all Affections, as the great Tyrant over man kind,
(...). Love is a Tyrant in him, living in all manner of Disorder, and
irregularitie: where he largely and elegantly describes the Tyrannick commands
and irregular motions of inordinate Love in men.

. 7. Plato of Man's Redemption and the Restoration of all things by Christ.
As Plato had clear Notices of Man's Fall and misery, so in like manner he
seems to have been not without some broken Traditions of the Way and Means,
appointed by God, for man's recoverie out of this lapsed and miserable state,
which we may no way doubt were, at least originally, derived from the sacred
fountain amongst the Jews. In the general, Plato, in his Politicus fol. 251.
tells us that After the Golden Age, the universe, by reason of that Confusion
that came upon it, had been dissolved, had not God (...), again taken upon him
to set at the stern, and govern the world and restore its dissolute, and
almost unjointed parts, to their ancient order and place etc. How far Plato had
some imperfect Traditions of a Trinity which he understood not.
Here Plato shows how that pestilential (...) Confusion, which did overspread
the Universe, would quite have ruined it, if God had not again interposed, and
applied a remedy. And, in his Epist. 6. fol. 323 Plato seems to discourse
more particularly and distinctly, of the way and Means of the worlds
Restoration and Conservation: Let there (says he) be a Law constituted and
confirmed by oath, calling to witness (...). The God of all things, the Governor
of Beings present and things to come, the Father of that governing cause, whom,
according to our Philosophye we make to be the true Being, who may be evidently
known by all so far as it comes within the capacity of happy-knowing men.
Serranus on this place tells us, that some understand this description of Plato
to refer to the Trinity, (as his (...) in Epimonide has a peculiar respect to
the Messiah) So Sandford ( de descens. Christi. l. 2. Sect. 37) tells us,
Admonendus es suspicari etiam e Christianis Doctoribus quosdam (ut mihi
videtur) hanc Deorum Triada apud omnes Gentes celebratam, vestigium quoddam S.
Trinitatis fuisse in illorum cordibus, etsi nisi conspurcatum, non penitus
extinctum tamen. Sandf. Desc. l. 1. Sect. 37.
that this Trias or Trinity of the Gods: so famous among all Nations, was, as
some conjecture but a certain vestigium or footstep of the most sacred
Trinity, not altogether extinct; albeit greatly conspurcated or obliterated in
their minds. But albeit we may not grant, Plato had any distinct Notices of the
Trinity, yet he might learn many things which he understood not, from the
Phenician doctrine referring originally to the Trinity, particularly to the
Messiah, the Redeemer of mankind; concerning whom there were many broken, and
originally Jewish Traditions scattered up and down in the Oriental Parts,
especially Phaenicia and Egypt, which these blind Heathens understanding not,
corrupted by many fabulous mixtures, and misapplyed to things they had no
cognation with. Yea Plato, else where, ingenuously confesses he had received
many Fables or mysteries by Tradition from the Ancients, which he understood
not, but expected some Interpreter thereof. Amongst which we may reckon this
great Jewish Mystery, of the Restoration of all things by the Messiah;
whereof Plato had received some glimmering imperfect Notions, or Traditions
which he understood not, but expressed by (...) the Mind, and (...) the word
etc. And whereas some late Admirers of Platonic Philosophy endeavor to prove,
that Plato, and his followers, asserted and owned (...) a Trinity; we must
know, that this belongs not so much to Plato, as to his Commentators, Plotinus,
Proclus and Porphyrie. The new Platonists had their (...) Trinity from
Ammonius who had it from the scriptures
For I cannot remember that I ever met with the word (...) in Plato; though
somewhat of the thing may possibly, be enigmatically delivered by him: only
Plotinus and Porphyrie with proclus discourse much of this (...) Trinity;
which we may presume, they had not from Plato, but from their Master Ammonius,
Head of the sacred succession at Alexandria; who was, if not a Christian, yet a
great Favourer of Christians, and one that made it his business to reform
Platonic Philosophy by the Scriptures; as we have proved at large in Plato's
philosophy: by which it is evident that the Platonic (...) Trinity, and (...)
word owe their original to the sacred scriptures. It Is true; some of the latter
Platonists of the Alexandrine Schole, would fain persuade us, that the
Evangelist John stole his Divine (...), word, from Plato's (...). So Amelius,
as Drusius in Annot. Joh. 1. observes: Amelius, says he, the Platonic
Philosopher, having read this principle, (of the Divine word) complains that
John, the Evangelist, transferred into his book his Masters Mysteries; and
appropriated to himself Plato's Secrets. By Jupiter, says Amelius, this
Barbarian agrees with our Plato, that the WORD of God was constituted in the
order of a Principle. This Imputation of Amelius is indeed most false: for
Plato as well as John, seem both to have derived their Divine (...) from the
Jewish Doctrine and Mysteries. That the Notion (...) word, was not unknown to
the ancient Jews, is evident, from the frequent mention made thereof in the
Chaldaick Thargum; which terms it (...) the word of Iehova; by which those
ancient Paraphrasts understood the M^ssias, as its evident from Genesis 3.8. Ps.
2.12. Ps. 27.1. etc. Caeterum appellatio (...) non Johannis demum tempore nata
sed antiqua, and Judaeis etiam non incognita fuit ex quo patet, ad Gentilium
quoque sapientum, appellationem istam (...) quodammodo pervenisse aures Glass.
Phil. S. l. 1. Tr. 4. Sect. 3.
From this Jewish fountain the pagan (...) so frequent in Plato's schole had
its origination; as Glass. Philolog. S. lib. 1. Tract. 4. S. 3. That the
Philosophers opinions of Christ, and his Redemption of mankind owe their
original to the Scriptures and Jewish church see Justinian the Jesuit,
Comment. in 1. Joan. 1.3. parag. 54. So Tertullian Apol. cap. 21. The ancient
Sophistes (says he) were of this opinion, that the word and wisdom, which
they called (...), framed the world. Zeno says, that this word was the Author
of order. Again he adds This mystery of the Incarnation of the word, was
known by them from whom you receive all your follies of the Divinity, The
Pagan (...) a sacrilegious emulation of the divine word.
which were invented by sacrilegious emulation, to destroy the eternal verities
of one God man, by opposing thereto lies, which have some resemblance therewith
etc. Thus Diodation Mat. 2.2. his Star.] The belief thereof having spread
diverse ways; which, without doubt, were all derived from the Prophets, that
the King of the world was to be borne in Judea. They argued that this Star was
the sign thereof, perhaps from the prophecies of Balaam, Numb. 24.17 which
might come to their notice etc. To this we may add that poetic fiction; that
Minerva, the Goddess of wisdom, was produced out of Jupiters Head; which some
refer to the eternal Generation of Christ, the wisdom of God. Prove. 8: Also the
Phenician Baalim and Grecian Demons, which were but Apes of the True Messiah,
as we have proved in the former Book. chapter 8 S. 5

. Poetic adumbrations of Christ his Nativitie, Passion Ascension etc.
Yea Sandford (or Parker out of his papers) de descensu Christi lib. 3. Sect.
137. mentions several Fables of the Gentile Poets, which adumbrate, or shadow
forth Christ his Nativitie, Passion, Resurrection etc. we think not the same
things with others; but they by imitation, speak the same things with us, says
Justin Martyr, of the Gentile Poets. Albumasar, in his greater Introductorie
tractatu 6: There ascends (says he) in the first face of that sign a
beautiful and honest Virgin, having in her hand two ears of Corn, and she
nurseth a Child; and a certain Nation (i.e. the Jewish) calls this Child
Jesus. Here both Albertus and Sixtus Senensis collect, that our Savior was in
some manner adumbrated in the Gentiles Fables and Figures. Justin Martyr
instanceth particularly in these figments: That Christ the son of God, was to
come, the Devils understood out of the Holy Prophets: whence they produced, by
their Poets, many, who should be called the sons of Jupiter: Supposing by this
means, that men would esteem the matters which concerned Christ for prodigious
Fables, and Poetic narrations, no less then those of the Poets. Therefore
those things which belonged to the one only Messiah they traduced to many. So
in Perseus, they make him to be borne of a Virgin: and under Dionysius, they
feign him to ride on the Colt of an Ass; and being torn in pieces by the
Titans, to return to his Fathers throne in Heaven. Thus Origin contra Celsum
lib. 4. Bacchus ( i.e. the son of God) falling from Jupiters Throne, was torn
by the Titans: and his members being again composed, he ascended alive up to
Heaven. Which fable the Greeks interpreted figuratively of the soul; but it
seems rather to be a shadow of Christ his Descent, Passion, and Ascension. So
also Christ his raising up the dead, was Fabled in the Poets, in Esculapius's
being the Physician and raiser up of the dead. As also the Poets feigning the
Heroes to be sent down to infernal places, and thence to ascend up into Heaven,
seems but a Fable of Christ's suffering the pains of Hell; and afterward
ascending up to Heaven. Whence Sandf. Descens. l. 3. Sect. 137. concludes: That
Christ's descending down to Hell, i.e. suffering Hell pains in his soul, was by
the Poets couched under several shadows, especially under that Fable of
Esculapius, who, as they Comment, restored Dumvirbius ( i.e. as I conjecture
Adam) to life again; whereupon he was, by a Thunderbolt from Jupiter, cast down
to Hell. Whence the Poet Aen. 7. Ipse repertorem Medicinae talis and artis
Fulmine Phaebigenam Stygias detrusit ad umbras.
Only there is none of the sons of Jupiter found, on whom the punishment of the
Cross was transferred; whence it is very probable that this mystery was
unknown, even to the Devils, themselves.

CHAP. VI.
The History of the Flood imitated by Pagan writers. Solons conference with the
Egyptian Priest, touching Deucalion's Flood. The several Assumings of Diverse
Nations in asscribing Noah's Flood to some one of their own Nation. The
Egyptians ascribe Noah's Flood to Prometheus; the Assyrians ascribe it to
Xisuthrus; the Thessalians to Deucalion; the Athenians to Ogyges. Mention made
of Noah's Flood by Abydenus, Berosus, Polyhistor, Mnaseus, Damascenus, etc.

. 1. ANother great piece of Scripture History relates to the Flood, and the
Deluge of man kind thereby, whereof we find many broken Fragments in Pagan
Historians and Writers. Plato, in his Timaeus fol. 22, 23. gives us an
excellent explication of Deucalions Flood; as also of some other pieces of
Antiquity; and that, in imitation of Sacred History. The occasion of this
Discourse was this; Solons conference with the Egyptian Priest, about the chief
pieces of Archaeologie.
he brings in his kinsman Solon travailing to Egypt, to inform himself in the
Wisdom of the Ancients. His words are as follows: When Solon came to Egypt,
he said, he was greatly esteemed and honored by them: but when he inquired of
the Inhabitants and Priests who were most skillful in Antiquity, touching
ancient Matters; he found that neither he, nor any other of the Grecians knew
any thing of true Antiquity. Wherefore he designing to draw the Egyptians, to
discourse of these ancient Affairs, rather then to give his own thoughts of
them, proposes certain Questions; with endeavors to reduce the Series and
account of times, to a certain number of years: and first he demands (...), of
Phoroneus the first so called, and of Niobe; and after the flood again,
concerning Deucalion and Pyrrha, of whom men are wont to Mythologize and
Genealogize, etc. Then one of the Egyptian Priests says, (...) Solon Solon,
you Grecians are always Children: There is no Grecian ancient. Solon demanding
the Reason why he spoke thus; the Priest answered, (...). Ye are all said to be
young in regard of your souls: for ye have therein no ancient opinions, flowing
from first Tradition, nor any Chronologick science. But the cause of these
things is, There have been, and shall again be many Destructions of men, in
many places; and those very great, by reason of the Fire and Water, etc.

Thus Plato concerning Solons conference with the Egyptian Priest, about
ancient Mythologie: which seems evidently but corrupt broken Imitations of
Sacred Records, as may be demonstrated from the particulars here mentioned.
First Plato here mentions the words of a certain Egyptian Priest, telling
Solon, that the Grecians were ignorant of the account of true Archeologie or
Antiquity; having only some Fables or shadows of those real stories, which
were lodged amongst the Egyptians: Proclus conjectures that this Satick Priest
was, in the Egyptian tongue called Pateneit, as Seldom de Iure Nature. Heb. lib.
1. cap. 2. fol. 27. It Is possible that this Priest, whom Plato terms Egyptian,
was really (...)* For it is certain, that there were multitudes of Jews in
Egypt, at, or about the time of Solons being there; who living amongst the
Egyptians, passed under the same name, at least with Plato, who knew full well
that the name of a Jew was odious to his country men; whence he styles them
Egyptians, as else where Phenicans and Chaldeans, on the like account. 2. But
what ever this Egyptian Priest was; that the ancient Traditions, he here gives
us, were originally sacred, we doubt not but to prove even from his own
explication, as it follows.

. 2. First this Egyptian Priest after he had upbraided the Grecians with their
childishnes and ignorance in true Archeologie or Antiquity, he proceeds to the
resolution of Solon's Questions; and shows, that all those great pieces of
mythologie, which Solon was so inquisitive into, namely touching Phoroneus,
Niobe, Deucalion and Pyrrha, were but fabulous Narrations or symbolick Images
and coverts of some real Story and event, which happened to mankind. 2. To
make this good, he lays down this general Assertion, that all the remarkable
changes which had been wrought in the world, (or should be hereafter) and were
the original occasion of these fabulous stories, were wrought by Fire and
Water. Phaeton
He instanceth first in the story of Phaeton who was supposed to have set the
world on fire; which seems to have had its rise either from Gods destroying
Sodom and Gomorrha with Fire from Heaven; or else from the last Conflagration
of the world by fire; Pyrrha
whereunto also the Fable of Pyrrha seems to relate: for (...), whence it is
derived, signifies fire; as in its proper place Niobe
2. As for the Story of Niobe mentioned here by Solon as one of the great
(...) Fables, which deserved great Remark; it seems clearly to refer to the
story of Lots wife, her being turned into a pillar of Salt, at the destruction
of Sodom: as else where. Phoroneus
3. Touching the Fable of Phoroneus, it seems to refer to Pharaoh King of
Egypt, who was drowned in the red Sea; which appears, 1. From the cognation
twixt the Names; the Greek (...) being the same in sound with the Hebrew (...)
Pharaoh. 2. From the Matter: which according to the Priests application, refers
to some Deluge: as in what follows. 4. As for Deucalions Flood, that it was but
(...) a Fable, or Symbolick shadow of Noah's Flood, we shall endeavor to
demonstrate both from the explication of the Egyptian Priest, as also from
other Topics.

. 3. This Egyptian Priest, having demonstrated the many vicissitudes that
happned in Nature, from fire and water; and explicated that by fire, under that
fable of Phaeton, of Deucalions Flood
he proceeds to discourse of the great Deluge by water; Thus Plato ( Timaeus
fol. 22.23.) (...) But when again the Gods, being about to purge the earth by
water, brought a deluge the herdsmen and shepherds were saved on the mountains;
but those that lived in the cities with us, were carried away by the Flood of
waters into the Sea etc. Thus Plato of the Egyptian Priest. Serranus on this
place observes, that this priest says, that those who dwelt on the mountains,
namely the Cowherds and shepherds, were preserved; which is a vestigium or
Symbol of Noah with his sons, being preserved in the Ark, which rested on mount
Ararat. Then the priest goes on to describe the times before the flood thus:
there was in times past before the great Delugs of waters, a famous city,
which now belongs to the Athenians, adorned with the best Laws both for war,
and all civil life which received its first seed from Tellus and Vulcan etc.
Again Plato de leg: fol: 675. Speaks farther hereof thus: (...) etc. There
happened many Destructions of men by Floods etc. where Serranus thus annotates:
Plato here makes mention of a certain Flood, as if he meant not that of
Deucalion, which, without doubt was in Attica only, but some one more
universal, in which the whole world was immersed etc. By which it appears that
the Deluge, of which Plato makes mention was universal and so the same with
that of Noah. This will be farther evident by what follows.

. 4. The Several Assumings of diverse Nations, in asscribing Noah's flood to
some one of their own nation
That the sacred story of Noah's flood, was traduced among pagan writers, under
the assumed names of Xisuthrus, Deucalion, Ogyges, Prometheus etc; and that by
Tradition from the Jews or Patriarchs, is generally confessed by such as are
verst in Antiquity. The Assyrians attributed the Flood to one Xisuthrus; whom
they supposed to be a King of Assyria, who sent out birds to see if the Flood
were assuaged. The circumstances of which stories, as delivered by Abydenus and
Alexander the Polyhistorian make it evident, that it was but a Tradition of
that universal Flood under Noah, as Eusebius in Chronicon ( edit. 2.) fol. 5.
with Scaliger thereon. Touching Noah's parallel with Janus, see before Book 2.
chap. 6. S. 6.
Thus Vossius, de Idol. lib. 1. cap. 18. To this (says he) we may refer, that,
in Alexand. the Polihistorian, and Abydenus; who relate the story of the
Universal Flood. Noah is called Xisuthrus: as in Cyril, the beginning of his
book against Julian the Apostate: 1. The Assyrians ascribe it to Xisuthrus
and he adds, that the word seems to be Assyrian. Which I oppose not; seeing
we find the like word (...) ziz, whence (...) mezuza the post of a door or
threshold, as Deuteronomy. 6.9. From ziz or zuz as it signifies the post or threshold
of a door, by an Anadiplosis, comes Xisuthrus: and thus was Noah called being
as it were the threshold or door i.e. the beginning of all things after the
flood. 2. The Egypti^ to Prometheus
2. The Egyptians ascribe this general Flood of Noah, to Prometheus. So Diodor.
lib. 1. tells us that whilst Prometheus reigned in Egypt, the greatest part of
men were destroyed by a flood etc. That Prometheus was a symbol of Noah we have
in Book. 2. chap. 5. S. 4 proved out of Vossius, and others 3. The Thessalians
to Deucalion
3. The Thessalians make Deucalion to be the person, who escaped the Flood. The
story whereof, as mentioned by Apollodorus, is exactly parallel with that
which the Scripture gives of Noah; and with some transmutation of names viz of
Deucalion into Noah, and of P^rnessus into Ararat etc may be easily identified
therewith. 4. The Athenians to Ogyges
4. The Athenians asscribe the Flood to Ogyges; not that the Flood of Ogyges
and Deucalion were particular Deluges, as many suppose; but as Deucalion was of
Eldest memory in Thessalie, so was Ogyges at Athens; and so the Flood, as
being of matter of greatest Antiquity, was, on the same account, in both
places, attributed to both these. And who knows not, how common it was with the
Grecians to attribute that to their own Country, Cities, and Persons which
belonged to some Oriental Persons or Places. Thus did they corrupt the
Traditions touching the Flood; as Stillingf. Orig. S. lib. 3 chap. 5. Sect. 5.
well observes.

. 5. Pagan Assertions touching the Flood
Bochart, in his preface to Phaleg about the beginning, speaks fully to this
purpose, thus: Also the Ethnic writers in many things agree with Moses. To
search this matter a little at the bottom; the fame of the Flood wherein a few
only remaining, the rest of men perished, was diffused amongst all Nations. The
Hieropolitans (in Lucian Dea Syra) frame a large History thereof, and that
drawn out of their own Archives, every way parallel to Moses's Narration;
excepting that, in stead of Noah, the name Deucalion is substituted. Plutarch
makes mention of a Dove sent forth out of the Ark etc. Abydenus, Berosus,
Polyhistor, Damascenus etc. of Noah's Flood
The same Abydenus. From whom also we learn, that the Ark rested in Armenia;
and that the Relics thereof are yet extant there: which is also taught by
Berosus and Polyhistor, and Nicholas Damascenus. Epiphanius also affirms, that
they were to be seen in his time etc. The like Bochart in in his phaleg. lib.
1. cap. 4. Also Vossius Isago: Chronolog. dissert. 4. cap. 2. and 3. And
Grotius, Annotat. in lib. 1. de Verit. Relig: etc. where we have many
concurring Testimonies of the most Ancients, touching the universal Flood and
its traditional notices amongst the Pagans. So Berosus make mention of the
Flood and Ark wherein Noah was preserved: and Alexander the Polyhistorian the
preservation of Animals in the Ark. Martinius ( Histor: Sinic: lib. 1. page 12)
tells us, that there is great mention of the Flood amongst the Sinicke writers
etc.

. 6. Owen Theolog. lib. 2. cap. 3. page 150. Speaks expressly thus: That many
things concerning the Flood were extracted out of the sacred text, every one
sees: Josephus, Antiq. lib. 1. cap. 4. Relates like things out of Hieronymus
Aegyptius, Berosus, Mnaseus, Nicholas, Damascenus. The same Eusebius in his
Chronicon, out of Abydenus, and Alexander Polyhistor. But many of the first
Mythographers confound the Universal Deluge, with that particular Flood of
Deucalion, or with that of Ogyges (which long preceded) so that Posterity
could understand neither one nor 'tother. Johan. de Laet de origin. Gent
American: lib. 1. page 115) acquaints us that there is a constant Tradition of
the Flood amongst the Indians, both in New France, Peru etc. But none speaks
more fully on this Argument than Preston, on the Attributes of God, Sermon. 3.
page 9. 53. Edit. 2d. The 2d. Argument (says he) by which we confirm the
Truth of the Scriptures, is taken from the Testimonies, that are given to them
by our enemies, the Gentiles themselves being Judges. As to instance in the
Flood; there are many that have made mention of it. Those Floods, that are
related by the ancient Greek Historians, come so near it, that they must needs
have the relation of it from the Jews. They have mingled it with many
falsehoods: we have not the writings of them, but fragments in the writings of
others: as of Alexander Polyhistor in Josephus, and Cyril: They say that there
was a great flood, and that there was one Nisurus to whom Saturn reveled it;
and bad him make an Ark; and he did so, and gathered some of all beasts into
it; and that the Ark was in Armenia; and that the fragments of it are in
Heliopolis and thus Preston.

. 7. Noah's memory preserved under the Names Proncuus, Oannes, Xisuthrus,
Prometheus, Phoroneus
As for the memory of Noah, it was preserved amongst ancient Heathens, under
several assumed names: as among the Chinenses, he passed under the name of
Proncuus; who is by them said to have escaped alone with his Family: among the
Chaldeans, under the Fable of Oannes; who had part of a Fish and part of Man:
as also amongst the Assyrians, under the title of Xisuthrus, as before. Among
the Egyptians and Thessalonians, Noah's memory was preserved under the Symbol of
Prometheus; as in like manner amongst the Peloponnesians he was styled
Phoroneus; whom Phoronides calls (...), the Father of men, or the Protoplast.
Again, among the Grecians and Romans, Noah pased under many fabulous titles;
as of Saturn, whom Bochart ( phaleg. lib. 1. cap. 1) parallels with Noah in 14
particulars as before in our Genealogy of Saturn, Book 2. chap. 1. Sect. 6.
Janus.
He was called also Ianus, as some think from (...); because of Noah's planting
Vines: and that which confirms the same is, that Janus was characterized,
bifrons, one that had a double forehead looking (...) forward and backward; as
Noah saw two Ages. Moreover Macrobius tells, us, that Janus was styled Consivius
a conserendo: because he was the Seminary of Mankind: which is parallel to
Noah. As before Book 2. chap. 6. S. 6.
Again some make Bacchus the same with Noah; in that Bacchus is said to be
twice borne, the Planter of Vines etc. That Deucalion and Ogyges were the same
with Noah, we have already proved. See more of Noah's Ethnic Names in
Dickins^n's Delphi Phaenicizantes Diatrib. de Noae nominibus Ethnicis.
Stillingf. Origin. S. book 3. chap. 4. Sect. 8. and chap. 5. Sect. 5.8.

. 8. Noah's Dove.
Yea we find some memory not only of Noah, but also of the Raven and Dove sent
forth by Noah, preserved in some fragments amongst Pagan writers. Thus Sandf.
de descens. l. 1. Sect. 23. Plutarch, out of the ancient Theology ( i.e. the
Jewish) makes mention of the Dove sent forth out of Noah's Ark.
So Bochart in his Preface to Histor. de Animal, Sacris, tells us, that
peradventure to the Raven sent forth by Noah, belongs the Greek Fable of the
Raven sent forth by Apollo, which returned not 'till after the figs were
ripe. But more expressly in the same Preface, Bochart affirms, that of this
history of the Dove sent forth by Noah, there are very evident vestigia or
characters to be found in Abydenus, Plutarch, and the Arabians etc. To conclude
this discourse of the Flood; we have a concise, yet clear Hypotyposis or
Adumbration given of it by Ovid, Met. lib. 1. Fab. 7. Fit fragor and densi
funduntur ab aethere nimbi
see more in Seneca lib. 3. Quaest. cap. 27. And August. de Civit. Dei, lib.
18. c. 12. with Ludov. Vives thereon.

CHAP. VII. Ethnic stories of the Worlds Conflagration, The last Judgment,
Man's future Immortal state, from sacred Oracles.
Plato of the Worlds Conflagration. The Stoics (...) from the Jews.
Testimonies ancient and Modern to confirm the same. 2. Pet. 3.7. (...). Pagan
notices of the last Judgment. The Jewish opinion of the Seven Thousandth year
to be the day of Judgment. Plato's thousand years from Jewish Tradition. The
opinion of Plato touching the Souls Immortal state, which he acknowledges was
conveyed by ancient Tradition. Thales, Pherecydes, and others touching the
Souls Immortality.

. 1. HAving demonstrated what evident Notices and Traditions the Pagans had of
the first Deluge, or Destruction of the old World by Water, we now proceed to
show, what discoveries they had of the last Conflagration or Dissolution of the
World by Fire, with the day of judgment ensuing, and that in Imitation of
Scripture Tradition, or Sacred Prophecy. As for the Worlds Dissolution by
Fire, that it was well known to the Jews, (though we find no mention thereof in
the old Testament) we may safely conjecture; because we find it mentioned in a
book called Cedrus Libani: also Peter in his second Epistle to the dispersed
Jews, chap. 3. v. 9, 10, 11. 2. Pet. 3.9,10,11.
makes mention of a promise touching the day of the Lord, wherein all things
should be dissolved etc. which possibly refers to Enochs prophecy of the last
Judgment mentioned by Jude, v. 14, 15. Jude 14.15.
and that Pagan writers received their Contemplations of the world's
Dissolution by fire, from some Oracles, originally Jewish, seems evident. The
Poets in their fictions, make Pyrrha the wife of Deucalion: whereby they
symbolically signify unto us, that as the world was formerly destroyed by
Water, so it should be again by Fire: for (...), whence Pyrrha, signifies fire.
Plato's opinion of the last conflagration.
So Plato in his Timaeus fol. 22. tells us, that the great V^ssitudes and
Dissolutions of the World sprang from Fire and Water: and he begins with that
by Fire, which he thus expresses: That fable which is so common amongst you,
touching Phaeton, the Son of the Sun, his burning the world with fire, etc:
this I say (...) has the figure of a fable, but the truth is this; there shall
be a great parallaxe (or change) of things in Heaven and Earth; and in a short
time, a great Dissolution of all things upon the earth, by reason of much fire.
Thus Plato, who here evidently refers the fabulous story of Phaetons burning
the World to the last conflagration. So Serranus on this place: It is, says
he, the common opinion of the Platonists, that the World shall be destroyed by
fire: which they signify by the word (...), refinement by fire. Plato delivers
this as the explication of the Egyptian Priest, in answer to Solons question
about Pyrrha, Phaeton, etc. It Is possible this Egyptian Priest, from whom Solon
received this Tradition, was himself a Jew, though concealed by Plato: however
that the Tradition was originally Jewish, we doubt not but to demonstrate.

. 2. The Stoics (...).
Neither was this the opinion of the Platonists only, but also of some other
Sects of Philosophers, especially of the Stoics, who generally asserted, the
dissolution of the World by fire, which they termed (...), expurgation by fire:
and that in imitation of, and derivation from the Jews. So Seneca, Quaest.
Natural. 3.13. The Worlds period shall be by fire. The like Seneca Epist. de
Consolat. ad Polyb. fol. 64. There are some things that threaten ruineto the
World: and this world, which comprehends all things divine and human, shall,
if we may believe it, one day be dissipated, and immersed in its old confusion
and darkness. Again fol. 92. he speaks more plainly thus. And when the time
shall come, wherein the world being to be renewed, must extinguish it self, all
things shall fall by their own power; and the stars shall rush upon the stars;
and all matter burning in one fire; what ever now shines in the World shall
then Burn. 2 Pet. 3.7.
Grotius in his Annotat. on 2. Pet. 3.7. acquaints us that Seneca had these
Traditions from the Stoics, who called this final dissolution of the World by
fire, (...). This Zeno, of Cittium, received from the Phenicians. For Cittium
was a Colonie of the Phenicians in Cyprus. Heraclitus received the same from
the Pythagoreans. Pythagoras had it from the Jews. There is a mention of this
Tradition in the book called Cedrus Libani: as God in times past let loose the
raines to the waters, so will he again let them loose to fire. So Sophocles
(...)
(...)
Heraclitus's opinion hereof is related by Diogenes Laertius in his life thus,
(...). There is one World, and that produced of fire, and shall he again
reduced into fire. Ovid Metam: lib. 1. fab. 7. expresses this last
conflagration thus: Esse quoque in fatis reminiscitur affore tempus,
Quo mare, quo tellus, correptaque regia coeli
Ardea^, and Mundi moles operosa laboret.
Lactantius thinks this sprang from the Sibylls prophecies: but these, at least
as now extant, seem spurious. I should rather conclude that all these Ethnic
Stories of the last conflagration, owe their Original to some Jewish
Traditions; as it may appear by what follows.

. 3. Besides what observations we have made out of Heathen writers; we have the
same confirmed by Christians, both ancient and modern. Testimonies of Ancient
and Modern touching the Worlds Conflagration.
Minutius Faelix observes this to have been the general persuasion of Stoics,
Epicureans, and Plato: his words are (page 110.) these. Among the Stoics it is
a constant opinion that the humor being consumed, this world shall turn into
fire: and the Epicureans have tho same sentiment of the conflagration of ^he
Elements, and of the ruin of the Universe. Plato says, that the parts of the
world shall now be drowned, and at another time burned, etc. And that these
Prophetic discoveries of this final Conflagration, were diffused amongst the
Gentiles, from sacred Oracles originally, is confirmed by what we find to this
purpose in Amyraldus, Theses Salmur. par. 3. de Resurrectione, page 890. Some
shadow (says he) of this truth touching the Resurrection, seems to have been
apprehended by those, who, in times past held, the world should be purged by
fire, which the Stoics called (...), purification by fire; whence they
affirmed it should be so restored, as that every one should receive a new life.
And although this may seem to be fetched from Zeno's Porch, and so to relate to
their fate; yet the Stoics derived it from elsewhere, for Zoroafter was of the
same opinion, as Clemens Alexandrinus Strom. 5. and Diegenes Laertius affirms,
that Theopompus, a Peripatetick Philosopher, drew the same from the Discipline
of the Magi. Again Clemes Alexandrinus attributes the same persuasion to
Heraclitus, who received it from the Barbarick Philosophy i.e. from a certain
consent of all those men, which amongst various Nations passed for Wise men.
Which seems to have flowed originally hence, that God in times past indulged
his people with some knowledge of the Destruction and Restoration of the
Universe. Thus Amyraldus. That by the Barbarick Philosophy, whence Heraclitus
derived these notions of the final conflagration, must be meant the wisdom of
the Jews, we have hereafter ( part. 2. book 1. chap. 2.) proved.

. 4. 2. Pet. 3.7.
But none speaks more fully to this present purpose than Grotius in his Annotat
on 2. Pet. 3.7. (...)] This says he is a most ancient Tradition confirmed by
Christ: we have testimonies of this Tradition in Hystaspes, the Sibylles, and
Sophocles; also in Ovid, Seneca, Lucan, as we have shown in our Annotates ad
lib. 1. de. veritate Christ. Relig. about the the end. An Indicium whereof we
have in the observation of the Astrologers, touching the approach of the Sun
toward the earth: of which see Copernicus, Revolutionum lib. 3. cap. 16. etc.
Then he concludes thus. These Celestial fires being jumbled together with the
Subterraneous, thence that final Conflagration, so fatal to the world, shall
arise; as formerly the Flood from the coalition of the Celestial waters, and
the Subterraneous etc.

. 5. Pagan Notices of the last Judgment
Neither were the Heathens without many broken Traditions concerning the last
Judgment, which we may no way doubt were conveyed to them, originally, from
the Jewish Church or sacred fountain. The Jews had clear Notices of the last
judgment, which was to ensue upon the worlds Conflagration, and that, as we
may presume, from Enochs Prophecy common amongst them, Jude. 14.15.
as Jude intimates v. 14.15. or from other Divine Revelations. And more
particularly, the Jews had a common and famous Tradition of the worlds duration
6000. years, and the 7000. year to be the day of Judgment etc, of which see
August. de civit. Dei lib. 22. cap. 7. and Lud. Vives thereon: also Mede Diatr.
4. page 476 to 491. Broughton likewise, in his Principal Positions page 14.
asserts the same out of the Jewish Rabbis viz. that the world at the 6000 year
by the old expectation, in all likelihood shall end. So Mede ( Diatr. 4. page
490) says it is true the primitive Fathers, especially those that believed the
Chiliad, conceived the world should last and the church therein labor 6000
years; The Jewish persuasion of the 7000 year to be the day of Judgment
and that the 7000 should be the day of Judgment, and Sabbath, in which the
Saints should reign with Christ their Lord, according to the Jewish persuasion.
Now that the Heathens had some fragments and Traditions hereof, may be evinced
out of Plato de repub. lib. 10. fol. 621, where he thus Philosophizeth Seeing
the soul is Immortal and patient of labor, we must, by a kind of pleasing
violence, follow on toward the Celestial bliss, that we may be friends to our
selves, and the Gods, and Victors in that long passage of the thousand years
etc. The Platonic year an Image of the day of Judgment.
His own words are these, (...), that we may live happily here, and in the
thousand years when we come to them. Here Plato makes mention (...), of a
passage of a thousand years which comes very near the fornamed Jewish Tradition
of the 7000 year being the day of Judgment; whence sprang that notion of Annus
Platonicus the Platonic year, which I take to be the same with, or at least a
corrupt imitation of the Jewish 7000 year, wherein they place the day of
Judgment. Again Plato, in the same lib. 10 de Repub. fol. 614. mentions a
Phenician or Egyptian Fable of Gods righteous Judgment in that great Platonic
year, his words follows: Truly I will relate to thee a Fable of Herus Armenius,
an excellent personage, of the Stock of Pamphilius; who being raised from the
dead, related those things he saw in Hell. He said therefore, that after his
soul was separated from his body, he traveled with many, and came into a
certain Divine place, in which he saw two hiatus's or breaches of earth very
near unto him; also two others above in heaven. Between these hiatus's there
sat judges; who after they had passed judgment on the souls of men deceased,
commanded the just to ascend on the right hand, into the upper place of Heaven,
with the monuments of their judgment hung before them: but the unjust, on the
contrary, they commanded to pass to the left hand, into the lower place, with
memoires of all that they perpetrated in their life time, hanging behind them.
Thus Plato: and Serranus on this place adds, that Plato here, to demonstrate
the just judgment of God, brings a certain (...) fable (or (...)) taken from
the Doctrine of the Egyptians or Phenicians. That Plato derived these his
contemplations of the last judgment from the Mosaic Doctrine, is rationally
argued by Lud. Vives, in August de civit dei lib. 22. cap. 28. Thus Eusebius (
lib. 2. praepar. evang.) supposes that Plato received by Tradition, from the
Mosaic doctrine, both the mutation of the world, and the Resurrection, and the
judgment of the damned in Hell. For Plato relates, that time being expired, the
terrene stock of mankind should come under a Defection, and the world should be
agitated with unwonted manners; yea shaken with the vast Destruction of all
living things: then, after some time, it should be again settled by the endeavor
of the supreme God, who, that the world might not fall in pieces and perish,
will again receive the Government thereof, and add to it Eternal youth and
Immortality.

. 6. Pagan fragments of the Resurrection, last Judgment, and Immortal State of
the Soul.
Yea there seems to have been a Catholic fame and Tradition diffused amongst
mankind touching the Resurrection, Last Judgment, and Immortality of the Soul
which could not, as we may rationally conceive, have its original from any
other, save the sacred fountain of Israel. Socrates is brought in by Plato, (in
Phaedone fol. 91) philosophizing on the souls subsisting and duration after the
Bodies dissolution: and upon a supposition of Cebes, that this duration might
be long, but not eternal; Socrates undertakes to demonstrate, that men's Souls
endure for ever. His words are (...). Cebes truly seems to grant this unto me,
that the soul is more lasting than the body: but this remains uncertain to
all, whether the soul, after the consumption of many bodies, it self having put
of the last body perishes etc. Upon this Question Socrates begins a new
Dispute, and proves, that the soul never perishes; because it was spiritual,
and (...). What Plato means by his (...) is well explained by Alcinous of
Plato's Doctrine, cap. 25: (...) etc. Plato says that the soul was self mobile
because it has an innate or connate life, ever acting of it self. Farther
Plato, in his Timaeus, Philebus, Phaedrus, Mino, Books of common wealth, and
epistles, over and again proves the Immortality of the soul. Yea Aristotle
himself, albeit in his lib. 1. de Anima, he seems to reject his Master Plato's
(...), yet elsewhere he seems inclined to assert the souls immortality, so
lib. 1. de anima text. 4. he describes the Soul (...) to be void of passion and
mixture i.e. Simple and incorruptible. So again textu 7. (...) what is sensible
is corporeal; but the mind is separate i.e. incorporeal and spiritual; whence
he concludes textu 19.20. (...) etc. The mind alone is separate, what ever it
be and this alone is immortal and eternal. See more of this Ioh. Grammat praef.
ad Arist. de Anim. and Voss. Idol. lib. 1. c. 10. Pagan fragments of the
Resurrection, last Judgment, and immortal state of the Soul.
Plato in Phaedo tells us that men should revive, and from the State of dead
become living, and the souls of dead men should remain, and that, in those who
were good, better, but in those who were bad, worse. Again, Plato (or who ever
else were the composer) epist. 7. gives us some account of the conveyance of
these Traditions, touching the Souls final Judgment and Immortality. His words
are (...) etc. We must always give credence to the Ancient and Sacred
Traditions, which declare unto us, that the soul is immortal, and that it has
Judges, and receives great Judgment when it is separated from the body. This
(...), ancient and sacred word, or Tradition, whereby they came to understand
the Immortality of the soul and its future state, Plato, else where (as we
have observed) styles (...), a Divine and more sure word. For having proved the
souls Immortality etc, by the best rational arguments he could produce, he
concludes, there was a Divine and more sure word or Tradition whereby it might
be known: This Divine and more sure word, was no other than the Divine
Scriptures, termed 2. Peter. 1.19 a more sure word of Prophecy; as we shall
hereafter prove. The first Founders of Grecian Philosophy Thales, Pherecydes,
and Pythagoras, (who much traded in oriental, and Jewish Traditions) were very
positive in their Assertions, touching the souls Immortality: Plutarch, 1o de
Placent. Philos: making mention of Thales and Pythagoras their Heroes or
Demons, says they held them to be (...) Souls separate from bodies. Ascensus
animae infelicitatem, id quod Plato a Mose mutuatus est Sandf. Descens. l. 2.
1. Sect. 84.
Moreover Plato's fable of the souls Descent into the body, and Ascent again
unto Felicity seems borrowed from Moses. Thales Milesius the Head of the
Jonick Philosophers defined the soul (...), a being always mobile and self
mobile. And Diogenes Laertius says of this Thales (...), Some say, that he was
the first that affirmed the soul was immortal. i.e. Thales was the first that
discoursed philosophically, of the souls Immortality; which he learned whilst
he was in Egypt, by Tradition, originally from the Jewish Church, or Patriarchs
as we have proved in what follows of Thales's Philosophy. Pherecydes Syrus
Pythagoras's master asserted the same touching the souls (...) Immortality,
and future state, which he received by Tradition immediately from the
Phenicians, (he himself being descended from them) but originally from the
Jews, as we have endeavored to demonstrate, in the account of him and his
philosophy. Cicero in 1. Tuscul. quaes. says that Pherecydes was the first
that asserted the Immortality of the Soul; and that this opinion was after him
confirmed by his Scholar Pythagoras.
Diogenes Laertius, in his proem, tells u^ (...), Theopompus affirmed, that
according to the Magi men should revive and be immortal. That the Magi Traduced
this, as other pieces of their Philosophy from the Church of God originally,
we have endeavored to prove, in what follows of their philosophy. Caesar in
his commentaries de bello Gal. lib. 1. And Valerius Maximus lib. 2. cap. 6.
assert the same of the Druides; namely that they had this particular and strong
persuasion that the souls of men perished not. Yea, besides what has been
mentioned, Owen Theol. lib. 1. cap. 8. adds, that throughout America, there
were scarce any who doubted hereof; yea some had received Traditions of the
last Resurrection, and that before our Europeans arrived in those parts. From
whence he argues that there had obtained a Catholic fame touching future
Judgment, which persuasion was accompanied with a presumption of the souls
Immortality; which though it might be demonstrated by reason, yet seeing it
gained credence rather amongst the vulgar sort than among the Sophists cannot
be asscribed to any other than Tradition; whence he concludes all these things,
it is evident, were conveyed throughout all mankind, from most ancient
Tradition etc. Thus also Sandford Descensu l. 2. Sect. 84. tells us, that
whatever the Ancients Philosophized, touching the various states of souls, in
the Sun and Moon etc, this may be, not without the Imitation of sacred
Scriptures, referred to the Heavenly mansions. And when Plutarch says that the
Sun who gave the mind receives it again; how near does this come to that of
Solomon Eccles. 12.9. The spirit returns to God that gave it. We may affirm
the same of the Indians: Strabo, lib. 15: affirms that the Brachmans fabled
the same with Plato, (...), touching the Immortality of the soul; and that
herein they did (...), Symbolize in Dogmes with the Grecians. Yea according to
the attestation of Hackwell; and other of our English men, who viewed An. 1595
those oriental parts, the Bamianes, Indian Priests, inhabiting Cambaia affirm,
that the Soul returns whence it came; and that there is a Resurrection of the
body etc. The resurrection of the body, and its Reunion with the soul, is
supposed to have been preserved and transmitted among the Heathen Philosophers,
under that corrupt persuasion of their souls (...) termed also (...), and
(...), Transanimation, Migration from body, to body and Regeneration. Which
not only the Pythagoreans, but also many other Philosophers both oriental and
more western, maintained, as the Egyptians according to Herodotus, who, says
Pythagoras, had this Tradition from them. The like Julius Caesar lib. 6.
affirms of the Druides, in France. And Appianus in Celticis affirms the same
of the Germans. Yea Josephus Antiquit. lib. 18. cap. 2 affirms the same of the
Pharisees. Thus Vossius Idololat. lib. 1. cap. 10. It was (says he) the common
consent of Nations, that the soul subsisted after it is separation from the
Body; yea among many there were relics of its reconjunction with the body,
which we call the Resurrection. But this they greatly corrupted in that of the
(...) Metempsuchosis etc. Thus have we demonstrated what evident notices the
Heathens had of the last conflagration, with the ensuing Judgment, and man's
immortal state, and all from sacred oracles and Traditions.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Giants war, the Jewish Asses etc.
Gen: 11.4. The building the Tower of Babel expressed by the Pagans, under the
Symbol of the Giants War etc. Those who were under the confusion at Babel
called (...), men of divided tongues. Genesis 10.8.9. (...) a Giant, thence the
Giants war. Also the Cananites war against the Israelites was couched under the
same fable of the Giants war.

Tacitus's fable of Asses discovering w^ls to the Jews in the Wilderness, Ethnic
Imitations of Samsons Foxes, and Jonah's VVhale. How these Traditions came to
be corrupted.

. 1. The Giants war an imitation of the Tower of Babel etc. Genesis 11.1.
ANother piece of Sacred History refers to the Tower of Babel, its Structure,
and the Confusion which happened thereon, mentioned, Genesis 11.4. whereof we find
many remarkable Traditions scattered up and down amongst Pagan writers. Thus
Bochart in his Preface to Phaleg, about the middle, what follows (says he)
concerning the Tower of Babel, its structure, and the confusion of Tongues
ensuing thereon, also of its builders being dispersed throughout various parts
of the Earth, is related in express words by Abydenus, and Eupolemus, in
Cyrillus and Eusebius, etc. Bochart here proves at large, that upon this
dispersion the Nations were peopled by such as are mentioned in Scripture. So
in his Phaleg. lib. 1. cap. 13. Bochart gives us a description of the Tower of
Babel, out of Herodotus, parallel to that of the Scripture. And whereas it is
said Genesis 11.9. that 'twas called Babel, because the Lord confounded their
Language, hence Pagan writers called those of this dispersion, and their
successors (...) men of divided tongues. So Hom. Iliad. a. (...) generations of
men having divided tongues, i.e. says Dydimus (...), of men having a divided
speech. So Owen Theolog. lib. 3. cap. 4. The Confusion of Tongues was about the
101 year after the Flood, when men were made (...) of divided Tongues. It has
been the common opinion of Antiquity, that men were called (...) from that
division of Tongues, which they suffered at the building of Babel, etc. Again,
Gen: 10.8,9. Genesis 10.8,9.
Nimrod the Head of this faction, who were engaged in this design of Babel, is
called a Mighty one; where the Hebrew (...) signifies a Giant or Mighty one:
whence the Poets fabulous stories of their Gigantomachia or Giants war against
Heaven; which is excellently described by Ovid Metaph. lib. 1. fab. 5. de
Gigant. Affectasse ferunt Regnum Coeleste Gigantes,
Altaque congestos struxisse ad sidera montes.
Thus Stillingf. Origin. S. book 3. chap. 5. The Giants making war against
heaven, was only a Poetical adumbration of the design at the building of
Babel, whose top in the Scripture Genesis 11.4. is said to reach to Heaven (...)
which in the Hebrew signifies only a great height etc. The like Preston on the
Attributes Ser. 3. page 53. ( edit. 2a.) Abydenus affirms that it was a
common opinion, that the men whom the Earth brought forth, gathered themselves
together, and builded a great Tower which was Babel, and the Gods being angry
with it threw it down, with a great wind, and thence sprang the confusion of
Tongues etc.

Others refer the story of the Giants war, to the Cananites their war against
the Israelites, so Sandford, de Descensu Christi l. 1. Sect. 20. It is
manifest, that the Poets sucked in this whole History of the Giants war, from
the Hebrew Monuments, and that the war waged against the Cananites, was the
fountain whence Greece drank most things, which they fable touching their
Giants etc. of which see more B. 2. C. 5. Sect. 3. of Hercules parallel with
Joshua. Mihi porro luculentum videtur Gigantes illos, quorum apud Poet as haud
infrequens est mentio, Amorrhaeos fuisse, Anakaeorum reliquias; and Deos, qui
(ut fingunt) ex Aegypto provenientes adversus Typhonem praelio dimicabant,
Israelitas extitisse; qui and ipsi ex Aegypto processerunt, Ogumque, Anakaeorum
omnium tune temporis facile Principem devicerunt; ejusque Regnum, quod Terra
Gigantum vocari solet in ditionem suam redegerunt. Quam autem ob causam Dii
tandem dicti fuerint Israelitae, in promptu est explicare: notum quippe homines
pios and fideles ab Hebraeis appellari (...) i.e. filios Dei. Hinc ergo Prisci
illi Graeci, qui non modo Hebraicas Historias and res gestas, sed etiam Phrases
modosque loquendi, vel ab ipsis Hebraeis, vel a Phaenicibus edocti sunt,
Israelitas Dei filios appellare didicerunt, tandem vero and Deos. I^a sane: ni
forte per Deos intellexerunt non omnes Israelitas, sed Mosem duntaxat and
Joshuam: quos ipsi prius in Deorum album nefarie cum retulissent, jam tum
nequissime colebant: illum Bacchi nomine, hunc Apollinis sive Hercules.
Dickinson Delphi Phaeniciz. cap. 2.
Though the former reference of Bochart seem more authentic, yet we need not
exclude this latter of Sandford, for it is apparent that the Mythologists
differed much in the application of their fables, and applied the same to
different Persons and times, as their humor inclined them: whence we may well
allow that some of them should refer the Giants war, to the Cananites, as
others, to the Builders of Babel.

. 2. The fable of the Jews worshipping the golden head of an Ass.
To this we may add that fable of the Jews worshipping the golden Head of an
Ass in the Temple at Jerusalem, which seems evidently a mistaken tradition of
some Hebrew Story, Name, or Thing. The first inventor of this figment was
Appion Grammaticus who was an Egyptian, and lived under Tiberius; the occasion
whereof is variously given by the Learned. Tanaquillus Faber, of Caen in
Normandy gives this origination hereof. There was a place of the Heliopolitan
prefecture in Egypt, where Onius builded a Temple after the Jewish Rite called
(...), the Region of Onius; and the Temple it self was called (...) the Temple
of Onius or (...) which those of Alexandria so understood, as if it had been
taken (...), from an Ass worshipped there. Bochart de Animal. Sacr. l. 2. cap.
18. fol. 226. gives this account hereof. 1. We find God styled in Script. (...)
badad, alone, so Deuteronomy. 32. which being of the same, or of a like sound with
(...) boded, a wild Ass Hos. 8.9. these calumniating profane Heathens, by a
blasphemous allusion, interpret the former by the latter. 2. Yet because Appion
was an Egyptian, I had rather (adds Bochart) fetch the origination of this
fable from the Egyptian tongue; wherein (...) is the same with (...) an Ass:
whence those profane Gentiles interpret what is attributed to God, Number.
9.18,20,23. etc. (...) Pijao to signify an Ass. For the Ancients sounded
(...) pi-jao or (...) pieuo as in Porphyrie. Wherefore when the Egyptians read
in the sacred Scripture, or often heard from the Jews, that the Priest
consulted in the Sanctuary or holy place, (...) pi-jao, the mouth of the Lord,
and that pi-jao said etc. they impiously feigned that pieo i.e. in the Egyptian
tongue an Ass, was worshipped by the Jews. Thus Bochart. Owen Theolog. lib. 5.
c. 10. page 379. refers this fable to Arons Calf. His words are these. From
Arons calf some took occasion of coining that famous figment of an Asses golden
head, worshipped by the Jews, in the Temple at Jerusalem. It Is possible this
fable of the Jews worshipping the head of an Ass, might have its rise from
that Prophecy touching the Jewish Messias's riding on an Ass as Genesis 49.11.
of which before.

. 3. Tacitus's fable of the Jews having wels of water discovered to them by
Asses in the Wilderness.
We may refer hereto, what is mentioned by Tacitus and Plutarch, touching the
Jews; who when they thirsted in the Wilderness, had wels discovered to them by
Asses, whereof Heinsius gives us this account. I do no way doubt (says he) but
that this error sprang from Anachronisme, and confusion of Histories: which I
suppose might have its rise, from what they had heard touching the Asses cheek
wherewith Samson slew a thousand men; and from whence by Samsons prayers there
sprang a fountain etc. But Bochart, de Animal. S. part. 1. lib. 2. c. 18. fol.
227. gives this account of this fable. We conceive, that Tacitus affirming
[cum grex asinorum agrestium e pastu in rupem nemore opacam concessit, secutus
Moses conjectura herbidi soli largas aquarum venas aperit] does hereby describe
the desert of Elim wherein, after long thirst, the Israelites had fainted, had
not God by a miracle, sweetened the bitter waters, and at length in the
Palmetree shade, opened so many fountains, as there were Tribes of the people,
Exodus 15.27.
Exodus 15.27. Elim, in the Hebrew (...), signifies Fields. But Josephus, Antiq.
l. 3. c. 1. for Elim, reads (...), as if it had its origiginal from Asses. For
among the Assyrians Ilim signifies Asses. Whether this fable, which Plutarch
and Tacitus relate, touching the Asses discovering Fountains to the Jews in the
desert, sprang hence, yea or no, I leave to others to judge. Thus Bochart.

. 4. we may add hereto other Ethnic fables, which were of Jewish origination.
I shall content my self with one or two mentioned by Bochart, in his preface to
Histor. de Animal. S An Ethnic imitation of Samsons foxes
In memory (says he) of Samsons Foxes Judge. 15.4 there were let loose in the
circus at Rome, about the middle of April foxes with firebrands. Whereunto
appertains that which the Baeotians, who sprang partly from the Phenicians
boast of themselves, that they could Kindle any thing by means of a torch
assixt to a fox: and that of Lycophron a Cilician, by whom a fox is termed
(...), from its shining tail; or from a torch hound to its tail. A fable of
Jonahs Whale
The same Bochart tells us that the great fish, which swallowed up Jonah,
although it be called a whale Man. 12.40 and by the LXX Ion. 2.1. Yet it was
not a wh^le properly so Called, but a dog fash, called Carcharias. Therefore in
the Grecian fables Hercules, is said to have bin swallowed up of a dog, and to
have layen three days in his Intrals. Which fable sprang from the sacred
history, touching Jonah, the Hebrew Prophet; as it is evident to all.

. 5. Thus we have gleaned up many fragments and broken Traditions of Pagan
writers, in imitation of, and derivation from sacred stories and Records. How
these Jewish Traditions came to be corrupted.
I shall conclude this Discourse with some account how these sacred Traditions
came to be so depraved and converted into fabulous narrations: wherein I shall
follow the vestigia of learned Bochart, and Stillingfleet; who have given us a
good origination hereof. Stillingf. Origin. S. book. 3. cap. 5. Sect. 1. etc.
page 578 tells us that it fated with this Tradition of the first Ages of the
world as with a person who has a long time traveled in foreign parts; that
through its continual passing from one Age to another, and the various humors,
tempers and Designs of men, it received strange disg^ises, and alterations as
to its outward favor, and complexion, but yet there are some such certain
marquis, remaining on it, by which we find out its true original. As for the
causes of this depravation they are either more general, or more particular.
The general causes or means, whereby these Jewish Traditions came to be
corrupted by the Heathens were.

1. The gradual decay of knowledge, and increase of Barbarism. 2. The gradual
increase of Idolatry. 3. The confusion of Languages. 4. The fabulousnes of
Poets. The particular courses which the Mythologists took, to disguise ancient
Traditions, were 1. By attributing what was done by the great founders of
Mankind, to some of their own Nation; as Noah's flood to Deucalion, etc. 2. By
taking the Idiom of the Oriental Languages in a proper sense. 3. By altering
the names in ancient Traditions. 4. In Equivocal phrases, by omitting the sense
which was more obvious and proper, and assuming that which was more remote and
fabulous. 5. By ascribing the Actions of several persons to one, who was the
first or chief of them. Of all which more fully hereafter.

CHAP. IX. Pagan Laws imitations of Jewish.
Deuteronomy. 4.5,6. Jewish Laws the fountain of Pagan, as Plato, Diodorus etc. The
Grecian Laws traduced from the Mosaic. Plato of the Grecian Legislators.
Minos's Cretian Laws originally from the Jews. Lycurgus and Solon received
their Laws originally from the Jews. Plato's Laws of Jewish origin. His
College from the Jewish Sanedrim. So likewise his ordering of Priests,
Excommunications etc. Roman Laws derived from the Jews. Numa Pompilius,
Pythagoras, and Zaleucus received their Institutes from the Mosaic.

. 1. Pagan Laws from Jewish.
HAving gone through many ancient pieces of Mythologie, and pagan stories; and
demonstrated their Traduction from sacred History, we now proceed to a fifth
piece of Philologie, which regards Human Laws; which, we doubt not, but to
demonstrate, had their original in derivation from, and imitation of Divine
Laws, communicated to the Jewish Church. This may be first demonstrated from
that great Prophetic Oracle or Prediction, laid down by the spirit of God,
Deuteronomy. 4.5,6.
Deuteronomy. 4.5,6. Behold I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord
my God commands me -- keep therefore, and do them; for this is your wisdom,
and your understanding in the sight of the Nations, which shall hear all these
statutes, and say, Surely this great Nation is a wise and understanding people.
As if he had said, these Statutes and judgments, which I have imparted to you,
as the mouth of God, the great Legislator, carry so much of equity and wisdom
in them, that the very blind Heathens, upon notices given of them, shall
greatly admire, and readily embrace them, as being the most exact Idea and
platform for the government of their civil Policies and Societies.

. 2. That pagan Laws were derived from the Divine statutes imposed on the
Jewish Nation, may be demonstrated from the very confessions of pagan
Legislators themselves. Plato de Legibus lib. 4. confesses, that all Laws came
from God, and that no mortal man was the founder of Laws. His words are, (...)
etc. No mortal man ought to institute any Law, i.e. without consulting some
Divine Oracle. Whence all the first Legislators, Minos, Licurgus, Numa,
Zaleucus etc. pretended, they received their Laws from the Gods Apollo,
Minerva, etc. though indeed they were but broken Traditions of those
Institutes, which were imposed on the Jewish Church by the God of Israel. This
is well observed by Owen, ( Theol. lib. 4. cap. 4 page 332.) The wiser of the
Heathens knew full well, that all Right and Power derived its origin from God
himself. For whereas all power is (...), seated in God, they most rightly
supposed, that none could be duly partaker thereof but by him; and thence they
judged it most equal, that all Laws imposed on the society of the people,
should flow from his Divine institution. This Truth they either saw or heard to
be consigned in the Mosaic (...), Legislation. Hence the most famous
Legislators amongst the Gentiles, Zaleucus, Lycurgus, Minos, and Numa feigned,
that they received those Laws, whereby they intended to oblige the people, from
I know not what Gods; viz. Numa pretended he had his Laws from the Nymph
Aegeria, in the Arecine Grove; Minos from Jupiter, in the Cretensian Den;
Lycurgus from Apollo, at Delphus; Zaleucus from Minerva. Neither indeed do
these figments owe their original to any other, than some common fame, or
Tradition of this Israelitick Legislator.

. 3 Yea it seems very evident, and that from the confession of pagan writers
themselves, as well as from Jews and Christians, That the Mosaic institutes or
Laws were of all, most ancient, and the fountain of the choicest Pagan
Constitutions, or Laws. Thus Diodorus Siculus Biblioth. lib. 1. According to
that ancient institution of Life, which was in Egypt, under the Gods and Heroes
in those fabulous times, it is said, that Moses was the first, who persuaded
the people to use written Laws, and to live thereby, (...), Moses, a man
commemorated to have been of a great soul, and well ordered life. Thus
Diodorus; whereof we have this explication given us by Mariana the Jesuit, in
his preface to Genesis. Moses, after the invention of Letters, was the first of
all that persuaded the people to use written Laws: which is produced by Cyril
out of Diodorus, lib. 1. contra Julian. There was in Egypt, amongst the Jews, a
certain man of great mind and life, called Moses, who first persuaded the
people to use Laws. Thus also Owen, Theolog. lib 4. cap. 4. There is none
(says he) who has taught, that there were amongst mankind any written Laws
more ancient than the Mosaic. Neither is it confirmed by any authentic
Testimony, that there were any stated laws, although unwritten (besides the
dictates of right reason) constituted by the people for their government,
before the Mosaic Age. But that the fame of the Mosaic Legislation should
spread it self far and near, was foretold by the spirit of God, Deuteronomy. 4.5,6.
viz. the Nations hearing of this Legation, should condemn themselves of folly
etc. For the most ancient of the Greeks do acknowledge, that Moses was the
first of all Legislators. So Diodorus Bib. lib. 1.

. 4. But to demonstrate more fully the Traduction of Pagan Laws from Divine
Mosaic institutions, we shall examine the most ancient Legislators, and Laws,
among the Grecians and Romans, with endeavors to evince their cognation with,
and derivation from Jewish institutors and Institutes. Grecian Legislators
received their Laws originally from the Mosaic.
We shall begin with the Grecian Legislators, (who, as it is generally confessed,
were more ancient than the Romans,) and endeavor to demonstrate the Traduction
of their Laws from Moses's Institutes. This is fully asserted by Grotius, de
veritat. Relig. Christ. page 17. Add hereto (says he) the undoubted
Antiquity of Moses's writings: an argument whereof is this, that the most
ancient Attick Laws, whence in after times the Roman were derived, owe their
original to Moses's Laws. Thus likewise Cunaeus de Repub. Hebr. Page 2. Truly
the Grecians, whilst they ambitiously impute their benefits to all Nations,
they place their giving Laws amongst the chiefest. For they mention their
Lycurgus's, Draco's, Solon's, Zaleucus's, or if there be any names more
ancient. But all this gloriation is vain: for this aerial Nation is silenced by
the Jew Flavius Josephus; whose Apology (learned to a miracle) against Apion,
that enemy to the Jews, is extant. -- Flavius shows there, that the Greek
Legislators, if compared with Moses, are of the lowest Antiquity, and seem to
have been born but yesterday, or the other day etc. So far Cunaeus. I find the
same in Mariana his preface to Genesis. Moses (says he) was not only the most
ancient of Poets, but also the first of all Lawgivers: which Josephus lib. 2.
contra Apion. evinceth from the very name of Law, which was altogether unknown
to the Ancients; yea so, that the word is not to be found in Homer's books etc.

. 5. I find no where a better account of the Grecian Legislators, than in Plato
his Minos, fol. 381. where, giving us an account of the first Institutors of
all their Laws, he mentions three as most famous; namely Minos, Licurgus, and
Solon: Minos.
but the chiefest of these he makes to be Minos, who brought Laws out of Crete
into Greece. His words are (...). But the best of these Laws, whence came they,
think thou? Minos. They say from Crete. Serranus on this Text comments thus.
Plato will have Lycurgus, and the Grecian Lawgivers derive their Laws from
Crete, by means of Minos their Conductor and Guide. But the Cretians drew their
Laws from the Jews: for many of the Jews lived and had commerce with the
Cretians, as it is most probable. Thus Serranus. Lycurgus.
As Minos, so Lycurgus also, that great Lacedemonian Legislator, traveled into
Crete, there to acquaint himself with Jewish and Mosaic Institutes, seems
evident by what is mentioned of him by Plutarch, in the beginning of his life;
where he relates, that Lycurgus traveled into Crete, there to inform himself
touching ancient Laws etc. Now that the Cretians received their Laws from the
Jews, may be farther evident from that great commerce and correspondence which
was between them, by reason of their vicinitie, and the Phenicians navigation
unto Crete etc. Farther, that Solon, the great Athenian Lawgiver, derived the
chiefest of his Laws from the Mosaic Institutes, seems very probable hence,
Solon.
because (as we have before proved out of Plato's Timaeus, fol. 22. chap. 6..
1.) Solon traveled to Egypt, on purpose to inform himself touching the
wisdom of the Ancients, i.e. the Jews etc. More concerning Solon's being in
Egypt etc. see Vossius de Philosophor: sectis cap. 2.. 3. Yea Carrion, in his
Chronicon lib. 2. of Solon, says expressly, that Solon did so wisely
distinguish forensick Actions, that their order answers almost exactly to the
Decalogue. And that the Attick laws were in their first institution exactly
parallel to, and therefore imitations of the Mosaic Institutes, I suppose will
appear very evident to any, that shall take a full view of Attick Laws, as laid
down by Petit, in his learned book de legibus Atticis. I shall only mention
that law of the Areopagites, against casual man slaughter, by punishing the
offender (...), with an years banishment, parallel to the Jewish city of
Refuge, as Masius in Josh. 20.

. 6. That Plato derived the original Idea of his Politic Constitutions and
Laws from Moses's Institutes, I conceive may be evidently demonstrated from
their cognation each to other. Plato's College from the Jewish Sanedrim.
1. Plato's institution of his sacred College, (...), such as were to be
Conservators of his Laws, has a very great cognation with, and therefore seems
to be but an imitation of the Jewish Sanedrim. This College we find instituted
by Plato, de Leg. 12. fol. 951. (...). Then he ordains, that there should be
present in this College, in the first place, some of the Priests, (...), such
as excelled in virtue, and the faithful discharge of their Office. Thence he
adds of the Conservators of the Laws, such as excel in virtue and age, ten.
Lastly he concludes with a Curator, or Provist of the whole Discipline etc.
This College he terms (...), the Night-Colledge, which consisted of the
chiefest of the Priests, the Elders of the people, and the chief magistrate;
exactly parallel to the great Sanedrim of the Jews, consisting of the chief
Priests, the Elders of the people, and the chief magistrate. Whereunto also the
Roman Senate seems to answer, which consisted of Priests, and Consuls, as
Grotius de Imp. sum: circa sacra, page 388.

Plato's Law for the ordering of Priests.
2. Again Plato de leg. lib. 6. fol. 759. makes a law for the ordering of
Priests, which seems evidently to be of Jewish origination. His law runs thus:
(...) [ scil. (...)] (...). After the examen and election of the Priest, let
him be approved, who is perfect and legitimate: which answers in all points to
the Jewish Priests their Election, and Approbation; who were to be without
blemish, and legitimate.

For Excommunication.
3. Plato de Leg. 9. fol. 881. institutes another Law, for the Excommunication
of such as should strike their Parents. His law runs thus. He that shall be
found guilty of striking his Parent, let him be for ever banished and
excommunicated from Sacreds. Yea (he ordains farther) that none eat or drink
with such an excommunicated person, lest he be polluted by communion with him.
Every one may see how exactly this answers to the Jewish institutes about
Excommunication, etc. Clemens Alexandrinus, in admonitione ad Gentes, speaking
to Plato, says expressly, (...): But as for Laws, whatever are true, as also
the opinion of God, these things were conveied to thee from the Hebrews.

Against selling possessions see part. 2. book 4. chap. 1.. 3. of Aristoles
Politics.
4. Yea not only Plato's, but also Aristotle's Politics, at least some of
them, seem to owe their origin to Mosaic institutes. For Aristotle, in his
Politics, gives us certain ancient Laws against selling their possessions;
which seem plain derivations from Moses's institutes against selling
possessions etc. as Cunaeus de Repub. Heb. page 21.

. 7. Roman Laws of Jewish origin.
As the Grecian, so the Roman Laws also, own their origin to the Mosaic
institutes. This necessarily follows upon the former; for (as we before. 4.
proved out of Grotius) the Roman Laws were for the most part extracted out of
the Attick and Grecian. So Melancthon, in his Preface to Carion's Chronicon,
tells us, that the Roman City received its chiefest Laws and judicial order
from Athens. For she frequently imitated the particular Examples of this
Republic, as when the greatness of Usuries gave an occasion to Sedition, Rome
followed the counsel of Solon, concerning (...), and reduced Usuries to the
hundreds etc. Albeit the Romans received much of their Civil Law from the
Grecians; yet as for their Pontifick or Canon law, it proceeded muchly from the
Etrusci, who received theirs from the Hebrews. So Grotius in his Annotat. on
Mat. 12.1. In the Pontifick Roman law, whereof a great part proceeded from the
Etrusci; and the Etrusci received it from the Hebrews, etc. yea, we have proved
at large in what foregoes ( Book 2. chapter 9. of Politic Theology) that the
Pontifick Laws, for Collegiate Order, Priests, Vestments, Purifications, and
all other Sacreds amongst the Romans, were but imitations of Jewish institutes.
The same might be farther evinced touching their Civil Law, the 12 Tables, the
Agrarian Law, etc. which seem evidently derivations from Moses's Judicial Law.

. 8. Roman Lawgivers.
But this will be more apparently demonstrated, by a brief reflection on the
first great Lawgivers amongst the Romans. To begin with Numa Pompilius, the
main Founder of the Roman Laws, whom some suppose to have been instructed by
Pythagoras, the Jewish Ape; because of that agreement which is to be found
betwixt his Institutions, and those of Pythagoras. But this crosses the course
of Chronology, Numa.
which makes Pythagoras much younger than Numa. I should rather judge, that
Numa received his Laws immediately from the Phenicians, who frequented the
Sea-portss of Italy, even in, and before Numa's time. That Numa received his
Laws originally from the Jews, is asserted by Clement. Alexandr. (...) lib. 1.
and by Seldom. de Jure Not. Gent. Hebr. lib. 1. cap. 2. fol. 14. Numa (says
he) the King of the Romans, is thought by Clement strom. 1. from the similitude
of his Doctrine, to have been instructed by the Jews, at least to have imbibed
their Doctrine etc. This resemblance betwixt Numa's discipline, and that of the
Jews, appears in many particulars, as in his forbidding graven Images of God,
his Pontifick Law, College Priests, etc. as before book 2. chap. 9.. 1. etc.
Pythagoras.
To Numa we may add Pythagoras; who, though a Grecian by birth, yet gave many
Laws to the Italians, both by his Philosophic Instructions, Zaleucus,
as also by his Scholar Zaleucus, who gave Laws to the Locrians, and others.
Zaleuc, Pythagoras's Disciple, who lived about the Babylonian Captivity, was
the first that committed Laws to writing, in imitation of Moses's written
institutes. For Licurgus's Laws were not written. Thence Strabo speaking of the
Locrians, to whom Zaleucus gave Laws, says, (...), They are thought to be the
first that used written Laws. Now Zaleucus received these Institutes, he gave
to the Locrians, from his Master Pythagoras, who had them from the Jews; as we
have proved in what follows of Pythagoras his Politics. For the conclusion of
this Discourse, take the Observation of Austin, de civit. Dei lib. 6. cap. 11.
where he brings in Annaeus Seneca, discoursing thus of the Jews. Whilst the
custom of that wicked nation so greatly prevailed, that now it has obtained
through all parts of the Earth: so that the conquered have given Laws to the
Conquerors. Wherein Seneca acknowledges, that the Jews gave Laws to all
Nations.

CHAP. X. Pagan Rhetoric and Oratorie from Jewish.
Longinus's imitation of Moses. Symbolick Rhetoric from sacred Symbols.
Plato's rules of Rhetoric no where to be found so perfectly as in Scripture.
Orators must 1. aim at Truth, 2. at Virtue. 3. They must be virtuous. 4. Their
Orations must be harmonious, and uniforme. 5. Pathetick. 6. Masculine, not
flattering. 7. Examples necessary. 8. Repetitions. Aristotle's rules, that an
Oration be 1 harmonious, 2 proper, 3 clear, 4 weighty, 5 natural, 6 Majestic
etc.

. 1. Sacred Rhetoric the Idea of Profane.
THe last piece of Philologie, I shall mention, is Rhetoric, or Oratorie;
which Aristotle, in Sophista, tells us, was first invented by Empedocles: but if
we consider Rhetoric in its original, native purity, and perfection, we need
no way doubt, it was first seated in the Scripture; whence, as we may
conjecture, the ancient Heathens borrowed much of their skill therein. And
indeed, such is the incomparable Majesty of the Scripture style and
Phraseologie, joined with so great purity and simplicity, as that all human
Eloquence, or Oratorie must be necessarily confessed to come short thereof.
Longinus's imitation of Moses.
Yea Longinus, a man otherwise very averse from, and abhorring of the Christian
Religion, was so far affected herewith, as that in his book (...), of
sublimitie of speech, he greatly affects an imitation of Moses, as the best
pattern of Oratorie. So Camero, fol. 345. tells us, that Longinus, in his book
(...), has taken the pattern (...), of the sublimitie of speech, from none so
much, as from Moses's writings etc. And indeed what Pagan Orator ever was
there, that had so much of sublimitie, mixed with such a native simplicity, as
Job, and Esaiah? who ever spoke or writ with such a (...) or affectionate
Poetic strain, as David, and Jeremiah etc?

. 2. Pagan Rhetoric its cognation with, and derivation from Scripture
Rhetoric.
But to come to a more close and particular Demonstration, that the Majesty of
Scripture style was the original Idea and exemplar of that sublimitie of speech
or Rhetoric, in use amongst the Heathens, we may conjecture from the
consideration of those particular Canons, which are given by Pagan
Rhetoricians, or observed in their choicest pieces of Oratorie; but no where to
be found, in such a degree of perfection, as in the sacred Scriptures.

Pagan Symbolick Images of Truth from sacred.
1. The most ancient piece of Rhetoric or Oratorie, commended and practiced by
Heathen Masters of Speech, consisted in the right framing and application of
Metaphors, Allegories, and other Symbolick Images, sensible Forms or
similitudes, whereby the Ancients were wont to paint forth, or give lively
colors to their more choice and hidden Notions, and Things. And the great
Canon, on which they founded this artificial mode of expressing things, was
this, (...), Sensible forms are but imitates of Intelligibles. This kind of
metaphorick Elegance of Speech began first in the Oriental parts, and was
conveyed thence by Pythagoras and Plato, with others, into Greece; as he that
is versed in Pythagoras's Symbols, and Plato's Allegories, will easily grant,
they abounded much in this kind of Eloquence. The advantages of Symbolick
Rhetoric.
Thus Serranus, in his Preface to Plato, observes well, that it was the mode of
the Ancients, to represent Truth (...), by certain Symbols, or sensible Forms.
That Plato followed this mode, is not to be doubted. Neither indeed is this
method of teaching without its Reasons. For (...), or the lively representation
of things by such sensible Images, is mighty efficacious for the striking and
affecting men's minds, which are much moved hereby. For when Truth is clouded
with much obscurity, we ascend unto it more safely, and more compendiously, by
these sensible Gradations: and she, lying hid in these shadows, penetrates men's
minds more powerfully. Neither is there wanting to this study and indagation
Delight, which is the Mistress of Disquisition. Moreover, this designation of
things, by their proper Notes, does much relieve the Memory: for by exciting
the mind by Novitie, Admiration, and an opinion of Beauty, it does fix the
things themselves more firmly in the mind. All which Plato has mentioned, not
from himself, or from human Reason, but from a more happy Doctrine, namely from
that of Moses, and of the Prophets. Thus Serranus. By which it appears, that
Plato, and the rest of those great Masters of Speech, received this their
Symbolick mode of Discourse, from the sacred fountain of the Jewish Church.
Aristotle also, in his Rhetor. page 208. commends the use of Metaphors rightly
applied in Rhetoric. His words are (...), we ought to metaphorize from things
proper, and not manifest. Though he disliked the luxuriant Metaphors and
Allegories of Plato, yet he does commend the right use of Metaphors. That the
Jewish Church was the fountain of all these Symbolick Elements, and sensible
Images, so much in use amongst the ancient Rhetoricians, (as well as
Philosophers,) we shall prove at large hereafter in Pythagoras's Philosophy:
at present see Diodati on Gal. 4.3.

. 2. Plato's rules for Rhetoric.
There are other properties of persuasive Eloquence, or Oratorie, which are to
be found no where in so perfect a degree as in Scripture. I shall begin with
such as are mentioned by Plato, who seems most accurately skilled both in the
Theorie and Praxis of Oratorie, or persuasive Speech. Plato in his Phaedrus,
fol. 267. gives us these parts of of an Oration: (...) etc. Proeme, Narration,
Testimonies, sensible Demonstrations, probable Conjectures, probation by
Authority, and Confirmation thereof; Confutation, and Refutation, as in
Accusation, and Apology; Adumbration, Commendation, Vituperation, Gemination
of words; famous Sentences, Similitudes, with Conclusion, etc. I shall not
insist upon all these parts of Oratorie, but pick out some more essential
thereto, and more fully insisted on by Plato.

1. Rhetoric for the illustration of Truth.
1. Plato lays down this as the Head and principal part of Rhetoric speech,
that it conduce to the illustration of Truth. Whence he condemns such, who are
wholly taken up about Metaphors and Similitudes, without any regard to that
Truth, which is, or ought to be, couched under them. So in his Phoedr. fol.
262. Plato tells us, that he who is ignorant of the Truth of things, can never
rightly judge of that similitude wherewith the thing is clothed. -- Is it not
manifest (says he) that those who conjecture beside the nature of things, and
thence fall into error, are therefore deceived, because they stick wholly about
the similitudes of things etc? So again fol. 260. We are assured, there neither
is, nor ever will be any true Art of speaking without Truth, (...), Oratorie
without Truth is not an Art, but an inartificial Trade. In brief, Plato makes
Oration or persuasive speech to be the handmaid and ornament of reason or
Truth; and hence he counts him the best Orator, who does in a most lively
manner represent and illustrate Truth etc. Now where can we find Truth more
lively illustrated than in the sacred Scriptures? what apposite similitudes and
Resemblances of Truth do we find there? etc.

. 3. 2. Rhetoric must draw men to virtue.
2. The main end or design of Rhetoric, according to Plato, is to draw men to
virtue. As Truth is the immediate subject, so virtue the ultimate end of all
Oratorie. So Plato Phaedr. fol. 271. (...), the faculty of speaking well is to
draw the soul etc. This (...), or alluring of the Soul to virtue, which Plato
makes the chief end of Oratorie, is more fully by him explicated fol. 272.
where he gives this as the last and best character of a good Orator, that he be
a person virtuously inclined; and thence, that all his Oration tend to this, to
bring men to be conformed to God: (...) etc. A wise Orator ought to strive how
he may speak, or do things pleasing, not to men, but to the Gods; whom he
should endeavor to obey to the utmost. Whence Plato, Gorg: 513. tells us, that
the chief work of a good Rhetorician is, to make men good Citizens, like to God
etc. His words are (...). This therefore must be chiefly endeavored by us, to
cure the City and Citizens of moral diseases; thereby to make them excelling
in virtue: for without this, all our endeavors signify nothing, etc. Whence he
condemns Pericles, though eloquent, as a bad Orator, because, by his
flattery, he made the Athenians worse than he found them. And he commends
Socrates as most excellent, because he spoke (...), to make men best, not best
to please. Hence Plato, Gorg. 455. gives this definition of Rhetoric: (...):
Rhetoric is a composition of persuasive, not demonstrative, speech, concerning
what is just and unjust. Now all this makes much for the precellence of
Scripture Rhetoric, which infinitely excels all other, as well in moral as
Divine Ethics, or precepts, and incentives to virtue. All Pagan Rhetoric
comes infinitely short of the Scripture persuasives and motives to virtue.

. 4. 3. Orators must be just and virtuous.
Virtue being the chief end of Oratorie, hence Plato makes this an essential
quality of a good Orator, that he himself be virtuous. So in his Gorg. fol.
460. (...): Its necessary, that a Rhetorician be just; that he wills what is
just, and that he does just things. A Rhetorician therefore never wills to do
unjustly. So in his Gorg. fol. 508. Plato adds, (...): he that will act the
part of an Orator aright, must be both just, and one that understands just
things. Thus again, in his Laches, fol. 188. Plato brings in Laches commending
Socrates's mode of teaching; and showing, that he was the best Praeceptor,
whose life did accord with his doctrine; which was an excellent kind of Music,
or Harmony, not Ionick, but Dorick, and that which most delights the Auditors.
Whereas on the contrary, he that teaches well, but acts ill, by how much the
more elegant he is, by so much the more he offends: so that he seems to be
(...), an hater of Eloquence, rather than (...), a lover of the same. Thence
fol. 189. Laches adds, I knew Socrates first by his good deeds, more than by
his words; (...), and there I found him worthy of good Oratorie, and all
freedom of speech. Thus Plato: whereby he teaches, us, what harmony there
ought to be in a good Orator, betwixt his words and deeds; that his Actions
must teach, as well as his Tongue. Whence Diogenes blamed the Orators of his
Age, because they did (...), endeavor to discourse eloquently of righteous
things, but not to do them. And this certainly enhanceth Scripture-Oratorie;
the Composers whereof did both speak and live at a more transcendent rate, than
ever Pagan Orators pretended to, much less did.

. 5. 4. Orations must be uniforme.
As to the form of an Oration, Plato tells us, that it must be like an Animal,
which has all parts rightly disposed. So in his Phaedr. fol. 264. (...), etc.
Every Oration must be as a living Creature, which has a body; so that it must
not be without an head, or without a foot, but must have the middles and
extremes so exactly delineated, as that they may agree amongst themselves, and
with the whole. Thus Plato: wherein he shows, that a good Oration must be
(...), methodically, and harmoniously composed; so that (...), proportion of
the parts, both amongst themselves, and with the whole, is the spirit and soul
thereof. And surely there is no piece of Pagan Oratorie so methodical and
harmonious, as sacred Scriptures.

. 6. 5. Orations must be pathetick.
As for the (...), Affections or properties of an Oration, Plato tells us, that
it must be very pathetick, and affectionate. So in his Gorg. fol. 481. (...):
unless an Orator has a (...), or moving Affection, he cannot demonstrate unto
others his (...), or moving object. Hence Plato makes this one main part of an
Orator, to understand the right knack of moving men's minds, and affections;
wherein the hinge of persuasive Rhetoric consists. Whence also he conceives it
a necessary accomplishment of an Orator, to understand the doctrine (...), of
the Affections. So also Aristotle, in his Rhetoric, discourses at large of
the Affections, and of the manner how they are to be excited and moved by
Rhetoricians. And indeed this is (...), the business of an Orator, to take the
fancy, and by it to move the Affections; as the great work of a Logician, and
Philosopher, is to convince the Judgment, and incline the Will, those more
rational faculties. This Plato seems to hint, in his Gorg. fol. 455. by
showing, that the design of an Orator is to persuade (...), in order to the
exciting the Affections; whereas a Logician persuades (...), by Demonstration
etc. So Aristotle, in his Rhetor. lib. 3. cap. (...) etc. An Auditor does
always sympathize with his Orator that speaks pathetically, although he speaks
nothing to the purpose; wherefore many Orators, making a great noise, do
astonish their Auditors. Here Aristotle shows, how exceeding powerful
pathetical Oration is; vehemence of speech being usually reputed a symbol or
Index of the weight and magnitude of a matter. Now where was there ever found
such an admirable (...), or affectionate moving discourse, as in the sacred
Scriptures?

. 7. Rhetoric must be severe and masculine, not flattering.
Another (...), or property of an Oration, according to Plato, is, that it be
masculine, severe, pungent, and penetrant, not adulatorie, glavering, or
flattering. So in his Gorgias, fol. 508. says Plato, (...): The very son and
companion must be severely accused, if they offend: and in this we must make
use of Rhetoric, etc. Hence Plato is very invective against the Sophistick
Rhetoricians, and flattering Orators of his times; such whose whole design was
to glaver, and flatter men into wickedness, rather than to reprove them for it.
So Gorg. 463. Plato brings in Socrates greatly inveighing against this
Sophistick glavering kind of Rhetoric, which he thus describes and
distributes. (...), etc. The head of this Sophistick Rhetoric I call
flattery, whereof there seems to me to be several parts; one is Culinarie
Rhetoric, such as is in use amongst Trencher-Knights; which is not an Art, but
practice, and Trade, to get money, or fill the belly; the parts whereof I make
to be Comic and Sophistick Rhetoric. Then he discourses first of Sophistick
Rhetoric thus: (...) [(...)] (...), Sophistick Rhetoric is but an Idol of
Politics. Thence he proceeds fol. 465. to declaim against Comic Rhetoric,
(...) etc. Comic Rhetoric is mischievous, deceitful, ignoble, servile, etc.
Thence he gives the reason why this flattering kind of Rhetoric is so vain and
hurtful, fol. 465. (...) etc. I say that Flattery is base, because it aims at
what is sweet and pleasing, not what is best. I do not say that it is an Art,
but Practice, without reason; an irrational desire etc. whence in the same
folio 465. Plato concludes, (...). I say, that Rhetoricians and Tyrants have
very little power etc. His meaning is, that such flattering Orators have little
efficacy or power in all their Harangues, to move sober minds and well
inclined Affections. This invective of Plato against these meal mouthed
Orators, is greatly admired by Cicero, whose words are these; I greatly admired
Plato ( in Gorgias) because he seemed to me in deriding Orators, to act the
highest part of an Orator, etc. i.e. Plato in deriding those sophistick,
comic, glavering Orators, discovered a very masculine, severe, pungent kind of
Oratorie. Thus also the Cynicks universally, were very tart and satyrick in
their Declamations against this flattering kind of Oratorie: so Antisthenes (as
Diogenes in his life) in a time of urgent necessity, said, (...): Its betterin
time of need to fall into the hands of crows, then of flatterers: there is a
peculiar elegance in the Greek. And Diogenes the Cynick, being asked what kind
of beasts, did bite most perniciously; replied, (...): of tame beasts the
flatterer, and of wild beasts, the Sycophant bites most dangerously: whence he
said also, (...): a flattering oration is but a honey-snare. See Diogen. Laert
in the life of Diogenes.
Thus we see how the most judicious of the Pagans, greatly commended a severe,
masculine, pungent kind of Oratorie; condemning that which was effeminate,
glavering, and compleasant with men's humors and lusts. And is there any piece
of Pagan Oratorie in the world so masculine, so pungent, so penetrating, and so
free from men-pleasing flattery, as that in the sacred Scripture?

. 8. Examples.
As for the matter of an Oration, Plato commends very much examples, as that
which greatly conduces to the lively illustration of any Theme. So in his
Phaedr. fol. 260. (...): we do speak but poorly, when we want examples to
illustrate what we speak. And indeed Plato greatly excelled in the use of
apposite and lively examples, for the illustrating of matters; wherein he
attained such an admirable dexterity, as that posterity have admired him for
the same. And we are not without probable conjectures, that Plato gained this
piece of Rhetoric from the Jewish Church and Scriptures. Farther Plato by his
practice, if not by express Rules, commends very much Interrogations. For
indeed his choicest and most pathetick Discourses are made up of Questions;
which express not only quicknes of spirit, but also much passion and
Affection; and therefore are frequently used in the sacred Scriptures, whence
we have reason to conclude Plato borrowed this manner of Rhetoric speech, as
hereafter in his Logic.

Lastly Plato commends much, the use of Repetitions as that which carries in it
a great (...) or movingnes of Affection. So in his Phileb. fol. 60. (...): The
old proverb seems good, that what is excellent in a speech, should be repeted
twice, and a third time. The like Aristotle, in his Rhetoric lib. 3. cap. 12.
(...), concerning that, whereof much is spoken, it is necessary, that we make
repetition. Now its well known how much the sacred Scriptures abound in elegant
Repetitions; and that beyond any Pagan Orators.

Repetitions.
Thus we have shown how all those Rules, which Plato lays down as
qualifications of true Oratorie are to be found no where, in so perfect a
degree, as in the sacred Scripture. And why may we not conjecture, that Plato
traduced many, if not the most of these Rhetoric Canons from Scripture
Rhetoric! Certain it is that Plato, received, whilst he was in Egypt, many
Traditions, which were originally Jewish and Scriptural: and it is not
improbable, that he had them immediately from the Jews who were in great
multitudes in Egypt, whilst he resided there, which was for no less than 14
years space, as hereafter in the story of his life.

. 9. Aristotle's rules of Rhetoric.
I shall conclude this Discourse of Oratorie with some other Canons delivered
by Aristotle, which give a farther accent and luster to saered Rhetoric.
Aristotle Rhetor. lib. 3. cap. 5. gives several rules for Rhetoric, or
eloquent speech, as (...), etc. The beginning of Elocution is to speak
accurately, which consists in 5 particulars. 1. To speak things in connection,
or harmoniously. 2. To speak in proper Terms, not with circumlocution. 3. Not
to use doubtful Phrases; because an Ambages of words is very deceitful:
wherefore your soothsayers utter their Oracles in ambiguous and general terms;
wherein lies much deceit, etc. Now how exactly do these rules suit with
Scripture Rhetoric! what harmony and connection of parts? what propriety,
perspicuitie and clearnes of terms is there herein? 4. Again Aristotle tells us
(...), an oration, if it does not manifest the matter, loses its design. 5.
Then, as to the matter of an Oration, we are told, it must be weighty, proper,
affecting, etc. So Aristot. Rhet. lib. 3. cap. 12. (...), men give heed only to
things great, proper, wonderful, sweet; therefore an oration ought to be
composed of these. And where can we find such matter, if not in sacred
Rhetoric? 6. Farther as to the Quality of an oration, Aristotle tells us, that
it must be natural, not feigned, artificial, or starched; so Arist. Rhet. lib.
3. cap. 2. (...), we should not seem to speak artificially, but naturally: for
this is most persuasive: whence, adds he, illiterate men, usually persuade
more effectually, than the learned; because they seem to speak most naturally,
and from an inward feeling sense. And is there any piece of Pagan Oratorie that
may compare with the sacred Scripture in point of Naturalitie and Simplicity,
etc. 7. Aristotle gives this as another character of true Oratorie, that it be
Majestic, and Grave, without a gaudy dress: (...) [(...)] (...), an oration
must be grave and extatick. Whence also he tells us, that an Orator must seem
rather serious than eloquent. And where can we find a majestic grave and
serious style, if not in sacred Rhetoric? 8. Lastly Aristotle commends the use
of proper epithets, as very pathetick. So Arist. Rhet. lib. 3. cap. 7. (...),
epithet names are very agreeable to one, that would speak pathetically. And
surely there is no piece of Pagan Oratorie that afforded such proper Epithets,
as sacred Scripture?

The perfection of sacred Rhetoric.
To sum up all. Where can we find more proper and significant Symbols,
Metaphors, and other such like Rhetoric shadows, and Images, than in sacred
Scripture? how natural, simple, and grave is its style? what a masculine (...)
does it abound withal? how weighty, and yet delightful is its matter? how
exactly proportionate and becoming are its parts? how harmonious and beautiful
is its form? with what Integrity, Holiness, and Majesty were its Penmen
adorned? and how powerful and efficacious were they in their Ministry? Whence
we may safely conclude, at least thus much, that sacred Scripture is the most
perfect Idea of all true Masculine Oratorie. Neither are we without some
probable conjectures, that Plato (who is supposed to be one of the first
renowned Grecian Orators, and Rhetoricians) traduced his choicest pieces of
Rhetoric, or finenes of speech, from the sacred fountain of Israel. Touching
the perfection of Scripture Rhetoric, see Glassius his Rhetorica sacra, etc.
That the Jews had eloquent Orators in Isaiah's time (which was before any Greek
Orators that we find mention of) is evident from Isa. 3.3. the eloquent Orator.
We read also of a Jewish Orator, called Tertullus: Act. 24.1.

CHAP. XI. How Jewish Traditions came to be mistaken by Pagans.
One great cause of the corruptions and mistakes about Jewish Traditions, was
Pagan Mythologie; which sprang 1. From mistakes about Hebrew Paronomasies, and
Idioms. Genesis 8,9. and 9.20. 2. From attributing to themselves, what belonged to
others. 3. From Equivocations. 4. Alteration of Names etc. The original
grounds, that moved the Grecians, and others, to alter and disguise Oriental
Tradition, were 1. their enmity to the Jews, 2. their proud assumings, 3.
their ignorance of Jewish Records and Affairs.

. 1. HAving gone through the chief parts of Philologie, with endeavors to
evince their Traduction originally from the sacred Scriptures, or the Jewish
Church, Language, and Wisdom; we shall add, as an Epilogue, to this Treatise
some general account, how these Scriptural Records, and Jewish Traditions came
to be so greatly corrupted or mistaken by the blind Pagans. How Jewish
Traditions came to be so corrupted and mistaken.
This being cleared, will obviate that objection, which is made against this
design of demonstrating the Traduction of Pagan knowledge from the Jewish
Church. For, say some, if the Heathens had such clear Notices of the Jews,
their Principles, Discipline, Customs, etc. how comes it to pass, that they
make no more mention of them, yea that they seem rather altogether ignorant of
the Jews, their doctrine, customs, and manners; as it appears evidently by
the stories of Tacitus, Suetonius, Plutarch, and other Pagan Historians, who
had the greatest advantages to inform themselves, and yet remained grossly
mistaken in the Jewish Affairs? For the removing this Objection, we shall
endeavor to decipher this Pagan mystery of Iniquity, how these Jewish Records
and Traditions came to be at first corrupted, or misunderstood; as also how the
following Historians came to be so ignorant of Jewish Affairs, and Records.

. 2. As for the original occasion and ground of that corruption, which befell
Jewish Traditions and Stories, as communicated to Pagans, we have spoken
somewhat of it before, (in the close to Pagan History, chap. 6.. 5.) reducing
it to those several causes, namely the decrease of Knowledge, the increase of
Idolatry, the confusion of Languages, etc. 1. Pagan Mythologie a great cause
of those many mistakes about the Jews and their Traditions.
But the most prolifick and seminal root of all, was that Mythologizing humor,
which possessed the ancient Poets, Philosophers, and Historiographers, especially
the Grecians. For the ancient Greek Poets, Orpheus, Linus, Hesiod, etc. who led
the dance to this design of mythologizing on Jewish Traditions, being persons
of great wit, learning, and dexterity in coining Fables, made it their (...),
or whole design, to disfigure all those ancient Traditions, which they
received from the Jewish Church; by clothing them in such an exotic
fantastic garb of Greek fables, as that they soon lost their Oriental Jewish
face and habit, and so grew out of knowledge. Now the methods and means, by
which the Greek Mythologists disguised these Oriental Traditions, were these,
or such like that follow.

1. Grecian Mythologie from mistakes about Hebrew Paronomasies.
1. One great means, by which the Grecian Mythologists corrupted Jewish
Traditions, was their affected or blind mistakes about Hebrew Paronomasies, and
Allusions. Thus Bochart, in his Preface de animal. sacris. I will add (says
he) that we have produced many things from fabulous History, which depend on
mere Allusions to Hebrew words in Scripture. As what is mentioned by Abydenus,
of the Birds which were sent forth in the Flood, and returned with their feet
dirty. That Isis is said to be turned into a Swallow: for Isis does apparently
allude to (...) Sis, which signifies a swallow. And Argus, is said to be turned
into an Heart, from (...) panting, after the manner of an Heart. And Anubis, was
painted (...), because (...) signifies barking etc. So Bochart, Can. lib. 1.
cap. 6. conjectures, that the Chimaera, which Bellerophon conquered, was no
other than the people of Solymi, under their three Generals; 1. Arius, from
(...), a Lion: 2. Trosibis, from (...), the head of a Serpent: 3. Arsalus, from
(...), a young Kid; whence they made the Chimaera to be composed of the form
of a Lion, a Goat, and a Serpent.

2. Mistakes of the Hebrew Idiom.
2. Another spermatick root, by means whereof the Jewish Traditions were
perverted by the Greek Mythlogists, was their mistaking the Hebrew Idioms,
wherein these ancient Traditions were originally conveyed. Genesis 10.8,9.
So Genesis 10.8,9. Nimrod is styled mighty, (...), which also signifies a Giant:
whence those who were employed under Nimrod, to build the Tower of Babel, Genesis
9.20.
were styled by the Poets, Giants, etc. So Genesis 9.20. Noah is styled by Moses
(...), which; according to the Hebrew Idiom, signifies a Husbandman: but the
Mythologists, understanding it in a proper sense, render it (...), the husband
of the Earth: whence they make Saturn, who was Noah, to be the husband of
Rhea, i.e. the Earth.

3. From attributing the stories of some Oriental person to those of their own
Nation.
3. Another way, whereby the Greek Mythologists corrupted Oriental Traditions,
was, by attributing the Actions of some famous Oriental person, to one, or
several of their own Nation. Hence sprang the stories of Saturn from Adam,
Noah, or Abraham: of Jupiter, from Cham: of Mercury, from Canaan: of Bacchus,
from Nimrod etc. as before, in our Pagan (...).

4. From Equivocations of the Hebrew.
4. Again, the Equivocation of the Oriental Languages gave no small occasion
for the corruption of the same. For the Greek Mythologists, when the Hebrew
words or phrases were equivocal, omitted the sense, which was plain and
obvious; and assumed, either from Affectation, or Ignorance, that sense which
was more foreign and fabulous. Thus the robbing of the King of Colchus, is
supposed to have been disguised under the name of the Golden Fleece; because
the Syriack (...), signifies both a Fleece, and a Treasury. So the Bulls and
Dragons, which kept it, are thought to be nothing else but the Walls and
Brassegates: for (...) signifies both a Bull, and a Wall; and (...) Brass, and
a Dragon. And so the fable of the Brass Bull, which foretold Calamities, in
the mountain Atabyrius, is supposed to arise from the Equivocation of the
Phenician or Hebrew (...), which may signify Doctor, Augur, or Bo^ ex aere: as
Stillingfleet Origin. S. book 3. chapter 5.. 5.

5. By altering words and names.
5. The Mythologists corrupted Jewish Traditions, by altering words, and Names,
and putting others in theiir place. Thus for (...) Cham, they put (...), which
is of like import etc. But this may suffice touching the corruption of Jewish
and Scripture Traditions by Mythologists.

. 3. The Motives that inclined Mythologists thus to alter Oriental Traditions.
We come to the original Reasons, and Motives, which induced the Pagans,
especially the Grecians, thus to corrupt and adulterate Scripture, and Jewish
Traditions; so that little of their original Idea, beauty, and simplicity was
seen or understood by their posterity. 1 The Pagans enmity against the Jews.
And we shall begin with that odium, and inveterate enmity, which the Heathens
generally were possessed withal, against the Jews; who were so generally
maligned and hated by all Nations, as that none durst make any honorable
mention of them; much less impose their Principles, Mysteries, and Institutes
on the world, without altering and disfiguring the same, thereby to concele
their origin and parentage. This has been well observed by Serranus, in his
Preface to Plato, in these words. That Plato drew these Symbols from the Jewish
Learning, all learned Antiquity of Christian Doctors has judged: but that he
did industriously abstain from naming the Jews, because their name was odious
amongst the Nations etc. Thus also Sr Walter Raleigh (in his History of the
World, part. 1. book 1. chap. 6.. 7.) affirms, that the wiser of the ancient
Heathens, viz. Pythagoras, Plato etc. had their opinions of God from the Jews;
though they durst not discover them etc. Hence Plato fathers those Traditions,
which were traduced originally from the Jews, on the ancient Barbarians, who
lived near the Gods etc. which must be understood of the Jews, as Clemens
Alexandrinus, with other of the Fathers. Plato also makes frequent mention
(...), of a Syrian and Phenician fable; which was no other than some Jewish
Tradition, as we have elsewhere proved.

The Grecians ascribing to themselves the origin of many Jewish Traditions.
2. Another motive, that inclined the Grecians to disguise and adulterate
Oriental Jewish Traditions, was their proud Affectation or vain humor of
ascribing unto themselves the origin of those Traditions, which they did
really traduce from the Jewish Church. And herein they followed the footsteps
of the Egyptians and Phenicians, who abounded in the same proud humor of
assuming to themselves the honor and praise of those ancient Records and
Traditions, which were indeed conveyed to them from the Jews. Mimice Philosophi
affectant veritatem, and affectando corrumpunt, ut qui gloriam captant. Tertul.
Apol. c. 46.
Thus the Egyptian Priest, in his conference with Solon, boasts, that all
ancient Records and Wisdom belonged to them, as before chap. 6.. 1. Now to make
this fond pretension good, both Grecians, Phenicians, and Egyptians, all concur
in this great design of disfiguring and adulterating Jewish Traditions,
thereby to make them seem to be their own.

. 4. The ignorance of the Pagans, touching Jewish Records and mysteries.
But the great prolifick principle of these Mythologick corruptions, and grand
mistakes about Jewish Traditions, was the native ignorance, joined with a
presumptuous curiosity, and inquisition, which possessed the minds of those
blind Heathens, especially the Grecians, as to Jewish mysteries and affairs. 1.
The Jewish Mysteries and Institutes being so supernatural, and remote, and yet
the Grecian curiosity so presuming, and inquisitive: this gave a main
influence to those many fabulous narrations, and figments thereabouts. So
Cunaeus, de Repub. Hebr. lib. 3. cap. 4. It Is no wonder (says he) that those
Writers, who looked not into sacred Volumes, do report such false things of the
Jews. God hated the profane stock of the Gentiles, and condemned it to darkness;
neither did he suffer them to understand the Affairs of that sacred people,
even in those things which are common. There are extant in Josephus, the words
of Demetrius; who, upon the admiration of Ptolomie, that no Historian or Poet
makes mention of Moses's Law, refers the cause hereof unto the magnitude of the
Affair, which the narrowness of their breasts could not comprehend. To this he
adds, that Theopompus, and Theodectes underwent Divine punishment, for that
they were sollicitously inquisitive into these things: for the former was
deprived of his mind, the latter of his Eyesight. And if there were any
amongst those Heathen writers, who writ any thing of these Jewish Affairs, the
Truth was many ways weakened by them.

2. As for the Civil affairs of the Jews, and God's providential dispensations
toward them, they were likewise so mysteririous and contradictorie to the
rules of human Policy, as that it is no wonder if the blind Heathens could make
no better judgment and narration of them. For what mysteries, and wonders of
Providence were there in God's dispensations toward the Jews! their thriving
in Captivity, their often recoveries from so many Overthrows and Captivities,
their continuing a Nation united and distinct from others, notwithstanding so
many breaches; finally, their Decaies and Increases were so extraordinary, as
that they could not be measured by rules of Policy, or Politic Observations.
Hence was it, that Tacitus, how exact soever in this kind, was here greatly
mistaken in his Account of the Jewish Affairs their original, and Policy: of
which see Jackson, vol. 1. on the Authority of the Scripture. fol. 77. Thus we
have shown, how it came to pass, that Pagan writers were so ignorant of Jewish
Traditions and Affairs, notwithstanding their correspondence with them.

FINIS.
