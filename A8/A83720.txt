Die Lunae, 10 Julii, 1648.
I.
IT is Resolved upon the question by the Commons in Parliament assembled, That
a Printed Paper entitled, A Motive to all Loyal Subjects, to endeavor the
Preservation of his Majesty's Person; wherein Major General Skippon is
slanderously charged with notorious falsities, is a malicious and scandalons
Libel.

II.
Resolved, etc.
That this House does Declare, That it does appear to them, That Captain Rolph,
charged by Mr. Osborn to conspire the taking away of His Majesty's life, is not
Son in Law to Major General Skippon, neither has any relation unto him, as is
falsely charged in the said Paper.

III.
Resolved, etc.
That it does appear to this House, That Mr. Rolph who is Son in Law to Major
General Skippon, has no Command in this Army, nor has or ever had any Command
in the Isle of Wight.

IV.
Resolved, etc.
That the foul Aspersions in the said Libel cast upon Major General Skippon,
tended to blast him in his Reputation, to raise Mutiny and Sedition, and to
stir up the hatred of the People against him, thereby to render him useless in
these distracted Times, he being a person of such eminent worth.

V.
Resolved, etc.
That these Votes be forth with Printed, and set up in the most public places
of the City, to discover to the people the wicked Designs of these Libels, and
to Vindicate Major General Skippon in his Honor from the false Calumnies hereby
cast upon him.
