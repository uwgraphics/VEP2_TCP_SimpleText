THE DECLARATION OF THE Lords, Gentlemen, Citizens, Freeholders, and Yeomen of
this once happy Kingdom of ENGLAND.
SInce it has pleased Almighty God to suffer the Spirit of Division to
continue in this distracted Nation, and to leave us without any settled
foundation of Religion, Liberty, or Property, the Legislative power usurped and
contemned at pleasure, the Armies raised at first for our defense, abused and
misled into unwarrantable Actions, by the Cunning and Ambition of some of their
superior Officers; no face of Government appearing either in any single
Person, or Body of Men in Counsel lawfully constituted, to whom the grievances
of the People may with any probability of success be properly addressed.

We being conscious of our Duty, and sensible of our own, and the Nations
Ruin, if these Distractions continue, or resolve into a more fixed Oppression,
by some corrupt settlement, inconsistant with the Laws, Peace, and interest of
the Nation, have taken Arms, in defense of our selves, and all others, who will
partake with us in the vindication and maintenance of the Freedom of
Parliaments, against all violence whatsoever of the known Laws, Liberty, and
Property of the Good People of this Nation, who at present groan under illegal,
arbitrary, and insupportable Taxes and payments, unknown to our Ancestors.

This being our Duty to God and Man, and our only Design, we cannot despair of
the Blessing of him that gives victory, nor of the cheerful concurrence of all
good men, nor of the undeceived part of the Army, whose Arrears, increase of
future pay, and advancement to higher Commands, we shall by all means procure;
suffering no imposition or force on any man's Conscience: To this we doubt not
but all honest Englishmen will say

AMEN.
