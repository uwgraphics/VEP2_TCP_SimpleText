Die Sabbati 9. April. 1642.
THe Lords and Commons do Declare, That they intend a due and necessary
reformation of the Government and Liturgy of the Church, and to take away
nothing in the one or the other, but what shall be evil, and justly offensive,
or at least unnecessary and burdensome: And for the better effecting thereof,
speedily to have Consultation with Godly and Learned Divines. And because this
will never of it self attain the end sought therein, they will therefore use
their utmost endeavors to establish Learned and Preaching Ministers, with a
good and sufficient maintenance throughout the whole Kingdom, wherein many dark
Corners are miserably destitute of the means of Salvation, and many poor
Ministers want necessary provision.

H. Elsynge Cler. Parl. D. Com.

Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1642.
