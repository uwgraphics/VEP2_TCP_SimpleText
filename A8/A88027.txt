London, Printed for John Field, July 22. 1645.

For the Honorable William Lenthall Esquire, Speaker of the Honorable House
of Commons.
SIR,
I Hope you Received my Letters concerning the Battle; since that time the
Army has layen before Bridgewater, giving them Alarms day and night: There is
in the Town above 30. pieces of Ordnance, whereof one is a Demy-Canon, another
carries 32. pound bullet, strongly Fortified, deep Trenches; yet our Soldiers
have their Bobbins in readiness, and were in hopes last night to have Stormed;
a few days will starve them; good prize within. The Governor and his Lady,
Sir Hugh Windham, his Son, Sir John Digby, Sir Fr. Courtney, Tho. Elliot sore
wounded, etc. A Convoy is gone for the Treasure at Lyme, it will much comfort
the Soldier who deserves it well the Country suffers by the want of it: Goring
is fled to Barstable, the Club-men being more terrible to him then our Army,
giving him Alarms, and disarming his men in Devonshire, as the Club-men of
Somersetshire did: Hopton is fled to Exeter, for France if he can; Sir Io:
Staangewayes, and Sir Francis Dorrington fled into Wales; they see their
condition desperate, and I hope shall do it every day more and more.

July 15. 1645. I am Sir your Servant.
Our Ships in the River at Bristoll, mightily terrifies the Enemy.

I have sent you a List of the Officers taken; you will see 30 Regiments in a
manner broken, all Gorings best Horse were spoiled at this bout.

yesterday Surrendered unto him on bare Quarter, Capt. Smith and 120. more being
in it, 80. Muskets, and 40. T^^e locks. The Army continues Siege before
Bridgewater* and (...) by Storming or Starving, will undoubtedly shortly carry
it; for they are not provided for a Siege, wanting Victuals. Goring is fled to
Barstable in great confusion, not 140. foot with him; the Club men much annoy
him, he has not 1400. Horse for Service left, the rest women and boys.

One Coll. and a French Gentleman of quality, continue in a Commanders hands
still, whose Names are not yet returned to the Provost Marshall.

Sir Francis Courtney lies dangerously wounded at Bridgewater, and other
Officers of quality: Sir John Digby is there also wounded.

Common Soldiers taken 1200. whereof 500. have taken the Covenant and taken up
Arms, being first approved by Mr. Ash, and Mr. Moor, Members of the Parliament.

The enclosures being many, abundance of the Foot escaped and got to the
club-men, who disarmed them, and gave them leave to go to their homes; they
disarmed 300. at one time, Horse and Foot.

Our men were so eager on the pursuit, that they left the prisoners to
themselves to march back to the Army, who escaping, made the number fall short
of that was assured they were of.

There is in Bridgewater about 30. piece of Ordnance, 1000. Soldiers Welsh and
Townsmen, moated about, water deep, having the benefit of the Tide.

FINIS.
