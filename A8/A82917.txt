An Order for the speedy raising of Money for the Advancing of the Scotch Army.
Die Sabbathi. 7. October. 1643.
WHEREAS by the desperate designs and Plots of Papists, Prelates, and other
ill-affected persons, there has been a most cruel, and unnatural War
raised in both the Kingdoms of Ireland, and England, to the almost utter
destruction of the Protestants, and their Religion, in the Kingdom of Ireland,
and to the hazard of the like ruin, both of Religion and Liberty to us and
our Posterity, in this Kingdom of England; The which miserable and deplorable
condition of both these late flourishing Kingdoms, and the apparent and
eminent danger, which upon the ruin of these Islands may ensue to other
Reformed Protestant Churches throughout the world. The Lords and Commons
Assembled in Parliament, having taken into serious consideration, and finding
no nearer, or speedyer assistance in this their sad condition, than by their
Brethren of Scotland; Have thought fit by Commissioners lately sent unto our
said Brethren, to invite them to the speedy help and deliverance of this
bleeding Kingdom, from the cruel and merciless proceedings of the common
enemy, by their coming into this Kingdom with an Army to that purpose, unto
which desire, our said Brethren, as being exceeding sensible of our
aforementioned deplorable condition, have expressed both by their own
Commissioners, which they have presently thereupon sent unto us, as also by
certain intelligence from our own Commissioners that are resident in
Scotland, herein fully assented; being now near unto a readiness to enter
into this Kingdom, with an Army of one and twenty thousand Horse and Foot,
with all things necessary, and fit thereunto, for which a supply of Money is
most necessary, and without which, they are no ways able to move with their
Army.

Therefore, For the better advancing of this necessary Service, the Ministers
of every Parish are required publicly to stir up their Parishioners
thereunto, and the Churchwardens of every Parish to cause an Assembly of the
Parishioners to morrow after Sermon in the afternoon, where it is expected
that all such who are sensible of the dangers imminent, and desirous that this
opportunity which God has put into our hands, may be improved to the best and
most speedy advantage, will subscribe such sums of money, as the necessity of
so great a work does require, and that upon Monday next (being the ninth of
this instant October) by nine of the clock before noone, the Churchwardens
bring into Goldsmiths hall, the said Subscriptions, and that all such as shall
have subscribed, do on the same day, or very speedily after, bring in, or
cause to be brought in, all such sums of money as they have so subscribed,
where there are Treasurers appointed to receive, and to give Acquittances for
the same; with consideration for the time of the forbearance thereof; For which
sums so lent, there shall be the Public Faith of both Kingdoms, of England
and Scotland given, together with such other security, as shall give content to
all true lovers of their Religion and Country.

Let this be read and published, as is desired,

ISAAC PENNINGTON, Mayor.
