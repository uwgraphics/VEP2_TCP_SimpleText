MASTER GLYN HIS Speech in Parliament, on Wednesday the fifth of January, at the
Committee, sitting in Guild Hall, concerning the breaches of the Privileges of
Parliament, by breaking open the Chambers, Truncks, and Studies, of the six
Gentlemen, upon their accusation of high Treason by his Majesty. 1641.
Master Speaker,
We sit now upon that Grand business of the breaches of the Rights and
Privileges of Parliament, which are so many, and great, so carefully
preserved, and defended, and having in former times severely punished the
infringers thereof, that I had thought and conceived, that no Subject of what
degree or dignity soever, would either in their own persons, or by
mis-informing his Majesty, concerning the same, have presumed to have
entrenched in the least measure upon the free Liberty, Rights, and very being
of Parliaments, tending to the breach thereof. But Master Speaker, I perceive
the perverseness, and obstinate frowardness of diverse persons in this
Kingdom, in places of power, and authority, as well of the Clergy, as Layitie,
are grown to that height, that they dare not only presume to instigate, and
provoke His sacred Majesty, by their subtle and politic mis-informations,
but themselves in their own persons dare attempt, if His Majesty in His royal
wisdom, tender care, and affection toward his loyal subjects do refuse to
do the same, to endeavor as much as in them lies, by their malignant carriages
in Petitions, and Protestations to resist the lawful power, and undoubted
Jurisdiction, both of the King, and his high Court of Parliament.

Master Speaker, These men notwithstanding, they apparently perceive that their
wicked Practices, and malicious Designs, cannot take effect according to their
expectation, but are rejected, and detected, as well by his Sacred Majesty, as
his Lords and his whole Council, dare aventure, to endeavor by casting
aspersions, and spreading abroad evil reports, not only of the Members, but
of the Proceedings of the House of Commons against them, and others of their
Adherents and Favorites, in their wicked and desperate actions and designs
against their lawful Sovereign, and his Liege people.

I conceive Master Speaker, did these persons, but remember the many
presidents, yet extant of the just and deserved punishments inflicted by former
Parliaments upon such miscreants, as witness the Archbishop of York, the Duke
of Suffolk, Chief Justice Belknap, and the rest of that conspiracy in the
reign of K. Richard the 2. they would have prejudicated to themselves, the
like danger would follow upon them for their evil actions; Nay Master Speaker,
did these men but consider with themselves, the just Judgments of God, that
have immediately lighted upon the necks of such, as have been the Troublers of
Kingdoms and Commonwealths, whereof they have been members, as well recorded
in sacred writ, as of late times in this Kingdom, yet still in fresh memory,
they would have laid their hands upon their mouths and hearts, when they went
about to speak or do any thing tending to the dishonor of Almighty God, in
innovating of his true Religion, corrupting the sincere Doctrine and Discipline
of Christ and his Apostles, as also any thing tending to the dishonor and
perpetual destruction of his Royal Majesty, and however, otherwise they may
pretend the fundamental laws and liberties of this Kingdom, the rights and
privileges of Parliaments, and the very being thereof: but surely Master
Speaker, they are altogether benumbed and stupefied, their consciences dead and
seered, their lives and conversation altogether devoted to the works of
darkness, and impurity; their desires altogether Sensual, Carnal, and
Divelish, forgetting God, kicking and spurring with maliciousness against all
piety and godliness, or else, they would never have adventured to practice
such things, as it is too too manifest they have done.

Master Speaker, I intend to be brief in that, which I am to speak
concerning the breaches of the privileges of Parliament

First, to inform his Majesty of any proceedings in the House of Commons upon
any business whatsoever, before they have concluded, finished and made ready
the same, to present to his Majesty, for his Royal assent, thereupon is a
breach of the privileges of Parliament.

Secondly, to mis-informe his Majesty contrary to the proceedings in
Parliament, thereby to incense and provoke him against the same, is a breach of
privilege of Parliament.

Thirdly, to cause or procure any information or accusation to be brought, or
preferred without the knowledge or consent of the Parliament into the House,
against any of the members thereof, is a breach of privilege of Parliament.

Fourthly, to apprehend any such accused, to imprison their persons, to cease
upon their goods or estates, to prosecute and proceed against them to their
trial and judgment, to condemn or execute them upon such accusation, without
the consent or advice of the Parliament, is a breach of the privileges thereof.

Fifthly, to endeavor to cast an evil opinion of such members accused into the
hearts of His Majesty's loyal Subjects, whereby they dis-affecting them, may
be ready and willing to put in execution any command or warrant for their
apprehension, and imprisonment, is a breach of the privileges of Parliament.

Sixthly, to come in open Parliament, for any Officer, or Sergeant, to demand
and arrest any such member accused, be it of high Treason, or any other crime
whatsoever, without the knowledge of the whole House, is a breach of the
privileges of Parliament.

Seventhly, to come to a Parliament sitting in free consultation, assisted and
guarded with Armed men, and with them besetting the House, to demand as it were
( vi and (armis) such members accused, is a breach of the privileges of
Parliament.

Lastly, to procure to be set forth, or to set forth under His Majesty's name,
any Proclamation, or Declaration, prohibiting the repair of such persons
accused to the Parliament, as members thereof, and to apprehend them in what
place soever they shall be found, without the advice and consent of the whole
State assembled, and sitting in free Parliament, is a manifest breach of the
privileges thereof. And this Master Speaker is all that I have to say,
concerning this days business, humbly leaving the same to the further
consideration of this Honorable Assembly.

FINIS.
