A DECLARATION AGAINST A CROSS PETITION: WHEREIN Some secret lets of the
intended reformation are discovered. The danger of Division prevented. And the
unity of this Island in religion urged.

BY THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.

First, Printed at Edinburgh, and now reprinted at London for I. B. in
Cornhill. 1642.

THe Word of GOD, the example of the People of GOD, and of the Kirk of Christ,
since the beginning, and our own late, but very notable and never to be
forgotten experience, may abundantly teach us, that the motions, resolutions
and endeavors of the Godly, for the advancement of the Kingdom of the Son of
GOD, by establishing or propagating the Reformation of Religion, must meet with
a world of opposition and hindrances, which might make their hearts to faint,
and their hands to fail, if upon the same grounds and documents they were not
taught to acquit themselves, in doing the duty required of them by the
necessity of their callings, and for the success to depend upon the
unsearchable wisdom, and invincible power of GOD, which are made perfect in
the simplicity and weakness of his servants: The zeal of the Lord of hosts
will perform it.

There has ever been in the Kirk of Christ, and shall be to the end, a
generation which makes more account of the World, then of the Faith of Christ,
does conceive that differences about Religion are but the contentions of
Kirk-men, that therefore there is no necessity of the Reformation of Religion,
and that to know nothing of this kind, is the surest Faith, and seeks in
their service to Kings and Princes civilly to supererogate at their hands,
beyond the deservings others, and above the expressed desires and commands of
Princes themselves, that the rewards of their singular zeal may be the
greater, and therefore have proven, and daily do prove the most pernicious and
dangerous enemies of the true Religion: against this generation, which says,
Let us deal wisely with them, we have this comfort and advantage, and we know
amongst all the Enemies of the Truth, they least of all think that they do
God service.

We who are entrusted for the time, to be the Commissioners of the late
General Assembly, sitting at Edinburgh for the Affairs of the Kirk committed
to our care and diligence, specially for preserving of our own Reformation,
and peace against all sorts of Enemies, and according to the interest of this
Kirk for unity in Religion and Uniformity of Government with the Kirk of
England, which was no new motion of ours, but a proposition made by the
Commissioners of the Treaty, which then received from the Kings Majesty and
Parliament of England, such an Answer as has been the ground of many
Consultations, Declarations, and public Letters since, and of a renewed
supplication at this time to the Kings Majesty, and of a Declaration to the
Parliament of England for the same effect. While we are thus exercised, we are
desired by some Noblemen, Barons, and Burgesses, occasionally met at Edinburgh,
to send some of our number to join with them in a Petition, representing to
the Right Honorable the Lords and other Commissioners of Parliament for the
conservation of peace, their humble thoughts and fears that the printing of
His Majesty's Letter of the date, December 5. by Warrant and Command of the
Right Honorable the Lords of His Majesty's Privy Council, and the not
printing of the Declaration of both Houses of Parliament, unto which the
printed Letter was an Answer, might be taken by the Kingdom of England, as an
approbation of the whole matter, and all the particulars which it did express,
and thereby to animate and provoke this Nation against them as Rebels and
Traitors We finding that the Petition did homologate both in the end and
means with our Commission, and the matter of our present deliberations did
willingly satisfy the desire of the Petitioners, and therefore from our tender
and dutiful respect to His Majesty's Honor, for preventing and removing of
all occasion of jealousies and suspicions betwixt the two Kingdoms, for
preservation both of our own peace at home, and our common peace with England,
and for promoving the so much desired Unity of Religion, a mean of all other
most conducing to the conservation of both, did with them (conform to the
order observed in such cases since the beginning of our late Reformation)
humbly supplicate, that the meaning of the publication of his Majesty's Letter
might be cleared, and that the Declaration of both Houses of Parliament to
their Brethren of Scotland might be printed and published, etc.

But behold, after a few days a contrary Petition is presented to the Lords of
His Majesty's Privy Council, by some private Noblemen, Barons, and Gentlemen,
which coming to our hands, we found after due examination to be nothing else
but a secret plot and subtle under-mining of all the present designs of this
Kirk and Kingdom, for Unity of Religion, and of all the work of God in this
Land: And therefore we made upon it the Observations and Animadversions
following.

either have petitioned with them, or have advised them to desist: which
although it may seem to be but an erro^ in the manner of their doing, yet does
it imply contempt, usurpation and division; and being winked at may be the
cause of much disturbance and confusion in these times, especially they
professing that they desire to clear themselves and their intentions, not
only to the Lords of Council, but to the Kings Majesty, to the Kingdom of
England, and to all the World, which is nothing else but under the color of a
Petition to make a public Declaration, contrary to the proceedings, not only
of the General Assembly and their Commissioners, but also to the desires and
diligence of the Commissioners of the Treaty of the Honorable Lords of
Council, and of the Conservators of Peace, who have all concurred, and do
still concur in their joint desires of Unity of Religion in His Majesty's
Dominions, resolving to press this Unity to the uttermost of their endeavors
as a necessary preservative of our own Reformation and Peace, which without it
cannot long subsist; and much crossing that clause of our Covenant wherein we
swear, that we shall not cast in any let or impediment that may stay or hinder
any such resolution, as by common consent shall be found to conduce for so good
ends.

Although the Petitioners profess with us that they desire the Union of this
Island in Religion and Kirk-Government, yet their Petition does too plainly and
palpably tend to the contrary, as is apparent by this threefold consideration:
1. For remedy of the divisions and distractions in England, the Petition
desires only the suppression of insolent Papists, malignant schismatickes,
and disloyal Brownists and Separatists, the special, if not sole promovers
and fomenters of these unhappy mis-understandings: and thus does pass by the
Prelates, and balketh the Bishops, who have bin the most restless sticklers in
this business, and the prime authors of all these tragedies since the
beginning, and thereby would take us off our right and straight course of
pressing uniformitie in Kirk-government, in the Treaty, in our Declarations,
and in the General Assembly: The Apologists for the petition would have
reduced the Prelates either to Papists, or to Sectaries; but the Authors of the
Petition intended better service, by sending the Petition to England, without
trenching upon the Lordly Prelacy, or touching the Prelates at all; which from
strangers is an high provocation against the Kingdom and Parliament of
England, and no small prejudice against the proceedings of this Kirk and
Kingdom for Reformation. 2 This Petition does indirectly cast foul aspertions
upon those who are most zealous for the reformation in England, and does very
much symbolize with the language of the Popish and Prelaticall party in
England; calling the Parliament, and all that seek after Reformation,
Brownists, Separatists, Authors of tumultuary conventions, etc. 3 It hinteth at
our zeal and forwardness in the matter of the Reformation of the Kirk of
England: which may appear thus; The Petitioners declare, That since the duty
of charity does oblige all Christians to pray and profess their desires, that
all others were of the same Religion with themselves, etc. Therefore they
represent their wishes for unity of Religion and Kirk-government, as an
expression and testimony of their affection to the good of their brethren in
England: Declaring further, That they desire this work to be prosecuted without
presuming or usurping to prescribe ^^wes and rules of Reformation to their
Neighbors. And again they repeat, that by their wishes and desires they intend
^o ways to pass their bounds, in prescribing or setting down rules and
limits to his Majesty and Houses of Parliament their wisdom and authority,
in the way of prosecution hereof. And why do they so plentiful purge, and
carefully clear themselves concerning this particular, if their intention were
not to leave some aspersion upon this Kirk and State, as if we were passing our
bounds, by presuming to prescribe rules and limits to His Majesty and Houses of
Parliament? For further evidence whereof, it is to be remembered, that in the
first part of their Petition they plainly profess, that they are clearing
themselves and their intentions, lest they should be thought to be involved
with us in the same desires, judgments, and opinions: So that all which they
say by way of clearing of themselves and their intentions, arises from this
ground, that they will not be thought involved with us in our desires,
Judgments, and opinions, and so condemn us in these particulars in which
chiefly they justify themselves: neither can we knit together their words, or
interpret their apology to another meaning. Now what is this else but to
overturne the very foundation of all our endeavors for this work of
Reformation, which was the Article of the Treaty for union in Religion, and
uniformity in Kirk government? Not as a matter nakedly desired and wished for,
but as a principal demand, and necessary mean, without which neither truth nor
peace could be secured unto us. The importance and necessity whereof has bin
since that time so deeply laid to heart by this Kirk and Kingdom, that as the
General Assembly, and we for our part representing the same, so the Lords of
Counsel, and the Commissioners of Parliament for conservation of the peace,
concurring with us, have been, and are most serious and solicitous in the
importunate and earnest pressing of this union in Religion and Kirk government,
resolving to use our uttermost endeavors in the prosecuting and effectuating
of such a blessed and necessary work, as being dearer to us then all our lives
and Fortunes: neither did the General Assembly spare to represent their humble
advice concerning the way of prosecuting that work to the Houses of Parliament,
and to others seeking after Reformation in England.



might do no act which might give His Majesty occasion to repent him of that
trust for aid and assistance, which He was pleased to declare in his Letter
December 5. that he reposeth in us His Subjects of this His ancient and native
Kingdom; whereby the Petitioners do in^^mate their desires, that the Lords of
Council might not declare that for which we did supplicate, but to declare by
their not printing the Declaration of the Parliament, that their Lordships
publication of His Majesty's Letter did import their approbation of the
contents thereof, and so acknowledge their willingness to take Arms against
the Parliament of England, upon the grounds contained in that Letter, when His
Majesty shall require them so to do. And for their own part they declare, that
they think themselves obliged in every cause which may concern His Majesty's
honor to concur with their friends and followers in quiet manner, or in
Arms, as they shall be required of His Majesty, his Council, or any having
his authority. Which if understood and applied aright, no loyal Subject can
deny, but it is meant and expressed in their Petition, as in opposition to our
Petition* So in contemplation of the Differences betwixt His Majesty, and the
Parliament of England, unto which their words relate. For they profess to
represent such particulars as they are confident will much conduce to the
removing of all the mistakes betwixt His Majesty, and the Parliament: of which
particulars, that is the first, That according to His Majesty's trust expressed
in His Letter December 5. the Subjects of this Kingdom declare themselves
willing and ready to take Arms in every cause which may concern His Majesty's
honor, being required by His Majesty, or any having His Authority. And is
not this to make void the Treaty, ratified by the public Faith of this
Kingdom, and Act of Parliament, discharging all taking up of Arms against the
Kingdom or Subjects of England, upon any pretense whatsoever, without consent
of Parliament, declaring the breach of Peace; and that after three months
warning? Which treaty the Estates of Parliament did swear to observe
inviolably, in the same very oath in which they did swear allegiance to the
Kings Majesty; thereby declaring, that the observation of the conclusions of
the treaty may well consist with our duty and allegiance to our Sovereign,
whereas the Petition does indirectly put some aspersion of Laesmajestie upon
the Parliament for confirming and swearing to observe the Articles of the
Treaty, which in the opinion of the Petitioners are consistent with our oath
of allegiance. If they say that their Petition did only insinuate that we may
not take Arms to assist the Parliament against the King, they put upon it a
sense which it cannot be ar, both because they knew that the supplication of
the Noblemen, Barons, and others assisted by us, did not directly nor
indirectly contain any such thing, And because His Majesty's trust expressed in
that Letter (which they desire His Majesty may not have occasion from us to
repent) is not only a negative trust, that we will not take arms against him,
but a positive trust and confidence, that we will be ready to assist him. And
finally, because the clause of the Supplication of the General Assembly which
they mention as containing our obligation to our Sovereign, and that in
reference to the present distractions in England, is positive, and not negative.

are so ready at this time to make their own conclusions out of the Covenant,
which was never intended by it, nor thought upon at the first or last time at
the swearing and subscribing thereof, how it comes to pass that they never
took the Covenant in their mouth, but in this one Article? Are they not bound
by their Covenant, and the same clause of the supplication, cited by them, to
their mutual concurrence and assistance for the cause of Religion? and to
stand, with their means and lives, to the defense thereof, in the doctrine and
discipline of the Kirk of Scotland? and to live godly, soberly, and righteously
in this present world? True Conscience of duty and sincerity in keeping the
Covenant, will make the obedience universal. Secondly, seeing the Petitioners
would only have unity in Religion, and uniformitie in Kirk-Government
advanced by Christian wishes and fair means, and yet insinuates their offer
by arms to decide the municipall debates of England, anent Civil matters,
while the Civil and Ecclesiastic Judicatories, and the rest of this Kirk and
Kingdom are desiring an Assembly, and a Parliament, to consider their interest
and duty, and to contribute their best endeavors (in what is above the power
of their Commissioners) to further this unity of Religion, and remove these
distractions in England, we ask, whether they presume that they alone keep
the Covenant, and would render unto Christ which is Christ's, and unto Caesar
which is Caesar's, and that all others are Covenant-breakers? Thirdly, do they
not know that the Covenant was subscribed in the years, 1581. and 1591. before
King James was King of England? and that in the particular Heads and Articles,
it is qualified by express limitations and restrictions to this Kirk and
Kingdom, to the Religion, Laws and Liberties of Scotland? therefore can no
more be extended to municipall debates, and to the Laws and Liberties of
England, unto which we are strangers, then the Kingdom of England can judge of
our Laws, and determine our differences, the two Kingdoms being still
independent, and not subordinate one to another, but parallel, which is more
at large expressed in the beginning of the treaty of Peace: Nor is the sending
of our Forces into Ireland a necessary duty of our Covenant, but a voluntary
testimony of our high respects to our King, and of our brotherly kindness to
the Kingdom of England, as was expressed by the Estates in the last
Parliament. Fourthly, do not the Petitioners observe the limitations expressly
contained in the words cited by themselves, according to the Laws of this
Kingdom, and duty of good Subjects? which some of them may remember was
interpreted in the Assembly, as if it had been said within this Kingdom; nor
was there ever any law of this Kingdom of further extent: A law and Treaty
there is, we know, sorbidding it. Fifty, may they not learn from the printed
Letter, that the Kings Majesty expresses not his confidence of assistance
from Scotland, upon any ground or article of the Covenant, which his Majesty
knows to be so obligatory among us, but from the obedience, duty and
affection of His Subjects of Scotland, without any mention of our Covenant? But
such is the supererogation of some of the Petitioners above what His Majesty
requires, that they will put a tie of the Covenant upon us, where GOD and the
King has lest us free. Thus have we related the interpretation of the Covenant
made by the Assembly, and vindicate that clause of the Covenant, which is so
far perverted by this Petition.

The Petitioners hearing that their Petition had given offense to the
Commissioners of the Assembly, and that we were about the examination and
censuring thereof, did direct four of their number with another Petition to
give satisfaction to the exceptions that might be taken against them, as is
contained in their Remonstrance which they exhibit for that end: But when in a
calm and quiet conference, all the particular reasons above-written, were
represented unto them, and all means used to move them to part from their
Petition, they could not be induced, neither in the name of others that had
sent them, nor for themselves, to acknowledge the smallest error either in the
matter of their Petition, or in the manner of their petitioning; only they made
offor to join with us the Commissioners of the Assembly in a new Petition for
Unity of Religion, and gave such glosses and interpretations upon the clauses
of their Petition, which were most excepted against, as could neither consist
with the words nor scope of the contrivers and authors. And therefore being
desired and carnestly dealt with, they not only refused to declare under their
hands that no other thing was meant in the Petition, then they had by word
expressed, but also did shun to allow or permit us, the Commissioners of the
Assembly, to declare so much in their names, as was contained in their own
verbal expressions, intending that the Petition should go through this and the
neighboring Kingdoms for the ends for which it was devised, and especially
into England, for frustrating all that has been done, or is now in doing by
this Kirk and Kingdom, out of their pious intention, and by their public
endeavors for Unity of Religion, and the Peace of the two Kingdoms: And in
the mean time that nothing should be extant from them or their confessions and
interpretations in the contrary.

In this case we Judge it necessary, and find it incumbent to us to emit this
Declaration, for vindicating our present and bypast proceedings: For our
silence and connivence were a breach of our duty to GOD, a neglect of the
charge and trust committed unto us by the General Assembly, an occasion as
well of divisions at home, as of jealousies and mis-understandings betwixt the
Kingdoms, a confirmation of Petitioners in their error, and an indirect
approbation of their Petition; as likewise a cause of stumbling and doubting to
others who shall read or hear of such a Petition, especially to those, who
through want of discerning, are not able to prove things that are different,
might be easily deceived by their pretexts and sophistications. We are not
ignorant that this Petition does very much reflect upon the Parliament, Privy
Council, and the Conservators of Peace; but this we leave to the wise
consideration of these civil Judicatories, as they shall find themselves
concerned: We have contained our selves within our proper Sphere, not daring
to neglect our own duty, while we forbear to meddle with that which pertaines
to others.

The Petitioners are not all of one kind and disposition of heart, but are
unequally voked against the Work of God. Some of them are known, and some of
them have been conceived to be Maglignants and Incendiares from the beginning:
but God forbid that they should now by opposing untie in Religion and Peace,
prove enemies to all Religion and Righteousness; for then will it be both
thought and spoken, that all this time past they have been lying in wait for
the season, when their malignancie might appear; and it will be observed, that
they who were of late at distance amongst themselves, are now at agreement; and
that like Samsons soxe, they turn tail to taille with firebrarnds in the
midst, to burn up the husbandry of GOD, when now the fields are white for the
harvest. It cannot be the cause of God which is not either secretly or openly
opposed by men of perverse minds; nor can blinded minds and hardened hearts till
God touch them by his power, choose but secretly or openly oppose the truth and
cause of God. And therefore it is very necessary that such men take heed unto
themselves, least by their fullness of all subtletie and mischief, and their
not ceasing to pervert the right ways of the Lord, they be found to be
fighting against God which will prove bitterness in the end: Others there be
who have joined in this Petition (to judge charitably) not from opposition to
the unity of Religion, they having done and suffered so much, and hazarded all
for the Reformation of Religion at home, but partly out of unwillingnesse to
refuse or displease their friends to whom they are obliged by natural or other
particular bands and partly by reason of the specious pretenses in the
Petition, not considering the bad intentions of the contrivers, or the
dangerous importance and consequence of the Petition it self: Let such men, to
whom the Commissioners of the Assembly wish all true happiness, seriously
think as well upon the condition of the work, and the quallitie of the
company with whom they join, as upon their own intentions, least they wrong
both themselves, and the cause of God, contrary to their desires, and more then
they are aware of; and let them remember how dangerous it is to walk in the
counsel of the ungodly, for their souls to come into their secret, and their
glory to be joynd with that Assembly If counsel be like the principal agent,
consent is like the instrument; and to be instruments of, or accessorie unto
the hindrance of the intended, and so much desired unity of Religion, which
makes so fair a way for the Kingdom of Christ through the earth, how great a
sin is it? and how great a sorrow shall it be?

All this we have thought good to express concerning that divisive Petition,
and those who are joined together in it, being cast in our way as a stumbling
block and rock of offense, for hinderance of the work of God, both at home and
abroad. And as We exhort and warn all the people of God in this Land to
observe them who cause divisions and offenses, and to avoid them; So we hope
assuredly, that no such courses, nor counsels shall prosper, as do tend
directly or indirectly, to the stopping of the course of the Gospel, or to the
suppression of Religion and Reformation, and that God Almighty shall against al
impediments carry forward this his blessed and glorious Work, to the glory of
his great Name, to the advancement of the Kingdom of his Son Jesus Christ, to
the destruction of Antichrist, to the firm Peace and happy Union of all His
Majesty's Dominions in Religion, and to His Majesty's Honor and Happiness:
Whom GOD preserve to reign long and prosperously over us.

FINIS.
At Edinburgh the 18, day of January, 1643.
THe Commissioners appointed by the Kings Majesty, and his Parliament of
Scotland, for conserving the Articles of the Treaty, Do find that the
Petition given in to His Majesty's Privy Council by some Noblemen and
Gentlemen upon the tenth of this Month, does tend to the hindrance of their
proceedings and endeavors, in this publik Work committed to them by the Kings
Majesty, and Parliament: And that it is prejudicial to the authority of this
Commission, the same being in opposition of what was that day recommended by
the said Commissioners to the Council. And ordain this Act to be published
for stopping all farther progress of that or other Petitions of that kind, And
that it be Printed with the Declaration of the Commissioners of the General
Assembly made here anent.
