A DECLARATION Of the last DEMANDS, Propounded by his Excellency Sir Thomas
Fairfax, and the Council of his Army to both Houses of Parliament, for
vindication of the Parliament, for Justice, and for the Peace of the Kingdom:
with the Answer of the House of Peers, and their approbation and Order to
return thanks to the Gen: and the Army.
THE Houses being restored to a Condition of present safety, honor and
freedom: Two things seem clearly remaining to be done (which our own and most
men's expectations are most set upon) viz.

First, to vindicate the honor, freedom and safety of Parliament from the
like affronts and violences in future, and the Army and Kingdom from danger of
the like disturbances (whilst things shall be in a debate or treaty for a
settlement) and then to proceed unto a speedy settlement of the peace of the
Kingdom.

The latter of these is first in our intentions (being nearest to the ultimate
end.) And we shall earnestly desire that in order thereunto, The proposalls of
the Army (whereof the heads are published) may be speedily considered and
brought to a resolution. But considering that the debates of them may take up
some time ere they be agreed on all hands, and the framing of them inty Bills,
and perfecting of the same will require much more. Something must first be done
in the former, for a present security to the Parliament from like affronts or
violence, and to the Army and Kingdom from the like disturbances to the peace
thereof by any further advantage which the time like to be spent in the settling
of peace, may afford to our watchful, restless, and (we doubt) implacable
enemies.

First, therefore to these ends (unless it should be thought fit to secure the
Parliament by keeping the whole body of the Army, or so great a part thereof to
remain continually in and about London, as might be sure to verpower any
future tumults, or force that may arise out of the City, which neither the
welfare of the City and ease of the parts adjacent, nor the safety of the
Kingdom in respect of the present posture of affairs will admit.)

It is absolutely necessary that there be speedy and exemplary Justice done
upon (at least) the chief authors or abettors of the said treasonable
engagement, and of the said force done to the Parliament, and upon the chief
actors, in maintenance and prosecution thereof (whereby men may be deterred
from the like in future.)

And this is also as necessary to the security of the Army, and peace of the
Kingdom, since it is apparent by all that has been said, and by infinite
other evidences (too many to recount.) That both the said engagement, and the
force done to the Parliament, and the power of the City M^litia thereby gained,
and the succeeding votes and orders of the pretended Houses (but indeed of that
faction that are our professed enemies) in maintenance and prosecution thereof,
and the Forces thereupon leav^ed put and (...) the Command of Major Genesis
Massey, and others (...) adversaries) were all designed and directed to the
ruin and destruction of this Army, and the raising of a new War against us
in this Kingdom. A dissaving had such experience of their restless malice and
cruel intentions toward us, (notwithstanding our tenderness and lenity
toward them) and of their treacherous dealing (so soon as they thought they
had the advantage) no withstanding all their semblances of compliance to a
composure. What reason is there to expect, but that if by our patience and
delays, they apprehend in future the like or other advantage, they will break
out again into the like or worse attempts of violence and War, if all escape
with impunity for these.

But as to this point of security by exemplary justice in an ordinary way, we
see our hopes almost frustrated, whilst, (though our desires and resolutions
to that purpose, expressed in our late declaration of our advance toward London,
were then seconded with the declared approbation and concurrent resolutions of
the Speakers and Members of both Houses, that were driven away to the Army, and
with their engagement to live and dye with us therein. And though in pursuance
thereof, the Right Honorable House of Peers, have since their restitution,
begun and proceeded to declare null and void, all that was done in the name of
both Houses, while they lay under the power of that tumultuous violence; and to
give their more authentic approbation to our said Declaration, made in behalf
of the said Speakers and Members, while they were with the Army: And i^ behalf
of the honor and freedom of the Parliament, and to give their, like
approbation to the Concurrent Declaration and Engagement of the said Speakers
and Members, made to us while they were with us, yet) the House of Commons has
not only not concurred with the Lords in any of those things, but rather seem
to have cast them aside. And upon the Question concerning those very Votes of
the said 26. of July. To which the Houses were by the said violence enforced
[whether they should be declared Null and void] it was carried in the Negative,
That the question should not be put; by the consequences whereof (which are
many ways very sad, this poor Kingdom, and more then we can recompt) and by
all subsequent proceedings in that House, in relation to the whole business,
we clearly find, That the Members of that House, who (after the violence done
to it, and during the absence of the Speaker, and the other Members thereby
driven away) proceeding in the name of that House as aforesaid procured the
pretended Powers, and did make the pretended Votes, Orders, and Ordinances
before mentioned; and many of them were the Factors thereupon for the leavying
of war, in prosecution and maintenance of the aforesaid treasonable engagement,
and force done to the Parliament, and for the opposing resisting and destroying
of this the Parliaments Army in its advance to London, for the restitution of
the Parliament to its Honor and freedom, being conscious of their own guilt
and danger thereby; yet presuming on their interest in the House, and the
patience and lenity of this Army do continue and intrude themselves, and to
sit and Vote there, and by their present interest in the House do use their
utmost endeavors, and very much prevail to obstruct and avoid the bringing of
any to Justice, who have acted under their pretended Authority, (knowing it to
be their own case and concernment in point of impunity, as well as conducency
to their faction and interest) And for that cause they labor (As for life) to
uphold the things past and done, and the Authorities given by them and their
Faction (in their and the Apprentices pretended Parliament) yea, even those
very Votes and Authorities, wrested from the Parliament, by that palpable force
of July the 26. to be good and valid until they be repealed (as if past in a
free and legal Parliament;) in which Point, and all Questions touching upon
it, we find they presume upon, and are strengthened by the conccurrence of
diverse other Members, who having (perhaps with harmless intentions continued
to sit with them during the Speakers absence, as aforesaid (though they
consented not to any of their mischievous Votes and Orders, or treasonable
proceedings ofore mentioned) may yet fear themselves to be involved in the
same case and danger by having sat with them; And thus by the concurrence of
these two Parties in the House (as to that point) and the interest which both
those Parties have with others in the House (especially upon a matter of saving
one another) and by the partial respects of some others in the House, for the
saving of their friends out of the House, who have acted under the authority,
and for the evil ends aforementioned, we find an absolute obstruction to the
bringing to Justice, or questioning of any) who have acted in the late leavying
of War against us, and against the vindication of the Parliaments freedom, or
in the said treasonable engagements, yea, or in abetment of the tumultuous
violence upon the Parliament it self; neither can we find or hear of any one
Person hitherto brought to Justice, or Question for any of these things, but
all seem to be either justified, or at least protected from Justice by the
power and prevalence of those Members in Parliament, who are (many of them, as
we can make appear (equally guilty of, and (others) in some kind obnoxious
for the same things; and thus not only our just expectations of vindication to
the Parliament, and security to our selves and the Kingdom from the like
treasonable and turbulent practices in future, (by exemplary Justice for what
has been so done) are frustrated, but even the safety and immunity of the
Speakers, and those faithful Members of both Houses that were driven away by
the violence aforesaid, and the immunity of the Army in advancing to London, to
bring them back, and restore the Parliament to its Honor and Freedom (which
has been acknowledged, with public Thankesgiving to God for it, as aforesaid)
is subjected and exposed to question (where in theirs and ours, and the
Kingdoms enemies obtrude themselves to be the Judges) for if those pretended
Votes, Orders, and Ordinances, whereby War was leavied against them and us were
then good and valid (though they should now be repealed, yet) we, with the
Speakers, and those Members aforesaid, in opposing of them while they were of
force, must needs remain transgressors still, and yet God and we are thanked
for it [what a mock is this to God, and man.]

But to return to the more serious consideration of our case, in relation to
the security of the Parliament, Kingdom, and our selves, against the like
turbulent and treasonable practices in future, since by the means aforesaid no
security by exemplary Justice can at present be had, (to deter any from the
like) we wish all men to consider what streights we are in this case put upon;
(That which is the main work of the Kingdom, and which we most earnestly
thirst for, and attend upon, viz. the settling of a peace, and consideration of
our Proposalls in order thereunto will ask ^^me to bring it to an issue; and
that done, the releiving or remedying of (...) pressing grievances of the
Kingdom, will take up and require the sitting of the Parliamen for some
further time [though upon the settling of a Peace a period be set for the
certain ending of it, now for the body of this this Army or so great a part of
it [as may serve to over-poure any future tumults, or force that may arise in
or from the City] to coninue hereabouts so long as the Condition of the
Country hereabouts and the necessities of the City [in point of provision]
cannot well bear it, and [we doubt] foreign Forces [that are already upon
the wing] and turbulent spirits, that in several parts of the Kingdom, are
beginning insurrections, [if we continue fixed here, will have such
opportunity, and take such encouragement therefrom, as that they may ere long
necessarily call us off; should we now or hereafter, while the Parliament sits
draw off the Army from about the City, without exemplary Justice upon some,
would not the same or more dangerous tumults and violences probably return upon
the Parl. and the like or worse practices of raising a new war, be revived,
with more advantage to our enemies, more danger to us and the kingdom, and
less hopes of appeasing it, so easily and happily as the former) while the
same violent and factious spirits, both in the Parliament and elsewhere; shall
continue in the same power and oportunities as formerly, and both they, and all
others, shall have before their eyes the encouragement of that impunity and
protection (yea rather that justification) which they have hitherto found from
within the Parliament it self, in the past practices aforementioned, though as
grossly treasonable as any they can hereafter run into, should we or any others
(for the obtaining exemplary Justice upon some) proceed to impeach any, for
their past treasonable practices, what hopes of justice, or of a timely
dispatch therein can we have, while such a prevailing party of new interested
and concerned in the same things; shall in the House of Commons continue to be
Judges thereof, or at least be ready to avow and justify the offenders
therein, as having acted under their pretended Authority. In this straight
therefore (though we have ever been, and shall be most tender of all just
Privileges of Parliament, finding the root of these and other difficulties to
the Parliament, yet) Kingdom, and our selves, to lie in this, viz. (that that
those Members of the House of Commons, who, during the forceed absence of the
Speakers of both Houses, continuing to sit and act as a Parliament, did procure
and consent to the pretended Votes, Orders and Ordinances aforementioned, for
levying of War, and that, as is before demonstrated, in direct prosecution or
maintenance of she aforesaid treasonable engagement, and the violence done to
the Parliament, and for the opposing, resisting, and destroying of this the
Parliaments Army in its advance toward London, only to restore the Speakers
and Members of both Houses that were driven away, and the Houses themselves to
their honor and freedom, and who are thereby, and by their late owning, and
avowing of the same, and many of them, as we can prove, by acting personally in
the said treasonable practices, become parties to the same, do yet take the
boldness to sit and vote in Parliament, especially in the House of Commons) we
say, finding the maine root of our difficulties and dangers lying in this.

First, we appeal to all men, whether it be just or tolerable, that any
privilede of Parliament should (contrary to the Law of Nature) make a man judge
in his own case and concernment.

And next we wish those men themselves to consider, if we had come to an
engagement with the forces raised by virtue of their pretended Votes and
Ordinances, and that thousands had been slain, and we had made our way by the
Sword, whether they would then have expected to have sat as Judges upon us
therein; and we are sure it is no thanks to them that it has been otherwise;
and had we found those Members in Arms against us, and subdued and taken them,
whether had they not then been in the condition of prisoners of War; and if
so, then having put Arms into the hands of others, against us, and still
maintaining it, whether can they in strict Justice challenge any better
condition from us. But, that contrariwise, we should suffer, either that those
whom by the course of War, which they had chose to engage in against us, we
might justly make one prisoners, should in a course of Law, become our Masters
and Commanders; or that those who the other day did, in an hestile manner,
endeavor to have been our executioners, should, now we have by force took
their preparations against us, become our Judges, we suppose, no reasonable
man, nor themselves, when they will consider it, can expect from us.

Upon all these considerations of the justness of the cause, and the necessity
of the thing, for the safety of the Parliament, Kingdom, and this Army,
(having no other way left timely to remedy the difficulties we are put upon, or
prevent the growing dangers of future violence unto the Parliament, and
disturbances to the Kingdom, or to secure the Parliament in a quiet proceeding
to settle the peace of the Kingdom: And (in such case) the safety of the
people being the supria^^e Law we do protest and declare: That if any of those
Members, who during the absence of the Speakers, and the rest of the Members of
both Houses (forced away by the tumultuous violence aforesaid) did sit, and
Vote in the pretended Houses then continuing at Westminster, that hereafter
intrude themselves to sit in Parliament, before they shall have given
satisfaction to the respective Houses whereof they are, concerning the grounds
of their sad sitting at Westminster, during the absence of the said Speakers,
and shall have acquitted themselves by sufficient Evidence, That they did not
procure, or give their consent unto any of those pretended Votes, Orders, or
Ordinances tending to the raising and leavying of a War (as is before
declared: or for the Kings coming forthwith to London) we cannot any longer
suffer the same, but shall do that right to the Speakers and Members of both
Houses, who were driven away to us, and to our selves with them (all whom the
said other Members have endeavored in an Hostile manner most unjustly to
destroy) and also to the Kingdom (which they endeavored to imbroyle in a new
War) as to take some speedy and effectual course, whereby to restrain them
from being their own, and ours, and the Kingdoms Judges in those things
wherein they have made themselves Parties, by this means to make War, that
both they and others that are guilty of, and Parties to the aforesaid
treasonable and destructive practices and proceedings against the freedom of
Parliament, and peace of the Kingdom, may be brought to condign punishment
(and that) at the Judgment of a free Parliament, concisting (duly and
properly) of such Members of both Houses respectively, who stand clear from
such apparent and treasonable breach of their trust as is before expressed.

By the appointment of his Excellency, and the General Council of his Army.
Signed, Io. Rushworth Secretary.
