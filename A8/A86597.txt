A Letter from Sir JOHN HOTHAM to Master Speaker of the Honorable House of
Commons.
SIR,
I Am very sorry, I have this unhappy occasion to write to you, which is Sir
Hugh Cholmleys Revolt; who has of late taken a Commission from the King, for
the forces he had raised by authority of Parliament, and for the Castle of
Scarborough; It seems he thought at first to have carried it so closely, as to
have (before I perceived) retired all he had in this Town, and for that
purpose sent Captain Bushel with a Ship and seven pieces of Ordnance in her;
But as God would have it, I had the night before a secret intelligence sent me
of it, and so have the Ship and Ordnance sure: And thereupon instantly
dispatched a Catch to Captain Haddock, and our Ships that ride Northward to
give them notice of it, lest little suspecting his revolt they might put into
that Haven and be entrapped, and my Catch being at Sea well manned and having
in her four small Guns, met with a Scarborough Ship and Ammunition going from
the Parliament to him, which was three pieces of Ordinance, twenty barrels of
powder, forty Carabines, some Pistols and Swords, and two great Fats of Match,
all which they seized upon, and brought hither, and it shall, God willing, be
better employed. Captain Bushel protests deeply his innocence, and more then
that he was to bring back some of Sir Hughs things from Hull, he knew not any
thing of the business, and swears to me he will do his utmost service for
you. Most of Sir Hughs Officers, and a very great many both of his horse and
foot have forsaken him, and are now at Hull with me: Sir Thomas Nortcliff, a
son in law of mine came from him to me yesternight with thirty good horse, and
tells me he hopes, the rest will follow his Captain, Lieutenant Vanderhurst
came with him. Captain Ledgard a Kinsman of mine, that I sent from hence, has
likewise left him: But Lieutenant Colonel Alured was the first that consented
to join with him in this bad action. Thus have I truly related to you by my
first opportunity, the whole progress of this unfortunate attempt wherein he
has utterly lost himself, but God be blessed, done your business no prejudice.

The two Dutchmen are exceeding gallant men, and have done you very good
service, the ones name is Froome, the other Vanderhurst; I have in your name,
assured them of your constant respect to all fidelity. Sir, there shall no
opportunity of doing the House service escape me; and since I sent Captain
Bushel thither, he has performed his Trust gallantly, imprisoned one James
Cholmley, whom Sir Hugh had left there; and seized upon the Castle. I sent my
Catch with more Soldiers to relieve him, and twenty pound to the Soldiers in
the Castle to drink.

Sir, I ever remain your most humble Servant, John Hotham.

SIR,
ALthough I cannot but believe you have already heard of the rendering the
Castle of Scarborough, by Sir Hugh Cholmley to the Cavaliers, yet because (it
may be) some may be desirous to be satisfied how it comes to pass that a Fort
of that strength should be put into another hand without blood, to give you and
all the world satisfaction in that particular, I have addressed these unto you
being my old friend and acquaintance, and blame me not (I beseech you) if in
doing it I exceed the bounds of a Letter, for I desire to set forth all the
circumstances according to truth, and when I have so done let the blame stick
where it is, I hope my self and other the Officers who quitted the employment,
shall appear to be honest men, and to have done nothing but what was fit for
those who had a care of the public, as well as their own private interests.

Upon Friday the tenth of March (as I take it) Sir Hugh Cholmley, to whose
trust the Castle was committed by Parliament, and by him to me in his absence
came to Scarborough from Beverley, whither upon the taking of Stamford bridge
by the Enemy, he was retreated from Malton (it being conceived not tenable, as
the Enemies forces then lay.) I dare not say that at his return thither, he had
any intention to betray the Castle, for the very next day, he called my self
and the rest of his Officers to consult touching the putting of forces into the
Castle of Pickering, and the breaking down Yeddingham, and How bridges for the
preservation of Pickeringlythe which all of us conceived to be very necessary,
and for that purpose Captain Froom, a German, who commanded his own troop,
Sir Tho: Nortcliffe with his troop of Dragooners, and another troop of
Dragooners commanded by one Lieutenant Strangways ( Medley the Captain being
formerly taken prisoner at Yarum) were sent abroad, but by the way they found
the Enemy was got before them, and had possessed themselves of Pickering Town
and Castle with some other Towns not far distant, and had placed diverse
Musketeers at How bridge (being the most considerable) for the securing of
that passage against us: So that it was utterly impossible for them without
certain ruin, or at least extreme danger to effect that they were sent for.
Yet falling happily upon some of the Enemies forces at Thornton, who were newly
come thither from plundring Sir John Hotham and his Tenants at Fyling they
resolved to charge them, which accordingly they did, not surprising them in
their quarters, as was falsely suggested by the other party: for Captain Froom,
caused a Pistol to be discharged at the Town end, and a Drum to be beat a
quarter of a mile ere he came to the Town, by which the Enemy had the alarm,
and put themselves in a posture of defense, but God gave the victory to us, and
delivered into our hands one and twenty prisoners, of which one was a Sergeant
Major, another a Captain, a 3d. a Lieutenant, two Cornets, with one of their
Colors two Quarter Masters, three Corporals, a Trumpeter and a Farrier, the
rest were common Troopers, there being at that time two or three Troops more of
the Enemy within 12 score (who had not the spirit to assist their fellows) and
near upon 500 more within a mile or two, which occasioned our men (having
intelligence of it) not to prosecute that success so fully as otherwise they
would if the Enemy had been further distant: These prisoners were brought to
Scarborough, where they were used with all humanity (wherein it must be
acknowledged, he has not been awanting to any he has heretofore taken;
notwithstanding the cruel usage of his men which were taken at Yarum: After
some time letters passed betwixt him, Colonel Goring and others, and upon one
day two Trumpets came to Scarborough, the one from Collonell Goring at York,
the other from Sir Francis Mackworth at Thornton where the forementioned
conflict was, and where the Enemy at that time lay quartered. My self and
others were made believe these Trumpets came for exchange of Prisoners; though
I confess I wondered much two Trumpets should come from two places at one time
for one and the same business; Yet such was my respect unto him, and my
confidence in his fidelity, that I soon answered my self, with this that it
might well be, and so, said nothing of it to any man. I do not know what the
contents of those Letters were, but after that, I found, he would at several
times advance the Kings and the Earl of Newcastles Forces, exceedingly
undervaluing those under the command of the Earl of Essex and the Lord
Fairfax, he often affirmed he was slighted by the Parliament, to whom he had
several times written for supplies, but could never obtain them in that
measure that he desired. What his intentions were in it whither to sound my
fidelity, or for some other end I know not, but I endeavored to give him as
satisfactory an answer as I could, yet did not all this time imagine or conceit
that he intended any way to defraud the trust concreded to him by the
Parliament.

Mr. James Cholmely his kinsman (whose son serves the Earl of Crawford, and
who I fear has had too great an influence upon him in this business) was
afterward (as I imagine) sent to York about the effecting of this fine
design, though at his return he gave it out with many deep protestations that
riding into the Country about some business, he was made prisoner by the
Enemy about 6 miles from Scarborough, and carried to York, from whence by
means of some friend and acquaintance he there meet with, he said, he had
happily escaped.

On Monday the 20. of March Sir Hugh Cholmley rid early abroad with one servant
only, and lest I should suspect something, sent one to me, to tell me he was
gone to meet Sir John Hotham, that they might consult touching the sending of
Forces to him for clearing that side of the Countries: but he desired if any
asked for him, I should say he was gone to Whitby his own house to take care
for the preservation of it and the Town, which had formerly made good
expressions of fidelity to the King and Parliament. I expected he would have
returned at night, but finding he did not, wondered at it, yet feared no
change, because I suspected nothing, conceiving the place of meeting with Sir
John Hotham, and the length of the consultation might very well retard his
return till the next day. He then returned and told me, he had stayed the
night before at Ganton (a friends house to us both being 6 miles from
Scarborough) which because I knew nothing to the contrary, nor dreamed of any
falsity, I did easily believe. On Thursday morning he sent Captain Brown
Bushel to Hull with a small Ship, which he and I, and some others had newly
set forth to restrain provisions for going to Newcastle, with directions to
bring from thence certain money and other things which lay there for him, but I
was neither made acquainted with his going by Sir Hugh nor suspected any ill
intentions for delivery of the Castle until Friday betwixt 7 and 8 of the
clock at night that he sent for me up into the Castle (where he lay) and after
some discourse fell to magnify the Kings forces, and at last told me plainly
he was at York on Monday before with the Queen, that he resolved to hold the
Castle for the King, and by Commission from him, and that he intended the next
day so to declare himself, asking me my resolution concerning it. I told him,
he gave me very short warning; Yet I hoped (although I conceived he had dealt
very ill with me being his near kinsman, and whom he had engaged in the same
service with him) to capitulate touching the rendering of the Castle without
making me acquainted before hand with it that I might provide for my own
safety) he would give me leave to use my conscience, which he said he was
willing to do; I then desired him I might have liberty to pass to Hull with
my wife and children, and that I might have a note from him to that purpose,
which he promised to do; and further, that if I were taken by the way, he
would procure my enlargement. I spoke to him further concerning his breach of
trust, and told him what a dishonor it would be to himself, and what a
stain to his posterity thus to violate it, and would gladly have persuaded him
to have continued faithful, offering to go post my self to London for him
and to labor to obtain such conditions for him from the Parliament, as he
should approve and like of; But he answered he was engaged and resolved to
perform what he had promised, and so I left him, and presently went into the
Town to consult with a friend what course to run, but he not being within, I
returned to my own house. About ten of the clock at night I received letters
from Hull, by which I had notice of his resolution, together with a packet to
himself from Sir John Hotham, which because I conceived there might be in it
some good advice, and for that I was desirous he should consult with his
pillow about it, I was very careful to see delivered, and therefore sent one
of my servants up with it to the Castle. It seems the Letters were of another
effect then I suspected, for Sir John Hotham having notice of his resolution to
render the Castle, and conceiving Captain Bushel was by him employed to Hull
with no good intent, and not knowing whither he might comply with him or not in
that bad action, had made stay of Captain Bushel, and the Ship, and thereof
gave him notice by those letters. He wished my man to tell me I should come to
him to the Castle in the morning, which accordingly I did; He told me what Sir
John Hotham had done to Bushel and that he must stay me in lieu of him till
he were delivered, yet promised to protect me from violence, and that I
should not receive the least prejudice, and upon my faith given not to stir
without his license, he was content I should walk at liberty. I presently
dispatched a messenger to Hull to give Sir John Hotham notice of these
proceedings, and endeavored my self in the mean time to get my goods on
Shipboard, that I might take an opportunity of getting my Family and them away
(if it might be) though I stayed behind my self. After my departure he sent
for Sir Thomas Norcliffe, Captain Froom, Captain Vanderhurst a Dutchman, who
commanded his Foot company, and other his Officers to whom he imparted his
resolution. Sir Thomas Norcliffe so much misliked the business, that he
presently departed to Hull, Froom told him he would be ready to serve him in an
honest way, but never used to be of the Traitors company, Vanderhurst and
some others took time to deliberate. About nine of the clock Froom,
Vanderhurst with about 8 or 9. troopers came to my house to advise with me what
was to be done; We debated the business, and truly the Soldiers were very
ill pleased that he dealt so with us, and showed themselves very forward to
have marched up to the Castle, and have made him prisoner. The men were all
strangers to me, and two of them to this Kingdom, and therefore I held it no
great discretion to discover my self too far unto them whose hearts I knew
not, nor whither some of them might not be sent by him to sift and circumvent
me, and it may be, if I had showed my self extreme forward in it, some of them
might have been jealous of me, because I was his kinsman: I returned this
answer; That for my own part I would adventure my skin in the quarrel as
freely as any man, but as for attempting to surprise the Castle, I could not
assent unto it for these reasons; It was a place of great strength, and
advantage to him that was then within it, The Inhabytants of the Town were
extreme malignant, we had not felt the pulse of the Soldiers, nor knew how
they stood affected, nor what the Gunners intended to do, who were the men must
do much of the business if it came to action (three of which were but newly
brought in by him, and one or two of those three had formerly borne part in a
mutiny which was made against one in the Town by some ill affected persons for
which I had punished them, and therefore had the less reason to trust them.)
But besides all this, I told them there was a powerful enemy at hand (or at
least within call) from whom we must expect certain ruin if we should show
our selves, and not go through with the business as we desired. As we were
thus debating the business, comes one in and informs us, that there were two
Troops of horse at the Towns end, which quite spoiled all our business, for
although the report was grounded upon a mistake, either of some Market people
who were then coming to the Market, or else of Sir Thomas Norcliffes
Dragoones, many of which went that day from Scarborough after their Captain,
yet because it was not without probability, it caused us to break off our
discourse, and this was the very reason why we did nothing, for it could not
sink into our heads that any man of discretion should be so impudent as to
betray a Fort, and have no power of the Enemy to join with him in case he
should find opposition within, especially when the chief Officers had not bin
formerly consulted with, nor their affections tried, nor any party made amongst
the Soldiers, to make that good which was intended. After this I had several
thoughts what to do. It grieved me to see the Castle thus lost, but I was
jealous of my power to help it: Many things came into my mind, and a great
conflict I had in my self touching the point of assassination, and whither in
point of conscience, it were lawful without any by-ends of ones own to kill an
Enemy to God and his Country, as my heart told me he was, and so taking him
away in this sin, send him in all probability to Hell. At last I resolved in
dubits, optimum est sequi tutiorem partem, and therefore chused rather to watch
an opportunity, if I could to make him prisoner, To which purpose I went up to
the Castle, I conferred with several Soldiers, whom I found cordial to the
Cause, yet fearful to engage themselves without good force to back them. I
spoke with an Officer who must be namelesse, who seemed much to lament the
Colonels Apostasy, and desired of me to know what was to be done; I asked him
if he would be honest, he protested he would, I wished him then to clap to my
Lieutenant (whom he had corrupted, and who then stood like Cerberus keeping
hell gates) as I would to the Colonel, and we would make them both prisoners.
He asked me touching the affections of the Soldiers, I told him I was
confident, they were right and would stick to us; so down we went to the Guard
together, to see the number of them, and to prepare them before hand for our
intended design: Just as we were going down came the Colonel, and three or
four of his servants armed with Pistols, so that we were forced to break off
our communication, and went along with him: As we came by the Guard he stayed
and told the soldiers what he intended, but protested he aimed at nothing,
but the peace of the Country and obedience to the King, I hearing that answered
I hoped we had not bin in a way of rebellion all this time. At which word he
catched me by the hand and calling for half a score muskettires said he would
teach me to rule my tongue: I told him if he hanged me I must and would speak
having so good reason for it, and so was I carried guarded with his servants
and those Musketeers to his house where I remained till upon settling of both
our hot blood, he was content to let me go, with my wife, children, and goods
to Hull, upon my promise first made to procure Sir John Hotham to enlarge
Captain Bushel within two days, or else return to Scarborough within that
time, which I assured him I would do; and thereupon had his license to depart
that night by sea for Hull. On Monday I there arrived and that day obtained
Bushels enlargement who the next day returned to Scarborough, but never got any
thanks for it from him who seemed so tender over him as you shall hear
afterward. Captain Froom, and Captain Vanderhurst followed me with almost
all the troop, and diverse of the foot soldiers who now serve under me at
Hull, where by Sir John Hotham I am again put into employment as are also the
other two Captains, Froom being made Captain of the troup he brought with
him and Vanderhust his Lieutenant according to their own desires. And thus
Sir, you have all the particular circumstances of this bad action; let me beg
your patience but a little and you shall have the second part of the story,
which I hope will give both your self and all honest men better satisfaction.

Captain Bushel (though Cozen German to the Collonell) did so little approve
of his kinsmans ways that he made many protestations ere he went from Hull to
recover the Castle thus perfidiously lost. It fell out happily that Mr. James
Cholmley a man of no great experience was made Captain of the Castle and Henry
Bushel (who is Captain Bushells Brother) his lieutenant. The two brothers
confer together and at twelve of the Clock at night, on Thursday last the
Captain with 4 more was let in by his brother, who had prepared the Soldiers
(ready enough to revolt from that side they liked not) with Beer and Tobacco,
he acquainting the soldiers with his intentions, they promised to stick to
him, the sergeant who commanded the guard was laid hold on, the Gunners were
next surprised; but swore fidelity, there was nothing left now but to get the
Tower, a place of great strength where the Captain was lodged, and in which
all the ammunition and provisions for the Castle were laid. For the effecting
hereof the Sergeant was caused to knock at the gate and to tell the keeper of
the Magazin who came to know what was the matter that there was an alarm in
the Town and that the soldiers must be furnished with powder and shot, Credit
being given hereunto and the gate opened Bushel entered with his soldiers,
commanded the delivery of the keys and thereby became Master of the Castle
without one drop of blood spilt on either side and in it of the new made
Captain, and the next morning of one Captain Sunderland and some other
Cavaliers who were come to rejoice with their new gotten friend. And thus the
Castle of Scarbrough which both in my own and the opinion of many being well
and sufficiently provided is able to oppose an army of 10000 men was twice
taken in one week: first by treachery, and afterward by honest policy, and is
now in the hands of Captain Bushel, who vows to hold it for the King and
Parliament, and sooner to blow up the fabric then that ever it should come
into the hands of the Cavaliers: This day he writ Letters to Sir John Hotham
for assistance, which he has taken care to be sent to him to morrow morning. I
hope the Parliament will think of him that recovered it, and give him such
requital as shall encourage both him and all others to adhere and stick close
unto them: I will trouble you no further at present being weary with writing,
If I may receive any letters from you the next week here at Hull, I shall be
willing to hold Intelligence with you, and to let you know the passages of the
North. However, Sir, I assure you none is more truly yours, then

Hull Good Friday 1643. Your affectionate friend and servant.

FINIS.
