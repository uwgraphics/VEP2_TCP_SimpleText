WHEREAS At the General Quarter Sessions of the Peace holden at Bury St.

William Playters Baronet, Will. Heweningham Esquire. Sir William Soam Knight. John
Clark, Thomas Cook, James Calthorpe, Samuel Moody, Rich. Brewster, Thomas
Chaplin, Esquires, Justices of the Peace for the aforesaid County, then, and
there sitting: It appeared as well upon the view and knowledge of some of the
said Justices, as also upon the Petition of the Inhabitants of New Market in
the said County of Suffolk, and by diverse Affidavits before them in open Court
made, that upon the Eleventh day of August, in the said Year of our Lord God,
One thousand six hundred fifty and one; There happened a sudden and lamentable
Fire within the said Town and Parish of New Market, which in a short space
consumed, and burned down to the ground, Nine dwelling Houses, with Barns,
Stables, and Outhouses, and much Corn, Hay, and Household Stuff to the value
of Two thousand five hundred sixty five pounds, and upwards, as by the
particular Valuation, and several Affidavits, thereupon made to the said
Court, appeared, whereby many of the poor distressed Inhabitants became utterly
destitute of habitation, or any means of livelihood, and likely to be utterly
undone, and perish, unless special and speedy care be taken for their
relief; And God in mercy move the hearts of well-disposed people in compassion
toward them. For the furtherance of which pious and charitable Work: The
Parliament having been acquainted with the particulars of the said sad and
lamentable Accident, did thereupon the Fifteenth day of August last past,
Order, That the said distressed Inhabitants of New Market aforesaid, shall be
Authorized by Letters Pattents, under the Great Seal of England to Collect and
gather the charity of well-disposed people, within the Cities and Counties
hereafter mentioned. Know ye therefore, That We being willing and desirous that
such relief might be afforded to them herein, as to others in like cases has
been heretofore granted, and not doubting, but that all good Christians within
the said respective places (having a fellow-feeling of their miseries and
distresses, occasioned as aforesaid, will be ready to extend their liberal
Contributions toward the Relief, Help, and Comfort of their distressed
Brethren in this their great Necessity) Have, Given and Granted; And by these
Our Letters Pattents, do Give and Grant unto the said Inhabitants of
New Market aforesaid, and to their Deputy and Deputies, the Bearer and Bearers
hereof, full Power, License, and Authority to ask, gather, receive, and take
the Alms and charitable Benevolence of all good and wel-disposed people
Inhabiting within the Cities of London Westminster, York and Norwich, with the
Suburbs and Liberties thereof: And in the Counties of Lincoln, Norfolk,
Suffolk Cambridge and York and all the Cities, Towns Corporate, Privileged
places, Parishes, Villages, and all other places whatsoever, within the said
Cities, and Counties before specified, and not elsewhere, toward the Relief
of themselves and their languishing Families. Wherefore, We Will and Command
you, and every of you, That at such time, and times as the said Inhabitants, or
their said Deputy, or Deputies, the Bearer, or Bearers hereof; shall come and
repair to any of your Churches, Chapels, or any other places, to ask, and
receive the gratuities, and charitable Benevolence of good, and well-disposed
people, quietly to permit, and suffer them so to do, without any manner of Let
disturbance, or Contradiction whatsoever. And you the said Parsons, Ministers,
Lecturers, Vicars, and Curats, for the better stirring up of a charitable
Devotion, are deliberately to publish and declare the Tenor of these Letters
Pattents, or the Copy, or Brief thereof unto the people upon some Sabbath day
next after the same shall be tendered or delivered unto you, exhorting, and
persuading them to extend their liberal Contributions in so good and charitable
a deed. And you the Overseers of the poor of every Parish where such
Collection is to be made as aforesaid, to collect, and gather the Alms and
charitable Benevolence as well of strangers, as your fellow-Parishoners. And
what shall be by you so gathered, to be by the Minister and your selves,
endorsed on the backside of these Letters Pattents, or the Copy or brief
thereof in words at length, and not in figures. And the Sum and Sums of
Money so gathered, and endorsed, to deliver to the Bearer or Bearers of these
Letters Pattents, and to no other person or persons whatsoever, when you shall
be by them thereunto required. And in case it so fall out that any Parish
within the Cities or Counties aforesaid being destitute of a Minister, shall be
without public Assemblies. Then the Overseers of the poor of the said Parish,
or Parishes, so destitute as aforesaid, are hereby required to go from house
to house to gather and receive the charity and benevolence of the Inhabitants
of the same. And lastly, Our Will and Pleasure is, for the more assurance of
faithful, and equal dealing in the Receipt, Account, and Distribution of the
Moneys hereby to be collected, by virtue of these Presents. That no person or
persons whatsoever shall receive any of the Moneys so collected, but such as

Drury, John Cotterell, John Husk, John Bryant, and Thomas Green, or the major
part of them, and that the moneys so collected and raised by virtue thereof,
shall be distributed amongst such only of those damnified by the said Fire, as
are in this case fit to be relieved by public charity. And by such
proportions to each of them as shall be thought fit, and set down in writing
under the hands of the said persons last above named, or the major part of them
as aforesaid, at such times and places as shall be by them, or the major part
of them from time to time appointed for that purpose; And they the aforesaid
persons, or the major part of them, in like manner are to appoint in whose
hands the moneys collected shall be kept, until the same shall come to be
distributed, and how the accounts thereof shall be ordered, according to the
true intent and meaning of these Our Letters Patents, Any Statute, Law,
Ordinance, or Provision heretofore made to the contrary hereof in any wise
notwithstanding. In witness whereof, We have caused these Our Letters to be
