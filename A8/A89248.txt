funeral monument of Charles I

Virtus post Funera vivit. HEre lies great CHARLES, first King of that same
name,
Englands great glory, Englands lasting fame;
A Butchered Martyr King, whose patient mildness,
Crowns himself with Fame, his foes with vildnesse:
A persecuted Saint, for seven years space
Pressed down with sorrows, yet held up by Grace;
In whom those Virtues constantly did live,
Which to the Worthies lasting fame did give:
Patient as Job, and like to Moses, mild,
Salomons wisdom makes him Wisdoms child;
Valiant as David, and the chiefest part
Like to Josiah, zeal possessed his heart:
Faithful in Vows, yet there began the strife,
That reav'd him of his Queen, his Crown, his Life:
Whose true Effigies drawn by just desert,
Causes him live in each true Subjects heart:
Living he died, and dying life he gained,
Death conquered him, his foes with shame he stained.
FINIS.
