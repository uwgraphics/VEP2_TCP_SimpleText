A JUST PROVOCATION OF MASTER TOMBS, TO Make good his general charge against
Mr WILLIAM HUSSEY'S Satisfaction to his scepticall Exercitation.

By William Hussy, Minister of the Gospel, at Chesilhurst in Kent.

1 Timothy 6.4, 5. He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions, and
strifes of words, whereof comes envy, strife, raylings, evil surmisings,
perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth.

TO The Right Honorable the LORDS and COMMONS Assembled in PARLIAMENT.
RIght Honorable, Master Tombs having heretofore set forth an Exercitation,
in doubtful termss against Childrens baptism; your Petitioner perusing the
several answers that were made to him seeing they walked in the tracke, and
had not stated up the question to the hight, as the Scriptures would afford, to
the stopping the mouth of the Anabaptists; your Petitioner, as the necessary
employment of his cure would permit, has put his hand to the work, whereupon
Master Tombs has taken liberty to slight him, and accuse him in general
terms with all kind of mistakes, citing two or three which are indeed no
mistakes but truths, wrapping up all the rest thus: that his book is nothing
else but mistakes, which is most uncivil, and in an Heretic, as your
Petitioner humbly conceives, worthy your Honors censure; the rather because
he has taken liberty to write against the Directory, and unjustly charging it
with falsehood; calling it a cothurnus, fitter for a counsel of Trent, then a
Protestant Church: And that upon a false ground, as your Petitioner will
clearly prove; so as Master Marshall, who is concerned in the business, and
otherwise publicly employed, will put the matter ever to him; and Master
Tombs shall be first ordered to answer his book, or renounce his Anabaptisme,
which in civil right he ought to do; general charges being calumnies, and
not answers, so as they reflect on your Petitioner: and as the matter is
Anabaptisme it is of public concernment. Your Petitioner does humbly beseech
your Honors at least to keep these vaunting Heretics within the bounds of
civility, and not permit them to rail at Orthodox Writers and call them fools
without any reason, for writing such things as the Learned Grammarians, and
Translatours of the Scripture will warrant them to write, leaving these
writings they cannot answer, and yet persist in their errors.

And for that Bachelor, your Petitioner does humbly desire that he may not any
longer be permitted to license books, unless he had more skill to look unto
them, for that he has put the stamp of Learning, Ingenuity, Piety, upon such
a pamphlet as has rayled at the Directory and other Orthodox Writers without
ground. I wish that some school of Divinity were set up, where Master Tombs
and such other discontented persons might have full liberty to vent their
opinions, and not permitted to poison the people.

Your Honors

A Provocation of Master Tombs, to make good his charge, etc.
MAster Tombs met with my book and read it, and begins with the title as
though he would answer it, but after he finds an excuse, why he should not;
he only finds some few absurdities, which had they been faulty, as he
pretends, might have better excused him for slighting the rest: but if those
which he finds fault with, be unjustly called absurdities and errors, the
general will appear to be unjust, until he answer the book: I shall first
clear my self of those faults which he charge upon me.

The first is, that I called his exercitation skeptic, which he clecreth, by
setting down out of Gellius, that a skeptic determines nothing but always
stands considering and seeking, which he proves to be unduly placed upon his
exercitation, because Mr M^rshall says, he is too confident: and because his
examen is positive: what if Master Marshall upon some occasion does accuse
Master Tombs of too much confidence? is not his exercitation therefore
skeptic? may not Master Tombs in some things be too confident, and yet his
exercitation remain scepticall? or is this a good argument, to prove his
exercitation not scepticall, because his examen is positive? he confesses,
that he did propose his thoughts in his exercitaion to the Committee of the
Assembly (as he conceived befitting him) under the for^ of doubts: I blame him
not for being doubtful, I wish he had continued doubtful still, until he had
received satisfaction: but I say as he confesses, his exercitation was
scepticall and doubtful, but do I therefore accuse him of adhering to nothing
in sense, reason, or faith, he says, (if I understood what I say) by saying
that his exercitation is skeptic, I do so accuse him: but if he understood
what he said, he would not say so, what is an argument a particulari ad
universale good; Mr Tombs is skeptic in his exercitation therefore in every
thing? Mr Tombs his exercitation and examen are against Paedobaptists,
therefore every Sermon he makes, every word he speaks, is against
Paedobaptists, were no good argument; but Master Tombs says, he could give
better reason, to call me fantastic, then I bring for this new name I pin on
him: truly, I brought no reason for calling it skeptic, it was notum per se,
it was doubtful, all men at first view may perceive, and Master Tombs is
constreined to confess it; neither does he bring any reason for his denial,
but the grossest and most illiterate folly in the world, there is not show
enough to make it a fallacy, because his examen is not, his exercitation is not
skeptic, but when he does bring forth those reasons he can to prove me
fantastic by, he shall have answers, or thanks for disclosing my infirmity
to me; I will not serve him, as he does me; rail at his arguments, I dare not
touch.

I term my book satisfaction to his exercitation, I intended it so, and I
hope it will prove so to the judgment of the learned, though Master Tombs
will take none: because he was not scepticall at first, but a confirmed
Heretic, and an Hypocrite, appearing under doubtful terms; and had I known
the deceiptfulnesse of Master Tombes's heart, I would not have graced his book
with the name of skeptic, to be doubtful in matters of error, is far
better then to be positive; so the word skeptic was given in favor, not in
malice; from sound reason, not fancy, whatsoever Master Tombs says. For my
book, I hope it shall not, disgrace the judicious Licenser, but I shall get
from the Licenser of your book, and your self, better satisfaction by the
Lords and Commons (that sit to do us all justice) then to bespatter you with
some few flashing words.

I conceive I have stated up the question out of Scripture so, as may make all
Anabaptists seal up their mouths (as it has already sealed up yours) you
find some passages something varying from the common tenet which you represent
to the common view, without entering into the state of the question, requiring
it or considering the strength of the arguments that prove it, or the
Scriptures that evince it: whatsoever I have affirmed in my book that you have
not answered, I shall endeavor to make good, when I shall receive a just call
so to do; In the mean time I address my self to answer what Master Tombs
further says against me.

Having repeated sundry passages of my book, he falls upon some small
confutation, his words are. Nor do I think the principal grounds of his new
fancy will satisfy; that, Matthew. 28.19, is thus to be expounded, make
Disciples by baptizing, and teaching them; whereas he himself sundry times
reads it better, make Disciples of all Nations baptizing them, and it is
vainly alleged that [by] is employed in the participiall expression any more
then (...) must be expounded, he met them by saying, or Math. 27.55. (...) they
followed by ministering unto him, and I said justly Examen page 127. this
conceit is so absurd, that I presume none that has any Wit will entertain it,
though Master Hussy say page 6. I think, if ever a man were out of his Wit,
it was here; but I shall be willing the Assembly judge whether of us two need
sail to Anticyra, to purge our brains. After a long collection of many words
here and there in my book, which he represents as absurd, (whereas my new
conceits, as he has observed them are sundry, and have their several
grounds which he concealeth,) he says the principal grounds of my conceit
is, that the 28. of Math. 19. ought to be expounded, make Disciples by
baptizing them, though I sundry times read it better. I never read the words
so, but it is true in the stating the question I did take the liberty of an
answerer to expound them so, make Disciples baptizing them, make Disciples by
baptizing them; which I said was implied in the participiall expression,
wherein I am confident the best Grammarians will bear me out. Clenard medit.
Gracanic^, page 281.40. participium vary redditur nune adversum quiddam
indicans, nunc causam explicans, preinde quae participiae Gracia efferuntur nos
latiui^ate donavimus per ejusmedi conjunctionem quae commodissime facit ad
sensum.

The participle, ye see is variously rendered; sometimes it does declare the
cause, and if the participle do express the cause, then the cause may be
expounded by the word [by,] and if in rendering Greek into Latin we may
express the Greek participle by any conjunction that the sense will be are;
why may we not express it by a preposition, that the sense will bear? the
word conjunction in some latitude of Language may be called a preposition, a
word joined to fill up the sense; which when the participle does signify the
cause as here it may, the formal cause of making Disciples; why may it not be
rendered by [by] scire est per causam scire? I said it might signify modum
agendi, this I have liberty to do, as an answerer to interpret Scriptute as I
please; if I do it as the words will not bear, Master Tombs has his liberty
to confute it by an argument: but see how Master Tombs does confute it, by
alleging two places of Scripture, where he conceives the participle may not
conveniently be rendered by [by:] now see the strength of this confutation,
participium says Clenard, vary redditur: a participle is variously rendered,
the participle cannot be rendered by [by] in Mr Tombs his assigned places,
therefore no where, therefore not in the place by me interpreted; this is to
take away Clenards rule, and the variety of rendering participles, if
participles be variously rendered, then in some places they are rendered one way;
in other places another, or else there can be no variety: Master Tombs
therefore must find out some better argument, to prove that the participle may
not be rendered by [by:] besides that, I said the participle might signify
modum agendi, and even in the places alleged by Mr Tombs, the participles
do signify the manner of doing. Jesus met them saying, all hayl does not this
saying all hail enter into the manner of the congresse, if the meeting of any 2
persons should be historically related, would not the history be lame if their
conference were left out? and for that of Mat. 27.55. they followed him
ministering unto him: does not this ministering unto him signify the manner of
their following him? that they followed him not directing him that had been as
guides, or masters; but ministering as friends or servants helping him to such
things as he stood in need of, (...) doing such things for him as he required.
Masters do use to follow their servants, to look to them in their work; and
servants their masters, to minister unto them; and these followings (do
differ) modo agendi, they are different followings: but I am not so straightly
tied up, that if in this place the participle do signify, [by] that it must so
signify in all places; but Master Tombs says, that it was so feolish, that
none would entertain it that has any Wit: to which I said in my book, that
Master Tomb^s, notwithstanding he had said, none would entertain it that has
any Wit; yet he proves it no better then by saying, if this were true, they
need only baptize them, and not teach them: notwithstanding Christ commanded
both to baptize them, and teach them; and for this I said, if any were out of
his Wit, it was here; and this willingly I refer to the Assembly, whether any
but he, that were out of his Wit could affirm, that if Christ command to
baptize and teach, it were sufficient to baptize, or that they need only
baptize; is a command containing diverse things in conjunctive terms, executed
by performing one part alone, and leaving the other part undone. I hope the
Assembly will do us that right, to judge which of us two are out of our Wit,
for one of us must needs be unadvised. Master Tombs talks of a purge, to
purge his brain; certainly he is full of foul matter, for he vomiteth much
bitterness, and black calumnies against me: my book is nothing but mistakes,
sure he is sick, he cannot speak sense; he is light headed, it is the
strength of his disease; he divides my mistakes, into mistakes in Logic,
Divinity, and sometimes in Grammar, but most of all of his meaning, and scope
of his words, and strength of his arguments. See here be four kinds of
mistakes, Logic, Divinity and Grammar, he means sure English Grammar, by
the mistake of the Printer; or haste in the business; but the fowlest is, in
his meaning, scope of his words, force of his arguments, it seems he has a
sense, and his arguments have a force, that neither Grammar, Logic, nor
Divinity can find cut: what kind of words and arguments be these that a man
may miss in, when he does not miss either in Grammar or in Logic (let
Divinity alone) Rhetorical arguments have no strength, but as they may be
reduced to Logic?

Surely, if he have any such meanings in his arguments, that Logic cannot
find out, I may be mistaken in them; and such is the sense of some of them:
for, by rules of Logic they have no sense at all, as I have made plainly
appear; but let me tell Mr Tombs, his general charges be illegal, and not
allowable in any civil commerce, and costs are justly awarded, and loss of
his cause, against any that lays only general charges in declaration
against an adversary, as your neighbour-Lawyers will tell you: you are bound in
common right, to give me satisfaction, and convict me of these mistakes; when
you tell the world, that know not what Logic, Grammar and Divinity means;
that my book is nothingelse but such mistakes: or else men of judgment must
condemn Master Tombs for a senseless ignorant rayler; but let Master Tombs
heartily show any mistakes in Logic, or any of these on which the state of
the question does depend, and I shall love him, and thank him for his labor:
Mr Tombs tells me that I end with a challenge to him, but he makes more
account of his time, then to answer my wild notions: truly it seems my
notions are too wild for him, to catch; such as will cast their rider if he be
an Antepaedobaptist. If he had let them alone, and not rayled at them, he might
have chosen whether he would have answered them or no; but now he is bound in
reason and charity, to make his general charges good in particular. Answer
them, perhaps he will not, because he cannot; then better words would have
becomm'd him.

He will not answer my challenge, he deals very plainly with the world
therein. I challenged him, not to answer my book, but to produce some argument
from Scripture, or sound reason, that shall reasonably conclude from the words,
without any adding or substracting, which may agree with the sense of the words
produced. This challenge he refuses, which in plain terms, is to affirm,
that he will never argue against Infant Baptism, either from Scripture, or
sound reason; but he will add or diminish something from them: wherein if he
be as good as his word, he will keep his old custom.

He further tells me, that he will not answer my book, unless he have time
to write a book to make sport withal; surely I did not write my book with
that levity of spirit to make Master Tombs sport, but vindicate truth, and to
confute his error; but if he will needs dance, I make no question but I shall
make him dance naked, wlthout any ragge of truth or reason to cover his shame
from the view of all the world.

Last of all, Master Tombs does charm me to hold my peace, and scoffeth at
Divinity schools; which if Master Tombs and I had, I confess we should both
write better: but in the mean time, I shall make a shift to write well enough,
to find Master Tombs his vanities, if he write no better then yet he has
done; and as for holding my peace, for Syons sake I cannot, as long as any
Antipaedobaptists dare so boldly outface the truth.

Postscript.
HAving committed this answer to the press, I thought good to acquaint my
Reader with some more confirmation, that a participle may be rendred[by.] First
Scotus, page 681. tells us, that the participle may be rendered by the gerund
in do, which is rendered in English [by:] and the translatours of the English
Bible have translated participles [by] Math. 6.27. which of you by taking care
(...): and in Romans 12.20. (...) in so doing, which is all one by so doing. So
gentle Reader, if I be a fool for saying, that the participle may be rendered
[by:] I am not so alone, nor without rule and reason to walk by.

FINIS.
