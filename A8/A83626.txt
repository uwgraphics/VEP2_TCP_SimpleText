Die Sabbathi 23 Ianuarii 1646.
WHereas the several Plantations in Virginia, Bermudas, Barbados, and other
places of America have been much beneficial to this Kingdom by the increase
of Navigation, and the Customs arising from the commodities of the growth of
those Plantations imported into this Kingdom have been, and are beneficial,
that all such as have traded there (for their better encouragement) have used
to transport from hence thither Merchandises, Goods, and necessaries for the
better carrying on of the said Plantations, without paying any Custom for any
Goods so exported from hence thither: The Lords and Commons assembled in
Parliament, for the better advancement of the said Plantations, and
encouragement of the Adventurers to the same, have Ordained, and be it Ordained
by the said Lords and Commons, That all Merchandise, Goods, and necessaries,
which shall be for the supportation, use, and expense of the said several
Plantations, shall, or may be exported thither from this Kingdom by any of the
Subjects thereof, without paying or yielding any Custom, Subsidy, Taxation,
Imposition, or other duty for the same; the duty of Excize excepted during the
space of three years next ensuing, except unto the Plantation in newfound
Lands; provided, That from time to time, as any such Merchandise and Goods be
endeavored to be exported for the use aforesaid, security be first given to
the Commissioners and Officers of the Customs where such Goods shall be laden,
that the said Merchandises and Goods so to be exported by virtue of this
Ordinance shall be really transported to the said foreign Plantations, and to
no other places, and there to be employed for the only use of the Plantations;
and that Certificate shall be returned from thence within one year after the
lading thereof of the Ships arrival, and discharge in the said foreign
Plantations. And for that there is great want of servants in the said
Plantations, as well for the raising of commodities apt to be produced there,
as for defense of themselves from being made a prey to the Natives, or
foreign enemies. Be it further Ordained by the said Lords and Commons, That
it shall be lawful for any person or persons, Subjects of this Kingdom, to
entertain, and transport from hence into the said several Plantations, such
persons being fit to serve, or advance the Trade there, as shall be willing to
serve, or to be employed in the said several foreign Plantations; provided,
that the names of all such persons so to be transported to serve in the said
Plantations, be first Registered in the Custom-house, and that neither force be
used to take up any such servants, nor any Apprentises entised to desert their
Masters, nor any Children under age admitted without express consent of their
Parents. And provided also, that certificate within one year be returned from
the Governor, or other chief Officer of such Plantation, where such persons
shall be put on shore, of the arrival of the said persons there, that no fraud
be used to carry any such persons to any other place; Provided always, that
none of the said Plantations do suffer or permit any Ship, Bark, or Vessel to
take in any Goods of the growth of the said Plantations from any of their
Ports, and carry them to any foreign parts and places, except in English
Bottomes; and in case any of the said Plantations shall offend herein, then the
Plantation so offending shall be excluded from the benefit of this Ordinance,
and shall pay custom as other Merchants do to France, Spain, Holland, and
other foreign parts.
