A Copy of a Letter to his Majesty, from the Lord Inchiquin.
May it please your most excellent Majesty,
WE your Majesty's most humble and Loyal Subjects the Protestants of the
Province of Munster do with all humility acknowledge your Majesty's special
care toward our preservation, and we should esteem our selves guilty of two
high an ingratitude if we should not discharge our duties to God, and your
sacred Majesty, by acquainting you that no peace can be concluded with the
Irish Rebels; which will not bring unto your Majesty and the English in
general, a far greater prejudice then the show of a peace here will bring us
an advantage; and since your Majesty has showed us so high a degree of your
pious care in all things that might take from our afflictions as our
Declaration does manifest to the world; those actions show so piously in your
Majesty that you have entrusted us, and makes us humbly beg your Majesty,
that you would not so much regard so inconsiderable a handful of people as we
are; as to purchase but a seeming security by leaving the Protestant Religion
in all likelihood to be extirpated, and your Majesty obnoxious to the loss of
this your Kingdom. Indeed it is too truly called a seeming security, as in
our Declaration which we humbly present unto your Majesty does largely and
plainly appear, as also with how much reason we have taken up arms, to defend
our Religion, lives, and your Majesty's Interests, and we firmly hope that our
infinite wrongs and miseries will be a sufficient motive and rise for your
Majesty to send unto the Parliament for the procuring of a peace in England,
without which we must be (as speedily) as unavoidably ruined, and, the
Protestant Religion quite rooted out of this Kingdom; We have likewise sent
our humble desires to the same purpose unto the Parliament, with a strong
belief that both your Majesty and they will so seriously consider the
justness and necessity of the Irish war, that it will wringe the sword out of
both your hands, and employ those armies (which are likely to be destructive to
the Protestant Religion) for the suppressing of those bloody enemies of the
Gospel; and truly when we consider how correspondent this blessed motion is
with the goodness of your Majesty's own inclination: We do not despair but
that God which brings the greatest things to pass by the weakest means, may
through our great necessities and humble prayers, restore England to that just
Peace which it has been so long deprived of. But if the judgments of the
Almighty are not all fallen upon that Kingdom, and that the just quarrel to
this nation, which would be far more glorious to the English armies, then the
wars there, is not a sufficient power to produce our agreement between your
Majesty and the Parliament. We do most humbly beseech your Majesty not to
give care to any that shall strive to blemish the Integrity of our
proceedings, since we take God to witness we aim at nothing but Gods glory,
your Majesty's honor, and the safety of the English Nation.

And that the world may see that your Majesty believes us to be (what really
we are) we humbly beg your Majesty, as we have likewise done the Parliament to
send us what supplies of Men, Arms and Ammunition your sacred Majesty thinks
fit for a people, which value not their lives and fortunes, where your
Majesty's honor is concerned, and that we may die as perfect Martyrs in the
opinion of men, as we are certain all those that suffer in this cause will be
in the eye of God; that your sacred Majesty would be pleased to proclaim
again the Irish to be rebels, and not pardon those who have committed so many
barbarous crimes, that they are as far above description, as they are short
of honesty, nay, more publicly, profess they had your Majesty's Commission
for what they did: The true sense of this divellish aspertion cast upon your
Majesty, with all those other reasons, which we have set down in our
Declaration, makes us resolve to die a thousand deaths rather then to
condescend to any peace with these perfidious Rebels; and since death is a
tribute we must all pay, who will apprehend the payment of it somewhat the
easier to purchase by it a Kingdom as full of glory as this is now of misery
to all honest men, neither is this only the resolution of all the most
considerable men amongst us, but of all in general; for our gracious God has
so inspired the hearts of all the Commonaltie, that they have vowed never to
desert the cause that is so visibly God Almighties, and we beseech the
Almighty so to direct your sacred Majesty, that our great miseries may
through your Majesty's pious furtherance beget that blessed peace in England,
which is so zealously praid for by

A Copy of a Letter to Coll. Nicholas Mynn.
Noble Sir,
SOme Counselors about the King have prevailed with him to make such an
agreement with the Rebels here as leaves the interest he now has in their
power, whereof we find they mean to make up for the Extirpation of the English
Nation and Protestant Religion out of this Kingdom: and this being discovered
unto us by certain and undoubted intelligence, we have given notice thereof to
King and Parliament, whose Assistance we have craved for our own defense, and
the mean time we have turned out the Irish, who we know were the Rebels
confederates, now we doubt the King will not approve of what we have done,
because the papisticall faction about him will oppose us, but we are confident
the Parliament will send us great supplies to follow the war against the
Irish, wherefore, and seeing our cause is so good, we are hopeful as many
forces as went from us will come to us forth with, and you I must desire to
come with your whole Regiments to Milford Haven, where you may recrewt your
Regiment and bring them away in the Parliaments ships, and that you may not
scruple at this action, we have sent you our Declaration, which will show open
the realityes of our intentions. Then for encouragement for the Officers and
Soldiers, I can assure you to have all arrears allowed in adventures, and that
we shall have very good pay for the time to come, I am so confident of your
coming that I have writ to the Parliament to make you Major General of the
forces that shall be now on foot here, which I believe will be no less then
10000 horse and foot, we have already 3000 of our own besides the expectation
of my own Regiments and yours; So that if they send but 2 or 3000 forth of
England, and order for the like number of Scots to come by sea hither we shall
make up that number. I have likewise sent to the Parliament to get a stipend
settled upon you as Governor of (Halboling) which I am confident will be done,
for that I hope these inducements calling you to a cause of comfortable, as we
may term it, Gods own cause, that will make all speed unto us, in expectation
whereof I remain

Your very affectionate Friend and servant, Inchiquin.

A Copy of a Letter to Lieutenant Coll. Saintleger.
Dear Brother.
WE find that his Majesty is strangely beguiled by the Irish rebels, who
making great and fair promises unto him, have gained such trust as that we see
the Kingdom, save what the Scots have, is to be left in their power, whereof
we know most certainly, they mean to make such use as that no English (if
Protestants) shall be left therein, for they resolve to leave no professors of
that Religion; But their wickedness will not stop there neither, for seeing
the King of England unable to give them assistance against the Scots; they have
employed agents abroad to treat with foreign Princes, and to give assurance
unto him that will undertake to supply them with money and utensils of war,
that they will become his subjects; when we were sufficiently assured of this,
we resolved to resume our arms and rather to dye gloriously, then to live
miferably; But although we know these actions of ours are effectual, condueing
to his Majesty's service; Yet we fear the instruments that gained favor for
the Irish, will have power to possess his Majesty with an ill opinion of our
proceedings, because we receive assistance from the Parliament of England,
notwithstanding (knowing the goodness of his Majesty's own disposition, and
hoping for Gods assistance to make him apprehensive of our real love to him)
we have presumed to write unto him, signifying how undoubtedly our Religion had
bin extinguished, and his Kingdom lost, if we had not prevented it, and
desiring that his Majesty would not only approve of the Parliaments sending us
supplies for the following of this war against the perfidious Irish rebels;
but that he would graciously reflect on us with what assistance his condition
will permit, and proclaiming the Irish Rebels; This if his Majesty approve of
may happily be a good recourse for such a treaty to be had between him and
the Parliament, as may produce a happy Accommodation, which may give them both
leave to employ the Armies now destructive to England against these malicious
enemies of our Religion, and most dangerous enemies of his; but if he do not,
our Consciences bear witness we intend nothing but loyalty to him, and we
hope this will appear when they see the grounds of our proceedings, which we
have partly set forth in a Declaration, though we have left out things that we
thought might displease his Majesty, who we know cannot choose but extend a
gracious eye of favor toward us, when things are come a little more to light,
and that the Villains of those Irish now smiled on shall be discovered; In the
mean time, I pray you Brother to consider, who we fight against, namely
Papists and Rebels, and that it is a happiness to be employed in such a
Quarrel, rather then against Protestants, whatever their Loyalties be, we are
sure we fight neither against the Kings Person nor Laws; neither against his
profit; but you are not sure there but that you fight against the two last,
neither do you know but that you fight against Religion, which Implicitly is
against God, and that sure you will confess to be more then doing the first.
Wherefore I beseech you to get away hither as soon as you can; And get what
Officers and Soldiers, especially W. Kingsmill to come with you; the best way
for you to come by, will be to come to Milford Haven, where the Parliament
shipping will take you in, and transport you hither, with what horse or foot,
you can get; There you will have good pay, halse your Arreares in Adventures;
and if God prosper our designs we shall surely possess the estates of our
enemies, with the comfort of having all our neighbors English and Protestants.
Your Mother has written to you carnestly desiring your repair hither, the
which she does with tears often pray that she may see; God put it into your
heart to obey her therein, which would exceedingly rejoice

Your most affectionate Brother and Servant, Inchiquin,
Cork, 21. July, 1644.
The Copy of a Letter from the right honorable the Lord Baron of Inchiquin to
Colonel William Iephson the Governor of Portsmouth.
ALthough I have been earnest in prosecution of all the Commands come unto me
from his Majesty; yet I was ever as industrious for the perservation of the
English here, and the Protestant Religion, as my weak abilities would give me
leave, and now that I perceive his Majesty to be so deluded by a Papisticall
Council, as that his Prorestant people are like to be all extirpated, and our
Religion extinguished; I confess it is no longer my duty to execute those
Commands, knowing them to proceed from the advice of those, who expose Religion
and the Commonwealth to shipwreck, under pretense of advancing his Majesty's
service, whilst indeed they do but contrive their own deliverance from the
hand of justice: The Bearer will tell you more of this, and of my resolutions
to use all endeavors to prosecute the war against the Rebels in Ireland, and
cross those who are more mischievous (then any Rebels can be) in England; and
if the Parliament do speedily supply us, I am very hopeful (with Gods
assistance) to put the work here suddenly into a good forwardness, for I am
consident my Brother Harry will (if he can) deliver Wareham again into the
hands of the Parliament, and will come away with my whole Regiment hither, when
you send Ships to fetch him, which I think will be greatly advantageous to
them there, and us here,

If notwithstanding my new Professions the Parliament should distrust me,
because it is true, I have served the King with all my power according to his
own commands, I shall in the first place let you know, that I forsake a
plentiful fortune, for the good of this Cause. And then I shall desire you to
say only to them that (if the placing of another person in my room be thought
an advantage for the prosecution of the war,) I shall be well-pleased with
it; and do most earnestly defire it; for truly no preferment or prosit can be
so pleasing to me, as to see this war followed with effect against the Irish
Rebels.

I found that having the disposal of what money we had here, I lost the favor
of many, because I could not comply with their particular desires, wherefore if
I should be thought fit to command again, I would by no means meddle with
that task, and shall in that case pray the Houses to send one or more
Commissioners to see the carriages of affairs, and to disburse the treasure as
shall be requisite. This Course I conceive will give much satisfaction both to
the Parliament and us, to them in regard of the assurance they shall have that
the money is employed to the best advantage, and that they shall have complaint
of none but real wants; to us, because we shall then expect to be better
supplied then otherwise.

Another thing that I desire you would offer to the Honorable Houses is, that
they would take the poor English here into their consideration, and to take a
course for their satisfaction, concerning those debts due unto them from the
Army, which I conceive may be done out of the Houses and Lands of the expulsed
inhabitants, as if their money had been given upon adventure for them; I could
write a volumne of things that would cause your admiration, as they have done
my Alteration from the course I was in, but I know you have been told some of
them by your Wife and P.S. and others you will hear from the bearer; wherefore
I will now say no more, but that I am

Your affectionate Friend and Servant, Inchiquin.
Cork 20. July. 1644.
A Copy of a Letter to Sir I. Powlet from the Lord Inchiquin.
Noble Sir,
AS I must confess I had always great inducements to love your person, so
must I acknowledge an obligation now, both to increase that affection, and
profess my self infinitely your servant, for I have it from many good hands,
that you were noble, just and friendly, zealous in defense of my honor, being
wounded very much by my Lord of Corks traducing me for betraying his Towns
unto the Irish rebels. Sir I could wish now that I had told you somewhat more
then I did of that business, which truly I forbear, because I thought it
would be deemed vain glory in me, for if ever I did any thing toward the
defense of this Province against the Irish, this was that I had cause to brag
off, whereof I shall take you for a witness; for you know that at the time
when the enemy came to Lismore we had no provisions in any of our stores; and a
week before their coming (that false friend) my uncle Edmond came unto me to
let me know, that the Irish Army were advancing toward our ports, and that if
I would give way to their taking of Cappoquin and Lismore they would spare the
rest of our quarters, which he said they would otherwise burn and destroy, but
before he delivered me this message from my Lord of Muskerie, he made me
promise him secrecy, which as I made good, so I made use of what he told me
for my own advantage, for presently I sent all the provision I could get in
Cork and Yawhall with all have to Cappoquin, and with it 400 commanded men,
Lismore was of it self well provided, but if it had not, you know I was not
then able to help it, at that time I communicated to your self and the
Officers the intelligence I received of the enemies advancing, and after advice
taken of what was fit to be done; we found our wants, and the scarcity that was
in all places, would make it impossible for us to keep the field with our.
Army, part whereof, to the number of 1200 were with Colonel Mynn in the West,
where they had no food, but what corn they cut, burnt and dressed the same day
to eat, so that all we were able to do was only to draw 1600 foot and 250
horse to Tallowe, out of the several garrisons, for whom I had not one days
victuals to march, they being only on billets in their several quarters;
when I found that this was all we could do, then I bethought my self to make
use of the motion made unto me by my uncle, and whereas he (under pretense of
giving me intelligence) went about to work upon me, in hope to make me an
instrument to betray the English, I did in the like manner endeavor to make
use of him, for the overthrowing the rebels design; Which with Gods
assistance I did thus happily effect.

After I had taken advice with you and found that we could not draw the
western forces unto us, and that without them there was no fighting; I seemed
to him to have put on a resolution with your advices presently to gather all
our forces together, and told him of a great strength that we were able to
make; letting of him know that I was glad the Irish were coming into a trap to
us, for that I knew there would none of them get off again, and then to fetch
him about, I told him that I was sorry that my Lord of Muskery was not more
real in his professions to the King, which I perceived were all but
dissilmuations, or that otherwise he would not now press so hard upon our
quarters, being he expected a cessation soon after, and being that then it was
professed by them that they would go into England with forces, so soon as
that was agreed on, I marvailed that they would be so much the Kings and their
own enemies as to seek the destruction of those people (meaning theirs) whose
assistance I did soon expect in his Majesty's service, which I told him was a
thing I would willingly avoid, if I could, and then finding by him that they
were resolved to come, notwithstanding all my threats, I told him that I would
not draw our forces together till such a day, if they aimed at nothing but my
Lord of Corks towns, for that I cared not if they took them, and that
therefore I had so ordered it that the forces should be there no sooner to
hinder them, which would be time enough for them to take them in; But said that
if they took them not by that day, that then they must resolve to retreat, or
that otherwise I must fall upon them, this they thought was enough, and
therefore they promised that they would retreat that day, whether they took
them or not, though with as little intention to perform as I expected. Now
that I might seem unto him to be able to do this, I presently made all the
noise I could of my resolution to fight with the enemies, and wrote unto all
the Garrisons to let the inhabitants know that if they did not make some shift
to furnish the Soldiers knapsacks for the field, that they were all lost,
whereupon they furnished us with five days provision, so that you and I made a
shift with the before mentioned number, to get thither by the day that I
threatened to fight with them, if they were not gone, which you know was the
soonest that I could be there; you being a witness of the diligence I used to
get the men into the field, and certainly if I could have come thither sooner,
I would have threatened the enemy accordingly, but when we were come to Tallow,
the rebels belike having notice of our weakness continued the seige
notwithstanding the promises, which I perceiving, and being fearful they
might take Lismore, offered unto your self, Lieutenant Colonel Appleyard and
the Officers, to fall upon them if you should advise, whereupon you all advised
to send presently for Colonel Mynn, and not to attempt any thing till he came.
This delay, after I had threatened to fight with them, I I was fearful would
make the enemy contemn us, and thinking that it was very likely that before
Colonel Mynn (who could not in less then five days time be with us) should
come that the place must needs have bin lost, I bethought my self to send Jack
fitz Gerald privately to them, to let them know that they were very happy in
that Mynn was not come yet unto me, and that I had received letters from him
intimating his being on his march toward me, whereof I gave them notice out of
my desire to preserve them whom we thought would soon become his Majesty's
Subjects and servants, and therefore let them know that if they did not go
away the next day, that I must of necessity fall upon them, but all I could do
could not divert them from their own ends, till my Lord of Cork landed and
brought me a Letter from the King commanding me to give credit to what he
should tell me, who told me that it was his Majesty's Command that I should
forward the Cossation by all the means? could, whereupon I desired a
Conference with my Lord of Muskerie, and you know how my Lord of Cork
delivered the Message sent unto me there before my Lord of Muskerie, and did
assure my Lord that if he would withdraw the siege, he knew his Majesty would
take it well, which my Lord (thinking that I would have fallen upon them the
next day) assented unto, now let the world judge whether I did intend to give
up my Lord of Corks Towns, they knowing our wants, our condition, our strength,
Nick Mynns being in the West unable to come to us, my offering daily to fall
on, if a Council of war should advise it, and all other circumstances to be
as I have related, and let them also that know how we were, say if it had not
been easy for their 3000 foot, and 800 horse to have taken all our Quarters,
if I had not by this means prevented it, by giving them occasion to stay where
I had provided against their attempts, whereas if they had marched on in to our
Quarters, I could never make head against them, knowing the Country to be
ready to rise and afford them their assistance against us, and that we could
never bring our Army into a body to have given them Battle, so that truly I
never was so happy in any thing concerning this war, as in that diversion,
which (by my Uncle Edmonds and my Lord of Muskeries ambush) it pleased God I
gave them, and thereby preserved all the poor English that were abroad in our
quarters: and Sin for confirmation hereof you know we were frequently told that
it was a common report amongst the Irish that I had fooled my Lord of Muskerie,
and he them; then let all the world think whether I could be so foolish as to
give way that so many of them should know such a secret, if I had not my own
ends in it, or if those ends had been to favor them, whether that favor must
not proceed from hope of reward, of effection to their party; the first of
these I am confident no enemis will allege against me; And I hope my Actions
have never given Cause to suspect, me for the last; perhaps my Lord of Cork
will say I did it out of malice to him: to which I answer, that it were
strange I should put my safety into the hands of the Irish, only to do him a
prejudice, who I knew durst not affront me, not any man that durst strike a
known Coward unless I did intend to become one of the Irish party, which
sure now I shall not be suspected for, s^eing I have put on a resolution to
follow the war against the Irishe whereunto my self, and the rest of the
Officers here have been induced by the certain knowledge of their designs,
being no loss (then to extirpate all the Protestant and their Religion, and
give* this Kingdoms into the hands of another Prince, who they think betten
able to assist them against the Parliament then the King of England is; Sir, we
have made this known to the King and the world in a large Declaration; but we
fear that the same instruments that gained such trust for the Irish (as that
the King condescended to leave this in their power, supposing them to be more
faithful to him then that they would do any such thing) will also prevail to
make him discredit our Declaration, and disapprove of our proceedings, which
yet shall appear to be effectual for his service: But because we knew that
his Majesty (by reason of the Parliaments strength at sea could not assist
us,) we have applied our selves to the Parliament, also desiring their
Assistance against the Irish, and have besought both King and Parliament that
they would (from the knowledge of their treacheries) take a rise to beget such
an Accommodation, as that by their joint consent this war might be followed,
and that in England may surcease. I know not what effects this may produce for
the good of that Kingdom. But I know we shall have large supplies here, and
good pay for 10000. horse and foot to keep the field, and that it may be an
encouragement for our old friends to come over to us again, the Parliament do
undertake to pay the Arreares due unto all the Officers and us in so much
Adventure; besides which there is no doubt (if God make us vanquishers) but
deserving 01 men will have estates conferred on them in the end of this, as it
was in the end of the last wars (I mean Tyrones wars) of Ireland; I should
think it a great happiness that I might have your Assistance in this
business, promising you that (if it lie in my power) your condition shall be
one of the Chief in the Army; but I know your Nobleness and Uprightness to
be such as that I shall offer nothing as an inducement to you, but that here
you may fight in a Cause which first is Gods own, then that we fight against
those who are Papists and Rebels, and who we know to be enemies to the King and
our Religion: And lastly, I would desire you to consider that if the King
should get the upper hand with the help of these men, whether it be likely that
it will be in his power to establish the Protestant Religion: if you think fit
to come, you must not make known your Resolution till you see how the King
approves of our Declaration; But if that be not come to his hands, I would
advise you to come without the knowledge of any (but such as you think will
come with you) to Milford Haven, where the Parliament shipping will receive
you, and transport hither any that desire to come: I pray God direct you for
the best, which is heartily wished by, Sir,

Your most affectionate Friend and Servant, Inchiquin.

FINIS.
