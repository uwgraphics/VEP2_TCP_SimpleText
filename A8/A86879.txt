The Humble Tender and Declaration of many well-affected Mariners and Seamen,
Commanders of Ships, Members of the Trinity-house, to the Commissioners of the
Navy.
IT is humbly offered by us whose names are here under, being Mariners and
Seamen, that there may be forthwith a Petition drawn in behalf of Seamen and
Mariners, and presented to the two Houses of Parliament, wherein our humble
desires may be represented for a Personal Treaty with His MAJESTY, as the
only remedy for the present distempers of this distressed Kingdom, and the
reducing of the Shipping revolted from their trust, and that it is humbly
conceived by us that we are obliged and bound according to the Protestation and
Solemn League and Covenant formerly taken by every of us to maintain and
defend with our lives, powers and estates, the true Reformed Protestant
Religion, His Majesty's Royal Person, Honor and Estate, and also the Power
and Privileges of Parliament. And we do further declare, That if it shall
appear that any of these revolted Ships shall endeavor to impede or hinder
the Kings Personal Treaty with His two Houses of Parliament, that we will
unanimously endeavor with our lives and fortunes to bring them to condign
punishment, according to our Covenant, and Protestation, formerly taken as
aforesaid.
