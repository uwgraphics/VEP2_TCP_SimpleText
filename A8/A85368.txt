A GOOD WISH FOR ENGLAND, OR ENGLAND'S Lord deliver us, From all ills as you
shall see,
To the State distempers be,
Buy and read, or sing with me,
Libera nos Domine.

To the tune of a Dirge.
1.
FRom them which do their hands with guilt imbrue,
From those which would deprive the King of's due,
And from their erours who think all things true,
Libera nos Domine.
2.
From those that would our British I Will betray,
From them that wish our King and States decay,
From all bad causes that are gone away,
Libera nos Domine.
3.
From he whose weakness makes him such a wigeon,
To join with many factions in this Region,
Who love a sect better then true Religion,
Libera nos Domine.
4.
From those indifferent men that know no Guide,
Who are from their allegiance so wide,
That come what will they will take the strongest side,
Libera nos Domine.
5.
From those that dare work ill in every season,
And are so far from sanctity or reason,
They dare believe there is piety in treason,
Libera nos Domine.
6.
From him whose heart all wholesome law rejects,
From superstition which to hell directs,
From the poor Scholars eight and twenty sects,
Libera nos Domine.
7.
From all dissembling separatists, and those
That snuffle their unlearned zeal in prose,
Af if the way to Heaven were through the nose,
Libera nos Domine.
8.
From those light wenches that hate Katherine Stubs,
And give her holy life scandalous rubs,
But from the Doctrine that is taught in Tubs,
Libera nos Domine.
9.
From him that shall desire another Pattin,
That may maintain his falshoodship in Satin,
From he that hates an Organ and true Latten,
Libera nos Domine.
10.
From him who for his own good never strives,
From him that often spends, and seldom thrives,
Those that love wenches better then their wives,
Libera nos Domine.
11.
From those that seek fair verity to plunge her,
Who with low complement can give the Bonjure,
From Papist-priests that can both preach and conjure,
Libera nos Domine.
12.
From him that listens to a Papists wish,
Who mixeth his religion in his dish,
And calls it fasting when he feeds on Fish,
Libera nos Domine.
13.
And from that sect, I mean that den of Thieves,
Who to contemn the mass, the maker grieves,
With their Good-friday-feasts, and Vigill eves,
Libera nos Domine.
14.
From them which nothing but false rumors rear,
And likewise those which lend such men an ear,
Who publish for a truth all which they hear,
Libera nos Domine.
15.
From those whose subtle flattery extends
Not to our good, but their own private ends,
From foes that come like reconciled friends,
Libera nos Domine.
16.
Next from all Parasites and fauning minions;
From Papists, Brownists, and the rank Arminians,
That thus disturb the State with strange opinions,
Libera nos Domine.
17.
From such a factious crew whose discontent,
Expect at last to see a bad event,
Of Royal CHARLES and this blessed Parliament,
Libera nos Domine.
18,
From selling, or from morgaging of Lands,
From turning over goods in others hands,
And from the setting of our marks to Bands,
Libera nos Domine.
19.
From cruelty, that keeps good men in aw,
From Sergeants, and such Griffins of the Law,
And from the chattering of a Guild Hall daw,
Libera nos Domine.
20.
From living at a miserable rate,
In Prison, where all people are ingrate,
And from the Porters at the Counter Gate,
Libera nos Domine.
21.
From being hurried in with cruel gripes,
By an old cursed Catchpole they call Tripes,
From paying for our Candles and our Pipes,
Libera nos Domine.
22.
Next from the Stocks, the hole, and little ease,
(Sad places which kind Nature much displease)
And from the rattling of the Keepers Keys,
Libera nos Domine.
23.
From these and many tedious distractions,
And from innumerable more exactions,
From nonsuiting, or bayling of fobb'd Actions,
Libera nos Domine.
24.
If any here our Libera nos do pinch,
Were he as great as Windibanck or Finch,
Our Author bids me, let the galled jade winch,
Libera nos Domine,
FINIS.
Printed at London, 1641.
