Joyful News from Sea, Manifesting to the whole Kingdom the wonderful work
of God, in delivering those that are Traitors to the true Catholic and
Protestant Religion unto the hands of us his faithful servants, etc.
MY Lord of Warwick (m^st like ^imselfe) careful and faithful ^n his
undertaken Office, fea^ing ^he malicious intentions of foreign Nations, who
daily strive to foot themselves in the heart of this Kingdom, and to undermine
the whole Land with their Popish inventions) sent and scattered many of his
best Ships unto several nooks and arms of the narrow Seas, two whereof, by
name the Black Martine, and the Royal Lion, losing themselves from the rest of
their fellows, coming some what near the Irish s^^^e, met with five other
ships half a Leagues distance from them which were coming from Spain, and
going either (as it was thought) with Ammunition, and Money to ref^esh and
relieve the Rebels in Ireland, or else sailing toward England, here to egg
and encourage on a Civil dissension, but our two ships perceiving their Flag
to be unsuitable to ou^s, and greatly suspecting they had some bad intentions
immediately discharged a warning piece, they relying on their number being 5.
to two, would not veil bonnet to ours, resolved to try it out; our men on the
other side depending on God (who is still helpful and assistant unto all those
that rely on him) gave them an encounter, and being very hot in Battle
immediately did sink two of their best ships, but one of ours (namely the black
Martine) being mightily pestred and bruised, was (not long after) sunk; likewise
the Royal Lion in the interim (although wounded) did so bravely belabour the
other three Spanish ships, that they were quickly feign to yield and surrender
up all they had for the safety of their lives; for our men having drove them
somewhat near the shore, had present assistance by Merchants voyaging those
ways; there were false Decks in one of the Spanish ships, by which many of our
men were like to suffer, but having boarded her, there was a great sum of money
found therein, which did near upon amount to three hundred thousand pound, the
other two ships were extraordinary fraught with all manner of Warlike
A^^^nitions, especia^^y Muskets, ^ikes, half (...), Calivers, Dragoones,
Swords, Armor for Horsemen and foot, Pistolls, the particular sums of all
which will more plainly appear in the ensuing lines.

Muskets 500 Swords 507 Pikes and half Pikes. 813 Dragoones. 99 Armor for
horse and foot. 150 Pistole 200 Calivers 76 Ordnance pieces and murderers 53
As for their number of men they did not fully amount to four hundred, who were
all brought with their Ammunition to my Lord of Warwick, and being strictly
examined by him, were found in many contrary Tales, upon which my Lord
immediately sent tidings thereof to both Houses of Parliament, to inform them
what he had done, what Am^unition he had received by those said Ships, and how
the Black Martine was sunk in the enterprise, by which many of our men were
shipwrackt.

A true relation of Prince Robert his arrival to England the mischance that
befell him coming, what forces and ammunition were brought with him, and his
welcome to his Uncle our sacred King.
PRince Robert in the midst of his voyage for England, was chased by two or
three of my Lord of Warwicks ships, which indeed was ignorantly done, in
respect it was not known what ships they were, where the Prince was from
whence they came, whither they went, not upon what occasion; But having
narrowly escaped, the Prince landed at Dover with a matter of two hundred men or
upward, well moneyed, the sum (amounting to above 100000 pounds) that he
carried with him with some other martial ammunition, for the young Prince
having intelligence that England was like to be in an uprore, and that the King
(his Uncle) did in some way stand in defect of men and money, brought with him
the greatest store he possible could make shift for, the Ammunition he had was
but little, of which most were swords and pistolls, with a few pikes, all did
not amount to the number of an hundred and fifty, with six pieces of Ordnance
and 14 horses, one of which fourteen Prince Robert himself did ride upon, the
horse being somewhat wild, and the Prince desirous with all speed to hasten to
the Kings Majesty his Uncle, set his horse so to it, that ere he came three
miles from Dover he had a most dangerous fall, so that his sho^lder the^eby was
put out of joint, and his arm extraordinarily sprained, but a Surgeon was
quickly sent for, and a bone-setter, who by their vigilant industry soon made
whole all those grieved parts, the Prince in such eagerness to see his uncle,
took no more respite than three or four days, but that immediately he took
horse again, and riding toward York, had intelligence by the way, that the
Kings Majesty was departed the^e hence to one Sir Thomas Lees, inhabiting
within four miles of Coventry, so that the Prince was feign to return
thither, no sooner had our Kings Majesty intelligence of his coming, but that
he went (accompanied with some of the Cavalliers) to meet him, who, when he
met, he courteously embraced in his arms, and thanked him for that kindness.

There is a ship well fraught with Ammunition and money that was intended for
Portsmouth, but being shroudly chased by some of my Lord of Warwickes
Commanders, was driven to Southampton, and is there now taken, the money and
Ammunition is by my Lords command brought here to London.
