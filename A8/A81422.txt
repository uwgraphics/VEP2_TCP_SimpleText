Young Man. Who told thee so? To Christ for Help I Will call.

I am resolved, and in this Mind I Will stand,

Which, that I may, thy Help, Oh Christ, command.

Lord, here is my Heart, it is thine, take it to guard,

Give it thy Grace, and then thy Gift reward.

Lord, I am thine, and for thee I was born,

Lord, I am thine, and to thee I am sworn.

Awake, my Soul, what meanst thou still to stay,

God calls, Christ woe's, make haste, make haste away*
