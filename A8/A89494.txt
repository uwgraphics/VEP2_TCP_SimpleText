A SOVEREIGN SALVE TO CVRE THE BLIND. OR, A Vindication of the Power and
Privileges claimed or executed by the LORDS and COMMONS in PARLIAMENT, from
the Calumny and Slanders of men, whose eyes (their Conscience being before
blinded) ignorance or malice has hoodwinckt. Wherein the fallacy and falsity
of the Anti-parliamentary party is discovered, their plots for introducing
Popery into the CHURCH and Tyranny into the STATE are manifested: The pretended
fears of danger from Seperatists, Brownists, etc. blown away. And a right way
proposed for the advancing the just Honor of the King, the due reverence of
the Clergy, the Rights and Liberty of the people: and the renewing a GOLDEN
AGE. By J. M. Esquire.

Salus populi est Lex suprema.
Salus Parliamenti supremum privilegium.
LONDON: Printed by T. P. and M. S. 1643.

REader, if thou expectest here a polite style or fluent phrase, thou will be
deceived in thy expectation: it is not Rhetoric but reason can satisfy the
judgment (which this Author intended) the former may cozen the conscience, and
dazzle simple men: the latter only can satisfy the Wise, and lead to truth. A
rough Diamond is precious, when the best wrought glass is despicable; the
painted Oratory (which best pleases the vulgar) ill suits with the well
becoming gravity of a Statist. The right stating of many questions in the
ensuing Treatise has necessitated the dilating of some sentences more then may
stand with a pleasing style: yet it is not doubted but the lovers of Truth will
find that performed which is promised. Farewell.

SO many excellent Treatises as have been sent abroad to unblind the hoodwinkt
world, and all clearing this truth (That the Parliament is and ought to be
supreme Judge) might make this seem needless, but as for a sturdy sore, many
plasters are but sufficient; so will it not be misspent time by the clear
demonstrations of truth and right reason to beat down that wall of the
too-much-loved-ignorance which hitherto has kept the divine light of the truth
from entering into the dark (and therefore miserable) souls of those deluded ones
who with so much earnestness lay out their estates, expose their families to a
thousand miseries, nay spend even their dearest blood to inslave themselves and
posterity. Love and duty to religion and my country, now flaming with the fire
these men have kindled, and yet give fuel to, yea even pity to these men has
enforced a pen ever before still to expose it self to public censure, and if
by this poor labor of mine any of these ignorantly erring men may be reduced,
I have my end; as for those who enraged with malice willingly oppose the truth,
God has provided her another champion, even the sword, to vindicate her self
from the violence of those men on whom the power of reason has no effect.

To attain this our end, what readier way have we then 1. To discover the
falsity of those pretenses by which those men are deluded, the miseries they
bring themselves and posterity into if they yet persist: 2. To discover the way
to regain our now almost lost liberty and religion: 3. To free us from the
pretended fears of the invasion of our liberty by the Parliament, or of our
religion by Brownists, Anabaptists, and the like. And here so many of these men
who hitherto through ignorance, passion and mistake have been enemies to the
Parliament, and in them to their religion, country, and themselves, I say so
many of these as by Gods providence this little Treatise shall com unto, are
wished out of due care and love to the Protestant Religion so desperately
undermined by Jesuiticall plots, out of love to their poor country, laws and
liberty, now at the last gasp as it were either to stand or fall, out of pity
to themselves and their posterity, designed even to Turkish slavery, they would
lay aside all prejudicate thoughts, and seriously lay to heart the evidences of
truth, love, and labor to defend it wheresoever they find it: and in hopes
they will do this, I will proceed according to the method proposed, which was
first to discover the deceit of that sophistry by which these truth-haters
delude their followers and to clear the proceedings of the Parliament from all
aspersions of wrong or injustice: but because their arts of deceiving are many,
and it would require too much time to answer particulars, therefore I shall
endeavor to draw them to some few generals. The first then we have to deal
withal is this, The sovereign power claimed by the Lords and Commons in
Parliament to provide for the Kingdoms safety is an intrenching on His
Majesty's just Rights, and contrary to the known Laws, say those deceivers.
To answer this, and in this the whole bulk of their objections against the
Parliament, I shall first propose this to your consideration: Whether if the
King having his royal name and authority abused by those about him, or misled
by his own passion or mistake, do command and act things pernicious and
destructive to the people, religion, liberty and laws, contrary to the end and
trust of the first institutors of this Monarchy, and to the contract at his
coronation, and convert the power of the people it self to back and carry on
those designs, refusing to hearken to the petitions of his people, or
Remonstrances of the great Council of the Kingdom (if in this case the people
be remediless) consider whether the condition of a free nation be not worse
then that of a most miserable slave, and whether the framers of this Monarchy
have not provided better for the means, then for the end it self, the peoples
welfare, which is the end of all government. For first, being before in a free
and happy estate every way, it must bring it self into servitude, and each man
make one another mutually, and those he holds dearest, and his Country it self
slaves, and must expose his own life, that he may take the lives of whosoever
refuses slavery. Secondly, besides thus each man being one another mutually,
and all their countries executioners, each must be bound to expose all he has,
and his life as much as In him lies, to procure or advance the means of
damnation of those he holds dearest, nay of innumerable others, and of himself
(Religion being part of the case.) Thus whereas it seems sufficient to the
constitution of a slave, not to have power to dispose of himself, or of what he
has in a passive way only, in this case men must be positively active against
themselves.

Thirdly and lastly, a whole Nation cannot fly, or run away from a condition so
miserable, and by any other means unavoidable, as a particular slave may.

More might be said in this point, but what needed thus much, were not their
Judgments with whom we deal as turbu^ent as the waters they have troubled;
which sort a possibility of delusion, that yet may partly hoodwinke them, must
distinguish from the other part among them, whom malice has made utterly
reason, and religion proof; and therefore their senses, whose souls seem
nothing else, are to be dealt with in another method.

But to the point; the premises and consequence being utterly absurd,
inconsistent, contradictory, against reason and nature, Princes being
instituted for the peoples happiness, and so rather publici servi, as regnum
splendida servitus: and since there is provision against the danger of the
minority of a Prince, who can be only positively ill, it being a fortiori
reasonable, that it should not be wanting against the peril from such a
Prince, as we propound, who by means of a greater maturitie and authority,
may concur more actively, and consequently more perniciously to the greatest
evil, the people in our case, if or when the King makes such attempts in
reason cannot be without means of remedy. It were perhaps so were a King
instituted in an immediate miraculous extraordinary manner by God himself,
then a lower power could not disanull the act of the higher; or perhaps there
were color, if the people it self had absolutely given or entrusted it self
to the power or Provision of the Prince at the first institution, or framing of
the Monarchy. But with us the laws, customs, privileges, power, and use of
Parliaments etc. argue, or rather are limitations, restrictions, conditions, or
reservations made upon the original trust, commission, or delegation from the
people, or after upon occasion, which it keeps in its own power, or reserves
to it self, as the supreme resort for extraordinary emergents. Nor let any
think that the King having taken his oath for the keeping himself within his
bounds, or for the observing the laws, liberties, privileges, or the like,
that he is hereupon only left to God and his conscience, and the people
without humane remedy, if he exorbitate; for they ought not to presume, but to
prove strongly (if they could) this, which were for the disadvantage of the
people so mainely, for whose good all was intended at the first institution of
the Monarchy; and the peoples happiness ought to be rather favored and
preferred in the interpretation of a doubtful matter (were this such) as
assuredly according with the first institutors intention: and I think it is
not so apparent (if it be apparent at all) that the King is so left to God
only, as it is that the safety and happiness of the people is L^x suprema, and
the end of all, which is out of doubt; and therefore by this tie of an oath,
and all other sitting ties, power, and means also intended to be procured, and
secured; and all often little enough (though such power is unless upon
necessity not only not to be exercised, but also to be kept as secret, as may
be, that the Princes authority in as much as it may make for the good of the
people, may be kept up.) And perhaps the oath the people has taken to the
King, especially as the people is represented in Parliament, may (respecting at
this time this reason only) infer as well on the peoples side, that it is
left to God only thereupon, and so supreme in point of judgment and power:
but allowing, or rather understanding truly such power to be in the people, and
from it in the Parliament (as hereafter may further appear we are to do) is
not this way the peoples liberty, rights, happiness, safer and better assured,
together with the Kings just power or prerogative, since the Parliament is not
capable (could it be willing) to usurp upon either (as after may be showed)
then imagining such supreme power to be invested in the King, either the
peoples right or the Kings just power it self can be; seeing no man will deny
but Kings are subjects capable of arbitrary or tyrannical power often times
willing and giving the attempt, and sometimes actually prevailing. So, if the
framers of this Monarchy had intended such paramount power should be still in
the King; and that in such extraordinary emergents as now appear in England,
they had been more solicitous of, and provided better far for one means of
diverse ordained to an end, then for the very end it self, the peoples
happiness, which they had left still depending dangerously on one man's
conscience, or will, as it should at any time happen to change, when so ^ure
and safe a provision offered it self elsewhere, (as before is pa^^^y touched)
and had preferred the means before the end: and so do all the desperate
malignants, and the disorderers of our times and State, which is retrograde to
reason: others may better enforce this point touching the intent of the first
institution, and add express authorities perhaps out of the Laws to this
end, or the practice of Parliaments in such times (if such have ever before
been) or otherwise proceed by analogy and good consequences of reason.

If it be said, that by such a provision of remedy for the people in danger,
as abovesaid, a dangerous president of disobeying, and weakening the Ki^gs
authority is introduced, which may work even danger of dissolution of the
Monarchy. Admitting but not granting, that upon such a president, once made,
upon an extraordinary cause, and that by an orderly way (and which once done
may well prevent all future need of making any more such presidents) admit such
a danger even to the Monarchy followed thereupon (which yet will not be made
good in our present case, as after will appear) then here now is the point.
Among diverse forms of government, whereby a people may be governed, that it may
be happy, which is the end and aim of every such form, this Nation chose one
particular one, which it judged fittest to compass that end (as indeed
Monarchy duly tempered is the best, but distempered by tyranny the worst, the
advantage of union, or unitive power, which it has above other forms
strengthening to evil, when it degenerates, as it did to good, whilst it
stood incorrupt) but if this objection were of weight it would follow, that it
were more rational, that the peoples felicity, which is the supreme end, to
which all good forms of government are ordained and tend, should rather suffer,
then a particular form or fashion of government, of which there are choice, and
any of which are but one means, or way to compass that end if it continue
incorrupt, but if corrupted to destroy the end: and so one means to the end,
nay in our case a means if not rectified wholly to frustrate the end, should
be preferred before the end it self, which it ought only to serve, nor can it
be said the remedy were worse then the disease; for what remedy can be so
ill, as that disease; a free, a glorious, a nob^e Nation to fall to servitude
spiritual and temporal from a long enjoyed Liberty in both kinds, and our
selves the instruments? though to go on in such a case, the remedy might not
prove so ill, or difficult, if men would pay obedi^^^ ^^uely there where reason
tells them they owe it; And should ^^ere be no such remedy for the people, or
^or conservation of the frame of the government the constitution of this
Monarchy, which the King declares he admireth so much, were most deficient in
the most principal point of all, namely, the defending and preserving it
self, the very foundation and groundwork, as the end of all, otherwise
provisions orders, Laws, without which what were they but folly and fantasy?
Nay were not the folly of the first institution rather to be as much admired
(as raising an instrument utterly unfit for the purpose it was meant for: had
it left the maine end of all, that is, the peoples safety, liberty,
happiness in such a case as ours, without all possible, nay without any
provision express or employed by common intendment, or analogy of reason, or
rule of Law, though the true, the natural, the best, or the only provision,
or remedy to keep Prince and people in their due temper, were so at hand, so
facile, so offering it self, and if not before usual, yet used possibly at the
very time of such an institution, and for that very purpose, namely, a
Parliament or other meeting of the like nature, without provision, I say,
against the greatest public mischief of all, that ultimum malum Reipublicae
(as divine Plato terms it) arbitrary power, or tyranny, and that a mischief,
so likely to happen; more, so often attempted, nay actually happening. But he
that implores force (not now to speak of what is pretended herein by words) and
that though but to resist the orders of that power, whose part alone it is to
remedy the people in our case, does in fact deny that this Monarchy has made
such provision, or has that power so necessary to help and defend it self, or
that the people in this case is remediable, for by such having recourse to
force or war, though but defensive, he challenges and assumeth all the power
from the people to himself, making himself supreme Judge of all upon the last
resort, of which somewhat more shortly. But the King cannot be so in our
present case, in which he is a party in as much as the evil proceeds from ill
counsel prevailing with him; For to bring the hypothesis to a Thesis, and not
to stand always on supposition taking it as a supposition) that a king seduced
may, de facto, make such attempts as are above put, it is more evident of it
self then that we need look on the fall of Liberty in France; if not from the
King, nor Counsel, about him consequently, then whence is the remedy for our
loss? from the Judges? what ever their will may be they want power, a^^
^^twithstanding they still were present the mischief grew on: (...) be then
from the two Houses of Parliament only (unless you would have the whole
Nation assemble personally, as in the Vale of Jehosaphat, if you suppose it
possible, and if possible fit for any thing but confusion, except perhaps
force) the king having (to speak with what reverence we can) in this case
excluded himself, and the Clergy justly being excluded, from such temporal
distractions, that it may attend the better and advance the celestial, and
ecclesiastic, more then enough to take up the ablest men wholly, and not a
little hindered and discredited by their so great greediness after worldly
matters: let them do their duty, let them teach truly, live exemplarily, like
professors of mortification, this will render the people so devoted to
religion, to them, that they may securely trust the Parliament with all that
touches them, and safely make it their proxy, themselves being absent; and
whilst thus spiritual matters are the better served and attended, these, and
the temporal both receive the greater blessing: but such diffidence and
suspicion in the Clergy (if it should not be present in Parliament) argues ill
deserving, since the justice and wisdom of the Parliament, as principles of
this government ought not to be questioned: but how much more is the Clergy to
receive at the hands of the Parliament, that fuora, i. preti, i. e. Priests
void the room, used by that Council in Venice, of which Bodin in the third
book De republica, the 3. Chapter, then, when they shall be found in life and
doctrine unsound, ill affected to the public good, accessarie to the evil to
be remedied, nay ardent to bring in, or maintain either Papistry, and
idolatry, or at least a most scandalous symbolizing with it in temporal
pride, riches and greatness, and even Antichristian domination through the
breaches and ruins of their Country, rather then even a Parliament shall
question it. The Parliament then, and under this notion of the two Houses in
these times understood, being our only remedy, or rather Physician, it
follows it may and is to be Judge of the danger or disease, and that of power
which is to remedy if it be so, is to try whether it be so; for without
judgment or knowledge of the disease how can there be remedy? or how shall
the Physician know, what, when and how to apply? If it be the only competent
Judge of this our dangerous disease, and of the means to meet with, or expel
it (the knowledge of the remedy depending essentially upon the knowledge of
the Malady, and receiving thence its Judications) it has consequently power
to execute, or act, or cause to be executed or acted, what it has, or shall
judge or ordain necessary for the cure, else such power to judge were vain, and
it would still return that the people were remediless. But WISDOM or Judgment
and POWER, as they are divine coincidents, and all one really and naturally
where they are supreme, and essential as in the Divine nature, it being but
our weakness of understanding to conceive them disjoined so (for principles of
one faculty questioned are to be enforced from an higher faculty) even in
this supreme power on earth (which as far as frail mortality can bear
imitates, and represents that above) they ought not to be by us apprehended
separate, but mutually presupposing or inferring one the other. Let us add to
make up this terrestiall trinity; Goodness, which last may be understood in
our present case, a doing no unjust, or dishonorable thing, but wholly
intending the public good, according to the peoples trust. And it were an arch
heresy in the policy of this Monarchy to disjoyn in our belief or opinion, the
third from the two former. And the Law saying, no dishonorable thing is to be
conceived of the Parliament, it seems all one as to have said in other terms,
that it is the supreme Judge of the last resort (and that even without the
king, if he has excluded himself as above, which is more then if he were far
personally absent, or otherwise casually disenabled, and as much as if no king
at all were for the time) where all appeals are to rest, and determine, all men
to acquiesse, binding all from questioning what is there done; and inferres the
supreme power there to reside, as being the whole kingdom (in which it is
radically and fundamentally by representation: such power to be exerted and
used, when it judges necessary, and that (if the nature of the occasion so
requires) with the suspension of the power of the supreme, ordinary Delegate,
or Magistrate, during that parenthesis of state; for the kingdom having
entrusted the Parliament with all it holds precious, the effect of the
Commission upon the matter being, that it provide ne quid respublica detrimenti
capiat, it has consequently trusted it with its power, which is the supreme,
that it may be enabled to perform and execute the trust, when it judges, this
cannot be made good, without using that power. But to return; the Law says
also, That the King can do, or does no wrong* but it denies not, but ill
Counsel about him may: or perhaps the Law intends the king as he is in his
great Counsel, where he is as Sol in Leone, or any Planet (as they say) in his
proper house; of far greater virtue and power, then otherwise. But however,
Reason tells us, that a Prince or a few of his Cabinet counsel, may far more
easily err in judgment, or possibly in point of will, then the multitude of a
Parliament (so many whereof are selected out of the whole Kingdom by the
people) in point of Judgment, much more of will, or well willing to the
public (whereof themselves are so great a part): and this much the rather, in
that it is to be feared, that oftentimes, those privadoes of the Prince,
finding out cunningly the Princes will, inclination, or humor, before they
advise, and, further to ingratiate themselves, seconding it, much that there is
agitated, becomes to be upon the matter the judgment or will but of the Prince
alone.

Well, I hope we are now come safe to this pass, that the Parliament may and
ought in our case to defend the people, or kingdoms rights, use the peoples
power which is the supreme, (as others have proved to clear passionate men,
rather then to satisfy any judicious man, who will not require proofs in a
point plain enough of it self) ever resident in the people, and so in the
Parliament, though dormient, till it be by the Parliament thought fit to be
wakened, which should it not now be done, such a seeming-secure, and supine
sleep might have proved a mortal lethargy. But here these Sophisters think to
enter upon us, and to take the benefit of their own wrong; for seeing they have
brought the Kingdom to this pass, that unless the Parliament take the power
of the kingdom into the kingdoms or its own hands, it cannot defend it self, or
the kingdoms rights, or rather rescue them; they would cunningly prepare those,
whom they intend to make slaves, by first making them such fools, as to
believe, that the Parliament intends a change of the Monarchical form of
government, and to oppress King and people by I know not what new kind of
Arbitrarie tyrannical government. I believe the King and Parliament will soon
be attoned, if any can show the Parliament by what other way it can discharge
its trust and duty in this constitution of the times, without the power it
has assumed But what if it shall appear (I should make scruple to use the word
shall, as if it did not appear already without these weak offers, had we not
to do with such as seem to have found out some new kind of reason, or having
antiquated the old, which differenced man from irrational creatures, to have
substituted passion, or idle fantasy in the room of it; the best method
indeed for them afterward on as good or the same proportion of reason, to
advance the power of the King into the place of the power of the whole people
or Kingdom; it is their own manner of speech and practice as sound and good as
their own Method, to make such distinction and difference betwixt King and
kingdom) what if it shall appear, time bringing every day truth to light, and
perhaps even to there men some dilucida intervalla, that there is not the least
probability, that the Parliament can have such a thought of usurpation, as
these men would impose or seem to suppose; much less was it ever heard that
any free Parliament, actually made any the least attempt to that effect, so far
is it, that ever it effected it: Whereas on the other side, ill Counsel about
Princes have attempted often, and de facto, sometimes performed the turning of a
well poysed or tempered Monarchy, into an arbitrarie tyrannical power and
public oppression; by which change, such ill instruments appear the only
gainers; and the malignant spleen swells in a miserable consumed body, the head
not exempt, and yet the very swelling a dangerous disease even to the spleen it
self at last. Unless such monstrous times did privilege, it were high
presumption to think it were not all sufficient to stop such mouths to say it
is a Parliament, and it were dishonorable for it to do as they calumniate, and
therefore not to be imagined. This maxim or ground being no more to be denied,
or questioned in this Monarchy, then that the earth is round in natural
Philosophy, as near as morrall Philosophy may arrive at natural in point of
certitude: though should we grant them that a Parliament may err, nay do wrong
to Prince, people, or particulars, yet that would not follow upon this which
they would maliciously infer, and aim at; for none but it self, or another
Parliament were to correct, or rectify what a Parliament should have done
amiss, and not the King or any other persons any way whatsoever, much less by
force or war: for he that is allowed to judge or correct, is allowed thereby
at least an equal (if equality for such an intent can be conceived sufficient
possibly): but such equality of power in two distinct Magistrates (for so we
must distinguish King and Parliament here) of different natures, and touching
one and the same point or matter in controversy, cannot be in one and the same
state, then such a corrector must be allowed superior and the corrected
subordinate, but such the King cannot be in our case, as above is partly
showed, and shall be further afterward. How then can force or war on his
side for this cause be rational, and just? nay though it should be but
defensive, much less if offensive, or inferred? Since even bare resisting the
ordinances of the Parliament, is or presupposes an assuming of the supreme
power to judge and condemn, such resistance being the execution of the
sentence.

But we shall not carry it away so easily that the Parliament will not be
unjust to any, holding such power, strong temptations of profit corrupt: too
often, where one, or a few are ordinary Judges; as a little water standing sooner
is putrified, but multitude of these Judges are like the Sea incorruptible: But
moneys received, profits and emoluments accrewing, (it were a shame not without
a certain mixture of presumption to insist on such base imputations here, had
not frontlesse and monstrous malice been so incredibly audacious, as actually
to raise them) may make a dividend sufficient to draw to some unjust act each
man or the mayor part of such a multitude, very likely; and to draw the more
matter of profit, we see how by frequent orders they invite private causes; and
do they give any public account of the moneys they receive from the people,
more then the Malignants could have done for Ship Money? But we err; they give
public account: but it is to get credit only with the people, that they may
be in their sinister practices and machinations the less suspected, and better
served: But stay; how can they have ill ends at all on foot or in agitation,
since of all their particular actions and proceedings, of most moment, from
time to time, they by their Declarations, or the like, give no less then of
the moneys an account to the world, except they be evident of themselves?
Should they do that they cannot give reason for, but such malicious vigilance,
as we deal with, when it might in particulars charge them, and article against
them upon truths, would never be driven to the base and miserable shifts of
these generals, and the like most ridiculous impudent transparent calumnies for
want of matter to work on; and did not the people see clearly, they have
reason, and that their ends are merely the public good, it would desert them;
loosing patience upon the sense of the present evils, which (like the
sickness, which, even the best physic, before it can induce a final settled
state of health, works in a patient, chiefly if disorders, during the cure,
also foment the peccant humors) through the malignant traverses of our
Calumniators, both people and Parliament are of necessity to pass through:
and were it not so, though the King cannot dissolve the Parliament, yet the
people possibly might recall their elections in each County, since the
Parliament does but populo volenti imperare; which if then it does not do, what
ever some few inconsiderable and inconsiderate particulars may have attempted
here and there, it appears the major part at least approves what passes, and
that suffices: but let us take heed we traduce not these traducers; they have
a more honorable conceit of the Parliament: it is not base profit only, but
places of honor, such as are mentioned in their Propositions to the King, or
the like they look at, and travail for: but there may be hope, that these that
direct, correct the Parliament in all things, will here tell them, that they
are out of their way, and that their nearest way had been to have complied with
the King, which seeing these would seem to imagine the Parliament so unjust and
dishonorable they need not doubt, they would follow: and by this course
bringing in an arbitrary government; in which case (as before is said) the ill
Counselors, especially being authors or instruments of the change, carry away
the advantage or the gain, and spoils of the people, those their places would
be far more imperious, absolute arbitrary on the oppressed people (we may
instance in the Starrechamber) or more beneficial, as less obnoxious to
strict syndications, then they can be the other way, they now hold; in every
regard so accountable; the King in all presumption like to be eagerly vigilant
over them; and these Malignants themselves, grown yet more malicious and
venomous, if possible, by seeing the tables so turned, and what they have been
thus enormously wicked to compass, possessed by those they hate, that may be
the instruments to punish them for such their wickedness; besides the
Parliaments ever hanging over their heads; and so highly interested in the
demeanors of those they have made choice of; and perhaps the next Parliament
may consist of other Members then this present does, and so* as strangers to
those so chosen, less subject to favor them, if this were any thing to
satisfy the insatiate malice of those who under color of seeming suspicious
of the integrity of this Parliament, would through the sides of it, strike at
the heart and authority of all future Parliaments: so upon the matter, by this
course the Parliament now holds in such their propositions, the people and
kingdom are like to be the only gainers, as these public mischiefs grew from
ill Counselors and Officers. But have not some of the principal Worthies of
this Parliament quitted or endangered places of greater moment (besides the
general loss common I fear to the most or all of them through the neglect of
their private affairs, whilst they are thus wholly taken up with the public)
as their Countries confessors if not Martyrs, then they can any way expect by
the course they hold? are not examples of such, as suffering themselves to be
taken off from such services (on which they purposely seemed the more sharp,
that they might be so taken off) have grown almost as much in greatness,
thereby, as they lost in goodness, are not such instances as vulgar as the
spirits that furnish us with them? More might be said and much better herein by
better Judgments, but a weak one may suffice so strong a cause: there being
good reason to be short and slight in an argument or point that could afford no
just reason to have begun at all, did not such monsters of men urge it; Less
can it be conceived that hope, intention, or fruition of uncontroulled
dissolute licentiousness or pleasures, by means of the capacity they now
stand in, or as they are a Parliament can be a motive to them to continue the
power, or place they have, longer then the public necessity or good
requires, or convert it to any other use then it for which they were and are by
the people entrusted with such power, supposing they were no better then our
Calumniators, that where there were a motive or cui bono it would prevail with
them to do evil, had intention of such licentiousness been one of the
principles that moved them, what meant they without any necessity not only to
give public significations, that they meant to induce a strict reformation of
manners, but even amid so great and dangerous distractions to begin to set it
on foot, not without some further danger from those that hate it: As for any
pleasures they may hereby pretend, they seem to be no other then their
indeficient and admirable pains, dangers and indignities (let me add and base
ingratitudes, a blessed condition to fain tears and dangers that they may
continue in it) their noble constancy judging pro Deo and patria dulce
periculum, for all which whereas it appears they have no earthly reward
propounded to them (the like may be said of all those that adhere to the
Parliament) but the conscience of having done nobly in serving God and their
Country and defending it, did the Kingdom give what it could afford it were
short of them, and it must be an higher kingdom that can indeed equal them
and such a change of the kingdom, and no such as our Malignants would have us
fear, they appear to aim at and affect; and could they would they aim at a
tyranny for themselves, what need they have laid such a block in their own
ways, as a voluntary oath generally taken for the conservation of the Kings
just authority, and so many Declarations, and public protests to that
purpose, which they desist not from upon all occasions yet to do, when as, had
not their resolutions been thus fixed, diverse free late declaring themselves to
that effect, specially since matters of difference have arrived at this height,
and the Parliament so strong, and so many other circumstances ^itting, might
have been forborne. But to leap over all these bars in imagination (for in
Reason we never can) suppose the Parliament may effect a change of the
Monarchy, what form of government could they bring in instead of it (for they
will not say Anarchie nor I deny a mixed government, for such is our Monarchy
reduced to his right temper) Democracy? Then through perjury, great injustice,
and danger, they pursue their own ruin: For Democracy where the people or
multitude governs is enemy to the Nobility and Gentry, whereof chiefly or
solely the Parliament consists, bringing all to a parity, and making all men
alike in power, or rather taking away eminent persons quite, as envious or
jealous of them; whereas such have privileges over the vulgar in a just
Monarchy: What then does the Parliament affect Aristocracy? (where the
Nobility, or chief govern) but the multitude or people whom the Parliament has
been charged to court, in which multitude resides or consists the maine
strength, and who choose the Commons House, and must execute chiefly what the
Parliament orders, without which their orders are nothing, after Democracy or
Monarchy before Aristocracy: And does not the Parliament (as above is said)
from time to time give particular accounts of their actions to the world? does
there appear any previous preparing the way or disposing the people for such a
change? which were necessary, were it intended? at least after so long a time,
they would have begun to carry their design outward, and the people having
found it, would more and more have fallen off: but we see the contrary, and the
people every day more and more satisfied and assured of the integrity of their
intents. But were the two Houses a subject possibly capable of Aristocracy,
would the Lords of the upper House concur to it, which would reduce each of
them to a parity in power with each Member of the House of Commons, as
Democracy would equal them both with the multitude, for unless the Lords
would loose by granting this, should the Commons get any thing (if this yet be
any thing) by this imaginary if possible change?) yet how could they continue,
or hold it without the consent of the multitude or people? And should the
people unanimously concur to the erecting of this or any other form of
government, who should oppose it? But how foolish were it for a people to fear
that which can never be unless it self will? and the Parliament has found it
a long time strangely infatuated, insensible, unwilling to stir (till time
and experience had given too good attestation to the Parliaments next to divine
foresight) even when it has made appear to them their own rights, liberties,
and implored defense: and could the Parliament presume to find them to
concur actively to an unjust and unreasonable thing, the erecting a new
tyranny, not without great danger over themselves, contrary to the oaths and
perpetual Protestations of the Parliament.

And the Scots in the like occasion we see did not bring in any of these new
governments: nay, were the Parliament possibly capable of such tyranny, yet it
being in the hands of such a multitude, and that against the good will of the
people, (for so we must here suppose) they were easily divided, and so the
tyranny dissolved, especially there never wanting a minor part contrary to the
rest, and contrariety being the cause of dissolution* but so were not a
tyranny in the hands of one, and in him established by the good will of a
potent faction of malignants: unity which chiefly makes a Monarchy, duly
tempered the best form of government (as above was said) making the arbitrary
or tyranny of one upon the same reason, as the worst of all, so most hardly
dissolvible.

We may add to all, that this Parliament having pressed for, and obtained
trienniall Parliaments, whereby their actions, and demeanours in this present
Parliament, are subjected to frequent and certain examens, should or could
they give cause, and that perhaps by Parliaments consisting of other members
then these (not to speak of other accidents that may procure such a change)
should the people not be satisfied with what these do in this present
Parliament: it plainly argues, that out of the clearenesse of their
intentions, actions, and consciences, they are content, nay desire to leave
their actions to the censure of any: their persons, as concerning future
elections, to the opinion of the people upon their demerits; if the King please
not to come among them, and look to their doings, as they desire: If then upon
these reasons and much more that might be offered, the Parliament cannot have
any such end of establishing in themselves any arbitrary tyranny, or of their
own private emolument, with the hurt of their Countries; What can their aim
be all this while but the public good, the just defense and asserting of
their Countries rights and honor, by the just regulating and reducing the
Monarchy to the due temper? which is all the change of the government they
seem to affect (the same holds in all those that adhere to the Parliament, and
in it desert not themselves) from which it had especially through want of due
Parliaments exorbitated so dangerously, that had not this like another Moses
been sent by our gracious God to redeem or rescue us rather then to defend
us, and that with an outstretched arm, forcing the malignants to it, who as
they ever shunned it by all means, now deadly hate it, as fearing it, and in
that fear confessing tacitly, that same politic omnipotence of it, which is
now asserted, a worse then Egyptian servitude in humane probability had
overwhelmed us, and consequently the true principle or end that moves the
malignants, cannot be a true fear of any arbitrary power to be established in
the Parliament, though they so pretend, to divert us by foolishly fearing an
imaginary impossible danger, from looking to and timely opposing the true real
danger imminent and evident, nay to draw us to concur to the bringing of it
in with our own hands, which is an arbitrary government at discretion, which
the malignants themselves would establish, and that by a civil war, to the
ruin of all that is precious with honest men, or men of honor: They have had
such power in manner already in their hands; and that which the King is induced
by them to challenge at this present, amounts to no less in effect as shall
appear, the Parliament yet in vigor; what then may we expect if they should
prevail by force, which now their fallacies and deluding reasons are plainly
discovered they fly unto: What but that the Court and Parasites of it, should
wallow and revell in all licentiousness, luxury, excess, with pride, avarice,
and tyranny proportionable, whilst the rest languish under oppression,
slavery, poverty, disgrace, perpetual indignities or fears, accounted as
their bea^^s to labor for them, and so mediocritie a State, which the wisest
of men prayed for, no where to be found, but a deluge of vices from contrary
causes, till general ruin involve altogether; virtue and the glory of the
Nation before extinct. For we must not think tha^ these which love their
Country so well (for which to doubt to dye were dishonor) that they will not
be quiet and sit still to save it (for this much only may suffice from the
multitude of them, the heads and leaders excepted) nay can be content to ruin
the glory, liberty, safety of it, even with the hazard of their estates,
lives, honors, souls, so they may in some proportion share the spoils of
their Country, and grow fat with the blood and tears of the oppressed people:
We must not think they can do thus, but to the end to have greater means and
power to beget more monstrous in all villainy if it were possible. These can
fight against their Country to make themselves slaves to a few above them,
that the rest of their oppressed Country may be slaves to them, slaves of
slaves: but I doubt not, but these monsters, unless reason transform them,
shall meet with their Herculesses, honest men and men of honor, ^eady to die
for their Country, if need require, judging such a death infinitely to be
preferred before the lives of the chiefest of these, should they obtain what
they seek.

But let us end this patheticall flying out, though it be hard for the
inferior faculties sometimes not to stir, when the understanding somewhat
enlightened has inflamed the will.

On the other side, so divine a gift as this Parliament thankfully recognized
and made use of duly, and the just power and dignity of the Parliament, and
therein all our happiness wisely and manfully now once asserted, moderation
and mediocritie induced, the Monarchy duly tempered, may be in human
probability perpetual, and all the surfeit become Physic. And this violent
Fever of the State having amazed and drawn to an head all the malignant
humors before dispersed all over the body, and lying dangerously hidden, and
set on fire, consumed and expelled them (like the filth of an house swept into
an heap and burnt) the whole body may be much clearer sounder and better
disposed, then had not such a distemper ever been.

I hope it appears already were there no more then these presented weak
reasons to an ordinary rational man (if far better from others be too mean
for his Majesty) what way he is to take that all may be well; and seeing but
one side can be trusted with the power of the Kingdom, which of them is most
unlikely to tyrannize, or reduce all to arbitrary government, or which will
most probably use it to the public good only, or whether in such
extraordinary times it do not most safely repose where it is originally,
naturally inherent, viz. in the peoples own hands, and so in the Parliaments:
Nay were the case hitherto dubious, yet since liberty first made appointed
limited prerogative; for they confine together, as the people (in whom is the
radical, primary supreme power, and who made Kings, not Kings people) thought
best, when it first made choice of, or instituted this one form of government
among diverse others, which we call Monarchy, and whereof there are sundry
degrees in sundry States, some more some less trusted, or limited, as the
first founders pleased, (else why are they not all equal since free and
voluntary agents work or do only so much, or so far as they please; and the
various subordinate degrees or kinds of the creatures prove the divine Majesty
to be agens liberrimum, else the creatures would be all equal: an involuntary
or natural agent (as Philosophy terms it) ever working as much as it can, or
to the utmost extent or sphere of its power and activitie, and so an equality
in the effects) since I say, liberty or the people first created (as I may
say) Prerogative, and that so tempered, modified, or graduated, as it thought
most conducible to its own happiness (for the supreme power ever works for
it self rather then for the subordinate or inferior, as being the end; the
efficient and final causes being here co-incidents) it is just, that this,
namely, liberty, judge and give law to that; and that this, if an unnatural
jarre fall out, gain and prosper rather then the other; and since the people
reserved ever in its own hands, and saved to it self upon the trust to the
Monarchy, what privileges, right of Parliament, or liberties, etc. (parcel of
the original power naturally in the people, and which may draw back to the
fountain the derivative power, as the blood and spirits to the heart, when
there is cause) it thought best, surely it must do this with purpose to see
them conserved as safely as may be, and upon occasion to make use of them and
enjoy them, which could not be surely done without a power reserved to judge of
the state of them, and when they were to be used, and the like, (for if the
Prince be trusted touching the keeping himself within his limits, he may even
as well be trusted absolutely without limits:) nor such power to judge of them
is to any purpose, as abovesaid, without power to execute what is judged
hereupon fit. So the Parliament judges in this case as the first author, and
superintendent of the intent, and is not as a party to be judged.

Further, were the matter yet dubious, yet seeing the Protestant Religion, the
power being in the Parliaments hand, is far more out of the reach of danger
then the other way, even without calling his Majesty's good meaning into
question therein, as I hope anon will appear it ought to put it out of all
question, how we are to range our selves in these times. The Parliament having
(our case so standing) such power as is deduced, whatsoever would seem to
oppose that power and stand in their way, as they defend and assert the
public good so invaded, must be voidable: and usual ordinary known laws or
customs made or in use supposing, or whilst the Prince kept duly within his
bounds (which the King speaks so much of, saying, that he will ever govern by
them, and hold all to them) but ever intending the public good, are no way to
bound or tie up the transcendent power of the Parliament, when it shall
encounter new and never before heard of exorbitances or invasions of the
public good, which the times that made those known Laws never heard of, so
never provided against. But by proportion of reason this Parliament may and
ought as well provide by new Ordinances or orders for such new evils as they
encounter, as the former did for what they then met with: for they had their
original also (ex malis moribus b^nae leges) and had those times had such
causes offered, as these have, they would have provided remedies of a nature
like those this Parliament has done, the power and general intentions of all
times, or the universal ground being still the same, that is, to defend and
vindicate, or procure the public good: and to tie them to the known or old
Laws in this case, where the letter might kill, were irrational; for so the
first breaker of the Laws might take the privilege of the Laws, and
advantage of his own wrong, and under the colors of the Laws fight against
and overthrow them, or the rule, reason, or intention that caused them at first.

If it be said, nothing was done by the King of public consequence, but by
advice of the Judges, it may be answered, that the Parliament is the only
competent Counsel and Judge in cases nearly concerning the public, and
people in general, which the King is entrusted upon such occasions to call,
that the whole people may not but upon extraordinary causes be troubled to
elect for Parliaments, and attend that service: But in such a case as ours by
virtue of the legislative power residing in the Parliament it may make new
Ordinances, at least for the time, as it sees occasion and judges to be in
order to that supreme and immutable Law, or Law of Laws, and end of them all;
Salus populi suprema lex, and that power even of making new Laws is ever upon
the matter in both Houses of Parliament, and that even when the King keeps
himself within his due bounds, and is assistant in Parliament (how much more
then, as before is showed, if he shall by exorbitating dangerously bring
himself within the compass of our case?) and that the Kings consent to what
the Parliament propounds to him, to be enacted for Law, ought not to be denied,
may appear by comparing this following part of the Oath, which the Kings of
England at their Coronation take, or ought to take, cited in the Remonstrance
of the 26th of May, in haec verba: Concedis justas leges, and consuetudines
esse tenendas, and permittis per te eas esse protegendas, and ad honorem Dei
corroborandas quas vulgus elegerit secundum vires tuas? Respondebit (Rex)
Permitto, and concedo. Comparing this part of the Oath with the clause of the
preamble of a Statute there also cited, intimating that the King is bound by
his oath to remedy by Law such inconveniences, as the Kingdom may suffer in
the future, as well as to keep and protect Laws already in being; for then
either those Latin words here cited, or some part of them, and that the
latter, namely, Quas vulgus elegerit, are to be understood of Laws futurely to
be made, or else it cannot be showed by what part of the Oath, as the said
preamble affirms, the King is bound by Law to remedy the mischiefs that happen
from time to time to his Realm. Nor will the Laws of Grammar, or use of
speech, or custom of phrase tolerate, that, Elegerit, without the conjunction,
Si, or the like preceding, or regulating it (though we pass not by
unconsidered the rude speaking of those times) can ever be taken for Elegit,
the preterperfect tense: but as it stands in the forecited place, must of
necessity participate a future nature, and signify precisely, shall have
chosen; that is, that the King assumeth to confirm such Laws, as the people
shall have chosen; it being to be conceived, that the people, or Parliament
first amongst themselves, must have debated of, chosen and agreed upon them,
before they present them to the King to be confirmed. Besides, if those cited
words, Et permittis per te esse protegendas, and ad honorem Dei corroborandas
quas populus elegerit, should not refer to future elections, but to past
only, they were superfluous and vain: the words precedent, Concedis justas
leges and consuctudines esse tenendas (which presuppose necessarily, and cannot
be understood without a precedent election and consent of the people to them)
expressing sufficiently Laws and customs elected, already confirmed and in
use. And the Kings answer to these cited words, being bimembris, or twofold,
Concedo and permitto (all the other answers of the King to the other Questions
in the Oath, cited in the said Remonstrance, because the questions are merely
simple and single, contained in one word only, as to one question only;
Servabo to another only; faciam being also single, and in one word) argues the
question to be double, as is said. And that the King is not bound only in
general thus to remedy the particular ways or means left to his choice; see
the said Remonstrance, folio 8. which ought to have it self sufficed without
such poor gleanings, as these, or the like: If then by these and other better
reasons which others have presented, the Parliament has such a legislative
power, even where the King discharges his office, as upon the matter to make
such Laws as it judges best for the public good; where through the
prevalence of ill men about him, it is not done, but the contrary, and so the
danger is from him, shall not power be in them to make new Ordinances, or
provisionall Laws, for the timely remedying such public mischiefs, at least
for the time, and to suspend some of those in being, if they judge fit? How
much more then to judge of, declare, or interpret those that seem dubious,
ranging and making all to be subservient to the supreme Law Salus populi, the
rule and reason of all Laws, as was ever intended at the making of all
particular Laws. Has not even the Lord Chancellor a little touch of such a
power upon the Common Law? What then may we think a Parliament has, and that
when the very public is in danger? And if the whole people unanimously
consenting, upon a Princes not performing what he is bound unto, may possibly
change the very form of that limited government, which it first instituted,
how much more may it conserve or defend that temper or kind of government,
which it has erected by regulating the enormities of the Prince, by
maintaining and holding what they have reserved out of that which was all
theirs at the first, or their own rights? How many degrees then are they off
from being bound to become themselves the instruments to overthrow them? how
strongly are they bound to the contrary? And indeed were not the Parliament the
supreme Judge in all the said questions, or of like nature, (if we may call it
a Parliament at all, not having this power) it could not possibly save the
people, when ill men prevailing upon the King would oppress it; for while they
carry on by degrees, and mature by little and little such their mystical and
pernicious designs (which must be met with betimes in such tender and jealous
matters, before they advance and grow strong, when caution comes too late, and
opposition out of season does but exasperate and increase the evil) they will
cause the King by fit instruments for the purpose, to pronounce, judge, or
interpret each such degree or gaining a new and further point, still lawful,
and not subject to question, however dangerous to the people in it self, and of
worse consequence, till the mystery at last unmask, and all be desperate.

It may be superadded, that should the Parliament be more jealous of the Prince
then there were reason, (which yet as I hope has appeared is not to be
imagined of the wisdom and Justice of the Parliament) yet it were the far
less evil, that the Prince, being but for the people, should somewhat suffer
by such the Parliaments jealousy (which were but peccare in meliorem, and
securiorem partem) then that by the Parliaments too much security and believing
in the Prince, the people or whole kingdom should be endangered, or oppressed
for whose good they both are ordained, as means for the end: Besides that the
authority and politic infallibility of the Parliament must be by all that
love their Country, not blemished but held sacred and inviolate, as supreme.
The King indeed says he will defend and maintain, the Laws, Liberties,
properties of Subjects, just privileges of Parliament, but even in saying this
he seems to violate them, if the thereby assume the supreme Judgment of them
to himself, which, as already partly has appeared, and further hereafter may
do, cannot be; Admit this Trojan horse into your walls, allow this, all of them
may easily resolve into nothing. Consider well, what Judgment has been made
of the Laws, the liberty, the property of the Subject, before this Parliament,
whilst a future Parliament was doubted and feared, and therefore kept off as
long as these Malignants could, (but their fear and hate shows what we ought
ardently to desire, and love) whilst so many Monopolies, Loan, Conduct, Coat,
Ship Money, and the like grievances were brought upon us (our persons not going
Scotfree) as consisting well, and compatible with our laws, liberties,
properties, and adjudged lawful, which yet what did they, or ere long going on
at least would they have wanted of making them all merely at discretion,
pleasure, and will, the mere names of such things remaining, and used indeed,
as Trophies of their Conquest, and monuments of our quondam felicity, and at
leisure to be lamented folly and eternal shame. The danger of our Religion is
not forgotten, because not ranked in mention with the rest, it shall have a
better place by it self, as a Queen sitting alone.

The Judgment made of privileges of Parliament during this Parliament seem to
have come little short of the Judgments made of our liberties, properties,
etc. and if it be duly weighed. First, that they will have the King to be
judge of them, then what Judgment has been lately made, both in fact and in
words, or Declarations of them, a man meanly penetrant will find them resolved
by the positions of these Malignants into next to nothing: and all this while
the Parliament was and is in vigor, vindicates, and asserts them, and likely
to call these men to account, what will they make of them, should they through
the authority, and reputation of this Parliament, which is the essence of it,
pierce at once the heart of all future: for a Parliament not free were no
Parliament, and if the King be allowed judge of privileges of Parliament,
where any new case happens which may touch the very essence of it (if it be any
thing else then the privileges) will it not come to this, that the Judges he
appoints, or rather such instruments, as the Malignants about him please to set
over us, shall upon the matter judge the Parliament, which is to Judge their
Judges, making it and the Laws what they please, and to restrain the power and
freedom of it, as of the Laws, as they think fit; whereupon would follow even
the same inconveniences, which were before mentioned, supposing the King the
supreme Judge of the Laws, namely, that the Parliament should be disenabled to
defend the people, or indeed it self if incroached on, or oppressed upon the
same reasons in that place expressed. But it seems more rational, that since
the Parliament is to be Judge of the Laws (as is above showed) nay even may
make them, at least in some cases; it may judge as well of its own privileges:
neither appears it in the Kings power to make them, what he pleases, save only
thus: if he does not exorbitate, nor innovate any thing against them, neither
can the Parliament desire any alteration of them in any point, betwixt it and
the King, concerning them. But in case of extraordinary emergents of
never-before-heard of attempts on his part, whither by any verbal declaration,
or by fact, whereby the privileges, authority or very being (for it may
trouble a good School-man to distinguish clearly betwixt these three) it self
of the Parliament is endangered, it is reason, that the privileges now become
any thing that the Parliament judges fit for the conservation of it self. For
the maine end and intent of the first, ancient, ordinary, and usual
privileges of Parliament, being to enable, and qualify it for the due
attending, defending or advancing the public good (for which purpose they
were judged sufficient by the first Institutors, not suspecting such new
invasions, or attempts on them, or on Parliaments as since have happened in
more corrupted times, but thinking them rather secure, as part of the Laws, or
customs which Kings are bound to keep inviolate) why should not the same end
and intent, which ever remains in equal force, immortal, and immovable, work
and move, as well to the instituting even of new ones, if new causes happen,
and without such new ones the Parliament shall remain disenabled to procure the
public good, for which it was ordained? and if the Parliament may in
extraordinary times as now make new Ordinances for the conservation of the
people, it may make (if need require) new Ordinances or Privileges (which are
but the private Laws of or concerning the Parliament) for its own conservation,
without which they cannot defend or conserve the people; and in vain had it
power to make new Ordinances upon new occasions for the public good, if it
have no inherent power to make new privileges or ordinances upon new emergent
dangers to save it self, Posse naturally and necessarily presupposing Esse, as
grounded on it; Qui dat finem, dat necessaria ad finem: the privileges being
to defend and maintain the Parliament as the Laws the people, and as Salus
populi is lex suprema, as before, so it may as well be said, Salus Parliamenti
supremum privilegium. If it may work new, it may much more interpret, declare,
and judge of the old on occasion; and are no more to be held to the old,
usual, known, privileges, when new extraordinary attempts, or affronts
happen, then to the old known Laws only in the case above spoken of, and upon
the same ground and analogy of reason. And here we are fallen unawares on the
old Lord Treasurer Burleigh, who we need not say was a great Statesman, who was
wont to say, He knew not what a Parliament might not do: not much unlike the
Archbishop Bancroft (a great Statesman) who would tremble (as is said) at the
mention of a Parliament, as knowing, or rather not knowing the power of it; and
had not they both taken the word Parliament in our acception, they had told us
no news. It is one effect of ill Counsel about a Prince (in the consequence
sometimes better then in their intention) to minister occasions to the people by
invasion of their rights, to look narrowly into the nature of the Princes
prerogative, when by the power of truth, it often loses of the former
reputation (which liberty gains): a more dubious light setting it of better,
and ignorance begetting here devotion, and admiration, of what is unknown; and
hence it is perhaps, that in these times as more polite and penetrant, then
many former ages, Prerogative is said generally to loose in Christendom, the
better thus fortified against the so great, and growing danger from the Common
enemy the Turk, and other great Mohammedan Princes the great bulwark of
Christendom, Germany, now so torn the more requiring it) by so maine a
disparity in matter of liberty (the Mahometans using their Subjects, as their
beasts, or slaves) as well as of Religion. But to our way from this Digression.
We may from this place take a prospect another way into the plot of these
Malignants; being by a crew of our own Nation but unnaturalized, partly not
penetrating their deluding pretenses by reason, as naturally simple, partly
having their understandings debauched by a will instantly solicited, or
overruled by enormous affections, and passions: which second kind may
constitute a middle degree between malice and simple ignorance (might this
simple tractate gain one of the first sort, the pains taken were a pleasure,
but should it hope to win one of the second degree, this presumption might make
bare pardon too much for it.) There is a third sort in whom their
understandings and consciences though having perfect light and clearly
discerning the truth, and right, yet are like slaves forced, and dragged by a
Diabolical will (affections in this degree not mentioned, as arguing gross
carnality, or corporealnesse: but these are spirituales nequitiae) by such a
society, whilst they speciously pretend to defend privileges of Parliament,
Laws of the Land, liberty, property of the Subject, etc. but whereof the King
must be supreme Judge (for in this point lies all the mystery, and Cabala)
through this mortal wound of the authority and essence of the Parliament, the
true, and only Judge, and consequently defender of them all (as above is
showed) to strike the heart of them all, leaving us only tenues umbrae, or
manes, or apparitions of them, to pursue, distract and torment us, as
accessaries to the murder, or rather principals (since no accessory in Treason)
if we passively concur, much more if we help to act it, thus the matter being
disposed they may introduce the form (the perfection of the work) and the state
at their discretion, and the way of the Lord Pope prepared, and his crooked
paths made straight, they may easily bring him in, as after we may endeavor to
show.

But if the plot seem not deep enough laid, as supposing and hoping at home so
many monsters, and vipers (though the fewerneeded, the sound party of England
and Scotland already distracted by the Irish Rebellion to that end if not at
first raised, yet sundry ways fomented by them) then perhaps to piece it from
abroad; and by cutting the banks of the kingdom to let in a deluge of foreign
forces, and so yet further subdistract the remnant; if we conceive the Fleet of
Spaniards, seen not long since at the Downs, carried any mystery, or came not
unsent for, or moved not to no end, or Hull so eatnestly made at, Newcastle,
Portsmouth, etc. signify any thing; which though intended to distract England,
and ruin it, may rather (opening our eyes, and disabusing us) by Gods
overruling unite it as in a common cause against an universal and evident
danger, not to speak now of other matters judicating the same. And they
intending in England a government at discretion, and all made in all
probability, or after the French fashion; if the middle sort of people of
England, and Y comanry, of whom chiefly consist the trained bands, and wont to
be a maine strength of our victorious Armies, can by no subtilties be drawn to
their party, then by policy, or even plain force to disarme them, suspecting as
they have good cause that these, if once they be unhoodwinkt, will especially
oppose the change as whereby they from being in the happiest condition of any
of their rank perhaps in Europe, nay in the world (who here live like men, and
are wont to fight, or die like men in honor or defense of their Country)
might well be reduced to the terms of the Peasants of France, of villenage,
and slavery: a fit recompense for their danger and pains should they fight and
labor to bring it in. As for the scum of the people they judge it either
senseless, or careless of the public, and desiring a change, or easily
drawn, where there is hope of greater spoil, and pillage. We may place so much
the more below this scum many of the greater sort, that stand for these
Malignants against the truth and right (every day more and more p^^in^y
convincing them) and against their Country by how much they owe to it more
then the Rascality does, yet appear to be drawn with hope of spoil, and pillage
in their degree and proportion as much or more then the Rascality it self.

But thought it be so with the State, is our Religion in danger that way also?
why else are the Papists so active, so busy? is it only that they may be
slaves? but in a politic way only use may be made of them, and of their
power, without any intent to symbolize with them in their religion, as
sometimes has been done in other Countries. Be it so (though it be not good to
be prodigal and facile in our grants which our religion may pay for) yet
taking it this way, so great a service so seasonable at such a pinch (when all
good Subjects, and judicious honest men fail them) received from the Papist,
must draw on in way of grateful acknowledgement, some favor at least some
advantage, which cannot be but at as much danger, and disadvantage of the
religion (not to insist how hardly they will lay down their Arms once taken
up, and victorious, or the King be able to make good his faith, or word). And
are not they the fittest and surest means to conserve a State, that have been
thought and found such for the acquiring? But be this as it may it is clear,
that can the Papist bring the matter to an absolute, and arbitrary government,
and render the prerogative immense and even divine, they gain a maine point on
our religion, for then between them and the heaven of their desires, there were
interposed but the turning of one will, and that one already prepared,
disposed and inclined to them by such meritorious supererogatory service, and
further propitiated by the so strong intercessions (how strong (to speak like
those we have to do with) when used by her that may in somethings even command)
our sovereign Lady Mary. (I had rather seem to some a little too much tied to
sense only, and to the present times we yet live in, when I presumed to use
that phrase: turn, or change of one will; then with others, by the abstraction
of a potent imagination, found worthy to have been rapt into the glory of
those times, in stead of change of will: to have used a phrase or sense seeming
to such more orthodox, terming it rather an external manifestation and
declaration only to us here below of that which was ever from the beginning
predestined internally since in Gods no real change nor shadow of change)
but the other way a whole Parliament at least must be first turned, and that in
Diametrall opposition with the Papist, and should foreign Force come in by
Portsmouth, Plymouth, or Falmouth (what if we add Ireland?) to induce Tyranny,
Religion runs equal hazard with the State. And it may be, the Kings forces
running lately with so strong bias so eagerly at Banbury, Warwick, Coventry,
etc. esteemed most opposite indeed to the Papist, though perhaps not otherwise
direct to the first, or maine mark for the present, of these Malignants, may
judicate and argue, without any sophistry, a present complication of the
disease, and the duplicity of the design, and danger: or if not a present
essence of a double disease, yet a dangerous malady now in being already, but
breaking out into a symptom more to be taken heed of then the very disease,
and depending on it: But they object, our Religion is on the other hand more
endangered by Brownisme, Anabaptisme, etc. suppose this true, and that these
should get strength, nay prevail with the Parliament (which it is charged to
promote upon as likely, as strong, and even the same grounds, as it is to
affect the change of the Monarchy, yet as we said of we know not what new form
of government, supposing ridiculously the Parliament did introduce it, it were
easily dissolvible; so obscure Brownisme or Anabaptisme were much more easily
mastered, and redressed, then most politic, potent, all over bearing Papistry,
likely to be backed with foreign force, which I think none will say is to be
feared from those other scarce known, weak, poor Sects, whose obscurity, and
paucity, hides rather and exempts from animadversion, and would the Parliament
attempt this (though we might justly refuse to dispute with those that deny
principles in this kingdoms policy, calling still in question the wisdom,
Justice and honor of Parliaments) could it ever effect it without the peoples
concurring? Papistry so increased at home, so countenanced might (if it does
not already with their good friends help in Ireland, and elsewhere hope to
force entrance). How foolish then is it for the people to fear that, which can
never take effect, unless it self will have it so? (I fall unawares upon the
same answer here used before touching the supposed change of the State, because
the false grounds they would seem to go on here, and there seeming the same)
and if the whole kingdom or people will have it so there is no opposing. But
has not the Parliament taken a voluntary Oath (besides so many public
Protestations, and other obligations to us, the Scots, and the States of the
Low Countries) for the maintenance of the Protestant Religion, which they are
too wise, and just needlessly to have done, and so should they do otherwise to
incur most justly universal falling of, or rather falling on them, had they
had any intent ever to have done, as these would seem to fear, to direct us
here also from looking at the true fear and danger, nay to draw us with our own
hands to pull it on us; we may superadde, that the voluntary oaths of such a
multitude as the Parliament on whom no suspicion at all can fasten, of
inclining to that religion, which takes upon it to dispense with oaths and
equivocations, and thereby with the Law of God, Nature and Nations (which
intended to advance it, will by Gods justice advance the ruin of it) are
better security, then our Malignants have or can give us on the other side, the
Antithesis in each part inquired into duly as the subject well deserves.

But these men would here also take benefit of their own wrong, according to
their usual method (it may appear what correspondence, or good intelligence
the maine dangers of our Religion and State still hold mutually, or how they
resemble). Necessity of the State, nay of the very preservation of it self
(whereof these Objectors are manifestly the authors) may justly and too
evidently does compel the Parliament to the settling of Religion, (though the
end of policy and however first in esteem and intention, yet not so in the
time of execution always) after the ordering of politic affairs; and in such
desperate times as these, not to do this, were but a sacrifice without salt, a
foolish superstition (like that of the Jews, who would rather sit still, and so
suffer themselves to be cut in pieces by the capital enemies of their State
and Religion, (contrary to David who in necessity spared not the very
Shewbread) who maliciously invaded them purposely at such a time) then arm or
fight upon such necessity on their Sabbath; Which they complain the Parliament
will not now do; which should it now, one ruin might involve both Church and
State both at once: yet has it not altogether, even such times
notwithstanding, left it self without some testimony of their good intentions
herein, as particular Acts or Orders of theirs do show to the world; but the
attempts, and facts of the Malignants, evident to all men apologize too well
for the Parliament in this point without any words from any man, if we weigh
the desperate estate of public affairs well in these times, caused by the
malice of these Monsters; which times forcing us for a while to content our
selves with an implicit, or general faith, as touching the ordering,
reforming, or settling of other particulars concerning Religion, which cannot
for the said necessary reasons and the like* be yet effected; yet we have,
besides many other raducements obvious enough to confirm such implicit faith,
this also that of such ordering and settling these matters, as is to be wished,
there is far greater hope, and presumption (caeteris paribus) from those
Divines, that preach and cry down the temporal greatness, pride, riches,
avarice, etc. of the Clergy, and so all their own hopes and pretensions that
way, and consequently from the Parliament, which we see countenanceth such men,
then from the contrary side: that professing likewise in a special manner and
degree, mortification, contempt and renouncing of the world, and of the glory,
greatness, and pomp of it, humility and the like (as minding heavenly matters,
and things above) as principles of the Doctrine and Religion they press upon
us, yet are not ashamed to appear to the world invested (through various
mysteries of iniquity) with so great a share of whatsoever the most worldly
men (whose highest contemplations ascend not to the Moon) compose their Trinity
of, as may enable these men thus crucified, and dead to the world by their own
earthly power, greatness, authority (not to insist on that kind which they
have in our times, attempted to render, in some points, or cases at least,
independent of the crown and absolute; and which earthly greatness, rather
then the Parliament shall question, or regulate, they will question and
condemn the Parliament, and advance a Civil War, or foreign invasion, to
the evident danger of a general ruin, and abomination of desolation of their
Country, nay Church it self, which these hypocrites would seem to stand for)
as may enable them, I say, by their own temporal potency (which in the hand of
such men becomes more dreadful, then any spiritual power they exercise)
sufficiently to keep in awful silence, if not to bring into a kind of
Inquistion, such as most heretically shall not captivate and subdue their
understanding and reason under so strong a faith, as to believe, that these
chief ones (who ought to be most eminent of all in practicing the said
principles of renouncing the world, humility, mortification, etc. which they
recommend, command, and enjoin, as Leaders and Captains for all that should
follow them on so difficult services) can yet practice and pursue, I say, so
ardently, so desperately the clean contrary, so as if they would have others
quit the world, only that themselves might seize ^t; and yet thus by their
deeds drawing into suspicion, doubt, imsprision with multitudes of men, nay,
even consuting their Doctrine, not be a maine cause of the miseries and
calamities of the world, whilst deluges of sin and wickedness, and
pernicious consequences break in at this so great an overture of the faith,
thus discountenanced, and discredited, and even called in question; will not
many incline rather to believe, that this practice, this doctrine, so
destructive one to the other, is sowing their feilds with mingled seed, wearing
a garment mingled with woollen and linen, so for bidden in the Mosaike Law?
That such a ridiculous unsuitablenes between such profession and doctrine, such
practice and deeds, is rather a mockery of the world. Will they not like one
Cicero speaks of, wonder cur aruspex videns risum teneret? Though the Mahumetan
sect be gross, and carnal, and the Mahumetans themselves exceeding devout in
their kinds, and superstitious, having their Churchmen in great reverence,
diverse of them rich and prosuse otherwise in works they conceive any way pious
and charitable, and though otherwise the Nation very covetous, yet I think it
will not be easy to show that their chief Churchmen in general, in any
temporal greatness or riches, do not much rather resemble the mendicant
Orders among the Papists (did they hold themselves to their Rules) then the
Papisticall or our Prelates and chief Clergymen, who yet profess themselves
Leaders in so spiritual, so heavenly, and sublime, so world-renouncing a way,
faith and doctrine. It is true the Turkish Muphty or chief Priest, is by the
grand Turk, partly to please the people, in show and shadow greatly honored;
not perhaps without a competency in revenue, but I take it hereabouts their
devotion of any note this way ends. As for any temporal greatness and riches
the Mesaicall Clergy might have, we are taught, these were rather gross and
sensible Types, then any thing else, of the spiritual eminency, graces,
endowments, and power, that ought to shine in the sublime and heavenly
Antitype; whence their true authority with the people and reverence, and even
veneration to their doctrine, places and persons must slow, conserved,
increased by ever constant and invincible rejections of the least not necessary
temporal matter, if pressed on them, as an high dishonor, or affront offered
to discredit them, a bribe to corrupt them in the execution of their Embassage,
a bait to entrap them and frustrate the service they are sent about, a
temptation of pernicious consequence, nay, of what the State may adjudge and
assign the Clergy as necessary (if it might be) a vo^^ntary and absolute
declining of part even of that (for I doubt not but the State would appoint
such a proportion, as might to duly mortified and spiritual men, afford
matter for the honor of such a refusal would undoubtedly add such authority
and reverent regard to them, and their doctrine, that men seeing they seek them
not theirs, nor will admit more of the world, then what is merely necessary
for them, for the discharge of their places; you shall discover a new world:
Men by such courses which will bring on doctrine proportionable, will be so
moved that cutting off each in his proportion greatly, even their own
superfluous vanities, much more their sins: what our spiritual men may so have
refused, with infinite more by others thus cut off, may be distributed among
the poor, (besides the benefit of such examples and doctrine, extending even
to these:) and so universal charity, reducing all to a blessed kind, if not
of paritie, yet of proportion, leaving the least in a tolerable mediocritie, a
golden age or primitive times may rise again in the world.

But the way to this heaven is first to go by the gates of hell, as through
the Parliament the Kingdom is made at by the true malignants, so through or
under color of a pretended malignant party, that seduceth or rules the
Parliament, the Parliament or authority and dignity thereof is attaqued, but
sure this is propounded as an article of faith, and to weak reason past
comprehension how it can well be: but how ever they are misbeleevers and
heretics that pertinaciously reject an article of faith, and with force to be
proceeded against; yet force being found often none of the best ways to
extinguish heresy, but rather the canker spreaded and exasperated by rude
handling, many have not and will not be deterred from advancing such as these,
plain or stronger oppositions, if any of this malignant party propound any
thing (as in all great assemblies some must break the matter and begin) and
the house consent to the proposition; it is now the act of the whole house: if
any propound or speak things that seem to others offensive, or to deserve
animadversion, and yet the house, or major part punish it not, they by such
connivence (for these men may be allowed to question still principles, that the
Parliament would do dishonorably, and yet come short of their malicious
intents) make it also this way their own; and so not these censors, or any else
but the Parliament, as above appeared, is to judge of the Parliament; but such
censors themselves are to be condemned by the Parliament, for thus presuming or
assuming to themselves the supreme power to judge; besides particular charges
and articles against such were to be offered to the House, the accusers and
witnesses to be produced and forth-comming, that if they make not good their
charges, the parties unjustly molested and accused, might have condign
reparations upon them; and the House it self satisfaction, the public
service thus causelessly interrupted, and the integrity of the House called in
question, and the like, appertaining to cases of this nature. Such charges have
been promised long since should suddenly appear against the accused Members of
the Parliament, and by them as Justice earnestly required, but appear not all
this while, not so much as to the people abroad, (though this were not the
right way) which they so strive to incense against the Parliament, but rather
war in stead of them; and seeing so many of the very Members of the Houses of
Parliament are their enemies, falling off from them unjustly (if none such
still remain among them) were things appearing unjustifiable there said or
done (if it might stand with the liberty and power of Parliament not to have
liberty of speech) it might easily be made appear in particular to the world,
and so complaint be made to the Parliament thereof, if it were to any end to
complain there of that, which has already passed without punishment. But
seeing the Parliament has power (the case standing as before has been showed)
to do in all things as they see cause; by good consequence their speeches
necessarily preparing, discussing, agitating, concluding what is so to be done,
cannot be subject to any limitting, questioning, or account abroad, nor in
reason therefore are to be divulged in that sense; this being incompatible with
such power. But then these haters of our Lawmakers and Laws, say; Many of
both Houses are away, and so the acts less valid; but be the number remaining
little, yet the acts of the Major part of that number are still good. For
neither the King that called them away, or countenanceth them that desert their
stations, may ailedge this; nor the Members that voluntarily (not upon trust in
those that remain, or leave obtained) abandon their places there and duties,
are to take the benefit, either of their own wrong, whether negligence in such
Members, or worse perhaps, nor of their own unworthiness, as Cowardice, to
oppose what they liked not: which fear (admitting such could be) argues still
that they that feared were the lesser number; though what needed they fear to
speak freely, a dissenting lesser number being ordinary, and sometimes a very
few, perhaps scarce enough to make a number, dissenting openly from the rest of
the whole House without any inconvenience? It being allowed for any to speak
their minds whilst a matter is in agitation before it be settled. If they say,
they go away that they may not seem to allow what would pass though they
were present: then the Major part concurres to what is done by their own
confession, else why stay they not to oppose it? If they say, so many are gone
without leave of the Houses, as put together would make the Major part,
supposing this were true, either such a Major part went away at once in a body,
and then it was their fault not to stay; for then they being the Major part had
prevailed; or they went by little and little, and then still it was a Major
part of the remainder that concurred to what was done, else it had not passed:
and so the acts still good: If they fly to say that they who thus deserted the
House out of fear, did it not as fearing the Parliament, but the people;
granting these men this, which is not their due, that such had cause to fear
the people, and that such base fear, when as they pretend, they were to stand
for the King, Country, Laws, Liberties, Religion, and did not render them
utterly unworthy their places: it may be answered briefly; they that remained
and carried matters, might fear the King as much or more: but their cause was
noble and good; but these or the like Cavils will no more hoodwinke the people:
their only course were to produce some public act of Parliament, that might
certify the world, that the King and both houses have long since unanimously
concurred to dissolve this Parliament; else Sophistry will not carry it against
the manifest truth.

By the premises or rather by diverse excellent Tractates published by others
to the same, or the like effect, I hope it is even as clear that the
Parliament is and ought to be the supreme Judge in public matters now in
question in England, as what it is, it has judged and ordered touching these
things, by so many public orders, declarations, and the like; and
consequently that reason wills that they be sacred in our esteem, and
punctually obeyed and executed, and so no need of war: and whosoever goes
against reason and truth, goes against God himself, who is Prima, summa, pura
ratio, and it will concern him nearely to look to it, whether he be stronger
then God: goes against himself if he be a man, and shall first find a civil
war in himself, before he can cause it in his Country upon such grounds,
and for his Majesty he cannot as he is a King, but judge that, that man thinks
dishonourably of him, who goes about to persuade him, that, that can be for
his good that is not for the good of his Kingdom, and so sever what is so
excellently joined; or that the great Counsel of the Kingdom is not the
only, at least the very best, and the only sure and securing way without all
doubt, for that Prince to follow that intends the public good: and which will
ever assuredly concur with him to that end: nor in opposing an arbitrary
power, which ill men about him for their own private and wicked ends, would
induce: Does the Parliament any thing but disenable a Prince, or rather those
about him from doing ill, or more properly from usurping such power; which to
what end is it in a good Prince, which he will or can never reduce to act or
use: but the false or pretended Mother of the child, who would have it
divided, (whom the wisdom of the King may discern) will whisper, there is no
thanks or glory to do good, unless he might have done evil, and so did good
freely; since free will only merits (I believe they hold merits) it seems
these malignants fetched not this Doctrine from heaven; for there we may find
that confirmation in grace in the Angels and blessed spirits of just men,
whereby complete free will, or the remains of it (which free will argues but
imperfection and mutabilitie; power to sin being but impotency, and the King
of Kings, God himself, who is perfection it self, being above and without all
power or possibility of doing any evil, yet, (rather therefore I should say)
omnipotent in or for good) that confirmation in grace, I say, by which free
will is transfigured and sublimed into a state divine; and Posse non peccare,
into non posse peccare, is a transcendent blessing, if not the very essence of
celestial beatitude; where these suggest, such a condition is to be declined,
though with ruin of all: But howsoever the Divines of our times may not allow
the explication or application of this point, we may hope his Majesty out of
his Princely care of the good of his people, though both himself and it may
believe well of his good intents to that purpose, will be far from judging such
a puntiglio of arbitrary power (for however it may fill and tickle the
fantasy, yet deeply and duly penetrated into by judgment, it appears to
resolve even into no more (if a puntiglio be any thing) or least it might
possibly be thought, he would, or might have done evil, had he not been
restreined from it (when he cannot violate such just restrictions, without
first doing the greatest evil of all to the public) from judging, I say,
such a puntiglio a just and sufficient cause to destroy the people by a civil
war; when were this power indeed justly belonging to him, yet true love to
his people might judge it no other way useful, then to have the glory and
thanks of relinquishing it voluntarily, least otherwise the peoples good and
safety for a puntiglios sake, or satisfying a fantasy, or an humor of one
man, should depend on the turn or change of one man's will, whenever it may
happen, and more then this, great and noble minded men, though no Christians,
have more then once done, when having in their hands absolute power over their
Country (not unjustly gotten) they have freely and of their own accord given
it up absolutely, judging it so best for their Countries good, leaving it even
in full liberty, and so living themselves in, or rather under it, but much
higher in true glory and honor then ever. But though such power is not here in
his Majesty, he is yet not without means in his hands, and a fair
opportunity to lay a tie not altogether unlike on his people, and to exhibit
freely great and public munificence all at once, by a fair and voluntary
relinquishing all contestation about it, whilst yet a malignant faction,
preferring their passions before reason, and conscience, before his honor and
safety, instigate and assist him as much as they can, or rather would make him
their instrument to compass it by an unnatural pernicious civil war, on
whom the blame may justly be laid, as they alone would have gone away with the
benefit.

By these and the like passages had been, and even yet (so it be betimes
taken) may be the way to the true arbitrary power indeed; the peoples hearts
(where God begins with man, as at the right end; this is the divine Method)
which draw all the rest sweetly, which the pretended false bastard arbitrary
power, could never by unjust violence effect: and thus by fairly quitting the
pursuit of the false, the true may be gained: a magnanimous Prince, that
confides in his own virtue, will put himself boldly and securely on the free
wills of his Subjects. It is in manner a divine Charecter; Scire, and velle
liberis hominibus imperare; to know how to temper and govern free men,
Gentlemen, Princes; and in such a condition God made man, to serve his glory
best: and is it not a more glorious thing when a Prince shall by his great,
proportionate, and heroike virtues, render them at his devotion, and make them
his voluntary slaves, being otherwise free and noble, then if he found them
made slaves by the practice and vices of others, or so made them such himself.
Thus a free people is a strong motive and occasion to a Prince to ^ender them
wholly his by extraordinary virtue; the fall of this emulous Carthage would
shake Rome, though in opposition with it and therefore the noblest of the
Romans best and most wisely loving Rome, for Romes good advised Carthage should
stand. But reason evinceth, that persisting as he does, he remains sequestered
from all just power and authority, as touching the matters in question between
him and his Parliament, on the justice and wisdom whereof he may safely put
himself, secure, that they will not, nor can divest him of any thing, that
justly belongs to him: only reason and right require, that it be left to the
Parliament to be the Judge thereof, without which power, the people and
Kingdom cannot be safe, as stands deduced. Monarchy thus tempered by liberty
and prerogative, as it is remote from intrinsicke causes of dissolution, so
from external. If a Prince governing at discretion invade it, the party in
the goodly arbitrary government excluded by the distemper of such a State from
the benefits of liberty (the party, I say, for be a Prince never so absolute,
yet his Mamaluks, his Militia, by whose conspiracy or tyranny he awes and
enslaves the rest, not only equal for the most part in point of liberty, the
Subjects of a free State, but exceeding them far in all licentiousnes and
tyrannizing, and enslaving upon the matter the Prince himself, as well as
others, justly lay on his own shoulders by Gods judgment, that which he makes
or uses these as instruments to lay unjustly on the necks of his other.
Subjects, whom he ought to have protected: Instances are frequent of the
Pretorian Cohorts or Legions tyranny on the Roman Emperors, of the Janisaries
on the great Turk, of the Mamaluks on the Egyptian Soldans) and reason shows
this danger is most to be feared, where a Prince has assumed the peoples
liberty by public oppression) I say, if the absolute Monarch invade the
justly tempered, the oppressed party is not to be trusted, but to be kept
under by part of those he will trust, (he can trust none safely) as certain
enemies at home; so the power which he must trust, doubly lessened: the party
used goes faintly on the free Nation, for at best by bringing their free
neighbors (whence was the chief hope of assistance for the recovering their
own liberty) into servitude, they should but confirm and render remediles
their own slavery, increasing the strength of the oppressor, and likewise on
the same reason resist less, if invaded: Only if the Prince will make
account, or can be content, or cannot avoid to be himself an equal, a
companion with his Mamaluks (Facinus, quos in quinat, aequat) or rather to be
tyrannized by them, and his honor, authority, name, person, to be made their
instrument against his people, he may translate the said faintnes from them on
himself; though when all is done, they are unsafely trusted who have before
broken the great tie, that to their Country; else he must fly to foreign
help. But on the other side, the free Subjects duly interessed in the State,
loving it, living like men, defend, invade the other, nobly, courageously, as
in heart, and men of honor, and as often for the good of the conquered; with
greater power, as universally to be trusted. Not to insist on riches, the
nerves of War, infinitely increased by industry, so encouraged by industry,
lost by servitude, but what needs more, or indeed so much, if any thing in a
matter so apparent? We now have been rapt sufficiently into the goodly
imaginary heaven, and the glory of it, but with an hell of inextricable
miseries to the Prince and people, which these Gods of the infinite prerogative
pretended, are raising for themselves, through a government at will, but by
such means and in such manner, as shows they believe, or hope for no other
heaven hereafter.

These things being thus, it must follow, that those that oppose the
Parliament, and in it the kingdom, in whom is the supreme power, as reason
has evinced since contestation happening as now between King and people, the
people must carry it, oppose their Country, reason, right, and the truth,
moved by defect of judgment, or worse principles; converting themselves and
their power received from their Country to enable them to serve and defend it,
to the ruin of it, and of all that is precious to men of honor, and
consequently that they are guilty of their own blood, and of all the blood
and miseries which this unnatural monstrous war may cause (a means suitable
indeed to the end they force themselves to compass:) nor can unpartiall
posterity judge of them otherwise, then as Parricidae patriae, and damnatae
memoriae, if all this be not of force with them to descend deeply into
themselves, and to weigh whether they be in state fit for death every moment,
at least they may deigne this last motive the honor of a deep and sad thought,
or two, whether thus obstinately persisting, they contract not before God
another way a guilt to contribute or be accessory to the endangering or
perdition of their own, and innumerable souls in another kind, and more
directly, and highly, there being aliquid sacri in hoc morbo, and Religion
sharing the hazard, as abovesaid: but if the premises have not power to
infer thus much with them, yet I hope at least they are not so irrational,
so extravagant, as that these men can truly believe, that they are only to be
confuted, and those that maintain such tenants to be instructed by a civil
war: but if folly and defect of that reason that should govern men, or a
violent forcing, tyrannizing, and enslaving their reason and conscience by
enormous and monstrous passions, and sins, the two original causes of
slavery, be by no art to be severed from these men, but they must and will by
still persisting apply these two said general causes of servitude,
particularly and expressly, or in a special manner now to draw it upon them, it
is not unlikely most of them, and their posterity and friends may find, and
prove the effect as inseparable from the causes thus redoubled and enforced, as
the causes from themselves, should they be so unhappy as to carry what they by
such means so pursue: and however some dequoy indulgence may be used toward
them, to draw others, till all be in the power of the principal malignants
(the like we may say of their cunning enforcing themselves not yet to declare
all the depth of their malicious intentions toward those they disarme, or any
way get within their power, using them as staiking horses, till by seeming for
the present to leave these in a tolerable condition, they may make others stand
out less resolutely or warily, and so drawing still to them, make all sure at
last, and at their discretion (though even whilst matters are yet dubious, the
infernal are of malice, hate, cruelty, jealousy, and the like, which is in
their hearts, sometimes cannot but flash out in diverse enormous words, or acts)
such present indulgence, I say, notwithstanding of the malignant party, let
not these men think that it having all once at its dispose, and made sure,
will judge it may securely repose on such of the Nation, as have violated
wittingly and willingly the greatest tie on earth, by being traitors to their
Country, or on those that loving their Country, have been violently or
fraudulently disarmed, or on them that not intending the disservice of their
Country, but seduced by specious pretenses, have voluntarily assisted the
malignant party, when time and plain experience shall have disabused these
two sorts, and afford means of redeeming their Country and themselves, will
not the malignants rather have recourse to foreign protection, or forces (an
usual refuge of an arbitrary, or tyrannical government, especially succeeding
and having usurped liberty of the Subject, as abovesaid) under color of being
guards, garrisons, auxiliary forces, joined in league, or the like; as France
uses the Switzers, (the French Nation forsooth not populous or warlike
enough;) It is true, the Spaniard, though not governing at discretion as the
French uses the Switzers also, but not upon jealousy and diffidence of their
own people (for ought I find) as France does, but for want of men or some other
reason of State, and may not many strangers already here also be employed; then
may these Zelots of the Malignants share largely in contributing to the wages
of their foreign Masters, and be put to maintain their own servitude (as they
stood to bring it in) with all their power. But God be praised, these men
unless they speedily come in and make their peace, are on the point rather of
falling under the sword of Justice in the hand of the Parliament: and it is not
to be doubted, but God himself whom they have by sundry passages too notorious
(if we may so speak) made a party against themselves, these Atheists belike
thinking he is grown old, and impotent, and cannot drown these Egyptians in a
red sea of their own blood, if they with diabolical obstinacy go on as Lucian
that old Atheist said of the Pagan gods in his time, because they begot no more
sons and daughters, will resist, and defend himself, and his (were humane
means wanting) against these public oppressors of the people in intention
and endeavor, which they ought to expose their lives to defend, and protect.

And for those that stand already for that Palladium of their Religion and
Country, the Parliament, as they are herein duly sensible of themselves and
honor, so out of the same feeling, they cannot but so lively ardently and
speedily concur with all their power (if need require) when all their
fortunes, and all that is dear to such men lie at stake (and which now nobly
and bravely asserted and vindicated, may for ever be secured, and the roots of
dangers plucked up) that the Scots assistance be not the second time needed
(though in all presumption ready) it being the common cause) to our exceeding
charge, nay dishonor, as if others were more apprehensive of our honor then
our selves, and we needed others to protect or defend our Liberty, or take and
manage our quarrels. And now howsoever we may not share in the putting a period
to the disorders of the State, yet let us think of doing it to this disordered
discourse, wherein though there may not appear manifestly one continued beaten
tracke of coherent passages, to bring you readily to the truth: yet I hope you
have incountred a few points here, and there, not indirect, nor impertinent
thereto; like Posts of direction for Travelers, at each miles end, in some of
our English deserts, to give you aim that you may hold the right way: or
rather like race posts quickly to be run over, lest it might seem to pretend it
self worthy to hold you long. And you may the rather pass by the imperfections
in regard whilst it was endeavored to have ordered and completed it, and to
make all yet clearer, the Antiparliamentary party has so in the interim,
unmasked it self in sight of the world, and given such attestation in plain
matter of fact (a stronger testimony then ^u^ of the mouth of the adversary)
to the prospective and next to prophetic prudence and Judgment of the
Parliament, so long since having penetrated and shined on the secret corners of
their designs, and deeds of darkness, and exposed them to view that there is
little need of any further light, and the defect is rather ^^w in those who
shut their eyes, that they may not see it. We see already our Laws manifestly
conculcated by force and violence, our liberties, properties, lives exposed to
the fury and malice of these desperate Malignants (for which violence they
cannot plead their present necessity, if being grounded and depending on their
oppugning the Parliament unjust in it self as has been showed): the danger of
our Religion and consequently of the Religion abroad, from those, that having
none, would bring in such, as may best suite with their pernicious purposes,
and from the rest of old in direct opposition with it, on all which they are
carried with such desperate ardour and violent fury, as their utmost and last
attempt, that having first in a due method indeed used all machinations to
vilify and difanull the authority and very essence of the Parliament, the
only rampart of Englands happiness, and traverse to their designs, though
God and good men have herein repulst them, yet they cannot temper themselves,
from breaking out into such effects as all the world sees, nor brook any delay
from seizing what part they can meet with of the designed prey, till they may
with less danger of reprisall do it; but it is high time now to leave words
and writing: therefore let us endeavor to conclude this Tractate, almost as
indigested and troubled as the times (like that offer of that poor Country
man, that when the great King Artaxerxes passed by, having nothing else to
present him, before whom none must appear empty handed, ran to a little
troubled water, and thence offered the King what his hand only could contain;
but the troubled present coming from a clear and good intention, and native
hearty ingenuitie, met with a serene, magnanimous, and regal acceptance) but
let us conclude with a point of Judgment not altogether so weak as hitherto
may have appeared; for I would end at least well and leave you with a good
relish (though I appear to begin this point also but ill) which is, that
having above received it as a sacred truth and ground, that no reason shall
ever shake, that the wisdom, and Justice of a Parliament freely, duly, and
lawfully elected is no way to be called in question or doubt, but to be
assuredly believed and confided in, securely reposed upon and held sacred and
inviolable by all that heartily love Englands happiness: I will take heed at
last to be found not fast and true to my grounds, and ends, by presuming (as
some particular private men have done in their we^l otherwise understood
discourses) to offer up any advice (were I otherwise able) or counsel to the
wisdom, or exhortation or persuasion to the Justice of it; and thus my best is
but a negative, a privative, or a nothing: but only yet upon the whole,
inferring or enforcing justly by the power of truth; That it is the part of all
honest men, men of honor that love their Country to obey the Parliament
(taken in that notion our case presents) punctually, to serve it faithfully,
and zealously; to love it with that kind of love, which is morte fortior, to
vindicate, assert, maintain, propugne, clear the authority and safety of it,
as a true collection of all that is or can be most dear, precious, and sacred
to, and with such men, to join unanimously in the clearing England once again
of Wolves, these man-wolves, if reducible by no reason, and not to loose their
share of contributing to such a work; above all ardently to solicit and press
the divine Majesty to inspire, protect, bless, this Congregation of Princes,
this multitudinem Consiliariorum in quibus est salus, and in it our Country
and all. I conclude this discourse, wherein I have spoken my heart, which
nothing, but a lively and dear apprehension of the imminent and extreme
danger of my Country, forced from so unfit a man; raising so violent but
natural and just a passion, as brake the strings of a tongue ever before tied
(and perhaps ever fit to have been so you may say), like that son of Croesus
who before, or born dumb, yet seeing his Father in the very point of being
slain, so natural a passion supplying the place and power of nature, or rather
stronger then it, forcing and clearing all impediments turning dumbness it
self into a strong vociferation; he cried out aloud: Oh man kill not Croesus,
and so notifying him saved him. I need not fear you think so well of me, as
that you would not remember that a similitude does not hold throughout, and to
the last, should I not put you in mind solemnly it does not.

FINIS.
