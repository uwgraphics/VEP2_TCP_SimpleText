The English Fortune Tellers.
Being a brief direction how to shun all strife,
A brief instruction how to choose a wife,
Whereby a man may lead a happy life:
It shows difference in women's qualities,
By color of their hair, both face and eyes,
The tune is, Ragged and Torn, etc.


YOu young men that want skill in wooing
and if you desire to be wed,
Take counsel of me in your doing
for fear that you should be missed.
Do not my kind proffer refuse,
for it will never you deceive:
I will show what women to choose,
and what creature you's best for to leave,
But chiefly i would wish you beware,
of a wench with a rolling eye:
For she that will cozen and swear,
will also dissemble and lie.
In The first place I do you advise,
take one not too high nor too low,
But according to your own size,
that you may her qualities know,
Take one not too young nor too old,
nor one that is too fat nor too lean;
It Is a bad thing to meet with a scold,
it is a worse thing to meet with a Queen.
But chiefly, etc.
Take one that is not too proud,
nor one that is a dirty foul slut,
The one may babble too loud,
the other may poison the gut,
It Is better to wed an honest maid,
although she be never so poor,
Then to wed a rich Gossip it is said,
if afterward she should turn whore,
But chejfly, etc.
A widow whose wealth does surmount,
if that you do marry for gain,
Shoe'l call you to double account,
and your pleasures will turn to your pain:
Besides she is apt to be jealous,
which is the forerunner of strife:
As good to be hanged at the Gallows,
as marry with such a crose wife,
But chiefly, etc.
And now in the second place I
am purposed for to recite,
My skill in Phystognomy,
wherein I will show you alight:
By The color of hair on the head,
or else by the favor or face,
You may know with whom for to wed;
and who you were best to embrace.
But chiefly, etc.
The man that will choose him a mate,
by color of Hair or complexion,
Must use many ways intricate,
lest he be brought under subjection,
He must veiw both her forehead and brow
her Cheeks, Eyes, Nose, and her-Chin.
Good Cupid those things does allow,
when you first to woo her begin,
But chiefly, etc.
All is not gold which Glisters,
nor is it all lead that looks dull,
Fair Venus the chief of the Sisters,
made Vulcan her husband a Gull,
So many times beautiful Lasses,
will jeer their poor husbands in scorn,
And cunningly break all their Glasses.
and make them drink out of the Horn.
But chiefly, etc.
She that has her hair of bright yellow,
and traces the wyers of Gold,
If she meet with some pretty fellow
her husband may chance to be Cuckold,
And she that by nature's composed,
of round Cherry-cheeks and red hair,
If she be pink-ey'd and long nosed,
believe me it is dangerous ware,
But chiefly, etc.
The brown hair with witty discourse,
but commonly for her own ends;
I like her a great deal the worse,
because she will dissemble with her friends.
A Wench with an ash colored face,
her actions are often uncivil;
Her tongue will her husband disgrace,
just like the second She-devil.
But chiefly, etc.
The bonny Wench with the black-brow,
oh she is a good one indeed:
For she will be true to her vow:
I would we had more of her breed:
And thus I have told you my mind,
concerning Phystognomy,
I mean no wrong to women kind,
I swear by my honesty.
Lest I should some female offend,
I Will lay by my pen and rest,
What ever in this Ditty is penned,
let young men take where they love best.
Yet thus much i will speak, in regard,
and i will maintain my words in a trice,
Some women may well be compared,
to the best chance or worst of the Dice,
Suppose a young man goes to Dice,
and do venture his goods and his store,
If he can throw Cinque or a Size,
the games his own for evermore:
But if that his fortune be crossed,
that he throws but a Dewee or an Ace,
His goods and his substance is lost,
and he is left in a pitiful case,
Suppose in like case, if a Lad,
can get him a provident wife,
His fortune can never be bad,
he is made all the days of his life:
But if that dame-fortune do frown,
that his wife and he cannot agree,
He is quite for ever cast down,
by woeful experience we see.
And now noble Young Men adieu,
remember the words which I say:
This songs like to prove to be true,
then buy it and bear it away.
