Spiritual wickedness, in Heavenly places, proclayming Freedom to the Form,
but persecuting the Power: Or an Answer to a Book entitled, Freedom of
Religious Worship: Or, The Jubilee of Ordinances, set forth without a Name.
A Book being brought to my hand, entitled, Freedom of Religious Worship; or,
The Jubilee of Ordinances, no Name I find at it; yet the spirit I know, and
from whence it has its rise; who seems to have horns like a Lamb, but has
the mouth of a Dragon, speaking great swelling words as though he would make
fire come down from Heaven in the sight of men, telling of great things that
shall be, an appearance of Christ to come, he knows not when, but like the
Jews, is become an open persecuter of him, where he is made manifest; yet would
he cover over his poison under a pretense of not persecuting for conscience;
yet by lies and slanders, seeks to make him odious, because of the plainness
of them, in whom he is: and what they do in true obedience, he calls
pretenses. And out of a busy mind, sits as judge upon many things he knows
nothing of; but what he knows naturally, having not the spirit that was in the
Apostles (as he himself confesses) and though he have not that spirit which is
infallible; yet judge he will, and by his judgment, all shall escape who are
of his mind, or will own him for a leader; but if any do outstrip him in
obedience to Christ, in things that are against his Kingdom, and beyond his
wisdom and carnal reason, such shall be punished with whips, fines, and
prisons; now though all the children of light, may easily judge from whence
this partial spirit is, yet least his fair words should beguile the simple,
to take a wolf for a lamb, I shall for the truths sake, uncover his deceits
in some few things, that by these, he who will see, may judge of the rest; for
he who is found with a lie in his mouth, cannot be of the truth, and such are
not to be believed in matters of Faith. And thou begins thy Book, with telling
what great things God has done for this Nation, and how many houses of state
and honor, and palaces of delight Christ has in it. I answer, the first is
true, great things has God done for this Nation, which being forgotten, shall
rise up in judgment against it. But for the second, it is but thy swelling
words, for in those thou calls his houses of state and honor, and palaces of
delight, they who see with the light of Christ, sees every one hunting after
his own honor and state, worshipping, and seeking worship one of another, and
treading under foot humility, which is the honor of Christ, and Christ takes
no delight to dwell in such palaces; and were thou not blind, thou should see
more cause herein to mourn, then to boast. Thou tells of the work of Christ in
this Nation; then compares it to a Picture with a double face, on the one side
with the face of a beautiful Virgin, of the other side, the face of an ugly
Owl; But this is thy double eye, which shall never see into the work of
Christ, who says it seems ugly; but this is thy confusion, who art blind, for
who sees into his works, witness them holy perfect. Thou says, godly men in all
ages have put to their shoulders to uphold some piece of Antichrist. I answer,
That is thy work, who would punish with whips, fines, and prisons, such as are
sent to discover Antichrist, and to declare the word of the Lord in your
Synagogues, and calls it disturbance; and here thou would not hold up part, but
all Antichrists Kingdom, who would not have any to discover him where he is;
and thou who would give the title of godly to men, while they are upholding
Antichrist, would put a fair color on a wicked work; and here thou appears
to be of the serpent, painting the outside, who would be counted God-like, but
acts for the Kingdom of Satan, but such godly men shall have their reward
according to their work. Thou tells of the Scribes and Pharisces, who seemed to
long after the coming of the Messiah in the Flesh, of whom they were the
greatest opposers; but cannot see thy self that Pharisee, who while thou art
talking of his personal appearance in another age, thou know not when, art
for whipping, fining, and imprisoning the bodies of them, in whom Christ is
made manifest in spirit; and here thou art Antichrist, who denies Christ at
present to be come in the flesh, and would put him a far off, to another day,
telling of glorious days to come, but at present art an enemy to him, and an
open persecuter of him, and knows not him who is the same Christ to day,
yesterday, and for ever, to all who will receive him. Thou say, for a wicked
man to impose upon a godly man, is tyrannical; and yet thou would have some
whipped, fined, and imprisoned, for obeying the commands of Christ, which thou
calls disturbance; and here thou art that wicked tyrant, that would impose upon
the righteous. Thou say, all Governments are alike lawful by Gods word. I
answer, Gods word ownes no Government but that which is according to it, just
and righteous; and though his saints may suffer under unrighteous governments,
yet are not such governments lawful by Gods word; but God has sent, and does
send his word by his servants to declare against such governments; and here
thou belyest the word of God, which is pure and just, and condemns all that is
unjust and unholy; and by the word shall all Governors be judged, which word
is but one, and does comply with no man's will, though such as thou may wrest
the letter to your own destruction; yet the word stands a witness against you
for ever. And thou say, some blasphemously question whother the Scripture be
the word of God. I answer, The Scripture it self says, God is the word, and
the word was in the beginning before the letter was; but it does not say, the
letter is the word, which has been, and may be altered, which had a beginning,
and shall have an end; and this thou say, is eternal: and here all that
knows any thing of the word shall witness thee a liar; and I charge thee to
prove, if thou can, that any of the holy men of God, to whom the word came,
had it from the letter, or out of a Book; but they who were the false prophets
which God never spoke to, stole what was spoken to others their neighbors, and
called that the word, as you do; but says the Lord, I am against such, and
such are false Prophets now, and thieves, and knows not the word, nor the
door, and God is against you, and you shall not escape. Thou say, The
weapons of the Gospel are wooings, and beseechings; and yet thou would have
some whipped, fined, and imprisoned; and here thou art Babylon, and it is not to
be heeded what thou say. Thou say, none but the Pope and Quakers pretend
a spirit of infallibility, such as was in the Apostles; when as the Scripture
says, That all the gifts of the saints are by one, and the same spirit; and by
one spirit were they all Baptized; and he that is joined to the Lord is one
spirit; and here I charge thee in the presence of the Lord to be a seducer, and
Antichrist, and led by a spirit of error, who has not that infallible spirit
which was in the Apostles, for whosoever has not that spirit, is Antichrist;
and this is the cause why so many lies and confusions are found in thy mouth,
because thou art not guided by that spirit of truth, which leads into all truth
which was in the Apostles, and in all the saints, but art led by thy own
imaginations, and serpents wisdom, from whom the things of God are hid; and
thou beast, and false prophet, who have not that spirit which was in the
Apostles, by which the Scriptures were given forth, and by which the saints are
guided; what have thou to do to sit as Judge of the saints? or what they do
in obedience to that spirit thou knows not? or to interpret any Scriptures? for
no Scripture is of any private interpretation; and thou that has not that
spirit, have a private spirit, and thy interpretions are private, and for thy
private ends; and against thy generation is the Book sealed, and you see but
the outside, and out of pride and a busy mind would guide others, but are
blind your selves, and being told of it, calls it railing, which is the truth
in plainnes, as one day you shall be forced to confess it against thy self,
as now thou confestest in thee much darkness; and yet thou will be judging the
children of light. Thou say, It is the mark of Christ's sheep to suffer
persecution, not to persecute; here be thou witness against thy self, that thou
art none of Christ's sheep, who talks of whipping, finings and imprisoning any,
for obeying Christ, which thou calls disturbance, and who would have them
publicly whipped, whom God has commanded to go naked, as signs to you who
live in your pride and excess; and thou enemy of God had thou lived in
Isayahs time, who was made a sign in the same kind, he should have had no
better censure from thee for obeying God, then these have. And thou say,
this follows their conceited perfection, the great Idol of their profession;
if they be but perfect as Adam, they may go naked as Adam, and throw away
their clothes, as they do Ordinances: And here thou show what spirit acts
in thee; which of them have thou known to go naked, upon that account, that is
to say, perfection? or which of them have thrown away their clothes to go
naked, but having done what they were commanded, have put on their clothes
again: neither do they it of custom, or by their own wills; and what
Ordinances of Christ have they thrown away? and here I charge thee before the
Lord to be a liar, and a false accuser of the brethren, till thou prove what
thou have said: and thou that calls perfection (that which God requires of all
his) an Idol, here I charge thee to be a blasphemer, and an enemy to the
commands of God, and a persecuter of them that obey him, and the hand of God
thou shall not escape, thou envious one, who talks of whipping the saints, and
yet for a cover would seem to write against persecution; O thou full of
subtilty, thy covers cannot hide thee; which of the saints did ever talk of
whipping their brethren, fining, and imprisoning them? And thou say, to
disturb any in the time of their worship, as the Quakers do, is justly
punishable; never any of the Apostles did practice it in the Jewish Synagogues,
or Heathenish-Temples. I answer, any one being moved of the Lord to come into
the Assemblyes in a peaceable way, to declare the word of the Lord, and to
gather souls out of your Idolatrous Forms, into the worship in spirit; you
that call this a disturbance, are worse then the Heathen, who heard the
Apostles, and counted it no disturbance; and by this means were the Churches of
the saints gathered from among the Heathen. And thou that say, none of the
Apostles did ever practice this; plain Scripture shall witness thee a liar;
for does it not say plainly, Paul as his manner was, went into the Jewish
Synagogues three Sabbath days, reasoning, opening and alleging the things of
Christ, Acts 17 And the Apostles went into the Temple, and spoke boldly, after
they were threatened and charged to speak no more in that name, by such
persecuters as thou art, Acts 15. And here thou art proved a liar before all
people, who reads the practice of the Apostles and matters not what thou says,
true or false, so thou can but make the practice of the Saints odious, and
thereby keep up thy false worship, that none be suffered to lay it open from
the Lord, but calls it a disturbance, and breaking of the peace, who comes in
peace to declare truth; but those who beat, stone, mock, and shamefully
entreat such and imprison them, while they move not a hand against any, these
are counted no offenders by those of thy generation; but you punish the
innocent, and lets the guilty go free; and for this shall you be accountable
before the Lord, when he comes to enquire after blood. And thou say, a
carnal ministry may convert souls; whereas God says, I sent them not, and
therefore they shall not profit the people; and here thou art one of them who
holds up the false Prophets, and a carnal Ministry whom Christ never sent,
and such did always hate and persecute the true Ministers of God; and as thou
pleads for a carnal Ministry, so thou holds up carnal Ordinances; but who
holds up the carnal, knows not the spiritual worship; and thou who art born
after the flesh, persecutes him who is born after the spirit, and the Scripture
is fulfilled upon thee. Thou say, the children of the world, have more
necessary qualifications to all governments, then the children of light; and
the Jews had a command from God, to appoint godly Magistrates, yet were their
Magistrates most hideous oppressors. I answer, here thou show thy
profaneness, who prefers the wisdom of man in matters of Government, before
the light of God; and it is plain to all, that thou knows not the guiding of
the light of God, nor the worth of it, but art contrary to God, the Scriptures,
and all good men, for says God, They that take counsel, and not of me, shall
not stand; and all that ever governed well, had their council from the spirit
of God; as appears in David, Solomon, and all the Kings of Judea: and when they
took council at any thing else, then they fell; and the Scripture says, When
the righteous are in authority, then the people rejoice; but when the wicked
bear rule, the people mourn: And said David, in thy light shall I see light;
and I set thy Law before my face, therefore I shall never be moved; and the Law
of God is perfect, teaching the simple. And whereas thou say, The Jewish
Magistrates were most hideous oppressors, was that as they were godly men, and
children of the light? Thou blind sot, does the light of God teach oppression?
art not thou ashamed to call the Scriptures, A standing rule, and yet holds out
things quite contrary to it? wherefore silence, thou child of darkness, who
have not that spirit that was in the Apostles, which spirit gave forth the
Scriptures; but by that spirit, and the Scripture, art thou condemned and
proved a liar. And thou says, You are not yet come to the first resurrection,
to the new Heaven, and the new Earth, wherein dwells righteousness: And here,
be thou witness against thy self, and thy Church, who are yet in the fall, and
habitation of unrighteousness, a cage of unclean birds, where the old Earth
and Heaven is yet standing; but the Church of Christ is an habitation of
holiness; and where he dwells, there dwells righteousness, who witness the
resurrection, and all things made new, and the old put off; and how fit, thou
that art in death, and has not that spirit of life, and infallibility in
judgment raised up in thee, to sit as Judge over the living, let all who are
alive judge; for the resurrection shall judge of the dead, but the dead cannot
judge it; and here thou art shut out from all the churches of the living God,
who are builded on living stones, but thou in death, and cannot witness the
resurrection, and death speaks in thee, and the serpent, and the curse of God
is upon thy head; thou that art in death, tells of great things that shall be
from the letter, but being ignorant of the spirit, cannot see how great things
are present, to them who can receive it; and when thou have done, thou begins
to revile the Quakers, (the object of thy malice) and says, They ignorantly
and ridiculously affirm, that the Scriptures are fulfilled in them. I answer,
Is not Christ the end of all Scriptures? and where he is come, and manifest,
are they not fulfilled in whom he is, who is the end of Law and Gospel, whereof
thou art ignorant, who puts it off till the next age, as thy fathers have
always done? but the children of light see him present now, and hear his
voice to day; but thou who denies the light, art hardened through thy pride and
riches, and cannot enter, neither would thou suffer others; and woe unto thee,
who would shut up the Kingdom against this generation, for if thou should live
in the next generation, it would be still to come a generation further; and
here thou art the blind Pharisee, who looks still for a Christ to come, but
reviles and persecutes them where he is made manifest: and in thy high
excelling of the letter, thou say, That one blessed notion of the Gospel, is
more glorious and ravishing, then ten thousand of revelations: Here thou
appears to be ignorant of God, and that way by which all the saints ever came
to know him: for Christ says, None knows the Father, but to whom the Son
reveals him: and prove if thou can, that ever any came to know God by
notion, or by any other way, but by revelation. And thou say, After the Book
of Revelations, let us look for no more revelations of that kind: And here you
would limit God, that none should ever hear his voice any more, but in the
letter what he spoke to others; and I declare thee to be a liar, and a
notionist, by thy own confession, and knows nothing of God, but what thou have
in notion: but I witness the voice of God, and Revelation, without which I had
never known God but by hearsay, as thou do; and thou worships thou knows
not what, who knows not God but in notion, for God is a spirit, and is neither
known, nor worshipped in notion, but in spirit; and here thou art shut out from
the saints of God, who has always made himself known to his in spirit; but
thy God is only known in notion; and if there had been no notion, thou had
had no God; but our God is known before the letter was. And in thy next page,
thou say, Its the great project of Satan in these days, to send out new
Emissaries, as Waiters, Notionists, Quakers: And here be thou witness against
thy self, that thou art one of his emissaries, and sent out by him, who art a
Notionist, whom all that wait on God (and those thou calls Quakers) denies, and
out of thine own mouth be thou judged that thou art of the Devil, who art a
notionist, and a liar, and a false accuser, as is proved in thy writing in
sundry things: And thou who art a notionist, and have not the spirit which was
in the Apostles, say, thou will take liberty to show some of our Principles,
and according to that spirit that acts in thee, so thou speaks and takes
liberty to lie and slander. And thou say, We slight the commands of Christ,
as Water-Baptisme; which is a lie, for the Baptism of John we own, and the
Baptism of Christ we own, which thou knows not, who has not that spirit that
was in the Apostles. And thou say, that Water-Baptisme binds to all other
commands of Christ; and that is another lie, for the spirit binds and unites to
God and his commands, and not outward water; for thou have had outward water,
and yet keeps not his commands, who art a liar and a slanderer, as is plainly
proved, and hundreds who know us shall witness it against thee. Thou say, We
deny the Lords supper: and that is a third lie; for the Supper of the Lord we
own, and the Bread that came down from Heaven. Thou say, We deny
Church Fellowship, and Sabbaths: which we own the Church of Christ, the Church
of the Firstborn, the pillar and ground of truth, and we have fellowship
therein, which thou knows not, who art not come to the first resurrection: and
the everlasting Sabbath we own, and are rested from our own works; and here
thou have added two lies more. Thou say, We deny the flesh of Christ, and the
resurrection, which we own, which resurrection thou art not yet come to, by
thine own confession, and these make up the number of seven lies; and here thou
art a perfect liar, and slanderer, and false accuser. And whereas thou says, It
was the maine Doctrine of the Apostles, that the same flesh of every man and
woman shall arise; here thou dealest with the Apostle, as thou do with us;
where does he say the same? but he says, thou fool, that which thou sowest is
not the same that shall be, but God gives it a body as pleases him; it is
sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body: and this I say brethren,
that flesh and blood shall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, for we shall be
changed, 1 Cor. 15. and here the Scripture witnesses, that thou belyes the
Apostle, as thou do us. And thou scoffs at immediate commands, which we own,
and all the saints and holy men of God, shall witness with us against thee;
which of them had their commands from any other, but, from God, whose voice is
immediate? and they did not walk by tradition, or from the commands that had
bin given to others, sought out of the letter, as thou do, but had their
particular immediate commands, which they obeyed. And thou scoffs at a Christ
within, a Word within, a Baptism within, a Sabbath within; and here thou
show thy self to be a reprobate, without, and carnal in all these things,
and not to have the saints Christ who was in them the hope of glory; but thy
Christ is without thee, unborn or formed in thee, and thou looks not for him
till the next generation: the saints word was within them, in the heart, and in
the mouth, and this is the word of faith which the Apostles Preached; but thy
word is without thee in a book which is dead: The saints Baptism was by one
spirit into one body, not the washing away of the filth of the flesh, but the
answer of a good conscience; but thine is without, in carnal water; the saints
were entered into the spiritual sabbath, Christ Jesus, but thine is without,
in observing of days, in the type, and so denies Christ come in the flesh, and
this is Antichrist: and here thou art without in carnal rudiments, but the
saints within in spiritual worship; and all who are spiritual, judges thee
who art carnal, but thou can not judge the spiritual man, but art without
in the world among the heathen, and in thy imaginations, who has not that
spirit to guide thee which was in the Apostles: and thou art the beast which
have another spirit that was not in the Apostles, but is contrary to it, and
therefore thou makes war with the saints, and the false Prophet that denies the
immediate voice of God, and say, thus says the Lord, when the Lord never spoke
to thee; and the beast and false prophet must into the lake, there is thy
portion. Thou scoffs at perfection, mortification, and freedom from sin in
this life, which was the end of Christ's coming, and that which the saints
pressed after, and witnessed, and which God commands; and here thou shows thy
self to be an enemy to Gods commands, Christ's coming, and the saints
practice, and to be an upholder of the Devils Kingdom, who cannot endure to
hear of sin going down, and mortification while men live, but concludes all
must live in sin, and serve the Devil while they live, and deny the Devil, and
serve God when they are dead, for they cannot serve both at once, and this is
thy judgment, who have not that spirit that was in the Apostles. Thou say, we
lay claim to five great points of Popery, poverty, infallibility, unity,
revelations, selfe-righteousnesse, or perfection. I answer,
selfe-righteousnesse we deny, and witness the righteousness of Christ; but thou
who calls poverty, infallibility, unity, revelation, and perfection, points of
Popery, shows what religion thou art of, who denies poverty, when the saints
were many of them poormen, and had no certain dwelling places. Lazarus a poor
man, but thou art Dives, (read thy figure) and counts it Popery to be poor:
the saints were guided by an infallible spirit, but thou art led by the spirit
of error, and yet out of a busy mind, would be a Judge over the infallible
spirit, and calls is Popery. The saints lived in unity, were all of one heart,
and one mind, and one soul, and this thou calls Popery; but thou art scoffing
Ishmael, thy hand against every man, villifying all but thy self, and art an
enemy to the spirit of unity, and denies thy religion to stand in unity. And
the saints had their revelations, by which they knew God and his will: And
Christ says, No man knows the Father, but he to whom the Son reveals him;
and here thou art witnessed that thou knows not God, who denies revelation, and
calls it Popery, and have thy knowledge by hearsay from others. The saints
winessed perfection, and pressed after it, and God witnesses it, and Christ
commanded it, which thou calls Popery, and thou might as well say, Christ
taught Popery. Thou says, we care for believing no more, then that which is
immediately given in and revealed to us, and this thou calls, Popish Ignorance.
I answer, we witness no other Faith, but what is the gift of God, and this is
that Faith the saints witness in Scriptures, and by this Faith we have
received of God, do we deny thee and thy faith which thou have fetched, in
which thou never received of God, which is the Worlds faith; and by this faith
thou never received from God art thou given up to believe lies, and tell lies;
for every good and perfect gift comes from above: but thy faith, which is
from below, is earthly, no better then the faith of Infidels, which is not
received from God: and here let all take heed how they believe thee, whose
faith is not given to thee of God, and thy religion is discovered, who believes
that which thou never received from God; and that belief which is not received
of God, is of the Devil. And thou tells of trying the spirits, and things that
differ, according to that great Canon of the Apostles: But where does the
Scripture tell of the Apostles Canon? but such Antichrists words are most
suitable to that Kingdom of Antichrist wherein thou art. And thou say, try
the spirits, that is, hold them up in the Sun beams of Scripture, the only
touchstone of Doctrine: but these are thy own words, which thou adds, by
another spirit then that which was in the Apostles, by which thou would exclude
that spirit; but thou who have not that spirit, must cry up such as thou have,
the letter for the spirit; which letter, thou have nothing to do withal, who
have not that spirit that gave it forth, and therefore prefers the letter
before the spirit, and calls it, the original of all truth; but knows not that
truth which was before the the letter was written, but art a liar, and calls
the letter the Written Word, not knowing that Word from which the letter was
Written; which word is spiritual, and not carnal, the original of all
things; and it is the spirit that searches, and tries all things, and not the
letter; and thou who have not that spirit that was in the Apostles, art telling
how people come to fall into great evils, and of preservatives against evils,
but cannot see thy self in the great evil, and in the fall, who art not come
to the resurrection, nor the habitation of righteousness, who have not the
spirit of God which is infallible, nor have received that which thou believe
from God; and thou who art not come to the first resurrection, death speaks in
thee: And how can thou teach others the way of life? Wherefore silence, thou
that art in the grave, with thy earnall Christ, carnal Word, carnal Faith,
which has not received it of God; carnal Baptism, carnal Ordinances, and
carnal spirit, which are all without thee: cease thy prattling, thou bysie
body, til thou come to witness him who is invisible, before all these carnal
things were, and in whom they are all swallowed up, finished, and ended; for
thou who cannot witness Christ revealed in thee, cannot Preach him; and thou
who cannot witness Christ come in the flesh, at present, art Antichrist, and
would be a Master or Teacher of others but knows not what thou speaks, nor
whereof thou affirms. And for the marks that leads into the great evil thou
speaks of, they are in thy self, and (blind guide) thou cannot see them: and
thou would be teaching vvayes to keep others out of evil, when as thou art
in the evil, and in the fall, and knows not the way out, nor the
resurrection: Wherefore thou hypocrite, look to the beam in thine own eye
first, for thou knows not what spirit thou art of; but have the spirit of envy
at the innocent, arising from a blind zeal, from which thou speaks evil of
that thou knows not; and thou art set on fire of Hell, and art in the gall of
bitterness, and bonds of iniquity: Wherefore repent, and turn in thy mind to
that which would lead thee to do as thou would be done by; and if thou
mind it, it will still thy busy mind, and bring thee into judgment for all
thy hard speeches thou have blasphemously spoken against the spirit of God, and
his people, least he take thee away in his wrath, and judge thee according to
the secret envy which is in thy Heart, against his despised ones, and then had
thou better never a been borne.

This is no railing, but plain dealing, and in love to thy soul, as one day
thou shall be forced to confess against thy self.
