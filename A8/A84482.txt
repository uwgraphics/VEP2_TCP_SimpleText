By the Council of State. A PROCLAMATION.
THe Council of State having received Information, That since the escape made
out of the Tower of London, by Colonel John Lambert, a Person of loose
principles, and reduced, by his own miscarriages, into a desperate Fortune, he
does endeavor without any color of Authority, to Rendevouz such of the
Soldiers, and others, as, by falsehood and misinformation he can withdraw
from their obedience, and to engage them to a conjunction with him, in order to
the raising of a New War, the Embroiling the Nation in Blood, and Distractions,
the making of disturbances in opposition to the present Government, as the same
is established, and the hindering of the Members from Meeting in the next
Parliament, on whose Free Counsels, under God, the hopes of settling these
Nations do principally depend: They do therefore hereby Declare the Actions and
Proceedings of the said Colonel John Lambert, to be High Treason, and himself,
for the same, a Traitor. And do strictly Charge, Require, and Command all, and
every Person and Persons, adhering to, and joining with him, in such his
Treasonable Attempts and Endeavors, forthwith to withdraw and separate from
him at his, and their uttermost perils: And the Council do further Declare,
That whatsoever person or persons, of what condition or quality soever he or
they be, whether Soldiers, or others, shall presume after the Publication
hereof, to join with, or Assist him therein, All, and every such person and
persons, shall be reputed guilty of High Treason, and incur the Pains and
Penalties, which by Law, are to be inflicted on Traitors; And his, and their
Estates shall be forthwith Seized and Sequestered to the use of the
Commonwealth. And that every person* who has been so far deluded, as to adhere
to, and join with him therein, and shall not within twenty four hours after the
Publication hereof, in the County or Place where such Person or Persons are or
shall be, wholly desert and withdraw from Him, and his Party, submit to the
Present Authority, and render himself to the Governor of the next Garrison, or
Commander in Chief of the next Forces of this Commonwealth, under the obedience
of the present Government, Quartering in the Country where such person shall
at that time be, All, and every such person and persons, shall incur the same
Pains, Penalties, and Sequestration, and be proceeded against, as aforesaid.
And all the Militia Forces of this Commonwealth, and all other well-affected
Persons whatsoever, are required to be Aiding and Assisting in the surprising
and subduing of the said John Lambert, and all such as shall be Accomplices
with, or Adhere to, and Assist him in his said Treasonable Practices, or any
others that shall in any part appear in Arms, without Authority from the
Parliament, the Council of State, or General.

Given at the Council of State at Whitehall, this one and twentieth day of
April, 1660.
