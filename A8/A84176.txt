EVERY MAN'S CASE: Or, A brotherly Support to Mr. LARNER, Prisoner in the new
Prison in Mayden-lane.
My true Friend and Brother,
BY Reason of your Sufferings, I am much sadded, especially to consider, that
good men should still be subject to the Tyranny of the late High Commission
Promoters, and Informers, the Stationers, through whose malice, both You and
your Servants are thus Imprisoned: We have known and observed them a long
time, how they have been a naughty and vexatious people to all Good Men, as
mischievous as any Pattentees in England: In the Bishops, times, they were like
Setting-Dogges, to hunt Good Men and Women into the Star Chamber, and
High Commission Netts; and we see, it is to little purpose to put down those
Courts, and not Punish those wicked men; for they hate all that are honest in
their hearts, because they that are honest, are against their Patent: and
therefore they studdy night and day: how to undo them, and are like Mothes in
the State, creeping into employment, upon pretext of doing great service, but
indeed, being corrupt themselves, endeavor to make others so too, and mislead
them that give care to them, into such courses, as will in time make them
odious to the: World, so true it is, that those that touch Pitch, shall be
defiled therewith.

And such as they have been, such they continue, for without doubt, they are
the principal cause why this inhumaine course of examining men upon
Intergatories is continued, especially in criminal causes, notwithstanding it
has been so cried out upon by Parliaments, by Martyrs, Ministers, and all true
Christian Lawyers, as a thing against the Laws of God, of Nature, Nations, and
of this Kingdom, (as was faithfully pleaded the other day in Colonel Lilburns
case, at the Lords Bar,) in which Case, and likewise in another of greater
moment, about a Petition rejected by their Lordships, their Lordships have
dealt so Nobly, and Worthily, as has put their Honors past all hurt or
blemish, from such Paper-pellets, as have unhappily occasioned your sufferings:
And if all other Parties, intimated in that Paper, (Londons last Warning,)
prove when they are tried, as their Lordships have done, the Author will have
cause to repent his too hasty Zeal. And certainly their Honors had past it
over, and had not insisted thus upon you, but upon the Stationers instigation,
and misinformation; and will not persist to examine Free Commoners, ex Officio,
nor Servants against their Masters, against their Wills: all sorts of People,
great and small, ought to do as they would be done by; and God by his
Providence fails not first or last, to render measure for measure; Therefore
I hope, their Lordships will give ear no longer to the malicious suggestions,
and insinuations of wicked men, but upon consideration of your faithfulness to
the Parliament, the affliction of your Wife, and family; and that a small time
of imprisonment may undo you and them, they will not retain you longer, but
set you free, and look upon the Stationers, as Cankers of the Commonwealth,
and destructive to all true Honor.

However, you do well to stand in the Liberty, wherein God, and the Law of the
Land has made you free, and not to be entangled with any yoke of bondage; the
greatest whereof, is for a man to be bound to Accuse himself, or another: and
next thereunto, is to be enforced, to be Tried otherwise then by his Peers or
Equals, in both which, you have carried your self like a true Englishman,
choosing rather to suffer imprisonment, and great affliction, then betray your
native Liberties, and the Liberties of your Country, for which, all good People
will ever love and respect you, and all others, who have done, or shall do, as
you have done herein.

Pilate is the first we read of, that endeavored this cruel distorting of the
mind, saying to our Blessed Savior; I charge thee: by the Everlasting God,
tell us who thou art; a bad President for Christians to follow: and strange it
is, it should be owned by any but Star Chamber, High Commission, or
Pattentee-Christians, far be it from any that would truly deserve that holy
Name, to own so unholy a practice, and if any favor thereof, be to be found
in any of our Legal Trials, though it be but to Answr Guilty, or not Guilty,
as it came, and crept in by Tyranny, (for those who know the Truth, know it to
be so,) so ought it to be totally excluded by those, who would be esteemed true
Christian Lawmakers, or Reformers.

The Lords, by the instigation of the Stationers, have taken offense against
you, wherein themselves are Partees, and if there were no other Reason, it is
most unequal, they should be your Judges: But the Law of the Land is express,
That you a Commoner, are not to be adjudged of Life, Limb or Liberty, but by
Commoners, who are your Peers, and that upon sufficient Testimony of honest and
faithful Witnesses, face to face, in open Court. Friend, you are upon a sure
ground, for these things are so essential, to the Freedom of the People, as
Parliaments will never alter them; nor I hope, act contrary to them.

And therefore, however the Commons in Parliament, have (upon misinformation,)
delivered you up to the Lords, to be tried by them, yet may they as well
transfer all the Power they are entrusted with, by the generality of all the
Commoners of England, and refer the whole Government, to the sole disposing
of the Lords. And indeed, they have done little less in this act, then
delivered us all up to the Lords, for there is the same equity for their trying
and Imprisoning me, and so of every man, as for their trying and imprisoning
you; So that your case in this particular, Is every man's Case, though
generally, men are so sottish, as to be sensible of the lash, then, only when
it falls upon their own backs, not considering, That they may suffer to morrow
that misery and calamity, which to day their Brother groans under. I hope
therefore, upon better consideration, the House of Commons will take you to
their own Protection, and deal with you, as is justly due to every Commoner,
and not hold you in Prison, unless by faithful and credible Witnesses, they
find by the Law of the Land, you are guilty of a crime deserving the same.

And that most be no small one, for believe it, our Forefathers esteemed
Imprisonment no small Punishment. Frequent Imprisonment, is an effect of
exorbitant Power, by which, sooner then by any other means, plain and mean
People are brought to stoop to the Wills of the Mighty: it being the way to
destroy them, their Wives, and Families, by keeping them from their trades,
husbandry, and other Callings: and has served more then any one thing to
break the Spirits of the people: being a subtle politic punishment, that
makes, and keeps men tame, and fit for slavery, whereas all other punishments,
if injurious, makes people wild, and therefore this has been practiced by
those that have most encroached upon the Liberties of the English, as will
appear by Proceedings of foarty or threescore years last past in Court, City,
and all Countries, every trifle has been sufficient to procure an
Imprisonment, and the Land groaneth under this intolerable burden still. But
of all other Testimonies of our Bondage, Close Imprisonment is the most
manifest: where a man shall be kept from the sight of his Friends, and
Comforters in his bonds, and in a ghastly apprehension of he knows not what
mischief may befall him, as has formerly happened to diverse great men, (that
might be instanced in,) by means of the advantage wicked men have taken from
the opportunity of safely doing mischief to a Close Prisoner. Next to the
Rack, and Torture, certainly this is the most unchristian, unmanly, and
irrational usage of Freemen, and will we hope, in this time of Reformation;
be utterly banished out of this Land: Never had Parliament such an opportunity
as this has; Nor are we to doubt, but they will perform the same: and I
should be glad to see some fruit thereof in their bearing toward you. And that
they would look back upon the Stationers (and all other Monopolizers,) and
remember them, when they shall make suit to have the Printing of the Bible, or
for other favors, that they have dealt treacherously with the Parliament, and
have ministered occasion of much trouble and vexation to them, and many of their
most faithful Friends, being as the Amalekites were to the Israelites in their
Passage from Egyptian bondage, to the Freedom of Canaan. God, I trust, will at
length remember them, and will also, I trust, deliver you out of the power of
their malice, and recompense you a hundred fold for these your Sufferings. The
Commons in Parliament have a right in you, which they cannot disclaim, other
Judges you have not; it is most unequal you should have other, as I could in
few lines demonstrate, past all denial; but I will not do it now, and I hope,
I shall not have further occasion to visit you in this kind; I do not desire
it; I heartily wish you at home with your Family, as knowing a little longer
imprisonment, may prove your utter overthrow: which would very much afflict the
Spirits of your faithful Friends, and would not be for the honor or profit of
any. However, comfort your self in GOD, and be well assured, he will never
leave you, nor forsake you; And when the memories of those Officious men, that
solicit against you, shall be odious to all good men; you will be remembered,
as one that knew and maintained the just Liberties of England, and shrunk not
in time of Trial.
