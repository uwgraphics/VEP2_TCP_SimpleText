A DECLARATION OF THE LORDS and COMMONS assembled IN PARLIAMENT.
WHereas the King, seduced by wicked counsel, does make War against His
Parliament and People; And for the promoting of that War, diverse Forces both of
Horse and Foot have been, and are levied and raised by several persons, and
His Majesty's good Subjects are most cruelly robbed, spoiled and slain:

To the end that no man may be misled through Ignorance, the Lords and Commons
in Parliament declare, That all such persons as shall, upon any pretense
whatsoever, assist His Majesty in this War, with Horse, Arms, Plate or Money,
are Traitors to His Majesty, the Parliament and the Kingdom, and shall be
brought to condign punishment for so high an offense.

Ordered by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, That this Declaration be
forthwith printed and published.

Hen. Elsynge, Cler. Parl. D. Com.
