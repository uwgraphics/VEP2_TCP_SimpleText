A LETTER FROM A PROTESTANT IN IRELAND, TO A MEMBER OF The House of COMMONS in
ENGLAND. Upon occasion of the TREATY in that Kingdom.

Printed, 1643.

SIR,
THat you have no sooner received an answer to yours of the fourth of the last
Month, you must impute to the length thereof and weight of the Argument, which
J was resolved to communicate to those upon whose Affections and Judgments you
principally rely of any in this place; and of their Approbation and consent to
your Proposition and your Reasons, J cannot give you such an account as I
presume you expect, for I must tell you, as you of London grow more elate in
your style and mention of us here, as a poor people totally at your devotion,
and to be preserved or ruined as you please to vouchsafe your consideration of
us; so our sufferings and our wants have given us so much Courage and Pride,
that we look upon you as our equals, too negligent and unmindfull of your
fellow Subjects: And Sr John Clottworthyes own special friend said
passionately at the reading your Letter, that he plainly saw, the intention of
the House of Commons in England was, only that we should change our Masters not
improve our conditions, and that all the compassions you seem to have of the
miseries of Ireland. was but to get credit enough to work mischief in England.
Truly Sir, the face of things, and dispositions of Persons are much altered
since you left us, and what J now write to you, is the sense of all those (one
only excepted) with whom you directed me to conferr.

Your other correspondent showed us the copy of the Petition you sent hither to
be subscribed by the Protestants of this Kingdom, against making or consenting
to any Peace with the Rebels, and desired us to distribute our selves to
several Quarters for the getting of hands to it, telling us that his Neighbor
(the Lecturer whom you used to frequent on Frydaies) had already gotten near
200. hands to it, and that you expected it again in England by the twentieth of
this Month, because you deferred the publishing your last Declaration
concerning Ireland till then; upon perusal of it, we all wished it were in
your hands again, or at least, that that Gentleman's zeal, to whom you
committed it, had vouchsafed to have taken our advice before he made it so
public, for we are confident it will not only be disappointed of that consent
and approbation you expect, but we fear it may make a contrary impression in
many, (and those of the greatest power, interest, and Reputation) who have only
borne the uneasinesse and calamity of a War, in hope of a speedy, safe, and
honorable Peace, and what must these men think when they see a Protestation
entered against Peace in general without any consideration of the Justice,
Honor or security of it? Pardon me if I tell you in what Language the grief
and sorrow of some very good men (even in your own Calendar) has vented it
self upon the view of this Petition: They say, you sit like a proud wanton
People, upon a secure, fruitful Hill, and barbarously inhumanely delight your
selves with the prospect of Battles, Contentions, Desolation and Famine in
the Valleys: that you are gotten upon a safe and pleasant Rock, and recreate
your selves with the miseries and destruction other men endure by Tempests, and
Shipwracks about you. I beseech you (Sir) consider what it is you ad^^se us to.

That all the Protestants in Ireland join in a Petition to His Majesty, or to
both Houses of Parliament in England (for you say you have not yet determined
to whom the Petition shall be directed, that may be done when it comes to
London) against making a Peace with the Rebels in Ireland. An excellent
evidence and testimony of our Religion: have the protestants with so much
acrimony and bitterness differed amongst themselves so long about Forms and
Circumstances, and can there be no expediment found out to unite and reconcile
us, but a peremptory dislike of Peace? Good Sir, let such Petitions be framed
and preserred by Turks and Jnsidels which have no reverence of the pretions
image of their Maker, but with the same temper behold the slaughter of a man
and of a Horse, who have no principles of charity and brotherly compassion, or
apprehension of future punishment for the want of them. Let those whose
Religion you say is Rebellion, and whose doctrine you excuse to be inconsistant
with Peace* prefer Petitions against Peace, God forbid the Protestants of any
Kingdom should consent to such a Petition. If your Reformation of Religion
must be made by blood and desolation, and your propagation of the Gospel by
the extirpation of Nations, call it a progress to any Religion, rather then of
the Protestants, whose glory and custom has always been to give up their own,
not the Lives of other men a sacrifice to the Truth they profess. What are the
Argumen^s in Religion or Policy which you can give us, or that we can give His
Majesty to persuade Him, that a speedy Peace and Accommodation is not good for
this miserable and distracted Kingdom.

You say they are Papists, and ought not to be suffered to live amongst us. I
hope I may with more freedom speak in this Argument then other men; for you
know I have been always passionately inclined against the growth of that
Religion, and concurred with you in any proposition for the suppression
thereof, I would to God you had virtuously used the advantages have been
offered you to that purpose at least that you had not so much played with
Religion in your Votes and Declarations, and totally excluded it in your
Actions: believe it (Sir) Good works, which comprehend Loyalty and Obedience
will be never so much disgraced under the Imputation of Popery, as not to be
thought an essential part of Christian Religion, into what Opinions soever
distinguished. I may, without ostentation, tell you, no man has spent more
hours in Prayer, that it will please God to strike the hearts of this Nation
with the true knowledge of his worship that we may be all of one mind both in
the substance and circumstance of Religion; but you must pardon me if J do not
believe the way to remove the Errors, is to destroy the men, that the way to
People Ireland with Protestants, is to cut the throats of all the Papists.
Religion can never be fruitful in that soil which is tainted and over flowed
with Rivers and streams of blood. Admit there were no consideration of
Justice, of Christianity in the Case, no motion of those bowels which must
yarne at the murdering and massacring of Mankind: do you think it were a most
prudent, a most politic position for His Majesty to publish. That He is
resolved to have no Papist to live in any of His Dominions, if He were in a
condition to execute such a sentence, and all men ready to give obedience to
it; would he not rob himself of an unvaluable Treasure and strength in the
loss of so many Subjects. You seemed to take great care at the beginning of
this Rebellion, that it should not be thought a War for Religion, you would
not provoke all of that profession to think themselves concerned in it: and you
did wisely: the Earl of Clenrickard has as much reason to expect that
Religion should be magnified in his Loyalty, as to find it suffer in the
defection of my Lord Magu^yre; but you must take an equal care, that as you
will not have it thought in them a War for Religion, so they must not think
it a war in you against Religion, that will produce the same danger. We that
have enjoyed that full measure of prosperity and plenty in this Kingdom cannot
doubt of enjoying the same in the same Company. Let the Laws of the Land be
judge of their Actions, and God in his good time will rectify or pardon their
Opinions.

Why then must we have no Peace? because they are Rebels: Is this your
Proposition? No Rebellion must be extinguished but with the blood and
extirpation of the Rebels: put it to the Question. No man looks upon this
Rebellion with more horror then I do, few men have felt sadder effects of it,
either in the exercise of the sword or fire my Houses burned and my two Sons
killed in cold blood; yet I do believe very many honest men have been cozened
into this Action, by the power and persuasion of their Leaders, or frighted
into it by the ill managery of affairs here, who never entertained disloyal
thought toward their Sovereign, or seditious thought toward their Country;
And there are good men who imagine that there has not been less skill and
industry used by some of your friends in England and some of my friends in
Ireland, to improve and continue this Rebellion, then were in the most active
Contrivers to begin it, otherwise why were the first Proclamations of Pardon
sent out of England, with so much care concealed here, and unpublished but in
two Counties, and such who within the time prefixed rendered themselves
according to that Proclamation, imprisoned, and used with that severity, as if
they had been taken in the Act of Rebellion: believe it (Sir) when all
miscarriages of that kind shall be scanned, unpardonable faults will be found
in those who have cried out most upon this Rebellion; but J am far from
excusing even those who have bin in truth missed, if there has not bin an
absence of Loyalty, then has bin of Conscience, Courage, and Descretion,
without which the other is but a dream; and no doubt the Contrivers of these
distempers had in their purpose as much Confusion, Cruelty, and Inhumanity, as
much Malice to the English Government, and the English Nation as can be
imagined, and yet they make specious pretenses, and arguments for all that they
do. There was a Friar taken in the last expedition into Conaight, about whom
was found a Collection of all your Votes, Ordinances, and Declarations in
England, very carefully perused and marked with short Marginall Notes by him,
and out of them a large Manuscript; framed by himself, and entitled An Apology
of the Catholics of Jreland: or a Justification, of their defensive Arms for
the preservation of their Religion, the maintenance of his Majesty's Rights and
Prerogatives, the natural and just defense of their Lives and Estates, and the
Liberty of their Country, by the practice of the State of England, and the
judgment and authority of both Houses of Parliament in England, in truth so
unhappily penned, with so little variation of Language, that but for the
alteration of Ireland for England, and some great Persons of this Kingdom in
the places of some named by you, your own Clarke would hardly know it from one
of your own Declarations. All that they do is for the good of the King and
Kingdom. The King is trusted with the Forts, Magazines, Treasure and Offices
for the good and safety of the People; if he does not discharge this Trust,
but is advised by Evil Counselors, and Persons they cannot confide in, it is
their duty to see this trust discharged, according to the Condition and true
intent thereof; That they saw their Religion and Liberty in danger of
extripation, and therefore they had reason to put themselves into a posture of
defense; That they are ready to lay down these defensive Arms, as soon as
the great Offices of the Kingdom are put into such hands as they can confide
in; with all those other common places which are so much insisted on by you in
your several Declarations. But admit this Rebellion were an entire Act of the
whole Irish. Nation, that it was designed by an unanimous consent to free
themselves from the yoke of England, If they repented now of that Design and
having felt the smart of that Folly and Madness, desired to return to their
Allegiance: can there be no door open to Mercy and Oblivion? I believe you
would Vote him an Evil Counselor that should give the King that Council in
England: I am glad your Letter from the two Houses to our Justices and Council
(the Copy of which I received enclosed in yours) has miscarried, for I am
sure it is not yet come to their hands. You will find you are mistaken in the
temper of Our Board, and that they will not bear those reproaches from Persons
they are in no degree subject to. They think themselves as competent Judges of
their expressions in their own Acts of State, as you are of yours in your Votes
and Ordinances and being imediately trusted by His Majesty with the Government
of this Kingdom, understand better what is in order to the preservation and
destruction of it then you do. You tell them, they must not conceive the charge
of the War is only referred to you, as if your part were to be our Bankers
only to provide Money, and were not to advise and direct the managing of the
War, which power you say was granted you by Act of Parliament, and you will
assume it as the means to save this Kingdom. We know no such Act of
Parliament, and we hope there is none, nay, the King must pardon us if we say
there can be none. He is our Sovereign, and we are his Subjects, he can no
more give us away, and exclude us from His Protection, which if He excludes
Himself from managing this War, or redeeming us from this War by Peace, He
does absolutely do, then we can put off our subjection, and say He shall be Our
King no longer. Pray consider the condition you would have us understand our
selves to be in, you seem to apprehend us in great streights, in great
necessities, reduced into narrow circuits without Money, Victual, or Munition,
in that proportion to contend with our Adversaries. You do not pretend to have
Authority to make a Peace for us be the terms never so honorable, and if He
has not power to do it neither, our portion must be an eternal War, which
is no comfortable thing to believe. You say you will bring those to condign
punishment who advised the late Commission, to hear what the Rebels can say
or propound for their own advantage: If you can charge them with no other
crime, but that Advice they will never fear the bar of Justice. Why are you
offended? do you conceive the case of the Rebels to be such, as by any skill
or managery in a free and public debate may get credit: It were an austere
reservednesse in the King, for which God Almighty would require a strict
account of Him, when those He trusts here, present the misery of their
condition to him, and implore his care and protection, and when those from whom
all the mischiefs seem to proceed, pretend to do all those mischiefs in their
own defense, and desire to be heard for themselves, if he should refuse to hear
them because they are Rebels. We have seen a Declaration of yours, in which
you seem with great vehemence to accuse the King, that He refused to receive a
Petition from you, to hear what you could say for your selves; and it was a
charge of so great weight, that we find the King taking much pains to free
Himself from, by absolutely denying it, as conceiving it an unkingly thing not
to hear what the worst Subject can allege in his own defense. How comes His
Office to be so inverted? must the King of England receive all Petitions, and
the King of Ireland refuse all? Indeed if the King were guided by such sinister
Rules of Policy and Craft, as govern your Actions, he would not now subject
himself to the difficulties and hazard of recovering what you have with so much
Industry and Cunning made desperate, and would content himself that the blood
of this poor People should be cast upon your Account, and that Posterity might
see that the loss of such a Kingdom was the fruit of a perpetual Parliament.
But His Majesty is too much acquainted with the Royal duty of a King, to think
he can depute His Office of protecting to other hands, and be excused, if by
their ill managery, a Nation (committed to his care) be lost. I assure you all
sober men here are so far from repining at this Commission, which you are so
scandalized with, that we look upon it as the dawning of that power, which for
so many months has been eclipsed by the interposition of a monstrous, and
unnatural Jurisdiction, and which we hope will every day break out with that
brightness, that will dispell those Mists and Clouds of confusion, which has
so fatally covered us, and that instead of the punishment you threaten, we
shall have cause to erect Trophyes to that Counsel, which advised this blessed
overture of Accommodation.

You will expect, I know, my Opinion of your New Covenant, which you have
prepared for the three Kingdoms, and which you say will unite all your Party,
and distinguish you from your Adversaries, I wish it would: I would there were
so much sense of Religion left, that for piety and conscience sake, men would
refuse the taking of any Oaths; your experience tells you the contrary, and
you see your selves every day left by those of whom you thought you were very
sure under that bond, they looking upon themselves as awed, and compelled to
take it, and so absolved from the obligation at the instant they are forced to
swear; and in truth you might consider, that if they have heretofore sworn
any thing that is contrary to this, you have no reason to expect that they
should observe this Oath, who have broken the former; and I must tell you it is
a shrewd evidence, that what you propose, is not the desire and solicitation of
the Kingdom, when you are put to these shifts, by Force and Fraud, by Threats
and Promises to croude the freeborn Subjects into a Faction: you see the King
does not countermine you with these Arts and Preparatives, He applies no
Anti-Covenants to His followers, not so much as reinforces the known lawful
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; He is contented to depend upon the natural
fruits of Loyalty, Honor, and Generosity, under which Obligation, His handful
of men have swollen into thousands, and spread themselves almost over all the
Kingdom, whilst the Proselites under your Oaths, Covenants, and
Protestations, waste daily and fall off, and are well near shrunk from the
four quarters of the Realm which they possessed, within the verge of one
City. And if you consider how many of those who have taken this new Covenant
you have sent me, even at the time of taking it desire in their hearts, That
Episcopacy should still continue, and how many more, who hate Bishops, and
think them Antichristian, would yet rather live under them, then under a
Presbytery, which is the case of the Independents, and both these and many more
(who are so far from caring what Government of the Church is established,
that they would be content all the Churches in England were pulled down, and
both Preaching and Praying put down for seven years) are directly bound to set
up the Presbytery. I lay, when you consider, that men of these several and
distinct tempers, with the same zeal take this Covenant, it is no wonder, that
in stead of Union, you find nothing but jealousy and Confusion amongst your
selves, and instead of advancing the Religion you pretend to, you draw upon you
a general suspicion, of having no Conscience or sense of Religion at all.

For the coming in of the Scots, which you say is your greatest and last hope,
I confess I think you will be deceived. But by the way, you are wonderful
kind to us, to advise us to Petition against Peace, whilst you are laboring
to draw so great a part of our Army as the Scots in Vister from assisting Us,
to serve you in England, it is too great a business for me to deliver an
opinion in, but me thinks it should lessen very much your reputation with the
People, to see that after your charging the King so long with the purpose of
bringing in Foreign Forces, which you have pressed as the most odious charge,
and as a color and ground for most of your Actions, you your selves at last
call in Foreign Aid to help you to do that, which you had, or can have no
pretense of doing, but that all the people of England desire it, and do not
think, that saying they are your Brethren of Scotland, and your fellow
Subjects, will make them be thought less Foreign power, you will not be
content that the King shall call in the Irish under the same consideration: and
can you think it possible, if the Scots shall obey your desires herein (which
after all their Vows and Covenants of Loyalty, Duty, and Affection to their
native KING, I cannot think they will ever do) that the KING will not power
in all the Forces He can procure from all the parts of the World, both into
that and the other Kingdom. No doubt he looks upon that Remedy, as the most
grievous and most hazardous, and therefore with great mercy to His people, has
not suffered Himself to be tempted by all His wants, all His weakness, and
your example of entertaining so many Dutch, Walloones, and all Nations against
him, to suffer such a supply; which infallibly he might long since have had,
but if you ^^^ll be contented to give away your Country to strangers (for do
not think they will be as easily got out as they are brought in) and that you
may be revenged of those you have injured, involve the whole Kingdom in such a
lasting confusion; you (...) not wonder if strangers be brought in to beat out
strangers, though all the mischief is to be done at the charge of your poor
Country. I say, I cannot believe (though some particular Persons may be
concerned to keep up this distraction) that the Scotch Nation will engage
themselves in a quarrel against their Native KING (to whom they have such
general and particular Obligations, and against the whole Nobility and Gentry
of England, for matters in no degree Relative to their own affairs and venture
that blessed calm and Peace they now enjoy, only to kindle a fire amongst
their Neighbors, which probably will not be quenched, till it has burned to
their own habitations. They know well the inveterate, mortal hatred this
Nation of Ireland bears to them, and how glad they would be to be let loose to
their revenge, and they are too wise to think the two Houses (whose public
Faith stands so deeply engaged) will be as liberal and bountiful a Master to
them, as their Royal Sovereign. Be not deceived. One of their principal
Commanders (upon whose personal assistance you much depend) asked me, whether
I thought them so sottish to declare themselves against their King, whilst the
two Houses were governed by my Lord Say, who hated their Religion, and the Army
by the Earl of Essex, who hated both their Religion and Nation; and then told
me the bitter invectives made by the first against a Presbytery, and the sharp
and scornful mention by the other of the Scots and Scotland. And intruth if
ever they enter into your Kingdom, the mischief and confusion they will
bring, in not submitting to your Government (for what discipline soever they
affect in the Church, they are assuredly for independency in the State) will be
greater then the advantage and Aid you will receive by their supplies. In a
word (besides the perfect hatred you will find from all the Northern parts
which you have thrown away to them, and which must be inhabited by them) you
will find your selves deserted by all men who have any desire of Peace, and
are not willing to entayle this War from Generation to Generation.

DUBLIN this third of October. 1643.
