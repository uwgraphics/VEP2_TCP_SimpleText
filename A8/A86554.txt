A Letter from Ralph Lord Hopton, to the Gentlemen and Inhabitants of Cornwall
and the Counties adjacent.
GENTLEMEN,
I Am confident there has not been wanting diverse ill Instruments amongst you,
who probably (though I have better thoughts of your Fidelity) may have drawn
some of you from your wonted Loyalty and Alegiance to your native Prince by
Scandalous false and forged Reports against his Integrity toward you, who are
his Natural Liege People and Subjects, and ought to obey him as your Lawful
King an Governor: And that they do or may endeavor to persuade you* That it
was or is His intention to enslave you, and bring upon you a Tyrannical
Government, forced by the sword of Foreigners, which fa^se Lies, feined
Imputations (to caluminate His good Intentions) peradven^ure you may some of
you give credit to, as by sad experience I find many of the People of England
have been too ready to believe such falsityes foysted upon our late Dread
Sovereign of ever Famous Memory, by which means his Virtues were blemished,
and he rendered odious in the eyes of the Vulgar, which can^d them so
Traitorously and unjustly by silence to permit that inhumane murder
perpretrated upon his Sacred Person; They being spatiously promised after his
Death to enjoy their Liberties, then which nothing is less intended by the
promisers, neither is it in their power to perform, nor in Reason for the
People to believe, so long as there is any of the blood Royal left to lay
claim to the Crown and Kingdom, which cannot be easily extinguished, or can
there ever be any true grounds or hopes of Peace whilst there is foreign Aid
sufficient to be obtained still to keep the Land in Gar-Broyles and
Cumbustions, which will undoubtedly be attempted by all Christian Princes,
unless you unanimously and jointly with speed do endeavor to Establi^^ your
King, (who now is CHARLES the Second) without (...) Him to invite Foreign Aid
to His Assistance, which he is unwilling to do, knowing that the impoverishing
and destroying of His Subjects will be His loss in the end.

But if you do refuse him your aid, in this you must excuse him, if he
attempt by other hands to procure his own. It is not unknown to many (it not
all) of you, how unjust the sufferings of our late Sovereign were and how
real an Endeavorer He ever was of His Kingdoms Peace, and Subjects Liberty,
yet It could not formerly be believed, now His Actions have manifested (...),
He having sealed it with his blood, rather then to infringe His Oath, and admit
of any illegal Court (as that pretended Court of Justice is, which took away
His life) which might destroy (...) in His Subjects, or violate the
Fundamental Laws of the Land; you may be pleased to remember how often, and
with how much alacrity He did offer to agree upon any terms (as may appear by
(...) Conc^ssions when he was in a Treaty with the two Houses of Parliament in
the I Will of Wight) although something dishonorable and in part to inslave
Himself and Posterity for the good of His Three Kingdoms, and a settlement of
Peace amongst His Subjects; I will not, I hope I need not to cite you former
Precidents of His Integrity to preserve the Laws and Liberties of his Land and
People, which he of my knowledge (during the time he had the sword in His hand)
was ever careful to keep inviolable; Let this suffice for a President of the
unjust Sufferings of our late disceased Sovereign; And to make known to you
the thing to which my Duty and Allegiance does bind me concerning Prince
Charles, by whose Commission and Authority I Act, and who is Heir aparent to
the Kingdom of England, and all the Dominions which were His Fathers. Although
kept thence by the same Traiterous usurped Power that His Royal Father was
murdered by: Now for, and in behalf of Him, as He is our Lawfu^l King, His
late Father being disceased: I do desire you to reflect upon your Oath of
Allegiance, which I am confident many of you have took, and according as by
that Oath you are bound to use the best means you may, and to the uttermost of
your Power endeavor an Establishment for Him in this Kingdom, as His
Predecessors King of England have had; and like true Subjects that you will
acknowledge Him for your King, and His Royal Person De^end and protect against
all Traitors and Treacherous Attempts which shall or may be made against Him by
any usurped pretended Power of Parliament, or other which shall disalow or
disavow His Government.

Gentlemen,

I Hope you can not choose but be satisfied in your Consciences of the
lawfulness of my Sovereigns Cause, and my Demands for him, which is no other
but for his own Birthright. And I doubt not but you are very sensible how
weakly your Liberties and Laws are likely to be preserved by those pretended
usurping Magistrates in whose hands they now are, and how your promised
Freedom is turned to Slavery and Bondage by an Arbitrary Tyrannical
Government, far worse then ever the King could exercise upon you, though he
were the greatest Tyrant, by reason he in such cases is limited by the Known
Laws, which these are not, but only their Wills is Law to do any thing
maintained by the Sword, without all color of Law or Justice.

I could enlarge my self further, and instance you many things which might make
you more sensible of your approaching Ruin, if you do not suddenly Crown and
settle your Lawful King, but I shall forbear at present, by reason I do not
much doubt your Loyalty, having had pretty good experience of it formerly; I
shall only therefore publish to you this following Declaration, whereby to
manifest the reallity of my Intentions to my King and Countries Weal, and
(...) happiness; And so shall leave you to the Answer, which if it be done
according to my Expectation and good Opinion of your Fidelity, you shall find
my faithful and true Assistance ready upon all Occasions to back your
undertakings. Thus much at present, hoping you will not fail to prosecute your
Alegiance and Loyalty,

I remain, Gentlemen, Your Affectionate Friend, and lover of the Kingdoms
Peace, and Subjects Liberty, R. H.
From the Navy Royal, this 8. of Febr. 1648.
The Declaration of the Honorable RALPH Lord HOPTON.
Whereas there is a tyrannous, murdering, bloodthirsty and rebellious ARMY
under the immediate Conduct of General Lord Fairfax, who have cu^d out from
the late House of Commons a select number of pernicious factious Rebels, men of
very desperate principles with whom they are associated, and call themselves
the Commons of England in Parliament assembled, and assume the Legislative
power of the Kingdom to be in them, (a thing never before heard of) by which
they have disabled the Lords for ever having any voice in Parliament, but as
members of the Commons House and have by their pretended power constituted a
Court of Justice as they call it, only to mock justice, and introduce tyranny
under a fair color by pretense of doing justice to inslave the Nation, and
make all men to submit unto their unheard of Authority: by which illegal
Court, they have traitorously and like unparaleld Regici is murdered their
lawful King to satisfy their libidinous blood-thirsty appetites, which was
never full enough gorged with the blood of subjects, but must needs dip their
hands and die their black souls scarlet with the innocent blood of the best of
kings to upold their wicked Democracy and Anarchical tyranny; likewise they
have manifested (since that wicked fact parpetrated upon their Sovereign) by
their mock-acts and proclamations; that any one shall be proceeded against as a
traitor that does proclaim the Prince (who is now our lawful King by
hereditory succession) or any other to be King or chief Magistrate, which the
kingdom of England without their consent (which doubtless shall never be
obtained,) as may appear by all other circumstances, probable consequences of
their actions.

All which are very plain Testimonies* that they intend nothing less then to
subvert the Ancient Laws and Constitutions of this Kingdom; by which the
People of England are made capable to enjoy their Estates, with more Propriety,
of which each subject will be absolutely dispoyled, and their Estates Goods and
^ives laid open to their fellow subjects (now more i^ authority then Kings)
wills; all which foregoing obsurdities and illegal Practices, but especially
that horrid Design of murdering their King may be sufficient motives to stir
up all m^ns hearts who have any sparks of grace in them to assist their King in
so just a Quarrel as his is against such de^perate Monsters, whose delight is
to be drunk with Blood: and bring all good men into Bondage. Now if there be
any amongst them who wi^ (as it becomes their Loyalty and Alegiance) leave
these wicked Machiavel^s, and repair to me, to serve in behalf of their KING,
they shall not only be civilly entertained, and receive pardon and Indemnity
for what they have formerly done, but they shall also be accommodated and
rewarded according to their Degrees and Worth.

I could sp^ak of the Church Government, which was once a great Pretense of
their Quarrel, but now is laid aside as a thing impertinent, and Religion
become a confused Chaos of Sects without all form or shape. Really I should
think, if they were not guilty of any other crime but the abhorred murder of
their King, it would be enough to make Vengeance with thunder-clapps to ring
Peals in their ears from each part of the Compass, as I am confident, ere
long it will give shrill Alarms to their blood-stained Consciences, rather to
give all People Satisfaction concerning my Engagement, in prosecution of which
I Am ready to hazard that which is most dear to me, even my life and Fortune,
as by my duty to God, and Alegiance to my King, I am obliged; ( Viz.)

I. To defend my lawful King ( Charles the second) from the violence of all
his enemies, and to endeavor so much as I may a setlement for him in his just
rights, Regal anthority, Kingly power and dignity against all opposers which
shall by any means impedite and hinder His Royal Person from being King and
chief Magistrate on the realms of England Scotland and Ireland, with all other
dominions which of light did belong to His Royal Father.

II. I will endeavor to propogate and increase the true Protestant Religion,
the just rights and privileges of Parliament, and likewise the ancient and
fundamental Laws of the land established by act of King, Lords, and Commons.

III. I do declare that I have no intention to inslave the Subjects, nor never
shall consent or assent to have any Tyrannical power exercised upon them; but
shall maintain and defend their freedoms and liberties in as ample manner,
according to the Laws of the land, as I will the Person and power of my
Sovereign Lord and King, whom God preserve and make prosperous as ever any of
his Predecessors were.

FINIS.
POSTSCRIPT.
THis may be a sufficient pledge to you of my reallity, I hope you do not doubt
it; when I was amongst you, it is known I did preserve you, and did Permit no
injuries by any to be done to you; and so will ever do, if you willingly
entertain me in the name of my Lord and King: in whose commission I am the
same I was in His loyal Fathers days.
