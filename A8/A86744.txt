The Humble PETITION AND ADDRESS Of the General Court sitting at Boston in
New England, UNTO The High and Mighty PRINCE CHARLES THE SECOND.

And presented unto His Most-Gracious Majesty Feb. 11. 1660.

March.11 Printed in the Year 1660.

TO THE High and Mighty PRINCE CHARLES THE SECOND, By the Grace of God KING of
Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith.
Most Gracious and Dread Sovereign,
MAY it please your Majesty (in the day wherein you happily say, You now know
that you are again King over your British Israel) to cast a favorable eye
upon your poor Mephibosheths now, and by reason of lameness in respect of
distance, not until now appearing in your presence, we mean New England,
kneeling with the rest of your Subjects, before your Majesty, as her Restored
King. We forget not our Ineptness as to these approaches. We at present own
such Impotency, as renders us unable to excuse our Impotency of speaking unto
our Lord the King: yet Contemplating such a King who has also seen Adversity,
that he knows the heart of Exiles, who himself has been an Exile; The Aspect
of Majesty thus extraordinarily circumstanced, influenceth, and animateth,
exanimated outcasts (yet outcasts as we hope for the truth) to make this
Address unto their Prince, hoping to find Grace in your sight; We present this
Script, the Transcript of our Loyal hearts, into your Royal hands, wherein we
crave leave:

To Supplicate your Majesty for your Gracious Protection of us, in the
continuance both of our Civil Privileges, according to (and of our Religious
Liberties, the Grauntees known end of suing for) the Pattent conferred upon
this Plantation by your Royal Father: This, This, viz. Our Liberty to walk in
the Faith of the Gospel, with all good conscience, according to the order of
the Gospel (unto which the former in these ends of the earth is but
subservient) was the cause of our transporting our selves, with our wives,
little ones, and our substance, from that pleasant Land, over the Atlantic
Ocean, into this vast and waste Wilderness: choosing rather the pure Scripture
worship with a good conscience, in this poor remote Wilderness, amongst the
Heathens, then the pleasures of England, with subjection to the Imposition of
the then so disposed, and so far prevailing Hierarchy, which we could not do
without an evil conscience: For this cause we are at this day in a Land, which
lately was not sown, wherein we have conflicted with the sufferings thereof
much longer then Jacob was in Syria; Our Witness is in Heaven that we left not
our Country upon any dissatisfaction as to the constitution of the Civil State;
Our Lot after the example of the Good Old Non Conformist, has been only to Act
a Passive part throughout these late Vicissitudes and successive Overturnings
of State; Our separation from our Brethren in this desert, has been and is a
suffering, bringing to mind the affliction of Joseph, but Providential
exception of us thereby from the late Wars, and temptations of either party, we
account as a favor from God, the former clothes us with sackcloath, the latter
with innocence.

What Reception, Courtesy, and Aequanimity those Gentlemen, and other Adherers
to the Royal Interest in their adverse Changes visited these Parts were
entertained with amongst us, according to the meaness of our Conditions, we
appeal to their own reports.

Touching complaints put in against us, our humble Request only is, that for
the Interim wherein we are dumb, by reason of absence, Your Majesty would
permit nothing to make an Impression upon your Royal heart against us, until we
have opportunity and license to answer for our selves; Few will be nocent, said
that Impleader, if it be enough to deny; few will be innocent, replied the
then Emperor, if it be enough to accuse.

Concerning the Quakers, open Capital Blasphemers, open Seducers from the
Glorious Trinity, the Lords Christ, our Lord Jesus Christ, the blessed Gospel,
and from the Holy Scriptures, as the rule of life, open enemies to Government
it self, as established in the hands of any but men of their own Principles,
Malignant and Assiduous Promoters of Doctrines, directly tending to subvert
both our Churches and State: After all other means for a long time used in
vain, we were at last constrained, for our own safety, to pass a Sentence of
Banishment against them upon pain of Death; such was their dangerous Impetuous
and desperate Turbulency to Religion, and to the State Civil and
Ecclesiastical, as that how unwilling soever, could it have been avoided, the
Magistrate at least in conscience both to God and man, judged himself called
for the defense of all, to keep the passage with the point of the sword held
toward them; this could do no harm to him that would be warned thereby, their
willingly rushing themselves thereupon was their own act, and we with all
humility conceive a Crime bringing their bloods upon their own heads. The
Quakers died not because of their other Crimes how capital soever, but upon
their superadded presumptuous and incorrigible contempt of Authority, breaking
in upon us, notwithstanding the Sentence of Banishment made known unto them;
Had they not been restrained so far as appeared, there was too much cause to
fear that we our selves must quickly have dyed, or worse; and such was their
Insolency that they would not be restrained but by Death; nay, had they at last
but promised to depart the Jurisdiction, and not to return without leave from
Authority, we should have been glad of such an opportunity to have said they
should not dye.

Let not the King hear men's words, Your servants are true men, fearers of God
and the King, and not given to change, zealous of Government and Order,
Orthodox and peaceable in Israel, we are not seditious to the Interest of
Caesar, no Schismatics as to the matters of Religion, we distinguish between
Churches and their Impurities, between a living man, though not without
sickness or infirmities, and no man; irregularities either in our selves or
others, we desire may be amended; we could not live without the public
worship of God; we were not permitted the use of public worship, without such
a Yoke of Subscription and Conformity, as we could not consent unto without
sin: That we might therefore enjoy Divine Worship without humane mixtures;
without offense either to God or man, or our own consciences; we with leave
(but not without Tears) departed from our Country, Kindred and Fathers house,
into this Pathmos; in relation whereunto we do not say, Our Garments are become
old, by reason of the very long Journey, but that our selves, who came away in
our strength, are by reason of very long absence, many of us become gray
headed, and some of us stooping for age; The Omission of the prementioned
Injunctions, together with the walking of our Churches, as to the point of
order in the Congregational way, is all wherein we differ from our Orthodox
Brethren.

Sir, We lie not before your Sacred Majesty, the Lord God of Gods, the Lord God
of Gods he knows, and Israel he shall know, if it were in Rebellion or
Schism that we willingly left our dwelling in our own, or continue our
dwelling in the strange Land, save us not this day.

Royal Sir, If according to our humble Petition, and good hope the God of the
Spirits of all flesh, the Father of mercies (who comfort the Abject) shall
make the permission of the bereavement of that All, for which we have and do
suffer the loss of all, Precious, so Precious in your sight, as that your Royal
heart shall be inclined to show unto us that kindness of the Lord in Your
Majesty's Protection of us in these Liberties, for which we hither came, and
which hitherto we have enjoyed upon Hezekiahs speaking comfortably to us as to
sons; This Orphane shall not continue fatherless, but grow up as a revived
Infant under its Nursing Father: These Churches shall be comforted in a door of
hope opened by so signal a Pledge of the lengthening of their Tranquillity;
These poor and naked Gentiles, not a few of whom through Grace, are come and
coming in, shall still see their wonted Teachers with encouragement of a more
plentiful increase of the Kingdom of Christ amongst them; and the Blessing of
your poor afflicted (and yet we hope trusting in God) shall come upon the head
and heart of that great King, who was sometime an Exile as we are:

With a Religious Stipulation of our Prayers, we (Prostrate at Your, Royal
feet) beg Pardon for this our boldness; Craving finally that our Names may be
enrouled amongst

Your MAJESTY'S most humble Subjects and Suppliants, JOHN ENDECOT Gov In the
Name, and with the consent of the General Court.

This was presented to His Most Excellent Majesty the 11. day of February 1660.
