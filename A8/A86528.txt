THE IMMORTALITY OF The SOVLE.
What will it profit a man to win the whole world and to lose his own soul?
Mat. 16.26.
says our glorious Lord and Savior Christ Jesus, the soul of man is a
spiritual, immortal, Psalm. 31.8.
substance which did flow from God, Eccles. 22.7.
and cannot die with the body, but return to God that gave it, unless it
rebel against his Father and Maker, his laws and true Church, and has no true
lively faith to save himself by applying Christ's righteousness to himself by
a lively faith; then these souls must die the everliving death of torment, but
God made the soul of man righteous, but he has sought to himself many
inventions: the bodies of all men must turn to dust again until the day of the
Lord come, and then shall the dead hear the voice of the Son of God, Luke
23.43.
and shall stand up in more strength and spiritual power, and meet our Lord
Jesus to be judged, every one according to our faith and works. The body of
man has five senses, seeing hearing, smelling, tasting and feeling; the living
and immortal soul has in him understanding and knowledge, the will and the
remembrance, imaginptions, the affections and wisdom to rule the senses of the
body and the evil lusts of the soul, which join with the body to sinful
actions, but let wisdom, and grace and knowledge look hp to God for help and
strength to withstand them, and as the body has hands and feet, so has the
living soul in him many faculties: Faith is a virtue of the soul, unbelief
is a vice, humility as a virtue of the soul, pride is a vice, the love of God
and his Saints a virtue of the soul, hatred a vice, zeal for Gods glory and
true worship a virtue of the soul, cold^esse a vice, (...) a virtue lying a
vice there i^ a virtue, ^^nely a vice (...) a ver^^e of the soul, envy a
vice, thankfulness a virtue of the soul, unthankfulness a vice, bounty and
freeness of mind of the gifts which we have received of God, riches or
knowledge are both of them a virtue of the soul, covetousness, and hiding
Gods talems in the earth, avice spealing honorably of God, and of the word of
God, a virtue of the soul: swearing cursing, blasphemy, and mocking of the
word of God, great vices of the soul: wit, policy, valor, sound judgment and
discerning of spirits are Gods good gifts, and should be used well: th^s the
soul, the spiritual substance, the immortal soul, the holy Image of God
before man's fall, which God did breath into man and made him righteous and
excellent in knowledge, but now the children of wrath by Adams fall and
original sin, but the souls of the faithful are renewed by Jesus Christ our
glorious Lord and Savior, and shall be made perfect in heaven for ever more:
For the souls of the Saints shall suddenly come from heaven again to the body
in love and peace, saying, as it were, Arise, my loving friend and dear
companion, the day of Christ our King is come, the dark winter of trouble and
sorrow persecution, sickness, poverty and death it self is gons, come see thy
glorious Lord and Savior Christ Jesus which redeemed thee, with all his holy
companion of Saints and Angels, come lift up thy head and receive thy
acquistance from all thy sins, and live in glory for ever. But ungodly,
faithless men which have done ill, grief, the worm of conscience shall bite
them, saying, who shall hide us from the wrath of the Judge? but the godly
redeemer shall comfort them saying Come ye blessed of my Father, receive and
eternal Kingdom, and enter into jour Masters joy: All Glory, and thanks, and
praise be unto God, for all his free mercy and gifts, both now and for ever
more.

The excellency of CHRIST JESUS.
THe soul of man is a noble spiritual creature, created of God to obey him,
as was Adam and Evah in Paradise, but the Devil by temptations, quickly
spoiled his innocent righteous soul, defaced Gods Image, and then his shining
body became miserable and naked, his perfect soul became miserable, sinful and
ignorant; then were their souls and bodies to dye the death natural and
eternal for ever: but then the mercy and love of God appeared and promised,
that the seed of the woman should break the Serpents head; this was our
glorious Lord and Savior Christ Jesus which came in due time to restore Gods
Image, and to destroy the works of the Devil, to suffer and satisfy Gods
justice for the sins of all the believing world, which lay hold on him by a
lively faith, to in graft them into himself to adopt and make them his beloved
children and heirs of the Kingdom of heaven: for Christ Jesus our glorious
Lord and Savior is the only Son of God, in whom alone he is well pleased; he
is the natural son of God begotten begotten before the stars appeared, he is
the graven form of God, the brightness of the glory, the Image of the
invisible God, the first begotten Son of God; begotten before all worlds, God
of Gods very God of very God e^e^uall with the Father and with the holy Ghost,
he is the head of the Church, and in him all fullness dwells; thy sent, a
Christ! endures for ever: the scepter of thy Kingdom does may^t am
righteousness. The Lord said unto my Lord, sit on my right hand, until I make
thy foes a stool whereon thy feet may stand: Christ Jesus is the mighty Lion of
the tribe of Judah, which overcame the roaring and devouring Lion the Devil;
He is the Lamb of God which was slain for our sins, and takes away the sins
of the world, he is the mighty God, the Prince of peace, which trod the
winepresse of the wrath of God alone, and conquered death, hell, and the grave,
and the infernal spirits, and he arose and sustained himself by his own power
and strength, and sits at the right hand of the glory of God for ever. Christ
Jesus was promised to Adam and Evah, to Abraham and to David, he was prophesied
by Enoch Jacob, Moses, Esaias Jeremiah, Daniell Zachariah, by all the Prophets;
and he was typed out by Isaak, Samson, Solomon Jonah, and the brazen Serpent
in the Wilderness, Christ Jesus out Lord and Savior was waited and looked for
of all the faithful from the beginning of the World: and when he was come all
his Apostles bear witness of him both in life, death and writing; the Angels
from Heaven bring joyful tidings, and bear witness of him: Christ's wondrous
works bear witness of him, God the Father from Heaven bear witness of him,
his works bear witness of him, and shall judge men at the last day;
thousands of Martyrs have shed their dearest blood in defense of this truth,
Christ's Preachers by the holy Ghost preach his Word, and him the innocent blood
of the children which Herod slew were Martyrs for him, Christ and his Apostles
and Deacons, great works and miracles bear witness of him; Five hundred
Brethren at once saw him risen again, the Angels bear witness of his
resurrection. Christ's Apostles bear witness of him, and did eat and drink
with him after he was risen. Again, before that Mary saw him, and cries out,
Master, and Thomas felt his hands and his sides, and cries out, My Lord, and
God; and after he had been seen of them the space of forty days, he gathered
together his Apostles, and promised them to send the holy Ghost to comfort
them, and then he ascends to Heaven before their faces, where he sits at the
right hand of God in glory until he come again, to render vengeance to his
enemies, which persecute and wrong his Saints, and will not obey the Gospel of
our Lord Jesus Christ; and then will Christ Jesus gather his Saints and
faithful people from the East to West, and from all places, with thousands of
might, quick and strong Angels, and bring to rest in Heaven for ever: Christ
Jesus our Lord and Savior was also shadowed out by thousands of burnt
offerings of Bullocks, Goats, Lambs and fruits for sin offerings and
peace offerings in all ages from the beginning of the World before Christ's
coming, whose blood and the blould of the paschall Lamb which were slain by
hundred thousands every year, was a shadow and a finger of the precious blood
of our glorious Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, which willingly offered up
himself once for all, whose blood is a sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the
whole World, if they had the grace to lay hold on him by a lively faith, but
his death and merits shall save none of them but the faithful, and condemn
the wicked Rebels because Christ was offered, and they would not regard him:
Christ our High Priest is entered into Heaven, and makes daily intercession for
us: Now we need not to offer the blood of Bulls, Goats and Lambs. Now since
Christ is risen, this is the Sacrifice God requires at our hands to have his
Laws written in our hearts, to obey him, to love him, to honor him with our
souls and bodies, in our holy Assemblies, and to keep his Sabbaths, to give him
praise for his love unto us, to trust in him to pray unto him upon all
occasions, to love mercy and to do right, and justly, and to speak truth out
of an honest heart: for the increase of Christ's Kingdom of grace upon earth,
and for the right of the innocent, poor and fatherless children and widows,
and oppressed people, and to pray unto God for all good things, in the name of
Jesus Christ, and for his sake alone to forgive us our sins; these sacrifices
are more pleasing unto God then thousand rivers of Oil or the blood of all the
cattle on a thousand hills. For now seeing Christ Jesus our High Priest is
entered into heaven there remains no more blood to be shed for sins, for
Christ Jesus the eternal Son of God has once shed his precious blood for the
sins of all that lay hold on him by a lively faith, and makes daily
intercession for he is the only Mediator between God and man, for peace and
salvation; for he loves us, and will give eternal life to all that with faith
labor to keep his commandments: Christ Jesus our glorious Lord and Savior is
the way to Heaven, he is the truth and the light, No man can come to the
Father but by him, he has God the Father sealed, and in him stands the
covenant and the right to the faithful which love him, even the Kingdom of
Heaven, and all good things which he sees needful for them by sure promises
of the mighty God which cannot be broken: and if God cast gold and silver,
corn, wine and Oil, and government, and the use of all the creatures, upon
Turks, Infidels and unfaithful Christians, because he made them reasonable
men: Yet it is not blessed unto them without the word of God, and prayer in the
name of Christ Jesus, wheresoever Christ has been preached unto them, for they
must give account for government, for their riches, for their honor, for all
their wrong and blasphemous words, for all their abused knowledge of conjuring,
witchcraft and for their abuse of their knowledge of sea and land, the Sun,
Moon and Stars, and all Gods works of order and mercy, and his providence unto
them and the light of their conscience, all these shall witness against
heathen people, which will not follow the light of conscience, which they have
written in their hearts, and give honor thanks, and worship to the great God
of heaven and earth that gave them their being but they will worship vain Idols
stocks stones, and dumb creatures kill and devour one another, such heathen
people shall be turned into hell with all that forget God: Such Popish
Christians as confess Christ Jesus our Lord and Savior, to be the only Son
of God, and yet if they do deny him to be the only mediator between God and
man, and pray to Saints departed, and trust to their own merits, and their own
righteousness and good works, and consider not the Law of God to be holy and
pure, so right and strait that no mortal man can wholly keep without the help
of Christ Jesus who was God and man, he keeps Law perfectly, and did good all
his life, and was obedient to God his Father, unto the very death: he has
abundance of grace and good works, he loves righteousness and hates
iniquity, but mortal man is weak and sinful. The opening of the Law by our
Savior Christ Jesus in the fifth, sixth and seventh chapters of Saint
Matthew's Gospel, showing man's weakness plainly, when we have done all the
good we can, we must say we are unprofitable servants we must repent of the ill
works we have done, and desire with tears and sorrow Christ Jesus to wash
them away with his precious blood, and with a lively faith, desire him to
accept of our good works, and to cover them with his good works, and then they
will please God, and he will have delight in us; but if Popish Christians hide
Gods Word, the bread of life from many millions of men and women, which for
want of true knowledge perish, and cannot come to drink of the water of life
freely the spiritual stock Christ Jesus as they should do, this is an evil
work, and if they persecute and murder harmless people for their holy and
spiritual worshipping of God, which deny their own righteousness, and desire
with tears, faith and joy, to be clothed with the righteousness of Christ
Jesus, then this is an evil wicked work also: For Christ Jesus fulfilled the
Law of God in everything wholly, for the faithful men and women which love him,
and obey him, for in Christ Jesus the holy Trinity, and blessed unity of God
immortal and only wise is well pleased, and his justice satisfied for the
sins of all the faithful which love him with an upright heart, and God will
not give the glory of his spiritual worship of mankind to Saints or Angels
not yet the adoration of her bodies to dumb Images, for God is a jealous God of
his glory and true worship, and will visit the sins of all idolaters without
repentance, with eternal death and punishment in hell fire.

But O England! and all Reformed Churches which have the Word of God to read
in, which have faithful Preachers to preach Christ and amendment of life unto
us, which have wholesome and (...) Books to read in, which have the Lords day
kept and mayntayned amongst us, which have the Sacraments the Seals of Christ
Jesus love, giving unto us which have godly and needful Prayers, Conf^ssions,
and Thanksgivings appointed and set out in the name of Christ Jesus for to help
the weak and confirm the strong, which have had the example of many Martyrs in
times of persecutions under Bishops and learned Doctors men and women of all
conditions and estates; which have had godly Kings and Queens, which have bin
nursing Fathers and nurs^ng Mothers unto Christ Jesus true Church mil^^^nt
hereupon earth and have defended the true faith with the Word of God, with the
sword of God, and mayntayned true virtue, and punished vice O England! how
m^rcifull is God unto us? if we will embrace his mercy, and know them (...)
times of his visitation and love unto us: the name of the Lord God of Heaven
and earth be praised, honored, and sanctified for evermore. Which has sent
his mighty Word, the glad tidings of his Gospel unto us, and caused it to be
made more plainly read and preached in our own language; so that men and women
need not sit in darkness, not walk in darkness, except they suffer their
understanding to be blinded with the Devil, and so become wilful sinners,
worse than Turks, or Popish ignorant Christians, and some we have which are
larger in their opinions then the Word of God, or the Church of God teaches
them, and so cause the Lord to chastize them with temporal punishment and sin,
are too curious and nice, not contented with the wholesome and pure doctrine of
Christ Jesus, which is preached in most places; but take offense at every
trifle, and sometime at that which is very good through their ignorance, or else
their pride and self-conceitednesse, and so make more divisions and rents then
need: these our brethren cause the Lord God to chastize them with temporal
punishment also: and some do what they can to serve the Lord God with an
upright heart, and to maintayn the true worship of God peaceably, and so of
weak and strong the Lord God be praised: we doubt not, but that we have
hundred thousands of faithful Christians in these Northwest parts of the
World; yea, CHRIST JESUS lovingly calls all men to his Marriage and Noble
Banquet, for ever to be betrothed to him in faith and love, here in this world
militant to obey him, and to trust unto him, and to receive all things needful
from him, who knows our wants better then we, and after this short life to be
spiritually married to him in heaven for ever. But alas, unbelieving, ungodly
men and women, have out of their foolishness desired excuses, they love this
world and the vain things thereof, of short continuance, better then
everlasting Christ Jesus full of all riches and glorious excellent dignity: One
has married a wife and cannot come, another has bought a farm and cannot
come, another has bought oxen and cannot come, poor silly excuses all these
things they have received of God for Jesus Christ his sake and they should be
helps for them to trust in Christ, who having received good things from him
already, but blind foolish worldlings content themselves so they may have
mammon and worldly vanities rather then they will obey Christ Jesus and trust
to him for everlasting glorious possessions and so such foolish men and women
shall never be married to Christ which will not believe his word and obey him
here, but they shall be divorced from him for ever, and sent to eternal
misery, but yet the name of the Lord God of heaven and earth be praised and
glorified for his own gracious promise, who has promised that many shall come
from the East and from the West, from the North and from the South, and shall
sit down in the Kingdom of heaven with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, yea, many
thousands of men and women are very joyful, glad and willing to come and
prepare themselves with faith and amendment of life, for God has chosen them,
and those whom CHRIST JESUS has chosen, and giving a lively faith, which
works by love in him, there shall neither men nor devils be ever able to pull
them out of Christ hands for as many as believed in him to them he gave power
to be the Sons of God, and Christ Jesus will not lose one of them, but will
glorify them all in their tentations and infirmities, their slips and falls
shall not pull them out of Christ Jesus his hands, God the Father gave them to
him, and he is stranger then all: and in this world he will make them willing
to come to Christ Jesus by faith and repentance.

Of the Joys of HEAVEN.
GOD will give an eternal Kingdom of glory in heaven for ever, where there
shall be rest, love, joy, peace, riches, honor, plenty and great knowledge,
health, strength, beauty, and fullness of pleasure for evermore; and God will
wipe away all tears from their eyes, and place them in blisfull plight in
heavenly and glorious Mansions, where we shall behold our glorious, excellent
and mighty God and Father and his eternal love in Jesus Christ shining upon us
to our everlasting joy and comfort, and there we shall behold thousand thousand
millions of men women and children changed like Angels, shining as bright as
the Sun in their Fathers Kingdom all the good works and godly fruits all the
Prayers, Humiliations Fastings and Tears which which we have shed for our
sins, and for the sins of others; and in prayers for grace for others in
obedience to Christ Jesus Commandments, shall be rewarded in Heaven with
eternal crowns of glory: all the good works of almesdeeds, charity and love,
which we have done in giving to the poor, and in giving for the increase of
Christ Jesus Kingdom of grace here upon earth by our good example shall be
rewarded in Heaven with eternal crowns of glory, all the contending and
striving for Gods true worship and godly truth, and studying for ^cuity mercy,
true justice and judgment in men that are called thereto, Mal. 3.16.
all the good works that men do through faith in obedience to Christ Jesus,
shall be rewarded in Heaven with eternal crowns of glory, all that have been
faithful unto death will God give a crown of life for ever; Rev, 2.10.
Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of (...) every m^n
according to his works; all our patient sufferings reproofs sl^nders for Christ
Jesus sake; allour godly meekness and peacemaking in obedience to Christ
Jesus Laws shall be rewarded in Heaven with glorious crowns of hap^^nesse all
the little good works which we have done in obedience to Christ Jesus Laws
through faith and love in Christ Jesus, w^^^ make them all well pleasing to
God, and he will reward them with exceeding great rewards: never did man
imagine, nor his tongue able sufficiently to speak of the joys which God has
prepared for them that love him; there shall all the godly Kings and Q^eenes
come which have mayntayned Gods true worship, and loved the right; and have
peace and rest, and satisfying joys with full content, in beholding the
glorious vision of God Almighty for ever: there shall the godly Priests and
Ministers come which have preached Christ Jesus, and his Laws purely with an
upright heart, and shine as bright as the Stars in Heaven: there shall godly
Magistrates which have prayed to God, and studied to find out the truth and so
proceed in justice or mercy according to Gods Laws; for Christ Jesus sake find
rest and joy for ever, there shall the rich, bountiful men which have clothed
Christ poor, miserable and distressed members hereupon earth; and giving meat
to them that wanted for Christ Jesus sake, they shall receive treasure in
Heaven, plenty for ever, there shall the poor man which has been patient in
his poverty, and prayed to God to supply his wants and trusted in Gods
providence, and used the means that God has appointed, and served God with an
upright heart in Heaven, he shall have r^ches, plenty and honor enough; unto
that City shall ^ll faithful married people come, and chaste virtuous single
people which have loved Christ Jesus, and his excellent righteousness to
Heaven, also shall thousands of innocent children come by Gods mercy which knew
not their right hand from their left, by the meritorious humble works of Christ
Jesus the means to be used, baptizing; and God requireh the faithful prayers
of the parents; yea, many of all Nations shall come from the East, and from the
West, and from the North and from the South; and shall sit down in the
Kingdom of Heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the rest of the Saints
in that great and excellent City of our God, the heavenly Jerusalem so large,
beautiful and great, that some of the Learned have said, the womb of the
mother is not so strait for the child, in respect of this large World, as is
the Kingdom of Heaven in greatness and excellency above this World: and
others affirm, that some of the Stars are greater then all the earth, the
description of the heavenly Jerusalem, Revel. 21.16.
in the Revelation of Saint John says that it is twelve thousand f^rlongs
long, and twelve thousand furlongs broad, and twelve thousand furlongs high;
which makes fifteen hundred miles every way: yet this place of Scripture does
not deny but that it may be infinite larger. O fear Jerusalem, how fair and
beautiful is the City of our God? heaven is his throne, and earth is his
footstool heaven is his house wherein are many mansions for dwelling places for
the sons and daughters of men in pleasure and joy for ever more. There would
be much joy among a ship load of men, which at sea were almost drowned with
storms and tempests, in want of all good things should presently come to an
Haven where they should have all entertainment with joy and hearty courtesy of
the King, Princes and Nobles of the Country, and have gold and silver, and
lands given them for ever: but a thousand times more joy will it be, when the
wandering sons of men in the sea of this world, have almost been drowned with
temptations, the waves of despair, the rocks of pride, the number of vain
desires and worldly lusts, and yet though the love of God and their faith in
Jesus Christ shall not be cast away, but shall come to the haven of heaven,
where they shall be entertained with all joy, the Lord God himself will
entertain them saying Come ye blessed of my Father, receive the Kingdom
prepared for you, the heavenly Angels will be very joyful to see heavy
sinful flesh and blood to have ^pa^sed this mortal death and trouble, and now
changed so royally, and come to dwell with them in joy for ever, exceeding
great joy will there be among the Saints when they shall see one mother there,
yea, their dearest friends and acq^aintance: O the love, joy and hearty good
will that there will be when we shall see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and all
the Prophets and Martyrs, Adam and Evah, and all our ancient predecessors, and
our children and successors which have lived godly, and trusted in Jesus
Christ; exceeding great joy and comfort will there be when all the Saints from
the beginning of the world to the ending of the same are all come together to
this heavenly Jerusalem which is above, to see their glorious, excellent, great
and beautiful Lord God, and their redeemer and sanctifier, the glorious vision
of almighty God, and his love unto them shall give them such joy, that they
shall praise him with delight for ever, and love one another most deerly for
ever, because they shall all be loved of God, and drink of the full torrent
and ocean of pleasure for ever, the pure river of water of life is there ever
flowing, the pleasant tree of life is there ever growing, and yielding always
forth pleasant fruit, the gate, and walls of that City of diamonds, pearls,
and precious stones, Revel, 21.
the houses and streets of that City, more pure then gold; all the cities of
this heavenly Jerusalem more glorious then Kings: but into that City shall no
unclean person come no murderers, nor adulterers nor idolators nor covetous nor
thieves, nor enviers of goodness nor slanderers, nor such as love lies, nor
careless people of Gods true worship, except they be washed clean by faith and
repentance in the blood of Christ Jesus our Lord and Savior. But O Lord, for
Jesus Christ his sake, give us grace to love, fear and honor thy holy name,
that we may enter into thy holy Kingdom there to praise thy holy name for ever
more Amen.

The pain of loss and suffering.
BUt yet, alas, with sorrow I am forced to mourn in this world when I see
wicked and ungodly men to run headlong to hell, and destruction: for hell is
prepared for wilful rebellious sinners; assure as Heaven is prepared for
faithful repenting sinners; our Savior, the Prophets and the Apostles, proves
it plainly, the fearful punishment and torment which our Lord and Savior
Christ Jesus has foretold shall come to ungodly, unfaithful, and obstinate
sinners, should make them fear and repent, and seek for mercy, while they are
in this world before that fearful day of judgment to come when there shall be
no more mercy for them that would not seek it in this life, but the foolish
worldlings of this world will not repent, The fool has said in his heart
there is no God, the fool has said that the Al-seeing God does not see all his
bad works, and the evil thoughts of his heart he will not repent; the fool
has denied in his heart Gods power, will and justice; he thinks God will not
raise up the dead bodies of mankind spiritually restored in more strength and
nimblenesse, the good and faithful to be partakers of his mercy in Heaven for
ever; and the unfaithful, the fearful, the adulterers, the slanderers, the
murderers, the covetous the envious the Idolaters, the unthankful, the
careless people of Gods true worship, and such like to be punished in hell
torments for ever, except they repent and amend their lives, and r^n to God for
mercy in the name of Christ Jesus his well beloved Son and then will Christ
Jesus gather them as the Hen gathers her chickins under her wings, and save
them from the wrath of God and from the power and envy of the Devil: and
Christ Jesus will wash away their sins in his precious blood, and make them as
white as snow and wool, beloved to God for ever: bet if rugodly men will not
repent their sins and return to God for mercy and judge themselves worthy to
dye for their sins, then those woeful threatenings and cursin^s which are
written in the word of God must needs fall upon them, Go you cursed into
everlasting hell fire prepared for the Devil and his angels, and take the
unprofitable servant, and cast him into utter darkness, where shall be weeping
wailing and gnashing of teeth. And again, take the man which had not on the
wedding garment of faith and repentance or the righteousness of Christ Jesus,
bind him hand and foot and cast him into utter darkness, where shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth: It is better for thee to pull out thy right eye,
and to cast it from thee, that is thy dearest, darling and best belovedst sins
that will offend and displease thee: then having thy sins to be cast into hell
fire, where the worm dies not, and the fire never goethout. And again, Tophet
is prepared of old for ungodly, faithless men, the burning of it is great, and
the wrath ^f the Lord like a river of brimstone shall kindle it. And again Hell
beneath is moved to meet thee, and the wicked people go down to Hell: and all
the people that forget God; and God will wound the hoary scalp^ of him that
goes on in his wickedness, and upon the ungodly God will rain snares of fire
and brimstore, storm and tempest; this is their (...) to drink, and
tribulations horror and anguish shall be upon the head of every one that does
evil: Hell is a dark prison large and great, and the wrath of the Lord does
afflict diverse torments upon them, besides the pain of loss, whereof comes
the w^^me of conscience, which grief is as great as the other when they shall
remember the loss of Heaven that large, great and glorious place of pleasure
and refreshing, which they justly and madly have lost by their greedy sins, and
have sold their birthright to Heaven for trifles, if they world have trusted in
Christ and have loved his laws, and now they know all is gone, because they
loved lying vanities and loose behavior: now all hope is gone for ever too
late repentance will do them no good, at this remembrance grief the worm of
conscience will byte them, and they will curse themselves, and curse their
wicked acquaintance which drew them on to sins in this world, and wish that
their torment might make an end of them, but that is impossible they must lie
in prison for ever: Death gnaweth upon them for ever; the second death of body
and soul: so strait was Dives in Hell, that he asked but for a drop of water to
cool his tongue, and could not have it, whose fare in this world was
delicious, and his drink of the best wine: also The Lord Jesus will come from
Heaven in flaming fire, rendering vengeance to them that obey not his Gospel:
and another grief follows to the damned, God and his Angels, and his Saints
shall laugh them to scorn; for in this world they grieved the good spirit of
the holy ghost which put Gods thoughts in their hearts, and they gave place to
the Devil and his evil motions, they grieved the good Angels with their sins
in this world, and they grieved and vexed the Saints in this world, the godly
Ministers that taught them the word of God, wept and prayed for them, they
vexed their godly Neighbors and godly friends, which gave them good counsel,
and mourned for them in this world: but when the day of judgment came, and when
the Angel of the covenant has sworn that that time shall be no more, then
the Saints and Angels shall all rejoice at Gods righteous judgments: For in
Heaven is no mourning, although they see their brothers, sisters, fathers,
sons and acquaintance sent to hell by Gods justice, but they shall say; Just
and true are thy judgments, o Lord God, King of Saints! for their destruction
is from themselves, they have made themselves the children of the Devil: but
while time lasts in this world, wisdom stretches out her hand all the day
long, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, Why will ye die, Prove. 1.20, 21,
22, 23.
o ye sons of men, The Lord desires not the death of a sinner, but that he
should turn from his evil ways, and lay fast hold on the promises of his Son
Christ Jesus, and if thou will turn away from thy evil works, and love all
Gods laws with an upright heart, thou shall surely live, and have all thy sins
forgiven thee; for the Lord Jesus suffered most cruel torments, and shed his
most precious blood for those people which are truly humbled before him, and
which do see their sins and confess them to God, and are weary of them, and
desire God for Jesus Christ sake, his only son to forgive them all, and pray to
God for help and grace, to stand in his fear and love to all those people, the
Lord Jesus our Seviour has made most great and precious promises, wherein
stands our very life and comfort, and an assured hope of eternal life and
salvation, if we take heed unto them, then be not fearful to obey Christ Jesus
commandments, o doubtful soul, For he calls all those that be weary and
heavy laden with their sins, and he will refresh them: and again, Fear not
little flock, it is your Fathers will to give you a Kingdom: and again, If the
Son of God shall make you free, you shall be free indeed: and again, The hour
comes when all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of
God, and they shall arise, the good that have done good to the resurrection of
life eternal, the bad that have done evil to the resurrection of
condemnation: and again, I go the Father to prepare a place for you, that
where I am, there you may be also: and again, I am the living bread which came
down from Heaven, if any man eat of this bread with the spirit of faith, he
shall live for ever: and again, I am the good shepherd, the good shepherd
gives his life for his sheep, and I give unto them eternal life, and they
shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand, the Father
which gave them to me is greater then all, and no man is able to pluck them out
of my Fathers hand: and again, Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you,
not as the World gives, give I unto you: Let not your hearts be troubled,
neither let them be afraid, as my Father has loved me, so have I loved you,
continue you in my love if you keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my
love, these things I command you, that you love one another: and Saint Peter
says, Give all diligence to make your calling and election sure, add to your
faith virtue, and to your virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to
temperance patience, and to patience godliness, 2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7.
and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity, for
if these things be in you, and abound, they will make you that you shall not be
barren nor unfi^^full in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
But he that lacks these things is blind and cannot see afar off, and has
forgotten that he was purged from his old sins: Wherefore, Brethren, give all
diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things
ye shall never fall, for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly
into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; and Saint
Paul says, That the fruits of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, godly meekness, temperance; against such there
is no law, the more men have of these graces in faith, in Christ Jesus, the
more the holy Ghost does witness unto us our assured hope of eternal
salvation; God in mercy will bring also to Heaven many innocent children born
within the covenent of grace by the virtue of Christ Jesus meritorious works;
and many men and women of all Nations, whose graces were but few, and their
faith but small; If their faith were true, and if they used their small
knowledge, or two talents well, Christ Jesus will have them enter into their
Masters joy, yet Christ Jesus says. Not every one which (...), Lord, Lord,
shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that does the will of my Father
which is in Heaven, and many will say in that day unto Christ Jesus, We have
done great work in thy name, but he will say unto them, Matthew. 7 21, 22.
Depart from me ye workers of iniquity, your works were vain, counterfeit and
false; depart from me, I know you not: but, o Lord for Jesus Christ sake grant
us true humble hearts, upright before thee, that when the Bridegroom Christ
Jesus shall come with thousands of Angels, that we with the rest of his
Church; Matthew. 25.
the Bride may enter in with him: where we may behold his most glorious
Majesty, Psalm. 17.
to praise and magnify his holy blessed and name for evermore. Amen.

A PRAYER.
O Most high and ever-living and everlasting God, beyond all thoughts most high
and mighty Lord God, which dwell in pure brightness and excellent Majesty,
all glorious in thy self, and have no need of the glory of any of thy
creatures, but they receive their glory and excellent parts from thee: What
then are men or women in themselves before thee or the sons of men, that thou
should regard them, for they are weak and sinful? but thou, o Lord! art holy
and mighty, righteous, just and merciful, and giving unto mankind just and
righteous laws which are good for themselves: and thou, o merciful Lord God
have made merciful, temporal promises unto the sons of men, and keep them
sure and constant, in preserving, the whole World, in keeping it from firing
and drowning in restraining the rage and fury of wicked men, and evil spirits
that would destroy it, thy mercy is seen, o Lord! also mightily in sending food
and raiment sufficient for the whole World, fit for their habitation: so that
if there be any want, it is commonly the cruelty or foolishness of man. In
mercy, o Lord! thou sendest Summer and Winter, day and night, Seed-time and
Harvest, the ebbing flowing and of the Seas, the fish abiding and coming to
several Countries in their season! thy mercy is seen, o Lord! in blessing the
fowls of the air, and the beasts of the field unto mankind, the corn, flowers,
grass, herbs, with the fruits of the trees: so in mercy, o Lord! thou sendest
Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron, and all metals for the use and benefit of man: Silk
from Worms, Wool from Sheep, Leather and Furs from beasts great and small,
Diamonds and all kind of Pearls from Sea and Land: for the seating of mankind
in their several degrees, not to puff them up with pride, to abuse their
brethren, but rather to raise up their thoughts to praise their Creator, and
to desire with humility the grace to serve God here in this world, that they
may come to the glorious everlasting place, which God has prepared for his
people, o Lord God! thou art our Creator, there is no good to be had but from
thee and thy providence: we were nothing, o Lord God, and thou made us men
and women, we fell from thee, and became worse then nothing: and thou o holy
and blessed Trinity tookst pity on us: and thou, o merciful Jesus, becammest a
loving and merciful Savior unto us, thy mercy, o glorious and excellent sweet
Jesus is more greater in redeeming mankind, then any men are Abel: to express
o glorious heavenly Father, thou have made us thy children, thy holy Son Jesus
will make us holy: o holy and blessed spirit, thou sanctifiest thy people, and
teach them the way and the truth: and thou o blessed spirit make them
strong and valiant to hold out in thy fear, and serves to the end of our
lives, o holy, holy, holy, and blessed Trinity, and Lord God, high and
Almighty, to thee be all glory forever. All thy works praise thee, o Lord God,
and magnify thy holy name for ever: and now, o most holy and everliving God
and most merciful Father in Jesus Christ, we humbly beseech thee for Jesus
Christ sake to give us grace to live godly, soberby, lovingly, and zealous of
Gods true worship, and glory. And grant, o Lord! for Jesus Christ sake that we
may bring forth godly and charitable fruit in Christ Jesus; to the honor and
glory of thy name: and make us, o Lord, for Jesus Christ truly thankful unto
thee, for the free and true preaching of thy word in all these North-west parts
of the World. And we beseech thee, o Lord God, for Jesus Christ sake, in thy
goodtime, to send again thy true, plain and lively word to be preached, to be
believed and mayntained in the other parts of the World, that they and we may
at the last through thy exceeding great and wonderful mercy in Jesus Christ,
come to thy Kingdom to praise thy Name with joy for evermore: Amen. All glory,
praise and thanks be given unto thee, o eternal, and everliving Almighty Lord
God, both now and for evermore, World without end. Amen.

FINIS.
