SIR,
I Kindly salute you in the Lord, and wishes you sweet in-comes of his love
daily more and more: I cannot but acknowledge your respects to me, in giving me
notice of that false Scandal raised upon my Regiment, to be the beginners of
Mutinies, who has always carried fair toward their Officers, toward the
Country, and had the least complaints against them of any in the Army,
enduring hardship with abundance of content, receiving but one weeks pay from
my Lord FAIRFAX or the Committee this year and quarter, onley for the last
winter (for about three months) they had 13. pence per diem, and paid their
quarters out of it; by reason of which hardship, falling into want, they have
with tears in their eyes come to me to make their case known, with desire to
do what service they were able, if they might have but any subsistence to keep
them from lowsinesse, and doing injury and wrong to others, or otherwise, that
I would give them a Discharge, that they might go home and work for their
livings, never offering to Mutiny or stir, till others had shown them that
Example, and sent parties to their quarters to invite them to join with the
rest of the Army, and told them, they were Fools that they did not seek relief
as they did, using many provocations to tempt them. And further, when all the
rest of the Army had ten shillings a piece given them to supply present wants,
they had not a groat given them, nor could have promise of any, which gave just
cause unto them, more then any, yet was content to march after the King, so
long as our Army continued the pursuit; which being ended, and the Scots and we
Retreating for Yorkshire, suddenly a Council of War was called and agreed,
that four Regiments of outs should march back into the South, and the rest go
on to secure Yorkshire; the Lot falling upon my Regiment to go Southvvard, did
much rejoice me; and my own Troops that I raised my self was willing to march,
but two Yorkshire Troops that were added to me begun to cry out they
wanted the ten shillings the rest of the Army had got, and had neither Shirts
to their backs, nor Boots, nor Stockings to their legs, and knew not how long
they should stay abroad in that extreme want, desired either ten shillings to
buy them some necessaries or otherwise to march toward Yorkshire to get some
moneys to supply their wants, and then they would go any where, which could not
be had; whereupon many of them with tears in their eyes, asked what they could
do in such a condition: but before this, all or most of the Regiments resolved
for Yorkshire till they got some pay, and were more forward then mine, some of
my Troops following of me Southward, when all the horse marched Northward, by
all which and much more that I could truly say, it may appear mine was no ways
the beginners of these several mutinies. As for my self I defy all men to
accuse me of the least thought of countenancing any mutiny whatsoever in
Officers or Soldiers, but can bring many of quality to witness with me how
exceedingly I suffered in my spirit, in beholding those things I saw in the
Army, which rise through a neglect of those that should have provided better
for the Army; and I am confident both the best in the Army and Country will
witness, that my men were under as good command, and as little offensive to
the Country as any whatsoever, and constantly ever since they were a Regiment
upon as hard duty as any: I hope these will satisfy reasonable men, for
others that back-bites me, I value them not: I crave excuse for my
tediousness, and rest,

Your assured loving friend, Robert Lilburne.
For the rest of your Letter I shall be mindful of the particulars.



FINIS.
