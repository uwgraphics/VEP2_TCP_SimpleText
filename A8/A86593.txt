A Letter from Sir John Hotham from Hull, of the first of this April instant,
expressing Sir Hugh Cholmley's deserting the Parliament; and the re-gaining of

Bushel; and his desires that Captain Bushel might have the Command of that
place, by his nomination, and receive his Commands and Orders from him, was
this day read.

Resolved upon the Question, Hugh Cholmley be forthwith disabled for continuing
any longer a Member of this House.

Resolved upon the Question, Hugh Cholmley shall be for ever disabled for
sitting as a Member of Parliament in this House, for falsely and perfidiously

Protestation, and revolting to the Popish Army raised against the Parliament.

Resolved upon the Question, Hugh Cholmley shall be impeached of High Treason;
Master Marten, Sir Peter Wentworth, Sir Henry Hayman Master Samuel Brown,
Master Sergeant Wild, Master Solicitor, Master Rous, and Master Strode,
