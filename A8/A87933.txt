A Letter from a Person in the Country to his friend in the City: giving his
judgment upon a Book entitled A healing Question.
Sir,
I Have received your Letter, with the printed Paper in it entitled A Healing
Question propounded and Resolved, etc. and your commands with it to give you my
poor sense upon it: In observance of which I present you this, which if it much
exceed the limits of a Letter, I have only this to say, that it is in obedience
to your orders; and that the guilt thereof is contracted alone against him who
is the occasion of it; for I write not for any man's sight but yours.

I have indeed perused it, and I may say not without some propensity and by as
to the Authors design, because of its carrying with it, as I heard, the
approbation and consent of some honest men. I think truly there is as much said
in it as the Argument can well bear, yet not so much but may be well answered,
and if not by me, yet by some other who may have better time and abilities for
such a work: But if in telling you my thoughts upon the whole, I leap from one
page over the Heads of many others, it is not done by design, but by
necessity, the matter being so disposed of by our Author that I could not avoid
it. In his third Page he mentions two Generals from which all his other
particulars are derived; and those are, to use his own words, The Honest
Peoples just natural Right in Civil things, and true Freedom in matters of
Conscience. I shall beg your and our Authors pardon if I transpose his Order,
and give things of the first concernment the first place, by which I am tied to
proceed to answer that Head under this Title, of true Freedom in matters of
conscience: which he has defined, and given Reasons for, from the latter end
of his 5. page, to near the middle of the 8. But therein I doubt it will be found,
that he to be sure to bind up the Magistrate, has set at liberty all others.

I shall willingly agree with him, That in things of the nearest, and Highest
concernment, all possible tenderness ought to be exercised by the Magistrate.
But I must beg this excuse if I cannot think that in things of that nature he
is wholly excluded. He may sin in two extremes; In not doing, and in
overdoing; And me thinks, even what our Author himself says, That the Nations
of the world have Right and Title by the Purchase of Christ's blood to Freedom
in Spirituals; does at least evince, That none have right thereunto, which do
not own him, by whom only they can have that right, and therefore were all
others exempted from that power; such are not. Who shall punish blasphemers or
deniers of him that bought them? (A herefie branded by the Spirit it self by
the name of damnable.) Churches, as such, cannot do it adequately to the Crime,
since the highest of their actings is to separation or excommunication; and
what punishment is it for him that believes there is no God or Christ, to be
excluded from his public Worship, and ordinances? has God taken care that
his Glorious Name should not be blasphemed, from the beginning till Christ's
time, and afterward does not regard it to the end of the world? nor is it
competent to say that in the new Testament we read of no such power exercised
by any Christians as Magistrates: since it is evident that after some years
that the Lord Christ was come in the flesh, there were no Magistrates which
were Christians; but since any have been, it has been both the duty and care
of the good from time to time, by punishing, to bear their testimonies against
such evils, yea even when wickednesses have assumed the names of religion; for
Satan can transform himself into an Angel of light, a truth too evident and
sad in our days to be denied by any.

I shall ingenuously confess to you (Sir) I begin to suspect those most which
in soul concernments do cry for liberty most; the Bishops, how bitterly did
they inveigh against the inquisitors? and how soon, and exactly, when they got
the power, became they such? the Presbyterians whom the Lord made the rod to
whip those, you see how our Author whips them with the names of persecutors,
toward the close of his 7 page, and from them flies to the next sort of
Clergy (I wish his quarrel be not to those of that calling) for he ends
there, when, alas, too many others are even persecuting those Clergy as far as
they can, that is, with their tongues, and if not punished and deterred by the
Magistrate, would questionless do it with their Hands also; for it is, as to
the punishing of others, a short and easy step from declaring the guilt to
acting of its penalty. I have truly my self heard some averr, that they
esteemed it a religious duty to call such as we own to be Ministers of the
Gospel, hirelings, dumb dogs, Baals Priests, and sellers of the gifts of the
holy Spirit; where note by the way, these franticks confess these said
Ministers they so miscall, have the gifts of the holy Spirit; else they could
not make merchandise of them; for they cannot sell what they have not; nay they
are either so ignorant or malicious as to allow them the best gift, to accuse
them for employing it the wor^^ way, but if they have it, He ensure their
accusers they cannot so dispose of it; now I would gladly know where but from
the Magistrate shall such oppressed be relieved? since from such people
themselves, we cannot hope they will punish any of their own number, had they
any discipline amongst them; because that which is their fault, is a part of
their religion: but it may be said that this is a clear acted evil, and
therefore cognoscible by the Magistrate. I say so too; but those which are
guilty of it will deny it, and allege some internal dictate or impulse
carried them to do it, and therefore it is a part of their worship, to act what
the Magistrate and others think a part of their duty to punish. If it be said
they are mistaken; I desire to know who are competent judges therein; and they
will answer in our Authors own words, p. 6. about the midst of it; Why
should thou set at naught thy brother in matters of his faith, and
conscience, and therein intrude into the proper office of Christ since we are
all to stand before his Judgment seat, whether Governors, or governed, and by
his dicision only are capable of being declared with certainty to be in the
right or in the wrong, so that if you punish or restrain such people, you deny,
according to what our Author says, that right which the Nations of the world
are entitled unto by the Purchase of Christ's blood; and if you do not, you tie
up the sheep of the flock, whilst you let loose the Wolves, and while you cry
up liberty, you allow and authorize persecution; I say persecution, though it
be only of the tongue; and how sore a one that is, the Spirit does in diverse
places, witness, Job 5, 2. it is called the scourge of the tongue. Psalm. 57.4.
The tongue is called a sharp sword. And to pass by a cloud of other witnesses
in this behalf, Jer. 18.18. it is said by the ungodly there, which conspired
against the Prophet, Let us smite him with the tongue; which evinces this sort
of persecution is not only known to be one by the bad, but felt as such by the
good; nay, Michael the Archangel, Jude. 9 verse, though contending with the
Devil, durst not bring against him any railing accusation; and totally to stop
the mouths of such persecutors, and to manifest whilst they rail they cannot
pretend religion for it, see what James says, Chap. 1.26. verse If any man
seem to be religious amongst you, and bridle not his tongue, that man's religion
is vain. A clear and Fertile Scripture, and such as we have as much cause to
credit is Christ's sentence in that case, as if we had heard him pronounce it;
so that we need not doubt herein, or leave that to his final Sentence in
Heaven, which he by his Spirit has given us so explicitly on earth: we may as
well if any Blaspheme God, or deny the most Essential Fundamentals in
Religion, leave that also till the last Judgment to determine with certainty
whether such a man be therein in the right or in the wrong, as leave such men
only to such decision; we have nothing more for this than we have for that;
therefore I fear the Latitude our Author proposes will be so far from weaning
the people from that Biting, devouring, wrathful spirit he mentions, that it
will but provoke and allow it. It is easier for authority to bridle Men than
for men to bridle themselves; else why are there laws established in civil, or
discipline in spiritual things? such avowed Principles, as genuinely, and
naturally tend to the destruction of Society and government are not to be
tolerated in any, though assumed under the specious and high pretense of
Religion, which is so far from being destructive to either that it is the best
and strongest foundation and Cement of both. Who should have suppressed those
franticks of Munster but the Magistrate? should their p^ea of conscience have
tied up his hands? and would any (but of their number) have had him let them
murder as many as they would or could, and have stayed till the Last day to
have had it judged with certainty whether their murdrings by their pretended
religion had been right or wrong? Or should any in these days assume their
principles could any think the Magistrate without Breach of Trust and duty
could wait patiently till they were acted? I am certain if it would be too
soon for him to do any thing before, then it might be too late for him to do
it afterward; how if a growing society of men should own as a Scripture truth
that none have title to be governors, but the saints (though truth it self
has told us, that the Kingdom of the King of the Saints is not of this world,
and that having food and raiment only, we should therewithal be content) and
that none are saints but themselves; every Magistrate therefore that is not of
that feather, must be either excluded, or be judge over his brothers
conscience; who has so complexed, and inter-woven things of government, and
things of conscience, that none can separate the one from the other, nor be a
judge in one, but in both.

I shall, Sir, willingly and clearly agree, that in opinions of religion,
though their professors differ from the truth in the judgment of the
Magistrate, yet if they are so innocent as to be prejudicial in their act or
in their direct consequence unto none but those which embrace them, all
possible gentleness, and forbearance ought to be exercised toward such; and
it is a Duty to endeavor their restoring in the spirit of meekness,
considering lest we also be tempted; but I beseech you (Sir) observe how our
Author designs that the liberty he mentions, should not be infringed, viz.
Even by laying a restraint therein upon the supreme Power before it be
erected, and this as a fundamental constitution amongst others, upon which the
free consent of the people is given to have their Persons brought into the
exercise of the supreme Authority over them, and on their behalf, as it is
expressed, toward the middle of the 7th. P^g. By which, methinks, it is
evident that our Author would have no supreme Authority set up till they are
tied to that which would make them merit to be pulled down; and I must plainly
confess, I know not who those can be (according to his grounds) which can lay
a restraint upon the supreme Authority, either before or after its erection;
For it must be either by a part of the good people, or by all; it cannot be by
all; for the restraint must be laid before all be met in a capacity to act, and
it is an act to lay a Restraint; and if by a part, by what right can they lay
restraints upon the whole? that were to do what the Author most complains
of; how ever I will make use of this passage in this seventh page, to reply to
a part of his thirteen page, wherein he laments, and earnestly asks, why so
refined a party of men are not instructed with their right? which question I
will answer with another, if they are not capable and fit to be instructed with
their rights, why does he complain that they are not? and if they are, why
would he deny them, and fetter them in the things of the noblest concerment,
or doubt their honesty, if this particular be not their right, that they would
declare so much, since it is in a matter so evident and clear as he alleadges
this is.

But that you may see whether this refined party did fight for that Liberty he
mentions, observe I beseech you what they did either in their defusive
capacity, or as represented in or by their Parliament, in which most properly
they speak and act.

As to the first, you shall have our Authors own words and observation to clear
it, which also he accompanies with this expression, that it is a thing will not
suddenly be out of memory, viz. when the last King made war against the Scots,
he was deserted by all the good people of England; whereby it is evident, those
which he calls persecuting Presbyters, were owned as good men by the good
people; and whether those do allow of his freedom is as clear by the title he
gives them of persecutors. As to the second, I appeal to his own conscience,
whether he does not know, and believe that the people represented in the long
Parliament, (and I think he will own none other since which have acted, to be
a true representative) had not begun to establish, and would not have continued
that discipline in Church affairs which he calls Persecuting: so that as yet
whatever has been declared by the people diffusively or collectedly, has been
contradictory to our Authors liberty. And possibly this may be the cause why,
though he cries them up for so refined a party and fit to be trusted, yet that
in this particular he would bind up their hands absolutely and not trust them
at all, I will hope our Author is not popishly inclined, because of his
expressions in the latter end of his seventh Page (viz) That by what be
proposed a great part of the outward exercise of antichristian Tyranny and
Bondage would be plucked up by the roots. Yet permit me to say, if his notion
be practiced, he has left as free a latitude for the exercise of the
profession of the Papists, as for the profession of the Truth, and this I am
confident the Honest party of this Nation never did design; and if our Author
does, he had need truly to shackle and manacle their Representative before they
fit, since they will never do that to themselves after they sit. But that you
may see how little cause our Author has to be offended in this particular,
read but the 36, 37, and 38. Articles of the Government, wherein so large a
latitude is allowed in matters of conscience, that I think no man has reason
to repine that he has not enough. I wish some good men do not think, if any
cause of complaint be, it be not on the other hand. But if our Author will not
credit the Government, I desire but that he will credit himself, to evince the
truth of what I assert; For in the upper part of his eight Page he makes use of
these very words, That therein (viz. true Freedom in matters of Conscience)
the present Governors have been willing very eminently to give their testimony
in their public Declarations; so that what grievance is found amongst us
therein, is in probability more from the officiousness of subordinate Ministers
than otherwise. Our Author not condiscending to set down either wherein such
subordinate Ministers have been too officious, or the persons who have been so,
methinks evidences that any cause of grievance therein is rather pretended than
acted; For if any such really and actually had been, it is not likely they had
remained uncomplained of, since thereby one of these two Ends had been
attained, a Redress of the ill, or, failing thereof, a clear Discovery that
such Declarations and Laws were only intended to delude and not protect such
tender consciences; either of which carry in them too much cause of
satisfaction or complaint to have been unessayed, had there been grounds for
it: And it is very improbable that our Governors should make Laws not to
observe them, whereby they must not only have been found guilty of Hypocrifie,
but also by sleighting their own Rules in some cases have invited the people to
have done the like in many, if not in all others.

Having thus (Sir) expressed unto you my poor apprehensions concerning this one
General relating to true Freedom in matters of conscience; I shall proceed to
the other, which is, the Peoples just Right in civil things, which our Author
makes chiefly, if not only, to consist in enjoying the Freedom to set up meet
persons in the place of supreme judicature and authority amongst them; In which
I believe, things being thoroughly examined, there will remain as little cause
of complaint as in the former; For in that particular the government has been
signally and justly careful to provide, as may appear from the sixth to the
twentyfifth Article of it, by which we are more safe therein than ever we yet
were, and possibly as safe as the nature and quality of such a thing can well
admit: But perhaps our Author is not satisfied that any which have been against
us, should be restored, after three Triennial Parliaments, to a capacity of
being elected, or of becoming electors of Members in succeeding
Representatives: If that be the quarrel (as some of his expressions seem to
infer) I shall desire him to read but his own words about the midst of his
seventeenth Page, wherein he says; If as the Foundation of all, the
Sovereignty be acknowledged to reside originally in the whole Body of adherents
to this cause, whose natural and inherent Right thereunto is of a far antienter
date than what is obtained by success of their Arms, and so cannot be
abrogated even by conquest it self, if that were the case, etc. Which words if
true, methinks clearly prove, that our Governors have done those people whom we
through the providence of God have conquered, more wrong in debarring them so
long, then the Good people in debarring them no longer; For if it be such a
natural and inherent Right that even conquest it self cannot abrogate it, how
come they to lose it? And if it be said that none have a Right thereunto but by
adhering to the Good cause, then our Author contradicts himself, since he
says this Right is of a far antienter date than what is obtained by success
and arms. But in my opinion the Wisdom and Care of those which compiled the
Government, is signally evident in this particular; for so long our enemies are
excluded as a competent time to wear out that heat and animosity which they
have contracted against their conquerours; As also to let them relish and
thoroughly know the sweet and benefit of this Government above that which they
contended for; And possibly too, as a time for trial of their good behavior,
which it is likely they cannot counterfeit so many years: And they are excluded
no longer, nor for ever, lest it should perpetually entaile those Divisions
which in wisdom and charity we should endeavor to Heal and Cement. Besides,
our Author near the latter end of his twentieth Page mentions, as a necessary
thing, that when the supreme authority should be convened, according to his
device, one of their first Acts should be to pass an Act of Oblivion, which
doubtless is not that our enemies should forget they ever had a Right and Title
to elect or be elected; Or if this be meant, I think all things else will
appear rather a Name than a Thing.

But since that contraries being opposed, do the better illustrate and set
forth each other, let us take a prospect of what ou^ condition was before the
war, and our now government, and what it is by it. The King was never bound to
call a Parliament, at least never did but when he could hardly avoid it: the
Protector i^ tied to call a Parliament every third year, sometimes oftener. The
King when a Parliament was called, could or did at his pleasure dissolve it:
the Protector when a Parliament is called, cannot dissolve or prorogue it
without its own consent till five months b^ effluxt, a time competent to make
or repeal Laws, and call t^ account and punish the great offenders, the true
and proper end of Parliament. The King had or assumed a Negative Voice to al^
Bills presented to him by the Parliament; Or at least denye^ them with a French
complement, Le Roy S'avisera: The Protector has but twenty days Deliberation,
and then if not by common consent altered, they pass without him. The King in
the intervals of Parliament was not yoaked with any council which had a
Negative upon him: The Protector is. The King chose all his Council: The
Protector, excepting the now Council which could not be a avoided, in effect
chooses no more; but the people do it in their Representatives; for they
nominate All that are to be chosen, though the Protector out of such so
nominated does at last choose; And for the Council that now are, what can
Parliaments desire more than if they Govern well to have the people enjoy the
Benefit? If ill, themselves to avoid the Blame, to act the redress, and to
impose the Punishment? Had a Parliament nominated the Council, they could have
had but the satisfaction of their own opinions that the Council would have
acted as they ought; and the opinion of an Assembly never made a man other than
he is; But the Punitive power being ever in their Hands, they are as safe as a
thing of that nature can admit; No authority can prevent a man's being evil, it
can but punish him for hi^ having been so. The King made all his great Officers
in the three Nations without the Knowledge or Consent of the Parliament: The
Protector can make none without both. The King commanded the Militia,
absolutely; and by our desiring it from him, even when our Prisoner, we
implicitly owned that right was in him; the Protector can do nothing with the
Militia, a Parliament setting without their consent; and in their intervals
without the council, who are a kind of representative of the people. The King
not only as such, but by virtue of the Laws had thereby so ensnared the
consciences of good men, that without being Rebels they could not shun being
Martyrs if they continued in this Commonwealth: the Protector by the government
has taken off those Inquisition-like and severe Laws, and not only does admit
but protects all such as profess faith, in God by Jesus Christ, though
differing in judgment from the doctrine, worship and discipline publicly
held forth, so that they abuse not this liberty to the civil injury of others,
nor to the actual disturbance of the public peace, and do not under this
profession hold forth and practice licenciousnesse: provided that liberty
extend not to Popery. A wholesome provision which our Authors liberty has
quite left out or forgot.

These, besides many others, are the rich and high fruits of those victories
which the Lord in Mercy has given his people, which are such, that if any
things are capable to compensate the expense of so much time, treasure, and
precious blood, these are; and indeed we seem hardly to want any thing but
grateful quiet spirits, under what we possess. By all which it is evident,
that the peoples just rights in civil things (which our Author makes chiefly,
if not only to consist in free national assemblies) are not only comprehended
in the government, but so explicitly set down that he which runs may read,
which makes me hardly abstain from repining at any man that shall endeavor
to loose this knot, and cast away our present certainties, only to try new
experiments and conclusions; but possibly our Author will not be satisfied,
unless things of a civil nature be left at as much uncertainty as those of a
spiritual; for toward the latter end of his 20 page, he has these expressions
(viz) the people represented in their highest state of Sovereignty, as they
have the Sword in their hands unsubjected unto the rules of civil government,
but what themselves assembled to that purpose do think fit to make. By which he
seems to infer, that by our success we have fought our selves into nothing
but what hereafter shall be established. I think very few men when the war
began, did engage in it upon that account, and for that end; for my part I did
not, though in prayers, in counsel, in person, and in Purse, I have been of it
from the first day till this hour; the Parliament by their declaration stating
the grounds of their taking up Arms, which invited all the good people
thereunto, mentioned no such thing; but on the contrary enumerated those rights
which were denied to them, and those wrongs which had been obtruded on them;
the first of which they sought to obtain, and the last to repair and
vindicate; and indeed to my poor capacity it would seem a kind of enchantment,
thatthings prosecuted should be real and certain when they were fought for,
and should turn into shadows and notions when acquired by the defeat of him
who denied them. It would doubelesse extenuate the crime of the common enemy in
doing what they did, had they known we designed what our Author does; no
doubtless, we had a known right to fight for before Arms were taken up, which
by victoriously defending, and regaining we have not lost; but perhaps some may
say, our Author ascribes this boundless power to what the people duly
assembled in their Representatives may act; but I find what he speaks is not
of what they may do, as an effect of their Authority, but what is done as an
effect of Conquest.

Our Author prosecutes his treatise in telling us first the qualifications of
the persons which have adhered to this cause; secondly, the capacity wherein
they have been found from time to time carrying it on. As to the first, he
says, they have constantly showed their forwardness in it, in Purse, Person,
or counsel as the cause is truly stated in the two branches thereof, already
spoken unto, as it is more largely expressed from the midst of his 8 page, to
the midst of his 9 page; only I am to observe that one mark of their
qualifications, has been that in order to those ends, they have stood by the
Army in defense and support thereof, against all opposition whatever; that is,
not only against the common enemy, but against the Parliament it self; first,
when one of its two estates did not their duty, and also when the other sailed
in theirs. And the Author does give you an excellent reason for their having so
done, (viz) As those that by the growing light of these times have been taught
and led forth in their experiences to look above and beyond the Letter, Form
and outward Circumstances of Government, into the outward Reason and Spirit
thereof, therein only to fix and terminate, to the leaving behind all empty
shadows that would obtrude themselves into the place of true Freedom. Which
words are expressed about the midst of his ninth page; And I believe are set
down by him, not only to justify what is past, but to authorize what may be
acted in the future; for if it be allowable in preceding times, it may in
parallel or resembling cases be allowed in times to come; And what a gap or
rather breach this would open for all confusions and disorders, is so clear,
that to spend any time in illustrating of it were to make it seem less evident
than it is. Doubtless (Sir) we of the Army had a better Warrant for what we did
than this assertion of His; And if breach of positive engagements on the one
side, and of an invincible necessity on the other, could or did ever authorize
such procedure as ours, we shall have no more cause to blush in owning it than
I hope we shall ever have again to repeat it. But I shall not insist upon this
point, because I write only for, and to a Person, that I know has no doubts in
it.

I will now return to observe what consistency there is between my Authors
expressions in his foregoing words of the ninth Page, and his subsequent ones
in the tenth; In which, having erected his supreme judicature, he tells us; unto
the wisdom of their Laws and Orders the sword is to become most entirely
subject and subservient, and this without the least cause of jealousy or
unsafety to the standing Army, or the Good People adhering to this Cause. But
suppose that the Army or a part of the Good people should dislike the actings
of their supreme judicature, (as what has once been, may rationally be thought
may be again) and this upon the account (as they may allege) of the growing
Light of these times; And how far it may grow before it cease God only
knows, since even in a few years time it has been Bright enough to show Some
(as our Author would have it) how to look above the letter, form, and outward
circumstances of Government into the inward Reason and Spirit thereof, and to
make some individuals better and more competent Judges of all these, than those
which even those self same individuals had empowered to judge and act for them;
Nay, than such as all the whole Nation had Authorized for the like ends; Our
Author in such a Case either must not allow this Latitude to some particulars
above the whole, and thereby exclude them from the benefit of this
extraordinary growing Light, which once was wisely and happily made use of; and
therefore may the better be trusted unto to Act again by; Or must allow it
them; and then that subjection and subserviency mentioned by him, vanishes by
his own confession into Air, and with it not only the form but essence of all
Government. He must I doubt extinguish this new growing Light ere he calls his
suprem judicature; or else it will grow near to extinguish them.

But indeed our Author in the same ninth Page when he comes to acquaint us with
the capacity wherein these persons qualified as aforesaid have acted, He tells
us very ingenuously; [That it has been very seldom if ever at all so exactly
and in all points consonant to the Rules of former Laws and constitutions of
Government as to be clearly and fully justified by them any longer than the Law
of success and Conquest did uphold them who had the inward warrant of justice
and righteousness to encourage them in such their actings.] What this inward
warrant is cannot with more difficulty be made out than if allowed at all,
easily pleaded and assumed by any as well as the Good people: But since such
invisible warrants may be indifferently pretended by Both, 'twil be wisdom to
leave no Rise for their being pretended unto by either; which, God be praised,
our now Government has done.

In our Authors 16, and 17th pages He does much complain that any Party should
ingross and assume to themselves the office of Sovereign Rule and Power, and
impose themselves as the competent judges of the safety and good of the whole,
without their free and due Consent, Adding; That this is that Anarchy which is
the first step and rise to Tyranny, and lays the Grounds of manifest confusion
and disorder, exposing the Ruling Power to the next hand that on the next
opportunity can lay hold on the sword. etc. But he will do well to Remember
that he has not only already allowed this, but commended it; And how if
hereafter a part of the whole again should have an inward warrant to pretend
the like, will not he permit such to try by the Law of success and Conquest to
uphold that inward warrant of justice and righteousness which encourages them
in such their actings? it will behard to commend this in some, and condemn it in
others; Nay twill seem unjust not to permit those which have the principle it
self, to try to act that, which only can, and, which if it succed sufficiently
will (as our Author says) justify it.

But indeed it is harder for us of the Army to have our Case thus egregiously
mistated, though we must confess we are very much obliged to our Author, who
having so wrongly set it down, does yet excuse us in it, nay does extol that
in us, which he himself says will be the way to Anarchy, confusion and
Tyranny in all others.

If our Author be not a Soldier, sure he has a mind to be one; for he tells us
in the midst of his tenth page, That the Military interest and capacity is the
interest and capacity of the whole Body of the good people, and that in that
posture they are most properly sovereign, and possess their Right of Natural
sovereignty. For my part, I shall clearly confess I do not understand that
there is, or ever was originally a natural sovereignty in any Society; For no
Society is by nature, but by pact or agreement; and till such pact or
agreement, every individual was naturally in a state of War, like Ishmael whose
hand was against every one, and every ones hand against him, which wild and
unsafe sovereignty all men being sensible of, laid it down upon agreed on
conditions, by which all were obliged to help each other in the defense of
their common Bargain; So that no Body of People have sovereignty by nature but
by pact; And we have doubtless a better and more firm Right than this natural
one which our Author mentions; I mean a Legal Right, to which all have
subjected themselves explicitly, and by which no evasions are left for
Disobedience, at least fewer than in that natural Right our Author mentions,
which possibly never was, nor ever will be defined in all the particulars and
branches of it. But if our Author be not already a Soldier, I think it will be
best to keep him from being one. For he that talks of the Army's Continuing as
long as the good People, which he clearly does in the latter end of his tenth
page, wherein he mentions Their continuing every one with their Army, is not
fit to be of it; for I verily believe there are few, if any, amongst us (at
least known or avowed) but are more troubled there is cause to keep up the
Army, than they would be that there were none, and they forthwith disbanded.
But before I proceed farther, permit me I beseech you to observe one expression
more in the same page, (viz) The good peoples Army raised by them, wherein he
does sure allude to what should be if his Utopla took place; and consequently
that a new Army should be raised; or else why is it said raised by them?
Continued by them, had been more significant and clear, if his sense had not
been such as I understand it to be; and indeed all his expressions are so full
of strength and light in what he does set down, that this expression makes me
the more confident I have hit upon his intentions in those his words, which if
I have, many genuine Inferences may be thereby collected, which may well
manifest the design our Author drives at, but indeed are too voluminous for a
Letter.

But I cannot omit one passage of his in his 11. page toward the midst of it,
(viz) The Army putting themselves with their fellow Adherents to the cause
under the Rule and Authority of their own supreme Judicature, they lose not
their Power or sovereignty; but by becoming one civil or Politic
incorporation with the whole party of honest men they do keep the sovereignty,
as originally seated in themselves, and part with it only but as by deputation,
and representation of themselves when it is brought into an orderly way of
exercise, by being put into the hands of Persons chosen and entrusted by
themselves to that purpose.

By which words he would infuse into the people, that the Army believe they
have acquired the sovereignty over all; which, if true, might justly render us
worthy of the hatred even of our friends and brethren; nay by his words he not
only makes us enslavers of the people in this age, but may possibly make us the
like in ages to come; for if the original right is in us as the Army, and we
part with it but by deputation, we may as well recall our right from those to
whom we shall depute it. Whereby the Army shall become indeed the supreme
Authority, and as our Author has designed it, the Army shall always be.

We are, the Lord knows, but too ill of our selves, and need no such Painters,
who through design, or ignorance, draw us worse than through mercy we are, or
I trust ever shall be; he says, we are lovely in those clothes he has Clad us
with, but makes all others to be monsters which shall wear the like. Having
now I hope evinced unto you, that by the government we are now through
providence under, the people enjoy true freedom in matters of conscience and
their just right in civil things, and those to be conveyed to them by their
Representatives duly chosen, and not fettered or manacled, as our Author would
have them, I shall now proceed to what remains.

He tells us in his first and 2 pages, That this cause has still the same
goodness in it as ever, and is as much as ever in the Hearts of the good
people who have adhered unto it; that it is not less to be valued now, than
when neither blood, nor treasure were thought too dear to carry it on; that the
persons engaged in it, are still the same as before, with the advantage of being
more tried, more inured to danger and hardship, etc. All which being granted,
methinks, does clearly infer that the good people, by their continuing quiet,
do evidently confess they have got what they chiefly contended for; or that
what remains unacquired, is not worthy to be solicited by engaging in new
wars, or hazarding what through mercy they now possess; possibly we have not
all we aimed at, and possibly it is well for us as well as others that we have
not. There are many things men would endeavor to obtain, when a war is made,
which they will not make a war to obtain; besides it is likely we are but too
positive in not acquiescing in any thing short of all we drove at, which may
have justly provoked the Lord to have denied us our hearts wish, that we might
have more of dependency upon his good will, and less of estimation for our own
designs and resolutions.

Our Author tells us that if a supreme representative, were constituted as
aforesaid, hardly afterward any new thing would stick, as to the form of
administration, and descends to a standing council of state settled for life,
whose orders should bebinding in the intervalls of national assemblies as far
as they were consonant to the settled Laws; the vacancy or death of any of
which to be supplied by the vote of the Major partof themselves (but herein the
people are more beholding to the government, than to our Author; for by it,
the people in their Representatives, choose such counselors, and do not permit
them to choose themselves, which if allowed, might entaile both them and
Faction, upon the people) Nay he continues) would there beany just exception to
be taken, if it should be agreed as another part of the fundamental
constitution of the government, to place the branch of sovereignty, which
chiefly respects the execution of the Laws, in the hands of one single Person,
and for the greater strength and honor unto this office, that the execution of
all Laws and orders, that are binding, may go forth in his name, and all
disobedience thereunto, and contempt thereof, be taken as done to the peoples
sovereignty; whereof he bears the Image or representation etc. And then again
in the same 18 page. Would such an office as this, thus stated, carry in it any
inconsistency, with a free state? Nay, if it be well considered, would it not
be found of excellent use, to the wellbeing of Magistracy, founded upon this
righteous bottom, that such a Lieuetenancy of the peoples sovereignty, in
these three Nations, may always reside, in some one, or some more persons, in
whose administration that which is reward and punishment, may shine forth.

By all which, Sir, you may evidently perceive he is so far from being against
those main hinges and Pillars upon which our Government moves, and by which it
is supported, that he gives pregnant and strong arguments for them; only he
would have the people do it, and I say they have done it already, even in the
choice of their last Parliament, and in the Parliament it self; nay, I dare
aver that never any Government in the three Nations, was more fully and
explicitly owned by the people, than this now in exercise has been; neither
ever yet was any form of Government more clearly exposed to the peoples
judgments, nor received by them than this has been. I am certain that
Commonwealth was not, which we so lately have extricated our selves out of, and
which possibly our Author may not be undesirous to have us revert unto; for
that mutation was made only by the remnant of a Representative, in which too
many of the people had none to speak or act for them: But this form of
Government we now are under (viz.) by a single person and a Parliament, was
sent down into every Shire and County of the Nations, that none (except enemies
and people not worth 200. l.) might pretend ignorance, or be denied his opinion
and vote; and upon such proof and trial, the people not only embraced it, but
even tied every individual of their Representative not to alter it. But our
Author may say, that indenture by which they did so, was sent down to them to
sign; and I say, but it was signed by them; the Government did but offer the
condition, but 'twas the people did accept it; Our Author may farther say,
'twas a few of the people did so; to which I answer, that either those which
did it were the greater or the lesser number of the people; If the lesser, how
comes it about the greater did not oppose it? if the greater, the objection
ceases. If all are summoned, and all do not appear, those which do are to be
reputed as all; else no election could be made or esteemed valid.

Our Author speaks of a general Council or Convention to be called by the
present power, but considered as general, which Convention, though chosen by
the Body of all the Adherents to this Cause, are not yet to exercise their
Legislative power, but only to debate freely and agree upon the particulars
that by way of fundamental constitutions shall be laid and inviolaby observed
as the condition upon which the Body so represented does cast it self into a
Civil and Politic Incorporation, etc. as is more at large set down in his
20th page. I beseech you Sir take notice of these words [ the Body of all the
Adherents to this Cause] without taking care (as anciently) that none but
freeholders should choose or be chosen in Shires; or as our Government has now
well provided, that none shall choose or be chosen, but persons worth 200 l.
that is, men who probably by their substance have not only some competent
degree of understanding who to choose, but also some interest and cause to
choose well, as having purses which are likely and capable to feel it, if they
do otherwise: By which wild Latitude (if allowed) we might come to have as odd
work in things of a civil concernment, as our proposed liberty in spirituals is
like to leave us in, in soul concernments. Indeed a civil Authority so chosen
is likelier to introduce such dangerous liberties, than a Representative chosen
either by the old or the new rules.

But though I must commend our Author, who having proposed the end, sets up the
readiest way to attain it; yet I more commend our Government which has so well
provided against our great Representative's being in a capacity to be chosen by
the Refuse of the people, or to be composed of them.

Having made this (I think) needful digression, I shall now beg your leave
(Sir) to speak a few words both to the thing propounded, and to the manner of
acting it: To the thing, It is to be an assembly to agree upon fundamentals of
Government; which were in effect to do less well for the people then the
Government has already done; for there is no question if 'twere practicable
for all the people of the three Nations to transact their own business by
themselves without Representatives, it would be more clear and satisfactory for
them to do it in that way than in the other; And though the people do choose
those people for their Representatives which they most trust in, yet they trust
more in themselves than in such so chosen: Besides, it often so falls out, that
many of the people are unavoidably Represented by persons whom they have not
chosen; nay, against whose choice they have actually declared, as is evident in
the voices for Knights and Burgesses, where the majority of votes (though but
in one) excludes all others that are voted for: These being irrefutable truths,
I cannot but commend the wisdom and ingenuity of the Government, and the
happiness of the people, that an affair of this nature should be ordered so
advantagiously, that in the main form of the Government (viz.) whither it
should be by a single person and a Parliament, they have not been left
implicitly as our Author proposes, to the sense of their Representatives, but
have been made the clear and proper Judges thereof themselves; by which it
would be hard to tell, whither the people are more actually obliged in what the
Government has done; or intentionally disobliged in what the Author proposes.
Let this model proposed be but well considered, and let every reasonable man be
judge; our Author would have an assembly chosen by all the Honest Party, which
should agree upon fundamental constitutions of Government; which for ever
after, the supreme Legislative power should be obliged unto, and should not
have power to alter. Do but see in this what a weak thing all our Authors
discourse turns upon; These fundamentals are to be agreed upon by the peoples
Representatives, and to oblige the supreme Legislative power (which is to be
the peoples Representatives also) so, that the peoples Representatives once
met, are to oblige their Representatives for ever after: which is a thing not
only absurd in it self in the nature of it, but of the highest improbability in
the practice of it; for who can dream that Representatives of the people, when
chosen and met, will ever hold themselves obliged by any constitutions of
former Representations, farther then they shall according to time and
circumstance agree with their liking? since they all stand upon one foot of
power, as entrusted by the people; and the latter may as well, and by as good
right alter constitutions and laws agreed by the former, as the former could
make such: so that if our Author will trust the peoples Representatives at
first to make fundamentals, by as good reason he may trust them ever without
any at all, since that the power and choice of observing or not observing those
fundamentals will always rest in themselves, and this unavoidably so:
Doubtless the best way to convince our Author, were, a liberty given him to put
in practice his own new-framed Government; for then he would not fail to find
and experiment that unreasonableness and impracticability in it, which he does
not now see: Let but all matters of Government be left as rasa tal ula, to all
the Honest Party who have adhered to this good Cause, and I believe, whither
you respect them by themselves or in their Representatives, they will so little
agree with any of our Authors principles, from the beginning to the end of his
Book, that I doubt he would recurre again to that growing light he speaks of,
to make but letter and form of such conventions, (as he seems formerly to have
done) and find out some other way to justify and bring about those things he
aims at: Certainly our Author may design the overthrow of the present
Government, by defacing and blemishing of it, but cannot intend the setting up
of his own; he must needs know the force of his principles laid down (if they
have any) is more offensive to the present power, then any way defensive to
themselves. I have read most Histories, and do not remember that ever the like
to this has been practiced; either those in power in erecting of Governments
wanted the ability to find out so happy an expedient, or the honesty, if 'twas
found out, to afford it to the people. Our past Kings indeed had a faint show
of something like this; for at their Coronation, some few that assisted at it,
were demanded whither they would have the person to be Crowned to be their
King: But the difference betwixt this and that is vastly great; for first, This
was not to the form of Government, but to the person which was to govern.
Secondly, This was not to the people of the Nations, but to some designedly or
accidentally there. Thirdly, (to omit many other differences) As they were not
solemnly convened from all the Shires of the Nations, (neither indeed could be,
or their minds generally known but by that way the now Government has
practiced) so neither was there any thing of their assents given either
formally or legally. The contrary of all which is evidently to be found in the
now form of Government, which at once does manifest the unwillingness of those
in power to set up any model of Government that the people in their largest
capacity did not like, as also that the people did fully like this; both which
are so fignal and rare, that I beg your excuse, if that belief has made me
dwell too long upon this particular.

The next thing is, as to the Manner of calling such Conventions, It must be by
the present power considered as a General; and then our Author says, What is
done by it, is not in Danger ever to be broken, being made by the People in
their Highest State of Sovereignty as they have the Sword in their hands, etc.
This, Sir, I fear will be subject to many inconveniences; some I shall instance
besides those I have set down already.

First, it Authorizes a General, as a General, to Call a Parliament; and if
once the Protector, as a General, does do that, hereafter Generals
successively may pretend to the like privilege, and so our Government become
purely Military; To invite us to which, Our Author calls that, The Peoples
highest State of Sovereignty, in which they have their Swords in their Hands.
But possibly He may say, the now Protector as General did once already call a
Parliament; to which I answer, He indeed Called an Assembly, but 'twas that
Assembly Called themselves a Parliament; Besides, that was by his Call, not the
peoples Election. Secondly, If such a Convention were met, they might perhaps
agree to have a Supreme Magistrate (which too our Author doubts not of) who by
his Office should call Parliaments, and the General (if ever the Generals and
chief Magistrates Offices should be distinct) by that precedent, might pretend
to the like, by which we might have at once two Parliaments by two Authorities,
both having specious pretenses for both, which might prove too fruitful a seed
for putting the people too often into their Highest State of Sovereignty.

Thirdly, Though the Protector could assume the Chief Magistracy of this
Nation, yet he cannot Righteously relinquish it or the Government, if (to use
our Authors own words in another Case) Declarations to men and Appeals and Vows
to God fignifie any thing.

Fourthly, It will be madness in the Protector to annihilate that Government
of himself, which the People both by themselves and their Representative have
so far approved, only to call a Convention to try if they can light upon a
Government which the people may approve, which were no other in effect than to
take the Authors Opinion in the behalf of the people rather than their own in
their own Behalf, and that too doubly Declared. Would not such a proceeding
make us Ridiculous both to our selves and the world, to be so often changing
Foundations, especially in this Case wherein so little of Advantage can either
be enjoyed, or so much as hoped for? I cannot truly believe that our Author can
rationally expect that those in present Authority should relinquish a
Government which many Thousands have explicitly owned and embraced, only to
accept of a Proposal which he alone does offer; If he will be but patient till
he can bring as many clear proofs that his Notion is approved of by the
People, As the Government can that it is so, it will be then a fitter time to
Lissen to him than Now; And till then it will be but just, that the sense of
the Major part of the good people conclude His or the Minors, And herein I hope
the government do observe the Royal Law.

I omit, Sir, Many other things, because I cannot so much wrong my argument in
doing so, as I might your patience in doing otherwise; but as our Author has
had his conjecture, that nothing, as to a single person, would stick in his
proposed convention; so give me leave to have my doubt, that, that it self
would there stick, and if it should, who then could put a period to a
Representative, if it endeavored to perpetuate it self as some such thing I
have heard, was in design? And if the Protector had not played the Protector,
before he was such, it might have also been turned into act. The people would
then have had a good time to have complained to their Representative against
their Representative; and a worse, if they had endeavored to have righted
themselves by war, which yet would have been the only remedy. This thing alone
does, if nothing else did, sufficiently evince the good and necessity of a
single person empowered, as the Protector is, by the government.

I shall agree with our Author, that there is a high and visible necessity for
all the people that have hitherto embraced our common cause, to unite
themselves, were it only in point of security against a common enemy, who is
not out of work though at present out of sight (but I fear out of the Authors
observation, by his proposal) I would gladly desire that the inclinations and
propensity thereunto were as strong as the causes and incentives are; it were
happy if all good men, especially those of such signal and eminent parts, as
he by his treatise seems to be M^ster of, would employ them to make the best of
what is, rather than to perplex and blemish it, and thereby give opportunity to
that common enemy, he may so justly apprehend, to think our dissatisfactions
many and great, and improve his own interest by such knowledge.

I must crave his pardon if I cannot agree with him in what he mentions in his
22. Page, (viz.) That for these three years last past, there has been a great
silence in Heaven, as if God were pleased to stand still and be^ a Looker on. I
wish that what is his saying of Heaven, had been his own practice upon Earth;
Many of our enemies then had been ignorant of that he accuses the Government
of, and I freed from the trouble of answering such his Accusation: I must
clearly confess what he says in that particular is so far from being, in my
Apprehension, a truth, that it is a high mistake. And possibly I might not err
in saying, that the providence of the Lord has hardly been more active for
good in some ages past, than in but a part of that time, in which he says the
Lord has stood still, and been but a looker on; to evince which, consider I
beseech you, ere this government began, how unsettled and perplexed was our own
nation? Scotland and Ireland, large parts of this Commonwealth, all in a
flame; we engaged in a bloody war by sea with the Datch; the French, the
Spaniards, the Portugal, the Swede, and the Dane at best no friend, if not
actual enemies. But as soon as it was established (wherein, they saw we were
come to a hopeful consistency) as the first effects and fruits of it, part of
them paid for their peace, and all the rest implored it; Our Internal wars
forthwith were quenched; so that in effect, when our enemies saw us become
wise, they became so to; And the Terror of the Lord was upon all those who
before had sought our Ruin, which might be an effect of his gracious promise,
When a Man's ways please the Lord he makes even his Enemies to be at peace
with him: If a Sparrow falls not without a Providence, doubtless such
considerable Changes and Events are not signs that God has stood still and
been a Looker on; but rather that they are the products of his care and
tenderness toward his people, who may provoke his highest Judgment by their
so meanly esteeming of his highest Mercies. It Is true indeed we are now engaged
in the War with Spain; but it is as true that the Provocations and Causes of it
were too Great any longer to protract it, which is so clearly set down in the
printed state of that War, as to receive satisfaction therein, one need but to
Read that: it is confessed that hitherto this War has not proved so promising and
successful as many were confident it would, which I fear may have in part
occasioned it: But who ever observes the usual Method of Gods Dispensations
toward us, he will find even this it self is proportionate to most others:
Our Losses in the beginning being but to try our Faith; And as this has been
parallel to many others in the first part of it, so I trust it will be the like
in its Conclusion and Event.

I am certain it is not so considerable as only upon its own account to give
the Author a R^se to believe that God has been pleased for three years last
past to stand still and be a Looker on; To which there is but one thing else
that I can call to mind as a pretense to authorize this his Belief, and that
is, the Protectors and the last Parliaments not Closing, which truly was a
cause of sadness to all Honest Hearts; but it is hoped that the unhappiness
thereof will be by experience so set home upon all concerned, that it will the
more strongly incline affections to an union the next which is called, and
thereby though it did not prove our Blessing then, yet it may prove the cause of
it in the future.

Our Author says in his ninth Page, One Mark or Qualification of the Good
People was their standing by the Army in maintaining of their Cause. I wish
that Mark and Qualification may yet continne, and as the Armies of the three
Nations have by express Addresses fortified the hands of the Government by
their owning and Declaring for it, so that our Author and All the other Honest
People would fortify their Hands also in doing the like, that as Union has
hither to been the evincement of our good affections, so now that it might be
of our wisdom. Let our Author allow toward the settlement of this Government
but some of that growing Light he commended in pulling down the former, and all
may do well. Actions unconsonant to Laws and Constitutions of Government, are
much more tolerable for building up peace than for Dissolving it. Methinks it
may serve to quiet the Mind of the Author and Others to Consider that what we
have is much more than we deserve; and that by repining at having no more, we
may provoke the Eyes of Gods Glory, and invite him to make us feel we have too
much. Let us mend our inward Condition, and then our outward one will follow.
Let us seek first the kingdom of God and his Righteousness, and all such
things shall be added unto us. If this Government be not of God, let man
endeavor what he will to support it, it will fall: And if it be of God, let
man endeavor what he will to suppress it, and it will stand. Let us therefore
with patience expect what Issue he will be pleased to give it; For God is the
Judge, who in Governments as well as persons, puts down one and sets up
another. That good Advice, Meddle not with those which are given to Change, is
as pertinent for our Times as possibly for Any since 'twas first spoken. There
is a Scripture much upon my Heart (and with that I shall Conclude) which
contains, what every one is to do; then what All are to expect, and what to
avoid. I will hear what God the Lord will speak, he will speak Peace unto his
People and to his Saints; but let them not turn again to Folly; which that They
may not, is the earnest and Hearty prayer of

June 14. 1656. Yours in the Best and surest Bond.
