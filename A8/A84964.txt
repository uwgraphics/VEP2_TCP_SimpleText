TO The right Honorable THE COMMONS of ENGLAND Assembled in PARLIAMENT;
The humble Remonstrance of his Excellency Lord General Fairfax, and his
general Council of Officers held at St Albans, Thursday the 16. of November. 1648.
OUR Tender regard to the Privileges, and Freedom of Parliament on which our
hopes of common Freedom and Right do so much depend, and our late experience
what Offense many, (even honest men) seem to have taken, and what advantage
evil men have made of our least interposing, in any thing of Civil
consideration to the Parliament, has made us for a long time hitherto, (as it
should always make us even to utmost extremity,) to attend in silence the
Councels and determinations of Parliament concerning all matters of that nature
whatsoever; but finding you to have been of late upon those transactions of
highest moment, whereupon the life or death of all our Civil Interest does
depend, and that the public affairs in your hands (not without the influence
of forcible Impulsions from your Enemies, and such as have been stirred up by
them) are brought to the utmost crisis of danger (which calls upon every man to
contribute what help he can) and seeing no effectual help from elsewhere to
appear, we cannot be (because in conscience and duty to God and men, we hold
our selves Obliged in such case not to be) altogether silent, or wanting in
ought we can honestly say or do to hold off impending ruin from an honest
people, and a good Cause.

We are not ignorant, that that Rule of Salus populi suprema Lex, is of all
others most apt to be abused, or mis-applyed, and yet none more surely true, it
is too ordinary, (especially of late times) for men who either from intentions
of evil, or inordinate temper of spirit, would break those bonds of Law and
Magestracie which they find to restrain them, to frame pretenses of public
danger, and extremity thereof, and from thence immediately to assume a liberty
to break or else neglect, and fly above the due bounds of Order and
Government, and stir up others to the same, pleading privilege from that vast
large rule of Salus populi, etc. from such mis-applications, whereof great
disturbances do often arise and confusion is endangered; and yet we know the same
may be justly pretended and followed, and that (where it is from honest
public intentions, and upon clear grounds) with very happy effects: We have
seen, in this our age, several instances in both kinds, and the hand of God
bearing testimony, and giving Judgment for some, and yet against others where
the pretensions have been the same, or so like as it was hard for humane
judgment to distinguish. And indeed since the right or wrong of such
proceedings depends chiefly upon the good or ill, public or selvish, sircere
or corrupt intentions of the parties pretending (which humane judgment cannot
ordinarily reach into) and partly upon the justness, or caussesness, necessity
or lightness, of the occasion taken from those against whem the pretense is
(which again depends partly upon their carriages, and partly upon their
intentions, the latter whereof is not clearly or properly under man's judgment
and the former without a full knowledge of particulars not easy for man to
give a certain judgment of) therefore as the engaging upon such pretenses and
principles does always imply, and is for most part expressly accompanied with
appeals to God for Judgment, so it is the proper work of God to bear true
witness and give righteous judgment in such cases; and as he is always
engaged to do it sooner or later, cleerer or darker, so in this Age and part of
the world he has seemed both to make haste to judgment in such cases (to give
it quick and speedy) and also to make bare His Arm therein that men may see it;
and has appeared, as a severe avenger against such pretenders, (where it has
been in falsehood, and with evil or corrupt intentions) so also a
discountenancer thereof (even where't has been with good intentions, if not
necessary in the grounds, or from impatient temper of spirit,) and yet in other
Cases (where, as the ends have been public and the intentions upright, so the
grounds weighty, the case necessary in relation to those ends, and the
proceeding sober, temperate, and but proportionable to the ends, grounds, and
necessity) a just assertor and Patron of the Right and Vindicator of the
hidden Truth and simplicity of the pretenders by a glorious presence with
them, and success to them in such proceedings. Neither wants there ground for
men to make some judgment therein. For certainly he that engages upon such
pretenses really for public ends, and but upon public necessity or
extreamitie, and with a sober spirit, (all which must concur to their full
justification therein) will both try first all honest ways possible (with
safety in those ends) whereby he may accomplish them and avoid the danger (if
possible) with due regard to, and by concurrence or with preservation of the
Magistracy and Government unwhich God has set him, before he will fly to
ways of extremity, neither will he (when engaged therein) proceed further or
longer in that way against or without the Magestracie then that first
necessity or some other (emergent upon the proceeding) does justly leed, and
the security of the ends require (not driving that pretense of necessity
further to serve or advantage himself or perpetuate those ways of extremity)
but when the necessity or danger is over, and the public ends secured, will
return to Magistracy and Order again, and mean while so act in all as carefully
to avoid both injury to the innocent and offense to the weak, and as subjecting
or expecting, and ready to subject all to an indifferent and equal judgment,
(even of men) if and when it can be found and really endeavoring to find it.
For our parts both prudentiall considerations, and the experience we have of
the danger that is in the least breaking or letting loose or entangling the
reins of Order and Government, upon such pretenses makes us most tender of it,
(as that which is never otherwise to be used or admitted, then as a desperate
cure in a desperate case, and at the utmost peril as well of them that use it,
as of those for whom) and the experiences we have seen of Gods righteous
Judgments in such cases as it makes us not apt (without trembling and fear) to
think of such proceedings, so much the more strict to observe all the aforesaid
cautions concerning them, and yet where just occasion and a real public
necessity calls thereunto, not to fear such appeals to God for any outward
difficulties or dangers appearing to our selves therein; But both from divine
and humane considerations as we do and ever shall avoyde the occasions by all
means possible (even to utmost extremity) and do pray and hope we may never
come to it, so (if ever such extremity do happen to us) we hope (through the
grace of God) we shall be careful and enabled, both in the engaging and
proceeding therein; so to act as before the Lord, and to approve our selves
both to God and good men, and as submitting to the judgment of both. And
therefore though we are full of sad apprehensions of present dangers to the
public interest, and the extremity even at hand, yet we shall first in all
humbleness and soberness of mind, and with all cleernesse (as God shall
enable us) remonstrate to you our apprehensions both of the dangers at hand,
and of the remedies, with our grounds in both.

First therefore, we must mind You of Your Votes once past concerning no more
Addresses to the King, etc. and our Engagement to adhere to you therein:
Concerning which we shall not invite you to look back to any grounds thereof,
further then to what your selves declared and published thereupon, and what we
in that our Engagement did summarily lay down as our satisfaction therein: We
shall only wish it may be remembered how free you were therein, and what state
You and the Kingdom were in then, and how it fared with You thereupon, until
you began to recede, and how upon and since your receding.

For the first (what ever evil men may slandrously suggest in relation to
other matters, yet) in this surely none can say you were acted beyond your own
free Judgments, we are sure, not by any impulsion from the Army; since nothing
that ever past from us to you before did look with any Aspect that way, but
rather to the contrary; (we may speak it with sorrow and shame in relation to
that unbeleef or distrust in God, and those carnal fears of public
disturbance from which we had before been acted, so much the other way) so that
in that particular the juster Resolutions of this House did not only lead us,
but help to reclaim us, from thoughts too much wandering the contrary way.

For the latter you may remember, that when you took those resolutions,
discontent (even to distraction) did abound all the Kingdom over, in the
people, for the burden of numerous and unsettled Forces, and the oppression of
Free quarter by them, and in the Soldiers for want of pay and satisfaction or
security in point of Arrears and indempnitie (their discontents increasing
with their Arrears) and indeed the Soldiery (in regard thereof and of some
harsh provocations to them and your former uncertaintie in any way of
settlement) something loose toward your selves, and their proper Government,
and disposed too much, to disturbances amongst themselves. But upon those
Resolutions of yours against any further Addresses to the King, etc. (which all
men understood to imply some further intentions of proceeding in Justice
against him and settling the Kingdom without him) immediately the unsetlednesse
of men's minds and jealousies of several parties (concerning ones compliance
with and seeking advantage from the Kings partee against the other) were
greatly allayed, and (together with his opportunities and advantages to cajole,
or insinuate with one or other) did seem to be taken away, and it pleased God,
instantly to lead you into such other Councels and ways, whereby the burden
and grievances of Free quarter were immediately taken off, supernumerarie Forces
disbanded, the rest put into an established way of pay, the Arrears in some
measure secured, and further growth thereof prevented, the distempers amongst
the soldiery quieted, and they resetled in good Order and Discipline, and
their hearts (with all honest and sober men's) firmly knit unto you, and the
whole affairs of the Kingdom in an hopeful posture for a settlement.

But when, the House being called (as it were) on purpose for a settlement, in
stead thereof, upon what jealousies of some amongst your selves, what private
animosities, envyings and vindictive desires of others (giving up themselves,
with dispending or neglect of the common and public interest, to mind
particular interests and parties, and to seek and take advantages against their
opposites even from hoped (if not formed) compliances of common enemies and
appearances from Foreign parts on their behalf, whereby to work out revenge
against those they immediately maligned,) or from what crafty insinuations of
corrupt members and always false to the public interest or upon what other
evil principles, we are unwilling to remember or imagine; when (we say) upon
those (instead of a settlement upon the former foundation) you began to
entertain motions tending to the unsettlement of what you had resolved, and
when by that uncertainty and unsetledness of Councels appearing within your
selves, and the answerable insinuations and influences of several Members
(according to their several bents and desires unto their respective
Correspondents and Friends abroad, the minds of men without also became
proportionably unsettled, tossed too and fro with various apprehensions and
expectations which way things would bend, and all to see such vast uncertainty
of any settlement or end of troubles upon the Parliamentary account alone: then
(and not till then) began the generality of the people to be apt for any new
motions, especially such as looked toward a settlement any way; and then began
your enemies to conceive fresh hopes and confidences, and bestirred themselves
accordingly, to work your trouble, and their own advantages. The most subtle
and sober of them (dissembling the interest of their own party, and reserving
that at the bottom, as close and unseen as might be, and taking their rise even
from that unsetlednesse, and those grounds of jealousies and division they
found amongst your selves, and the several parties pretending to Parliamentary
interest, and from that disposition they found in one party by any means to
take advantage and revenge against the other) they made pretenses partly of
public Interest, and partly of the very particular Interests of that party
which they found most discontented amongst your selves, the foundations
whereupon to raise new disturbances, and therein to engage a numerous and mixed
party; but upon such grounds, and in such a way, wherein the Interest of the
King and his party were so incorporated throughout, as that the prosecution of
all the other Interests pretended (in the way that was laid) should carry on,
and at last set up that of the Kings and their own above all others. Thus, the
Army (which after all possible trials and temptations they found would never be
won to be their friends, so as to desert the Parliamentary and Public Interest
to serve their turns,) being therefore industriously by them (with the
furtherance of discontented parties amongst your friends) rendered the only
common Enemy, and they themselves (as it were) friends to all but it, and that
supposed party in Parliament and Kingdom that cordially upheld it: they and
their busy promoters of Petitions (stirred up by their Emissaries or Agents in
all Counties, for the engaging and cementing of this new formed and intended
general party) being all taught the same language, at first profess fair. For
the Parliament, or nothing against it; but to be for a full and free
Parliament, and to deliver it from the force of an Army; pretend for the
Liberty of the subject also (to free them from the oppression and tyranny of an
Army) to be for the Law of the Land against the Arbitrary power of a Faction in
parliament setting up and supporting themselves above Law by the power of an
Army; (whereas, in truth, their great and latest quarrel against the Army,
was, That it would not force the Parliament to comply with the will and
interest of the King, to the prejudice of the Kingdoms Liberties, and of the
power of Law therein, nor desert the Parliament in their adherence to these
against the King.) They pretended likewise to be much for the ease of the
people, to free them from Taxes and Contributions to an Army, to be for the
settlement of peace in the Kingdom, that there might be no need of an Army;
(whereas, 'twas indeed, their restless workings, and watching all advantages,
by parties within this Kingdom, or Foreign aids, to set up their own and the
Kings Interest, to the ruin of the Parliament, and enslaving of the Kingdom,
that did necessitate the Parliament to continue an Army and taxes to maintain
it.) They pretended for Religion too, and for Reformation, and the Covenant,
against an Army of Sectaries and opposers thereof: yea, they yet pretended even
for the Army it self (as to the Body of it, and all but a faction of Officers
in it, supporting themselves in power and dominion by it) that the Army might
be satisfied their Arrears, and go home: And for all these fair ends,
(presuming upon the Parliaments unsetlednesse and weakness, as not able, or
not knowing how to provide for any of these things of themselves without the
King) a personal Treaty with the King must be held forth as the only sovereign
salve. Thus the people being made to depend mainly upon the King for all, and
his Interest made necessary to all, the other pretenses were but made use of to
serve his ends, and an easy way made to set up him and his Interest above all.
As to the hypocrisy of these pretenses, we need say nothing more; The Lord
himself in our silence (even when by such pretexts, and their quick proceedings
upon them, they had made such engaging work for us in all parts, as gave us no
leisure to say any thing for the undeceiving of men, or vindicating our selves,
or so much as to make any public verbal appeal to him for it) has yet from
heaven judged them, and born a clear testimony against them in defeating, with
a small handful, the numerous parties, they had thus engaged within the
Kingdom, and drawn from elsewhere, (under the very same pretexts) to invade it;
and breaking the force of those designs, so cunningly and takingly laid, and
so strongly backed with advantages, as 'twas scarce imaginable (in humane
reason,) all things considered, how to avoid them.

But however (working upon that unsetledness in the peoples minds, which the
uncertaintie and Divisions in your own Councels had occasioned; and having the
advantage of that general disposition, in a burdened and troubled people, to
entertain any motions, and follow any party, pretending to end their troubles,
and ease their burdens, against the present party in power, from whom
immediately they apprehend them,) they made a shift to engage multitudes to
Petition for these things; and thence, under the pretense of freeing the
Parliament from force, to raise Arms and leavy War against it (at best) to
enforce their Petitions, and under the notion of freeing the people from taxes
to the Parliament, and quarter to the Army; to make them incur greater charges
and burdens, for the King and his party, and (by withholding their taxes from
the Parliament) to necessitate free quarter again upon themselves (which before
they were delivered from) and under the notion of settling Peace, and the
Liberties of the Kingdom, to break that we had, and engage the people in
another War on the Kings behalf, against the Parliament and their own
Liberties, and to get his party, (with Commissions derived from him,) into the
conduct and manage of it.

But whilst therein (with open force) they do their utmost to destroy and
subdue you, they omit not the driving on of that surest part in their design
(a personal Treaty) to deceive you. To promote which, they had (besides
numerous, and daily Petitioners from all parts, deluded and drawn in by the
aforesaid specious pretenses) the deluded multitude and rabble about the City,
with the old Malignants, new Apostates, and late discontented party, both in
the City and Parliament it self; the one at your elbows, the other in your
bosoms, pressing you incessantly: The Lords, in every thing (relating to the
Treaty) closing readily with the desires of the City Malignants, the Prince,
and all your Enemies; and in their Votes for the same, going before you, and
haling you after (although in things concerning the prosecution of the War in
your own, and the Kingdoms necessary defense; (especially in declaring with you
against those visible Enemies and Actors therein. (The Scots Army and others)
they would neither lead nor follow.) And when, at any thing propounded toward
the Treaty (wherein you found the very life of your Cause, and the Kingdoms to
be concerned,) you were loath to give up that, and thereupon made some stick;
then clamorous Petitions for a concurrence, come thick from the City, with
menaces insinuated; many debaucht Reformadoes, the desperate Cavaliers, and
rude multitude about the City, ring in your ears with raylings and threats,
many faithful Members, particularly frighted, or driven out of Town, forces
listed and gathering daily about you; and this, the City, neither taking course
to restrain, nor suffering their Major General to do it; but opposing and
incountring his and your Authority, in what he, by it, attempted for your
safety and freedom; and these courses never ceased, until you had fully agreed
to a Personal Treaty, on such terms, as His Majesty Himself was pleased to
entertain.

By these means, and such continued usage, from the City, and those in and
about it (at whose mercy, you were, while your Army was engaged at distance
against your Enemies in arms) by that time God had broke all their forces,
delivered most of them into your hands and crushed all their hopes of avayling
that way: We find them at last, drawn into this miserable inconvenience of a
personal Treaty with him, and his adherents, who had so long and uncessantly
tried all Interests, and wearied all friends in this, and many foreign
Nations, by force, to destroy or subdue you. In which, though we see more utter
and less avoydable danger to the Kingdoms Cause, and to all the godly and
honest people engaged with you, then before, in your lowest or worst
conditions, we ever yet apprehended.

Yet considering the premises, and how great the change is from Votes of no
more Addresses, to (not your wonted positive sending of Propositions anew, but)
a Treaty, a Personal Treaty, without any previous satisfaction or security, and
a Treaty upon what Propositions he should make, as well as your own (all which,
both Houses, yea, both Kingdoms have so often, and always before declined,
voted, and declared against, as delusive and dangerous, yea destructive, while
the Parliament was unquestionably most free.)

We cannot but conceive, That at that time, and in those Resolutions for such a
Treaty, the judgment of Parliament, was not with due, and former Freedom. And
therefore not dispairing, but that (as men drawn or driven into dangerous
straits) you may readily entertain, or at least, favorably resent, any thing of
Light, or encouragement, that may be offered toward the saving or extricating
of your selves, and those you are entrusted for: We shall, with all plainness
and faithfulness, represent to you our Conceptions, where the main danger seems
to lie, and where any way to escape. And we hope, 'twill be thought no
arrogance in us, or disparagement to your Wisdoms, since lookers on may
(possibly) see something, the gamesters do not.

For the evils and dangers of this Personal Treaty, had it been admitted to be
indeed with his person in Parliament (especially at London,) and in a full
condition of honor, freedom, and safety, (which had employed, That after all the
trouble, loss, hazard, and the expense of blood, and treasure he had put the
Kingdom unto, he should be admitted to his Throne, and Office, without any
satisfaction before given for what was past, or security against the like in
future,) the evil and danger thereof had been so visible, as nothing had need
to have been said to unfold it. As it is now admitted and qualified for
circumstances (the case being as't has pleased God to make it, That the King
has no power in field whereby to take advantages during the Treaty,) we shall
say nothing to any dangers of that kind (supposing no agreement) save to wish
you consider the opportunities of laying Designs for his escape, or otherwise,
and of settling future correspondences, which the company and confluence of such
persons about him does afford: But we shall chiefly consider, the great evil or
danger of seeking to him by Treaty, in your present case, and of an agreement
or accommodation to be thereby made with him, including his impunity and
restitution to his freedom, revenue, dignity, office or government.

Now, as to that, the great Questions will be,

1. Whether (as your, and this Kingdoms Case stands) such an Accommodation
would be: (First,) Just or good, and so desirable, or (if not,) where the
injustice or evillies? (Secondly,) Whether safe, and to be admitted, or (if
not) where the danger lies?

2. (Admitting that upon some suppositions, it might be good or safe,) Whether
yet it can be so, or such a one can be had in the way and conditions of this
Treaty, as the case stands?

If either in the General, or in respect of your and the Kingdoms present Case,
and of the way and conditions of this Treaty, it cannot be safe, then it
concerns the Parliament not to admit such an accommodation or agreement upon
this Treaty; and (though it might be safe, yet,) if it be otherwise evil, or
not good, then you have no reason, but to use any freedom or just grounds
remaining to decline it.

To these Questions therefore, because the safety or danger, good or evil in
Question, is chiefly in relation to the Public Interest of the Kingdom, and
not so much to particular men's, (though even the particular safety of such as
have engaged for the Public, is not to be neglected,) to lead our selves and
others to the clearer judgment in the point; we shall premise a stating of the
Public Interest in Question, in opposition to the Kings, and of his particular
Interest opposed thereto.

The sum of the Public Interest of a nation, in relation to common Right and
Freedom, (which has been the chief subject of our contest,) and in opposition
to tyranny and injustice of Kings or others, we take to lie in these things
following.

1. That for all matters of supreme trust or concernment to the safety and
welfare of the whole, They have a common and supreme Council or Parliament;
and that (as to the common behalf, who cannot all meet together themselves) to
consist of Deputies or Representers freely chosen by them, with as much
equality as may be, and those Elections to be successive and renewed, either at
times certain and stated, or at the Call of some subordinate standing Officer
or Council entrusted by them for that purpose, in the Intervals of the
supreme, or else at both.

2. That the power of making Laws, Constitutions, and Offices, (for the
preservation and government of the whole) and of altering or repealing, and
abolishing the same (for the removal of any public grievance therein) and the
power of final Judgment concerning War or peace, the safety and welfare of the
people, and all civil things whatsoever, without further Appeal to any created
standing power, and the supreme trust in relation to all such things, may rest
in that supreme Council: so as;

1. That the ordinary ordering and Government of the people may be by such
Offices and Administrations, and according to such Laws and Rules, as by that
Council or the Representative body of the people therein, have been prescribed
or allowed, and not otherwise.

2. That none of those extraordinary or Arbitrary powers aforementioned, may
be exercised toward the people by any, as of right, but by that supreme
Council, or the Representative body of the people therein, nor without their
advice and consent, may any thing be imposed upon, or taken from the people; or
if it be otherwise a tempted by any, That the people be not bound thereby but
free, and th'attempters punishable.

3. That those extraordinary power or any of them, may be exercised by that
supreme Council, or by the Representative body of the people therein, and
where they shall see cause to assume and exercise the same, in a matter which
they find necessary for the safety or wel-being of the people, their
proceedings and determinations therein, may be binding and conclusive to the
people, and to all Officers of Justice and Ministers of state whatsoever: and
that it may not be left in the will of the King or any particular persons
(standing in their own interest) to oppose, make void, or tender ineffectuall
such their determinations or proceedings; and especially (since the having of
good constitutions, and making of good laws were of little security or (...),
without power to punish those that break or go about to ^^^^throw them; and
many such cases may happen, wherein one former laws have not prescribed or
provided sufficiently for that purpose, or the ordinary officers entrusted
therewith may not be faithful or not able, duly to execute such punishments on
many offenders in that kind; that therefore the same Council or
Representative body therein (having the supreme trust) may in all such cases
where the offense or default is in public Officers (abusing or failing their
trust) or in any person whatsoever (if the offense extend to the prejudice of
the public) may call such offenders to account and distribute punishments to
them, either according to the Law, (where it has provided) or their own
Judgment (where it has not, and they find the offense, though not
particularly provided against by particular Laws, yet, against the general
law of reason or Nations, and the vindication of public interest to require
justice) and that in such case, no person whatsoever may be exempt from such
account or punishment, or have power to protect others from their judgment or
(without their consent) to pardon whom they have judged.

These things contain the sum or main of public interest, and as they are the
ordinary subject of civil contests in all mixed states, where they happen
betwixt the people, and those that have assumed or claimed a standing
privilege or prerogative over them, so they have been in this of ours. And
against these matters of public interest this King has (all along his reign)
opposed, and given himself up to uphold and advance the interest of his and his
posterities will and power; first, That there might be no such Common Council
(no Parliaments) at all, to restrain or check him, but that all these matters
of supreme trust concerning safety and all things else might rest in him and
his breast alone, without limit from or account to any on Earth, and that all
those extraordinary and Arbitrary Powers over the people, their Laws,
Liberties, Properties (yea, their persons and consciences too) might be
exercised at pleasure by himself, and such as he pleased to derive the same
unto; and as they were assumed, so how vastly and sadly ill they were exercised
by him to the prejudice and oppression of the people in general, and the ruin
or persecution of all the godly of the Land; yea, even of those that were but
sober and honest to civil Interest, surely (unless the greater pressures here
has since wrought himself or brought upon us, by necessitating the Parliament
thereunto, have swallowed up the former in Oblivion) we need not yet make any
verbal remembrance: To support himself in that state or height of Tyranny and
make it absolute, He raised his first and second Arms against his people in
both Kingdoms, when he found he could not keep up to that height, to have
all those extraordinary powers and matters of Supreme absolute trust in
himself alone, them be fell to play lower; that at least none of them might
be exercised by any other without him, no not by all the Trustees of the Land,
nor in any case though never so necessary for the releife or saving of the
people. That if (according to his former claim) his people and Parliament would
not admit him positively to oppress or destroy them at his will, yet by this
latter, they should have no power to redress agrievance, to provide for the
freedom welfare, or so much as immediate safety of themselves or the Kingdom,
but at and according to his pleasure; and for this (when the Parliament did
otherwise assume in point of immediate safety and punishment of Delinquents
without him) he raised his third Arms, and held them up so long and so much,
to the spoil and near desolation of the Kingdom, till God wholly broke them,
and brought himself captive into your hands. And in this, though he raised
them with the pretense only of opposing the exercise of those extraordinary and
Arbitrary Powers by your selves or any other without him, (which would not be
allowed himself to exercise alone,) yet in the raising and having raised that
force, he did by it assume and exercise all kinds of absolute and Arbitrary
Powers at his own will alone without Parliament; and how much further he would
have gone in exercise of the same, (had he prevailed as you) we may easily
imagine. But as to that part of his claim against the public Interest, viz.
That there might be no power in Parliament to provide for immediate safety, or
do ought else for the people but at and according to his will) how obstinately
(even since God gave him and his party wholly into your hands) has he
maintained and persisted in it, (even so long as from foreign parts, or
Allies, from Irish, Scots, from your own divisions or discontents of the people
(at the burdens he necessitated you to continue upon them) he had any hopes by
force to prevail against you or avoid any concession against that claim) and
of this his so many denials to the Propositions of Peace, which both Houses and
both Kingdoms have so often tendered and renewed, yea, of those four only
Bills, (concerning purely that public Interest, and but a small part of it,
together with essential precautions for a Treaty,) do aford abundant
evidence; As to which last tender, it is apparent he had no pretext left for
refusal, from either scruple of Conscience, matter of harshnesse to his party,
or ought else, but the mere Interest of will and power, to himself and his,
which some Scottish and other correspondencies (it seems) then gave him hopes,
yet by force to uphold; insomuch as upon that refusal (added to all the
former) you found it necessary at last to take up those resolutions of no
further addresses to him, but to settle the Peace of the Kingdom without him,
and secure it and your selves against him, and in order thereto to keep his
person in safe Custody at Carisbrook Castle. But when (his other claims so
far failing) it came to this, He that before would not have allowed the
Parliament or Kingdom a Power for safety but at his will, would (at least,)
make you know, that, nor You nor the Kingdom should have any Peace or quiet
without him, and that neither Parliament nor any Power on Earth (what ever ills
he had done,) might for it attach or meddle with his Sacred Person, no not so
much as to secure him from opportunities of doing more; and for this last part
of his Interest his fourth Arms, (the last war) was raised (by Commissions
from himself to the Prince, and from him to as many more as would take any)
and for the same, the Scottish Invasion was procured. The pretext or quarrel in
this last Engagement, seemed (as it were) to reach no higher then only to
rescue his privileged Person, and force the Parliament, yet in a Personal
Treaty, to seek Peace at his will, and to let them see they could not otherwise
have it, not might do ought against his person (no not to secure him from
doing further mischief) though he make War and refuse Peace never so long:
And for this last piece of his Interest (as opposite and destructive to that of
the Public as any of the former) though a Divine Testimony has been born
against it, as full and more glorious (if possible) then before, against any of
the rest as if God would thereby declare his designing of that Person to
Justice; yet the Parliament after all this, restoring him (without any
presatisfaction or security) unto a kind of Liberty and State, only that he
might appear in a capacity to Treat, and then by Treaty seeking their Peace,
and all their matters (before contended for, and (though God) gained against
him) to come now as concessions from his will, do clearly yield back that
last piece of his claimed interest into his hands again, and indeed
(therewith) seem to render a more real acknowledgement and yielding to him,
and against Parliament and Kingdom (as to the precedent just right of what
ever's now demanded or granted as from him,) then all his verbal wrested
concessions or confessions will be understood, to be unto Parliament or
Kingdom, as to any future clearing or assurance of those things.

But (to return to our purpose) The matters aforementioned being the maine
parts of public interest originally contended for on your parts, and theirs
that engaged with you, and thus opposed by the King for the interest of his
will and power, many other more particular or special interests have
occasionally fallen into the contest on each party; As first on the Parliaments
part, to protect and countenance religious men and godliness in the power of
it, to give freedom and enlargement to the Gospel, (for the increasing and
spreading of light amongst men) to take away those corrupted forms of an
outside religion and Church government, (whether imposed without Law, or
rooted in the Law in times of popish ignorance or idolatry, or of the Gospels
dimmer light) by means whereof, snares and chains were laid upon
conscientious and zealous men, and the generallity of people held in darkness,
superstition, and a blind reverence of persons and outward things fit for
popery and slavery; and also to take away or loosen that dependence of the
Clergy, and Ecclesiastical affairs upon the King, and that interest of the
Clergy in the Laws and civil affairs, which the craft of both in length of
time had wrought for each other; (which several things were the proper subject
of the Reformation endeavored by the Parliament.) Contrary wise on the Kings
party, the interest was to discountenance and suppress the power of
godliness, or any thing of conscience obliging above or against humane and
outward constitutions, to restrain or lessen the preaching of the Gospel, and
growth of light amongst men, to hold the community of men (as much as might
be) In a darksome ignorance and superstition, or formality in Religion, with
only an awful reverence of perions, offices, and outward dispensations
(rendering them fit subjects for ecclesiastical and civil tyranny) and for
these ends to advance and set up further forms of superstition, or at least
hold fast the old which had any foundation in the Laws, (whereby chains and
setters might be held upon, and advantages taken against such in whom a zeal
or conscience to any thing above man should break forth) and to uphold and
maintain the dependence of the Clergy and Church matters upon the King and
greatness of the Clergy under him, and in all these things to oppose the
Reformation endeavored by the Parliament. Also on the Parliaments party, their
interest (as well as duty) was to discountenance irreligion, profaneness,
debauchery, vanity, ambition and time serving, and to preser such especially as
were otherwise given, [ viz. conscientious, strickt in manners, sober, serious,
and of plain and public spirits.] Contrary to these, on the Kings party, it
was to countenance or connive at profaneness, looseness of manners, vanity,
and luxury of life and prefer especially such as had a mixture of ambition,
and vainglory with a servile spirit, rendering them fit to serve another power
and greatness, for the enjoying of some share therein to themselves; in all or
most of which respects, it has been the great happiness and advantage to
Parliamentary and public interest, that it has been made one (very much)
with the interest of the godly, or (for the name whereof it has been so much
derided) the Saints: as on the otherside the King's, one with their greatest
Opposites, by occasion whereof God has been doubly engaged in the cause, (
viz. for that, and for the righteousness of it.) And to this indeed (through
the favor and presence of God therewith,) the Parliament has cause to own
and refer the blessing and success that has accompanied their affairs,
which (accordingly as they have held square, and been kept close to this) have
prospered gloriously, and (wherein, or so often as this has been thwarted,
swerved from, or neglected in their manage,) have suffered miserable blastings.

Thus have we endeavored to give a just and plain state of the Parliamentary
or public interest, and the several parts of it, and of the Kings in
opposition thereto, which have been the grounds or subjects of contests all
along this Kings reign, and especially since this Parliament began, as may
appear in the beginnings, progress, and several steps of the contest. And by
what has been occasionally said herein, some judgment may be made, how far
safe or good the accommodation is like to be that can be expected by the
present Treaty But the several and opposite interests being thus stated, we
shall proceed more clearly to speak a little to the questions stated before,

First therefore, as to the goodness (which first implies the justness) of
such an accommodation, we cannot but suppose,

1. That where a person trusted with a limited power to rule according to
Laws, and by his trust (with express covenant and oath also,) obliged to
preserve and protect the Rights and Liberties of the people, for, and by whom
he is entrusted, shall not only pervert that trust, and abuse that power to
the hurt and prejudice of the generality, and to the oppression, (if not
destruction) of many of them, but also by the advantage of the trust and power
he has, shall rise to the assuming of hurtful powers which he never had
committed to him, and indeed to take away all those foundations of Right and
Liberty, and of redress, or remedy too, which the people had reserved from
him, and to swallow up all into his own absolute will and power, to impose or
take away, yea, to destroy at pleasure; and declining all, appeal herein to
the established equal judgment, (agreed upon as it were betwixt him and his
people in all emergent matters of difference betwixt them,) or to any judgment
of men at all, shall fly to the way of force upon his trusting people, and
attempt by it to uphold and establish himself in that absolute tyrannical
power so assumed over them, and in the exercise thereof at pleasure; such a
person in so doing, does forseit all that trust and power he had, and
(absolving the people from the Bonds of covenant and peace betwixt him and
them) does set them free to take their best advantage, and (if he fall within
their power) to proceed in judgment against him, even for that alone if there
were no more.

2. That if (after he is foyld in such an attempt, brought to quit that claym,
to confess his offense therein, and give them some verbal and legal
assurances of remedy and future security, and his Parliament and people
thereupon remitting or willing to forbear that advantage against him) the same
person, so soon as he finds himself a little freed from the advantage which
drew those Confessions and Concessions from him, shall go about to avoid or
overthrow all again, shall deny them necessary redresses or security, stop or
oppose them in going thereabout, deny them all power either of redress or
immediate safety, but at and according to his will, and assume the power to
avoid and oppose any thing they should do without him (who had so lately
forfeited all the power he had unto them) and for all this fly to force again,
raise it without limit, by it protect Delinquents from judicial proceeding,
and resume and exercise again alone (even fitting a Parliament) all the
exorbitant and unlimited powers he so lately disclaymed, proclaym that suppream
Council (by which he ought to govern himself and the Kingdom) Traitors and
Rebels (who had indeed so lately indulged him his first Treason and Forfeiture)
and on these terms maintayn a war many years against them (to the spilling
of much blood and desolation or spoil of a great part of the Kingdom) try all
means and interests by divisions and parties stirrred up within, and invasions
from abroad to lengthen it out longer, and (after he was subdued, wholly in
their power, and at their mercy) to revive and renew it, multiplying
disturbances, and never ceasing till he had wearied all friends in his own and
neighbor nations, or so long as any hopes were left whereby possibly to prolong
it; and all this merely to uphold the interest of his will and power against
the common interest of his people; such a person in so doing (we may justly
say is guilty of the highest Treason against the highest Law among men, but
however) must needs be the author of that unjust war, and therein guilty of
all the innocent blood spilt thereby, and of all the evils consequent or
concomitant thereunto.

Now (to assume hereupon) whether the King have not, in the same case, acted
all these things and more, we dare appeal to the story and evidence: If he
have not, or can justly allege and make it appear, that what he has acted
thereof has not bin for the interest of his will of power, or not against the
public in terest of his people; or that the Parliament or any particular
party in the Kingdom have raised or continued the war for private interests
of their own, and not for that public interest of the Kingdom (which we
have before stated) but that they might have had all that cleared and assured
to the Kingdom with quietness, and would not accept it, let him then be
acquitted in judgment, and the guilt and blame be laid where else it ^s due.
But if indeed he has acted such things and in such case (as before expressed)
and all for the particular interest of his will and power against the Public
Interest of the Kingdom, then (without mention or consideration of ought he
has done against God and godliness, or godly men, and though we have touched
but a few of those many moral or civil Evils acted by him, (which have bin
judged capital in several of his predecessors from whom he claymes, yet) from
that alone which is before spoken of we may (without need of his late implicit
Confession) conclude that he has bin the Author and Continuer of a most unjust
war, and is consequently guilty of all the Treason it contaynes and of all
the innocent blood, rapine, spoil, and mischief to the Kingdom acted or
occasioned thereby; and if so, how far the Public justice of the Kingdom can
be satisfied, the blood, rapine etc. avenged or expiated, and the wrath of God
for the same appeased without judgment executed against him, and consequently,
how far an Accommodation with him (implying a Restitution of him, when God has
given him so clearly into your power to do Justice) can be just before God,
or good men, without so much as a judicial Trial, or evident remorse,
appearing in him proportionable to the offense: We thus recommend to your
saddest and most serious consideration, who must one day be accomptable for
your Judgments here on earth, to that which is the highest and most just;
indeed both as to the justness and Public benefit of such an Accommodation,
we shall confess if there were good evidence of a proportionable remorse in
him, and that his coming in again, were with a new or changed heart (as to
these things he has formerly fought against, and from those he has contended
for) his offense being first judged according to Righteousness, his person
might be capable of pity, mercy and pardon, and an Accommodation with him,
with a full and free yielding on his part, to all the aforesaid parts of
Public and religious interest (in contest) might in charitable construction be
just (possibly) safe and beneficial; or if the heat of War (before God had so
clearly given his double judgment against him in the cause, or delivered him
into your hands for yours) and while affairs stood in some equal balance, you
then in love of peace (which it is good to seek with all men) and for saving of
further bloodshed and misery to the kingdom (which in that case you could not
otherwise avoid) had upon a full provision for the matters in question, and
good security for future against him, made a by Accommodation with him (as by
your many Addresses, you endeavored,) it might have been excuseable in point
of prudence, (though you had incurred a more remote future hazard, because
thereby you had avoided another more immediate and present; yea the hazard had
been less, because to what he had then agreed, all men would have accounted
him bound, being then unquestionably free,) and the point of Justice had not
then been so clearly required at your hands, because not yet altogether in your
power: But, as this whole latter Supposition is, by time and the good hand of
God toward you, excluded the case, so neither is there any colorrable ground
for the former, but evidence of the contrary: For, as to that only color of
any change of heart in him, with his implicit confession of a fault, in
yielding to your first Proposition does import; First, how slight and slender
that confession is, the tenor of the Proposition may show; And yet, had he
timely, freely and clearly confessed but so much, as from conviction, or remorse,
or from a sense of the hand of God against him, or had left us but a ground of
charity to believe it so, we should have thought our selves bound to regard it
with proportionable tenderness toward him; or at least, should have thought
it not ingenious nor Christian to take advantage, from such confession, the
more to prosecute him for it; but having so long and obstinately, both in word
and practice, till now, denied it; and never confessed it, until all his other
ways of force, policy, or fraud (whereby he has attempted to justify
himself) had failed him, and no other shift left, but by this forced (yet
seeming yiedling) acknowledgement to save himself, and delude the people,
(until he can find or work out some new advantage) and confessing it now but
conditionally, viz. so as you agree with and satisfy him in other things
(which kind of confession, where the matte in question is concerning true or
false, just or unjust, and extending to innocence or horrid sin, does seem
to imply such Hypocrrisie as (we think) was never yet so proclaimed before God
and the world) and when, at the same time, while thus in words he confesses
it, yet in practice he denies it still, by his continuing, and not recalling
his Commissions to the Prince, and other English Rebels, and Revolters; yea to
Ormond and his associated Irish Rebels also (all which are so contrary to that
verbal Confession) and by his trying all Interest still, to make a party,
against it; in this case, it were stupidity (rather then Charity) nay indeed
(we think) a wrong to his intentions, to understand that confession as from
inward remorse or conviction; so that (as the case stands) it goes only so
far, as may serve for further ground of condemnation against him, but not at
all of satisfaction from him.

And admitting no such change or conviction (even when there are verbal
confessions and concessions carrying a semblance thereof) but that his
restitution would be with the same principles and affections, both as to civil
and Religious interest, from which he has acted the past evils; and after
some former like acknowledgements and agreement, has returned to the same by
ass upon his next advantages; then, besides the unrighteousness of the
Accommodation, and readmission (which is before already cleared) and besides
matter of danger, (which we shall show in it is place) we desire all good men to
consider: As to the other point of good, ( viz. the public benefit (what
fruits can be hoped from such a Reunion or renewed communion betwixt those
contraries, God has once so separated, viz. of principles or affections of
liberty, with Principles of Tyranny, Principles of public Interest, with
Principles of Prerogative and particular interest; principles of zeal, and the
power of godliness, with principles of formality and superstition in Religion
(we might say indeed, of light with darkness, of good with evil) as would be
employed in his restitution to be, (as it were your Head) your King again, and
to have that high trust and influence in relation to our Peace, Rights, and
Liberties (civil and religious) with the same Principles and affections, from
which he has so much and so long opposed them? For, if his Kingly Office be
not of use or trust in relation to them, what needs his restitution? if it be,
then this doubt holds just.

Next, to the other part of the preceding Question, ( viz. Concerning the
safety of an Agreement, for his restitution, especially supposing no real
remorse, or change, but the same principles and affections) although in the
terms of the Accommodation and Restitution, you had a more ample concession of
the public interest in question, then you are like to have when he has
granted all you have demanded, and as full security for future observance of
the agreement as words or Letters, (yea Oaths) can give; and though we might
suppose him as true and just in the observance of such an agreement as other
Kings or Princes (once given up unto, and engaged upon such principles and
ways of tyranny, or selfe-interest) use to be; yet first in general we might
make a just appeal to the experience of Ages and Nations, what danger there is
in any such Accommodations, both to the public interest in contest, and to
the persons or parties that have engaged for it, and we might challenge all
Story for one instance in the like case, viz. where any such King claiming and
assuming such Powers and Prerogatives over a people beyond his bounds, and
(upon opposition from the people the rein) flying to force, and in a war upon
them, endeavoring to gain the same by conquest, but instead thereof losing
both what he so claimed, and all he had before in a full conquest, on their
parts, over him (we say in such case) we would feign see an instance where ever
(after so long a war, so much blood spilt, and such spoil made) the people
having at last wholly subdued him, and gained their own Cause in that way of
force and conquest, to which he had so appealed, and having him and his party
captivated, and in their power, did either willingly subject all to question
again in a Treaty with him of their own tendering, or by it seek both that
public interest, (or rather but a slender portion of that which God had so
wholly and freely by his righteous judgment given unto them) and even their
own safety and Indemp nitie therewith, to be had (all) as Concessions from
that their enemies hand, and (balking him as a person not punishable or
acconntable for whatever evil he had endeavored or done) to restore him upon
such Concessions to his Throne again: we say, we would gladly have a parallel
instance, where ever indeed any people before this were in the like case given
up to such a preposterous and selfe-deserting way, or an instance of (almost)
any Accommodation of like kind at all, with a readmission of such a person to
the same Office, State, and Revenue, (with the least shadow of the same power)
or to the least footing therein, upon the same account or claim of right, (on
the foundation whereof, he had before assumed such powers) wherever such
accommodations proved safe either to the public interest in contest, or to the
persons engaged therein, or did not prove ruinous to the one and the other, or
at least end, in the irruptions of new and more bloody and bitter contests
about the same things either in the same or succeeding age, and those with more
hazard and disadvantage to the public interest and party adhering thereto,
then the former; or where indeed any people contending and once engaging in
war against a Tyrant for their Liberties, did ever fully redeem and hold the
same with a readmission of him, or without (first or last) disclaiming and
renouncing all dependence on him, or accord with him for the same, and an utter
rejection, expulsion, and deposure, either of his whole race, and all that
claimed upon the same account of right, or at least, of his particular person,
and execution of justice upon him, if he fell within their power: With this
latter way of proceeding we have heard many instances of people, fully
recovering their Liberties, and happily retaining the same; but without it, or
in the former way of accommodation and restitution, we have not heard, or read
of any so succeeding; there is abundant experience to reach us how ordinary
(yea, we may say constant) a thing it has been for Kings and Princes in such
cases, when they could not prevail in the way of force, to leave that, and
apply themselves by fraud to accomplish their ends and wills upon the people;
and when in such contests with them by the Sword they have been brought into
straights, then to cry up peace, and under that glorious golden bait, which
the people wearied with war, and the troublesome and chargeable concomitants
thereof, are most apt to catch at, having drawn them into ways of
accommodation, to make some fained yielding up of those Prerogatives and
advantages, they find, they cannot hold, and by large promises, Concessions,
and assurances on any terms, to make agreements with them, whereby to quiet
the people, and get themselves into the Throne again; and yet afterward, upon
on their next advantage, to break, and make void all again, and prosecute
such advantages to the overthrow both of the public interest, and those that
had engaged for it, without regard of Faith or Oath, (further then necessity
has held them thereto) where any advantage for the accomplishing of their ends
has lead them to a breach; how apt first such Princes are to this, and next
how easy it is for them, when they find advantages, to find occasions also,
and pick quarrels to make a breach, even with a colorable saving to their
faith and honor, engaged in such agreements; and lastly, how easy also, after
they are so got into the saddle again, and the people by their fair
Concessions, Promises and Engagements, lulled into a security, to find or work
out such advantages to themselves, and prosecute them to greater prejudice both
of the public and the particular persons engaged for it, then before such
contests begun, or without such accord thereupon, they could have done, as
experiences do abound, so there wants not reason enough to teach us.

For the first: Where a Prince is once given up to that self-interest of his
Will and Power, so as to make it his highest end, or (at least) to prefer it
above the public Interest, and welfare; yea above the safety and peace of his
People (as where he makes War against them for it, it is apparent he does,)
and to prefer it above Religion too, (as is evident, when he attempts the
moulding and forming of Religion to subserve that end,) such a person sure
cannot want any principles of falsehood, cruelty, or revenge suitable to such an
end; neither in reason is it like, that he will regard any Engagements of
Faith, or Oath; or stop, or boggle at any thing of that kind, further then
necessity does hold him thereto, or where a necessity or advantage, for the
accomplishing of that his highest end, does lead to a breach: And indeed, when
the bonds once accepted by him with unquestionable freedom (at his admission
to the Throne) the bonds of Law, yea the fundamental bonds of trust betwixt
him, and his People, the very Covenant of peace, yea the Oath of God betwixt
them would not hold him, but of his own mind (without occasion before given)
have been all violated by him; and (to justify himself, and protect his
Instruments in that) the law of Force (admitting no bounds but power) has been
chosen and set up by him, and prosecuted to the utmost in a long and bloody
War; how can it be expected, that the bonds of new Concessions and Agreements
(with what ever assurances that are but verbal, or literal) being imposed by
force upon him, or yielded to from nothing but an invincible or powerful
necessity, can be of more awe or regard with him, or power to hold him, when an
advantage to gain what he sought, or recover what he lost, does offer it self?
And as for revenge, how natural it is for a Prince, so given up to that
self-interest of will and power, and how necessary to his interest to seek and
prosecute revenge against all eminent opposers, and much more the oppugners
thereof; we wish your own reason, and the experience of others may rather warn
you, then that you should put it to trial in your own cases.

And has your and our experience of this King with whom we have to do, given
cause to hope better things from him, in these respects, then other Ages or
Nations ever found from other Priuces in the like case? First, for point of
Faith-keeping (besides his first numerous breaches of his original Faith to
his Kingdoms in the whole manage of his government and trust, before the
Wars,) witness his Accords with the Scottish Nation, and how he kept them;
his seeming compliances in part with this Parliament (in the time of his
straights) and feigned acknowledgments of past errors, with promises of
redress, and future amendment, until your bounty, in paying off the Scots and
English Armies at that time, had delivered him from those straights; and then,
so soon as you came to those particulars which should have effectuated that
redress, and assured future remedy, by tying his hands, and deterring others
from the like exorbitances, immediately flying out again to higher and greater;
and (first by policy, then by force) going about to overthrow those
foundations of remedy which he had granted, in the ascertaining of this
Parlinment, etc. And let those many particulars of hypocrisy, dissimulation
and treachery, couched under his fairest Overtures, Professions and
Protestations, which your selves in several Declarations have observed and
recorded, bespeak what cause there is, to confide in his promises or
Engagements. As to his innocence in point of revenge, witness those petty
revenges, after several Parliaments (and yet some of them extending to death
through hardship of imprisonment) which were sought and taken against such
Patriots as had, in them, appeared but to assert the common Liberties against
his Interest: Witness his attempts of higher in the proceedings against the
Members he impeacht; and let the several Designations of some to the
slaughter, some to exile, others to prisons, all to misery of one sort or
other, which, upon any hopes of prevailing in the former or later War, have
been made against his eminent opposers amongst you, suffice to teach you and
your adherents, what mercies might be expected from him and his Party, if he
ever had, or yet shall gain the advantage over you.

Next, for the facility of a Princes finding occasion and quarrel after such
an agreement, to make a breach, when he finds his advantage; and yet, with some
colorable saving to his Honor: We know, in all mutual Agreements (where each
party grants and takes, and something is to be made good on each party toward
the other) how easy it is to find, or pretend a failer of full performance,
and thence to avoid the obligation to the Agreement; and especially, in
Agreements of State, if all matters of power, trust and right are not fully
cleared and determined so as to state the supreme trust, and conclusive
Judgment to all intents and purposes fully and absolutely in one party or
other, but that something be left divided, or at least suspended betwixt them,
in such case how easy is it for the party that is looser by the agreement to
find or feign an intrenchment of the other beyond the stated bounds, and thence
to make a new breach when be sees his advantage for it? But however when any
thing within the compass of what was so left suspended does in practice, come
to question, and difference, and neither party trusted singly to conclude,
there is a clear Foundation for a breach, unless they either agree to lay the
matter aside, (which perhaps the gaining party cannot, and so (by the loosers
mere standing off) may be necessitated to appear the first Actor in a breach,)
or else come to a new Agreement upon every such particular: We know besides,
what Court Maxims there are amongst the Kings party concerning some
fundamental Rights of a Crown, which the King cannot give away; and their
common scruple, whether a King, granting away such or any other hereditary
Crown-Rights, can oblige his Heirs or Successors, or exclude their claim; But
if all other pretexts fail, their Non-obligation to what is wrested from them
by force, in a powerful Rebellion (as they count it) will serve such a Kings
Conscience for a shift, to make a breach, where he finds his advantage. And
are not all these occasions or pretexts obvious in our case? To say nothing of
the matters of Supreme Power and trust which (though all your Propositions be
granted, will yet be left divided or suspended, not only betwixt the several
Houses, but betwixt them both and the Kings; nor yet of the imperfect
bargaining for several parts of it (which by the tenor of the Propositions are
taken some, (as it were,) by Lease, all by grant from the King, so as to
confirm rather then weaken his claim of the Original right to be in him and
his,) from both which kinds of defect or uncertainty in the Agreement there
will be left many apt occasions and particular grounds for a breach when time
shall serve; Is it not apparent, that from that more general consideration of
the condition of the King in this Treaty, and the force or necessity lying upon
him, a ground of evasion or exception lies to the whole agreement as not
obliging to the King, whatever Concessions or assurances are so drawn from him?
what account the King and his party do upon that ground make of the Treaty,
besides the common voice of them all in all corners, that the King (good man)
is merely forced to what he grants, we may see it publicly and authentickly
avowed by the Prince and his Council, in his Declaration in answer to the
Earl of Warwicks Summons of the revolted Fleet at Goree, where (besides other
passages hinting the same thing) the Prince clarely says: [The KING in truth
is still in prison, with such circumstances of restraint, as (to say no more)
are not usual in the case of the most private person, and whose delivery and
freedom therefrom all his Subjectes are obliged to endeavor, by the Laws of
God and man, to their utmost hazard, and afterward invites the Earl of Warwick
to join with his Highness in the rescue of his Royal Father from his unworthy
imprisonment. This, being in answer to that summons, wherein the Earl of
Warwick invited the Ships to come in upon that very ground, (that the King and
Parliament were in Treaty for Peace) we can take to intend no less then a
plain dissavouer of this Treaty, and disclaymer of whatever shall be concluded
thereupon, and (coming from the Prince and his Council) consider him as heir
apparent, it serves at least to acquit himself and posterity, from being
concluded by what his Father in such case shall consent unto, to the prejudice
of the Crown; and (consider him as having by his unlimited Commission, as
Generalissimo, the highest power of the Kingdom, which the King could devise
to give, and so he and his Council, while the King is in durance, being the
next visible head of the Kings party, and having the highest trust in relation
to the interest of the King, his Crown, and party) it is also (on the Kings
and their behalf) the most Authentic Declaration of their sense of the
Treaty, which could well be expected in the case (while the King and his
Council here being supposed under force as to all things else cannot be
supposed free in that point to declare his real Judgment) and so it may serve
in behalf of the King, his Heirs, and whole party, as a Protestation against
any conclusion by this Treaty, or what ever shall therein be drawn from him to
his own, or their prejudice. And indeed the King himself in diverse of his
Papers, that have come from him to you in relation to this Treaty, ha^s (in
such loft Language as might befit the condition of your prisoner) insinuated
the same sense of the Treaty, and his condition there'n and of the validity or
repute of any conclusions thereupon, while his condition should remain the
same, and not more free; And these several Declarations and insinuations
hereof being sent, those from the King immediately to your selves, that from
the Prince, (his General) to your Admiral, and from him to your own hand and
both being sent you during the Treaty before any conclusion upon it, will
remain upon record before you perpetual witnesses against the validity
thereof, or any obligingness a to rhema. Nor is it his or their sense alone,
or without grounds to gain belief, but (considering he is but so small a step
removed from the Castle, where he was your absolute prisoner, and still
confined within the Town or Island, (which is your Garrison) and so remaining
under the power of your Guards, and even in that condition being but upon his
Paroll) we doubt the same sense and judgment thereupon will be aptly made and
received both by intelligent spectators of this and neighbor Nations, and by
ages to come, and that the degree of enlargement you have afforded him (with
the pettit State added) will be understood but as a Mock-liberty, and
counterfeit of State, intended only to set him up in some colorable Posture
and equipage to be the more handsomely Treated with, but not as a setting him
free from your force or leaving him free in what he grants, so as to render it
obliging when granted; But though, as to the realitie of the case, there might
be freedom enough to make his concessions in honesty obliging, or his
absolution therefrom (at least) disputable, yet he and the Prince in his
behalf having (as is before expressed) in the b^st way they could, declared to
you before hand, that their sense to the contrary, as to his on their part (his
condition in the Treaty standing as it was,) if you after such fair and timely
warning would needs yet proceed in Treaty, without alteration of his condition
or the terms of it, and come to conclusions therein to bind up your selves
who will not say he and his party had reason so far to comply with your
proceeding upon it, and yet account that as to any obliging on their part
(whether he were really under dures or not, yet) their timely precaution to you
concerning their contrary sense of it, was a sufficient acquittall of them, not
only from being bound by any agreement upon it, but from any imputation of
deceitful dealing with you, (though they observe not what shall be so agreed
upon) since (after such precaution from them) it was your own fault, and at
your own peril, if you would proceed with them upon so rotten a foundation,
so as if you be cozened you cozen your selves and cannot blame them, or any
body else for it.

And truly this consideration as (when we first took notice of those passages
in that Declaration from the Prince and the Kings Papers) it did more awaken us
to consider your hazards in this Treaty then before, so it serves most clearly
to set forth the miserable straights and snare you are thereby entangled in; to
look no further into particulars, that great and dangerous evil, of old so
much declined and abhorred by you and our Brethren of Scotland, and more lately
so much strugled against by your selves in the previous debates concerning this
Treaty, ( viz. the Kings return to London and to his Parliament and Throne
again, without satisfaction and security before given,) is thus, at last like
to come upon you, and that upon worse terms (if you proceed in this Treaty to
conclude your selves and re-admit him) then if you had let him come without any
foregoing agreement at all, for had you let him come so, (both your selves, and
he being free) if then he had granted any thing of satisfaction or security,
all men would have accounted him bound by it, and the concession valid, or if
he had denied you necessary things in that kind, your further proceeding in
other ways to secure your selves and the Kingdom against him, would have
been thought more necessary, just and clear, and though (being at liberty) he
had personally headed his party in the City, and elsewhere with greater
advantages then ever, to assert once more his old quarrel in a new War, yet
you had known the worst ont ( viz, To fight it over again, but so much the
sooner,) but in the way you are now engaged in, the King has the advantage to
yield to any thing at last which he cannot get you to abate, and yet when
(having granted all) he gets (upon your own terms, (to his beloved Sear and
Throne again; behold he is free, (as if he had granted nothing) to take the
best advantage against you when he sees his time, and mean while may rest
secure in a good condition and wait his advantage, having got your hands
bound, till he finding it, shall stricke the first stroke again, which (it is
like) he will make a sure one (if he can) to disable you from a return, and so
we proceed to the next consideration, Viz. how easy it is for a Prince, after
such accommodation (admitting him either not bound, or not conscientious of his
bonds, or having occasions or pretexts for a breach) to find or work out
advantages, whereby to overthrow all he has granted to the public interests,
and (in the ruin of those that engaged against him for it,) to set up his own
above all, which for brevity we shall not so much consider generally in the
common advantages which Princes in such case usually have, as particularly in
those which this King clearly has or is like to have in this of yours.

The King comes in with the reputation (among the People) of having long
graciously sought Peace (although indeed ever since he found you in condition
to oppose his Force, It was his interest, and his best play, and especially
since you had beaten his Force, it was his necessary and only play) he comes
with the reputation of having long sought it by a Personal Treaty (which at
last has proved as he Prophesied, the only effectual means) and so you having
so long denied that, and only plied him with peremptory Propositions, and yet
at last granting it, are (in that self Condemnation) rendered by his Friends as
having deceitfully, or unnecessarily continued Burdens, and refused Peace so
long, in refusing that the Kings way, in which you might as well have had it
sooner as now (although the truth is, neither the Treaty, nor the Personality
of it have advanced the business one jot, since the King grants now the same
things, and in the same terms which he has so often in particular denied, yea
protested and sworn he would not, and the alteration is far enough from
Conviction by Treaty (as is before demonstrated) and visibly from a greater
necessity or advantage found now to induce the yielding then formerly. He comes
also, with the reputation of having granted for Peace sake all that you (as
unwilling to Peace) have rigidly stood upon (although when it is summed up
'twill appear very little of advantage, or security to Public interest, and
(by a trick or reserve that he has) nothing at all as before is showed, yet
however) with the People he carries these and the like points of Reputation
before him, and wants not Trumpets every where to blaze them sufficiently to
his renown, and your reproach, and (under such Banners of Love and Honor) He
comes in, The only true Father of his People (you being proved their cruel
Foster-fathers) he the Repairer of their breaches, (which you had made) the
restorer of their beloved Peace, ease, and freedoms, (which you, as his
Creatures render it, had ravished or cheated them of thus long) the Restorer of
their Trade and plenty too (which you had thus long obstructed) He a Conqueror
in sufferings and patience, a denyer of himself for the good of his People,
and what not that is glorious and endearing? And thus would the People be lulled
(and indeed cheated) into a security, as to any further apprehensions of evil
from him; yea posseit with acknowledgements and expectations of all their good
from him, and their jealousies awakened against you and your adherents only.
And yet (to heighten the same more into perfect hatred) you (as wise, yea as
honest men for their safety and interest, though they see it not) must continue
an Army and Garrisons still (and that) not the less, but much more for his
coming in again, then if you had taken another course utterly to shut him out
(as we shall show anon) and so you will be necessitated, notwithstanding the
Accommodation, to continue Taxes and Impositions for the maintenance of that
Force, to the burden and grievance of the People, and the greater increase of
their discontents and hate toward you; For if after this accommodation to ease
and satisfy them, you shall ever disband your Forces (while the King at's
liberty, and in's Throne again) you give him his end or wished opportunity, in
laying your selves, your adherents, and the Public interest all level again
with Him and His (as if you had never prevailed, nor had any advantage over
them) and so for all your satisfaction and security you are at the Kings
courtesy still, and (if he will break) you are but where you were at first,
and the Public interest nothing advantaged or secured, by ought obtained or
done in the War; but the King in the same, and much fairer possibility to
revive the old Quarrel, renew his Force with greater advantage, and put you to
Fight it over again, or rather may carry it without Fighting, since (after so
much blood and cost, and trouble for nothing) it is not like you will find a
competent Party, for the opposing of him ready to engage again on the same
terms, and if he gain any strength to appear for him (which who can doubt
when your Forces are disbanded, confidering what a numerous Party he has
engaged to it in interest and necessity, others inclined to it by principles
and temper, others in humor and discontent against the present Government) the
generality of people wearied with the former War (whereof they have found so
great misery, and so little fruit) if they see a strength on his part
threatening a new War, and none ready on your part to balance it, (which
might hold them (at least) in neutrality) will surely be more apt to join
unanimously with him, or let him have what he will that there may be no War,
then join with you to maintain another War (to so much prejudice, and so
little purpose as they have found the former.) And if to appease the King, and
his enraged Party, a sacrifice of those that opposed him in the former, will
serve the turn, the people ('it is like) will be so far from sticking at that,
as it is some Question to whom 'twould be more acceptable (the King or them?)
the people by the Cavaliers clamourous and cunning suggestions, and the
advantages you have given thereto (through the unsettled, endless, and
fruitless ways of trouble you have held them in) being already pretty well
possessed, and by that time like to be further persuaded against you, as if in
all this War you had merely cozened them; so as you are like to have their
hate no less (as for abusing them) then the Kings for opposing him.

If to secure that little advantage to public interest (which in the present
way you will have gained) or rather to prevent a total loss of all thereupon,
you continue a sufficient strength, and therewith Taxes and Impositions to
maintain it; those, as they are always grievous to the people, so they will
(after the peace supposed to be settled) be so much the more discontenting by
how much they may be then deemed unnecessary; for the King, having in the
terms of Accommodation, granted what your selves did ask, and therein such
supposed security, as that you need not fear new troubles (though few will
consider wherein that little security does lie) or at least (by his yielding as
it were for peace sake, to all your demands) having given (in the peoples
apprehensions) such assurances of his love to peace, as that no danger of new
war or trouble seems to be feared from him; in this case the continuance of
Forces and Taxes will surely be thought no further needful for any public
end (for, in common judgment, if War made Soldiers needful, then surely
Peace must render them needless.) And therefore it will be aptly thought (if
yet Soldiers be kept up, and Taxes continued) it is sure either for the gain,
or advantage, or some private design of those that continue them, And upon
these grounds (with unwillingnesse and backward nesse to pay Taxes, and
discontents at the burden of them) there must naturally grow up jealousies and
heart-burnings against those that require them. These to foment and inflame to
the height, and thereby to sweeten and endeare the King with the people, will
be his and the Cavaliers surest play, and otherwise to sit that while (if they
have the patience) as still as Lambs. How colorable and plausible will it be,
for them to suggest, and how apt for the people to receive, That the King is no
way to be blamed for any of those burdens, he (Good man) has yielded to any
thing, and done what he could, that there might be no need of them, and now he
gives no consent to them, but the Parliament does them without him, and have
bound up and excluded him from his wonted Negative Voice therein, otherwise he
would refuse and hinder them; but being not in power to help the People, he
can only pity them in these things; And now they may see what they gain by
their Parliaments, or how much it is to their common prejudice (as well as the
Kings,) to have the King in any particular ex^^^ded from his Negative Voice,
and the Parliament free to proceed in ought without him. And thus easily may
the people (from their common unwillingnesse to part with Money (though for
their real safety) be at once inflamed into a refusal and opposition therein,
and deluded into a resentment of that which is the Kings interest, as if it
were their own, and so engaged with and for him and his Party; as having one
common Cause with themselves. And if thus they be once heightened but into a
resolved witholding of payments for the maintenance of that necessary strength
you keep, for the common safety and peace, you must then either give the King
his End and advantage, (as is before expressed) in dissolving your Forces, or
else use extraordinary ways of power and rigor toward the People, to enforce
such necessary payments, which will still inrage them higher against you, and
serve to endeare and engage them more to the King and his interest (colourably)
in point of their Liberties then, as well as their ease before; until at last
the People (for both) being raised against you, and therein joining with, and
being headed by the King and his Party (whose interest so far seems one with
theirs) you (unless you will give up all) must come to make a War against the
poor deceived people for that which is really their own cause: And the King
by the People (as it were for their proper Liberties and Interest) may make
War against you, to th'erecting of his own, and th'overthrow of the common
Interest, both yours and theirs. For solution of which seeming Riddle, much
needs not to be said, since that you contend for is, their general,
Fundamental, and perpetual Liberties, for the preservation whereof you will be
forced to press upon them in particular matters, against their present ease
and Freedoms; and the People being ordinarily more affected with the latter
(as more immediate and sensible) and less with the former (which are more
remote and only intelligible,) The King closing with them under pretense of
the latter, (which they can feel) may easily engage them, to the prejudice of
the former, (which they hardly discern.)

By what we have here said, it may (by the way) appear how much it is for the
Kings interest and advantage (since he cannot carry all by force or war) to
make a Peace on any terms, though in words never so much to the diminution of
His Power, if thereby He can but secure Himself, and get into His Seat again;
and consequently we may the better guess, how far Conversion or Conviction has
place in His present yielding to things He has so often said and sworn He
never would; and in His granting now, at the motion of His English Parliament,
what He has so often denied at the pressing instance of both Kingdoms: For,
having sufficient proof of your present Forces, that they will neither be drawn
to serve His turn themselves, nor easily suffer others that would; and having
found in the last Summers Design, that it would not perfectly take with the
Body of the People, to cry down your Army (though with decrying of Taxes to
boot) while no seeming Peace was settled (no, though with the Cry for their
Disbanding, they cried up Peace and a Treaty in order to it) He therefore now
sees He must clap up a Peace on what terms soever, and (that done) His way is
clear: The Parliament then may easily and soon be put to it, to denude
themselves of their Strength in a Disbanding, and so set Him even with
themselves again, or else (if they refuse) the People may be wrought to undo
all for Him (whatever He has granted) without His appearing for His own
Interest to make any breach. And as upon this single ground many Nations before
us (by like Accommodations with their beaten Tyrants) have from the fairest
attempts and hopes of Liberty, fallen to an utter loss of it, yea to an absolute
Bondage, and been made the Instruments thereof themselves: So by this one
consideration (though there were no more) it may appear, how easy it is for
any Prince, and particularly for ours (after such an Accommodation made, and
Himself restored) to find, or work out advantages, whereby to overthrow what
He has granted, raise His own Interest higher, and depress the Public lower
then ever before: And yet we have touched but one of those many advantages
that, in such case, lie clear before Him. We might reflect upon that of His
numerous party engaged by Interest, Necessity, and otherwise, to serve Him so
long as He remains in possibility to Head them; toward whom proceedings have
been such, as have served to imbitter and inrage them unto, and yet not to
disable or discourage them from further Attempts against you, and toward whom
(by His continuing King) you will be the more necessitated to proceed still
upon the same strain in both Respects. We might mention also their great
Families and relations, and their Interest of Influences within the Kingdom,
and we might enlarge upon the consideration of the two other Kingdoms He has
to work by, from which we have found such powerful parties ready to serve His
Interest, the one to make Prize and Advantage of this Kingdom, the other (at
least) to deliver themselves from your Yoke, by helping to put His upon your
and our Necks; All which, if they were to be feared, when He has been in no
capacity to Head them (as in the last Summers War) then much more when He shall
be; and though they be much to be feared in relation to His heading of them,
while He, by His supposed impunity (what ever He does) has encouragement to
make all possible Trial of them, and they hopes, That if ever He prevail, He
may make them amends, or procure their impunity at last; yet (that being once
confuted by an Example of Justice upon Him for such Attempts) they would not
then be (in Divine considerations) at all, or (in Prudential considerations)
not so much to be feared, in relation to His Posterities heading of them.
Besides these, we cannot but consider much more the vast possibilities, after
His Restitution, to make Parties, Factions and Divisions amongst your selves,
and your now Adherents, and to set one against another, to make one betray
another, by one to ruin another, and (by making use of all Interests) to set
up His own above all. Have not you found Him at this play all along? And do not
all men acknowledge Him most exquisite at it? If He have had the faculty to
avail much in this kind when at distane from you, will He not much more when
so near you, amongst you in your Bosoms and Councels?

For Divisions (we speak it with depth of sadness) He needs not come to make
any amongst you, but to use them; they abound woefully already: And for His
Opportunities of Advantage by them, they are great, beyond conception.

First, From the Jealousies which each party is apt to have of the others
strengthening themselves, to the prejudice of the other by Conjunction with Him
and His, and which He and His Creatures have a faculty to feed in each of them,
Its more then probable, That each party will be apt to strive, which shall most
and first comply with Him: Have not you and we seen sad Experiences of this
already? Give us leave to be the more affectionately sensible of this, as
having had some Experience of Temptations toward it amongst our selves (we
say) Temptations toward it from the King and His party, as strong and substile
as are imaginable, though (we bless God, by whom) we were preserved in our
Integrity, and not given up to, but delivered from such wretched Apostasy. And
we can truly say, That although through the Example of others partly
necessitating us for the present prevention of that mischief to the Public
they were running into in that kind, as we apprehended) we were drawn into
some Negative Compliances, tending to Moderation (which we thought to be, and
in its place is a real good;) yet first, we never sought, but were sought unto,
and notwithstanding all Overtures and Temptations, we did abhor the thought of,
and still profestly refused any thing of Conjunction with Him or His, in
relation to the Affairs of that time, or ought of private Contract or Trust
with them.

Secondly, What we declared of Moderation was but Hypothetical, with careful
Caution, and saving for the public Interest (according to our then
understanding of it.) And

Thirdly, We aimed not at the strengthening of our selves thereby, to the ruin
of any persons or party opposed (nor did drive at any such end) but merely to
prevent any such from strengthening themselves in that kind (as we feared) to
the prejudice of the Public, as may appear by the tenor of the Cities
Engagement, with the Concomitants and Consequents thereof, and by our carriage
both in relation thereto, and since that Danger was over: And yet however in
that degree of Compliance admitted in that kind, we find matter of
Acknowledgement before the Lord, concerning our Error, Frailty, Unbelief, and
Carnal Councels therein, and we bless him that preserved us from worse: But, on
the other side, give us leave to fear (and we heartily wish (as to any honest
soul) That it may be a caufless and mistaken fear) That from such private
Jealousies, and the Animosities or Hate of one party against another (who once
seemed to be engaged in one Common Cause against a Common Enemy) there have
been on the part of others evil Compliances, Negative and Positive, yea (we
doubt) Contracts and Conjunctions too, by some sought, by others entertained
with Him and His party (even while the acknowledged Enemy) to the neglect or
dispending of the common public Interest, merely for the upholding or
strengthening of their own, and the ruin of the party particularly opposed.

We cannot but be sensible of this, because we have felt the effects of it in
the loss of many our dear innocent Friends lives, with the hazard of our own in
the last Summers War: For even from this Root (as we have more then conjectural
Grounds to understand) The Revolt in Wales had its Rise and Growth, The Scottish
Invasion had its Foundation and Invitation, The Revolt of the Ships, The
Rebellion in Kent, Essex, etc. and the several Tumults, Risings and
Disturbances in and about London and the Southern parts had their Instigation
and Encouragement; and from the same this miserable ensnaring Treaty, its
conception and birth: And if from the divisions we have, such destructive
compliances and conjunctions have been entertained with, and such advantages
given to Him and His party, while professed and acknowledged Enemies, what worse
may we not expect of that kind, when by a Peace made, they shall have the
Reputation of friends, to give countenance and confidence thereunto?

To conclude this point (concerning His advantages after accommodation and
restitution, to overthrow or prejudice the public Interest) we will confess our
greatest fears, from the consideration of the Act for this Parliaments
unlimitted continuance, wherein (besides divisions amongst those that are, or
profess to be for the public) if He shall ever be able by particular
successions of new Burgesses, according to the present constitution, or any
other way, to form a prevailing or ballancing party for His Interest in the
House of Commons (which even there He seems to have bid fair for already, and
as to the Lords, we will move no Question) we may then justly yield Englands
Liberties for defunct, when that which should be the Conservative, shall be
turned indeed the Bane, and yet (it being in the place and repute of the only
Conservative) we shall (through that Act) be debarred from change of Medicine,
or use of other Remedy, yea, from the renewing or taking fresh choice of
Medicine in the same kind, but must keep to that old Mass, which such
putrefaction will have rendered deadly, and will probably vitiate all particular
Additions of fresh ingredients that shall be made, while the old leven shall
remain predominant. Neither can we see any possible help in the Case after his
Restitution, though you should be willing to lay down your power: For indeed,
to set a Period to this Parliament, and not therewith provide for a certain
succession of Parliaments, and the certainty of their sitting also (without
dependence on the Kings will) were to leave the Kingdom without assurance of
any remedy, or (at least) of power therein to help at all, and so in like
condition as before this Parliament: And to make provision for such a
succession, and certainty of sitting of future Parliaments, without like
provision for a more due constitution, by more equal Elections (freed from such
dependence on prerogative Grants, or from being so subject to prerogative
Commands, as now by the number and nature of Burgessships they stand) were to
render the succession less hopeful or safe, or (at least) subject to no less
corruption in the same kind, then the Constitution of the present is; And you
having not in this Treaty propounded any provision for any of these things
(which we dare boldly affirm, are of highest concernment to the vindication and
preservation of public Interest in the very Fundamentals of it) if you go on
to make a Peace upon such terms, as if this Parliament were to continue for
ever, and set the rest of all our hopes upon that Basis: We may justly presume,
That when a Peace is made, and the King testored, if afterward you would come
to considerations of laying down your Power, and making such provisions for
succession, as is before expressed, The King (whose consent you still seem to
make necessary to such things (though it is like He would readily consent to be
rid of this Parliament, so as to have no more but at his Call for their
meeting, and Will for their continuance; or perhaps so, as to have no better
provision for the one, or larger for the other, then the Triennial Bill, yet,
as to full certainty in the one, or sufficient enlargement in the other
(without relation to His will) and much less as to the taking away of
Burgessships dependent on His grant, and subject to His, and His great men's
command, and the reducing of Elections to full equality and freedom (we say) on
such terms we may well presume (from the reason and nature of the Kings
Interest) He will not willingly (when after Peace made He needs not) give up
His hopes of or against this Parliament; but rather then He will make, or bring
upon Himself and Posterity such an Entail of Parliaments as He can never hope
to avoid, and those to be so independent on His Will for their meeting or
sitting (as he can never hope to avoid) and constituted so equally according to
the Interest of the people (as He can never hope, or cannot design how to pack
to His own) He will prefer and stand to His fairer hopes of making His party
good with this Parliament one way or other, viz. Either in and by it (by making
a party in it as before expressed) or else against it, by making use of
discontents and impatience in the people toward it, and of divisions within it
self, at last to destroy and overthrow it, and so to deliver His Crown once for
all, from Wardship (as he counts it) to Parliamentary power, which, by the other
Conditions might have been perpetual: And if either in the one kind or the
other He prevail upon this Parliament, His Monarchy and our Slavery will be
absolute, and (probably) for ever; in the one by seeming Authority of
Parliament (made immortally the same) in the other by th'utter extinction of it.

But to proceed from probabilities of danger, to show the certain insecurity
and perpetual prejudice to public Interest, that an Accommodation with Him,
and Restitution of Him in the present case does imply: Suppose the best
Constitutions and strictest Laws imaginable in any State, yet their
insufficiency and impotency, as to the preserving of public Interest, without
a power to punish those that violate it and them, or where persons in power to
prejudice the same (especially if insixt and lasting power) shall stand
privileged from being punishable what ever they do, is obvious to each
considering man (that power of punishment, and the having of it in the most
trusty hands, and no particular persons to be exempt from their Justice, being
that essential part of public Interest, which is the fence and guard of all
the rest in the depraved state of mankind) Now, in our present case, after so
many, so great and lasting violations thereto, committed by the King, and by
His procurement, and after His so long and obstinate maintenance thereof, and
persistence therein, and so many refusals of that poor satisfaction and
security you now desire, in so much as you once resolved against any more
Addresses (we say, after all this) for you, the Supreme Judicatory of the
Kingdom (when He is through the just hand of God in your power to do Justice
upon) yet still to decline that way, and in stead thereof, to seek again to Him
your Prisoner in the way of Treaty, to receive what satisfaction and security
you can get as Concessions from HIm: and thereupon (having only some few
instruments submitted to justice, and that by His Concession too) to readmit
Himself to the Throne with Safety, Freedom and Honor: What can this be
understood to speak less, then that (as Himself and His party for Him have
still expressly assumed, and as the pretense and ways of your proceedings
toward Him heretofore, have too much employed) He is indeed above any humane
Justice, and not accountable to, or not punishable by any power on earth, what
ever he does: And to, besides the bar to any present proceeding of Justice
against Himself (whose one example in that kind made, and not afterward made
ineffectual again, as others of that kind have been, by the flattery or
degeneration of succeeding ages, would be of more terror and avail, then the
execution of His whole party, yea, then all the satisfaction and security,
verbal or literal, that you can obtain or imagine without it) you would also
(by such exemption of HIm, and in such a case) proclaim the lke perpetual
exemption to Him and His Posterity, what ever they shall do, or in what ever
case (since none can be imagined more pregnant or ripe for justice then this
already is) and would therein give the most authentic Testimony and Seal that
ever was, to all these destructive Court Maxims concerning the absolute
impunity of Kings, their accountableness to none on earth, and that they cannot
err, do wrong, etc. which principles (in the sense to which they are applied)
as they were begot by the blasphemous arrogance of Tyrants upon servile
Parasites, and fostered only by slavish or ignorant people, and remain in our
Law Books, as Heir-looms only of the Conquest; so they serve for nothing but
to establish that which begot them (Tyranny) and to give Kings (who so far as
they claim otherwise then by Conquest, are but Ministers entrusted for
Righteousness and Peace) the highest Privilege, Encouragement and Invitation
to do wrong and make War, even upon their own people, as their corrupt wills or
lusts shall prompt them: If therefore our Kings claim by right of Conquest, God
has given you the same against him, and more righteous, by how much that on
their parts was extended to a forcible Dominion over the people (which
originally or naturally they had not) and our's but to a deliverance from that
Bondage, into that state of Right and Freedom which was naturally and morally
due to us before: If they claim from immediate Divine Designation, let them
show it; if from neither, but as by consent entrusted by and for the people,
let them then embrace and partake the conditions of such, and not as if the
whole people were made only for themm, and to serve their lusts, or had (if
not their being, yet) all their civil indowments by and from them. But to
return to our purpose, if you (by such Proceedings as you are about toward the
King in the present case, shall confirm and harden him and his posterity in
their assumed privileges of impunity, etc. (what ever is or shall be done by
them) what new agreement, or other Bond of man's framing, can you supose to hold
them, and especially himself that has broke the strong^st of that kind already
(and we appeal to your consciences upon the reasons before given, what inward
change you ^^^de to be trusted in,) but that he and they (upon the same
confidence of im^unity to themselves, what ever they do, or however they
succeed) will still be ready to take all advantages, and try all means (so
long as they can find any Instruments that will serve them) to set up their
own interest, to the prejudice of the Public, a heretofore, and especially to
avenge or vindicate themselves and it against the supposed wrong of enforced
Concessions?

And why shall we not think they will find Instruments still to venture for
them (notwithstanding your punishing of some in that kind) since while your
own proceedings admit themselves unpunishable? Such Instruments may hope that
(at the worst of success) they will save all, or most of them, as now; and
(themselves still surviving to renew the quarrel) it may well be hoped, that
if ever they prevail, the Instruments that shall survive, and heirs of the
rest will be repaired with honor to boot, so that the adventure of each
Instrument in that kind (being but as of one amongst a multitude, where the
most are sure to escape,) is of far less hazard then a Soldiers venture in
a field battle, and the hazard that is (especially to necessitous or
ambitious men,) is abundantly compenst by those hopes which the certain
impunitie (besides probable advantages) of their head does give: We are sure,
that, as to any Instruments venturing again for you and the ^ublique, the
hazzards infinitely greater, and in humane considerations, no encouragements
comparable to those, which (after ^ll year Proposition-justice against his
Instruments,) will yet, upon this ground, remain to them for any further
Engagements in behalf of their great and unpunishable Master. And therefore, as
in all cases of like rebellions, or civil wars, the prudence of most Nations
and ages (as well as the Justice of the thing,) has lead to fix the exemplary
punishment, first upon the capital Leader, and upon others, as nearest to him,
and not to punish the inferiors, and exempt the chief; so in this your case,
it is most clear, that to fix your Justice first upon the head, and thereby let
his successors see, what themselves may expect (if they attempt the like,) may
hopefully discourage them, from heading any more what Instruments they might
find in the like quarrel, and so is like to be a real security (when such
Instruments cannot find an head.) but to punish only Instruments, and let the
head (by whose power, and in whose in terest all has been done,) not only go
free, but stand in perpetual privilege and impunitie to head such instruments
again, as often as he can find opportunity, and get any to serve him, is a way
so far from security, as it leads indeed to endless trouble and hazard, or
the perfect loss of all. And besides, in point of Justice, with what
Conscience inferior Ministers can be punished, and the principal set free,
yea, restored to dignity and honor, for whose only interest, in whose only
quarrel, and by whose Commissions and Commands they have acted, (which they
might perhaps conceive to oblige, or at least to excuse them,) for our parts,
since we have seriously weighed it, we cannot understand; we are sure it
seems a most unequal and partial way of Justice, suitable to those aforesaid
corrupt or abused Court-Maximes, whereon alone it has been grounded, ( As that
the King can do no wrong, etc.) And indeed what ever grounds or reasons can be
imagined to exempt Kings from humane Justice, or to excuse them when they
wilfully give Commissions and commands unto their inferior Ministers to do
evil, (which we are sure can be no less then something of divinity, and
absolute independencie (as to men,) supposed to be in them,) The same
Principles (if admitted and fully weighed) would equally extend to absolve and
indempnifie those Ministers for what they do in pursuance of such commissions
and Commands, yea and bring those under condemnation too, that should forcibly
oppose him or them therein: We would at least feign hear one princile
sufficient for the one, which would not, by rational deduction, extend to both
the other. And if there be none such, then, we beseech you consider, whether
your readmission of the King in the present case and manner (without so much
as his subjecting to Judgment or Trial,) will not be so far from security,
as that it will not only enervate the best fence of public interest (the
power of punishing violators of it,) but in consequence shake the Foundations
of all you have done in the war, and overturne or invalid all you seem to
obtain in the peace.

Upon this, and the rest of the considerations aforegoing, we crave leave to
believe, that an accommodation with the King in the way and Terms you are
upon, or any at all, as the case now stands, that shall imply his restitution,
or shall not provide for his subjection to Trial and Judgment,

Would first, not be just before God, or man, nor hopefully good; but many
ways evil, and so not desirable by any honest heart that well considers it.

Secondly, would not be safe, but full of hazard and danger, yea, certain
prejudice, disadvantage, and destruction, both to the public interest in
Question, and to the persons that have engaged for it (except such as, by base
Apostasy from it, and treacherous services for the King against it, have or
shall have emerited their pardons.

And thirdly, If in another way or case it possibly could be safe, (which we
see not,) yet in the present Treaty, and condition the King's in, it cannot.

Now if any observe and object that the grounds aforegoing (upon which we
conclude thus,) would extend as well against any accommodation with him since
his Person came into the Parliaments power, or at least against any restitution
of him thereupon (without his first submitting to judgment, and a change of
heart and principles) and consequently would have served as well against that
accommodation with him, and restitution of him, which the Army seemed once to
plead for; we shall confess it, as to the maine, and we have only this to say;

1. That your whole pretense and way of proceeding toward him before, and at
that time, the state you have kept him in, your particular engagement to the
Kingdom of Scotland for another address to him, and your preparation toward
the same at that time, had wholly led us on in the supposition of an
Accommodation to be still endeavored with him, and to that supposition only,
our then Overtures to you were framed, and you had not then (as since) by your
votes of No farther Addresses, and your Reasons for them, cleared our
judgments from that former mist, and led us out to the thoughts of other ways
of security against him, nor had pointed toward the way (as thereupon you have
done) in taking off his state, and close imprisoning his Person.

And we confess that since our thoughts have been thus set free, and led out
that way (besides the good reasons you gave, and what they further discovered
or employed, and besides what other pens have enlarged thereupon) the more we
our selves have considered, the more and further it has pleased God to let us
see, beyond what we did before: So that your bare retracting of Votes, or
changing your course (without better, or any reasons giving) cannot put out the
light which your former Votes with reasons have let in, and God has given his
seal and increase unto.

2. Your then Counsels and (with them) our thoughts, being so fixed upon that
way of Addresses to him, we thought in lawful for us to tender to your
Consideration some things to be provided for therein, which were of highest and
most fundamental concernment to the public interest, and not thought or not
touched on in your former Addresses or then-preparations (as concerning the
Succession, Constitution, and clearing the power of Parliaments in future,
etc.) which accordingly we propounded to be taken in with most of your former
Propositions, and what ever we expressed exclusively (as our private opinions
at that time) yet our whole Overtures being but as Proposals to you, and not
immediately to the KING; It was far from our Intentions (as it was apparently
from our practice) to pre-judge or pre-clude your Councels from any further or
better provision for the public interest, or in any surer or better way.

3. Since you had so far engaged in the way of Addresses, we had some
apprehensions then (as from the Covenant and other Considerations) That to
acquit your selves and Adherents before God and the World (in relation to the
snare you seemed to be in) It did something lie upon you to make one Address
for all, upon things concerning purely the public interest and only
Essentials thereunto, without mixture of any by matters, from which either you
with safety to the public could possibly recede, or against which he might
have color to boggle (as it were) from Conscience or other specious pretenses,
and not his own interest only; that so you might at once make a full and
clear Trial, whether you could (with and by his consent) have such security
to the public interest, as that you might with the preservation and safety
thereof preserve also His Person and Honor (as in your Covenant) or whether he
would refuse that security to public interest merely for the upholding of
his own in opposition thereto, without other cavils, pretexts, or evasions:
And accordingly, though we may truly say, we never pressed you so far in point
of Address to him, as that you did ever actually make any, at our instance, or
according to our overtures; yet (after that he had escaped from the Army, and
quitted any pretext of obligation upon it, in relation to their desire of any
such Address) you did of your selves make such an Address in the render only
of four Bills, concerning singly the public interest, and but a small part of
it, merely for necessary security to it, and your selves, in order to a Treaty
for all therest; In which tender of yours we found clear satisfaction in our
Reasons and Consciences, as to our aforesaid scrupulous apprehensions: And
answerably (when you upon his refusal resolved against any more Addresses to
him, and began to take another course with him,) we did upon that very ground
declare our acquiescence in your Votes and our Resolutions of adherence to you
therein, (as may appear in the Paper then presented to you from the Army:) And
yet when we have said all this, or what ever might more be said in our excuse,
we will upon the grounds here before laid down (which have since been more
clearly made out to Us) acknowledge it our weakness, our error, and our
fault, both as to the matter and terms we propounded for an Address to him
(in respect of deficiency or insufficiency therein;) and also as to our desire
of any such Address at all, as the Case then stood (in respect of the
needlesnesse and insecurity thereof, and want of Justice therein) although we
see and own the providence of God, who ordered it for the best, that you did
make such an one.

Now if yet any shall objet the Covenant, as perpetually obliging to endeavor
the preservation of the Kings Person and authority, and consequently not
allowing any such way of security against him, as would be to the hurt of his
Person, or prejudice of his Authority, and so concluding us under a necessity
of perpetual Addresses to him for security, until he give it, as being the
only way consistent with the preservation of his Person and Authority.

To this we answer; That indeed the covenant, heaping together several
distinct interests (which are, or possibly may come to be inconsistent, or one
destructive to the other, or at least may be so made use of) and yet engaging
positively for them all, without expressing clearly and unquestionably, which
is chief and perpetual: and (for the rest) how far, and upon what
conditions the Covenanter shall be obliged to them, and what shall disoblige
him, we find it is (as other promissory oather of that kind) apt to be made a
very snare, serving to draw in many of several judgments and affections, each
in respect to that interest therein engaged for, which himself does most
affect, and so those that make least conscience of the Oath, make but an
advantage of it upon all occasions, to cry up that interest which themselves
prefer (though to the destruction or prejudice of the rest, yea of that which
is really the maine and best,) while those that make most conscience of the
Oath, and affect the principal and honestest part in it, are often withheld
from what is just and necessary in relation thereunto, being staggered in regard
of the prejudice it may be to the rest, to which jointly they seem obliged. But
this Covenant, as it is drawn (though it have something of that ensnaring
nature, yet as to this point) has not left the takers without an honest way
out; or if it had, yet through the providence of God the snare is broken, and
they may escape.

For,

1. The Covenant engaging to the matters of Religion, and public interests
primarily and absolutely (without any limitation) and after that to the
preservation of the Kings Person and Authority; but with this restrict on, [
viz. In the preservation of the true Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdoms.]
In this case, though a Caviller might make it a question, yet who will not
rationally resolve it, That the preceding matters of Religion, and the public
Interest, are to be understood as the principal and supreme matters engaged
for, and that of the Kings Person and Authority; as inferior and subordinate
to the other? And (if so) then we appeal to all reasonable men, whether those
words [In the preservation of the true Religion and Liberties] can be
understood, as a Restriction of our endeavors for preservation of Religion and
Liberties (so as the same may not be endeavored in any way that would be to
the prejudice of his Person or Authority) or not (sure'y) as a restriction to
the engagement for preservation of his Person and Authority, (so as to oblige
thereto no further, nor in any other way then shall be consistent with the
preservation and desence of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdoms,)
Yea might it not justly be so understood, that th'obligation to preserve his
Person and Authority, should be fulfilled in (as well as not extended further
then) the preservation of Religion and Liberties? In some of these senses those
words must be understood, or else they have none, but are valne words, making a
vain oath; If they were to be understood in the first sense, then (we are sure)
the whole proceedings of both Kingdoms in making and maintaining war against
him for preservation e^ther of Religion or Liberties, were questionable for
breach of the Covenant; since that way of preserving them did tend probably to
the destruction, and was without any safe provision for the defense either of
his person or of that authority that can properly be called his, or understood
in conjunction with his person, but that therein his person might probably have
been destroyed under the sword, or by a bullet (yea was ordinarily endeavored
to be so as well as the persons of others, in Arms with him) and that authority
of his was certainly opposed, and endeavored to be destroyed thereby in stead
of being defended. If these words be to be understood in either of the latter
senses, then it follows first, That if, by reason or experience (the ordinary
light men are in h^mane things to walk by) we find that the making of peace
with him, and therein the preserving or restoring of his person or authority,
is (as the case happens) either an unrighteous thing (in respect of the blood
and spoil he has caused in opposing that Covenant ever since it was made and
tendered, and of his never coming in, or ceasing that mischief, till by force
reduced, and by the hand of God delivered into the power of your justice,) and
in these or other respects, not consistent with true Religion, or else that (no
inward conviction, remorse, or chang of heart and principles rationally
appearing in him) it be not safe, but full of visible danger (if not certainly
destructive) to Religious or public interest, or to the persons that have
entered into that Covenant, or engaged in the common Cause, then surely (by the
Covenant it self) the preservation of his person or authority is not to be
endeavored so far, or in such a way; and consequently such a peace with him,
in such a case, is not to be sought, or admitted, or (at least) the Covenant
obliges not to it, but against it; and whether the present case and
consequences be not such, we refer to our several Reasons before given.
Secondly, from that sense it also follows, That if, by the same light, we
find, that (supposing no peace to be made with him) the continued preservation
of his person in your hands (though close in Carisbrook Castle) or the letting
him go whither he will to preserve himself, and your forbearing to bring him
to account or judgment for ought he has done, (when God has so given him into
your power, and given you so clear grounds of proceeding against him) would be
either an unrighteous thing, (and so inconfistent with true Religion) or so
far inconsistent with the preservaton and defense of Religion and Liberties,
or with your covenanted utmost endeavor to preserve them, as that it would
visibly expose them, and those that have engaged in covenant for them, to
perpetual danger, give perpetual occasion and advantage so new wars and
designs, to the destruction of them, or to the multiplying of blood and
oppression upon the kingdoms, give the King and his posterity a perpetual
privilege of impunity, and therein an invitation or encouragement to multiply
attempts of the like or greater mischiefs (though to th'overthrow of all
Religion and Liberties) yea, would give encouragement also unto Instruments to
serve them in such attempts, and thus would harden the hearts both of them and
their Instruments in such things to the ruin or perpetual prejudice and
danger of those higher things covenanted for, and persons covenanting, and
(lastly) would in consequence debar you from that which is the best fence, yea
essential to the defense of public Liberties, and positively covenanted so (
viz. the punishment of any the violaters thereof, if his Ministers, and by his
Commission) or would render your necessary proceeding against such unequal or
scandalous, then surely to the exempting of him from justice and continued
preservation of his person, so far, or in such a way, and in such a case the
Covenant cannot be understood to oblige, but rather to the contrary; Or if it
might be so understood, does it not call for explanation to clear it from
being understood in so wicked a sense? Yea, if it did (by the advantage of
words) extend to such a sense past explanation, and if so (through error,
inconsideration or deceit in the framing of it, or through flattery, evil
custom, or unbeleif and carnal policy in the passing of it,) you had
literally engaged your selves, and drawn in others to be engaged unto so
wicked and mischievous a thing; did it not call for Repentance when you find
such wickedness in it? And rather then unnecessarily to continue your selves,
and hold others under, but a color of Obligation, to a thing so evil, so full
of prejudice and danger unto, and so inconsistent with the security of so many
other unquestionably good things (to which in the same Covenant, as well as by
immutable duty you stand obliged,) would it not call for your utmost
consideration and endeavor (so far as providence has left you any occasion,
without sin or wrong) to extricate and clear your selves and others from such
a snare? In order to which we proceed and say.

2. That whatever, or how expressly soever the Covenant may seem to have
engaged unto, or possibly might have said or purported any thing in the Kings
behalf, or to his only benefit, yet (as God has ordered the business) it
does not now oblige you at all before God or man, in that matter. For first,
(considering it only as a Covenant betwixt man and man, as for the civil
parts it is,) where many or several persons joining to make a mutual Covenant
or agreement, do therein covenant for some things to the good and union of
themselves amongst themselves (who are present and parties to it,) and withal,
do make a covenanting clause therein, for something else, to the good or
benefit of another person, not present, nor party to the agreement, but whom
and whose interest (in regard of some concernment of his in their business, or
from good affection to him and desire of peace with him) they would willingly
provide for as well as for their own, to the end he might join with them in
the Agreement, and partake the benefit thereof as well as themselves, (we say
in such case) if the absent party, as he never required it, (so when it is
tendered to him for his conjunction,) shall not accept the Agreement, but refuse
to join in it, (and conceiving his Interest prejudiced thereby,) shall oppose
it, and begin, prosecute and multiply contests with all the Covenanters about
the matters contained in it; surely that person in so doing (as he keeps
himself free and no way obliged thereby, as to what concerns the rest, who
concluded it of their own heads, so) so he excludes himself from any claim to
any benefit therefrom at their hands as to what concerns himself, while he
continues so refusing and opposing; and by his once refusing upon a fair and
full tender (though he had done no worse,) sets the other Covenanters free from
any furher obligation, by virtue of that Covenant, as to what concerns his
Interest or benefit therein, although the Covenant (as to other matters
concerning the right and benefit of the Covenanters one from another,) stands
still obliging and in force; and what ever they shall afterward do to him,
(though indeed,) contrary to the letter or intention of such clause in their
Covenant on his behalf, yet it cannot by virtue of that Covenant, be
understood as a wrong to him, and consequently, not a wrong to any other
(before God or man,) since none but he (though it had been made or accepted as
mutual) could challenge the benefit of it. Now whether this be not your case
in relation to the King in this Covenant, witness your making and taking of it
without and against his consent; witness his often and continued refusals to
accept or join in it, his opposing and fighting against your selves and others
both in and for the taking and prosecuting of it; and as for the intention of
putting that clause concerning him into the Covenant, (though made in his
absence, and without his consent) It cannot by the general nature of such
Covenants be understood to be, that by it your selves should be obliged to that
of his Interest absolutely (whether he would accept or join in the Covenant,
or refuse and oppose it,) but only to exhibit your care and show how willing
you were (yea, really to go as far as you could therein) that he and his
Interest (so far as just,) might be provided for therein as well as your own
and the Kingdoms; and that you had no Design to exclude or prejudice his, if
he would accept and join in the Agreement as to the other; And even so the
words added to and closing up that clause in the Covenant do import, viz. [That
the world may bear witness with our Consciences of our loyalty, and that we
have no thoughts or intentions to diminish his Majesty's just power and
greatness.]

Secondly, (considering it as an Oath) the form of an Oath added to that of a
Covenant, makes it no other then a Covenant still, but taken as in the presence
of God, and only adds the calling of God to witness, as to the truth of your
intentions and faithfulness of your endeavors to perform what it, as a
Covenant, obliges unto; and look how far it in the nature of a Covenant, (as
to any particular matter) obliges, so far, and no further, or otherwise,
does that calling of God to witness engage him the more, to avenge any
falsehood in your intentions, or unfaithfulness in your endeavors to perform
it? and this is all the enforcement which that form of an Oath adds to that
of a Covenant, without obliging to any further matter, or for any longer or
more absolute continuance then it; as a Covenant does oblige; and therefore
wherein, and upon what supposition soever the Obligation cease as a Covenant,
that enforcement also cease as an Oath; so that if, as a Covenant it oblige
not to his benefit upon supposition of his refusal or opposall, upon the same,
it enforces naught to his benefit as an Oath.

If any object, that in what we have here said, we (who profess to dislike the
imposing of the Covenant with any penalty or Prosecution against refusers) do
seem to take advantage against his Majesty for refusals; we answer, we say not,
for, but upon; And if no other penalty be ever put upon Covenant-refusers,
save not to claim benefit by it, we shall ever acknowledge that to be most
just and reasonable against our selves, (if refusers.)

Having thus endeavored to Remonstrate the danger and evil of the way you are
in, and cleared the way unto what we have to propose, we shall with the same
plainness and faithfulness give you our apprehensions of the remedies; for
which purpose upon all the reasons and considerations aforegoing, we proceed to
offer, as follows.

First, we conceive and hope, that from what has before been said, you may
find abundant cause to forbear any further proceeding in this evil and most
dangerous Treaty, and to return to your former grounds in the Votes of
Non-addresses, and thereupon proceed to the settling and securing of the
kingdom without and against the King, upon such foundations as hereafter are
tendered; but if notwithstanding all the evils and dangers remonstrated to lie
even in the Treaty it self, you will yet proceed in such an evil way, we
shall at least desire that you make sure to avoid that maine venom and
mischief attending it, viz. The Kings restitution with impunity, etc. and that
imperfect bargaining for partial justice against inferior offenders; And for
the avoidance of these, we propound,

1. That you would reject those demands of the King, sent to you on his and his
Parties behalf, and (especially in relation to that concerning his restitution
or return to London with freedom, etc.) that it may be expressly declared
and provided by you, that, notwithstanding any thing concluded or to be
concluded in this Treaty, the Person of the King may, and shall be proceeded
against in a way of justice, for the blood spilt, and the other evils and
mischiefs done by him or by his Commission, Command or Procurement, and in
order thereto shall be kept in safe custody as formerly.

2. That for other delinquents you would lay aside that particular bargaining
Proposition, which as we understand, the King has refused in the terms you
offered, and whereby all your justice and mercy too would be rendered, (both for
the matter, qualifications and circumstances thereof) to be dependant upon
particular contract, with, and grant from the King, and not upon the judicial
power of the Kingdom in Parliament; and that in stead thereof it may be
declared and provided by you, that all Delinquents shall subject and submit to
the aforesaid judicial power, to be thereby proceeded against, according to
justice, or with mercy, as cause shall appear, and that none shall be exempt or
protected therefrom, nor pardonable by any other power, then that of the
Kingdom in Parliament, by which they shall be judged; this we propound, to the
end that public justice, and the interest of the Kingdom therein, may be
vindicated, salved and satisfied, and yet (when that is so provided for, (and
in some fittest examples of justice upon chief offenders,) shall be
effectuated) we wish as much mercy and moderation to the generality, upon their
submission, as formerly we have both desired and used, or as can consist with
the public interest and safety, and with competent satisfaction to those that
have engaged and suffered for it.

If (in relation to the former of these Provisions, viz. concerning the Person
of the King,) it be thought an unreasonable or unbeseeming demand in a
Personal Treaty, that one Party, (after Concessions to the other in all the
matters of right, and other things in question,) should agree, besides, to be
punished himself for having made the past contest about them, we confess it
might be thought so in a Treaty, betwixt Parties standing both free, and in an
equal balance of power or possibilities to obtain the cause; but so far as
a Treaty can rationally or properly be with a Party wholly subdued, captivated
and imprisoned, or in the power of the other to such a Treaty, such demands,
(if otherwise just) are very suitable and proportionable, and to any Treaty.

It seems surely, no less suitable to demand the principal to justice then
the accessories, (that were but his necessary and proper Agents in the
Contest,) especially where he is as much, (if not more) within the other
Parties power as they, and where it is not so much a demanding him to justice,
as a Proviso, that (being already in the power of their justice,) they will not
exempt him from it.

Thus therefore the power of justice and mercy being saved or reserved, we
proceed in order to the actual dispensing thereof, in relation to the late
wars, and thereby to peace with God, and present quiet amongst men, to propound
as follows,

1. That that capital and grand Author of our troubles, the Person of the
King, by whose Commissions, Commands or Procurement, and in whose behalf, and
for whose interest only, (of will and power,) all our wars and troubles have
been, (with all the miseries attending them,) may be speedily brought to
justice for the treason, blood and mischief, he is therein guilty of.

2. That a timely and peremptory day may be set for the Prince of Wales and the
Duke of York to come in and render themselves, by which time (if they do not)
that then they may be immediately declared incapable of any Government, or
trust in this kingdom, or the Dominions thereunto belonging, or of any kind of
Right within the same, and thence to stand exiled for ever, as enemies and
Traitors, to dye without mercy, if ever after found and taken therein; (or if
by the time limited, they or either of them do render themselves, that then the
Prince for his Capital Delinquency (being in appearance next unto his Fathers)
may either be proceeded against in justice, or remitted, according as upon his
appearance he shall give satisfaction or not; concerning his being drawn into
the rebellious engagements, he has appeared to head; and the Duke, as he shall
give satisfaction or not concerning his carriage in and since his going out of
the kingdom (being without leave) and in opposition or Contempt of the
Parliament, and to the prejudice of the public Peace; may accordingly be
considered as to future trust, or not; But (however) that the Estate and
Revenue of the Crown may be Sequestered, and all the matter of costly pomp or
state suspended for a good number of years, while the desolations and spoils
of the poor people made, by and in behalf of that family, and for that vain
interest (the state and greatness thereof) may be in good measure repaired or
recovered; And that the Revenue (saving necessary allowances for the Childrens
mainteynance, and to old servants and creditors of the Crown, not Delinquents)
and also the 100000. l. per annum, Voted to the Crown in Leiw of the Court of
Wards, may for those years be disposed toward public charges, debts and
damages for the easing and lessening of the peoples Contributions toward the
same; so as the Estates neither of the friends to public interest, nor alone
of the inferior Enemies thereto may bear wholly the burden of that loss and
charge, which by and for that Family, the Kingdom or the good people thereof
have bin or (for future security) shall be put unto.

3. That for further satisfaction to public justice, Capital punishment may
be speedily executed upon a competent number of his chief instruments also,
both in the former and latter War, and (for that purpose) that some such, of
both sorts, may be pitched upon to be made examples of justice in that kind, as
are really in your hands or reach, so as their exception from pardon, may not
be a mockery of Justice in the face of God and men.

4. That exemplary Justice being done in Capital punishment upon the
principal Author and some prime instruments of our late wars, and thereby
the blood thereof expiated, and others deterred from future attempts of the
like in either capacity; The rest of the Delinquents (English) in relation to
the wars, may upon their submission and rendering themselves to Justice, have
mercy extended to them for their lives, and that only Fines may be set upon
them (with reasonable moderation, but with respect to public damages) and
their persons further censured and declared to be incapable of any Office or
place of power or public trust in the kingdom, or of having any voice in
Elections thereto (at least) for a competent number of years; that also a short
and peremptory day may be set, by which time all such Delinquents may have
final warning to come in and render themselves to Justice, and to tender their
submissions to such Fines and cesures as aforesaid, and, that such of them as
shall so do by the day assigned, and shall (withal) pay in or secure their
Fine, according to reasonable time given, may have their Sequestrations taken
off, and be restored to their Estates; and that to all such (as also to all
those that have already submitted to Fines or Compositions, and paid in, or
secured the same) a general pardon may be granted, made and published by
Parliament, extending to absolve them from any further censure, damage,
trouble, or question, (either in the behalf of the public, or at the suit of
any private person,) for any thing said or done in prosecution of, or in
relation to the late War or troubles, and to restore them to all privileges,
benefits, and immunities equally with other people (excepting only, the
capacity to places of power or public trust, or to voices in Election
thereunto as aforesaid) that so they may not (as heretofore,) after Fines or
Compositions to the State for their Delinquencie, remain subject to any man's
action for any particular act of their Delinquencie to their endless trouble
or undoing, or the driving of them to desperate ways of public disturbance for
their own preservation; but that such of them as will for future live in peace
and subjection to the Laws and Government of the Nation, may enjoy the benefit
thereof, and have quiet and protection under the same and their posterities,
(yea, or themselves in time) partake fully and equally with others of the
common Interest contended for, and obtained. But as for such Delinquents, who
(having mercy tendered to them for life, as aforesaid) shall not by the day to
be set, come in, and render themselves, submit, and pay, or secure their Fines
as aforesaid, That it be declared, their Estates shall from that day be
absolutely Confiscated, and sold, or disposed of wholly to the public use, and
their persons to stand perpetually exiled (as Enemies and Traitors) and to die
without Mercy, if ever after found and taken within the Kingdom, or the
Dominions thereto belonging, and upon their default of appearance, etc. as
before, or at the said day, That they be from thenceforth proceeded against
accordingly.

5. That the satisfaction of Arrears to the Soldiery, with other public
Debts, and the competent reparation of public Damages (especially and
primarily of such as voluntarily engaged for, and have constantly adhered to
the common Cause, and suffered for the same) may be put into some orderly and
equal, or proportionable way; wherein (as to Debts and Damages) care may be
taken for some precedence of satisfaction to such, whose Loans, or losses
appear to have been great, and livelyhoods small, so as they can worst bear the
want, or delay: And toward these things (not impairing any other security
already given for Arrears to the Soldiery, in an equal way, or for just Debts
of other kinds) we propound, That the Fines, or Compositions of Delinquents
may be disposed of, and employed to those uses only, as also the Confiscations
and proceed of their Estates who shall be excluded from pardon, or not come in by
the day to be assigned, as in the last precedent Article.

Now (after public justice, and therewith the present quieting of the Kingdom
thus far provided for) we proceed in order, to the general satisfaction, and
settling of the Kingdom, as follows:

1. That you would set some reasonable and certain period to your own power, by
which time that great and supreme trust reposed in you, shall be returned into
the hands of the People, from, and for whom you received it; that so you may
give them satisfaction and assurance, that what you have contended for, against
the King (for which they have been put to so much trouble, cost, and loss of
blood) has been only for their Liberties, and common Interest, and not for
your own personal Interest, or power.

2. That (with a period to this Parliament, to be assigned as short as may be,
with safety to the Kingdom, and public Interest thereof) there may be a sound
settlement of the peace, and future Government of the Kingdom, upon grounds of
common Right, Freedom, and safety, to the effect here following:

1. That from the end of this, there may be a certain succession of future
Parliaments (Annual, or Bienniall) with secure provision,

1. For the certainty of their meeting, sitting, and ending.

2. For the equal distribution of Elections thereunto, to render the House of
Commons, as near as may be, an equal Representative of the whole People
electing.

3. For the certainty of the Peoples meeting (according to such Distributions)
to elect, and for their full freedom in elections, provided, That none who have
engaged, or shall engage in War, against the right of Parliament, and interest
of the Kingdom therein, or have adhered to the enemies thereof, may be capable
of electing, or being elected (at least during a competent number of years) nor
any other, who shall oppose, or not ioyn in agreement to this settlement.

4. For future clearing, and ascertaining the power of the said
Representatives; in order to which, That it be declared, That (as to the whole
interest of the People of England) such Representatives have, and shall have
the supreme power and trust, as to the making of Laws, Constitutions, and
Offices, for the ordering, preservation, and Government of the whole; and as to
the altering, and repealing, or abolishing of the same, the making of War, or
Peace; and as to the highest and final Judgment, in all civil things,
without further appeal to any created standing power, and that all the people
of this Nation, and all Officers of Justice, and Ministers of State (as such)
shall, in all such things be accountable and subject thereunto, and bound and
concluded thereby, provided, That,

1. They may not censure, or question any man after the end of this Parliament,
for any thing said or done in reference to the late Wars, or public
differences, saving in execution of such determinations of this Parliament, as
shall be left in force at the ending thereof, in relation to such as have
served the King against the Parliament.

2. They may not render up, or give, or take away any the foundations of common
Right, Liberty or Safety contained in this settlement and Agreement. But that
the power of these two things (last mentioned) shall be always understood to
be reserved from, and not entrusted to the said Representatives.

5. For liberty of entering dissents in the said Representatives, That, in case
of corruption, or abuse in these matters of highest trust, the People may be in
capacity to know who are free thereof, and who guilty, to the end only they may
avoid the further trusting of such, but without further penalty to any for
their free judgments there.

2. That no King be hereafter admitted, but upon the election of, and as upon
trust from the People, by such their Representatives, nor without first
disclaiming and disavowing all pretense to a negative voice, against the
determinations of the said Representatives, or Commons in Parliament; and that
to be done in some certain form, more clear then heretofore in the Coronation
Oath.

These matters of general settlement (viz. That concerning a period to this
Parliament, and the other particulars thencefollowing hitherto) we propound, to
be declared and provided by this Parliament, or by the authority of the Commons
therein, and to be further established by a general Contract, or Agreement of
the People, with their subscriptions thereunto, and that (withal) it may be
provided. That none may be capable of any benefit by the Agreement, who shall
not consent and subscribe thereunto; nor any King be admitted to the Crown, or
other person to any Office, or place of public trust, without express accord,
and subscription to the same.

We have thus plainly, and faithfully propounded our apprehensions, how the
evil and danger of the present Treaty may in good measure be avoided, and our
further conceptions of a way, wherein, hopefully through the blessing of God
(if most men be not given up, some to unjust domination, or particular
Interest, the rest to servitude) the Kingdom may be quieted, future
disturbances prevented, the common Kights and Liberties provided for, and the
Peace and Government of the Kingdom settled, to a just public Interest; and
this we have set forth in such heads and particulars, which (if you will but set
aside, for the time, less important matters) may most of them be brought to
effect, and the rest assured, and put into a good way of effect, within a few
Months, so as you might then ease the Kingdom from the burden of the
greatest part of that force, which otherwise (in case of Accommodation with the
King) you will be necessitated, for a much longer time (probably for many
years) to keep on, upon the public charge, unless, upon the Accommodation
you would give up all to the Kings power again, and expose those that have
engaged against him, as sacrifices to his and the Cavaliers Revenge: And (for
our parts) let but that way of Justice be effectually prosecuted, and the
settlement of the public Interest (upon such foundations as are before
propounded) be assured to us and the Kingdom, and put into a course of effect
(which as we said before, might well be in a few months) and we shall not only
embrace with cheerfulness, but shall with eagerness desire discharge from our
present service, and shall be most ready to disband all, or part, as shall be
thought fit, the Arrears of the soldiery being satisfied. We shall therefore
earnestly desire, that these things may be minded, and prosecuted effectually,
and that nothing may interrupt them, save what shall be for immediate and
necessary safety; And that (to avoid interruptions from such things as are not
necessary, or less proper for Parliamentary considerations or Debates) you
would leave all private matters, and things of ordinary Justice and right, to
the Laws and present proper Officers, and Administrations thereof, until
better can be provided, and commit all ordinary matters of State to the manage
of a fit Council of State (sufficiently empowered for that purpose, and
assisted with the addition of some Merchants, in relation to the ballancing,
security, and advance of Trade) so as you may be the more free for the present,
to intend those aforesaid Considerations of public Justice, and the
settlement of the Kingdom upon just and safe foundations of public interest,
and that when you have effectuated them, or put them into a way of effect, you
may (for the after time of this Parliaments continuance) more entirely apply
your Councels to such other things, as are the most proper work of Parliaments,
and by, and for which Parliaments have had their esteem in this Nation, and the
Kingdom most benefit by them, ( viz: the Reformation of evils, or
inconveniences in the present Laws and Administrations thereof, the redress
of abuses, and supplying of defects therein, and the making of better
constitutions for the well Government, and prosperity of the Nation, as also
the due proportioning of rates, and providing of moneys in the most equal, and
least grievous ways for all necessary uses of the public, and the like,) and
in Order to such things, that you would in due time and place (viz. after
public justice, and the general settlement) consider such special overtures
of that kind, as have been tendered to you in the Petitions of wel-wishers to
public good, and particularly in that large Petition from many about London,
Dated the 11 of September last, and also what shall be tendered of like kind
from others, that so what is really for the remedy of common greivances, or the
advancement of common good may not be slighted, or neglected, but that evils in
that kind being removed, and good things ordained, and provided by you, for
the ease, benefit, and prosperity of the people (in all things possible,) you
may (when you come to lay down your trust) leave a good savor behind you,
both to the name of Parliaments, and also of men professing Godliness (so much
as this House has done) and therein (chiefly) to the Honor of Almighty God,
who has (in his rich Grace and mercy) done such wonders for you and us: And
for furtherance to all these ends, (since the heart of man is deceitful, and
corrupt above all things, and most apt to answerable Councels and actings,
where it can hope to walk in the dark, undiscerned, or undistinguished, though
but to the eye of man) we must again desire, That even from henceforth the
aforesaid liberty of entering dissents (as it is in the Scotch Parliament, where
lately there has appeared a most useful Effect of it so also) may be admitted
amongst you, or (at least) that in these transactions, of such high moment to
the public, and all honest Interests, and in times, so apt to deceit,
defection, and Apostasy; that liberty may be taken by all honest faithful
Members, that desire to appear (as their hearts to God, so) their ways to good
men; yet still we wish not (whoever should by that means be detected for
corrupt Counsels) that for his judgment there, any advantage should be taken
without doors, but only that men may avoid the further trusting of such
persons, and that the innocent may not be unjustly prejudiced or suspected.

Thus, as the exigence of the case, and nature of the business requires,
(being of such vast importance to all Public, Religious and honest interest,
not in this Kingdom only, but in neighbor nations) we have dealt with all
plainness and cleernesse, as God has enabled us; and now to conclude, we
hope, that in an age of so much light, mere will or resolution will not be held
forth, or pursued against it; but that, what reason, or righteousness there is
in the things we have said, will be considered and followed: nor let it find
prejudice with you from any disdain toward those from whom it comes, (being in
the condition of an Army, looked upon as servants under you) since servants may
speak to their masters, and ought to be heard and regarded, even when they
speak for their own right only, and rather when they speak for the good and
safety of them they serve, but much more when they speak of that wherein they
have some joint interest with them; and yet more, when (those their immediate
masters being themselves also servants, and Trustees for the benefit of others)
they speak for the interest of those, for whom both are employed.

By the appointment of his Excellency, the Lord General, and his General
Council of Officers. Signed, John Rushworth.
