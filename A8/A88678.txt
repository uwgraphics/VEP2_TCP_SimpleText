AN IMPARTIAL RELATION OF THE LATE FIGHT AT PRESTON. Being the Copy of a
Letter, written (as the Tenor of it imports) By Sir Marmaduke Langdale.
Sir,
THis will give you a final account of my employment, which is now ended;
being a Prisoner in Nottingham Castle, where I have civil usage. You have
heard the condition I was in at Settle and Sigleswick, with about 3000 Foot and
600 Horse, the 13. of August, where hearing the Parliament Forces were gathered
together, and Marching toward me, I went to acquaint Duke Hamilton therewith
to Horneby, where he determined for Preston, where (his Army being numerous in
Foot) he might have the greater advantage upon his Enemy in those enclosed
Countries. I Marched near Clitherow toward Preston, in the March I met with
the Lord Callender and diverse of the Scottish Officers Quartered in my way,
with whom I was resolved to March to Preston, but for the present the
Intelligence was, that the Parliament Forces were divided, some part whereof
were marched to Colne, and so to Manchester, to relieve that Town in case we
should press upon it. This made the Officers of Horse more negligent of
repayring to Preston, but Quartered wide in the Country; the same night
certain intelligence came, that Lieutenant General Cromwell with all his
Forces was within 3. miles of my Quarters, which I imediately sent to the Duke,
and told it to my Lord Leviston, to acquaint Lieutenant General Middleton
therewith, and drew my Forces together in a field, and so marched toward
Preston betimes in the morning; where I found the Duke and Lord Callender with
most part of the Scottish Foot drawn up; their resolution was to march to
Wiggan, giving little credit to the Intelligence that came the night before,
but suffer their Horse to continue in their Quarters 10. and 12. miles off;
Within half an hour of our meeting, and by that time I was drawn into the
Close near Preston, the Enemy appeared with a small body of Horse: The Scots
continue their resolution for Wiggan, for which end they drew their Foot over
the Bridge; The Enemy coming the same way that I had marched fell upon my
Quarter, where we continued skirmishing six hours, in all which time the Scots
sent me no relief: they had very few Horse come up, so as those they sent me
at last were but few, and were soon beaten; but if they had sent me 1000 Foot
to have flanked the Enemy, I doubt not but the day had been ours. Yet I kept my
post with various success, many times gathering ground of the Enemy, and as
the Scots acknowledge they never saw any Foot fight better then mine did: The
Duke being incredulous that it was the whole Army sent Sir Lewis Dives to me;
to whom I answered that it was impossible any Forces that were inconsiderable
would adventure to press upon so great an Army as we had, therefore he might
conclude it was all the power they could make, and with which they were
resolved to put all to the hazard, therefore desired that I might be seconded,
and have more Powder and Ammunition, I having spent 9. Barrels of Powder: The
Scots continue their March over the River, and did not secure a Lane near the
Bridge, whereby the Parliament Forces came upon my flanks; Neither did the
Forces that were left for my supply, come to my relief, but continued in the
Rear of mine, nor did they ever face the Enemy but in bringing up the Rear;
When most part of the Scots were drawn over the Bridge, the Parliament Forces
pressed hard upon me in the Van, and Flanks; and so drive me into the Town,
where the Duke was in person, with some few Horse, but all being lost,
Retreated over a Foord to his Foot; After my Forces were beaten, the
Parliament Forces beat the Scots from the Bridge presently, and so came over
into all the Lanes that we could not join with the Foot, but were forced to
Charlow, where we found Lieutenant General Middleton ready to advance toward
Preston to the Foot, which he did; but not finding them there, returned to
Wiggan, where the Duke was with his Foot, (mine totally loft.) There they
took a resolution to go to my Lord Biron, for which end they would march that
night to Warrington: In their march the Parliament Forces fell so fast upon
their Rear, that they could not reach Warrington that night. And Lieutenant
General Middleton finding himself unable to withstand their Forces, left the
Foot in Warrington to make their own conditions: So as we marched toward
Malpas, six of the Scottish Lords in this march left us, whereof my Lord
Traquaire was one; Most part submitted to the Sheriff of Shropshire, who sent
two Gentlemen of that Country to the Duke to offer him the same Quarter that
the Earl of Traquaire had: From Malpas we marched to Drayton, and so to Stone;
in our march from thence to Utoxeter the Parliament Forces fell upon the Rear
and took Lieutenant General Middleton; At Utoxeter the next morning going to
attend the Duke for his resolution, I found him extreme sick, not able to
March; My Lord Callender seemed to refuse all ways of Treaty, but rather to
march Northward where we had a considerable Force, and the whole Kingdom of
Scotland at our backs, upon this we marched over the River toward Ashburne; I
had the Van, and was marching, presently my Lord of Callender came to me, told
me he would march with me, but that none of his Forces would, and that he had
much ado to eseape them; that he was come himself alone, his Horse pricked in
the foot, and without a Cloak. I persuaded his Lordship that it was better to
return to his Forces, because I could not protect him, and seeing the Scots
had left me, I was resolved to sever, and shift every man for himself; but to
capitulate I could not with a safe conscience: After some little discourse he
returned to his Forces, and I marched toward Nottingham, where those few I
had, took several ways, and I got that night over Trent, and came to a house
6. miles from Nottingham, where My self, Colonel Owen, Lieutenant Colonel
Galliard, and Major Constable, thought to have shrouded our selves as
Parliamenteeres, and so made no resistance, but were discovered, and are now in
Nottingham Castle this 26 of August 1648.

FINIS.
