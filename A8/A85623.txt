The Great Sins of DRUNKENESS and GLUTTONY set forth in the proper Colors. And
by Scripture sentences and pious Meditations briefly confirmed.
A DRUNKARDES PICTURE and his DOOM by Scripture A BELLY-GOD. Phil. 3. 19.
SODOMS SINN'S pride fullness of bread and idleness. Ezekiel. 16. 49
allegorical depiction of Drunkenness and Gluttony Woe unto them yt are mighty

WHy do I quaffe
Much more then nature can?
The loss is mine:
I justly may be termed
A beast, not man.
To drown my Reason
In a cup of Wine,
Yea, ten fold worse:
A monster made at least.
God made me man,
I make my self a beast.
And must I die?
Why surfeit I on pleasure?
Must I needs die?
Why swim I in delight?
Must I needs die?
Why live I not aright?
Must I needs die?
Why live I then in sin?
Thrice better for me
I had never been.
PRepare by dying still,
Lest of bliss
When time shall be no more
Sadly thou miss.
For in Christ's School
This Paradox learn I;
Who dies before he dies,
Shall never die.
If I must die,
Then after must begin
The life of joy or
Torment without end:
The life of torment
Purchased is by sin;
Then now amend:
Why will thou swear,
Curse, lust, and lie?
Think thou on this,
That all must die?
The Conclusion.
Repent therefore whilst breath does last
For after death repentance's past.
And he that hopes to live for aye,
Must leave sin, and repent each day.
