By his Excellency the Lord General.
WHereas daily complaints are made, that some disorderly Soldiers under my
command, contrary to the Laws of the Nation, and Discipline of the Army, have,
and still do, commit very great Outrages and Ryots, with their Arms entering
into Parks, Chases, and Warrens, and thence stealing all sorts of Dear and
Conneys, menacing the death of the Keepers and all others who any ways oppose
them: For future remedy whereof, these are to desire all Field-Officers and
Captains that forthwith they cause to be taken from every their Soldiers all
such Hounds, Gray-hounds, and other Dogs which may any ways be hurtful to
Dear or Conneys, as their Soldiers now have, or hereafter shall have in their
custody, or in the custody of any others for their use; and so dispose of them,
that hereafter they come not to the use of any Soldier. And after Proclamation
hereof duly made, all Soldiers are hereby straightly charged and required,
that they neither keep, or to their use cause to be kept, any such Dog as
aforefaid; and that upon no manner of pretense whatsoever, they go into any
Chase, Park, or Warren, (except a common way lie through the same, having a
Furlough or Pass under their Officers hand, and are upon their necessary
business, marching upon that way without Gun or hurtful Dog as aforesaid,
(and except they shall be upon their march according to Orders:) and if any
Soldier shall be found offending contrary hereunto, the Keepers and Warrenors
of such Dear and Conneys are desired to use their endeavors, (and if need
require) with assistance of others, to apprehend such Soldiers, and them in
custody deliver to the next Officer of the Army, by him safely to be caused to
be kept, until they shall be tried before a Court Martial; and all Officers
and Soldiers are hereby required, upon notice given, to be ayding and
assisting unto such Keepers and Warrenors in the apprehending such Soldiers.
And I desire every the Court Martials throughout the army and Garrisons to be
very careful in exemplary punishing such Soldiers as shall be found offenders
contrary hereunto.

Given under my hand and seal at White Hall the fifth day of September 1649.
FAIRFAX.

To be proclaimed at the head of every Regiment, and in every Garrison, by
sound of Trumpet, or beat of Drum.
