^oole that I was, who had so fair a State
Power or five thousant by the year at least.
And was^ it so as I have done of late.
On Whores and Bawdes and like a filthy beast
Caught foul diseases, which consume me sore.
And all proceeds from loving every whore.
As many as I ere have lain withal*
See here their faces how they face my gown
Of all sorts* little middle sizd and tall
Some Lovelie fair* some black and some are brown
Some Wiwes* some Maidens some rich and others poor
^^me old, some young vel overie one a whore.
With all these sometime I have been acquainted
Which were they in their livelie colors limn'd,
Some should you see how they themselves have painted*
How others with their borrowed hair are trimmd
How like this Monkey sick themselves they feign
When in their bones* indeed, lies all the pain
But since these day are done all warning take
How with their wealth they do their bodies wast
And then themselves to Hospitalls betake
Or Scorned Beggars do become at last
Vice* then by my example learn to fly
But most of all (the basest) LETCHERIE.
