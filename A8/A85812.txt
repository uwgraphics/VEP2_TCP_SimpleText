LONDON, Printed for John Matthewes.

HIs Excellence the Earl of Essex by order from the High Court of Parliament
about the middle of the last week advancing forward in pursuit of the
Cavaliers, first to Windsor, and thence to Marlow and Henly upon Thames; from
whence Colonel Hurrey was sent with the Forces maintained by the City of
London, to try if it were possible to get beyond Reading to stay the Cavaliers
in their passage thence to Oxford. Upon notice of which intention and
advertisement of the Earl of Essex his Excellence proceedings, the Cavaliers
quickly abandoned Reading, retyring in all haste toward Oxford, about which the
main body of their army lay billited, leaving nevertheless in the Town of
Reading for the security of it to their part, a considerable Garrison; some
conjecture 1500 men, under the command of Colonel Kirk and others; His
Excellence in the interim having certain notice of the passages of the
Cavaliers, employed Colonel Hampden, and the aforesaid Colonel Hurry in their
pursuit, who cut off diverse of their straglers, and some of their Rere, giving
them very frequent and fierce Alarums* his Excellence remaining still about
Marlow and Kingston upon Thames, intending to send some other Forces into
Sussex, where Master Ford the High Sheriff with the assistance of the Earl of
Thanet, has raised two thousand men, drawing them toward the good Town of
Jews, which has still stood faithful to the Parliament. The aforesaid
Colonels Hampden and Hurry, with the trained Bands of Buckinghamshire and the
Londoners Forces, having left the pursuit of the army, retired to Reading,
intending if it were possible, to reduce that Town to the obedience of the
Parliament by treaty, if not, to accomplish it by force: and so being drawn
together in one Body, they sat down not far from the Town, sending with a
Trumpet a Gentleman of quality to demand the said Town of the Garrison,
promising to dismiss all such as were not noted Malignants, and proscribed by
the Parliament, in safety. The Governor Colonel Kirk and his associates in
great contempt and derision answered, that they knew not by what or whose
authority they came to demand that Town of them, which was His Majesty's, and
by His Majesty to them delivered to be kept for His use, which they were
resolved to do against all the world, and so dismissed the Trumpet and
Gentleman, with many opprobrious and uncivil speeches against the Parliament
and the present Forces, bidding them tell those that sent them they would pay
their Roundheads if they came within their reaches, and so instantly ordered
themselves for their defense, forcing the honest Townes-men who had rather have
had their room then their companies, to put on harness and assist them in
manning their works, which they had before made with as much skill and
strength as their Engineers could possibly direct. Colonel Hampden and
Colonel Hurry resolute, not to depart without carrying the town, begun to
make their approaches and so planted their Cannon that they shot into the town
with ease, which yet they were loath to do, lest they should injure the honest
inhabitants. The Cavaleers within answered ours with their Ordnance; but our
trenches were so advantagiously situated, that they did us but little harm,
our men in the mean while playing over into their Works with their Muskets,
made them find it very hot service* Yet their Commanders, especially Colonel
Kirk, animating on his own men, and enforcing the townsmen in a manner unto
the service, they slew some few of our men; which rather encouraged then
disheartened the rest: at last, after some attempts, as fallies out of their
works upon ours, in which they were with very considerable loss repulsed, the
darkness of the night parted the medley. Colonel Hampden and his valiant
associate Colonel Hurry setting careful Watches in their Works, determined
as soon as it was light to resalute the Gentlemen with a fresh charge; who
(like Cavaleers) spent most part of the night in carowsing, and swearing death
and a thousand confusions to our forces; and a little before day departed well
laden with Wine from their Works to their Lodgings, leaving but a very slender
Guard in their Works, and those most of them Townsmen. Our men in the morning
admiring the solitude and silence that was in their Works, informed Colonel
Hampden of it; who gave immediate order, that some Companies of his best and
most resolute Soldiers should try if they could force their Works by
onslaught. And so fair and softly without least noise or tumult four hundred
able men attempted the assault, passing their ditches without discovery, they
got upon their Rampire, and so fell pell-mell into the Work: The townsmen that
were in guard threw down their arms, and willingly yielded themselves to
their Friends; the Cavaleers that were in that Work retired to the next*
whither our men pursued them with much resolution; but there the encounter was
different, the Soldiers in that strength being not so easily driven from their
stations, put back our Soldiers, slaughtering good store of them in the
ditches* so that undoubtedly they had been put to the retreat* had not Colonel
Hampden advanced more men to their succors; who getting up to their
companions, and with fresh men supplying the places of those that were fallen,
they brought the business into pretty equal terms, when all the Cavaleers
about this time awaked from their drunken humor with the noise and danger,
came rushing in like a violent flood to the rescue of their companions, with
their Commander Colonel Kirk: But neither their number, nor desperateness
amated the courage of noble Colonel Hampden, and his resolute Buckinghamshire
Militia, who charged and discharged upon them with such fury and nimblenesse,
that the Cavaleers began to drop on all sides. Yet knowing it was in vain to
quail at such a push, being reduced as it were to the l^st precipice, bestird
themselves very valiantly, beating down our men at push of pike into the
graffe, and with their Muskets and hand-Granadoes, doing some small execution
upon our men, which was requited with treble the damage we received; Colonel
Kirkes Lieutenant being slain, and other Cavaleers of note and quality, yet
could not that tough Soldier Colonel Kirk be driven either to fear or
flight, when Colonel Hurry, who was gotten by this side to the other side or
quarter of their sconce, with great fury, but greater discretion, assailed them
there, omitting nothing that might tend to the destruction of those desperate
Malignants, who still made good their Work for the space of four whole hours
by Redding clock, till there was at least four hundred of them de^d in the
place, as if they had intended to make a new bulwark of their bodies, to defend
that place dead, which they could not keep living: Our men having advanced
their Ensigns on the top of the Work* Colonel Kirk giving place to
necessity* withdrew by a fally port on that side where our men could not come,
with the rest of his Cavaleers, into the Town, and there getting to their
horses, (nay some of them leaving the^ behind for haste, fled on foot) the
Colonel and his Horsemen made haste away from our men, who did not pursue
them, contenting themselves, and thanking God for that victory and the recovery
of that good town; yet all the Cavaliers escaped not, some of them being
sorely, some slightly wounded were made prisoners: as also diverse others that
were not nimble enough to accompany their fellows in their flight, their
number in all two hundred and fifty: there fell in both the works at least
five hundred soldiers; there were taken eight good pieces of Canon all the
Cavaliers bag and baggage, with some money, which they had unjustly gotten by
plunder and rapine in those and other countries. The townsmen of Reading for
joy of their deliverance from their unwelcome guests, whom they entertained
more for fear then affection, making bonefires, and ringing their bells at our
arrival into their town. Colonel Kirk is certainly fled toward the King to
Oxford* who on the knowledge of this disaster to Reading, or rather happiness,
and his certainty of his Excellence the Earl of Essex approches thither,
intends as it is more then probable, to remove with speed from Oxford toward
Worcester* and so to Shrewesbury, as is imagined, because a great part of the
maine body of his army is sent before toward those parts, where his Majesty
intends to spend the rest of this Winter, there to unite himself with James
Earl of Darby, with his Cheshire and Lancashire forces; and William Earl of
Newcastle with his Northern Regiments: as also to receive, if they be not
prevented, supply of ammunition and money, which he daily expects, as the late
intercepted Letter made mention from Denma^ke, France, and other places, where,
by the instigation and endeavors of his crafty malignant agents he has hopes
to be furnished with such provisions.

His excellence the Earl of Essex is yet at Henley upon Thames, expecting
convenient opportunity of marching after his Majesty, when he shall remove
toward the aforementioned places: and this day we had intelligence from our
forces which were sent into Sussex to relieve that County from the malignants,
of their success. The Sheriff Ford marching along the country, enforcing all
the wellaffected honest people in his way, from Chichester to Lewis, to side
with him against the Parliament* threatening them to fire their houses, and cut
their throats, if they did not yield to his unjust commands, him and his
Regiment, with the Earl of Thanets companies, our forces pursued, finding
every where as they marched lamentable expressions of their inhumane cruelties.
At last, upon Hawoods Heath, some seven miles from Lewis, and two miles from
Cuckefield in Sussex, they overtooke Sheriff Ford with his malignants, and
valiantly resolved to give him battle; our forces falling on him and his
malignants very hotly, both armies being without Ordnance, the fight was
performed with their muskets at first, and after some volleys, our horse broke
into their Van, and our footmen just at that instant charging courageously
into their quarters, they began a little to give ground, but being more in
number then we, it was impossible on the sudden to put them into rout, though
they were much discomposed with that furious assault; nevertheless, Sheriff
Ford, with the Earl of Thanets Horse, made good the field for at least an
hour, though there fell in that place at least two hundred of their foot. In
fine, the reserve of our forces coming in to the assistance of our body, they
were at apparent rout; the poor country people that were enforced by the
Sheriff to that service, flinging away their arms, and running as fast as
their legs would carry them to Hurst, Dichiling, and the neighboring Villages:
Master Ford, with the Earl of Thanets horse, flying with all speed up to the
not far distant downs, and so to Wissum to the Earls House, whence they are
returned toward Chichester. Our forces marching on toward Lewis to secure
that good and loyal town from the future attemps of malignants.

FINIS.
