A LETTER Which was delivered to the KING On the second day of the second
Month 1660. sent (From the Barbados, on the Behalf of many Thousands in the
West Indies)
KING CHARLES,
THese are to Acquaint Thee, that there are many People, even Thousands that
are destroyed, and are perishing, for lack of the true knowledge of God in
these Western parts, and Islands, under thy Dominion, and we the Servants of
the living God, unto whom he has made known himself, and revealed his
Salvation, and has made us Partakers of h^s heavenly Power, and given unto us
his holy Spirit, by which he has commanded us, and is leading us to do his
Will in the Earth, as it is done in Heav^n and has laid a necessity upon us,
that we should preach the Gospel of glad tidings, and of peace unto the
Nations, and unto the Islands, that so others might partake of the like
precious mercies with us, and come to witness the salvation of God unto their
souls, and the enjoyment of his Presence, and in obedience to the Lord, and
for the love we bare to all people, being sensible of their languishing
condition, and miserable state, We are freely given up, and counts not our
lives, (nor any thing that we have dear unto us, that so the people might come
to the knowledge of the Truth, and to a right understanding of Gods everlasting
way of life and peace and might come to be redeemed from their sins, and
changed from the evil of their ways, and restored unto God, to be heirs of
his Blessing and Mercy which endures for ever, to all them that love him, and
obeys his Spirit, and walks in the light of the Lamb Christ Jesus: But so it
is, (...)o King, that by reason of many wicked and ungodly Laws that
unrighteous men have made, who are enemies to the Lord, and to all them who
truly breethes and pants after him, and that hungers and thirsts after
righteousness; by reason of which Laws the Lords people suffers, and his
servants are kept out of Islands, and places, and banished, and persecuted, and
great Fines and Pe^al^ies laid upon Masters of Ships, if they carry them, or
any that shall receive them, which thing stops the work of the Lord, and
hinders the truth from being made known to the people, and Gods love from
breaking forth unto the Nations, and people are unhealed, and unconverted unto
the Lord, and many wanders in sorrow, and are mourning in desolate places, and
their souls are grieved and bowed down by reason of their oppressors; and of
the wickedness of men, who hinders that from being made known to them which is
their chiefest good, and most preciousest treasure, therefore these are to
desire thee in the behalf of the Lord God, and of many good people, who are
breathing and thirsting after him, that thou put on bowels of pity and
compassion toward the people over whom thou art set in Authority, and send
forth thy order, that all such wicked laws and acts, which tends so much to the
ruin and destruction of thy subjects, both of their souls, and bo(...)ies,
and estates, may be made null and void, and of none effect, and suffer not the
people under thy Dominion to lie in such deep distress (...)d under such great
suffering both of soul and body, when a word from thy mouth* or a few lines
under thy hand would help them, and (...)se them from their heavy burdens, and
sad afflictions. Therefore show forth thy power, and make known thy Authority
with what speed (...)ou can, to put a stop and an end to these things, and
hereby thou will manifest thy love to the people under thee, and the righteous
and (...)pright in heart will rejoice at thy goodness, and Gods blessing will
be the reward of thy so well doing, and it will redound to thy ho(...)ur for
ever, and bring peace to thy soul, and many thousands of people will be
refresht, and comforted thereby, and in doing the Will (...) (...)od, herein he
will make thy Reign prosperous, and thy Government will be blessed, therefore
while thou have time and power in thy (...)and (...) do good, do it, and do not
spare, nor linger, nor delay, knowing that the more thou do for the Lord,
and for the good of the Na(...)ions, a people under Thee, the greater will be
Thy reward, and herein thou will be clear of all the peoples blood, which
otherwise may be required at thy hand if they perish, and are destroyed for
lack of that which they might have; was the Islands and Places free from wicked
and cruel Laws, and barbarous actions acted under thy Name; by which Thy power
is abused, and the people also, by such who neither loves God, nor any that
fear him, but seeks to persecute, and to destroy all, in whom there is any true
appearance of good, and works of Christ Jesus in their hearts. Therefore, O
King! suffer not thy Name to be abused, nor the good people under Thee to be
made havoc of, and r^, and destroyed for their good conscience sake, and
obedience toward God; but let them be made free by Thy power from the wicked
Laws of ungodly men, and let there be free liberty, and tolleration for all us
who are called Quakers, to go into any place under thy Dominion (as we are
moved) to preach the Gospel, and make known the Truth which we have freely
received from the Lord, and shall freely give it, and declare it to all, in
whom their is a heart to receive, and to believe, and love the things that does
belong to their eternal peace: And send thy Order forthwith to New England,
Virginia, Marieland, Bermuda, Neves, Christophers, Antego, Montferrat, and
Jamaica, and to all these Western parts, that so Gods power and blessing may
go through the Nations and Islands, and his saving health may be made known
unto the People, who many of them are sick, and wounded, and sore diseased, and
most greviously perplexed in their souls, and spirits, for want of the right
understanding, and knowledge of the Lord, and of the excellency of his power,
in which is deliverance, and peace, and life, and salvation, for evermore, in
whose power this is written to Thee by the command of God, and in the behalf of
thousands of people, and of many wearied souls, the sense of whose sufferings I
have the feeling of, and do cry out unto Thee in the Name of the Lord God of
heaven and earth, that Thou do what belongs to Thy people in this matter, and
let it be speedily accomplished by Thee, that God may accomplish his will in the
earth, and make known his blessing, and mercy unto Thee, who has said, That
blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy; and that this may be
thy Portion, is the desire of my soul,

I who am a Servant of the Lord, and a lover of all Peoples souls, and seeks
only the good, and prosperity, and salvation thereof, both of the King, and all
his good Subjects, and people under his Dominion, called by the name of

Barbados this 21. of the 11. Mon. 1660. ROBERT MAYLINS.
