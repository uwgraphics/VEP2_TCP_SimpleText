Charles R.

OUr express pleasure is, That this Petition of the Major, Aldermen, and
Commons of Our City of London, with Our gracious Answer thereunto, be read in
all Churches and Chapels by all Parsons, Vicars or Curates, within Our Cities

LONDON: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.

To The KINGS most Excellent Majesty, The humble PETITION of the MAjOR,
ALDERMEN, and COMMONS of the City of LONDON;
Shows
THat the Petitioners, Your Majesty's most humble and Loyal Subjects, being
much pierced with the long and great divisions between Your Majesty and both
Your Houses of Parliament, and with the sad and bloody effects thereof, both
here and in Ireland, are yet more deeply wounded by the misapprehension which
Your Majesty seems to entertain, of the Love and Loyalty of this Your City,
as if there were some cause of Fear, or suspicion of Danger to Your Royal
Person, if Your Majesty should return hither; And that this is made the
unhappy Bar to that blessed Reconciliation with Your great and most faithful
Council, for preventing that desolation and destruction, which is now most
apparently imminent to Your Majesty and all Your Kingdoms.

For satisfaction therefore of Your Majesty, and clearing of the Petitioners
Innocence, they most humbly declare, (as formerly they have done) that they
are no way conscious of any disloyalty, but abhor all thoughts thereof: And
that they are resolved to make good their late solemn Protestation and Sacred
Vow made to Almighty God, and with the last drop of their dearest bloods to
defend and maintain The true Reformed Protestant Religion; and according to the
duty of their Allegiance, Your Majesty's Royal Person, Honor and Estate,
(what ever is maliciously and most falsely suggested to Your Majesty to the
contrary) as well as The Power and Privileges of Parliament, and The lawful
Rights and Liberties of the Subject: And do hereby engage themselves, their
Estates, and all they have, to their uttermost power, to defend and preserve
Your Majesty and both Houses of Parliament from all Tumults, Affronts and
Violence, with as much Loyalty, Love and Duty, as ever Citizens expressed
toward Your Majesty or any of Your Royal Progenitors in their greatest
Glory.

THe Petitioners therefore upon their bended knees do most humbly beseech Your
Majesty to return to Your Parliament (accompanied with Your Royal, not Your
Martial Attendance) to the end that Religion, Laws, and Liberties may be
settled and secured, and whatsoever is amiss in Church and Commonwealth,
reformed by their Advice, according to the fundamental Constitutions of this
Kingdom; And that such a Peace may thereby be obtained, as shall be for the
Glory of God, the Honor and Happiness of Your Majesty and Posterity, and the
Safety and Welfare of all Your Loyal Subjects, who (the Petitioners are fully
assured, whatsoever is given out to the contrary) do Unanimously desire the
Peace herein expressed.

And the Petitioners shall ever Pray, etc. MICHELL.

HONI SOIT QVI MAY Y PENSE

His MAJESTY has graciously considered this Petition, and returns this Answer:
THat His Majesty does not entertain any misapprehension of the Love and
Loyalty of His City of London; As he has always expressed a singular Regard
and Esteem of the Affections of that City, and is still desirous to make it his
chief place of Residence, and to continue and renew many Marks of His Favor to
it; So He believes much the better and greater part of that His City is full of
Love, Duty and Loyalty to His Majesty: And that the Tumults which heretofore
forced His Majesty for His safety to leave that place, though they were
contrived and encouraged by some principal Members thereof (who are since well
known, though they are above the reach of Justice) consisted more of desperate
Persons of the Suburbs, and the neighboring towns (who were misled too by the
cunning and malice of their seducers) then of the Inhabitants of that City. He
looks on His good Subjects there as Persons groaning under the same Burden
which does oppress His Majesty, and awed by the same persons who begat those
Tumults, and the same Army which gave Battle to his Majesty: And therefore as
no good Subject can more desire from his soul a Composure of the general
Distractions, so no good Citizen can more desire the Establishment of the
particular peace and Prosperity of that Place by His Majesty's Access thither,
then His Majesty Himself does.

But His Majesty desires His good Subjects of London seriously to consider
what Confidence His Majesty can have of security there, whilst the Laws of
the Land are so notoriously despised and trampled under foot, and the wholesome
Government of that City (heretofore so famous over all the world) is now
submitted to the Arbitrary Power of a few desperate Persons of no Reputation,
but for malice and disloyalty to Him; Whilst Arms are taken up not only
without, but against His Consent and Express Command, and Collections
publicly made, and Contributions avowed for the maintenance of the Army which
has given Him Battle, and therein used all possible means, Treason and Malice
could suggest to them to have taken His life from Him, and to have destroyed
His Royal Issue, whilst such of His Majesty's Subjects, who out of Duty and
Affection to His Majesty, and compassion of their bleeding Country, have
labored for Peace, are reviled, injured, and murdered, even by the Magistrates
of that City, or by their directions: Lastly, what hope His Majesty can have
of Safety there, whilst Alderman Pennington, their pretended Lord Major, (the
principal author of those Calamities which so nearly threaten the ruin of
that famous City) Ven, Foulke, and Mainwaring, (all persons notoriously guilty
of Schism and High Treason) commit such Outrages in oppressing, robbing, and
imprisoning, according to their discretion, all such His Majesty's loving
Subjects, whom they are pleased to suspect but for wishing well to His
Majesty: And His Majesty would know whether the Petitioners believe that the
reviling and suppressing the Book of Common Prayer (established in this Church
ever since the Reformation) the discountenancing and imprisoning Godly, learned
and painful Preachers, and the cherishing and countenancing of Brownists,
Anabaptists, and all manner of Sectaries, be the way to defend and maintain the
true Reformed Protestant Religion? That to comply with, and assist Persons who
have Actually attempted to kill His Majesty, And to allow and favor Libels,
Pasquills, and Seditious Sermons against his Majesty, be to defend his Royal
Person and Honor according to the duty of their Allegiance? Whether to
imprison men's Persons, and to Plunder their houses because they will not Rebel
against His Majesty, nor assist those that do? Whether to destroy their
Property by taking away the twentieth part of their Estates from them, and by
the same Arbitrary Power to refer to four standers by of their own Faction to
judge what that twentieth part is, be to defend the lawful Rights and
Liberties of the Subject? And if they think these Actions to be instances of
either, whether they do not know the Persons before named to be guilty of them
all? Or whether they think it possible that Almighty God can bless that City
and preserve it from destruction, whilst persons of such known guilt and
wickedness are defended and justified amongst them against the power of that
Law, by which they can only subsist?

His Majesty is so far from suffering Himself to be incensed against the whole
City, by the Actions of these ill men, though they have hitherto been so
prevalent, as to make the Affections of the rest of little use to Him; And is
so willing to be with them, and to protect them, that the Trade, Wealth, and
Glory thereof (so decayed and ecclipsed by these public Distractions) may
again be the envy of all foreign Nations, That He does once more graciously
offer His free and general Pardon to all the Inhabitants of that His City of
London, the Suburbs, and City of Westminster (except the Persons formerly
excepted by His Majesty) if they shall yet return to their Duty, Loyalty, and
Obedience. And if His good Subjects of that His City of London shall first
solemnly declare, That they will defend The known Laws of the Land, and will
submit to, and be governed by no other Rule; If they shall first manifest, by
defending themselves, and maintaining their own Rights, Liberties, and
Interests, and suppressing any Force and Violence unlawfully raised against
those and His Majesty, their Power to defend and preserve Him from all
Tumults. Affronts and Violence: Lastly, if they shall apprehend and commit to
safe custody the Persons of those four men, who enrich themselves by the Spoil
and Oppression of His loving Subjects, and the ruin of the City, that His
Majesty may proceed against them by the course of Law, as guilty of high
Treason, His Majesty will speedily return to them with His Royal, and without
His Martial Attendance, and will use His utmost endeavor that they may
hereafter enjoy all the blessings of Peace and Plenty, and will no longer
expect Obedience from them, then He shall with all the Faculties of His Soul
labor in the preserving and advancing The true reformed Protestant Religion;
The Laws of the Land; The Liberty and Propriety of the Subject; and The just
Privileges of Parliament.

If, notwithstanding all this, the Art and Interest of these men can prevail so
far, That they involve more men in their guilt, and draw that His City to
sacrifice its present Happiness, and future Hopes to their Pride, Fury and
Malice, His Majesty shall only give them this warning, That whosoever shall
henceforward take up Arms without His consent, Contribute any Money or Plate,
upon what pretense of Authority soever, for maintenance of the Army under the
command of the Earl of Essex, or any other Army in Rebellion against Him; or
shall pay Tonnage and Poundage, till the same shall be settled by Act of
Parliament, every such person must expect the severest punishment the Law can
inflict, and in the mean time. His Majesty shall seize upon any part of His
estate within His power, for the Relief and Support of Him and His Army, raised
and maintained for the Defense of His Person, the Laws, and this His Kingdom:
And since he denies to His Majesty the duty and benefit of His subjection, by
giving assistance to the Rebels, which by the known Laws of the Land is high
Treason, His Majesty shall likewise deny him the benefit of his Protection,
and shall not only signify to all His foreign Ministers, That such person
shall receive no advantage by being His Subject, but shall by all other ways
and means proceed against him as a public enemy to His Majesty and this
Kingdom.

But His Majesty hopes, and doubts not but His good Subjects of London will
call to mind the Acts of their Predecessors, their Duty, Affection, Loyalty,
and Merit toward their Princes, the Renown they have had with all Posterity
for, and the Blessings of Heaven which always accompanied those Virtues, and
will consider the perpetual scorn and Infamy which unavoydably will follow
them and their children, if infinitely the meaner part in quality, and much the
lesser part in number shall be able to alter the Government so admirably
established, Destroy the Trade so excellently settled, And to waste the Wealth
so industriously gotten of that flourishing City: And then they will easily
gather up the courage and resolution to join with His Majesty in defense of
that Religion, Law, and Liberty which hitherto has, and only can make
themselves, His Majesty, and this Kingdom happy.

For concurring with the Advice of His two Houses of Parliament, which with
reference to the Commonwealth may be as well at this distance, as by being at
Whitehall, His Majesty doubts not but His good Subjects of London well know
how far (beyond the example of any of His Predecessors) His Majesty has
concurred with their Advice in passing of such Laws, by which He willingly
parted with many of His known Rights, for the benefit of His Subjects, which
the Fundamental Constitutions of this Kingdom did not oblige Him to consent
unto, and has used all possible means to beget a right understanding between
them, And will therefore apply themselves to those, who by making Just,
Peaceable, and Honorable Propositions to His Majesty can only beget that
Concurrence.

FINIS.
