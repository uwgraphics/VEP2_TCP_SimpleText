TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL John Fowke, Alderman of the Ward of FARRINGTON within,
To the Deputy, Common-counsell, and to the rest of the Inhabitants of the
aforesaid Ward.
The humble Petition of Joseph Hunscot Citizen and Stationer of LONDON:
Humbly shows,
WHereas by the late death of Thomas Nichols, the Beadles place of the Ward
aforesaid is become void, and your Petitioner having lived these forty years
and upwards in the said Ward, and borne all Offices in his Parish where he
lived, and has from time to time manifested his good affection to the service
of the Parliament, not only in paying of Taxes and Assesments imposed on him,
but before did voluntarily carry in a horse, moneys, and in person with his
son and three servants actually served the Parliament, to the loss both of
the benefit of his servants times, and also of his trade; And since has
printed several Books by the direction of the Parliament, which amounts to a
good value, for all which he has had no satisfaction. The premises considered,

Your Petitioner humbly prays your Worships and the rest of the said Ward, to
grant him your favors and furtherance to be the Beadle for the Ward in the
room of the said Mr. Nichols deceased; in discharge whereof he promises all
faithfulness and diligence both to your Worships and the Ward; And as in duty
bound,

Your Petitioner shall ever pray, etc. And your Petitioner will undertake to
discharge the Inhabitants of the said Ward from all other Taxes levied upon the
said Ward, for and toward the Beadles Salery, and to maintain a sufficient
Watch according to the ancient custom.
