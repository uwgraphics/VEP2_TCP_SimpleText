THE Devonshire Boys Courage AND Loyalty to Their Majesty's King WILLIAM and
Queen MARY; in defending their Country from the Invasion of the French.
To (...)Excellent New Tune; called The Devonshire Boys delight* Or, The Lggan
waters, etc.


BRave Devonshire Boys made haste away,
When Few did come from Tinmouth-bay,
The French were Landed in that Town*
And Treacherously had burnt it down.
When to the Town they did draw near*
The French did streightways disappear;
Because that they had then beat down.
(...)basely ^^^^e poor Tinmouth Town.
(...) Halden-Hill they did design,
(...) draw their (...)in a Line*
^^t Devonshire (...) did make them run*
^
Brave Blew-Coat Boys did watch them so,
They to no other place dare go;
For if they had returned again.
I Am sure the Frenchmen had been slain.
They for their coming do prepair,
In Devonshire, if to Land they dare;
Never doubt their Courage they will pull ^own,
For burning of poor Tinmouth Town.
The French they will show an English Dance,
E're they again return to France;
They wont forget their beating down.
(...) burning of poor Tinmouth Town.


Let Monsieur then do what he can.
We'll still Rei^n Masters over the Main;
Old Englands Right upon the ^ea,
In spite of France maintained shall be.
No Seaman fears to lose his Blood,
To justify a cause so good;
To fight the French* who have begun
With burning of poor Tinmouth Town.
The Cornish Lads will lend a hand.
And Devonshire Boys will with them Band,
To pull the pride of Mons^eur down.
Who basely burned poor Tinmouth Town.
To our most Gracious King and Queen,
Their Loyalty it shall be seen;
With heart and hand they bow to fight,
For to maintain King William's Right.
I wish such Loyal hearts be found,
In all the Counties England Round;
Then let the Frenchmen us approach,
Their Brandy Vessels we will broach.
We hope our Fleet will prove most just,
In not betraying of their Trust.
Then the French shall pay full sore,
For Trespassing on our English-shore.
If in ou^ h^nds they once do fall,
They certainly shall pay for all,
The D^mage done, in beating down.
And burning of poor Tinmouth Town.
Dutchmen of War they will us meet,
For to complete our Royal Fleet;
Which being done they will advance,
For to pull down the pride of France.
Let Us pray kind Heaven for to bless,
Our Gra^ious King with good success
Then we shall all right happy be,
For to Enjoy our Liberty.
We will a^^^nce King William's fame,
And add new Glorys to his name,
The hawghty Monsieur we will pluck down,
For to advance Old Englands Crown.
Now England is so powerful grown,
Poor Monsieur Totters in his Throne,
Brave Fors with Courage let us proceed,
No Englishman will fear to bleed.
Th^n let proud Frenchmen all bewail,
That E're they did to England Sail,
Not words but blows shall make it not*
When we with them have 'tother b^^t*
