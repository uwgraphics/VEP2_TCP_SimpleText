IRELANDS Complaint of the Armies hypocrisy. With his Excellencies entering
unconquered LONDON: In a Discourse between two friends Donatus and Perigrin.
With the slighting of the Communicable Line.
Donat. WEll met friend Perigrin, from whence came thou,

Perig. From wretched Ireland, I landed now;

Donat. How stands the state of that distressed Nation,

Perig. It Is almost lost, a powerful inundation
Has overwhelmed it in a Sea of woe?
And I am hither come to let you know
How much they thank you for each fast and prayer
In their behalf, if they could live by air
Without the help of money or of men,
They would requite your breath with breath again.

Donat. We have been ever ready to relieve them
In words not having other aid to give them.

Perig. It Is true indeed, but give me leave to tell ye
Words are to weak to fill an empty belly

Donat. We meant our Army should their loss restore

Perig. When the Steed's stolen, you will shut the stable door.

Donat. The trumpet sounds, stand by my friend here is one,
Whose conquest must through London streets be known.

Perig. Who Is this that comes in triumph, is the war

Donat. Now finished. It Is that famous Conqueror
Sir Thomas Fairfax, Whose victorious hand
Makes England stoop to his supreme command,

Perig. Is he a King or Pope, or can there be
Another that dares own supremacy,

Donat. He is neither King nor Pope, yet he is one
That alters government, pulls Bishops down,
And Elders to, the hated Presbyters,
Seem now as odious as the Bishops were.
He sets up a new light which does arise
Beyond the apprehension of weak eyes
For these are a peculiar people grown,
A real Priesthood, these are they alone
Which are of all believers, truly sainted
And every preaching soldier is acquainted
With Jesus Christ, who offers grace to all
Yet none may come unless the Father call,
Who fills them with the Spirit in such measure
That they may fall, and rise at their own pleasure.
Repentance is a superstitious thing
And it is as frivolous to have a King,
One musters legions of foul crimes within
And makes discovery of each secret sin:
The other does not bear the sword in vain
Whereby he should his Regal power maintain,
It was not given him to be a scourge
To good men, but the wicked land to purge
From cruel humors, which they understand
Who wrested it by force out of his hand,
Not knowing who resists power shall
Procure themselves damnation sad withal,
The Kings word is with power, then who may
Tax him with what he please to do or say:
Suppose the King were wicked is it fit
To tell him so, Gods Word does not permit
Such insolence, but does enforce us rather
To yield obedience to our Kingly Father
But now that holy Writ is of no force,
Our government is changed from bad to worse.

Perig. Pray what became of that strict Covenant,
Betwixt the Brethren and your Parliament.

Donat. (Alas) they made so many Oaths before,
And broke them all, it is but one trespass more,
They Will add yet to the former, for where sin
Abounds most, there grace must needs begin,

Perig. But do your Londoners not blush to see
A plain discovery of their perjury.
How shall a stranger trust their word or oath
When for advantage they will forfet both?

Donat. Know they have trusted in so many gods,
Which in the end will prove revengfull rods
For whosoever does too much rely
One any humane help, does deifie
The means, wherein they trust to find redress,
Sees none but God can free us in distress:
Poor England was oppressed, and therefore went
To seek deliverance in a Parliament
The which pretended a true Reformation;
Which was begun with a deep Protestation:
But Oaths are words, and words are all but wind,
Soon after they themselves in Covenant bind,
To aid the Parliament against their King;
And to that end they Plate and Money bring
Wherewith great Forts and Bulworks were erected
The whilst poor Ireland was quite neglected,
The tithe of what they one their Rampires spend
Might free some thousand wretched souls, and end
Their cruel sufferings, but it is too late,
Pray God their fall prove not proud Englands fate.

Perig. But when this conquering Army had subdude,
The King and that malignant multitude,
They might have gone and set that Nation free,
And there be crowned with glorious victory.

Donat. Why, these are they, which are our faiths directors,
To seek out Heaven, these are our Kings protectors.
Whose meaning is to fix him on his Throne,
In time, but first they will be paid their own
Areares, nor do they purpose to disband
Whilst all the Law remains in their hand,
The States are as unwilling to restore
The power they have usurped six years or more,
Besides some inward guilt does whisper this
And tells them they have done some things amiss,
And if they should be lesser, then they are
There is a retribution day I fear,
Wherein they shall be summoned to make good
By satisfaction those sad streams of blood
The which by their commission was exhausted,
And those huge sums of money vainly wasted,
The Londoners have now the only cause,
(Who must be subject to new Lords, new Laws)
To fetch their King, but they were overruled,
And now begin to fear they have been fooled
Betwixt Sir Thomas, and the Parliament;
Nor do they now their doings well resent.
The Forts and Guards are in the Amies power,
And so is the Militia and the Tower:
And yet the King remayns no better still
Then a poor prisoner to the Armies will.
And thus we see no comfort can be given
But what proceeds from the great King of Heaven,
Who does man's extremity foresee,
By which he works his opportunity:
And will I hope, when things are at the worst,
Restore them better then they were at first.

Nulla dies sine linea. Or the Slighting of the Works.
ANd must the hedge be pulled down?
Of this blessed Reformation?
And may the Maids to Islington,
Pass free without invasion?
Now (Noddles) to your Cells again
Breeds vermin to be idle:
Black Tom will teach you another strain,
He Will make you champe the bridle.
And hey let us sing, and the bells merry ring
The King of the Line is abolisht
Edwards is sped, the Birds they are fled
The Cage must be demolisht.
Home Sutlers to your holes again
Pack to your nasty allies:
Your Summer-houses long enough
You'ue had, go try your talleys.
The Excize-man frighted quite away,
Butchers you need not prize them;
You need not lift sheep over the Works,
For fear they should Excize them.
And hey?
Manwring is fast enough in hold,
A sad and true presagement
That against the old decrepit Line
There was some strong engagement.
You Citizens you need not fear
While you are in your quarter:
Your Journeymen should ware for ware
With your Madonna's barter.
And hey let us sing, and the Bells merry ring,
The King of the Line is abolisht:
Edward is sped, the Birds they are fled,
The Cage must be demolisht.
FINIS.
