LONDON, Printed by A. W. for Giles Calvert at the Black-spread-Eagle at the
West end of Paul's, 1659.

To the Parliament of England, from many thousands of the free people of this
Commonwealth.
HAving for several years, and especially since the time of your interruption
been exercised under many and great oppressions, because for conscience sake
we cannot pay tithes; Some of us suffering in the body, by months, and years
Imprisonments, and some till death: others in our estates by chargeable suites,
fynes, judgments and unreasonable distresses, to the ruin of families, and
been made the subjects of almost all manner of cruelty and injustice; we have
stood single and in the integrity of our hearts been preserved from worldly
compliance; waiting for the good day; that the Lord would remove the hand of
the oppressor.

And now finding freedom in the Lord, we come before you, whom God has
brought together again, and put the power into your hands, who formerly and of
late have declared, to ease the heavy burden, to remove the yoke of injustice,
and to set the oppressed free, and as members of the Nation to make our claim
to that just right which belonges to us as men and Christians, who for the most
part have been Instruments with others for the purchase of our Libertys; that
we may noe longer be made a prey by wicked men, and unjust Laws, as we have
been.

It cannot be forgotten what great things the Lord of late has done in this
Nation, how he has set up and thrown down, shaken and overturned, and done
wonderful things, to the astonishment of our selves and all people round
about us; and how the Lord in the midst of all our war and confusions still
caused a light to shine, which guided in a hidden path, and led to that which
was not in the mind to forethink, nor in the heart to intend, and carried far
beyond that which was seen; yea, every year outwent other, and as great things
were done, still greater were expected, and the hearts of the upright were
filled with joy, and a righteous Kingdom was looked for to be near.

But on a sudden, when God gave outward rest from war and trouble, (which were
true sigures of another work which was to come after, and to be passed thorough
before the Kingdom) how soon did a wrong Principle arise and step into the
throne, usurping that dominion which the Lord was about to take to himself,
which clouded the Nation with darkness, and drew a veil over the minds of
most; And only to a remnant did the Lord show his Salvation, whom he obscured
under sorrow and suffering, which now unto you are made manifest.

In this day of backsliding from God, how have men turned aside, changed their
minds, and even denied their own professed principles; and how are all men now
wandering in the dark, and groping at Noonday; Some crying out to the
Magistrate, suppress Errors, heresies, blasphemies; Others crying, take care
of the Ministry, and keep up tithes, for if tithes be taken away, the Ministry
will fall; And how is the Magistrate himself pleading for both, and saying that
tithes are due by law, and belonges to him, and he may dispose of them as he
please, by which means the poor are oppressed who are laboring in the ground
and tilling the earth for bread, the staff and stay of the Nation; A carnal
worldly Ministry is thereby maintained, and the consciences of many thousands
of good people oppressed.

Alas, alas, Is this our rest and the end of our work, and is this the
Reformation that must be the price of so much blood? To set the Magistrate in
Christ's throne to try and judge who are fit to be his Ministers, and to send
out and restrain whom he thinks fit, and to force a maintenance for them, even
from those that for conscience sake cannot hear them, nor own them; But for
Christ's sake to whom the Kingdom belongs, are made to testify against both
Magistrate and Minister as intruders into Christ's place; Is this the liberty
and the favor that tender consciences must expect, who are separated from the
profane societies of the world, both to maintain their own Ministers, and to
be forced to maintain others for the World, such as they know Christ never
sent? Or is this kindness to the World, who might be supplied by the Churches
of Christ, with such as would freely preach the Gospel without money or price.

And for your tithes, do we not know, that in the dark night of Apostasy they
came in since the days of the Apostles, and were set up by the Pope, and
first fruits and tenths in imitation of the Jewish maintenance, and were they
not upheld by popish laws, and ordered in the Ecclesiastical Courts? and did
ever any Magistrate in this Nation meddle or had any thing to do about tithes
till the Abbyes were dissolved, that he sold them to lay persons (so called)
who could not recover them by ecclesiastical law; And does not the first
statute law that ever was made for them in H. 8. time, say they were due to God
and holy Church? and do not your own laws appoint them to be tried in the
ecclesiastical Courts? And because the Pope imposed so heavy a burden, which
your temporal laws made in the darkness of former ages, does continue; Is it
therefore just that they be perpetuated, and made an everlasting bondage? How
soon might this Nation be established in peace by leaving every one free to
have and hear and maintain their own Ministers; which is a just freedom
belonging to all, and we desire not it should be limited to any; and herein we
do to every man as we would be done unto, knowing that every one must give an
account of himself unto God; And the Magistrate, (though now he be setting up
Ministers and forcing maintenance) will in that day find, that he has cumbered
himself with that which the Lord never required from him, and will be rebuked
for his zeal without knowledge by Christ Jesus, to whom all power in heaven
and earth is given, who needs not the Magistrates help to provide him
Ministers or Maintenance.

We therefore in the feeling and sense of the weight of this burden upon the
Nation, and of the depth and strength of deceit that lies therein: In humility
as Christians, and in faithfulness, as becomes those that wish well to you,
and the great people under your care; do exhort, that you would in wisdom,
and in the fear of God, with all convenient speed declare a just freedom in
things pertaining unto God to all the people of this Commonwealth, that
tithes, forced maintenances and all other burdens on the conscience may be
removed, and Christ's Kingdom delivered up to himself; And that you will govern
the outward man with that law which is just and perfect according to the law of
God, and that in every man's conscience, and then your rule will be established
in righteousness; But if you meddle as you did of old with that which
concerns the conscience, or as those did more lately, whom God has removed;
be assured a controversy will the Lord have with you, for he will overturn,
till Christ Jesus be exalted over the conscience as King and Lord; And as we
have stood single unto God in a day of hard trial; and borne the heat and the
storms and the tempests; We are willing, yet more to endure, and not only with
joy to suffer our goods to be spoiled, and our bodies to be imprisoned, but
also our lives to lay down, if the Lord shall require it, till our testimony be
finished against all these abominations, and for the Lord, and for Christ
Jesus whom we witness to be come in the flesh, and in the spirit, who is to
continue for ever the unchangeable Preisthood, made and upheld, not by the
power of an outward law or carnal Commandment, but by the power of an endless
life; and a law that cannot be altered; He it is that has changed the first
Preisthood, and the law also by which it was made, and disanulled the
Commandment that gave tithes, and so has taken away the first, that he might
establish the second, (to wit) that which is in the spirit, which is the gift
of God, which is free without money or price: And we having received this
Ministry, and being made partakers of his gift which is free, as we have
freely received, freely we declare, as the Ministers of Christ ever did,
without being burdensome to any; And vvoe unto them that make the gospel
chargeable, it being the free gospel of peace, unto all Nations, not of
discord and strife, as the Ministry of the world, their gospel and
maintenance is, as witness all the Courts of this Nation.

As you do herein, so will you be established.

FINIS.
