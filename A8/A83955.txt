ENGLANDS DIRECTIONS FOR MEMBERS ELECTIONS
DEar Country men, you that resolve to do good
to your Country, and stop the vast Ocean of Blood,
That of late has been shed,
Through the loss of our Head,
By that Pocky perfidious Bum.
Now, now is the time when you make your new choices,
Of Parliament men: have a care of your voices,
Make none had their hands,
In Church Livings or Lands.
Lay by Omne quod exit in um.
Set a black mark upon whimsical Vane,
And dunstical Disborow now in his wane,
Choose neither Sir Arthur,
Rumper nor Farter.
No Friend of the sh -- ars'd Bum.
Post up the names of down-fallen Dick,
And Lambert that served the Rump that bold trick,
Let Luke go to Pot,
And his brother Tom Scot.
Kick out Omne quod exit in um.
If brasen-fac'd Bradshaw breath on this side of Hell,
('It Is wonder since Lucifer long ago fell)
Hiss him out of this Isle
With his Comrade Jack Lisle,
And every bit of the Bum.
Forget not the merits of Hewson the high born;
But send him with Lilburn and Tichburn to Tiburn.
Give impudent Goffe
An handsome turn off,
With Omne quod exit in um.
Let Ingoldsby, Clement, and Okey have right,
That is a good halter: Lord Whitlock good night
To your Lordship, your sun
Its full course has run,
And has left you as well as the Bum.
Choose not Charl's Fleetwit, yet pity his case,
For you know how the Lord did spit in his face;
But if Edwards or White
Stand, bid them goesh --
With Omne quod exit in um.
If rotten Harry Martin your voices require.
Bid him go stand in Smockingham shire,
Or Middlesex County,
They out of their bounty
May dub him the Knight of their Bum.
But if Carew, or Corbet, or Ludlow endeavor,
Roe, or Ewer, deny those Traitors all favor,
As worthy no less
Than eternal distress
With Omne quod exit in um.
Waller and Harrison, VVhaly, Will. Say,
Danvers and Stapley, Maleverer and Gray.
If they dare show their face,
Hisse'um out with difgrace,
With all that stink of the Bum.
Chaloner, Downs, VVayt, Purefoy and Ven,
Moor, Barkstead and Blackstone those Monsters of men
To Hell make'um ride
After Colonel Pride,
With Omne quod exit in um.
If Alured seeks your favor to gain,
Jones or Millington tell 'um they labor in vain,
Cause as swine do on Pearls
They trampled on Charles,
With the rest of their fellows the Bum.
If Norton, or Horton, or Harvy shall dare,
If Dandy, or Cook, or Ash shall appear,
Pray pack 'um to Nell
To tell 'um the fall
Of Omne quod ezit in um.
If that you be counted by Peregrine Pelham,
Hurchinson, Cawly, Or Constable, tell 'um,
They all had theit hands
In the Kings life or lands,
And there fore you will tickle their Bum.
If Walton approach your Elections, or Love,
They were of the Giants that fought against Jove,
And therefore tell them and Potter,
You hope they will all totter.
With Omne quod exit in um.
Jack Bourchier, Hammond and Garland those arrant
Traitors all signed that fatal warrant,
And with them Mr. Meyn,
That Rebel in grain.
Advancers all of the Bum.
Michael Livesy and Dixwel next come in our way,
Whose Merits do cry aloud for their pay,
Pray give them and Scroop,
A good hempen Rope,
With Omne quod exit in um.
Smith, Henningham, Alderman Isack and Dean,
All Acted a part in that Tragical scene,
So VVogan and Rowt.
Let 'nm all face about.
Grand Patrons all of the Bum.
Add the Temples, strange they should be foes to the Church
With Blagrave and Mildemay, leave'um all in the lurch,
Or rather send 'um to trudge,
To the Reprobates Judge.
With Omne quod exit in um.
