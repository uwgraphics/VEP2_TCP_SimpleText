THE Fiery darts of the Devil quenched; OR, Something in Answer to a Book
called, a Second Beacon fired, presented to the Lord PROTECTOR, and the
Parliament, and subscribed by Luke Fawn, John Rothwel, Samuel Gellibrand,
Thomas Underhill, Joshua Kirton, Nathaniel Web. Wherein, their lies and slanders
are made manifest against the innocent, and those books which have been
published by them they call Quakers, owned and vindicated, and all the rest
which is in that book disowned, and their deceit laid open; how they have
perverted the truth and our words in those books which they cry out of as
blasphemy, that the truth may not suffer under the reproach of the Heathen. By
one who is a witness for the truth against Gog and Magog, called after the
flesh, FRANCIS HOWGIL.

Also something in answer to a book called a voice from the Word of the Lord,
by one John Griffith, against us, whom the world calls Quakers, wherein his
false accusations is denied, and he proved to be a slanderer, and the truth
cleared from his Scandals. By one who is a witness against the deceits of the
world, called Edward Borough.

London, Printed for Giles Calvert, at the blackspread Eagle at the West end of
Paul's. 1654.

FIrst of all you go about and flatter the powers and the Magistrates, and
tells them they ought to have a care of their peoples souls in keeping them
from infection of idolatry and blasphemy, and you say you are to inform them
of the dangerousnesse of great meeting in London of Quakers, whose opinions are
blasphemous, Paganish, Antiscriptural and Antichristian, even as the former.
And further, the greatest thing that troubles you, is Printing and publishing
books many thousands, you say, concerning blasphemous and heretical, and
antimagistratical opinions tending to unchristian people, and disorder the
people of the Nations, and to bring in paganism, and libertinisme, and this
you say you present unto them to provoke their zeal against them.

Oh you blood thirsty minded men, all the care that you would have the
Magistrates to take of the people is to destroy them, and to have them shut up
in holes and caves, and dens, and prisons, and the truth ever suffered by your
generation, and your generation has ever pressed the Magistrates that they
might abuse their power, and if they will but hearken to you, instead of
healing the people, they will be destroyers* and in stead of making up
breaches, they will make desolate, and so you would drive them on hastily to
satisfy your corrupt will, and to uphold your Diana, and your craft, that you
may make merchandise of that which has been long enough sold and printed by
you; and what has it done? who is turned from darkness to light? and you that
makes a trade of others writings and words, to maintain you in your lusts, and
deceive, this you would have them to uphold; but as for the care of peoples
souls, its far enough from you, and all along your filthy lying slanderous
book, you are made manifest to be of those that would have fire to come down
from heaven in your wills to destroy all those that withstand you and your
imaginations. And therefore let all magistrates in whom the fear of the Lord is,
take heed how they take things from the hands and mouths of them who has
always persecuted the power of truth, and called truth error, and light
darkness, and darkness light; and in a blind zeal for God, destroy them whom
the power of the Lord is manifest in; for so Paul persecuted Christ, and the
Saints, and so the Jews crucified Christ, and all the Saints have suffered.
And you are offended at our meeting in London, while we have been here in the
City we have not been in a corner, and we challenge you and all the City in
the name of the Lord, who is dreadful to all liers, and slanderers, to show
what are those blasphemies that you speak of, you backbiters shall have your
portion with the rest of hypocrites: opinions we deny, for the light of Jesus
Christ which is spiritual which appears and declares against all sects, and
opinions, and blasphemies, and all you who hates it, are in contention, and in
opinions, and blaspheme the truth; and here I charge it upon you in the
presence of the living God, that you are blasphemers who calls the light
natural and paganism; and the Lord will plead with you, you filthy corrupt
minds, who calls the light of Christ. Antichristian, for here in the presence
of the Lord of hosts* I speak it, no other light do we own to walk by, but
that which is spiritual and eternal, the light of Christ, which he has
enlightened every one that comes into the world withal; and this is not
Anti-scriptural as thou calls it; for the Scriptures witness the same, and
Christ bears witness of it, and no other light do we own but the same that ever
was, which was in the beginning, and which convinces the world of sin, and the
same that led up the Saints to know the Father and the Son: and you that call
this paganism and heretical, and blasphemous, and Antichristian, let all who
have any light in them judge, and let shame cover your faces, and fear take hold
upon you, for your words stink, and come out of the mouth of the dragon; ye
filthy unclean frogs, which has poison under your tongues* And as for the
books which we have Printed, we own them, and are ready to lay down our
lives for the testimony of Jesus, and the truth of them, and seal them with
our blood, and what are written in them, through the eternal power of God,
which is made manifest, and that we have published any thing against any just
Magistracy, let all our writings, and all who read them judge; and if bearing
witness to Jesus Christ unchristians people, let all judge; for no other do
we own, but the same Christ to day and yesterday, and for ever; and here all
your petitioning is made manifest, from whence it did arise and proceed, and
your shame and nakedness, and envy appears.

And the Sacraments which you say you use, which is appointed in the Scripture,
and Farnworth in Answer to a petition did deny them.

Answer, His answer we own; and I challenge you to be perverters of the
Scripture; where read you of Sacraments in the Scripture? here I charge you to
be liers and slanderers, and deniers of the Scripture, and adders to it, and
the plagues shall be added to you; and as for that which you use among you is
traditional and imitatory. Yet the bread which we break is the Communion of
the body of Christ, and the cup we drink is the Communion of the blood of
Christ, and this is that which Paul received from him: and Baptism by one
spirit into one body we own; the baptism is but one, and this we own, and
here you liers and slanderers are seen and denied.

Another thing you call heresy and blasphemy, is, that we say that Christ
has enlightened all men; but I shall lay down your own words, and prove you
liers out of that book called the General good to all people: and you say the
light of God that is in all men, that is to wit, natural conscience, that it is
sufficient, if we give heed unto it, to discover sin, and and turn our
minds toward God, and that this light within, is the grace of God, and that it
is Christ in us.

Answer, Let all that reads that book, see if you be not liers and
slanderers, and perverters, and are in the generation of those false witnesses
which bore witness against Christ; and here I charge you to be liers. Where in
all the bookdoth he say that the light of a natural conscience is sufficient to
guide to God, if it be taken heed to? or where does it say it discovers sin?
there is another lie: and where does he say that natural conscience is the
grace of God? there is a third lie; and where does he say that natural
conscience is Christ in us? there is a fourth lie; be ashamed that ever you
should go and present so many filthy lies to authority that there is no truth
in at all. Oh* ye dark minds, would you be judging and prescribing what is
heresy and blasphemy, and calls the light of Christ paganism and heresy? but
I am bold in the Name of the Lord, to declare unto you, and unto all the world,
that Christ is the true light that has enlightened every one that comes into
the world, and that this light is spiritual, and not natural, and it convinces
of all sin; he shall convince the world of sin, and whosoever obey this light
which shines into the conscience, it leads up to Christ, and out of sin, and
it turns the mind toward God, and it shines in darkness; but you dark sottish
children know it not; yea, you that hate it, have it, and it shall condemn you,
and when the book of conscience shall be opened, you shall be judged for all
your hard speeches against the truth.

Another thing you present to be blasphemy and heresy, is that the worship
that is performed in England with those Ministers that sing David's Psalms,
baptize infants, wear double cuffes, boot hose tops, take tithes, say men shall
never be perfect in this world, and that say the letter is the light, and the
letter is the word; and that salvation is in the Scripture, and that calls
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the Gospel, are seducers, and no Ministers of the
word, but show forth the Spirit of error.

Answer. All those Ministers in England which abide not in the Doctrine of
Christ* all those worshippers and worships which is contrary to the Scripture
are Heathenish, and they worship they know not what; and all such worship is an
abomination to the true God; and I charge you and all those that would be
counted Ministers in England, to prove from the Scripture where the Saints sung
David's conditions, and Psalms in rimes and meter; and where is there any
Scripture for baptizing of Infants* and whether any of the Ministers of Christ
lived in pride and lusts of the flesh, and where any Ministers of Christ took
tithes, which belonged to the first Priesthod and the first covenant; and so
they that uphold the first, deny the second, and the one everlasting offering
which perfects for ever them that are sanctified; and where does the Scripture
say that the letter is the word and the light? but it witnesses against you and
says, God is the word, and Christ is the light, and Christ is the Gospel, yea
the everlasting Gospel; and Matthew, Mark, Luke and John declared of him: and
hear be you a witness against your self, ye dark minded men: and I charge you
that you deny the Scripture; and all those who upholds those things are in the
heathenish nature, without God in the world, in the earth where the Divil dwells
who is an accuser of the Brethren: and does not the Scripture and they declare
it who were Ministers of Christ, that there were that ran after the error of
Balaam, and their hearts was exercised with covetous practices? and were there
not such that was raylers, and false accusers, and blind watchmen, and greedy
dumb dogs, and such as sought for their gain from their quarter, and such as
lead into wichcraft, and Antichrists, deceivers? you might as well have called
Christ, and Paul and Peter and Jude Blasphemers and Heretics; but you are made
manifest just to be them and in the same nature that called Christ a
blasphemer, and Paul a pestilent fellow, and a setter forth of strange Gods,
and the Ministers of Christ seditious; and thou might as well say Christ
despised a Governor when he called Herod a fox; and now blessed be the Lord the
hour of his Judgments is come: and we freely declare against all deceit both
in Magistrates, Priests and people as they did that wrote forth the Scripture,
and bear witness to his name as they did, in our measure, and we have
suffered and do suffer daily by slanderous tongues, such as you have; and
imprisonments, and cruel mockings, and stripes, and bonds, and can truly say to
the praise of his name, we bear in our bodies the marks of the Lord Jesus;
but we must pass through good report and evil report, and it is our Crown and
rejoicing to suffer for his name; and now Gog and Magog and all the powers of
the earth bends themselves and are angry, even the nations that profess Christ
in words, and say the Scripture is their rule, but walk not according to it;
and against all such hypocrisy are we witnesses, to the fulfilling our
testimony, and the laying down of our lives, that he alone may be honored who
sits upon the throne of David, and of whose Government there is no end, to whom
be praise for ever, who shall break all your combinations and plots, and you
shall be ground to powder who set your selves against him, and be dashed to
pieces as a Potters vessel.

And now to that which you call Antimagistratical errors, that the magistrates
are not to have titles of worshipful or right worshipful, and that the Subjects
of a Common Wealth which is not Isreal's Common wealth are to be disturbed, and
that no civil Government is to be acknowledged but the government of the Law
within us.

Answer. Where reads thou or any, that any Magistrate was called worshipful or
right worshipful, or ever any of the Saints of God did so? he that is
righteousness and truth, unto whom all honor and worship belongs, God blessed
for ever, we own and worship, he is no respecter of persons. And you filty
flaterers who are in the curse, respect men's persons, and so you are rased out
for ever from the faith of Christ, and from the faith which all the holy men of
God lived in, that you know it not: but you false accusers, Magistrates we
know, and they are for the punishment of evil doers and for the lawless, for
liers and slanderers, such as you are, and for the praise of them that do well,
and we honor such in our hearts, and obeys their just commands; and are not
like him that said he would go and went not, but are subject for conscience
sake to the powers that are of ^od, and are subject to every ordinance of man
for the Lords sake; but we cannot flatter nor respect men's persons and deny the
faith of Christ, but are brought from under the power of unrighteousness by
the mighty power of God, and are subject to all just laws which stand not, nor
were made in man's will, but obeys them for consciences sake, and if any Law
which is not just nor equal be required upon us that we cannot do; we suffer
for conscience sake, and resist not at all, as many of our enemies will
witness for us; and therefore you false accusers be silent; they that are
subject to Isreal's Commonwealth are righteous, and walks in righteousness, in
that which is just, good and holy; and we witness against all the Canaanites
who walk in unrighteousness, and all who are enemies to the Commonwealth of
Israel must be broken to pieces, and them that strive and contend against the
faith which was once delivered to the Saints, and is now witnessed, praised be
the Lord, all such must be disturbed and broken to pieces by the just, even all
the unjust shall be broken; and as for that which thou say we say, we ought
not to be subject to any civil Government but that which is within us, oh thou
liar, when will thou cease thy lying? where is that? I charge thee to prove
where that is spoken: yet this I say unto all, Moses received the Law from the
mouth of the Lord, and it was revealed to him, and in him, and then he wrote it
without and was subject to it, and all who makes Laws now and do not receive
them from God, they make them in their own wills, and such as do act contrary
to the Law of God; but that Law which is righteous, which is according to that
in the conscience, which is holy and good and civil, we are subject both within
and without to it: and all you your subjection which is not from a principle
within, is not in truth not singleness of heart, but with flattery, and your
eye service and your bowing down in hypocrisy and saying you are subject when
there is no truth in the heart, and so you are not subject for conscience sake.

And further, you say in Farnworth general good to all people, let every soul
be subject to the higher Powers, By powers is meant God, the Father of Jesus
Christ, and by King the Lord of Hosts, and that is another Blasphemy.

Woe unto filthy liars; I challenge you that you have perverted his words, and
would give meanings upon them as you do upon the Scriptures, and your own dark
sottish minds cannot comprehend, and therefore you give your own imaginations,
and then calls it Blasphemy; and let all that read that Book, see if you have
not belyed the truth, and perverted his words

Another thing you set down for Blasphemy, that none are ministers of God and
called by him who are sent forth by Authority of man, and that he that is not
infallible in his judgment, is no Minister of Christ.

Answer. You might have said Paul's words were Blasphemy; he was made a
Minister, not by men's will, and all the holy men of God, and apostles were not
Ministers by the will of man, but contrary to the will of man, and all who are
made Ministers of man, and by man, we deny, and the Scripture denies them, for
what they Preached, they neither received it of man nor from man, but by the
revelation of Jesus Christ; and all who have and are made Ministers by hear
say, and what they have formed up in their imaginations from the Scripture,
with their points, and their doctrins, which they raise in their carnal
minds, all such we declare against; and all such who abide not in the Doctrine
of Christ, and all who were made Ministers of Christ, were Spiritual and
infallible; that which is not infallible, is carnal: and all who are guided by
the Spirit of Christ is infallible, and they that are not guided by it are none
of his, nor the Sons of God, nor Ministers of Christ: and therefore, all that
such can judge of, is nothing but imaginary; and all you who have subscribed
this Book, and all such Ministers I deny. Ye shameless men, would you be
trying and perscribing, and set dowe what is Heresy, and Blasphemy; and cries
out of that for Heresy, and Blasphemy; which you should try with all? your
shame is laid open to all, and now your shame I hope will appear to the
Parliament, whom you Petition. What cry you out against books, and printing,
and blasphemy, that cannot distinguish a lamb from a dog? would you judge truth
by darkness? and you are offended that there are so many Quakers met in the
North parts lately, two thousand; yea blessed be the Lord, there are many
thousands that sees you, and never will bow to Baal, nor worship in the house
of Rimmon more; and many shall not only come from the North, but also from the
South, yea in London, that now sees all your deceit, and they shall enter, and
you shall be shut out. And what truth is this that cannot defend it self; and
what religion is that which cannot defend it self, but you must have all bend
to your image that you would set up?

And now unto you who are petitioned unto; I say, unto you, take heed and
beware how you call or suppress any thing as error, or how you meddle in the
prescribing God a way to walk in, for he cannot, he will not be limited: and I
say unto you, it were better a millstone were hanged about your necks, then to
hinder or stop, or make any law to hinder the passage of the truth which is
arising: and consider the Lord has thrown out all powers before this because
they would needs limit the Holy one of Israel, and prescribe him a way, and a
government how he should be worshipped, and many have suffered, and what has
all come to? all the rules that men has laid down, has they not been as the
untimely fruit of a woman and as corn upon the house top, and for that all
has been thrown down, and broken? and the jealousy of the Lord is broken
forth as fire, and and woe to them that withstands him in his way: and now I
say unto you, if you now prescribe God a way, and if that in the conscience
have not liberty, but you will go about to set bounds to him, and his people in
the worship of God, you shall be broken as a potters vessel, for the government
is upon his shoulders, and he will not give his glory to any other; the Lord
has spoken it. And for the rest of the books in the Beacon fired, we disowne
them; but I believe you have belied them, as you have done ours.

A Certain Book being come forth into the world, full of lies and slanders
against the innocent, called A voice from the word of the Lord, to those grand
impostors called Quakers; to the Author of which book (who calls himself J^hn
Griffith, a servant of Christ) and to all to whomsoever it may come, I am moved
to write something in Answer, that his lies and slanders, and false r^proaches
may be made manifest, and that he may proceed no further; for as Jannes and
Jambres withstood Moses, so does he resist the truth, being a man of a corrupt
mind, and reprobate concerning faith, and is not a Servant of Christ, nor a
witness for his name, but a child of disobedience, in whom the Prince of the
air rules.

And first to the title of thy book, I Answer, the word of the Lord is
powerful, and will cut thee down, thou sensual minded man; yet thou know not,
but takes the words of others declared from the word which was in them, and
thou uses thy tongue, and says the Lord says it; but I say unto thee, the
Lord has not spoken unto thee, neither commanded thee to speak of his name:
and I charge it upon thee in the presence of the Lord God of life, that thou
art of that generation which Jeremiah was sent to cry against, Jer. 23. 31. for
thou speaks thy imaginations upon their words which dwelt in the life of God*
but the life thou know not, and thy whole book is no more but an empty sound
and voice, and is as the untimely fruit of the womb which will wither and perish
away: and one of them I am whom thou calls Quakers, to whom thou say, thou
directs thy speech; but that we are grand impostors, I do deny, for we are
gathered up into the life which the holy men of God lived, and are fallen from
the world, and from its ways and nature: and I charge thee here to be a
slanderer, and from the mouth of the Lord I do declare unto thee that thou must
have a slanderers reward. And vvheras thou say thou have discovered their
fleshly and filthy mindedness, together with the judgments of God attending
them.

I Answer. Fleshly and filthy mindedness, we have denied by the Power of the
Son of God made manifest in us; thou have laid it to our charge, but thou
have not proved it nor discovered it, and here again thou art a false accuser;
fleshly and filthy mindedness shall stand for thy own condition; for there
thou art in the flesh and filth, living to thy vvil in the lust of uncleanesse,
for you may remember thou came out of the bowling Allie to our meeting, though
Pharisee like thy out side is painted and made clean, but thy heart is full of
enmity and lies, and slanders and false reproaches, to that in thy conscience I
do speak which shall for ever witness me, and as for the judgments of the
Lord upon thy own head will they fall, and with what measure thou metes it shall
be measured to thee again; we are passed from judgment, and from the
condemnation, and who art thou, thon enemy of righteousness, that shall lay any
thing to the charge of Gods elect? And whereas thou say thou art one that
bears witness against those wandering stars.

I answer, this shall stand for thy own condition, a wandering star thou art,
and has no habitation in the heaven, but speaks swelling words of vanity, thou
thy self being a servant of corruption, we have an abinding place, and an
habitation in the Lord, and are not wandering; and here again I charge thee to
be a false accuser, and a false witness, who bears witness of thy self; for
the Father bears no witness of thee, but against thee.

Whereas thou say the most high God that made the heavens and the earth, has
moved thee and stirred thee up to bear witness to the truth, and to witness
against the abmoinable fleshly mindedness, and yet spiritual pride of those
grand impostors called Quakers, by whose sorceries many are bewitched and drawn
from the simplicity of the gospel, to another gospel, which is not another
Gospel, but the vanity of their own minds, and their own fleshly and corrupt
thoughts which they cry up as Oracles of God. I answer* The most high God judge
between thee and us; whose wrath is kindled against thee* thou enemy of
righteousness, and child of wrath; thou have belied the Lord of heaven and
earth, for to this he moved thee not, for he moves none to utter lies and
slanders as thou have done, but the spirit of enmity and of the Divil has
moved thee, and to the truth thou bears no witness, but against the truth,
and against the innocent; and charges us with fleshly mindedness and
spiritual pride. O thou lier and false accuser, the Lord who takes our part
against thee will plead with thee, and render upon thy head according to thy
deeds; prove what thou speaks that we are fleshly minded and spiritually
proud, or else let thy mouth be stopped and shame cover thee for ever;
sorceries and witchcraft and drawing from the simplicity of the Gospel we do
deny; but the plain single truth we do declare, by which the eye of the
blind is opened in many to see your deceits who call your selves Churches and
Preachers of the Gospel; which is not the Gospel that the Apostles preached but
an adding your own Imaginations upon their words, who witnessed the Gospel, and
it shall stand for thy own condition, thou art in the sorcery and witchraft; who
draws people to observe an outward visible thing, from the light of Christ
within them; which leads to the simplicity of the Gospel, which is inward and
not outward; and thou art in thy fleshly and corrupt thoughts, crying up the
Ordinances and Oracles, of God, which are but carnal and beggarly rudiments of
the world, which passes away; and here thou art seen and made manifest in the
light of Christ, to be a hypocrite, who false accuses others of that which thou
art guilty of thy self; the same Gospel as ever was, do we declare; and not
another, which we received not from man, neither was taught it by man: and as
the Oracles of God it shall stand for ever for a witness against thee, and all
the world who does not believe, for even the Father bears witness of us, and
therefore our witness is true; and the righteous God will plead with thee thou
liar and false accuser, and here be a witness against thy self that the Lord
moved thee not, but the Divil, acting in thy own imaginations, and in the
vanity of thy one mind, and in thy one fleshly and corrupt thoughts; and
whereas thou say to us thou directs thy speech from the Lord, thus says the
Lord to thee O Quaker, thou art fleshly minded.

I answer, It is not the voice of the Lord to us that speaks in thee, but the
voice of the Divil, and the Serpent which speaks from thee: fleshly minded we
are not, but are redeemed out of it, and our minds are changed and are
Spiritual and it is the Spirit of the living God seals unto us and witnesses in
us, and here thou art of thy Father the old Dragon, an accuser of the
Brethren, but it is God that justifies, and who art thou that condemns? and
this thy speech is seen and comprehended, which thou have directed to us, and
it is judged by the spirit of true judgment to be a false accusation and a lie,
and not the word of the Lord, and into the lake amongst the false Prophets thou
art to be turned, who uses thy tongue when the Lord never spoke to thee; and
thou say we look upon the Institution of Christ's Supper with a fleshly and
carnal eye, because we say that the bread and wine which Christ commanded his
Disciples to eat and to drink, is carnal. I Answer. The bread, and wine, is
visible and carnal, and fleshly, and not Spiritual, nor Eternal, and in the
eternal light by the Spiritual eye of God opened in us, we see them and do
own that it was a command of Christ, to stand for its time, and no more, but a
carnal figure of a spiritual thing, and the spiritual thing being the substance
bearing witness, the figure is denied and declared against, and thou and thy
generation who art acting in those things by tradition tying and limiting God
to a visible thing (that without it no salvation) art in the sorcerie and
witchraft, and an enemy to the substance; for Christ never since he was
sacrifised brake of the bread or drank of the cup with his Disciples, but new
in his Fathers kingdom; and thou who art in the carnal figure acting those
things without the enjoyment of Christ art sensual and by the light of Christ
is to be condemned and juged, with the world, who art without God and without
the enjoyment of Christ, in the beggarly rudiments of the world, thou say O
fleshly minded men whom the God of this world has blinded because you believe
not: and thou say, thus says the Lord and speaks the Prophet Mal. words: to
which I answer; this again I do deny; the God of the world is cast out, and the
eye is opened through judgment, and our fleshly minds are judged, and in the
Name of Jesus we do believe, and our belief in him has purified our hearts; to
the praise of the living God, who has wrought all our works in us, and for us,
do I speak without boasting; and here again I charge it upon thee, that thou
art a slanderer and a false accuser; and let shame cover thee who professes thy
self to be a teacher of others, who thy self is not taught of the Lord; but
steals Malachies words, and speaks them to us in thine own imaginations, and
calls it the word of the Lord; the Lord is against thee thou false prophet, who
prophesies lies in his name; and that which thou speaks to us is thy own
condition, and that which shall come upon thine own head, for a child of
disobedience thou art, and thy eye is blinded by the God of this world; and
whereas thou say we are spiritually proud, that give forth our selves to
be some great ones; and we say we are Apostles, and are not, but are found
liers, proud Pharisees, hypocrites, that say we are just, holy, humble; and
the poor sinful publicans are more justified then we; I answer; proud we are
not, our God shall judge between thee and us in this thing, for we have
nothing but what we have freely received from him: and that we give forth our
selves to be great ones; here thou art a lier, and a false accuser again; this
we have said, and do yet again declare that we were moved of the Lord of heaven
and earth to come to declare his mind and his truth in this City; but this is
no boasting, and by that same spirit which was in the Apostles, were we moved,
and are guided, and by no other, but who has found us liers since we came, I
challenge you, and all thy sect to prove one lie that we have uttered; or else
let shame cover thee, and let thy mouth be stopped; and let thy own heart
condemn thee to be found the lier thy self; and this we testify against
thee, and all the world, that by Jesus, and in him are we made holy, just, and
humble, he is made these things in us, and for us; and the publican state is
witnessed by us who have passed through the figure and parable into the life
and substance; and whereas thou say we that boast of our light within, and
faith, thus says the Lord and brings Christ's words. I answer, this is another
lie, we do not boast of our light within, but we witness it to be within
us, and to have enlightened every one that comes into the world; which thou
and thy generation denies* and so would make Christ a lier, and the Scripture
a lie; but against you all with all the world we bear testimony, and the
Father bears witness with us, that every man that comes into the world is
lightened by the light of Christ; which teaches all that love it into
righteousness, but condemns them that hate it, whereof thou art one who utters
forth thy lies and slanders, and false accusations against the innocent; and
that Scripture John 9. we own, and do witness to be fulfilled in us by the
coming of Christ; he which did see, is blind, and he which was blind now
sees; and while we did see our sin remained, but being blind we have no
sin; but this to thee and to thy spirit is a mystery sealed, and never to be
known in that nature and wisdom; and here again thou have used thy tongue
false Prophet like, and must receive a false prophets reward. And whereas thou
say if Christ had not spoke to us in his word, we had had no sin, but now we
have no cloak for our sin. I answer. Christ's words we own, but here thou art
made manifest to all to be an adder to the Scripture (in his word) this thou
have added false Prophet-like, and therefore the Lord will add his plagues
unto thee as the Scripture says; be ashamed and blush, thy folly and
wickedness is made manifest, who is not ashamed (to carry on thy design) to
add to Christ's words. And whereas thou say, we do not only neglect the
weightier matters of the law, but the law it self, teaching men so to do; for
we said that the Scripture is not the rule of faith and conversation, as one
of us taught Sept. 27. in thy hearing, and many others that will witness it.

I answer, here I challenge thee to prove that thou have spoken, and all thy
witnesses which thou speaks of; oh thou lier be ashamed to forge such lies,
and declare them in writing for truth, we neglect not the weightier matters of
the law, nor the law, nor teach any so to do; all that ever heard us will bear
witness against thee, and they (though our enemies) shall witness for us, and
against thee in this thing, for we declare the everlasting Gospel, which is the
fulfilling of the law, and this we declare, that the law must have its
operation through, before the Gospel be witnessed; and one of thy own society
said to us, we had preached the law, and brought men to understand it from
grace; now let all take notice of the confusion you live in, and let your own
hearts condemn you, and the light in your own consciences convince you, that
you are in Babylon and in confusion, and are no true Church of Christ, where
all are of one heart, and one mind* and this again I affi^me as before I did
in thy hearing, that the Scripture is not the Saints rule, but the Spirit which
gave forth the Scripture, as the Scripture it self witnesses, Romans 8. Faith was
before the Scripture was, and therefore the Scripture is not the ground of it,
but a declaration of it, and no other faith we own but the faith which Abel
had, and which Moses had, which was when no Scripture was written, and that we
own to be the rule of our conversation, which they walked by, the immediate
spirit of God which was before the Scripture was written; and all you who
profess the Scripture to be your rule, your own rule shall testify against you
when the eternal God judges you, and they who vvitness that to be their rule
which gave forth the Scripture, walks up in the life of the Scripture more
then you all; and you are proved to be but the Jew outward, who bosts of the
Ordinances from the letter, but persecutes them by slanders and false
reproaches, who witness the substance; and your praise is only of men, and not
of God; and the same woe which thou pronounces upon us will fall upon thy own
head for this thy grievous slander, that we neglect the law, and teach men so
to do; and whereas thou brings many Scriptures, and says thus says the Lord,
I answer, the Scriptures we own, and by that spirit which speaks them forth,
we witness them to be true, and they are ours; and though you say they are
the savor of death to us that perish, yet thou art found a lier, for we are
saved out of the perishing state, and death is destroyed through death, and
thou have diminished (through faith) from that Scripture 2 Timothy 3. 15. false
prophet like again, and so art both an adder and a diminisher, and thou may
read thy portion in Rev. 22. 18, 19. and whereas thou say, know this thou
perverter of the right way of God, thou shall be judged by the word of Christ
spoke. I answer, here thou sets the Scripture in the room of Christ, and art
the perverter of the right way of God thy self, for the Scripture says, all
judgment is committed to the Son, and the Scripture is not the Son; and thou
did say and now again writes, that the Scripture shall judge the world; and
so I charge it upon thee that thou art a blasphemer, who exalts the Scripture
above the Son, of God, and shall be judged by the Son into utter drrknesse,
and into the pit, from whence thou art come; yet this I testify, he that
receives the Son rejects not those words which was spoken by him; though
thou and thy generation Pharisee like may make a profession of the words
which Christ spoke and yet reject the Son, and all to whom Christ speaks,
which receives him not, shall be judged by the word which he speaks, for he
speaks eternally which shall stand eternally; but when did he speak to thee?
for this I do declare, thou may have those words which he spoke, and yet
never have heard his word nor voice; as the Pharisees had those words, which
God spoke by the Prophets, but never had heard his word, nor seen his shape.
John. 5. and thou say quake and tremble at this; that word which you reject
and despise shall judge you at the last day; and says, thus says the Lord,
and brings Christ's words, and the Apostles words; I Answer. the Lord rebuke
thee thou scorner, here thou have made the filthynesse of thy heart known, for
out of the abundance thereof thy mouth speaks: here thou art seen to be a
scorner; quaking and trembling we own, it is that which the holy men of God
witnessed, but here be a witness against thy self, that thou art a scorner of
their conditions: what have thou to do to talk of the Scripture, who art
scorning that which it declares of? here thou art made manifest to be one that
has the form but denies the power, and scorns at it* God scorns thee, thou
scornful one; and let all that fear the Lord depart from thee, and see thy
filthiness and search the Scripture whether it testifies not of that, which
thou scorns at, and makes a mock upon. And that we reject and despise the
Scripture and the words which Christ spoke, which thou accusest us of; this is
another lie, and a false slander, for the scriptures we own in their place,
and by the Spirit of God sets to seal that they are true, but that they shall
judge the world we do deny; and herein thy ignorance does appear, and that
thou art blinded by the God of this vorld, which thou would cast upon us: and
Christ's words, and the words of the Apostles shall fall upon thy own head,
for vengeance in flames of fire will the Lord render upon thee, thou lier and
slanderer and false accuser, who art in disobedience to the Gospel of God. And
whereas thou say the Lord has spoken it, and it shall surely come to pass,
and bringst many Scriptures,

I Answer. The Scriptures we own and what is spoken in them shall be
fulfiled; but thou lier when did God speak this to thee? the judgments
pronounced in them shall fall upon thy own head, because thou art guilty of
the same iniquities, as they were of, against whom these Scriptures was
declared; and whereas thou say we are those that the Lord before has spoken
of in his word, (and therefore no marvel we would not have men to read it)
and cites the 2. of Peter. 2. Chap.

I Answer. I do in the presence of the living God deny thee and thy false
assertion, but it shall stand for thy own condition; thou art one in the
generation which Christ spoke of, and that was in the Apostles days, which
has the form, but denies the power as they had; and I charge thee again with
a lie in thy mouth who says, we would not have men to read the Scriptures;
they who have heard us shall witness against, thee, that we do direct to
search the Scripture, whether our doctrine be not true, and by the Scripture
shall our doctrine be tried; how long will thou utter thy lies in the name of
the Lord? the Lord will plead with thee thou unclean lying spirit, and that
which thou pronounces against us, shall come upon thy self; and thou say we
through covetousness make merchandise of some; we challenge thee and all the
City of London to prove this, thou lying serpent, God shall plead with thee,
we are free and clear in the sight of God, of thy false accusations, and have
desired nor sought after no man's money, nor gold, nor apparel, God is our
witness, and many in this City knows the same, though thou slanderingly an
enemy of God does accuse us; but I challenge thee in thy reply to this, make
it appear what thou assertest, or lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and let shame
strike thee in the face for ever; I charge thee that thou can make appear
plainly in particular, and do not darkly accuse us, what those damnable
heresies are, which we bring in, and wherein we deny the Lord, and what our
pernicious ways are which thou falsely and slanderously accuses us of, and
wherein we are fleshly and despise government, and are presumptuous, and
wherein or how we speak evil of Dignities, and wherein we are as natural bruit
beasts, and what these things are, we speak evil of which we know not, and
what our swelling words of vanity are, and whom we do allure through the lusts
of the flesh, and through much wantonness. in the presence of the Lord I
challenge thee to prove the particulars of thy accusations, and not to slander
in the dark, though such as these there were in the Apostles days, who were
turned out from the light, and the Apostles which dwelt in the light saw them,
and such a generation there is now, they are seen and known where they are, by
them who abides in the light; but of these thy false slanders* upon us, we are
clear in the presence of the Lord God, and that portion which thou would
give unto us must thou have thy self, for with what measure thou have meted, it
shall be measured to thee again; even the blaknesse of darkness for ever, and
the day of the vengeance of God is at hand against thee. And whereas thou say,
we pretend to tremble, it is true, we pretend the example of Moses, and thou
say O abominable hypocrysie and dissimulation, will that justify your
shaking your hands like idiots, and your raving like mad men? Moses was a man
in whom the fear and dread of the Lord was, who kept his word, but you despise
it; who loved the law, but you reject it.

I Answer. We do not only pretend to tremble, but often do we, and have we
witnessed it, by the mighty power and dread of the Lord upon us, and we walk
not by the example of the servants of the Lord without us, but the same power
we witness which was in them by which they were made to tremble; which thou
scorns and derides at, and calls it madness: the holy men of God were
counted by such as thou art, mad men; and were cast out of their assemblies
which trembled at the word of the Lord: but that we despise the word and
law of God, here thou art a lier again; and the plagues of God hang over thy
head* for thy lies and slanders against the innocent; the same sear of God
which was in Moses we vvitness, and no other, and thou who art without it
art a Heathen, and Moses, and Jeremiah, and Habbakuk, which thou speaks of,
were our example, who walked by the same spirit; and served the Lord by the
same spirit, but that we served our fleshly lusts* which here again thou
accusest us of; I do challenge thee to prove it; but I know thou can not, and
therefore art in the nature of the Devil accusing the Brethren; and to walk by
tradition, we deny, which you also would lay to our charge; but the same
spirit by which they were acted, acts us the same way according to its measure;
and the same light which they walked in is our light, and this light is the
light of Christ within us and not without us: And whereas thou say its true,
if we served the Lord, and kept his word, it would make us to tremble, as it
does those that fear him, but we have rejected the law of the Lord, and the
word which he has spoken; and the Lord when he comes to shake terribly the
earth, shall give us our portion in the lake that burns.

I answer. Let all the world here take notice of thy confusion and ignorance
which utters forth it self through thee; thou before was scorning trembling,
and now thou art approving of it; and if it be they that tremble which serve
the Lord, here be a witness against thy self, thou serves him not, who art
not yet come to tremble, but art in thy high nature above the fear of the Lord;
and here again thou art found a false accuser, for we reject not the Law of
the Lord, nor the word which he has spoken, but live in it, and rejoices in
it daily, for in it is our hearts delight; and here again, as thou have
measured to us, it shall be measured unto thee when the Lord God arises to
recompense his enemies* thy portion will be the same, as thou have said in the
lake which burns with fire and brimstone.

And now a few words in answer to that which thou calls a Caution to all that
are called Saints in the Nation, which may concern all people.

I Answer. They who are Saints who dwell in the light, and walks in the light,
does discern thee to be no Saint, neither will receive any caution from thee,
but will testify against thee, for thy lies and slanders and false accusations
which thy book is filled withal, and herein it may concern all people that
thy lies and slanders be reproved and laid open, lest they receive lies for thy
truth, and be deceived by thy subtle speeches, who brings the Prophets words,
and the Apostles words, wresting them and f^lsely applying them, to make thy
lies to be received; but all people who love the light wherewith Christ has
enlightened them, will see thee and deny thee, and turn away from thee, as
having the form of Godliness without the power. And whereas thou say ye
may rejoice that you live to see not only the mystery of godliness, but also
the working of the mystery of iniquity in the fleshly corrupt and sensual
minded men, called Quakers.

I Answer. That name Quakers was cast upon us by the Heathen, through their
scorn and derision, as the name Christians was upon the Disciples, though
quaking we own, for all the holy men of God witnessed it, and the Holy
Scriptures declares of it; and here again thou enviously and maliciously have
cast a slander upon us, fleshly, corrupt* and sensual mindedness, and the
working of the mystery of iniquity is destroyed in us by the mighty power of
God made manifest in Jesus Christ, which takes away sin; to the praise of the
living God I speak, in clearing the innocent from thy false slanders, and it
shall stand for thy own condition, fleshly corrupt and sensual minded, and
the working of the mystery of iniquity. And herein I prove thee to be so by
thy fruits, thy lies, and false reproaches, and envious false acusation which
is the fruits of the flesh and of corrupt sensual mindedness, which fruits
does appear in this thy writing, and as for the mystery of godliness, it is
hidden from thee, and in that mind and nature you shall never know it, for thou
lives in the sight of thy own pollutions, and of thy carnal ordinances, and
not in the enjoyment of the mystery of Christ, which is godliness; and
whereas thou say, ye may rejoice, and in nothing be terrified, because the
Scriptures did foretell of such, and is fulfilled in these men, and thou brings
many Scriptures where Christ and the Apostles prophesied of the coming in of
false prophets and teachers: I answer, Though ye do now rejoice, yet your joy
shall be turned into howling and sorrow, and the Lord has said it, and the day
of terror will overtake you, wherein your hearts shall fail you for fear, and
your foundation shall be removed; and it is true, that the Scripture does
foretell of us, and is witnessed in us, that all the Lords children should be
taught of the Lord, and that the Lord would gather his flock out of the mouths
of all dum be shepherds* etc. and according to our growth up in the life of the
Scriptures, they are fulfilled in us; but false prophets we do deny, though
all those Scriptures which thou have set down we own to be prophesies of
false prophets, those false prophets which Christ prophesied of, came in the
Apostles days, they saw them coming in then, 1. Joh. 2. 18. and as all these
Scriptures testifies which thou have cited; and since the Apostles days, has
been a great Apostacy and not a true Church of Christ could be found, and
ever since has the same generation of false prophets stood under several forms
and appearances, deceiving the nations: but now the pure light of Christ
shines, discovering to them who walk in the light who they are; and daily more
and more clearly shall they be seen, and thou will be found in their number,
who art a cursed child, in whom the son of perdition is exalted, which utters
forth thy lies and slanders sensually, and make it manifest to all, that thou
have not the spirit of God, but art separated from it, in self separation which
is abomination unto God, and must be scattered by him: and whereas thou say,
seeing it is so, let you be filled with boldness, and let you contend against
those ungodly ones which are now risen; I answer, ungodliness we deny, and
your boldness shall the Lord turn in weakness, and faintness, and your
contendings against us shall not prosper, for this is our heritage; every
tongue that rises up in judgment shall be condemned; you shall all be
scattered and driven away as chafe before the wind, who sets your selves to
contend against the truth, for that which is now risen shall confound you all.
And whereas thou brings many Scriptures, which were exhortations of the Apostle
to the saints, with exhorting thy brethren.

I answer. The Scriptures I do own, and that spirit which spoke them forth I
witness, but thou art an enemy to the power of them, though thou have the
form of truth; thy lying and false accusing has made thee appear to be an
enemy to the life which the holy men of God lived in, and so has cleared thy
self from those Scriptures which were written to the Saints, and must own
those which was written to the world, the lier must be cast into the lake, the
wicked must be turned in hell, and such as these must thou own to belong unto
thee, and these are thy Scriptures which thou have right unto. And whereas thou
say, we talk of high enjoyments, and great revelations without, above, and
beyond the Scripture, and that we talk of a light which is besides the
Scripture, but it is deep, and thick darkness; and what has such lights led
men unto? even contempt of God and of all righteousness.

I answer. Here again thou art found a lier, and an accuser of the brethren,
for what we do declare, the Scripture witnesses to the same, and we speak of
nothing but what is declared of in the Scripture by the holy men of God, and
neither without it, nor above or beyond it do we speak. I challenge thee to
prove what thou have asserted, and all the City of London; that we speak or
declares any thing but what the Scriptures bears witness to the same, and the
light which we declare of, is the light of Christ, which the scripture says
lightneth every one that comes into the world; and it is not besides the
scripture, so as contrary to it, but the scripture bears witness of the light;
and ^ere I charge thee with blasphemy, who calls the pure light of Christ
thick darkness, and that the light of Christ (which is the light which we
declare of) has led men, or leads any to contemn God, or his ordinances, or
righteousness, let shame strike thee in the face thou impudent one, who
blasphemously say, that the light of Christ is thick darkness, and leads into
contempt of God; let the light in thy own conscience condemn thee, thou
enemy of God; for thy lies and slanders, and blasphemy which in this thy
book thou have uttered: and whereas thou exhortest to labor to see an
excellency in Christ, in the word of Christ, and in the Church and Ordinances
of Christ.

I answer. For the simple ones sake, that they may not be deceived, none ever
shall see any excellency in those things, but who ownes and walks in the
light of Christ, which lets every one see themselves first; and your talking of
the same, and report of Christ, and of his Word and Ordinances, is not to know
the excellency of those things, for death in you talks of the same, but the
thing in subst^nce you are ignorant of; and you who stumbles at the light
wherewith Christ lightneth every one, are above the door which is the entrance
unto the life of these things; and so I exhort all to mind the light of Christ,
and to walk in it, and it will lead unto Christ from whence the light comes,
and it will lead to the fulfilling of Christ's words and to the one bread* and to
the one baptism, and the light is the door and entrance unto the life of those
things: but you who hate the light and denies it to be in every one, has but
the husk and outward declaration of those things, and are without the life*
and whereas thou say, they that are of God will hear John, Peter, and Paul, and
the rest that were the servants of Christ, not the fleshly conceits of those or
any other men and Christ's sheep hear his voice, and a strangerthey will not
hear.

I answer. They that are of God, do own the writings of all the servants of
Christ; but many may profess their words, as the Pharisees did the Prophets
words, and as thou do* now, and yet not be of God, but children to the
devil* but that our conceits are fleshly, I do deny thee, for all conceits of
the flesh we deny, and bears witness against, and it shall stand for thy
own condition, and thy voice is the voice of a stranger, and they that are of
God will not follow it: though thou bring the Saints words in thy mouth, as the
devil did unto Christ; yet in the light of Christ thou art seen* and
comprehended, and from the light of Christ answered, and by it judged to be
without the life of those scriptures which thou speaks of, and they are from
thee but as an empty sound.

And whereas thou cites many more Scriptures, which are exhortations of the
Apostles to the Church, and exhorts thy Brethren with them, to which I
Answer as before. The Scriptures I do own, but to thee thou envious man,
they do not belong, for as in this thy vvriting thou art proved a lier, and a
scorner, and a slanderer, and a false accuser, and a blasphemer; out of thy
own mouth, be a witness against thy self, and let all thy whole assembly
bear witness against thee, that the Scriptures which were spoken to the
Saints who vvalked in the light and had denied ungodliness, does not belong
unto thee who art an hater of the light and lives in the pollutions of the
world; but the Scriptures which will surely be fulfilled upon thee, the
wicked shall be turned into hell, and the lier shall have his portion in the lake,
and he that works abomination is to be trodden in the winepresse of the wrath of
God without the City, and such like. And now something in answer to something in
the Epistle to the Reader; whereas thou and the rest of you there say, although
the light has appeared, yet there is a generation of men in the world, that
do hate the light, and endeavor to put it out, crying against the scriptures
of truth; its a dead letter, and against the form of doctrine therein
contained*

To which I answer. It is true, the light has appeared; Christ who is the
light, lightneth every one that comes into the world; which light has appeared
in every man's conscience; and there is a generation which hates the light, and
you are of that generation which say, every man has not the light, and calls
the light of Christ thick darkness, and endeavors to put it out; and here you
have read your own condition though you make a large profession of the
Scriptures (which is not the light, but words declared from the light) as the
Jews did profess the prophets words, but persecuted Christ, and spoke against
him, who was the light and substance of the prophets* words: and if you know
any who cries against the scripture, and against the doctrine therein contained
with you, we cry and declare against such, for the scripture we own in its
place to be a true declaration of God, of Christ, and of the saints conditions,
but they are not the light, but Christ is the light, as themselves bear
witness, nor are they the saints guide, but he spirit that gave them forth, as
they themselves bear testimony, neither was the scriptures given forth to give
your own imaginations and suppositions upon, but they themselves are doctrine,
and are as they speak, he that has the same spirit which speaks them forth,
reads them and understands them, and none else; and whereas thou say lest
that simple, plain meaning men should be kept in Babels darkness, or the
enlightened fall into the error of the wicked, for that reason your book came
to public view; I answer. Truly you are deceived, who think to gain into your
form, the simple, plain meaning men by lies, and false slanders and false
accusation; who are simple and plain unto God, will discern your deceits, and
how falsely you have accused the innocent, and will see you your selves to be in
Babels darkness, and who walks in the light wherewith they are lightened will see
you to be in the error of the wicked and out of the truth; and it is well for
the truths sake, that your book came forth, that thereby your filthiness and
deceitfulness, and enviousness might be laid open to the simple. And truly I
say unto you, you have, and will miss of your end in putting forth this book of
yours; and whereas you say you shall be willing at any time to vindicate every
conclusion therein contained against any that shall oppose. I answer, I
challenge you all in this particular to prove those accusations which you have
laid to our charge whom you call Quakers, in many particulars which before I
have demanded; what they are is before spoken of; and whereas you say, you
account that light within (not witnessed by the scripture without) which some
so much talk of, to be deep darkness. I answer, if you know any who speak of
any light which the Scripture does not witness of, we with you freely declares
against such, and such a light is darkness, but the light of Christ which we
speak of, which has lightened every one that comes into the world, I hope you
are not so impudent, but you will acknowledge that the scriptures speaks of this
light; and dare not deny, but that the scripture witnesses that Christ is the
light of the world; for as I said, we freely give way, and desires that all
might search the scripture, whether these things be not so as we declare.

And whereas you say, and exhort to let the Scripture be the rule of faith and
practice.

I Answ. Here you would always keep people in darkeness, under your teaching,
and would make void the new Covenant which is the Law written in the heart, and
the spirit of the Lord put in the inward parts, to be the rule and guide of the
Saints, for who walks by the rule without them, and teaches men so to do,
would make void the Covenant of life and peace, where the teacher is not
removed into a corner, which teacher all that have faith and an holy
conversation do witness, which teaches not contrary to what the Scripture
speaks, but is a teaching fulfilling of the Scripture, and an establishing of
it, though thou and many may profess the teaching of the Scripture and may in
your own wills, conform unto it in the outward appearance, as the Pharisees
did, and yet be but Hypocrites and deceived as they were; and I say again,
that faith was before the Scripture was written, which faith is declared of in
the Scripture, which faith comes as is manifested by hearing of the word
Preached, which word is even in the mouth and in the heart; if you have an ear
you may hear; and now I advise you all in the name of the Lord to cease
striving and contending against the truth, for verily the stone which is cut
out of the mountain without hands, will dash your image of many mixtures to
pieces, and it falling upon you, will grind you to powder, and your conforming
the outward man, to an outward thing and teaching men so to do, and limiting
and tying the Holy one to a visible thing, will not cover you in the day of the
Lord: nay verily, though concerning the Scripture without, you may walk
blameless, yet one thing will be found lacking even the cross of Jesus
Christ, by which all sin is crucified in them who walks in it; and I say unto
you, that your covering is too narrow, and it will not hide your secret parts:
for in the eternal light of Christ you are seen and comprehended, your
beginning, your time, and your end, for though you have the Scriptures, and
Jewish like, walks up in the outward appearance of them, crying the ordinances
and Churches are ye, yet your praise is of men, and not of God, for you are
enemies to the life of the Scriptures as is made appear by your many lies and
slanders against us, which you have uttered; and I say returen your minds every
one within to that in your own consciences which reproves you in secret for
your secret iniquities, it will let you see where your hearts are, and how far
they are mortified to the world, and the love of it, and this light wherewith
every one of you is lightened is the light of Christ, and it is the Lords true
witness and shall witness for him eternally against all whose deeds are evil,
who walk in disobedience of it, and all who love it and walk in it, it leads
unto Christ, and into all purity and holiness and uprightness of heart toward
God and man; and this light leads unto justification, all them who are taught
by it; and here is your teacher, loving it; and your condemnation eternally,
continuing to hate it. And thus I have answered your book, and the truth is
witnessed, and many false lies and false accusations denied and testified
against, and thus I rest, waiting for an answer to clear your self (if you be
able) of those things which I have denied from you, which you have charged upon
us, for God is my witness, this I do desire, that truth may be made manifest
and embraced, and deceit and error discovered and denied.
