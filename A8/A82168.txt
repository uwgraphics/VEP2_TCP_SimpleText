THE DECLARATION OF THE KINGDOMS OF ENGLAND and SCOTLAND, Joined in Arms for
the Vindication and defense of their Religion, Liberties, and Laws, against
the Popish, Prelaticall, and Malignant party; By the Honorable Houses of the
Parliament of England, and the Honorable Convention of Estates of the Kingdom
of Scotland, in the year 1643.
IF either Christian duty, which by reason of the light of the Gospel so
clearly shining amongst us, might have been expected from the professors of
Religion; Or if natural affection which even in the Heathen and Infidels
ignorant of Christ, has abounded toward their native Country, or sincere
respect to His Majesty's Honor and happiness, could have been found in the
ways or hearts of our common enemies, the enemies of Truth and Peace: If they
had either feared God or regarded men, or yielded to our Importunities, We had
not after so many Petitions, Declarations and Remonstrances as have filled all
men's ears and hands, been put to this necessity of a new Declaration (which
therefore must be more patheticke and pressing then any of the former:) Nor
after so many troubles and sufferings of the Kingdom of Scotland, after the
desolation of the Kingdom of Ireland, and after so much blood, and so many
unnatural Tragedies in the Kingdom of England, had We been redacted to this
present condition and joint posture of Arms; the Lord whose counsels are a
great depth, and who is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works,
has just cause of controversy against us and this whole Island. But who would
have believed that our Religion, Liberties, and Laws which for so long a time
have endured opposition and Assaults of foreign power, envying our
happiness, would have been opposed, oppressed and trod under foot by the craft
and cruelty of our own Natives and Country men?

In this our extremity, first of all We Declare, that We place not our
confidence in our own counsels and strength, but our confidence is in God
Almighty the Lord of Hosts, who will not leave nor forsake his people; It is
his own Truth and Cause which we maintain with all the Reformed Churches, and
which has been witnessed and sealed by the testimony, sufferings, and blood of
so many Confessors and Martyrs against the Heresy, Superstition, and Tyranny
of Antichrist: the glory of his own Name, the exaltation of the Kingdom of
his Son, and the preservation of his Church, and of this whole Island from
utter ruin and devastation is our aim, and the end which we have before our
eyes. His Covenant have we in both Nations solemnly sworn and subscribed, which
he would not have put in our hearts to do, if he had been minded to destroy
us; The many prayers and supplications which these many years past, but
especially of late have been offered up with fasting and humiliation, and with
strong crying and tears, unto him that is able to deliver and save us, are a
seed which promise unto us a plentiful Harvest of comfort and happiness; and
the Apostasy, Atheism, Idolatry, Blasphemies, Profaneness, Cruelty, Excess,
and open mocking of all Godliness and Honesty, have filled the cup of our
Adversaries to the brym, and threaten their speedy and fearful destruction,
unless it be prevented by such extraordinary repentance, as seems not yet to
have entered into their hearts.

Upon these and the like grounds and considerations, being confident that this
war wherein both Nations now firmly united are so deeply engaged, is of God;
We resolve with courage and constancy unto the end, to do our part, and the
Lord who has stirred up our spirits, displayed his Banner before us, and given
the Alarm, do that which seems him good.

Secondly, although every man is to hope for the principal reward of his
service from God, who rewards every one according to his works; yet we find
our selves bound in conscience and equity to Declare, that besides those who
have the public faith engaged to them for their security, such as since the
beginning have done valiantly, and dealt faithfully in this Cause, and such as
have chosen rather to suffer the spoiling of their Goods, then to assist the
Enemy, or to take Arms against their Religion and Country, and shall continue
constant in the same course of doing or suffering unto the end, shall be
according to their Merits taken into public Notice and Consideration, their
losses (so far as may be) repaired, and themselves honored and rewarded by
such means and ways, as we trust, God in his providence shall afford, and the
Parliaments or Estates of the two Kingdoms respectively shall in their
Wisdom, Justice and Thankfulness judge most convenient; so that no man who
has been eminent in action, or has suffered any notable loss for the
public, shall be neglected or slighted, but one way or other shall be
thankfully remembered, to his own honor and the good of his posterity.

Thirdly, although Newtrality and indifferency in the time of the danger of
Religion be a thing detestable to God, who wills all Christians earnestly to
contend for the Truth, and such as have been Newtralists or indifferent in the
tunes of civil division and danger of the Commonwealth, have been in all
Nations severely punished as pernicious and public enemies: yet that the
consciences of all men may be the more convinced, and all pretexts removed, We
give now Public Warning to such persons to rest no longer upon their
Newtrality, or to please themselves with the naughty and slothful pretext of
Indifferency, but that they address themselves speedily to take the Covenant,
and join with all their power in the defense of this Cause against the common
Enemy, and by their zeal and forwardness hereafter to make up what has been
wanting through their lukewarmnesse; this they will find to be their greatest
wisdom and safety; otherwise We do Declare them to be public Enemies to the
Religion and Country, and that they are to be censured and punished as profes'd
Adversaries and Malignants.

Fourthly, Because a great many of the multitude of the people, upon ignorant
Mistakeings, false Informations, and Threats, or Compulsions, against their
wills and inclination, have been induced or constrained to join in Arms with
the Enemies against their Religion and Native Country; We do Declare, that
all common Soldiers, who upon the humble acknowledgement of their former
Errors, shall offer themselves willingly and speedily to take the Covenant, and
shall join heartily and really in the defense of this Cause, as becomes good
Christians and lovers of their Country, shall be freely accepted into the
Covenant, and their former Error passed by; otherwise let them expect the
punishment of wilful Delinquents and Malignants.

Fifthly, Because some of the Scottish Nation, upon their own private
respects, or upon specious pretenses and fair persuasions, have joined
themselves in Arms with the Popish, Prelaticall, and Malignant party, against
the Parliament and Kingdom of England, and not considering the nature of the
Cause in which they have been engaged, nor the deep interest of the Church
and Kingdom of Scotland, upon which this War was to turn in the end, have
been fighting against their own Religion and native Kingdom; We do
therefore again Warn all such, of whatsoever quality, and in whatsoever
place, speedily to withdraw themselves from that Faction, to confess their
mistakes, and to join in the Covenant and Cause of God in both Kingdoms
before the first day of March next, otherwise We Declare, in the behalf of
the Kingdom of England, that they are to expect no favor, but are to be used
as desperate Malignants; And We Declare, in behalf of the Kingdom of
Scotland, if they either continue in Arms after the foresaid first day of
March, or withhold their help and assistance from their Native Country, in the
time of trouble and danger, they are to be censured and punished as public
Enemies to their Religion and Country, perfidious transgressors of their
National Covenant, and their Estates disposed of for the use of the Public.

Sixthly, Because there are diverse Noblemen, Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, and
others, who by forsaking or deserting the Parliament of England, and by joining
themselves to the Enemies of Religion, his Majesty's happiness and Peace of
the Kingdoms, have made the Division greater, and the Breaches wider betwixt
the King and his Parliament, and thereby contrary to the duty of their places
and callings, have been the cause of the shedding of much innocent Blood, of
great Losses, and of many Miseries and dangers, to the Public of both
Kingdoms, and of the Sufferings of private men in their Estates, and Lives,
and yet are not to be reckoned amongst the prime Authors of this unnatural
War, nor amongst the malicious and desperate Enemies of their Religion and
Country: We do Declare, That all such forsaking their former Opposition,
returning to their duty, and endeavoring the good of Religion and the public
Peace, shall, as to their lives and liberties of their persons, be secured, and
shall be received into favor: But to the end, that a just difference may be
made betwixt such persons returning so late to their duty, and those that never
departed from it, they must expect that toward the payment of the public
Debts, relieving the common Burdens of the Kingdoms, and repairing of
particular Losses; All which in a great part have been contracted and
sustained by their default or procurement: Their Estates in some proportions
should be liable, and that as the wisdom and discretion of the Parliament, or
of such as shall be authorized by them, (who will be as careful to prevent
their ruin as to punish their Delinquencies) shall find and judge to be
necessary for that end.

Wherein also, the time of their returning and offering themselves, the reality
of their affections and intentions, and readiness to join in the common
Cause, and Covenant, will be taken into special consideration. And in case
they persist in their Opposition, and shall not return before the first day of
March next, they are not to expect favor, but shall be punished as public
Enemies to their Religion and Country.

Seventhly, Because Papists and Popish Recusants, according to the principles
of their Profession, have ever been plotting and contriving the change of
Religion in this Island, and the Ruin of all the Professors thereof: And after
the Frustration of their Attempts, having waited upon such a time as this, have
alienated the Heart of the Kings Majesty from his Protestant and Loyal
Subjects, taken Arms against the Parliament and Kingdom, and by all their
means and power, have maintained a Bloody and unnatural War, presuming in
the end to have their execrable Superstition and Idolatry set up in the place
of the true Reformed Religion, and the King and his Kingdoms to be brought
under the Power and Tyranny of the Pope: We do hereby Declare, That all such
Papists and Popish Recusants, who have been, now are, or shall be actually in
Arms, under the false pretense of defending the Kings Person and Authority,
are to look for no favor, but to be punished as Traitors, and professed and
intolerable Enemies of Religion and their Native Country. The same Declaration
We also make against all such Irish Rebels, whether Papists or others, who
have come over from Ireland, and assisted in this War against the Parliament,
and Kingdom of England.

And Lastly, Because there are some few wicked and divelish Spirits of both
Kingdoms, who have kindled and fomented the Fire of Division and War betwixt
the King and his Parliament, or have misgoverned his Majesty's Counsels and
Courses to his own dishonor, and to the destruction of his loving and
dutiful Subjects, or have infused Malignancie in others, or have been
restless and active Instruments of the Troubles and Miseries of his Majesty's
Dominions.

We do Declare, concerning those who are or shall be found by the Supreme
Iudicatories of the Kingdoms respectively, or their Committees appointed for
that effect, to be such, That as the Conscience of their own bad Deservings
has made them to despair of favor, and thereby uncessantly to work more and
more mischief against their Religion and Native Country, so are they to look
for such Execution of Justice, as is due to Traitors and Enemies of Religion,
of the King, and his Kingdoms, for Terror and Example to others, in all times
to come.

And it is further now Declared, That the whole Estates, real and personal,
moveable, and Inheritance of those that shall not come in at the times before
limited in the Sixth Article, and of the persons before excepted from Pardon,
(as of Papists in Arms, Irish Rebels, and those who shall be found to come
within the compass of the precedent Article) shall be forfeited and employed
for paying the Public Debts, relieving the common Burdens of the Kingdoms,
and repairing of particular Losses.

And this Declaration We make, not from any presumption or vaine-glorying in
the strength of our Armies and Forces, but from the sense of that duty which is
required, and expected from the high places and public relations wherein we
stand, and from the assurance We have of the assistance of God, by whose
providence the trust and safety of these Kingdoms is put in our hands at this
time, having after long and grave consultation, resolved and decreed never to
lay down Arms till Truth and Peace by the blessing of God be settled in this
Island upon a firm foundation for the present and future Generations, which
shall be esteemed of Us an abundant reward of all that We can do or suffer in
this Cause.

FINIS.
