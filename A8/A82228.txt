THE DECLARATION OF THE PROTESTANT ARMY In the Province of Munster.
THE fairest actions are obvious to detraction; virtue it self has many
Enemies through ignorance, We expect not to silence the reports of evil
speakers; thars as much beside our aim, as beyond our Power: But to give a clear
understanding to the unprejudicated Readers, that our present undertakings are
nothing deviating from our first principles, and our constant profession, is
the sole ambition of our desires; wherein we doubt not but to prevail if we may
obtain the allowable favor of an equal Justi^e.

We have formerly testified unto the world by our constant sufferings in this
Cause, and sedulous endeavors in the service how firmly we stood devoted to
the obedience of the King and Parliament in the prosecution of the Common
Enemy, against whom, the several successes where with our weak attempts have
been seconded, has as well testified the divine Providence over us, as
attracted the approbation of men upon our actions, until a growing party of
Independency sprung up in the Houses and Army; who finding an unaptnesse in us
to receive the impression of their designs, have on that consideration
contrived our subversion. In order whereunto they had no sooner prevailed to
place the Lord Lisle in the Lieutenancy of this Kingdom, but in short time
there was advanced 180000. pound for the service thereof; a surn so
considerable, that had it been effectually employed to the use whereunto it was
designed, might have reduced most of this Kingdom to obedience but 10. Months
of 12. being spent on preparations, and the moneys detained, least should come
to our unconfiding hands, whiles our Soldiers starved in the streets; the Lord
Lisle in February 1646. arrives with 25000. pound of the aforesaid sum, which
with the whole contribution of the Country was exhausted in eight weeks space,
5000. pound in money, and a few provisions only excepted; the only services
performed by the expense of so much treasure, were the taking of Cork, Kinsale
and Younghall out of those hands who had long and faithfully hold them for the
service of the King and Parliament, and placing in them confidents of their
own, to secure unto themselves their own resolutions, which were so fixed upon
the suppression of both King and Parliament, as that they endeavored to
postpone a Commission (from both) under the broad Seal of England to a
Paper-warrant of their own; and howbeit to give countenance, and enforce
obedience to that new contrived Authority they had drawn the head Garrison into
Arms, laden their Muskets with Powder and Ball, shut up the Ports, and drawn
in part of the Lord Broghels Regiment of Horse to the Lord Presidents door, yet
finding the Officers generally (a few particularly obliged persons only
excepted) to adhere unto the Parliaments Authority in the Lord Presidents
person, and nothing moved with their apparition of force, they desisted from
further prosecution of that design, and departed the Kingdom, giving testimony
of the good affections they had for the service thereof, upon their landing, by
laboring to foment a Petition amongst the Horse-Forces then lying ready at the
waterside to imbarque for this Province, whereby they desired to decline this
Service, unless under the Command of some of their Faction. But that (with
many other) proving to weak a practice to accelerate our ruin, they labor to
retard or divert all Supplies for the carrying on this war; For the better
accomplishing whereof it bath been suggested; That the wants of this Army are
not so great as they are frequently represented, but that here is a competency
upon the place to support us; though to take away that supposition (being of
somewhat a long standing) it has been often most earnestly desired that a
Committee might be sent over to improve whatsoever may arise upon the place,
and dispose of what shall be transmitted thence; But as there is a suggested
sufficiency of means, so there is a supposed deficiency in the Officers which
must give ground to detain all supplies till they can be sent by such as have
sufficient prejudice to this Army. As a practice to this purpose we must
necessarily look upon the endeavor used by some Independents to take off the
reputation of our late engagements with the Rebels at Knock-nonosse calling it
(on the open Exchange) a project to draw on the adventurers (then convening to
advance moneys for our relief) and for the greater disparagement of the action,
substracting from the number of the Rebels, both alive and slain, least the
considerablenesse of the service should induce any proportionable relief, which
the Houses did not with more alacrity grant, then others labored to retard: It
could not otherwise be that of 10000. pound voted so long since, and revoted on
the advertisement of that action, there should be only 2500. li. advanced and
remitted, or that of the Ordinance for 20000. pound per Men's. voted four
months since, and to continue but for six. We should yet find no effect, the
passing of which Ordinance did not more comfort us with the contemplation of a
settled competency, then with an expectation that the Levies made for us
distinguished from any mixture with other taxations, would come clearly and
entirely to us without the accustomed misapplication, whereby the relief of
Ireland was made but a stale to collect great sums by for other uses; It being
generally observable, and many of us eyewitnesses thereof, that the
Impositions laid in City and Country for the relief of this distressed
Kingdom, were paid in with the greatest alacrity and readiness of any other
taxes, which occasioned the name of our relief to be interwoven in all
assessements.

We doubt nor but many will be ready to object an impossibility that any man
can be so unchristian to obstruct or divert the supplies of this bleeding
Kingdom, to the support whereof all so highly pretend; And yet the detaining
most part of the train of Artillery with its Carriages and Utencills, for which
the Lord Lisles account stands charged with above 12000. pound, and for
transportation whereof 1000. was imprested to Sir John Veale, could not have
passed with impunity if some did nor contrive the retarding the work of
Ireland; The reproachful full usage of those Gentlemen who in Conformity to
the Ordinance of Parliament disbanded and subscribed for the service of
Ireland; The suffering of many men desirous to come for Ireland to lie upon
free quarter in the West, til they had eaten as much as would have maintained
them here a twelve-moneth, and were at last disbanded; The strict course taken
(by the interposition of some particular persons) to deprive us of all hope of
relief from the shipping, by reprizals taken at Sea upon our Coasts, and even
in our Harbors mouths (an expedient that has formerly often preserved us in
our greatest exigencies) savoureth of no mean endeavors to retard the relief
of Ireland: And the words of a powerful Member of the Army to a late servant
of the Lord Lisles declaring our starving condition for want of food and
raiment. (That if we in Munster were not poor enough, they would make us so)
have been in a great measure verified; But we do the less wonder that it
should be their endeavor to make us so, when we consider the arguments raised
by Colonel Lambert and others of the Army, against the justice and lawfulness
of this war on our parts, and justifying the actions of the Rebels; it having
been avouched to some of ourfaces, that the English interest were better in the
hands of the Rebels then in ours: And there have not been wanting those of the
Lord Lisles own retinue, who have openly professed that they made No
destinction betwixt the Rebels and those of the Protestant party which they
found upon the place, his Lordships domestique Chappellain at the same time
diffusing words of the same sense in the Pulpit, whiles other Orthodox Divines
were not admitted to preach: But we shall sum up all their practices to
obstruct our relief, in this one instance of their late seizure upon the moneys
brought in upon the Ordinance of 20000. l. per Men's. and taking the same out of
the hands of our Treasurers, so as that it may be feared that to have the war
finished here before the perfection of their designs in England, would prove
to them the greatest dissatisfaction in the world, by means whereof many of our
poor Soldiers have been already swept into a miserable Grave; for whose lives
as these men stand justly accomptable, so will it be difficult for them to be
freed of the guilt of all that blood which has been shed in the service which
but for their practices had been long ago foreclosed; and yet their, confidence
is remarkable; for though these things have been visibly practiced in our eyes,
yet we find the cry raised aloud against the KING, the eleven Members,
involving the Lord President for obstructing the War of Ireland; and the
INDEPENDANTS putting on as sober countenances, as if their hands were innocent
of our blood, and that it were just that they should pass by plausibly
unblameable; And for this end they make that Criminal in some, that they allow
to be commendable in others: If we importune Relief, declare against
Innovations in Government, profess a readiness to serve and obey the
Parliament, we must at least sue forth an Act of Indemnity; and it is held for
a special lenity that two of our Officers were not executed on that score. But
if the Army in England refuse to disband at the appointment of an Ordinance of
Parliament, or to obey the major Votes of the Houses, and march up to the City
of London with Banners displayed, it shall not only be approved, but made
penal to us, or any other that dare mention it with dislike; though as being
Englishmen and Subjects, we esteem our interest and propriety in the Law of The
Land, and liberty of the Subject, proportionably as good as theirs: Though
these their private practices were sufficiently notorious unto us, yet we were
resolved to struggle with all difficulties, and to maintain the Protestant
interest in these parts successively to the last man, rather then by any
Cessation with the Irish, or otherwise to give a jealousy of forfeiting the
least trust which was imposed in us by chat authority which employed us hither;
while they continued in the Government, we would not decline our obedience for
the grearest hardships; But now at last discovering the resolutions of our
adversaries to cast off all obligations both to King and Parliament, rather
then to fail in their intendments: We conceive we are obliged by the Law of God
and of the Kingdom, not to assent unto their requirement whom Power, not
Justice, has seated n those places of authority: It is, and was ever a main
principle whereon all our resolutions were grounded to contend for the safety
of his Majesty's Person and Prerogative, for the Freedom and Privilege of
Parliament, and liberty of the Subject, as they were inter woven, and had a
clear and mutual dependency each upon other; and it was long before we could
entertain any suspicion of a design to engage us further, until the practice
of the Independents party grew more obnoxious, and that we saw his Majesty in
effect deposed, made prisoner to the closest confinement, the freedom of the
Parliament highly invaded and their inclination and assent to a Personal Treaty
with his Majesty (the only expedient of a happy Peace) made frustrate, by the
over pouring awe of the Army; the Liberty of the Subject, and propriety of
interest totally suppressed, and all other the genuine Immunities of that once
glorious Nation, made arbitrary at the pleasure and determination of the Armies
dictations; and though while these things were in our eye and observation, we
had still quiet desires of sitting silent, and intent upon our own engagement
here, and the prosecution and conduct of our charge in this Kingdom, yet we
came at last to discern, that if we would not be involved and engaged in the
same practices with those who were resolved to trample under foot, the subject
matter of our National League, that we should be made partakers of their
ruin, whom we had sworn to support; of which besides other evidences, we had
that signal Testimony of the Vice Admirals demand (in this Armies absence in
the field) of certain persons committed to close custody for contriving the
Armies ruin, of his blocking up our Harbors thereupon, and menacing us with a
Declaration of being enemies to the State, and with the access of great Powers
to suppress and suddenly swallow us up (though nothing considerable in twelve
months space came to support the War against the Rebels) unless we did
declare those who acted contrary to our and their own engagements, of seducing
and encouraging our fugitive and mutinous Soldiers abroad, for the
accomplishing the most wicked end of necessitating us, to submit to Famine or
Cessation with the Irish: All which we could not imagine he would presume to
act, without direction and authority from that part of the Parliament which is
soly guided by the pleasure of the Army (for the doing whereof he now avoucheth
Authority at the same time, that the Committee at Derby house assures us of the
houses confidence in our integrity,) And did therefore esteem it absolutely
necessary, at a general Rendezvous upon, our return out of the field, to
declare and manifest our intentions and resolutions to the Soldiery, as well
to give them clear understanding of our intendments as to confirm them against
the practices of seducers, against whose charms we resolve to arm our selves
with these ensuing resolutions: That we will not be involved by consent or
coopperation in any Actions which shall tend to the violation of our public
engagements to the King and Parliament, nor prostrate our selves to a
misguidance with those who (with grief of heart) we observe to be under the
coercive inforcement of the Independent power, from which as we shall labor to
restore them to their proper freedom, so we shall not during their continuance
under these pressures, esteem our selves obliged to the observance of any
injunctions which by the usurped Authority of the Independents they shall
labor to lay upon us, under the notion of Parliament but by the ensuing
Protestation do declare: First, to improve our utmost endeavors for the
settlement of the Protestant Religion according to the examp1e of the best
Reformed Churches. Secondly, to defend the King in his Prerogatives. Thirdly,
to maintain the Privileges and freedom of the Parliament and the Liberty of
the Subject; and that in order hereunto, we shall oppose to the hazard of our
lives those Rebels of this Kingdom who shall refuse their obedience to his
Majesty, upon what terms soever he shall think fit to require it: And we shall
endeavor to the utmost the suppressing of that Independent party, who have
thus fiercely labored the extirpation of the true Protestant Religion, the
mine of our Prince, the dishonor of our Parliament, and the Vassalidge of our
Fellow-Subiects, against all those who shall depend upon them or adhere unto
them: And that this our undertaking might not appear obnoxious to the trade of
England but that we desire a firm union and agreement be preserved betwixt us:
We do likewise declare, that we will continue free Traffic and commerce, with
all his Majesty's good Subjects of England: And that we will not in the least
manner prejudice any of them that shall have recourse to our Harbors either in
their bodies, ships, or goods, nor shall we take any thing from them without
payment of ready money for the same.

It may happily be judged by some as an Act of Imprudence that we should take
this unseasonable time for this Remonstrance, wherein, the King himself is in
confinement, his party nothing; the moderate party of the houses (or most of
them) either in retirement or banishment for the preservation of their lives,
and only those in power and authority against whose proceedings, we make this
our public Protestation: All which we cannot but with much sorrow acknowledge
to be too true, and that these inconveniences are to be resisted but not
avoided; Had we been assertained heretofore that their intentions were as now
we find them, to introduce an Anarchy upon us, and by the destruction of the
Fundamentals of these Kingdoms to advance a Government of their own
imaginations, we had long ere this time approved our duty to King and Country
by opposing them, which in all probabilites we might have done upon more
advantageous terms both to our persons and undertakings, had we not been drawn
on in an expectation of a fair composure of all differences, as not able to
discern (beyond suspicion) the clear drift of their designs through those
various pretenses which they put upon them, till they had gained the whole
power of the Kingdom into their hands: Yet these difficulties must not be
admitted into the balance with honesty; Though it may not come within the
compass of our abilities to serve our King and Country as we would (which we
shall never decline upon the least occasion) yet we desire to approve our
integrities to both by this manifest of our resolution.

April, 1648.
