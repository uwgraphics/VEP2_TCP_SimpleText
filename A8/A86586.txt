AN EXERCITATION Concerning the NATURE OF FORGIVENESS of SIN.

Very necessary (as the Author humbly conceives) to a right information, and
well grounded decision of sundry Controversal Points in Divinity now depending.

Directly intended as an Antidote for preventing the danger of Antinomian
Doctrine.

And consequently subservient for promoting the true faith of Christ and fear
of God, in a godly, righteous, and sober life.

By THOMAS HOTCHKIS, Master of Arts of C.C.C.C. And Minister of Gods Word at
Stanton by Highworth in the County of Wilts.

To which is prefixed Mr. Richard Baxters Preface.

let him know, that he which converteth a sinner from the error of his way,
shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.

CHRISTIAN READER,
THe Reverend Author of this ensuing Treatise, has it seems, such humble
thoughts of himself, and these his Labors, that unless some other do lead
them forth into the public light, they must be condemned to unprofitable
obscurity. I apprehend my self the most unfit of any for such an office, were
it but because I found, it had pleased him to make such mention of my name, as
I may not approve of; and well knowing that we might hear a Mulus Mulum
scabit; from the party that will undoubtedly be offended at his Discourse. But
when it pleased himself to remit his Exercitation into my hands, with a full and
final Resolution, that by me it should live or die (on what reason I little
know,) I durst not stand on such personal punctillio's, nor be guilty of such
cruelty as to stifle such a birth, for the avoiding of the toothed censures of
those men, who are implacable to them that bow not to their Judgments; and
whose good words can never be won with Innocence, but only with a compliance
with the Interest of their Party, and a listing our selves and marching under
the Colors of their Division, and Conduct of their admired Leaders, against
the Verity of Christ, and the unity and Purity of his Church. I know it is none
of the Authors expectation, that I should justify every word in his writings:
I dare not do so by my own: nor will he do it himself. Nor is it an
applauding Commendation that he desires, but an Impartial censure, and what
intimations may be most profitable to the Reader. I understand he has not
been rash in fixing on the Conclusions in this book; but has tendered it to
several Learned, Judicious Divines, esteemed Orthodox, for their perusal and
Censure: and where some of them have advised to the alteration of some phrases,
he has condescended very much to their desires.

Though he be my Country man, I have no further acquaintance with the Author,
then an hour or two's conference, and the perusal of his papers, and the good
report of others do afford me: by which I judge him a grave, pious, sober
Divine, not so quick and sharp, as deliberately Judicious and solid, not made
so much for words as Matter, nor to please men's ears with smoothness and
eloquence, as to inform their Judgments by a plain discovery of practical
Truths. I perceive he lives not far from the place where Dr. Crispe did
exercise his Ministry; and so having more to do with the Antinomians, either
for their recovery, or the Defense of the Truth against them, then in most
other parts our Ministers have; and more need to fortify the people against
the infection of their errors; it turned much of the stream of his studies and
labors this way. God has made the several errors that have risen in most
ages, an occasion of the clearing and advantaging his truth; and one error a
means of the destruction of another. The Papists errors in the point of
Justification by the Merit of works, and other such like self ascribing
conceits, did occasion from Luther, Melancthon, and other leading Reformers of
those times, a more ample discovery of the freeness of Gods grace, and a
fuller vindication of the sufficiency of the blood of Christ, then else the
Church had been like to have so soon enjoyed. When the contrary error was
sown by Islebius and his Antinomians, and too much watered by Illiricus and
his Lutherans, and grown to maturity in the former Libertines and late
Antinomians here with our selves; God made this an occasion to awaken his
Ministers to maintain more vigorously the use of the Law, the necessity of
Faith, Repentance and Obedience, and more clearly to open the nature of the
Covenants, and the Reason of Duty, then formerly had been done; yet were the
writings but few and brief that have been published against this kind of men,
(except only those between the Majorists and the Flaccians, who were somewhat
learned men) because the opinions of these Libertines were so carnal and
gross, and their lives ordinarily so scandalous, and the ends of many of them
so fearful, that through Gods mercy, it was but very few that were seduced by
them; and both they and their reasonings did seem so contemptible, that
learned men thought it needless to trouble themselves with them: especially
having a learned, and subtle kind of adversary on the other side, (the Papist
and Arminian) that found them work. The turbulency and scandalousnesse of some
of them in London, first drew forth Dr. Tailors Regula Vitae: But lately they
were headed by many public preachers; Eaton, Town, Randall, Simpson,
Saltmarsh, but the man that most credited and strengthened their party was Dr.
Crispe: These have occasioned those profitable labors of Mr. Gataker, Master
Burges, Mr. Rutherford against them, seconded by Mr. Bedford, Mr. Geree, and
others: And Mr. Air has happily now drawn forth against them that Judicious
man Mr. Benjamin Woodbridge. And this Exercitation does next take its place in
this Army that is engaged against the Libertines: which though it be yet the
last, and one of the least in my Judgment, is not the least useful. Diverse
weighty Truths are here asserted and cleared, which too many have overlook't:
the objections of the Adversary are solidly answered. The only or chief thing
that is like to be offensive to some of the Orthodox, is the Authors too free
declaring his dissent about certain Propositions from many of his brethren,
and that by name. Had he been as well acquainted with men's impatiencie of
contradiction, as I am; I believe he would have declined this way. That none of
the brethren excepted against, have reason to suppose me to be interessed
against them, or to subscribe to such exceptions may appear in that it has
pleased the Author to put me also in the number.

In Chap. 2^. Cons. 16. where he labors to show the insufficiency (though
not the falsehood) of my discovery, how Pardon is a transcient act (but indeed
it was another kind of pardon that I spoke of, and of which I was to resolve
that question) I have often declared, that there is little reason we should take
it so ill, to be questioned of imperfection, or charged with a m^stake in lower
controvertable points, especially when its more about words and method, then
the matter it self. But most detestable is the practice of those men that
under pretense of being Orthodoxe, and enemies to error, are carried so
violently in the stream of their party, that they are not able with any
patience to hear or read a line that accuses that party of mistake, or that
differs from them, though but in method or terms: and though it be with the
greatest humility, submissivenesse and hatred of dissensions; yea though it be
directly for peace, by reconciling the differences of several parties, that by
their divisions have long troubled the Church. These men look not far beyond
the borders of their own party, but live among them, as if they were all the
Church, or the world; (Like the fellow, that having never gone out of the City
he was born in, imagined that the wo^ld was all enclosed in those walls) they
think, he that does but keep the unity and peace of their party, does keep
the unity and peace of the Church. Be it but one schismatical congregation of
Separatists, Anabaptists, or Antinomians, who themselves have divided from
almost all the Churches of Christ on earth, yet they seem to affect a unity in
their own separated body, and will condemn a man for disturbing the peace of
their Church. So is it with many of the greater parties, called Lutherans,
Calvinists, etc. But none so horridly guilty of this, as the Papists, who will
needs have it to be all one to be of the Roman Church and of the Catholic; and
to differ from the Roman, as to differ from the Catholic. Shall we imitate
them in this, and make a Popery of our own, whilst we contend against theirs?
Yet alas, how common is it with us? Who can deny it? The Lutherans are more
perversely guilty of it, then we. Yet I must speak to those that are within
hearing of me, If a true Catholic Christian that understands the unity of
the Church, and abhors the name of parties, and desires their
reconciliation for a recovery of unity, do but take on him to show any party
that they have run into some extreme, in some lesser points; and how that
mistake has occasioned division, and still alienates the other party, and that
the reversing of that error would tend to a reconcilement; How furiously do a
sort of factious (though godly and Learned) men rise up against him, and charge
him with innovation, with bringing new light, and breaking the peace of the
Church, as if he were the schismatic, and had a mind to head a Party, whose
mind is to endeavor that there might be no parties, but a unity? as if all the
kernel of the Church were within our nutshell: as if all were new, that is new
to the ears of that society: And as if he did charge the whole Church with
error, or thought himself wiser then the whole Church, or did disturb the
peace of the whole Church, who does but suppose one party to have some
mistakes, and seek to cure them. As if in a separated congregation of
Anabaptists or Antinomians, they should charge me with innovation, and thinking
my self wiser then all the Church, because I say that infants must be baptized,
or that elect infidels are not in Christ, nor pardoned, nor absolved from the
guilt of sin: were not this ridicilous vanity? yet can these same men that seem
so zealous for unity and peace, and the credit of divines, not only be well
contented, that we be zealous against all others but their party, but also do
applaud that man as Orthodox, that will clamor and rail against them, and cry
them down as heretical, or most furiously censure them to be none of the
Church, or so desperately corrupted, that there must be no talk of
reconliation; and he that flies furthest from their opinions, (as if there were
no extreme on the other hand) does best escape the censures of this sort of
men, when reconcilers are still suspected as guilty complyers. And thus godly
and zealous men, while they are too confident of the judgment of themselves,
and their party, are made the great enemies of truth, and the unity of the
Church; and lay those grounds which would make the wounds of the Church
uncurable. And though they are disabled from laying violent hands on
dissenters, yet by their keen and furious censures of all that step out of the
road of their party, they have brought things to that pass, that students lie
under a strong temptation, to study no further, then to know what is the
opinion which is most in credit, and which their leaders hold, and to take heed
of knowing any more then others in the least point; and to shun all things that
tend to a reconciling of the Churches; yea, and to make some raving onset on
others, if they mean to be glorious among their own.

They say, If this should keep out some truths, yet withal it will keep out
heresies, whilst all innovations are kept in such disgrace. But I doubt, it
rather occasioneth heresies, seeing it is the property of heretics to affect
singularity, and to make it their glory among their own party, to be vilified
by others. For my part, I believe one Catholic Church, and the Communion of
Saints: and when I preach to one congregation, I remember how small a part of
the Church they are. And when I write of the opinions of any one party, I
remember how many there be of another mind. But these men object, that the
number of the erroneous is not to be regarded; seeing it is our party only that
is in the right, and has the Scripture on their side, their doctrine and unity
is to be defended, and the rest, if they will have unity, must come over unto
them. To which I answer, that I do confidently believe, that no one party on
earth is so sound in Doctrine, and way of worship, as those called Calvinists.
But to think that any one party is infallible, or has so ingrost the truth,
that others may not in some points be righter then they, or that they may not
be guilty of running too far in any one point, either by the power of
prejudice, or heat of opposition, or some other disadvantage, temptation, or
imperfection; this is such arrogance as modest Christians should not be guilty
of; Much less should they be unwilling to hear and try whether it be so or
not. Undoubtedly there are many differences that seem real and momentous
through mis-informations and prejudice, which indeed are but in words or
methods, or of inferior nature. And abundance of good might be done by drawing
differences into a narrower compass, and discovering the true point of
disagreement, and cutting off all the superfluous contentions; were it not that
by zealous, censorious faction, and by men that know not what Spirit they are
of, the world is swayed by reproaches and prejudice, and the matter brought to
that pass, that none can set their hand to so blessed a work, til they first
resolve to subject themselves to the scorn and slanders even of Divines, and
to cast overboard their interest and reputation even with zealous, godly men.
And how few are they even among those that can contemn the censures of the
openly profane, that are able to deny themselves so far, as to conquer in this
assault? We look on the ignorant vulgar as fools, and therefore pride it self
can spare their applauses. But when we take such pious persons, and Learned
Divines to be men of valuable judgments, that are able indeed to honor or
dishonor us: How hardly will a proud heart lie down to be trod upon? Think not
that I injuriously dishonor the pious, or the Church guides, in supposing any
or many of them to be such, and become such instruments to hinder the work of
Christ, and to further the cause and kingdom of the devil; were they perfect
Saints, it would not be so: But he that observes not the sad imperfections of
the best of Saints, and how far they make them serviceable to the enemy, and
that all men, even the best are vanity and liars, and that the Churches
greatest danger is from it self, more then from all enemies without; yea, and
that every one is the greatest enemy to himself; he knows not himself, he
has sure been a sleep, at least these 12 years, and not seen the discoveries
that our late trials have made; and he has more of the Popish opinion of
perfection then is safe. To be ignorant after our convincing experiences, is to
be mad. Well may the best of Divines say to them that call them Rabbie, and see
wholly with their eyes, and bow down to their understandings, as the Angel said
to John, Rev 22.9. see thou do it not, for I am thy fellow servant, and of thy
brethren, and of them which keep the sayings of this book. Which I speak not
to diminish the just estimation and authority of the Ministry, which I am
blamed by some for maintaining, to be so great; and which God of late has
vindicated, by delivering their most raging enemies (Quakers and such like) to
be plainly possessed or ruled by the devil; nor yet do I lay these accusations
upon all; seeing by the great mercy of God, we have many of eminent moderation
and sobriety; and I observe among the best, that within this year or two their
zeal for the Churches unity is very much increased, for which I heartily
bless the Lord. But the number of such is too small, and of the self conceited
and contentions so considerable, as cannot be hid.

For my own part, when I remember, that it is but about the sixth part of the
world, that are Christians, (all the rest being Pagans, Infidels, and
Mahometans) and of that sixth part, how few the Protestants are, in comparison
of the Papists, the Greeks, the Abassines and the rest, and of the Protestants,
how many countries are Lutherans, besides all others; I confess; I have no
great zeal to confine the Church to the party that I best like, nor to shut
Christ out of all other Societies, and coope him up to the congregations of
those few that say to all the rest of the Church, Stand by, we are more holy
then you. In a word, and a plain word, I am loath to make Christ only the head
of the Calvinists, in stead of being the head of Christians and Catholics, and
loath he should cease to be the head of the body, and become only the head of
any party or faction; and therefore I would contribute the utmost of my
endeavors to reconcile the differing members of that body. If I have digressed
unprofitably, I crave pardon, and return to the subject of this Exercitation.

And because the Reverend Author seems to me in some few passages to have
expressed his mind somewhat obscurely, or in terms liable to mis-construction; I
shall adventure upon a presumption of his consent, to give the Reader a key for
the understanding of them, and to tell him my thoughts of some of them in
particular (leaving the rest to his judgment.) As to the nature of pardon of
sin) from which all the consectaries of this Treatise are drawn,) I conceive
there are three distinct species of it, arising from the three parts of Gods
regiment of mankind. 1. As God is Legislator, he does confer on all believers
a right to impunity, or dissolve the obligation to punishment; in regard of the
Law of works, he does this as he is about that law, by relaxing it. In regard
of the Law of grace, he does it as the free Legislator thereof. And it is this
law it self or promise that is his instrument of doing it, and the act of that
Law, which is his pardoning act; it is conditional to all, before faith. It is
actual pardon to those only that believe. I conceive this pardon is the main
observable Act, that Scriptures and Divines do commonly treat of: And that it
is the same in substance with justification constitutive, though some
respective difference is imported in the terms.

2. As God is judge of the world according to his laws, so he has a
sentential remission of sin, or justification. But there is this difference
between these two terms: Remission of sin does more properly signify the legal
or donative remission, and less properly the judicial sentence, it being in
strictest sense the Prerogative of a Ruler as he is above all law, to pardon
the faults against the Law; and not of a Judge, who as such, must be regulated
by law: yet the word Pardon may be applied to the sentence too. But contrarily
justification signifies very fitly both acts, legal and judicial; but more
fully and strictly, the sentence, then the grant; And therefore justificatio
juris, and justificatio judicis, is a most necessary, current distinction: but
justificatio judicis is the more proper phrase. But remissio juris et judicis
is tolerable, but the later member somewhat less proper.

3. As God is the executioner of his laws, either in this life, before the
final sentence (for some men's sins go before to judgment, and some follow
after) or in the life to come, so it belongs to him actually to punish or to
remit punishment; and thus his pardon is, not to punish: yet not simply not to
punish, but not to punish one that deserved it. This I call, for distinction
sake, executive pardon Now I conceive, that the word Justification, has
principal respect to the obligation and sentence, and less to the punishment.
But the word Remission more emphatically connoteth the punishment, then the
Obligation dissolved; and yet the Obligation more then the sentence. It seems
to me that this Reverend Author does sometime look only at the executive
Remission in his Consectaries; sometime at the Legal Remission; and sometime
he joyneth them together as one. And it must be confessed, that this last is the
full end and perfection of both the former, and the former are both but means
to this. Therefore does God give us pardon, and judge us pardoned, that we may
escape the Penalty and live. The Reverend Author calls this the ultimate Term,
and the dissolving of the Obligation the nearest: which may admit of a double
sense: Either as this species of executive pardon is the end of the foresaid
species of pardon: or as Impunity enters the Definition of the Donative or
Legal sort of Pardon: and so it is not considered in esse existenti, as in
executive pardon it is; but as future and in esse volito. And so as Guilt (or
Obligation to punishment, which is all one) is the nearest term, specifying
this sort of pardon; so Impunity is the remote term, seeing the Obligation
dissolved is an Obligation to Punishment. Reader, here is nothing but what is
obvious, and beyond question for the truth; and if thou have but the skill to
use the Key of this distinction of Remission, and apply it to some dubious
passages in the Exercitation, it will prevent thy misunderstanding, and I
suppose, thy wronging of the Author, and thy causeless offense. Chap. 4. p.
10. where he says that Guilt is taken sometime for the punishment it self, I
confess I have not observed so much; nor yet do. So Chap. 5. p. 12. Nor do I
suppose that the Reatus redundans in personam contains punishment it self,
but only connotes it as the Term of the Obligation. Therefore when Chap. 4.
p. 10. he says, pardon is not a freeing us from the simple Guilt and Defect, I
should, to avoid misunderstanding, have left out the word guilt, and said only
it is the freeing us from the desert, because I have not observed it usual to
make guilt to be the same with desert. Though I confess he may be called, 1.
Guilty of deserving punishment, that has deserved it. As he is 2. Guilty of
punishment, that is obliged to it; and he is 3. guilty of the fault simply
considered, who did indeed commit it.
Distinguish of these three well, and you will also be the better able to
understand some dubious application of the Reatus simplicis, et reatus culpae,
which you after here meet with. As to c. 18. n. 4. p. 33. I conceive that it
is not the tenor of the Gospel, but the law of nature that obliges believers
to punishment for a gross sin; and so it does for the smallest; that this
obligation is a making him guilty of death in general, but not of the loss of
former Pardon in specie: And that as Pardon is a Benefit of the new Convenant,
which the old knew not: so the loss of pardon, is a penalty threatened by the
new Covenant properly. Though I suppose God suffers none to fall under that
penalty that were actually pardoned, as to the eternal Punishment.

When Chapter 23. Cons. 17. he dedenyeth Justification to be a change merely
Relative, his Reason is, because it is the same with Remission and Remission is
a real change, viz. not punishing. Ergo, etc. But note, 1 That he explains
himself to speak only of Executive Remission, which is nothing to the other
two sorts. 2. I think executive Remission is not usually called Justification.
And therefore I shall still say, that Justification is but a Relative change.


So Chapter 25. Cons. 19. where there is mention of Guilt in heaven, I conceive the
word can mean no more then that the Saints did deserve Gods wrath: and whether
that be a proper sense of the word Guilt, or usual, I must leave to wiser
Lawyers then my self.

I do not take these or any the like obscurityes or inprefections to be a
sufficient reason to quarrel with the labors of this Reverend man, much less
to deprive the Church of the benefit of them. Nay I hope it is no small gain
that many will receive by it: (so far am I from damning, exploding, or
contemning every thing that has somewhat disagreeable to my opinion Doubtless
it must needs be very useful to ordinary Christians to see the nature of pardon
more plainly, and to see such clear Reasons for a Necessity of our daily
praying for pardon, yea for pardon of the same sins that were before pardoned;
and to see Providential, Castigatory Punishments so well reconciled with the
fullness of Christ's satisfaction for the same sins; and to see such full
Evidence for a necessity of holy fear and working out our savaltion, yet
without ascribing any merit unto man; to see the Reason of the necessity that
the promise of our continued and final Justification should be on the condition
of our perseverance, and so that continued and final Justification be but
conditional; and this not only consistent with the certain perseverance of
the Saints, but also the ordinate rational means of their perseverance; to see
the imperfection of that Remission and Justification which we have in this
life, beyond all reasonable exception manifested; with many the like points, I
conceive will have much influence on men's affections and practices, and free
them from some mistakes that do no whit befriend their Graces, nor a Godly
life. But I must from experience advise the Reverend Author to expect the
offense of some, the bitter censures of others, and perhaps to be scorned and
snarled at, if not be worried by some of the fautours of the Libertine sect, or
some that make a trade of voluminous Disputation; if they find him not in
their rode, they may seek him by a Digression: and such men are never out of
their way. If I may advise him, unless they convince him of some mistake to be
revoked, he should hear them as if he heard them not, and never think of
wording it with them, but suffer them to ease themselves without Contradiction,
and leave the success of his Labors to God. The Lord pity his poor,
divided, imperfect Church, and acquaint the Guides with the Necessity of its
Unity, and those Principles which have a tendency to the healing of our
breaches, and power out more adundance of the Spirit of Illumination, Concord
and purity, that with one (and that a Pure and Charitable) Mind and Mouth, we
may Glorify God. Amen. Thus daily Prays

Of forgiveness of Sin.
1 JOHN 1.9. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us
our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.


CHAP. I. An Introduction to the whole.
IN these words we have the Great Mystery of Godliness [Mercy and truth met
together, Righteousness and Peace kissing each other.] We have in it the pith
and marrow, the sum and substance of the blessed Gospel of Jesus Christ Gods
manifested in the flesh; the several parts whereof having gone through
Sermon-wise in the ordinary course of my Ministry, I shall only transfer
from thence into these sheets of paper what I have delivered in that way [with
the addition of sundry particulars, which since that time have come into my
thoughts] concerning the Nature of forgiveness of sin; and this I intend to
do [(...)] in a direct, but copious answer to the following Question, or
Questions.

What is Forgiveness of sin? Or, Quest.
what is it for God to forgive us our sins?

In order to the resolution of this very material Question, and from the right
resolution whereof much light (as I think) will be let into sundry
controversall points now depending in Divinity, if I should [by way of proeme,
or premisall] tell the Reader, that in sin there are several things
considerable ( e. g. Matter, Form, Guilt, Blot, or Stain) as some among the
Shoolemen and our modern Divines have done, I should thereby in likelihood
rather amuse the Reader, then expedite the matter. Waving therefore that
course, I shall go a more plain way to work, and such as is more suitable
both to the capacity of the undertaker, as also of every ordinary Reader, as
follows.

That we may not labor (i. e.) deceive, or be deceived in that kind of
fallacy, which Logicians style Fallaciam (...), supposing that to be single,
which indeed is complicate; I mean, supposing that to be one Question, which
indeed is two, take this Praecognitum, viz. That it is one thing to enquire,
that is evermore meant by Forgiveness of sin in the language of Scripture,
and another thing to enquire, what is thereby meant in this text of the
Evangelist and the Apostle St. John: these being indeed two such Questons, as
will not admit of one and the self same answer, as will be made (I think)
most evidently apparent in the procedure of this present Exercitation, or
undertaking.

Now in order to the joint resolution of both the said Questions proposed, I
shall in the first place set down much of that variety of phrase whereby
forgiveness of sin is notified; set forth, or expressed in the writings both
of the Old and New Testament: which said expressions I will sort into Negative
and Affirmative; and would have set them down in their several columes one
over against another, that we might (...) take view of them both together: but
the narrowness of the several pages will not permit Take them therefore as
they follow, beginning with the Affirmative in the first place.

CHAP. II. The various phrases whereby Gods forgiving sin, and his not
forgiving sin are intimated and expressed in Scripture, which said phrases of
both kinds are sorted into Negative and Affirmative.
The Affirmative phrases, whereby forgiveness of sin is held forth in
Scripture, are such as these, viz.

GOds covering of sin, Psalm 85.2. Thou have forgiven the iniquity of thy
people, thou have covered all their sin. His blotting them out and hiding his
face from them, Psalm. 51.9. Hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine
offenses. His purging them away, Psalm. 79.9. Purge away our sins for thy
Names sake. And Psalm. 65.3. As for our transgressions, thou will purge them
away. So Ps. 51.7. Purge me with hysop (i. e.) Wash me from the guilt of sin
with the blood of the Messiah, which blood of his was tipifyed by the blood of
the Paschal Lamb; which, according to the command of God in the Leviticall Law,
was to be sprinkled upon the people with a bunch of hysope; whence it is, that
the blood of Christ is styled the blood of sprinkling, Heb. 12.24. His casting
them behind his back, Esa. 38.17. Thou shall cast all my sins behind thy
back, says Hezekiah. His putting away our sins, 2 Samuel 12, 13. The Lord has
put away thy sin, says Nathan to David. His taking away our sins, 2 Samuel
24.10. Take away the iniquity of thy servant, says David; in which form of
words the Church is taught to pray to God for pardon, Hos. 14.2. Take with you
words, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquity. His
subduing sin and casting it into the depths of the Sea, Mic. 7.19. He will
subdue our iniquities, and thou will cast all their sins into the depths of
the Sea. His healing our sin, Hos. 14.4. I will heal their backslidings, I
will love them freely; which words are a direct answer, and as in Terminis
terminantibus, unto the Churches petition formed in ver. 2. Take away all
iniquity and receive us graciously. So Jer. 3.22. Return you backsliding
children, and I will heal your backsliding. His healing (as the sin, so) the
sinner Isa. 53.5. by his stripes we were healed. And Joh. 12.40. Lest they
should be converted and I should heal them, (i. e.) forgive and save them. His
washing and cleansing us from sin, Psalm. 51.2. Wash me thoroughly from mine
iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. Thus does the Prophet Jeremy both use
and interpret the said phrase of cleansing from sin, chapter 33.8. And I will
cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me, and
I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they
have transgressed against me. So also in the N. T. 1 John 1.7. The blood of
Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin; and in this sense I should
understand the phrase in the text [and to cleanse us from all unrighteousnesse]
viz. as importing one and the self same thing with Forgiveness: for albeit
Sanctification does frequently go under the name of cleansing (as in Psalm.
119.9 and Jam. 4* 8.) and albeit remission of sin and sanctification do always
go together in the same subject, in which regards we may warranttably
interpret the phrase to be meant of Sanctification in this text; nevertheless
I should choose to interpret it rather to be all one with forgiveness, not
only because forgiveness of sin does often go under that name, and because it
is ordinary in Scripture to express one thing by two words, or phrases; but
more especially because our cleansing from unrighteousness is in the text
promised as a merit, not commanded as a duty. Now I take it for a Rule, which
will generally hold true, That where cleansing from sin is enjoined as a duty,
Exceptio non tollit, sed firmat regulam.
we are thereby to understand Sanctification, or holiness of life; but where
it is promised as a mercy, there we are to understand it by Justification, or
forgiveness of sin. But as for this, let every one abound in his own sense.

I proceed. Gods forgiving us our sins is styled his passing by our sins,
Mich. 7.18. [Who is a God like unto thee, who pardonest iniquity and passest by
the transgression?] His removing our sins from us, Psalm. 103.12. As far as
the East is from the West, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
His being merciful to our sins, Heb. 8.12. I will be merciful to your
unrighteousness. And (as to the sin, so) to the sinner, Luke 18.13. Lord be
merciful to me a sinner. Psalm. 51.1.

Have mercy upon me, O Lord, have mercy upon me. The Negative phrases whereby
Forgiveness of sin is held forth in Scripture, are such as these; viz.

Gods not imputing sin, Psalm. 32.2. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord
imputes no iniquity. In this form or phrase does Shimei, having played the part
of a notorious Delinquent against David his Liege Lord, pray for the pardon of
his offense, 2 Samuel 19.19. Let not my Lord impute iniquity unto me. His not
remembering our sins. Psalm. 25.7. Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my
transgressions, says the Psalmist. The like phrase did Shimei use in the case,
and to the purpose aforesaid, saying, Neither do thou remember that which thy
servant did perversely, the day that my Lord the King went out of Jerusalem. His
not remembering our sins against us: Psalm. 79.8. O remember not against us
former iniquities. This phrase does somewhat explicate the former, Gods not
remembering of our sins, not being his simple forgetting them, or simply his not
remembering them; but his not remembering them; Quoad hoc, or, against us. His
not mentioning our sins unto us: Ezekiel. 18.22. His not laying our sins to our
charge: 2 Timothy 4.16. Where Saint Paul praying God to pardon the sin of those
that did desert him under his trial of persecution, says, I pray God it may
not be laid to their charge. So Saint Stephen prays for his persecuters,
saying, Lord lay not this sin to their charge, Act. 7.60. That prayer being in
full sense all one with that of our Savior for those that did murder him by a
Law, saying, Father, forgive them. Only let it be noted concerning the two last
places, viz. 2 Timothy 4.16. and Acts 7.60. that albeit the phrase in the
Translation be all one (both being rendered, A not laying sin to the charge of
the sinner;) nevertheless the phrases in the Original are diverse, the former
being [(...),] which does properly signify to be reckoned, or imputed, and is
so rendered, Romans 4.22. Where Abraham's faith is said, (...), To be imputed to
him for righteousness; and in the latter place the phrase being [(...),] which
word does properly signify, to stablish or to fasten; q. d. Fasten not this
sin upon their backs, or, upon their score. God not entering into judgment with
us: Psalm. 143.2. Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord.

I shall in the next place set down such phrases as do hold forth the
non-forgiveness of sin, or Gods not forgiving us our sins (because contraries
do help to illustrate each other;) which said Phrases I shall sort likewise
into Negative and Affirmative, and will set them down in the same order as I
have done the former.

Affirmative phrases, which do hold forth Gods not forgiveing us our sins are
such as these, viz.

Gods remembering our sins, Hos. 9.9. He will remember their iniquity Jer.
44.21. The iniquities of your fathers, did not the Lord remember them, and came
they not into his mind? His setting of our sins continually before him. Ps. 109
14.15. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord, Let them be
before the Lord continually. Gods visiting sin, or for sin. Hos. 9.9. He will
remember their iniquity. He will visit their sins Jer. 9.9. Shall I not visit
for these things? His covering with anger and persecuting the sinner, That
covering whereby pardon of sin is expressed being a covering with love.
Lam. 3.42, 43. we have rebelled, thou have not pardoned, thou have covered
with anger, and persecuted us. Gods retaining sin: John ^0 33. Whosoever sins
ye remit, they are remitted, and whosoevers sins ye retain, they are retained.
The sinners bearing his iniquity, which is a phrase frequently used in
Scripture, especially by the Prophet Ezekiel, and by him also explained to be
the sinners bearing the punishment of his iniquity, Ezekiel. 14.10. And they shall
bear the punishment of their iniquity.

With many other the like passages, or expressions of both sorts (as well
negative as affirmative) which I suppose may be found in Scripture; concerning
both Gods forgiving and his not forgiving sin.

Negative phrases, which do hold forth God not forgiving us our sins, are such
as these, viz.

Gods not covering, his not blotting out, his not purging away sin. Neh. 4.5.
Cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before
thee. 1 Samuel 3.14. The iniquity of Elies house shall not be purged with
sacrifice nor offering for ever. Gods not holding guiltless, in the the third
Commandment, Exodus 20.7. and 1 King. 2.9. where David admonishing Solomon not
to pardon Shimei, bids him not to hold him guiltless. Gods not clearing, or
Acquitting the sinner, Exo. 34.7. He will by no means clear the guilty. Nah.
1.3. He will not at all acquit the wicked. His not forgetting sin. Amos 8.7.
The Lord has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely, I will never forget any
of their works. His not accepting the sinner: Jer. 14.10. The Lord does not
accept them, he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. Suitable
to the phrase of Gods not accepting the sinner is that phrase in the New
Testament of Gods not knowing the sinner, Mat. 25 12. the direct contrary being
Gods receiving the sinner graciously, Hos. 14.2. Take away all iniquity and
receive us graciously. Gods not turning away the punishment of the sinner; a
phrase frequently used in the first Chapter of Amos, where God threatens such
and such persons and Places that because their transgressions were iterated and
multiplied, He would not turn away their punishment.

CHAP. III Reasons and Grounds for the said variety of phrase, or various
expressions, together with rules for a right understanding and due
interpretation of them.
COncerning the said various expressions of the pardon of sin, let two things
be observed or considered.

1. The ground or reason of them, which said ground or reason seems to be taken
from that variety of phrase, whereby sin, and the fruits or issues of sin are
set forth and signified in Scripture: for according to the various names or
titles given to sin, and the effects thereof, such are the various names or
expressions of Gods pardon or not pardon of sin. For example, As sin is styled
filthiness or uncleanness 2 Cor. 7.1. Romans 6.19. So the pardon of sin is
styled, washing, cleansing, covering, purging away. As sin is the souls
sickness or disease (in which sense some Expositors do understand that in Psalm.
103.3. Who forgiveth all thy sins, and heals all thy diseases.) Or as sin
does wound the sinner, so pardon is styled Healing. As sin makes us guilty, so
the pardon of sin is styled, Gods not imputing it, his not laying it to our
charge; and his not pardoning us, is said to be his not clearing us, or holding
us guiltless. As sin makes us wretched and miserable; so pardon of sin is
styled Gods being merciful to the sin or sinner. As sin is styled a Debt,
making us liable to God in such sort as Debtors to their Creditors, so Gods
pardoning mercy is said to be his blotting out our sins, and casting them into
the depths of the sea. And in this sort (allusive) the Apostles phrase in the
Text, which is now before us, seems to be (the express word being (...), a
word most frequently used by other of the Evangelists and Apostles) which word
does signify to dismiss, leave, let alone, absolve, send away, release, or set
at liberty ( Mat. 4.20 and 18.27.) being twice used in one verse, Luke 4.18.
though it be rendered in different English words; viz. Deliverance, and setting
at liberty. It seems to be a Metaphor taken from those who are loosened from
their bonds, or delivered out of prison, into which they were cast for their
Debts, or misdemeanors. To proceed, As the sinner by committing sin does (as it
were) arm his sin against himself; or as sin has a power accrewing to it, (as
I may so say) to do us mischief by virtue of the Law's commination (for which
cause the Law is said to be the strength of sin, 1 Cor. 15.56.) so Gods
pardoning sin is said to be his subduing our sin, or giving victory to the
sinner over his sin, 1 Cor. 15 57. Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory,
through our Lord Jesus Christ. As sin makes us obnoxious to Gods hatred and
abhorring; so Gods pardoning the sinner is said to be Gods gracious receiving
the sinner, Hos. 14.2. Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously. And
contrarily, Gods not pardoning us, is said to be his not accepting us.

2. Let it be observed and considered, that the most of the said various
expressions are allusive Translations, or metaphorical; being spoken of God
after the manner of men, in them Deus humanum dicit, God does condescend to our
capacity, he does (...) (to use the Apostles phrase, 1 Cor. 4.6.) he does in a
figure transfer the said things and expressions from us to himself, whereby to
assist us in our weakness; e. g. it being usual with men when they do forgive
to forget; God therefore forgiving sin is said not to remember it; and it being
usual with men, when they threaten to be revenged to say to their adversary,
Well, I Will be sure to remember you, I Will never forget this injury and affront
so long as I live: Gods not pardoning therefore is said to be Gods not
forgetting sin, or his remembering sin

Again, Men when they do forgive being moved with inward pity and compassion,
as was the father of the Prodigal upon the sight of his relenting Son: Gods
forgiving us therefore, is said to be his having compassion on us, Mic. 7 19.
Gods compassion Quoad terminum, or terminative, is the self same with
forgiveness of sin, but being considered connotative, it does farther intimate
the rise of pardon, or the inward moving cause, together with the external
occasion thereof, viz. Man's misery and Gods free love and mercy, Gods compassion
being verbum con-significans.

This latter particular being duly observed and considered, it will appear, how
wary and cautious we should be in the Interpretations of the said Metaphorical
phrases, and how needful it is therein to observe the Apostles rule in another
case; viz. (...), Romans 12.3. We must beware how we do in our conceptions about
the said phrases, supra sentire, that we do not understand more in them then is
fit, or in reason possible to be understood; we must be careful not to sense
them above their scope and intendment, but ever to interpret them in a modest,
moderate, and sober sense: that the words may be the words of truth (as indeed
they are) the sense must be the sense of soberness. For want of observing of
due caution in the sober construction of the said phrases, it may (in a sort)
be said unto many a one, as to him in the Poet,

Quem recitas men's est, O Fidentine, libellus,
Sed male dum recitas, incipit esse tuns.
Thus may the Lord say unto many amongst us, who do misconstrue such
metaphorical phrases (as Gods casting sin behind his back, his blotting it out,
his not remembering it) stretching them beyond their due scope and intendment,
and (as it were) gathering that in and from them, which God never strawed; viz.
The words as uttered by me are my words, and true Scripture, but as over-sensed
and misunderstood by you, they are your own, and no part of any Scripture of
mine.

Quest. What Rules are to be observed, for the safer, better and right
understanding of the foresaid Metaphorical phrases?

Answ. These three.

1. The like rule, which is given us for the sensing of Parables and
similitudes, is here to be observed; and that is, to observe their true scope
and intendment; and not (...) (as is the Apostles word 2 Cor 10.14.) not to
wretch and tenter them beyond that scantling, or to stretch them beyond the
measure of their said scope and intendment. Its a common saying, Similitudo non
currit quatuor; and as the learned Stegman does learnedly express it,
Parabolae nihil probant ratione circumferentiae, sed tantum ratione centri; the
like may be said concerning the foresaid expressions, If we respect them in
their circumference, and in such a latitude of sense as they sound to our ears,
they prove nothing, the sense of them being to be confined to their center,
(i.e.) their bare scope and drift; that look how really a man forgives an
offense when he has forgotten it, so really does God forgive.

2. We are here to interpret, as Saint Paul elsewhere directs us to prophecy;
viz. (...), Romans 12.6. according to the Analogy of faith, and so as that the
said phrases may hold proportion and correspondency with other Scriptures. This
indeed is a general rule to be observed in the expounding of any place of
Scripture; and it is in the present business especially to be made use of,
viz. to compare Scripture with Scripture, and to make the sense of one
Scripture coherent with another, and to preserve the harmony of the whole; that
so, all Scripture being (...), breathed by God (as the word signifies 2 Timothy
3.16.) we may not make God to utter hot and cold with the same breath; I mean,
to speak contradictions, or to be contradictious to himself.

3 We are to calculate (as I may so say) our sense and constructions of the
said phrases according to the meridian of the Divine Nature: I mean, we are to
construe them in no other sense, then the Essence Nature, and Properties of the
Godhead or Deity will permit. It is an old and good rule given by one of the
Greek Fathers ( Theodoret, as I remember) that those things which are spoken of
God, (...), are to be understood (...); Those things which are spoken of God
after the manner of men, are to be understood in a sense becoming God,
condecent of, or to his divine properties and excellencies.

These rules are the rather to be observed, because of their consequence. I
mean the momentous consequence of observing or not observing them: For as the
careful heeding of them, is a special preservative that our Table become not a
snare to us; I mean, That our conceptions of God and the things of God be not
occasionally perverted by those very expressions which were intended of God as
means to help and assist our understandings touching him and them; so the
not-observing of them is one main cause, as I am persuaded, of much error in
those of the Antinomian party, who do hold, in a sense most intolerable and
blasphemous, that God sees no sin in Believers whose sins are pardoned; and
that he does not in any sort remember them: of which I shall have occasion to
speak more particularly and largely afterward.

CHAP. IV. What forgiveness of sin is not, laid down in four negative
Propositions.
HAving intimated (as Chap. 1. in the way of Proeme, or Preface) that sacred
phraseology or varity of phrase, whereby forgiveness of sin (together with its
contrary, viz. non-forgiveness) is expressed in the sacred Scriptures both of
the Old and N. Testament.

I will in the next place set down what is (as to me seems) the true
resolution of the matter in question, and this I will endeavor to do, (...),
declaring, 1. Negatively, What the pardon of sin is not. 2. Affirmatively: What
it is, according to the true scope, purport, or intent of the aforesaid various
expressions.


For the former then, be it known.

1. Gods pardoning a sin, or sinner, is not his freeing the sinner from the
very fact of sin. Not so: for this is impossible ex natura rei; it is (I say) a
thing simply impossible, implying a palpable contradiction. What is once done,
can never be undone, or rendered not done. That which is once past, cannot by
the power of God be made or rendered not past; in so saying, I would be
understood in sensu compositiva: for although whatsoever is done or past, might
by the power of God have been prevented; and in such a divided sense might
never have been done, or come to pass; yet being once done and past, it cannot
be undone, recalled, or rendered not come to pass it being a flat
contradiction, that a thing should be done, and not done, past and not past,
come to pass, and not come to pass.

2. It is not Gods freeing a sinner from the fault of sin; i.e. the faultiness
and sinfulness of sin: It is not Peccata non peccata facere, or Peccata pro
non peccatis habere (taking the phrase according to its simple and absolute
import, and not with a quasi or tanquam, which does much qualify and alter the
sense of the expression). I say, Pardon of sin is not so to be taken, for this
also is impossible, ex natura rei, and does implicare, involve a contradiction;
viz. That a fact should be faulty and not faulty, a sin and not a sin: for take
away sinfulness from a fact, and it does no longer remain sinful. It is
therefore to be observed, That a sin pardoned is as well a sin, yea, as much a
sin; i.e. every whit as sinful as ever it was before the pardon of it. When a
Prince or State does pardon a Delinquent, or Malefactor, they do not, yea they
cannot thereby make them of Delinquents no Delinquents, or of Malefactors no
Malefactors. To clear one ( e. g. an accused person) from the fact or
faultiness of the fact wherewith he is charged, is one thing; and to pardon a
person so accused, is another. God by doing the latter, does not do, and
therefore cannot be said to do the former. When a sinner therefore is pardoned,
we must not conceive that he is thereby made innocent again.

3. Gods pardoning a sin or sinner, is not his freeing them from the simple
guilt and desert; I mean, their guiltiness and deserving of punishment. I use
these latter words to explain the former; For though the word, Reatus, or
Guilt, be a word much in use both in Authors and in our Sermons, yet is it
(...), ambiguous and of doubtful construction, being sometimes taken for the
deserving of punishment, and sometimes for the punishment it self deserved, and
sometimes for both. Yea, in such various senses I take the word to be used in
the Text, at least in the Translation of sundry Scriptures. For example, Number.
35.27. Where it being laid down as a Law, That if the Revenger of blood finding
the manslayer without the borders of the city of Refuge, shall there kill the
slayer, he shall not be guilty of blood; that is, as I conceive, he does not
deserve or incur the desert of punishment, neither shall he suffer for it.
Deuteronomy. 21.9. Where God commanding that the City-Inhabitants next to any place
where an unknown murder was committed, being commanded to offer a certain
peculiar Sacrifice, Prove. 30.10. Lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty:
i.e. Lest thou sin, and suffer deservedly; otherwise the curse causeless shall
not come, and is not therefore to be feared.
God does there promise, that they shall put away the guilt of innocent blood
from among them; that is, (as I conceive) the punishment which the shedding of
that innocent blood did deserve. Levit. 5.5. where it being declared in what
special cases a soul should be guilty, I conceive, that by guilt there is
meant, as sin it self, so the deserving of punishment.

However I may be mistaken in the exact sense of the forenamed Scriptures,
(about which I list not to contend with any men of a contrary mind) yet sure I
am that the word Guilt as commonly used, is sometimes taken for the bare
deserving of punishment, and sometimes for the punishment it self deserved,
which two the Schoolmen do usually distinguish, the former being by them styled
Reatus Simplex, simple guilt, and the latter Yet not as excluding, but as
including the sinners obligation to punishm^^^ of which more distinctly I shall
speak by and by. Concerning Guilt taken in these two senses; ( viz. for the
deserving of punishment and for punishment it self deserved) let the Reader
observe, That when we commonly say, That the guilt of our sins was imputed unto
Christ, that saying must be understood, as guilt is taken in the latter sense,
but not in the former; viz. for the punishment, which we for our sins (and not
he upon any such account) did deserve.
Reatus redundans in personam, guilt running over from the sin upon the sinner.
Now I say That Gods pardoning a sin or sinner is not his freeing it, or the
sinner from the simple gu^lt, bare desert, or deserving of punishment.

For, 1. As was said concerning the foregoing particulars, so it may be said
concerning this; viz. That it does implicare, import a contradiction; namely,
That a sin should be an offense against Gods Law, threatening punishment, and
yet should not deserve the punishment threatened by that Law. As sinfulness, so
guiltiness of punishment is impossible, ex natura rei, to be separated from
any sin or sinner; I mean, the saying in a compound sense; e. g. Though it was
possible to the power of God to have prevented a sinner from becoming a sinner,
and so from becoming guilty of, or deserving punishment; yet it is impossible,
that he should be made in such a sense not sinful, as not to have incurred the
desert of punishment; and as in it self considered, not still to deserve
punishment. I say, in it self considered: for (as I shall have occasion to
speak by and by) we are to distinguish betwixt punishment as deserved by sin,
or by the sinner in himself, or by it self considered; and betwixt duenesse of
punishment to the sin or sinner, as considered with reference unto satisfaction
made for it.

2. In the pardoning of a sin or sinner, it is no way necessary for the benefit
or behoof of a sinner, that God should free the said sinner (were such a
freedom in its own nature not impossible) from the simple guilt or deserving of
punishment: for such a sinner may be altogether freed from suffering his
deserved punishment, though he be never freed from deserving the suffering of
that punishment. Yea, a sinner may in such sort, and as much be freed from
suffering the punishment, which he has by his fins deserved, as if he had
never committed any sin whereby to have deserved such punishment; as is, and
will be manifested in the experience of the glorified Saints, who
notwithstanding their sin and desert of sin, are or shall be (...), Equal to
the Angels, who by sin did never incur the guilt or desert of suffering. And
therefore touching such a freedom or freeing the sinner from the deserving of
suffering, (he or his sin being in themselves considered) I say, Cui bono?

Caution. We are carefully to distinguish (as was before intimated) betwixt the
simple demerit of sin, or a sinner deserving of punishment by his sin, as
considered barely in himself, or in his sin; and betwixt duenesse of punishment
to the person of the sinner, as considered with respect to his interest in the
satisfaction which Christ has made for the pardon of sin: for notwithstanding
the demerit of sin, or a sinners deserving of punishment be never taken away,
yet upon some extrinsecal account or consideration (such as is the satisfaction
made by the Redeemer) duenesse of punishment or obligation to suffer
punishment, may be taken away from the sinner, as shall by and by be declared,
when I come to show Affirmatively wherein the pardon of sin does consist.

4 For God to pardon a sin or sinner, is not for God (to speak simply and
absolutely) not to see or behold the sin, or not to see and behold the person
as a sinner, or for God to take no notice or knowledge at all of a sin, or of a
person as a sinner: for this likewise is impossible. For albeit the pardon of
sin be expressed by his covering it, blotting it out, hiding his face from it,
casting it behind his back, (the meaning of which phrases shall in due place be
interpreted) nevertheless we may not construe such expressions concerning a
bare, simple, and infinitive knowledge or sight in God. For whatsoever has
been, or is, in such sort as it is or has been, the eye of the All seeing God
does, and cannot but behold or take knowleng of it, Prove. 15 3. And what I say
concerning Gods not seeing the same; I say, and in a like sense, concerning
Gods not remembering sin; viz. That the pardon of sin does not consist simply in
Gods not remembering it, as if (to speak simply and absolutely) God had utterly
forgotten it, this also being a thing impossible, as to the nature of Almighty
God, who as he has had from all eternity the knowledge of whatsoever will be,
so he will have unto all eternity the knowledge of whatsoever has bin, there
being with God, or as to his eternity, neither prius nor posterius, and
consequently there being no difference betwixt Gods knowledge, foreknowledge
and remembrance, saving in order to the object only, but not to any act of
Gods: so that as his knowledge and fore-knowledg is not opposed to post-science,
so his remembrance of things is not opposed to his former knowledge; but as his
foreknowledge does signify only a futurity of the object, so his remembrance
signifies the object to be past or as past; so that as Gods fore-knowledg is, a
knowing that such a thing will be, which is not (not a knowing that such a
thing is which is not) so Gods remembrance is a knowing, that such a thing was,
which albeit being past, it now is not: nevertheless it is no more possible
for God not to remember, or not for ever to know that once it was, then it was
possible for God not to know that it would be before it was, or that once it
was when actually it was. Gods knowledge, foreknowledg and remembrance, are al
of them knowledge in praesenti, though not de praesenti; his fore-knowledg
being a knowledge de futuro, and his remembrance de praeterito. So that to take
away the remembrance of any thing from God is to deal with him ((...), to use
the Apostles phrase, Romans 12.18. if possible as much as lies in us) even as the
Philistims dealt with Samson, viz. to put out the eyes of God; i. e. the eye of
his knowledge, and to bereave him of his Omniscience.

CHAP. V. What forgiveness of sin is, laid down in two Affirmative
propositions, together with the explication of them.
2. AS for the second part of my intended answer, I answer Affirmatively, viz.
That Gods pardoning a sinner is, his taking off the finners obligation to
punishment, and consequently in due time the punishment it self; I have thus
defined forgiveness of sin as taking my aim from that which is contrary to
it, viz. Guilt as guilt is taken not in such a sense as in which I before said,
In these two consists that Reatus which Schoolmen call Reatus redundans in
personam, viz. In a sinners obligation to punishment; and in his actual
suffering of that punishment to which he was obliged: having therefore before
said, that Reatus redundans in personam, is with the Schoolmen a Sinners
suffering his deserved punishment, I would be understood not as excluding, but
as including a sinners personal obligation to the suffering of such
punishment. And here let me offer this to the observation of the Reader, viz.
That as in some respect the sinner is said to make himself guilty, ( viz. in
respect of simple guilt or the bare deserving of punishment;) so in respect of
guilt redundant, or the actual suffering of the punishment it self deserved,
God is said to make him guilty, for which see Psalm. 5.10. where Gods making the
wicked guilty, is interpreted to be his destroying the sinner.
that it is impossible to be taken away; but as it may be taken, and as it is
usually taken in a second sense, 1. for Obligation, to punishment, in which
sense many do define Guilt, saying, Reatus est obligatio ad poenam.

2. For the punishment it self inflicted, to which we were obliged, in both
which senses it is taken in Scripture, and particularly in that Speech of
Abimelech to Isaac, Genesis 26.10. What is this that thou have done unto us? One
of the people might lightly have lain. With thy wife, and thou should have
brought Guiltiness upon us (i.e.) We might thereby have made our selves liable
or obnoxious to suffering, and accordingly might actually have suffered. Thence
it is, that I define pardon of sin as consisting in these two things opposite
thereunto, and wherein our full liberation, or remission does (as I think,
consist, viz. 1. The taking away, or dissolving the obligation of the sinner to
punishment, which I take to be the terminus preximus, or immediatus of pardon.
2. The denying or taking away, or the not inflicting of punishment it self,
which I take to be the terminus remotus thereof;
I doubt not but we may find in several Authors, as well ancient as modern,
several definitions or descriptions of Forgiveness, and some of them more at
large expressing not only the quiddity or nature of the thing it self; but also
the Author, grounds, causes, effects, ends, consequents, antecedents of it
(all or most of which this text in 1 John 1.9. does minister just occasion to
touch and dilate upon:) but it is beyond my present purpose to meddle with
them, my bare intent by these presents, being to discover and to demonstrate
only, ipsam rei quidditatem, the bare form or naked essence of the thing; what
be the Parts constitutivae, what those things are, which do make up
forgiveness of sin; or wherein the thing it self or nature of it does consist.

I remember the definition which Dr. Twisse gives of it, lib. 1. p. 272. Vind.
Great. saying, Remissio peccatorum, si quidditatem inspicias, nihil aliud est
quam aut punitionis negatio, aut volitionis puniendi negatio: Pardon of sin in
its precise nature is nothing else but either Gods not punishing, or not
willing to punish. Had the learned Doctor by Gods not willing to punish, meant
God disabling the Laws obliging us to punishment, or his taking away our
obligation to punishment, I had gone into his opinion, Manibus, pedibus (as the
saying is;) I had fully, even to a tittle consented with him: but he meaning
thereby another thing, I cannot (but with due respect otherwise to the Learning
and Piety of an Author so renowned) professedly dissent from him: For, by Gods
not willing to punish a sinner (for example, the faithful; for of those he
speaks in the place forecited) he means, Gods electing them to salvation, in
opposition to unbelievers, whom he did from all eternity design to punishment.

To the refuting of this opinion I shall take occasion to speak more at large
hereafter. In the mean time, had the Doctor said only this, That Remissio est
nihil aliud quam puniendi negatio,

1. He had said the self-same thing, and given the self-same description of
forgiveness of sin as Austin and Anselme (those two famous men in their
generations, the one in the list of Fathers, the other of Schoolmen) did of
old, as Zanchy upon this Text does inform me; they saying, Remittere, nihil
aliud est quam non punire: To forgive is nothing else then to not punish.

2. I had yielded my full consent unto that saying as a truth, or a true
description.

3. The saying being understood or interpreted, as it ought to be, viz. not as
excluding, but as including, and presupposing the taking away the obligation to
punishment, I should have yielded my assent unto it as a full truth, or as a
full description of pardon; the taking off a sinners obligation to punishment
being the terminus proximus, and Gods not punishing being the terminus remotus
of pardon; of pardon (I mean) as actively taken; for in these two terms, or
things, does consist the very nature or quiddity of pardon, as it is taken in a
passive sense, which said pardon as passively taken is the (...), the state of
the Question, or the very thing upon which Gardo praesentis controversiae
vertitur: and in this sense I would be understood, whenever I shall in the
progress of this Discourse assert pardon of sin to be nothing else but Gods
not punishing; viz. As pardon is taken in a passive sense; and as Gods not
punishing does presuppose or imply Gods taking off the obligation to punishment.

And let the aforesaid description serve as a direct and full answer to the
first Question propounded; viz. What is meant by forgiveness of sin evermore
in the language of Scripture? And for proof of the truth of the said
description; as a direct and full answer to the foresaid Question, I need not,
as I presume, to say much more then has been already said concerning that,
which in Scripture is made the direct opposite to pardon; viz guilt (Gods not
pardoning a sinner, being said to be Gods holding the sinner guilty, or not
guiltless.) Neither need I to instance in any particular Scriptures for the
proving of it: it being sufficient to say, That look in what place of Scripture
soever God does promise pardon to the sinner, or the sinner does beg pardon of
God, still there is meant in the sense both of God and man, Gods not punishing
the sin or sinner, either Gods forbearing, or his surceasing to punish, in the
sense as was aforesaid. The like also I say concerning all such places of
Scripture, wherein God does declare himself to have pardoned any sin, or
sinner.

I shall only add two or three particulars as in the way of Caution, and for
the right understanding of the said description.

1. When I say that pardon of sin does consist in dissolutione obligationis ad
poenam, in dissolving the obligation to punishment, I must not necessarily be
understood of all manner of punishment, and de praesenti, for the instant,
present time; but either de praesenti, or de future, either for the present or
for the future: for albeit God pardoning the sinner does dissolve the
obligation to punishment, and does thereby confer upon the sinner Jus ad
liberationem, a right to impunity; nevertheless this right to freedom from
punishment may be for present only from a part of punishment, and so not a
plenary freedom; but not from all punishment save only de future, for the
future, as I shall have occasion afterward to demonstrate.

2. When I say, That pardon of sin does consist in a dissolution of the
obligation to punishment, I must not be understood necessarily, and always
concerning an absolute, but either an absolute or conditional dissolution. For
I take remission of sin in this life to consist only in a conditional
dissolution of the obligation; I mean, full remission, or remission as to all
manner of punishment; the condition hereof being our perseverance in the faith
and fear of God: for as a sinner is not actually remitted and discharged or
disobliged from punishment but upon the condition of his faith, repentance, etc
so neither is this discharge or disobligation continued, but upon the condition
of perseverance. Though a Believer be actually disobliged from punishment
immediately upon his believing, and though the full and final pardon of such a
one, be never so certain in respect of the eternal purpose of God, and in
respect of the purchase of Christ, (God having purposed and Christ having
purchased for them grace, to persevere) yet is it but conditional in the
Covenant of Grace, or promise of the word. This seems to me apparent by the
description of that person to whom God does promise fully and finally to
pardon: for which see Rev. 2.17. To him that overcomes will I give a white
stone: in which Scripture, observe two things: 1. What is meant by the thing
there promised under the name of a white stone? viz. Absolution or pardon, the
sign being put for the thing signified: the Apostle alluding in that
expression to the custom of the Romans, with whom a white stone was a sign
of absolution, as a black stone of condemnation. 2. To whom this absolution is
promised; viz. To him who does overcome, or persevere.
It is a vain thing to except, that perseverance is only a qualification in a
person, or the qualification of a person to whom pardon shall be continued, or
who shall fully and finally be pardoned: for, whatsoever is such a
qualification, has the nature of a condition, without which the mercy shall
not be continued, and perfectly enjoyed. It appears likewise by the express
promises and threatenings of the Word; for which see, Heb. 3.14. For we are made
partakers of Christ, if we hold fast, etc. 2 Timothy 2.12. If we suffer for him,
we shall reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us. Ezekiel 18.24. But
when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits
iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that a wicked man does,
shall he live? All his Righteousness that he has done shall not be mentioned,
in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in
them shall he dye. Although the common saying of our Divines be (as I believe)
a true saying, [Peccata non redeunt,] yet I do not believe it to be true
otherwise then upon supposition; viz. of a Believers perseverance in Faith and
Obedience: otherwise to what purpose is that admonition, 2 John 8. Look to your
selves, that we lose not the things which we have wrought? And that admonition
to the like purpose, Rev. 3.11. Hold fast that which thou have, that no man
take thy crown? And otherwise, why should God threaten to deal with Apostates,
as with that wicked servant, whose doom we find recorded, Matthew. 18.32. O thou
wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desinedst me,
should not thou also have had pity on thy fellow servant as I had pity on
thee? And his Lord was wroth, etc. I know what some do here except, saying.
That the scope only of a Parable is Argumentative; and the scope of that
Parable is not to show, That a sinner may forfeit the benefit of his former
pardon by relapsing into, and persisting in new sins; but only to manifest,
That forgiveness of others, is a necessary qualification to be forgiven of God,
or a necessary condition without which God will not forgive us. Unto which I
answer, That look as forgiveness of others is a condition without which God
does not at the first vouchsafe actual forgiveness to any person, so the
continuance of that forgiveness on man's part, is a condition of the continuance
of forgiveness on Gods part, or a condition without which God will not forgive
him at the last. I do willingly believe, That God uses these and the like
conditional comminations, as a And ergo, I think those do deserve to be blamed,
who are so zealous for the doctrine of the Saints perseverance, as they will not
patiently suffer even those who do hold the said Doctrine of Perseverance, to
use all such means as God has appointed to be used, and which God does
sanctify for that end, among which I doubt not, but this is one; viz. To
inform the Saints, that their sins are not absolutely pardoned in this life,
but conditionally, or upon the condition of their perseverance; and that
therefore they are to fear hell and damnation no less then others, unless
they hold that fast which they have: (of which said fear I shall speak more at
large in Chap. 26.) whereupon I cannot but profess my opinion, how (I think)
that the foresaid persons are so affected in their zeal, that they do much
disservice both to God and his Saints, as taking a direct way to confute the
Doctrine of the Saints perseverance, and to overthrow that in practice which
they do labor to uphold in Doctrine; I mean, they do take the ready way to
cause the Saints to Apostatize.
sanctified means for the perseverance of the Saints in the faith and fear of
God: and therefore it is in no sort agreeable unto my intent to urge those and
the like Scriptures to prove the Apostasy of the Saints; but only thereby to
prove, That the continuance of our pardon in this life is but upon the
condition of our perseverance, in which respect it is not absolutely, but
conditionally in this life enjoyed.

3. There being several sorts and degrees of punishment; viz Punishments in
this world, and punishments in the world to come; look how far forth, or in
what sense God does forbear to punish, so far forth, or in that sense, or with
respect to that kind or degree of punishment, but no further to be understood,
God in Scripture is said to pardon. Let this be observed the rather, because it
will (as I verily think) serve as a clue or key to unlock and lead us through
diverse intricacyes and ambiguities of phrase, where the pardon of sin is
mentioned in Scripture, which said ambiguities I shall in the following
Chapters, as in their due place specify.

CHAP. VI. The various senses or significations wherein forgiveness of sin is
taken in Scripture, it being taken in four several senses, but most commonly
and signally in one sense; and what sense that is, declared.
1. GODS forbearing, or ceasing to punish sinners with temporal punishments, is
styled his pardoning them, Number. 14.19. Pardon I beseech thee (says Moses) the
iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy mercy, as thou have
forgiven this people from Egypt even till now. What was Gods forgiveness of
the people from Egypt until then, but Gods sparing of them in regard of
temporal judgments, either not at all inflicting them, or after a short time
removing them? So Psalm. 85.1, 2, 3. where Gods forgiving the iniquity of his
people is interpreted to be Gods taking away all his wrath, and turning
himself from the fierceness of his anger. And contrarily Gods punishing
sinners with temporal punishments, is styled, his not pardoning them, Lam.
3.42, 43. We have transgressed and rebelled, thou have not pardoned: Thou have
covered with anger and persecuted us, thou have slain, thou have not pitied,
There Gods not pardoning them is interpreted to be his plaguing them with
temporal judgments.

2 Though God does not wholly forbear to punish, or wholly take off the
temporal punishment of sinners, yet if he does punish with lenity or
moderation, or make some commutation of the punishment (to use the term of the
Civil Law) this said moderating or commuting is said to be Gods pardoning: And
no wonder; for it is truly and really pardon; viz. in its kind, Quomodo libet,
taliter qualiter, in a diminutive sense, or with respect to punishment in part
and in some degree. Thus Psalm. 78.38. Gods being full of compason, and
forgiving their iniquities, is expounded by that which follows; He destroyed
them not, and did not stir up all his wrath. See also for proof of this, Numb.
14.20, 21, 22, 23. compared with ver. 12. by the due consideration of which
place of Scripture it will appear, That Gods not instant or sudden
dis-inheriting, or destroying the whole body of the people as one man, and
their whole race (according to the tenor of the threatening, ver. 12) is styled
his pardoning them, ver. 20, notwithstanding that God did otherwise, and in
part punish very many of them for their sin of murmuring; viz. so far forth as
to debar all those from ever enjoying the Land of Promise who had seen his
miracles in the house of bondage, Caleb and Joshuah excepted. Thus Gods sparing
David's life, and not taking him away by sudden death (making as it were a
commutation of the child's life in stead of the life of the parent) is styled by
Nathan, Gods putting away or pardoning his sin, albeit God did in the mean time
sundry ways, even to his dying day, punish him for those sins; which albeit
they might well be said to have been put away, in respect of sudden death not
inflicted; yet were they not so put away in respect of certain other
punishments which he suffered. Yet in this saying I would not be so understood,
as if I did confine the meaning of the Prophets absolution in those words,
[Thou shall not dye] to a temporal death, for that instant time: for as a
sudden temporal death was not the only, or the greatest evil doubtless, which
David then feared, (rebus sic stantibus) so I am persuaded, that freedom from
such an evil was not the only, or chiefest good, which God therein and thereby
did promise.

3. Gods suspending his judgments, and reprieving sinners (as I may so say) or
his delaying to punish them for the present time, whether with sudden death, or
with some other notorious, dreadful, exemplary judgment, is styled his
pardoning them: and no wonder, for it is truly so; viz. pro tempore, in a
diminutive sense: and so long as it is to last according to the purpose of God.
This I take in part to be the meaning of Numb. 14.20 where God says, he had
pardoned them; viz. pardoned them for that time, as appears in that he does in
the next words threaten, that he would take a time to punish them; and that in
such sort as whereby to make his power and his justice the more glorious
throughout the world. In this sense elsewhere God is said to pardon those
sinners (the self same Nation as before was instanced in) at one time, on whom
he took vengeance at another (as appears by comparing Psalm. 99.8 with Exodus
32.34) yea whom he does threaten with certain vengeance at that very time, when
it is said, That he repented of the evil which he thought to do unto them,
(that phrase, Gods repenting of the evil, importing the self-same thing with
remission of sin, as I shall demonstrate in due place) Exodus 32.34. with v. 14.

These three kinds of pardon, or Gods pardoning a sinner any of those three
said ways, I may style ( docendi gratia, and for distinctions sake, from
pardons in the sense immediately following) pardon (...), and (...), improper,
or improperly so called, they being but pardon of the half blood ((...)) in
that they are not produced of the self same seed; i.e. of the self same
electing and redeeming love of God in Christ, as does the true heir; I mean
that kind of pardon which I am in the next and last place now to set down.

4. Gods taking away from a sinner the obligation unto, and his forbearing to
punish sinners with eternal damnation, is styled his pardoning sinners, or
forgiving them their sins. This kind of punishment is variously styled in
Scripture; e. g. That wrath to come, 1 Thessalonians. 1.10. Damnation simply, John
5.29. Eternal damnation, Mark 3.29. The damnation of hell, Matthew. 23.33. The
damnation of the devil, 1 Timothy 3.6. The time when it shall be suffered is said
to be the world to come; and as for the place where, it is said to be Hell, or
the lake which burns with fire and brimstone. Rev 21 8. Marc 5.29.
Now because this last kind of punishment is the worst of all and chief of
punishments that are threatened to sin and sinners (it being the punishment not
only of the body, but also of the soul, and that both easelesse, endless, and
remediless) therefore is the pardon of sin with respect to freedom from this
kind of punishment, more especially and principally styled pardon, or pardon
(...), or (...), for as this last punishment is the king of punishments (to
allude unto that expression of Job, chap. 18.14. so this kind of pardon may be
styled the king of pardons. And in this sense (chiefly I mean, but not
exclusively) the word is taken in the tenor of the New Covenant, recited, Jer.
31.34. Heb. 8.12. where God promises to forgive our inquities, and remember
our sins no more. And so likewise most commonly in the wrirings both of the Old
and New Testament, passim. And in this sense (chiefly, I mean, but not
exclusively) it is to be taken in the present Text.

And that may serve for a direct and positive answer to the second Question;
viz. What is meant by forgiveness of sin, in the present Text, or texture of
the Apostle Saint John? Only let it be remembered, that I have inserted this
parenthesis as emphatically to be observed, [chiefly I mean, but not
exclusively] for I do not think that that promise of forgiveness is altogether
exclusive of, or does altogether And therefore (to speak my sense more fully) I
may say of pardon in this last sense, That it is Gods taking away from a sinner
the obligation to all kinds of punishments, proceeding from his pure Justice,
his delivering sinners from all such punishments, more especially from the
damnation of hell, it being the chiefest of punishments, which God in Justice
does threaten to sinners.
exclude all manner of mercy unto, or all kind of freedom of the sinner from
temporal punishment in this life: and that upon the following Grounds or
Reasons.

1. Because, albeit the pardon of sin is not necessarily to be understood as
consisting in the disobligation of a sinner from suffering of all manner of
punishment, de praesenti, but either de praesenti, or de futuro (as was
aforesaid;) nevertheless, God may be, and sometimes is pleased of his
superabundant grace to vouchsafe unto a penitent sinner at once, as a discharge
or disobligation from eternal punishment; so likewise actual freedom from such
temporal sufferings as his sin had brought upon him, according to the tenor of
that promise, James 5.15 Wherein the Apostle promises, That the prayer of
Faith, should at once prove an effectual mean, whereby the sins of the sick
party should be forgiven, and his body also cured of, or restored from his
sickness. How many of Gods servants have reason to call upon their souls to
bless God, who at once, or at the self same time has forgiven their sins, and
healed their diseases, as in Psalm. 103.3. and for that reason to call not only
upon their souls, but also upon their bodies and bones to praise God; as in Ps.
35.10.

2. Though God does not always do so, but taking off the obligation of the
sinner from suffering the torments of hell hereafter, does chastize or punish
him with a kind of hell here, (as David and others even to their dying day have
been punished) nevertheless such temporal punishments, or chastisements, are
evermore,

1. Moderated from that degree, which otherwise would have been, as appears by
2 Samuel 12.13. Isai. 27.8. Jer. 10.24. and 47.28. Which said moderation of
punishment may in a sense be called pardon, as was aforesaid; viz. Aliquousque,
and in some degree.

2. Sweetened with the influences of comfort from God, his holy Word and Spirit;
God informing them in his Word, that his end in punishing them is upon the
maine their non-condemnation, according to that in 1 Cor. 11.32. and that no
suffering whatsoever in this life shall separate them from the love of God in
Christ, justifying them from their sins; according to that triumphant challenge
of the Apostle, Romans 8.35. Who shall separate u^ from the love in Christ?
Shall, etc.

3 Sanctified by Gods grace, and turned to good, according as is witnessed
abundantly in the Scriptures, Isai. 27.9. Romans 8.28. Heb. 12.11. And as in
these and the like respects, the temporal punishments of all penitent and
believing sinners do differ from the temporal punishment of Reprobates, who
shall be damned for their sins; even so for the same respects or reasons, or
Eatenus such penitent sinners may be said to be pardoned as to, or in regard of
temporal punishments.

Thus have I set down, wherein (according to my present thoughts and according
to truth, as I hope,) the nature of forgiveness of sin does not, Though all
pardon be of God, in which respect Remissio Juris is Remissio Judicis,
nevertheless that does not hinder, but that pardon may be distinguished into
Juris and Judicis, because this latter is pardon in sensu famofiori, in a more
notable and signal sense; Even as in Logic though Omnis materia be immanens,
yet may materia be distinguished into immanens and transciens. Now pardon of
sin, as it consists in taking off the obligation to punishment being by the
power of Gods word or Law; and as it consists in taking off the punishment it
self, it being by the Word of his power, I think therefore that this latter may
be styled Remissio judicis, it being effected by the hand of God, as the other
by the Word or Law of God.
and wherein it does consist, it consisting (as was aforesaid) in these two
things, 1. In a sinners discharge from the obligation of the Law to punishment.
2. In his actual impunity or immunity from punishment: in Gods not binding him
by his Law to punishment, and in Gods not actually inflicting punishment upon
him.
The former of these I may call Remissio Juris, pardon in Law Title, or in the
sense or title of Law; the latter I may style Remissio Judicis, the pardon of
the Judge: for albeit that Remission of sin which we shall receive at the day
of Judgment and not before, be commonly styled by Divines (as I think) Remissio
judicis, in way of contradistinction from the Remission which we have in this
life, and which they style Remissio legis or Juris; nevertheless, seeing those
two do alike differ, as do Right or Title to a thing, and the actual possession
of the thing it self, and seeing it is the hand or power of God that must put
us into the actual possession, or that must give us the actual enjoyment of
that which according to his will revealed in his Law, Word, or Promise we have
Title or Right unto; these things (I say) considered, I think I may not unfitly
distinguish the said part of pardon by the name of Remissio juris and judicis.

The premises considered (as well what has been spoken in the Negative, as in
the Affirmative part of my Answer to the said Questions) I shall from thence
make these following Deductions or Conclusions, as necessarily resulting from
them, whether as jointly or as severally considered.

CHAP. VII. That a Reprobate may be said in some sense, even in a Scripture
sense to be pardoned, and how?
CONSECTARY I.
1. THere is a sense of Scripture with respect whereunto those who shall be
damned may be said, yea in Scripture are said to be pardoned; viz. with respect
to some kind or degree of temporal punishment, either wholly forborne and taken
off, or else suspended and delayed for a time.

CHAP. VIII. That a sinner, notwithstanding his pardon (upon the main) may and
often times does suffer temporal punishments for his sins, together with an
Answer to several Objections, wherein the distinction betwixt chastisements and
punishments is examined, and how far forth allowable, declared; wherein also
the true differences betwixt the sufferings of the Godly and the wicked are
asserted and proved, and the false ones, (commonly assigned) are rejected and
refuted. That the Saints may and oft-times do in this life suffer for their
sins, Christ's satisfaction notwithstanding, proved and cleared. In what sense
God does, and in what sense he does not remember the sins of Believers, laid
down in sundry Propositions, Affirmative and Negative; wherein likewise is
declared, what difference there is betwixt Gods remembering the sins of the
Godly and of the wicked, as also betwixt his remembering the sins of Believers
under the Old Testament, and the sins of Believers under the New Testament.
CONSECT. II.
2. A Sinner may be said to be pardoned; viz. upon the main, and with respect
to everlasting punishment in hell, from the suffering whereof he may be for the
present altogether disobliged, though he be not discharged from suffering of
all or all manner of punishments temporal and de praesenti, which
notwithstanding his pardon upon the maine, he may suffer in some measure, yea,
in a very great measure, and that to his dying day, yea, and in a sort after
his death, so far as a man being dead is said to suffer in his posterity (he
being a parent) or in his subjects (he being a Prince) as the sad experience of
many of the Saints recorded in Scripture, does witness beyond exception,
specially of David, Solomon, and Manasseh. 2 Samuel, 12, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14. 1
King. 3.13, 14. and chapter 11.11. 2 King. 24.3. And in that respect the sins of
the Saints, though pardoned upon the maine, may be said not to be pardoned,
viz. as to those temporal punishments which they did suffer; and in this
respect it is expressly said concerning the sins of Manasseh, (however pardoned
upon the maine, and as to eternal punishment, as is generally and upon good
ground conceived) that he would not pardon them, 2 King. 24.3, 4. Surely at the
command of the Lord, came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for
the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did. And also for the innocent
blood that he shed, which the Lord would not pardon.

Object. The sufferings of the Saints are not punishmens, but chastisements?
and chastisements are not punishments, properly so called?

Ans. 1. What difference soever there is between punishments properly and
improperly so called, It seems clear to me, that Scripture does not distinguish
the sufferings of the Saints, and of the wicked, by the name of chastisements
and punishments, their names being of promiscuous use in Scripture. For,

1. The sufferings of the Saints are frequently called punishments, and the
righteous God in his Word is said as well to punish the godly as the wicked
with some kind of punishments, for which see Amos 3.2. You have I known above
all the nations of the earth, therefore will I punish you for all you (...)
iniquities. Ezra 9.13. Thou have punished us less then our iniquities do
deserve, Lam. 3.39.

Object. Those Scriptures are spoken of the whole Church, in which were wicked
as well as godly?

Answ. God is said not to leave the remnant of the godly in the Church
altogether unpunished, Jer. 46. last. and 30.11. and what is that but in part,
or in some measure to punish them, as appears by comparing the forecited
Scriptures with Isaiah 27.8. and Jerem. 10.24.

2. How often are the punishments of the wicked styled chastisements? See Psalm.
94.10. He that chastises the Heathens, shall not he correct? The punishments
which were inflicted upon Pharaoh, and the plagues of Egypt are called
chastisements. Deuteronomy. 11.2, 3. I speak not with your children that have not
known and seen the chastisement of the Lord your God, his greatness, his
mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, and his miracles, and his acts which
he did in the midst of Egypt. See also Hos. 7.12. and 10.10. Jer. 30.14.
Specially see Lev. 26.28. where the last punishment of all which God threatens
for their final obstinacy, as seven times greater then all the former, is
styled by the name of chastisement. And the sufferings of Christ which were
punishments in a very proper sense, are called chastisements, Isa 53.5. The
chastisement of our peace, i.e. the punishment of our sins in order to our
reconciliation was upon him. So that it does not appear that there are any
such distinct words in the Scriptures of the old Testament (the one signifying
or being rendered chastisements, the other punishments) whereby to express the
different sufferings of the godly and the wicked, nor can it be made appear
(for ought I know) that there are any such words in the New Testament, as does
in this sort difference them. For albeit Aristotle does distinguish betwixt
such sufferings as are inflicted for the sake of the sufferer, and such as are
inflicted for the sake of the punisher, calling these by the names (...) the
former by the name (...): nevertheless I am most assured, that the sufferings
of the godly and the wicked, are not by these names distinguished in the New
Testament; for I find therein, that the everlasting punishment of the wicked
in hell, are expressed be the word (...) for proof whereof, see Matthew* 25 last,
and 2 Pet. 2.9. where teh words translated punishment, and to be punished, are
(...).

If any one shall ask me whether I do blame our Divines for their usual
distinguishing the sufferings of the godly and the wicked by the names of
chastisements and punishments.

I Answer, albeit I think it our duty as near as we can, to speak Scripture
sense in Scripture words; nevertheless, lest I might seem captious, I would
not condemn those who have differenced them by the aforesaid words; yet with
these Salvoes and Provisoes: 1. Provided that they impose not upon me or
others, a necessity of distinguishing them by those names, as names distinct,
or of distinct use and signification in Scripture.

2. Provided that as I leave them to their liberty, so they leave me to my
liberty, and not blame me, who shall choose rather to keep close to the
language, as well as the sense of Scripture in this matter, and to distinguish
rather betwixt punishments and punishments, then betwixt chastisements and
punishments.

3. Provided, that under the foresaid names, they vary not from the sense of
Scripture, making such differences between the sufferings of the godly, and
the wicked, as Scripture does not make, or will not warrant; which last proviso
is the rather considerable; because there are some, I mean, not only
Antinomians, but others also, who in their explication of the differences
betwixt chastisements and punishments, do difference them in such sort, as the
Word of God will not (for ought I know) allow. E.g. Undertaking to define, or
state the differences betwixt punishments properly and improperly so called
(which latter they style chastisements) they tell us, that chastisements are
inflicted a Deo Patre, not Judice, by God not as a Judge, but as a Father.
Whereas I think, that the sufferings of the godly, are inflicted by God both as
a Father and as a Judge also, for why otherwise are such sufferings styled
judgments? or why else should the Saints in so suffering, be said (as indeed
they are) to be judged of the Lord. 1 Cor. 11. ult. Isa. 26.8. In stead
therefore of saying that the sufferings of the Saints are inflicted by God,
Tanquam patre, non judice, I should choose to say rather, Tanquam judice
patrizante, they being paternall judgments, or fatherly punishments.

2. Whereas some say that the punishments of the wicked are for sin, but the
chastisements of the godly are from sin; I find no such difference warranted in
the word, the contrary thereunto being plainly therein asserted, viz. that God
does punish the godly, for, or because of their sins. 2 King. 24.3. Surely at
the command of the Lord, came this upon Judah, for the sins of Manasseh, and
also for the innocent blood which he shed, 2 Samuel 12.14. Howbeit, because by
this thy deed, thou have given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to
blaspheme, the child also that is borne unto thee shall surely die. 1 Cor.
11.30. For this cause many are sickly among you, and many sleep. Rev. 2.4. I
have somewhat to say unto thee, because thou have left thy first love. Yea I
add, that the temporal punishments of the wicked are not only for, but also in
some sense from sin, in that the use which they ought to make of them is their
repentance and amendment, unto which God does as by lively voice call them; for
otherwise we cannot well conceive how the obstinacy and impenitency of men
should be aggravated by Gods judgments. Thence that expression Mic, 7.9. Hear
the red: yea, one special intent or end of Gods inflicting judgment on some
wicked men is, that all the wicked may take warning, or that they may hear and
fear, and do no more so wickedly. Deuteronomy 17 23. thence did the heathen resemble
Gods judgments to thunder and lightning, the end thereof being thus, viz. Vt
poena ad paucos, terror ad amnes perveniat.

3. Whereas some distinguish betwixt chastisements and punishments, saying,
that these do proceed from the wrath and justice of God, but those only from
his love: I see no warrant for such a difference, seeing Scripture does plainly
tell us, that the sufferings of the Saints are inflicted by an angry God, and
by virtue of the justword and threatening of God. For what reason else were
there for the Saints under sufferings to acknowledge the displeasure and
justice of God, as frequently we find they did, and according as it was (no
doubt) their duty to do. See Ezra 9.13, 14. Dan. 9.12, 13. Neh. 9.33. And why
else is the wrath of God said to be kindled against his own people, and in
special against Aaron the Saint of the Lord? Deuteronomy. 9.26. in stead therefore of
saying that the sufferings of the wicked are inflicted by Gods wrath and
justice, but of the godly by his love; I should choose to say, that the
sufferings of the wicked (comparatively with the sufferings of the godly) do
proceed from pure wrath and justice; but the sufferings of the godly from wrath
and justice mixed with fatherly love and mercy: I say (comparatively with the
sufferings of the godly) the sufferings of the wicked do proceed from pure
wrath and justice; for if we compare the sufferings of the wicked here, with
their sufferings in hell, I suppose, that we cannot say, that their sufferings
here do so purely proceed from Gods justice, or from his pure justice in such
sort, as do their sufferings in hell; and that for the reason aforesaid, viz.
because their repentance and amendment is one gracious and direct end of their
sufferings, of many of their sufferings, at least in this life. And because
what I have here delivered, is objected against by the Antinomians: I shall
endeavor to clear and vindicate the same from their exceptions and
objections, as follows.

Ob. Christ has fully satisfied Gods justice, and how then can the sufferings
of the Saints proceed from his justice, or for sin?

Ans. The sufferings of the Saints and Christ's perfect satisfaction for sin,
are not incompossible, but may very well stand together; the coexistance
whereof, that it may the better appear, the following answers are (to me)
considerable, and as I hope, will prove as to my self, so to others,
satisfactory.

1. Notwithstanding the sufferings of the Saints are from Gods justice, yet are
they not for the satisfaction of his justice in any such sense as Christ's
sufferings were. Had the sufferings of the Saints been inflicted by God, and
endured by them, for the satisfaction of divine justice in such a sense, the
objection had been of considerable force, not otherwise. Now I say, the
sufferings of the Saints are not either inflicted by God, or endured by the
Saints, to satisfy Gods justice in any such sense, as wherein Scripture
affirms Christ's sufferings to be alone satisfactory, i. e. the sufferings of
the Saints are no part of that (...), or price, whereby a propitiation and
atonement is made for sin and sinners. And let it be noted, that herein we
differ from the Papists, who do make the sufferings of the Saints in such a
sense satisfactory to Gods justice, as whereby they derogate from the
all-sufficient satisfaction of Jesus Christ.

2. The procurement of this privilege, viz. that the Saints should not at all
suffer for their sins in this world, was not a thing intended in or by the
satisfaction of Christ; so that in calling into question how far forth, or
unto what intents and present effects, the satisfaction of Christ was intended
by God and actually to avail. I say, in calling this into question, we cannot
reasonably be thought to impeach the perfection of Christ's satisfaction. And
let it be observed, that I speak concerning the effects and fruits of Christ's
satisfaction according to the intention of himself and of his Father. For
albeit there be never so much intrinsecal worth or value imaginable in the
sufferings of Christ, (I exclude not his active obedience from all ingrediency
into his merits) I conceive, notwithstanding, that his sufferings did not
satisfy by a natural necessity, but by reason of the voluntary compact, and
agreement betwixt God and him, and consequently that he satisfied for no other
intents and purposes, then were agreed upon betwixt them.

Q. What did Christ by his satisfaction (according to compact betwixt him and
his father) procure and purchase for, or in behalf of the Saints?

Answ. 1. Negatively, not an actual present immunity from all manner of
suffering for their sins, or that they should be so far privileged as not at
all, or in no sort to be punished for their sins in this life; neither did
Christ make or undertake to make satisfaction, neither did God the Father
accept of his making or undertaking to make satisfaction for any such intent
and purpose.

2. Affirmatively, The Lord Christ by his satisfaction did procure for the
Saints a discharge and deliverance, ( viz. at, in, or upon their believing, or
when they become believers) from wrath to come, at the great day of judgment.
1 These. 1.10. This he did procure as the direct end and fruit of his
satisfaction, and consequently, or as a second end he did procure for them a
right unto, and in due time an actual enjoyment of an inheritance eternal in
the kingdom of heaven; God the Father being so over and above (as I may so
say) well pleased with his Sons satisfaction, as by reason thereof, not only to
deliver the Saints from that wrath to come; the desert whereof by sin they had
incurred; but moreover to grant unto them an immortal crown and inheritance
within the kingdom of glory, which for degree, is commonly thought to be a
greater felicity then Adam, if he had stood, should have attained unto.

2. Christ by his satisfaction did procure for them the sweetning, moderating
and sanctifying of all their sufferings in this life, and the delivering of
them from all those cursed effects, which the said sufferings are of themselves
apt to work and occasion, and which actually they do work or occasion in the
wicked; these evil and cursed effects of sufferings being that from which
Christ in the days of his flesh, did pray to the Father to keep the
disciples; but not altogether from suffering it self, no more then he prayed
to God to take them out of the world, John 17.15. Briefly as Christ was a
voluntary surety, and his Fathers free gift, so was his satisfaction (however
most perfect, yet) a In saying that Christ's satisfaction, being considered
abstractly, was a refusable satisfaction, I mean, only this, viz. that it was
freely and voluntarily accepted by God the Father
refuseable satisfation, if it be in it self, or in its abstracted nature
simply considered; and therefore as it was in Christ's own choice, whether or no
to have made satisfaction, and in the Fathers choice whether or no to have
accepted it (for God the Father might have chosen whether or no to have sent
his Son, and the Son might have chosen whether or no to have come into the
world, and to have taken our flesh) so may they choose how far forth, or unto
what intents and purposes this satisfaction shall be paid and accepted; which
said intents, effects and purposes are, and are not, as is aforesaid, in the
Negative and Affirmative part of my answer to the foregoing Question.

3. I answer to the objection in the third place, that Gods being satisfied
with Christ's sufferings, may be understood two ways, 1. In respect of the
surety and the value of his payment as being the full value of what his justice
required, and more then which he required not at his hands. 2. In respect of
the Debtour, the sinner, and the effecting of his complete and universal
freedom: and in this latter respect, God was not upon, by, or with Christ's
satisfaction or payment, so well pleased or satisfied, as immediately thereupon
to grant unto the sinner a complete, actual, and universal freedom from all
manner of suffering for sin; the denying or not granting of which said present,
immediate and universal freedom, does arise not from any imperfection in
Christ's satisfaction, which imperfection is to be made up by the sufferings of
the Saints, but from the mutual compact betwixt the Father, and the Son, to
have it otherwise to be, as is aforesaid.


4. Or in answer to the Objection, I may distinguish betwixt the satisfactory
price, which Christ did pay for our redemption from all suffering for our
sins, and betwixt our enjoyment of the fruits and benefits of that
satisfactory price, or saisfaction. The former, viz the price paid by Christ,
was most perfect; but our enjoyment of the benefits fruits, or effects thereof,
is not perfect presently, and at once, we enjoying the benefits thereof
pedetentim, piecemeale, some at one time, some at another; some in this world,
and some of them in the world to come. And I shall therefore add that the
inflicting of temporal punishments upon the Saints for their sins, or Gods not
vouchsafeing such a privilege to the Saints as in no sort to suffer for their
sins in this world; this I say, is no more against the perfection of Christ's
satisfaction, or Christ's perfect satisfaction against it, then is Gods not
perfect sanctifying his people in this world; he suffering the remainders of
corruption to abide and work in their natures so long as they live in this
mortal body.

Whenever the Antinomians shall prove, that God is obliged by the perfection
of Christ's satisfaction in no sort to punish the Saints for their sins in this
world; they will prove that God is alike obliged, perfectly to sanctify, and
immediately to glorify the Saints at the first moment of their believing and
converting; seeing the sanctification and glorification of the Saints is as
well a fruit, effect, and benefit of Christ's perfect satisfaction as is their
justification, or their freedom from any temporal punishment.

Ob. When God does pardon a sinner, he is said to remember his sins no more,
Heb. 10.17. And how then is it true, that God may, or does punish the Saints,
or inflict any suffering upon the Saints for their sins?

Answ. I have already declared in what sense this expression (Gods not
remembering the sins of his people) cannot be understood; but because this is so
usual an objection with the Antinomians, and in their conceit a kind of
invincible Goliath; or as they mean, unanswerable Argument; I call the
forgetfulness of injuries an imperfection in men. For albeit as generally
considered it be a virtue, and so no imperfection, yet as considered
physically, it may be styled an imperfection; for such is all manner of
forgetfulness in a physical consideration.
I will therefore make a more large answer thereunto, as follows.

We are to know, that the phrase is translatitious or Metaphorical, wherein God
is represented under a humane imperfection; which said phrase does import, or
hold forth some such act or acts of grace in God toward those that have
offended him, as do carry a resemblance, proportion, or similitude with those
acts of favor in men, expressed toward those who have offended them, and
whose offenses they are said not to remember. Now that the similitude and
resemblance may not be stretched beyond the bounds of reason, religion, and
Scripture, I will set down, 1. Affirmatively, how far forth God may be said to
remember the sins of the Godly. 2. Negatively, how far forth, or in wha sense
he does not remember them.


For the former. 1. God does so far remember the sins of his people, as to be
displeased with them, and to be incensed against them. 2 Samuel 11.27. David's sin
in the matter of Vriah, is there said to displease God. Dent. 9 20. God is
there said to have been very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him.

2. So far as to check and reprove them for their sins, whereby he would
have them take special notice that he does remember them; and these reproves
God does convey sometimes in a most cutting and convincing way: for proof
hereof, see Rev. 2.4. where the Church of Ephesus is reproved for her
declining. And 2 Samuel, 12.1. Where David is sharply taxed about the matter of
Vriah.

3. So far as to threaten them with suffering for their sins, and that, 1.
Conditionally, except they repent, Rev. 2.5. Remember from whence thou art
fallen, and repent, and do thy first works, or else I will come unto thee
quickly, and remove thy Candlestick.

2. Absolutely, notwithstanding they have, or shall repent. 2 Samuel 12, 13, 14.
where David is threatened with the death of his child (if any one shall say it is
a prediction (to speak properly) rather then a commination, it will make
nothing against the intent and purpose for which I allege it) notwithstanding
his professed repentance, and the Prophets absolution of him (as to the maine
of pardon) in the name of God, related in the foregoing verse.

4. God does so far remember the sins of his people, as actually to inflict
punishment upon them for the same, and that both while they live, and when they
are dead.

1. While they live, and that variously, viz. not only by withholding and
withdrawing those mercies and favors from them, which otherwise would have
been bestowed and continued, but also by inflicting such evils upon them which
otherwise he would not have inflicted, as does evidently appear, and as David
himself did know to his smart and cost. 2 Samuel 12.8, 9, 10.

2. When they are dead, viz. in their posterity, successors and Subjects, they
being Parents Princes, or Sovereigns, as appears undeniably, in the instances
of Eli, Solomon, and Manasses, for which see 1 Samuel 3.13, 14. 1 King. 11.33 and
2, 24, 3, 4. Thus does God so far remember the sins of his people, as to
smite them for the same not only with the rod of reproof, but also with the
reproof of his rod; it being the duty of Gods people under extraordinary
sufferings to take notice that God does thereby remember; or take knowledge of
their sins, as did the widow of Zareptah* by occasion of the unexpected death
of her Son, saying to the Prophet, O thou man of God, art thou come to call
my sin into remembrance, and tr slay my Son, 1 King. 17.18. And if their sins
do not presently appear, its their duty to search for them, and to pray to God
to discover them unto us according to the example of Job, chap. 10.3. and
13.23. Where he prays to God to show him wherefore he contended with him: and
according to the pattern of the Church, Lam. 3.40. Exciting one another to
search and try their ways.

5. If, as there be degrees of grace on earth, so there be degrees of glory in
heaven (as is commonly and very probably conceived.) I see not, but that it may
be affirmed, that God does so far remember the sins of his people,
particularly their backslidings and declinings in grace, after their
conversion, as to deny unto them such an eminent degree of glory in heaven,
which otherwise had they been more circumspect and zealous, they might have
obtained, or had attained unto, they in mean time losing of the fullness of
the reward; to which purpose, that of the Apostle may not unfitly be understood
2 John 8. Look to your selves that we lose not the things which we have
wrought, but that we receive a full reward. But I will not say, that this is
properly to be called punishment.

2. In the next place I am to show Negatively, or in what sense God does not
remember the sins of his people: and for that end be it known,

1. God does not in such fort remember the sins of his people, as he does
remember the sins of the wicked, whom he does not pardon, E.g

1. God does not so remember the sins of his people, as to punish them, with,
or in such pure justice, as he does punish the sins of the wicked; but with,
or in justice, tempered with fatherly love.

2. He does not punish them with revenge merely judicial, or purely vindictive.
I say, revenge merely judicial, or purely vindictive; and let it be observed,
1. What I do acknowledge. 2. What I do deny.


1. I grant and acknowledge, that the punishments which God does inflict upon
his people, are in a sort vindictive, they proceeding from Gods justice, and
being inflicted for sin, (as was aforesaid) and one end of the inflicting
thereof, being to make the Saints to smart; and for that cause I deny not, but
that such punishment which God does inflict upon the Saints for their sins, may
be called and are called sometimes in Scripture vengeance, and for which cause
I do fully assent unto Mr. Ainsworth's Exposition of that in Psalm. 99.8. Thou
wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengance on their
inventions. Where that pious and Learned Textman does interpret by vengeance,
not only the punishment that in process of time, was inflicted upon the body of
the rebellious people; but also what was inflicted upon Moses and Aaron for
their miscarriages, he comparing that of the Psalmist, not only with Number.
14.20, 21, 23. Exodus 32.14, 34, 35. but moreover with Number. 20.12. Deuteronomy. 3*23,
24, 25. in which latter places the punishment which God did inflict upon Moses
and Aaron for their sins is recorded. And here let it be observed, that whereas
some do distinguish betwixt* chastisements and punishments (meaning thereby the
sufferings of the godly and the wicked) saying, that chastisements are not
vindictive. I cannot assent thereunto for the reasons aforesaid, and which I
forgot to insert in its proper place, where I spoke concerning the difference
betwixt chastisements and punishments.

2. I deny, that the punishments of the Saints are revenge merely judicially or
purely vindictive as are the punishments of the wicked: and the reason is
evident, because they proceed not from pure justice; and again, albeit Gods
end in inflicting them be to make them smart for their sins; nevertheless this
end of Gods justice is but in subordination unto other effectual ends of his
mercy or in subordination to other gracious ends, which God will actually
effect thereby; mercy therein rejoicing (as I may so say) against judgment.
Herein the revenge, which God takes upon a penitent sinner, is like to that
revenge which a penitent sinner does sometimes take upon himself, which is not
purely vindictive, but in part; it being upon the maine medicinal and
preventive, 2 Cor. 7.11.

Briefly, whatsoever differences have been, or can be truly assigned betwixt
the temporal punishments of the godly, and the wicked, so far or in such a
sense I do assert, that God does not remember the sins of his people.

2. God does not so far remember the sins of his people as to damn them, or
to punish them in hell for the same, as he will the wicked for their sins.

2. God does not in such sort remember the sins of his people now in times of
the New Testament, as he did remember the sins of his people in times of the
Old Testament.

Quest. How so? and not so?

Answ. Whereas in times of the Old Testament God did daily remember the sins of
his people, as being minded thereof by their frequent and daily sacrifices,
(even as he was minded of his covenant with Noah, in the behalf of all flesh,
by the sight of the rainbow, Genesis 9.12, 13, 14, 15.) and whereas God was put in
mind of their sins by the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ upon the cross, he
does viz. Heb. 10.17
there signify unto them, that he would not remember their sins any more; i.e.
By the Levitical sacrifices, (for Christ's death, the antitype or substance of
those sacrifices being come and accomplished, the types or shadows must now
vanish or give place) not yet by the death of Christ; for it was not necessary,
that Christ should die often; or more then once, he having by himself once
offered, for ever perfected those that are sanctified; and this being one
special difference betwixt Jesus Christ a Priest after the order of
Melchisedec, and those Priests which were after Aarons order, these being to
offer daily sacrifices as memorials of sin, but he being to offer but one, and
that one but once. And this I take to be the true meaning of the Apostle in
that of Hebrews, chapter 10.17, 18. as will (I presume) appear unto any
intelligent reader, who will impartially and without prejudice peruse the text
and context, in which respect I might have spared my large answer, in showing
how far forth God does and does not remember the sins of his people; albeit
as to other purposes and respects, the reader, I think, has no cause to judge
my pains and labor therein to be amiss and needless.

And I shall add as a third consectary and in the next place, how and with
what caution it behooves us to interpret this phrase (God not remembering our
sins) together with other phrases of the like strain or kind recorded in
Scripture.

CHAP. IX. Caution given as touching the interpretation of such Metaphorical
phrases, whereby forgiveness of sin is expressed, that we construe them
warily, and in a sober sense.
CONSECT. III.
3. IT follows, that in all such metaphorical phrases whereby the pardon of sin
is expressed in Scripture, ( E. g. Gods not seeing sin, his not remembering it,
his covering it, blotting it out, hiding his face from it, casting it behind
his back, and the like) we must be wary and circumspect in their construction,
understanding them in a modest, moderate, and sober sense, and not stretching
them (hour they sound) beyond the due limits of their intended meaning, so as
to think soberly of God, of our selves and sins. I have already given certain
rules or directives as touching the right interpretation of such phrases, and
shall need therefore in this place to say the less. Only I shall add what
follows, as a reason or motive to double our caution and circumspection in the
interpretation of the said phrases, by saying, That should we regard the bare
sounds of such phrases, or the phrases themselves barely as they sound, without
a due search into their true scope and sense (which is apparently the fault of
the Antinomians,) we may (besides other monstrous and intolerable inferences)
as well conclude from other Scriptures, where some of the like phrases are
used, that God does pardon all the sins of every wicked man, without any
exception of sins, or sinners, as of any of the godly, seeing it is expressly
said, that God is a God of purer eyes then to behold evil, or to look upon
iniquity, whatsoever, or in whomsoever the iniquity and evil is, Hab. 1.13. The
meaning then of the forecited metaporicall phrases, which do hold forth the
pardon of sin, is this (not to stand upon the school-distinction concerning
Gods seeing, as it is taken in sensu simplici, or modo mere intuitivo, and in
sensu connotativo, or connotante, which to this purpose is both considerable
and satisfactory) viz. That such sinners, whose sins God is said not to see, or
remember, but to blot out, cover and cast behind his back, shall be no more
damned for their sins, then if so be God did not behold them, or had forgot
them. Or that such sinners shall as undoubtedly be saved from there sins, as
from the greatest wrath to come at the day of judgment, as if God had forgot
them, or as if their sins were covered and blotted utterly out of his sight.

CHAP. X. In what sense, or how far forth as true and false, those common
sayings of our Divines [Sublata culpa tollitur poena, and justificatio tollit
omnia poenalia] may or are to be construed and interpreted, and in what sense
to be rejected.
CONSECT. IV.
4. IT follows in what sense, or how far forth as true, and not true; to
understand those common sayings of our Protestant Divines; as well Calvinists
as Lutherans; [ Sublata culpa tollitur poena. And Justificatio tollit omnia
poenalia.]

1. It is most true, that seeing pardon of sin, is the taking off of the
obligation to punishment, and consequently punishment it self, so far forth,
as tollitur culpa, tollitur etiam poena; i.e. so far forth as sin is
pardoned, so far forth the punishment of sin is taken away.

2. As Poena is taken in a like sense with pardon, viz. for punishment, (...),
or in a signal sense, viz. for everlasting punishment, as opposite to life
eternal, or for punishment merely and purely such as are the punishments of the
wicked; so it is most true, Sublata culpa tollitur poena. And in the other
sense, that other (...) is true also, Justificatio tollit omnia poenalia; the
word poenalia being taken in the sense immediately aforesaid.

3. In such a sense as the Apostle asserts, whom God has justified, them also
has he glorified, Romans 8.30. i.e. He has already glorified them in part, and
he will at last and in due time, glorify them fully; and in such a sense we
commonly say, Posita justificatione, ponitur etiam glorificatio. I say, in such
a sense the foresaid sayings [ Sublata culpa tollitur poena, and justificatio
tollit omnia poenalia) are most unquestionably true; i.e. A person justified or
pardoned shall in due time ( citius, serius, sooner or latter, at one time or
other) be delivered from all things penal, or from all punishment due to his
sins.

2. If in the foresaid sayings we take justificatio for our justification
immediately upon, or at our first believing and conversion; and if we take
Sublata culpa in the like sort or sense, then the said sayings will not consist
with the truth of Scripture (as has been made at large to appear) but with
the aforesaid restrictions.

Object. Those sayings of our Divines are alleged by them in the controversy
betwixt us and the Papists, about humane satisfaction for sin by suffering,
and are asserted by our said Divines commonly in the sense aforesaid, which I
do oppose.

Answ. 1. If in this, or in any other particular I do recede from what is
commonly taught by our Divines, I do it with much unwillingnesse, and not
without clear evidence of Scripture (as I think) enforcing me thereunto, and
must therefore in such cases crave leave (salva modestia, et vericunda front)
to appeal from their sense and writings to the sense and writings of the
inspired Prophets and Apostles, submitting the premises to the censure of the
unprejudicate, and impartial judgment of the Churches, according to the
Scriptures.

2. Though I do not acknowledge the common sayings (Sublata culpa tollitur
poena, and Justificatio tollit omnia poenalia) to be true in such a sense, as
many of our Divines have asserted in oppositito the Papists; nevertheless, I
am far, very far from concurring with the Papists in their doctrine about
man's satisfaction to Gods justice, by his own personal sufferings, whether
voluntary or involuntary, and I think, that the said Popish doctrine about
humane satisfactions might very sufficiently be impugned and expugned by other
mediums and Arguments, then by those common sayings, Justificatio tollit omnia
paenalia, and sublata culpa tollitur poena.

3. It is a thing not to be wondered at, that in controversal divinity, a
greater error be impugned with a less, and one extreme with another sometimes.

CHAP. XI. That there is no such thing as Remissio culpae, [remission of the
fault] in way of distinction from Remissio poenae [remission of the punishment]
these two being one, and the self same thing. The four following Chapters do
declare, that forgiveness of sin is a dividual, and not an individual action,
as is commonly supposed.
CONSECT. V.
5 IT follows from hence, that there is no such thing as Remissio culpa, in
way of distinction from Remissio poenae. I say (...) cherish no such thing as
remission of the fault as distinct from he remission of the punishment.

I add this consectary, not only in opposition to the Papists, who do assert,
and use this distinction, whereby to support their Apocriphal doctrine of
humane satisfaction for sin [for the remission not of the fault, say they, but
of the punishment] and consequently to overturne that foundation upon which
they build their said doctrine of humane satisfactions; but also in the way of
humble dissent from diverse of our Protestant Divines, who do in their writings
generally (both Latin and English Authors, such as I have read) I say, they do
generally upon occasion assert, that Christ by his death has abolished or
taken away sin, both in the guilt, and in the fault, that both the guilt and
faultiness of sin is pardoned by God unto the regenerate. I need not say any
thing for the detecting the unwarrantableness of this assertion, more then what
already has been said in those several both Negative and Affirmative
particulars, where we have heard it set down, wherein the forgiveness of sin
does, and wherein it does not consist; and in special, that it does not consist
in taking away the fault of sin, or sin in the faultiness thereof. It is true,
the fault is remitted: but how or in what sense? viz. in respect of the
punishment it self, and obligation to punishment, not otherwise. And as for
that guilt, which is called Reatus culpae, guilt of fault, this we have heard
is not taken away by remission; but only that guilt which is called Reatus
poenae, guilt of punishment. The Schoolmen of old, have much perplexed
themselves about these questions, what manner of act it is in God, whereby he
does remit sin. And seeing the act of sin is transient, what is it that is
forgiven? Here they Answer, that sin though praeteriit physice, yet manet
moraliter; though sin be past and gone in a physical, yet it remains in a
moral sense; and though it be past in respect of the sinful action, yet it
remains in respect of its sad effects, which sad effects are done away, or
taken away by pardon. But what these effects are, which by pardon are taken
away, they have as touching that, been much divided in their opinion, making a
great stir about Macula, the spot or stain of sin, in the explicating
whereof (as the Learned Wotton relates) they have occupied themselves for the
space of five hundred years, without any agreement or satisfaction, as not able
to declare what it is. But the truth is (as I think) and as has been before
laid down) that the sad effects of sin, which remaining after the sinful
actions are taken away by a pardon, are the obligation of the sinner to
punishment, and punishment it self; the former being styled by some of the
Schoolmen, Relatio rationis, scilicit, ordinatio ad poenam. The premises
considered, It appears, that there is no such thing as the remission of the
fault in contradistinction to the remission of the punishment, and that the
said distinction is a distinction without a difference.

As an introduction to the Consectaries next following, I think meet to give
the Reader to understand, that it is a question much debated among what kind of
actions remission of sin is to be placed or accounted, whether among those
actions which are calls called immanent, or else among such as are styled
transient. And again, since actions transient are subdivided into actions
styled dividual, and individual; it is questioned, whether forgiveness of
sin (if a transient action) be to be reckoned a dividual, or an individual
action. Now as in chap. 22 Consect. 16. I shall undertake to manifest it to be
a transient action, so by the four chapters and consectaries next following, it
will be manifested to be a dividual action, i. e. such an action as has its
progress [per partes] by degrees, and is not completed at the self same
instant; contrary to what is commonly received, it being generally asserted as
a difference betwixt Sanctification and remission of sin, that that is a
dividual, but this an individual action. Now a transient action being the same
with the effect produced; and that which is produced by remission of sin,
viz. the taking off of the obligation to punishment, and punishment it self,
being produced or taken off as it is laid on. viz. per parts, by degrees viz.
as new sins are committed; it seems to me evidently apparent, that remission of
sin is not an individual, but a dividual action, and as will appear by the
Consectaries next following.

CHAP. XII. That the distinction of the pardon of sin, into total, or
partial; perfect or imperfect, is a justifiable distinction.
CONSECT. VI.
6. IT follows, that we may safely distinguish the pardon of sin, (how harsh
and unsavorie soever the distinction may seem in the sound thereof) into
total and partial, perfect and imperfect, into Remissionem magis, or minus
plenariam; for pardon of sin being the taking off of the obligation to
punishment, and consequently punishment it self, a man is no farther pardoned
executive and plenarily, then his punishment is taken off, which being
sometimes more, and sometimes less taken off; we must needs say, that pardon
is sometimes more and sometimes less perfect.

CHAP. XIII. That one and the same sin may be more or less pardoned.
CONSECT. VII.
1. IT follows that one and the same sin may be more or less pardoned,
because it may be more or less punished. And the contrary assertion thereof
though it be the assertion of our Divines, See his book of justif. p. 21. and
19. and 143 and 261.
as I think generally, and in particular of that very learned and pious Divine,
Mr. Anthony Burges [a man for sound judgment and School learning much renowned)
I say the contrary assertion, viz. that one and the same sin cannot be more
or less pardoned, I cannot assent unto; but must needs by virtue of the
premises profess (yet humbly) my dissent from.

CHAP. XIIII. That no sinner is fully pardoned in this life, nor yet before the
day of judgment.
CONSECT. VIII.
8* IT follows, that however a believer is pardoned in this lsfe, yet he is
not fully pardoned til the day of judgment; because he is not till that day of
refreshing, freed from all the sad effects and punishments of sin, viz. death
and the grave of corruption. The premises considered, do also give us to see a
reason of that saying of Christ, Mat. 12 32 And moreover plainly and easily to
interpret the sense of it, he saying, that the sin against the H. Ghost shall
not be forgiven neither in this world, nor in the world to come.
And for that cause the day of judgment may as well be styled the day of
Remission or Absolution, as the day of Redemption, as it is styled Ephesians. 4.30.
And for the same cause does Saint Peter assert, our sins to be blotted out (in
a signal sense, viz fully and completely) at, and not before that Great and
good day of the Lord, Act. 3.19. there being certain remainders of grace to be
brought unto the Saints at, and not before the revelation of Jesus Christ, for
which till that time they are to wait and hope, according to the counsel of the
same Apostle, 1 Pet. 1.13. And in this sense, Saint Paul prays to God, that
good Onesiphorus, with his compassionate household may find mercy with the Lord,
at that day, 2 Timothy 1.16, 17, 18.

CHAP. XV. The difference betwixt remission of sin and Sanctification,
commonly assigned (that being said to be perfect in this life, this imperfect)
rejected and refuted.
CONSECT. IX.
9. IT follows, that the difference commonly said to be betwixt the remission
of our sins, and our sanctification (that the one is perfect in this life, the
other is imperfect) is a plain mistake, and in very deed not a justifiable, but
a pardonable saying, I mean an error that stands in need of pardon, and not of
pardon only, but also of amendment. And (besides the premises) for a farther
detecting and rectifying this mistake, let it be considered, that the self
same reason, which proves the imperfection of our sanctification in this life,
will also prove the imperfection of our remission: for the reason demonstrating
the (...), that our sanctification is here imperfect, is (besides the testimony
of Scripture) the experimental sense of that Fomes peccati, that Peccatum
peccans, or relics of sin, which do still remain in our natures; which said
sin in being both sin and punishment (for which cause it may well be
styled, in a peculiar sense, peccatum puniens, as well as peccans;) it being I
say, both a sin and the punishment of sin, it must of necessity and infallibly
follow from thence (as I humbly conceive) that a sinners remission, or release
from sin, is imperfect also. And if any one shall except, saying, that a
sinner even in this life has right to perfect remission; I answer, look what
right a sinner has in this life, to perfect remission, the same right he has
to glorification, and to sanctification with the Saints made perfect; so that
in this respect there is no difference. Briefly then, If we must believe
either Scripture, or our own experience, we must acknowledge, that our
remission is in this life as well imperfect, as is our sanctification.

CHAP. XVI. That remission of sin does imply somewhat positive, as well as
privative, and for that reason, that it differs not from Justification, as has
been by some supposed.
CONSECT. X.
10. IT follows, that seeing Gods pardoning sin is his not punishing it;
unto which I add (and that which all do acknowledge, nemine contradicente)
that seeing punishments are either privative or positive (if I may be allowed
the latter expression, notwithstanding the common saying, Omne malum est
formaliter quid privativum) but my meaning is, seeing punishments are either
damni, or sensus, of loss, or sense; it will, I say, follow from thence, that
the pardon of sin is not only Ablativa mali, but also Collativa boni, (as the
Schoolmen express it;) or, that the pardon of sin is not only a privative,
but also a positive blessing, and benefit, i. e. it does in the precise nature
thereof, import not only a freedom from the punishment of sense, or from the
bare suffering of pain and torment, but it imports also a restoring of the
sinner to the positive enjoyment of such comforts, or to the enjoyment of such
positive comforts, and to such a state of love, friendship, and favor with
God, as by his sins were lost and forfeited. I speak this in humble dissent
from those who do for this cause make justification to be more then
forgiveness of sin, in that as they say, justification does connote, or
connotate a state of favor, that the subject, or sinner is put into; whereas I
see not, how we can acknowledge any state of favor, which justification puts a
sinner into, which remission of sin does not likewise invest him with, or put
him into, as I shall have occasion to say again, and shall prove more at large
in my progress upon this subject in hand. Only note, that which is here said
concerning pardon of sin, is to be understood not concerning any of those three
sorts of pardon, (which for distinction sake, I styled of the half blood,
those also being (...), nothing to the text in hand) but of that kind of
pardon, which is by the Apostle promised in my present text, (...) so called.

CHAP. XVII. That one and the same sin may be said, and that in a Scripture
sense, to be pardoned, and not pardoned; to be imputed, and not imputed to a
sinner.
CONSECT. XI:
11. IT will follow, that one and the same sin may be said, and that in a
Scripture sense, to be pardoned, and not pardoned; to be imputed, and not
imputed to a sinner; for as much as God in some kind or degree may punish the
sinner for a sin, and yet not in another; or for as much as God may impute the
sin to the sinner for some intents and purposes, E. g. for some kind and
degree of punishment, at least for sometime, and yet not for others, or
always. Thus, or in this sense God, though he did pardon the sins of
Manasses, yet is said not to have pardoned them. 2 King. 24.4. At the
commandment of the Lord came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight,
for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did, and for the innocent
blood that he shed, which the Lord would not pardon.

CHAP. XVIII. The necessity for believers themselves to pray daily for pardon
(according to the tenor of the fifth Petition in the Lords Prayer) asserted
and evinced, as well by Argument as Answer to an Objection; it being withal
more at large, and distinctly declared, what are the particular things which a
believer (according to the tenor of that Petition) is to pray for.
CONSECT. XII.
12. A Ready answer follows from hence, to be made unto those who shall demand
a reason of believers, why they do pray to God, and dare not otherwise choose
then daily pray to the Lord God, according to the tenor of the fifth Petition
in the Lords prayer, saying, Forgive us our trespasses. For seeing that the
pardon of sin does not consist in indivisibile, or in puncto mathematico, or
sicut punctum in mathesi; yea, seeing there is a great latitude in it, and that
we are every day capable of receiving more and more of the pardon of our
sins; i.e. deliverance from the sad issues, effects, and punishments of our
sins; yea, seeing that we shall not receive the plenary forgiveness of our sins
til our dying day, yea, til our resurrection day; we may therefore, yea we must
and ought therefore daily to pray unto the Lord for the pardon of our sins. Now
because the Antinomians do so dangerously err in slighting, yea, decrying this
Petition as vain and needless, to be incessantly made by believers, I shall
offer the following particulars unto consideration, in order to the converting
of all such from the error of their way in that behalf. Be it then considered.

1. That in that Petition we pray, that in the great day of judgment we may
find mercy with God (which I styled pardon of sin in a signal sense)
according to the tenor of the Apostles prayer for Onesiphorus, 2 Timothy 1.18.
Saint Paul doubtless did look upon Onesiphorus as a Saint, as a true
believer, yet did not he think that Onesiphorus stood in no need of such a
prayer, otherwise he would have abstained from making such a request to God in
his behalf, as a taking of Gods holy Name in vain. And I doubt not, but that
Onesiphorus was very glad and thankful to the Apostle for this his prayer;
though it seems that the Antinomians of our times would have conned the
Apostle, or any other, little, or rather no thanks at all for making such a
prayer in their behalf.

Object. Believers have already the pardon of their sins, and God in Christ
is said to have already forgiven them their trespasses. Col. 1.14. and 2.13.
Ephesians. 4. last.

Answ. 1. That is said in Scripture to be already done, and spoken of therefore
in the preterperfect tense, which shall certainly and infallibly be done in due
time; E. g. Romans 8.30. Whom he justified, them also he glorified, i. e. he
will glorify. Thus God is said to have given that grace to the elect, before
the world began, which at that time he did only purpose infallibly to give in
due time. 2 Timothy 1.9.

2. I have already proved that the Saints in this life are forgiven but in
part, and not fully. In such a sense therefore as believers are said to be
already saved ( Ephesians. 2.5.8. By grace ye are saved. 1 Cor. 15.2. by which also
ye are saved. 2 Timothy 1.9. Who has saved us) In such a sense are the Saints
said to be already pardoned, and for the same reasons, or upon the like grounds.

1. Because in part they are already saved and pardoned; pardon and salvation
is already begun in and upon them.

2. Because of that right which they have unto perfect and full remission and
salvation in the kingdom of heaven, or at the day of judgment; notwithstanding
the certainty of which their present right, they are not only to pray, but also
by all due means, to labor for the future actual and full possession of
remission and salvation. So soon as God has made a promise of any blessing,
whether temporal or spiritual to a believer, a believer (I conceive) has right
unto it; (in which sense we commonly expound that of the Apostle, all things
are yours, 1 Cor. 3. last) but what of that? is not a believer therefore to
pray for the actual enjoyment of what God has promised? Yea, is he not the
rather to pray for it for that very reason, even as David did in a like case? 2 Samuel 7.27. God having made a promise to David, what he would do for him and
his house, observe David's words ver. 27. For thou O Lord of hosts, God of
Israel, have revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house;
Therefore (mark therefore) has thy servant found in his heart to pray this
prayer unto thee. And the rather is this considerable, because we cannot
regularly expect that Gods promises shall be accomplished; and consequently,
that we shall ever actually enjoy what we have a present right unto by virtue
of Gods promises, unless we do continue instant in prayer for the
accomplishment of the same, prayer being one of Gods appointed ways or means
for the accomplishment of his said promises, as appears by the Scriptures
passim; particularly by that in Ezekiel. 36.37. having made a promise concerning
the Churches restoration in the foregoing verses, the Prophet adds to prevent
security. ver. 37. Thus says the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of
by the house of Israel to do it for them. See also Jer. 29.11, 12, 13. Though
God did tell them what he had a most assured purpose to do for them, ver.
10.11. (After seventy years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you, and
perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place: for
I know the thoughts that I think toward you says the Lord, thoughts of peace
and not of evil, to give you an unexpected end.) Yet he does intimate unto
them, that the actual performance of this promise should depend upon their
prayers, as the condition on their parts; (yet through his grace freely given)
to be performed. For read ver. 12.13. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye
shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you; and ye shall seek
me and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. This the
Prophet Daniel understood very well (though the Antinomians of these times,
through the just judgment of God do seem so blinded, as not to understand
things of this nature) as appears by his practice, I have heard it as a
tradition that petty Malefactors amongst us condemned to be burnt in the hand,
were to suffer the hot iron til they prayed with a loud voice, God save the
King. And do not the Antinomians deserve to ly under the afflicting hand of God
till such time as they pray with the Psalmist saying, Look up on my affliction
and my pain, and forgive all my sins? Psalm. 25.18.
together with the ground, rise, and reason of it, recorded, Dan. 9. beg.
Because he did know gods assured purpose by his promise, therefore he set his
face to the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication; yea with fasting,
sackcloth and ashes. To seek God by prayer and fasting for the averting of what
God has threatened, seems strange to none; but to seek God by fasting and
prayer, for that which God has promised infallibly to believers, does seem so
strange to Antinonians, as that they account it a thing needless and
ridiculous. May God be pleased of his greatmercy to enlighten and reduce them.

2. Be it considered, that in the said fifth Petition of the Lords prayer, we
pray for forgiveness of sin, not only as to be enjoyed after death, but also
in this life, i.e. that present judgments which our sins might deservedly
bring upon us may be prevented, suspended, moderated, or if inflicted, may be
shortened, sweetened, removed, sanctified, and turned to our benefit: for in
these things (as has been already demonstrated) does consist partly the
forgiveness of sin. Now what intelligent Christian is there, who will not
acknowledge, that they have need of such things as these, viz. the preventing,
moderating, removing, sanctifying of temporal judgments and afflictions?

3. Be it considered, That as the Saints do sin daily more or less; so
their new sins do bring a new obligation to punishment (or else they could not
be accounted sinners, neither could they be pardoned, as needing no pardon)
which said obligation they have need should be taken off by a particular
pardon, besides their first general pardon (for that any sin is pardoned
before it be committed, I shall at large disprove in another Consectary;) for
which said particular pardon a believer is according to his need to pray to
God, he having no assurance from God to obtain either it, or ought else
without prayer; such cause have we to give the like counsel to the best among
the godly, as Simon Peter did to Simon Magus, saying, Repent, and pray to God,
that thy daily sins may be forgiven thee.

4. Be it considered (which I think will generally be acknowledged) that the
sins of believers after conversion, specially their more gross, false, and
eminent backslidings, do subject them meritoriously, to the condemnation of
the law, and to the Else why does God threaten them upon their back sliding
with the forfeiture of their former pardon? Ezekiel. 18.24. Matthew. 6, 15. and 18.
lat. See Mr. Burges of justification. p. 242, 243.
forfeiture of that right which they had to the pardon of former sins by virtue
of the Covenant; and that these new sins do not de facto condemn a believer,
is to be ascribed to the Lord Christ, by whose blood we have an entrance into
the Covenant of grace, and a standing, or continuance in it by his
intercession. Romans 5.2. with Heb. 12.24. and 7.24. by which intercession the
Covenant of forgiveness, or the promise of pardon is continued to be the
believers discharge against all new sins, and the remembrance of old.

Now have not believers need to pray to God that he would not take that
advantage of their forfeiture of former pardon, as justly he might do? Yea,
is it not necessary that they should so do, as ever they do expect that he
should not take the advantage of the said forfeiture? For consider, that as
Jesus Christ does intercede in heaven for the continuance of remission of sin
in the behalf of the Saints, so he does intercede, and actually procure for
them all such grace or graces, as without which their pardon shall not be
continued; thence is he said to be exalted by God, not only to give to Israel
remission, but also repentance, not the former without the latter; yea, first
repentance for sin, and then remission of it. Act. 5.31 Now what ground has
any believer to hope for the continuance of his pardon, except he shall pray for
it; as Christ does continue in heaven, so he shall continue so long as he is on
earth to make intercession for it. I have been the larger in this particular,
not only for the reducing of the Antinomians in this point, and for the
information of certain others, who do think that assurance of pardon is the
maine thing prayed for by believers in that Petition; but moreover, that every
man understanding what he is to pray for, and has need to pray for in that
behalf, may be induced not only the more frequently, but also the more
feelingly and fervently to pray to the Lord for the same.

CHAP. XIX. An answer to the three following questions. 1. Does God always
pardon a sinner instantly upon the confession of his sins? 2. In what sense,
or how far forth does a sinner receive a present pardon, immediately upon the
confession of his sins? 3. Whether a truly penitent and believing sinner
having once confessed a sin, is at any time thereafter to confess it in
order to forgiveness? The affirmative to which last question, is asserted and
proved. Certain particulars added as Cautions for the preventing of mistakes,
and for the better understanding of the Authors true sense and meaning.
CONSECT. XIII.
13. THE premises being duly considered, will assist and guide us in a right
resolution of the following questions.

1. Does God always pardon a sinner instantly upon the confession of his
sins? Or, when shall the present promises of the text be made good to the
sinner that confesses his sins?

Answ. Not fully for the present time, or as soon as confession is made, nor
fully so long as he lives in this world, but (...), (as is the Apostles phrase,
Romans 5.6.) in due season, and in Gods good tme. Besides the reasons forecitied
in evidence thereof, I shall subjoine these two considerations.

1. Remission of sin being a grace or benefit purchased by the blood of
Christ, as our adoption and regeneration are, why should it be thought more
strange that we are not fully made partakers of remission before the day of
judgment, then of adoption and regeneration? And yet the truth is here, and so
it must be there also acknowledged, that albeit we are adopted and regenerated
so soon as we are believers, nevertheless the time of our Adoption and
regeneration is not in some sense before the day of judgment, because before that
time they shall not be completed in soul and body, nor the benefits of them as
to the whole man fully enjoyed, as appears Romans 8.23. Matthew. 19.26. 2. The
reinvestment, or restoration of a sinner into the love and favor of God,
being (as was aforesaid) the positive part of pardon, who will say to the
contrary, but that a sinner may grow in the love and favor of God, and that
the Saints now triumphant in heaven, are more in Gods favor, or do enjoy more
of his love and favor then they were, or did being sinners militant here on
earth? Yea Christ himself, though no sinner, is said to grow in the favor of
God. Luke 2.52.
Quest. 2. How far forth, or in what sense may it be said, that a sinner does
receive a present pardon immediately upon the confession of his sins?

Answ. Though this question be a different question from the former, and has
more difficulty in it; nevertheless a due consideration of the premises
touching the quiddity, or true nature of forgiveness of sin, will enable us
to make an unerring answer (as I suppose) thereunto, and unto the said
question: Therefore I reply, That a sinner in, or upon the confession of his
sins, does instantly enjoy the pardon of his sins three ways, or in a
threefold sense, or for as much as does amount to these three things.

1. The sinner is immediately discharged, delivered, or disobliged from that
Wrath to come (as is the Apostles phrase, 1 These. 1.10.) or from being actually
bound over to eternal damnation; or, the condemning power of sin is taken away,
or (in the phrase of the Prophet Micah, chap. 7.19.) subdued. As sin has a
commanding power over the sinner, enslaving him to its service, so likewise it
has a condemning power upon the sinner, which power is immediately taken away,
so soon as sin is (in a Scripture sense, way, or manner) confessed.

Having mentioned these two powers of sin, let me crave leave to interpose this
one thing ((...), and by the by;) viz, That when we read in the writings of
Saint Paul, or in any other Scripture concerning the reign and dominion of sin,
we must have a special regard to the Context, if we will rightly interpret the
true meaning of the Holy Ghost, concerning which of these two powers of sin he
speaks: for I am half minded, that some Texts of Scripture are commonly
interpreted one way, when upon a more through consideration we shall find
reason rather to interpret them another, especially that in Romans 6.14. [Sin
shall not have dominion over you,] which is commonly interpreted concerning the
commanding power of sin, and I think is intended by the Apostle concerning the
damning power thereof, that power or strength which he elsewhere says, sin
has by the Law, i. e. the commination of the Law, by virtue whereof sin does
damn or condemn the sinner, 1 Cor. 15.56. and for victory over which sa^d
damning power or strength of sin, the Apostle does bless God in the following
verse, saying, But thanks be to God which gives us the victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ. Sure I am of these three things,

1. That when God does pardon sin, he is said to subdue it Mic. 7.19. 2. That
sin has never got a full conquest, or its full victory over the sinner, or
that sin does never reign in its full power and strength over the sinner till
it has brought the sinner into the pit of Hell, or has actually damned him,
or (in the Apostles phrase Romans 5.28.) does reign unto death. 3. That Gods not
suffering sin in respect of its damning power to reign over the Saints, is a
very fit proper and prevalent Argument, to persuade them not to suffer sin in
respect of its commanding power to reign over them. Freedom from both these
powers of sin, or from sin with respect to both these powers (it being styled
with respect to its commanding power over us, the Law of sin; and with respect
to its damning power over us, the Law of Death) the Apostle does mention in one
place, Romans 8.2. The Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus; ( i.e. the
living or quickening Spirit of Jesus Christ) has made me free from the law of
sin and Those who by the Law of Death do here understand the Law of Works, do
not vary, as I suppose, from the interpretation which I have here given, seeing
that sin has its condemning power from, or by virtue of the Law of Works.
deah; i. e. from sin, which does as a Law command and condemn This last
particular being considered, does make me boldly, yet humbly, to offer this as
a rule; viz. That when God does exhort us, not to suffer sin to have dominion
over us, then and there we are to understand the commanding power of sin; but
when he promises on his part, that sin shall not have dominion over us, then
and there we are to understand the condemning power of sin, the former being
man's duty, is fit matter for a command; the latter being Gods mercy is fit
matter for a Promise. Yet let me add these two things in the way of Caution. 1.
I do acknowledge, that the usual interpretation of Romans 6.14. which I do for
the Reasons aforesaid dissent from, is a mis-interpretation (if indeed such) of
no dangerous consequence, because these two powers of sin, like Hypocrates his
twins, do decay and flourish, do live and dye and revive together; I mean, if,
or whenever the one does revive, the other does revive also. Now in such
cases I think it my duty, however to offer what strength of reason or Scripture
I have for my own sense and apprehension; nevertheless not much or stiffly to
contend with any man of a contrary mind, but rather in the spirit of meekness
to suffer every man to abound in his own sense, according to the analogy or
proportion of faith; from which those do not vary, who do understand grace to
perform duty, and the successeful exercise of it to be promised also. 2.
Albeit in my Exposition of Romans 6.14. I seem to have taken off the edge of one
weapon, or rather to have endeavored the wresting of one weapon out of the
hands of our Divines in their contest with the Arminians about the Apostasy of
the Saints, nevertheless I have done no prejudice (as I think) to the Doctrine
of Perseverance, as commonly taught and received by our Divines: for I deny
not, but that there is as much promised in other Scriptures, as does amount
unto, or accord with that usual Interpretation of Romans 6.14. which I do
professedly dissent from.

But to return: See Mr. Burges of Justification p. 137.
As soon as sin is committed, there does accrue unto God a moral right or power
as a Judge to inflict eternal punishment upon the sinner, and so there is a
legal obligation of the sinner to such a punishment (with respect to which said
bond, or obligation a sinner not pardoned is said (as I conceive) by Solomon,
to be held in the cords of his sins, Prove. 5.22.) and when this bond or
obligation is dissolved or taken off, God is said to forgive sin, or to unty,
loose, or remit the sinner. Now such an obligation (I say) is immediately
dissolved, or taken off upon a sinners confession of his sins, God thereupon
blotting out his sins, or not remembering his sins any more; i. e. not willing
the obligation of the sinner (for sin so confessed) to eternal wrath. This is,
as I may so say, the pith and marrow, the heart and spirit of forgiveness
presently enjoyed; viz. Gods present taking away the actual ordination of the
sin, or obligation of the sinner to everlasting condemnation, so that the
sinner may lift up his head thereupon, and say with the Apostle, Romans 8.1. Now
therefore there is no condemnation for me.

2. A sinner is immediately upon his confession restored into grace and favor
with the Lord, the loss or Here note, That look what favor of God a sinner by
his sin has forfeited, such is the favor into which, upon his penitent
confession he is restored; e. g. we all having forfeited in Adam the favor of
children, we are restored into the favor of children, or adopted. And having
by new sins incurred Gods fatherly displeasure, we are upon our confession
restored into his fatherly favor, as opposite to the said displeasure.
forfeiture whereof being one part of the punishment of sin. This branch of
pardon is called, Gods graciously receiving of the sinner, Hos. 14.2. The truth
hereof I shall hereafter demonstrate, when I come to set down such things, as
I do judge in Scripture phrase to be equivalent to forgiveness; in the mean
time only let it be observed, That whenever God pardons the sin, he is
reconciled to the sinner, and Christ's expiating, or being a propitiation for
sin, is all one, as for Christ to make reconciliation for sin, Heb. 2.17. with
1 John 2. beg. It is therefore to be noted, that David in Psalm. 51. much
insisting upon, and being instant for the pardon of his sins, both original and
actual, especially his sin of murder and adultery, as he does express his mind
and meaning in various phrases, so in this phrase among others; viz. That God
would not cast him away from his face. i.e. his love and favor, ver. 11. I
say, his favor; for as by the In this sense the face of G. is sometime styled
the back of God, Jer. 18.17.
face of God, is sometimes meant the wrath and displeasure of God, Psa. 34.16.
(and this face of God David prays against, saying, Hide thy face from my sins,
ver. 9.) so by Gods face is sometimes meant his favor ( Psalm. 80.3, last.
Cause thy face to shine, etc.) so it is to be taken in the forecited Text; ver.
11, it being the self same word in the Original as is used ver. 9. although it
be differently rendered by our Translators; E. G. in ver. 9. Face, in ver. 11.
Presence. Though Gods dislike then of the sin be never taken away (in which
respect that of Hab. 1.13. will be everlasting true, That God is a God of purer
eyes then to behold evil) yet his Gods favor or disfavour, not signifying Gods
Essence, but his Dispensations, may be said to be altered without any change in
God.
disfavour of, or toward the sinner, is immediately upon confession altered or
taken off, so far forth, as that of an enemy he becomes to God, as, or in the
relation of a friend; or as of a friend under a cloud of Gods displeasure, he
becomes a friend restored into former favor.

3. The (...), (as I may so say) the sting or strength of sin is presently
taken away; i. e. the curse of the curse, or the evil of all evils, that do
remain as inflicted, or to be inflicted upon the sinner, are so altered from
their native import, vergency or tendency, as that they are, or shall be
through Gods blessing and favor toward the sinner turned to good, so that the
sinner may immediately triumph upon them all (even as Christ upon the Cross is
said to triumph over all enemies, Col. 2.14, 15.) and defy them for the worst
that they can do unto him, saying in good sort, as in 1 Cor. 15.55, 56. O
l^sse, cross, pain, torment, Where is thy sting and victory? This spoiling (as
I may so say) and disabling of sin, thus far forth is one other part of the
pardon, which (as I think) is presently enjoyed by the sinner, unto whom God
does promise forgiveness in the Text.

Quest. 3. Whether is a truly penitent and believing sinner, having once
confessed a sin, at any time thereafter to confess it in order to forgiveness?

This is a Question of so much the more moment above the former, by how much

1. It is not a mere notional or speculative, but a practical case, and that
of very frequent use.

2. Of Universal concernment.

3. In respect of these woeful, sinful, and most unhappy times (wherein the
Gospel of Christ is so notoriously turned into lasciviousness, even by many of
those who are high pretenders to Gospel light, and have with two many the
chief, if not only name of Gospel Preachers) most necessary and seasonable: In
these times (I say) wherein many do hold that a sin once acknowledged is never
afterward to be confessed in order to forgiveness. The Author of the Book
styled, Religio Medici, (written as is commonly supposed by Dr. Brown; a
Traveller, and a man of great Learning and Reading, as appears by his
Pseudodoxia Edidemica) does so far acquaint us with his Devotion and Orisons,
as to tell us, that having once confessed a sin, he does not from thenceforward
make any particular confession thereof in his Prayers to God. And I doubt that
Religio Medici is at this day in this point too much Religio Wallici, and may
become in time Religio Populi, my meaning is (I doubt) that this Doctrine,
[That sin once confessed, is no more to be confessed.] is one of those sweet
and Gospel-Truthes (as it is named) which is now in dispersing in South and
North Wales, by some of those Itineraries in those parts. The reason of my
jealousy herein is, not only because I know an ancient and an eminent
professor of Religion lately entangled in their Errors, to have come from
thence to disperse that as a precious truth in England; but also because
several of the Licentiate Preachers themselves are famed to be infected with
Antinomian Principles, which do directly lead unto such irreligious courses and
neglect of Duty, as I have (I suppose) made more at large to appear in my
Examen of Dr. Crisp his book, styled, His Third Volume of Sermons, and which I
wrote about* six years ago, but have not yet published.

To the Question therefore I answer, That a penitent and truly believing
sinner, having confessed his sins once, is notwithstanding, in order to
forgiveness, to confess them upon occasion again and again, according to the
example of David and other of the Saints and Servants of God in Scripture,
Psalm. 25.7, 18. and 51.9. And me thinks (besides other Reasons, e.g. 1. Then
should no Christian ever mention Original sin in his confession to God, having
once in his life acknowledged it. 2. If we may infer from the Text in hand,
that sin is but once to be confessed, because the Apostle says, If we confess
our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us; why may we not by a like
reason conclude, That we are but once in our lives to pray to God, because the
Apostle says, Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved?
Romans 10.13.)


Besides, I say, these and other reasons (me thinks) the true know, ledge of
the nature of forgiveness of sin (as was before declared; it being a thing not
here perfect, but in perfecting more and more till out dying; yea, till our
rising day) is a very sufficient and satisfactory ground and reason for the
same. Seeing we are more and more capable of receiving, or capable of
receiv^ng more and more of the forgiveness of our sins, why should we not in
order thereunto, viz. the degrees of pardon, make confession of them again and
again?

Besides, Although it be granted (as was before acknowledged and asserted) That
as soon as ever a penitent sinner has confessed his sins, he is immediately
pardoned, so far forth as that his obligation to damnation is taken away; yet
who can, or dare say, that this dis-obligation shall be continued to such a
sinner as shall never afterward, so much as once in his life (God prolonging
his life) confess those sins again? Sure I am, that the promise of Salvation
is made only to those who do patiently continue in well doing; i. e. in all the
ways of doing well, among which I take this to be one, viz. frequent Prayer
and frequent confession. And so the continuance of our pardon and
Justification, is yet but conditional in the Covenant, though certain in
Decree.

As well for the confirmation, as explanation of what has been said in the
Consectaries immediately foregoing, wherein was asserted, that new sins do
bring a new obligation to punishment, which obligation must be taken off by a
new pardon; Be it further considered,

1. The sins of a godly man, as well as the sins of a wicked man; or sins
committed after conversion, as well as sins committed before conversion, are
mortal in their own nature, and do deserve punishment, even the punishment of
hell and damnation. What law it is, by virtue whereof, the sins of believers
do deserve damnation, is not so unanimously by Divines agreed upon; it being a
question agitated amongst them, whether the old law, or covenant of works, be
only relaxed, or whether it be not abrogated to all mankind. For my own part,
I can scarce discern any real difference in this controversy, one choosing to
style that an Abrogation, which another thinks fittest (with a precise respect
to the rule of the civil law) to call a Relaxation; and it being my opinion,
that the controversy is rather verbal, then real, I hope therefore, that I
may without the offense, and with the good leave of either party express my
sense in the same to be this, viz. I humbly conceive, that whereas in the old
law or covenant of works, all manner of sin was threatened with death, as
unavoidable ex part legis, that law as threatening death in such sort, and upon
such terms, and as commanding perfect, universal obedience, as the only
condition of life, is taken away; so that mankind is not under that law or
covenant, as in the sense aforesaid; in stead whereof, we all are Sub lege
remediante, under a new law, or covenant of the Lord Redeemer: in which law
there are threatenings of two sorts, viz. Conditional and peremptory; in the
former, all manner of sin being threatened with damnation; in the latter only
final impenitencie and unbelief. But it is not material to my present purpose,
to determine ought in that question, it being sufficient for me only to say,
that all Protestant Divines do unanimously accord in this, viz. 1. That all sin
is in its own nature mortal, and deserves damnation, by virtue of the
threatening of one law or another, either the new, or else the old (threatening
in that respect, or so far forth) being in force, or continuing.

2. All sin deserving damnation by virtue of divine commination, it will
follow thereupon^, that the sinner upon the commission of sin, is actually
obliged to suffer accordingly: for why, or whence is sin said to be mortal,
but from that strength which it has from, or by the virtue of the laws
commination to oblige the sinner to damnation?

3. As a consequent hereof it follows, that a sinner has need of pardon for
every sin, that so the penalty of the law may not be executed according to
the obligation.

4. In order to the procuring of the said pardon or dis-obligation, and to the
diverting of damnation threatened; it is necessary, that the godly should use
such means from time to time as God has in his word commanded them to use; i.
e. that they should confess their sins, pray for the pardon of them, fly for
refuge by faith to the blood of Christ daily.

5. Immediately upon a sinners taking such a course, or using such means as
God has appointed him to take and use for pardon, the law is disabled, and the
sinner is disobliged from damnation, because its threatening is only
conditional, viz. in case of non-repenting and faith, which conditions being
performed, the new law, or covenant can no longer hold the sinner guilty.

6. This disobligation of the sinner is that particular and new pardon, of
which, as was asserted, a godly man has need, in respect of his new and
particular sins. I am not ignorant that some Divines do not use in this
case, the expression (new and particular pardon) but (a renewed application of
pardon.) But because this expression is to my seeming very obscure, (they not
explicating what they do intend by the said renewed application of pardon,
whether they mean some renewed act of the sinner, or else some renewed act of
God; and because I know no fitness in the phrase in what sense soever it be
taken) for if any one allege the former sense I answer, That pardon of sin
(actively taken, is not our act, but Gods. Besides, A sinners renewed
application of pardon to himself, is his renewed act or acting of faith (which
act of faith I should choose to express, by a sinners renewed application of
himself to Christ, or the Promises of Christ for pardon, and not by the sinners
renewed application of pardon to himself.) If any shall allege the latter
sense; I answer, That Gods application of pardon is pardon; or, Gods renewed
application of pardon is neither more nor less but plainly this, viz. Gods
bestowing a new pardon, or (in the phrase of the Prophet Isaiah, chap. 55.7.)
his multiplying to pardon, or his pardoning again and again.) These things (I
say) considered, I have thought meet to forbear the use of that expression [A
renewed application of pardon.] and in stead thereof to say, [New pardons.]

I am not ignorant likewise, that some Divines in stead of saying, [There is an
actual obligation of the sinner by, or immediately upon the commission of sin,
to damnation;] they sometimes say [There is an aptitude in all sin to damn the
sinner;] which phrase as being more mollifying, it was once in my thoughts to
have used, and accordingly to have expressed Gods particular and new pardons,
by his hindering or obstructing the foresaid aptitude of such particular and new
sins, from taking effect in the actual obligation of a sinner to damnation. But
upon a due consideration of this expression, I found (as I thought, and still
do think) just cause to wave and decline the use of it; that expression being
as much as to say, I should have fallen out, if I had not been reconciled; or,
I should have been wounded, if I had not been healed; or, I had been bound and
tied, if I had not been loosed and untyed; or, a sinner should have been
obliged to suffer, if he had not been pardoned. These two last phrases (I
confess) in a sense are true, and for that purpose may be used; viz. I had
been still bound, and tied, if I had not been losed and untyed; or, A sinner
should have been still obliged to suffer, if he had not been pardoned;
importing, that time was, when the sinner or person now loosed, untied and
pardoned, was actually tied, bound, and obliged to suffer: Nevertheless,
without the supposal of a sinners precedaneous actual obligation to suffer, the
foresaid expressions are intolerable; because pardon does not prevent the
sinners obligation to suffer, no more then healing does prevent wounding or
loosing does prevent binding, but always follows after it in order of Nature
at least, if not in time, as the remedy thereof. The premises being duly
weighed, I can perceive no just cause why any person, under what pretense
soever, should be offended for my asserting, as is before asserted; viz. That
new sins do bring a new obligation to punishment, which obligation must be
dissolved, or taken off by a new pardon.

CHAP. XX. That all sins, past, present, or to come, are not at once actually
pardoned. That no sin is from eternity actually pardoned. An Objection answered
That no sin is actually pardoned, till the sinner be in a capacity of receiving
or enjoying it. What those things are which do put a sinner into a capacity of
actual pardon, declared in their particulars; together with Reasons for the
remarkablenesse of the same. An Objection answered; with a vindicating of that
assertion in Romans 4.17. wherein God is said, to call the things that are not,
as though they were, from Antinomian purposes.
CONSECT. XIII.
13. IT follows, That all sins past, present, and to come, are not forgiven at
once. Had the Authors and Abettors of the contrary Opinion; ( viz. That all
sins, past, present and to come, are at once actually remitted, and that from
eternity) either rightly known or duly considered the nature of forgiveness of
sin, what it is, and wherein it does consist, then doubtless they would not
have owned an opinion so absurd and irrational: for they who do understand that
forgiveness of sin does consist in Gods taking off the obligation to
punishment, and punishment it self, and yet will affirm, That all sins past,
present and to come are at once remitted; must consequently affirm, That a man
may be disobliged before he is obliged, loosed, before bound; set at liberty,
before captivated or imprisoned; and that punishment is taken off before it be
inflicted and laid on. then which to affirm or imply, what is more
inconsistent with sense and reason? Nevertheless, because there has been
some very Learned and Pious men, who have adhered to this opinion, that all
sins past, present, and to come are forgiven at once, and that from eternity. I
shall for the more satisfaction subjoin certain propositions, partly in the way
of concession, and pa^tly in the way of exception.

As to the former, I grant that at what time God did will or purpose to pardon
any one sin, yea any one elect sinner he did at that instant time will, or
purpose to pardon all and every sin all and every sinner, and this he did will
and purpose from all eternity: for Gods will or purpose being his essence, it
cannot therefore be said, that he did ever begin to will or purpose any thing.

2. When Christ Jesus did purchase the pardon of any one sin, or sinner, he did
purchase the pardon of all and every sin and sinner; and this was actually done
when he died upon the cross, Heb. 10. 12, 14. Albeit in such a sense as
Abraham is said to have offered up Isaac, Heb. 11.17. viz. in regard of his
purpose, readiness, and resolution to offer him; in such a sense it may be
said that Christ did long before offer himself, he being willing thereunto
and resolved thereupon, which said willingness and resolution in him was to
such intents and effects accepted with God, as if he had actually accomplished
his said will and resolution. Whence that common saying, Christ's sufferings
were effectual before they were effected.

3. When God did promise pardon to any one sin or sinner, he did promise the
pardon of all sins I mean, of all sins that shall be pardoned, for there are
some sins that never shall be pardoned, as final impenitency, or the final
nonperformance of the conditions of the Gospel, and the sin against the Holy
Ghost; and unto these sins God does not promise any pardon upon any terms.
and sinners, and that upon the self same terms, viz. of repenting, believing,
converting from sin. That Gospel promise [ I will be your God, or whosoever
believes in Christ shall receive remission of sinnes] does at once hold forth
the pardon of all sin; which said promise it self may in a sense be styled a
sinners pardon, even as the instrument or writing under the Kings hand and
Seal is called the Kings pardon: which said promise also may be styled a
complete and full pardon, for as much as it wants nothing to make it in its
kind a perfect and legal discharge from all sins; the pardon of all sins as
well as of any one sin being therein promised to sinners, so that what person
soever has a right by faith unto the said Gospel grant, or promise of pardon,
has right to the pardon of all his sins in these three respects. viz. In
respect of Gods purpose, of Christ's purchase, and of the Gospel-promise: We may
be said to have the pardon of all our sins at once, i e. we have all at once
in Gods purpose, in Christ's purchase, and in the Gospel promise; or they are
all at once, I mean, the pardon of them purposed by God, purchased by Christ,
and promised in the Gospel.

2. In the way of exception, I shall lay down this in the first place, and as
in general, viz. It will not follow from any, or all the said propositions,
whether severally or jointly taken, that all sins and sinners are actually
pardoned at once; no more then it will follow, that because a Father did
purpose an inheritance for his child before it was borne; or purchase for his
child an inheritance as soon as it was borne, or promise the said inheritance
as soon as it could speak and understand, that the child did therefore at, or
from the time of the said purpose, purchase, or promise actually enjoy, or was
made actual possessour of the said inheritance. And because it is a very common
and foul error; yea, a mother-errour (as I may so say) in the Antinomians,
not to distinguish betwixt the decree, or will of God, and the execution
thereof, or betwixt Gods purposes and his performances. Be it therefore
considered,

1. That albeit this proposition [God did not will or decree any thing in time]
be a true proposition, referring [in time] to his will or decree; nevertheless
the contrary proposition [God did will or decree every thing in time] is true,
[referring in time] to the being, or actual existence of the thing.

2. As God did from eternity will or purpose the beginning of the thing; e. g.
the creation of the world (though he never did begin to will it, having willed
it from ternity) so he also from eternity did will or purpose the ceasing of
things, e. g. the dissolution of the world; both these God did will at once.
Will it therefore follow, that the world was created and dissolved from
eternity, and both created and dissolved at once?

3. God did purpose from eternity to sanctify and glorify his Elect, yea at
what time he did will their birth, he did will their new birth; at what time he
did purpose to give them life on earth, he did purpose to give them life in
Heaven: Will it therefore follow, That the Elect are sanctified and glorified
actually from eternity, or borne again so soon as borne, or glorified so
soon as sanctified?

Obj. Things are otherwise to God then they are to us, and therefore what is
not from eternity in respect of us, may be from eternity in respect of God.

Answ In respect of actual existence, things are to God no otherwise then they
are to us; i. e. God does not see or know any thing actually to be or exist,
before it actually is, or does exist: however it be true, that he does foreknow
in these things what we do not, and cannot; viz. That a thing shall be, or
shall exist before it actually is, or does exist.

2. As it is the power of God which makes a thing possible, and the pleasure or
will of God, that makes a thing future; so it is the application of his power
by his will and pleasure to the production of this or that, which does make it
actually to be, or does make it of possible and future, to become actually
existent.

3. Till there be an application of Gods power by his pleasure to the producing
of a thing, that thing has no actual co-existence with the eternity of God,
neither is it in God otherwise then Objective, or per modum Objecti (as the
Schools use to speak) that is, it is in the power and purpose of God to do it.
See Barlowes elegant and judicious Exercitation concerning Gods eternity, as
also other metaphysical Authors concerning this Question, An res insint
aeternitati per proprias existentias; per quas cum sunt, tempori coexistunt, an
Objective solum?

I desire the Reader, that the several answers to the foresaid Objection may
the rather be well weighed and remembered, because they serve to make void and
null one special Argument of the Antinomians, whereby they would prove actual
Justification before faith: (this being the scope of a late Book written by Mr.
William Air of Salisbury, against Mr. Benjamin Woodbridg of Newbery; it being,
as it now appears, Mr. Air his lot to have among many others, the son and
successor of his learned Schoolmaster Mr. John Woodbridg (my worthy
Predecessor) his declared Adversaries in that and in some other points, as
depending on it, or it on them:) to make void (I say) an Argument for the said
purpose taken out of Romans 4.17. it being there asserted, That God does call the
things which be not, as though they were, therefore (say they) though we are
not, yet we are said to be justified in the sight of God, as if we were. But be
it known, that the import or reason of that Scripture-saying is not because
things are in actu entitative, that things do exist or have an existence as to
God, or before God, though they have no existence in themselves, or as to us;
but because God does foresee that things will be, or will exist, before they
are or do exist, which no humane eye can foresee; (for which cause he is said
to Foresee the Justification of the Heathen through faith, Gal. 3.8. The
Scripture foreseeing; i. e. the Holy Ghost the Author of the Scripture
foreseeing (as Piscator interprets the place) that God would justify the
heathen through faith) as also, because God can do those things by his power,
which we cannot do, yea, which (I do not say, in nature, but) as to nature are
impossible to be done; and that he can do these things at any time, whenever
he shall by his will and pleasure apply his Omnipotent power for the effecting
thereof, as was manifested in the case of Sarah there specified. Having said,
That God does foresee those things which we do not, and that he is said for
that cause, to call the things that are not, as though they were. I shall
exemplify that saying in one instance; e. g. The only wise God did foresee the
dissolution of the late Parliament, even before the convention of it, albeit as
it seems Mr William Air did not foresee it a few days before it was
dissolved; for if he had foreseen, that that Parliament would have been so
soon dissolved upon account of its being no longer profitable for the
Commonwealth, doubtless he would not have told them (as to their faces) in
his Epistle Dedicatory unto them, That they were in his judgment, the fittest
of any company of men on earth, to umpire and judge in the points controverted
betwixt him and Mr. Woodbridg. Had Mr. Air in very deed delivered the truth of
his judgment and the judgment of truth in that suffrage super-superlative, I
must have said, That it had been a thousand pities that the said company of
men, though dissolved as to a Parliament of the Commonwealth (both name and
thing;) yet had not been continued under some new name; e. g. Apollinis tripos;
Concessus Apostolicus, Aarons Brestplate, Vrim and Thummim, Englands Oracle,
The Church Vertual, or the like Notio secunda; as unto whom all dissenting
persons and parties, both in our own, and in all the Nations throughout the
world might have had recourse for resolution in the great things and truths of
God. But seeing that it was concluded by themselves, that their company so
constituted, was no longer profitable to the Commonwealth, I believe that Mr.
Air is now convicted, that their longer sitting was not like to be profitable
for the Church; whereupon I shall conclude, that it was for want of foresight,
that Mr. Air did so far luxuriate in their high praises, as to say, That of
any company of men on earth, they were the fittest to umpire in such
Theological Disputes as are betwixt him and his old School fellow Mr. Benjamin
Woodbridg.

Let the second Negative Proposition be this; viz. No sin is actually pardoned,
till a person be made capable of it, or put into a capacity of receiving or
enjoying it. This Proposition carries its own evidence in the body or bowels
of it: for nothing is before it can be. I shall therefore immediately apply my
self to the resolution of the following Question.

Quest. When is a person capable of receiving the actual pardon of his sins?
Or, When are the Elect capable of receiving, or actually enjoying that pardon
which was so long since purposed, purchased, promised to and for them?

Answ. 1. When they need it.

Quest. When do they need it?

Answ. When they are, or do become sinners, have committed sin, or are guilty
of sin. Till sin be past, pardon is to come. To pardon sin before it is
committed is to pardon sin that is no sin, it is to pardon that which is not,
which is a contradiction, and a mere impossibility: for where there is no
guilt, there can be no pardon. As a man is not capable of an Alms, till he be
miserable and indigent; so nor of pardon, till he be peccant: Or as a man is
not capable of a cure by Physic and Chyrurgery till he be sick and wounded; so
nor of pardon, till he be sick of sin, and wounded by it. These similitudes are
the rather apt, because Gods pardoning sin is said to be his taking compassion
on us, ( Mic. 7.19. Luke 18. 13. God compassionate me a sinner, says the
Publican:) and his healing us, Isai. 53.5. Hos. 14.4. This is a remote
capacity. The next particular does declare and set forth the sinners proximous,
or immediate capacity of pardon.

2. Then are the Elect capable of actual pardon, when they are in Gods way fit
or fitted for it.

Quest. When is that?

Answ. When they see their sins (I speak of persons adult, or of ripe age)
confess them, repent for them, believe in Christ. See Act. 10.43. To him give
all the Prophets witness, that whosoever believes in him shall receive
remission of sins. Luke 24.47. And that repentance and remission of sin should
be preached in his name among all Nations. Acts 5.31. Him has God exalted, to
be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel and remission of sin,
(observe, Repentance is given first, and then remission.) As the ground is not
capable of receiving the seed of the Husbandman till it be plowed, so nor are
the Elect capable of receiving the precious seed of pardon, till the fallow
ground of their hearts be plowed up by Repentance (to speak in the metaphor of
the Prophet Jeremy chap. 4.4.) In this sense that saying of the Evangelist is
most true, according as by some it is interpreted; John 1.16. Of his fullness
we receive, and grace for grace; i. e. by reason of one grace we receive
another (even as the God of all grace does give one grace in order to another)
e g. for, or by reason of the grace of faith, repentance and conversion (all
which were merited by Christ) God gives us the grace of Remission, according to
that Proverbial saying among the Jews, and in this case appliable, Habenti
dabitur. As God does by Grace adapt, or make us fit and meet for glory, (Col.
1.12 Giving thanks to the Father, who has made us meet for the inheritance
among the Saints in light,) So by one grace God does make us meet for receiving
of another. And as the Wedding Garment did fit and make meet the Guests for the
Wedding Supper; so does Faith, Repentance and new obedience (being as the
Wedding Garment) fit, or make meet the sinner for partaking in the pardon of
his sins, which is as the Wedding Supper.

This particular is the rather to be observed, because it is useful, as
otherwise, so specially for these two purposes.

1. To prevent and redress the presumption of impenitent and ungodly sinners,
who are apt to expect to reap where they have not sowed, and to gather where
they have not strawed. I mean, who do usually expect an harvest of comfort in
the pardon of their sins, and to reap in mercy, when they have not sown to
themselves one seed (the least mustard seed) of grace, or one grain of
righteousness (to speak in the phrase of the prophet, Hos. chapter 10.12) 2. It is
useful, whereby to obviate or answer the common objection of the Antinomians,
whereby they would involve us as guilty of impeaching the freedom of Gods grace
in the pardon of our sins, because we affirm with the Scriptures, that pardon
of sin cannot actually be enjoyed without the performance of such and such
conditions, the performance of which said conditions is notwithstanding of, and
cannot be without Gods free grace given to us, and enabling us for that end and
purpose. I shall close this particular with the words of that very Learned and
godly man, Mr. Anthony Burges, in his book of justification, p. 18. There go
more causes to the pardon of sin besides the meritorious cause; faith the
instrumental cause, which is as necessary in its kind for this great benefit as
the meritorious cause is in its kind; that though Christ has born such a man's
sins, yet they are not pardoned till he do believe; for as the grace of God
(which is the efficient cause of pardon) does not make a sin completely
forgiven without the meritorious cause, so neither does the meritorious without
the instrumental, but there is a necessity of the presence and the cooperation
of all these.
Caution. Though I have not expressly made mention of the merits of Christ
through his blood shed in order to a sinners being made capable of pardon.
Nevertheless,

1. I do acknowledge, and let it be known, that the intervention of his merits
are necessary to the said sinners capability of pardon. Whether his merits be
so absolutely necessary hereunto, as that God could not have pardoned a sinner
without it, although that be a question, in the resolution whereof, Learned and
Godly men do differ, (Mr. Owen the Learned Deane of Christ's Church has in an
elaborate tractate lately put forth, endeavored to prove the said absolute
necessity of Christ's satisfaction) nevertheless it is without all question,
that (rebus sic stantibus, etc.) according as things are now set and fixed by
God, and according to his will revealed in his Word; no sinner can be pardoned
without the intervention of Christ's merits and satisfaction.

2. In mentioning faith as that which puts the sinner into a capacity of
pardon, I have included the merits of Christ's bloodshed, his blood being the
object of faith, or that which faith does lay hold and rest upon; according to
that of the Apostle, Romans 3.24, 25. Being justified freely by his grace,
through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ, whom God has set forth to be a
propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the
remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God. Where let the
Antinomian observe two things.

1. Remission is of sins past, [mark past.] 2. Though justification and
remission of sin be not otherwise then through Christ's blood; yea, through
faith in his blood; nevertheless it is a grace, a free grace.
Object. If all sins, past, present, and to come, are not at once pardoned,
then Christ is not a perfect satisfier, or has not perfectly satisfied for our
sins?

Answ. This objection is a very weak one, and for the weakness thereof, I may
well style it a woman's objection: and I shall the rather so style it, because
it was in very deed, the objection which a certain woman in these parts (much
perverted, as it seems, by Antinomian principles, and frequenting as I have
heard, the teachings of such teachers as are sent abroad by the Church of
Abbingdon) objected in my hearing against the truth here asserted by me, viz
that all sins, past, present and to come, are not pardoned at once; and albeit
the said Sister did express as much confidence in her opinion to the contrary,
as if so be she had been inspired with a spirit infallible, and did receive
so little satisfaction by my answers, as that she did plainly tell me to my
face, that my answers did make it apparent unto her, that I was a person not as
yet justified; I shall nevertheless set down in this place the self same
answers, and no other answer then what I made unto her objection as now
follows.

1. I told her that she might by a like reason infer, that Christ Jesus is not
a perfect Red emer, seeing the Saints are not in this life perfectly redeemed
from their sins, but must wait for the accomplishment thereof till the day of
judgment, which for that cause is styled the day of Redemption.

2. I asked her whether she would assert her self to be a Saint already in
heaven, actually singing Halelujah; She answered no. Whereupon I told her,
that the glorification of believers, is the fruit or benefit of Christ's
satisfaction; and I had therefore as good reason upon this account to make the
same objection against her, viz that then Christ was not a perfect satisfier.

3 Finally I told her, that she is carefully to distinguish betwixt the price
which Christ paid for satisfaction, or for our remission, ransom or redemption,
and betwixt the fruits, effects and benefits which the Saints do enjoy thereby;
The former I told her was a price most perfect, but the latter are not all at
once in perfection bestowed upon us, but by degrees, and in Gods due time and
way, some now, some then, some in this life, some at death, and some not before
the day of judgment.

These answers I then thought, and still do think satisfactory, but I do find,
that the confidence of a woman possessed with Antinomian principles, is
insuperable The Lord in his great mercy pity those who are under strong
delusions, believing in lies, and put some restraint upon such teachers as are
purposely sent forth under pretense of propagating the Gospel, to adulterate
and corrupt it, and to make merchandise of the souls of the simple, whom with
good words and fair speeches, they do most pitifully and impiously beguile.

CHAP. XXI. Caution given as touching a right understanding of the two
following Propositions; laid down by that very learned and pious Divine, Mr.
Anthony Burges, in his Sermons concerning Justification; viz. 1. No wicked man
ever has any sin forgiven him. p. 22. 2. It is one thing for God to forgive,
and another thing for God not to demand and exact punishments. p. 143.
CONSECT. XIV.
14. IT follows, which might have been more fitly inserted as the second
Consectary) how far forth, or in what sense to understand those two
Propositions of My. Burges, in his Book of Justification.

1. No wicked man ever has any sin forgiven him. p 22. 2. It is one thing for
God to forgive, and another thing not to exact and demand punishment. p. 143.
I have already proved, That God is said sometimes to forgive the sins of
wicked men; as also, That Gods punishing is said to be his not forgiving, and
his forgiving his not punishing; so that the said Propositions, being taken in
their latitude as they sound, cannot ageee with the truth of Scripture: which
that they may do, it is necessary that we understand and restrain them unto
that kind of forgiveness, which does respect the disobliging or discharge of a
sinner from eternal damnation; for which respect, and indeed for the prevention
of much mistake in this Subject, I should think it expedient for any one who
undertaketh to write more at large concerning the nature of forgiveness of
sin, to set down almost in the first place, this distinction; viz. There is a
twofold forgiveness of sin plainly expressed in Scripture; the one peculiar to
the Saints, which for that cause may well be styled The remission of Gods
Elect, as for a like cause faith is styled by the Apostle, the faith of Gods
Elect, as Tit. 1.1. The other common to the Reprobate with the Elect. Now I
say, the said Propositions are to be restrained to the former, and are not to
be extended to the latter kind of forgiveness. For my own part, I must needs
say, That Mr. Anth^ny Burges is a Gamaliel so h^^h in my esteem, as that I do
judge my self unworthy to sit at his feet, or to bear his Books, and for that
cause I am so unwilling in ought to express my dissent from him, as rather
then contradict so worthy an Author, I should study to the uttermost of reason,
how to interpret all his sayings and assertions in a true sense; and for that
cause it was once in my mind to have interpreted the meaning of that
Proposition of his ( p. 21. When a sin is forgiven, it is totally and perfectly
forgiven.) rather then to have declared my dissent from it. I say, it was in my
mind to have interpreted that Proposition, as barely intending a sinners
discharge, or disobligation from eternal damnation, which I doubt not, was the
meaning of that worthy Author, even as he seems to explicate himself, saying,
p. 49. God pardeneth sin and removes the guilt of it totally and perfectly, so
that a sin cannot be more pardoned then it is, it is as absolutely forgiven as
can be desired, it can be no better pardoned, then if we were in heaven. But
upon consideration I found a necessity to declare my dissent from him in that
Proposition, together with its explanations: for the sins of the Elect are not
in this life pardoned at all Though the sins of the Elect are actually pardoned
in this life, yet not absolutely as to the continuance of their pardon, the
continuancewherof is not absolutely promised, but upon condition of their
Perseverance.
absolutely (as to discharge from eternal damnation) and therefore I see no
just reason, why any one should say with Mr. Burges, That they are pardoned as
absolutely as can be desired: and if absolute and conditional do vary the
degrees of perfection (as for ought I know they do) I see no warrant to say,
That when God pardons a sin, he does it perfectly: Its true, God does it
perfectly, so far as upon grounds of reason and Religion the Saints can expect
or desire to have it done in this life; viz. conditionally upon their
perseverance in Grace: yet not so perfectly, because not so absolutely, as when
they come to heaven. And I have thought it my part the rather to profess my
dissent in this particular, because such a Position as this, [The Saints here
are as perfectly and absolutely pardoned as can be desired,] does give ground
and countenance to those unwarrantable comforts which the Antinomians, having
spun out of their own fancies, do frequently tender to their Disciples, saying
unto them in these words, or to this effect, Make not the least doubt of your
Salvation, you shall as absolutely go to Heaven as if you were already in
heaven, your sins are as absolutely pardoned as the sins of the Saints, that do
now reign with Christ in glory: of which said Apocryphal and unwarrantable way
of comforting the Saints, I shall have occasion to speak somewhat more
hereafter in a peculiar Consectary.

CHAP. XXII. That forgiveness of sin is a Transient, and not an Immanent Act in
God, proved and cleared. Several Descriptions of Actions Immanent and Transient
set down. Mr. Baxter vindicated in a passage about this distinction, wherein
Mr. Kendal, has (as the Author thinks) causelessly excepted against him.
Transient Actions are of two sorts, and unto what sort of transient Actions
forgiveness of sin is to be reserred.
CONSECT. XV.
15. IT follows, That forgiveness of sin is not an immanent action in God,
but a transient action. I shall the rather endeavor to prove and to clear this
inference, for the following Reasons,

1. Because some of our eminent Divines, not minding to distinguish here (as
they use to do in other things) betwixt Gods purpose to pardon, and his actual
pardon of a sinner, have erroneously asserted, That forgiveness of sin is an
immanent action in God. 2. Because the aforesaid erroneous Assertion is of very
ill influence and consequence, it being (as Mr. Baxter has well observed, and
warnes us therefore of it) one of the maine props and pillars of
Antinomianisme. 3. Because Mr. Baxter says in his Aphorisms of Justification,
p. 174. That albeit he is of opinion with others, That forgiveness of sin is a
transient action; nevertheless, (as he says) he had never the happiness to
see that point cleared by any. 4. Albeit Mr. Baxter himself has endeavored
to clear it, and it is not my purpose to contradict him in ought that he has
said in that behalf; nevertheless I think it expedient, that there should more
be added for clearing the point: for Mr. Baxter defining remission of sin to be
a dissolving or taking away the obligation to punishment (not at all mentioning
the effectual taking away of punishment it self, but leaving that, as I suppose
his intent, to be understood) has endeavored to demonstrate the transiency of
the act of forgiveness, barely with respect to the taking away of the said
obligation to punishment. Because he speaks of Justification or Remission in
Law sense, and not in execution, as being another distinct sort or part of
pardon. As his endeavor therefore has been in that particular, so I shall
endeavor to clear the transiency of the act of forgiveness of sin as it
respects the taking away the punishment it self, which I shall desire to do
with such modesty and sobriety, as finding great cause to approve what Mr.
Burges about this very Point does speak in his entrance thereupon, saying, We
are in mere darkness, and not able to comprehend how God is said to act or
work.
Now for the better clearing of the point in hand, I shall set down in the
first place, what an immanent and transient action is, and what is the
difference betwixt them; and to that end it will be expedient to have recourse
unto what Phylosophical Authors in their metaphysical Divinity have said in the
same; and in special I shall set down the Descriptions which the acute and
learned Scheibler gives of them, Met. lib. 2. p. 233, 234, 235. Actio immanens
dicitur ab immanendo, quod scilicet in agente maneat, quod tamen intelligendum
est non positive, sed negative; nempe, Actio immanens qua talis est, est in
agente hoc sensu, quia non transit ad patiens; in ipso autem agente non est per
modum adjuncti, seu per positivam inhaerentiam in ipso, sed simpliciter ad
ipsum comparatur ut ad causam.

This Explication is the rather to be minded, because in this sense only can
we attribute an immanent action to God; viz. Negative, non Positive, because
God, or the Divine Essence is not capable, as of other compositions, so of
this, viz. of Subject and Accident; such compositions being a, against the
absolute simplicity of the divine nature; for which cause I think Mr. Baxter
And the rather because [to speak precisely] Actiones non habent modum essendi
In, sed modum essendi Ab.
did very well, (having said, that those who speak of immanent acts in God by
[immanent in God] must needs mean Negatively, not Positively) to add this as
the reason thereof, saying, for acts have not the respect of an adjunct to its
subject, but of an effect to its cause. Where (by the way) let me crave leave
to give notice to the Reader, that I cannot but wonder at Mr. Kendals haste and
oversight, so much to mistake Mr. Baxter, as to charge him for rendering that as
a reason of one thing, which he plainly renders as a reason of another. For
Mr. Baxter having given it in as a reason why immanent acts cannot be ascribed
unto God positively, but negatively: [for acts have not the respect of an
adjunct to its subject, but of an effect to its cause.) Mr. Kendal does argue
against him, as if he had rendered that as a reason of his following
conjecture, that he thinks it beyond our understanding to know certainly, that
all Gods immanent acts are eternal. E.g. Whereas Mr. Kendal excepts against Mr.
Baxter, saying that acts have the respect not of an effect to its cause, but of
a cause to its effects. Mr. Kendal might have done well to have more fully
remembered (for he being an excellent Philosopher as well as a Divine, does
know it very well) be difference betwixt cause causalitas, and causatum, actions
being [to speak precisely] causalitates; which causalities, as they do respect
the effect wrought, have the name and respect of causes, but as they do respect
the Agent, they have the respect and name of effect; herein the common saying
in Logic being verified, unaeademque respotest ad diversa referri argumenta.
More I think might justly be spoken to vindicate Mr. Baxter, against what Mr.
Kendal has with such acrimony of style written a against him: but as they said
concerning the blind man, so may I well say in this place concerning one
eagleeyed, Mr. Baxter is of age, let him speak for himself. For my own part,
though I look upon Mr. Kendal as worthy of much honor, not only as a very
Godly and Learned Divine, but as one also who has deserved very well of the
Churches of God for his great and worthy pains against Mr. John Goodwin;
nevertheless I cannot but say of him as he said of Mr. Baxter, viz. Mr. Kendal
having told him that he did ill consult his own honor in opposing in some
points, those two famous Divines Dr. Twisse, and Mr. Pemble) that Mr. Kendal
has ill consulted his own honor by writing in such a sort against Mr. Baxter
in that sheet of paper as he has done; so much cause have the best among us to
pray to God to take away the iniquity of our holy things, and to praydaily,
Forgive us our trespasses, known and unknown.

I shall add no more but this, That having read Mr. Kendals book, as I cannot
but say, that in dealing with Mr. John, Goodwin, Miscuit, utile, dulci; so I
cannot say, that in dealing with Mr. Baxter, Omne tulit punctum.

Craving excuse for this digression, I shall now return. As for a transient
action, it is commonly said to be such as does transire in subjectum externum,
seu extraneam materiem, or is terminated in some subject from without. But
withal we must know, that this is a description of a transient action not in
general, or in its general nature, but of transient actions of one sort or
kind, there being another kind of transient actions, and so styled, because
they do refer ad terminum, seu eum producere, qui sit extra causam agentem;
in which respect creation is justly accounted a transient action: for although
it does not transire in praejacentem materiem (quia actio creantis antevertit
omne subjectum, quia illa est ex nihilo) yet is it such an action of God, by
which God produces something, not in, but without himself. Thus have I set
down what an immanent, and what a transient action is, and the difference
betwixt them out of the aforesaid Author [the one being terminated within the
subject, and working no real change out of it, as does the other:] unto which,
though nothing more seems needful to be added, [the said Author being among
metaphysical Writers in my slender judgment vere (...)] nevertheless be cause
there is a content and pleasure afforded by variety, I shall therefore set
down another description out of Ludovicus Castaneus in his distinctions, as
follows, Actio immanens dicitur, quae manet in eodem supposito, et in eadem
potentia a qua elicitur, ut eligere, velle: Transiens est, quae non recipitur
in potentia, a qua producitur, sive transeat in diversum suppositum [ut
illuminatio dimanans a sole in aerem] sive in distinctam potentiam, aut partem
ejusdem suppositi [ut calefactio, qua manus manum calefacit.] These two actions
in God may very fitly be resembled unto those two kind of actions in men, which
the Philosophers use to style Elicite, and Imperate; the former being Actus
voluntatis, qui producitur immediate ab ipsa voluntate et manet in ea; ut velle
diligere Deum, velle redere debitum, et ejusmodi. Imperatus est ille, qui
producitur ab alia potentia tanquam a principio proximo, et immediato, sed
voluntate illam potentiam movente ad exercitium; ut quando voluntas movet
intellectum ad intelligendum, vel cum movet appetitum ad actum temperantiae,
aut fortitudinis, et sic de aliis. By the premises I suppose, it will in some
good sort appear what actions of God are immanent, and what are transient; in
special it will appear, that among Gods immanent or elicite actions are his
knowledge, volition, bare will, decrees purposes; and of this sort is Gods
decree, will, or purpose to pardon the finnes of his elect; but of the latter
sort, viz. ransient, imperate, transitive, or effective actions (called by
Philosophers Actiones actae) are. Gods ^eal performances and executions of what
he has from all eternity for known, willed, decreed, or purposed; the former
kind of actions depending upon, or having reference unto the sole pleasure of
God; but the latter referring unto, or depending upon the executive power of
God: transient actions being not effected but by the application of Gods power,
made by his will and pleasure; whereby to work, or effect the thing which God
did will or purpose: And that forgiveness of sin is of this latter sort of
actions ((...)) does seem to me sufficiently apparent by several reasons; e.g.

1. Because datur externum subjectum in quod transit, which said subject is the
penitent, believing, and converting sinner. 2 Because in the said Subject God
does producere aliquid extra esse; viz. God does actually remove those evils,
or punishments, which were inflicted upon the sinner, working in, or upon the
sinner a real change from what he was before. And when I say a real change, it
comes into my mind to annex hereunto as a sixteenth Inference or Consectary,
viz.
CHAP. XXIII. That remission of sin, ( quoad terminum remotum, or as in
execution) is a real, yea, Physical change, What is said in this Consectary, I
mean concerning remission of sin in execution, and not of remission, as barely
disobliging to punishment, which in the close of this consectary I do acknowledge
to be but a change of our relation.
and not a change purely Relative, as is commonly supposed.
CONSECT. XVI.
16. THat the difference betwixt Sanctification and Justification is not (as
has been commonly said,) That that does work a real change in a sinner, but
this a change barely and purely Relative: for both of them, viz. Gods
sanctifying, and Gods justifying or pardoning a sinner; (I say, or Gods
pardoning a sinner; for Justification and Remission of sin are all one, as I
shall demonstrate in the sequel of this Exercitation;) do work in or upon the
sinner a real change: and as to the reality therefore of a change there seems
to me to be no difference at all; and yet there being sundry kinds of real
changes, or all real changes being not of the same kind, this to my seeming is
the difference betwixt them; viz. That Gods sanctifying a sinner, does work a
real change in the sinner, from Corruption to Grace, from the evil of sin, to
the good of holiness; which for that cause may not unfitly be styled a real,
moral, or holy change; and Gods justifying or pardoning a sinner, does work in
him, or upon him, a real change from the evil of misery or punishment, to the
good of happiness; and which for that reason, and docendi gratia, I may style
a real, physical, or political, or happy change: but why this change should be
styled purely relative, and be denied to be real, in way of contradiction to
that of Sanctification, I for my part am not as yet convinced, this change
being such in reality and in very deed, as is wrought in or upon a poor naked
and wounded man, when of poor he is made rich, and of wounded is made whole.
Thus really, as to me seems, does Gods justifying or pardoning a sinner,
alter or change the sinner from what he was before, as well in person as in
relation; the subjects of this change as really differing from those who are
not justified and pardoned, as does a child of wrath and mercy, or as does a
Saint in glory from a Reprobate in hell. Solid and judicious Mr. Blake, in his
Vindiciae Foeaeris, in his undertaking to prove Justification to be not an
Immanent, but a transient act in God, does seem to vary from what has been
commonly taught by our Divines, in acknowledging that the Effect which
Justification does work, as terminated in a sinner, is a The like also does Mr.
Burges acknowledge in his Book of Justif. p. 169.
real Effect: for otherwise I see no cause why he should parallel Gods grace in
justifying a sinner, to the grace or favor which Pharaoh did express toward
Joseph in bringing him out of Prison, saying, That act of Pharaoh had as real
an effect upon Joseph, and was terminated in him in his advancement out of
Prison, for rule in Egypt, as though a Physician in case of sickness had
wrought a cure upon him. For my own part, I cannot but think, that look what
real change is wrought in a poor prisoner by his deliverance out of prison, or
in a wounded man by his cure, such a real change is wrought in or upon a sinner
by Gods justifying and pardoning him; Gods remitting sinners being resembled
to, or being set forth by healing the broken hearted, delivering Captives, and
setting at liberty them that are bruised. And yet notwithstanding the said
comparison to illustrate that change which Justification does work in a sinner,
Mr. Blake (and in that particular I am not satisfied) does expressly deny, That
Justification does work any physical change in man; and in that saying I cannot
but profess my dissent from him. The reason why our Divines have commonly
denied, that Justification or remission of sin does work any real change, or
any change upon the sinner more then relative, I humbly conceive to be this;
viz. Because they do generally look upon remission of sin to be only a
disobligation of the sinner from punishment; i. e. from being bound to suffer
that punishment, which otherwise would have been sooner or later inflicted: but
seeing remission of sin is as well Gods taking away of punishment already
inflicted upon the sinner, as Gods discharge of the sinner from being obliged
to suffer that punishment, which otherwise according to desert, he would have
inflicted at one time or other; as in this respect the change is relative, so
in that respect it is unquestionably real.

CHAP. XXIV. The Description of forgiveness of sin, given by that very learned
and godly Divine, Dr. Twisse (which is by some highly commended as most
accurate) examined and refuted; and the evil consequences of the same detected;
together with the Authors Apology for his taking upon him in ought to express
his dissent from men of such prime worth, (Stars of the first Magnitud) as
confessedly that Doctor was.
CONSECT. XVII.
17. IT follows, That that Description of D. Twisse undertaking to acquaint us
with the nature or quiddity of Remission of sin, is not Vsquequaque quadrant,
and consistent with truth, he saying, That remission of sin is nothing else but
either Gods denying to punish, or else his will not to punish: His words are,
Remissio peccatorum, si quidditatem inspicias, nihil aliud est, quam aut
punitionis negatio, aut volitionis puniendi negatio. Lib. 2. page 273. It is
the latter part of the Doctors description which I do dissent from, and shall
endeavor to expugne.

In my entrance hereupon, I shall suspect that some will censure my attemps
herein (as also what I shall in an intended supplement to this Discourse
attempt in one point against Mr. Pemble) as an act of insolency and
unsufferable presumption; objecting against me with such reproach, as Mr.
Kendal does against Mr. Baxter for a like attempt against the self same
renowned Author, saying, -- Sic dama Leonem
Insequitur, audetque viro concurere virgo.


Surely Mr. Kendal has said, Satis pro imperio, and satis pro opprebrio,
whereby to deter any such as I am from contradicting ought in the said worthy
Authors, he having concluded his Digression against Mr. Baxter with this
Sarcasme, -- Ne tu divinam Iliada tents,
Sed long sequere, and vestigia semper adora.


But my Apology is, 1. As I do much magnify the said Authors, (Dr. Twisse and
Mr. Pemble, worthily accounted among the most pious and learned Divines that
our English Nation has brought forth) so I should abhor my self as in dust
and ashes, should my conscience in the least accuse me of any willingness to
detract from them, or of seeking to magnify my self in opposing them; unto
whose inferiors by very many degrees I must ever confess my self inferior
not a little.

2 An endeavor (as in the fear of God with modesty and humility) to discover
error in whomsoever, and to vindicate the truth (specially such Truths and
Errors which are of momentous consequence) will be (I doubt not) acceptable to
God, however it should prove ungrateful to some men.

3. By how much any man is more eminently pious and learned who has vented and
labored in the support of an Error, by so much the more taking and spreading
is the Error like to prove.

4. I am verily persuaded, that were the foresaid Authors ((...)) now living
upon earth, they would upon all due occa^ion, declare themselves to be men
after David's heart in this particular (even as David was a man after Gods own
heart in the general;) viz. accounting it their happiness to see that as an
error, which they looked upon as a truth, and a kindness from any one, who
under God should prove the instrument of such a discovery.

5. If I my self, when first a Student in controversal divinity, being less
able to distinguish betwixt things that differ, have been ready to swallow all
things as true which I have read in the foresaid Authors; is it not my duty
being now converted, to strengthen my brethren?

Now for the purpose in hand, viz. for discovery, that Gods Negatio volitionis
puniendi, is no part of the pardon of sin, be it considered.

1. That the pardon of sin, both the whole and every part thereof, is [ in toto
and in solido, as we use to say] to be ascribed to the merits, bloodshed, or
satisfaction of the Lord Jesus Christ, as the meritorious and pr^curing cause
thereof, as is abundantly test^fied in Scripture, Ephesians. 1 7. Col 1.14. But
Gods Negatio volitionis puniendi is not to be ascribed to Christ's blood shed or
satisfaction as the procuring or meritorious cause thereof. For Gods Negatio
volitionis puniendi is all one with his velle non punire, as the Doctor does
immediately express himself afterward; and Gods velle non punire is all one
with his velle misereri, which said velle non punire, or velle misereri, are
precedent, and not consequent to the consideratation of Christ's bloodshed and
Satisfaction: For Christ by his satisfaction or blood shed, did procure and
purchase for sinners (as our Divines in answer to those Arguments which the
Socinians do object against Christ's satisfaction usually acknowledge) not Gods
misereri velle, but his misereri posse. In saying so I do not exclude but
include the particular fruits of Gods mercy, as purchased by the blood of
Christ.
Briefly, Gods velle non punire, is all one exactly in sense and substance with
his election, or electing love; which albeit it is in Christ, yet it is not for
Christ, i. e. not for Christ as the procurer or purchaser thereof, as the Doctor
himself in a large dispute does prove, lib. 1. p. 151. there being scarce any
one of our reformed Divines, except Rolloc, who says the contrary.

2. Gods will not to punish, is all one as his purpose not to punish. Now,
albeit this will or purpose (being all one with election) is the rise or
fountain of pardon, yet is it not pardon it self, or any part or parcel of it,
but differs as much from it, as a gift does from the free love and good will of
him, who did bestow it, or did design the bestowing of it. Briefly, Gods
willing not to punish, is nothing else but Gods purpose to pardon. Now Gods
purpose to pardon is one thing, and pardon it self is another, as has been
before proved.

3. Gods not willing to punish is (as the Doctor himself does rightly
acknowledge in the following column) an immanent act in God, and from
eternitity, and no consequent of faith (he might have added likewise, no
consequent of Christ's merits and satisfaction as was aforesaid.) But remission
of sin is not an immanent act in God, nor from eternity (as was before proved)
[for albeit God does from eternity will the remission of our sins, yet he does
not will the remission of our sins from eternity;] and it is moreover (as shall
hereafter in due place be proved) a consequent of our faith: Ergo, Gods not
willing to punish sin, is no part of (however a thing necessarily presupposed
unto) the pardon of sin, (...). I have thought it my duty to give notice of,
and to animadvert upon this (...), or oversight in the Doctor, because (as to
me seems) it was the cause of certain other errors in him tending to the
weakening of his own authority, and to the strengthening of the hands of the
Antinomian party; (that I may not add also) to the hardening of his Arminian
adversaries. E. g.

1. He makes the sense only of pardon, and not pardon it self to be the
effect, or consequent of faith, or that which does terminate our believing,
lib. 2. p. 273. making faith to be necessary only in this respect, viz. Vt
gratia, ac misericordia divina in peccatis propter Christum remittendis nobis
innotescat, that divine grace and mercy in forgiving our sins for Christ's
sake, may be manifested or made known unto us, lib. 2. p. 276, 277.

2. Yea, though the Doctor does frequently acknowledge, that Christ has
impetrated, purchased, or procured for the elect remission of sin;
Nevertheless how the merits of Christ should be necessary for more then the
effecting the sight, sense, or knowledge of the said pardon according to the
Doctors own principles, I for my part, do not conceive; and let the Reader
judge by the following evidence. E. g. 1. The Doctor does deny that Christ did
purchase for believers Gods velle remittere, or his will to pardon them, lib.
2. p. 273. And so far I believe him to be in the right.

2. He does deny that Christ did purchase for believers, Gods misereri posse,
or a power in God to pardon them [justitia non obstante] his justice
notwithstanding, and this he does endeavor industriously to prove, not only
against Arminius, but also against Piscator and Lubbertus, who did strenuously
assert the contrary, lib. 1. p. 278. But in that particular, I cannot but
dissent from him; Amyraldus being so far offended both with him and
Rutherford (as I remember) in that behalf, as to think himself excusable in a
lesser regard of their authority in that important point of Universal
redemption; I mean, as understood in the middle sense with Davenant, Camero,
and others.

Now if Christ did purchase neither will nor power in God to pardon (as says
the Doctor) how can we rationally conclude that Christ did purchase any more
then the sense and manifestation of pardon? I desire that what I have here
written in the way of refutation of Doctor Twisse his Description of
forgiveness of sin and in my demonstrating the evil consequences thereof, may
the rather be well weighed and duly considered, because Mr. Will. Air in his
late Book against Mr. Woodbridg does highly applaud the said description given
by the Doctor as a description most accurate; it being (as I think I have made
apparent) no otherwise accurate then in this sense; viz as accurately
serviceable for Mr. Air his purpose whereby to uphold his unjustifiable
opinion of a man's being actually justified with out or before faith.
This indeed is a conclusion; which as it does follow (for ought I know) from
the Doctors premises, so also from the Antinomians Principles, which some of
them being sensible of, have chosen rather then to leave their opinion, to
swallow down the iniquity and absurdity thereof, and to assert, That Christ did
not purchase or procure any love from God for man: but only published and
declared, That he was from eternity beloved and pardoned. A Doctrine fitter for
a Tho. Collier and a Paul Hobson, then for any well grounded Divine to own; and
by how much we do detest such a Doctrine, by so much it concerns us to beware
how we take in those Principles, or lay and own those grounds, that will
necessarily (but unawares) lead us to it.

3 The Doctor holds, That remission of sin, and the acceptance of our persons
with God, do only note certain internal and immanent Actions in God, which
never had any beginning with God. Lib. 3. page 434.

4. He asserts, That the Righteousness of Christ was ours before faith, that
faith does not interesse us in it, or give us any new right unto Christ's
Righteousness, which we had not before, but only the sight, sense, and
agnition of the same. Yea, whereas the learned Lubbert against Vorstius, had
said most Orthodoxly, Quod satisfactio Christi non est mea, aut tua, priusquam
ego aut tu eam vera side receperimus; The Doctor does go about to spoil that
saying of his, by affixing to it his own heterodox sense. Lib, 2. p 277. It is
a very strange thing, that such a learned Philosopher and Schoolman as Doctor
Twisse, (famous for that throughout all Protestant Churches) should not
distinguish betwixt Gods designing his Sons Righteousness for us, or to be
ours, and that by Faith, or by means of faith, or upon the conditions of faith;
and betwixt Gods actually making it ours, or actually bestowing it upon us, or
investing us into it upon our believing.

And whereas he says, That Christ's Righteousness is ours, Quatenus ex
intention Dei Patris, and Christi pro nobis praestita, as it was performed on
our behalf by virtue of the intention of God and Christ.

I answer, 1. That hints no more but this; viz. That God and Christ did design
or purpose it for us. 2 From thence the Doctor himself might have concluded
against himself; viz. That Christ's Righteousness is not actually made ours
before we believe; for what is intended for me is not mine, before it be
actually conferred upon me; and this actual conferring of Christ's
Righteousness upon us, is not (as says the Scripture) before we believe.


5 He says, (ibidem, and to the same purpose as before) that the merits of
Christ are not applied to us by faith before God, but only [apud conscientias
nostras,] in our own consciences, and that Christ's Righteousness is said to be
imputed unto us by faith, only, because by faith [imputari dignoscitur,] it is
known to us to be imputed.

6. As he does oppose Arminius in his sense of the distinction betwixt
Redemption and Remission of sin, as impetrated, and as applied, so the Doctor
errs on the other hand in his own sense, or sensing of that distinction,
making the application thereof by faith unto us, [Non ut sint, sed ut
sentiantur, percipiantur, agnoscantur;] not that they may be ours indeed, and
actually; but that they may appear, be felt, known, and acknowledged as ours;
Lib. 2. page 277. and Lib. 3. page 434.

Here again it seems very strange, That so accute and profound a man as the
Doctor was, should forget to distinguish betwixt Remission and Redemption, as
purchased or procured for us, and as actually conferred or bestowed upon us.

The foresaid particulars, as I conceive them to be mistakes in the Doctor,
and of an ill aspect and influence, so I am persuaded, they were all, or the
most of them occasioned from his Error about the nature of forgiveness of
sin, making it (at least in part) to be Gods nolle punire, or velle non punire,
Gods not willing to punish.

CHAP. XXV. That a Believer, his pardon notwithstanding, is in his confession
of sin to put himself under the curse of the Law; Why and how declared. That a
sinner after pardon, is a sinner, and that God does look upon him as a sinner,
albeit he does not deal with him, or punish him as such.
CONSECT. XVIII.
18. IT follows, That a Believer, notwithstanding his pardon, is still to put
himself in his confession of sin, undre the curse of the Law, as guilty
thereof; i. e. to acknowledge himself guilty of hell it self, and eternal
damnation, to present himself before God with such a degree and depth of
humble devotion, as did Ezra in the name of the whole Church, saying to this
purpose, O Lord the righteous God, I am here before thee in my trespasses, I
cannot stand before thee because of my sins. In such sort, and with such
acknowledgments of their guiltiness the best amongst Gods servants and
Prophets were wont to make their humble addresses to, and before God. See Psalm.
130.3. If thou Lord should mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? and
Psalm. 143. beg. Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord, for in thy
sight shall no man living be justified. Job 9.2, 3. How shall man be just with
God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. Dan.
9.7, 8 Daniel himself does there acknowledge, That confusion of face does belong
unto him; i. e. was deserved by him, or did belong unto him, in his own pure
and proper deserving. So that every sinner, whether pardoned, or not pardoned,
so long as he lives on earth, is to confess to God his desert or guiltiness
to punishment; yea, could it be proved, that the Saints in heaven do confess
their former sins to God, I would not doubt to affirm, That even they in
heaven, together with their sins, do also confess the As that guilt Which is
taken off from the sinner by a pardon is commonly styled Reatus poenae; so that
guilt which is never taken off, and of which alone I speak, and would be
understood to speak in this Consectary, is commonly styled, Reatus culpae, of
which see Mr. Burges in his S^rmons of Justification, p. 134. And I think it
not amiss to give the Reader to unde^stand, how several Writers do in several
expressions declare the difference betwixt Reatus culpae and Reatus poenae; e.
g. The former is styled by some, Meritum poenae; and the latter, Obligatio ad
luendam poenam; by others the former is styled, Duenesse of punishment to our
sins; the latter, Duenesse of punishment to our persons; which latter is it
alone which remission of sin does free us from, because what is due to our sins
is inflicted upon the person of another; viz. Jesus Christ. By others, the
former is styled Guilt potential, and the latter, Guilt actual.
guilt or merit of them, the inward, innate dignity, or desert of them, or
their guiltiness of Gods wrath by reason of them; this kind of guilt being as
inseparable from sin as heat is from fire.

I think this inference the rather to be observed, not only because it is
practical, and of frequent use, but also because of that new mode or model of
praying taken up by too too many in these times, infected with Antinomian
leaven, who do so neglect the confession of their sins, and the guilt thereof,
together with supplication to the Lord for the pardon of them, as if these were
no parts of prayer for a believer, or as if they were antiquated, and like an
old Almanac, useless and out of date. Or if they do make the said confessions
and supplications, they do but juggle and dissemble, saying, (if they be
reasoned with) That praying with others, or as the voice of others, it is the
sin and guilt of the wicked and unbelievers which they confess, and of which
they pray for pardon; but not of their own and of the godly, of the pardon
whereof they are already assured; faith it self being in their sense, and
according to their Apocryphal Gospel, nothing else but a firm belief or
persuasion, that all their sins past, present, and to come, were remitted at
once, and that from eternity. The not understanding the true nature of
forgiveness of sin, as well wherein it does not consist, as wherein it does
consist (as has been opened and asserted in the Premises) is a main reason (as
I humbly conceive) of the pride and profaneness of that sort of people, both
in this particular and sundry other ways.

What I have said as the ground of this Inference, I would have the Reader to
know, That it does fully agree with what Mr. Burges says in his book of
Justification, p. 29. Now when sin is forgiven, the sense is (says he) not
that he is made innocent again, for that can never be helped; but that it must
be affirmed, such a one has sinned; this cannot be repaired again. And
therefore if any Reader is not able to reconcile what Mr. Burges has there
said, with what he says, p. 142. When God does pardon sin, he takes it away
so, as that the party acquitted is no more looked upon as a sinner; All the
expressions about pardon amount to thus much, Even as when one accused of theft
and murder in the Commonwealth, and is legally acquitted by the Judge, he is no
more reputed a Thief or Murderer: Therefore it is a calumny of the Papists, as
if we held, That a man is a sinner after God has pardoned him. If any one, I
say, cannot reconcile these sayings with the former, I would advise him (if I
might be so bold with my betters, to observe well what he says in the former
place, and to let that pass what he says in the latter passage. For my own
part, as I must profess my insufficiency to reconcile Mr. Burges to himself
in the said passages, and withal my ignorance, that I know no such calumny of
the Papists against us; so (had I known it) I would not have sought by an
answer to have wiped it off; for I am persuaded with Mr. Burges in p. 19. That
a man after God has pardoned him, is not made innocent again; and if he be not
innocent again, he is (to my thinking) a sinner still, and as we are, so does
God look upon us, for his unerring eye sees all things as they are, and not
otherwise; and as for all the expressions of Scripture about the pardon of sin,
they do (being rightly understood and interpreted) amount to this; viz. That
albeit a sinner being pardoned, is not thereby made innocent, but is still
guilty, and a sinner; and albeit God does look upon such a one as a sinner, and
as guilty; viz in the sense aforesaid, nevertheless God of his superabounding
grace and mercy, in and for Christ's sake, does not deal with such a one
according to his sin and guilt, or merit. To this sense, and no more, do I take
that of the Prophet Jeremy to amount, which is one of the highest expressions
touching the pardon of sin that we read of in the Scripture, chap. 50.20. In
those days and at that time, says the Lord, The iniquity of Israel shall be
sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not
be found; for I will pardon them. This expression, I say, is Tantamount (as I
think) but this, That God will in his great mercy so deal with his Church* as
if she had been innocent, or as if she had not transgressed.

The whole of this inference is grounded on what was aforesaid concerning the
nature of forgiveness of sin, wherein it does not consist; viz. Not in making
a sinner to be no sinner, or a a guilty person not guilty, as in the sense
aforesaid.

The next Inference will be grounded upon what was said concerning the
obligation of a sinner to hell and damnation, being taken off not absolutely in
this life, but conditionally; viz. upon condition of their perseverance in the
faith.

But in the close of this Consectary, let me inform the Reader, how that since
I wrote this Exercitation, I have read Mr. Wottons learned Book, De
Reconciliatione, as also Mr. Pembles book of Justification, in both which I
find the truth of that which Mr. Burges does say, and of which I was ignorant
before; viz That the Papists do charge us for asserting, That a sinner after
pardon does remain a sinner. And I find, that Mr. Pemble does endeavor to wipe
off that imputation, by saying That sin is pardoned both in the guilt and in
the fault: In which answer of his I am very much dissatisfied, having before
proved, That the remission of the fault, is the remission of the very
punishment; or that the remission of the pun^shment is wholly and solely that
wherein the remission of the fault does consist; the remission of the fault and
punishment not being two things distinct, but exactly one and the same: so that
wheresoever we read in Gods Word concerning the remission of our faults, or
sins, we are to understand thereby, the remission of the punishment due to our
said faults or sins.

The phrase, [To be looked upon as a sinner,] is indeed an ambiguous phrase,
implying (according to the usual distinction of Gods sight, or sight in God it
being taken either in sensu simplici, or in sensu connotativo) either Gods bare
or mere intuitive sight, and beholding us as sinners; or else his dealing with
us as sinners: in which latter sense it is most true, That God does not look
upon a sinner pardoned as a sinner (for then he should look upon him as not
pardoned; since Gods pardon is his not dealing with a sinner as a sinner; i. e.
according to his desert by sin;) and for this reason I do allow, and not
quarrel with the foresaid expression, it being also an expression very near to
Scripture: but in the former respect God does look upon him as a sinner, for
otherwise he should not look upon him as pardoned, it being impossible, ex
natura rei either for God or man in this sense to look upon any person as
pardoned, and not as a sinner; for still where there is pardon there must be
Sin is the res substracta to pardon.
sin, else a person were not in a capacity of pardon.

Now as I am not satisfied with Mr. Pembles, so neither with Mr. Burges his
answer to the foresaid imputation of the Papists, the one saying, That both the
fault or guilt is taken away by pardon; and the other granting, that we hold,
That a sinner is not a sinner after God has pardoned him; which I for my part
cannot see reason to grant, because (as has been before proved) the effect of
pardon is not to make a sinner no sinner, but not to deal with him as a sinner,
or in the phrase of the Psalmist, Psalm. 103.10. Not to deal with him after his
sins, or to reward him according to his iniquities. I doubt that some will
sharply censure, and almost be imbittered against me for thus scanning the
words of such most learned and godly men, (with whom, it is true, I am not
worthy to be named the same day) and will prophecy concerning me, That I shall
be sure to have the same measure from others, in having all my words and
sentences scanned to purpose; but my own heart witnessing to me, That I do
bless and magnify the name of God for those men and their excellent Labors,
from whom in some things I do express my dissent, and that I do endeavor,
expiscari veritatem, to find out the truth with all due respect, and in another
sense, without any respect to persons; I am hopeful, that the most of my
reverend and learned brethren in the Ministry will not hold me guilty,
especially when I shall profess before the world (even as I now do by these
presents;) viz. That if there be any man who shall evidence that to be current
and justifiable, wherein I do declare my dissent or dissatisfaction, I shall not
in any measure (by the grace of God) be offended at the discovery of Truth,
though thereby, and therewithal my own weakness of judgment be discovered
also.

CHAP. XXVI. That a Believer during his warfare on earth, is to fear Hell and
damnation; why, and how proved and manifested; as also cleared in the way of
answer to several Objections, notwithstanding the Doctrine of Perseverance of
the Saints be acknowledged; in answer to which objections, the consistency and
cooperation of the love of God, and the fear of God is proved. What manner of
fear it is that love does expel, and what manner of fear it is that love does
retain declared: Notwithstanding, that Believers are restrained by the love of
God, yet that God does use several other means whereby to constrain; i. e.
effectually to induce them, proved: and what those several means are, specified
more at large. The consistency and cooperation of faith and fear, maintained
and proved. That filial and slavish fear do not d^ffer in their object matter,
or in the thing feared, but in the manner of fearing, asserted, and how, proved
and cleared by a due interpretation of that Scripture in Luke 1.74. The
difference betwixt fear as it is the fruit of the spirit of bondage, and as a
fruit of the Spirit of Adoption, opened and asserted.
CONSECT. XIX.
19. IT follows, That a person justified and pardoned, As a wicked man is to
hope for heaven suppositively; i.e. if he turn from sin, and return to God; so
a godly man is to fear hell suppositively; i.e if he turn from God, and return
to fin.
believersthemselvs, so long as they are militant here on earth, are to fear
Hell and damnation; namely upon supposition of their Apostasy and backsliding,
or unless they do continue in the doctrine and practice of the faith.

Albeit this inference be very clear from the Premises, and of unavoidable
necessity, nevertheless I shall be very punctual and copious, as well in the
proving of it by other Scriptures, as in answering such Objections as may, or
are usually made against it by the Antinomians; and this I shall the rather do
for the following Reasons.

1. Because it is a Truth under much prejudice, and against which many
misinformed people, especially the Antinomians, do conceive such indignation
of heart, as that upon the hearing thereof from the mouth of any Minister, they
are ready almost to rend their clothes, as the Jews were wont to do upon the
hearing of blasphemy, crying out against us, and saying, Away with such legal
Preachers from the Church, it is not fit that they should live upon the
maintenance, or bear the name of Gospel Ministers.

2. It is a truth of concernment, the greater, by how much the contrary
Doctrine is of consequenc. (as I think) exceeding dangerous: for I cannot
easily think any opinion more dangerous for a Christian to entertain then this;
viz. That he is to live altogether without the fear of hell, as being in no
possible danger thereof. I read of some in these times (particularly of one
Coppin, who preaching frequently in these parts, as in several other Countyes
in the Land, has gathered of the profane sort of people sundry Disciples after
him) who do hold, that there is This appears by several Pamphlets in print
under the name of Rich. Coppin.
no Resurrection, no day of Judgment, no Salvation, no Damnation, no Heaven,
nor Hell, but what is in this life. Next to the belief of this, [That there is
no hell after death,] I hold this opinion or belief to be most dangerous; viz.
That a Christian, after he is once a true Believer, is in no danger at all of
hell, and is not therefore in any sort to entertain the fear of it.

3. As the danger is very great, so it is very common; for we see in
experience, how ordinary it is with the Antinomians to cast off all fear, and
that which should cause fear; viz. the threatenings of God in Scripture, as not
at all, or in any sense concerning them. As it is the profession of some in
these times to live above all Ordinances and all Scripture, even every part of
Gods Word, so it is the profession of the Antinomians, though not to live above
all Ordinances and all Scriptures, yet to live above all the thereatnings of
Scripture, and above all the curses and comminations of the Word of God, in so
much that as God laid it to the charge of his Israel of old, that he had
written unto them the great things of his Law, but they accounted them as a
strange thing, Hos. 8.12. So may it be said of the Antinomians, with respect
to the comminations of the Word, God has written unto them the grand
threatenings of his Law, and they look upon them as strange things; as things
strange to them, because in no sort (as they think) concerning them, or written
as intended for them, but only for the wicked, who are actually under the
curse. This their practice is so much the more dangerous, because as to live
above one part [the threatnings] of the Word is, a ready way to live above
another part [the Precepts] of the Word; so many of those Arguments whereby
they plead to defend their practice in casting off the threatenings of Scripture
as useless to them, will by their direct consequence lead them to cast off
both Precepts and Promises as useless also.

Now for the proof the Point, let the following particulars be considered.

1. That God does no less threaten the godly themselves with hell and
damnation, if they fall away from their goodness, then he does the wicked if
they continue in their wickedness. See for this My intent in quoting those
Scriptures is not as that of the Remonstrants to prove the Apostasy of the
Saints; but to prove that God does threaren them, that if they do as others do,
they shall so suffer as others suffer; which they are to believe, or to make
account of, and acordingly to fear.
Ezekiel. 18.24. 1 Chronicles. 28.9. Romans 8.13. Heb. 10.38, 39. Matthew. 6.15. Not to
transcribe the fore cited places at length, we do perceive plainly therein,
that in case the godly do fall from their righteousness, do forsake God, do
live after the flesh, do draw back, do not forgive one another their
trespasses, God will not pardon them, will have no pleasure in them, will cast
them off for ever. Yea, I am persuaded, that upon search of Scripture it will
be found that the most terrible threatenings of all other are directed to the
Saints, and the most fearful things that are threatened to any are threatened to
them, in case of their not persevering in the faith. For which see Heb. 6.4, 5,
6. and 10.26 27. 2 Pet. 2.20, 21.

2 Consider to what end God does so threaten them, or direct the said
threatenings to them. And to a Question of that nature propounded, I answer, 1.
To beget the faith. 2. The fear of them.


1. To beget in the Saints a belief of the said Threatenings, or that they might
believe them: for God is to be believed in all his sayings, of what nature
soever they be, or whatever the contents there of are, the truth of God being
alike in all his sayings. It is no less the duty of the godly to believe God in
what he threatens to them, then of the wicked to believe God in what he
threatens to them; according to the pattern of the men of Nineveh, of whom it
is said, That in what was threatened by Jonah they believed God. Jonah 3.5. And
according to the pattern of Noah, who believed Gods threatening the world with a
universal deluge, Heb. 11.7.

Briefly, As the Israelites were to hear the curses of the Law denounced upon
Mount Ebal, as well as the blessings thereof pronounced upon Mount Gerizim, and
were to say Amen to the former as well as to the latter, so the godly are to
affix their Amen, or to put their Seal of Faith unto the Threatenings as well as
to the Promises of the Word, whenever they read or hear them; yea, they are
as well to read and hear the Threatenings as the Promises of Scripture with an
applicative faith; i.e look in what sort, or sense, in what cases, or upon what
suppositions God does denounce his threatenings against them, in such cases, or
upon such suppositions they are to apply the curses and threatenings of God to
their own souls, no less then in other respects or upon other suppositions
they are to apply the Promises of the Word; all Scripture (Threatenings as well
as Promises) being written for the learning of the godly. And accordingly we
find that the Saints have applied the curses and comminations of the Word to
themselves. Heb. 2 3. How shall we escape (says Saint Paul) if we neglect so
great Salvation? 1 Cor. 9.16. Woe is me (says the same Apostle) if I preach not
the Gospel. 2 John 8. Look to your selves, that we lose not the things which we
have wrought.

2 To beget fear in them. As the immediate end of Gods Promises is to beget
hope, so the immediate end of his Threatenings is to beget fear; the subject of
the one (good things) being the proper object of Hope; and the subject of the
other (evil things) being he proper object of Fear. This fear is commanded the
Saints in sundry Scriptures, Heb: 12.28, 29. Let us have grace to serve God
acceptably with reverence and godly fear Andlest any man should think, that it
is not the property of a godly man (who is designed for heaven, or to receive a
Kingdom that cannot beshaken) to fear Hell, as if such afear could not be a
godly fear; observe therefore the Apostles reason, For our God is a consuming
fire. It is a Threatening taken out of the Old Testament, which the Apostle, a
Gospel Minister, did not scruple to apply to New Testament Believers Deuteronomy.
4.24. See also Heb. 4 1. Let us therefore fear lest a Promise being left us of
entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come sho^t of it: q.d. As in
every Threatening there is vertually a Promise (for he that expresses,
Whosoever believes not shall be damned; does imply in the way of Promise, He
that believes shall be saved;) so in every Promise there is vertually a
Threatening (he that promises, Whosoever endures to the end shall be saved,
does implicitly threaten, That those who do not endure to the end shall be
damned.) Let us therefore fear, left such a said Promise (vertually containing
a Threatening) being left unto us, any of us should fall short of it. See also
Luke 12.4, 5. where Christ does command his Disciples to fear God because of
Hell; I say, because of Hell: for that description [ Who, or which, Which after
he has killed] is ratiocinative, or causal; i.e. it imports the reason or
motive of that counsel which Christ gives his Disciples of searing God, to be
his power of casting into hell, together with his pleasure so to do in case
they should fear man and not him. The Relative Particle which, is not in the
Orginal, the Apostle expressing himself in a Particle of the Present Tense
[Fear him, having power.] Now I think it a good Observation of him that tells
us, saying, It is a known propriety of the Greek tongue to import the Reasons
or Grounds of things by their Particles, as in 1 Timothy 5.17.

I shall in the next place apply my self to make answer to such Objections as
may be, or usually are made against this Truth; e.g.

Obj. 1. What good Believers do, or what evils they do avoid, they do them, and
avoid them out of a principle of life and love, and not out of fear?

Answ. Let it be first rightly understood what the meaning of the word [Life]
is, and what it is to do a thing out of a principle of life; for which purpose
be it known, That all of us being by nature dead in trespasses and sins, we
are not able to do any good of our selves, no more then a dead man is able to
perform the actions of a living man. God must quicken us by his Holy Spirit,
and regenerate us by his grace, before we can do any thing that is good in a
spiritual and acceptable manner as to Salvation; so that to do a thing out of a
principle of life, is to do it as one being quickened, renewed, and regenerated
by the sanctifying Spirit of God.

Now this being the meaning of that phrase, I answer, That by the same reason
that a beliver is said to do the good he does out of a principle of life and
love, he may be said to do it out of a principle of life and fear: for

1. The love of God, and the fear of God, are not things opposite, but
consistent with the same subject.

2. It is as well the command of God to a Believer, and consequently the duty
of a believer to fear God, as to love him; yea, to fear the threatenings of God,
as Josiah d^d 2 Chronicles. 34.19* 21. I doubt not, but this fear was one part of,
or one ingredient into that tenderness of heart for which that gracious King is
commended, 2 Chronicles. 34 27.

3. The fear of God is as well a fruit of Christ's holy Spirit as is the love of
God; for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, Ephesians. 5.11. which Spirit
is therefore styled, the Spirit of the fear of the Lord, Isat. 11.2.

4. The fear of God is as well a qualification of that service which we owe and
do to God, as is the love of God. Psalm. 2.11. Serve the Lord with fear, and
rejoice with trembling. Hebr. 12.28 Let us have grace to serve God acceptably
with reverence and godly fear.

Obj. 2. Believers are to fear God and his goodness, Hos. 3.5. (The children of
Israel shall fear the Lord and his goodness.) They are to fear God and his
Commandments, Ezra 10.3. (Let us make a Covenant according to the counsel of my
Lord, and of those that tremble at the Commandments of our God) and therefore
they are not to fear God and his threatenings, wreth, ourse.

Answ. The things which are consistent are therefore not to be opposed, but
composed; and what God has joined in his Word, we are to keep together, and by
no means to put asunder. Be it known therefore, that as God is (...); as God (I
say) is Maximus, as well as Optimus, The great, righteous, and terrible Lord
God, Dan. 9.4. Nehem 9.32 as well as a good and gracious Father; so is he to be
dreaded in regard of his power, wrath, judgments, as well as to be feared or
loved in regard of his goodness, pity, kindness: Yea, one special reason why a
Saint does tremble, and is to tremble at the commandments of God, is because of
the wrath, power, and justice of God, (they being the Commandments of that
Lawgiver, who alone is able to save and to destroy, James 4.12. and they being
Commandments not without a Sanction; i.e. comminations of terror annexed to
them, which God in Justice is obliged to execute.)

And that it is the duty of believers not only to fear God, because of his
goodness, but moreover because of his wrath, and the curse, may be undoubtedly
proved.

1. Because they are upon this ground commanded, or for this reason instigated,
and urged to fear him, as was before said out of Luke 12.4, 5. Hebr. 12.28, 29.

2. Because God does no less threaten them then he does any others with wrath
and judgment, in case of their Apostasy, as was before proved; the end of the
said threatenings being to beget fear in the Saints, God thereby intimating not
only what is in his power to do, but moreover what is his pleasure actually to
do in the said cases, or upon the said suppositions of their Apostasy.

3. Because the Saints, who have in this sort stood in awe of God, are
commended in Scripture, and their examples recorded for our imitation. See the
example of David and Job, Psalm. 119.120. My flesh trembles for fear of thee,
and I am afraid of thy Judgments. Job 31* 23 For destruction from the Lord was
a terror to me. Job was a man most eminently pious (as appears by the testimony
of God himself, both in that book and elsewhere, Ezekiel 14 14.) yet one thing
which restrained him from evil, was the terror of destruction from the Lord.
See also 2 Cor 5.11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.

Obj. 3 Perfect love casts out fear, because fear has torment

Answ. 1. There is no Christians love here so perfect as utterly and altogether
to cast out fear, for so long as we are in the flesh we shall not be free from
fear: though at the day of Judgment love being perfected, will cast out all
fear, as says the Apostle there.

2. By fear the e is meant only a tormenting fear, or fear so far forth as it
has torment in it, as is evident by the Apostles explication of himself. Now
though the fear of hell, as that which a man is actually obliged to suffer,
[rebus sic stantibus,] be indeed a Of this fear see Heb. 2.15. There be those
who do understand, that tormenting fear which perfect love is said to cast
out, to be that carnal fear of men, and dangers, by means of which, we do as
Peter did, choose rather to deny Chrst, and sin against God, rather then
express our love by suffering for him. And this Intepr^tation is not
improbable, as will appear by comparing that in 1 John 4.18. with 2 Timothy 1.7.
tormenting thing, yet what torment is there to a Believer, being actually
discharged or disobliged from the curse, nevertheless to fear it in case of
his Apostasy? Was Saint Paul tormented with fear when he said, How shall we
escape if we neglect so great salvation? or when he said, I keep under my
body, and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means when I have preached
to others, I my self should be a cast away or a Reprobate? Or was Saint Peter
tormented with fear, or was it his intent to torture the Saints with fear, by
telling them, That God will without respect of persons judge righteously? and
that the latter end of Apostates will be worse then the beginning? They only
will account this torment, who do judge it a torment to be curbed from their
sins, or restrained from following of their lusts: of which torment, see Rev.
11.10.

3. True love will, till the flesh be cast out, preserve this fear for its
assistant and fellow helper, two being better then one, according to that
Proverb of Solomon. Eccl. 4.9. Sure I am, that the love of God is never
otherwise then in conjunction with true love to our selves: and as sure I am,
that if any one should under pretense of perfecting his love to God, endeavor
to cast off all fear of his judgments in case of Apostasy, he should therein
cast off the true love of himself, as taking therein a ready way to prove the
destroyer of himself, neglecting one way or means which God has appointed him
for the preserving of himself. I think it well said by him, whosoever he be
that said it, The flesh would soon make Love a wanton and entice her unto
Folly, did not Fear help to dissolve the enchantments, and protect her
Chastity. A Christian that would be safe indeed, must put on the whole Armor
of God (not some pieces only) among which I doubt not to say, Jer. 32.40. Heb.
12.28, 29
is the fear of damnation, as well as the hope of Salvation.

Object. 4. The love of God, and not the fear or curse of God, does constrain a
Believer to do his duty. 2 Cor. 5.14. The love of God constrains us.

Answ. Here again I answer, as before; viz. That we are not to oppose things
compatible and consistent, such as are the love of God, and the fear of divine
wrath, in opposing whereof the Antinomians do usually err, as those who do
endeavor to set discord betwixt brethren.

Know then, That as a Believer is constrained by the love of God, so moreover
by the wrath of God is he constrained; i.e. strongly, powerfully, and
effectually induced to do his duty; and for proof hereof we need go no further
save to look back upon what the Apostle says in the verse next save two
precedent, Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men. It being
the very scope of the Apostle both in that verse and in the foregoing verse to
declare with what Arguments, among others, he was moved, or impelled unto
faithfulness in discharge of his Ministry and Apostleship (which the false
Apostles in the Church of Corinth did traduce;) viz. the consideration of the
reward of life and death, heaven and hell, at the great day of Judgment.

2. By the same reason that the Antinomians say, that threatenings are
need-nots, and useless to believers, [ Because (say they) the love of Christ
constrains them to duty;] Why may they not infer, That Precepts, Promises,
Exhortations, their own vows and Covenants, are need nots and useless also?
So dangerous a thing it seems to me for any one to profess to live above any
piece or part of Gods Word: for as unfaithfulness in a lsttle is the direct way
unto faithfulness in much; so the casting off of one Ordinance, or one part of
the Scripture, is the ready way to cast off all Scripture and all Ordinances.

3 The very truth is this; The only wise God (who knows our frame, both our
natural and our spiritual frame; i.e. how that we consist of bodies and soul,
of flesh and spirit) did see it needful in his manifold wisdom to use manifold
and multiforme means and Arguments (for which the Saints, who know the
strength of their corruptions from within, and the variety of strong
temptations from without, cannot but be thankful,) whereby to keep believers in
the state of grace and in acourse of life becoming the Gospel, that so they may
not miss the end of their faith; viz. the salvation of their souls.

And here I shall think it not inexpedient, but behooful rather, to enumerate
and specify several of those means; e.g.

1 Exhortations and commands to stand fast, to continue and persevere. 1 Cor.
16.13. Watch ye, stand fast in the faith. 1 Cor. 15.58. Be ye steadfast,
unmovable. Acts 13.43. and 14.22. 2 Thessalonians. 2.13, 14, 15.

2. Admonitions of several sorts.

1 Admonitions with respect to the end; viz. Apostasy, 2 Pet. 3.17. Ye
therefore Beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware, lest ye also
being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness.
1 Cor. 10.12. Let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. 2
Admonitions with respect to the means leading to Apostasy, or to the avoiding
of all such things as will endanger their perseverance; e.g.
1 The avoiding all occasions of sin, and more especially the company of the
wicked, and of all Seducers; for which read the following Scriptures, with the
like; Prove. 23.31. and 1.15 and 4.14. Deuteronomy. 7.3, 4, 25. Rev. 18.4. Romans 16.17.
1 Timothy 6.3, 4, 5. 1 John 4. beg. and 1.2, 26. Yea, God has told us before
hand, that unless we are careful to shun the means of Apostasy, we shall not
persevere but backslide, Deuteronomy. 7.3, 4. Neither shall thou make marriages with
them: thy daughter thou shall not give unto his son, nor his daughter shall
thou take unto thy son; for they will turn away thy son from following me. To
this purpose is that proverbial saying among the Jews considerable, A little
leven leveneth the whole lump, 1 Cor. 5.6 Gal. 5.9.

2. As the direct way to Apostasy, the Saints are admonished of pride, Romans
11.20. Be not high minded, but fear.

3 A third means which God uses toward the perseverance of the Saints is the
promise of reward unto all those who are faithful to the end* See for this
purpose, Revel. 2.10. 1 Cor. 15.58. Romans 2.7, 8. where, to those who are
faithful to death, who are steadfast unmovable, abounding in well-doing, who by
patient continuance in well doing, seek for glory, honor and immortality,
there is promised a crown of life, and that life eternal.

4 Threatenings of hell and damnation, in case they fall off, Prove. 14.14. The
backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways, 2 Pet. 2.20, 21. If
after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of
our Lord and Savior Christ Jesus, they are again entangled therein, and
overcome; the latter end is worse with them then the beginning: For it had been
better for them not to have known the way of Righteousness, then. --

5 God commands them to oblige themselves by Oaths, Vows, and frequent
renewing of their Covenant with him. Psalm. 76.11. Vow unto the Lord, and pay:
The making and keeping of our Vows, is confessedly a moral duty, and
perpetually obliging by virtue of the third Commandment. To this purpose God
requires us frequently to receive the Lords Supper, as that Ordinance, whereby
the Covenant betwixt God and us is sealed.

6. In order to preserve the Saints from Apostasy God does propound and set
before them Examples, and that of both sorts, as well such as they are to fly,
as such as they are to follow.

1. Examples for their imitation, as of Christ himself; and other of the
Saints that have gone before us, and held out to the end both in doing and
suffering of Gods will, which we are expressly called on to imitate. Heb. 6.12.
Be ye followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the Promises.
Heb. 12.1, 2. Being compassed about with such a cloud of witnesses, let us lay
aside every weight, and the sin that does so easily beset us, and let us run
with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the Author
and Finisher of our faith, who for, etc. Hebr. 13.7. Remember them who have the
rule over you, who have spoken unto you the Word of God, whose faith follow,
considering the end of their conversations. 2. Examples for their admonition,
among which we have the examples both of particular persons, as also of whole
Towns, Cities, and Nations. Thus does Saint Paul admonish Timothy of Apostasy
by the example of Hymeneus and Alexander, 1 Timothy 1.18, 19. Holding faith and a
good conscience, which some having put away concerning faith, have made
shipwreck, of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander. Thus likewise does he warn every
one that professes Christ, by the example of the Apostasy of Hymeneus and
Philetus, saying, Let him that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity,
2 Timothy 2.18, 19. Thus are the Corinthians admonished, by the Apostasy and
infidelity of the Israelites in the wilderness, whose example, (as he tells
them) were written for their admonition, 1 Cor. 10.11, 12. By the like example
he does also admonish the believing Hebrews, chapter 4. beg. And by the fall of
the whole nation of the Jews, Saint Paul does admonish the believing Romans,
concluding the relation with this admonition, Well, because of unbelief they
were broken off, and thou stand by Faith: Be not high minded, but fear, Rom
11.20. Yea, the example of the Apostate Angels is set before the faithful as a
warning and admonition, whereby to avoid their sin, and to escape their
punishment, Jude begin.
7 In order to the perseverance of the Saints, God does inflict sometimes very
grievous judgments.

1. Upon the wicked, commanding the Saints to take warning thereby, that they
may hear, and fear, and learn not to sin presumptuously; Deuteronomy. 17.13. 1 Cor.
10.11, 12. This use did Nehemiah persuade the Jews to make of Gods judgments
upon their predecessors, chap. 13.18. Did not our fathers thus, and did not our
God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this City? yet ye bring more wrath
upon Israel by profaneing the Sabbath. The contrary sin is laid to the charge
of Judah, who would not take warning by the sore hand of God upon her Sister
Israel, Jer. 3.8. And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel
committed Adultery, I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet
her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also. 2
Upon themselves. This means, viz. the rod of correction God does use sometimes,
whereby to keep the Saints from running the same excess of riot with the
wicked; by this means, as it were by thorns hedging up the way of sin (as is
the Prophets phrase, Hos. 2 6) but more especially to reduce them from their
wanderings when they have gone astray, 1 Cor 11.32. I have some where read or
heard of a similitude very apt for this purpose, of one resembling us to Tops,
that by means of whipping are got up when they are down, and being up are kept
going.
8. One maine end of Church Discipline, of Ecclesiastical censure, as of
public Authoritative admonition and excommunication, is, that Believers may
stand in aw, and persevere in holiness, 1 Timothy 5.20. Them that sin rebuke
openly, that others also may fear.

The Premises considered, it appears evidently, that Believers are and are to
be constrained, not only by love, but also by fear, and by the rod of God, if
by any means ((...), as is the Apostles word, Phil. 3.11.) they may attain the
Resurrection of the dead, and the salvation of their souls. And surely did not
some men in these times go about to make themselves wiser then God Almighty,
they would rather bless and magnify, yea, admire and adore both the wisdom
and goodness of God (becoming all things to all men, and to every part of man,
both the old man and the new) in that variety of means which he uses for the
preservation of believers in the state of grace: I say, they would rather so do
then cry out upon Gods Ministers as legal Teachers for mixing Threatenings with
Promises, and thereby endeavoring to preserve the Saints as well in the fear of
the wrath of God, and the curse, as in the love of God and his goodness.

Obj. 5. Believers are preserved through their faith unto salvation, 1 Pet. 1.5.

Answ. Though Saint Paul says, That they are preserved through faith unto
salvation, yet he says not through faith only, and to interpret him
exclusively there is no ground: and here I say once again as before; viz: Those
graces and virtues which God has joined together, we must not make opposite
one to another, or sever one from another. Though faith and fear are diverse,
yet are they not adverse and repugnant.

More distinctly then I answer,

1 That as the Saints are preserved to salvation through their faith, so
likewise through their fear, Jerem. 32.40. I will put my Fear into their
hearts, that they shall never depart from me. 2. He that rightly understands
himself in saying, That Believers are preserved through faith, will understand
how that he does by necessary consequence in so saying, imply, That they are
preserved through their fear: for what is the object of faith? is not the whole
Word of God? Though I should grant, That in some peculiar sense the Promise is
the object of Faith, (in which respect Saint Paul calls the Promise, the Word
of faith, Romans 10.8.) yet who can deny, that the whole Word of God is Fides
objectiva, or the object of Faith? and consequently, who can deny that
Believers are to exercise faith, as well in the threatenings as in the promises
of the Word? and the scope of God in his threatenings being to beget faith and
fear, as well as in his Promises to beget faith and hope in his people; who can
deny, That Believers are kept to Salvation, as well through faith and fear of
the Threatenings of God in his holy Word, as through faith and hope in his
promises. 3. Consider, that as the wicked have been reclaimed to their duty by
faith and fear of Gods threatenings (for which see the example of the Ninevites,
of whom it is said, That they believed God, and proclaimed a Fast, Jonah 3.5.
So the godly have been by the like means contained, or retained in their duty,
as was made appear by several instances before recited, unto which I shall add
the example of Noah, of whom it is said, That he by faith, moved with fear,
prepared an Ark for the preserving of himself and his household, Heb. 11.7.
Observe thence as to the purpose in hand, these two things: 1. The conjunction,
2. The cooperation of faith and fear.

1. Observe, That faith in God as touching his Promises, and the fear of God as
touching his threanings, may very well stand together.

2. As Saint James said concerning faith and works, ( Chap. 2.22. See thou
how faith wrought with his works,) so I may here say, concerning faith and
fear, See thou how faith and fear did cooperate to Noah's obedience and
preservation?

4. Be it considered, that as every Threatening does imply a Promise, so every
Promise does imply a Threatening, as is manifest by that remarkable Scripture
Heb. 4. beg. where the Apostle in the forgoing Chapter having spoken of an
express threatening [of not entering into Gods Rest.] he admonishes them by
way of Inference, saying, Let us therefore fear, lest a Promise being left us
of entering into his Rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. And as
the consequence hereof, be it considered in the next place

5 That it is the duty of Gods Church and people to exercise not only faith and
hope, 2 Cor. 7.1. compared with 2 Cor. 6.17, 18.
but moreover to exercise faith and fear even in, or by occasion of the
Promises of God, considering that as every Threatening does imply a Promise, so
every Promise does imply a Threatening; so that the word, which is formally a
Promise, is also implyedly, and vertually a Threatening, and Vice versa, the
Word which is formally a Threatening, is implyedly or vertually a Promise. The
ground hereof is this, because Gods Promises and Gods threatenings have always
conditions, if not expressed, at least employed. This Noah did very well
understand, and therefore God having made him a Promise to preserve him from
the Deluge by means of an Ark, which he commanded him for that end to prepare,
Noah is therefore said by faith, as moved through fear, to have prepared it.

The main cause which hinders the Antinomians from the sight and acknowledgment
of the consistency and cooperation of faith and fear is (as I conceive)
because they do imagine justifying faith to be nothing else but a persuasion or
a firm belief that Christ will unquestionably save them, and they are therefore
apt to interpret all Scriptures, wherein any thing is ascribed unto faith, or
said to be done through faith, or by means of says, unto faith in their said
sense, which is a very gross error in it self, and a cause of much more.

Object. 6. Believers know that they cannot fall away from grace, because God
has promised as will their perseverance in grace, as their crowning with
glory? Joh. 13 1. Luke 22 32.

Answ. God who promises the end, does not promise it to be attained
absolutely, or Quocunque modo; but with express, or at least with an implicit
reference to the use of the means; e. g God who promised to add fifteen years
to the life of Hezekiah, did promise the same with reference unto Hezekiahs
making use of all the due means of conserving life, whether by food, physic,
or other ways, 2 King. 20.6, 7.

2 As God who promises salvation (the ultimate end) to the Elect, does promise
to give them perseverance in the faith to that end; even so God, who has
promised perseverance (the subordinate and subservient end) unto the Saints,
has promised to give them grace to be diligent in the use of all such means
which he has appointed as helping and conducing to their perseverance: e. g.
God who has decreed and promised that Believers shall never totally and finally
depart from him, has withal decreed and promised, that he will put as well his
fear as his faith unto them, Note.
together with all other graces needful for that purpose, Jer. 32.40.

3. Among other means which God in his Word has appointed for the perseverance
of Believers, this is one (as has been already plentifully proved;) viz. The
setting before them the curse of the Law, even hell it self as the desert and
certain reward of Apostasy and all Apostates, which said danger, whosoever
shall be fearless and regardlesse of, as such a person does take a ready course
to ruin himself by incurring the danger, so by his said fearlessenesse and
regardlesness he does give just occasion for himself and for all others to
doubt or question, whether he be for present in the number of Gods Elect, to
whom the said Promises of perseverance are made and of whom therefore they
shall be verified.

4. Notwithstanding God does promise to preserve Believers in the state of
Grace, he does nevertheless set before them the danger of Apostasy, whereby
to cause them to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling. For
proof whereof I shall quote several very remarkable Scriptures. See Phil. 1.6
with chapter 2.12, 13. notwithstanding the Apostle had expressed his confidence
both concerning their present, and also their future and final estate, that the
same God, who had begun a good work, would finish it until the day of Christ;
he does nevertheless exhort them, to work out their own salvation with fear
and trembling. See Rev. 3.10. where albeit God does promise to the Church of
Philiadelphia, that he will infallibly preserve her in the hour of temptation,
he does notwithstanding admonish her of the danger of Apostasy, and exhort her
to perseverance, lest her crown be taken from her. See the Epistle of St Jude,
where he does expressy tell us to what manner of persons he writes; viz. To
them that are sanctified and preserved in Christ Jesus, ver. 1. yet the said
preservation notwithstanding, he tells them, that it was needful both for him
and them to use the means of their preservation; ver. 3. [ Beloved (says he)
when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was
needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you,] and observe what means he
uses for that end; e. g. He exhorts them earnestly to contend for the faith;
he sets before them in sundry examples, especially that of the Reprobate
Angels, the danger of Apostasy, that so in them, as in a Looking-glass, they
may behold the fearful end of all Apostates; and notwithstanding their
preservation in, or by Christ, (as some render the word,) yet does he exhort
them, to preserve themselves, ver. 20, 21. namely, as by a careful heeding, and
diligent using of all the means, which in that Epistle of his he had prescribed
to them, so in especial, by constant prayer to God, and edifying one another,
The word rendered. Preserved, in ver. 1. is (...), which as Critics do observe,
does properly signify to be most solicitously kept as under lock and key, as
by watch and Ward, as prisoners use to be kept (see the same word used Acts
4.3. and 5.18. and 24.23. and 25.4.) and yet he uses the self same word in his
exhortations unto them, ver. 21. (...), keep your selves as with Watch and
Ward; it being the same word which Saint John also uses, 1 John 5 18. where he
tells us, that every one who is born of God does in such sort preserve himself.
See also 1 Cor. 1.8. with 1 Cor. 16.13. and 1.6, 9, 10, 11. notwithstanding the
Apostle had told them in the former place, That the Lord Jesus would confirm
them to the end, that they might be blameless in the day of our Lord. He does
(I say) notwithstanding exhort them to stand fast, and threaten them with the
loss of their inheritance in heaven in their pursuits of any unrighteous way.
See also 2 John 2.8. In the second Verse Saint John tells the Elect Lady and
her children, that the Truth which did dwell in them, should abide with them
for ever, and yet does he admonish them, saying, v. 8. Look to your selves,
that we lose not the things which we have wrought

5 If because God has promised to Believers, that they shall persevere in his
grace and love, they therefore are to live above all fear of the curse, and the
threatenings of the Word, why are they not by a like reason to live above all
Scriptures, and all Ordinances, above all exhortations to persevere, and above
all such admonitions against Apostasy which S. Peter himself does give unto
such who were truly sanctified, and had received a like precious faith with
himself, saying, (2 Pet. 3.17, 18.) Ye therefore, Beloved, seeing ye know these
things (and what those things were, among others, see 2 Pet. 2. beg. and latt.
viz. the fearful end and doom of all Apostates) beware lest ye also being led
away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness: But grow
in Grace. -- There be many things which Saint Peter writes to the Saints in
that Epistle, for which the Antinomians would charge us (should we say the same
things to the Saints) as legal Preachers; but I doubt not, but that Saint Peter
himself having been a backslider, having received that Item from Christ, [Thou
being converted strengthen thy brethren,] was mindful of that very counsel of
Christ given to him, by writing in such sort as he does in his Epistles, in
order to the strengthening and perseverance of his brethren the believing
Jews, and to their effectual preservation from Apostasy by what temptations
soever.

The great Error of the Antinomians in things of this nature is, That they
separate the means from the end; Christ from duty, and duty from Christ, the
Spirit from the Word, and the Word from the Spirit.

Obj. 7. One end of the Redemption of Believers from the curse of the Law, and
from all enemies, is, that they should serve God without fear, as is plainly
and (...) asserted. Luke 1.74.

In untying the knot of this Objection, I shall decline two Answers,

1 I will not dispute or argue, whether the Greek Adverb, [(...)] being the
first word in the verse, ought to be referred to the word [Serve,] or to the
word, [Delivered.] Theophylact joining it with the Particle [(...), Deliverd,]
and interpreting it (...); i.e. Sine ullo nostro periculo; Christus enim (says
he) quiescentibus nobis crucifixus est. I will speak nothing to argue the
probability of the said reference, and interpretation (Christ having delivered
or redeemed us without any fear or danger on our parts sustained) but I shall
take the words according as they stand in our own Translation, and as they are
commonly interpreted by our modern Divines. 2. I will decline the usual
distinction of fear into filial and servile. Yet this I will do, 1. Not because
I do disaprove the said distinction; 2. Nor because I think it not applicable
or useful in the present case, and for my present purpose; but because I am
well assured, that the difference betwixt these two sorts of fears, is much
mistaken by very many: for, whereas it is commonly thought and taught, that
filial and servile fear do differ in their material object, or have different
objects; the object of filial fear being God in the notion of a loving Father,
or God and his goodness and no otherwise: and the object of servile fear being
(as they say) God as a Judge, or God and his vengeance.

I must crave leave in this place, to give in my opinion to the contrary, and
to assert, That these two fears do differ, not in the object matter, or thing
feared, but in the manner of fearing; for the material object even of godly and
filial fear, is God [a consuming fire,] or the eternal vengeance of God, as
well as of servile fear; as is to me past all doubt or contradiction most
evident by those two Scriptures before cited, Heb. 12.28, 29. and Luke 12.4, 5.
A godly man, or a child of God, as well as a wicked man, or an enemy of God, is
to fear hell and damnation, as was before plainly and plentifully proved; and
therefore hell and damnation must needs be the object, as well of filial as of
servile fear. One main difference betwixt these two fears, I do therefore
conceive to be in the manner how those dreadful objects are feared, they being
in a different manner feared by a son and by a slave, by a godly, and by a
wicked man.

The Answer then which I will give to that place of Scripture, shall be by
distinguishing concerning a twofold fear, I mean twofold in respect of the
manner of fearing, as follows. A man may fear hell and damnation two ways:

1. As that which he is actually for present obliged to suffer, or as that
which he knows will betide him [rebus sic stantibus,] in his present state and
condition, or in those ways wherein hitherunto he has walked, and still does
walk in. 2 A man may fear hell and damnation, as that from the suffering
whereof, albeit for the present he be discharged, as being in the state of
grace, which nevertheless he may and shall suffer, if he abide not in his
present state of Grace, or continue not in that way of holiness wherein he is
going. The former kind of fear I may not unfitly style a positive fear, and the
latter suppositive; the one being absolutely exercised, or exerted, the other
conditionally. The former indeed is that kind of fear which we commonly call
servile, and it is the fruit or effect of the spirit of bondage spoken of by
Saint Paul, as that which the sons of God are delivered from, Romans 8.15. and
Heb. 2 14, 15. None but the slaves of Satan and the Devils bondmen are in such
sort to fear hell and damnation. The meaning then of that in Luke 1.79. is,
That Christ has delivered us from this positive fear of evil, or the fearing
of evil in this positive manner, it being the scope of Zachary in that his
Song, to intimate, that Christ is indeed an Horn of salvation, ver. 69. i. e. a
strong and mighty Savior, (horn being frequently put for strength and
effectual defense, Psalm. 18.2.) and consequently, that the redeemed ones of
Christ, whom he has redeemed from the service of sin to the service of
himself, need not in his service, or so long as they do continue in ways of
his service, to fear any enemy whatsoever. What Beza notes upon the place is
note-worthy, Batach, or Betach, signifying, Spem and securitatem and cum Lamed
adverbiascit, significans tuto, secure, confidenter. Psalm. 4.9. Gen, 34.25. See
S^bindler.
(...) (says he) is the same with the Hebrew, [Tabetach] used Lev 25.18. and
26 5 which is there rendered, in safety; or with the Greek (...), used Ephesians.
3.12 and there rendered, With confidence; so that to serve God without fear, is
no more then with faith, boldness, or confidence to build upon the Power,
Promise, Goodness, Truth, Faithfulness, and the like Attributes of God for
safety and defense from all enemies whatsoever, so long as we keep to, or
continue in the ways of his service, God having said, Who is he that will harm
you, if ye be followers of that which is good? 1 Pet. 3.13. This I say, is that
fear, our deliverance from which is the scope, or one part of our redemption by
Jesus Christ; but Christ did not intend to deliver his Saints in this life from
the latter kind of fear, they being so long as they live on earth to fear hell
and damnation upon supposition of their not continuing in his service, as was
before said and proved. As Saint Paul says to the believing Romans, with
respect to the power, wrath, and vengeance of Gods Vicegerent, [the
Magistrate,] so may I say, unto the best among the Saints on earth with respect
to the power, wrath, and vengeance of God himself, Will thou not be afraid? do
that which is good, [for in so doing thou have cause to serve God, (...),
boldly and without fear;] but, If thou do evil, be afraid, Romans 13.3, 4.
Briefly, Albeit Believers serving God, or in their service of God, they are to
serve him without fear, yet they are to fear, if they do not serve him, or not
persist in his service.

Object 8. Ye have not received the Spirit of bondage to fear again; but ye
have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father, Romans 8.15.

Answ. I have already said, that the fear of hell as that which a man is
actually obliged to suffer, upon the consideration of his present estate and
condition, is the effect of the spirit of bondage, and that indeed which
subjects a man unto bondage. But as for that fear of hell, which is only upon
supposition of a Saints Apostasy;

1. It is in no sort contrary unto, but it is altogether consistent with the
spirit of Adoption. For 1. The adopted children of God are commanded in such
sort to fear hell, as was before proved. 2. This kind of fear poth not in any
sort hinder the Saints from crying, Abba, Father. The whole family of the
Saints on earth, notwithstanding this their fear, can call God their Father no
less then the family of the Saints in heaven.


2 This is more especially to be observed for the satisfaction and right
information of those who because they are exercised with doubts and fears, and
do want assurance of their salvation, are apt to conclude from thence (but
unwarrantably) that they have not the Spirit of Adoption.
2. This fear is not only consistent with the Spirit of Adoption. but it is
moreover from the Spirit of Adoption; for the Spirit of God (which is in them
the Spirit of Adoption) does dictate to them, and does dictate in them this
very fear. And when I say, that this fear is not only with the Spirit, but also
from the Spirit of Adoption; I would have it the rather to be observed for this
reason; viz. Because there may be, and sometimes actually there is a fear
[with] the Spirit of Adoption, that is not [from] the said Spirit of Adoption.
E.G. Gods Adopted ones for want of Assurance, and through a mis-apprehension of
their state and condition to God ward, may possibly, and oft-times do actually
fear hell and damnation even with that kind of fear which we commonly style
legal or slavish; i.e. they fear hell as that which they think they are
actually obliged to suffer, but this fear in them is not from the Spirit of
Adoption, by virtue of which they should cast off, or cast away that fear, it
being for the slaves of Satan, and not for the sons and daughters of the living
God to fear hell in such sort.

Having been so large in proving and clearing this Confectary, I shall be
briefer in the next.

I shall conclude this Confectary with the saying of Bernard, as I have seen
him quoted, who writing to one, whom he thought not to be sufficiently
solicitous about the Judgments of God, in steed of wishing him (according to
the usual form of salutation) Salutem plurimam, much health; said, Timorem
plurimum, much fear; So shall I wish to all the Saints and servants of God, not
only much joy, but also (as in the sense before explicated,) much fear.

And if any one shall object against me, That I do not (as becomes a Gospel
Minister) endeavor to help forward the joy of the Saints, I have these two
things to answer, 1. I do conceive, That the great work of a Minister, and the
grand bent of his preaching, and that which he should chiefly and directly have
an eye upon in all his preaching, ought to be the future and eternal safety of
people, rather then their present ravishments and comforts in the way. 2.
Whatsoever I have written in this, or in any other part of this Exercitation,
does most directly tend unto, and make for the safety of the Saints; and if for
their safety, then consequently and necessarily for their comfort, both in this
world and in the world to come. Yea, I am persuaded that no Doctrine is indeed,
and in a Scripture sense comfortable Doctrine, but that which does of its own
nature minister to the safety of the Saints, and to their preservation in the
state of grace. And if I be not herein mistaken, I would to God that people
would make use of that saying, whereby to judge what manner of Preachers are the
most comfortable Preachers, and what Doctrines are the most comfortable
Doctrines.


CHAP. XXVII. That a Minister of the Gospel has no warrant so to absolve a
Believer, as in the name of God to tell him, That his sins are as absolutely
pardoned, and that he is as absolutely sure of heaven, as if he were already in
heaven.
CONSECT. XX.
20. IT follows. That a Minister has no warrant to tell a Believer, how that
he may assure himself for his comfort, that his sins are as absolutely
pardoned, and that he shall as absolutely be saved, as if he were already in
the bosom of Abraham, and actually translated with Enoch and Elias, The
obligation of a sinner, as to eternal condemnation being taken off, not
absolutely but conditionally, for what is to come, or as to the actual
enjoyment of what mercy is to come: for what dismission soever God does
vouchsafe to a sinner in this life, we must suppose the sinner to be dismissed
of God no otherwise then with such an Item, or admonition which Christ gives
to the restored Cripple, Sin no more, lest (the same thing, or) a worse thing
come unto thee, John 5.14.

My meaning in this Confectary is plainly this, (as I have before expressed it,
and which I desire to be remembered) viz. That though the obligation of a sinner
to eternal condemnation be actually taken off so soon as he is converted,
nevertheless the continuance of that mercy is not absolute, but conditional,
God not having intended, and Christ not having intended, and Christ not having
purchased full and final pardon for any sinner, (I mean) that any sinner should
enjoy the full and final pardon of his sins, otherwise then upon the condition
of his perseverance, (as was before said.) This Confectary is of necessity. (I
suppose) unavoidable.

In Isai. 30.1. The Prophet denounces a woe to those, [Who take counsel but
not of him, and that cover with a covering, but not of his Spirit.] I may truly
say of the Antinomian Preachers, that they do minister consolation but not of
God, and they do comfort their Disciples with comforts, but not of Gods Spirit
the Comforter. Such is this comfort whereby they do seek to comfort their
heare^s in telling them, That their sins are as absolutely forgiven as if they
were in heaven. I do less wonder, that the Antinomian Preachers are accounted
by the ignorant and profane multitude the only comfortable Preachers: for well
I wot their error here is twofold: 1. They comfort those to whom comfort does
not belong; our commission being limited (in the application of comfort) only
to the broken hearted, which they not observing, do speak peace to the wicked
often times. 2 That they tender to Believers their own dreams, and the fulsom,
luscious conceptions of their own fancies, in steed of the savoury, wholesome
consolations of Scripture. But as Elijah said to the Messengers of Ahaziah, 2
Kin. 1.3. Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire
of Baal-zebub the God of Ekron? So may I say unto this sort of Comforters, Is
it not because ye think that the comforts of Scripture are not sufficient, that
ye frame and feign comforts of your own devising? Or is it not because your
mouths and the mouths of your Disciples being out of taste, the comforts of
Scripture do not relish but are so unsavory, that they will not down with you?
For my own part, I know no more warrant for a Minister to create Comforts, then
he has to create Commands, it being as much against the sufficiency and
perfection of Scripture to attempt the one as the other; and as our blessed
Savior did therefore admonish his Disciples to beware of the leaven of the
Scribes and Pharisees, [they teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of men;]
so have I reason to admonish Christians to take heed of the leaven (in special
of this leaven) of Antinomian Preachers, (they preaching for Gospel,
consolations of their own framing.)


This admonition is the rather needful,

1. Because, albeit it be very toothsom, yet it is not therefore the more
wholesome. There be sweet poisons, as well as bitter.

2 By how much it is more sweet by so much it is like with the more eagerness
to be swallowed. The mouths of people do water after such delicacies and their
ears do itch to hear such Gospel, they loving to hear rather what is smooth,
then what is right, what will please rather then what will profit, what is
sweet rather then what is sound; according the humor of the people of old, as
is recorded by the Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah, Isal. 30.9.10. This is a
rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the Law of the
Lord; which say to the Seers, See not, and to the Prophets, Prophecy not unto
us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophecy deceits. So we preach
comforts to people, though they be deceitful comforts, they regard not; though
we cozen people, yet so we comfort them, they care not. Jer. 5. lat. The
Prophets prophecy falsely, and the Priests bear rule by their means, and my
people love to have it so; and what will ye do in the end thereof? This
Question, [ What will ye do in the end thereof?] is in this case not to be
omitted; for consider in the next place the danger of comforting Believers by
telling them, That their sins are as absolutely pardoned as if they were in
heaven. The danger hereof will appear, by what I shall next offer unto
consideration, as a reason of the foresaid Admonition.

3 Consider the tendency of this comfort. For my own part, as I look upon the
whole body of Antinomianisme as a Doctrine of security so I look upon this
particular branch as that which tends directly to make a Christian to neglect
his watch, to lay down his weapons, and to cast off his Armor. It is such
Music as tends to lull a Christian asleep in the Devils lap, and it is Gods
great mercy if he awake out of that his dream of being in heaven, before he
sees himself absolutely to be in Hell.

I would have said more to this particular, but that Mr. Baxter in his Book
styled, [Directions for getting and keeping Spiritual Peace and Comfort] has
spoken directly and amply thereunto in his eighteenth and twentieth Direction,
which I shall here transcribe;

Know, that God has not commanded you to believe that you do believe; nor that
you are justified, or shall be saved (but only conditionally) and therefore
your Assurance is not a certainty properly of Divine faith. Page 189. Direction
18.

Never expect so much Assurance on earth as shall set you above all If there be
no possible danger, what need of such admonitions caveats, and cautions, as in
Ephesians. 6.11. 2 John 8. 2 Pet. 3.17. Caveats need not, but where danger is in some
respects at least possible.
possibility of the loss of heaven, and above all apprehensions of real
danger. Page 211. Direction 20.

I shall conclude this Consectary with that Item which Ahab gave to Benhadad,
when swelling in his confidence, 1 King. 20.11. Let not him that girdeth on his
harness, boast himself, as he that puts it off. Let not any Saint militant
here on earth, that girdeth on his harness for the spiritual warfare, boast
himself as if he were as absolutely sure of heaven as the Saints now
triumphant, who have put it off.

CHAP. XXVIII. That the repentance, which the Gospel requires, is not only
repentance [from] the pardon of our sins, as the Antinomians affirm, but [for]
the pardon of them, proved and evinced by several Arguments. Several Objections
of the Antinomians answered; wherein it is punctually declared, In what sense
Evangelical Repentance may be said to be [from] pardon of sin, and in what
sense [for] the pardon of it. It is disputable whether Gods glory and our own
salvation are to be looked at as two ends, or only as one, the former being a
necessary result of the latter. An Objection answered, That it is a singular
favor of God, and a favor in some sense peculiar to the times of the New
Testament, that God has so clearly revealed unto us our eternal salvation, as
the great end, not excluding, but including his glory) of man's working, or of
all Christian duty. That good works may be styled the way to salvation. That
the difference betwixt the Covenant of Work and of Grace lies not in this, that
Adam was to work for life, and we not for, but only from life. Our own good
works, duties graces or holiness, how far forth, or in what sense to be
disclaimed, and not trusted unto for salvation, as also in what sense, or how
far forth they may be trusted unto, or rested in for salvation, declared more
at large. A Caution annexed to prevent mistake. That there are two kinds of
presumption, both which are distinctly to be made known unto people by the
Ministers of the Gospel, and carefully to be avoided by all, as dangerous rocks
in the steering of our course toward the haven of eternal happiness.
CONSECT. XXII
22. IT follows, That the repentance which the Gospel requires is not only
repentance [from] the pardon of our sins, but [for] the pardon of them. Pardon
of sin being the taking away from the sinner obligation to punishment, and
punishment it self, and these being not taken away till a sinner has repented
of his sins (as is evident by the Scriptures, otherwise an impenitent person
had as much right to heaven, and were as much in the state of salvation as the
penitent;) it does unavoidably from thence follow, That that repenpentance
which the Gospel requires as saving repentance, or repentance necessary to
salvation, (I mean, our first repentance, or repentance at our first
conversion) is for, and not from the pardon of our sins.

I am willing to take occasion to speak somewhat more at large for the
confirmation and clearing of this inference, and for the confutation of the
contrary, because it is one branch of the Antinomian Doctrine in these times,
That all repentance which is not from the pardon of sin; i. e. the sense and
belief of pardon, is but Legal and not Evangelical repentance; and that to
teach people to repent for the pardon of their sins, is to dishonor and to
dethrone Christ, to make a Christ of our repentance. Now for the confutation of
this new Anti-Gospel Doctrine, and for a Christians confirmation in the good
and old Doctrine of Christ, the Prophets and Apostles, I will endeavor to
demonstrate, touching the said Doctrine of the Antinomians, these two things,
1. That it is directly and abundantly against the truth of the Gospel. 2.
Against the comfort of the Gospel.


For the demonstration of the former, let the following particulars be
considered.

1. We do very seldom, I think, never at all read in the Word of God, that any
of Gods Prophets, Christ Jesus or his Apostles, did press any person or people
to repent from the pardon of their sins. Its true indeed, that sinners are
frequently exhorted to repent, from the consideration of Gods mercy and
goodness, in his readiness to pardon them; i.e. to pardon them in such ways,
or upon such terms, as in and upon which God is purposed to dispense pardon;
i.e. to pardon them if they do repent, Joel 2.12, 13, 14. but where shall we
read in all the Book of God, that sinners are urged and exhorted to repent from
the belief, sense, or consideration of Gods grace and goodness in this, That
he has already pardoned those sins, for which they are called upon to repent?

2 Suppose that some instance could be produced out of Scripture of some sinner
or sinners, that have been informed from God, and told before hand, that their
sins were pardoned, and were thereupon exhorted to repent: I would answer, That
such an instance or instances will not prove, that it is a Christians duty to
repent from and not for the pardon of his sins: for it is the manner of of the
Holy Ghost in Scripture sometimes to pronounce or make promise of the end, and
then to direct and exhort unto the use of means for the accomplishing of that
end, and without the use whereof it shall not be accomplished; e. g. God does
first tell Hezekiah, that he shall recover of his disease, and that he would add
to his life fifteen years, and thereupon God directs him what means to use for
his recovery; viz. A bunch of figs applied to his byle. Because God had told
Hezekiah before hand that he would add fifteen years to his life, shall we
therefore conclude, That Hezekiah did apply the bunch of figs, and did ever
after that time eat and drink from life, and not for life?

3. To say, That a sinner must repent from the pardon of his sins, and not for
the pardon of them, if he will repent Evangelically, is to make a sinners
pardon to go before his repentance; whereas the Scripture informs us, that
pardon of sin does follow repentance, and not go before it, as reward follows
the Service, or as the bestowing of a promised reward does follow the
performance of the condition of the Promise, Acts 2 38. Repent and be baptized
for the remission of your sins. Acts 5.31. Him has God exalted to be a Prince
and a Savior, to give Repentance to Israel and remission of sin. Isai. 55 7,
8. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let
him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and unto our God,
for he will, (not he has) abundantly pardon. 2 Chronicles. 7.13, 14. If my people
that are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray, and seek my face,
and turn from their evil ways, then will I hear from heaven my dwelling
place, and will forgive their sins. Where do we read, that Christ his Prophets
and Apostles did ever preach to any sinner or sinners that their sins were
actually pardoned, till they had actually repented? Yea, what warrant has a
Minister of the Gospel so much as to propound or promise unto any person or
people the Pardon of their sins, but upon precedent repentance for sin? See
Luke 4.18. and 24.47. Well I wot, That the Ministers of the Gospel are to
publish to all the world, That the Messiah is come in the flesh, has satisfied
Gods Justice, made an atonement or propitiation for the sins of the whole
world; i. e. that Christ Jesus has done whatsoever did belong for him to do on
earth (as a Surety) to the satisfying of Gods Justice, the pardon and
reconciliation of sinners: But I wot withal, That albeit the satisfaction of
Gods Justice and the purchase of pardon does wholely and solely depend upon the
doings and sufferings of Christ's as the meritorious cause thereof; so our
enjoyment of a part or benefit in the said purchase and satisfaction does
depend upon the doing or performing of all such Gospel Duties which Christ has
appointed or commanded, as the condition without which we are to have no saving
comfort and benefit by him; the performance of which said duties, is
nevertheless through the help of Gods free grace purchased by Christ, and a
fruit of his Redemption.

4 As we have no precept in Gods Word, bidding us to repent from the pardon of
sin, so we have frequent precepts commanding us to repent for pardon, or that
we may be pardoned, or lest we should miss of pardon. See Acts 2.38. Repent,
(...), into the remission of your sins. Acts 3.19. Repent (...), into the
bloting out of your sins. Amos 5.14. Seek good and not evil, that ye may live.
So that to preach, that That repentance which is for, and not purely from the
pardon of our sins, is not evangelical repentance, is directly and clearly to
pervert the Gospel of Christ in its Doctrine of repentance.

5. It is far more agreeable unto Scripture and to right reason to say, That we
are to rejoice from the pardon of our sins, then to say We are to repent from
the pardon of them.

1. That it is more agreeable to Scripture to say the former then the latter,
may appear (besides by what has been already said) by that in Match 9.2. Son,
be of good cheer, t^y sins are forgiven thee. And by that in Isai. 40. beg.
Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, says your God, speak ye comfortably to
Jerusalem, and cry unto her, That he iniquity is pardoned.

2 It is more agreeable to reason: for the pardon of sin is the object of Joy,
not of sorrow. As sin it self is the proper object matter, or material object
of sorrow, so the pardon of it is the material object of joy; thence that of
the Angel to the Shepherds, Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,
which shall be to all people: for unto you is born this day a Savior, Luke
2.10, 11.

3. Yea thirdly, agreeable hereunto is the experience of the Saints: for as
some do weep for sorrow, that their sins may be pardoned; so others do weep for
joy that to their own sense they are pardoned; neither ought this to seem
strange, there Such it seems were the tears of her in Luke 7.38. Christ saying
of her, not she grieved much, (though that doubt-lesse was true) but she loved
much.
being tears of love and rejoicing, as well as of mourning.

These things considered, let any one judge whether those who tell people, That
to repent evangelically is to repent from, not for the pardon of sin, do not
tell them in effect, That to weep for sin in a Gospel way, is to weep for joy,
but not for grief? and consequently whether they do not overturn Gospel
Repentance, sursum vorsum, topsie-turvy (as we use to say?) For whereas the
Gospel of Christ tells us, that evangelical repentance is (...), to sorrow
after a godly manner, or a sorrow after God, 2 Cor. 7.9, 10. Consider and judge
whether these new Gospel Preachers do not rather make it a joy after God, or a
rejoicing after a godly manner, or godly joy, rather then godly sorrow

5 Were Evangelical repentance only from, and not for the pardon of sin, then
should our Savior Christ in rendering the reason of the blessedness of such
mourners; Mat. 5.4.
have said, not as he did, For they shall Be comforted, but For they Are
comforted; there being no greater comfort then the sense or assurance of pardon.

6. Let it (for a further confutation of the said Doctrine) be considered, what
are those grounds Ends, Reasons, or Motives, for, or upon which sinners are
invited, or exhorted in Scripture to repent. E.g.

1 Because we have offended and dishonored God by transgressing his command.
Psalm. 51.4. Against thee, thee only have I finned, says David.

2. Because as by our sins we have dishonored God, so by our repentance we do
glorify God, or give glory to him: especially if our repentance be made
public as our sin. Josh. 7.19. Jerem. 13.16. Give glory to the Lord your God,
before he cause darkness, etc.

3 Because God is very gracious and merciful, ready to pardon all those who do
repent, Joel 2.12, 13, 14. Isai. 57.7, 8. 2 Chro. 30.9. Ezekiel. 18. lat.

4. Because as God promises pardon to the penitent, so he threatens utter
and inevitable ruin to the impenitent, Luke 13. 3, 5. Rev. 2.5.

5. Because Christ is a Savior given of God, All sufficient, and most able to
save to the uttermost all sinners whatsoever, yea, and is exalted of God to
give repentance and remission of sin to the most heinous sinners, Acts 5.31.

6. Because of that injury and irreparable mischief which we have done, and
shall do against our selves and our own souls by continuing in our sins, Hos.
14. beg. and 13.9. Ezekiel. 18. last.

These and the like Arguments, or Grounds of Repentance, we do frequently read
of in the Word of God; which I do alledg, not to prove, that the sense of the
free mercy of God in pardoning a Believers former sins should not induce him
the more to repent of his present sins (for in that sense I do acknowledge, that
a Believer is to repent, and does repent from the pardon of sin; yet so from
the pardon of former sins, or sins long since pardoned, as still for the pardon
of his other sins:) but the aforesaid Reasons are alleged by me to prove, That
a sinner is to repent for the pardon of his sins, and that repentance for
pardon is true, genuine, Scripture-Gospel-Repentance; i. e. such as Christ, his
Prophets and Apostles do enjoyne both for substance and circumstance, as a
saving grace.

2 As the said Doctrine is against the Truth, so is it also against the Comfort
of the Gospel; and let it be considered what a most uncomfortable Doctrine it
is to tell sinners, that Gospel-Repentance is from and not for pardon; for,
will it not follow from thence, That no sinner did ever truly, savingly, and
Evangelically repent, but such only who have the sense or assurance of pardon
in their own souls? then which Doctrine we cannot lightly preach any more
dismal, dark, and discomfortable. Is the preaching of this Doctrine the way to
comfort those who mourn in Sion, and the preaching of glad tidings to the
meek? Is this to pour oil and wine, or is it not rather to pour gall and
vinegar into wounded consciences? And is it not strange then, that those who do
preach such anti-Gospel Doctrine, so opposite both to the Truth and comfort of
the Gospel, should pretend to such zeal for Christ and his Gospel, and to such
art in comforting a Christian? May not we truly say concerning these men's zeal
of the Gospel, as Saint Paul said of his Country men their zeal of the Law;
viz. That it is not according to knowledge?

The main ground of the Antinomians Error in saying, That Gospel repentance is
from, and not for pardon, is (as I conceive) because they hold, That sin is
actually pardoned before it be repented of; and observing therefore how one
error (like the links of a chain) does draw on another, we should be the more
watchful against every error, and pray to the Father of lights to give us
understanding in all things.

I shall in the next place endeavor to answer the usual Objections which are
made by the Antinomians against their adversaries, who hold, That a Believer is
to work not for pardon, for life, for redemption, and for salvation, but from
them. Mr. Baxter has indeed in several of his writings said so much already
about this Point, as that I shall not much need to say any thing more. For my
own part, I am singularly glad that Mr. Baxter has admonished Christians to
beware of the Book styled, The Marrow of Modern Divinity, that does harp so
much upon that string, not for, but from. The said Book was about six or seven
years ago commended unto me by a very honest and well meaning Christian, which
having sought after, and thoroughly read, I could not but wonder (and not
without some little but just, indignation) that three such most excellent and
famous Divines, as Mr. C. Mr B. and Mr. S. should by their several Epistles
commend such an Interimystical and Cassandrian piece as that Book may in its
kind (I think) deservedly be called; and I did thereupon make some
Animadversions upon it long since, and in special concerning this particular
Point [ From and not For;] For well I wot, that albeit we are to endeavor, as
much as may be, the peace of Gods Churches (and I doubt not but goodness and
sweetness of nature and zeal for peace did so far prevail with those three
forementioned Worthies as to procure such Testimonials from them) nevertheless
we are not to assert gross Errors (however we may, and its fit we should
sometimes, conceal some Truths) for peace sake.

I shall here therefore insert what I have long since written, and upon
occasion also preached about this Point, as follows.

There is much ignorance and error in opposing these two, [ From and For
salvation] as things incompatible and inconsistent; whereas, like brethren they
may very well dwell together in unity. Know then, That Believers may and ought
to do good duties, both from and for salvation; e.g.

1. From Salvation as purposed and appointed by God for them.

2. From salvation as purchased and procured by Christ in their behalf.

3. From salvation as promised to them in the Word, and in the ways of well
doing. Thence is it frequent with the Holy Ghost in Scripture, to urge
Believers unto constancy in obedience, with Arguments taken from the
consideration of the said Purpose, Purchase, and Promises; for which see Heb.
12 28.2 Cor. 7.1. and 1.6, 20. 1 These. 5 8, 9.

2. As a Believer is to work from salvation purposed, procured promised (I add
also, As a wicked man is to repent from salvation by God in Christ, appointed
for him, and promised to him upon terms of believing, repenting, converting,
and upon those terms made over to him in the Gospel grant) so are we all, one
with another to work, to begin, and to hold on in the ways of Righteousness
for salvation, actually and fully in Gods due time to be enjoyed.

And that every man may and ought in this sort or sense work for his salvation,
may be proved by the following Arguments.

1. We are expressly commanded, To work out our salvation, Phil. 2.12. So to run
that we may obtain, 1 Cor. 9.24. To do that which is right and good in the
sight of the Lord, that it may be well with us, Deuteronomy. 6.18. To wash our hearts
from wickedness, that we may be saved, Jer. 4 14. 2. God promises to give
eternal life to those, and those only who by patient continuance in well-doing
seek for it, Romans 2.7. So that unless we work for our salvation, we can never
be saved, as having no promise of salvation made of God unto us; so truly has
Mr. Baxter said, That should the Asserters of the said Doctrine, so commended
in the Marrow of Modern Divinity, put in practice their own Doctrine, they
could not be saved. 3. What reason had Saint Paul to assert, that a Christians
patient suffering of the Cross does work glory for him, if a Christian may not
therein, and in all his ways of well doing, work for it? 2 Cor. 4.17, 18. 4.
Consider the examples of the Saints, who did the will of God for the obtaining
of this end. We run, strive, are temperate in all things, (says Saint Paul, 1
Cor. 9.25.) to obtain an incorruptible Crown. Heb. 11.35. Not accepting
deliverance, that they might obtain a better Resurrection. Phil. 3.14. I press
toward the mark, (says Saint Paul, (...),) for the price of the high Calling
of God in Christ Jesus; and what himself did in this, he calls upon all, the
most perfect not excepted, to imitate, saying, ver. 15. Let as many as be
perfect be thus minded; and v. 17. Brethren be followers together of me. 5.
Salvation is one great end, as of our believing, 1 Pet. 1.9. so also of our
working; i. e. of all the acts of new obedience, Romans 6. 22. Being made free
from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and
the end everlasting life. Thence is salvation styled, the Fruit of our doings,
Isai. 3.10. and the reward or recompense of our labors, 2 John 8. Luke 14.14.
Yea, as glory is styled, Grace 1. Pet. 1.13. so is salvation, (the reward of
our works) styled by the name of Works, Rev. 14.13. Their works shall follow
them; i. e. Merces operum, the reward of their works shall follow them.
How absurd and irrational then is it for any one to say, That a Christian is
not to repent for pardon, or to work for salvation? it is as if a man should
say, We must not use means for the end.

Yea, why may I not say, That salvation (I mean our own, and the salvation of
others) is the maine and utmost end of a Christians working, for as much as the
glory of God does therein consist to the height or uttermost? and therefore it
seems vain for any one to except, saying, Gods glory is the utmost end: for the
utmost of Gods glory [quoad hoc,] is in our salvation. Yea, so inseparable is
Gods glory from our glory, as that God is not glorified to the uttermost by our
glorifying him on earth, but by his glorifying us in heaven. 2 Thessalonians. 1.10.
When he shall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them
that believe. When our blessed Savior did pray to his Father, saying, Father,
glorify thy Son, that thy Son also [may] glorify thee; making his Fathers
glory the end of his own; what is the meaning of Christ in that prayer, but
that God would strengthen and enable him to go through his approaching
sufferings for the efectual accomplishing of that great end for which they were
designed? viz. the bringing of many sons unto glory, according to the
expression of the Apostle, Heb. 2.11. and according to the supplication of our
Savior, saying, viz, Father, I will that those whom thou have given me be with
me where I am, that they may behold my glory: and according to his assertion,
ver. 19. For their sakes I sanctify my self. I add, it seems to me to be a
thing impossible, for any one (truly, and in a Scripture sense) to aim at his
own salvation, and not to aim at Gods glory. I say, truly and in a Scripture
sense, for in a true moral or Scripture sense, he only can be said to aim,
(yea, to desire) his own salvation, that takes the way, or does the things
which lead and tend to his salvation. Now since salvation is that wherein Gods
glory does most eminently consist, how is it possible to aim at the one, and
not the other? We are indeed commanded to make Gods glory the end of all our
actions, 1 Cor. 10.31. but if any one shall say, Besides, Albeit Gods glory and
our salvation be not one thing, yet may they perhaps be one end: Res quoad
entitates suas diversae possunt esse in ratione causandi una causa, five
possunt exercere finalem causalitatem excitando sui desiderium per modum unius.
See Scheibl. Top. p. 191.
We are commanded to make Gods glory the end of our salvation, I shall reply to
such a one, Profer tabulas, show me any Scripture where that command is
written. For my own part, till a Scripture record be produced for that
purpose, I shall think such a command to be superfluous: for if it be not said,
that Gods glory and our salvation are one and the self same thing,
nevertheless it must (I think) be said, That Gods glory does issue and flow
from our Salvation (will we, nill we) per modum resultantiae, by result
unavoidable.

The end of my dilating thus upon this particular, is not peremptorily to
conclude, That Gods glory and our salvation are to be looked at as one end
(for whether they ought to be looked at as one end, or as two ends in
subordination, this to that, it is not to my purpose, neither shall I contend
with any one who shall affirm either way) but to show the exceeding weakness
and unreasonablenesse of the Antinomians, who under the pretense of exalting
God and Christ in their glory, do forbid us to make our own salvation the end
of our working. I have heard of some professors of Religion, who are accounted
knowing and gifted Christians, at least who are such in their own account, who
though they will acknowledge, that a Christian may eye his own salvation, or
have an eye to it or upon it, yet will stiffly deny, that he may aim at it, or
labor for it. But I would that such wise ones would seriously peruse that place
of Saint Paul, 2 Cor. 4.18. [While we look not at the things which are seen,
but at the things which are not seen.] and that withal they would peruse the
Original, or at least suffer themselves to be informed touching the word in the
Original, which is translated, While we look at, the Greek word being [(...)]
which does signify, to look on a thing with such an eye, as an Archer does
upon the white at which he aims and shoots; so that the Apostle doubted not to
say, that he did make the things not seen, viz. the eternal weight of glory,
spoken of in the verse foregoing, (this being such indeed as eye has not seen,
nor ear heard, 1 Cor. 2.9. 1 John 3.2.) I say, The Apostle did not doubt to
aver, that he with other faithful Christians did make these things his scope
and aim. And they who say, that we may eye Heaven, but not aim at it, or
labor for it, do speak as wisely, as if they had said, An Archer may eye the
white, or have an eye upon it, but he is not to aim at it, or labor to hit it.

Obj. Christ Jesus has purchased salvation and remission for us, and why then
should we repent and work for them?

Answ. 1. This Objection has in effect been answered already; viz. Whatsoever
Christ has purchased we are not to enjoy, but in Christ's way and upon his
terms, which is and are, that we give all diligence in the path of piety, to
obtain the same, Heb. 5.9. Christ is not the Author of Salvation unto any but
such as do obey him.

2. There is no outward blessing and comfort (be it meat, drink, and clothing)
but is purchased for the Elect by Christ, as well as is their salvation. If
Christ's purchase therefore is a sufficient Argument, why we should not work for
salvation, and repent for pardon, by a like reason we are neither to work, yea,
nor so much as to pray for daily bread. The truth is, the Antinomians have as
good reason to forbid us to pray for daily bread, for health and strength, for
food and raiment, and to command us to pray from daily bread, from health and
strength, from food and raiment, as they have to forbid us to repent and work
for the remission of our sins, and for the salvation of our souls, and to
command us to work from them.

3 By the same reason, that the Antinomians forbid a Christian to repent for
pardon, and to work for salvation, they may forbid him likewise to pray for
remission, and to pray for salvation; for is not prayer a work, yea, a prime
part of a Christians constant work so long as he is on earth? And if there be
any color of accusing those as Merit-mongers who assert, That we must work
for salvation; there is a like color for the same accusation against those,
who shall assert, That we must pray for salvation, which I doubt not is the
duty of all those who shall come to salvation.

Some Antinomians say, We are not to propound any end at all in doing duty,
meaning not base and carnal ends, but the highest and noblest ends; which
Doctrine, though intended by them to make us perfect Saints, or to raise us to
the highest pitch of Saints, does lay us almost level with Beasts, as denuding
us of reason: for take away the end, which every reasonable creature, as
reasonable, propounds in his actions, and we do eatenus, or therein level him
with a beast; for bruit beasts do act or move ad finem, though not in finem, as
is the Philosophical expression; i. e. they move and work to some end, albeit
not under the notion or specification of an end, Ad finem eventum, licet non ad
finem intentum.

The Premises considered, I hope it will appear past all doubt, that a
Christian may, and ought to work for his salvation. Yea, I think it to be a
special favor for which we who live in times of the New Testament are to be
very thankful to the Lord, that he has therein so clearly revealed our own
salvation to be that high and great end (not excluding, but therein including
the glory of his great Name, as therein most eminently consisting, as was before
said) for which we ought to act and work. And that the mercy and favor of God
therein toward us may the better appear, let it be considered at what an
uncertainty, not only the Heathen, but many of the Disciple of Moses were, and
in what bywayes they have erred for want of more full and clear revelation in
that Point, which through the great mercy of God we Christians do now enjoy.

The Heathen knowing thus much by the light of Nature, that some end was to be
proposed unto man in all virtuous actions, they did therefore much beat their
brains, and busy themselves to find out what that end must be; in the
determination whereof it fell out with them, as in most of their other great
inquests, some thought one thing, and some another, scarce any among them being
constant to themselves, or so fixing in ought, as not to fluctuate Some of them
did conceive, that the maine end of their acting should be the hope of another
life after this. This indeed was asserted by many of their Poets and
Philosophers; yet not without some hesitancy even in the chiefest, viz. with a
Fortasse, and a Non nimium affirmaverim. I have seen Tully, Epist. 64. Et
fortasse quem putamus perisse praemissus est.
Seneca, and Socrates quoted as hesitating herein, Plato himself bringing in
his Master Socrates; saying thus before his death, Hoc scio, spem mihi esse
venturum me ad viros bonos, quod tamen non nimium affirmaverim. And when the
heathen sought Arguments for the confirmation of their hopes herein they found
little to fix them in a certitude and assurance of such a life to come; much of
what they alleged holding no better for men then for beasts. Whence it was
that some of them devised a transmigration of souls, from men into beasts, and
from beasts into men. And this opinion of theirs being built upon no certain
evidences, others were inclined to assert, That virtue is reward to it self,
and that we must labor to be virtuous, and to do virtuously, only for Virtues
sake; a wise man being sufficiently happy (as they said) when he is tormented
in the Bull of Phalaris. But others were much unsatisfied in this Opinion, as
irrational and absurd, they taking it for granted, That where dangers, torments
and death are, there felicity, especially in the highest, cannot consist,
unless men should content themselves with a sound of empty words without any
reality. Some of them did therefore place their supreme good and utmost end in
the enjoyment of sensual pleasures after this life, which diverse of their Poets
meant by their fancy of the Elisian fields; and this is the opinion of the
Mahometans at this day. But this opinion was rejected by many of the wisest and
most virtuous among the Heathens, they thinking that this opinion did degrade
men into the rank of bruit Creatures, and concluding, rather that man was born
and fitted of the Gods for higher things. Thuswe may perceive at what an
uncertainty the Heathen were in this point.

Now for the Writings of Moses, there were some among the Jews, professors of
the Moisaick Law, viz. the Sadduces, who held, That there was no such thing as
eternal life, or everlasting salvation promised, or held forth by Moses in his
Writings (which alone the Sadduces do receive for Scripture) nor in any of the
Writings of the Old Testament, as the Socinians at this day do assert, though I
think, that if there were no other Scripture to confute them in this, that one
place in Joh. 5.39. were sufficient, where Christ bids the Jews, search the
Scriptures, saying, For in them ye think to have life eternal. However I say,
the Sadduces did not expect any such thing as eternal life in the Writings of
Moses, (being therein veiled under Types and Shadows rather then clearly
revealed) renouncing therefore all hope of good things to come as the end of
doing good, they did [ cum gentibus, (...),] jump with some of the Heathen in
their foresaid Opinion; viz. That Virtue it self is the end of Virtue, and that
we must do virtuously for no other end then for Virtues sake. To this purpose I
am assured, that I have somewhere read in the Writings of Josephus, concerning
the Sect of the Sadduces, though I cannot presently direct to the particular
place.

These things being considered, should (me thinks) move us Christians unto
thankfulness, that God has not left us in the dark about this matter, as he
did the Jews, especially the Heathen, but has given us as with open face to
behold our eternal salvation, as the great end of faith and a good life; so
that we may say thereupon with the blessed Apostle, 1 Cor. 9.26. We therefore
run, not as uncertainly (as did the Sadduces, and as did the Heathen;) So fight
we, not as one that beats the air; but we run, to obtain a Crown
incorruptible. And the consideration hereof should also cause us to stop our
ears against the insinuation of those amongst us who have suggested to us, That
to love Jesus Christ for the benefits ( e. g. freedom from hell, and eternal
life,) which we expect by, from, and through him, is but a whorish love, like
that of a dishonest woman, who loves her harlot for the Rings, Bracelets and
Jewels that he bestows upon her; which is in effect to suggest, That to love
Jesus Christ as our Savior and Redeemer is not conjugal, but adulterous love.
How far such suggestions are from Scripture warrant, whither they tend, and
where they are like to end, I leave to the consideration of the wise.

Object. Are good works the way of, or to salvation?

Answ. Whatsoever the Marrow of Modern Divinity says to the contrary,
Scripture will warrant us to say, That albeit good works are not the way to
salvation, in such a sense as Christ is the way, yet they are the way thither,
they being styled the way of peace, and the path of life, Isai. 5.9, 8. Prove.
3.17. and 5.6. and we being commanded to walk in them, Ephesians. 2.10 A man cannot
walk, but where there is a way either of his making or finding. And if good
works be not the way to salvation, then are they the way to damnation, seeing
all ways do lead either to God or the Devil, to heaven or hel^ Because Christ
Jesus is in some sense our only Savior, did Saint Paul therefore blaspheme or
wrong Christ by saying to Timothy, that in looking to himself and his Doctrine,
he should both save himself and those that heard him? And why then because
Christ is in some sense the only way to salvation, should we be accused as
blaspheming or wronging Christ in saying, (yet with the Scriptures) That good
Works or good Duties are the way to salvation.

Obj. Is not this the difference betwixt the Covenant of Works and of Grace,
that Adam under the former was to work for life, and Believers under the latter
are to work from life.

Answ. As the Covenant of Works and of Grace do differ in many things, so they
do accord in some, and particularly in this thing, viz. That as Adam was to act
for life, so are we also, as has been already proved.

Quest. Where then is the difference betwixt the Covenant of Works and of Grace?

Ans. The differences betwixt them is a point (as I think) of very great
concernment, well worthy much to be studied, and frequantly to be preached by
us Ministers; nevertheless I shall not go about at this time to enumerate all
the differences betwixt them, but shall content my self to name only this one,
as being sufficient for my present purpose; viz The conditions which God
requires of man in both these Covenants are very different; the condition of
the Covenant of Works being perfection of obedience, or the perfect fulfilling
of the whole Law; but the condition of the Covenant of Grace, is Faith in
Christ, Repentance and Sincerity of Obedience. Now as Adam was to do or perform
the former condition, or the condition of the former Covenant for life, so are
we to perform the latter condition, or the condition of the latter Covenant for
life also. Should we go about to set up the perfect fulfilling of the whole
Law, as the condition of salvation, and in such sort work for salvation, this
indeed were legal working, and to work as Legalists: or should we expect
salvation as merited wages for our work, this were to work legally; but to
labor by his strength to perform the conditions of the Covenant of Grace (to
believe, repent, to return unto, and to keep with God in the duties of New
Obedience) that so we may live, and to expect from Gods free grace and mercy,
that in so doing we shall live, this is to work as a Christian, and as becomes
the Gospel of Christ.

Object. But is it not the ready way to make people trust unto, or to rest in
their own good works or duties to tell them, that they may do them for
salvation?

Answ. 1. I shall in the next place answer this Question with two or three
other Questions.

1 Is it not the ready way to make people to cast off the doing of all good
duties and good works, to tell them, that they may not, ought not, need not to
do them for salvation? 2 Is not the danger as common and great this way as
that? Or, is it not as dangerous to think to go to heaven without the doing of
good, as by resting on the good we do? Is it not as ordinary for people to
perish for barrenness, as for bringing forth fruit to themselves? 3 Whether is
it not fitter for a Minister to instruct people, how far forth they may, and
how far forth they may not trust in, and rest upon their own Duties, Graces,
works, or holiness for salvation, then to tell them, that they ought not to do
any good duty for salvation? As this latter is a thing unlawful, so the former
is a thing, I am well assured, not only lawful, but also expedient and
necessary: in order therefore thereunto, be it known.
1. In general, That we are not to trust unto, or rest upon our own good Works,
Duties or Graces for salvation in any such sort as Christ alone and his
Righteousness is to be trusted unto, or rested upon.

2. More particularly be it known;

1. That we may not trust unto, or rest in them as our legal Righteousness, i.
e. such as for which the Law of Works will pronounce us righteous, or as any
part of our legal Righteousness in conjunction with Christ's. 2. Consequently
hereupon we may not rest in them as things that are absolutely perfect and
exactly commensurate or answerable to the rigor of the Law. 3. Not as things
by which Gods Justice is satisfied, his wrath pacified, or by which we make him
an amends for breach of the first Covenant. 4. Consequently hereupon, not as
things whereby in any strict or proper sense we do merit salvation we having
indeed no works formally ours, which do make the reward to be of debt, and not
of Grace. In these respects we are to disclaim all our own Works Duties,
Graces, Holiness, and to trust unto, or rest upon Christ and his Righteousness
wholely and solely.
2 But in the second place be it known, 1 In general, That because Christ
alone is to be rested upon for salvation in the foresaid respects, we have no
more reason to conclude from thence, that we may, can, or ought in no sense to
rest in our own good works or duties for salvation, then we can conclude, that
because Christ alone does save us, therefore it may not, can not, ought not to
be said in any sense, that we do save our selves; which notwithstanding is the
frequent language of Scripture. 2 More particularly be it known, 1. That we may
rest in, or trust unto our own good Works, Duties and Holiness for salvation,
in subordination to the free grace and mercy of God in Christ Jesus accepting
them, and pardoning the sinfulness of them. 2 We may rest on them, as things
which do assure us of our title unto, or actual interest in the satisfaction
and Righteousness of Jesus Christ, there being a personal or evangelical
righteousness necessary to salvation, as well as a legal righteousness; i. e.
it being not sufficient for our actual enjoyment of salvation, that Christ was
righteous, or did fulfill all righteousness of the Law, unless we in our own
persons do labor to be righteous as he was righteous, 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. Know ye
not, that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom ^f God? be not
deceived, neither Fornicators, nor --
3 We may rest in them as the ways wherein, or (which is to the same purpose
as was said in the particular foregoing) as the conditions without which Christ
Jesus will not save us: for without holiness no man shall see the Lord, Heb.
12 14. neither is Christ the Author of salvation (actually enjoyed,) unto any
other then such as do obey him, Heb. 5.9. 1 Timothy 4.16. Neither is the resting
upon our own holiness in these senses any whit against the glory of Christ,
this being in effect and in deed neither more nor less but this, viz. To rest
upon Christ, and Christ alone for salvation in Christ's own way; i e. the way of
holiness and righteousness. I do not mean, perfect holiness and
righteousness according to the Covenant of Works, but such as is expected and
required from us as necessary to salvation, according to the tenor of the
Covenant of Grace. I doubt not but the most self denying servants of Christ did
in this sort rest upon their own holiness for salvation, in special Hezekiah
praying to the Lord, That he would remember how he had walked before him with a
perfect heart, 2 King. 20. beg. and Nehemiah praying to the like purpose with
subordination to the mercy of God pardoning his defects, chap. 13.22. and David
praying and saying, Lord save me, for I am holy, Psalm 86.2. and Saint Paul
saying, I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
faith, hence forward is laid up for me a Crawn of Righteousness, 2 Timothy 4.7 8.
To rest upon our own holiness for salvation in the sense immediately
aforesaid, is no more then for a man who does use the creatures moderately, (as
meat, drink, sleep, recreation,) in or upon the use of them, to depend on God
(the only Author and Preserver of life) for health and strength. May not we
depend on bread as bread, and upon the Physician as the Physician, for health
and strength; i. e. as the means appointed of God for the restoring and
continuing of health and strength, so as with a dependence subordinate to God?
Or, do we make an Idol of Gods Creatures, as of bread and the Physician, by
making them such as God has made them; viz. Means under him to accomplish
their end, and in such sort making use of them, and depending upon them? What
color of reason then is there to say, That by depending upon our own works and
holiness for salvation in such a sense as aforesaid, we do idolize and make a
Christ of them?


Caution. Only let not the former similitudes be wrested beyond their scope and
my intent, which is not to assert or evince that our good works are physical
causes of eternal life as meat, and drink are of our natural life: but only to
intimate, that they are means of their kind, in the use whereof, or that they
are ways of Gods ordaining, wherein we walking, God will save us, and not
otherwise, or in other ways. I say, no otherwise, for we have no more warrant
to trust unto Christ as our Mediator and Advocate for the life of our souls,
without the use of all spiritual means of his appointment in order thereunto,
then we have to trust unto God as Creator and Preserver for the life of our
bodies, without using the means appointed for that end. Be it therefore known
and well considered, That there is no trusting to Christ for salvation, but in
Christ's own way, which is not the way of profaneness, ( Ephesians. 5.3, 4.5, 6.
Gal. 5.19, 20.) but the way of holiness; i.e. of a godly, righteous and sober
life, Tit. 2.11, 12, 13. To rest upon Christ for salvation, otherwise then in
Christ's own way, is to presume, not to believe: it is, I say, to presume, and
that in such sort, as if a man should resolve never to eat and drink, or as if
a man should resolve to take poison, a knife or halter, to st^b or strangle
himself, and yet should trust unto God, and rest upon the power, providence and
mercy of God for the preserving and prolonging of his life.

There is a double kind of presumption, which as rocks upon which we shall
undoubtedly split our selves, we are carefully to avoid in the steering of our
course toward the haven of eternal happiness.

1. Presuming upon, trusting unto, and resting in our own good works, duties,
graces and holiness without Christ. This was that rock upon which the
Pharisaical Jews did dash themselves and perish, Romans 10.3 [They being
ignorant of Gods righteousness, and going about to establish their own
righteousness have not submitted themselves to the Righteousness of God.]
Such kind of zeal for good works is not according to the knowledge of the
Gospel.

2. Presuming upon, trusting unto, and resting on Christ and his Righteousness
for salvation without any personal righteousness and holiness in our selves,
which latter is the common and most damning presumption of the ignorant and
profane multitude, who though they allow themselves in known wickednesses, yet
will rest upon Christ for salvation, as is evident to be seen in sad
experience; this being no new thing, but a common thing of old for wicked men
in their wickedness to lean and to stay themselves upon the Lord, as appears
by Isai. 48.2. They did call themselves of the holy City, and stay themselves
upon the God of Israel, albeit they did persist in their obstinacy, their neck
being as an iron sinew, and their brow as brass. ver. 4. See also Micah 3.11
The Heads thereof judge for reward, and the Priests thereof teach for hire, and
the Prophets thereof divine for money, yet will they lean upon the Lord, and
say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil shall come unto us. And that it shall
be thus with very many in the Church to the worlds end, does seem to be a thing
as it were foretold by our Savior, saying, Matthew. 7.22, 23. Many will say to
me in that day, Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and in thy name
cast out devils? Have not we eat and drunk in thy presence? And then I will
profess unto you, I never knew you, depart from me all ye that work iniquity.
The sin of those Professors was not (as some suppose, alleging that Scripture
as a warning whereby to drive people from resting in their duties) that they
did make a Christ of their duties, and did rest upon them for salvation; but
their sin, (as is evident by the answer which Christ gives to them) was this,
viz. That they trusted to Christ, and expected that Christ should save them
(they making an external profession of his name,) in their profane course of
life: for could those formal Professors have said to Christ as Saint Paul did,
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith;
or could they say with that faithful servant, Lord, thy pound has gained ten
pounds; or with Hezekiah, I have walked before thee with a perfect heart.
Christ would not have said to them, Depart from me, ye Scribes and Pharisees,
ye Merit-mongers, that expect salvation from your own righteousness, and not
from mine; but he would have said to them, Euge, hone serve, Well done good and
faithful servants, enter ye into the joy of your Lord. But as David did trust
God for his bodily safety, in such sort should we trust in God for our souls
safety and salvation, Psalm 44.6. I will not trust to my bow, neither shall my
own sword save me, says he. And yet for all that David did not trust in God
that God would save him without his bow, or without his sword; for if so, he
would never have blessed God for teaching his hands to war and his fingers to
fight, and for girding him with strength, in so much a^ that a bow of steel was
broken by his arms. Even so let a Christian say, I will not trust to my own
Duties, Works, Graces, Holiness, neither shall my own inherent righteousness
save me, and yet I will not trust to be saved without them.

If what I have so largely spoken in this place be thought by any to be
insufficient, whereby to prevent or wipe off from me the said imputation of
making good works to be physical causes of salvation, I shall wish such a one to
consider, That as the Prophet Isaiah does style a Saints eternal reward, the
fruit of his doings, and his enjoyment of that reward, his eating the fruit of
those his doings, chap. 3.10. So the blessed Apostle Saint Paul (that great
Preacher of free grace, and Exalter of Christ's righteousness) does resemble
good works to seed sown, and salvation to the crop or harvest. Gal 6.8. He that
sows to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting; by sowing to
the Spirit, meaning, as he interprets himself, ver. 9. well doing, or doing
that which is good; this seed, and that crop being in the phrase of the Prophet
Hosea, Righteousness and Mercy, chap. 10.12. Sow to your selves in
righteousness (which Solomon styles, Sowing righteousness, Prove. 11.18.) reap
in mercy. So that if I shall be thought blameworthy for the foresaid comparisons
as if I made good works to be physical causes of salvation, the foresaid
Prophets and Apostles will be alike liable to the same censures, the thought of
which ought to be far from us. I have been the larger in this Consectary,
because I judge it to be of weight and consequence more then ordinary.

CHAP. XXIX. The Conclusion.
THE next Work which I design to my self as a second part of this Tractate
concerning the Nature of Forgiveness of Sin, is to find out and set down those
several phrases both in the Old and New Testament which I take to be (...),
synonimous, commensurate, or equivalent with forgiveness of sin, and to deduce
from thence sundry Consectaries according to the method observed in this part.

But because I am willing to make trial what acceptance this first part of my
labor will find, before I publish a second; and because it may perhaps be long
ere my leisure from my weekly pains in preaching will permit me fully to
accomplish what I intend as a supplement hereof; I will therefore suffix unto
this first Part that which otherwise I had reserved for the close of my whole
labor of this kind; viz. The following Consolatory Apology. or Apologetical
consolation, saying:

If in this present undertaking, to discover the true and full nature of
forgiveness of sin, I have in ought [Humanum passus,] For Homo sum, and humani
nihil a me alienum puto.
committed any sin of Error, and needing forgiveness, my comfort is, that (as
my heart tells me, and I hope, that how deceitful soever, yet therein it does
not much deceive me) I am, and by the grace of God I ever shall be ready at any
time upon the discovery thereof, plainly to confess it; and I am well assured
from the Text in hand, That in so doing God is not only very gracious and
merciful, but just and faithful likewise to forgive it. And as for the pardon
of man, especially of my fellow servants and brethren in the Ministryl what
shall I say? Shall I say, that I despise it, and care not much for it? God
forbid, let such a spirit of pride and disdain be far and far from me, and not
from me only, but from all those who profess themselves to be disciples unto
that Lord, who has given both a Precept and a Pattern of Humility unto all his
servants, instructing them hereunto both Voce and Vita, saying, Learn of me,
for I am meek and lowly in heart. I am therefore resolved by the helping grace
of God, not to stick to crave pardon of man as well as of God, according as my
need of it, and necessity of asking it shall be made appear unto me; and in so
doing I do not at all doubt, but that I shall obtain it, according to that
Hemistick, -- Veniam petimusque damusque vicissim. Even so, O thou Preserver of
men, for Christ Jesus his sake; Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them
that trespass against us. Amen, Amen.

Luke 2.14. Glory to God in the Highest, on earth peace, good will toward men.

proved; and the false ones, (commonly assigned) are rejected and refuted. That
the Saints may, and oft-times do in this life suffer for their sins, Christ's
satisfaction notwithstanding, proved and cleared. In what sense God does, and
in what sense he does not remember the sins of Believers, laid down in sundry
Propositions, Affirmative and Negative; wherein likewise is declared what
difference there is betwixt Gods remembering the sins of the godly, and of the
wicked, as also betwixt his remembering the sins if Believers under the Old
Testament, and the sins of Believers under the New Testament. p. 67 Chap. 9
Caution given as touching the interpretation of such metaphorical phrases
whereby forgiveness of sin is expressed, that we construe them warily and in a
sober sense. p. 99 Chap. 10 In what sense, or how far forth, as true and false,
those common sayings of our Divines, [Sublata culpa tollitur poena; and
justificatio tollit omnia poenalia;] may, or are to be construed, and
interpreted, and in what sense to be rejected. p. 102 Chap. 11. That there is
no such thing as Remissio culpae [remission of the fault,] in way of
distinction from Remissio poenae [remission of the punishment;] these two being
one and the self same thing. The four following Chapters do declare, That
forgiveness of sin is a dividual, and not an individual action, as is commonly
supposed. p. 107 Chap. 12. That the distinction of the pardon of sin into total
or partial, perfect or imperfect is a justifiable distinction. p. 113 Chap. 13.
That one and the same sin may be more or less pardoned p. 114 Chap. 14. That
no sinner is fully pardoned in this life, nor yet before the day of Judgment.
p. 115 Chap. 15. The difference betwixt remission of sin and sanctification,
commonly assigned, (that being said to be perfect in this life, this imperfect)
rejected and refuted. p. 117 Chap. 16. That remission of sin does imply
somewhat positive as well as privative, and for that reason that it differs not
from Justification, as has been by some supposed. p. 120 Chap. 17. That one
and the same sin may be said, and that in a Scripture sense, to be pardoned and
not pardoned, to be imputed, and not imputed to a sinner 123 Chap. 18. The
necessity for believers themselves to pray daily for pardon (according to the
tenor of the fifth Petition in the Lords Prayer) asserted and evinced, as well
by Argument as answer to an Objection; it being withal more at large and
distinctly declared, what are the particular things which a Believer (according
to the tenor of that Petition) is to pray for 125 Chap. 19. An answer to the
three following Questions, 1. Does God always pardon a sinner instantly upon
the confession of his sins? 2. In what sense, or how far forth does a sinner
receive a present pardon immediately upon the confession of his sins? 3.
Whether a truly penitent and believing sinner, having once confessed a sin,
is at any time thereafter to confess it in order to forgiveness? The
Affirmative to which last Question is asserted and proved. Certain particulars
added as Cautions for the preventing of mistakes, and for the better
understanding of the Authors true sense and meaning.
p. 137 Chap. 20. That all sins, past, present, and to come, are not at once
actually pardoned. That no sin is from eternity actually pardoned. An Objection
answered. That no sin is actually pardoned, till the sinner be in a capacity of
receiving or enjoying it. What those things are which do put a sinner into a
capacity of actual pardon, declared in their particulars, together with Reasons
for the remarkablenesse of the same. An Objection answered. With a vindicating
of that Assertion in Romans 4.17. [wherein God is said to call the things that
are not, as though they were] from Antinomian purposes. p. 163 Chap. 21.
Caution given as touching a right understanding of the two following
Propositions, laid down by that very learned and pious Divine, Mr. Anthony
Burges, in his Sermons concerning Justification, viz. 1. No wicked man ever
has any sin forgiven him. 2. It is onething for God to forgive, and another
thing for God not to demand and exact punishments.
p. 187 Chap. 22. That forgiveness of sin is a Transient, not Immanent act in
God, proved* and cleared. Several descriptions of actions Immanent and
Transient set down. Mr. Baxter vindicated in a passage about this distinction,
wherein Mr. Kendal has (as the Author thinks) causelessly excepted against him.
Transient Actions are of two sorts, and unto what sort of transient Actions
forgiveness of sin is to be referred. p. 192 Chap. 23. That remission of sin, [
Quoad terminum remotum or as in execution;] is a real, yea, physical change,
and not a change purely relative, as is commonly supposed. p 204 Chap. 24. The
description of forgiveness of sin, given by that very learned and godly Divine
Dr. Twisse, (which is by some highly commended as most accurate) examined and
refuted, and the evil consequences of the same detected, together with the
Authors Apology for his taking upon him in ought to express his dissent from
men of such prime worth (Stars of the first Magnitude) as confessedly that
Doctor was. p. 209 Chap. 25. That a Believer, his pardon notwithstanding, is in
his confession of sin to put himself under the curse of the Law; why, and how
declared. That a sinner after pardon, is a sinner, and that God does look upon
him as a sinner, albeit he does not deal with him or punish him as such. p. 223
Chap. 26. That a Believer during his warfare on earth is to fear hell and
damnation why, and how, proved and manifested, as also cleared in the way of
answer to several Objections, notwithstanding the Doctrine of Perseverance of
the Saints be acknowledged; in answer to which Objections, the consistency and
cooperation of the love of God, and the fear of God is proved. What manner of
fear it is that love does expel, and what manner of fear it is that love does
retain, declared: Notwithstanding, that Believers are restrained by the love of
God, yet that God does use several other means whereby to constrain; i. e.
effectually to induce them, proved: and what those several means are, specified
more at large. The consistency and cooperation of faith and fear, maintained
and proved. That filial and slavish fear do not differ in their object matter,
or in the thing feared, but in the manner of fearing, asserted, and how, proved
and cleared by a due interpretation of that Scripture in Luke 1.74. The
difference betwixt fear as it is the fruit of the spirit of bondage, and as a
fruit of the Spirit of Adoption, opened and asserted. p. 235 Chap. 27 That a
Minister of the Gospel has no warrant so to absolve a Believer, as in the name
of God to tell him, That his sins are as absolutely pardoned, and that he is as
absolutely sure of heaven, as if he were already in heaven. p. 289 Chap. 28.
That the repentance, which the Gospel requires, is not only repentance [from]
the pardon of our sins, as the Antinomians affirm, but [for] the pardon of
them, proved and evinced by several Arguments. Several Objections of the
Antinomians answered; wherein it is punctually declared, In what sense
Evangelical Repentance may be said to be [from] pardon of sin, and in what
sense [for] the pardon of it. It is disputable whether Gods glory and our own
salvation are to be looked at as two ends, or only as one; the former being a
necessary result of the latter. An Objection answered, That it is a singular
favor of God, and a favor in some sense peculiar to the times of the New
Testament, that God has so clearly revealed unto us our eternal salvation, (as
the great end, not excluding, but including his glory) of man's working, or of
all, Christian duty. That good works may be styled the way to salvation. That
the difference betwixt the Covenant of Works and of Grace lies not in this,
that Adam was to work for life, and we not for, but only from life. Our own
good works, duties, graces or holiness, how far forth, or in what sense to be
disclaimed, and not trusted unto for salvation; as also in what sense, or how
far forth they may be trusted unto, or rested in for salvation, declared more
at large. A Caution annexed to prevent mistake. That there are two kinds of
presumption, both which are distinctly to be made known unto people by the
Ministers of the Gospel, and carefully to be avoided by all, as dangerous rocks
in the steering of our course toward the haven of eternal happiness. p. 297
