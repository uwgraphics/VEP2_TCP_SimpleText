A WORD of WISDOM and COUNSEL to the Officers and Soldiers of the ARMY in
ENGLAND, etc.
To weigh and consider before the light and power of their day be shut up in
darkness when they cannot Act for God.
THE people of this Commonwealth has by deep and sad experiences not only
seen the falsenesse and deceivablenesse of many fair words and pretenses,
whereby they have been betrayed of their liberties and freedom, and nothing yet
but bondage and slavery is left upon them, but they also through their deep
sufferings have learned to know the spirits of men. And though every appearance
of a Power that arises gets new words and fair pretenses, but still in the old
spirit; Yet we do perfectly know, that it is the new Spirit of the Lord put in
the inward parts, from which men must act for the Lord and for the Liberties of
his people, before they be established in Righteousness, or enjoy the Liberty
of their Consciences. And we see that God has given time and days, which
should have been days of Liberty and of plentious redemption; But through men's
departing from the leadings of God, and suffering their own wisdom to pervert
them, they became days of persecution and cruelty, which for the Elects sake
(which suffered in them) was shortened; as for instance,

1. Oliver Cromwell in his days made many Vows, Promises, Engagements and
Professions for the Liberty of tender Consciences, as the honest People of this
Nation are not ignorant, and how that at Dunbar, he confessed unto God in his
prayer, That if the Lord would but deliver him that time, he would ^ake away
that great oppression of Tithes; which when he was delivered, both at that and
many other times, and had a prize put into his hand, yet had no heart to
improve it; but contrary to all his prayers, promises and engagements, suffered
and tolerated the wicked spirit of persecution, in the murdering Priests and
Magistrates to Rule in the Land over tender Consciences, even until violence
and blood covered the earth and filled the whole Nation; suffering Laws to be
made for Tithes, and for persecuting of tender Consciences, and so building
again that which he had destroyed, and so made himself a Transgressor; but for
the Elects sake his days were shortened.

2. In the days of R. Cromwell many of that succeeding Parliament began to
declare their sensibleness, how that O. Cromwell had betrayed the Nation and
its Liberty, and left them in great bondage, debt, persecution and slavery; But
how soon they were perverted, and became more bloody and cruel against all that
fear God, (the upright in heart are sensible) setting up in themselves that
which they declared against in him, and in stead of giving liberty and freedom
to the Army and to the people of God, they voted down that liberty and freedom
which they already had (viz.) of meeting together one with another in the fear
and worship of God, and so they became cruel as the Ostridge in the
Wilderness, and as evening Wolves; but for the Elects sake was their days
shortened.

3. The long and late Parl they came up with greater pretenses of liberty and
freedom, then all that was before them; and the people generally applauding of
them, by telling them that they were the beginners of selting the Nation in the
way of Commonwealth; and did expect they should perfect the peoples Liberty
and Freedom outwardly (which by the other Powers they had ^fered under)
expecting that they should remove those burdens which ^as laid upon tender
Consciences by impositions and cruel sufferings, and in their beginning they
seemed to be given up to do the work expected from them, and did publish it in
their weekly news to the Nation several times, that it was their real intent to
make the Nation a Free Commonwealth, not in name but in nature, and this was
often expressed by them, and indeed they did something more then those that
went before them, in setting at Liberty those that were imprisoned because they
could not pay Tithes to the Priests, and because they could not swear, and
because they could not put off their hats to honor pride and ambition, and
because they spoke the Truth against the deceits of the Priests, which both the
Soldiers and the honest hearted in the Nation knows how treacherous they have
been, and the hinderance of every appearance of God in the Nation, for the
chief cause of Gods breaking down, and of bringing into ignominy, shame and
reproach those late powers before mentioned was the leting in of the Priests
spirit and flatteries; as O. Cromwell, if alive would witness, or those that
are alive may witness for him, that he had never been such a covenantbreaker
and betrayer of the Nations Liberties, but by letting in that wicked interest,
which made him a reproach, a byword, a hissing among the people. And the two
late Parliaments, it was their joining to that betraying interest of the
Priests, and neglecting of the Nations business that brought darkness and
confusion, and consequently a dessolution upon them: And the last as I said did
something more then the former; But when they began to revive the committee for
plundered Ministers, and did not take notice, nor call any Commit to subdue or
punish the plundering Ministers, of which they were informed from diverse parts
of the Nation, which had feloniously taken away the goods of many an honest
innocent man; then did Gods Indignation grow hot against them, and then was it
time for them to be dissolved, for they had finished their day, and they had
done all that ever they would have done for the Lord, for bonds and violence
was in their hearts; but for the Elects sake, which has always borne a true
Testimony against the oppression and cruelty under which the Innocent suffers,
was their days shortened.

All those before mentioned had their day from the Lord given them to try und
to prove them, and they have been tried and proved.

And now you the Army have your day from the Lord, wherein you will be tried
and proved, and you will be more in excusable if you do not the things
pretended, then any that has been before you, for you see what has been the
cause of the fall, and you see how that through Pride and Ambition, flatteries
and fair pretenses, the Cause of God, and the Peoples Liberties have been
betrayed by those that have sought honor one of another, and not the honor
which belongs unto God only; Therefore if you would have the Lord to honor
you, and keep you in renown in the Nation, seek not your selves, but deny your
own Lordships honors and Excellencies, let none cleave unto you by flatteries,
in giving you titles in seeming respect, and honors, for that will betray you,
and lead you from that Innocence by which you should act for the Lord; and as
now you have Power, exercise it, in choosing men fearing God, and hating
covetousness, ambition, pride and honor, that so the Nation may enjoy that
Liberty and Freedom which they have long waited for, and suffer none to act
that persecution in your names which has already covered the Nation with
blackness and darkness, and has brought Gods curse upon their proceedings.

One thing is upon me to acquaint you with, which many of you it may be does
not know, which is this; One of the little horns which pushed and persecuted
the Lambs of Christ, is springing up again, and begins to be as fierce as ever;
For yesterday in the Exchequer at Westminster, Judge Parker and Judge Wild
would not receive a true answer from an honest man (who is well known for his
uprightness) against a false Bill prohibited against him by a Priest, unless
he would give it in upon Oath; and therefore because he could not swear for
Conscience sake, but did testify the Truth from his heart, he was committed
Prisoner to the Fleet, and several others True and Just men, and Friends to the
Commonwealth, was denied the Law, and their answers rejected, because they
could not swear; but in whose names and by whose authority they act those
things is not yet declared to the Nation: If those Judges act those things in
the name and by the authority of the Army or their late chosen Counsel, let it
be openly manifest; and if not, but they did it in their own names, let the
Nation know it; For this is worse then the last Parliament, who did set many
free who were so imprisoned, and did give commissions and receive Testimony
without swearing; and Judge Parker seems to have forgotten that knowledge and
fidelity which he had of that people when he went his last circuit in the
North, and his so favoring the Priests now, shows that he has forgotten since
he confessed that he was Sermon-sick at Carlisle this last Summer, when he wished
that a Quaker had been there, and saw that they had reason to declare against
them, etc.

But to us it is no strange thing to see men so apt to change and to betray
their own knowledge for filthy lucre sake, while the corruption of the Laws
through bribery and deceit is upheld, which once the Soldiers had a clear
fight of, and a determination to pull down, and now it is the only day of
their trial to prove themselves, and it is doing of that which you have accused
the Parliaments for not doing that must make you manifest; for people will no
longer believe words; for your selves know, that the good people of the Nation
have made daily complaints and Petitions, and the Officers and Soldiers also,
against that general oppression of Tithes, and the Parliament has only given
them thanks for their good expressions, and good affections, but done nothing,
until their thanks did even become loathsome to the people.

Is it not a grievous thing, and intolerable to be born, that innocent and
faithful men (who see and deny the Priests deceit) should be forced, whether by
Law or Violence, to give them the tenth part of all their labors and increase,
and they with that money to buy horse and arms to raise a Rebellion, to murder
and destroy those men who deny to give them that which your Law has caused to
be taken from them, and so both the Law and Priesthood is joined together in
oppression of the people.

And the Nation is very sensible that all this while they have but been
deceived by promises and fair pretenses, Therefore be diligent to improve the
light of your day, before the Sun set upon you, and you be shut up in
darkness, and the power to do good be taken from you.
