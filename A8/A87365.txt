A SPEECH Made to his Excellency THE Lord General MONCK, AND THE COUNCIL of
STATE, AT DRAPERS-HALL in LONDON: The 28th of March, 1660. At which time they
were entertained by that honorable Company.
MOst honored Sir, if a poor Scholar may
(amongst the rest) his duteous offering pay,
Accept my might unto your Merit, you
That have given life to us, and learning to:
How had the Churches glory lain in th'dust?
A Sacrifice to the Phanatiques lust,
The Virgin had been rifled, and our Laws
Become a Prey unto the Monstrous Jaws
Of Wolves, and Vermin, had not you stepped in
Unto their rescue: nay the City bin
A Shambles made; you have redeemed our States,
As though y'ad sat in council with the Fates,
And by your casting voice diverted our
Intended ruin; thus you showed your power,
And love unto your Country; and so mixed,
It carries settlement our hopes are fixed.
Ambition that did Gangrinate the State,
Like a false Starr's, fallen from its usurpt height:
The spirit of division is now laid,
The Genius of three Nations in one made;
You have re-hing'd our happiness in these
Most reverend Patriots, Branches of our peace;
These Luminaries, that through envious Night,
In the absence of our Sun, affourd us Light;
Whose Pious Care and Courage ever wakes,
More for our safety, then for their own sakes;
That prize a public more then private good,
And swam not to a Government through blood;
So clear in all their ways, that if they might,
They will not take away another right;
That if the Proverb hold, (although but plain)
It Is, like, the Man may have his Mare again:
To you, and them with reverence I Proclaim
A hearty welcome in the Companies name,
The expression of whose Joys transported me
Into these truths wrapped up in Poetry;
Go on brave Senators may ynor Union prove
A Subject to the World of peace and love.
Spoken by Walter Yeokney
The Reader may take notice that the other Speech is a forged cheat, and
disowned by Walter Yeokney.
