the same, 1 Pet. 2. to be especially according to the New Testament, united or

the good, and to do according to it, before God do cause the Sun to go down at

not be able thus to maintain their false worship of God, but perish about the
same, even as in former times it has happened to the house of Siloh and the

King to death, and crucified him, which shall also be judged yet in the Heathen

foremost into hell, for the deliverance of the remnant. For there is yet
another combat at hand with the Dragon, and stool of the beast and the false
Prophet; by reason whereof also the day of vengeance and judgment, that shall be
made manifest like fire, has been already denounced and declared, according to
the spirit of the former Prophets, 1 Thessalonians.
