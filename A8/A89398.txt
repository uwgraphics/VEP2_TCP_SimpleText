A Mournful Ditty of the Lady Rosamond, King Henry the seconds Concubine, who
was poisoned to death by Queen Elenor in VVoodstoost Bower near Oxford.
To the tune of, Flying Fame,


WHhenas King Henry ruled this land,
the second of that name,
Besides the Queen he dearly loved
a fair and Princely Dame:
Most Peerless was her beauty found,
her favor and her face.
A sweeter creature in the world
did never Prince embrace.
Her crisped locks like threads of gold
appeared to each man's sight,
Her comely eyes like Orient Pearls
did cast a heavenly light.
The blood within her Crystal cheek
did such a color drive,
As if the Lilly and the Rose
for Master-ship did strive,
Yea Rosamond, fair Rosamond,
her name was called so,
To whom Dame Elenor our Queen
was known a mortal foe:
The King therefore for her defense
against the furious Queen,
At Woodstock builded such a Bower
the like was never seen.
Most curiously this Bower was built
of stone and timber strong,
A hundred and fifty doors
did to this Bower belong,
And they so cunningly contrived
with turnings round about,
That none but with a clew of thread
could enter in or out.
And for his Love and Ladies sake
that was so fair and bright,
The keeping of that Bower he gave
unto a vallant Knight.
But Fortune that does often frown,
where she before did smile,
The Kings delight, the Ladies joy
full soon she did beguile.
For why? the Kings ungracious son
whom he did high advance
Against his father raised wars
within the Realm of France:
But yet before our comely King
the English land forsook.
Of Rosamond his Lady fair,
his last farewell he took,
O Rosamond the only Rose,
that pleases best mine eye,
The fairest Rose in all the world
to feed my fantasy.
The flower of my affected heart,
whose sweetness does excel.
My Royal Rose a thousand times
I bid thee now farewell.
For I must leave my famous Flower,
my sweetest Rose a space,
And cross the sons to famous France
proud Rebels to abase,
But yet my Rose be sure thou shall
my coming shortly see,
And in my heart while hence I am
I Will bear my Rose with me.
When Rosamond the Lady fair
did hear the King say so,
The sorrow of her grieved heart,
her outward looks did show
And from her clear and Crystal eyes
the tears gusht out a pace,
Which like the Silver Pearled dew
ran down her comely face.
Her lips like to the Coral red
did wax both wan a pale,
And for the sorrow conceived
her vital spirits did fail.
And falling down all in swound
before King Henry's face
Full often within his princelyarms
her body did embrace.
And twenty times with watery eyes
he kissed her tender cheek
Until he had revived again,
her senses mild and meek.
Why grieves my Rose, my sweetest Rose
the King did often say,
Because quoth she to bloody wars
my Lord must part away.
But since your grace in Foreign Coasts
among your Foes unkind,
Most go to hazard life and limb,
why should I stay behind?
Nay rather let me like a Page,
your Sword and Target bear.
That on my breast the blow may light
that should offend you there.
O let me in your Royal tent
prepare your bed at night,
And with sweet baths refesh your grace
at your return from fight,
So I your presence may enjoy.
no toil I will refuse,
But wanting you my life is death
which does true Love abuse.
Content thy self my dearest Love
thy rest at home shall be
In Englands sweet and pleasant soil
for travel fits not thee.
Fair Ladys brook no bloody wars
sweet peace their pleasure breed
The nourisher of hearts content,
which fancy first did feed.
My Rose shall rest in Woodstock-bower
with musicks sweet delight.
While I among the piercing Pikes
against my Foe^ do fight
My Rose in Robes of Pearl and Gold
with Diamonds richly ^ight
Shall dance the Galliard of my Love
while I my foes do smite.
And you Sir Thomas whom I trust
to be my Loves defense
Be careful of my Royal Rose
when I am parted hence.
And there-withal he forth a sigh
as though his heart would break
And Rosamond for very grief
not one plain word could speak,
The second Part, to the same tune,


ANd at the parting well they might,
in heart be grieved sore,
After that day fair Rosamond
the King did see no more.
For when his Grace had past the Seas
and into France was cone.
Queen Elenor with evious heart
to Woodstock came anon.
And forth she called this trusty Knight,
who keep this curious Bower,
Who with his clew of twined thread
came from that famous flows,
And when that they had wounded him
the Queen this thread did get.
And want where Lady Rosamond
was like an Angel set.
But when the Queen with steadfast eyes,
beheld her heavenly face,
She was amazed in her mind,
at her exceeding grace,
Cast of off thy Robes from thee she said
that rich and costly be,
And drink thou up this deadly drought
which I have brought for thee,
But presently upon her knee
sweet Rosmond did fall
And pardon of the Queen she craved
for her offenses, all.
Take pity on my youthful years,
fair Rosamond did cry.
And let me uot with poison strong
enforced be to dye.
I will renounce this sinful life,
and in a Cloister bide,
Or rise be banished if you please
to range the world so wide.
And for that fault which I have done,
though I was forced thereto.
Preserve my life, and punish me
as you think good to do.
And with these wo^de her Lilly haud
she wrong full often there
And down along her c^mely cheeks
proceeded many a tear
But nothing could this ^urious Queen
therewith appeased be
The cup of deadly poison filled
as she sat on her knee.
She gave that comely Dame to drink*
who took it in her hand,
And from her hended knee arose
and on her feet did stand.
And casting up her eyes to heaven
she did for mercy call,
And drinking up the poison strong
her life she lost withal.
And when that death through every limb
had done her greatest spite,
Her chiefest foes did plain confess;
she was a glorious Wight.
Her body then they did Entomb,
when life was fl^d away,
At Woodstock near to Oxford town
as may be seen this day.
