THE SPEECH OF PATRICK EARL OF MARCHMONT His Majesty's High Commissioner To the
PARLIAMENT, AT the Conclusion of the Session, the first of September School.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
THe Season of Harvest is so far advanced, that the Members of this House are
beginning to long for a Close of this Session, that they may go to the Country
to see to the Reaping of their Cropped of Corns, which God be thanked is so much
bettered since you meet together, that the Fear the Country was under of
Dearth and Scarcity, is changed to a good Hope, which is very comfortable to
all, especially the poorer sort.

Albeit your Session has not been long, yet when what you have done in the
Service of your King and Country is duly Considered; All must be satisfied
that you have improven your time diligently, and to very good purpose: I need
not recapitulat your Acts made, they are so recent; but this I may assert, that
what you have done makes a good Demonstration of your most hearty Affection to,
and entire Trust in your Sovereign Lord the KING, and of your Disposition and
Readiness to serve him in that which is his greatest Satisfaction, His Fatherly
Design of increasing the Prosperity and Happiness of His good Subjects; and to
do every thing toward the Support of His Majesty's Honor and Government,
which can be expected from a People deeply sensible of, and thankful for the
Great Blessing of GOD to this Nation, of Bringing and Establishing a Pious,
Wise, Courageous, and active Protestant KING, to bear the Crown and sway the
Scepter of this Kingdom.

I will not fail God willing fully to represent to His Majesty, both the
greatness of your Performances, and the Heartiness, Alacrity and Calmness of
your Procedure, and I am very persuaded His Majesty will not only be well
satisfied of what you have done, but will also heartily accept it as a clear
evidence of your firm and unalterable Loyalty and good Affection to him, and
Zeal in His Service.

My Lords and Gentlemen,

And I also recommend to you in your several Stations, the Preservation of the
Peace, the due Execution of the Laws; which is indeed the Nurse of peace, and
the charitable maintenance of the Poor, who by the hardships of this and former
years are become very numerous: That so the Works of Piety and Charity
increasing and flourishing in this Nation by the example of you who represent
it; There may be good ground of hopeing, that Almighty GOD will bless and
establish both the King and the People.
