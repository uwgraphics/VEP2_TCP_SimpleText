Die Lunae 7mo. November, 1642.
WHereas in these times of public danger and distraction, there is a recourse
unto the City of London of diverse persons that are come into the said City and
Suburbs thereof to reside, and have taken Houses or Lodgings for their
habitations, being strangers and altogether unknown how they stand affected; It
is therefore Ordered by the Commons in Parliament, that the Lord Major of the
said City, shall cause a general search and inquiry to be made from time to
time throughout the said City and Suburbs thereof, and to take ^^eciall notice
of the said persons and their attendants, and of their names; and ^^r the
better discovery how they stand affected, shall tender unto them the
^ropositions for Horse Money or Plate, and to take their subscriptions, and to
in^orme himself whether they do make their paiements accordingly into the
Guild Hall of the said City; And to return the names of such as cannot give ^
good account of their coming to the said City or suburbs thereof, or that
should refuse to subscribe to the said Propositions, according to their
several ^states and qualities, that some further course may be forthwith taken
by this House in that behalf.
