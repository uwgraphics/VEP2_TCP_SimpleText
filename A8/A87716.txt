To Mr. Thomas Edwards.
Sir
You stand as one professing your self to be instructed by Christ with
Abilities from God, to throw dowue Error, and therefore to that end do preach
every third Day, may it therefore please you and those that employ you in that
work, to give these leave whom you so brand, as bubliquely to object against
what you say, when your Sermon is ended, as you declare your self: and we hope
it will be an increase of further Light to all that fear God and put a large
Advantage into your hanqs if you have the Truth on your side, to cause it to
shine with more clearness and I hope we shall do it with Moderation as
becomes Christians.

November. 15. 1644. Yours, William Kiff^^
