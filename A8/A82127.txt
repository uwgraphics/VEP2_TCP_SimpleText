A DECLARATION OF THE Citizens and Inhabitants of the City of Chester, WHOSE
NAMES ARE SVBSCRIBED, Summoned to appear before His Majesty's Commissioners for
the Array at the Roodey, within the Liberties of the said City, for their clear
manifestation of their Allegiance to His Majesty, and duty to His Parliament;
Do Declare,
THat as it is a Sacred truth that a Kingdom divided cannot stand, so it is a
legal principle, that His most Sacred Majesty is the head, and the Parliament
the representative body of His Kingdom, and that in the Cordial union of His
Majesty and His Parliament consists the safety, glory, and the happiness
thereof.

And They for their parts heartily wish they may be accursed as Corah and his
Accomplices, that do or shall purposely occasion or foment any difference
between His Majesty and His Parliament, And therefore they further declare
their readiness with their Lives and Fortunes to obey His Majesty as their
most Dear and Dread Sovereign according to their due Allegiance, and the
resolution to defend the just Privileges of Parliament according to their free
and just Protestation, and that as God and the Fundamental Laws of this
Kingdom has joined His Majesty and the Parliament together, So they cannot
agree unto a disjoynted obedience, but do Declare themselves Enemies to all
such as shall go about to put His Majesty and the Parliament asunder.

And for this Resolution they have great encouragement from His Majesty's own
Declaration attested with forty of the Nobility and Privy Council, whereby He
has most graciously assured them and all other His People, that He has no
more thoughts of making war against His Parliament, then against His own
Children, and that He will defend the just Privileges of Parliament, and
maintain and observe the Acts assented to by His Gracious Majesty this
present Parliament without violation; for which as for other His Majesty's
several gracious Protestations, for the defense of the Protestant Religion,
and the Laws of the Land, they return most humble thanks to His Majesty.

This Declaration w^^delivered by the Citizens of Chester to His Majesty's
Commissioners for the Writ of Array.
