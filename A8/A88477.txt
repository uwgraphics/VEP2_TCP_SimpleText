blazon or coat of arms
By the Major.
WHereas it is made known to my self, the Aldermen, and Commons in
Common Council assembled, by a Letter received from his Excellency the Lord
Fairfax, That his Lordship for the preventing of the quartering of his Army in
the City, does require, that a present supply of money may be paid for the use
of the Army, to enable them to pay their Quarters, out of the Arrears owing
upon the several assessements made for the maintenance of the said Army: In
pursuance therefore of an act of Common Council this day made; These are to
give notice to all Collectors and other persons in arrear upon any of the
assessements aforesaid, That if they do not on Monday next pay all such sums of
money as are owing by them in arrear, or is remaining in their hands, that then
the names of every person and persons so failing therein, shall be forthwith
returned, together with the several sums of money by them owing or remaining
in their hands: And the Minister of every Parish within this City and liberties
thereof, is desired both forenoon and afternoon to publish this in their
several Parish Churches, that so every person concerned therein may take
notice thereof, thereby to avoid the danger that may follow thereupon.

Dated at the Guild Hall London, this second day of December, 1648. Michel.
