15. June, 1645.
IT is desired that all Ministers in London, the Liberties, and within the
Lines of Communication do this Sabbath day bless God that he has been
pleased to hear our Prayers in the behalf of our Army; and has given the
Parliament a glorious Victory, killed many, taken many Prisoners, the Standard
with the Ramping Lion in Gold, with the Crown upon it taken, and Colonel
Crumwell pursuing; the Fight began on Saturday the 14. of June, about 12 a
clock at noon, and held a terrible fight for about half an hour: and it is
reported in the pursuit Prince Rupert is taken.

Tho. Atkin Major.
