LONDON: Printed for Edward Husband, Printer to the Honorable House of Commons.
April 16. 1646.

The Lords and Commons assembled in the Parliament of England at Westminster,
having received the several Papers from the Commissioners of the Parliament of
Scotland two of the 29 th and 30 th of September, with a third of the 9 th of
October; To the particulars therein contained, they returned this Answer:
COncerning the payment of the Scots Army, so much insisted upon in your
Lordships Papers, The several Declarations, and the diverse courses and ways
which in the said Papers are expressed, and acknowledged by your Lordships to
have been made, and taken by us for the payment of that Army, sufficiently
witness our constant care, and manifold endeavors for the supply thereof; And
if all these ways have notwithstanding proved so little effectual, as your
Lordships allege, yet can it not in any sort be imputed to the Houses of
Parliament, who no sooner have had any wants of that Army, or any obstructions
in the ways taken for the entertainment thereof represented unto then, but
they have forthwith applied themselves to supply the one, and remove the other
to the utmost of what lay in their power; Before the Scots Army was entered into
this Kingdom, We appointed a Committee to sit purposely at Godsmiths-Hall, to
provide Moneys and necessaries for the support thereof; This Committee has
sat ever since constantly to that end, and to put forwards the execution of
our Ordinances therein, whereat twice a week some of the Commissioners of
Scotland themselves were present to be witnesses and promoters of their
diligence; The same Committee had their Agents in every county, to quicken the
execution of our Orders below in the country; we allowed Sallaries and Rewards
to the Diligent, we gave power to punish the negligent, and all that should it
any sort divert or obstruct the coming in the those Assessments: When the
course first designed for the payment of the Scots Army out of the Estates of
Papists and other Delinquents, answered not expectation, we provided for it, as
for other Armies, by way of Tax and Assessment upon several counties; and when
those of the Northern parts proved insfficient for so great a charge, we added
others thereunto, and those of the most entire and quiet parts of the Kingdom,
where first was laid an Assessment of Two hundred thousand pounds in gross,
and after a Monthly Assessment of Twenty one thousand pounds per mensem: There
was never any expedient offered to us for the removal of any obstruction in the
raising of those Assessments, which we did not readily assent unto: There was
never any thing desired of us, by our Brethren of Scotland which was in our
power to grant, which we have not willingly agreed unto, for the more speedy
and more effectual execution of our Orders, for the pay and support of that
Army: There was no course taken for any other Army, but we have taken the like
also for the Scots Army; so that we may truly affirm, That it has not rested
on us, that that Army has not been as well paid, and provided for, as any
other whatsoever; but if the Activenesse and great Successes of some other
Armies have given us more credit in procuring Moneys to be advanced for them,
or more quickened the spirits of the people to pay in their Assessments to them;
surely, that ought not to be turned into matter of Complaint against us, having
found the same by experience from time to time, in the payment of the Armies of
our own Nation; possibly also, the pay of other Armies may appear more
constant, and their wants less then it is well known to us, that both the one
and the other have been; neither have our endeavors been altogether so
ineffectual for the Supply of the Scottish Army, but that from the sixth of
October 1643. to the first of November 1645. there has been actually paid to
them in Money and Provisions, for which Money has been issued out of
Goldsmiths-Hall, the Sum of Two hundred twenty thousand six hundred and twenty
nine pounds Sterlin, besides Nine thousand pounds in Money and Lead paid unto
them at York: And what they have received upon the Assessments of the Northern
parts, appointed to be paid in to the Lord Mayor of York, and upon the fifth
and twentieth part, and from the Coal, and Excise of Newcastle, and of the
Northern parts, or otherwise by any Assignments of both Houses of Parliament;
And likewise besides another Assessment of Twenty two thousand pounds per
mensem, Assessed upon the County of York in Moneys and Provisions for four
months, during the siege of York, and after amounting to Eighty eight thousand
pounds, and also besides Ten thousand pounds more for to cloth the soldiers of
that Army, upon the return to Newcastle, over and above all that themselves
have taxed and levied in the several Counties where they have been, and their
free quarter and disorderly plunderings (which if they have been so excessive
as the cry thereof from several parts represents them to our Ears) it is not
much to be wondered, if the water run more sparingly from the Cistern and
Conduit, when it is so much exhausted at the Springhead, from whence the
Assessments for the entertainment of that Army and other Forces should have
risen. Concerning the Excise of the Northern parts, and the ways that are
alleged to be taken to divert it from the Scottish Army, by forestalling it
here in the South, and applying it to other uses, no such practices have been
made known to us; and whenever they shall be discovered, we shall be ready to
apply fitting remedies thereunto: And for the Coal of Newcastle possibly the
profit thence arising might fall very short of the estimate made thereof in
some one month, but in other Months it has come in, in greater quantities.
And we find, that for these Twelve Months last past, there has actually come
in, and been taken to the use of that Army upon the Coals of Newcastle and
Sunderland above Fifty three thousand pounds sterling, whereof Four thousand
five hundred pounds was of the Customs belonging to the Navy: And if upon the
taking of Newcastle by the Scottish Army, the course for the managing of the
Coals settled by both Houses of the Parliament of England in the Committee of
Goldsmiths-Hall had not been interrupted; That Committee might have been better
able to have given an Account of any decay of Trade therein, and how it has
happened that many Months it has fallen below the first estimate thereof.

Having made answer to the most materirall points in your Lorships papers
concerning the pay of the Scotts army, as you have very frequently and very
freely declared unto us the wants and necesities thereof, through default of
pay, so shall we also with the like freedom and brotherly affection, represent
unto our Brethren of Scotland some particulars concerning the proceedings of
that Army.

It is well known unto your Lorships that we have upon diverse occasions,
signified our advices and directions, how that Army might employ it self most
effectually for the advancement of the public service of this Kingdom, by
engageing against the common Enemies, and the places held and possessed by
them, wherein (by what occasion we know not) we have found our selves several
times disappointed of our hopes and expectations, by which means not only the
common cause has bin retarded, but also the end frustrated for which the
assistance of so great and Army was desired by us; which was, that a speedy
conclusion might be put to these unhappy Wars we shall not need to go
further back for an instance, then to that whereof the sense is freshest in
our minds, and which in that conjuncture of time and of our affairs, proved
very prejudicial to the service of this Kingdom, which was the continuing of
that Army in the North where no Enemy was, and not marching to beseiged
Newarke, at such time as it was thereunto desired by both Houses of Parliament,
a^^^ough they not only expressed their desires therein, but also their care in
provision of money, and ammunition to enable and encourage them to undertake
that work; But having received no satisfaction at al in that particular, till
that now by your Lordships Letter of the 12. of Nowember the resolution of the
General the Earl of Leven, concerning the marching of that Army toward
Newarke was signified unto us, By means of this delay, not only the Northern
parts have layne all this while under a most unsupportable burden, but also
the fairest opportunity that has yet offered it self to us since the
beginning of this War of putting an end to our miseries, together with the
season the year for the speedy reducing of that place which was the principal
ground of our resolution in that particular, is already slipped out of our hands,
And the advance of the thirty thousand pounds, which we had good hope, and some
assurance of from the City for the use of that army, in case it came to Newarke
before the first of November, and not otherwise, is rendered more difficult and
doubtful unto us.

It was far from our intentions that the Scottish Army should neither be
provided for by us, nor yet suffered to provide for their own subsistence, nor
does the contrary appear by any actions or omissions on our part, nor yet by
any sufferings of that army, but that according to our power, we have made
provisions for them, and that they also have supplied themselves.

We shall remember according to your Lordships expressions in your papers, That
not written Ordinances but real payments must satisfy the necessity of the
Soldiers, And we hope it shall be as well remembered also, how far better then
paper, our Ordinances have proved to that Army, which has not bin more ready
to engage it self really in the service of this Kingdom, then we have bin
forward to pay it really, for to satisfy the necessities of the soldiers, And
therefore desire such expressions may be forborne, which may seem to derogate
from the honor either of the proceedings or Ordinances of Parliament.

When the Treaty was concluded between the two Kingdoms, it was supposed that
such might be the wants and necessities of this Kingdom, as that they might not
be able to make due and constant payment to the Scots Army, yet was it no
supposed that in default thereof they might forbear to engate their Army, much
less lay Taxes upon the people of England to lay themselves, this Kingdom
being to give their public faith for the payment of their Arreares with
Interest, as on the other side the Kingdom of Scotland gave their public
faith that neither their entrance into, nor continuance in the Kingdom of
England, should be made use of to any other ends then such as are contained in
the Covenant and Articles of the Treaty.

That it is contrary to the Liberties of the subjects of England That any Taxes
or Levies of Moneys should be laid or raised upon them without the consent of
both Houses of Parliament* we need not declare to your Lordships.

And we are sorry that the cries which continually sound in our ears from the
people, especially of the Northern parts, brought to us by the hands of such
us we have inmosted there, should enforce us to represent unto our Brethren of
Scotland, the great Complaints, which long since, and at this present, are made
of the laying of Taxes of Money, and other things by some of the Scots Army,
and that also in very vast and excessive proportions, besides free Quarterings,
and disorderly plunderings of Horses and other goods, which courses being taken
and continued; It cannot be expected that we should continue the monthly pay
of that Army, which though we have not taken occasion to stop and ^urcease,
upon the Taxes and leavies of Moneys and other proceedings of that Army, Yet
we expect (as that which of right is due, that our of it, deduction and
satisfaction should be given in the Premises. And as we are obliged to make
good the monthly pay of that Army according to the Treaty, so long as we shall
find it necessary to use the assistance thereof within this Kingdom and no
longer, so is that Army likewise bound to demean themselves conformable to the
tenor of the Treaty, and according thereunto to give satisfaction to this
Kingdom; That such forces of the Scottish Nation, as have been put into the
several Garrisons of Newcastle upon Tyne, the City of Carlisle, and other
places in the North, without the consent of both Houses of the Parliament of
England shall be removed, to the intent that the same may be disposed off in
such manner as shall be thought fitting by the said Houses of Parliament, The
performance whereof we have demanded from the Kingdom of Scotland, by our
Letter to that Parliament.

These things we held our selves bound to represent to our Brethren of
Scotland, as well in discharge of the trust reposed in us for the preservation
of the Interest and liberties of this Kingdom, as also the better to maintain
the union, and good Correspondency between the two Kingdoms, which being the
surest foundation of security, and prosperity to both Nations. It always has,
and always shall be the firm resolution of both Houses of the Parliament of
England, to preserve and maintain the same according to the Covenant and
Treaty, the common rules and marks which both Kingdoms have set up unto
themselves to steer their course by, in the pursuance of their joint
interests, and for the attaining of the good ends therein expressed and
contained, from which we desire that there may be no swerving on either side,
hoping and expecting the like redress and satisfaction from our Brethren of
Scotland, upon any infringement thereof, as we shall be ready to give unto
them if any such thing should happen on our part.

Concerning Religion, and the settling of Church Government, as there is
nothing wherein we have more desired to approve our consciences to God, and
our actions to the world, so do our hearts give us a very clear Testimony of
the faithful and diligent discharge of our duty therein, according to the
trust reposed in us, and the Covenant taken by us. And were conceive our
actions witness no less to all that will rightly weigh and consider, what we
have already done therein, and with what diligence and zeal we have from time
to time proceeded in that work of God, being resolved to continue so doing,
till we have fully supplied what shall yet appear wanting therein, it being
always to be remembered, that the preserving of the Liberty, and freedom of
our debates, and Resolutions in Parliament, is not to be interpreted or termed
negligence or delay in us.

As to the Propositions of Peace to be sent to his Majesty in pursuance of our
Resolutions of the sixth of August communicated to your Lordships, we have
proceeded therein as the exigents of our affairs would permit, and the
Propositions being at this present continually in agitation and debate in
Parliament; We are resolved to apply our selves both speedily and effectually
to the perfecting of them according to the Present state of affairs, and we
doubt not but that our actions shall testify to our Brethren of Scotland, and
all the world, that there is no earthly thing more in our thoughts and desires,
then the settling of a safe and a well-grounded Peace in the three Kingdoms,
for which we have done and suffered as much as any Kingdom in the world.

FINIS.
