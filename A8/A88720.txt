A LETTER Sent from PORTSMOUTH, From a very Worthy Person there, To a Friend of
His in LONDON.
SIR,
THough when I left the Town, I was so unhappy as not to see You, yet give me
leave to make my self happy in Writing to You; And that will Inform You how the
Lord has wonderfully appeared in the business with Us at Portsmouth. This
morning five Troops of Horse, and five entire Companies of Foot Revolted from
the Wallingford Party, to the Interest of the Commonwealth: We sent out a
Party to look upon the Enemy; and having good Intelligence amongst them, it
pleased God the whole Company came in, some few Officers only excepted; so
that the Siege is Raised, and the Town at Liberty without a drop of Blood: The
Garrison is exceeding Strong, and Your Friends here in great heart, and great
hopes (by the Blessing of God) to Redeem the Public Liberty: And believe me,
as Monck is very Considerable in the North, so this Place will be in the South.
Sir Arthur Haslerig and Colonel Morley have behaved themselves very Gallantly.
The Isle of Wight is most part come in, unless it be Cowes Castle; a Party is
sent to reduce it; and by this I dare say you may aver that is reduced also.

I doubt not but We shall have a sudden Opportunity to Write again to You; and
as any thing happens here, You shall be certain to receive it from,

SIR, Your Most Real Servant, N. L.
Portsmouth, December. 20. 1659.
