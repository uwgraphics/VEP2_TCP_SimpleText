Committee for the Navy and Customs.
Die Martis 18 Martii, 1644.
WHereas the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, taking into
consideration the Redemption of the Captives taken by Turkish, Moorish, and
other Pirates, and prevention of the taking of others in time to come, did by
their Ordinance of the 24 of October last past, in ease of Merchants, ordeine,
That only one fourth part of the moneys due on the several Bonds entered into
by Merchants for payment of the one per Cent. upon the Act of Parliament passed
for that purpose, should be paid by the several Merchants so indebted, within
thirty days after publication of that Ordinance: And in case any Merchant
should not pay in his fourth part within the said time, that then their said
Bonds should be put in suit for the whole moneys, referring the execution of
the same to the Lord high Admiral and this Committee of the Navy, as by that
Ordinance more at large appears.

And whereas diverse Merchants have not paid in the sums due on the Bonds by
them entered into for the said duty, according to the intent of the said
Ordinance, whereby those poor Captives remain under servitude, and are
utterly deprived of the means appointed by Parliament for their Redemption.

The Committee in obedience to the said Order, do, with the advice,
approbation, and consent of the Lord high Admiral, declare and order, That the
Merchants so indebted as aforesaid, do pay in the fourth part of the moneys
due on their said Bonds within thirty days after the date hereof unto the
persons, and at the places appointed by that Ordinance: And if any shall fail
herein, they must expect due and speedy execution of the said Ordinance.

WARWICK. GILES GRENE.
