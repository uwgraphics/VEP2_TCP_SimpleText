A Prayer of Thanksgiving for His MAJESTY'S late Victory over the Rebels.
O Thou God of Hosts, who go forth with our Armies, and pleadest the cause
of thine Anointed against them that strive with Him, we acknowledge with all
lowliness of mind, that it is not our sword, nor the multitude of our Host
that has saved us, but it is thy Hand alone that has disposed of Victory to
thy Servant the King, that has covered his Head in the day of Battle, and
has kept his Crown from being thrown down to the ground. Not unto us
therefore, not unto us, but unto thee, O God, do we give the praise, beseeching
thee to accomplish the great work thou have begun for us, to continue the
blessings of Good success on the head of our Sovereign, and on His Army,
that the happiness thereof may flow from thence to the very skirts of His
People, to continue the fear, and consternation which thou have already cast
upon the Hearts of those who have rebelliously risen up against Him, to
enfeeble their strengths, to infatuate their Counsels, undeceive and disabuse
the seduced part of them, that they may know, and feel, that to take up Arms
against thy Vicegerent, is to fight against Heaven, that so by a timely and
conscientious submission to the just Authority of him whom thou have set over
them, the effusion of more blood may be prevented, the peace of this distracted
Kingdom settled, Faction may be cast out of the State, and Schism out of the
Church, to the advancement of thy Glory, the Kings Honor, and the Peoples
good. Grant this, O God, for thy old mercies sake, which thou were wont to show
unto this Nation, that both Prince and People may join in giving praise to
thee, who live and raignest world without end. Amen.
