Uncle that will bear you out in it? O fearful says the Malignant, what
words are here? But I prithee consider what has been done with what has been
spoken, can thou dislke of the words when thou think of the actions? must
the fowlest things that can be, be set forth in the fairest phrase that may be,
is Theft commendable, is Rape tolerable, and is not Murder damnable? And I
prithee how comes it to pass that these are so rife in England? must the
Actors be forborne, the councels winked at, and the Authority approved off?
This were the way indeed to gain the love of our Enemies, and dissemble our
selves to nothing. but the Kings person thou say is hated, it is by Thee then
and thy Fraternity that strive to keep him in the road of ruin, we that
speak plainly mean honestly, perhaps you pray for him (now) more then we
do, but whilst your hearts are wrong, your prayers cannot be right. We pray
heartily that God would be pleased to dispeirce the Cloud, and discover the
light to him, we pray that God would make him fit for our prayers; and when we
have prayed him into another condition, we will pray for him after another
Fashion, when he shall come in to his Parliament, and go forward with the
Work he has begun there, when he shall sit as a King in his Throne, and make
it appear by his Government that he sincerly aims at the glory of God, and
the good of his People, then he shall have the highest room in our hearts,
and we will pray earnestly (as you do now) that God may prosper him in all his
Actions.

FINIS.
