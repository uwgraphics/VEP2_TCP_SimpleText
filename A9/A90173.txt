THE ORGANS ECHO.
To the Tune of the Cathedral SERVICE.
1.
MEMENTO MORI,
I Will tell you a strange Story,
Will make you all sorry,
For our old friend William;
Alas, poor William.
2.
As he was in his Braverie,
And thought to bring us all in slaverie,
The Parliament found out his Knaverie,
And so fell William;
Alas, poor William.
3.
His Pope-like domineering,
And some other Tricks appearing,
Provoked Sir Edward Deering
To blame the old Prelate;
Alas, poor Prelate.
4.
Some say, he was in hope
To bring England again to the Pope,
But now he is in danger of an Axe or a Rope,
Farewell old Canterbury;
Alas, poor Canterbury.
5.
There Is another of the same Litter,
Whose Breech cannot choose but twitter,
He was against all goodness so bitter,
'Twas the Bishop of Ely;
Alas, poor Ely.
6.
And all the rest of that Lordly Crew,
Their great Insolences are like to rue,
As soon as the Parliament their lives do view:
Come down, brave Prelates;
Alas, poor Prelates.
7.
You know likewise in this two or three year,
Many a one for Lamb paid very dear,
But now he begins to stink for fear;
Therefore take heed Doctor Lamb:
Alas, poor Doctor Lamb.
8.
Then there is also one Doctor Duck,
The Proverb says, What Is worse then ill luck,
We hope the Parliament his feathers will pluck,
For being so busy, Doctor Duck;
Alas, poor Doctor Duck.
9.
Deanes and Chapters, with their Retinue,
Are not like long for to continue,
They have so abused their great Revenue,
That down must Ceremonies;
Alas, Popish Ceremonies.
10.
Ecclesiastical Courts are down too, they say,
England may be glad of that happy day,
They have of late borne such a great sway,
That farewell those poor Doctors;
Alas, poor Proctors.
11.
And now the Papists are at their wits ends,
To see the downfall of so many Friends;
But they shall all rue it ere the Parliament ends,
Believe it, Roman Catholics;
Alas, poor Catholics.
12.
There is another that hardly thrives,
Which many men of life deprives,
He Is now in Newgate for having two Wives:
It is the young Hangman;
Alas, poor Hangman.
FINIS.
Printed in the year 1641.
