To the Honorable the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the House of Commons,
now assembled in Parliament.
The humble Petition of the Knights, Gentlemen, Freeholders, and other
Principal Inhabitants of the County of Somerset in behalf of themselves and
many thousands of their County:
Shows,
THat whereas in stead of a settled peace and safety (the long expected fruit of
your faithful Endeavors and our cheerful Contributions) great distractions
and dangers are daily multiplied and increased, threatening the utter
disappointment of our hopes, and the overthrow of the very foundation of our
Weal and Liberty, to our extreme grief and sorrow, especially for the late
breach of the privileges of Parliament upon your Persons in an unparraleld
manner, by the wicked counsels and devises of a malignant party (as we
conceive) of Popish Lords and Bishops and others. We being struken with the
sense and horror of so desperate a mischief, do hold it high time to declare
the sincere and ardent Affection of our hearts, which we are ready to seal
with our purest blood, in defense of our Religion, his Sacred Majesty, our
dear Country; and that which is the life of our Liberty, the Rights and
Privileges of Parliament.

May it therefore please this Honorable Assembly to assist the earnest desires
of your Petitioners, That all Privileges of Parliament (the Inheritance and
safety of the Subject) may be made firm, that Popish Lords and Bishops be
forthwith removed from voting in the House of Peers, that all evil
Counselors and other Delinquents may receive condign punishment; that a
sufficient remedy be provided against the scandalous Ministers, that to secure
us from all home^^^^ and foreign practices, this Kingdom be (...) put in a
Posture of Defense, and that (...)efe and Safety of our distressed Brethren
(...) and be effectually prosecuted.

And We shall incessantly Pray, etc.
