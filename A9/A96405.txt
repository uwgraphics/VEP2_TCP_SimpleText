To the Monthly, and Quarterly Meetings of Friends, in England and Wales;
LONDON, the twenty six Day of the sixth Month, 1692.
Dear Friends and Brethern,
WIth our Dear and Tender love to you, and all the Faithful in Christ Jesus:
These are to Acquaint you, that since our late printed Epistle from our Meeting
for Sufferings, for a Collection for our poor distressed Friends in Ireland, we
have had diverse Accounts from thence by Letters, both of their disposal of what
has been already sent them from hence; and also how little away it went, when
distributed to the many Particulars toward their Supply; however, Friends love
and care for them here is very Acceptable to them.

We find they are very Charitable and Tender one toward another; in so much,
that although the Calamity was general, and very Heavy upon them, that those
that had something left, who were but few in Number, did readily contribute to
them that wanted present Subsistence, by several large Collections among
themselves.

And they considering our charges here in England was great, have been the more
tender and backward to apply to Friends here for Relief, although but few Friends
there can Administer to such a great Number of Friends, who are in a very poor
and low Condition, and many in great want; some having lost all, the very
Clothes off their Backs.

Their general Loss has been computed to amount to about Fifty Thousand
Pounds, and their Number not more then Friends in Yorkshire.

Now Dear Brethren, The intent of reminding you of these things, is, to entreat
you in the Love of God, and Tender Compassion to these our Suffering Friends
and Brethren, Zealously to stir up Friends in your respective Meetings, to a
speedy and Liberal Contribution, according to our aforesaid Epistle,
considering their distressed case, as if it were your own; and remembering
their Liberality, and Christian Charity to Friends in England, when under sore
Persecutions, their present Necessities being so great, requiring a speedy
supply, that this Meeting has already been constrained to Borrow one Thousand
Pounds, to remit thither for their present Relief, upon the Credit of this said
Collection; yet we are persuaded the said sum will fall far short of supplying
their great Necessities; We therefore hope you will take all speedy care,
effectually to hasten the said Collection.

Signed by Order and on behalf of the Meeting for Sufferings, George Whitehead,
Samuel Waldenfield, John Vaughton, William Bingley, John Field.

THis Meeting Desiring That the Friends in the Counties, and particular
Meetings, be acquainted of the renewed Accounts we received, of the Nessesities
of our Dear Friends in Ireland, we have hinted at in the Letter above written,
have ordered the same to be printed, that Friends may the more generally have
it, and have accordingly now Signed the same.
