A SHORT DISCOURSE, TOUCHING The Cause of the present unhappy Distractions, and
Distempers in this KINGDOM, and the ready Means to Compose, and Quiet them.
Printed in the year, 1642. feb. 8th
I Am persuaded that whosoever shall cast a judicious eye upon the present
state, and condition of Affairs in this KINGDOM; and shall examine the cause
of the unhapy Distractions, and Distempers that reign in it; will soon
discern that they have their spring and nourishment, rather from spiritual,
than from temporal interests, for that in this latter, all the Subjects of
this KINGDOM concurring, and agreeing in the same ends, it is but one work to
satisfy every single man's desire; when the Liberty of men's persons, the
propriety of their goods, and their being governed by the Laws of the Kingdom
is secured; every man's heart will be at quiet (for what concerns temporal
regards) and in securing and satisfying one man, the whole Kingdom, and each
single man it, is likewise thereby contented and secured.

But the differing interests between men in spiritual regards, cannot so
easily be reconciled by any obligatory sanctions or determinations; For that
which may stand with the liking of one party, cannot be hoped to be allowed of
by ^he Adverse; but rather we may believe, that since there are many several
persuasions among eminent men (yea all men in this Kingdom; It cannot be
expected, but that the satisfaction of one, must needs carry along with it the
displease of all ^he rest; And this discrepance of opinions, being in a
busin^sse of the highest concernment that can be (as importing no less then
every man's eternal happiness or misery) it must needs follow; that whilst
any party is in Jealousy, or apprehensi^^ of the others getting the advantage,
so as to impose their Doctrine and practice upon consciences governed b^
different Principles; there cannot choose but be nourished in their minds a
great alienation of their affections one from another; and a struggling of each
side to get the mastering hand; And a distrust and su^pition of each others
actions; so as whiles every one striveth to put his Adversary into a condition
of not being able to hurt him, the whole frame of the Commonwealth is weakened,
and disjoynted by each Members drawing and pressing a several way; It were to
be wished that the cure of this disease, might be effected by bringing into one
fold all the sheep, that bear the Mark of our supreme Shepherd Christ, and
have given their names to be Soldiers in his Militia. But si^ce this is a
blessing rather to be wished, than hoped for (men's apprehensions being so
various: And the principles depending of them, whereby they govern themse^ves,
being so different, that they are not easily to be reconciled.)

The next remedy of the present inconveniences, surely is to provide that they
may not destroy one another; but every party being at ease, and contented
within themselves, in those affairs that regard God and their own
Consciences, and being secured from any encroaching or pressures upon them that
way, they may then with unanimity and comfort, join all their endeavors
together for promoting, and advanceing their temporal emoluments.

Which course certainly is not only the most judicious, and the most prudent
in humane wisdom; But is also the most pious, and the most godly in Divine
respects, nay, to do the contrary, were most impious and wicked; for since it
is clear, that no man could be so much an Enemy to himself, as to undergo
present and evident inconveniences for matters of Religion, if his conscience
did not assure him that God required it at his hands, and that it is no less
then a matter of damnation, wilfully to deny his obedience to his maker, the
great God of Heaven and Earth, and to give it to human power, It cannot
therefore be denied, but that it is a high impiety for any power to force
another unto what he beleiveth to be sacrilegious and damnable, and extreme
cruelty and tyranny, to punish one for doing what in his conscience he is
clearly convinced, is the only best; man's reason cannot be forced by outward
violence; all that can be expected from such a course, is to have weak minds
through humane frailty become Hypocrites; for this is undeniable, what is not
of faith is sin, yea it comes near that sin against the Holy Ghost, if
that sin be to do in the Worship of God contrary to the express dictamens
of their own conscience.

The Tenor of Gods proceedings in propagating Religion is quite different from
this inhumane course; he has power to ruin, and destroy in a moment, those
that shall be refractory to his Laws; yet he imposes no fear or constraint
upon any man; he disposes all things sweetly, and leaves every man in this
World, the freedom of his own choice proceeding therein as stands with
Justice, and the truth of God, with the Council of his will and nature of his
Decree determined, that is not without Christ the satisfaction of his Justice,
nor yet without free consent of the creature, which is by his own grant a free
power in nature, uncompellable, especially by humane power; God accepts only
the free giver, he rejects the worship of them that unwillingly pay it him,
nor will he let them go with Gideon to fight his battle, that have more mind
to stay at home.

We may then safely conclude, that since true Religion is a supernatural
thing, and a mere gift of God, not possible to be forced into men's souls by
humane compulsion; The establishing of it in men's minds ought wholly to be
left unto his Divine ways of working and planting it, for it is an effect that
flows from a supernatural principle of grace, which works upon our hearts,
by those inscrutable paths that none but God can tread: Let us then take heed
of intruding our unworthy sickles into his harvest, lest with Vzziah, we be in
this life or the next, stricken dead for presuming to prop up his Arc
unwarrantably.

But that it may appear yet more evident, how unfit it is to make coercive
Laws for Religion, and men's Consciences, let us consider how unagreeable such
a proceeding is as well to reason, as to the rules of Gods wisdom and
goodness; those that make such Laws are men: who supposing them never so
good, and never so wise, yet as long as they are men, they are still liable to
error; and all their Ordinances may be defective: we find no spirt of
infallibility promised to humane consultations; Amongst the Apostles, Peter was
found reprehensible; even after receiving the holy Ghost, and as great
confirmation and riveting in faith and piety, as humane nature is capable of:
if then any misapprehension, or mistaking should creep into their Counsels,
and their Orders or Laws thereupon prove erroneous, and unwarrantable; how
lamentable a case were it, that the godly tenderhearted that are in the right
(as they must be that oppose them) should suffer either in persons, or Estates,
for adhereing to truth and Justice.

Certainly the rule which Christ prescribes of giving to Caesar those things
which are Caesar's, and to God what is his, does fully determine this point, and
sets a period to all further questions about it; Reverence, Duty, and
Obedience in temporal matters belong to the civil Magistrate, and whosoever
shall break the tie of civil Society, let him suffer for it, by the hand of
humane Justice; But to take Gods own peculiar work out of his hand, let no
man presume: He only has the floodgates of Grace in his power; he only can
speak to our hearts, and from his whispers and instructions only can true
Religion be derived. To his infinite goodness then, let that task be wholly
referred; It is our part to pray, and use such other helps for the instructing
of others as God has directed in his word, but his only with power to effect
it.

But peradventure you will ask then, whether the godly may use no weapon
against those that have a spiritual War with them by being different in their
Judgment, and practice? yes surely (if it be sinful) they may use that weapon
which God has put into their hand to sight with in this Cause; It is
aspitituall weapon, and therefore proportionable to a spiritual conflict; Let
wicked persons and unbelievers be cut off from the rest of the Church, by the
sword of excommunication, not from the world by the Sword of Justice: for that
is directly contrary to the Apostles rule.

In this particular, where he appoints the use of excommunication, and
tells the Church, they must with patience expect repentance and amendment
from such offenders; which expectance being ordained by the Holy Ghost, surely
it must be a great impiety, to disobey this Divine Constitution, and press
further by any impious zeal, to extirpate by civil power those plants, that
are blasted by a spiritual breath; so that the result of this discourse is,
that it cannot be hoped, that any Kingdom or State, should be happy, or
flourish under Gods blessing, until all men's hearts are united together, and
made to concur joynely, and unanimously, in advanceing the temporal
interests of it, by every man's being secured, and quieted in the possession of
his spiritual ones, which can be done no way but by freedom in matters of
Religion; wherein though a certain tenor of Faith and form of Divine Worship
be agreed of, and established in general for those that have their
consciences, molded that way; yet others, that cannot yield their assent
thereunto, may to themselves enjoy the freedom of their conscienes as long as
they do nothing to interrupt the civil society.

And if any worldly man, that takes a scantling of the ways of God by a
humane measure, should apprehend that such a toleration (as men call it) might
in tract of time suffer a false Doctrine to take so deep root, as at length
it may grow so strong, and spread so wide, that the now prevalent party may in
the end be put to the worst, and when they are grown to be the weakest side,
may not be treated with such moderation as is now desired at their hands.

All which may appear possible enough (says he) to whosoever shall consider,
how without careful weeding, the best corn will soon be choked up with
thistles, and such other perverse excrescences of depraved nature.

I shall but desire him to examine seriously and calmely, in the particular
progress that must be allowed to such a turn, how improbable, or rather
impossible it is; And not content himself, with a specious objection, drawn
from generals, that in their due sense are true; but are wrested in their
application to this purpose, let him consider, how unlikely it is that falsehood
should prevail against truth (for so he conceives it) when it carries with
it no bias of humane advantage, to warpe men's minds that way: number, power
and reputation, is yet of his side, what should afterward supplant it? what
invitements, or allurements, has the other, to bewitch men to forsake Divine
truth, to their temporal prejudice? for all the advantage the other can boast
of, is but impunity. It is discountenanced, they have power, are not cherishing
Fathers, nor nurceing Mothers to it; It has no weapons to fight with; it must
wrestle naked against the others advantageous Arms, so remote a Providence
then, or rather such a distrust, argues some secret consciousnesse of inward
deficiency and weakness, and then, why should they not conclude with Gamaliel,
that if the Doctrine, whose progress they apprehend be of God, it is not in
their Power, nor of all mankind together to hinder the growth of it?

But if they believe it false, and are firmly persuaded of the perfection and
verity of their own; they should not doubt, but that God who made the
Egyptian Magicians sticks break in pieces at their Encounter, with Aarons
rod, And that made Dagon fall to the ground at the approach of the Arc, and
that consumed Baals Priests with sire, When they stood Competition with his
true Prophet, will also unmaske the Counterfeit beauties of a false Religion,
when it raises it self against the true one, and has no support of temporal
Advantages, to underprop it.

Now that which I draw from the former grounds, and upon which I conclude the
truth of my conceit, is, that as it does in every part singularly well agree
with it self, so no way thwarting, but agreeing also most fully with these
seven things, viz. Election, Predestination, Grace, Faith, Redemption,
Religion, and with God. and that with seven things in the nature of God, viz.
his infinite Essence or Law of his omnipotent power; his excellent wisdom,
his wonderful Goodness, his free love, his exact Justice, his unspeakeable
mercy, and his unfaylable truth, all which may be declared in their place.

FINIS.
