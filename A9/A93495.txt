Expressed in a Letter Dated September. 6. from A CLARKE in the LEAGUER.

London Printed for H. Blunden, September. 9. 1642.

FROM OUR LEAGUER near Portsmouth, this present sixth day of September, 1642.
Sir,
MY humble duty remembered unto you, I have sent you formerly what news we have
here, and now God has made us happy all in general, and my self in
particular, to be the Messenger of good tidings, wherein God has been pleased
to declare his own power and might, which is in the taking of Sousley Castle,
within a short mile of Portsmouth, cituate on the Sea shore, which kept the
Ships from coming to aid us, the strength of which is admirable, and I
believe all men that have been in it, will say it is the strongest Castle in
England for the bigness; it is walled about with a wall of three or four
yards thick, about thirty foot high, a Graft round about, of some three or
four yards deep, and five yards in breadth, it has 14. pieces of Ordnance
planted round, all but two Pieces shot 12. pound bullets, besides other small
Pieces, it has dainty Chambers in it, fit to entertain a Prince, it was new
repaired lately, the Captains name is Challenner, he is supposed to be a
Papist, one of Colonel Gorings companions, he was with him the same day, about
eleven a clock he was in Portsmouth, and plotted with him, it was to plant
Ordnance upon our entrance into the Heath, Colonel Goring planted thirty piece
of Ordnance upon us, the Castle planted all their Ordnance upon us, and the
Town had planted some upon the Bridge entering into the Castle, that had not
God, who stops the mouths of Lions, stayed their shot, we had all been cut
off, had there been a thousand: On Saturday night last with four hundred men,
our Captain, and Captain Lauhan, and Captain Mirrick, our Colonels brother,
about ten a clock at night they marched forth, Goring had intelligence, and
Challenner, and that day held a consultation, but Goring not daring to trust
this report, and in regard of his weakness, would not lend the Castle any men,
yet prepared for his own defense, and planted his Ordnance just all the way in
our travel to the Castle: about twelve a clock we proceed forward, but
unprepared of any provision for such a design, our men courageously, with as
undaunted spirits as ever men went, and with a resolution to die before the
Gates, rather then to retreat, they sung Psalms, and were well prepared to
die, when we came within half a mile, about one a clock, some of our men gave
the Town an Alarm, and so away to the Castle, on two a clock our men came
within two Bows shot, and there lay an hour, about three a clock they
marched, and took away on the left hand, and the enemy expected them on the
right, so we were not descrved all this while, and when we were come on the
South side of the Calde, we were spyed by them, but we were got on the
Seashore before they could make shot upon us, that we marched secure, and came
between the Sea, and the Castle, and leaped into the Graft, where some of our
men hurt themselves, that side were no Ordnance, for they had removed them on
the other side, toward the Heath; Colonel Goring by the shot of a Piece from
the Castle, had notice we were there, he shot upon us violently at least thirty
Pieces of Ordnance, and our Captain was upon the Bridge, and there came a
Piece close to him; and one thing is remarkable, when we came to the Bridge,
there was a great piece of Timber, and some ten men fell down behind it, for
they saw the bullet coming, and it hit just on the Log and mist the men, we
lost not a man; our men, you would admire what undaunted spirit they have, they
would needs scale the Walls, and the Captain without shot cried for Quarter,
and so the Castle was delivered to us, and we left a Garrison, and departed to
our Quarters, and gave the Town a salutation with our Ordnance presently, you
may see the Town perfectly, and see if any stir out, the Town is mightily
discouraged at this, and two Horsemen last night came out and submitted to us,
and laid down their Arms, and all Gorings soldiers have, all but some
desperate Helhounds laid down their Arms to him, and he entreats them to
hold out a day or two longer, and he sent for a Parley yesterday, his
conditions are not liked of, and this day our companies march toward the
Town, what will be done I know not, I hope next Letter to Date it from
Portsmouth, there is no more news: Thus with my Prayers to God to bless you,
and to return all your loving favors into your own bosom, I rest,

Your obedient Kinsman. I. S.

FINIS.
