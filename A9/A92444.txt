THE SCOTTISH Commissioners Demand concerning their sixth ARTICLE.
COncerning our Sixth demand, Although it has often come to pass, that these
who have been joined by the bonds of Religion, and Nature, have suffered
themselves to be divided about the things of this World; And although our
Adversaries, who no less labor the division of the two Kingdoms, then we
do all seek Peace, and follow after it, as our common Happiness, do presume
that this will be the Partition wall, to divide us, and to make us lose all our
labors taken about the former Demands, Wherein by the help of God; by his
Majesty's Princely goodness, and Justice, and your Lordships noble, and equal
dealing, We have so fully accorded, and to keep us from providing for a firm
and weell grounded Peace, by the wisdom, and justice of the Parliament of
England, which is our greatest desire expressed in our last Demand. We are
still Confident, that as we shall concerning this Article represent nothing
but what is true, Just, and Honorable to both Kingdoms; So will your
Lordships hearken to us, and will not suffer your selves, by any slanders, or
suggestions, to be drawn out of that straight and safe way, wherein ye have
walked since the beginning.

IT is now We suppose known to all England, especially to both the Honorable
Houses of Parliament, And by the occasion of this Treaty, more particularly to
your Lordships, That our distresses in our Religion, and Liberties were of late
more pressing then We were able to bear, That our Complaints and
Supplications for redress, were answered at last with the terrors of an Army;
That after a Pacification greater Preparations were made for war, whereby
many Acts of Hostility were done against us, both by Sea and Land; The
Kingdom wanted administration of Justice, and We constrained to take arms
for our defense; That we were brought to this extreme, and intolerable
necessity, either to maintain diverse Armies upon our borders against Invasion
from England, or Ireland, still to be deprived of the benefit of all the Courts
of Justice, and not only to maintain so many thousands as were spoiled of
their ships, and goods, but to want all Commerce by Sea, to the undoing of
Merchants, of Saylors, and many others who lived by Fishing, and whose callings
are vpholden from hand to mouth by Sea trade: Any one of which evils is able in
a short time to bring the most potent Kingdom to Confusion, Ruin and
Desolation, how much more all the three at one time combined to bring the
Kingdom of Scotland to be no more a Kingdom: Yet all these behoved we either
to endure, and under no other hope, then of the perfect slavery of our selves,
and our posterity in our Souls, lives, and Means; Or to resolve to come into
England, not to make Invasion, nor with any purpose to fight, except we were
forced, God is our Judge, our actions are our witnesses, and England does now
acknowledge the truth, against all suspicions to the contrary, and against the
impudent lies of our Enemies, But for our relief, defense, and preservation
which we could find by no other means, when we had essayed all means, and
had at large expressed our pungent, and pressing necessities, to the Kingdom,
and Parliament of England. Since therefore the War on our part (which is no
other but our coming into England with a guard) is defensive, and all men do
acknowledge, that in common equity, the defendant should not be suffered to
perish in his just and necessary defense, but that the pursuer, whether by way
of Legal Process in the time of Peace, or by way of violence, and unjust
invasion in the time of war, ought to bear the charges of the defendent. We
trust that your Lordships will think that it is not against reason for us, to
demand some reparation of this kind. And that the Parliament of England by
whose Wisdom and Justice we have expected the redress of our wrongs, will
take such course, as both may in reason give us satisfaction and may in the
notable demonstration of their Justice serve most for their own honor.

Our earnestness in following this our Demand, does not so far wrong our
sight, and make us so undiscerning, as not to make a difference between the
Kingdom, and Parliament of England, which did neither decern nor set forward a
War against us, And that Prevalent faction of Prelates and Papists who have
moved every stone against us, and used all sorts of means not only their
counsels, Subsidies and forces, but their Kirk Canons, and prayers for our
utter Ruin, which makes them obnoxious to our just accusations, and guilty of
all the losses, and wrongs, which this time past we have sustained: Yet this
we desire your Lordships to consider, That the Estates of the Kingdom of
Scotland being assembled, did endeavor by their Declarations, Informations,
and Remonstrances, and by the proceedings of their Commissioners, to make
known unto the Counsel, Kingdom, and Parliament of England, and to forewarne
them of the mischief intended against both Kingdoms, in their Religion, and
Liberties, by the Prelates, and Papists, to the end, that our Invasion from
England might have bin prevented, if by the Prevalencie of the faction it had
been possible. And therefore we may now with the greater reason, and
confidence press our Demand, That your Lordps, the Parliament, the Kingdom,
and the King himself may see us repared in our losses at the cost of that
faction by whose means we have sustained so much damage, And which, except
they repent, will find sorrow recompensed for our grief, Torments for our
toil, and an infinite greater loss for the Temporal losses, they have
brought upon a whole Kingdom, which was dwelling by them in Peace.

All the devices and doings of our common enemies were to bear down the Truth
of Religion, and the just liberties of the Subjects in both Kingdoms. They
were confident to bring this about one of two ways: Either by blocking us up
by Sea and Land to constrain us to admit their will for a Law both in Kirck,
and policy, and thus to make us a Precedent for the like misery in England, or
by their Invasion of our Kingdom to compel us furiously, and without order,
to break into England, that the two Nations once entered in a bloody War,
they might fish in our trouble Waters, and catch their desired Prey. But as we
declared before our coming: We trusted that God would turn their Wisdom
into foolishness, and bring their devices upon their own Pates, by our
Intentions, and Resolutions to come into England as among our Brethren, in the
most peaceable way that could stand with our safety, in respect of our common
Enemies, to present our Petitions for settling our peace, by a Parliament in
England, wherein the Intentions and Actions, both of our Adversaries, and ours
might be brought to light, The Kings Majesty, and the Kingdom rightly
informed, The Authors, and Instruments of our divisions, and troubles punished,
All the mischiefs of a National, and doubtful War prevented, and Religion,
and Liberty with greater Peace, and Amity then ever before established, against
all the Craft and violence of our enemies. This was our Declaration before we
set our foot into England, from which our deportments since have not varied.
And it has bin the Lords wonderful doing, by the wise Counsels, and just
proceedings of the Parliament, to bring it in a great part to pass, and to
give us lively hopes of a happy Conclusion: And therefore we will never doubt,
but that the Parliament in their Wisdom and Justice, will provide that a
proportionable part of the Cost, and charges of a work so great and so
comfortable to both Nations be borne by the Delinquents there, that with the
better Conscience the good People of England may sit under their own Vines,
and Figtrees, Refreshing themselves, although upon our greater Pains and
Hazard, yet not altogether upon our cost and charges, which we are not able to
bear.

The Kingdom of England does know and confess, that the Innovation of
Religion and Liberties in Scotland, were not the principal design of our
common Enemies, but that both in the Intention of the Workers, whole zeal was
hottest for settling their devices at home: And in the Condition of the Work,
making us whom they conceived to be the weaker for opposition, to be nothing
else but a leading case for England. And that although by the power of GOD,
which is made perfect in weakness, they have found amongst us greater
resistance, then they did fear, or either they or our selves could have
apprehended; Yet, as it has been the will of God that we should endure the
heat of the day; So in the Evening the precious wages of the vindication of
Religion, Liberties, and Laws, are to be received by both Kingdoms, and will
enrich we hope to our unspeakable Joy, the present Age, and the Posterity with
Blessings that can not be valued, and which the good People of England esteem
more then Treasures of Gold, and willingly would have purchased with many
thousands. We do not plead that Conscience, and Piety have moved some men to
serve GOD upon their own cost, and that Justice, and Equity have directed
others, where the Harvest has been common to consider the pains of laboring,
and the charges of the Sowing, yet this much may we say, that had a foreign
Enemy, intending to reduce the whole Island into Popery, made the first assault
upon our weakness, We nothing doubt, but the Kingdom of England, from their
desire to preserve their Religion, and Liberties, would have found the way to
bear with us the expense of our resistance, and lawful defense, how much more
being Invaded, although not by England, yet from England, by common Enemies,
seeking the same ends, we expect to be helped and relieved.

We will never conceive that it is either the will, or the well and honor of
England, that we should go from so blessed a work after so many grievous
sufferings, bearing on our backs the insupportable burdens of worldly
necessities, and distresses, return to our country empty, and exhausted, in
which the people of all Ranks, Sexes, and conditions have spent themselves,
The possessions of every man, who devoted himself heartily to this cause, are
burdened, not only with his own Personal, and particular expense, but with
the public, and common charges; Of which if there be no relief, neither can
our Kingdom have Peace at home, nor any more credit for Commerce abroad: Nor
will it be possible for us, either to aid, and assist our friends, or to
resist, and oppose the restless, and working wickedness of our Enemies: The
best sort will lose much of the sweetness of the enjoying of their Religion,
and Liberties, and others will run such ways, and undirect courses, as their
desperate necessities will drive them into. We shall be but a burden to our
selves, a vexation unto others, of whose strength we desire to be a
considerable part, and a fit subject for our enemies to work upon for
obtaining, their now disappointed, but never dying desires.

We will not allege the example of other Kingdoms, where the losses of
necessary and just defense had been repaired by the other party, Nor will we
remember what help we have made according to our abilities, to other reformed
Kirks, And what the Kingdom of England of old, and of late has done to
Germany, France, and Holland, Nor do we use so many words, that England may be
burdened, and we eased, or that this should be a matter of our Covetousness,
and not of their Justice, and kindness; Justice, in respect of our
adversaries) who are the causes of the great misery and necessity, to which we
have been brought: kindness, in the supply of our wants, who have been
tender of the welfare of England as of our own, that by this equality and
mutual respect, both Nations may be supported in such strength, and
sufficiency, that we may be the more serviceable to his Majesty, and abound
in every good work, both toward one another, and for the comfort and relief
of the reformed Kirks, beyond the Seas, that we may all bless God, and that
the blessing of God may be upon us all.

The English Peers demand concerning the Preceding Article.
Whether this be a positive demand, or only an Intimation of the charge,
thereby to induce the Kingdom of England, to take your distressed estate into
consideration, and to afford you some friendly assistance.

The Scottish Commissioners answer to this Demand.
We would be no less willing to bear our Iosses if we had ability, then we
have been ready to undergo the hazard; But because the burden of the whole
does far exceed our strength, We have (as is more fully conceived in our
Papers) represented to your Lordships, our charges, and losses, not intending
to demand a total Reparation, but of such a proportionable part, as that we
may in some measure bear the remanent, which we conceive, your Lordships
(having considered our reasons) will judge to be a matter, not of our
Covetousness, but of the said Justice, and kindness of the Kingdom of
England.

Proposition of the Peers to proceed to the other Demands during the debate of
the Scottish losses.
That in the Interim whilst the houses of Parliament take into consideration,
your demand of losses, and damages, you proceed to settle the other Articles
of the Peace, and Intercourse betwixt the two Kingdoms.

Answer to the Peers Demand.
We have represented our losses, and thereby distressed Condition ingenuously,
and in the singleness of our hearts, with very great moderation, passing over
many things, which to us are great Burdens, That there might be no difficulty,
nor cause of delay on our part, hoping that the Honorable houses of
Parliament, would thereby be moved at their first Conveniencie to take the
matter to their consideration.

We do not demand a total Reparation, Nor do we speak of the payment, till
we consult about the settling of a solid peace, at which time the ways of
lifting, and paying the money, may be considered; We do only desire to know
what proportion may be expected. That this being once determined, and all
impediments, arising from our bypast troubles, removed, We may with the
greater confidence, and more hearty consent on both sides proceed to the
establishing of a firm and durable peace for time to come.

It is not unknown to your Lordships, what desperate desires, and miserable
hopes our Adversaries have conceived of a breach upon this Article; And we do
foresee, what snares to us, and difficulties to your Lordships may arise upon
the postponing and laying aside of this Article to the last place.

And therefore that our Adversaries may be out of hope, and we out of fear,
and that the settling of Peace may be the more easy: We are the more earnest,
that, as the former Articles have bin, so this may be upon greater reasons
considered in its own place, and order.

Your Lordships upon the occasion of some motions made heretofore of the
transposing of our Demands, do know, that not only the substance, but the
order of the propounding of them, is contained in our Instructions. And as we
can alter nothing without warrant, the craving whereof will take more time then
the Houses of Parliament will bestow upon the consideration of this Article, So
are we acquainted with the reasons yet standing in force, which moved the
ordering of this Demand. And therefore let us still be earnest with your
Lordships, that there be no halting here, where the Adversaries did most, and
we did least of all, by reason of the Justice, and kindness of the houses of
Parliament expect it.

Answer of the Parliament to the preceding Demand. Resolved upon the Question.
That this House think fit, that a friendly assistance and relief shall be
given toward supply of the losses, and necessities of the Scots, And that in
due time this House will take into consideration the measure and manner of it.

The Scottish Commissioners Answer.
As we do with all thankfulness receive the friendly, and kind reosolution
of the Parliament concerning our sixth demand, And do therein acknowledge your
Lordships noble dealing, for which we may assure that the whole Kingdom of
Scotland will at all occasions express themselves in all respect, and
kindness, So do we entreat your Lops. to represent to the Parliament our
earnest desire, that they may be pleased, how soon their conveniencie may
serve, to consider of the proportion, wishing still, that as we expect from our
friends the Testimonies of their kindness and friendly assistance, So the
justice of the Parliament may be declared, in making the burden more sensible
to the Prelates, and Papists (our enemies, and Authors of all our evils) then to
others, who never have wronged us; Which will not only give unto us, and the
whole Kingdom of Scotland, the greater satisfaction, But will also (as we do
conceive) conduce much to the honor of the Kings Majesty and Parliament. We
do also expect that your Lordships will be pleased to report unto us the
Answer of the Parliament, that we may in this, as in our former Articles, give
account to those who sent us.

The Peers Demand upon the above written Answer.
We desire to understand, since, (as we conceive) the particulars are like to
require much time, whether we may not from you let the Parliament know, That
(whilst they are debating of the Proportion, and the ways how their kind
assistance may be raised) you will proceed to the agreeing of the Articles of a
firm and durable Peace, that thereby both Time may be saved, and both sides
proceed mutually with the greater cheerfulness and alacrity.

The Scottish Commissioners Answer to the preceding Demand.
As we desire a firm Peace, so it is our desire that this peace may be with
all mutual alacrity speedily concluded. Therefore let us entreat your
Lordships, to show the Parliament from us, that how soon they shall be
pleased to make the proportion known to us, that we may satisfy the
expectation of those, who have entrusted us, (which we conceive may be done in
a short time, since they are already acquainted with all the particulars of our
Demand,) we shall stay no longer upon the manner and ways of raising the
assistance, which may require a longer time: And yet we trust will be with such
conveniencie determined, as may serve for ourtimous relief, But remitting the
manner and ways to the opportunities of the Parliament, shall most willingly
proceed to the Consideration of the following Articles, Especially to that
which we most of all desire, a firm and blessed peace.
