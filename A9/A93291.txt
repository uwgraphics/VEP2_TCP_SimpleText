SIR JOHN PRESBYTER Not Dead.

As the malicious Author of that abusive Pamphlet, that nine-dayes-wonder
lately Printed, entitled,

The Last Will and testament of Sir John Presbyter, divulged.

But was only bereft of his soul for a few days, and is now again revived.

The wondrous things he saw, during his confinement to the lower parts.

What Committee Men, Commanders, and Ministers, he saw there grievously
tormented.

Faithfully taken from his own mouth.

Read and Wonder.

Sir JOHN PRESBYTER not Dead.
ALas, alas, Independents, and am I again revived; I live again, and shall
do so, till I behold the Babel you have builded, demolished by your selves,
and your Anarchy be reduced to Monarchy: The hyreling you employed to publish
my Death, is since dead himself; alas the fellow was smitten with the horror
of his crime, and not able to endure the thoughts Pluto continually suggested;
he, like one weary of his Fetters, leaping out at the prison window, breaks
his limbs, gave up the Ghost. My sweet friends, I have the coldest comfort for
you, that your greatest enemies can wish, during my confinement to the shades
below, for to me it was permitted, as once to the righteous Lazarus, to take a
view of things there done, and thence once more to visit the Earth.

I saw near the Lake called Phlegeton, an infinite number of Royallists, alias
Episcoparians, Romish Catholics, Pimps, Panders and Parricides, kneeling
before the brazen Gates of Plute's Palace, all with heaved up hands, invoking
the Prince of hell, to further their design with his utmost aid, to send his
spirits abroad to seduce the souls of men, that they might be persuaded, to
create a hell on earth, (if it might be) to set up confusion, and countenance
utter desolation, to wit, Independencie, for which immunities, if it took
effect, they jointly swore by the river Stix, to stuff hell with more souls,
then the said river harbored Serpents, and with themselves, to draw the world
after them to destruction: The principal sticklers in this business, my thoughts
persuaded me represented the persons of a famous Apostate, now a house
preacher, alias Tubist in Bell-Alley; and of another Apostle of the new
Edition, a seducer, who daily gives destruction, I mean instruction, near
Finsbury; I had a sight of Saltmarsh, but he as a shadow flying away, fled from
me; there were diverse others, which for brevity I shall omit, who were
uncessantly urgent on Lucifer, to lend them his aid, when Goodwin was allotted
by the whole multitude to speak in the name of them all, who said:

Thou know great Prince, how I with these my Brethren, have for many years
opposed even the high Court of Parliament, assembled in the chief City of
England, to abolish Episcopacy, and set up Presbytery, has bin their chief
aim, and yet by us have hitherto bin continually thwarted in their sayings,
opposed in their actions, and frustrated of their desires, I am sure thou can
not forget, how we have hitherto used al means, and devised all ways to raise
discords and divisions, which we know in the end cannot but prove the
dissolution of Monarchy, and so consequently, the corner stone of Anarchy; to
attain which our desires, we have hired our dear Brother, and indeed, ours
and thine own Prop, John Lilburne, to persuade the people, that even their
Lord K. Charles is now captive under their sovereign power; that he be
forthwith Articled against, Impeached, Regal Tyranny, page 14 ^6.53.
Arraigned, Deposed, Executed, and his Posterity disinherited by the
Parliament; that the Assembly of Divines be immediately dissolved, and
impeached of high Treason, Presbyteries suppressed, the Directorie, National
League, Parishes, Parish Church, Chapels, Tithes, Oblations, Ministers by
Ordination, Universities, and all Schools, except only such as teach English,
Write, and Cipher; all set forms of Prayer, the Lords Prayer, Creed, and Ten
Commandments, Baptizing of Infants, and singing of Psalms, utterly abolished:
Therefore, on our part, great Prince, thou may guess, that there has not,
nor now is, any thing wanting that may further our Design, but only thy
present Aid, in an especial manner, now in the nick of time we implore; for
now, to our unspeak^b^e grief, there is like to be a free and full Parliament,
who have already Voted the Man whom we so extremely hate (the King) to Lond^n,
there to remain with honor and safety: therefore, great Sir, as you tender
the enlargement of your Territories, the Command of Souls, and the ruin of
Mankind, devise some speedy remedy, that Independencie may be tolerated, his
Majesty prohibited from coming to London, this Parliament dissolved, and our
Anaschy introduced; and this as you tender your own honor and our safety.

This Speech was approved of by the whole multitude, who expressed their liking
by a general shout; but what answer Pluto returned, I cannot relate, for I was
transported with a desire to pry yet further into the secrets of that tenebrous
place; so passing on from thence, I came into a large Plain, where fire
continually ran along upon the ground, where were many men tormented with
sundry torments; there I s^w a company of Furies, who were busily employed in
preparing Wracks, Gibbets, and other various instruments of torture; upon a
Gridiron I beheld one lie, whom at the sight I took to be Quaterman, but
viewing him better, I found I was deceived, for it was Wansworth the
Committeeman, who gathered together the wealth of a whole County, pretending
for the public use, and then ran away over Sea: Near him I beheld swimming in
a Lake of Sulphur, Townsen, whom once the Parliament of England so much
confided in, and now so well know his falsenesse, who after he had cheated
both the public wealth and the whole Parish wherein he lived, being by them
complained against and prosecuted, fled into the North part of England, and
turned Minister; Ah Townsen, said I, thou never were in such a Tub before; and
were all house-preachers allowed no better a Pulpit, they would have little joy
to expound: Near these I beheld thrust through with swords of fire, diverse
Commanders, that through fear or falsenesse lately deserted the Army; Pluto
had an it tention to make them of his own guard, for there he feared not their
fl^eting* and there they might without scruple, be as they would themselves, the
more baser, the more better; near these locked in iron collers, glowing hot, I
saw one Levite, whom by my guess I took to be the Author of Hagio Mastix, he
much repented he left Coleman-street for Bell-Alley, and earth for hell; the
thought of the days he once enjoyed, when his Audience gathered him for one
Sermon 20. l. doubly augmented his torments: Near him in the same posture, lay
the simple author of Simplicities Defense, wall-ey'd Gorton, who wanting money
in old England, would needs be hired to go over into New England, to convert
the Infidels, and after returned a perfect pagan, and engrossed an Audience to
himself, and they forsooth were Gortons Congregation, the fat fool howled
like a Lybian Lion taken in the Hunters toil; and therefore Photo commanded his
throat to be filled with moken Lead, to stop the passage of his cries; for he,
as he did on earth, sought to disturb all Hell: But by this my time limited,
was expired, and my soul returned to my body, and coming on earth, and
passing to Westminster Hall, I heard a fellow sing this Ballad, called,

What if the King, etc. Or, The Armyhath helped us.
WHen as great matters were seemingly handling,
yet order and Discipline pulled to the ground,
And base Hypocrisy Rebellion dandling,
fools walking at large, wise men in the Pound;
Lo a hand was put forth,
For to save those of worth,
Hell shreikt,
Knaves squeakt,
Fearing to fall.
When most men feared their meat would but bane them,
and their own hands would wound them to death,
When as the Trustees in a net had taken them,
and those sought their ruin to whom they gave breath,
Then at that time when succor was scant,
He that they relied on,
Those they did confide on,
Failed them,
Assailed them,
The truth for to try.
And non the Committee-mens arses make buttons,
and the Excise-men begin for to hide,
The City Churles, and paunch-belly'd Sluttons,
begin for to pause where they may abide,
Free from the ills that may on them fall;
The Tub-men grow hoarse,
And forget to discourse,
The Sisters are silent, and wished
They never
While e're
Had preached at all.
Time-serving Priests that in Pulpits reviled,
and dare to abuse their Sovereign Lord,
Now with themselves t^ him reconciled,
altring their Orisons with one accord,
Cheap-side-Crosse was seen,
When before it had been,
Charing-Crosse was in hope,
Without leave of the Pope,
For to be new erected,
Most men,
Hoped then,
To have the old way again.
Finis.
