COR VNVM VIA VNA

TO MY CHRISTIAN FRINDS IN NORWICH, and thereabouts, Grace, and salvation from
the God and giver thereof.
THat loving and thankful remembrance, in which I always have you (my
Christian friends) provokes me as continually to commend unto God your
welfare, so to rejoice greatly when I understand thereof, and specially that
your souls do prosper. And as the prosperity of the soul is principally
furthered by the zealous preaching of the Gospel, so has it been matter of
unfeigned rejoicing unto me, to hear ^ow God has of late stirred up amongst
you, diverse ^nstruments, whose zealous endeavors he has used that way, and
covering in mercy what is evil (of ignorance and infirmity on their parts (I
hope) i^ their entrance and ministrations, does bless what ^ of himself* to
the good of his chosen. But as it fal^ leth out in nature, that the pure waters
draw of the tainture of the soil through which they run; s^ with you it seems,
the pure truths of the Gospel have suffered by some, too great mixture with
sundr^ Popish errors about the Church and ministry, i^ and by which they are
Propounded* and this more especially by M. Yat^s, a man of good gifts i^
himself, and note amongst you, pleading the caus^ of the whore of Babylon, the
Church of Rome, a Christ's wife, and of Antichrists clergy, as of Christ
ministry. And as this clergies exaltation is not little furthered by
usurpation on the peoples liberty which it swalloweth up, and thereby swells
above proportion: so in all his pleading for the one, he dot^ necessarily
implead the other; and as in other things so specially in the exercise of
Prophecy, or teachin^ in the Church by an ordinary gift, in which every on^
that is able brings his shot in due time and orde^ for a joint feast of that
heavenly repast, the word o^ God. The argument in his writing (sent unt^ me by
W. E. with his consent, and that before the Majestrate) I have set down word
for word and answered: and therewith confirmed what I have In t^^ Justification
of Separation published, in justification of this exercise against his
exceptions and answers which being scattered here and there in his large
discourse, and diverse of them diverse times repeated, I have collected,
contracted, and set in orderly opposition to their contrary Arguments: and that
without any the least wrong (to my knowledge) unto him or his cause: as having
left out nothing in his writing, which might seem to bring advantage to his
purpose.

Now if any shall ask me, why I have not rather answered M. Hall his large and
learned volume against me, and the general cause which I profess. My reasons
are, first, because it is a large volume so full farced by him, as it seems he
might prevent further answer. Secondly his Treatise is as much (and more
imediatly) against the Reformists, and their cause in the maine, as against us
and ours. Thirdly, the truth requires not that persons, but things be answered
in my defense against Master Bernard. Lastly, I do put as great difference
between him and M. Yates, as between a word-wise Orator, both laboring more,
and being better able to feed his Reader with the leaves of words, and flowers
of Rhetoric, then with the fruits of knowledge, as also striving rather to
oppress the person of his adversary with false and proud reproaches, then to
convince his Tenet by sound Arguments: and between a man sincerely zealous for
the truth, and by his simple and solid dealing by the Scriptures, as M. Yates
does giving testimony of his unfeigned love thereof, which truth, my prayer to
God is, that he with my self, and all other so seeking it, may find and
therein accord in all things.

And for you (my Christian friends) toward whom for your persons, I am minded
even as when I lived with you, be you admonished by me (which I also entreat at
the hands of the Lord on your behalf) that you carefully beware, lest in any
thing you fall from your steadfastness: but, on the contrary, grow in grace,
and in the knowledge and obedience of the Lord Jesus in his whole revealed
will. And let me the more earnestly exhort you hereunto, by how much the
contrary evil is the more dangerous and common. A man may fall forward, and in
so doing endanger his hands and face: but in falling backward the danger is
far greater, as we see in old Eli, of whom we read, that he fell backward,
and his neck brake and he died, 1 Samuel 4. 18. And how common a thing is it for
men amongst you, and the whole land through, in their declining age, to decline
in grace, woeful experience teaches: there being few old disciples to be
found, who in their age do hold the same temper of zeal and goodness which
they had upon them in their younger times: this being one maine reason thereof
that the means amongst you are far more for convertion then preservation:
and for birth, then nourishment: Whereas they (by the Lords gracious
dispensation in the orderly state of things) who are Planted in the house of
the Lord, in the Court of our God, shall flourish, yea shall sprout in old
age* ^^d are fat and green, to show that the Lord is just, and with him is
none unrighteousness. Psalm. 92. Of this grace he who is the Author and
finisher of our faith, make both you and us partakers always.

Amen.

AN ANSWER TO THE Arguments Laid down by M. John Yates, Preacher in Norwich,
to prove ordinary Prophecy in public, out of office unlawful: Answered by
John Robinson.
ARG. I. M. I. Yates.
FROM the Commission of Christ Ioh. 20. v. 22. 23. all Prophecy in public is
to remitt, and retain sins: and Christ grants this power to none but such as he
sends, v. 21. and ordains there unto, v. 22. But men out of office are neither
sent nor ordained thereunto, therefore in public ought not to meddle with the
power of the keys. I know the exception will be this, that many out of office
have prophesied, the Scripture approving it. I answer, An ordinary rule is
never infringed by an extraordinary example, but ever by an ordinary. To marry
my sister is incest; yet in Cain it was no incest, because the example was
extrordinary, I may not steal, and yet it was lawful for the Jews to rob the
Egiptians, because that was Gods extraordinary permission* extraordinary
exsamples, as they make no rules; so they break none: but ordinary examples,
must ever follow the rule: and if they do not, they break it, Christ
therefore laying down a perpetual rule of binding and losing to all such as
are sent and ordained either by himself immediately, or by such as he shall
point thereonto, it must necessarily follow, that any ordinary example will
break this rule if it be not framed accordingly: therefore I constantly
affirm, that no ordinary prophecy ought to be out of office. As for
extraordinary, that can not oppose this rule, because it is o^ an other nature,
and therefore is not to be limited within the compass of an ordinary rule.
Secondly, I answer, That all the prophesies out of office* were by the secret
motion of the spirit, which was warrant for all such a^ had no calling by
office thereunto.

ANSW. I. Robinson.
THat all prophecy in public (and in private also) is for the remitting and
retaning of sins. I acknowledge* but that Christ grants this power to none
but to such as he sends and ordaines by the Commission given John 20. 21, etc.
I plainly deny, and require his proof. He should then grant it to none but to
Apostles: for the commission there given, is peculiar conveyed to them
immediately from Christ, confirmed by the miraculous in breathing of the H.
Ghost and by them to be exercised and dispensed principally toward
unbeleevers; of all which nothing i^ common to ordinary officers, As Christ
then gives power of binding and loosing sins to the Apostle^ there, so else
where, to ordinary Pastors. Ephe. 4* Else where to the whole Church gathered
together in one, Mat, 15. 17. 18. 1. Cor, 5. 2, Cor. 6. 6. 7, 8 9. 10. And
Lastly in other places to every faithful brother confessing Jesus Christ, Mat,
16. 18. 19. etc. and Cap. 18. 15. Luke 17. 3. And since the power of binding
and loosing sins is only by way of manifestation, and declaration of the
word of God, the Law, and the Gospel. Look unto whom the word of God is given,
unto him the power of binding and loosing sins is given, though to be used by
diverse states of persons, after a diverse order, which order does in no sort
abolish the being of the thing, but only preserues it from confusion.

And where he takes it for granted that the examples for Prophesying out of
office in the Scriptures were extraordinary, as Cains marryng of his Sister and
the Jews (the Isralites, he should say ( stealing from the Egiptians* his
comparisons are without compass, and his affirmations without truth. These
their practices were against the light of nature, and moral law (then written
in the tables of men's hearts, and afterward written in the tables of stone)
s^ue as there was an extraordinary dispensation by the Lord of the Law, and God
of nature. But what like is there in this, that a man (out of office) having
received a gift of God, whither extraordinary, or ordinary, by which he is
enabled to prophecy, that is to speak to edification, exhortation and comfort
of the Church should so use the same good gift of God, in his time and order?
What Eclipse is here of the light of nature or violation of natural honesty?
if M. Yates had remembered the Law which forbad men to Plough with an ox and
ass together, Deu. 22. 10. he Would not thus have yoked together things of so
unlike kind*

And for the secret motion of the spirit by which in his second answer he
affirms that all prophesies out of office were, he speaks both that which
is true, and against himself. For what were these secret motions of the
spirit, but the Prophets zeal for Gods glory, and man's good, which also were
sufficient on their part, for the use of the gift whither ordinary or
extraordinary; whither in men in office or out, it was not material. So that,
for the use even of an extraordinary gift there was required (at least at all
times) no extraordinary motion of the Spirit. But only that which was, and is
ordinary to them, and us. God therefore, for his own glory, and the good of his
people giving the gift, whither extraordinary or ordinarily unto a man he has
a warrant sufficient from his zeal to Gods glory; and man's salvation, to use
the same gift in his time, place and order. Of which hereafter.

M. Yates. A. R G. ^*
FROM the execution of a public function in the Church Prophecy ordinary is by
preaching to bring the glad tidyngs of peace and good things to Gods people:
and this the Apostle says is not warrantable without sending. Romans 10. 15. We
must feed the flock because we are set over it Acts. 20. 20 to prophesy to Gods
people is an honorable calling, and none ought to take it upon him, but he
that is called of God as was Aron. Heb. 5. 4. The place of Judas is called a
Charge. Act. 1. 20. the ministers are the light of the world. Mat. 5. 14. Stars
in the right hand of Christ. Rev. 1. 20. John was a man sent from God. Ioh. 1.
6. Christ sent his Apostles in the midst of wolves. Mat. 10. 16. I have not
sent these Prophets, sayt^ the Lord, and yet they ran. Ier. 23. 2. as many as
found not their Genealogy to be from Levi (from Aaron he should say) were put
from the priesthood. Neh. 7. 64. All these places keep us to an ordinary rule*
and for all ordinary prophesying there can be no exception from it, without an
open breach thereof, as for all your places of prophesying out of office, they
are all of them to be understood of the extraordinary: which cannot be tied to
ordinary rules. For so we should abridge God of his liberty: but we must beware
of imitation, least we become licentious.

ANSWER.
HERE is a long harvest for a small croppe, All that can be gathered hence
either by reaping or gleaning is no more then that no man may exercise a
public function, or office of ministry in the Church without a lawful sending
or calling from the Lord, by the means which he has sanctified. Which as it
concerns M. Yates well to consider of, especially, reckoning (as he
professedly does) his Genealogy from the Pope of Rome: so does it not impeach
our prophets at all, who have a lawful calling for the use of their gift,
though not so solemn (neither need they) as they who are to exercise and
fulfill a constant ministry and charge. But for the word Sending, which he so
much urges, it must be known, that as all that teach lawfully, whither in
office or not, are sent by Christ in respect of their personal gifts and
graces: so ordinary officers are not sent by those, who appoint them to
minister, as were the extraordinary. Apostles sent by Christ, who appointed
them. Sending imports a passing of the sent from the sender to an other, and
so the Apostles were sent by Christ to preach the Gospel to the Jews and
Gentiles: but so are not Pastors sent by the Church (which calls them) unto
others, but by her appointed to minister to her self. They who were in their
time Apostles, afterward they might be sent to minister: they who are Pastors,
are sent by Christ, first as members, or in their persons or personal gifts,
that as pastors they may afterward be called to minister. And that M. Yates
may have for the cal^ng of our prophets, whereon to insist, thus we pra^se.
After the exercise of the public ministry ended, ^ Rulers in the Church, do
publicly exhort, and re^ire that such of their own or other Church, as have
gift to speak, to the edification of the hearers* should ^^ the same, and this
according to that which is writ^^, Act. 13. 14. etc. where Paul and Barnabas
coming into the Sinagogue, the Rulers, after the work of the ^^dinary ministry
was ended (considering them not ^ Apostles which they acknowledged not, but
one^ as men having gifts) sent unto them, that if they had a^ word of
exhortation to the People, they should say

M. Yates. ARG. 3.
From the true causes of prophesy in the new testament, ^ which are two, either
immediate revelation, or imposition ^ands: the first is Act. 2. 17. and 10. 44.
the second. Act* ^7. and 19. 6. A third cause of public prophecy connot be ^n:
therefore ordinary prophecy in public out of office being ^her by immediate
revelation, or imposition of hands, is ^^wfull, You may say the contrary, But
it will be without ^arrant of the word.

ANSWER,
^^* this Arg. are sundry errors Logical and Theo^ogicall. And first, why does
he not make Christ's a thing upon the Apostles John. 20. and the descending and
sitting of the cloven ^iery* tongu^ upon them, Act. 1. causes of prophesy as
well as imposition of hands; Secondly imposition of hands is ^^ cause at all of
prophesy, to speak properly, as M* Yates should do. (affecting the name of a
Logitian* It is no natural cause, for to imagine that men took the holy Ghost
in their hands, and reached it to others, were ridiculous: neither is it a
moral cause, ^ in which there are propounded no Arguments, a^ motives of
persuasion. It is indeed no more then sign denoting the person; not a cause
effecting t^ thing. Thirdly, if it were a cause, yet should it n^ be made the
member of a division opposed to rev^lation, but a cause or means subordinate
unto it ^ unto the end: since it served to the conveing of t^ spirit, by which
spirit all revelation is, and by reue^tion all prophesy: extraordinary by
immediate reue^tion, ordinary by mediate: both which they were ^ the Church, as
is the latter now even in men out ^ office, by means of their study, and Gods
bless^ upon the same: else could there never be lawful ^fice, Pastor or
Teacher chosen in the Church to ^ worlds end. The gift of prophesy comes not by
^ office, But being found in persons before, man them capable of the office by
due means.

ARG. 4. M. Yates.
FROM distinction of spiritual gifts, 1. Cor. 1^. 4. ^. verse gifts,
administrations and operations. All these be referred to that general verse. 1.
Gifts therefore in this ^ce must be but one kind of spiritual gifts, and be
distin^ished from the other two. The first then are merely gifts: ^ second,
gifts and offices together, the third, rather the ^ect of a gift then the gift
it self: and therefore the Holy ^ost knowing how to speak aptly, gives more
to the effect, ^en the cause: the work then the worker for in truth mi^ulous
works exceed all the virtue that possibly can be ^agined to be in a mere
creature: and therefore it is only a ^^^e belief, or faith whereby man is
rather a patient, ^n an agent in the work. These 3. general heads are de^ed
again, or rather exemplified by many perticulars: first, ^se 8. 9. 10. all lay
down a kind of spiritual gifts, first a ^rd of wisdom, 2. a word of
knowledge, 3. of miraculous ^^th, 4. of healing. 5. operations of great works
6. pro^^ying, 7. descerning of spirits, 8. of tongues, 9. of inter^tation. That
some of these gifts are extraordinary no wise ^n will deny, yet that I may
prove them all extraordinary, ^sider 3 things, First, the cause: secondly the
effect: thirdly, ^ subject. The cause without all doubt is the spirit* yet
que^n may be of the manner, and measure. For manner, whether ^ spirit alone or
the spirit assisting our industry, and pains I ^ alone, because all these
effects depend equally upon the same ^se: and I have no reason to say, that
prophesy should be ^re by my pains and industery, then strange tongues, or any
^er gift: for then I should magnify* the Holy Ghost in one ^ more then an
other. That which is given by the sole op^^ion of the spirit is more then that
which is come by, through ^^nary pains. I bless God ^or his ordinary
providence ^ere my hand goes with the Lord in my ordinary affairs: ^t wherein
I find the Lord do for me where I had no hand ^re I ought to magnify him
much more: so in these gifts, if some were ordinary, some extraordinary, then
the spirit sho^ not have equal praise in them all* The orator proving C^ to
deserve more praise for his clemency toward Marcellus t^ all his famous
victories, uses the manner of the cause to show ^ In thy wars, O Emperor,
thou had Captains, and so^diers, virtue and valor: weapons and munition,
etc, But s^ring Marcellus thou alone did it, to thee alone it belongs ^ all
the glory of it: so if prophesy in this place above all the ^ must come in for
an ordinary gift, then may I say, O bles^ spirit, Prophesy is thy gift: yet do
I acknowledge thy ordi^ blessing upon my labors in this: but as for strange
tongu^ and the rest, I acknowledge they are thy mere gift, with all pain, and
labor of mine, therefore the greater praise I g^ thee, Were not this to
deminish prophesy in regard of the ^ which the H. Ghost prefers before them
all; and therefore ^ show as great power in that gift as in any other* The man^
then being all one in giving, the second question is whit^ they were given in
the same measure. I answer, No, Ro^ 12. 6. and hereupon the Apostle commanded*
that one p^phet should be subject to an other, and willingly yield place ^ him,
that had the greater measure. I leave the cause, ^ come to the effects, which
learned men cannot distinguis^ will show you my judgment and follow it as you
please, To ^ two first gifts is given a word: by words we express our
m^nings, therefore the spirit must not only give a gift, but a^bility and
power ^o utter that gift for the greatest good of ^ hearers. Brother it is the
part of a divine, to study for ^ and fit words; and indeed when God has given
us learn^ by exceeding great pains, yet we find great imperfection ^ant of
words. Now here I learn that the spirit of God did ^traordinarily supply this
want, by giving unto men excellent ^terance of heavenly things. The first two
gifts are wisdom ^ knowledge, wisdom is a holy understanding of heavenly the
^ith aprudent application of them to their several uses* Knowledge, or science
is an insight into diverse heavenly truth^ ^t wanting that prudent application:
these two gifts with a ^uitfull utterance of them could be no ordinary gifts
studied ^t by their own pains, but such as the H. Ghost does imme^iately
inspire into them. I should ^e very glad to hear that ^ur Congregations were
full of these wise and understanding ^en, then I doubt not but you would the
sooner recall your ^l^es. The three next gifts, of faith* healing, and great
^orkes are undoubtedly extraordinary, and were never to be ^^tained, by any
study of ours. For the four last I doubt not ^^t you will grant three of them
extraordinary. Discerning of ^^irits was not by ordinary means but
extraordinary, as you ^ay see in Ananias and Saphira, Simon Magus, and others,
which were seen by an extraordinary Spirit. For strange ^ngues. I hope you
will not stand in granting it, if you consi^^r but the first original of them
Act. 2. and for interpreta^^on of these tongues that was as difficult as the
other: why ^ould you now stick at prophesy, which I will plainly show ^as more
difficult then both the rest. For how should either ^^ or I come to* be able to
prophesy, except there were some ^ilfull in the original tongues as likewise
the helps of com^entaries. and interpretations; You see God appointed these ^
means to help us to prophecy: and where they are wan^ng, it is simply
impossible for any man to become an ordinary ^rophet: Indeed the H. Ghost can
supply the want of both ^ese: and therefore will you, ^^ll you, it must be
granted that ^is prophesy was extraordinary For take away the ordinary ^eanes
of prophecy and then the thing it self will cease. now ^^ may plainly
understand that the Primitive Church had ^t these means of prophecy, that you
see we have: they had ^t the original tongues translated, and therefore God
gave ^en extraordinary gifts in speaking, and interpreting them* see then I
entreat you how these two means being extraordinary enforce you to yield the
other of the same nature. Were i^ possible for you to become a Prophet wanting
the translation o^ the, new and old Testament as likewise all interpretation; ^
with which now through Gods blessing the whole world is r^pl^mshed; I know you
will answer, and say no: then Prophecy in the Prunitive Church was
extraordinary because the Gentiles had not ordinary translations and
interpretations of them.

ANSWER.
IF I should follow M. Yates in his course I should rather write one Sermon
against another then bring an Answer to an Argument, briefly then, as I can,
omitting other things to that which concerns directly our present purpose. His
affirmation that the gifts mentioned 1 Cor. 12. are only extraordinary, I do^
deny: and answer his reasons as follows. And first that (contrary to his
unreasonable reason) we both may and ought to magnify the H. Ghost more in one
gift then another: since the same Holy Ghost works more excellently and for
our good in one gift, then in another: And secondly (as a further truth and
more contrary to his strange assertion) that in some works of the Spirit,
though not here expressed, in which the Lord uses our industry and care, he is
infinitely more to ^e magnified, then in any whatsoever the immediate and
miraculou^ work of the same spirit, wherein ^e uses it not. For example, in
^^^^ng says and repentance: for the working of which by his spirit, God uses
our careful hearing and meditation of his word, the Law and Gospel, Thirdly,
compare we even extraordinary gifts with extraordinary: we see, that God used
the industry, and pains of the extraordiry Prophets for the reading and
meditating in, and of the Law, Dan. 9. ^3 v. 2. and of the latter Prophets, of
the former Prophets writings, As also of the Apostles in the reading,
knowledge, and memory of them both, Romans 4. 10. and 4. 3. etc. ^ea even of the
very heathen authors* whose sayings they sometime quote in their prophe^^es or
sermons, Act. 17. 28. 1 Cor* 15. 33. T^. 1. ^2. 2. ^^m. 4. 13. ^he like
industry, or care not being required for the ^ift? or use of strange tongues:
and yet did the Holy Ghost much more excellently utter it self in their
Prophesies, and sermons then in there tongues a^ M. Yates often. and truly
assumeth.

Upon verse. 8 be rightly describes wisdom a holy ^nderstanding of heavenly
things with a prudent appli^ation of them to their several uses: and
knowledge, (...) ^sight into diverse heavenly things, yet wanting that pru^ ^ent
applycation, with the fruitful utterance of them* ^ut that these could be no
ordinary gifts studied out by ^eir own pains, but such ^^ the Holy Ghost did
immediately conspire into them, he barely affirms; and think, singularly;
but am sure untruly I marveiled that he would say to these two gifts of wisdom
and knowledge to prove that they could not be ord^nary: and did expect some
special reasons for his ^ singular interpretation: but behold a bare bone ^
^ffirmation brought by him with out marrow, fles^ skin, or color of proof.
Wherein he is also t^^ more blameworthy, considering that be cannot b^
ignorant, how the most judicious both at home, an^ abroad, do understand th^se
two gifts as meant ^ the two speaciall qualifications of the Pastor, an^
Teachers; ordinary gifts of ordinary offices: of whi^ ministeries amongst the
r^st ordained by Christ t^^ one Lord of his Church* the Apostle speaks ver^
5. as verse. 4. of their gifts, by that one spirit Which ordinary gifts all
lawful pastors and Teachers (ordinary offices) then had, and beside them, many
others not in office; and by the gra^ of God, some amongst us: and that by the
help ^ nature study and prayer, and the blessing of God^ spirit thereupon.
Which blessing of God I will n^ deny to have then been for degree extraordina^
upon men's weaker indevours, for their furnishi^^ with these ordinary gifts:
which makes nothing against our purpose. That the gife of faith is undoubte^
extraordinary is said by him but Doctors have doub^ed of it. See for one, Beza
in his great Annotati^ upon the words, both affirming, and proueing the by
faith is meant an assent unto the doctrine propou^^d which is an ordinary gift
of the spirit.

Where he makes no doubt but we will grant, that ^hree of the four last were
extraordinary, he but threaps ^indnesse upon us, as we use to say. That Peter's
gif^ ^f discerning was extraordinary in the cause of Anna^ias Act. 5. we
confess: but not so in the case of Simon Magus Acts. 8. of whom he judges by
his words (as of the tree by the fruit) in which he did ^otoriously bewray
himself to be in the gall of bit^ernesse, to the discerning of any ordinary
Christian. The gift of discerning both of doctrine and manners ^s in a measure
required of every Christian. Phil. ^. 9. 10. 1. Ioh. 4. 1. Heh. 5. 14. but is
bestowed by ^he giver thereof upon some more liberally: some^imes
extraordinarily, as then upon some in some ^ases, sometimes ordinarily, as both
then and now ^n all such as had, and have more Christian discreti^n then other
men.

That interpretation of tongues was as difficult as ^trange tongues immediately
inspired, is not true. They ^ho Acts 2. heard the Apostles speak in their own
^ongue, and were able to speak the Jews language ^hen in use, might interpret
these strange tongues unto the Jews, without any extraordinary gift: as M.
^ates hearing a glorious Formalist speak much La^ine in his Sermon, can
interpret that strange tongue of his unto the People, without any
ex-traordinary gift of interpretation: and so might it well be in the Church of
Corinth with' some, though the tongue were given extraordinarily.

Lastly, it does not show plainly, that prophecy w^ more difficult then
strange tongues, though all we^ true which he speaks of the difficulty
thereof. F^ by all reason and experience a man then might. a^ now may, become
an ordinary Prophet for abilit^ by ordinary helps; but so neither could, nor
can ^ speak a strange tongue, as there meant, but by e^traordinarie
inspiration, That simple necessity ^ Commentaries and Interpretations which he
require^ for a man's beco^ming an ordinary Prophet, I da^e n^ acknowledge: of
great use they are, but not of simp^ necessity: that prerogative Royal of
simply necessity I would challenge as peculiar to the Holy Scripturs; which are
able to make the man of God perfec^fully furnished to every good work. 2. Tim.
3. 16. 17* But where he ads, that the Primitive church had not ^^ original
tongues translated, it is something for his, ye^ and for the Popes purpose
also, if it be true, and th^^ the Church, espetially some good space, after ^^
constitution, might be without the Scriptures in known tongue. But how
unadvised, and unskilf^^ is he in so saying; how detracting from Gods gracio^
providence toward his Church: and how partia^ on the Clergies part, and
against the Commonal^ of Gods inheritance; For the thing then. The o^ Testament
was wholly translated by the 70 Interpreters, at the instance of Ptolemy
Philadelphus Ki^ of Egypt into Greek the mother tongue of the Corinthians;
Joseph Ant. l. 12. 2. Iren. l, 3. 24. 25: Corenth being in Achaia and Acha^a
in Greece: In which the same tongue they had also every part ^f the new
Testament then written, as the most was. Which language was also so universally
known ^roughout the whole world, by reason partly of the ^reeke Monarchy under
Alexander, and partly of ^e Greek learning at Athens, as that the Apostle
^ould write his Epistle in Greek to the Romans, ^^ough in Europe, as
understanding the tongue suf^ciently. Besides, the Corinthians had had Paul's
and ^ther Apostolical men's preachings, and conferen^s amongst them along time,
which were uncom^arible better then all the commentaries in the world. And for
the Corinthians ability for this work ^ is but reason we respect this Apostles
Testamony ^f them, which is, that they were enriched in all ^tterance, and in
all knowledge, 1. Corinthians. 1. 4. In which two gifts as the ability for
ordinary prophe^^ does properly consist, so to appropriate them unto
extraordinary Prophets, considering the gene^ality of the Apostles speech, and
drift, with other circumstances else where observed, were to fer^er them in
unjust bonds of restraint.

And having thus wiped off his colors of reason* that the Apostle, 1. Cor. 12.
speaks only of ex^raordinary gifts, I will (by the grace of God) plainly show
the contrary, and that he speaks of ordinary also

And first, in teaching, ver. 3. that no man can c^ Jesus the Lord, but by the
Holy Ghost, he points out gift and grace of the spirit, ordinary and common t^
all Christians.

Secondly, ver. 5. he speaks of diversities that i^ of all the diverse and
several ministeries ordinary and extraordinary in the Church under Christ the
Lord, and ver. 4. of several gifts for the same; an^ so necessarily of the
ordinary gifts for the ordinari^ ministeries, then and now.

Thirdly, from ver. 8. where mention is made o^ the word of wisdom, and the
word of knowledge, ordinary gifts of ordinary persons, both in and out of
office, now, and then

Fourthly, ver. 12. he compares the Church of Corinth to a body, having Christ
the head* and each ^^ them members for their parts, of whom one had th^^ gift,
another that, given of God, for their mutual^ good, but by them abused
otherwise: whereupon I conclude, except there were in ^orenth no ordinary gifts
in Pastors, Teachers, or others of God given and by them abused, that he speaks
not of extraordinary gifts only.

Fifthly, ver. 28. after Apostles, and Prophets, h^ mentions Teachers, which
were ordinary officers and therefore speaks of ordinary gifts and teaching*
as also Helpers and Governors, who what were they ^u^ D^^^^ns and Elders? or
take the words as they are Helps and Governments: then which, what is ^ow, or
was then more ordinary, both in respect of ^inistery and gift? Whereupon I
conclude with good assurance, that the Apostle 1. Cor. 12. treats of ^he gifts
of the spirit, both extraordinary and ordi^nry.

ARG. 5.
FRom comparison of prophecy and strange tongues which ar^ laid through all
the 1. Cor. 14. Verse. 1. prephesie is prefered before all other spiritual
gifts, which cannot be ordinary: for no ordinary and common gift is to be
preferred before all extraordinary and spiritual gifts. D^^ you will say,
though it be not more excellent, yet it is more profitable: I answer it is both
more excellent and more profitable: for the Apostle intends both extolling it
for the end, which sh^^^s how good and excellent it is, as likewise for the
use, making know the profit and benefit of it, That which is the best (...) of
our desire, must needs be the best: but of spiritual gifts, prophecy is the
best object of our desire, 1, Cor. 12. 31. Desire the best gifs, chap. 14. 1.
Co vet spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophecy, Secondly, as it is
best to our selves, so is it the best to others as may appear by the whole
chapter. Thirdly, all other gifts are given for the good of prophecy, and not
prophesy for them. As it is the best gift, so it is the most profitable, as
being especially for edification, exhortation, and comfort. But it may be you
will object; Is not an ordinary gift of prophecy better then the
extraordinary gift of tongues, or at least more profitable? I answer No: for
the tongue, Acts 2. 3. 4. were more profitable to the Church then ever was the
ordinary gift of any man: but compare ordinary with ardinarie, and
extraordinary with extraordiny and we grant prophecy the priveledge.

I. Rob, ANSWER.
TO this Argument he himself gives a sufficie^ answer in our name; only he
sets it down ^^^ thing lam^ly; where if it came in all full strength, would
easily with stand the force of his Argument For where he should say for us, if
he speak out the ordinary prophecy is more excellent then, tongu^ because
more profitable; he makes us to st^^^^^ thus, though it be no^ more excellent,
yet ^^ is more profitable: it being most plain, that the Apostle prefer
prophecy before tongues because it tends more t^ edification of the, Church
according to which respect alone we are to measure the excellency o^ Church
ordinances, and so to frame the object o^ our desire unto them. But what speak
I of more excellent, and more to edification? since the strange tongues as
there used without an interpreter, were so far from being comparible to
ordinary prophecy for any good end or used as they were on the contrary most
vain and rediculous, as appears, ver. 11* 22. 23. That then which he brings
for the commendation of tongues from Acts 2. is nothing for tongues as used in
Corenth. The former were as of simple necessity in themselves unto the
Apostles, for spreading of the Gospel unto all nations, so then ^ there
profitably used: but in Corinth ambiti^ly and profanely abused, which M. Yates
should ^e observed but has not in his comparison, Last^ ^ add as aiust answer
to whatsoever he has ob^ted, That tongues considered in themselves, how ^htly
soever used* are not comparible for use and ^or excellency unto ordinary
prophesying or prea^ng considered in it self: seeing that by it as well by
extraordinary saying faith is wrought Romans 10 ^^ich none can say of strange
Tongues in them^ves, without a strange Tongue both from truth ^d sense: no nor
of any other spiritual gift.

And as it does not appear by the Apostles pre^ring of prophecy before
tong^es, that therefore ^^ prophecy was extraordinary; so it appear un^ me
by the Corinthians preferring of tongues ^for^ it that it was but ordinary: and
therefore dis^arded by them in comparison of the extraordina^* and miraculous
gift of tongues: whereas, had it ^o been extraordinary, immediate and
miraculous ^ost like it would have carried with it the like with ^^ other, or
greater regard, in their eyes.

M. Yates. ARGVM. 6.
FROM exemplification, ver. 6. if I come unto ^ou^ and^. I hope you will grant
that the Apostle Paul had all those spiritual gifts, and therefore speaking of
s^ prophecy as he had himself, he must needs speak of ^traordinary: likewise
he had the knowledge of tong^ and yet prefers prophecy before all his
languages, thou^ he speak more then they ^^^. Now the example in ^ own person
must needs se^ for^^ he general: and therefore if in the general ^^ s^^^l^
speak of ordinary proph^sying, and in the particul^r of extraordinary, it wo^
prove idle; for an example is of the some kind w^ the general. Again in
bringing four particulers he p^ revelation first, as the caus^ of all the
rest; which show^ plainly he speaks of such prophes^e, ^^ come by revelati^ for
revelation brings ^ ^^n to knowledge, and knowled^ teaches wholesome (...), and
prophecy serves to ^ter it.

I. ROB. ANSWER.
I Do plainly deny the ground upon which ^ builds the whole weight of his
argument which ^ that the example, and the thing exemplified must ^ of the same
kind, How often does Christ exemplif^ the sufferings of his disciples by his own
suff^rings, and the sending of his Apostles by his father sending of him? were
they therefore of the same kin^ their sufferings meritorious, and their sendin^
mediatorious, because his was such? But amongst other evidences against him
(wherewith all writing^ divine, and humane are stored) see one, fitly paring^
with this in hand. The Apostle provoking the Gal^thians ^. 1 unto just
detestation of such as preached a^ther Gospel amongst them, takes an example
from ^s own preaching, ves. 8. But though we or an ^ngell, from heaven
preach, another Gospel unto you, ^n that which we have preached unto you, let
him be ac^rsed. As if he should say, I have preached unto you ^rmerly
justification by faith without the works of ^e Law of Moses: they now preach
unto you iustifi^ation by the works of the law joined with Christ, ^c. He
exemplifieth their preaching by his* were ^ey therefore of one kind both
Apostolica^ because ^auls was such? It is sufficient for an example if it ^gree
with the thing, which it is brought to exem^lifie in that for which it is
brought. And so the ^omming of Christ to judgment, is by the Apostle
^xemplified by the coming of a thief in the night. ^. Thessalonians. 5. Are therefore
their commings of the ^me kind? or is it not sufficient that being most
^ontrary in their kinds, they do yet agree in the ad^nct of suddenesse? So is
it sufficient, if Paul's ex^^aordinary Prophesying, and the Corinthians
or^inary, agree in the adiunct or effect of profitable^esse or edification,
which thing alone the Apostle ^ his exemplification has respect unto. His
obser^ation about Revelation seems true, and good in it self: but shows not
plainly that for which he brings ^, no nor has so much as a plain show for
it. For that show has it of proof that he speaks of extraordinary prophecy,
because it comes from revelation except he takes it for granted, that there is
in the Church no revelation of the spirit for teaching bu^ extraordinary, or
miraculous: which how can I gra^ or he assirme? Of this more Argum. 8.

M. Yates. ARG. 7.
FROM the fruition of spiritual gifts. 1, Cor. 14* 2. 6. has a Psalm, that
is some admirable praise o^ God, or doctrine, that is some worthy point of
instruction; or a tongue, that is, can speak mysteries with admiration, or
revelations of some secrets either for doctri^^ or prediction; lastly, or
interpretation whether of ton^ues^ doctrines, or Scripture: all these must
needs be had either by the ordinary pains of the Church, or by the
extraordinary gift of the spirit, you say by the one, and ^ by the other: and
that I agree more with the scriptu^^ then your self, consider but the
distinction ^ the gifts, and their admirable matter. A Psalm must needs
consist of meeter, which required art to compose ^^* Secondly it could not for
the matter of it, but sound forth some worthy praise of God. Do you think the
corinthian^ did study the art of music, or likewise read some admirable divine
books to find out sweet matter to make their songs of? Alas, brother, give God
the glory, it was no doubt some sudden motion of the spirit, that did inflame
the hearts of believers with some worthy matter of praising God. Doctrine, that
is laid down by our ordinary pains, is that we usualy give unto Doctors*
which after long study, and reading the Scriptures is drawn unto some
profitable heads pithily proved, and contrary errors refuted by it. I think
in Corinth there were none of these Doctors, and yet I doubt not but they were
as excellent: for such Doctors as delivered these Doctrines had them after ^
more easy manner* even the immediate work of the spirit. I hope with out any
further dispute you will yield that the having of a strange tongue was
extraordinary, a^ ^ikewise the revelation and interpretation.

I. Rob. ANSW.
NOt to meddle with his description of a Psalm* Doctrine, etc. further then
concerns our pre^ent occasion: The first, a Psalm was not so undoubt^dly, as
he makes it some sudden to wit, extraordi^ary motion of the spirit etc. The
scriptures rather in^inuate the contrary* and that these Psalms and spiritual
songues were also (besides Psalms of David) and those then made by
extraordinary motion (which will not deny) even ordinary and coneaved by
or^inary men and motions. Ephe. 5. 18. 19. Col. 3. ^6. Jam. 5. 13. The
scriptures are to be extended ^ largly, and to as common use, as may be,
neither* ^ any thing in them to be accounted extraodinary, save that which
cannot possibly be ordinary which these might be For the finding out of sweet
ma^ter they had admirable divine books to read, even the wonderful divine
scriptures; For music, as witho^ doubt many in that most rich and delicate
City we^ expert in it, so what reason he has to require for t^ Church singing
then in use, such study, and art, I see no^ except it be because he dwells too
near a cathedra^ Church. He may see for the plainness of singing used in
former times (and before the spouse of Chri^ the Church in all her ordinances
was by Antichri^ stripped of her homely but comely attire, and trick^ up with
his whorish ornaments) that which Aus^^ has of this matter, Confess. l. 10. c.
13.

For the second which is Doctrine, he but thinks the were no Doctors in
Corenth. But he may well change ^ thoughts, if he both consider how that Church
abou^ded (in the body of it) even to excess, in all knowled^ and utterance,
the Doctors two special faculties as ^ so how this Apostle in his Epistle: c,
12. v. 28. affirme^ expressly that God had set in the Church, amongst oth^
officers, Doctors, or Teachers, Besides that it is enoug^ for my purpose if
there were any in Corinth, thoug^ not officer able by ordinary gift to deliver
Doctri^ which (considering the fore-signified state of the church both in
respect of Paul's ministry amongst th^^ and testimony of them, being in that
City, which ^^ the chief of all Greece for government, Greece also ^ing the
fountain of learning, and eloquence) ca^ ^ot, I think, be reasonably denied.

To yield you without further dispute that Revelation ^^d interpretation were
(viz. only the immediate work ^f the spirit, were in us more courtesy then
wisdom. ^or Interpretation, I see not but, that either he him, self who speak
the tongue by an extraordinary gift ^r any other man that understood it, having
ordina^^ ability to interpret the matter delivered) both ^awfully might and in
conscience ought so to do ^xcept he would quench the spirit both in respect of
^e extraordinary gift of the tongue, and ordinary ^ift of interpretation: but
that the Pastor or Tea^her might not do this by his ordinary gift (which ^ yet
a fort strong enough to keep us from yeeld^g) were strange to imagine. Besides
let it be no^d how the Apostle v. 13. exhorts to pray for the ^ift of
Interpretation: Now how a man might pray ^r an extraordinary and miraculous
gift, which he wholly wanted, without an extraordinary motion, ^r promise, and
merely upon the Apostles exhor^ation general, I see not, but would learn of
him ^at can teach me.

M. Yates. ARG. 8.
FROM present Revelation v. 30 In the verse going before is laid down in what
order they shall prophecy even as it was before for strange tongues: yet here
is further injunction and that is of silence, if any thing ^ more weight shall
be reveiled unto another: why sho^ the other keep silence if it were known
before, that the man should speak after him; if it were ordinary prop^sying
and such as our pains, and study brought us un^ then were it fit that we
should have our liberty to go ^ and not be interrupted by another, but the
Apostle upon the Revelation to another even siting by injoynes silence ^ the
present speaker, which if his Revelation had been s^^died before could not be
any motive, or persuasion why ^ should yield to the other, that is now upon the
sudden ^ take his place: this were for one Prophet to disgrace another: but the
clear sense is to any man that will not wr^gle, that because it pleases the
spirit to inspire one sittin^ by with some more excellent matter, either in
regard ^ the same subject or some other, the Apostle enioynes ^^ence.

^. Rob. ANSW.
TO his question why the former speaker should k^^ silence if it were known
before that a second shou^ speak after him it is easily answered: that ev^^
therefore he was to keep silence, that is, to take ^ himself i^ ^^^ time, as
being to think in modest^ that the cond^its of the spirit of God did not run
i^ to his vessel alone, but that others also might recei^ ^ the fulness of the
same spirit to speake^ some ^ing further to the edification of the Church;
especially sitting down in some appointed place which it should seem verse. 36.
and Act. 13. 14. he ^at purposed to prophecy used to take: and which ^der I
think the Jews yet observe in their syna^ogues. And where he adds, that if
it were ordinary ^ophesie and such as our study brought us unto, then we^^ ^
fit we should have our liberty to go on and not to be in ^^upted by another,
which he also accounts a disgrac^g of the former; I would know of him whether
^ere not as fit, and much more, that the extraordinary ^rophets immediately
inspired by the Holy Ghost ^d who could not err, should have their liberty ^
go on uninterrupted? Is not this without all com^sse of reason, that the
extraordinary Prophet in ^i^ed, should not have as much liberty to go on
without being interrupted, as the ordinary, who ^ight Worthily deserve to be
interrupted for spea^ng untruly or impertinently? although I do not ^ink that
the Apostle requires any interruption of ^e former by the latter (which were
rude) if not ^orse) but only a convenient cessation, or place gi^ng to a
second by the first speaker, as has been ^d. Now the exception of disgrace to
the former ^ the latters speaking is well to be minded, that it ^y appear ^ow
evil customs do infect the mind ^^ godly men, so as they think it a disgrace
that on one should give place to another to speak aft^^ him further, or
otherwise then he has done. But ^ was not so from the beginning: but since
they, wh^ under Christ should be servants of the Church, have been her masters,
and have exercised this magist^riall teaching now in use, Where ordinarily one
a^ lone in a Church (diverse others in diverse places better able then he,
sitting at his feet continually t^ learn) must be heard all his life long;
thinking it ^ disgrace to have another to speak any thing furthe^ then he has
done: Which was the very di^ease i^ the Church of Corenth: wherein he that
speak fir^^ would take up all the time himself; whereas ^^ should in modesty
have conceived, that a second o^ third (especially seeming provided to speak
by seating themselves in the same place with him) mig^^ have something revealed
further, or otherwise the^ he had.

Which Revelation the Apostle does not oppo^^ to foregoing study (as M. Yates
thinks) but unto emulation and study of contradiction: teaching tha^ the
spirit alone must be heard in the Church, speaking by whose mouth soever. And,
that there is i^ the Church an ordinary spirit of revelation; beside^
comfortable experience, these places amongst many other, do clearly prove, Mat.
11. 28. and 16. 17* Ephesians. 1. 17. P^il. 3. 17.

M. Yates ARG. 9.
FRom vocation, ver. 29. 32. 37. these spiritual men are called Prophets, and
to imagine a Prophet without a calling that which the Scripture will not
endure: therefore all these ^rophets either had immediate calling from God, or
mediate ^om men; or else they took it up themselves: the two first we^ ^ant
lawful callings, but this intolerable. Numb, 11. 28. ^he servant of Moses
say^s, Forbid Eldad and Medad to pr^^esie: his reason was, because he thought
they had no calling which had bin true, if they had taken it up without
immediate ^^piration: But Moses knowing that it was from God, wish^ that the
like gift might be upon all Gods people: so that ^ose were true Prophets for
the instant by an immediate call ^m God: and the text says, They added no
further* ^^^wing ^at as the gift ceased, so did they,

I. Rob. ASWER.
^T is true, that spiritual men are called Prophets, ^ or rather Prophets,
Spiritual men: what is it the^ ^ that makes a spiritual man, but the gift of
the ^^irit? and what a prophet ordinary or extraordina^^, but the gift of
prophecy ordinary or extraordi^^ry? Whereupon it follows undeniable, that so
^any with us, or elsewhere, as have the ordinary gift ^ ability to prophecy,
are Prophets, though out of ^^fice. In this Argument he has made a snare
wherewith himself i^ taken unavoidably. Secondly, ^^ affirm that our Prophets
have a calling which have declared formerly not to make them Proph^ by
condition or estate, for that they are by the gifts, but for the use or
exercise of the same gift before bestowed upon them by the Lord, through the
labor and industry. Of Eldads and Medads pr^phesying we shall speak hereafter,
only note w^ in the mean While, how M, Yates, and rightly, proportioneth
their prophesying to their gift as w^ do also ours: according to that of the
Apostle, Ha^ing then gifts differing, according to the grace that is ^^ven to
us, whether prophecy, let us prophecy according ^ the proportion of faith, or
a ministry, let us wait on ^^ ministry, Romans 12. 6. 7. They then that have a
gif^ must prophecy according to their proportion*

M. Yates. ARG. 10.
FRom distinction, v. 37. the Apostle from the whole Ch^^turnes himself to
their Prophets, and spiritual men, she^ing plainly, that these had some
particular place abo^ the rest: and he gives them special charge to observe
the thing he writes to the Church: therefore those were in some call^^ above
others: and to imagine the contrary, is to run wide of t^ current of the whole
Scripture: to set men in public place wi^out calling, is the same with
confusion and disorder,

I. Rob. ANSW.
THis Argument is founded upon the groundless presumption with the former:
viz. that there is in the Church no lawful calling for men able to ^rophesie,
but by officing them. And for Paul's tur^ing his speech to the Prophets. ver 37.
it shows in^eed, that they were above the rest, after a sort: and so ^hey are
with us rightly preferred before others which want that endowment of the
spirit, by which ^hey are enabled to speak to the edification of the Church.

The Confirmation of the Scriptvres and reasons brought in my book to prove
public prophesying out of office by an ordinary gift.
AND before we come to examine M. Yates his Answers to the Scriptures by me
produced, I ^esire the Reader to observe with me these two ^hinges* first,
that I do not affirm in my book that all the there alleged Scriptures are
meant of or^inary but prophecy: that the same is proved by them Neither will
he (I persume) deny, but that many ^hinges are sufficiently proved from a
scripture by ^ecessary consiquence, and just proportion, besides ^he particular
properly intended in it. 2. That M. ^ates so puts the questian, as that it is
hard to say* say whether he do me or himsefe the mo^ injury: namely whether
the places prove an ord^nary gift of prophecy out of office. For, as I do not
sa^ that they prove the gift, but the use, and excerci^ of the gift bestowed by
God whether ordinary, ^ extraordinary, so neither would he have dinied (ha^ he
not leaped, before he had looked) but that other besides ministers, have an
ordinary gift of prophesy^ Where the Apostle requires of him that desires an
office of a Bishop, that he be apt to teach, 1. Tim. 3. 1. 2^ and able to
exhort with sound doctrine Tit. 1. 9. dot^ he not therein most evidently teach,
that the gift and ability to teach, preach and prophecy, not only may, but
must, both be and appear to be in the person to be called to the office of
ministry? He^ that is not a prophet, or has not the gift of prophesying or
preaching (for by his gift he is a prophet, and by the use of it he occupies
the place of a prophet) before he be appointed a Pastor, is an Idol shepherd set
up in the temple of God: neither does the office give on ^o much indeed as
increase the gift, but only gives solemn commission and charge to use it.

The first Scripture by me brought, is Numb. 11^ 29. Where Moses the man of God
wishes that the whole people of the Lord were Prophets, the Lord putting his
spirit upon them.

This place, says M. Yates in his Answer speaks; of the pouring of the Spirit
in an extraordinary manner may appear by the occasion of the speech, verse ^4.
etc. Where he also in a tedious manner (as his ^^nner is) he proves the gift
of prophesying gi^n to the 70. Elders to have been extraordinary: which as I
deny not, so neither needed he to have ^oved. But this I affirm, that hence is
proved the ^wfullnesse of ordinary prophesying out of office ^ men enabled
thereunto. And first, as Moses wi^ed that all the Lords people were Prophets,
the Lord ^ving his spirit unto them; so the minister may and ^ght to wish that
the Lord would so bless the or^^nary endeauours of his people now, by his
spirit, as ^at they all might be Prophets, that is, able for gifts ^ speak to
edification. The minister which desires ^t this, enuieth for his own, and the
Clergies sake which Moses would not that Joshua should do for ^s. Secondly
Moses makes it all one to be a ^rophet, and to have the Lord putting his
spirit vp^^ a man. Now if the Lord so giving his spirit un^^ a man, as that he
thereby be enabled extraordina^ly to prophecy, make him an extraordinary
pro^het, why should not by due proportion, such a ^ift of the Spirit given by
the Lord to a man as by which he is enabled to prophecy ordinarily, serve al^^
to make him an ordinary Prophet? and so by con^^quence, if there be amongst us
any though out of ^ffice so enabled to prophecy, or preach what hin^reth them
from being Prophets even of the Lords own making by his spirits gift, and work
upon their study, and ^ndeauours? And if they be Pr^phets then may they
Prophecy: which Moses also ^ that place insinuates: for in wishing that they
we^ all Prophets, he wishes as well the use as the posse^sion of the gift. M.
Yates may see a very learned* man Io. Wolphius in his comment* upon 2. Kin. 23.
showing by this place the liberty of private Christian^ that are able to speak
and teach not only in ordinary congregations, but even in most solemn Councel^

The next place is 2* Chron. 17. 7. where Kin^ ^^hosaphat sent his Princes to
teach in the Cities of I^d^^^ and with them the Levites, etc.

M. Yates accounts it a monstrous conceit that the princes should be public
teachers, which says he were only by their presence and authority to back the
Leuites^ adding that the traslation is mended by Iunius an^ Tremelius etc. but
if the Jews heard him (professing the knowledge of Moses and the Prophets to
speak, so they would marvel at his ignorance^ of a thing so frequent and
evident in their writings with whom it is and ever has been a received truth
that any of their wise men as they after the Scriptures math. 23. 34. 1. Cor.
1. 20. I^^. 18-18* call them, may and ought to teach in their synagogues
without respect had to office: neither does the translation of Iunius and
Tremelius by any necessity make for him: neither can it be set against me
without violence to the original: from the simplicity ^here of they do (with
due reverence unto them be spoken) seem unto me some thing to turn a^^e in
the 8 ver. Pagnine, the 70 Interpreters, Ierom ^d all our English Bibles carry
it directly to our ^se. And if the conceit be monstrous that these princes
^eached publicly, it is not bred only in my brain: ^e uery same scripture
having been alleged very ^^ely by the public Professor in the University ^
Leyden in a solemn assembly, as expressly proving ^ lawful for others then
ministers to teach publick^. And because much weight lies upon this ground
which yet he thinks very sandy^ and light, I will ^ake it clear to all
indifferent men's indgments, that ^ese Princes, and so others in Israel, and
Judah* ^^ough no Levites, nor Church officers) might law^^lly teach and preach
publicly in the Temple, ^ynagogues, and Cities.

First then, all Princes, Magistrates, Indges, ^d Governors were bound to open
expound, and ^ply the Laws by which they governed, according ^ the several
occasions offered? otherwise they ruled ^ tyranny, and appetite: which laws for all administra^ons even of the common wealth were only the written word of God:
whereupon I conclude, that if ^ open, expound, and apply the word of God, be to
^reach, and teach, they then had not only power* ^ut charge so to do.

2 It may appear what these Princes of Iekosap^ (partaking of his power) were
to do in this cause, which he himself, and other godly kings have do^ the sum
of his most pithy sermon we have record^ 2 Chronicles. 19. unto the Judges. verse. 6.
7. and unto ^ Levites verse. 9. 10. 11. as also his divine prayer ^ to God in
the public Congregation. chap 20. 5. etc. Likewise the excellent sermon of
King He^ kiah unto the Priests, and Levites, in the very Temple, 2. Chron. 29.
4. 5. etc. also of N^h^mia^ with others, teaching the people the Law of the
Lord. Neh. 10: the Kings, and Princes being as shepherds feed the people, as by
Government, so by instructi^ in the Law of their God Defend we down low^ to
the time of Christ, and we shall see this mat^ put out of al question. Do we
not read every when how that the Scribs, Pharisees, and Lawers did tea^
publicly amongst the Jews; of whom yet man were no Levites or Church
officers, but indifferen^ of any tribe, Phil. 3. 5. And if it were not the
rece^ved order in Israel of old, for men out of office ^ speak, and teach in
public, how was Jesus the ^^ of Mary admited to dispute in the Temple with ^
Doctors; Luke 2. 46. and to teach, and preach in the Synagogues so commonly as
he did; Mat. 9, 35. Luke 16. 17. and how were Paul, and Barnabas, sitting dow^
in the Sinagogues, sent unto, after the lecture of the L^ ^y the ruler, that if
they had any word of exhortation (...) people, they should say on? Act. 13. 14.
15.

But if any man shall answer, that these were ex^ordinary persons and so taught
by an extraordina^ gift, he speaks the truth, but to no purpose, For ^at was
that to the order received in the Temple, ^d Synagogues, and to the Rulers
thereof, who did ^t believe in Christ, nor acknowledge either his, his Apostles
authority; but only admitted them to the use of their gift, as they would have
done, ^d did ordinarily, any other men able to teach: as also ^ rulers of the
Synagogues of the Jews do at this ^y.

The third place is mistaken by the printer, in o^itting only one prick, which
was corrected in any Coppies, and might easily have been observed ^^ the
Reader, For Ier, 50. 45. it should be Ier., 50 ^ 5. M. Yates. therefore upon
this Scripture refutes ^s owe guess, and not my proof.

The fourth place is Math. 10. 1. 5. 6. where christ calling unto him his 12
Disciples sends them to ^each the Kingdom of heaven to the lost sheep of
Israel. His answer is, that the 12 Apostles were called into of^ce, and had
their calling from the first election of Christ ^ut had a further confirmation
after, and greater measure ^ Gods Spirit to lead them into al truth, as a
Justice of ^ace may be put into office, and yet receive a further ^on^rmation,
yea and greater means to perform his pl^^^. ^ affirm on the other side, (and
shall, evidently (...) it God assisting me) that these 12 were not act^
possessed of their Apostleship, till after Christ's surrection but were only
Apostles elect, as you him the Major elect, who has not the office of ^jor
committed to him of a good space after. Nei^ am I herein of the mind with the
Papists (to put Yates out of fear) that Peter was not in office ^ Christ gave
him charge to feed his sheep Joh. 21, (wh^ yet I am pe^swaded never Papist held
of his Apo^ship, but of his primicy, and universal headsh^ or Bishopric) but
of the same mind, whereof h^ self is in his first argument, to wit, that his
com^sion Apostolic was actually conferred upon ^ jointly with the rest. John.
20. 22 23.

1 Now if the commission Apostolic were but t^^ given, they were but then, and
not before actually ^postles, except he will say they were Apostles, be^^ they
had commission, that is calling from Christ to be. I would now see how he can
salve ^ wound, which he has given himself.

2 After that the Lord Jesus had Mat. 11. 11. p^ferred John Baptist above all
the Prophets whi^ were before him, he yet adds in the same place the the least
in the Kingdom of heaven is greater then ^^ The least* that is the least
Minister; In the kingdom ^ heaven that is in the church of the new testament
pr^porly called, which began not till after the death ^ Christ who liu^d and
dyed a member of the Iewi^ ^urch. the Apostles then being officers of the ^urch
of the new testament, and Kingdom of hea^^, and not of the old or Jewish
Church, it cannot ^^ that they were Apostles in act, before Christ ^ath: except
an adiunct can be before the subject, ^d an officer before the corporation in
and of which is an officer.

^. Considering the ignorance of these disciples at ^^ time in the maine
mysteries of Christ: of the name of his kingdom, his death and ^e^ur^ection,
^at. 20. 21. Luke 24. 20. 21. etc. ^oh^. 20. 9. Mar. ^. 14. as also, how
utterly (...) they were gifts befitting Apost^l^cal teaching (for which) ^eing
an extraord^nary dispensotion, and that in ^ highest degree) extraord^nary, and
infallible revela and direction of the spirit was ^equisit, where with ^^y were
but first, (^s it seemet^) ^p^inckled John. ^. and afterward more plentifully
filled at the day Pentecost) they were as fit for an Apostleship as ^^vid was
for Saul's armor which he could not ^eild nor go wi^h.

4. Besides, if they had the office of Apostleship ^mmitted to them Mat. 10.
how was it that they ^ntinued not their ministration in that office; but
^^rning after a few days to their master, continu^ with him as his disciples
till his death. Christ Ie^ did not keep a company of none-residents about ^m
for his Chaplins, as M. Yates insinuates against ^^.

Lastly, we are expressly taught, Ephesians. 4. 8. 11. ^ Christ ^s^ended on high, he
gave gifts unto men* Apo^ Prophets, etc. The Apostles then were first given
^tually at the Lords ascension, and Were before o^ designed to become Apostles,
or Apostles ^lect, ^ not ordained* nor possessed of any office: and therefore
preached, and that with warrant from Chr^ without office.

The next Scripture is, Luke 8. 39. by M. Y^ thus opened: Christ having
delivered the man possess^ ^ids him go, and show what great things God had ^
for him: and it is said he went and Preached (that is ^ be to their purpose) by
ordinary pains and study, he pr^^ched the Gosple. And with pity upon us poor
so^ that cannot distinguish the publishing of amiracle, ^ the gift (he should
say the work, if he distinguish as he ought) of preaching; he adds that if
^^^ had minded to have made him a public preacher, he ^ first have taken him
with him, and instructed him, ^ then have sent him abroad.

1. Let it be observed, that the word used by M^ for his preaching, (...) is
the same word which commonly used for the most solemn preachi^ that is, by the
Apostles and Evangelists, Second^ Christ bids him, Mar. 5. 19. Go home and
declare ^ great things the Lord had done for him, and had had c^ passion on
him, and ver. 20. he is said to have publish^ in Decapolis (Luke has it, (...)
^ great things Jesus had done for him. Which he do^, what else did he, but
preach, publish and de^e the great love and mercy of God, in and by Ie^ Christ
toward miserable sinners for the curing of ^ir bodily and spiritual maladies?
3. Where he ^es the pyblishing of this miracle and the preaching of ^ Gospel
diverse things, and pitties us poo^e souls that cannot distinguish between
them: as Christ bade the ^en of Jerusalem, not to weep for him, but for them^s;
so surely had he need t^ pity not us herein, ^ himself in his so great
mistaking. Are not the ^acles of Christ storied in the Scripture a maine ^ of
the Gospel? and the publishing of them a ^ of the preaching of the Gospel? And
when M. ^s opens and publishes a miracle of Christ's (as this ^ did) does he
not as well and as truly preach the ^spel as at any other time? Let the wise
judge, ^ is to be pitied. To shut up this point, it is said ^ 20. 30. that
Jesus did many other signs, etc. and ^. 21. But these are written that ye
might believe that ^s is the Christ, the son of God, and that believing ^
might have lefe through his name. The publishing ^ of the signs and miracles
which Christ did, is the ^ching of faith in his name, to salvation: which ^ man
therefore did, espetially amongst them ^ch were not ignorant of the Law of
Moses, and ^mise of the Messiah to come: which, by his glorious miracles done
by his own power, and in his o^ name, he both declared and proved himself to
^ Joh. 5, 36 and 10. 37. 38. And where he adds, that C^ gave this man
commission to do that which he di^, but ^ mirs who gave ours such authority, I
answer even ^ same Christ, as then immediately, so now media^ by those unto
whom he has given authority u^ himself for the ordering of the gifts of his
spirit his Church. And sufficient it is for the question ^^tween him and me, if
it appear (as in this pe^ that Christ has given commission to men o^ office
by an ordinary gift, to publish and preac^ public the Gospel of salvation.

I do quote next in my book, Luke 10. ^ which for that W. E. omitteth, and
leaves out, ^ Yates thanketh God; but in truth he has more ^ to ^^anke him,
for sparing him a place which so p^nantly proves the preaching of the kingdom
of ^ by men out of office: except he can assign some ^ found office, and the
same but of two or three ^ lasting, as ver. 17. to those 70 there sent.

We are in the next place to come unto Joh. 4^ 29. 39. which he opens and
answers with a^ration, as the fo^me^ place, wit^ pity and com^sion on this
manner, ^ simplicity, with contr^tion to his own writing simplicity that
cannot see b^ preaching of the Gospel, and carrying tidings of a^ that told her
(to wit* the woman of Samaria) ^ things that ever she did, is not this (says
she) the Christ? ^t besides simplicity, here is contradiction: for says M*
^binson, and that truly, a woman is not suffered to ex^ise an ordinary gift of
prophecy in the Church; and* ^ll the women of samaria serve your turn that it
is law^^ll for men to exercise such a gift?

It is indeed my simplicity to think that the Gos^ (as the word imports) is
nothing else But glad ^dings: and that to preach the Gospel is nothing else ^t
to carry or bring glad tidings of Christ before ^omised, then come into the
world. It is also my ^plici^y to think, since by the tidings which this ^man
brought, many of the Samaritans believed on ^^ist in a measure, ver. 39 and
that without preaching ^ word of God none can believe, Romans 10. 14. 17. that
^refore she preached unto the Samaritans the same ^rd of God in a measure also,
and that as truly and ^ectually as ever M. Yates* did to his parishionners
^ugh she went not up into a pulpit as he does. And ^t he may judge aright of
this matter, let him call mind, that those Samaritans received the books
Moses as did the Jews: and as they looked for the ^essias, or Christ promised
to, and of Abraham: ^^ing themselves for the children of the Patriarks* ^ true
worshippers of God, as they had been, ver. ^ 28. and being so prepared, were
easily made as ^ions, or corn feilds white unto the Harvest, ver. 35. ^d so
this woman, by declaring unto them that, by which this Jesus, the son of
Mary, proved himself to be the Christ, or Messiah promised, preached fai^ unto
them most properly and effectually, even t^ ^aine point of ^aith then in
controversy both in ^dea and Samaria and Galil^^, and the countries the unto
ad^oyning; which was, that Jesus was the Ch^^^ I suppose M. ^^tes* has not
suffuciently thought these things, and do hope, that in godly modes^y ^ will
suffer himself to be better informed.

And for co^^radict^o^, between these 2. proposition A woman may not teach in
the Church, and A wom^ may teach out of the Church, or where no Church (as it
was in Samaria) it must be by other Logi^ then I have learned. But he will then
demand as ^ does, how this Woman's preaching can serve ^y ^^^ I answer, uery
well, by good consiquence of reas^ thus: If a woman may lawfully teach out of ^
Church to the begetting of faith as this women d^ but not in the Church,
because she is a woman ^ sex: then a man against whom that reason of restr^ of
Sex lies not, may lawfully teach both without within the Church. Of which
consiquence m^ hereafter.

Another Scripture is, Act. 8. 1. 4. with cha. 11. ^ 20 21. where it is
recorded how all the Church at ^rusalem was scattered abroad except the
Apostles, ^ that they which were scattered abroad, went every w^ preaching the
word, etc.

M. Yates answers, that besides the Apostles which ^ere in office, there were
seventy disciples, which Christ before his death had made laborers in his
harvest: and ther^re these might preach, or any other that had an extraordi^ary
gift of prophecy: the one by virtue of his office and gift ^gether, the other
by commission from the Holy Ghost to ^xercise that gift which they had received
in the day of ^^ticost, or any other, But says your authur, compare this ^ace
with Acts 11. 19. 20. 21. and the truth, will ful^ appear. I answer ^^ will
fully appear against you: for christ charged both his Apostles, and likewise
the 70. ^isciples, that they should preach to none but the Jews: and therefore
it is sufficient that they had so many prea^ers in office already by the
commission of Christ* to go^ ^orow all those places: neither w^l^ I d^ny, that
^ere might be others whom the Holy Ghost immediately ^ised up to manifest the
excellent gifts that were to be ^wred down upon the Church in the primative
times.

His answer is uery dark and ambiguous, but in which are contained sundry
errors evident enough. ^ He makes those of the dispersio^ which went about
^eaching the word, to be of the 70 disciples. Luke 10. ^d others the like
furnished with an ^x^r^ordinary gift ^ prophecy: but seems to allow them for
no officers ^ the beginning of his answer, when he thus spea^eth, Besides the
Apostles which were in office there were ^0. Disciples etc. yet afterward in
these words, and ^^refore it is sufficient, that they had so many preachers ^
office already by the commission of Christ to go through all these places, etc,
^e bes^^ was some office or oth^ upon them. Secondry, ^e misseth in two
Scripture which in his answer, ^e points at: the former ^ Act. 2* where he
gathers, that others besides the twelve, rece^ued the gift of prophecy
extraordina^ at the day of pent^cost: the ^ec^nd ^if I mistake no^ is Math. 10.
5. 6. where he ^aks the edict or proh^b^t^on of Christ said upon the Apostles,
and (as h^ says) upon the* 70. Disciples of preaching to any ^ Je^s, ^^rr
above the reach thereof, even unto this ti^ of the dispertion, whereas it
reached only to the dea^ of Christ, when the wall of partition between Ie^ and
Gentiles was broken down: after which the were by the express w^rds of their
Commission ^ preach to all people, beginning indeed at Jerusalem ^ ^arrying
there, till they were endued with power from ^ high, and so proceeding to all
nations. Luke 24. 47. 4^ as it is also recorded Act. 11. 20. that some of the
dispersion, preached the Lord Jesus to the Grecians ^ A^tioch. 3ly, it is
plain by that which I have fo^merly said, that neither these 70 disciples (no
nor t^ ^2,) were by Christ possessed of any office before h^ death; no nor yet
furnished with any extraordina^ gifts of prophecy: the Evangelist (who knew
we^ and is worthy to be believed) bearing also witnes^ with me, that the Holy
Ghost was not yet given beca^ that Jesus was not yet glorified, John. 7. 39.

Lastly it is altogether unreasonable to imagine the they who were scatered and
preached abroad, being the body of the Church at Jerusalem (excepting the
Apostles* were all officers: and little more reasonable to think that they
were all extraordinarily ^nd^ed with the spirit* of prophesy. For first, there
is no circumstance in the text ^eading that way: and to imagine extraordinary,
and mi^^culous things without good evidence, is extraordinary (...) and
p^esumption. 2. the only (...) given unto them a^^* ^ll he Church which
(...)ey that were scat^e^ed ab^o^^: and again ^^^^ 1^. ^ey which were
sc^ttered abro^^* (...) th(...) Cypru^ and Cyrene, etc. nothing (...) any
^^^^ce of ministry. 3. Their preaching he^^ and ^^e^e is (...) noted to be by
reason of their catering hither and ^^ there through persecution, and not of any
e^t^^^rdinary gift, and dispensation committed unto the^. Fourthly, if they had
been extraordinary Prophet^ immediately, and extraordinarily inspired, there
had been no need of so speedy sending of Bar^abas from Jerusalem to Antioch
with supply, though he were a man full of the Holy Ghost, for so were such
Prophets as well as he Ephe. 2. 20. and 3. 5. I conclude therefore as before
that these men's preaching was by a gift* and liberty, common unto them and us.

The next Scripture is 1. Pet. 4, 10. 11. As every man has received the gift
so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of
God; if any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God, if any man
minister let him do it as of the ability which God gives* that God in all
things may be glorified, etc.

This (says M. Yates) is little to the purpose, only thus much: would the
Apostle persuade, that we ought to be harberous one of another, and that
without grudging, because all that we have is given us of God, who has left us
not as ingrossers of his benifits, but as good disposers to his glory and our
brothers good.

He that veiweth the place with out prejudice, cannot but see, that the Apostle
would persuade more then so much: and that M. Yates does injuriously enclose
the Apostles words, ver. 10. to verse 9. which though they lie in common to
both, yet belong much more to the verse following, v. 9. He exhorts to
hospitality, and v. 10. rises from that particular to the more general use of
al gifts or graces, and so v. 11. brings for example, two specialties. 1. the
gift of prophecy in speaking. 2. the ministering of the ability which God
gives bodily or otherwise in the Church. neither can the Apostles meaning
without extreme violence be restrained to ver. 9. which speaks only of
hospitality: which is but the use or ministering of that one gift or grace of
liberality. He says in the tenth verse. As every man has received the gift:
that is as one has received this gift, another that, and every one some: so
minister the same one to another: that is, so let every such person mutually in
the bond of love as ver. 8. communicate his gift: as good disposers ^f the
manifold grace of God: that is knowing that ^very one what gift soever, he has
received, ^s but as the Lords Steward therein. Is Liberality ^lone a manifold
grace? and Hospi^ali^y alone the mi^^stering of a manifold grace of God? To the
ministe^ing of a manifold grace, the Apostle persuades, and therefore not only
that we ought to be harborous one to another, which is but the ministering of
one grace.

Two other Scriptures from the Reu^la^ion follow. The former is cha. 11. v. 3.
I will give to my two witnesses, and they shall prophecy a thousand two hundred
sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.

Th^s is meant says M. Y^tes) of the 2 Testaments, and the instruments that
God should raise up to use as faithful witnesses against Antichris: but what
is this for an ordinary gift of prophecy? Surely in this there is some
extraordinary thing, because it is said God will give power, that is give them
life again: for Antichrist ^^^ k^ll these witnesses when he stopped the
current of the Holy word of God, and shut the mouths of the ministers, etc.

His exposition I will not deny (nor need to fear) save as with great
partiallity on the clergies part, he make the ministers of the word of God,
that i^, men in office, the only faithful witnesses against ancichrist. whereas
the contrary is most true; and that in Antichrists reign no church officer, as
an officer witnessed against him, but all for him: as both having their
authority by him, and binding themselves to submit their (...) trine to his
censure. The persons indeed, that were also officers, even Masse-preist, Monks
and Friars, witnessed some of them against him, but so did not their offices,
or they in respect of them, (which is all one) but rather with him, as
aduantaging his state and Hierarchy. Something extraordinary I do with him
acknowledge to have been in them, in respect of the order then prevailing, and
of the bondage spiritual under which all both things and persons were: as also
of the degree of their ordinary both gifts and graces to put them forth in
service of the truth: but that these witnesses against Antichrist had any extra
ordinary, or miraculous gift of prophecy (which he insinuates, and must
affirm if he will draw them from our part) is merely imagined both against
experience and their own plea. But for the ope^ing of this place, I refer the
reader to our learned Countryman M. Brightman, where he shall find affirmed,
and proved, that these two prophets were the holy Scriptures and Assemblies of
the faithful.

The other scripture is Reu. 14. 6, where the Angel flies in the midst of
heaven having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.

By heaven (says M. Yates) is to be understood the uisible Church, and by the
Angel the learned men that God has ever raised up in the midst of popery to
carry the blessed word of God in the midst of heaven that is raised from the
earthly curruption of Antichrist, but not as yet a^ the height of purity, etc.

As I do not conceive of any such mystery in these words. ( flying in the
midest of heaven) but only that these Angels should roundly and clearly,
specially in respect of former times, publish the Gospel far, and near, as is
the flying of a bird in the airy heaven or firmament speedy and evident; so,
that signified, I assent to his exposition, as being also no way preindiciall,
but much aduantageable to my purpose. For if those learned, and Angell-like men
were to publish the gospel in the midest of popery; and that neither by an
extraordinary, or miraculous gift, nor by virtue of their office, then is
public prophesying out of office by an ordinary gift approuable. The first
part I hope he will easily grant; if not, let him name the man miraculously
inspired in the midst of popery. For the latter, the office it self or function
was no ministry of Christ's appointment, as being the office of a Friar, Monk,
or Mass Priest, so their power to administer it was from or by the pop^ as
universal Bishop: that is, as Antichrist. in respect then of the Gospel which
they had preached* and of their gifts and graces personal, by which they were
both enabled and provoked there n^to, they were Angels of God; but in regard of
there office, and power Ecclesiastical* and Hierarchicall, Angels of
Antichrist. Besides that when they gave their clearest testamony against
Antichrist, they were, for the most part, all excommunicated out of the Church
of Rome, and so being no members could not be officers of any Church. Whereupon
I conclude, that the witness which they ga^e to the truth, was but personal
and not ministerial so far forth as it was of God or by him approved. And thus
it appears how in the quoting of those scriptures, we have not offered abuse
to Gods word, as he abuses us, but have with good conscience, as in the sight
of God, noted them as serving to prove lawful, public prophecy by an
ordinary gift out of office.

Lastly 1. Cor. 14. comes into handling, with the proofs thence taken: which
what weight they have shall appear after rehersall of some more general
considerations promised in my book, in the same place, for the better
understanding of the point, as, 1. that the Church of Corinth above all other
Churches, did abound with spiritual gifts both ordinary and extraordinary. 2.
that they abused these gifts too much unto faction and ambition. 3. that there
upon the Apostle takes occasion in the beginning of the 12. Chap. and so
forward, to draw them to the right use of the gifts of God, which was the
imploiment of them to the edifying of the body in love 4. and Lastly, that
having laid down chap. 13. a full description and large commendation of that
grace of love, cha. 14, and the beginning of it, he exhorts to, prophesying,
and to the study and use of that gift which though it were not so strange a
thing as was the sudden gift of tongues. nor which drew with it such wonder and
admiration, yet was it more profitable for the Church: and though a matter of
less note, yet of greater charity, which must bear sway ^n all our actions,
Whereupon I lay down the first reason for brethrens, though no officers,
liberty in these words Because the Apostle speaks of the manifestation of ^
gift or grace common to all persons, as well bre^heren as ministers, ordinary
as extraordinary, and that at all times which is love: as also of such fruits
and effects of that grace, as are no less common to ^ll, then the grace it
self, nor of less continuance in ^he Churches of Christ, to wit, of
edification, exhor^ation, and comfort, verse. 3. compared with 1 Thessalonians. 5. 11,
14.

In answering the former part of the Reason he is ^ery large but more
negligent, as it appears in his ^enying that the Apostles speaks of a gift
common ^o all persons, and in more then denying, for his rude ^erme I will
conceal for his credits sake, that it was ^o^mon to all persons at al times
admiring how I dare ^ffirme any such thing: adding: that love was enioy^ed to
all but this gift only of such, as did excel a^ongst them: whereas the uery
gift, which I speak ^f in that place, or grace rather, as I there call it, was
one other* but the grace of love; as any that will may see in the reason: which
general grace ough^ to man^fest, and express it self in the ed^fying use of
all ^^e special gifts of the spirit, which by it are set ^ wo^ke and m^^ed, as
the lesser wheels of a clock by the greater. and from which grace the* Apostle
provokes the Church to the stirring up of the gift of prophecy, unto
^d^fication, as well now as then. and whereas, to my ground, as he puts it, and
as after a sort I intended from ver. 3. compared with 1 Thess^ 5, 11. 14. viz.
that since the end which is ed^fication* exhortation, and comfort continues,
therefore the gift of prophecy also continues, he answreth; that there are
many, means to effect one end, and yet some of them may cease yea all of them,
and others come i^ their rooms, ^s for extraordinary gifts, ordianry: and so
for Apostles, ordinary Ministers: instancing furthe^ in tongues, which ver. 26.
are for ed^fication; he neither speaks so properly, as is meet, nor all
admitte^ which he says, takes away the force of the Argum^ Strange tongues, to
speak properly, and expressly as in disputing, are no means of edifying the
Church but the interpretation, and applycation of the matter of the tongues:
neither does the office of the ministry in it self edify. but the use and
exercise of it in teaching, and exhorting? no nor yet the gift of prophesying,
but as it is used in speaking, as ver. 3. he that prophesies, that is uses
the gift of prophesy, speaks unto men, to exhortation edefication and
^^mfort. There being then no other means to edify ^^hort and comfort in the
Church but prophesying; the ^postle, as appears by the two places set
together ^ying these duetyes from the common grace of love ^s well upon
brethren, as officers, ordinary as ex^^aordinary, and at all times, in the
Church, therein ^iues warrant to an ordinary exercise of prophesy in ^^e Church
by men out of office, to wit having ^ifts and abilityes answerable, to the end
of the ^orld.

The second Argument is from ver. 21. where the Apostle says, ye may all
prophecy one by one, that ^ll may learn, and all may be comforted, he speaks
^f all prophesying as largly as of all learning.

This, says he, is absurd: are all the Church Prophets ^^ all may prophecy
who shall learn? the Holy Gh. ^yes all but that is to be understood of such as
have ^ifts: all ought to have the gift of hearing, but the ^^ke is not of
prophesying: and I say this gift was ex^^aordinary for how could all men study
the Scrip^ures when they had them not in their native ^ongues?

It were absurd indeed, if I thought, that every person in the church were to
prophecy: but why should ^e challenge me, or I purge my self of this absurdity?
^hereas the contrary is most evident, both in the ^ords of the question, which
are that others having ^eceiued a gift thereunto, may ought to stir up the
same, and to use it in the Church; and every when in the handling of it. By all
then I mean all that ha^ gifts: and so take all for prophesying as largly, y^
in the subject, according to the received rule of o^ pounding the notes of
universality, as the other a^ for learning. His question, if all may prophecy
w^ shall learn; is easily answered. For they who prophecy at one time may
learn at another: It is the disease of the exalted Clergy to scorn to learn
any thing of others then themselves, and almost o^ of another. Where he further
says, that all oug^ to have the gift of hearing, but the like is not
p^phesying, It is true and that every particular pers^ in the Church is not
bound to have the gift; but if ^ speak any thing to the purpose in hand, he
must ^ further and say that no ordinary brethren out of off^ ought to have the
gift of prophecy: which if it w^ true, then ought none to strive for fitness
to beco^ officers: neither were the reproof just which the Apostle lays, not
only, nor so much, if at all, upon the officers, as upon the brethren, H^b. 5.
11. that f^ the time they ought to be teachers. Of his unwort^ mistaken about
the Scriptures not being in the Corinths native tongue, which he makes the only
grou^ of his Answer, elsewhere. To conclude this argumen^ The Apostle writing
to the Church of Corinth, y^ may al prophecy one by one, cannot be understood
^ extraordinary Prophets, except we conceive that t^^ ^ody of that Church was
or might be prophets ex^raordinary, and miraculously inspired: which,
co^side^ing the super-excellency of that State by me elsewhere laid down, is a
presumption above my reach and least of all agreeing with M. Yates his judgment
in his answer to the next Argument, which is, that extraordinary prophecy did
then begin to cease ^n the Church.

The third Argument is from ver. 34. where the Apostle restrains women from
prophesying, or other ^peaking in the Church with authority as also 1. Tim ^.
11. 12. and in forbidding women, gives liberty to ^ll men gifted accordingly,
opposing women to me^ ^ex to sex, and not women to officers: and again, in
^estraining women shows his meaning to be of ordinary not extraordinary
prophesying: for women ^mmediately extraordinarily, and miraculously inspi^ed
might speak without restraint, Exodus 15. 20. ^udg* 4. 24. Luke 2 36. Acts 2.
17, 19.

It is a pitteous thing to see how M. Yates intaggles himself about this
Argument, straining all the ^eyns of his wit, if not of a more tender part, his
consciene, to draw some face of answer upon it: That which has any show of
answer either in that place, or any other throughout his tedious and perplexed
discourse, I will relat and refute: confirming the Argument clearly, as I am
persuaded, to any indifferent ^udgment.

His first answer, or exception is, that it is most absurd to imagine that the
Corinth. women did follo^ their study, and took ordinary pains to make
sermons. Secondly that extraordinary prophecy d^cease, and that not all at
once, but first in women and that the Apostle therefore especially aims at
them, ^ though, to wit in their own judgment the same measu^ were still upon
them, as well as in former time^ when Christ that saues both man and women
would extraordinarily manifest himself in both, yet first after a sufficent
manifestation of his grace and goodnes^ he withdrew those extraordinay gifts
from that s^ then afterward from the other: His third answ^ upon which he does
most insist, is, that the Apos^ forbids two general faults in the women; the
one that the would pray, and prophecy uncouered, 1. Cor. 11. ^ imitating the
Pythonisses and Sibelles of the Genti^ in laying aside their veil, and
spreading their hair against* decency, and comeliness: the second that in the
husbands presence, they would be as ready to speak ^ they: and therefore the
Apostle finding the women to ^ buse this gift, prohibits the use of it, whether
simply or ^ he cannot judge. Fourthly, he admires by what Log^ this will
follow; women are forbiden to prophecy, therefore men have liberty: which,
says he, is an ill cons^quence.

In his first Answer or rather exception, he m^ takes both the state of the
question, and also the ^ture of the ordinance. The question is not of the
study, or ability of these women, which yet I think was greater then he makes
account of, but of their forwardnes to teach which was certainly too great. And
what consequence is this? The Corinthian women were not sufficiently furnished
to teach by an ordinary gift therefore they needed not to be restrained from
teaching. Nay therefore they needed much more such a bridle of restraint to be
cast upon them; especially considering their mannish boldness, and immodesty
insinuated against them here by the Apostle, in part, but much more chap. 11.

Neither for the second point, are they that speak in the exercise of
prophecy, to make a sermon by an houreglasse, as M. Yates gathers; that were
to abuse the time and wrong the gifts of others (but briefly to speak a word of
exhortation, as God enableth, and that after the ministerial teaching be
ended, as Act. 13. questions also about things delivered, and with them even
disputations, as there is occasion, being part or apurtenances of that
exercise, 1. Cor. 14. 35. Act. 17. 2. and 18. 4,

For the Prophets gifts and abilities then, as under the law a bullock or lamb,
that had any thing superfluous, or lacking in his parts might yet be offered
for a freewill offering, but for a vow it was not to be accepted. Lev. 22. 23.
so in this exercise of Prophecy, as in a free will offering, according to the
gift of God, that which is less perfect, and exact, may far better be
accepted, then if the same were presented in the Pastors vowed service, and
ministration.

For his second Answer: As it is true, that extraordinary prophecy did ce^se
by degrees, so is it not certain, but a mere presumption, that it ce^sed
first in women, but most untrue it is, that the Apostle there aims at all ^^
the ceasing of that gift in women, Ecclesiastical Histories worthy of credit
in this kind, do certify, that the stream of the spirit was so far from
being near dry at this time, as that it ran a strong current well nigh a
hundred years after, for all the extraordinary gifts thereof, as for the
casting out of Devils, foreseing and foretelling of things to c^^e, healing the
sick, and raising of the dead, of when d^uers so raised lived many years
after, witness amongst others Iraenaeus, adv. Her. lib. 2. c. 57. whom also
for the same purpose Eus. Hist. Eccl. l. 5. c. 7. alleges: And ever or women,
Evident it is by the Scriptures that extraordinary Prophecy in a very
plenteous manner by them, and that in the presents of men continued in the
Church many years after Paul's writing of this Episte. Philip the Evangelist had
four daughters vergins which did prophecy, Act. 2. 1. 9 and that in the
presence of the Apostle. Lo, four extraordinary Prophetesses in one house. and
the daughters of one man: so that ^itherto the conduit of the spirit of
prophecy kept ^is course as well upon their daughters as sons. Joel, 2. Act.
2. So Rev. 2. 20. we read how the woman Jesabel ^alling her self a
prophetess, taught and by teaching ^^duced the Lords servants in the Church of
Thya^yra, ^n which place, as the errors and evils of the person. ^s condemned,
so is the former order of the Church manifested to be, that women, prophetesses
extraordinary, might teach. Lastly, the prohibition of women by the Apostle is
perpetual, and not with respect to this, or that time as it appears by the
reasons there of, both in this place, and in the Epistle to Timothy, and such
as equally belong to former times and latter: and no more to the latter end
then to the beginning or meddle time of the manifestation of the grace and
goodness of Christ.

What can be more absurd then to say that these reasons, The women must be
under obedience, 1. Cor, 14. 34. and not usurp authority over the man, but be
in silence, because Adam was first formed, then Eve. An^ Adam was not sedused,
but the women, etc. 1. Tim. 2. 12. 13 14. were not morrall and perpetual? Were
not those reasons and grounds for women's silence in the Church, without
extraordinary dispensation by miraculous inspiration, of as great force seven
years before, as when Paul wrote this Epistle? It is therefore most clear
that the Apostle aims not at all, at any ceasing of the gift of extraordinary
prophecy now growing on, but at the uniuersall, and absolute restraint and
prohibition of women's prophesying, not extraordinary, but ordinary.

In his third answer he deals worse then in any of the other, in laboring to
smother one truth under another. For albeit the women of Corin^th were become
so mannish, as that they would prophesi^ uncovered, and without their veil,
the ensign o^ their subjection, yet does not the Apostle meddle at all with
that malady in this place, but in the 11. cha. of the Epistle, as himself
notes, Here and in Tim. he simply forbids the thing: there the manner of doing
it. Likewise for their being as forward to speak as their husbands, and in
their pre^ence, it may be true in part, and in some. But what then? Does the
Apostle in these places only forbid their speaking uncouered and permit them
to teach so it be veiled? or forbids he only their being as forward as their
husbands, but gives them leave to speak in the Church, so it be with good
manners and, after their husbo^ds which his answer insinuates? Or is it not
evide^t to all that will not shut their eyes, that he simply, and that
severely, inhibits them all speaking whatsoever in this exercise, Are not the
words plain enough? Let the women keep silence in the Church, for it is not
permitted to them to speak, but to be under obedience, as the Law says. And
again, It is a shame for them to speak in the Church. And in 1. Tim, Let the
women learn in silence with all subjection. And, I suffer not a woman to
teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in subjection. For Adam
was first formed, etc. Do not and every one of the Reasons bind women to all
^eace and deep silence in the Church, yea to such ^d so absolute, as that they
may not so much as ask question for learning any thing themselves, ver. 35.
^uch less teach others any thing? I therefore con^ude this as a most certain
and undeniable truth, ^^at the Apostle speaks here of such a gift and ex^rcise
as women are simply forbidden to use in the church, and therefore not of an
extraordinary gift ^r exercise, which they might use lawfully and did ^oth
before, and a long time after the writing of this ^pistle.

His last answer now comes in consideration, which ^s, that the consiquence is
ill, women are forbidden, and therefore men are permitted to prophecy in the
Church by ^n ordinary gift.

If the consiquence seem not good, why does he so strugle as before otherwise
to make an escape from ^he Argument? let us consider of the force of it, which
appears to me irresistible in these 3. things. First, the Apostle in, and for
this work opposes the men to the women, sex to sex and so in prohibiting
women, he permits men. When the H. Ghost opposing faith and works in the cause
of justification, denies that we are justified by works is not then the
consequence good, that therefore we are justified by faith where he opposes
believers and unbelievers in the ^^se of Salvation and teaches that believers
shall be saved does he not teach consequently, that unbelievers shall perish?
if consequences be not good^^ must confess my self far to seek both in
Logi^^ and Divinity.

Secondly, the reasons of the prohibition of wom^^ prove the consiquence which
are all such as prefe^^ the men, before the women, and subject the women to the
men in the Church, and in this very work of prophecy, of which he treats.
But now if in prohibiting women, he gave not liberty unto men* where were the
prerogative of men above women which is the only ground, upon which he
builds his prohibition?

Thirdly, where verse 34. 35. It is not permitted for women to speak but if
they will learn any thing to ask then husbands at home, if their husbands might
not speak neither nor any more then they, what reason can be rendered of the
Apostle so speaking?

Lastly M. Yates in denying this consequence, shows that so he might deny
something, he took no great heed what it were. The Apostle in this whole Chap,
takes order for some to prophecy? and debarring women therefrom; either admits
men to the use of that liberty, or else we must have some third kind of persons
thought of, which are neither male nor female.

My fourth Argument is from verse 29 and 32. L^^ the prophets speak ^wo or
three, and let the rest iudg^ and the spirit of the prophets are subject to the
prophets. ^hence I affirm, that the Apostle speaks not of ex^raordinary
prophets or prophesying, since they in their Doctrine could not err, and so
were not subject to any such judgment, or censure of others. He ^nswereth
roundly, though briefly in this place, that ^hese prophets were not infallibly
assisted* and more larg^y in another place, that such prophets as have an
in^allible assistance are no^ subject to this Rule: but others that had but as
the Apostle said, Romans 12. 6. meaner ^ifts were to be examined according to the
p^oportion of ^aith, so that extraordinary prophets might mix some of their own
wi^h the extraordinary gifts of Gods spirit, which was to be censured by such
as had a greater mea^ure: for none are to think that all that ha^ th^se
extraordinary gifts were free from error in their very doctrine. We see the
strange gift of tongues was abused, and so ^ight the rest be.

That one extraordinary Prophet had a greater mea^ure, and proportion of gifts
then another, I acknow^edge; but that any one of them could err in doctrine or
was not infallibly assisted therein by the spirit ^ deny, as a most pernicious
error, weaking the foundation of faith, and truth of the word of God: neither
has Master Yates so much as enterprised an answer unto the Scriptures brought
by me to prove the contrary: which were Ephesians 2. 20. where the Ephesians as
the household, or Church of God, are said to be built upon the foundation of the
Apostles and Prophets, etc. and chap. 3. 5. where he speaks of ^ mystery of
Christ, which in other ages was not m^ known unto the sons of men, as it is
now revealed u^ his holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit. When it apeares,
that the Church is as well built upon t^^ foundation of the prophets, to wit
extraordinar^ which then were, for of them he speaks, as upon the doctrine of
the Apostles, and they as infallibl^ even for the very foundation, inspired by
the Hol^ Ghost, as the other. So that, if the Prophets co^^ err in doctrine,
then the Apostles, and if in doctrine taught why not written, and if one alone,
why n^ more, or all? and if they might err how know ^^ that they did not err?
If he say the meaner in gift might err, but not the greater; first the same
follo^eth also touching the Apostles, how much more touching the Prophets
before Christ. not comparible t^ those after him, why then may there not be
errors in the writings especially of those meaner gifts as without doubt some
were in comparison of the rest? what whether this wind will bring who sees
not? Moreover, whereas we propound such interpretations and doctrines, as we
gather from the Scriptures, by discourse of reason, and so may err; they, on
the contrary every one of them d^livered doctrine by immediate inspiration of
the spirit, in which by reason of the divine impression which it made in their
hearts, differencing it from all both humain collection and Diabolical
suggestion, they could not err, or mistaken; but know infallibly when. and
wherein, they ^ere moved by the holy Ghost. Besides there is not alike ^ason of
strange tongues, and prophecy, for the conside^tion in hand, since the Church
is not built upon the ^^undation of strange tongues, as upon the foundation of
^ophesie; neither was the matter of the speech inspired ^t the language only,
except the same persons were ^rophets also*

Lastly, if there were the like reason of tongues. and ^^ophesie, yet except
men might err in a tongue, and ^e^m themselves inspired extraordinarily when
they ^ere not, which were absurd to affirm; it could not e^nce any posibility
of erring in doctrine by extraordi^ary Prophets.

The last Argument in my book I take from ver..37 ^8. If any man think
himself to be a prophet, or spiritual let ^im acknowledge that the things
that I write unto you are the ^ommandements of the Lord: But if any be ignorant
let him be ^gnorant.

M. Yates taxes me for making a Prophet, and spiritu^ll man all one, since by
a spiritual man is meant such as excel^ed in any spiritual gift, prophecy,
or other, But without cause: since I neither mean more nor need more for my
purpose, then that a Prophet be included in the general of a spiritual man.
But wherefore does he not answer the Argument or mind where the force thereof
lies? which is in the* words following; let him acknowledge that the things
that I write are the commandments of the Lord. But if any man be ignorant, let
him be ignorant. The extraordinary Prophets, were guided as immediately and
infallibly by the revelation of Gods spirit. as Paul himself, and might as* well
have required of him to acknowlede that the things which they speak were the
commandemen^ the Lord, as he of them: neither was it possible that the or any
of them should be ignorant, that the thi^ which he spoke were the
commandments of the Lo^ Which Argument is also much strengthened, and mad^ in
my judgment, unanswerable; by that which we fin^ ver. 36 Came the word of God
out from you, or came it unto ^ only? which words the Apostle does not direct
unto ^ women, as M, Yates misconceaueth with great erro^ and contrary both unto
reason, and to the express Gre^^ text which will not bear it, but to the
Prophets; w^ whom he deals, and that by way of comparison w^ himself, from
whom, to wit, by immediate revelatio^ the word of God came after a sort to the
Corinthia^ Which plainly proves that they could not be extraord^nary prophets,
from whom the word of God came u^ the Church as well as from himself: they
being inspir^ immediately by the Holy Ghost as well as he.

The Christian Reader may find, besides these, other reasons from this
Scripture laid-downe by our worth^ countryman M. Cartwright in his Confutation
of the Rh^mists, Sect. 5. for the justification of this exercise as ordinary
and continual.

The other Arguments in the same place of my book^ to the same purpose, though
M. Yates could no^ but take knowledge of, yet he not thought good to meddle
with, One of them only I will annex in this place word for word, as there I
have set it down.

It is the commandment of the Lord by the Apostle that a Bishop be apt to
teach, and that such Elders or Bishops he called as are able to exhort with
sound doctrine and to conuin^ the gainsayers, 1. Tim, 3. 2. Tit. 1. 9. now
except men, before they be in office may be permitted to manifest ^^eir gifts
in doctrine so in prayer, which are the two main ^^rks requiring special
qualifications in the teaching ^^ders, Acts. 6, 4. how shall the Church, which
is to choose ^^em. take knowledge of their sufficiency, that with ^^th and good
conscience they may call them, and sub^it unto them for their guides? If it be
said, that upon ^ch occasion, trial may be taken of men's gifts: he that so
^ith, grants the question, but must know besides, first that ^ens gifts and
abilities should be known in Some measure, before they be once thought on for
officers: and secondly, ^at there is none other use or trial of gifts, to wit
in and ^y the Church, but in prophesying* for every thing in the ^ords house is
to be performed in some ordinance there ^ nothing thrown about the house, or
out of order in it and other ordinance in the Church save this of prophecy ^
there none, where in men out of office are to pray and ^each, etc, Lastly, M.
Yates in denying this liberty, be^^des other evils, reproves the practice of
all reformed ^hurches, and of the the Church of England with them. ^ is not
only permitted as lawful, but required as ne^essary where I line that such as
have bent their thoughts ^owards the ministry, should before hand use their
gifts ^ublickly in the Church: and intolerable bondage it ^ould be thought by
them to have pastors ordained for them as all there are unto the places in
which they are to minister, of whose ability in teaching they had not taken
former experience. And not only so, but it has been further decreed in a
solemn Synod, that in all Churches ^he ^^her springing up, or growing to
perfection, the order of prophe^ie should be observed according to Paul's
institution, and that unto that fellowship, to wit of Prophets, should be
admitted ^ot only the ministers. but also the Teachers, and of the Elder^ and
Deacons and even of the uery common people, ex ipsa plebe. if there were any
which would confer their gift^ ^eived of the Lord to the common benifit of the
Church, ^ Harmon. Synod. Belg: de pro^hetica, Ex Synodo Embd^ Can, 1. 2. And
for England it self; what will M. Yates ^ to the Common places, as they are
called; or Sermons, as ^ deed they are in the Colleges, not only permitted u^
but imposed upon diverse, who never received order priesthood? What to such as
preach by the Bishops^ cence, without any such order? yea to all such as are
^dained and called ministers, but have not actual char^ and so are theas
Popish accidents in the Sacrament, wi^ out a subject? Lastly, it might be
showed, if need we that greater liberty then he allows, is used by diverse the
Romish Church, the Spiritual Egypt, and house bondage for Gods people: so as
the bondage of the v^ Hager of Rome is not so great in this case, as he wo^
bring upon Sarah her self.

The Lord give unto his people courage to stand ^ this liberty amongst the
rest, wherewith Christ ha^ made them free; and unto us who enjoy it. grace to ^
the same unto his glory, in our mutual edification ^men.
