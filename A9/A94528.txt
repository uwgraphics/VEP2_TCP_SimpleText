TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.
The Humble Petition of the Citizens of York, delivered to his Majesty by the
High Sheriff of YORK.
Most Gracious Sovereign.
WE Your Majesty's loyal and obedient Subjects, do most humbly supplicate
your Highness to look with compassion upon your Protestant subjects of
Ireland, that lie weltring in their own blood, most inhumanely shed by the
bloody cruelty of the Popish Rebels, who have already in a manner, eradicated
^^e Protestant Religion, your Majesty's Sovereignty, and the English (...)ation
out of that Kingdom.

And with like compassion, to look upon your Majesty's Subjects ^f England;
whose just fears of the like calamity, daily expected, do ^ake them (in a
measure) partakers of them before they fall.

Which miseries present, and dangers eminent, can neither be pre^^ted, nor
redressed, if these distances of place, and differences of ^ouncels, do
continue between your Majesty, and your Majesty's ^^eat Council the
Parliament.

And therefore your Majesty's Petitioners, do humbly supplicate, that your
Majesty will be pleased to reconcile the displeasures conceived against your
loyal Subjects of this Realm (represented by the Parliament) unto whose
religious and faithful Councels, as we have referred our selves, so we do
most humbly desire your Majesty to vouchsafe your Princely ear, and personal
presence. That by their advice, your Majesty's piety and wisdom may prevent
the dangers, that in these distracted times, do threaten the destruction of
Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Lives of your perplexed Subjects.

And in particular, they humbly pray your Majesty's consent to pass an Act,
prepared by the Parliament, for supply of money, for payment of the forces
entertained to subdue the Rebels of Ireland, and for payment of the Billet
money, due unto this Country.

And your Petitioners shall humbly pray, etc.
