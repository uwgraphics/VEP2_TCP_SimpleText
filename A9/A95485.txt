The Two Unfortunate LOVERS. Or, A true Relation of the lamentable end of John
True and Susan Mease.
And how they died unfortunate.
Their lives this Ditty does relate.
The tune is, the Brides Burial.
ATtend you Lovers and give ear,
unto my mournful Song,
Of two that loved faithfully,
yet did each other wrong.
At Coventry in Warwickshire
this young man he did dwell,
His Name John True a shooemaker
and lived of it full well.
At Corly did this Maiden dwell,
three miles from Coventry,
Yet for the love he bore to her,
he would her often see.
And coming to her on a day,
he told to her his mind,
Susan (quoth he) I love thee dear,
be not to me unkind.
If thou can love and fancy me,
in heart and eke in mind,
I will prove loving unto thee,
be not to me unkind.
Thy cheerful looks rejoice my heart,
and merry make my mind,
Sweet Susan then love me again,
be not to me unkind.
Good John I thank you for your love,
and wish you at home to tarry,
I am too young for you to wed,
and have no mind to marry.
Where you do dwell are Maidens store
of beauty fair and free,
Set not thy love upon me then,
for I cannot love thee.
This answer struck him to the heart,
as cold as any stone,
And homewards strait he did return
with many a sigh and groan.
Wishing that he had never been born,
or in his cradle died,
Unhappy man to love so true,
and yet to be denied.
Quoth he, I will to her again,
and hear what she does say,
It may be she may be more kind,
though first she said me nay.
Then coming to the Town again,
he sent for her strait way,
Desiring her to speak with him,
but still she said him nay.
Then did he sigh lament and grieve,
and knew not what to say,
Then did he take his pen in hand,
and writ these words strait way.
My hearts delight and only joy,
kill me not with disdain,
Vouchsafe that I may speak with thee
to rid me out of pain.
Resolve me sweetest I thee pray.
why is thy hatred such?
I know no cause unless it be,
for loving thee too much.
As is my name, so is my love,
sweet Susan unto thee,
True is my name, True is my love,
and there so shall be.
My love is Loyal, Just, and good,
kill me not with disdain,
Rather do me the courtesy
to love for love again.
When she had read and understood
his mind and his intent,
She then began to like and love,
and yields him hearts content.
John I am thine, if thou be mine,
for ever and for aye:
It was to try thy constancy
that I did say thee nay.
But here is my hand, my heart and love,
I Will never thee more deny,
My love is constant firm and true,
and shall be till I Dye.
Then they embraced each others love,
and joined in heart and voice,
That she of him, and he of her
had made so sweet a choice.
But fortune that does often frown,
where she before did smile,
The man's delight, the Maidens joy,
full soon she did beguile.
When she was settled in her love,
then he would change his mind,
And for to try her constancy,
would be to her unkind.
And thus resolved in his mind,
he would come to her no more,
But went and wooed another Maid,
which grieved her heart full sore.
Quoth he, she proved unto me,
hard-hearted and unkind:
But now her true love I have won,
I Will bear the self same mind.
When she perceived his love to her,
not as 'twas wont to be,
She did lament, sigh, weep and grieve,
and then these words said she.
False-hearted wretch adieu, quoth she,
disloyal and unkind,
And if I dye for love of thee,
thou shall not know my mind.
Woe to the time I did believe,
that flattering tongue of thine,
Would God that I had never seen
the tears of thy false eyn.
Hard hap had I to set my love,
on one that mocked me,
Sure all the Country did not yield
a man so false as he.
Thus was she brought to mean estate
all comfort from her fled,
She did desire to speak with him.
before that she was dead.
Her friends did seek to cheer her up,
and to make glad her mind,
But she was killed with loving him,
who proved to her unkind.
False-hearted man, may never Maid,
love thee as I have done,
But may my death remembered be,
to time that is to come.
But may all Maids example take,
by this my mournful death,
And now O Lord receive my soul,
to thee I yield my breath.
Thus Died the pattern of true love,
thus died a virtuous Maid,
Thus died as good a harmless Lass,
as ever love betrayed.
Six Maids in white as, custom is,
did bear her to the grave,
Her Parents grieve lament and more.
no child at all they have.
When as her lover understood,
for truth that she was Dead,
He raged and ready was to tear
the Hair from off his head.
But when he came into the place,
where his true lover lay,
He strait way ran unto the grave,
and there these words did say.
Susan (quoth he) i will Kiss thy grave,
upon my bended Knee,
Whereby i will show to all the world,
how dear I loved thee.
And as he lay upon the ground,
he heard a voice to say,
John True if e're thou loved'st me dear
make have and come away.
Then started he up from the grave,
and stood like one struck Dumb,
And when he had regained his speech
he said, I come, I come.
And thus like one out of his wits,
he raged in pitious sort,
That all the Neighbors presently
were grieved at his report.
And thus with sorrow and grief of heart,
he lay a whole fortnight,
And when he had confessed his fault
he yielded up his spirit.
According to his hearts Desire,
and as he did request,
They Dig'd his grave, and laid him down
by her whom he loved best.
you young men all that have true loves
be sure unto your friend,
And if you love, be sure your love,
be true unto the end.
And thus I end my story true,
so full of grief and woe,
May never any seek again,
to wrong each other so.
