THE SPEECH OF Colonel SHAPCOTT. Knight for Devonshire.
Being Spoken on the 30. of October. in the Parliament House, in behalf of K.
Charles the second.
M. SPEAKER,
THe Gentleman which has spoken last, did make a motion to this House, that we
should establish these three Kingdoms up M. Whitlock.
on the present Protector and his Heirs; and that in respect of his great
Deservings, and as a Reward for his Faithful Service, which will be but very
short of his Merits.

Truly M. Speaker, If to undo three Kingdoms be meritorious, I must needs say
he deserves far above any; or if to violate the Laws and Freedoms of the
Nation by Imposing new Laws upon us, viz. A mere Spanish Inquisition,
substituted under another name, whereby to sweep away our Orthodox Clergy, and
to set up in their rooms Anabaptistical persons; I say, if by Imposing Taxes of
sundry kinds, being very burdensome and insupportable, and that without any
cause or reason, but that of State, and not the State of the Nation neither,
but of his own usurping Government and Tyran^ie over us and our Liberties: or,
if his creating a Court to destroy the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom,
contrary to the Laws of the Nation, under the cloak and color for the relief
of poor Prisoners; if these be merits for which he deserves three Kingdoms at
once to be given him and his Posterity, then let him have it: But if we must
needs have a King again, why not he whose unquestionable Right it is? What has
he done to be excluded and dispossessed of his undubitable Right? Or what mean we
thereby? unless we intend to perpetuate the Curse of God upon us and our
posterity, by giving away what is not ours to give, and by that Act owning all
the Murders, Perjuries, and Treasons of this Man; and consequently ent^^l the
Curse of God upon us and the whole NATION.

FINIS.
