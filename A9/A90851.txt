Popery Routed: OR, Father Petres's Farewell to LONDON City.
To the Tune of, Hark how the Thundering Cannons Roar.
I.
SEE how the Romish Whore goes down,
Posting wholesale out of Town,
'Cause her Fate does shrewdly Frown,
And Cross her Inclination.
Father Petres, and his Crew
Of Jesuits, Monks, and Friars too,
Must now Pack up, and bid adeiu
To London's Corporation.
II.
Pox on all their Perjured Oaths,
Which a Zealous Churchman loathes,
Are they not Wolves in Sheep's cloths,
That Lurk in every Station,
To Trepan the Innocent,
And hatch a Hellish Discontent?
Let us then with one Consent,
Dismiss them from our Nation.
III.
When I saw them first grow bold,
I thought the Proverb true of old,
That they ran too fast to hold
Their damned Insinuation.
Now their Prime Dispensing Power
Lies a-bleeding in the Tower,
Cursing of the Fatal Hour
Of His first Procreation.
IV.
Now that Wizard knows full well,
Himself to be a Bird of Hell,
Inhumanely thus to Rebel
Against his Habitation.
But ever this Hypocrite shall pass,
We'll bring his Crimes for Looking-Glass,
To see himself the meerest Ass
Of all the World's Creation
V.
Welcome was Brave Orange here,
As it plainly does appear,
Who Delivered us from Fear
Of Popish Usurpation.
Who when we were in great Surprise,
Preserved us from our Enemies,
And all the damned Conspiracies
Of Rome's Assassination.
VI.
Was there such a Trick ever seen
As has Lately acted been,
By their Fathers, and the Q -- n,
To gull our English Nation?
But their Juggling up that Brat,
From we know not who nor what,
Will be proved; nay, worse than that
Of Transubstantiation.
VII.
Mounsieur now had best take heed,
For his Expeditious speed,
In Helping us, ever we had Need
Of his Dissimulation;
Least in Requital of his Care,
We send his Knives, and some to spare,
And bring Le Bougra in for share
Of's Cursed Assignation.
VIII.
Well, I Will say no more; but see
(True Protestants where ever you be)
You come not near such Villainy,
Nor grand Equivocation,
Ever Long I hope our Parliament,
Will rid that superstitious Scent
From us; that we may rest Content,
Each in his proper Station.
LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1689.
