LONDON, Printed by T. F. for R.G. December. 10* 1642.

A true relation of the proceedings of the Cavaliers in several parts of this
Kingdom.
THe malicious malignant party, the Cavaliers of Cornwall, that daily march
under the command of the Lord Mohone, does hourly do mischief in those
parts, without remorse or pity, that you would scarce imagine or believe, they
will not suffer them to plowe their Grounds to sow their Grain, but with
their Horses they destroy it, they go to their Barnes and lodge their Horses
there and pluck down their Stackes of Corn to feed their Beasts, and throw
it about to make Fodder of, and when they leave the place, they set them all on
fire, swearing no Corn shall grow until the War be done, nay the very
Churches they make Stables of, is not this barbarous and inhumane.

On the twenty-eygth of November, at Foy in Cornwall, certain Cavaliers
coming thither to be billited, the Town did kindly entertain them on this
condition, to pay for what they had, the Captains and Commanders took their
oaths, no souldiet that marched under their command, should be so base but pay
for what he had, and so they did, there remaining three days.

The fourth, they gave the Town notice of their departure and their Drumes
about for to give notice that if any were unpayde of any Soul^ier let them
repayte to their Captains, and they should be satisfied, none came all was
discharged, and for their welcome each place where they had layne, did feast
them gratis with great thanks, the word being given among them, they fell to
plundering breaking open Trunkes, chests and boxes, took all their plate and
money they could find, and told them they did but borrow it, when the war was
done, they would pay it back again, and thus and in this manner, do these
wretched catives these Cavaliers enrich themselves by making others poor.

At Lawson getting in with the like wild they likewise plundered that, all but
of their own religion that are yet secure, they have stuffed the Papists houses
with the Protestants goods, and like the Devil they cry all is there own,
swearing and daming, blaspheming and cursing that they will up to the King in
spite of opposition and for the City of London they intend, there for to keep
their Chrstmas, and make the Citizens wait upon their trenchers, but for the
Roundheads, as they so term them, they will send them pell mell to their
father the devil, thee swear they will build in every street a cross, to
cross those that survive; therefore I hope the City will provide to give them
entertainment let them have bullets but their bellies full, and they will be
quiet Questionless, thus hoping of your safety, and your welfares, with my
prayers to God for your peace, and the Cavaliers destruction, I rest yours till
death,

Jeremiah Trivery.

A true Copy of a Letter sent from a worthy Gentleman, inhabiting at Banbury,
to a Merchant inhabiting in the City of LONDON.
Worthy Sir,
I Much joy of your health and welfare, you write to me for news from the
Cavaliers, how and in what manner they have behaved themselves, since the King
came last down, as for Battle you know as well as we they have had none. but
here they lie in Oxford, Abbington, Woodstocke, and other places, Rioting,
Drinking, swearing, and Revelling, exceeding full of Money, paying still as
they call, but we fear at their departure they will have it back, again with
treble interest, here they wait (as they do give out) for the Lord Mohone, who
of a certain is seventeene thousand strong, but we hear that Captain Pym,
Master Pims son is now with his Forces at Plymouth, and stops their passage
over the River, that they are enforced as yet to keep in Cornwall

But to my Cavaliers, at Woodstocke one of these roring-boyes being quartered
there, went to a Drapers shop to cheapen Linen, they agreed upon the price,
others coming in he sell into discourse with some that knew him, and went
away, the servants being busy, with his Cloth unpaid for, the next day
coming by the Shop, the servant knew him, and demanded money for the Cloth,
which yesterday this Cavalier had bought, but had never paid for it, this
ungodly Catiffe having his oaths ready, swore that he had paid the money to
him or his Master, his master denied the receipt, as well he might, the
Cavalier with terrible oaths, most perjuriously swore that he had paid him;
for if he did depart the house when he did buy the Cloth, before he had paid
for it, he desired that openly might be shown upon him some vengeance, or that
he might suddenly sink or fall down, and never have power to stir, or go out
of that place, thinking perhaps as the Athiests do, that, there is no God, or
else that God hears not the prayers of the people, either to reward the just,
or to rebuke the wicked, but God is a swift God to revenge, when his mercy is
refused, for in the depth of his Judgment, he heard his perjury, and struck
him so immediately to the ground that staggering too and fro, the strength of
his Legs failing him, down he fell in the Shop, and became speechless, being
never able to rise without help never able to utter any more blasphemous
oaths against the Lord, only a wonderful thing to tell, as if God should
plainly show the cause of his procured wrath.

This perjured Cavalier held out in his left hand money for the Cloth, that
the standers by might behold the same, but he fell down in the Devils name for
to stand up again no help could support him, that he might be able again to
go, so he was carried to his Lodging, and within an hour or two dyed.

AT Oxford a noted Cavalier, a filthy talker of ribauldry, and a Common curser
and swearer, and a great blaspheamer fell sick, in his short sickness he
refused all comfortable Doctrine, he still cried out the Devil, the Devil,
confessing indeed Gods all potent power, for he said he felt it but could not
pray for Grace, the cause he himself knew, but would not utter it, so kissing
his hand often, in which he said he held the Devil, crying only for help
only upon the Devil, he most miserably raving ended his most wretched Life.

AT Abbington a great Cavalier, and an excessive drinker, being at a Tavern,
in the height of his jollity and mirth threw the Pots down stayres, swearing,
cursing, singing and blaspheming, the Parson of a Village nere adjoining,
passing the street, this Cavalier looking out of the Window and called to
him, do thou hear Parson of no Church, come up hither, and swore a great
oath, that he would drink to him a whole Pulpet-full, so setting the
Pottle-pot to his mouth, he powered (...) his throat so fast, in such a
presumptious manner, that suddenly his Bowels fell out of his body, and there
he dyed most miserably.

FINIS.
