AN EXTRACT Of a LETTER From a Person OF Quality At BRVXELS of the 5. of March
S. N. to a Private FRIEND.
SIR,
I Shall now give you intelligence of certain, and I assure you acceptable
News to us, and doubtless will be so to you in England. On Tuesday last the
Marquess of Caracene by a Commission from the Court of Spain, went to the
King of Scots, and did give him a full assurance of all possible Assistance
both of Men, and Moneys, toward the obtaining his Crown, and Right again,
the Marquess delivered to the King of Scots a Packquet. And another to the
Duke of York from the Court of Spain, And in the Dukes there was a Letter
which offered him to be Lord High Admiral of all the Spanish Fleets in Europe,
and both the Indies, and to have the disposition of ten thousand Land
Soldiers, of whom he shall be constituted Commander in chief, wheresoever he
shall Land in any of the Spanish Dominions. And from the Court of France, the
Lord Jermyn and Crofts are come to this place, and have from the Cardinal made
such Propositions to the King, as will undoubtedly bring a bloody War into
England, unless the Parliament do in love to themselves and Country prevent
it, by a peaceable restoration of the King to his own Right. This Court, and
all these Parts are full of joy at this News. And the King of Scots is not only
Courted by the Court of Spain, but very highly by the Ambassadors of France
and Holland also; This News you may report for true.

Yours, etc. T. R.
Bruxells, March 5. Stila Novo.
