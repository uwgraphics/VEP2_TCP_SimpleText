A Pastoral Dialogue BETWEEN ALEXIS and STREPHON, Written by the Right
Honorable, The Late Earl of Rochester. At the BATH, 1674.
Alex. I.
THere sighs not on the Plain
So lost a Swain as I;
Scorcht't up with Love, frozen with Disdain.
Of killing Sweetness I complain.

Streph. If it is Corinna, die.
II.
Since first my dazzled Eyes were thrown
On that bewitching Face,
Like ruined Birds, robbed of their Young,
Lamenting, frighted, and alone,
I fly from place to place.
III.
Framed by some Cruel Powers above,
So nice she is, and fair;
None from undoing can remove,
Since all, who are not Blind, must Love;
Who are not vain, Despair.

Alex. IV.
The Gods no sooner give a Grace,
But fond of their own Art,
Severely jealous, ever place
To guard the Glories of a Face,
A Dragon in the Heart.
V.
Proud and ill-natured Powers they are,
Who peevish to Mankind,
For their own Honor's sake, with Care,
Make a sweet Form divinely Fair,
And adds a Cruel Mind.

Streph. VI.
Since she is insensible of Love,
By Honor taught to hate,
If we, forced by Decrees above,
Must sensible to Beauty prove,
How Tyrannous is Fate?

Alex. VII.
I to the Nymph have never named
The Cause of all my pain.

Streph. Such Bashfulness may well be blamed;
For since to serve we are not ashamed,
Why should she blush to Reign?

Alex. VIII.
But if her haughty Heart despise
My humble proffered One,
The just Compassion she denies,
I may obtain from other's Eyes;
Hers are not Fair alone.
IX.
Devouring Flames require new Food;
My Heart's consumed almost:
New Fires must kindle in her Blood,
Or Mine go out, and that is as good.

Streph. Would live, when Love is lost?
X.
Be dead before thy Passion dies;
For if thou should survive,
What Anguish would the Heart surprise,
To see her Flames begin to rise,
And Thine no more Alive.

Alex. XI.
Rather what Pleasure should I meet
In my Tryumphant scorn,
To see my Tyrant at my Feet;
Whilst taught by her, unmoved I sit
A Tyrant in my Turn.

Streph. XII.
Ungentle Shepherd, cease for shame;
Which way can you pretend
To merit so Divine a Flame,
Who to dull Life makes a mean Claim,
When Love is at an End?
XIII.
As Trees are by their Bark embraced,
Love to my Soul does cling;
When torn by the Herd's greedy Taste,
The injured Plants feel they are defaced,
They wither in the Spring.
XIV.
My rifled Love would soon retire,
Dissolving into Air,
Should I that Nymph cease to admire,
Blessed in whose Arms I will expire,
Or at her Feet despair.
