Certain CONSIDERATIONS In order to a more speedy, cheap, and equal
distribution of Justice throughout the NATION.

Most humbly presented to the High COURT of Parliament of the most hopeful
Commonwealth of ENGLAND.

By Henry Robinson.

London, printed by Matthew Simmons next door to the Golden Lion in Aldersgate
street, 1651.

To the High Court of Parliament of the most hopeful Commonwealth of England.
THE passing of those long expected Resolves of this High Court for the
Englishing both of our Laws and Proceedings in all Courts of Justice; for
abrogating the so called, Court-hand, which to most People did nothing differ
from exorcisticall Characters, save that the former was truly mischievous to
them, the latter for the most part but imaginary; For nullifying superfluous
Offices, and retrenching unnecessary Fees; for the expediting of Causes, and
pursuing certain directions concerning Juries, has emboldned me to present
unto your Wisdom these few considerations hereunto annexed: for which, and what
else I have transgressed in the like kind, I shall only use this short
Apology; That, as I have to some been known to cast in my little mite,
concerning many, if not most matters of public debate, not so much out of
confidence of my own strength, as sincerity of heart, and for provoking others
of better abilities to improve them: so in this, toward the Reformation of our
Laws and Law-proceedings, which if not speedily brought about, may like
enough, take root again, and settle firmer upon their old corrupt foundation,
which must necessarily contract such farther rottenness and festering, as will
at first infect, and afterward, too soon, make void and annihilate all those
Glorious Liberties and Discoveries, which we have attained to with the charge
of so much Blood and Treasure, for redeeming them out of the jaws of
Superstition and Tyranny: may You then but be prevailed upon speedily to secure
what We have so dearly paid for: We must infallibly back again into our wonted
bondage (which on such as have had their eyes opened, would fall more grievous)
unless the whole Mystery of the Judiciary faculty, and of all those that
relate unto it, be fully discovered, and set at rights.

I beseech You consider, They are an Active generation, so that if well
regulated, the Nation may be as happy in them, as otherwise We must be again
more miserable.

May You then please to let it be enquired into; Whether the Multiplicity of
Courts of Justice do not cause a more mischievous confusion in the World, than
the Babilonian of Languages? That of Babel does only estrang Nations to one
another; but this variety of Courts of Justice in any Land or Nation, perplexes
and confounds the People thereof among themselves; The proceedings in them are
so various, as that it is above any one man's ability and strength to be
experienced in more than one of them: So many several Courts, so many several
hard Mysteries or Trades, above one whereof, no man though of the ablest parts,
can be well skilled in or practiced: And from henc proceeds it in part, that
Lawsuits become both more lasting and chargeable: Particularly, to what purpose
served the Kings Prerogative Court of Exchequer, one of the most eminent badges
of Conquest and Tyranny? Surely all Courts should be the Commonwealths in
general, and every man's in particular: Justice should not know any distinction
of persons, but be still one and the same in all Courts alike, whether as
touching the letter of the Law, or Equity: But for sooth, they were all called
the Kings Courts alike; And indeed we had little but what was our Kings, We
had nothing of our own; so gracious were they, and so miserable have we been:
But our Kings boar sway enough in all other Courts at Westminster, they needed
not have had a peculiar Court of their own to do Injustice.

Besides; Our Laws of themselves are so numerous and intricate, as that it is
not possible to know them all, much less keep them in memory, or avoid the
being entangled by them, and injured by Law: Nay, I am afraid it may be found,
that never such Juggling, if not very cheating, was consistent with the rules of
any Faculty, as of this I speak, and is at present practiced in England: How
else comes it to pass that a man may dwell in Westminster Hall, and yet be sued
unto an Outlary before he know of it? How comes it else to pass that an Executor
may be forced to pay as long as he has Assetts, and yet afterward be forced
to pay the same sums over again, because he could not keep himself from being
forced to pay them away before? In brief, how comes it else to pass that a
Debtor may keep his Creditor in prison until he be compelled to give him a
discharg, or yield to whatsoever he desires? I only wish that some honest
public spirited Lawyer who thoroughly understands the various Meanders, Quirks
and subtilties of this over-powring Faculty, would anatomize, and lay open unto
the Nation, how easily it is for the very best Laws we have to be evaded and
frustrated, and the whole formality and proceedings to be avoided and deluded
by legal fallacies and tricks.

I am confident our whole body of Laws, even in their original constitution,
will be found to be so purely the Offspring of Oppression, and Oppressors
Creatures, and in themselves so weak and fruitless, as to the estating and
continuing of a Nation in Peace, plenty, and Contentation, that the Law, or
rather custom of the Turks, is to be preferred before it, where he that will
give most, shall be sure to have the right determined on his side; only,
because the wronged party is quickly out of pain, and in a short time knows
what he has to trust to:

But for our own Laws, which some notwithstanding prefer before all the
world's, because they never well understood their own, much less those of other
Countries, though corrupt enough in most; They are such a forraginous piece of
Intricacies, such a vanity to become a Rule unto so famous a Nation; such a Nose
of wax, liable to be formed any way for the vexation of a People; as that if
the very memory thereof, and the Formalities of their proceedings were quite
extinct, never to present themselves again unto our Imaginations, and thereby
the Nation forced to seek out both new Laws and Forms; we could not happen
upon so bad again; Nay, we were likelier to light upon far better than any
Nation enjoyes at present; because well near all Nations, though some more,
some less, lie under oppression, and cannot procure to themselves, such as they
desire, nor the equal administration of those they have.

I did not intend to have been so tedious, and therefore humbly crave leave to
insert a word concerning our Statutes against Maintenance and Champarty,
whereby the purchasing of Titles from persons not in possession, have been so
speciously prohibited, as the only way to prevent disquieting, vexing,
oppressing, and final disinheriting of the true Proprietors: Surely We may
find the quite contrary effect to have ensued hereupon, and poor People by
force of these Statutes been necessitated to lose their titles, because they
might not gratify such as would have been willing to furnish them with moneys
to prosecute and recover their Rights.

What good effect have we seen at any time to poor People suing in forma
pauperis? If the highest vyer can protract, and sway Causes as they please,
against others of moderate, though inferior estates and friends unto
themselves; certainly no crumbs of relief, much less of dispatch, will be
suffered to be cast away to Paupers.

May we but have speedy justice at home in our own Counties, and large charges
to such as shall be found unduly sued; we need not prohibit poor People, to
sell or give away one half of their right, for recovering of the other: Men
will look before they leap, and consider well before they adventure upon bad
titles, or disturb any man in possession, unless they see sufficient evidence
to bear them out therein: It would be a hundred fold better for the Nation,
even under these Laws we live at present, so far forth to repeal those Statutes
concerning Mayntenance and Champarty, and render all men in possession liable
to have their Titles questioned; than to leave poor People remediles; In regard
such poor People thus oppressed are above a hundred for one, who by such repeal
would be in danger to be unduly molested.

But if the Reformation of the Laws seem great and difficult, and by so much
longer before it can be brought about: We may notwithstanding be happy in due
time, If it be but seriously begun to be set upon at present; and in the
Interim, with less disadvantage patiently expect the completing thereof, If
the County Register of Conveyances mentioned in the same days Resolves,
together with another Register of Bonds and Bills of debt, with their
Irrevocable assignablenesse to all intents and purposes, (whereof I have a
model not exceeding one sheet of paper, nor requiring many hours debate, ready
to be produced whenever this High Court shall be pleased to refer it unto a
Committee, to be proceeded on) were forthwith established: Both the said
Registers carrying in themselves a capacity to abbreviat and prevent the
greatest part of all Lawsuits and Cavils; and the latter not only to multiply
the stock of the Nation, which at present is at so low an ebb, would
exceedingly facilitate and enlarg Trade and Navigation.

But lest I should be accounted unworthy, or unadvised to intermeddle in this
great affair, which besides it is being obnoxious to other objections, might
perhaps at first appearance be thought very dammageable unto the conscientious
learned Judges and Counselors: In case this High Court in their deep Wisdom
shall think of a Reformation, whether according to this little model in all
humility propounded, or any other, which, I wish might be of a hundred fold
more advantage unto this Nation; It is in Your power to constitute and assign
such worthy Judges and Counselors in every County throughout the Land, with
the very same stipends, or greater than they enjoy at present; Praemio and
paena floret Respublica: It were better to be profuse in rewarding persons of
desert in what kind soever, than to be short therein.

And since the pittance is so small, which can any ways befall me in this
Commonwealth's prosperity, I hope I shall be thought free from all
self-Interests, and only to have engaged my self in matters of this high
Nature out of a Public spiritedness, and to make the best Improvement of my
only talent how small soever, to the best advantage of this Nation wherein
Providence has cast me.

There now remayns only this humble Motion, That the High Court of Parliament
if in their deep Wisdoms They see cause, vouchsafe to refer the consideration of
this little Paper unto the Committee mentioned in the said Resolves, for whose
happy proceedings thereupon, or otherwise, in pursuance of the said Resolves,

This Propounder and the whole Nation will be bound to pray, etc.

Certain considerations, in order to a more speedy, cheap, and equal
distribution of Justice throughout the Nation.
THERE is seldom any Writ served upon a man, but the party that serves it,
makes one or more lies, or falls pretenses, to get an opportunity to serve it
upon him, who otherwise would very often avoid being served therewith, and so
obstruct the proceedings intended against him: Whereas, if the Writ, or such
like summons, or Intimation be left at the house of the parties habitation,
such occasion of sinning would not only be taken away, but the obstructions in
the trial of suits prevented.

It seems to be not only against the law of God and Nature, but even of common
reason to ask a prisoner at the Bar whether he be guilty or not guilty.

1. In respect that if he answer guilty, he condemns, or rather murders
himself, as much, if he were truly guilty, as if he were innocent.

2. If he be guilty, and answers not guilty, he tells a lie.

3. Though he be guilty, and answer not guilty; and though he be innocent, and
answer not guilty, yet they endeavor by all the means they can to find him
guilty: so that it serves to no purpose, but either to tempt such as are guilty
to tell a lie to save their lives, or else to be accessory to their own death
by their own confession, which unless they will do, they proceed against
them to make them guilty by Witnesses or other Evid^nce; In which respect
whether were it not more Christian like to proceed against Offenders by way of
Witnesses, or other Evidence, if there be any sufficient, without asking the
Prisoner whether he be guilty, or not guilty.

Seven Objections against the trial of Causes by a Jury of 12. men.
1. THere is not a competent number of understanding and fit men to be had in
the lesser Divisions of a County, for trial of all Causes upon all occasions.

2. People are generally unwilling to be called upon for Jurymen, whereby they
neglect their own affairs.

3. Though they do come to avoid the penalty, they seldom take the course to
be rightly qualified and fitted, to judge of the matter in controversy.

4. Most commonly one or two active and nimble-pated men over-sway all the
rest, of the Jury, and too often for the worst.

5. Though never so many of them dissent in judgment from the rest, they must
notwithstandinding all concur in the Verdict, or be wearyed into it.

6. If they give corrupt or erroneous Verdict, there cannot justly be any
penalty inflicted on them, because they may pretend they did at first declare
themselves unfit for such employment: that they undertook it not willingly,
but were compelled thereunto; and when they saw there was no avoiding it, they
endeavored to proceed therein according to the uprightness of their own
consciences, if they be thought to have done amiss, it was but what they could
not remedy, and are heartily sorry for it.

7. The keeping the Jury without fire, light, bread or drink, as the Law
requires, may possibly make the major part of them, if not all, agree upon a
verdict contrary to their consciences to be freed from any of these exigencies,
at least, some of them to strike up with the rest in a joint verdict, since it
is well near impossible for 12. men, all circumstances considered, much more in
a doubtful case, to be of one opinion; and though the case were never so
clear, yet one peremptory man of a strong constitution, whether his judgment
be right or wrong, may sterve all the rest unless they will give verdict as he
will have them.

Wherfeore in regard it is thus troublesome and chargeable for all people
throughout the Land to come up to Westminst. for determining of Lawsuits, and
because a Jury of 12. understanding and upright men are not readily to be had
at all times, in every Hundred, or such like Division, for the speedy deciding
of such Differences as may arise: It is humbly propounded, that the Commons
assembled in Parliament, out of the great desire they have, as much as in them
lies, to make this Nation happy, by endeavoring, so far as is possible, that
the people of all ranks may live in love and friendship one toward another,
for all such differences as shall happen to arise, they may either be composed
in a friendly Christian manner, with mutual approbation of the parties, or
else speedily and frugally determined, according to evidence produced, in
manner following. [viz.]

The Perticulars of what is humbly propounded to be established by Act of
Parliament.

THat in every City, Corporation, and such other divisions of each County
throughout the Land, as the Parliament shall appoint, there shall reside one or
more persons, with the title of Judge or Judges of such City, Corporation, or
Division, to whom in consideration of a yearly salary to be allowed them, it
shall appertain to hear, and determine all matters of Controversy, whether
Civil or Criminal, which shall be brought before them, concerning the public,
or any person within their City, Corporation, or Division, as follows, [viz.]

Whatsoever Person has any difference with another, shall only be at liberty
to sue such person before the Judge, or Judges of such City, Corporation, or
Division where the person to be sued is found present, when the suite is first
commenced, or does usually abide:

And if the person to be sued, has several habitations, then, in such City,
Corporation, or Division as he was known, then, or lately to reside in, before
the suit was commenced; or in any other place where he is notified in person,
at the first Commencement thereof as aforesaid: to which end,

Such person as has a Controversy shall repair unto the respective Judge, or
Judges of the place, or to his or their Clerk, and acquaint him or them, by
whom, and in what manner the public or he himself is injured; Whereupon the
said Judge is to require both parties to appear before him, if they be willing,
and use all possible means by himself, the Minister of the Parish, or such
discreet men as he thinks good, for composing of the difference, if it be
merely Civil, by Joint consent before it be farther proceeded in.

In case the parties cannot be agreed, if the matter in Controversy exceed not
50. s. and the parties have their evidences in readiness, then may the Judge
determine it at the very first hearing, and making a brief record of the whole
proceeding, Ad perpetuam rei memoriam grant sudden execution.

But if it pass the value of 50. s. the party grieved may take the privilege
of putting in his bill, or Demand fairly written in Court, unto the Judge or
Judges, or his, or their Clerk, which ever after is to remain by him, or them,
as in Court upon Record; And the Plaintiff having first caused an Entry of the
said Bill, to be made upon the said Bill, together with the date of the said
Entry, by the Judge, or Clerk, he is than forthwith to take out a Ticket of
Notification, under the said Judge or Clerk's hand, and cause it to be sent by
an Officer for that purpose, unto the person so sued, whereby he may have
notice of such a Bill put in against him, and have two or three days time, to
put in his answer, according to the distance of the place, where he resides,
and the Messenger returning is to make report unto the said Judge, or his Clerk,
that he delivered such a Ticket unto the Party sued in person, or left it with
some person of about the age of twenty, as might rationally be presumed by his,
or her aspect, at the house of his usual habitation, specifying the place
where, and time when, the particulars whereof, the said Judge, or Clerk, is
likewise to make Entry of, upon the said Bill with the Messengers name.

And the Judge, or his Clerk is obliged to give a Copy of any Bill, Answer, or
whatsoever else is entered upon Record in any suite in the said Court under his
hand, unto either of the parties, or to any other desiring them, for such fees
as are hereafter specified.

If the Party so sued and notified appear not, or if appearing puts not in his
Answer, if the Plaintiff desire it, another notification is to be sent him, as
before, to appear and hear judgment given within three days; and the said
notification, and all others, to be entered as aforesaid.

Then if the party sued appear not, upon this latter notification within the
term limited, Judgment for Principal Charges, and Damages, is to be given
according to the Plaintiffs demand, with express mention of the contumacy of
the party sued, and reserving unto the said party sued, his right, what ever it
be, to be made appear in that Court, or any other, when and where the Laws of
the Land shall give him leave.

And if the Plaintiff desires, execution is forthwith to be granted, both
against person and goods, upon the Plaintiffes putting in sufficient security,
unto the Court, to be accountable in case of undue Imprisonment, or for the
whole value thereof, or so much as the person sued and condemned in through
contumacy, shall within three months next ensuing make appear to be unduely
recovered, together with Damages and Charges; And the said execution may be
served by the person himself in whose favor it was granted, or by whomsoever
else he shall employ (provided that both one and other be persons of integrity)
besides the Officers for that purpose, who are to be assisted if need be, by
the Magistrates of the place, that no opposition be made, to impede or delay
the Course of Justice.

But if the party sued appears, and puts in his answer, he is likewise to cause
the Judge or his Clerk to make Entry thereof upon the said Answer, and that a
notification thereof be sent to the Plaintiff, which with the report thereof
is to be Entered as aforesaid.

Then may the Plaintiff reply within the term prescribed, and the Defendant
rejoyn.

In case Witnesses be to be examined, such time is to be allowed, and no more,
then is necessary for the effecting it, as also for producing Evidences from
parts farther distant; And all Witnesses may be examined, whether upon
Intergatories, or otherwise, by the Judge or his Clerk, of the place where the
said Witnesses reside, to be transmitted unto the Court, where the cause
depends.

Which being done, or such term as the Judge had assigned for such purpose,
expired without effect, through negligence of the parties concerned therein,
after a day, two or three, wherein the Judge is to peruse the Process, and
whole proceedings, it is in the liberty of either party to notify the other,
to appear the second or third day according to the distance of the place, and
the Judges leisure, at a convenient hour, for arguing the whole business in
contradictory, before the Judge; And if neither party desire it, the Judge, if
he be not fully informed may notify them, Ex officio, or either of them
singly for the same purpose, to be fully satisfied in whatsoever he shall
desire; and for that end may likewise deliver his doubts or seruples in writing
to either, or both parties, and require answer accordingly, to be afterward
inserted with the rest of the proceedings in Court to remain upon Record.

And if any thing Material be alleged and proved, by this contradictory
debate which did not before appear, the Judge is to Order it to be put in
Writing, and Entered with the other proceedings, notifying the parties thereof.

And in case one party refuse to appear before the Judge, for thus arguing of
the business, in contradictory, he is not afterward to be admitted to produce
any new evidence or proof; but upon request of either of the parties in
Writing, which is to be notified to the other as aforesaid, the Judge is to
proceed, and give judgment both for Principal, Damages, and Charges,
according to what appears to be alleged and proved, and sudden execution to
be granted, at that very Instant, against body and goods, unless the party
condemned being present, or any body in his name, sufficiently authorized
thereunto, appeal from such Judgment of the Division Court, unto the Judges of
the Shire-Town, which it shall be lawful for him to do, within 8. days next
following, and there to prosecute the same in manner hereafter specified.

And if the party condemned appeal before execution be granted, then must he,
in whose favor the Judgment was, desiring execution, first put in sufficient
security to stand to such farther judgment, as the Court, to which the appeal
is made, shall think good to pass, to be entered with the rest of the
proceedings, otherwise not.

The Appeallant therefore is to Enter his appeal in writing, to be kept with
the other proceedings, where the Judgment was given; and that Judge, or his
Clerk is forthwith to give him a Copy thereof under his hand, as also of the
whole proceedings, or of so much as is desired, so soon as it can conveniently
be made, which the Appeallant is to transmit unto the Court of the Shire-Town,
where it is to be admitted upon the Appeallants putting in sufficient security
unto the Court of the Shire-Town, that he will effectually prosecute the said
Appeal within eight days following, and be liable to such Charges, penalty,
and otherwise, as that Court shall condemn him in, in case he be found to have
appealed unduely.

And it shall be likewise lawful for both parties to appeal from one and the
same Judgment in such part thereof as they apprehend themselves agrieved, and
prosecute the same in such manner as aforesaid; and the Shire-Court in such
case obliged to observe the same Orders concerning Fines and Charges as
aforesaid.

This being done, and the appeal admitted, notification thereof is to be made
unto the party, in whose favor the Judgment was granted, in the
Hundred-Court, who is to answer to this appeal in the Shire-Court; and the
whole proceedings, and Process to be framed as aforesaid, in the Hundred-Court.

And if nothing more Material be alleged and proved, than what was before in
the Hundred Court; If the Judge of the Shire Court shall see good to confirm the
said Judgment of the Hundred Court, he is likewise obliged to condemn the
Appeallant in all manner of Charges, and one sixth part more then the business
in controversy amounted to, by way of penalty, to the use of him that had both
Judgments in favor, and execution forthwith to be had accordingly.

But if no new matter being alleged and proved, the Judge of the Shire Court
shall see cause to reverse the Judgment of the Hundred Court, in the whole or
in part, the Defendant in the Shire Court is not to be condemned in Charges
disbursed since the Appeal to the said Court; but the Judge of the Hundred
Court, for his unjust, or erroneous Judgment, is to be fined so much, as the
Charges of both parties, in the Shire Court, amounted to, and so much more as
the full Damages of the Appeallant will any ways amount to, with speedy
execution as abovesaid.

And in case new matter be alleged, and proved, for which cause the Judgment
happens to be altered in part, or in the whole, than the Defendant is not to be
condemned in Charges, nor the Hundred Judge in any Fine, so far as the new
matter alleged, and proved, was cause thereof.

And if the Judge or Judges of the Shire Court shall pass unjust or erroneous
judgment, such judgment shall notwithstanding be valid, ultimate, and binding,
in respect to the parties litigant, and have sudden execution both against body
and goods of the party condemned, without putting in security, as was before
required.

And if either, or both parties find themselves agrieved, it shall be lawful
for them, or either of them to addres themselves unto the Parliament, against
such Judge or Judges of the Shire Court, who hereby are made accomptable, and
liable to be condemned in all manner of Damages, cost and charges, such party
or parties complaining against them, shall have suffered through their unjust
erroneous Judgment, be put by their Office, and suffer such other punishment,
as the Justice and wisdom of the Parliament, think good to inflict upon them.

But if any person shall be found to have without cause Appealed from the Shire
Court, and unjustly to have accused the Judge, or Judges thereof in Parliament,
then shall the said Judge or Judges be absolved.

And such person be liable to be condemned by the Parliament in the same
penalties, which he required, by way of demand, to be inflicted on the said
Judge, or Judges, and sudden execution to be granted, to the use and benefit of
the said Judge or Judges only, together with their full Charges to be rated by
authority of Parliament, and all other Charges to be likewise rated by the
respective Courts, where Judgment was given for payment of them.

The Judge, or Judges of the Division or Shire Court are obliged hereby, if
either of the parties desire it, to draw out the motives in brief, which swayed
them in giving such judgment, to remain upon Record, together with the
Process; and so soon as any suit is fully ended, whether in the Hundred, or
Shire Court, all papers and proceedings are to be made up by themselves, and
bound together with others orderly, according to the date of the Judgment, in
as great a Volume as is well manageable, with an Alphabet at the end thereof,
specifying the names both of the Plaintiffs and Defendants.

And in case the Judge or Judges of the Hundred, or Shire Courts should dye,
whilst any unjust or erroneous Judgment rested depending upon appeal, then the
respective Heirs, Executors, or administrators of the said Judge or Judges,
shall become liable unto all Penalties and Fines which happen to be inflicted;
by reason of such unjust and erroneous judgment, whether by the Shire Court or
Parliament; Provided such Appeals were made to the Shire Court, within the
eight days before specified, and unto the Parliament then sitting if there were
any, or else unto the next Parliament ensuing such unjust and erroneous
judgment.

And concerning all suits which shall be primarily Commenced, in the Shire
Court, and brought thither by Appeal; they are totally to be managed, in all
other respects and circumstances, as was before prescribed, concerning such
causes, as were commenced, prosecuted, and determined in the Hundred Courts.

And it is expressly hereby Enacted, that no Judge, or Judges Clerk shall take
any other, then the fees hereby allowed, nor other moneys, or any manner of
thing money-worth, from any person whomsoever: And that no person shall give,
or so much as offer to any Judge or Clerk, greater fees then are hereby allowed,
nor money, nor any thing money-worth, upon penalty both to taker and giver, of
being condemned in twenty times the value unto the discoverer, by the next
Hundred Court, or any other within the said Shire, where the fact was done, and
before which the party shall be accused, besides the forfeiture of Place, or
Office unto the Judge and Clerk so offending; and the Giver or Taker not only to
escape unpunished, for the first time, upon discovery of the other, but also to
enjoy the benefit as Discoverer.

And the said Judge, or Judges, and their Clerk shall take no other fees, than
these that follow, [viz.]

Whereby in one word is meant, no other or larger fees than barely after the
rate of so much a sheet, as other men will be contented with, to copy out in a
fair handwriting, such Bills and Answers, as Plaintiff, Defendant, or any
other person shall desire copies of; the said Judges or their Clerks being to
receive such Salaries out of the Public Treasury, as may prove a large and
full maintenance for themselves and Families.

FVRTHER CONSIDERATIONS.
COnsider who shall choose the Judges; whether the Representative, and the
Council of State, in the Intervalls, or the People of each Division.

May it not be best that the People choose them not, lest they make choice of
such as may be swayed with alliance, of one kind or other, and whether a Judge
that were the greatest stranger to them, might not prove best, and such Judges
moveable from one place to another, every third or fifth year, to prevent all
engagements of alliance or acquaintance.

If the Representative or Council of State in the Intervals choose: whether is
it best to have them fixed, quam diu se been gesserint; or moveable of course
every 3. or 5. year, from one Division or Shire Court unto another, to prevent
the gaining of alliance to oversway them: But if they should be quite cashiered
at three or 5. years end, or upon any other cause than misbehaviour of some
kind or other, they would then be disappointed of a livelihood, and though they
deserved never so well, be more unhappy than men of any other Calling.

It being requisite that the Judges in their respective Residencies with the
under Officers, should attend the duties on every week day, and all day long
at seasonable hours; It is necessary for them to have a competent and full
maintenance allowed them, to prevent all manner of Distractions and Temptations.

Querie. Whether the Shire Court if found erroneous, ought not to be repealed?
If no, it may induce the party upon a weighty trial to corrupt the Judge the
rather: And yet if the Judge impeach him for giving bribes, he is likewise
fineable more than the Judgment imported: and the sooner a definitive Judgment
may be had, upon good grounds, the better.

FINIS.
