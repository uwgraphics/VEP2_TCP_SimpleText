The mutual joys of the King, Parliament, and Subjects.
THe sadness and disasterousnesse of the times, the continual harsh tone of
invective persons, and the present distresses of all men, have a long time
looked for, hoped and expected a removal of these our grievances, being often
begun, but more often hindered, there never springing one good and profitable
herb in this garden of England, but there as suddenly arises many twining
weeds to choke it; since that our disconsolate cares have been so invoked to
provide for resistance of these evils, how welcome and acceptable would the
news of a remedy be, the City that has so long been troubled, frighted, and
perturbed with civil commotions, and inexpressible dangers, how would it show
forth the garlands of good will, the plumes of peace, and ensign of loyalty
upon so happy an alteration? How would the Protestant rejoice, and be as it
were involved in gladness, to see the Papists and their schismatic
adherents either converted or ashamed, when as Church government might be
respected, and God praised, for love, and not for fear. Such is the news I
now relate, so happy, as it goes beyond expression to nominate it, and as real
as it seems happy. Long have these our griefs been multiplied by his
Majesty's disagreeing with the Parliament by the persuasions of some who were
but seeming well wishers to the State: to change these occasions of sorrow into
a happy estate, his Majesty has been since graciously pleased to unite
himself with them for the settling of a perfect peace, expressing himself as
follows.

That whereas the perturbance of the times had proved grievous and burdensome
unto him, in respect of the quotidiall commotions arising through his
non-residence with them at London, his Majesty was resolved for a speedy
return: as also that his hopes of and concerning the gracious message sent the
twentieth of January last past, should have produced some such effect, as by
offering what was fit on their parts to do, as also for his Majesty to grant,
might beget a mutual confidence in each other, his Majesty therefore desired
that these his good hopes might not be frustrated, and so his endeavors prove
to no purpose, but rather that they would with sedulous diligence labor to
strengthen and corroborate, then any way to debilitate or weaken the same
reciprocal conjunction or mutual laborious cooperation. And for as much as
this his Majesty's Kingdom of England was very much distressed, and in
continual fear, in respect that the Ports and chief fortresses toward the
sea coasts were unfortified, and so not able to make resistance against any
invasion, they having manifested as much unto his Majesty, he desired that
they would speedily set about and expeditiously contrive a remedy, and he in
that as in all other reasonable motions (as far as it might stand with his
honor) would immutually join in assistance toward the rectifying of the same.

As for the Petitions of several Counties delivered to the Parliament for the
relief of these and other such like grievances of this Kingdom, most
especially concerning the grounds of Protestant Religion which has been abused
and little set by since the Bishops introducing and bringing in of Papisticall
ceremonies, which sticks much in the consciences of many, nay all true
Protestants, his Majesty was graciously pleased to desire and importune a
reformation of the same, thereby to gain his subjects love, and procure the
perpetual peace of his Kingdom.

It was the refore ordered by the House of Commons as concerning Wren and the
other Bishops whom they had searched and found deep delinquents in and against
the benefit of the State, that seeing they were found guilty, and the matter of
so high consequence (concerning their censure) they being the Metropolitans of
the Church, and principal Clergy of the Kingdom, that they should be
delivered over to the upper House to receive sentence fro^m them as concerning
their misdemeanors, whereupon they resolved a speedy conclusion; the
Parliament highly applauding and commending the Communalty of the several
Counties petitioning them unto for their indulgent care for the preservation
and safety of his Majesty's Royal person, Realms and Parliamentary
proceedings, who with the fervency of zeal, and affection regreeted them with
all humility giving them most humble thanks for their obsequious care of such
as they were, who accounted themselves but as their vassalls that were ready to
spend both life, limb, estate, liberty, and what not to show their respectfull
obeisance to such an honorable Assembly.

A true Relation of a sudden muteny arising amongst the rebels in Ireland at
Bravers within the Province of Munster, wherein Sergeant Major Oneale was sore
hurt, Captain Redmond Sartwell, Captain Thurlough King, Captain Carley, with
diverse Officers, and 300. soldiers slain.
As also their flight from thence upon the coming of Captain Pollard and some
Scotch regements against them, with the loss of the Town, and all their
ammunition to our English forces.
Upon the first of February Anno Dom. 2642. the Rebels having lately
apprehended some eighteen Protestants in the town of Oggersney in the County
of Munster carried them before the Lord Corton who was chosen Lieutenant
General of their horse to be examined as concerning their Religion, which they
boldly averred to be the Protestant faith, in which they resolved to live and
dye, whereupon they were forthwith committed to prison, where they lay in a
dungeon, enduring great misery through the abuse of the soldiery that
delighted in nothing more then in tormenting them; the principal of all these
Protestants was Sir Edward Pellam who had a son in law (being a recusant)
eldest Captain of a horse troop in the regiment belonging to the Lord Autrim,
who very earnestly desired of the Lord Corton, Oneale, and the residue of the
council of war, sitting about that occasion that he might stand as bail for
his fathers appearance, moving it with such zeal and earnest ^ff^ction toward
his father, that he had almost obtained his request, until that one Dennis
Carley Sergeant Major to the said regiment and Captain Carley his nephew, with
diverse other enemies to the Protestants, persuaded the contrary, alleging that
being an enemy to their Religion and present proceeding, it might be a means
to his escape, and the other his son who pleaded for him likewise, who showed
very little affection to the Church of Rome to plead so much for a heretic,
though he had been his own father, therefore they desired that he might
likewise be examined unless he might be one of their confederacy, which they
did, but nothing being found wherein that to condemn him, nevertheless he was
sentenced to be committed to close prison, which the soldiers understanding of
whom he was very much beloved, and considering the injustice of the cause came
with one consent upon the council of war, and per fas aut nefas delivered
him, withal falling into such an abrupt mutiny, being instigated and egged
forward by Captain Bolte, whom they had freed, who was eager of revenge on his
enemies, that they desperately hurt Oneale, slew both the Carleyes, Captain
Sartwel and Captain King their companions, and three hundred soldiers: he in
the mean time getting through the press, gave intelligence to Captain
Pollard commanding a company of Scots, who with others came to the town, upon
the intelligence of whose approach the Rebels fled, notwithstanding they
spared not to vent their spleen upon the poor Protestants, whom they
massacred and cut all to pieces, leaving in the town through haste and fear
of being overtaken the most part of their arms, three small field pieces with
their carriages, ten wagons with ammunition, as also the traice horses to draw
them, which proved the spoil to the Scotch Protestants.

FINIS.
