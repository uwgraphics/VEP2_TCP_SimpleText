A GLASS AND SALVE FOR PROFESSORS Held to them.

By William Voile Minister of the Gospel.

James 1. 23, 24. If any be a hearer of the Word, and not a doer, he is like
unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass. For he beholds himself, and
goes his way, and straight way forgets what manner of man he was. Revel. 3.

the Author, 1668.

WILLIAM VOILE, A Servant of Jesus Christ in the Ministry of his Gospel, To all
those of His Majesty's Subjects that are called Professors, because they do
profess (or practice) the Protestant Religion in a way more or less differing
from the most common way, Greeting.
BEloved, it is now above forty nine years, since I was first a Preacher: since
which time I have had so much, and such communion with the Professors of
England and Wales, that I have attained much knowledge of Professors of most
ways in the Protestant Religion, and committed very many of my Observations to
writing, especially the faults of them. I have preached to, Professors, and
heard others preach to them, and considered my own preaching and theirs, (what
and how we have preached) and the success of our preaching. I have hearkened,
and heard, and seen, and considered, who have preached aright, or made such use
as ought to be made of that which has been preached, and who has repented and
reformed, Jer. 8. 6. The resu't whereof was this: I looked on the sins of
Professors, as the procuring cause of their Troubles and Afflictions, and the
greatest let of their Prayers (...) the liberty and Peace of Professors, and
judged it a work fit for Preachers, to exhort Professors, not only, to humble
themselves for their sins and failings, but also to strive and give diligence
to cease from them, and to reform their ways according to the word of God
universally, without any exception or reservation. Which Truths I did also
publish about two years since in an Eminent City, and have now by this honest
Treatise endeavored to make them known to others, and to show you the ends and
meaning of our heavenly Father in chastising you and me; to the end that ye may
hear his Rods with understanding, and [him] who has appointed them, (Mic. 6.
9.) and so as to submit your selves to him unreservedly (Jam.4. 7.) to do and
to leave undone altogether according to the Message which he has sent you. And
I beseech you all, by the mercies of God, let me obtain these requests of you.
1. Let me not be accounted an enemy to (any of) you, because I judge rightly of
the greatest and most perilous of your enemies, your sins, and because I tell
you of them; (for I do this to warn you of your danger, that you may judge your
selves, and abstain from your sins, that ye may not be condemned with the
World, Gal. 4. 16. 1 Cor. 11. 32.) 2. Strive in your prayers unto God for me,
as one of your faithful friends, that, whilst I live on earth, I may be
thoroughly willing and well able to do Jesus Christ and his Church service. 3.
For the honor of the most high God, and the credit of his Gospel, and your own
good, and the good of your Posterity, (Deuteronomy. 5. 29.) and of all Christ's people,
use the most effectual means ye can, to persuade and induce every one himself,
and all those to whom I ha^^ directed this Epistle, to peruse this Treatise all
over, and that seriously, and in the fear of God, and in much Humility,
consulting with God and one with another about it, and praying fervently unto
God, to give them a right understanding and a sound judgment, and resolving
with a strong resolution (by Gods assistance) to do the will of God
unreservedly. For this is the way to know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God
or not, John 7. 17.

Beloved, I shall hope, that this work of mine, will (in some measure) help to
open the eyes of the blind, and to cause the lame to walk, and the dumb to
speak, and that, by my means (among other good works) very worthy men that are
dead, shall speak unto you words very good to the use of edifying, which no man
else will help them to speak unto you. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all.

Amen.
A GLASS and SALVE FOR PROFESSORS.
BEloved Brethren and Sisters, rich and poor, hearken. Although the great God,
in whose hands the times of all the Creatures are, Psalm. 31. 15. changes not,
Mal. 3. 6. but is the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever, Heb. 13. 8. and
albeit, the darkness and the light be both alike to him, Ps. 139. 12. yet the
Creatures are changeable and actually changed, and their times are not all of
one Ad^m, there is a time to get, and a time to lose; a time to laugh, and a
time to mourn; (times of health, and times of sickness;) a time to live, and a
time to die, Eccl. 3. 1. etc. Men and Women have good days, 1 Pet. 3. 10. and
evil days, Ephesians. 5. 16. and perilous times, 2 Timothy 3. 1. etc. and, in Solomon's
language, Eccl. 7. 13, 14. days of Prosperity, and days of Adversity: Where
he counsels us, ver. 14. To consider the work of God, D. We ought to
consider the works of God, of all sorts; and v. 13. In the day of Prosperity,
to be joyful, D. Times of Prosperity do in a special manner call for joy; and
in the day of adversity, to consider, D. meaning, that, As we ought to consider
in times of all sorts, so especially in times of Adversity. And such is this
time to this Nation, especially to them who are called Phanaticks; and among
them to us who have been Ministers of the Gospel.

Quest. And what ought we to consider in this time of Adversity?

Answ. These nine things. 1. The severals whereof our Adversity consists,
Marg. 3. 2. That no part of it came upon us without God, Mat. 10. 29, 30, 31.
but every part of it, according to his providence and the counsel of his will,
Ephesians. 1. 11. Marg. 11. 3. That our heavenly Father in giving way to men, etc.
has not dealt unjustly with us, nor done us any wrong, Marg. 16. 4. That in
afflicting us he has done wisely, and therefore afflicted us for fit ends,
Marg. 18. 5. We must consider, Why and for what ends he has afflicted us?
Marg. 18. These five things we ought to consider, that we may not despise his
chastening, Prove. 2. 11, 12. nor harbor hard thoughts of him: and that we may
discern what course to take for the bettering of our Estate. 6. We ought to
consider, what means we have used to better it, or to prevail with God to
better it, Marg. 90. 7. We must consider the success and issue of those means,
how far we have prevailed by using them, and how far not, Marg. 92. 8. If our
Estate has not thereupon been changed fully, according to our desires and
requests; then we are to consider, Why God has not heard them to the full?
what has hindered them, and made them so far forth uneffectual? especially,
whether iniquities and sins have hindered them? and, if sins, whose sins, and
which of their sins? Es. 59. 1, 2. Marg. 93. All which things being considered.
9. And lastly, it concerns us to open our eyes, to see, and to consider what
course it concerns us to take hereafter, and when? what to do, what to amend,
and how? what to cease from, etc. Marg. 94.

Now as to the first of these, I have known when our Trading was altogether) so
dead, and so much hindered; when many of the poorer sort had more work, and
many of the richer sort more money; when many were better able to maintain
their Children, and to bind them Apprentices, and to furnish them with moneys
for Trading, and to make them Scholars, when many were more able to pay their
Rents and other debts; when Houses and Lands were set and sold at higher Rates
without wronging the Takers and Buyers; when the total of our public Taxes and
payments was not ( altogether) so great as now ( to some) it seems to be, etc.
When so many of this Nation were not taken away by the Pestilence, and by and
in Sea-actions impoverished, maimed, wounded, killed, and deprived of their
Husbands, Fathers, Children, and Apprentices; and when so many Churches, and
public Houses, and so many private Houses have not been burnt, and so much (
worldly) Riches destroyed in London in so few days as of late in 1666. have
been. But all these and some other evils are common to us with others, Prove.
28. 12, 28.

2. Some of us have been deprived (and do continue destituted) of Livelihood
and maintenance, and are forbidden to teach or table Scholars, (although (
peradventure) we might in that way be somewhat beneficial to the Church and
Commonwealth.)

3. Some of us are separated from London, and all other Cities, and many Tows
which are not Cities etc.

4. No private Meetings, etc. under the pain of Banishment into etc.

5. If we Administer either of the Sacraments, we must pay more than some of us
be very well able to spare, etc.

6. The fellowship which we have had together in the Gospel, must be broken
often, and the spiritual benefits which we might have gotten by conversing
together lost, Beside the losses of Luke the 8. 2, 3.

7. This is a time of extraordinary Temptations to us and others. Many
professors, especially Preachers, are tempted to sin against their Consciences,
to get places of worldly profit, and to bear sinfully with the sins of
Professors, lest they should lose the help of their Purses, others are tempted
to avenge themselves, to oppress, to use cruelty.

8. I think, the last twenty years and upwards are part of the perilous times,
whereof St. Paul prophecyeth, in 2 Timothy 3. in the first 7 Verses, beginning
with, This know also, as speaking of that which is very fit to be known, and to
be considered very seriously. This know also (says he) that in the last days
perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves,
covetous, boasters, proud. Having a form of Godliness, but denying the power
thereof, which words I do underst and of many of those who have gotten the name
of Professors, as well as of others, and that, because so many do walk and
behave themselves, as if Godliness were of no great power to better a man's
conversation.

9. If none of the late Decrees, and the Outings and Restraints do (in any
measure, directly nor indirectly) tend unto the decay of that which the Book of
Common Prayer calls Gods true Religion and virtue; yet before the time of the
Interruption there were, who, under the pretense of reconciling two Religions,
sought to undermine and destroy the better of the twain: and in the time of the
Interruption, Corrupters and new Lights, who did hatch Cockatrice Eggs,
Ranters, (Familists) Quakers: and part of that evil work was done (I doubt not)
in Policy of purpose to undermine and destroy Truths. In a word, there have
been these last thirty years and more, and still (I believe) are some, whose
working ( partly in the dark) has been and is such, that as the Psalmist
says, Psalm. 119. 126. It is time for thee Lord to work, for they have made
void God's Law: So may we well say, It is time for the Lords Servants to work
for, and with God: for there are some that would gladly destroy the true
Gospel: So that, if the plot to burn and Massacre, be but a Dream, or mere
imagination (as I would have Charity not to be suspicious, and to think evil, 1
Cor. 13. 5, 7. without some just cause:) yet there is cause enough, why
Professors, yea all Protestants and Anti-papists should pull their eyes out of
their pockets, and carry them in the forepart of their heads; that they may
see where to place their feet, (how to order their goings) yea (if they can) to
be altogether as wise as Serpents, Mat. 10. 16. [yet not to tread in the steps
of D. Parry, who against all Reason, did conspire Treason foul and base.]
Digression.) Before I speak of the second, give me leave (by the way) to show
what good use ye who are Professors, may make of some things before mentioned,
in respect of your spiritual Estate; as Lot did (or might have done) of the
vexing of his soul with the unlawful deeds and speeches of his Neighbors, the
Sodomites, (2 Pet. 2. 7, 8.) for thereby he might discern his soul to be a
righteous soul: and so may ye discern in some measure the temper and
disposition of your spirits, and consequently your spiritual estate, by the
movings or stillness of your hearts in this time of such evils; hearken
therefore I beseech you, to that which I shall say unto you; especially, all
those of you who have not hitherto at any time duly tried your spiritual
estate, which, I fear, has been the folly of many Christians.

1. Let your Consciences tell you, how ye are affected with those Jesus Christ,
with the loss of their maintenance, and their now very low condition. Are ye
really grieved at it? If ye be not, ye are but mean Professors, Amos 6. 6.

2. How are ye affected with their loss of so many opportunities, of drawing so
many godless persons out of the Kingdom of darkness, into the Kingdom of grace,
unto Gods honor, and the lost sheeps everlasting salvation? Is it nothing to
you that their Parishes, and the Nation, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have so far
lost their Ministry? Jude 5. 23. Why Brethren? our Savior (and the same mind
ought to be in you, which was in him, Ph. 2. 5. 1 John 3. 3.) he had compassion
on those who were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd; and thereupon
said unto his Discip^es, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are
few: Pray ye therefore the Lord of the Harvest, to send forth laborers into
his Harvest, Mat. 9. 36, 37. Verily those of you, friends, who are not sorry
for the outing of so many Ministers of Jesus Christ, their Parishes, and the
Nation, (and the Preachers personal losses) all such of you are sorry
Professors.

3. How do your hearts stir within you, every one in regard of his own
particular estate? Are any of you glad, that ye are likely to hord up the more
money, etc. do any of you fear the departure of the five miled Ministers will
be a considerable damage to you in your spiritual estate? For Job did esteem
Gods word above the necessary food [of his body] chap. 23. 12. and the Lord by
Amos, chap. 8. 11, 12. speaks of a famine of hearing the word, as a more
mischievous famine and evil, than that of bodily food: and Isa. chap. 30. 20.
says to Gods people, And though the Lord gives you the bread of Adversity and
water of Affliction; yet (says he) (to sweeten their sufferings) thy Teachers
shall not be removed into a corner any more, but thy eyes shall see thy
Teachers: Beloved, Job dwelt where there were no great store of good Professors
to counsel and encourage him, and to be a good example to him. Bu^ he was
taught of God, to have due respect to his own spiritual welfare, which many
have not yet learned to have.

4. Are ye grieved in heart, that ye have not made better use of the
opportunities

5. What use are ye resolved to make of them hereafter, before they be enforced
to leave you? For a wise man will make use of skilful and conscientious
Physicians concerning his body, and of such Lawyers concerning his worldly
estate, whilst they dwell near him, especially, when he knows or fears, they
will shortly go to dwell far from him. But truly, I cannot say, I have observed
such Ant-like good Husbandry to have been much practiced of Professors, Prove.
6. 6, 7, 8.

6. What course do you purpose to take for your spiritual welfare, and the good
of your souls, when such Ministers are departed and gone from you?

7. How often, and how heartily have ye hitherto prayed for them, and given
thanks to God for them, as men who have broken to you the bread of everlasting
life? What have ye asked of God for them? Are ye resolved to pray for them
hereafter? What, and how frequently do ye purpose so to do?

8. Have any of you blamed any of them for not dealing more faithfully, or more
plainly with you concerning your sins? Col. 4. 17. 2 Timothy 5. 1. So much by the
way for your good.

2. In the second place, we are all to consider, that all the aforesaid evils
came upon us, not without our Heavenly Father, but according to his Government.
1. Affliction comes not forth of the dust, neither does trouble come out of
the ground, Job 5. 6. 2. God is present every where, in all places, and sees,
hears, and knows all the words, and thoughts of the children of men, Psalm. 139.
7. to the 12. Heb. 4. 13. So that he cannot be ignorant of any thing which is
done, spoken, or devised concerning us, or any of us. 3. Power belongs unto
God, Psalm. 62. 11. and so belongs unto him, that in the holy Scriptures, the
Kingdom and the power is said to be his, Mat. 6. 13. and so, that he is called
the only Potentate, 1 Timothy 6. 15. and all the Nations of the earth, compared to
him, said to be as a drop of a Bucket, or as the small dust of the balance,
yea before him, as nothing, yea to him counted less than nothing, and vanity,
Es. 40. 15, 16, 17. and his hand is not shortened (or weakened) that it cannot
save, Es. 59. and, when he is pleased to work, none can turn it back and hinder
it, Es. 59. 1. and 43, 13. and if he be for us, none can prevail against us,
Romans 8. 31. neither can God be compelled to do any thing, or to leave ought
undone, or to yield or give way to the desire or purpose of any creature or
creatures, times are in his hand, Psalm. 31. 15. All good things and all.
Afflictions do proceed out of his mouth, Lam. 3. 38. that is, according to his
secret appointment, either acting them, or voluntarily permitting them, and
giving way to the desires and purposes of creatures to act them. Neither is
there any evil that is Affliction) in a City [or in the Country] which the LORD
has not done, Amos 3. 6. Even Satan (with all his strength and cunning) could
not afflict Job in any kind, in the least measure, without a Commission from
the Almighty, nor when he had a commission from him, go one inch beyond it,
Job. 1. and 2. Neither could the Devils Jesus Christ gave them leave, Mark 5.
12, 13. And the Government of God is extended to the smallest matters; as Lots,
Prove. 16. 33. a Sparrow falls not to the ground without him, Mat. 10. 29. and
the very hair of our head are all numbered, v. 30. and do not fall from us
without him. The LORD also, Es. 45. 7. says, I form the light, and create
darkness, I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things; and
Lam. 3. 37. We see, that whosoever says, this or that shall come to pass, it
comes not to pass, unless the Lord commands it: as David said of Shimei, The
LORD has bidden him, saying, curse David! 2 Samuel 16. 10, 11. and whatsoever
the LORD pleased, that he did (says the Psalmist) in Heaven, and in Earth, in
the Seas, and in all deep places, Psalm. 135. 6. He is able to give a new heart,
and a new spirit to the greatest sinners; to blasphemers, oppressors, perjured
persons, and persecutors, as he did to Adam and Manasses, and to Saul,
afterward called Paul; yea of stones to raise up Children to Abraham, Mat. 3
9. and, without that blessed change, to restrain and repress the lewd desires,
and affections, and purposes of Heathens, and Idolaters, during what time
soever he pleases. For he promised the Israelites, that at the three high
Feasts of the year, when all their Males were to appear before the LORD, no man
should desire their land, Exodus 34. 23, 24. and Solomon says, when a man's
ways please the LORD, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him,
Prove. 16. 7. [Job 1 21. and 2. 10. 2 Samuel 12. 11, 12. 1 Kings 22. 19, 24. Psalm.
39. 9. and 75. 6, 7. Prove. 16. 1, 9, 33. and 21. 30. Jer. 10. 23. and 34. 22.]
It is not then without the determinate counsel and the providence of God, that
these afflictions be come upon us.

Qu. What shall we say then of those men that afflict us?

Ans. What shall we say? why, that which the Spirit of Truth teaches us to
say: and he in the holy Scriptures says, that Shishak, King of Egypt, came up
against Jerusalem, because Rehoboam (King of Judah) and his subjects had
transgressed against the LORD, 2 Chronicles. 12. 1, 2, 3, 4. and God calls the
Assyrians the Rod of his anger (to own people, whom they did molest and
persecute) and says, That the staff in their hand, is his indignation, [to
wit, against his own people.] Isa. 10. 6. etc. and Psalm. 17. 13, 14. The holy
Spirit of God by the Psalmist calls wrong-doers, Gods hand, and Gods sword,
because they be managed, led, and overruled of God, as a mighty man manageth
his own hands, or a sword, club, staff or rod in them: So that they cannot so
much as hurt any one of their neighbors, either godly or ungodly, or their
cattle, but when the most high God has (secretly) bidden them do it, as David
spoke of Shemei, 2 Samuel 16. 10, 11. And what is the meaning of Isa. 10. 15? Is
it not this, That the Assyrians, in the works which they did against the
Israelites, were to the Almighty, no other than, as the Ax to him who heweth
with it, the saw to the Sawier who saweth with it, and the rod and staff to
them who whip and beat others with them? Who can deny this construction of that
verse? And so much of the second particular.

3. Thirdly, That we may go forward to the end of this business, without hard
thoughts of God, or charging him foolishly ( Job 1. 21.) let us steadfastly
believe, and seriously consider, That he, in giving way so far to the desires,
purposes, devices and enterpizes of men, has not dealt unjustly with any of
us, nor done any of us any wrong. For, 1. He is righteous in all his ways and
works, Psalm. 145. 17. and does not afflict or grieve any of the children of
men, causless, or merely for his pleasure. (so we are to understand the words
of Jeremy, Lam. 3. 33.) 2. They who now are converted came into the world, as
the Reprobates did. They were shapen in iniquity, and conceived in sin (Psalm.
51. 5.) and born flesh, Joh. 3. 6. That is, wholly and altogether carnal and
fleshly, and corrupt, dead in trespasses and sins, Ephesians. 2. 1, 5. and prone and
apt by nature to conceive evil desires, purposes and imaginations, and only
such continually, Genesis 6. 5. and to trespass in the most monstrous and horrible
sins that are, and that in the grossest and foulest manner that can be, without
any shame, or fear, or remorse of conscience, and even to despite the spirit of
Grace, and to commit the sin against the holy Ghost, and so were by nature the
children of Gods wrath, even as others, Ephesians. 2. 3. subject and obnoxious to the
everlasting curse and endless wrath of God. 3. Neither Justification, nor the
new. Birth, does bring with it an inward sanctification which is perfect in
Phil. 3. 12, 13. Prove. 20. 9. but the forementioned base proneness unto sin
remains, in some measure, in the best Christians; and all graces are somewhat
imperfect, unto the end of this life, Romans 7. 14, 15, 18, 19, 21, 24. neither
do the most knowing Christians know otherwise than in part, 1 Cor. 13. 12. and
8. 2. 4. And hence it comes to pass, that we offend, actually, in many things,
all (of us) Jam. 3. 2. 1 John 1. 8, 10. Mat. 6. 11, 12. even the holiest, and,
for spiritual strength, the strongest of us; and that the holiest services and
actions of the holiest persons be mingled with some corruptions and sin, and so
none of them perfectly well performed, but all imperfectly, Psalm. 119. 96. We
have all cause to say, as Ezra, Chap. 9. 13. Our God has punished us less than
our iniquities deserve; yea, that he or she of us who has sinned least, has
deserved much more tribulation, than our most gracious God has laid on any of
us. What may be said more of Gods wrath, as deserved by Profess^rs: See Marg.
30.

4. Fourthly, We must believe and consider, That God, who does Psalm. 104. 24.
has done wisely in afflicting us, and therefore afflicted us for good and fit
ends.

5. The fifth thing to be considered is, why and for what causes and ends the
Lord our God has suffered all the evils before mentioned to come upon us? For
he does not so much as give way to the desires of men, without some sufficient
cause, ( as it were, moving him thereunto) nor without some fit ends whereat he
aims, and for which he gives way to them. By fit ends, I mean, fit in
respect, either of his own honor and glory, or of the good of God's people, or
of some of them. Now concerning this matter, I beseech you, Friends, as ye
desire to escape, and to have your Brethren escape God's wrath, hearken to, and
consider, what I shall say unto you.

Take heed ye be not deceived by the grand Impostors; Satan, the Flesh, Sin,
the World and your own hearts. For, 1. Satan did beguile Eve through his
(Serpentine) subtilty, Gen 3. 2 Cor. 11. 3. even when he had nothing in her (
Joh. 14. 30.) and does blind the eyes of many, lest the light of the Gospel
should shine unto them, 2 Cor. 4. 4. 2. The flesh lusts against the spirit,
Gal. 5. 17. as it were, continually, and our worldly lusts are to the eyes of
the mind, as dust (stirred up by a Regiment of Horse marching) (1 Pet. 2. 11.)
or smoke to the eyes of the body; keeping us from discerning so clearly as
otherwise we might, between truth and error, and hiding the truth from us; and
Ephesians. 4. 32. the old man is said to be corrupt according to the deceitful lasts.
3. Because sin is very deceitful, therefore the Apostle calls on us, to exhort
one another daily, lest any of us be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin,
Heb. 3. 13. 4. The world also (if ye take not great heed) will hide your eyes
from your own sins, and deceive you, as it did Demas, 2 Timothy 4. 10. 5. Lastly,
the heart of man is deceitful above all things, Jer 17. 9. so that he that
trusts in his own heart, is a fool, Prove. 28. 26.

Verily, Friends, we are (through self-love and folly) apt o impute to impute
the afflictions which are common to us with others, wholly to the sins of
others, and in no measure to our own sins. And I believe, many a man and woman
of you does not know, and duly consider, how far forth the afflictions of this
time be to be imputed to his and her sins: and therefore I beseech you again,
yea, I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the
living and the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdom; all of you, take all due
care, and give all diligence, to know why, and to what ends it is, that God
has and does afflict us; and particularly, every one of you, to discern what
hand his sins and failings have had in bringing the said afflictions upon us,
and to hear the Rod, and [him] who has appointed it, Mic. 6. 9.

Now, if ye would know, what ends God aims at in afflicting us, what ends he
aims at in afflicting men (indefinitely) Professors, or not Professors. And
for this;

1. As all things are of him, and for him, Romans 11. 36. as he made all things
for himself, Prove. 16. 4. so, being a God of judgment, Isa. 30. 18. he does all
his works in wisdom, Psalm. 104. 24. and in them all, aims at his own glory,
or the good of those whom he has given to his Son, Romans 8. 28. or both. 2.
But, speaking more particularly, God sends men punishments, chastisements and
troubles, for these causes and ends:

1. That men may know and acknowledge, That the Kingdom over all the creatures,
is his, and that he rules all the earth, Psalm. 58. 12. and 59. 13. Isa. 2. 17.
Ezekiel. 6. 12, 23. and 22. 49.

2. To manifest his power, and that his threatenings recorded in the holy
Scriptures be not in vain and of none effect, Exodus 9. 16. Romans 9. 17. Lev. 10.
1, 2, 3. Ezekiel. 29. 49. Joh. 9. 2, 3. Romans 11. 22. Ezekiel. 6. 10.

3. As a sure and certain testimony of his righteous judgment to come, 2 Thessalonians.
1. 4, 5. 1 Pet. 4. 17, 18.

4. That by them the sins of those who are afflicted, may be broken off, Ezekiel.
16. 41. and 23. 47.

5. That the hypocrisy and rottenness of some Professors may be made manifest,
2 Timothy 3. 9. Jud. v. 12. Mat. 13. 5, 6, 20, 21.

6. To make men call their sins, it may be old sins, to remembrance, Psalm. 38.
the title, etc. to search and try their ways, to find out their sins, Lam. 3.
40. and to make them fear God, and seek unto him for mercy and favor, etc. to
take heed of sinning against him, and of provoking him to anger, Prove. 3. 12.
Heb. 12. 6. Rev. 3. 19. Psalm. 94. 12. Hos. 5. 14. 15. with 6. 1, 2. Psalm. 119.
61, 71, 75. This use a man ought to make, even of God's Judgments and plagues
on others, 1 Cor. 10, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Psalm. 52. 5, 6.

7. That the Saints may be made conform to their Head, our Lord Romans 8. 17.
Phil. 3. 10. Col. 1. 24. 1 Pet. 2, 21. and 4. 13, 15, 16.

8. For the trial of their graces, faith in Gods promises, love to Christ, fear
of God, patience, etc. Jam. 1. 2. 12. Genesis 22. 10, 12. Job 1. and 2. etc. Jam.
5. 11. which if they be real and strong, are unto the honor and glory of Jesus
Christ, 1 Pet. 1. 6, 7. and to make them know, what naughty things be in their
hearts. To which end God once left Hezekiah, 2 Chronicles. 32. 31.

9. For the bettering of our spiritual estates, Romans 8. 28. Heb. 12. 9, 10.
Psalm. 94. 12.

10. That the courage and patience of some Saints under the Cross, may be a
good example to their fellow-Saints; that, their faith, comfort, courage and
spiritual strength being augmented, they also may seek for glory, and honor,
and immortality, by the like patient continuance in well-doing, 2 Cor. 1. 6.
Col. 1. 24.

11. God afflicts both godly and ungodly persons, because of their sins, Isa.
59. 1, 2. Jer. 5. 25. Psalm. 38. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. and that sometimes for old
sins, Job 20. 11. and 13. 26. Psalm. 25. 7. and, I think, has afflicted some of
us for sins committed in the late time of our exaltation, etc.

12. God afflicts men of both sorts for their sins; that, their sins being Hos.
5. 14, 15. and 6. 1, 2, 3. Psalm. 119. 75, 71. Heb. 12. 8, 10.

13. And, that the Saints may not be condemned with the world, Heb. 12. 9. 1
Cor. 11. 32.

14. As also to increase our patience, experience and hope, Romans 5. 3, 4, 5.
and humility and meekness, to endure the wrath of God and rage of men, with a
contented, quiet and calm spirit, and that we may be established, strengthened,
settled; which work is seldom done thoroughly without suffering a while, as Peter
seems to intimate, 1 Pet. 5. 9, 10. as a hedge-maker shakes the stakes, that he
may fasten them in hedges.

15. Furthermore, we are troubled by the world, that we may not expect favor
and peace from it, Joh. 16. 33. Luke 7. 31, 32, 34.

16. That we may not trust in our selves, but in God, Deuteronomy. 8. 3. Cor. 1. 9, 10.

17. That effectual fervent petitions may be put up to God for them who are
afflicted, by themselves and others, Act. 12. 5. 2 Cor. 1. 11.

18. That, comfort and deliverance being bestowed on them by the means of many,
praise and thanks may be given to God on their behalf by many, 2 Cor. 1. 11.

19. Our heavenly Father does by our afflictions and the gracious operation of
his holy Spirit, as it were by fire, consume, and scour, and cleanse away, out
of us, our dross, scum, dirt, dung and all our spiritual filthiness, Isa. 27.
9. 1 Cor. 3. 15. 1 Pet. 1. 7. Psalm. 12. 6. Psalm. 66. 10, 11. etc. Isa. 1. 25.
Ezekiel. 24. 6. 12. Mal. 3. 2, 3. Mat. 3. 11. that so holiness may be perfected in
us.

20. He afflicts some who have not given due diligence to be assured of his
fatherly love, (I believe) to make them more sensible of the want and benefits
of that assurance, and to make them bestow more time and care to attain it.

21. God plagues the ungodly sometimes, that the Saints may rejoice in and
before God, Psalm. 52. 5, 6. and 68. 4.

22. Sometimes the Saints do suffer afflictions to seal and confirm John 3. 33.
Mar. 16. 20. Heb. 2. 4.)

23. God does sometimes afflict men, to drive their pride out of them; so
preparing and fitting them for some great exaltation and prosperity, Isa. 27.
7, 8, 9.

Quest. But for which of all these causes or ends does God afflict us that go
under the name of professors.

Answ. 1. If any man thinks that God does afflict some of us for the first five
things, I shall not peremptorily reject his opinion; and that partly, because,
I believe many of our professors be mere Formalists, and wholly destitute of
true godliness: which therefore I believe, see Marg. 125, 126, 127, 128.

2. I believe God has, and does afflict many godly persons for all the rest of
the ends, excepting the 21 and 22. And if any think God has done it to drive
pride out of very many of us, I shall readily and cheerfully subscribe to that,
but with this earnest request to every one that is of that opinion, to consider
as wisely as he possibly can, whether he be one of them: but whether we shall
be exalted or no, I know not.

To speak more plainly;

True it is, speaking in a general manner, the sins of the Nation in general,
may well be looked on as the cause of the common calamities of the Nation. But

As for the afflictions and grievances which are peculiar to us who are
Professors and Phanaticks, the most forcible and prevalent cause of the
beginning and continuance of them, the strongest impediment of our Petitions
for Liberty, Peace, and Prosperity (the causa sine qua non) the cause without
which things would not be with us, as they be, and that has the most
considerable hand in withholding good things from us; is (I believe) the sins
of Professors.

And because men be ap^ to look on the faults of others too much, and on their
own too little, and to impute calamities common to themselves with others in
too great a measure, to the sins of others, and in too small a measure (or not
in any measure at all) to their own sins; Therefore I beseech all you who are
Professors, to use great diligence to find out your sins, and to know every one
of you in particular, what hand his or her sins have had in this evil work.

Now for the ends whereat our heavenly Father shoots in the Afflictions and
Troubles which are peculiar to us; I verily believe, they be these.

1. By them to exercise and try our Faith, Zeal for Christ, Humility, Patience,
and other graces, and our spiritual gifts, Lam. 3. 39. etc. Heb. 12. 11. Ps.
11. 5. Jer. 20. 12. Dan. 12. 10. Zech. 13. 9. Job 1. and 2. 1 Pet. 5. 6. that
we may know, whether our graces be true graces or not, etc.

2. To make us see the benefits and use of grace, and of the assurance of Gods
favor, more distinctly and clearly, than we have seen them in the times of our
prosperity.

3. To purify and make us white, Dan. 12. 10. Mal. 3. 2, 3.

4. To work in us patience and experience of Gods love and gracious assistance,
and hope, a well-grounded and solid hope, whereof we shall not be ashamed. (For
tribulation works patience, and patience experience, and experience hope,
etc. Romans 5. 3, 4, 5. Jam. 1. 3.) and to stablish, strengthen, and settle us, 1
Pet. 5. 10. (...) we may cleave to our Savior Jesus Christ with (...) purpose
of heart, Acts 11. 23. and seek for glory, and honor, and immortality, by
patient, continuance in well-doing. Romans 2. 7. following the Captain of our
salvation through thick and thin, whithersoever he goes, not being overcome by
either fair words or frowns; and to make it appear to the world that our Lord
Jesus Christ has such faithful servants which will be unto his praise, and
honor, and glory, 1 Pet. 1. 7. and unto the credit of the Gospel.

5. By the Rods wherewith God has been, and is pleased to whip Mic. 6. 9.) To
consider our ways and hearts exactly, to accomplish a diligent search, to find
out our sins and corruptions, Lam. 3. 39. 40. Ps. 119. 59. and, considering,
what evil and bitter fruits they have brought forth to God, and to us, to
humble our selves under the mighty and correcting hand of God, 1 Pet. 1. 6.
more particularly, and more deeply, than formerly, and accepting the punishment
of our iniquities with the whole heart, Lev. 27. 41.

6. To reform our conversings with God and man, and our behavior universally,
without exceptions or reservations, and especially to purge and drive away our
pride; all this unto the honor of God, and the bettering of our spiritual
estate, and the increasing of our consolation.

7. To (learn to) use liberty and peace, and all kinds of prosperity Phil. 4.
12. to make better use of them, than many of us have heretofore, and altogether
as we ought to use prosperity.

8. To give due diligence (which, I fear, many of us have not yet done) to make
our (effectual) Calling and Election (unto everlasting life) sure, 2 Pet. 1. 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. and to know assuredly, that God is our Father, and that
those of us, who have no true Holiness, may exercise themselves more
frequently, and more seriously in the means, to get some.

9. It may be, God exercises some of us by light Afflictions, to prepare and
fit us for greater and sorer sufferings, 2. Tim. 3. 12. Acts 14. 22. Romans 2. 7.
or to press us, to cry mightily unto God, to prepare the called, chosen, and
faithful, spoken of Rev. 17. 14. that so we may have a hand in the ruin of
Babylon, or peradventure to prepare us or our Children to be members of the
Church of Christ, when its glory and splendour shall (...) that of Heaven.

Hitherto of (...) our Afflictions. Now for this, that Professors sins be (...)
greatest hinderance of Professors Petitions for liberty, and peace, etc. I have
thought good to show the Reasons of my belief thus, (reserving to the last
place, those, which some will look on, as having most of reason in them.)

1. (First) consider, I pray, what I have already said ( Marg. 16.) of the
Birth, iniquity, and the unavoidable fruits of it, to show, that God has not
dealt unjustly with us in afflicting us: but consider further concerning sin in
general.

2. Every sin is a transgression of the Law of the most high God, 1 John 3. 4.
which Law, because he made it, cannot but be holy, and just, and good, Romans 7.
12. and all his precepts concerning every thing right, Psalm. 119. 128. and for
the same reason, because he is the Lawgiver, therefore whatsoever sin is
committed against his Law, is committed against him, and (if I may speak so as
they speak of earthly Kings) against his Crown and Dignity, and the true God
being no little God, but infinitely great; therefore, although, sins being
compared one with another, some of them be lesser than other; yet the least of
them is a great sin, and a great evil, because committed against a great God.
Yea, beloved, as wrongs done to men, are judged to merit lesser or greater
punishments, according to the worthiness, all the Nations of the earth,
compared to God be as a drop of water of a Bucket, and as the small dust of the
balance, yea as nothing, yea as less than nothing and vanity, Es. 40 15, 17.
and whereas his Kingdom is over all the Creatures, and an absolute Kingdom, and
his dignity infinite, and he does abundantly deserve the service and obedience
of men; therefore, in very deed, every sin, even the least sin that is,
deserves his curse, Gal. 3. 10. and the everlasting torments of Hell; (which
peradventure some of you have not yet learned.) And if every sin does deserve
the horrible and everlasting Torments of Hell, what do all my sins deserve
then? yea, or the sins of the most sinless? O that I could, that we all could
admire the free grace and mercy of our God, as it is worthy, and praise, and
extol it, as it is worthy, and trust to it, in and through Jesus Christ more
entirely, and stir up our selves, and give all diligence to walk far more
worthy of it, and of the Lord Jesus Christ unto all pleasing, being fruitful in
every good work, Col. 1. 10. unto his glory, and the credit of his glorious
Gospel. God forbid, we should so magnify the free grace of God, as to abuse
it, as to turn it into wantonness and lasciviousness, as those, Jude v. 4. as
to be bold to sin, because grace does abound, Psalm. 130. 4. Romans 2. 4. and 6.
1, 2, 5. Far, O far be this from us.

But (secondly) it is probable,

That at this day not only national Churches, but also Churches of godly
persons have trespassed in gross sins since they were begotten again with the
word of truth.

R. For (and, I pray you, consider it well) so it was

1. With Gain, Genesis 4. 8. and with the Old World, Genesis 6. 3, 4, 5.

2. With the Children of Israel, Exodus 32. Number. 25. 5. and 20. 10, 13. Deuteronomy. 9.
18. and 31. 29. Ps. 78. 58, 59. and 10. 6, 29, 32. Jer. 11. 17.

3. With the Kingdom of Judah apart, 2 Kings 23. 16. Es. 1. 4. and 3. 25. and
65. 4. Jer. 2. 13. and 7. 18. and 8. 19. and 17. 4. and 32. 29, 30. and 44. 3.
Ezekiel. 8. 17. and 16. 26. Ezr. 10. Neh. 5. Hag. 1.

4. With the Sons of Eli, 1 Samuel 2. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. of Samuel, 1 Samuel
8. 1, 2, 3, 4. and of David, viz. Amnon, Absalom, and Ad^ijah.

5. In the time of Christ's preaching, he did not commit himself to many that
believed in his name, because he knew what was in man, John 2. 23, 24, 25. some
sought him, not for his Doctrine, but because they did eat of the loaves and
were filled, John 6. 26. and many of his Disciples, after they had followed him
for a while, forsook him, and walked no more with him, John 6. 66. consider
also Mat. 13. 28, 29 30.

6. In the Primitive Churches there were many corruptions and Acts 15. 1. 1
Cor. 1. 11, 12, 13. and 3. 3, 4. and 5. 1. and 6. 6, 7. and 11. 18, 19, 21. 29,
30. and 15. 12. 2 Cor. 12. 20, 21. Gal. 1. 6. and 2. 12, 13, 14. and 3. 1. and
5. 8, 4. Phil. 2, 21. Col. 2. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. and 4. 17. 1 Timothy 1. 3, 4, 5,
6, 7. 2 Timothy 4. 16. Tit. 1. 16. and 3. 9. Heb. 5. 11, 12. Jam. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 13, 14. and 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 2 Pet. 2. 10. and to the end of the
Chapter, John 3. 9, 10. Jude ver. 4. 8 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19. Rev. 2. 4, 9,
14, 25, 20, 2^. Rev. 3. 1, 2, 9, 15, 16, 17.

7. Yea, we find recorded in the holy Scriptures the sins and exorbitances of
some, whom we know to have been godly; as Noah, Genesis 9. 21. Lot, Genesis 19. 21.
etc, Abraham, Genesis 20. Isaac, Genesis 26. Rebekah, and Jacob, Genesis 27. Moses, the
Servant of the Lord, Exodus 4. 10. etc. and v. 24. Deuteronomy. 1. 39. Ps. 106. 32, 33.
Job chap. 3. Aaron, the Saint of the Lord, Exodus 32. Deuteronomy. 9. 20, Moses and
Aaron, Number. 20. 10 11, 12. Aaron and Miriam, Number. 12. 9. 10. Gideon, Judge. 8.
27. Samson, Judge. 16. Asa, 2 Chronicles. 16. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Hezekiah, 2 King.
20. 2 Chr. 32. 24, 25, 31. David, a man after Gods own heart, 2 Samuel 11. and 12.
Solomon (called Jedidiah, 2 Samuel 12. 25. that is, Beloved of the Lord) 1 King.
11. 1. etc. a Prophet that came from Judah, 1 King. 13. Jeremy Jer. 20. Jonah,
Jon. 1. and 4. Peter, Mat. 16. 22, 23. and 26. 69. etc. Peter and Barnabas,
Gal. 2. Paul or Barnabas, Acts 15. To whom, I think, may be added Uzzah, 2 Samuel
6. 6, 7. and some of those who did eat and drink at the Lords Table unworthily,
1 Cor. 11. and of those forsakers, 2 Timothy 4. 16.

8. And some of the Sins of the said godly persons were not little Aaron,
David, Solomon, and Peter.

9. Lastly, some of our sins are greater than many of us think them to be; as
unbelief, trusting in creatures, deceitful backbiting, biting, idle and foolish
words, unfit jesting, not grieving for sins, our own and of others, not
instructing, comforting, admonishing, reproving, not bestowing time and care to
make what we hear, and read profitable to us, not making use of Ministers when
we may, etc.) And this reason beloved is good, because as to the business of
tempting, the Devils are in this Age altogether such as they have been in all
former Ages, and the world is altogether such as it has been: only, to speak
the truth, the world is much fuller of Baits and Allurements, and has (I
think) more taking snares, than in old time it had; and the cunning craftiness
of the Devils and their ability to deceive (as some think) is augmented by
experience.

And for Satan's wrath, if his short time spoken of Rev. 12. 12. be already has
great wrath, which ye may do well to take into consideration, together with the
Prophesies of the Apostles, Peter, and Jude, and Paul, that in the last days
there should come scoffers, walking after their own lusts, 2 Pet. 3. 3, 4. Jude
ver. 17, 18. etc. and that in the last days men would have a form of godliness,
and yet deny the power thereof, being lovers of their own selves, covetous,
boasters, proud, and high-minded, unthankful, unholy, false accusers,
incontinent, fierce, despisers of those who are good, and lovers of pleasures
more than lovers of God, 2 Timothy 3. 1. etc.

(Thirdly) 1. God judges the earth, Psalm. 75. 7. Genesis 18. 25. Psalm. 58. 11.
that is, rules and judges all the Inhabitants of the earth; and is present in
all places (and sees and knows all things, even all the thoughts, purposes,
desires, and imaginations of men) and almighty, to do whatsoever he pleases,
Jer. 23. 23, 24. Genesis 6. 5. and 8. 21. Ps. 139. 1, 2, 3. etc. Heb. 4. 13. Genesis
17. 1. Isa. 59. 1.

2. As Gods power is infinite, and his love toward his Children, a Es. 49. 15.
and his m^rcy infinite; and as our Advocate Jesus Christ does appear in the
presence of the Father for all his people always, 1 John 2. 1, 2. Heb. 9. 24.
and the Father hears him always, Joh. 11. 41. so his fatherly love is (if I
may so speak) mingled with wisdom, ( Prove. 13. 24.) to train up his Children in
the way wherein they should go, (Pro. 23. 6.) to do his will, and that not only
by instructing them, but also by correcting and chastening them, it may be with
sharp Rods, ( Acts 14. 22.) that at length they may do his will perfectly in
Heaven without any correction, tears, or sorrow.

3. Ye are not ignorant of that which the Prophets have spoken concerning the
sins and iniquities of Gods Covenant servants separating between their God and
them, withholding good things from them, bringing afflictions on them, and
hindering their prayers, Your iniquities (says Esaias) have separated between you
and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that HE WILL NOT HEAR,
chap. 59. 1, 2. your iniquities (says Jeremy) have turned away these things
[from you; the former and the latter rain, and the appointed weeks of the
Harvest] and your sins have withholden good things from you, chap. 5. 24, 25.
and Lam. 3. 39. Wherefore does a living man complain, a man for the punishment
of his sins?

4. The great God who formed all things, is not such a one as the Ps. 50. 21,
22. one, to whom it is all one, whether his holy, just, good, and wise Law be
observed, or not. In my opinion, it agrees not with the infinite wisdom of God,
to suffer any man to gain by any of his sins, (unless a man may be said to gain
godly Repentance, or the like by them, etc.)

5. But that we may judge the better of this matter, let us consider the Method
which God has used and will use in distributing punishments and afflictions,
to humble and reform his people, etc.

(1.) God has said, he does and will render to every man according to his
works, Job 34. 11. Ps. 62. 12. Pr. 24. 12. Jer. 32. 19. Ezekiel. 33. 20. Mat. 16.
27. Romans 2. 6. 2 Cor. 5. 10. Ephesians. 6. 8. Col. 3. 24, 25. Rev. 22. 12. In which
Scriptures by works and deeds, we must understand actions and acts of the heart
and tongue, and the gestures of the body, as well as the works which we do with
our hands, feet, swords, etc. and God is All-sufficient to perform, whatsoever
he has spoken, and cannot deny himself, Ps. 36. 5. and 57. 10. 108. 4. 2 Timothy
2. 13. nor lie, Tit. 1. 2. Ezekiel. 1 2. 28. and 26. 5. and 28. 10.

(2.) God is no respecter of persons, Deuteronomy. 10. 7. 2 Chronicles. 19. 17. Romans 2. 11.
He accepts not the persons of Princes, nor regards the rich more than the
poor, Job 34. 19. nor men of one Nation more than those of another Nation, Act.
10. 34, 35. nor the Master more than the servant, nor men of one calling more
than those of other callings, Ephesians. 6. 9. Col. 3. 25. nor men who are highly
esteemed in the Church, more than those who are not, Gal. 2. 6. nor those who
call him Father, and call on him as their Father, no not those who are indeed
his children by the grace of adoption, as to corrections, more than others.
spare the rod and spoil the child, Prove. 13. 24. If ye call him Father (or call
on the Father, says Peter) who without respect of persons, judges according
to every man's work, pass the time of your sojeurning here in fear. And what
does Gods judging every man and women according to their works, without respect
of persons, import in that place? Verily, if the Apostles Inference be good (as
doubless it is) then it imports this; namely, that God will not spare his
adopted sons and daughters in this world, merely by reason of their adoption,
but deal with them, as he teaches earthly parents to deal with their natural
children, driving their foolishness (when there is cause) with rods of
correction far from them, etc. Prove. 13. 21. and 19. 18. and 23. 13, 14. and
22. 15.

(3.) So that, if ye would know, what sort of persons it is probable, God will
afflict, whilst they be living in this world, rather than and first before men
and women of other sorts. I answer;

1. Those whom he knows; that is, owneth for his own people. You only (says
the Lord) have I known of all the Families of the earth: therefore I will visit
upon you (punish you for) all your iniquities, Amos 3. 2. Such shall not escape
with impunity, when others shall.

2. Those who come nigh him. For this is that which JEHOVAH spoke unto Moses; I
will be sanctified (said he) in them who come nigh me, and before all the
people I will be glorified, Lev. 10. 1, 2, 3. Which words are as if God had
said, They who come nigh me, who am most holy, in the ministration of my holy
Ordinances, or in the profession of my Religion, which is holy, must (above
others) acknowledge and witness the belief and estimation which they have or
ought to have of my Holiness, in both words and deeds, in that way and after
that manner which I have chosen, even according to the prescript rules of my
word: and if they do not so, I will avow my own Holiness, and make it appear,
that my justice and severity is without partiality and respect of persons, by
executing just vengeance against their transgressions, that others may fear to
offend.

3. Those whom God the Father has given to the Son. For, R. 1. What says wise
Solomon? Whom the LORD loves, (says he) he corrects, even as a Father the
Son, in whom he delights, Prove. 3. 12. which Heb. 12. 6. is expressed thus:
Whom the Lord loves, he chasteneth, and scourges every son whom he receives.
From whence is made this inference, v. 7, 8. If ye endure chastening, God
deals with you as with sons: But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all
(sons) are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.

R. 2. In the holy Scriptures, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is compared,
and that partly in respect of the tribulations which his members must endure
before they come to their everlasting Rest, to a Physician or Mediciner, Mat.
9. 12. to a Refiner, Mal. 3. and to a Fanner or Winnower of Wheat, Mat. 3. 12.

1. He is the great Physician of the soul, Mal. 4. 1, 2. and such a Joh. 4. 19.
Joh. 3. 16, 17. and 15. 13. Romans 5. 6, 7, 8, 10 and a most faithful Physician
and Friend to them; and therefore will minister to them (according to his
transcendent wisdom) such Medicinals as they have need of, and when need is, (1
Pet. 1. 6.) for a season, very bitter pills and potions, and very sharp
corrosives, to purge away the putrified, dead and rotten flesh which is in our
souls; (that is, send them chastisements, it may be, sore afflictions and sharp
temptations, to make their sins and worldly lusts bitter and grievous to them;
that they may grow weary of them, and more desirous to be rid of them; and that
they may vomit the love of their sins and base lusts out of their souls, ( Rev.
3. 16. Psalm. 85. 8. Prove. 26. 11. 2 Pet. 2. 22.) To make them take better heed
to their ways, and reform their carriage more completely, Psalm. 119. 71, 59,
75. and 94, 12. and to abstain from all the dainties of the wicked ( Psalm. 141.
4.) and whatsoever is against the health of the soul; that they may not need
such unpleasing Medicinals, etc.

2. He is that Refiner of souls, of whom it is said, Mal. 3. 2, 3. Who shall
abide the day of his coming? for he is like a Refiners fire and Fullers soap:
[viz. to burn up and scour the spiritual dross and filth out of men's souls and
ways, and to make their souls white, Mar. 9. 3.) And he shall sit [as one who
will stick to his work, to complete and perfect it] as a refiner and purifier
of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and
silver, that they may offer to the Lord an offering in righteousness. Also Isa.
48. 10, 11. the Lord says; Behold, I have refined thee, I have chosen thee in
the furnace of affliction, For my own sake, even for my own sake will I do it,
etc. And Zech. 13 9. I will bring the third part through the five, and will
refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they
shall call on me, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they
shall say, the LORD is my God. See also 1 Pet. 1. 6, 7.

3. As to fanning, John the Baptist, Mat. 3. 12. says of Christ, etc.

R. 3. As the rich man, Luke 16. being ungodly, did receive all his good things
in this world, and godly Lazarus all his evil things in this world, Luke 16.
25. so all other ungodly persons shall receive all their good things in this
world, Psalm. 17, 14. and 73. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and all godly persons, all their
evil things in this world, Rev. 14. 13.

4. It is more probable, that judgment and affliction shall begin at much
heavenly wisdom; although he will take care and pains, and bestow time to
reclaim from their evil ways, all that are under his authority and power, yet
he will take special care of his children to draw (and if need be) drive them
our of their sinful and vain courses, and begin with them as soon as they be
able to endure stripes, Prove. 13. 24. so the nearer men are to God, the more
likely he is, to visit their sins upon them, Amos 3. 2. and to begin with them;
(as he did Jer. 25. 15. to the 29. and 1 Pet. 4. 17.) and after they be duly
humbled under his chastening hand, in due time, to cast the rods wherewith he
has corrected them, into the fire, unless they also do take notice of Gods
judgment, and cease from their sinful practices.

Obj. But here, it may be, many a Professor will say in his heart; what is all
this to me? I hope, my sins have had no hand in pulling down Gods wrath, etc.

Answ. To such and all other Professors I say; If none of you have Hophni and
Phineas, and David, and Solomon; yet he may in his wisdom (according to his
method of humbling and reforming offenders) see cause to punish or chastize
you; and that among other sins.

1. For not sanctifying him according to the prescript Rules of his holy word,
when ye come nigh him: As he did Nadab and Abibu, sons of Aaron, Lov. 10, 2, 3.

2. For your secret sins. As he did those spoken of by Moses, Psalm. 90. 7, 8,
9. And Achan, Jos. 7. And Ananias and Saphira, Act. 5.

3. And for sins of omission; for not doing those things which ye ought to do:
As he did King Saul, 1 Samuel 15. 3. etc. and one of the Herod's immediately with
a horrible death, for not giving the glory (of his Oration) to God, Act. 12.
12, 13. And Eli, a godly man, with death, by breaking his neck suddenly (1 Samuel
4. 18.) for honoring his sons above the LORD, (1 Samuel 29. 30.) in not
punishing and restraining them, (1 Samuel 3. 13.) for and from their evil
practices: And Asa, a godly King, for not relying on the LORD his God, and not
seeking to him, 2 Chronicles. 16. 7. Our Savior also in the time of his
humiliation, did look round about on many persons with anger for their sinful
silence, Mark 3. 4, 5. And Paul did pray God, that the sin of the Christians at
Rome, in forsaking him, and not standing with him at his first answer, might
not be laid to their charge, 2 Timothy 4. 16.

And all the sins mentioned, ( Mat, 25. 42, 43.) as sins which shall omission,
as not visiting, and not relieving; it may be, because so many do make so light
a matter of such sins: and because so many Professors do make so light a matter
of them, therefore I have thought good to speak the more of them.

4. God may judge you for sins which are comparatively little, and in Moses
against whom the anger of the LORD was kindled, and ye see for what, Exodus 3.
and 4. especially Chap. 4. 14. (yea the LORD met him, and sought to slay him,
Exodus 4. 24.) and Numb. 20. 10, 12, 24. Deuteronomy. 34. 4, 5. and Psalm. 106. 32, 33.
ye see, why Moses and Aaron died, and could not bring the congregation of
Israel into the Land which the LORD gave them. So also God dealt with Miriam,
Numb. 12. and those who looked into the Ark of the LORD, 1 Samuel 6. 19. and
(...), 2 Samuel 6. 6, 7. 1 Chronicles. 1. 3, 9, 10. and the Prophet which came from
Judah, 1 King. 13. Mr. Walter Cradock (who was a right godly man, and an
excellent soul-Preacher) was of this opinion, that of all the Professors which
are damned, the greater part are damned for little sons, and the abuse of
things indifferent.

5. God may judge you, for your old sins, the sins of your youth; such
p^radventure, as ye your selves have forgotten, or think God Job 20. 11. and as
he made Job to possess the iniquities of his youth or childish age, Job 13. 26.
See Jun. and Trem. and the Assembly men on those two places, and Job 14. 17.
Also David saw cause to pray unto God, not to remember the sins and
transgressions of his youth, Psalm. 25. 7.

6. As God sent a famine of three years for a sin of King Saul, long after his
death, 2 Samuel 21. so I believe he may chastize a man for the sins which he has
committed in the time of his unregeneracy, long after the time of his second
birth; especially if he has not searched duly for them, or not humbled himself
daily for them, or does not walk humbly with God.

7. God may judge you for sins capable of such excuses as many of us possibly
think to have a pretty deal of reason in them. As he did not only King Saul, 1 Samuel 13. 1. to the 15. and Chap. 15. but also Moses, Numb. 20. and Psalm. 106.
32, 33. (see before) and Uzzah, 2 Samuel 6. 6, 7. and 1 Chronicles. 13. 9, 10. and the
Prophet which came from Judah, 1 King. 13.

8. God may deal severely with those of you, who are really godly, Moses,
Aaron, and Eli, (see before) and with David. 2 Samuel 12. etc. and with Heman,
who was afflicted and ready to die from his youth up, (mark that) and while he
suffered the terrors of the LORD, was distracted, Psalm. 88. 15. But read and
consider all the Psalm.

9. God may punish or chastize us for our sins, notwithstanding, upon
admonition, we do confess we have sinned against him, as he did, not only King
Saul, 1 Samuel 15. 24, 25, 26. but also David; notwithstanding he did so confess,
2 Samuel 12. and much more than that, Psalm. 51.

10. God may judge us for our other men's sins; I mean, for the sins of others,
imputing them to us, because we have not instructed, connselled, admonished and
reproved them, or not corrected them according to our duty; not done what God
called us to do, and which we ought to have done, to keep them from sinning.
For why is it said; Jos. 7. 1. that the children of Israel committed a trespass
in the accursed thing, when Achan only had trespassed personally? Study this
matter seriously, I beseech you: for there was a time when the number of
faithful men was very small, Psalm. 12. 1, 2. Prove. 20. 6. Jer. 23. 28. and
Prove. 27. 6. And now I do testify and say, that, notwithstanding this
dispensati^ calls upon all professors, especially those who take upon them, as
Ministers of the Gospel, to deal faithfully, yet I have not observed many signs
of th^^ measure of faithfulness which the state of things calls for.

11. God may judge us for our sins concerning things indifferent, apparel,
Zeph. 1. 8. who were clothed with strange apparel. See the opinion of Mr.
Cradeck a little before at 4. Do not Professors yet know, that London is
destroyed? Consider, I pray you, whether the gay Lady-like apparel of
Shop-women did not help to bring the pestilence into it, to destroy thousands
of the Inhabitants; and afterward, the Jesuit-like policy and too gallant
fashions of those who were bound, in a special manner above others, to reprove
the Lady-shopwomen, and ought rather to have apparelled themselves with
sackcloth, or like plain Yeomen; whether this did not strike the Ministers out
of the gap (Ezekiel. 22. 30, 31. 2 Samuel 24.) and keep it open for the fire to
enter into the houses to burn them.

12. I believe, the Lord may afflict a very godly man in his worldly estate
according to the proportion of the ill gotten goods which he possesses;
although he himself has not gotten any part thereof by sinful and indirect
means, (nor knows, that any of his friends did so get any part of it.)

13. I also believe, many professors, and some godly persons, do either take
little or no notice of some of their sins, or else make too light a matter of
them, and hereby make them the more ugly in the most pure eyes of God, and
provoke him the more to scourge them.

14. It is probable, that our wise God, when he purposes to vouchsafe great
prosperity, or they do expect to be highly exalted; that then he will chastize
and scourge them, if milder sufferings will not prevail, sharply, and not cease
scourging them sorely, till he has wrought among them a great Reformation
suitable to such an exaltation. For it is a great absurdity, for them to look
for such a change without taking care to reform themselves and, their inferiors
accordingly. ( One thing of another sort, etc. which peradventure may be of
some good use; God did send two She-bears out of the Wood, to tear forty and
two of those little children which mocked Elisha the Prophet with his bald
head, 2 King 2. 23, 24.) And thus I have shown you in part the method, after
which God has disciplined his people of old; the greater part whereof I have
declared by examples in the holy Scriptures.

Part. 4. (Fourthly) now I shall set before you an argument ab homine.

1. This my opinion, that Professors sins be the most powerful and effectual
hindrance of the liberty and peace of Professors, and of their prayers for it,
I have held, at least, two years: during which time my God has not so much as
caused me to stagger concerning it, notwithstanding my prayers unto him
concerning my affairs, and concerning this business in particular.

2. Notwithstanding I have published this my opinion at diverse meetings in
Bristow, yet none of the Professors of that City (as far as I know, or have
heard) have either first or last declared their dislike of it, although they
had time and opportunities enough (before I left that City) to do it.

3. I think, he was a godly Minister of Christ, who from 1 Cor. 11. 30. did
infer, that where there is much sickness, there is much sin; and that he might
as well have said, where there is much Affliction, etc.

4. John Price, a godly Citizen of London, but a Native of Hereford, not long
before his death (it may be, being then more sensible of his own failings, and
the ^ailings of other Professors, than formerly) did in his Letter unto me*
write of them who have been called Roundheads, and of the change of their
Estates, and (among other passages) use these very words; The truth (said he)
is, We have been full, foolish, froward, and wanton, and almost spoiled for
want of correction, So he verb^tine Heb. 11. 4.

5. An eminent Minister of Bristow, who preached his Farewell Sermon in August
1662. called Mr. E. H. when I spoke of the duty of reproving sins, said, It is
generally neglected: Which, I think, he would not have said, if he had not
thought Professors wanted it.

6. Another Preacher of Bristow at a Meeting, in his Sermon or Prayer, I heard
speak of profane Professors, that was his word.

7. A Woman of a (high) way (in Religion) being in company with other
professors, some of them spoke of the Changes since 1659. Whereupon she said, I
think, affliction would do me good, and some of you also.

8. I have also heard diverse Professors say, as their own words, or If ^ were
as ready (or ripe, or fit; some such word) for mercy, as our Adversaries be for
wrath, we should soon be delivered. And, I believe it is somewhat common with
Professors, to speak such words: but who endeavors diligently and strenuously
to reform Professors?

Part. 5. (Fifthly) I believe, many of us are as yet without Christ, utterly
wholly flesh, altogether carnal and fleshly, and stark dead in trespasses and
sins, ( John 3. 6. Ephesians. 2. 1, 11, 12.) so that they do never serve God in faith
or humility, never in love or with any filial fear, or godly reverence, never
worship God in the spirit, never do any thing well, in a holy manner, never
serve God acceptably, so as to have their persons or services accepted with God
John 15. 5. Heb. 12. 28. This is true of every one of them, so that their
iniquity must needs be very great. Only I shall somewhat confidently hope,
that, if God shall keep them constantly to the means of Regeneration any long
time, that then he will beget them again hereafter, and not suffer them to die
in their sins. That there be such Professors, see Marg. 125, 126, 127, 128.

Part. 6. (Sixthly) The iniquity and sins of such professors, and of those who
have true grace (as well as of others) is greatned many ways (but with some
difference.)

As 1. By the multitude of the kinds of sin, wherein they trespass; And by the
greatness of some of them, (such as have been Feasting and Music with dancing
in the night, which I account Revelling; Gal. 5. 20, 21. 1. Pet. 4 3. and one
Frolic in the presence of five Nonconforming Ministers, part of them having a
hand in it.) And by persevering in some sins, adding one trespass to another,
without taking care and using diligence to cease from such practices; And by
trespassing in the presence of irreligious persons (as it were, publishing
their naughtiness in Ga^h and Askelon) without shame or fear; so giving
occasion to laugh and scoff at them in secret, and to think and speak evil of
the holy servants and right ways of the Lord, 2 Samuel 12. 14. Ezekiel. ^6. 20, 23.
Romans 2. 24. and to harden their hearts against his holy word. O how much, as it
were, air, water, earth, wood, dust, dirt, dung and filth some Professors have
within them, which does issue forth in their conversings?

2. By the foul and base work which sin makes. For by it we do transgress Mat.
6. 9. defi^e his image, as it were, by casting dung, dirt, or dust upon it;
grieve his holy and good spirit, Ephesians. 4. 29, 30. Who is our all-sufficient
Teacher and guide, John 16. 3. by whom also we are sealed unto the day of
Redemption, Ephesians. 4. 30. and disgrace the Gospel of Christ, and the right ways
of the Lord; yea, Professors thereby do in a special manner pollute Gods name,
and discredit the true Religion, and every one of us Professors disgrace that
way in Religion, the credit whereof ought to be very dear to him, because he
esteems it the best and most excellent of all ways.

3. By the many benefits which our most gracious God has been, stronger is the
engagement. God's goodness calls on us to fear God, and leads us to amendment
of life, Psalm. 130. 4. Romans 2. 4. and consequently ^ggravates the iniquity of
our disobedience, so we are to under^^^nd, ^^r. 9. 13, 14.

Quest. But what are these benefits? (For none of us all do remember them so
frequently, and weigh them so exactly as we ought.)

Answ. They are,

1. Life, Food, Raiment, Harbor, Physic, Surgery, Liberty and Peace of the
Body; Health, Strength, and Nimbleness of the body; the good state and use of
our Limbs and Senses, inward and outward; Books and writings of many sorts, the
faculties of the soul, understandi^^^ memory, invention, conscience, power to
will, humane wisdom, (...) Arts and Sciences, worldly wealth.

threatenings, rebukes, and checks by the conscience and men, Ministers, or not
Ministers, Psalm. 141. ^^* the company and good examples of godly persons, and
conference with them; their love and prayers with us and for us; Exercises and
Meetings, the Sacraments, and all the holy Ordinances; the knowledge of
spiritual things, of things belonging to our Peace, and the right manner of
Gods service, of God and our selves, a conscience awakened; the fatherly love
of God, our Adoption, Justification, and pardons, ( Es. 55. 7) our being
members of Christ's Mystical body and Heirs of Heaven; our sorrow for sin and
stock of Grace, Faith, Hope, love toward God, love toward men, godly and
ungodly friends and enemies, filial fear of God, Humility, Zeal, etc. our
spiritual strength, Jesus Christ dwelling in us by faith, Ephesians. 3. 17. and the
holy spirit of God dwelling in us, to teach us, and to guide and rule all the
(...) of our souls all the days of our Pilgrimage, and spiritual warfare.

Note 1. Of the aforesaid good things, some God gives to men of all sorts, Mat.
5. 45. Luke 6. 35. some are peculiar to true believers.

2. But whosoever is partaker of Gods goodness in good things of any sort, the
iniquity of his disobedience is thereby exaggerated according to the measure of
the bounty.

3. The fuller and clearer any man's light is, as to the discerning of spiritual
things, by so much the greater is his iniquity, if he does not make such use as
he ought of his Light.

4. If a Professor who has no grace, does think, he has some, and that he is
justified from all his sins, and that God is his Father, and the like; I
believe, this his conceit does aggravate his sins.

5. By all the means of grace and amendment of life and obedience. Acts 17. 25.
But the destruction and vengeance from the Almighty, which has been upon us
and our Brethren by Nation and Religion; the Pestilence, the Sword, the
horrible burning of Houses, and the losses and sufferings which are peculiar to
professors, as also the late prodigies are Messengers sent of God, not only to
warn men out of their sins, but even to fear and drive them out, Es. 26. 9. and
27. 7, 8. 9. Psalm. 94. 12. and 119. 67, 71. which Messengers and him who sent
them, if we hear not, this our turning of a deaf ear to our Creator and most
bountiful Benefactor and to his Messengers, whatsoever the sins be, to which we
cleave, adds much to them, and greatly provokes Gods wrath against us.

Quest. But what if much of a man's disposition and behavior under the rods of
God be point blanck contrary to that which God calls for by them* and even to
that good whereof afflictions are not much less than a natural cause, and which
men in such cases are somewhat apt to do. As if, when men are cast out of a
sufficient Estate into a very low Estate, and without any certainty of a
competent maintenance for them and their Wives and Children; if then they
should be very highminded, and full of mirth and jollity?

Answ. Verily I cannot but think, this cross carriage does provoke the great
God who formed all things, greatly. Beloved, This is a day of trouble, and of
treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of Hosts in one of the valleys
of Vision, wherein the Lord GOD of Hosts calls to weeping and to mourning, (the
Prophet adds, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth.) And behold joy
and gladness, Es. 22. 5, 12, some are not lowly, they do not lie low^^ it. He
has deprived many of us of much of our worldly Estates, and brought some of us
out of a high and plentiful Estate, into a very low and needy Estate, without a
certainty of worldly things necessary for us and our Wives and Children, by
which he calls, not only for the humbling of the body, but also for humbleness
of mind* and for mourning, and weeping; yea, men are apt in such cases to mourn
and weep, and to speak, as if their hearts were not haughty; yea, some of us
have bewailed our low Estate to men (it may be, to God also) and spoken of
Imprisonments, Oppression, etc. And yet, notwithstanding all this, behold, joy
and gladness in abundance, smiling and laughing, and jollity* and pride, (as if
they were sure of a very high estate to morrow, Jam. 4. 13, 14. Prove. 27. 7.
And Nonconforming Ministers, as if they had been counseled by Balaam (a
little before the burning of London) apparalled and adorned (instead of plain
Yeomen) like gallants, and such a Ministers wife not vouchsafeing to take the
pains to teach her own children. Was that so, because that part of her gown
which did sweep the dust, was longer than the whole tail of a Pea^hen, or
because she was proud?

5. By transgressing a holy, just and good Law, and trespassing against the God
of heaven and earth, who gives us all the good things which we have, by
polluting his blessed Name, and doing all the evil works before mentioned
(Marg. 60.) for a very trisle; as a very little profit (peradventure not worth
a halfpenny) or a very little ease, or a very little pleasure (unless our
hearts be monstrous base) or to please the company; it may be profane wretches.
And this many of us do not duly consider, how great an aggravation it is.

6. By sinning without any occasion, or any Tempter, excepting our selves, and
the pride, folly and naughtiness of our own hearts. As that Minister who kept
his stock of pride, when he lost his Benefice, although he had not learning
enough of any sort for a wise man to be proud of it. Occasions of sinning do
call for milder dealing. See the Geneva Tr. Gal. 6. 1.

not making use of the power which we have, in resisting evil examples and evil
counsel, and inward motions before they break out in our speeches and actions,
by not reforming those things which are in our power, as our tongues and
bodies; by not abstaining from the sins which it is in our power to abstain
from; as vain, idle, foolish, unseemly speeches, and the like; and by not doing
the duties, which, it is in our power, to perform; as the instruction and
correction of our children and servants, and the like, and although very much
of this might be done without any considerable inconvenience. Many of us do not
so much of it as might be so done.

8. By making a small matter of great sins, and of small sins nothing.

9. By making a light matter, or nothing, of our own sins, because other folks
be greater sinners than we.

10. By slighting, or worse than slighting, the counsel, admonitions and
rebukes of God by his Preachers, and our illightened and awakened consciences,
and by quenching the spirit, 1 These. 5. 19. Is this our making no good use of
such things as these, nothing* Is thy keeping of thy sins against God's Word in
the mouths of the Preachers, and the checks of thine own conscience, and the
good desires and purposes stirred up in thy heart by the good Spirit of God; is
such a keeping of Gods enemies so near thy heart, nothing? How long shall he
who is the Judge of all the earth, stand at the door of thy heart, knocking for
admission? Rev. 3. 20.

11. By the repugnancy, opposition, disagreement, or whatsoever it should be
called, which is between our exorbitant behavior, and things whereby we should
be moved to behave our selves better. Of which things, 1. One is, the high and
great dignities to which we are exalted; especially to be children of God,
members of Christ's mystical body (of his flesh and of his bones, Ephesians. 5. 30.)
Christ's Friends, Joh. 15. 14, 15. and coheirs with Christ of the Kingdom of
heaven, Romans 8. 16, 17. For what said Nehemiah, Chap. 6. 11? Should such a man
as I flee? Who is there, that being as I am, would go into the Temple to save
his life? I will not go in. And so should we say; should such as we are, sin
against our good God? who is there, that being as I am, would sin to save his
life? By God's help, I will not sin.

Qu. But what if we do but think, we are such?

Ans. Yet we should abstain from sinful practices the rather, in regard of the
high conceit which we have of our spiritual estate; and if we do not, that
conceit does exaggerate our iniquity.

2. The promises, vows, covenants, leagues, and it may be, oaths, general and
particular, which we have made or entered into, to God, or men, or both,
especially if without compulsion, Deuteronomy. 23. 21. Eccl. 5. 4. Psalm. 66. 13, 14.
Psalm. 119. 106. Psalm. 50. 5. especially some of our covenants.

3. Our specious and large forms of godliness, 2 Timothy 3. 5. The Sermons of some
are indeed too trim and gaudy (Nimis pleni Flosculis, etc. and the prayers of
some too long, Mat. 7. 21.

4. Our words in prayer and conference, savouring and making a show of much
holiness, faith, humility, meekness, mortification, sobriety, patience, zeal,
courage, heavenly mindedness and contempt of worldly things, love of God,
affiance in God. As Saul's, 1 Samuel 14. 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. and Jehu's, 2
King. 10. 15, 16. Many a professors conversation answers some of his speeches
very poorly.

5. Our being almost singular and alone in our zealous or earnest defense of
the mor^ality and perpetuity of the Lord's Sabbath. This greatens the iniquity
of our taking no more care to keep it wholly holy, and to spend it wholly on
God's service, and the soul, according to the Commandment.

6. Our judging Governors of the Commonwealth and Church, (it may be, with
bitter and railing speeches) for not using fit means to ref^rm the whole, and
in the mean while doing the same things our selves, Romans 2. 1, 21, 22, 23. viz.
in not contributing to a universal Reformation, what we might, in seeking with
due care and diligence to reform (as to Religion, and good manners and
civility, those small parts, parcels and particles, which are under our own
power and government; our own wives, children and servants; ^ea, such as do not
rule well their own families, will blame others for not ruling well theirs.

7. Our straining at a gnat, and swallowing half a camel; scrupling or Mat. 23.
24. Mark. 7. 1. to 6. Joh. 18. 28. yea, I doubt, some professors do pretend,
that this or that is against their conscience, when ^n very deed it is not.

8. The high esteem and conceit, 1. Which every one of us has of his own way
in Religion. O how excellent my way in Religion is in comparison of all other
ways? whether thou be called a Presbyterian, or, etc. if thy way be the
best of all ways, take heed thou be not worse than the worst Saint that walks
in it, Gal. 6. 3. 2. Which many of us have of our personal endowments; graces
and spiritual gifts, prayers. O how great a measure, how high a height of
grace, faith, etc. some think they have attained! Methinks I hear some speaking
like the Pharisee, Luke 18. 11, 12. God, I thank thee, that I am not as other
men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as yonder Cavalier, or as
yonder Conformist; and others like the Wardens, Omnia been, or the Christians
of Laodicea; Rev. 3. 17. I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of
nothing. When indeed they be wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
naked, at least in c^mparison of many of their fellow-professors, and their
conversation very irregular.

9. The strong and confident expectation which some of us have, of an eminent
and speedy exaltation: (I hope, it is without a purpose to ^ebel against any
King, excepting that evil one who is mentioned, Rev. 9. 11.) which expectation
calls to such Expectants for a suitable reformation of their behavior, and to
use all good means to reform their wives, and their sons, and their daughters,
and their menservants, and their maid servants, and the strangers who are
within their gates (Prove. 22. 6. Exodus 20. 10.) that they also may be fit to
partake of so great prosperity, Prove. 22. 29.

10. Gods exceeding great condescension and humbling of himself, (Psalm. 113. 5,
6.) in waiting, that he might be gracious to us, Isa. 30. 18. and not so long
since in, as it were, stooping to us, yielding to our prayers, to preserve,
protect and deliver us, yea, in doing more than all this for us, when very many
of us were very great sinners, and did not yield our selves to him, and humble
our selves before him, so as to be thoroughly willing, and duly careful, to
abandon all our sins universally. And this has greatened, and does greaten our
iniquity.

11. Our low estates do call to many of us for meekness and lowliness of heart,
and to some with a loud voice: instead whereof there is much pride and
stateliness.

12. Our sins may be aggravated by returning to our vomit, 2 Pet. 2. 18, 19,
20, 21, 22. Are not some of us like the Dog, which is turned again to his
vomit, and to the Sow, which is washed, to her wallowing in the mire? Have not
some professors, after they had escaped the poll^tions of the world, and a
considerable time abstained from them; have they not after this turned again
unto folly? Psalm. 85. 8. Psalm. 125. 4, 5. And do not very many of us in
religious exercises, especially Fasts, (by the mouths of the Speakers) confess
our sins, and bewail our folly in committing them, (which is an inferior way of
vomiting them up) and afterward practice them as formerly? And is this, in your
sight nothing? Verily, whatsoever it is in your eyes, I think it to be a
greatening of our sins, and an addition to our provocations. What said Mr.
Walter Cradock at a private Meeting? A Whelp coming into the Room, vomited
before us, and after a while licked up again what he had vomited. When eupon,
There is a Sermon for you, quoth he. And by all these Particulars the iniquity
of Professors is or may be aggravated.

13. The iniquity of some Professors is exaggerated by their unwillingness to
see their sins, or to have others to take notice of them. Whence to find out
and take good notice of their sins: As a Constable, not being desirous to
apprehend a Thief will either not at all search for him, or search negligently.
But, it may be, some Professors do declare this their unwillingness to others,
by being displeased and angry with those who tell them of their sins. And what
is the cause of this their anger? Sure the cause is naught: For they ought to
esteem a reproof, a kindness, as David did, Psalm. 145. 5. 1 Samuel 25. 32, 33.
But men cannot endure to have their friends ill spoken of. Therefore also it
is, that some, when they see their sins, yet will not seem to see them; yea, it
may be, when their consciences do tell them, that the Preacher means them, yet
they will not seem to be of the same mind with their conscience. Like Dr.
Fern, who when it was intimated to him, that he was aimed at, would whine out,
He does not mean me, He does not mean me. And so sometimes it comes to pass,
that the Preachers words be heard in vain, 1 Cor. 6. 1.

14. Our sins are also greatened by God's wrath and vengeance upon Dan. 5. 18.
etc. but especially upon our selves and others, at home and abroad, by Sea and
by Land, in City and Country, by the Sword, Pestilence, Fire, etc. We ought to
hear Rods of no great roughness, and without a heavy load of Afflictions, so as
to cleanse our ways, and to let go our sins, Isa. 27. 7, 8, 9. But the Sword,
Pestilence, Burning of houses, and the like, do call on us amain, and with a
very loud voice, even for a full and complete cleansing of all our ways to the
uttermost. To speak home; The Lord has proved us, as he did the children of
Israel in diverse manners, ( Deuteronomy. 8. 2. etc.) some of us sharply, before the
late civil Wars, and in the time of the Wars with losses and prosperity.
Plainly, he has tried us very variously, with adversity, and prosperity, and
adversity; and we have dealt with him Israelites did, Psalm. 95. 9, 10, 11.
proved and tempted him, and do still tempt him, with our sins; notwithstanding
we have seen the great and strange works which he has wrought for us, and
against us. He has drawn us (with cords of love) and we have not been drawn;
and driven us (with Rods) and we have not been driven; purged us, and we have
not been purged, Ezekiel. 24. 13. and humbled us, and we have not been humbled. We
have not humbled our selves as we ought to have done, but are (many of us)
haughty and high-minded, jolly and jocund, followers of new and gaudy fashions.
We do adorn and trimour bodies and houses with things too fine, and too costly.
Can this be without Rebellion, which is as the sin of Witch craft? and without
stubbornness, which is as Iniquity and Idolatry? (2 Samuel 15. 22.) or without
despising the chastening of the Lord? Prove. 3. 11. Heb. 12. 5. What? not learn
obedience by the sore things which we suffer? Why, it was a foul fault in
Israel, to put far away an evil day which was not yet come upon them, Amos 6.
3. What is it then in us, to carry our selves, as if it were very far from us,
when not only an evil day is actually upon us, but also we have just cause to
think, some men will endeavor to make it much sorer, and more terrible than it
is? But, Oh, what has London, since they who above all others, should have
stood in the gap, and taken pains to make up the hedge, have disfigured
themselves! O Lord God, what will become of us?

15. Our iniquity is greatly greatned by partaking of other men's sins. For,

1. As it is a sin to command, or counsel, or hire, or request, or seek by
threatenings, or sharp words, or promises, and fair words, to draw or drive any
manner of person to do any unlawful work, or to speak any unlawful word, or to
omit any part of his duty, so, if the party so tempted, shall yield to the
Temptation, then he who has by any such ways prevailed with him, or shall
abet, maintain, or countenance a man in any sin, is accessory to the sin which
is committed, and partaker of it with the personal Actor of it.

2. If a man does use his Christian liberty unseasonably, whereby his Romans 14.
21, 22.

3. If we do not instruct, counsel, admonish, reprove, and correct and punish
others as far as we are bound in duty, to use those means to work them out of
their sins, or to keep them from falling into sin; then we are guilty of the
sins wherein they are lying, or whereinto they fall, and the Omission of some
of these duties made the Children of Israel accessory to the Theft of Achan,
and cost the lives of six and thirty of them, Josh. 7. 1, 2, 3, 4 5. and 22. 20.

4. We are partakers of other men's, not only by being evil examples to them,
but also by not being good examples to them. And, O how often do we trespass in
the three last of these ways, especially in the last of all!

Yet give me leave, to speak somewhat more to you of some Gospel-matters.

Many Professors, some unregenerate, and some (I believe) regenerate, do not
make such use as they ought, of the Doctrine, Commandments, Promises and
threatenings of the Gospel.

1. They do not duly consider them, and what use they ought to make of them, 2 Timothy 2. 7. Psalm. 119. 11.

2. They do not endeavor and stir up themselves with due diligence, to believe
the Doctrine, Commandments, Promises, and Threats of the Gospel, and to believe
in Jesus Christ, Mark 1. 15. John 3. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 36. 1 Timothy 1. 15. (2
Pet. 1. 17.) 1 John 5. 10. Deuteronomy. 18. 15. etc. Acts 3. 22, 23.

3. Nor mourn and grieve in relation to their sins, Mat. 3. 2. Mark 1. 15. Acts
2. 38. and 3. 19. and 17. 30. and 26. 18, 20.

4. Nor turn from their sins, Joel 2. Acts 3. 19.

5. Nor bring forth fruits deserving the name and credit of amendment of life,
Mat. 3. 8. Tit. 2. 11, 12. Acts 26. 18, 20. or else, 1. Not turn from their
sins universally and thoroughly, Ezekiel. 18. 28, 30, 31, 19, 21, 22, 14. etc. 2.
And turn unto the Lord, Jer. 3. 1. and 4. 1. Joel 2. 12, 13. Acts 26. 18. 3. Or
else not believe the Gospel-promises and Threats, and in Jesus Christ with a
strong faith, and the whole heart, Romans 10. 10. Acts 8. 37. (1 John 5. 13.) 4.
Or not amend their ways, and mourn for their sins according to God, 2 Cor. 7.
9, 10. upon Gospel grounds and Motives, in regard of Gods love, and free grace
and mercy toward them, and Gods promises and their expectation of great matters
from him hereafter, 1 John 3. 19. 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. and 6. 17, 18. with 7. 1.
and because by their sins they have polluted Gods name, and grieved his holy
spirit, and disgraced his Gospel, etc. but repented and put away their sins
only to escape Gods wrath, (which is but self-love) and not for Gospel ends
also, viz. for God, Romans 11. 36. Prove. 16. 4. 1 Cor. 10. 31. Jam. 4. 3. very
many of us do not duly consider, how great a sin it is, not to come by faith
unto Jesus Christ, that we may have life, John 5. 40. Who will in no wise cast
out him who comes unto him, John 6. 37. and how great the difference is before
God, between doing, what we do thoroughly, and doing by halves, and between
doing upon Gospel-grounds, and for all Gospel-ends, and doing for our own ends
only: which great error, it will be our wisdom, to amend thoroughly, and to
Kiss the Son least he be angry, and we perish from the way, if his wrath be
kindled but a little, Psalm. 2. 12. And thus far of the sixth part of my proof.

Part. 7. 1. There are five sins of Professors, whereof I shall here

1. Many Professors, Ministers and others, do neglect their Families, not
bestowing time and pains in educating and training up their children and
servants in the way wherein they should go, Prove. 22. 6. (as if they did
believe the Devils old saying, A young Saint, and an old Devil.) O how careless
many Professors be, of preparing those who shall survive them, to hold forth
the name of Christ in a holy manner, to his honor and the credit of his Gospel!

2. Many Professors do suffer very much frothy, vain, idle, foolish, corrupt
communication, not tending to edification, to proceed out of their mouths.

3. Many Professors do profane and mispend much of the holy Salbaths. For which
sin and Idolatry especially, (as the Jews about two hundred years since have
said) the Lord did reject their Forefathers; so that (as they then said) they
could not take the Christians of those days to be the servants of the true
Messiah, because they did live in those two sins.

4. Many Professors be so full of pride under this Dispensation, that by reason
of it and the fruits of it, men of knowledge can hardly get charity enough, to
think there is any fear of God before their eyes.

5. It is a common thing with Professors, to be silent at the sins one of
another. Which five things joined together, do amount to a foul heap of
iniquity.

Part. 8. I come now to some downright Reasons for this my belief, the
greatest cause of the afflictions peculiar to Professors, and the greatest
impediment of their prayers for some good things expedient for them, u the sins
and iniquities of Profess^rs.

R. 1. And first, Gods Kingdom, Wisdom, and Power being such as it is, and all
men's hearts and times being in his hand, Prove. 21. 1. Psalm. 31. 15. he might
have established our King in all his Dominions, and yet given us favor with
him and his Parliaments (as Genesis 39. 4, 5, 6, 21, 22, 23. and Dan. 1. 6.) and
bowed their hearts, to confirm us in the places which we held 1659. with the
means and liberty which we then enjoyed (excepting the Kings revenue and some
high Offices.) Neither has it been at any time such a hard thing for God, to
better our Estates, instead whereof, notwithstanding Gods-love to his children,
which passes knowledge, Ephesians. 3. 19 and that the effectual fervent prayer of
the righteous avails much with him, Jam. 5. 16. etc. yet, it has pleased
him, in his infinite wisdom, to afflict Professors in diverse kinds, wherein he
has not afflicted others; yea, to afflict us in our worldly Estates, and to
increase the means of growing rich to others; yea, to augment the worldly
Estates of others by diminishing ours, to deprive us of our Benefices, Offices,
and Preferments, to make room for others: yea, ye know, that since 1659.
notwithstanding we have carried our selves, not seditiously, but peaceably and
quietly, yet our condition is by degrees and steps grown from good to bad, and
from bad to worse. Which sorry changes of our condition, to what others may
make a shift, to impute them, I know not; but, in my judgment, they are to be
ascribed to our sins, who are called Professors, of whom (I believe) many are
not yet born again, and many Sons and Daughters have and do by their sins
provoke our heavenly Father, to chastise and correct them.

For R. 1. Although the Lord scourges every Son ( and Daughter) Prove. 3. 12.
Heb. 12. 6. yet he does not afflict, or grieve, so much as one man or woman
merely for his pleasure, Lam. 3^ 33. and when he judges and afflicts any of
his children, his judgments are right; he afflicts them in faithfulness, Psalm.
119. 57. because ( according to his just and wise Method of making men meet to
partake of the inheritance of the Saints in light, Col. 1. 12, 13.) there is
(as Peter calls it, 1 Pet. 1. 6.) need, either because they be not duly careful
and diligent, to find out their sins, or because they be so far from hating sin
as they ought, as not to be thoroughly careful to humble themselves for and to
cease from some of those sins whereof they be guilty (Exodus 34. 6, 7.) or else
for that they do not use due care and diligence to reach and attain some other
end which they ought to seek (if this clause does contain any thing which the
former clauses do not.)

R. 2. A sinful agreement between Professors. About forty years Magistrates did
not punish them for it, nor the Ministers reprove them for it; this, they who
were taught of God, did look on, as a fore runner of Gods wrath, even as a
sign, that it was near at hand. The reason of which opinion must of necessity
be this, that such a conspiracy is too like, Jer. 5. 30, 31. and does provoke
the LORD of Hosts unto great wrath, ( Acts 5. 9.) Which if it be true, (as, I
believe, it is) then we may well receive this for a truth, that the nearer we
Professors come to such a hellish consent, the more probable it is, that the
wrath of God will seize upon us, if it be not already upon us: and, if it be,
that this our consent has brought it upon us, or, at least, as much of it as
is peculiar to us. And the very truth is, the sinful agreement which is between
many of us, is too like such a conspiracy as the holy Prophet Jeremy in that
Chapter, ver. 30. calls a wonderful and horrible thing. For,

1. In the time of the Interruption, I took notice wherein O. Cromwell and our
Parliaments, Armies, Commitees, Commissioners, and Assembly of Divines, and
particular persons, Roundheads, etc. did miss the right, and did what they
ought not to have done; among other things, over-recompensing their members for
their losses [one Father and Son (as I have heard) with 5000 l. for the (pure)
loss of about or less than 5 l.].

2. Since that time the Covetousness, Pride, and Iniquity of many Professors
has been very considerable.

1. Whereof has been no small part, the Fashionmonging of Professors, and
particularly, the gay Lady-like attire and ornaments of shop-keeping women in
London. But it is said concerning them, that London does allow, what other
Towns do not. It may be so: howsoever, and although London has been my
Benefactor, yet I shall not justify the proudest of the Londoners in taking an
Ell, yea, or half an Ell, or a quarter of an Ell, when they be allowed but an
inch, especially at such a time of Adversity as this is. I had rather they
would consider seriously concerning Apparel and Ornaments that which is written
by Paul, 1 Timothy 2. 9, 10. and by Peter, 1 Pet. 3. 3, 4, 5. praying and taking
good heed, lest they be weighed in the balances and found wanting, ( Dan. 5.
27.) it may be to be nothing, ( Gal. 6. 3.) lest London be reduced to the state
of some other Cities, and that they fare as was prophesied, Zeph. 1. 8. and Es.
3. 17. to the 24.

2. The children and servants of many religious Families, being rude, profane,
and irreligious, the Heads of such Families, who have authority over them,
(somewhat like that of Magistrates and Ministers over the members of several
Families) do not use their authority in instructing, rebuking, and correcting
them for their disorderly behavior.

3. As some Conforming Ministers be godly, so I believe some Nonconforming
Ministers be altogether destitute of true godliness.

4. Whereas Ministers ought to be an example of the believers, in word, in
conversation, in spirit, in faith, in purity, 1 Timothy 4. 12. and a pattern of
good works; instead thereof (according to my hearing, and in part, seeing) some
Ministers have been, and some are little less than patterns and examples of
Covetousness, Pride, and Vanity. London Ministers of great means heretofore did
pay Country Ministers for preaching for them, with leaning on their Velvet
Cushions. One Minister being offered 100 l. to preach one Sermon weekly, said,
that was but a journey-mans wages. Another Minister, being a Nonconformist,
and too like the rich men in Jam. 5. 1, 2, 3. has taken such a large allowance
for himself and his four or five Daughters, of the worldly wealth which his
Master has committed to him, as his Steward to dispose to fit ends, that he
gives them for their portions 1000 l. a piece, together with Jewels in their
ears, and Bracelets of Pearl on their necks. According to Mr. Foxleyes judgment
and mine, it is not lawful for a man to say, Is it not lawful for me to do what
I will with my own? Mat. 20. 15. or, to keep what I will of my own for them of
my own Family? Not so Friends, every man ought to remember, that all that is in
the Heaven and in the Earth is Gods, 2 Chronicles. 29. 11, 14. and that he is but
Gods Steward over the good things which he possesses, and that it is required
in him, that he be found faithful in using and disposing of them, wherein he
ought to have great respect (if I may so speak) to the advantage of the owner,
and to the welfare of his people, and not to bestow too much on himself and his
own Children, to raise them high in the world, Agur did pray unto God, to feed
him with food convenient for him, Prove. 30. 8. But it is said, this man has
great Friends.

A. 1. It may be so: (some Preachers would receive none or almost none bur rich
persons into their Congregations, Jam. 2. 1. to 9.) But has he shown himself a
true and faithful Friend to them concerning their spiritual states and sins?
Jer. 23. 28. For some Preachers do daub with untempered mortar, Ezekiel. 13. 10.
Howsoever, I am confiden^, God does not allow such a Minister, to keep so much,
for his own wages, especially at such a time as this, when so many Saints have
need of things necessary for the body, 1 John 3. 17, 5. But what should I say
to the Nonconforming Ministers that wear Perrukes (or Petriwigs) (it may be,
made of the hair of a Thief and Whore) or too long hair (as many do) and
generally of such as are adorned like Gallants? Even this, that these things
ought not so to be; ( Jam. 3. 10.) and that, if they had had much fellowship in
the Gospel with Saint Paul, he would have taught them to be ashamed of such
fashions, 1 Cor. 11. 14. and that, if they had been professors, when old Mr.
Dod would not yield to the Lord Says des^re, to confer with him concerning
Religion, till he had cut his hair shorter, some of them would have looked on
such fashions as Puritans in those days did, viz. as suitable to Ruffians and
Swaggerers. But some of them have conformed to the world in these things (like
the Jesuits in the time of Queen Elizabeth) that they might not be known or
suspected to be Ministers. Did some sub i will Devil teach them, to add this
unfit practice to their sinful silence at the like sinful excess of others
before God did punish the City of London for it, and the rest of its sins with
the Pestilence, or did Belzeb^b himself (2 Timothy 2. 26.) teach it them, when
they ought to have rebuked their hearers sharply for not hearing that sore
scourge, and him who appointed it? I had almost said, for despisi^g the Lords
chastening, Prove. 3. 11. Is this an effect of the spirit of life from God his
entering into the two Witnesses, or their standing upon their feet? Rev. 11. 11.
or a work of the spirit of destruction rather? Why, Brethren, had it not been
lawful and fitter for you, to have contented your selves in all places with
such modest Apparel, (2 Timothy 2. 9.) whence strangers would have taken occasion
to look ^n you as Country Farmers, or mean shopkeepers, or of some other
calling whereinto it is now lawful for you to enter? Heb. 11. 37, 38. Could no
garb serve the turn, but such as would make you seem, what it is unlawful for
you to be, or to seem to be? (Ruffi^ns and swaggerers.) But it may be, ye have
begun to lay aside these Dehonestamenta, at least since ye hoped, there would
be no need of them.

6. As for Societies formally joined together by a special Covenant, (as if
they would do singular things) what I have observed and heard, cannot make me
believe, that near all their Members or Rulers do, (in admitting and refusing,
and instructing, admonishing, reprovi^^, and watching over one another) keep
close to the word of G^d an^ their own Discipline, and take due care to make
their Families like little Churches. And Mr. H. Peter's in his Sermon preached
in Newgate after his condemnation, viz. October. 14. 1660. There has been (quoth
mavelous miscarriages amongst Saints in their Church-relations. So he
verbatim.

7. As for the duty of reproving it is greatly neglected in both conference and
Preaching. 8. Even many of those Min^sters that are esteemed godly, do so
affect and hunt after curious and dainty words, and ornate expressions, as that
they do use in preaching and praying, as such, many that are strange, obscure,
and dark, and hard to be understood (1 Cor. 14, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 19.)
(it may be out of pride and vain glory, and to please, and to be highly
esteemed of men and women, and despising language easy to be understood (such
as God has taught me to use as rustical:) and hence it is, that their
preaching is not so good for the use of edifying, Ephesians. 4. 29. peradventure the
more profitable to the Preachers, as to the maintenance of their bodies, but
not so good to the use of edifying the Hearers spiritually. 9. Some do not duly
study and consider their Hearers, so as to know them, ( Jer. 8. 6.) and so know
not, what kind of Sermons, (for matter and manner) be most expedient for them.
Some do bestow too little time and study on their Sermons, hindered by other
less necessary studies and works; it may be studying and hunting after pleasing
words, rather, and more than profitable matter; it may be hindered by loitering
and idleness. 10. Some such Ministers, (it may be) do look on the business of
meddling with Professors sins, as like the taking of a shrewd Dog by the ears,
(Prove. 26. 17.) or worse; some (peradventure) fear the issue of displeasing
them, carnally: however it comes to p^ss; they do not speak unto those
Professors, with whom they have fellowship, concerning their sins, so
partic^larly, plainly home, pressingly and faithfully, as they ought to spe^k:
Prove. 20. 6. One Nonconforming Minister in h^s Sermon at Bristow, speaks of
naked breasts. It may be, desiring to have what he spoke, applied against other
devil taught fashions, not knowing, that naked breasts did take notes of
Sermons. Another in his Sermon speaks of sins under the name of the devils
Dainties; yet names the worshipping of stocks and stones only, that all who
heard him, might be the more confident, he did not mean any of their si^s! One
in his Sermon says of Hair, that if it be any thing (or ever so little)
longer, than the Scripture allows of, it is a sin. Unde^standing men might
speak more than this, etc. 1 Cor. 11. 14. An^her in his Sermon says, This
Dispensation calls on us, to be more spiritual and heavenly. I would have a
Preacher trust in God, and cry with the throat; (if he be able) to lift up his
voice like a Trumpet, and to show those who have gotten the name of Phanaticks,
their sins and transgressions, and that plainly, etc. I would have him say,
Brethren and Sisters, it is high ^ime for us, to reform our conversation
universally, without any exception or limitation, without any so far and so
far, to change very much of our behav^our. 2. This dispensation cries unto us,
to be less carnal, and less sensual, and less earthly minded; to be spiritually
minded, and more tractable; to throw away with a holy abhorrency and
detestation, our covetousness and worldliness, our immoderate sparing, our
excessive spending, our voluptuousness, and love of pleasure and ease, our
pride, ostentation, ambition, vanity, vain glory, envy, curiosity,
fashionmonging, carnal mirth and jollity, foolish, vain, idle and frothy
communication, bitter and unseemly jests, frolicks and boyish toying, and the
despising of our heavenly Father's chastenings, Prove. 3. 11. Numb. 12. 14, 15.
naming the sins of Professors punctually. [I would have a Preacher do more than
all this.]

R. 3. Thirdly, whereas that which most of us look on, as the forest of our
afflictions, is not payments of money for the use of our King, etc. but want of
liberty and peace, and of a well-grounded assurance of liberty and peace: A^e
we without these, because we ask them not? No, und^ub^edly, we have prayed for
liberty and peace often, and, it may be some of us, for an assurance of it. And
to whom would our liberty and peace be be^efici^l? To us, or to others? Ye will
say, to us, and some to two or three an eyesore, an ear-sore, and a
heart-sore, even vexation of spirit. Which if it be true, as I think, it is;
whose sins then, think you, have deprived (...) of our liberty and peace, and
kept it so long from us? Our own sins, to whom it would be a considerable part
of our happiness, or theirs, to whom it would be no gain at all, and to some
among them a purse-loss, and to some grief of mind? can any think, the sins of
others, or the sins of the Nation in general? V^rily, what shift some men of
much wit may make to entertain a foolish conceit, I know not^ but for my own
part, I cannot hold back my mind from attributing our want of liberty and peace
to our own sins, to whom it would be a great favor and benefit, rather than to
the sins of Heathens, Mahometans, Jews, or Papists, or of the whole Nation, or
of any part of the Nation, other than our selves, because it would be
unprofitable to them.

6. Now for the sixth Point; What have we done, to better our estates, or to
obtain of God, to better them?

A. We have not rebelled, insurrected or seditioned with Venner. We have kept
up our forms of Godliness; prayed by Families, and Members of div^rs Families
jointly, and many of us apart secretly; prayed with Fasting, pra^ed (all our
prayers put together) very many prayers; some of us very elegant, fine, and
dainty prayers, [too ornate, trim, curious, quaint, and fine prayers] as if
they had been petitioning the Emperor Julius Caesar; (1 Cor. 2. 1, 2, 3, 13.)
and many of us, (some of mean parts) have uttered long prayers, and some have
prayed too long prayers (too long for Courts of earthly Princes) as if they
hoped to overcome the infinitely wise God with their verbosity and much tal^
(...); (...) Eccl. 5. 1, 2, 3.) Mat. 6. 7, 8. and v. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.) or as
if ^^ey did lengthen and stretch out their prayers, to make the younger sort
and servants weary of Religion before they know what it is. (Mat. 23. 14. Mar.
12. 4. Luke 20. 47. Eccl. 7. 14.) We have used some other holy Ordinances, we
have Preached* prayed and fasted eight or nine hours together; [it may be
bowing down our heads as Bulrushes, Isa. 58. 5.] We have prayed to him who is
Allsufficient, Genesis 17. 1. and in whose hand all men's hearts are, Prove. 21. 1.
And what have we asked of him? Liberty and freedom from Troubles, and an end of
this time of Satan's great wrath, etc. And for our Rulers we have asked heavenly
wisdom, to take the best course that can be taken, for their spiritual welfare
and everlasting felicity. And some of us, it may be, have added som^thing ^o
their forms of Godliness, prayed somewhat oftener. But as for the visible
reforming of our ways according to the word of God, that our sins may not
hind^r our prayers, I cannot say, I know, That a considerable number of us have
in that way shown themselves duly sensible of their own and their brethrens
sufferings, and dang^rs, and sins, or that our conference, or talking, when we
meet together, is much bettered.

7. For the seventh Point; As Fishermen use to draw up their nets our estates,
and for one of the events, the return of our Prayers, what we have gained by
them; that, if there be cause, we may use the best dilig ence we can, to amend
our prayers. Now as to this particular, it may be, we have prevailed, in some
measure for some Governors; but as for our selves, as many of us have enjoyed
more liberty and peace than some of our Brethren, (for which, I fear, we have
not been duly thankful to our heavenly Father, nor made such use of our liberty
unto the promoting of Christ's interest, and the welfare of his people, as we
ought to have done:) ( Jam. 4. 3.) so none of the Plows or Gears are broken,
Psalm. 129. 3, 4, So many Summers and Harvests are past, and there is not a
general and full deliverance; yea, the causes of our dangers and fears are
augmented: at length (so many of) our Ministers must bid farewell to Cities and
Corporations. And thus much of the seventh particular which we ought to
consider.

8. In the eighth place, If ye desire to know, why God has not Marg. 25. For
Professors have not yet thoroughly believed, and feelingly acknowledged, and
duly considered, his Kingdom, and Power, and Providence, and the threatenings of
his Law and Gospel, and the Judgment to come, and learned to fear God in regard
of small sins. They have not duly studied and endeavored to be sensible of the
comforts and benefits, and use of true grace, and of the assurance of God's
fatherly love, and of the evils of being without those good things, nor
constantly and seriously used all God's means to get them, nor duly sought his
mercy and favor in prosperity and adversity, nor made such use as they ought,
of their liberty, peace, prosperity and opportunities for their own spiritual
good, and the good of others, especially of God's people. They have not
accomplished a diligent search to find out all their sins, old, forgotten,
secret, etc. nor humbled themselves under the mighty hand of God for them, with
godly, inward and deep sorrow and mourning, and so particularly as they ought
to have done, nor cast all their pride and spiritual filthiness out of their
hearts, and ceased to do evil, and learned to do, each man and woman, his and
her whole duty, nor duly endeavored, without exceptions and reservations, so
to do. They have not, wi^h due care and diligence, tried th^i^ graces and
spiritual gifts, and endeavored to know their election of God, and to grow in
all graces, especially Faith, Hope, Humility and Meekness (to bear the wrath of
God, and rage of men, with a quiet spirit) and in spiritual gifts, and to be
rooted and established in Jesus Christ the Lord, and in the knowledge and love
of his Truths, and invincibly resolved to cleave in love to him and them for
ever: They have trusted in themselves, and in the world, expecting (without any
good cause) favor and peace from it. Under crosses and being in trouble, they
have not shown themselves patient and calm-spirited, and so valiant for Christ
and his Truths, as they ought to have been; some not at all putting their seals
to the Truths and Righteousnesses of the Gospel, some complying with the world
basely. They have not been duly thankful to God for their liberty and peace,
and the comforts, helps and deliverances which he has vouchsased them in
distresses and dangers, nor prayed and given thanks for one another comforts
under the Cross, deliverances and peace; at least, as they ought to have done,
and should have done, if we had been knit together with brotherly love, Col. 2.
2. They have not exercised and shown forth their graces and spiritual gifts as
they should have done; for the increasing of them and the honor of Christ,
especially their Faith, Zeal for God and his people, Humility and Patience.
They have not prayed mightily for the destruction of Babylon, and of the
Kingdom of Antichrist. They have not used all due diligence, to find and know
all the naughty things which are in their hearts, nor taken due care to know,
which of those he has and does most favor, and endeavored very seriously to
beat it down. My meaning is, that, of the said sins and faults, some Professors
be guilty of these, and some of those, and some of many. (The truth is,
Professors be so sanity in their Hair and the Apparel, and the Ornaments of the
body, and concerning other matters, that it is a very difficult thing for us
Ministers (the Lord be merciful to us) to learn, how to do our duty in seeking
to reform them.)

9. So that in the ninth and last place, if we would know, what it

But to speak more fully and more plainly concerning, at least, some matters,
and concerning some not before spoken of: First, we may do well to consider
what enemies the true Religion has on this side, and beyond the Seas, and that
now, some think, they have a Plot to destroy it universally; and what has been
done of late at Sea and at home, what has befallen London, Norwich,
Colchefter, Portsmouth, etc. and the distress and dangers, wherein we yet are,
and what signs we see in Heaven or on earth, etc. of our liberty and peace
hereafter. Ye also know there was a time, when there was no remedy, 2 Chronicles.
36. 16. The consideration whereof (without any more words) should be of force
enough to move us (unless we be content to suffer with Gedaliab the son of
Ahikam, Jer. 40. with 41.) to put away our folly and negligence, and to use all
lawful and fit addresses unto the higher Powers, whereby to better our
condition, especially to prevail with God, to better it, ( Neh. 2. 17. Exodus
10. 7. Prove. 6. 6. and 12. 24. Heb. 2. 3.)

2. I would not have you think, that the continuance of our forms of godliness,
(how specious and large soever they be) will serve the turn. For we have used
them a long time already, and our estate is such as I have told you. Neither do
I think, that the amplifying of our forms would do it. For in my younger years,
when some godly persons in and near Shrew, bury did enter into a Resolution, to
enlarge their Forms) (to pray o^tner than formerly, to fast oftener, and to win
others to do the like: where of (as I in those days heard) a godly Ministers
Wife said, They had found out a way to kill the Devil. Yet, Devil from rising
higher and higher. To what should we impute this, rather than to our sinful
silence at the aberrations one of another, and suffering sin one upon another
(our not instructing, admonishing, reproving, and encouraging, and giving good
counsel one to another) and the Elder Professors not being good Examples to the
Younger; I say, we should attribute the prevailing of Satan contrary to our
prayers, rather th^n to these and the rest of our sins whereof we had not duly
repented, and taken due care to forsake (2 Cor. 12. 20. 21.) This sinful and
pernicious silence was too common in those days, as it is in these,
notwithstanding it is contrary to the true meaning of the special Covenant
which has been entered.

Beloved Friends, it has been, and is one of the too common faults of
Professors, Ministers and others, to receive or let pass, as true Christians,
all that cease from gross sins, hear Gods word, ke^p up Gods worship in their
Families, and use to go to meetings; which yet is but a form of godliness, and,
without a more full reformation of our ways, to better than a bribe offered to
the judge of all the earth, to blind his eyes, or stop his mouth, or turn back
his hands from striking us; and the great God, who without respect of persons,
judges according to every man's work [even his own children, 1 Pet. 1. 17.] he
will take no Bribes, Deuteronomy. 16. 19.) 2. So, that it concerns us, ( to learn how)
to open our eyes, to see our sins, both open and secret, and particularly the
iniquity of our holy things. And first, for the defects and faults of our
Prayers.

1. Some of us (I believe many of us) have no grace at all, Marg. 125, 116,
127, 128. and therefore do pray out of Christ and without Christ (John 15. 5.)
without faith, without humility, (Jam. 4. 5. 1 Pet. 5. 5.) Without repentance,
without the love of God, without godly fear, etc. (Heb. 12. 28.) and therefore
also, when they pray, they do regard iniquity in their hearts, Psalm. 66. 16.
and pray, without due respect to God and his Church, Jam. 4. 3. Hos. 10. 1.

2. I believe, concerning many regenerate persons, that unbelief, and pride do
prevail much in their prayers; that they do often come short of serving God in
their prayers with reverence and godly fear, Heb. 12. 28. and often come near
that which David in Psalm. 66. 18. calls the regarding of iniquity in their
hearts, (which is when a man will keep this or that sin, whether God will hear
his prayers or not.) I do also fear, that many a godly man prays unto God now
and than, in words, to do this or that for his Church, whilst, with his heart,
he aims at his own good only, without due respect to Gods honor, and the
well-being of his Church; which I conceive, to be the iniquity spoken of Jam.
4. 3. For whatsoever a man asks of God immediately for himself, he ought to ask
for God also, viz. to the end he may be the more willing, or the more able, or
have the more opportunities to promote Christ's interest, or to some such end.
For all things are, as of God, and through God, so also for God, Romans 11. 36 So
that, wheth^r we eat or drink, or whatsoever we do, we ought to do all to his
glory, 1 Cor. 10. 31. And, as all things do work together for good to them who
love God, Romans 8. 28. so we ought in most of our Petitions for our selves (if
not in all) to aim at the good of those who love God. I think so.

Secondly, as to our Fasts; they are (as many of us use them)

1. Too like a sudden Land-floud, which is quickly gone into the River, and the
ground anon after, almost as dry as at the beginning of the storm. For so the
shows which some make at Fasts, of sorrow and mourning, are soon turned into
Feasting carnal jollity (Jam. 4. 9) and vain communication.

2. So that, I fear, they be too like the penances and scourges of (some)
Papists, which they use to the flesh, Gal. 5. 13.

But, to speak more generally, many of us in respect of our forms of Es. 58.
who did seek God (after their manner) daily and ask of him (with their mouths)
the Ordinances of Justice, and afflict their souls with fasting, bowing down
their heads as Bulrushes, and spreading sackcloth and ashes under them, and
make a show of delighting to know Gods ways, and in approaching unto God, all
which did not prevail with God to case them of their grievances and
afflictions, ver. 3. And why? even, because they did not forsake their sinful
practices, but went on still in them, Psalm. 68. 21. And hence it is, that the
Lord 1. Commands the Prophet, to cry aloud, to lift up his voice like a
Trumpet, and to show them their sins and transgressions, and that ver. 3. he
spreads before them a particular of their Trespasses, and signifies to them,
that it is a foolish and fond thing for them, to think, that it is enough for
them to afflict themselves (now and then) for a day, (and there is an end of the
business) 1 Timothy 4. 8. as if God would approve and accept of Fasts, and hear
Prayers, when they be not joined with sincere repentance and amendment of life;
as also he mentions some of the most considerable sins of the Jews at that time
as fittest to be insisted on: which I believe, is the cause why David, Ps. 24.
4. mentions the lifting up of the soul unto vanity and swearing deceitfully,
and why Mic. chapter 6. 8. mentions doing justly, and loving mercy, and humbling
our selves to walk with God, or wal^ing humbly with God. O that our Preachers
at time would be persuaded to imitate them, viz. to tell them who hear them
preach, punctually and plainly of the most considerable of their iniquities,
and, if doing so will not cause them to reform all their ways speedily, then
to cry aloud unto them, and to deal faithfully and plainly with them concerning
their sins and abominations, (and not to cease from reproving, until they have
drawn or driven them out of all their unwarrantable practices, (Lev. 19. 17. 2 Timothy 4. 2. as Acts 12. 5.) For Mic. 6. 6, 7. the graceless man is represented,
as it were, acting his part upon a stage; and his business is, to please God,
and to obtain pardon of his sins, and to that end, to bestow somewhat on God.
Neither is he altogether empty of good words; he calls him whose savor he
seeks, JEHOVAH, twice, and the most high God, and speaks of bowing himself
before him, and of being at great cost with him* of bu^nt-offerings, thousands
of Rams, ten thousands of Rivers of Oil, yea, of gi^ing his first born for the
sin of his soul, (which is more than much money given to godly Preachers;) but
not one word of leaving his sins, and doing his du^y. And therefore it is, that
he who answers him, shows him, w^a^ is good [in the sight of the LORD] and what
he requires of him; namely, to do justly, and to love mercy, and to humble
himself to walk with his God. So that this is, as a Touch stone to Gold, the
abandoning of all our sins, and the cleansing of all our ways according to the
Rules of Gods word: which a godless man is not thoroughly content to do, but
would rather buy a pardon with one or two of his Children, than to part with
all his sins and the sweet fruits of them. Which kind of liberal dealing with
God, how unacceptable it is to him, and how unavailable the holy Ordinances
which he has commanded, be with him without reformation of our ways, ye may
also see ( if ye have hearts to understand) in Es. 1. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Es. 66. 3, 4. and Am. 5. 21, 22, 23, 24. (I pray, read and
consider seriously all these Verses.) Friends I may well speak unto many of you
(in another LORD speaks to his people, Es. 58. 6, of letting the oppressed go
free. For ye do oppress some of the Truths which ye have received into your
minds, but not the love of them into your hearts. Ye do hold them (as those
Romans 1. 18.) in unrighteousness; ye do keep them in prison. I beseech you, let
them all walk at liberty; let them prevail in your words and deeds: practice
them in your houses, in your shops, in the streets; and, as there is occasion,
in all places and companies; behave your selves according to those truths which
ye know, constantly. Without this, as ye may desire and not obtain, because ye
Jam. 4. 3. Yea, without this Reformation, ye may use all the holy Ordinances of
God externally and that constantly, and neither your persons, nor your services
be accepted with God. For God will not receive bribes. I cannot tell you of
this too often, ( Phil. 3. 1.)

But fourthly, to speak somewhat more punctually,

1. Say in thy heart, If the King of Saints be with us, why are we thus? Exodus
34. 6. and waits that he may be gracious, Es. 30. 18. nor in high Priests
Intercession; the father hears him always: and as for h^s protecting of us,
all power is given to him in Heaven and in Earth, Mat. 28. 18. Why then are not
the Plowgears cut asunder, or the Plows thrown to the hedge? Why are we still
under the rods of the Almighty? Surely the fault is in us; the cause is our
sins; it is by reason of our sins.

2. Consider, who they were, that, when they were imprisoned, said, we are
verily guilty concerning our Brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul,
when he be sought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this distress upon
us, Genesis 41. 21, 22. and what woman, when her Son was dead, said unto Elias,
Art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? 2
King. 17. 17, 18. and who said unto the Mariners, Jon. 1. 12. I know, that for
my sake this tempest is upon you; and who, when our Savior told his Apostles,
one of them would betray him, said, Lord, is it I? And who asked that question
last. That was Judas, Mat. 26. 21, 22. 25. Consider, I say these persons, and
thy self; What hand thou have had in pulling down wrath on the Nation, or on
Professors, Psalm. 19, 12, 13. and beg very earnestly of God, to direct thee to
judge rightly of this matter.

3. Consider, whether thou be one of them, that did heretofore many
Professors did) abuse and not make such use as they ought to have done of their
Liberty, Peace, Means, Authority, and opportunities of doing God and his people
service; and whether thou be one of them, who in the time of their prosperity
did not consider, pity, and show favor to the sufferers of that time,
especially the conscientious ones, as far forth as they were in duty bound so
to do. For it is probable, God will chastise us for abusing and not making
aright use of his blessings, by depriving us of them.

4. Because we have not Rules by which in all cases to discern clearly, Psalm.
51. 5. Es. 3. 16. to the end, Ezekiel. 22. Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Tit. 1. 15. Mat.
5. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 28, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 44. and 15. 19. Mark 7. 21,
22. Romans 1. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. 1 Cor. 5. 8. and 6. 9, 10. and 11. 14. 2 Cor.
20. 21. Gab. 5. 19 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Ephesians. 4. 25, 26, 29, 31, 32. and 5. 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 21, 22, 23, 25; 28 29. Phil. 22. 3, 4, 5. etc. ver. 21. Col. 3.
5, 6, 7, 8, 9; 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. and 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1 These.
5. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21; 22. 1 Timothy 2. 9, 10. and 6. 8, 9,
10, 11. 2 Timothy 3. 1, 2, 3 4, 5 6, 7. Tit. 2. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
Heb. 13. 16, 17, 18. Jam, 3. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. and 4. 1. and 5. 16. 1
Pet. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10. 2 Pet. 2. 7 8. 1 John 3. 18, 17. Rev. 2. 4, 5.
and 3. 1, 2, 3, 15 16, 17. and 21. 8. Romans 12. 2. and 14. 21. 1 Cor. 8. 13. Why
not also of By fields Catalogue of sins, or the like books, and of the
exemplary behavior of the best Professors, that thou conversest with? It may
be, sometimes it would be wisdom in thee, to take their silence at thy words
for a reproof of them. And be sure, because it is a very difficult thing for a
man to understanding his errors, ( Psalm. 19. 12.) to imitate Job, chap. 13.
23. requesting the God of knowledge, to make thee know and understand thy sins
and transgressions.

5. Consider thy sins together with the afflictions which God has sent the
considering of our ways; Hagg. 1. 5, 6, 7 9, 10, 11. and thinking on our ways,
Psalm. 119. 59. viz. of considering our doings and the events of them) and take
good notice, that that Commandment in Hagg. 1. is repeated, and consider, why
it is repeated, which (I judge), is, because it highly concerns men, to
consider their doings, and the success of them, and that seriously (that they
may turn their feet unto Gods testimonies, Psalm. 119. 59.) and because many be
so slow to consider them, etc.

6. I advise thee, as thou find out thy sins, to confess them before Lev.
26. 40, 41. Lam. 3. 41. to 47. and to humble thy self under his mighty and
correcting hand for them, and as thou can, for thy. unknown sins also, ( Jam.
4. 10. 1 Pet. 5. 6, 10. Psalm. 19. 12.) not too easily contenting thy self with
any measure of sorrow for thy sins (yet not grieving so as to disable thy self
for any service or business of any sort.) For sometimes men are not quickly
cleansed from their iniquities, as those Josh. 22. 17. no nor duly contrite and
humbled for them, as those Jer. 44. 10. And, I fear, this is the case of many
of us Professors, even in this perilous time, and that many of us do not well
understand our sins of common life.

7. Accept of the punishment of thine iniquity, Lev. 26. 41. and that with the
whole heart; thy mouth and heart really yielding and acknowledging, that our
God has punished thee (O far less) than thy iniquities deserve, (Ezr. 9. 13.)

8. And forsake and cease from all thy sins, resolve thoroughly, to strive
seriously against them all, not excepting so much as one of them, no not the
least and most profitable of them. And do this with a holy hatred and
detestation of them, hating them for God, because they be enemies to him,
saying in thy heart, Get ye hence, ye enemies of my God, get ye hence, (Es. 30.
32. Mat. 4. 10.) And having once cast away thy sins, sin no more, lest worse
things come unto thee, ( John 5. 4.) but walk in all the Commandments and
Ordinances of the Lord uprightly and blamless:) and among other duties.

1. Be really thankful to him, who is the Fountain of all good things, for
extending his goodness to thee and the rest of his people in such and such
matters, giving him hearty and humble thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, Col. 3. 15. Ephesians. 5. 20. especially for thy and their liberty and peace.

2. Let the love of Christ constrain thee to love him, because he dyed for that
very end; 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. To the uttermost of thy abilities, promote his
interest, and, for his sake, his peoples happiness, by doing him and them, as
many good services as thou can.

3. Mispend not time, but redeem time, for Gods service and the soul, because
the days be evil, Ephesians. 5. 17.

4. Take heed to thy ways, that thou sin not with thy tongue, Psalm. 39. 1.
Psalm. 34. 11, 12, 13. 2 Pet. 3. 10. Jam. 1. 26.

5 Take due care to remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, Exodus 20. 8.

6. Also remember thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and
thy maidservant, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, Exodus 20. 10. yea,
not only on the Sabbath day, but generally at all times to use thy diligence,
that thy Family may be as a little Church of Christ, as Philemons was, Phil.
ver. 1. 2. (I have specifyed these duties, because so many Professors do so
much neglect them.) It will be thy wisdom, to follow all this good counsel. For
the LORD God, is a Sun and shield to them that walk uprightly; he will give
them grace and glory; he will withhold no good thing from them, Psalm. 4. 11.
Prove. 16. 17.

9. Learn of God, to commit and leave thy self to him, as the righous to do
with thee, what he pleases, and particularly, to better thy estate when and in
what measure he pleases, Psalm. 10. 14. Phil. 4. 11. But remember and study thy
own weakness, that thou art not sufficient of thy self, to do any thing well as
of thy self, without Christ, John 15 5. 2 Cor. 3. 5. Therefore stir up thy
self, to take hold of Christ (Es. 64. 6, 7.) as the strength of the LORD, (Es.
27. 4. 5.) Even on our Lord Jesus Christ, who is mighty to save, even able to
save unto the uttermost all them who came unto God by him, Es. 63. 1. Heb. 7.
25. Psalm. 89. 19. Phil. 4. 13. (The want of this hinders the profiting of
Professors very much.

10. Also humble thy self daily for thy infirmities and daily failings.

11. Also give all diligence, to make thy Calling and Election Faith and
Patience may be increased, 2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7, 10. and 3. 17, 18. and 1 Pet 5.
9, 10. Romans 5. 2, 3, 4. Jam. 1. 3, 4.

12. Be sure to consider seriously, every one of you in particular, wherein he
or she can do God or his people service, and resolve with a strong resolution,
if it shall please him, to put an end to your Adversity, (with his gracious and
blessed assistance) to serve him and them accordingly.

13. Lastly, at all times, even whilst thou art doing these things, and when
thou have done them all, and done much for God and his people, depend not on
any thing which thou have done, (as if thou had thereby, or therewith made
satisfaction in any measure to Gods justice for thy sins, or any of them, or
merited any good thing at his hands, but rely for thy justification and
acceptance with God, and everlasting salvation, on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
the free grace of God in and through him, admiring his free grace.

Qu. But what ought those Professors to do, who know, think, or doubt, they be
not born again?

Answ. That which is most proper for them to do is, to exercise themselves
constantly in the word of Truth, waiting for the gracious operation of the holy
Spirit in and on their souls, to beget them again, or else to show them Christ
already formed in their souls, Joh. 14. 16, 17. Gal. 4. 19. But withal they
ought to follow the good counsel before rehearsed; and all Professors, when
cause is, to do, what many Professors very seldom or never do, viz. to ask the
advice of able and godly Professors, especially Ministers, and not to keep the
devils counsel; not to secret matters according to his counsel.

Note. If God in chastizing any of us, does aim at any of the ends hear the
rod; and [him] who has appointed it, yielding to him concerning it; let that
be done which he shoots at in chastizing thee.

If thou desire to know more medicines, which it behooves thee to use for the
bettering of thy estate.

1. Enquire and consider frequently, whether thou have any true Formalist
cannot have.

2. Consider and study as exactly and wisely as thou can, thy own sins, and
what thou have deserved at Gods hands by them, taking heed that thou think not
too ill of other folks sins, as of the Professors and other inhabitants of
London, Southwark, Norwich, Colchester, Portsmouth, as if they were sinners
above others, worse sinners than others. Take heed of this, Luke 13. 1, 2.

3. Mortify all the members of the old man; the flesh with all the affections
and lusts, even all thy ungodly lusts, Col. 3. 5. Ephesians. 5. 24. For this work
some of Dr. Prestons Sermons are of very good use.

4. Give due diligence, to be exercised under the chastening hand of God, to
the bettering of thy spiritual estate, Heb. 12. 10. 11.

5. Draw near to God often; ( Psalm. 73. 28. Jam. 4. 9.) viz. to hear his word, by
prayer; but be sure, when thou drawest nigh to him, to sanctify him, I mean,
to testify to thy own conscience, the high account which thou make of his
Holinest, by thy holy and reverend usage of the holy things; which I take to be
the sanctifying of the LORD, Lev. 10. 3. (See how they be like to fare, that do
draw nigh to the LORD and not sanctify him, v. 1, 2, 3.)

6. Seek unto God, to work for thee and thy brethren; seek his favor according
to his will (revealed in the holy Scriptures) that he may hear thee, and thy
brethren, Hos. 5. 15. and 6. 1, 2, 3. 1 John 5. 14, 15.

7. Let thy heart be prepared unto this work, Psalm. 10. 17. yea, and thy ways
also. But if thy heart be, thy ways will. [And here consider, 1. When the
peoples hearts were prepared, then God hearkened to Hezekiahs prayer for them,
and healed them (in respect of their discomforts, fears and discouragements.) 2 Chronicles. 30. 18, 19. 2. Jotham, King of Judah, became mighty, because he prepared
his way before the LORD his God, 2 Chronicles. 27. 6. Remember this. 3. If a man
does purge himself from his wood and earth, he shall be a vessel Tim. 20. 21.]
All of you remember, who said, When the Son of man comes, shall he find faith
on the earth? Luke 18. 8. Stir up faith in thy own heart, and in the hearts of
thy fellow-professors, to look on and expect better times, as if they were
visible to the eyes of the body, or coming within a few leagues of us, and wait
for them with patience, Heb. 11. 1, 13. Romans 4. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. and 8. 25.
and show thy self resolute and courageous, when there is cause, as if thou were
in no danger. Let it appear before the sons of men, that thou trustest in God,
Psalm. 31. 19.

I shall now speak of some things, which, I think, may conduce Prove. 22. 6. 2.
See that thou can render a good reason for all the parts of thy
Nonconformity. 3. When thou prayest, be sure to serve God in thy prayers, and
to pray for God, Prove. 16. 4. I mean, with due respect to his honor and glory,
and aiming at it, Jam. 4. 3. 4. Apply thy self to God with earnest prayers and
bearty thanksgivings for the Church of God, the Nation, the Governors of it,
the Parliament, foreign Plantations, the People of Christ in all Countries,
(converted and unconverted) and enemies and persecutors (if there be any.) It
may be, God does not grant the requests which some make to him for themselves,
because they do not love and pray as they ought for others, even their enemies,
Mat. 5. 44. Luke 23. 34. Act. 7. 60. And as for our King, who knows, whether he
be come to these Kingdoms, to do very much good for the Church of God? 5.
Receive no manner of person as a Brother, because he is against some of the
things of the Church of England, but rather learn, how to behave thy self
toward Familists, Ranters, (Triumphers) Quakers, Swenkfildians, 2. Tim. 3. 5.
2 Pet. 2. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. 2 John v. 10, 11. Jude v. 10, 12, 13. 6.
Think it more necessary, to amend thy manner of praying and fasting, than to
make long prayer, or to pray or fast ofener. Friends, I would gladly have you
all amend your conversation, and walk more accurately and precisely. Give me
leave to put you in mind, among other things, of that, which may possibly move
you so to do.

1. What if ye knew good cause to be confident, that ye should have liberty and
peace, and worldly prosperity, and be freed from all grievances, and that God
would not at all punish or chastize you for your sins? Would it then be to your
hurt, to amend your beha^i^ur upon the admonition or request of an old man, and
to fill his heart with gladness at the age of 72? For in the sight of God, it
is good so to do, Mic. 6. 8.] And the Proverb says, Every thing is the better
for the amending; and the wisdom which is from above, is tractable, easy to be
entreated, Jam. 3. 17. viz. to do that which is good in God's sight, tending
unto his honor, or the good of any of h^s people. Yea, the Lord does require
of me, and of all you, to grow in grace, 2 Pet. 3. 18. to make straight paths
for our feet, Heb. 12. 13. to walk circumspectly, accurately, precisely, Ephesians.
5. 15. to cause our moderation (and other graces) to be known to all men, Phil.
4. 5. and to let our light to shine so before men, that they may see our good
works, and glorify our Father who is in heaven, Mat. 5. 16. What Is become of
this Light? where and when shines it? Verily the light of many Professors is a
very dim light, and scarce visible in their conversings, excepting the daily
pract se of their forms of Godliness, and a few other good words at times. We
had some not long since, who were called new Lights: of that kind of Lights, I
desire no more, but such as John Baptist was, burning and shining lights, Joh.
5. 55. such as burn inwardly with true zeal, and shine outwardly by and in good
works. Also the great God commands us, to wash our selves, so as to make our
selves clean; to put away the evil of our doings from before his eyes; to cease
to do evil, and learn to do well, etc. Isa. 1. 16, 17. and our most dear
Friend, Jesus Christ, teaches us, to do singular things, more than others,
Mat. 5. 47. and tells us plainly, that except our righteousness shall exceed
the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, we shall in no case enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven, Mat. 5. 19. And, how must it exceed their righteousness?
chiefly by believing in Jesus Christ, and by purging the heart from all
spiritual (...), and by judgment and mercy, Mat. 23. 23. Why Friends, the
ungodly man, in Mic. 6. 6, 7. speaks of himself, as content to purchase leaving
his sins, and doing his duty; beyond whom ye must go, in being thoroughly
content, to part with your sins, and to do your duty, or else suffer, wh^t ye
are unwilling to suffer. But the love of Christ in dying for poor miserable
sinners, when they were without strength to help themselves, and unworthy to be
pitied and helped, constrains those who live by and through him, not to live
to themselves, but to him who died for them, and rose again, 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15.

2. Brethren, ye ought to reform your conversings universally and unreservedly,
completely: 1. That your sins may be blotted out, etc. Act. 3. 19. 2. That ye
may attain that great salvation, Prove. 28. 13. 2 Cor. 7. 10. 3. That ye may be
vesse^s unto honor, meet for the Masters use, 2 Timothy 2. 21, 22. 4. That ye may
be blameless and harmless, the children of God, without rebuke in the midst of
the Nation among whom ye live, Phil. 2. 15. 5. That ye may be able to pray as
the Psalmist prays, Psalm. 119. 28, 41 58, 76. 107, 116, 154, 169, 176. 6. That
your prayers may be the more effectual, and of the greater force toward the
(near-approaching) destruction of Babylon, and the hastening of Christ's reign
on earth, (if he shall reign here otherwise than now he does, either in person,
or by the Saints) and the coming down of the holy City, the new Jerusalem, from
God out of Heaven, when the glory and and prosperity of the Church militant on
earth shall be next to that of the Church triumphant in Heaven: against which
time we ought to be prepared, as a Bride adorned for her Husband, Ephesians. 5. 27.
Rev. 21. 1, 2. Do not these things require an exact and plenary Reformation,
even the cleansing of our selves from all filthiness, both of the flesh and
spirit, 2 Cor 7. 1. and the keeping of our selves unspotted from the world?
Jam. 1. 27. I think they do.

3. But let me show you, wherefore I think, that of the Professors England,
many be mere Formal^sts, and many born again, who are one or more degrees too
short of that exact and even walking which is called for, Ephesians. 5. 15. and Heb.
12. 12, 13. First, Solomon, Prove. 16. 7. says, When a man's ways please the
LORD, he makes his enemies to be at peace with him. If this Scripture be of no
great force now, to make us fear, that the ways of many Professors do not
please the Lord; I pray God, we may not be, as it were enforced to fear it
hereafter by the increase of our afflictions. Secondly, it is something to my
purpose, which we read of the weakness and failings of the twelve Apostles in
the Histories of the Gospel; and of Paul or Barnabas, Act. 15. 16. etc. and of
Peter and Barnabas, Gal. 2. 11. etc. and in the Scriptures of the failings of
others, whereof I have named many, Marg. 32, 33, 34. The Scriptures do witness,
that God's Covenant-servants, yea his holy servants, have missed it in a
considerable measure, before the Law, and under the Law, and under the Gospel.
2. The devils are as malicious, as cruel, as strong, as cunning, as industrious
and watchful, as they have at any time hitherto been; and if they have not
gotten some skill by experience (as some think they have) yet, if this be part
of the time prophesied of, Rev. 12. 12. the devil is very wroth against the
Church of Christ, more wroth than he has ordinarily used to be. And for the
flesh in us, that is, by nature, in respect of Temptations, the same in all
men, and there is, some quantity of it, in the best men, Gal. 5. 17. And the
world, that also is, as to the tempting of men with its baits and allurements,
(speaking in a general manner) the very same, which it has been from the
beginning; only it is much fuller of such traps and snares, than formerly. So
that an understanding and impartial stranger may think, we have been and be as
likely to trespass against our God as his servants of old have been. 3. Is not
this part of the time concerning which the faithful and true witness foretold,
Mat. 24. 12. that iniquity should abound, and the love, of many wax cold? I
believe, it is, and part of those perilous times which Paul prophesied of, 2 Timothy 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and that the Formalists there spoken of, be, many
of them, such as have a spacious and specious form of godliness, yea that many
of them be men and women of this Nation, because it has so huge a multitude of
Professors. For the fuller any Country is of such, the more probable it is,
that there be among them many mere Formalists. But 4. my own experience and
observation in near 50 years, the unfit words which I heard with my ears, and
the actions which I have seen with my eyes, and that which I have heard of
credible persons, and my rational conjectures; these do tell me, that it may be
very truly said of many Professors, which Moses spoke of the Israelites, Deuteronomy.
29. 4. that they have not a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to
hear unto this day. For many Professors do so behave and carry themselves, as
if the forsaking of some gross sins, entering into an excellent way of the
Protestant Religion, a partial form at home, and going to Meetings, were the
four integral parts of godliness. Insomuch, that, when there was a report, that
the Act of the Ministers removal five miles was rerejected, there came to my
mind, (according to that which I feared would come to pass) the word of the
LORD, Jer. 37. 10. Though ye^ had smitten the whole Army of the Caldeans that
fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them; yet should
they rise up, and b^rn this City with fire.

4. But let me speak somewhat more of the Holiness and prosperity Babylon. I
cannot but expect a greater Reformation, than I yet see, of the conversings of
P^ofessors, before the ruin of Babylon; that their transgressions may not
hinder their prayers for the destruction of it: and as for the superlative
tranquillity and happiness of the true Church on earth, which shall be next to
that of Heaven; I believe, the foregoer of it will be a very through and full
Reformation, and a more sinless and heaven-like life of the true Christians,
than that of any generation before it since the days of the holy Apostles.
Which degree of King. 7. did, who saw with the eyes of his body fine flour and
barley sold in the gate of Samaria at easy prices; but, through unbelief, did
not eat thereof. So thou possibly may foresee darkly with the eyes of thy
mind, what excellent things very many of the members of the Church shall be
partakers of hereafter, and thy self not partake of them. Thou may be like
the heath in the desert, which sees not, when good comes, to which the man who
trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, is compared by Jeremy, Chap. 17. 5,
6. who in the next verses compares the man that trusts in the LORD, and whose
hope the LORD is, (as I may a thoroughly reformed Christian) to a tree which is
planted by the waters, Psalm. 1. 3. and spreads out her roots by the River,
which shall ^^ see, when heat comes, nor be careful in a year of drought, nor
cease from yielding fruit. 5. What think ye of Gods waiting, that he may be
gracious to us? Isa. 30. 18. What is it for him, to wait for that end? It is,
as it were, to stand somewhat near us, having in and at his right hand good
things, which may be used unto the promoting of Christ's cause and interest, and
the welfare of his people or some of them, and therewithal our own good, Psalm.
16. 11. Rev. 3. 20 and 22. 12. which things also he really purposes to bestow
actually upon those of us, who shall prove meet to receive them. For then will
be a due and fit time for him, to bestow them upon us, Jam. 4. 10. 1 Pet. 1. 6.
Which convenient season, (we may well believe) is then come, when we are; 1.
Duly humbled under the mighty hand of God for our own sins, and grieved for the
sins of others; 2. And so humbled under the mighty and correcting hand of God,
as to confess to God, our walking contrary to him, and his walking contrary to
us. 3. And so as to accept of the punishment of our iniquities (with the whole
heart) Lev. 26. 40, 41, 42. Mic. 7. 8, 9, 10. Lam. 3. 42. bearing it patiently,
without murmuring and repining or hard thoughts of God. 4. And when we have
learned of him, how to be full, and to abound, and how to be abased, and to
suffer need, how to behave our selves in prosperity and adversity, Phil. 4. 12.
5. And to pray fervently for our selves, with due respect to the glory of God,
and the good of his people; that is aiming at those ends, Jam. 4. 2, 3. 6. And
when we are become thoroughly willing and strongly resolved (with Gods
assistance) to leave all our sins, and to do all our duties. Yea, Friends, the
most high God will be highly pleased to see us well-minded toward him and his
people, and when we are so, he will even delight to bestow the good things
(according to his said purpose) upon us. Apollos had watered Corinth, 1 Cor. 3.
6. and doubtless was kindly affectioned toward them with brotherly love, and
did desire and seek their welfare; yet there was a time, when his will was not
at all to come unto them, no not although the Apostle Paul did greatly desire
him. And why? even, because at that time it was not convenient: Namely because
many of them were so affected toward him, 1 Cor. 1. 12. that he could not hope
to be kindly received and entertained of them, and to have them make a right
use of his presence and company for their souls good: so that at that time it
would not have been convenient for him or them, or in respect of Jesus Christ.
For when he shall have a convenient time, then he will come unto them, 1 Cor.
16. 12. namely when God by Paul's ministry or otherwise, has brought their
spirits into a fit temper, to make such use as they ought of his ministry and
labors. And so God does not deliver, exalt, and give Professors such and such
good things, because they be not prepared and ready to make such use of them as
they ought unto their own benefit and the benefit of others, and the credit of
the Gospel.

For an instance, he will not exalt a Professor who keeps his stock of pride,
because, he would thence take occasion to grow in pride, rather than to walk
more humbly, than he did in his low Estate. But to be brought into it. Is this
true? And are ye not yet prepared and fit to receive the alms which God has in
his hands to bestow upon you? Ye are but sorry Scholars. How long do ye think
it fit, that the most high God (on whom ye ought to wait continually, until he
has mercy upon you, (Psalm. 123. 2.) how long do ye think it fit, that he
should wait for you? And, how long do ye think he will wait for you? Do ye
think, it is fit, that he should wait your leisure? Whatsoever any of you
think; for certain, the longer God waits, the greater is your iniquity in not
striving earnestly to leave off your sins. And why is the LORD in the very same
verse, wherein he is said to wait, viz. Es. 30. 18. Why is he in the very same
verse said to be a God of judgment? Is it not, because he knows how long it is
fit for him to wait, and how long he has waited, and when it is good for us,
that he should cease from correcting us? I indeed and my fellow-Ministers of
Christ are not inspired as the Prophets of old were, neither can I mourn and
weep as many can, but if the riches of Gods goodness and forbearance and great
patience and long-continued waiting, and his, as it were, stooping to us, and
working strangely for us, when and whilst we were so far short of a full and
perfect Reformation, and his correctings of us, and his mitigating and
lessening of our chastisements, dangers and fears; if all this does not partly
draw us, and partly drive us out of our sins, and win us to amend our doings
speedily, I shall be so far from expecting very great matters, that I shall
fear, we do treasure up wrath against a day of greater and sorer be not
careless but fear, lest thou also be broken of, Romans 11. 17. etc. For we who
are Christ's Ministers, cannot say, yet your space to repent of and from your
sins, shall be 120 years; as Genesis 6. 3. nor, if they continue barren one whole
year longer, then thou shall cut them down, as Luke 13. 9. no nor yet forty
days, and then ye shall be overthrown, as Jon, 3. 4. No, our words, are, To
day if ye will hear Gods voice, harden not your hearts, etc. Psalm. 95. 7. etc.
For we know not what a day will bring forth, Prove. 27. 1. Jam. 4. 13, 14. I
shall notwithstanding show you as near as I can, when the end of our sufferings
will be. I believe our most gracious and wise God will put an end to them.

1. When that which lets our prayers and deliverance is taken These. 2. 7.)
Which I believe to be our sins. See Marg. 30. etc.

2. When we are taken in the snares which God has laid for us. Will a man take
up a snare from the earth, when he has taken nothing at all? Amos 3. 5. Now he
who is one of Christ's people is taken in his snare of affliction, when he is
(by it and Gods word) brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, 2 Cor.
10. 5. and made willing to receive and follow all his counsel.

3. God will do it for us in due time: which is, when he has attained all the
ends whereat he shoots in afflicting us. See Marg. 20. etc.

4. When we hear the rod and [him] who has appointed it, M^cah 6. 9. that is,
have taken notice of the message of the Rod, and are fully resolved to do what
God requires of us by it.

5. When we are fittingly exercised by and under our Cr^sses, and do make such
use of them as we ought, so that they do yield the peaceable fruits of
righteousness to us, Heb. 12. 11. to Christ, and to his Church.

6. When God does with our chastenings teach us out of his Law, Psalm. 94. 12.
and 119. 59. that which by the voice of his chastenings he calls us to learn
out of it so as to do it. See Marg. 27. etc. (The cause ceasing, the effect
will cease.)

7. When it agrees with Gods faithfulness and justice, to forgive us our sins:
which is, when we confess and forsake our sins, etc. Prove. 28. 13. Es. 1. 16,
17, 18, 19. Es. 59. 20. Hag. 2. 18. And for examples, Noah being a just and
perfect man, found grace in the eyes of the LORD for himself and his Family,
when very many millions of of men were drowned, Genesis chap. 6. chap. 7. chap. 8.
Jacob and his Family, having great cause to fear the wrath of their Neighbors,
and of God also, God commanded them to go up to Bethel and to dwell there:
whereupon Jacob cleansed his house of Idols, and then journeyed, and the terror
of God was upon the Cities that were round about them, so that they did not
pursue after them, Genesis 35. 1, 5. When the LORD had (with much ado) won Moses
to undertake (as many would have accounted it) a very dangerous service, then
he comforted him with this, that all the men were dead, who sought his life,
Exodus 4. 19. And when the Israelites at Gods call went out of Egypt, under the
conduct of Moses and Aaron, not a dog did move his tongue against any of them,
nor against any of their beasts, Exodus 11. 7. And what did God promise Israel
in Exodus 34. 24. even, that not any man should desire their land, when they
should go up to appear before the LORD their God thrice in the year. But
Solomon speaks indefinitely, saying, When a man's ways please the LORD, he
makes even his enemies (...) with him, Prove. 16. 7.

8. God will put a period to our troubles, when we are so humbled Jam. 4. 10. 1
Pe^. 5. 6, 7, 10. A man is never fully humbled under the Kingdom and Power of
the Almighty, till he be so minded.

9. When we are thoroughly well prepared and meet to receive of an exceeding
rich man will not keep in his own hand a piece of silver, which he purposes to
bestow on a very poor man, a long time after he he sees, he is come nigh him,
and in a fit posture to receive it, etc. viz. standing before him quietly, with
a sober countenance, with his hat in his hand, etc. But if a poor man, whom a
rich man calls to him, should come proudly, dancing, laughing and grinning, and
stand before him, one while on his right leg, another while on his left leg,
one while turning his face toward him, another while his back, playing with
his Buttons, and talking proudly, saucily, and malepertly to him; it may be
this kind of behavior would cost the poor man the learning of better manners
before he should receive any Alms, (excepting sharp and chiding words) of him.
Neither do I see wherefore we should expect to have the most high God deal more
indulgently with us, but for our good to reject our prayers, till we have
learned how to come unto him and how to behave our selves before him, and that
as touching both the outward and inward man: for he knows all the secrets of
the heart.

10. God will ease us of our afflictions, when (according to his Peter's
Language is) no need of them, 1 Pet. 1. 6. Now medicinals of the body, when
they have wrought that work in or on the body, for which the Physician or
Surgeon uses then; then they cease to be needful, Mat. 9. 12. And even so
chastisements and corrections, when God has attained all his ends, Cor. 1. 3.
to 12. and (if ye study seriously) in many other Scriptures.

11. God will relieve and help us, when the Holy Ghost has burnt up, or washed
away, or blown away, the corruptions and ungodly lusts which are in our hearts,
Mat. 3. 11. John 3. 5, 6, 7, 8. When God has purged away our sins and
iniquities, and driven us out of our evil ways by our chastisements and
afflictions, Es. 27. 9. Zech. 13. 9. We must be rid of the naughty things which
are in our hearts and ways.

12. When we are become thoroughly meet for the Masters use, and Tim. 2. 20, 21,
22.

13. When we have learned to seek God duly and diligently, and, in the Faith of
being raised up, to turn from our sins, and to exhort and encourage one another
to turn unto the LORD Hos. 5. 14, 15. with 6. 1, 2, 3. Come now and let us
reason together, as it were, face to face: (I shall speak to a few, to many, to
all of you.)

Why is there so little speech amongst us of reforming Professors? Why do we
who are Professors, so seldom reprove Professors? I assure you, it is not
through want of just occasions of reproving. God etc. Es. 1. and 58. Joel 2.
Act. 3. etc. And ought ye not to hear and obey him unreservedly? I think, ye
ought, and that, because he is your Creator, King, and most bountiful
Benefactor, etc. yea, I may well say like Nehemiah, chap. 5. 9. ought ye not to
walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of irreligious persons?
Also he is able (if it please him) to restrain the Covetousness, and Ambition,
and all other ungodly lusts of all the men in the world, so as to bridle them
all from desiring thy House, Land, Goods, etc. or any part of them, etc. as he
did overruled the enemies of Israel, Exodus 34. 23, 24. Why do we not then amend
all our ways according to his word, and trust in him before the sons of men,
to make good his promises to us? Psalm. 31. 19. Prove. 16. 17. Many of you do
believe that the happiest time that ever the Church of Christ shall have on
earth, is not very far of, and that the fall of Babylon is nearer than that,
and some of you, that your own (outward) prosperity was nearer, than the fall
of Babylon. But can ye really and indeed believe, that these great things will
come to pass, whilst the sins of Professors do hinder their pr^yers? I hope,
the most knowing and wisest of you, do not believe it, or else will not long
believe it. And which of you, when the new Jerusalem is come down from God out
of Heaven, would be content (if all godly persons shall not then speed alike)
to have the gates of it kept shut against him by the holy Angels? Rev. 21. 2,
12. Remember the Children of Israel, how God etc. Deuteronomy. 8. 2, 3, 4, 5. and
that, when they would not be led unto Repentance by his goodness, nor driven
out of their sins by his corrections, then he swear in his wrath, that they
should not enter into his rest, Psalm. 95. 8, 9, 10, 11. Yea, Aaron, and also
Moses who brought the children of Israel near it, yet because they did not
believe the LORD, to sanctify him in the eyes of the Israelites; therefore
they themselves could enter into it, Number. 20. Moses leave to see the Land of
Isreal's rest, Deuteronomy. 32. 48. etc. and 34. 1. etc. But, what is this, may some
Professors say, to us? I Will tell you, God not so long since did try and prove
us somewhat like as he did the children of Israel, viz. with great troubles,
dangers, and fears, and by working migtily for u^; and we, too too many of us
did deal with him too like the children of Israel, even try and tempt him with
our sins; to wit, Self-love, and selfseeking, Pride, and Ambition, unjust
seeking for friends, and those of our own way, putting down, and setting up
unjustly, oppression even of our own party, (Wives and Children wronged)
depriving others in part, some wholly of their places and means, delaying
payments, putting to charges, and suffering and sparing some unjustly and too
much, even Preachers seeking great means, wearing long hair, hand-Ribbons, too
much against those who were not of our judgment, etc. yea, and many of us are
not yet duly humbled, Pride, Ambition, and contempt of others, affecting of
elegant and trim Preaching, and praying, vain fashions of Apparel and
Ornaments, excess in rubbing slicking and adorning floors and houses,
unfaithfulness in not reproving plainly, particularly and home, not pitying and
helping the poor and needy, unfit communication, idle, vain, and frothy
speeches, too much mirth and jollity, etc. To whom if they amend not, God may
justly swear, that they shall not enter into the new Jerusalem, nor partake of
the great rest and transcendent prosperity the happy time before mentioned,
although many of them do expect it. I beseech you therefore, every one of you
mor^ifie all your earthly members, Self-love, men-pleasing, inordinate
affection, evil concupiscence, covetousness, etc. Put away anger, wrath,
malice, and corrupt communication, and lying out of your mouth, etc. And put on
(as the Elect of God) bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind,
meekness, long-suffering, (forbearing, and forgiving one another) and charity,
which is the bond of perfectness, etc. ( Col. 3. 5. to the 16, etc.) And see to
every part of the wedding garment, that there be no spot, ^or wrinkle, nor any
unseemly stuff upon it, Romans 13. 12, 13, 14. Gal. 4. 19. Ephesians. 5. 27. Put on
also the whole Armor of God, Ephesians. 6. 11. etc. and see that no part of it be
broken, cracked, weak, or rusty for want of use, etc. And be ashamed of doing
little for Christ and his Saints, whilst ye expect very great things through
and from Christ. But some of you (peradventure) fairer shows of grace than many
Professors make, thou can not say, thou have a new Nature, Ezekiel. 36. 26, 27.
or that thy fleshly lusts be crucified, Gal. 5. 24. or that thou do love, or
fear, or trust in God at all. Verily, Brethren, it is one thing to be a
Presbyterian, or Independent, or Anabaptist, and to come to Familyduty, and
mixed Meetings, and another thing to go to Heaven, or to be right in the way to
Heaven; and I would not have men build their expectation of everlasting life on
such a Foundation as a Fox can break down, but on a firm and sure foundation,
which is Jesus Christ apprehended by such a faith as works by love toward God,
works conducing to the promoting of Christ's interest, and by love toward men
conducing to the good of men, especially of Gods family on earth, 1 John 5. 12.
Gal. 5. 6. Gal. 6. 10. Endeavor therefore, I beseech you, and that with great
diligence, to reach unto an exact and full Reformation of your ways, and to get
abundance of holiness, and to make it appear, ye shine in your conversation. If
ye think, ye be new creatures, and that the flesh and its affections in your
inner man be mercifyed, then show pregnant and manifest tokens of it in your
behavior daily, and in conversing with all sorts of people. Phil. 4. 5. 1 Pet.
2. 12. after the example of Manasseh, 2 Chronicles. 33. 15, 16. and those Acts 13.
34. and 19. 18, 19, 20. and 27. 35, 36. If ye have slain any of the King of
Saints enemies, let it appear by their fore-skins, as David did, that he had
slain two hundred Philistims, 1 Samuel 18. 27. Make it known, I mean, by your
words, and deeds, and gestures, that your corruptions be mortifyed. And be not
ashamed, to let Tim. 4. 15.) but ashamed to continue one day longer in your
sins. For this base and abominable shamefastness (what should I call it?) has
helped and does help the devil, to keep from bettering their behavior,
(doubtless) many a man, and many a woman, and some children (whose Parents have
wanted true christian love to correct them betimes, (Prove. 22. 6. and 13. 24.)
of whom I was so kept about three days from amending one of my faults.

Shall I reason with you a little, and ask you a few questions, hoping,
consciences will do their Office, whilst I am doing (...) Do not many of you
expect, to be greatly exalted in this world? And whosoever has this hope in
his heart, does it not call upon him, to reform his ways, and the ways of all
that are under his authority or power? Which, if any of you be so dull of
understanding, as not to believe; yet ye know, that God commands and calls on
us to reform our ways, and that to this Reformation he has annexed a promise
of mercy, Prove. 28. 13. Ezekiel. 18. 21, 22, 23, 27, Joel 2. 12, 13, 14. Jer. 18.
7, 8. Can any of you show me, where the Lord says, He will forgive sinners,
and do them good, although they do not forsake their sins? O^ do any of you
hope, that he will extend his mercy and forgiveness unto you, although ye be
not conten^ to leave yours? If any of you have such a hope, of what kind is it,
but a groundless, bastard, rash, rotten hope? No, no, Friend, throw away all
thy sins, and do all thy duties; leave not a hoof behind i^ Egypt (Exodus 10.
26.) nor so much as one dainty dish on thy Table, or i^ thy ^uttery for the
devil and graceless men to feed on, (Psalm. 141. 4. Pr^v. 4. 17.) Pray, to what
end do ye keep any of your sins? What mean ye to do with them? What good work
do ye hope to make of or with them? What good fruits or benefits have they
yielded to you, Romans 6. 23. Can ye still persuade your minds to be of your
opinion, that it is a wise p^rt, to keep some of them, and not to let them all
go, as if a man should keep some money in his purse to keep it warm?) Do ye
think, ye shall gain any thing by them, which is really good for you, and that
the loss of them would be a real loss to you? Have ye so much wit, and so
little wisdom, as to think so? Indeed, Friends, the leaving of them will be no
real loss to you, and the keeping of them no real gain. I think, it agrees not
with God's justice and wisdom, to suffer men to g^in by keeping such base,
filthy, stinking stuff. But suppose he should, will the benefit of keeping them
be better than that which thou may get by forsaking them? If not, thou
make but a sorry bargain. And upon what ground will thou expect deliverance,
etc? Truly, I judge it a superlative act of grace and favor, and of exceeding
great mercy in God, to pardon us, when we do duly and thoroughly humble our
selves for our sins and forsake them: but to desire and expect, to have God
pardon us all that is past, and, as it were, to license us to go on still in
our sins; this I may well account a most horrible and absurd thing, even an
abomination of Desolation and Destruction.

1. Take thou heed then, of sending a Message after Christ, by thy I will not
have Christ to reign over me, Luke 19. 14. For the doom of such is, Those mine
enemies, who would not, that I should reign ever them, bring hither, and stay
them before me, v. (...).

2. Yea, Take heed, lest thy sins should, as it were, steal to heaven, whilst
thou art asleep in the cradle of security; lest they come up, for a memorial
(of thy naughtiness,) before God, as the prayers and alms of Cornelius did come
up before God, for a memorial [of his goodness] Act. 10. 4, 31.

3. Take heed, lest the good desires, and purposes, and motions, in carna^
delights and pleasures, Amos 5. 1, 4, 5, 6. or choke with the cares of this
life, and the decei^^ulness of riches, Mat. 13. 7, 22, Luke 21. 34. or quench
with the stinking water of thy daily sins, or by neglecting them, (not
nourishing and maintaining them by adding fuel to them, and by blowing them, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 19.) take heed, I say, lest such motions as these, of whose
destruction thou have m^de, or shall make thy self guilty, lest they call unto
God against thee, as the blood of murdered Abel did against his brother Cain,
Genesis 4. 10.

4. Take heed, thou be not like those children of Belial, who despised the
earthly King, whom the Lord had set over them, and brought him no presents, 1 Samuel 10. 27. For, if ye bring the King of Saints very f^w or no presents, or
only such wherein he delights not, I cannot promise you, that he will hold
his peace, as King Saul did, Psalm. 2. 11, 12. Isa. 1. 11, 14, 15.

5. Take heed, it be not written in a Book, that it may be for ever and ever,
that ye be children of Rebellion, lying children, children that will not hear
the Law of the Lord; who say to the Prophets, prophecy not unto us right
things, speak unto us smooth things, prophecy deceits, etc. Isa. 30. 8, 9, 10,
11, etc.

6. Take heed of saying, This or that is a hard saying, who can hear it? Joh.
6. 60. that is, endure to hear it?

7. Take heed of looking too much to the hearts, tongues and hands of men, and
too little to the Lord. For, 2 Chronicles. 12. 2, 3. it is not said, that Shishak
King of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem, because he was angry with them, but
because they had transgressed against the LORD. Let us therefore imitate the
true Church* Mic. 7. 7, 8, 9, 10.

8. Take heed of TEKEL which was one of the words that were Belshazzar's
Palace, and signifies, Thou art weighed in the balan^es, and art found wanting,
too light, Dan. 5. 27.

9. Take heed, lest thy incorrigibleness help to make this time such to
England, or the Professors of England, as that, 2 Chronicles. 36. 16. etc. ^ the
messengers of God* and despised his words, and misused his Prophets, until the
wrath of the LORD arose against his people till there was no remedy, etc. O
what a word was that, Till there was no remedy!

10. If thou think, that thou have performed the commandment of the LORD in
destroying the Amalakites, and all that they had, 1 Samuel 15. 3, 13. Take heed
of, What means then this bleating of the sheep, and lowing of the Oxen, which
I hear? v. 14. For shall not he who planted the ear, hear? he who formed the
eye, see? he who teaches man knowledge, know? Psalm. 94. 9, 10. Thy sins cannot
make some of the godly Ministers will (according to their duty, (Jer. 8. 6.)
hearken, and hear the lowing and bleating of thy sins; not only of the best and
chiefest of them, (1 Samuel 15. 9, 15, 21.) the chiefest in thy estimation,
because by them (as Demetrius said to the Craftsmen, Act. 19. 25.) thou have
much of thy wealth, (gettest and keep much of it) as by thy covetousness (if
thou will not have me think, thou art covetous, then let thy conversation be
without covetousness, Heb. 13. 5.) covetous seeking and keeping worldly weal^h,
fraud, overreaching, etc. (whosoever sees his Christian brother has need, and
shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, such a man does not love God,
Luke 3. 11. 1 John 3. 17.) I say, not only of thy fat sins, which thou keep
for filthy lucres sake (Tit. 1. 11.) but also of thy lean, poor, carrion-sins,
which do yield, if any fruit at all, very little, and such as is not worth
talking of; as prating and foolish talking, vain and idle words, unseemly
jesting, and the servants of Christ, (Gal. 1. 10.) to wi^, faithful, (Prove. ^0.
6. 2 Timothy 2. 2.) in reproving thee for them, and, it may be shame thee, if they
can, quite out of them; that thou may not perish under the wrath of God.
Indeed such Ministers are your best Friends, and do best deserve to have power
over your purses.

11. Take heed of being like Hophni and Phineas, who hearkened not to the voice
of their Father, because the LORD would destroy them, 1 Samuel 2. 25. For why
will ye die, or be destroyed, O ye Professors of England? Ezekiel. 18. 31. Can any
of you show any sufficient reason, why they should desire to die? If any man
can, yet it would be a wise part for them, to make an even reckoning with God
before they die; and God may possibly take them out of this world within one or
two days after they have read this, or heard it read.

12. Take heed of that sharp commandment concerning the Fig Tree fruitless
three years; cut it down, why cumbereth it the ^ more, and then if it bear not
fruit, thou shall cut it down, v. 8, 9. And, it may be, God has heard the
prayers of some eminent Christians, and spared thee, to the end of the sixth or
seventh year, or more. Art thou sure, he will spare thee six or seven months
more, or seven days more?

13. Take heed of being assasinated or massacred, after the manner of Paris and
I. etc. For I assure you, the care and pains which some Professors take of and
with their Families, to educate them according to their duty, and the rest of
their behavior, do not give me cause, to be confident, that they will not be
killed with some such kind of death, and their chil^ren trained up in Egypt and
Babylon. Friends, do ye use to pray, and to pray for your selves, whom ye
think, ye love? What David tells you, If he had regarded iniquity in his heart,
the LORD would not have heard him, Psalm. 66. 18. And what is any of you, that
the Lord should hear him, if he does regard iniquity in his heart, rather than
David? But what is it ^or a man to regard iniquity in his heart? It is, to
regard some of his sins, or the fruit of them, so as to keep those sins (as we
use to speak) at all adventures, whether God will hear his prayers (...) not:
which I fear, many of you do,

Friends, will ye now consider, what I have said unto you? For it another to
consider.] I pray d^, and be persuaded by one who desires to do you good.

1. To look on your sins as the greatest, sorest and most dangerous enemies
that ye have, and on every sin, as one of your enemies. 2. To go beyond Micah's
liberal Briber, Mic. 6. and Paul's Formalist, 2 Timothy 3. 3. To leave your sins,
all of them, and all of them at once. ('It Is easier, to endure the chopping off,
of five fingers at once, than of five, one after another.) 4. Especially, and
in any wise, to abandon those sins which ye are well able to abandon, as unfit
language, etc.

2. Mr. S. Clark in his Epistle to the Reader before his Martyrology, (...). 2.
has these very words: One thing is very remarkable in this History; that
usually before any great persecution befell the Church, the holy m^n of those
times observed, that there was some great decay of zeal, and of the power of
godliness, or some mutual contentions and quarrels amongst the people of God,
or some such sin or other, that provoked God against them; and then God lets
loose, etc. and the History, in page 56, 61, 100, 160, 166, and 209.
mentions, as forerunners of several persecutions, those sins and enormities
following, and in those Pagins (I think) only these; The power of godliness
much decayed, few zealously bent to Religion, unprofitable Gospellers,
Hypocrisy and Dissimulation, void of simplicity and faithful dealing, not
walking in the way of the Lord, nor observing his precepts, as we ought,
keeping no Discipline, pride, delicates, emulation, dissension, contending upon
every occasion, every man pleasing himself, and displeasing others, with
railing words in a despiteful manner, moving hatred and sedition one against
another, full of lucre, renouncing the world in word, but not indeed, but all,
both small and great, thinking deeply upon worldly matters, and building them
goodly Castles in the air, by little and little men began to be so licentious
in their lives, and carnal security so increased, that, etc.

Also I have been credibly informed, that one of the forerunners of the
enslaving of Rochel 1628. was the mispending and profaning of the afternoon of
the Lord's day, and the slighting or worse of the best Ministers; and that one
of the forerunners of the late long War in Germany 1620. etc. was very gross
profaneness, etc. The same Mr. Clark p. 3. of the said Epistle says; That when
God exposes us to P. he expects our speedy and through Reformation, if we
desire the affliction to be removed, etc.

3. I believe, were it not for our sins, it would not be withus, as it causa
sine qua non of our, etc.

4. If you desire worse days, and greater troubles, I need not teach you, what
to do: The way to attain your desire, is but to hold fast your dear Friends,
your sins. For then ye may with good reason expect times of greater troubles
and dangers. But, methinks, understanding and wise persons cannot see any
sufficient cause, to desire such times.

5. The issue is this; either attend to the instructions of faithful Ministers,
and reform, and take heed to thy ways according to the word of God, Psalm. 119.
9. or else look not for deliverance, etc. but additional afflictions and
punishments, according to the threatenings, Lev. 26. 14. to the 39. and get a
very strong faith, and much humility, (that thou may possess thy soul under
the Plows and Harrows in patience:) which one who is not thoroughly reformed,
will hardly attain.

Let me here answer some Arguments, which may occasion some a more complete
Reformation (than that which is wrought already) as needless. For peradventure
it will be objected and said:

1. That upon Abab's external humiliation, God did not bring the evil upon his
house in his days, but in the days of his son, 1 King. 21. 29.

A. Art thou content to have thy whole portion of good things (as wicked men
have theirs, Psalm. 17. 14.) in this life, and to go, whither Ahab went at the
time of his death, and to have the heads of 70 of thy sons within a few years
after, put into baskets? 2 King. 10. I think thou art not.

2. That God hearkened to King Hezekiah's prayer, and healed the people, who
were not cleansed according to the purification of the Sanctuary, 2 Chronicles. 30.
18, 19, 20.

A. Is this any thing to thee? He prayed only for those who prepered their
hearts to seek God, the Lord God of their Fathers, v. 18, 19. so that they did
prepare their hearts, and the only thing which they wanted, was a ceremonial
cleansing, which also they wanted not, because they were not willing to perform
it, but because they wanted time to perform it; and he whose heart is prepared,
will not neglect the preparing of his ways. And, as for thee, if thy heart be
duly prepared to seek the Lord, thou may really resolve to amend thy
carriage, as far forth as it is faulty, as it were, in a moment: yea know, that
thy heart is not duly prepared, unless thou be willing and careful to find out
thy sins, and to reform all the parts of thy conversation.

3. That God, seeing what the Ninevites did, turned from his fierce

A. It was much, which they did; more than some Professors do: they believed
God, observed a Fast very solemnly, cried mightily unto God, and turned from
their evil ways, Chap. 3. 5. etc. ( Go and do thou likewise, Luke 10. 37.) And
yet God did but suspend the execution of his sentence against them; for their
City was destroyed; I think, some say, about 40 years after: and many of you
would be loath to have your own houses destroyed forty years hence.

4. That doubtless exceeding many of the Israelites were great sinners, Egypt;
yet God wrought for them miraculously, etc.

A. Therein they were (I think so) a Type of Christ's peoples deliverance out
of the bondage of Satan, as it is of free grace: 1 Timothy 1. 15, 16. and yet
withal they suffered as many of us would be loath to suffer: the carcases of all
their Males of 20 years old (excepting Joshua and Caleb) must fall in the
wilderness, and none of those enter into the Land of promise; and when they and
the rest be come near to it, they must all turn back toward the Sea of Edom
(called the red Sea) adjoining to Egypt; and so the younger sort have wandered
forty years in the wilderness, etc. Number. 14. 21. to 35.

5. That God would have spared Sodom, if there had been but ten Genesis 18. 32.

A. But he has not bound himself by a Law, to deal with all other places
according to that rate.

6. That Professors do pray.

A. They may ask; and not have 1. John. 5. 14, 15. Jam. 4. 3. If thou do
regard iniquity in thy heart, the Lord will not hear thee, Psalm. 66. 18. O but
our forms of godliness are long and beautiful.

A. Forms never brought any man to Heaven, nor never will, without the power of
Godliness: and this is part of those perilous times wherein there would be
great plenty of such empty and sorry Christians, 2 Timothy 3. 1, 5. even a brave
and Court like form, is but a brave Bribe; and Gods mouth will not be stopped,
nor his hand staid with Bribes: See Marg. 94. 95, 96. etc. 101. 102, 103.

Ob. But we have prevailed for peace already.

A. Friends, ye have heard of a Lightening before Death, and, Learned men do
account the long-continued stillness of the Air, a forerunner and sign of an
Earthquake following it. Let my counsel be acceptable to you: be thankful for
what ye have, and amend whatsoever is amiss; that it may be the lengthening of
your tranquillity. For God has sometimes deferred the punishment of those who
have sinned against him, for a time in such a manner, that in the holy
Scriptures it is called a pardon, and yet for all that, in due time has
punished them; as the Israelites, Number. 14. 20, 21, 22, 23. Psalm. 99. 8. Exodus
32. 34 35.

7. But some peradventure think, God will spare them, that they may teach their
children Religion, etc.

A. Verily some Professors do bestow little care or pains on this business.

8. But we have many Professors to stand in the gap, to keep out Ezekiel. 22. 30,
31.

A. But sometimes God is weary of repenting, as he was, J^r. 15. 6. There is a
time, when the wrath of the Lord does arise against his people, until there is
no remedy, 2 Chronicles. 36. 16, 17. etc. When if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in the
Land, they should deliver but their own souls by their own righteousness; no
not so much as their own Sons or Daughters, Ezekiel. 14. 14. to 20. yea, God did
forbid Jeremy to pray for the Jews, chap. 7. 16. and 11. 14. and 14. 11. and I
remember Dr. Usher, the Bishop of Armagh, told Mr. Froysell and me in Oxford,
when the Scots were in New Castle, that his heart was bound up (as he called
it) when he went to pray for England. (Take heed therefore to your spirits in
your prayers.) Although some of them who seemed to be somewhat, have done
enough of late to strike them out of the gap (as David once did, 2 Samuel 24. 1.)
yet, I hope, we have still some Intercessors, which are of great power with
God, and do pray unto him withal their might: but how long they will be able
to hold his hands from striking us, who knows? For, I know not; but this I
know, that it would be wisdom in us, to increase the number of our
Intercessors, lest there should be too few of them, as there were too few
righteous persons in Sodom to keep it from destruction.

9. But God did help Professors, when Professors were as poorly reformed,

A. That I know not; but this I know; that if Professors now be not more
reformed, than they were in 1640. and 1641. then our iniquity is greatened by
Gods waiting, and by the cords of love, and whips of correction, and by the
good preaching, which he has bestowed upon us; and so greater than the
iniquity of Professors in those years was. And would thou have the great
God, who formed the spirit of man within him, and before whom all Nations are
as nothing; would thou have him stoop again to thee, who art but dust and
ashes, and, it may be, a great sinner? Beware of stinking pride, and of
stubbornness; which is, as Idolatry, 1 Samuel 15. 23.

10. But Isa. 59. 16. When there was no Intercessor, then.

A. What then? Take heed of misconstruing and abusing this and other Scriptures
to thy own hurt, and the hurt of the Church of God: The words are meant not of
men, who should intercede with God for his pleople, but of men who should stand
up and bestir themselves to bring things to a better order: men of which sort
we now want, ver. 4. And if they were to be understood otherwise, yet it would
be a very base part in us not to reform our doings, and a foolish part, without
that, to trust to God for the bettering of our Estate, when we have no promise
of it.

Obj. But God has said, he will never leave us, nor forsake us, Heb. all
things do work together for good to them who love God, Romans 8. 28.

A. See, that thou be such a one indeed. But if God has given thee a new
spirit, yet thou may suffer much; it may be more than thou art willing to
suffer, before thy afflictions prove beneficial to thee: and God says, that if
he shall speak concerning a Nation to build and ^^ ^lant it, that, if it shall
do evil in his sight and not obey his voice; that then he will repent of the
good, wherewith he said he would benefit them, Jer. 18. 7, 8, 9, 10.

11. But some peradventure will tell me of the Resurrection of the two
witnesses, Rev. 11. 11. of the fall of Babylon, Rev. 14. 8. of the fifth
Monarchy, Dan. 2. 34, 35 etc. of Alsteds Northern Empire or Monarchy, which God
(he says) will set up in the North by the Northern Lion, 2 Esd. 11. 37. etc.
and 21. 1. to 32. etc. of the new Jerusalem, of Alsteds melius seculum, the
1000 years, etc. and O how happy shall the Saints be in those days!

A. The Greek word Rev. 11. 7. signifies to finish, fill up, consummate,
perfect: and I dare not peremptorily affirm, that our Ministers have finished
and persected their testimony, till they have witnessed against Professors,
especially those of their own way, in another gates manner than many of us yet
have done.

2. According to Alsted, the three years and a half will end, and the 1000
years begin in 1694.

3. Beside whom, Learned Mayer is one who does not interpret the three Greek
Letters wherewith the 14 chap. of the Revelation is ended, 666. as the year of
the fall of Babylon, but to signify, who the Antichrist is.

4. Howsoever, I would have thee to fear, (as our last Translators Sam. 5. 8.)
that the blind and the lame shall not come into the house, and to be prepared
as the holy City, as a Bride adorned for her Hu^band, Rev. 21. 2. and not to
content thy self with Horace's one or two fair and far-shining patches of
purple, nor to continue blind or lame enough to be kept out of the new
Jerusalem by the Angel-Porters (which, it may be, would be grievous to thy
spirit.)

5. I would also have thee consider, that if there shall be any general
Christians before the descending of the New Jerusalem, yet thou may come
short of it, and that if thou shall be equal to others in worldly things, yet
God is able to send thee such sauce with them, as may make them bitter enough
to thee, till thou have cast away thy Pride, and the rest of thy sins, as a
menstrous-cloth, and said unto them get ye hence, Es. 30. 22, 23. etc. Gods
dealings withus, are (to me) as if I heard him say, how muchsoever I have
hitherto spared you, I will no longer content my self with halving and half
turns, with an overby, slight or partial Reformation: I will have you neither
go backward, nor stand at a stay, but go forward, and reform universally. Sin
no more therefore, lest worse things come unto you, John 5. 14. Ob. One or two
peradventure, will be so humble and open-hearted, as to

A. Like enough, if thou be a new creature. For a poor man does ever and anon,
almost daily, find somewhat wanting in his house: and so does he who is poor in
spirit, in his soul, Mat. 5. 3. Howsoever reform the outside, the Apparel and
(called) ornaments of thy body, and thy outward conversation, and do whatsoever
thou can to thy inward man, and contribute what thou art able to the
Reformation of others, especially of thy own Family, (1 Timothy 5. 8.) and pray
unto him who made thy heart, to reform thy heart, and to prosper thy godly
enterprises, etc. But Friends, many of us have much pride; they are (too) high
minded, and too jolly, jocund, and jovial, to be of great power with God, and
to be exalted. I beseech and exhort you therefore by the Lord Jesus, cast away
your pride, and carnal jovialty and me^riments, brought very low by compulsion.

1. Now it is your duty, to humble your selves and to be humble, even clothed
with humility, and to walk humbly with God and men, Mic. 6. 8. Jam. 4. 10. Ephesians.
4. 2. Col. 3. 12. 1 Pet. 5. 5, 6. Phil. 2. 3.

2. Humility is taught us also by the practice and examples of Abraham, the

he gives grace to the lowly, Pr. 3. 24. Before destruction the heart is
haughty, and before Honor is Humility, Prove. 18. 12. Whosoever shall exalt
himself, shall be abased; and he who shall humble himself, shall be exalted,
Mat. 23. 12. God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble, Jam. 4.
6. Friend, some of the Christians of Corinth were proud of their spiritual
gi^ts, and of their Ministers, 1 Cor. 5. 2. and Paul foretold, that in the
pe^^llous times of the last days, there would be Formalists, which would be
proud, high-minded, boasters, etc. 2 Timothy 3. 1. etc. and, if thou be one of
them, how can thou hope, that God will hear thy prayers (yea, long and fine
prayers;) when thou ask that which would increase or occasion an increase of
that evil thing in thy soul, whereof thou have too too much already; I mean,
ask worldly prosperity, which occasions pride, Psalm. 73. 5, 6. Deuteronomy. 8. 11,
12, 13, 14. and 32. 15 2 Chronicles. 26. 16. Nab. 9. 28. Hos. 13. 6. Thou should
rather think, thou want more affliction, to beat down thy pride, and think,
if God does not hate but love thee, that he will in faithfulness add to thy
afflictions, as he did upon that score afflict the Psalmist, Psalm. 119. 75.
utter undoing, etc. This also, I would have you all take good notice of; that
there are six things which are kinds, parts or companions of Humility, without
which, or any of them, your Humility is not altogether such as it ought to be,
viz. 1. To submit your selves so to God, as to be really content to forsake all
your sins, and to do whatsoever he requires of you; 2. To leave your selves
wholly to God (Psalm. 10. 14.) saying unto him with the whole heart concerning
all earthly things, yea and all spiritual things also, which are not of
absolute necessity to salvation: Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou will,
Mat. 26. 39. 1 Samuel 3. 18. 2 Samuel 15. 25, 26. Act. 20. 23, 24. 3. To entertain
the wrath of God, and rage of men, with a calm and quiet spirit, and without
hard thoughts of God, Jam. 4. 7. Act. 5. 41. and 7. 60. and 16. 25. 1 Pet. 2.
23. 4. To esteem those whom ye Phil. 2. 3. Gal. 5. 13. learn the meaning and
extent of those two verses, (which some Expositors will not show you. 5. To
accept of the Punishment of thine iniquity; and that not in words only, but
with the whole heart; acknowledging, that thou have walked contrary to God, and
that God has walked contrary to thee, and chastized thee for thy sins; and
that thou have merited at his hands, far sorer punishments, than he has laid
upon thee, etc. and to do all this with the whole heart. See Lev. 26. 41. 2 Chronicles. 12. 6. Ezra 9. 5. etc. Neh. 9. 33. Mic, 7 9. 6. Whatsoever good things
thou have, or good works thou do, to give the glory, with the whole heart, to
God, 1 Chronicles. 29. 10. etc. Act. 12. 21, 22, 23. But to get humility, to make
thee yield Phil. 2 4. 6. Know also, and consider, that, to say within thy
heart; As things be, or, are like to be, it will be a wiser part in me, to keep
this or that sin, than to keep God's commandment, wherein he forbids it; to say
this in thy heart at any time whatsoever, is to make thy self (as we use to
speak) wiser than God (to prefer thy wisdom before the wisdom of God:) which is
horrible pride. And yet this thou say with thy heart (and God hears its
voice) whenever, after considerable deliberation, thou art resolved to
transgress the Law of God, Mark 6. 26. And if any Go and learn: for thy love is
n^ larger, than thy obedience. 7. Converse much with humble persons. 8. Pray
unto him who is able; to cloth thee with humility. 9. Decline no man's company
for fear he should reprove thee for thy pride, but if there be any man near
thee, who is likely to tell thee of it, be sure to converse much with him.
Brethren, the pride, and I fear, the proud Apparel and or^aments of some of our
Intercessors, at least Professors, did hinder them from making up the Hedge,
and thrust and keep them out of the Gap; so that they could not stand there
before the LORD; and that thereupon the Pestilence did enter into London; and
that the sinful dumbness (Ezekiel. 3. 26.) or silence and Gastant-like ornaments
of some others, did strike or keep them out of the Gap, and that thereupon so
many houses were fired in London. (If any of you do not understand my language,
let them consider, (together with the pride and other sins of Professors) these
Scriptures, 1 Timothy 2. 9. Ezekiel. 22. 30, 3. 1 2 Samuel 24. 1. etc. Jer. 7. 18.
Ezekiel. 13. 5. Ezekiel. 3. 36. and women) be of great power with God ( Genesis 32. 24.
etc. Hos. 12. 3, 4. Exodus 32. 10. etc. Ezekiel. 14. 14* Jam. 5. 16, 17.) and that
the Professors have not yet prevailed with God, to destroy any of the Plows,
but only to stop the horses, or Drivers, etc. Psalm. 129. 3, 4. So that (for
ought ye know) the Plows be not yet legally destroyed for lack of more
Intercessors, (as Sodom was destroyed for want of a few more righteous persons;
at the most not above nine, Genesis 18. 32. And would it be wisdom in us, to
suffer England to be destroyed. or the Plows to be drawn over the backs of
Professors again, for want of more power with God? Genesis 32. 24. Hos. 12. 4. Not
so, Friends, I pray you, but as, when the Harvest is plenteous, and the
Laborers few, we must pray the Lord of the Harvest, to send forth Laborers
into his Harvest, Mat. 9. 37, 38. So when there is need of great strength, by
which we may have power with God; then it stands us upon, (even for our own
sakes) to turn as many as we can, to righteousness, and to wind up as many as
we can, to a very great height of faith and holiness; that they may be Princes
and men of great power with God; that they may prevail with him for themselves,
and the household of Faith. For we know not, how much help we have need of, and
a little true strength will help somewhat: But the truth is; as in the Reign of
Hezekiah, the Levites were more upright in heart, to sanctify themselves, than
the Priests, 2 Chronicles. 29. 34. So some of our Jacob-like plain men (Genesis 25.
27.) may by their prayers prevail more with God, than some of our fine-tongued
men, who to some seem to be Princes and Pillars. Not very long since, many
Professors Puritans of England: I would to God, we had many more such, as many
of them were: For many are called, but few chosen, Mat. 20. 16. and of them who
are chosen, few are Princes with God. Friends, I have now in part shown you,
what (notwithstanding the free grace of God) is the best way to kill the devil:
I beseech you therefore, even all Professors, by the mercies of God, at all
times, in the day time, in the night, when ye are at home, when abroad, when
alone, when in company, when alone with God, remember the Reformation of
Professors, and, to the uttermost of thy duty and opportunities, do whatsoever
thou can, (I speak to every one of you in particular) by instructing,
exhorting, admonishing, reproving, encouraging, in preaching, in conference, in
prayer, and by being a holy and good example to others, to reform and amend thy
domestics (children, servants, etc.) brethren and sisters, parents, near
neighbors, inferiors, etc. and universally all the Professors of England: To
enliven the dead, and awaken them who sleep, to open the ears of the deaf, and
the eyes of the blind, to heal and strengthen the feeble legs, arms and hands
of the lame and lamish, to lift up the hands which hang down, to quicken
slow-bellies, and to stop the mouths of unruly and vain talkers. Consider
therefore your ways, Hag. 1. 4, 5, 6. that Eccl. 7. 14.) And, consider one
another, to provoke unto love, and to good works, Heb. 10. 24. and to dehort
from unfit deeds and speeches. (For many do look on some of their own sins, as
no sins, etc.) And do this for women as well as men: for women have souls to
save, as well as men; though many of them walk, as if they had not. If the
Humiliation, Reformation, Prayers and Families of Professors generally, were
such as they ought to be; their Humiliation real, serious, extraordinary; their
Reformation extended to all their doings; their prayers effectual fervent
prayers; and their Families like little Churches. O what a heavenly and blessed
sight would this be? And then we might with some confidence expect a great
exaltation of Professors, yea and a happy change of the Nation also. But, until
I know or hear of a greater Reformation of Professors, or of greater care
taken, and fitter means used to reform them, then I yet know or hear of;
(although I know as much of God's power and free grace, as some other
Professors do; yet) I cannot expect, to have Professors greatly exalted: but I
hope many of you henceforth will do, as I desire to do for my part, even make
use of their Talents or Mites, to work out that blessed Reformation. I beseech
you therefore, Friends, every one of you, to hate unreservedly, and withal to
do, what ye can, to reform the behavior of all others, especially each one of
you, of his own Wife, Husband, Children, Servants, and of all, to whom he or
she is joined by any special bond, natural, Ecclesiastical, or civil. Is there
not a cause of doing thus? Verily there is very great cause: For it is, to do
and endeavor to do most excellent works, and pleasing to the Almighty,
conducing much to his honor, and the good of his Church, and of the persons
whom we seek to reform, yea and to our own good also, who seek to reform them.
For he who converteth a sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul
from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins, Jam. 5. 20. And the greater
the number of them that pray in faith, is, and the more reformed and holy they
be, the more prevalent and available with God their prayers be, Jam. 5. 15. 16.
and (if I mistake not, nay, I do not mistake) the pestilence, sword and guns,
and other plagues, and the dangers, fears and losses of Professors, all these
have lately called on us Professors, and are still calling on us, to pray in as
much faith and humility and holiness as we possibly can: the ( serious)
consideration whereof ought to excite us, to reform our selves, and all that
are within our gates, or under our authority, and as many as we can, of those
who are not; that we may prevail with the Almighty for our own good, and the
good of the Nation. Now to stir you up, and to encourage Heb. 10. 24. and 3.
12, 13. 2. What it is, to convert a man or a woman from the error of his or her
way? James, Chap. 5. 19, 20. tells you, in so doing, ye shall save a soul from
death, and hide a multitude of sins. I may well add, and do Jesus Christ and
his Church good service. 3. That since the beginning of this Revolution unto
this day, the work of reforming Professors and their Families, has prospered
so little, that it does not make a great noise in my years: and that, as during
part of this time, it has grown worse and worse with Professors in respect of
their liberty and peace, and the means of grace and comfort; so there is no
certainty of the continuance of the present stilness, etc. 4. That men of great
power with God may prevail with him for a time, whose prayers, after a while,
will be of no force. For Amos, after the Grasshoppers had eaten up the grass of
the latter growth, then he prevailed with God, to put an end to that plague,
and afterward, when the fire, by which the Lord contended; had devoured a part,
he prevailed with him, to cease that plague also: but after that, when the Lord
would plague Israel in a third way, then he did not prevail with him, Amos 7.
1. to 9. so that it is still high time for us, to consider our ways, Hag. 1.
5, 6, 7. and to consider one another, to provoke unto love, and to good works,
Heb. 10. 24. and to do what we can, for our Lord Jesus Christ, and his Religion
and people; and high time for every godly Minister to trust in God, and to cry
aloud, to lift up his voice like a Trumpet, and to show Professors their
Transgressions, Isa. 58. 1. Now this word is for you. Whose hearts, tongues and
feet should be most forward, earnest and active in this business? Should not
ours, who are by our Office and Calling, Christ's Stewards, Watchmen,
Overseers, Rulers? Why then should ye not all be busy in it, for Christ and
his Church: even for the enlarging and strengthening of Christ's kingdom, and
the bettering of the state of his people? Whose servants are ye? Are ye not
Christ's for the good of his Church? Ephesians. 1. 22. I pray* read and consider,
Mal. 2. v. 1, 2, 8, 10, 13. and Jer. 1. 17. where the Lord said unto Jeremy;
Speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I
confound thee before them. And, what has God commanded you to speak unto
Professors? He tell you; even that which he has taught Prophets, Apostles, and
spiritual Teachers of old to speak unto such Israelites and Christians, as were
guilty of such sins and failings as Professors are now guilty of. Some of you
know, the Quakers have reproached us with making a Trade of preaching: and
truly some amongst us in the time of the Interruption did make a very Trade of
it, and some did drive a very great Trade of it: (whose fault was that?) and,
it may be, some of us at this time are too like those Tradesmen, that are too
willing to please their Customers. I pray you, let us leave of this Trading:
Brethren, I request and exhort you, by the Lord Jesus, do all that ye can to
deserve the Character which Paul gives himself, 2 These. 2. to declare win souls
to Christ, and to draw and drive Professors out of their sins. Show not ^our
selves miserable Comforters, and Physicians of no value, healing Professors
wounds slightly, (Jer. 6. 14. Ezekiel. 13. 10. Covering them with fig leaves, or
drawing a poor thin skin over them, without healing them soundly at the bottom.
Satisfy not your selves with general or dark speeches (flatterers and
deceitful workers do content themselves with such;) but descend unto
particulars, and deal home and plainly with Professors concerning their sins.
We have indeed given forth our Testimony ( Rev. 11. 3. etc.) (many of us very
poorly) against Popery and other enormities not a few, in our Sermons and Books
and in dying, etc. but it may be, God will not look on us, as Witnesses that
have completed and perfected our testimony, till we have testified faithfully
and plainly against the Worldliness, Pride, Curiosity, Vanity, Conformity to
the World, Fashion-monging, and other Vices of Professors. Moreover, be not
like those Surgeons and Physicians, that do protract and lengthen their Cures,
to fill their purses: do not ye, I mean, withhold bitter Madicines and sharp
Corrosives from your Patients diseased and infirm souls longer than true
Christian wisdom allows you, but, in respect of time and all other respects,
show your selves really faithful to our Lord Jesus Christ and to his members,
as men who watch for their souls, and as they that must give account, Heb. 13.
17. As for the itching ears, whereof Paul prophesied, 2 Timothy, 4. 3, 4. if there
be any such things among your Hearers; let it not be any part of your business
to tickle them with fine, neat, trim, ornate, curious words and expressions,
but feed them with the sincere milk (and strong meat) of the word, which they
ought to desire, that they may grow thereby (in the knowledge of spiritual
things and in grace) 1 Pet. 2. 2. and content your selves with a manly kind of
Eloquence. Imitate the blessed and wise Apostle Paul, whom God sent to preach
the Gospel, not with wisdom of words; not with excellency of speech, or of
wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit, and of power, 1 Cor. 1. 17. chap.
2. 1, 4: And of this matter, as Paul seems to speak so much of it, because it
was the manner of the ambitious Teachers in the Church of Corinth, to use such
enticing speech, to draw Disciples after them; so I, brethren, have spoken and
do now write so much of it, because Satan has (since the death of Mr. Latimer)
(with the help of men pleasing, Gal. 1. 10.) increased in the hearts even of
Professors and religious preachers, a carnal affectation of dainty and
finely-filed phrases and expressions in a very great measure, and screwed such
fine phrases and expressions into Sermons, (which do obscure the Doctrine and
occasion too much meditation, etc.) Nay Satan has screwed them into our very
prayers; as if the ancient of days (Dan. 7. 22.) were become a a weak old man,
to be overcome with Court-like Complements; wherewith indeed he is no more
taken, than he would be with the neck of a Dog, Es. 66. 2. 3. And if many of
your fine phrases be Scripture Quakers do rail on holy and profitable Ministers
with Scripture-phrases. Brethren, I thank God, that I have learned of him, to
abhor this ambitious and polluting ornament of our Sermons and prayers, as a
great enemy to our Savior and his Church, and to poor miserable sinners: and I
pray you, cease from hunting after words, and from studying words too much, and
your Hearers, and matter too little; but for the honor of God and the good of
his Church, contend with all your might, and in all wisdom, against the vices
and sins of Professors. And to encourage you hereunto; know, that it is not so
long since, that a very unfit manner of preaching being taken up and much used
in the University of Oxford, Bishop Usher, and Bishop Potter did preach it
down, and destroy it. And Doctor Hoskins, a Conformist, but learned, and godly,
and wise, taking notice, that some came with naked breasts to his Lecture in
the Minster of Hereford, did so discourse against that ugly and immodest
spectacle, that they ceased to offend his eyes with it. I come now, to show you
all, as near as I reforming your selves and other Professors, even the best
directions and instructions that I am able, concerning that necessary and
blessed work. And first, take due care to (seeming good) Fruits any of thy sins
have yielded thee, yet to leave them all, as thou shall take notice of them
without any exception or reservation, John 7. 17. 2. Consider the Fruits of the
spirit, and the works of the Flesh, and the Garments, Armor, and sins
mentioned in Mat. 15. 19. Mark 7. 21, 22. Romans 1. 29, 30, 31, 32. Romans 12. 2,
9. to the end of the Chapter, Romans 13. 12, 13, 14. 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. 2 Cor. 7.
11. and 12. 20, 22. Gal. 5, 19. to the end of the chapter Ephesians. 4, 1, 2, 3. 21. to
the end of the Chapter, and 5. 1. to 7. Phil. 2. 2, 3, 4, 5. etc. and 3. 3.
Col. 3. 5. to 14. and 4, 5, 6, 17. 1 These. 5. 12. to 22. 2 Timothy 3. 1. to 7.
Tit. 2. 11, 12. Jam. 1. 26, 27. and 2. 1. and 3. 1. and 4. the whole Chapter, 1
Pet. 1. 17. and 2. 1, 2. and 3. 8, 9, 10, 11. 2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7, 10. and 2. 7,
8. and 3. 17, 18. 1 John 3. 3, 14, 16, 17, 18. John 9. 10. Rev. 21. 8. as also
1 Pet. 3. 1. to 7. and 1 Timothy 2. 8, 9, Byfields Catalogue of sins, or some book
like that. 3. Consider the ways of thy heart and thy outward carriage toward
God and man in thy younger and elder yeats, before and since thy marriage, at
home and abroad, in public and privately, in company of godly and graceless
persons, when a Servant or a Master of servants, toward inferiors, Superiors,
and equals, godly and ungodly persons, Friends and Enemies, etc. 4. Call to
mi^d (as far forth as ye can) What the Lord has spoken to you concerning the
sins of Professors by me face to face and by others. For he has spoken unto
some of you by me in London, Bristow, Essex, Hereford, etc. and to some of you,
of (called) small sins, and sins about Aparel and other things indifferent, and
to some of you of such sins as cause the destruction of most of those
Professors that are damned. 5. Compare what ye have heard and read, and the
behavior of the best Scripture and modern Saints with your own deeds,
speeches, gestures, and thoughts, to discern the agreement and disagreement
that is between them, etc. 6. Because it is not an easy matter for a man to
find out his sins, Psalm. 119. 96. Psalm. 19. 12. therefore pray ye unto God, to
reveal your sins to you. 7. Imitate David, Psalm. 141. 5. request thy fellow
Professors to tell thee of them, and converse much with such as are likely to
tell thee of them: and, when thou art told of any of them, esteem it a
kindness, and give thanks to God and man, 1 Samuel 25. 32, 33. 8. Consider, what
it is, to make straight paths for thy feet, Heb. 12. 13. to walk accurately,
precisely, circumspectly, Ephesians. 5. 15. and to be perfect, Mat. 5. 48. 2 Cor. 13.
11. 9. Consider, how many ways the Lords day may be profaned and misspent, and
how often thou have profaned and misspent part of it. 10. Consider, how many ways
ve have made your selves partakers of other folks sins, and how the Children
Israel were guilty of the sin of Achan, Josh. 7. 1. etc. 11. It may be thou
may do well, to mind some of their faults, partly to the end, thou may hear
of thy own. For some will be most likely to mind thee of thine, when thou
mindest them of theirs. 12. When thou art so happy, as to hear Christ speaking
unto thee by such a Preacher as Mr. Wroth was, do what thou can, to be where
he may take good notice of thee; that, if there be any Fault in thy
conversation, he may mind thee of it. For I remember upon a time, when Mr.
Cradock and I heard Mr. Wroth, Mr. Cradock stood just before him, and after
told me, he had done it, because he knew, if Mr. Wroth had taken notice of any
Fault in his behavior, he would have minded him of it before he had ended his
Sermon. 13. When thou art rebuked for any s^n, take good heed of justifying or
excusing thy self further then thou can show some very sufficient cause; lest
thy Friend be discouraged from doing the part of a faithful Friend to thee
another time, Psalm. 119. 75. Prove. 27. 5, 7.

(2.) Stir up in your hearts a comfortable expectation of better Christ's
honor. This may move you, to be the more serious dilig^nt and in amending,
every one himself and others, as many as he can.

3. If thou do desire to be exalted; be humble and resolve strongly (by Gods
help) to walk humbly, when thou shall be exalted. How to get humility, see
before Marg. 185.

4. Acknowledge and bewail thy spiritual weakness and want of ability to reform
thy self without the strength of Christ, John 15. 5. 2 Cor. 3. 5. and seek unto
God for strength.

5. Stir up your selves to trust in our Lord Jesus Christ for his assistance,
and for good success in seeking to reform, Mat. 28. 20. and let prayer be
joined with every part of it, Phil. 1. 19. and 4. 13. etc. yea request others
also, to pray for the same.

6. Hear gladly Ministers of reproving, Ezekiel. 3. 26. I mean, such as of
Professors, etc.

7. Hearken to the word of the Kingdom attentively, and consider it seriously,
and be sure to take good notice of thy own portion, especially, if it does
concern the reforming of any part of thy behavior.

8. Use all good means to nourish Faith. For that is of very great use and
force in this business, Acts 15. 9. Gal. 5. 6. 1 John 3. 3. and 5. 4, 5.

9. Quench not the good motions which the Holy Ghost is pleased to stir up,
time after time in thy heart, 1 These. 5. 19. especially desires to have thy
corruptions mortifyed, and purposes to strive against them, but do what thou
can by reading, meditation, conference and prayer, to nourish, augment, and
strengthen them.

10. Pray unto the Almighty earnestly to strengthen thee with strength in thy
soul, Psalm. 138. 3. and to cleanse thee from secret Faults, Psalm. 19. 12.

11. Compare thy ways with the ways of the best Saints, living and dead,
especially of Jesus Christ, Mat. 11. 20. 1 John 3. 3. and set the Lord always
before thy eyes, etc. This may excite thee, to imitate, etc. Consider well, 2
Cor. 3. 18. Isa. 6. 1. to 8.

12. Take heed continually to thy ways, according to the word of God, Psalm.
119. 9. Be sober and watchful, Luke 21. 34. 1 Pet. 5. 8. and, when evil motions
do arise in thy heart, deny them speedily, Tit. 2. 11, 12, Practice this, I
pray thee.

13. Make use of these Scriptures, Heb. 12. 13. Ephesians. 5. 15, 16. Mat. 5. 48. 2
Cor. 13. 11.

14. For the meaning and use of these Directions, let such as doubt, enquire of
able Ministers.

15. Of some special Meetings, what is fit to be done at them, etc.

(1) 1. Let Ministers and some other fit persons meet sometimes apart Let all
these give due diligence to be exemplary in their conversation, to be excellent
patterns, fit for other Professors to imitate. 3. At those meetings, let it be
considered; That the carriage of many Professors is so full of sins of Omission
and commission, that there is just cause of admonishing them thereof, for their
own good, God's honor, and the good of the Church; that some of their sins do
tend more than others, to God's dishonor, and more discredit Religion, and
more provoke God's wrath; that some Professors be blind; some lame, or lamish;
some dumb, or as it were tongue-tied; some dull, and heavy, and slow; some
proud; some too full of mirth and jollity; some worldly and covetous; some
peradventure covetous three ways; some asleep, or not thorougly awakened; some
stark dead in trespasses and sins, mere Formalists; and that, for some of these
evil qualities some Professors be affected with them in a greater measure than
others. Also at such Meetings, let it be resolved, what fit this company, to
heal and reform such Professors, but to deal with them all, as their states
require. (See 1 Cor, 4. 21. Ephesians. 5. 14. 1 Tit. 1. 11, 12, 13. 2 Cor. 13. 2.)
and that special care shall be taken, to find out, and quell, and beat down
those sins which do most irritate the Almighty, and most weaken and hinder
prayers, in regard of the sin it self, or its aggravations, and that every
Professors heart may be set against his dearest sin; (which is that which he
does most favor, and most spare, and least, or not at all strive, wrestle and
fight against. To that effect Edward Green, and rightly, Gal. 5. 17. 1 Pet. 2.
11.) (which setting of the heart so against that sin, is a sign of true grace.)
Let it there also be concluded, who of those that use to meet with this small
company, be fit to be reproved or admonished, and of what fault, and who of
this small company, shall deal with M. and who with N. etc. and what, tending
to the reformation of Professors, every one of them shall perform, and by what
times, and that they will all of them hearken, to hear and know the issue of
their endeavors, former and latter; (as Jeremy did, Chap. 8. 6.) that they may
proceed, as there shall be occasion. Let it there also be concluded, that due
care shall be taken by this small company to destroy and remove the causes, and
ignorance, unfaithfulness, carnal and worldly fear, diffidence, (not trusting
in God) carelessness and negligence, (not considering our selves and others,
etc.) pride, covetousness, voluptuousness, (not content with enough, etc.)
sinful silence, and holding our peace at the fault sone of another,
luke-warmness and want of zeal for Christ and his Church. These are part of the
causes, etc. in Ministers and others. (Nay, it is true.) To which may be added,
preaching without due consideration of the Hearers (that is worthy to be
mentioned twice) and without due preparation.

And as to Ignorance, my experience and charity tells me, that even Preachers
be (in part) ignorant of the doctrine of things indifferent, apparel and
ornaments of the body, conformity to the world, appearances of evil, things
lovely and of good report, and peradventure of the doctrine of sanctifying the
Sabbath, and the use of the Tongue, which yet may be gathered up and understood
in and by these Scriptures, Isa. 3. 18. etc. 1 Cor. 11. 14. 1 Timothy 2. 9, 10. 1
Pet. 3. 3, 4, 5. Romans 12. 2. 1 These. 5. 22. Phil. 4. 8, 9. Exra 20. 8. etc.
Isa. 58. 13, 14. Mat. 12, 36, 37. 1 Cor. 6. 10. Ephesians. 4. 25, 29, 30, 31. Jam. 1.
26. Romans 14. 15. concerning which things very many Professors, and some
Ministers are faulty.

(2). Let this small company draw to some extraordinary Meetings, and a prayer
suitable to it, let all that are present, mutually promise and engage, as
before the most high God, one to another, every one of them to all the rest, to
watch over one another, and to take care one of another spiritual estate,
dealing one with another concerning it faithfully, and in particular to mind
one another of sins and duties, committed or omitted, or to be done, as they
shall apprehend to be their duty; as also to take admonitions and reproofs well
in worth, and in good part, one from another. All this may be signified by
lifting up the hand, or by any other sign convenient. Also at this Meeting, ye
may do well to warn all the company, to amend their ways, to the uttermost of
their knowledge and abilities, and to let them know, that they may expect to
have their sins handled and spoken of hereafter (as there is or shall be just
causes) both at Meetings and privately, but in a fit manner, and as shall be
expedient for the credit of the persons admonished; and that if the Ministers
shall understand, that any of them be resolved, and do begin to endeavor to
amend any fault, that thenceforth they be not to expect any reproof for that
fault.

(3.) When there is any real Reformation of any Family or person, Cor. 3. 5, 6,
7. Luke 15. 3. Act. 8. 8. And let the success encourage you, to go forward with
the good work, which ye have in hand, cheerfully.

And now, I beseech all Professors, to enter upon this necessary business of
reforming forthwith, (without any procrastination or delay) Numb. 16. 46, 47,
48. and to do every part of it (as all works of Religion, and all we do for
God, ought to be done) seriously and diligently, and in the fear of God (away
with all trifling;) and not to neglect it, till ye have completed, every one
his and her part of it. For ye know not, how soon a prisonhouse, or fear of
it, or the grave Eccl. 9. 10. Zech. 1. 5. As for these and the rest of my
Instructions, ye may (for many of you are able) amend them, and add to them,
and hold them forth to others in a more winning manner, than I have done, unto
the exaltation of our great Master Jesus Christ, and the benefit of his people:
but, I pray you, give me not cause, by your ill dealing with him and them, to
mourn in secret for your luke-warmness and unfaithfulness, and for the evils
which may come to you and yours. For if my counsel be evil in your eyes, I
shall look on your not hearkening to it, to do your duty for God and his
Church, as a sign of more wrath. But, I hope good things will be done by very
many of you, even things tending to a great and blessed reformation, though I
thus speak.

I come now, in the last place, to speak somewhat more of reproving; as one of
the Middesses of reforming; and, although, in some cases, we be bound to
reprove them who are not called Professors; yet my business at this time being
the amendment of Professors, I shall content my self with this, that Professors
ought to reprove Professors for their sins. And this I find to be the duty of
Ministers and Preachers, 2 Timothy 4. 2. and of them and other Professors, Lev.
19. 17. Mat. 18. 15. R. And this thou who art a Professor, ought to do; 1.
For (the sake of) God. To keep thy fellow. Professors from polluting his holy
Name, and from grieving his good Spirit, and from disgracing his holy Gospel,
Gal. 6. 10. Eccl. 9. 10. Tit. 2. 5, 10. 2. For the good of the Offenders. To
convert them from the errors of their ways, to hide their sins, and so to save
their souls from everlasting death, Jam. 5. 20. If they be already in the state
which all Professors are not) yet this is the way to better their spiritual
estate, in respect of their faith, assurance, peace with God, peace with their
own consciences, spiritual joy and comfort, and encouragement, Romans 14. 17. It
is the way (if I may so speak) to keep God from looking on them, as his
enemies, and from wounding their very heads, Ps. 68. 21. It is a good way
indeed to increase their happiness in all respects, Psalm. 84. 11. 1 Timothy 4. 8.
3. For the benefit of the Church of God. For the more sinless and pure of life
any man is, 1. The better and more holily he can pray, and the more prevalent
his prayers will be with God, and consequently the more good he can do to and
for God's people, with and by his prayers, Jam. 5. 15, 16. 2. The more
exemplary his behavior is, the more forcible and effectual it will be, to win
others to amend their behavior, Mat. 5. 16. 1 Pet. 2. 12. and 3. 1, 2. 3. He
is likely to be the more beneficial to Christ's party diverse other ways: which
I will leave to your Meditations. 4. It will also be beneficial to thee who art
the Reprover. 1. Thou have ^^ne thy duty, and discharged a good conscience; and
that is not a very small matter, Psalm. 119. 55, 56. Act. 24. 16. 2 Cor. 10. 12.
2. To thee shall be delight, and a blessing of good things shall come upon
thee, Prove. 24. 25. That is, thou shall be glad, that thou have kept thy
conscience clear, and God will bestow good things of one kind or other on thee:
and so some do interpret, Jam. 5. 20. 3. He who rebukes a man, shall afterward
find more favor, than he who flattereth him with his lips, Prove. 28. 23.
Howsoever, the wounds of a friend are faithful, Prove. 27. 5.

Use. All which notwithstanding, (for I now come to reprove for not reproving)
it is not an easy thing to find a faithful man, Prove. 20. 6. and the duty of
reproving (as Mr. E. H. of Br. said) is generally neglected. O how common this
sin is! A. neglecting the education of his children; B. speaks of it behind his
back, but not a word to his face. C. in his prayer at a Meeting, makes such a
confession of sins and corruptions, as if the Company were (excepting outward
acts of gross sins) the worst persons in all the City, and yet speaks so in his
Sermon, as if they had scarce any sin at all, fit to be spoken of. D. preaches
of sins, under the notion of the devils dainties, and instanceth in none but
oppression, (of which belike none of the Hearers were guilty.) And men of
dainty expressions have foolish wisdom enough, to pass by the sins of their
Hearers, and to find out other matters enough to spend the true and faithful
Prophets; false Prophets, and faulty Prophets, Jer. 23. 13, 14. to 17. But they
also, who are not Preachers, are guilty of much sinful silence; I would have
them and the Preachers, to take great heed, lest Christ Mark 3. 4, 5. with
anger. For many professing men and women, through want of due admonition and
rebuke, do go on still in their trespasses, to the dishonor of Christ, and the
grieving of his holy Spirit, and the disgrace of Religion, (even opening the
mouths of profane persons, to blaspheme the right ways of the Lord) and (at
least) to the loss and damage (if not utter destruction) of both the parties;
of them whose behavior calls for reproof, and of them that do not pay it, (1
Cor. 3. 15.) and to the lengthening of that which we call our afflictions. And
is all this nothing to you, who esteem your selves the children of God, and
members of Jesus Christ, and say, that ye are taught of God, and that Jesus
Christ loved you, and gave himself for you? Is Christ's dishonor, and the
polluting of God's name, nothing to you? The grieving of the good Spirit of
God, nothing? The discredit of the true Religion, nothing? and the continuance
of the Saints afflictions, nothing? Is all this nothing to you? Is it possible,
that a man or woman should be a new creature, and not be grieved at the heart,
(...) that these things have come to pass through his or her sinful silence?
But, O, how few Professors do duly consider, of whose sins, and of which of
their sins, they be guilty and partakers? 1 Timothy 5. 22. And from say, that ye
may the more abhor this pernicious kind of silence, and humble your selves for
it, and hereafter not hold your peace from good and fit words, but, as there is
cause and occasion, open your mouths, and reprove, etc. Apologies. But here, it
may be, these dumb Professors (Ezck. 3. 16.) will say;

1. One, that reproving belongs to Ministers.

A. But I say, that it appertains also unto them who are not Ministers; as ye
may see, Lev. 19. 17. Mat. 18. 15. Luke 17. 3. 1 These. 5. 14. Heb. 3. 12, 13.
and 10. 24, 25.

2. Another, that he abstains from reproving Professors, because their sins be
few or little, and that some of them have but one ^ault.

A. Indeed, Friend, the Faults of some Professors are many. And for those who
have but few; know thou not, that, as (a few) dead flies do cause the
ointment of the Apoth^cary to send forth a stinking savor: so a little folly
does him who is in reputation for wisdom and honor? Eccl. 10. 1. Art thou
content, that Professors should use to trespass against the most high God in a
few little sins? to defile his name whom thou call thy heavenly Father, a
little? to grieve his holy spirit a little? to disgrace his Gospel a little?
and to make the ointment and reputation of Professors stink a little? yet all
this thou art guilty of, by keeping silence. Why man, our Lord Jesus Christ,
being the eternal Wisdom, and the word of God, having against the Angels of the
Churches of Pergames and Thyatira, against either of them, but a few things,
and against the Angel of the Church of Ephesus only his leaving of his first
love; yet he saw cause to reprove them all for their few Faults, as well as to
praise them for their good works; as ye may see Rev. 2. and also, that part of
their iniquities was the suffering of evil works. Take heed then, thou be not
rent and torn, as accessory to other men's sins, Hos. 5. 14. For I have already
shown thee, that there is no little sin, because there is no little God. The
true God is infinitely great and worthy, and every sin is committed against
him; therefore every sin is great. See Marg. 30. 31. Moreover, I fear, many
Professors do make nothing of some of their little Trespasses: and does far the
greater? Verily it does. And what do they, that do not reprove them? what do
they make of their sins? Truly, the offender and non-reprover are in that too
like one another. Beside, many little sins do yied but little (seeming) good
fruit; and that greatens them, that we dare trespass against the most high God,
and his holy, just, and good Commandments, for such poor matters, for trifles.
And I have spoken unto you of the Professors, which in that great day shall be
set on Christ's left hand; of the greater part of them, that they shall be
damned for little sins, and sins about things indifferent. Take heed therefore,
ye who use liberty, as an occasion to the flesh, and ye who are silent at such
men's sins; take heed, I say, lest ye be torn in pieces together, when there is
none to deliver, Psalm. 50. 22.

Repl. But some Professors use to practice (as far as I see) only one rotten or
frothy talk: I hope it is no fault in me, to let them alone in one sin.

A. No fault? Why man, for how many and what faults did Jesus Christ in the
time of his low estate, reprove Martha? Lu. 10. 41, 42. I think, it was not for
many, nor for great faults; yet he reproved her. And so did God for one fault,
reprove Sarah, Genesis 18. 15. etc. and Jacob, Genesis 35. 1. and Moses, and Aaron,
and Jehu, the Prophet Jehoshaphat, 2 Chronicles. 19. 2. and Paul, Peter, Gal. 2. 11.
etc. and an Angel, John, Rev. 19. 10. and 22, 9. Beside 1. It may be, this or
that Professor does practice more sins, than thou know of. (He may favor
his secret sins.) 2. Being reproved for one sin, that reproof may occasion him
to take notice of other sins, which thou know not of. 3. Howsoever, reproof
and instruction concerning one sin, is a good way to keep him from making a
Trade of many sins, yea of any one sin. If thou think thy self wiser than
Jehu the Prophet, and Paul; yet take heed of making thyself wiser than Christ:
for thou must stand before his judgment seat; and he is a righteous Judge, and
will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the
counsels of the hearts, and condemn (I fear) many Professors for idle words and
the like (small) sins, which they do seldom or never particularly grieve for,
or confess, and ask pardon of: which is an Argument, that they do in their
hearts make small matters of them; and the way (if I may so speak) to make God
look on them, as foul matters. Which I hold very fit to be thought of, and this
also, that it is a very wretched thing for a man who thinks himself wise, to
suffer any one of his fellow-Professors to be damned for one sin.

Another may say, I do say nothing to such a Professor, because he Dog, or a
Swine, Mat. 7. 6.

A. What a Professor, and a Dog, or a Swine? Either of these is a very heavy
charge, with which we must not without a very good ground, load any of those
who have gotten the name of Professors, (no nor of them who have not neither.)

Repl. If he be not a Dog, or Swine, yet, if I should reprove him, he would be
angry with me, and not receive the good counsel which I (...) him.

A. Art thou sure of that? Who told thee so? Did he himself at any time tell
thee so? Where is thy Charity? or, of what kind is it? For Paul speaking of
true Christian Charity, says, that it hops all (good) things, and thinks
no evil, 1 Cor. 13. 5, 7. to wit of others (without a sound and sure ground.)
Take heed of proving thy self, nothing, ver. 1. 2, 3. Verily if a man should
tell me, he would not receive instruction; I think, I should not absolutely
believe him. It London, for swearing. For I said unto them, Gentlemen, what are
ye, who thus transgress the Laws of God and the King, by swearing?) We know not
what success we shall have. 180000 chosen Warriors of Judah and Benjamin, being
assembled together, to fight against the ten Tribes; yet, when they understood,
it was the Lords mind, that they should depart every man to his house, and not
fight against their brethren, they hearkened to him, and (without any more ado)
returned to depart according to the word of the Lord, 1 King. 12. 21, 22, 23,
24. Also when the people of Israel, and the Priests, and the Levites had
mingled themselves with the Heathens, etc. although the hand of the Princes and
Rulers were chief in this trespass; yet Ezra the Priest prevailed with them to
put away their strange Wives and their children born of them, chap. 9. and 10.
and Nehemiah prevailed with the Nobles and to make restitution, chap. 5.
Neither do we find that Nebuchadnezzar or Belshazzar were displeased with
Daniel, when he told them, what would come upon them, Dan. 4. and 5. Why then
should not I and others hope, that God will give us good success, when we go in
the fear of God, and with an upright heart about this business? Why not, that
very many will prove like David, who if the righteous would smite him with
wounds of reproof, would receive them as a kindness, and as a precious
Medicine, which would help to heal his soul; so we are to understand, Psalm.
141. 5. My charity tells me that Professors do trespass in some sins, and
particularly concerning Ornaments of the body and other things indifferent,
ignorantly, not knowing that they be sins, or acting rashly, without due
consideration, of which if they were admonished, I cannot but hope, a great
part, and, it may be, some who are thy near neighbors, would receive
instruction, and reform. Therefore pity Professors, and do the best thou can,
to awaken them, and to open their eyes, and to help the lame to walk.

Apol. But some of the offending Professors are my Friends, and my Benefactors;
I live by their Benevolence and good will; and for that cause I do forbear
their sins.

A. Do you so? What are you? Are you a Christian? What is that then, which you
profess? Is it carnal self-love and self-seeking? If it be so, then your
silence does not belie your profession. But it may be, you think, you do love
them, who love you, (as the Publicans did (Mat. 5. 46.) And is this thy
kindness to thy Friends? Why man, thou ought to minister spiritual things to
them especially, who minister carnal and worldly things to thee: for that is
one of the Obligations which are upon thee. Yea, Friend, if thou see the Ass
of thine enemy, lying under his burden; thou ought (surely) to leave thy
business to help him, and if thou meet the Ox or Ass of thy enemy going astray;
thou ought (surely) to bring it back again, Exodus 23. 4, 5. and can thou
see the soul of thy Friend, who loves thee (and thou pretendest to love him)
can thou see his soul, going astray, and not cake some care and pains, to
bring it back again? and see the soul of thy Benefactor lying under a burden
of sin, and forbear to help it? Is this true love, and true Christianity, not
to take so much care and pains, to help thy Friends soul as thou ought to
help thy enemies Ass? Surely, I know not, where this is true Christian love,
unless it be beyond the Antipodes, or where all the people be Heathens. For as
for Christians, they ought to have more respect to the souls one of another,
than to the bodies. But alas, Friend, all this while, I have our most dear
Friend Jesus Christ, Mat. 6. 9. 1 Cor. 10. 31. Can thou persuade thy self, to
neglect him also, whom thou ought to respect above all the Creation? But
very many Professors do little think, how many sins of others they be partakers
of, and how much their iniquity is increased through their sinful silence.

Apol. But Sir, will some say in their hearts; (I fear it is so with Psalm. 14.
1.) if I should reprove N. I should lose the help of his purse.

A. How long have thou been a Professor, that thou have so little Charity? For
he ought to love thee the more for thy Faithfulness (Prove. 27. 5, 6.) and the
rather to make thee one of the Mrs. of his purse. And why art thou so foolish
and so slow, to believe what the Scripture has spoken? Does not the spirit of
truth by Solomon say, Prove. 28. 23. that He who rebukes a man, shall
afterward find more favor, than he who flattereth with the Tougue; and Prove.
16. 7. that when a man's ways please the Lord, he makes his enemies to be at
peace with him? And, will he then suffer thy Friends, when thou do thy duty,
to do them good, to show themselves unkind, and as no Friends to thee. Be not
faithless, but believing: trust in God. Howsoever, the favor and loving
kindness of God is better than life, Psalm. 63. 3. Take heed, God look not on
thee, as a man-pleaser, and none of the servants of Christ, Gal. 1. 10.

Obj. But, is it not enough, that I do frequently and earnestly pray for the
Reformation of Professors?

A. That indeed is more, than most Professors do; I think so, and that they do
not judge, that there is need of any great Reformation. Yet that is but part of
thy duty. This thou ought to do, and not to omit reproof. And it may be, God
has not heard thy prayers for them, because thou do not reprove them.

Apol. But peradventure one or two will say, they be not thoroughly

A. Whose fault is that? Why do thou delay to cleanse thy ways according to
Gods rule? Psalm. 119. 9. Neither do Christ's words, Mat. 7. or any other
Scripture import, that unreformed or poorlyreformed Professors be freed from
the duty of exhorting and reproving others: So that thy silence at other men's
faults does increase thine iniquity. It is indeed better to sweep before thy
own door first: but if thou be so foolish, as not to sweep there, necessity is
laid upon thee, to consider and reprove other Professors, and woe may come to
thee, if thou do not.

Obj. But, if I do tell others of their faults, then (belike) they will upbraid
me with mine.

A. I could wish all thy near Neighbors and acquaintance would tell thee of
them: then, it may be, thou would amend them, which would be far better for
thee, than to suffer in Hell fire for them.

Use 2. Receive then this Admonition; reprove those Professors thee thereunto,
consider. It is the will of God and thy duty: therefore do it, 1 These. 5. 18.
(yea, it is said, Lev. 7. 19. 17. Thou shall in any wise rebuke thy Neighbor,
and not suffer sin upon him: which words do import, that we must do it (as we
say) by all means, and not suffer other affairs and matters to keep us from
doing it.) Thou have authority to do it. Has not God commanded thee? It is a
debt which thou owe to such as need it; pay that thou owe, withhold not
good from them to whom it is due, Romans 13. 8. Prove. 3. 27. It tends to Gods
honor and glory. Do it for his sake. And to the healing and good of the blind,
lame, sleepy, etc. Do it also for their sakes. Do it also for thy own sake;
that thou bear not sin for thy Neighbor. So some render the last clause, Lev.
19. 17. that is that thou be not punished for not rebuking him. Keep thy self
pure, be not partaker of other men's sins: 1 Timothy 5. 22. and partaker (for
certain) thou art, with him or her whom thou ought to reprove, either of
those trespasses for which thou ought to reprove them, or of the trespasses
in sins of the same kind which they commit after, or of both. One thing more
some have inferred from the Coherence Lev. 19. 17. viz. that not to reprove is
to hate: which inference, whether it be right or not; yet, if he who spares
his rod, does, in the Language of the Holy Ghost, hate his Son (as he does; for
that is the expression, Prove. 13. 24.) then, in the Language of the Holy Ghost,
he who spares words of reproof, when he ought to reprove, hates those whom he
ought to reprove; his Neighbors, Friends, Benefactors Professors, and of what
sort soever they be. And I would not that Professors should hate one another,
but reprove offenders; as the LORD himself did Sarah, Genesis 18. 12, 15. the Son
of God, Martha, Luke 10. 41, 42. and the Angels the Churches of Asia, Rev. 2.
and 3. and the Holy Ghost does the World, John 16. 8, 9. Nathan, David, 2 Samuel
12. and Paul his fellow Apostle, Peter, Gal. 2. In a word, do ye desire to walk
purely, and wisely? Tread then in the steps of Paul, and other godly persons,
as they did in the steps of God and Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. 11. 1. Now causes of
our sinful silence may not be of force to destroy or weaken our holy Resolution
to admonish, reprove, etc. Consider, what it is for a man to love himself
aright. 2. Stir up in thy heart very much love of God, and much filial fear of
God, and a strong Affiance in God, and much brotherly love toward Professors
and the Church of God, especially in respect of their spiritual welfare. For,
if these five things be really in thee and do abound, they will make thee, that
thou shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ, (2 Pet. 1. 8.) and particularly (whatsoever more may be said of them)
they will move thee effectually, to do, what I would fain have thee to do, (to
labor to reform, to reprove, etc.) and that, as thy duty, and also for the
service and honor of God, and for the good of Professors and and Affiance in
God will drive away carnal and worldly feats of men, of the loss of the love of
men, of the anger and ill will of men, of poverty, of men's shutting up their
bowels of compassion from us contrary to 1 John 3. 17. And what says David?
Psalm. 31. 19. O how great (says he unto God) is thy goodness, which thou have
laid up (in store? Sure it is a very great measure of Happiness which he speaks
of. And for whom has God laid it up in store? Verily, for them who fear God,
and for them who trust in him before the sons of men: that is, (not who trust
in God rather, than in men, or more than in men, but) for them who, by their
carriage toward men and dealings with men, do make it appear that they do
really trust in God. Truly, Friends, it is a wretched thing for a man, to say,
God is his Father, and that he trusts in him for a mansion in Heaven, and not
to trust in and rely on him for his daily bread; as if his Father were dead.
But now let me bestow some Rules on you concerning reproving. 1. Know, that
usest to have fellowship in the Gospel at meetings, but with other Professors
also. 2. Consider, whom to reprove, when, where, how, etc. whom first, etc. 3.
Admonish and reprove with as much heavenly wisdom and fit humane discretion as
thou can, begging wisdom of God, who gives to all men liberally, Jam. 1. 5.
and 3. 17. 1 Kings 3. 5. etc. 4. As lovingly (for true Christian love) and as
mildly and meekly, as thou can, unless there be cause to deal otherwise, Gal.
6. 1. 2 Timothy 2. 6, 24, 25. 1 Timothy 5. 20. 1 Cor. 4. 21. Jude ver. 22, 23. Gal.
2. 11. 5. Show all due and fit respect to the credit of offenders, etc. Mat.
18. 15, 16, 17. 1 Cor. 4, 6. 6. Having respect to the calling and age of the
offenders, according to Col. 4. 17. 1 Timothy 1. 2. and to the temper and
disposition of their spirits generally. 7. Consider also thy self, thy own
calling, age, etc. For such Language did become our Savior and Paul, as would
not have been fit for some of the ordinary Pastors, Luke 24. 25. Gal. 3. 1. 8.
Above all other Professors (excepting thy self) be sure, (as far forth as there
is cause) to admonish and request the Ministers and Preachers, to apparel and
adorn their Souls, Bodies, Sermons, and Prayers, and all their behavior, more
like men professing Godliness, Sobriety, (Modesty) Mortification, and Humility
(1 Timothy 2. 10. Tit. 2. 3, 4, 5, 8.) and to conform more fully to the Doctrine
and practice of Paul (1 Cor. 2. 1. etc. 1 Cor. 14. 8, 9. 1 These. 2. 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8.) and to deal more faithfully, and more plainly, and more home, with thee
and other Professors, than many of them use to do* and not to cease from
admonishing, rebuking, etc, till ther^ (...) an Universal Reformation. Nay,
they who are not Preachers, have Authority to admonish Ministers, 1 Th^s. 4. 8,
and 5. 14. Hebr. 3. 12, 13. Col. 4. 17. and, according to the seeing of my
eyes, and my best intelligence, the outsides and silence, and other sins of
Ministers in London and elsewhere do require it. 9. Imitate Abigail, 1 Samuel 25.
36. Reprove no man, whilst he is in his drink (I have heard of some Professors,
that they have been drunk) or in a passion: for with that, some men's minds are
disabled, as much as they would be wi^h excess of drink. Yet here, query,
whether a Professor ought not to bestow a few words of rebuke on his
fellow-Professor who shows himself drunk, or in a passion, in the presence and
sight of profane persons, that they may not have occasion, to say, We do
indulge and bear one with another carnally; I mean, whether he ought not to do
so much forthwith: One of the best times to reprove an offender, should be,
when he has been at some exercise of Religion, as a Fast, or hearing some
wholesome instructions concerning the soul, or at prayer, especially praying
apart from others: If a Professor will not immediately or soon after that
receive a Reproof with a quiet spirit, I know not when he will, but shall look
on it, as a very bad an hundred and twenty years, nor, let it alone this year
also, nor, yet forty days, but to day, Heb. 4. 7. Defer not this necessary
work of reproving, etc. without just cause, no not for a moment. For we know
not, what a day may bring forth, Prove. 3. 28. Prove. 27. 1. Jam. 4. 14. and many
Professors have need of much help; yea some, I believe, who have specious and
large Forms of Godliness, long prayers, (Eccl. 5. 1, 2, 3. Mat. 6. 7, 8, 9.
etc. Mat. 23. 14.) etc. and some, who, in their speeches at times, do make a
fair show of true grace (it may be of much) of Zeal, Humiliation,
Mortification, Humility, Sobriety, Modesty, tenderness of Conscience, contempt
of earthly things, etc. For, that notwithstanding, a considerable part of their
ornaments and behavior savours and smells (what if I had said stinks?) of
Pride, Vanity, Curiosity, foolishness, (foolish-talking, and unseemly jesting)
excessive mirth and jollity, lasciviousness, love of pleasure and ease,
palat-pleasing, men pleasing, etc. one part of their behavior contradicting
the other part, 2 Timothy 3. 5. Tit. 1. 16. O how piously, religiously and holily
(for the words) some will sometimes talk, who are very little or just nothing
for true Christians. Like the legs of the lame, which are not equal, or a
parable in the mouth of a fool, Prove. 26. 7. As if a man should have (...)
Garlands or Ivy-bushes hanged at the door of his house, and very little or no
good drink within it. What said Mr. Walter Cradock? I protest (quoth he) these
women are enough to make a man an Athiest, speaking of some female Professors;
which he might well have spoken of some Male Professors also. 11. Whosoever
doubts concerning any matter, let him ask of them who are able to instruct
him, and also conscientious, to direct him aright.

Use. 3. With all importune the Almighty always, and with all (Luke 18.) to
reform Professors, and to stir up Professors, (Preachers, and else) to do what
they are able, both privately and publicly, when they be the mouth of God to
men, or the mouth of men to God, and in all other cases, toward the reforming
of Professors, especially in reproving them for their sins and trespasses, and
to increase the abilities of such as are willing, and to bless their
praiseworthy enterprises. For, as far as I see, or have been informed, and can
remember, very few Professors do pray for the Reformation of Professors under
the name of Reformation; I mean, using that term. Many use to speak, as if they
should say, some Professors indeed might do well to amend some matters: but
their faults be so few and so small, that the amendment of them would scarce or
not at all deserve the name of a Reformation: so that it is not very material,
whether they do amend or not. But I am not of this judgment.

Use. 4. Let all those Professors who are fit to be reproved (the very great)
either prevent the Reprovers (for, I hope, they will be many) or else prepare
themselves to receive Reproofs with a calm and thankful heart, and when
Reproofs come, entertain them with such a spirit. To which end, I counsel thee,
who art a Professor, 1. To stir up in thy heart, a real and earnest desire, to
know more of thy sins, and of the dangers and evils of them. 2. To request and
entreat Professors, (Ministers and others,) to speak to thee of thy sins, and
to tell thee, that they be thine, and to reprehend thee for them. Say (in thy
heart) as David, Psalm. 141. Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness,
etc. 3. When any man or woman reproves thee, remember, that it is his or her
duty so to do. So that thou may very well say, as David said of Shim^i, 2 Samuel 16. The Lord has bidden him, and who shall then say unto him, wherefore
have thou done so? 2 Samuel 16. 10, 11. 4. Exercise thy charity in believing,
that he reproves thee out of true Christian love, aiming at thy good, and the
other worthy ends before specified. For this is one of the effects of charity,
1 Cor. 13. 5, 7. 5. Remember, that it is better, to hear the rebuke of the
wise, than to hear the song of Fools, Eccl. 7. 5* (...) open rebuke is better
than secret love; and that the wounds of a friend are faithful, Prove. 27. 5, 6.
(To a wise man love hidden and not Micaiah, 1 King. 22. 23. and in all
Professors, as in David, to take reproofs, as he did, Psalm. 141. 1 Samuel 25. 32,
33. Then our Preachers would be far more frequent and bold in reproving, than
now they be, and speak plainly, not suffering Professors to proclaim themselves
Gods enemies, by going on still in their trespasses, Psalm. 68. 21. and
Professors would take a reproof, as a kindness; and for it love the Reprover;
which would be a sign of grace in the persons reproved, and would be followed
with a happy amendment of such Professors ways. Yea, if Professors do request
their fellow-Professors, to mind them of their faults, and really resolve to
take a reproof, as a kindness; then, if some of their fellows and friends shall
neglect them, it may be, God will do them much good by the upbraiding, harsh
and bitter words of an enemy. For he can bring good out of evil. Howsoever, a
great Reformation would follow; and that (with humility) would (in due time)
bring a great exaltation and much prosperity, 1 Pet. 5. 6.

Obj. But what said one unto me lately? What (said he) if other

Ans. What if Lot were living again in Sodom? yet he would be righteous and
say, I pray you brethren, do not so wickedly, Genesis 19. 7. What if the
Israelites would serve false Gods? yet Joshuah and his house would serve
JEHOVAH, Jos. 24. 15. What if all flesh has corrupted his ways upon the
earth? yet Noah will be a just and perfect man, and a Preacher of
Righteousness, and walk with God, Genesis 6. 9, 12. What if a Priest does only see
the man who is wounded and left half dead, and a Levite does only look on him
somewhat more than the Priest, but neither of them go unto him and seek to heal
his wounds: yet be thou like the Samaritan, who went unto him, and bound up his
wounds, poured in oil and wine, etc. Luke 10. 30. etc. Be thou, I say, like
the Samaritan: show thy self a true neighbor to those Professors, whom Satan
has wounded, and who have wounded themselves; have compassion on them, and
show mercy to them. If others will not do their duty; yet do thou thine, and do
it thoroughly: and God will bless thee. Take courage, I say, and do (thy duty)
and the Lord shall be with the good, 2 Chronicles. 19. 11.
