THAURAM TANJAH his Speech in his Claim, verbatim.
AS concerning England, to that Speech printed I now say, What I did demand, I
do affirm: What I have written, I have written: And the same I do here
maintain, not by force of Arms, but by wisdom from the Spirit of God.

Secondly, I do demand the Crown of FRANCE, as lineally descended from CHARLES
of Castile, who was son-in-law unto CHARLES the Great.

Next, I demand the Crown both of REME and ROME, from my ancient Parent Pope
NICOLAS of the House of AUSTRIA, who married the Flamina of Flandriah; in whose
RIGHT lies included the TITLE unto NAPLES, SISSILIAH, and JERUSALEM, THE
INHERITANCE OF ALL MY BRETHREN the Jews.

I did carry my FIELD SIGNENANCE degraded, IN HOMAGE UNTO ENGLANDS REGENCIE.
ThauRam Tanjah, Leader of the Peoples, the LORD's Host, for their Return.

Robert Norwood, and William Finch,
do witness: These are the words read by Mr. Tauny, with the POINT of his Sword
DOWNWARD: And with his Sword HOSTILE, when he CLAIMED the CROWN of FRANCE, with
the Ensuing Titles. This 8 of June, 1654.
