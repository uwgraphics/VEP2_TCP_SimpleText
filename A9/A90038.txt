A NEW-YEARS-GIFT FOR THE RUMP.
YOu may have heard of the Politic Snout,
Or a tale of a Tub, with the bottom out,
But scarce of a Parliament in a shitten clout.
Which no body can deny.
'Twas Atkins first served this Rump in with Mustard,
The Sauce was a compound of Courage, and Custard;
Sr. Vane blessed the Creature: Nollsnufled, and Bluster'd.
Which no body can deny.
The Right was as then, in Old Olivers Nose,
But when the Devil, of that did dispose,
It Descended from thence, to the Rump, in the Cloze.

The Retentive faculties being gone,
The Juggle is stale, and Money there is none.

To Enter, but them the Rump did defy all,
By the Ordinance of Self-denial.
Which no body can deny.
Our Politic Doctors do us Teach,
That a Bloud-sucking Red-coat's as good as a Leech,
To Relieve the Head, if applied to the Breech.
Which no body can deny.
But never was such a worm as Vane;
When the State scoured last, it voided him then,
Yet now he is crept into the Rump again.
Which no body can deny.
Ludlow's Fart, was a Phrophetique Trump:
(There never was any thing so Jump)
'Twas the very Type, of a vote of this Rump.
Which no body can deny.
They say it is good Luck, when a Body rises
With the Rump upward; but he that advises
to Live in that Posture, is none of the wisest.
Which no body can deny.
The Reason is worse, though the Rhyme be Untoward,
When things proceed with the wrong end Forward,
But they say their's sad news to the Rump, from the Nor'ward.
Which no body can deny.
It Is a wonderful thing the strength of that Part,
At a Blast, it will take you a Team from a Cart;
And Blow a man's Head away with a Fart.
Which no body can deny.
When our Brains are Sunck below the Middle,
And our Conscience steered by the hey down-Diddle,
Then things will go round without a Fiddle.
Which no body can deny.
You may Order the City with a Hand-Granado,
Or the General with a Bastonado,
But no way for a Rump like a Carbonado.
Which no body can deny.
To make us as famous in Council, as Wars,
Here Is Lenthal, a Speaker for mine --
And Fleetwood is a man of Mars.
Which no body can deny.
It Is pity that Nedham's Fallen into Disgrace,
For he Orders a Bumme with a mavelous Grace,
And ought to attend the Rump by his Place.
Which no body can deny.
Yet this in spite of all Disasters,
Although he has Broken the Heads of his Masters,
It Is still his Profession, to give 'em all Plasters.
Which no body can deny.
Let em cry down the Pope, till their Throats are sore,
Their design was to bring him in at the Backdoor:
For the Rump has a mind to the scarlet whore.
Which no body can deny.

However unskilful in any of the rest,
The Rump speaks the Language of the Beast.
Which no body can deny.
They talk that Lambert is like to be tried
For Treason, and Buggerie beside,
Because that he did the Rump bestride.
Which no body can deny.
The Rump's an old story, if well understood
It Is a thing dressed up in a Parliaments Hood,
And like't, but the Tail stands where the Heads should.
Which no body can deny.
'Twould make a man scratch, where it does not itch,
To see forty Fools Heads in one Politic Breech,
And That, -- Hugging the Nation as the Devil did the witch.
Which no body can deny.
From rotten Members preserve our Wives:
From the mercy of a Rump, our Estates and our Lives:
For they must needs go, whom the Devil Drives.
Which no body can deny.
