The Three Norfolk Clergy-Mens Brief Discovery, etc. Presented by them to the
King and Parliament, against the People called Quakers, Modestly Observed to
our Superiors,
IT does not Surprise us to be Evilly Entreated, and especially by those that
have an Interest in doing it.

But if Conscience prevailed more than Contention, and Charity overruled
Prejudice, we might hope for fairer Quarter from our Adversaries.

But such is our Unhappiness, that nothing less will satisfy them, than
breaking in upon the Indulgence that we enjoy; if they could persuade the
Government to Second their Attempts to a new Persecution.

In Order to which, we perceive they have been hard at Work, to Pervert our
Books, Violate our Sense, Abuse our Practice, and Ridicule our Persons; knowing
very well with whom they have to do, and that the Patience of our Profession is
their Security in Abusing of it.

However, if it has Weight enough with our Superiors to Expect a Fresh Defense
of our Principles and Practices, we shall (with God's Assistance) be ready for
their Satisfaction, once more, to Justify both, against the Insults of our
Restless Adversaries: Who, otherwise, we take leave to say, would not deserve
our Notice; since we have already Repeatedly Answered their Objections in
Print, and think it our Duty as well as Wisdom to use the Liberty, the
Government has favored us with, in as Peaceable and Inoffensive a manner as
may be.
