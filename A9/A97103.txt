THE POWER OF LOVE.

To every Reader.
FOr there is no respect of persons with God* and whosoever is possessed with
love, judges no longer as a man, but god-like, as a true Christian. What Is
here toward? (says one) sure one of the Family of love: very well! pray stand
still and consider: what family are you of I pray? are you of Gods family? no
doubt you are: why, God is love, and if you be one of Gods children be not
ashamed of your Father, nor his family: and be assured that in his family, he
regards neither fin^ clothes, nor gold rings, nor stately houses, nor abundance
of wealth nor dignities, and titles of honor, nor any man's birth or calling,
indeed he regards nothing among his children but love. Consider our Savior
says, He that has this worlds goods, and sees his brother lack, how dwells
the love of God in him? Judge then by this rule who are of Gods family; look
about and you will find in these woeful days thousands of miserable,
distressed, starved, imprisoned Christians: see how pale and wan they look:
how coldly, raggedly, and unwholsomely they are clothed? live one week with
them in their poor houses, lodge as they lodge, eat as they eat, and no
oftener, and be at the same pass to get that wretched food for a sickly wife,
and hunger-starved children; (if you dare do this for fear of death or
diseases) then walk abroad, and observe the general plenty of all
necessaries, observe the gallant bravery of multitudes of men and women
abounding in all things that can be imagined: observe likewise the innumerable
numbers of those that have more then suffices. Neither will I limit you to
observe the inconsiderate people of the world, but the whole body of religious
people themselves, and in the very Churches and upon solemn days: view them
well, and see whether they have not this worlds goods; their silks, their
beavers, their rings, and other divises will testify they have; I, and the
wants and distresses of the poor will testify that the love of God they have
not. What is here aimed at? (says another) would you have all things common?
for love seeks not her own good, but the good of others. You say very true,
it is the Apostles doctrine: and you may remember the multitude of believers
had all things common: that was another of their opinions, which many good
people are afraid of. But (says another) what would you have? would you have
no distinct on of men, nor no government? fear it not: nor fly the truth
because it suites not with your corrupt opinions or courses; on Gods name
distinguish of men and women too, as you see the love of God abound in them
toward their brethren, but no otherwise; And for that great mountain (in your
understanding) government, it is but a molehill if you would handle it
familiarly, and be bold with it: It is common agreement to be so governed:
and by common agreement men choose for governors, such as their virtue and
wisdom make sit to govern: what a huge thing this matter of trust is made
of? and what cause is there that men that are chosen should keep at such
distance, or those that have chosen them be so sheepish in their presence?
Come, you are mightily afraid of opinions, is there no other that you fear?
not the Anabaptists, Brownists, or Antinomians? Why do you start man? have a
little patience, would you truly understand what kind of people these are, and
what opinions they hold? If you would; be advised by some learned man, and
with him consult what has learnedly been written of the most weak and and
vicious amongst any of them that could be found, and make your conclusion
(according to custom) that they are all such: but if you would free your
selves from common mistakes concerning those your brethren, then acquaint your
selves with them, observe their ways, and enquire into their doctrines your
self, and so make your conclusion, or judge not of them; visit them, hear
them out, stand clear from all prejudging: and then see what dangerous people
they are that are generally so called: particulars being absurd rules of
judging; for so the Turk is misled in his judgment of Christianity: and no
marvel since he judges thereof by the doctrine and life of the most
superstitious, Idolatrous, and vicious amongst them. Well, what next are you
afraid of? for some men take delight to be under the spirit of bondage, and do
not think themselves in good estate except they be in fear: but come, fear
nothing, you are advised by the Apostle to try all things, and to hold fast
that which is good: to prove the Spirits whether they be of God or not: it is
your self must do it, you are not to trust to the authority of any man, or to
any man's relation: you will find upon trial that scarcely any opinion has
been reported truly to you: and though in every one of them you may find some
things that you cannot agree unto, you will yet be a gainer, by discovering
many excellent things that you as yet may be unsatisfied in, and by due
consideration of them all perfect your own judgment. Read the ensuing
discourse impartially, and you will find the mind of him that hates no man
for his opinion; nor would have any man troubled for any opinion, except such,
as make the blood of Christ ineffectuall, or such as would destroy all that
will not submit to their opinions; he seems to be of the Apostles mind,
that considered all other things in love: (and that in matters of moment too,
even where some observed a day unto the Lord, and others not observed) He bids
you walk in love, as Christ has loved you, and gave himself for you, an
offering and a Sacrifice; you that love your brother so poorly, as that you
cannot allow him the peaceable enjoyment of his mind and judgment would hardly
lay down your life for him; let brotherly love continue, and let every one
freely speak his mind without molestation: and so there may be hope that
truth may come to light, that otherwise may be obscured for particular ends:
plain truth will prove all, sufficient for vanquishing of the most
artificial, sophistical error that ever was in the world; give her but due
and patient audience, and her persuasions are ten thousand times more powerful
to work upon the most dull refractory mind, then all the adulterate
allurements and deceivings of art. What is here published is out of fervent love
to the Communion of Christians: that they might taste and see how good the Lord
is, In whose presence there is fullness of joy, and at whose right hand there
are pleasures for evermore: Wherefore rejoice in the Lord always, and again I
say rejoice: and let your song be always, Glory be to God on high, in earth
peace, good will toward men. Let truth have her free and perfect working, and
the issue will be increase of believers: let faith have her perfect working,
and the issue will be increase of love: and let love have her perfect working,
and the whole world will be so refined, that God will be all in all; for he
that dwells in love, dwells in God, in whom, ever fare you well, and be
cheerful.

THE POWER OF LOVE.
Tit. 2. 11, 12. The grace (or love) of God that brings salvation unto all
men has appeared, teaching us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to
live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.
IT is evident (though it be little regarded or considered, the more is the
pity) that in natural things all things whatsoever that are necessary for the
use of mankind, the use of them is to be understood easily with out study or
difficulty: every Capacity is capable thereof; and not only so, but they are
all likewise ready at hand, or easily to be had: a blessing that God has
afforded to every man, insomuch, that there is no part of the habitable world,
but yeeldes sufficient of useful things for a comfortable and pleasant
sustentation of the inhabitants; as experience testifies in all places; and
Saint Paul witnessed that God left himself not without witness, in that he
did good, gave them rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, feeding their
hearts with food and gladness: by all which it plainly appears; that God
ever intends unto man a pleasant and comfortable life: you know it is said,
that God made man righteous, but he sought out many inventions: that is, he
made him naturally a rational creature, judging rightly of all things, and
desiring only what was necessary, and so being exempt from all labor, and care
of obtaining things superfluous, he passed his days with abundance of delight
and contentment: until he sought out unto himself many inventions: inventions
of superfiuous subtilities and artificial things, which have been multiplied
with the ages of the world, every age still producing new: so now in these
latter times we see nothing but men's inventions in esteem, and the newer the
more precious; if I should instance in particulars, I should or might be
endless, as in diet, your selves know to your costs, (for it costs you not
only your monyes, but your healths, and length of days) that this fruitful
nation suffices not to furnish scarce the meanest meal you make, but
something must be had to please the luxurious palate from foreign and far
countries: and ever the farther the better, and the dearer the more acceptable;
you know likewise the excessive provision that is made for entertainments and
set meetings, where all gross meats (you know my meaning) must be banished,
and nothing admitted but what is rare and fine, and full of invention, in the
dresses, sauces, and manner of service: where all the senses must be pleased to
the height of all possible conceit. If I should reckon up your new inventions
for buildings, and furniture for your houses, and the common costlinesse of
your apparel, and should set before you the manifold vexations, perplexities,
distractions, cares, and inconveniences that accrue unto you by these your
vain and ridiculous follies, I might be endless therein also, and lose my
labor; for there is no hope that I should prevail for a reformation of these
things, when your daily experience scourges you continually thereunto, in one
kind or other, and all in vain; yet I shall take leave to tell you that in
these things, you walk not as becomes the gospel of Christ, but are carnal
and walk as men, as vain, fantastical, inconsiderate men; such as very
heathen and mere natural men would be a shamed of: their experience (that a
life according to nature, to be content with little, with what was ever ready,
and easy to be had, was the most pleasant life and exempt from all vexations)
was instruction sufficient unto many of them, to frame themselves thereunto,
and to abandon all kinds of superfluities, without retaining the least; and
thereby obtained a freedom to apply themselves to the consideration and
practice of wisdom and virtue.

It is a wonderful thing to my understanding, that men should call themselves
Christians, and profess to be religious, and to be diligent readers of
Scripture, and hearers of Sermons, and yet content themselves to be indeed in
many things carnal, and to walk as did the most indiscreete and inconsiderate
Gentiles. Does the Scripture teach no more then nature teaches? though it do
infinitely, yet your practice compared with wise considerate natural men
declares it does not; how extremely then (think you) do you cause the name
of God to be blasphemed? Do you think it is sufficient that you are not
drunkards, nor adulterers, nor usurers, nor contentious persons, nor covetous?
beloved, if you will truly deserve the name of Christians, it is not
sufficient: but you are to abandon all superfluities, all poring after vain
superfluous things, and thereby to exempt your selves from all unnecessary
cares that choke the Word, and be at liberty to consider, and to apply your
selves freely to the continual contemplation of the infinite love of God,
evidently and plainly set forth unto you in his blessed word: as in the words
that I have read unyou: for as it is in natural things, so holds it in
spiritual: God has dealt abundantly well with us; there being nothing that is
necessary either for the enlightening of our understandings, or the peace of our
minds, but what he has plainly declared and manifestly set forth in his
Word: so plainly, that the meanest capacity is fully capable of a right
understanding thereof, and need not to doubt but that he is so. I will not say
that God is not more good unto us, then we are hurtful to our selves, (for his
goodness is more availeable to our welfare, then our evil can be to our
misery) but we are as evil to our selves in all things as we can be possible:
and that not only in natural things, but likewise in spiritual and divine
things too, for therein also we have our inventions; the plain and evident
places of Scripture manifestly declaring our peace and reconciliation with God,
is become nauseous to us: they make salvation too easy to be understood, and
tender it upon too easy terms, and too general: this Manna that comes to us
without our labor, industry, study, and watching, is two fulsome, something
that has bones in it must be found out, and will become more acceptable:
every child or babe in Christ's School can understand these: We are full grown
men in Christ, we have spent our time in long and painful studies, and have
full knowledge in all Arts and sciences: there is no place of Scripture too
hard for us: show us the mysteries we cannot reveal: the Parables that we
cannot clearly open: the Prophesies that we cannot interpret: a word or
Syllable that we cannot fitly apply, or the most palpable seeming
contradiction that we cannot reconcile; nay it is to be doubted (we have seen
the vain humor of man puffed so high, and the world so filled and pestered with
works and labors of this vain nature) lest there are some such daring
undertakers, that like as Alexander the great is said to have wept that there
were no more worlds to conquer, so these Champions are grieved that there are
n^ harder places for their brains to work upon: or (which is more to be
lamented) one would fear^ they are much troubled that the most necessary truths
are so easy to be understood: for that when they treat upon some very plain
place of Scripture, even so plain as thi^ which I have read unto you, yet in
handling thereof they make it difficult, and darken the clear meaning thereof
with their forced and artificial glosses: but as I wish there were no such
dealers in divine things, so have I in my self resolved to avoid these
extreme evils: for as in natural things I am fully assured there is nothing
of necessary use but what is easily understood and even ready at hand, so also
does my experience tell me, that we have no bettering of our understandings, or
quieting of our minds (the end for which God has vouchsafed his word) from
any places of Scripture that has any obscurity in them, but from such as are
clearly exempt from all difficulty. You know God frequently complains by his
Prophets, saying, My people will not consider, they will not understand: and
when I consider that your own experience schools you not sufficiently against
your dotage upon the vain superfluities of this world, wherein you know your
selves to be carnal, and to walk as men, heaping unto your selves vexation
upon vexation; I do wonder that it does not stagger the Ministers of God in
their publishing of things divine to a people so qualified, so extremely
inconsiderate: indeed it would make one to suspect the doctrine that you
continually hear, that it were not powerful nor from heaven, but weak and
fitted to your corrupt humors, and customs, since after so long time, it has
not subdued your worldly mindedness. Sure I am, and I must have leave to tell
you, that there is utterly a fault amongst you, nay those expressions are too
soft, you have almost nothing but faults amongst you, and you will not
consider, which you must do, and seriously too, or you will never reduce your
selves into such a condition, as will be really suitable to the blessed name of
Christians. Beloved I have seriously considered it, and it is not your case
alone, but it is the universal disease. I know not any that is not infected
therewith, nor to whom it may not be said, Physician heal thy self; the milk
we have sucked, and the common air has been totally corrupted: our first
instructions, and all after discourses have been indulgent flatterers to our
darling superfluities: and therefore he that undertakes the cure, must be sure
to be provided of a fit and powerful medicine, and to be diligent and
faithful in his undertaking; it is a task that I have proposed unto my self,
and though I should meet with the greatest discouragements, (as, the world is
like enough to furnish his utmost forces to preserve his Kingdom) yet
considering whose service I have undertaken, and whose works it is, I shall not
despair of success. I am not ignorant that this work has oftentimes been
attempted, and persisted in: but with little fruit; through the universal
mistake, that men are sooner persuaded from their vanities, through pressures
of the law, and affrighting terrors of wrath and hell, then by the cords of
love: which yet I abundantly prefer, as you may perceive by this text which I
have chosen: for when all is done, It is the love of God bringing salvation,
that teaches us to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. I must entreat your
most carnest attention, as being full of hope that I shall do you much more
good then you conceive: for I must tell you, I cannot cure you of your earthly
mindedness, of your dotage upon superfluities, till I have first shown you
your peace and reconciliation with God, and have wrought in you (through the
power of Gods word) peace of conscience and joy in the holy Ghost. You are then
seriously to consider what is said, and understanding will succeed. The love of
God I know is often spoken of: a theme that has begotten abundance of books
and discourses: yet none in no comparison like the Scriptures: most (if not
all) discourses, that ever I have read or heard, do in some sense or other, or
in in some measure injure and wrong those blessed discourses thereof.

The love and favor of God (says David) is better then life it self; What
man in the whole world does not gladly hear the joyful tidings of the love of
God? But it is good that every man rightly understand, and mistake not himself
in this so blessed and delightful Subject. I shall lay down therefore some
infallible principles which concern the same. And I shall tell you nothing but
what your selves know: and that is, that God does most vehemently hate all
manner of sins, and that it is impossible for him to do otherwise, as being
directly opposite to his most righteous nature: and to that righteous nature
wherein at first man was created, for in the likeness of God created he him:
and whilst you consider this, I shall advise you not to flatter your selves as
the Pharisee did, saying, Lord I thank thee I am not as other men,
extortioners, unjust, adulterers, drunkards, covetous, proud, or licentious;
can you say you have noe sin? if you should, the word of God would contradict
you, which testifies that he that says he has no sin is a liar, and the
truth is not in him; and if sin be in every one, necessarily it follows
where sin is, there is Gods hatred; nor does it any whit excuse or exempt
those from the hatred of God, that can say their sins are few in number, and
of very mean condition compared to others: whosoever you are that are thus
indulgent to your selves, you do but deceive your selves, for Gods hatred, his
wrath and anger, is so exact against all and every sin, and so odious it is
in his sight, than he denounces, saying, Cursed is every one that continues
not to do all that is written in the book of the law: So as every mouth must
be stopped, and all the world stand guilty before God; and though the sense and
deep apprehension of this woeful condition, do work in you the deepest of
sorrow, though you should spend your days in weeping, and your nights in
woeful lamentation, though you should repent your selves in dust and ashes,
and cover your selves with sackcloathes: though you should fast yourselves into
palenesse, and hang down your heads always: though you should give all your
goods to the poor; nay, though you should offer up the fruit of your bodies,
for the sin of your souls; all this and more could be no satisfaction for
the least sin, nor bring any peace to your minds: but you must of force cry
out at last, as Saint Paul did, (stating this sad condition of all mankind
under the law) Ob wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body
of death! Justly is it called a body of death; for man is of a frail and weak
condition at the best: a considerate man has death always before him: What
joy or comfort then can he take all his life long; being in the hatred of God,
a vessel of wrath, and liable to eternal death in hell fire for ever? What
can he look upon that can give him content? Present a man that walks in the
sense of his sinful condition, with all the pleasures the world afford, and
his sad heart turns all into death; his conscience continually afflicts him;
terrors, and fears, and eternal torments are ever in his thoughts: and such
a wounded Spirit, who can bear? My beloved, I would not be mistaken in what I
have said of this woeful condition, as though I presented it to your thoughts,
as a means to terrify you from any your sinful courses: I know full well it
is not the way, it is not Gods way: nor do I wish this sad condition to be any
of yours: though happily it may be thus with many of you: many of you may
through sense of sin, and of wrath due for sin, walk in a very
disconsolate condition: fears and terrors may abound in you: to whom (I doubt
not) though great heaviness may endure for a night, yet greater joy shall come
in the morning: which as much as in me lies, I shall endeavor to produce in
every one of you.

I have presented this woeful condition of all mankind under the law, thus
sadly and truly, because I find generally men do not seriously consider the
bottomless depth of the misery from the which they are redeemed: I am not a
preacher of the law, but of the gospel; nor are you under the law, but under
grace: the law was given by Moses, whose minister I am not: but grace and truth
came by Jesus Christ, whose minister I am: whose exceeding love, has appeared:
and because I would have you fully to see and consider his love, therefore did
I show the woeful condition, from which only by his love you are delivered.

Another principle I shall pray you to consider, is that God loves nothing but
what is pure and holy, without spot or blemish: so as it is a vain and
delusive doctrine, to say that God passes by our daily infirmities, accepting
our wills for our performances: our desire to be obedient to his Commandments,
for obedience: for where there is the least defect, God hates for that very
defect, and loves not but where there is perfect holiness and righteousness:
which makes this truth appear, that by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be
justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. It is a sad
favor that the law ever did unto mankind, to make his sin appear out of
measure sinful, stopping every man's mouth, admitting no plea or excuse on man's
behalf; And yet it is so natural to think that he is still bound to do
something for obtaining the love and favor of God, that you will find it is
the hardest thing in the world to free your selves from it, though it be the
grossest Antichristian error that ever was; for if righteousness come by the
law, then Christ died in vain; It it such an error that until it be removed
out of your minds, it will be but labor lost to endeavor to work any truth
upon your minds; and I have much cause, to fear your minds are tainted
therewith, because our public catechismes, books, and Sermons are for the
most part corrupted therewith, so as we suck this error in even with our very
milk, and it becomes one substance with many of us even to our old age; It was
so in the Apostles times, as may be seen in Acts the 15, from the 5. verse to
the end of the chapter, where you shall find that some that believed affirm^^
that it was necessary to circumcise, and to keep the law: but you will find
by the story it was their error; Also in the second to the Corinthians, the
third to the end, where you shall find the law styled the ministration of
death, written in tables of stone (which was the 10 Commandments) and verse
the 11. to be done away, and a more glorious ministration to take place and
remain: and yet the breeding of the Jews being under the law, (though they
did believe the coming of Christ) yet still (even to that day the Apostle
wrote) their minds were blinded, and the veil remained at the reading of the
old Testament, which veil is done away in Christ. These things (beloved) you
are to consider seriously, for that until you do undoubtedly see your selves
not to be under the law, no not in the least respect, you cannot see your
selves to be under grace: that is, in the favor and love of God, until when
you cannot with sound judgment affirm, that which my text affirms, that is,
that the love of God has appeared: for he that in any measure conceives
himself to be under the law, does not clearly discern the love of god: for
that veil is before his eyes; you all give credit to the word of God: let S.
Paul then be your guide to lead you out of this sad Egyptian bondage who knew
all things that concerned the law, yet cries out, I account all things as loss
and dung, that I may be found in Christ, not having my own (or man's)
righteousness, which is of the law, but the righteousness which is of God in
him: make it your own cases by sound consideration, for ye are all justified
freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: your
fears, nor sins, nor doubtings, cannot alter that condition which Christ
has purchased for you, for though the sting of death be sin, and the
strength of sin be the law, yet thanks be unto God, for he has given us the
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ: so as you may all boldly say, Oh death
where is thy sting, O grave where is thy victory? And that none of you may
doubt of his exceeding love, and your perfect reconciliation with God, I will
read unto you certain passages (in the 5 chapter, to the Romans,) which if
well weighed, will leave you without all scruple, (verse,6) When we were yet
without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly: you see there that
ungodliness did not hinder, but that Christ died for thee that art ungodly:
do thou stand amazed, and can not throwly believe? the Apostle grants that
to man's judgment it is incredible; for amongst men, scarcely for a righteous
man will one dye, yet peradventure for a good man one would even dare to dye:
but to confirm thy timorous heart (verse 8.) God commends his love toward
us, in that whilst we were yet sinners Christ died for us, ( v. 9.) much more
being then justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him, (
v. 10.) for if when we were enemies, we were reconciled by the death of his
Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life: so as now
thou have cause to joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom thou have
received the atonement: and to take from thee all staggering (in the 18. v.) he
confirms thee, saying, As by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men
to condemnation: even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon
all men to justification of life: and (in ^he 20. verse.) because he knew thy
pronenesse to make questions still about the Law, he tells thee the Law entered
that sin might abound, but withal assures thee, that where sin abounded,
grace (or love) did much more abound: that as sin had reigned unto death,
even so grace (or love) might reign through righteousness unto eternal life
through Christ our Lord.

(Beloved) God by the power of his Word has begotten so full assurance of these
things in me, as that thereby he has made me an able Minister of the New
Testament: not of the Letter, (or the Law) but of the Spirit: for the Letter
kills, but the Spirit (that is the Gospel) gives life. Nor do I see any
cause why any of you here present should so much as doubt your salvation; I am
a Minister of reconciliation, and am thereby bound to tell you (for woe is unto
me if I preach not the Gospel, as in the 2 Cor. 5. 19.) that God was in Christ
reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them:
and has committed unto us the Word of reconcilation; Now then we are
Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you to be
reconciled unto God; for he has made him to be sin for us, that knew no
sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him; so as (however
we may vainly conceive to our own prejudice) God considers us not as we see
our selves full of sin, full of iniquity, but as we should consider our
selves, agreeable to all these passages of his blessed Word, fully and
perfectly washed from all our sins by the blood of his Son (which every one
of us do believe, though we do not consider) and then with unspeakable joy we
shall see that we are reconciled to God by the death of his Son: that we are
justified freely by his grace: that for our lost righteousness of the Law, we
are made the righteousness of God In him: having peace of conscience and joy
in the holy Ghost, by whose word these blessed truths are declared unto us. Are
these things so indeed, does God accept me a poor miserable sinner, as
righteous in his sight, and freed from sin, from all sin? Hear still the
Word of God, he has borne our sins in his body on the tree, and it is the
blood of Christ that cleanses thee from all sin: he by his one oblation once
offered, has made a full, perfect, and sufficient satisfaction, and sacrifice
for the sins of the whole world; and if we sin, we have an Advocate with
the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our
sins; and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world. This
work of your redemption and reconciliation with God was perfected when Christ
died: and nothing shall be able to separate you from his love then purchased:
neither infidelity, nor impenitencie, nor unthankfulness, nor sin, nor any
thing whatsoever can make void his purchase: no, though with the Jews you
should deny the Lord that bought you: so powerful was his bloodshed ding, and
of so full value for discharging of all our debts, past, present, and to come;
so infinite is his goodness, so free is his love, and so abundantly happy is
our condition, though many of us have been too too ignorant thereof: and for
want of this knowledge many of us have walked very uncomfortably, spending our
time in fasting, weeping, and mourning; in praying, reading, and hearing, and
in performance of other duties, as you call them, and all to get Christ: our
fear distracts our judgments, that we consider not what the Scripture sets
forth unto us: if we did, we should see aparently that it sets forth salvation
wrought and perfected for ever: to whom does it manifest the same? to sinners,
to the ungodly, to all the world: a work perfected, depending on no condition,
no performance at all; What would people have to give peace to their minds?
you do wrong your selves through nice distinctions: the word of God is given
to declare these truths, and that he is our peace: the word of God you do
believe, and so cannot but be comforted, the only end for which it is
preserved unto you: that you might read, and know, and understand your blessed
condition: for faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God: and you
are to look for no other testimony: nor are you to doubt your selves: for
though your present comfort depends upon your believing this word, yet the
work of Christ depends not on your believing: and though you should not
believe, yet he is faithful and cannot deny himself to be your redeemer,
your peacemaker, your Savior. Men are not pleased except salvation be proved
to be very difficult to be obtained, it must still depend either on our
believing, or doing, or repenting, or self-denial, or Sabbath-keeping, or
something or other, or else man is not pleased: too easy? good God! that free
love should be suspected: that because it is easy to be had, we should put it
far from us; why, God knew full well thou were dead, he considered that thou
were but dust; suppose he had required any thing of thee, without which thou
should have no part in Christ, what a sad case had thou been in? go thy
ways, and with cheerfulness possess his infinite love, and declare unto thy
brethren what the Lord has done for all our souls; tell them that the love of
God bringing salvation has appeared, teaching us to deny all ungodliness, and
worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present
world. And I shall desire to know of all that hear me this day, whereof some
may happily be addicted to the corruptions of this world: for our times though
we call them times of light, yet do abound with gluttony, drunkenness, and
whoredom, usury, pride, oppression, and all kind of wickedness, such as is
not to be named amongst Christians, (what shall I say to these things? it will
be in vain for me to reprove you for them: for men never reform their vices,
till first their judgments be well informed, and then they kindly reform
themselves) I shall only demand whether the love of God does more appear unto
you now, then it has done formerly? surely it is impossible but you must be
sensible of his love, it is so full and absolute, so free and unexpecting love.
How is it possible you should hear and not consider? had it not been for this
unexpressible and unexampled love, you had been eternally wretched and
miserable, companions of Devils, and damned spirits in Hell for ever, where the
Worm never dies, and the fire never goes out; me thinks you should embrace
this love with open arms, and meditate thereupon day and night: it deserves
to be entertained with the greatest respect, and to be esteemed above ten
thousand lives: for (beloved) though it comes freely to you, and costs you
nothing, no not so much as a sigh or tear, yet if you read over the story of
our Saviors passion, and sufferings, you will find it was purchased at an
excessive price, excessive pains, and excessive torments: nay it is even past
wonder that he that thought it no robbery to be equal to God, should be in the
form of a servant, and become obedient to death, even the most bitter death of
the Cross for our sins: that he should be made sin for us that knew no
sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him; me thinks these
and the like considerations should be powerful in your minds, that your
spirits should even burn within you, until you found out some way to express
your thankfulness for so great, so infinite love. I cannot suspect the most
vicious man in the world, but that hearing these things his heart will make
strict enquiry, what he shall render unto the Lord for all his benefits? and
his heart once moving in thoughts of thankfulness will instantly be inflamed
with love, which in an instant refines the whole man. God is love, and love
makes man God-like; and henceforth let me pray you to mark the workings of
love in your own souls, and you shall find that when your long accustomed
corruptions (by which you have wounded your own consciences, and brought
dishonor to God, and reproach to the holy name of Christians) do tempt to the
like abominable actions, your love to God that so freely has loved you, will
be so prevalent with you, that you will resolve rather to lose your lives then
to show your selves so basely ungrateful: the vanities you have delighted in
will become odious unto you: all your labor will be that your conversation be
as becomes the Gospel of Christ, nay you will shun the very appearance of
evil: and if your brother offend you in any kind whatsoever, you will find
no difficulty to forgive; if you do, do but think of the love wherewith
Christ has loved you, and nothing can be imagined so abominably injurious but
you will gladly forgive. And if you have this worlds goods, and that brother
lack, you will rejoice that you have an occasion and means to make known unto
the world how powerfully the love of God dwells in you: you will be able to
do all things through love that strengthens you. Love will be as a new light
in your understandings by which you will judge quite otherwise of all things,
then formerly you haved on: the vanities and superfluities which in the
beginning of my discourse I reckoned up unto you, will seem odious unto you,
and you will no longer fashion your selves like unto this world, but will walk
as becomes the Gospel of Christ: you will no longer mind high things, but
make your selves equal to men of low degree: you will no longer value men and
women according to their wealth, or outward shows, but according to their
virtue, and as the love of God appears in them: nay if you be studious in
this work of love, nothing will be more dear unto you then the glory of God
(who has so infinitely loved you) so as you will be most zealously opposite to
whatsoever is opposite unto God, you will sinde it nothing to hazard your
lives for God, in defense of his truth from error; in defense of your brother
or neighbor from oppression or tyranny: love makes you no longer your own but
Gods servants, and prompts you to do his will in the punishment of all kind
of exorbitances, whether it be breach of oaths, breach of trust, or any kind
of injustice in whomsoever, and to be no respecter of persons; nor will any
ones greatness over-sway or daunt your resolutions, but you will be bold as
Lions, not fearing the faces of men: you will when need requires, that is,
when tyrants and oppressors endeavor by might and force to pervert all Laws,
and compacts amongst men, and to pervert the truth of God into a lie,
interpreting his sacred word as patron of their unjust power, as if any unjust
power were of God, and were not to be resisted: I say, such insolences as
these will inflame your zeal, and set you all on fire manfully to fight the
Lords battle, and to bring into subjection those abominable imaginations and
ungodly courses of men: your judgments will be so well informed, as you will
know these things are by God referred unto you, and you will not resign them
up to him, but willingly sacrifice your lives and fortunes, and all that is
near and dear unto you, rather then suffer his name to be so blasphemed, or
your innocent brethren, or your wives and children to become a prey to wicked
and bloodthirsty men. The politicians of this world would have religious men
to be fools, not to resist, no by no means, lest you receive damnation:
urging Gods holy Word, whilst they proceed in their damnable courses; but
(beloved) they will find that true Christians are of all men the most valiant
defenders of the just liberties of their Country, and the most zealous
preservers of true Religion: vindicating the truths of God with their lives,
against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men: making thereby the whole
world to know that true Christianity hates and abhorres tyranny, oppression,
perjury, cruelty, deceit, and all kind of filthiness; and true Christians to
be the most impartial, and most severe punishers thereof, and of all kind of
wickedness, of any men whatsoever.

Great is the power of love, for love makes men to be of one mind: and what
can be too strong for men united in love? and therefore I shall warn you to
mark and consider those that make divisions amongst you. I pray mistake me
not, I doubt you are too apt in this case to make a wrong application: I do
not mean that you should mark those, that are different from you in
judgment, with any ridiculous or reproachful names: but my advice is that you
mark those that make divisions amongst you, and those are they that have
invented a name of reproach for every particular difference in judgment: and
in their public Sermons and private discourses, endeavor might and maine to
keep at the widest distance, and by odious tales and false imputations make you
irreconciliable: nay make you even ready to cut one another throats; or by
this division prepare you for your common adversaries to cut both yours and
theirs too; difference in judgment there will be, until love have a more
powerful working in our hearts: we should therefore like wise men at least
bear with one another infirmities: love will cover all that can be called
infirmity; but resolved malice love it self will punish. Such opinions as are
not destructive to humane society, nor blaspheme the work of our Redemption,
may be peaceably endured, and considered in love: and in case of conspiracy
against our common liberty, what a madness is it for men to stand in strife
about petty opinions? for who are all those that are so much railed at by our
common Preachers? who are they say they? why, they are the most dangerous
Anabaptists, Brownists, and Separatists: that are enemies to all order and
decency, that cry down all learning and all government in the Church, or
Commonwealth. (Beloved) to my knowledge these things are not true of any of
them: it is true, they cannot do al things so orderly and decently as they
would, because they are hunted into corners, and from one corner to another,
and are not free to exercise their consciences, as had they liberty they might,
and would; And as for learning, as learning goes now adays, what can any
judicious man make of it, but as an Art to deceive and abuse the understandings
of men, and to mislead them to their ruin? if it be not so, whence comes it
that the Universities, and University men throughout the Kingdom in great
numbers are opposers of the welfare of the Commonwealth, and are pleaders for
absurdities in government, arguers for tyranny, and corrupt the judgments of
their neighbors? no man can be so simple as to imagine that they conceive it
not lawful, or not useful for men to understand the Hebrew, Greek, or
Latin: but withal, if they conceive there is no more matter in one language
then another, nor no cause why men should be so proud for understanding of
languages, as therefore to challenge to themselves the sole dealing in all
spiritual matters; who (I say) can blame them for this judgment? they desire
that a man's ability of judgment should be proved by the clear expression of
necessary truths, rather then by learning: and since the Scriptures are now in
English, which at first were in Hebrew, Greek, or Syriack, or what other
language; why may not one that understands English only, both understand and
d^clare the true meaning of them as well as an English Hebrician, or Grecian,
or Roman whatsoever? I, but says some politic learned man, a man that does
not understand the Original language, cannot so perfectly give the sense of
the Scripture, as he that does: or as one that makes it his study for ten or
twenty years together, and has no other employment: every man being best
skilled in his own profession wherein he has been bred and accustomed. I did
well to say some politic learned man might thus object: for indeed what is
here but policy? for if it be as such men would imply, I pray what are you the
better for having the Scripture in your own language: when it was locked up in
the Latin tongue by the policy of Rome, you might have had a learned Friar
for your money at any time to have interpreted the same: and though now you
have it in your own language, you are taught not to trust your own
understanding, (have a care of your purses) you must have an University man to
interpret the English, or you are in as bad a case as before but not in worse;
for, for your money you may have plenty at your service, and to interpret as
best shall please your fancy. Let me prevail with you to free your selves
from this bondage, and to trust to your own considerations in any thing that is
useful for your understandings and consciences: and judge more charitably of
your brethren, and understand what learning is, and to mark those that cause
divisions among you, and you shall find that they are learned men, and not
unlearned. The learned man must live upon the unlearned, and therefore when the
unlearned shall presume to know as much as the learned, has not the learned man
cause to bestir his wits, and towrangle too when his Copyhold is in such
danger? I pray what was the cause that Demetr. and the Craftsmen cried out,
great is Diana of the Ephesians, whom al Asia and the world worship? was it the
love to the goddess or her worship? no, we find it was their covetousness and
particular gain? What is it else to cry out, great is learning, great are the
Universities, who shall answer an adversary? (money answers all things)
ambition, covetousness, disdain, pride, and luxury are the things aimed at:
and if it be not so, by the fruits you shall certainly know. As for
government, those that are accused are not guilty, for they are enemies only
to usurpations, and innovations, and exorbitances in government: indeed they
are haters of tyranny, and all arbitrary power, but no other: and therefore
those that falsely accuse them, are they that cause and foment divisions
amongst you: therefore mark them, and be not deceived by their dissembled
insinuations to hold you in division, whilst they have opportunity to make a
prey of you. You know there are Wolves in Sheep clothing: be wise as
Serpents, able to discover them, innocent as Doves, gently bearing with the
infirmities of the weak, having nothing in more esteem then love: thus you
will answer love with love: that henceforwards your own soul^s may constantly
witness to your selves (what this Scripture expresses) That the love of God
bringing salvation to all men has appeared, teaching you to live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world: Now unto him that has loved us,
and washed away ous sins in his own blood, be praise and glory for ever,

Amen.
FINIS.
