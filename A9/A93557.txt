^ FOR Homer's Birth Seven Cities. did contend,
^ and yearly Incence to the Skies did send;
^ This Day St. James's gave Great JAMES His Birth,
^ and made St. Martin's Empress of the Earth.
^ St. Martin's Englands Atlas, that does bear the Globe of Ma -- je-sty still
shining there;
^ The Globe of Ma -- jesty still shinin^ ^here,
St. James's and White Hall, the Ascendant Sphere.
CHORUS.
^ Then in spite of So-bri-e-ty, Fever, or Gout,
^ like the Thames our full Glasses shall flow from the Main.
^ Though the Bottles be out,
^ set the Bumpers about,
^ a return of the Ocean supplies 'em again.
^ Though the Bottles be out,
^ set the Bumpers a -- bout,
^ a return of the Ocean sup -- plies 'em a -- gain.
II.
Saint Martin's over the Royal City Crowned
The Capital, where CAESAR sits Enthroan'd.
Of Princely Babes, the spacious Nursery,
The Canopy, and Chair of Monarchy.
Above thy Sisters blessed in this alone,
Thou do support the Scepter and the Crown
Thou do support the Scepter and the Crown,
The Milky-way to Joves Emperial Throne.
Then, etc.
III.
Thy Neighboring Orbs Their Stars have, but in Thee;
Almighty Jove has placed His Gallaxy.
Illustrious Lights in their bright Regions shine,
But Heaven has fixed the brightest Lamp in Thine,
Let wandering Meteors from the Duty, fall,
Whilst We, fixed in a Loyal Sphere, Install,
Whilst We, fixed in a Loyal Sphere, Install
This happy day a lasting Festival.
Then, etc.
