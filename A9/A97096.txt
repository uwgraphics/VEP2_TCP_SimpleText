THE Compassionate SAMARITANE Unbinding

The Conscience, and pouring Oil into the wounds which have been made upon the
Separation: recommending their future welfare to the serious thoughts, and
careful endeavors of all who love the peace and unity of Commonwealths men,
or desire the unanimous prosecution of the Common Enemy, or who follow our
Saviors rule, to do unto others, what they would have others do unto them.

The Second Edition, corrected, and enlarged. Printed in the Year 1644.

Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur.

To him that reads.

IF after this, when all the guiles,
That have misled you, and the wiles
Are manifested clear as day,
So that you must say, these are they:
You yet will be befoold, you may.
Errors have some excuse, when their not known,
But being known once, wilfulness has none.
TO THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND.
TO You whom the Peolpe have chosen for the managing of their affairs, I
present this necessary Treatise without boldness and without fear: for I am
well assured, that as it is mine, and every man's duty, to to furnish You with
what we conceive will advance the Common good, or bring ease or comfort to any
sort of men that deserve well of their Country (as You cannot but know the
Separation do, if You consider with what charge and hazard, with what
willingness and activity they have furthered the Reformation so happily begun)
so likewise it is, Your duty, to hear and put in execution, whatsoever to Your
judgments shall appear conducing to those good ends and purposes. I recommend
here to Your view the oppressed Conscience, and the despised Separation: They
have been much wounded (I believe every body can say by whom) and the people
have passed by without compassion or regard, though they themselves must
necessarily partake in their sufferings There are none left, to play the good
Samaritanes part but Your selves, who as You have power; will, (I make no
question) be willing too, when You have once well considered the matter, which
this small Treatise will put You in mind to do. It is not to be supposed, that
You (who have so long spent Your time in recovering the Common Liberties of
England, should in Conclusion turn the Common into Particular; let the
insinuations and suggestions of some in the Synod, be what they will, I make no
question, but You will see both through and beyond them; and will never be
swayed from a good conscience to maintain particular men's Interests.

In the beginning of Your Session, when our Divines (as they would have us call
them) wrote freely against the Bishops, and the Bishops made complaint to You
for redress; some of You made answer, that there was no remedy, forasmuch as
the Press was to be open and free for all in time of Parliament: I shall make
bold as a Common of England to lay claim to that privilege, being assured
that I write nothing scandalous, or dangerous to the State, (which is justly
and upon good grounds prohibited by Your Ordinance to that effect) only I
humbly desire You to consider whether more was not got from You by that
Ordinance then You intended, and that though it was purposed by You to restrain
the venting and dispersing of the Kings writings and his Agents, yet it has by
reason of the qualifications of the Licensers wrought a wrong way, and stopped
the mouths of good men, who must either not write at all, or no more then is
suitable to the judgments and interests of the Licencers. The Separation (I
guess) would have took it for be^ter dealing, if the Divines had in express
terms obtained of You an Ordinance for suppression of all Anabaptisticall,
Brownisticall, or Independent writings; ^ent^ have their mouths stopped
subtlely, so insensibly, and their just Liberty in time of Parliament taken
from them unawares. There can be no greater Argument, that the Divines intend
not well, than their taking uncough, and mysterious, subtle ways to effect
their ends; even such as far better become Politicians, then Ministers.

It is high time O Commons of England, to put an End to the sufferings of the
Separation, who have for many years been the object of all kind of tyranny,
Papisticall, Prelaticall, and Regal: The first Foundation of honor, and
respect was certainly from public service and protection of the distressed:
Make it Your work, and assure Your selves, You will find not only the
universal love of all good men accompaning You, but a quiet and cheerful
Conscience, which is above all honor and riches, Others may weary themselves
in plots and contrivances to advance selfe-ends and interests, to the peoples
damage and molestations; sadness and distraction will be their companions for
it. But make it Your business, Ye chosen men of England according to the trust
rep^sed in You to protect, he Innocent, to judge their cause impartially, to
circunmvent men in their wicked endeavors; and so You will become the beloved
of God, the beloved of good men.

LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE ASSERTED, And the Separatist vindicated.
HAving heretofore met with an Apologeticall Narration of Thomas Goodwin,
Philip Nigh, Sydrach Sympson, Jeremy Buroughs, William Bridge; I did with
gladness of heart undertake the reading thereof, expecting therein to find
such general reasons for justification of themselves, to the world, as would
have justified all the Separation, and so have removed by one discourse those
prejudices and misapprehensions, which even good men have of that harmless and
well meaning sort of people: But finding contrary to that expectation that
their Apology therein for them selves and their Toleration was grounded rather
upon a Remonstrance of the nearness between them and the Presbyterian, being
one in Doctrine with them, and very little differing from them in Discipline,
how they had been tolerated by other Presbyter Churches, and indulgd with
greater privileges, then the Separatist, how they differed from the
Separatist, and had cautiously avoided those roks and shelves against which the
Separatist had split themselves, confirming by these words, the peoples
disesteem of Separatists, suggesting by that phrase of theirs, as if there were
amongst the Separatists some dangerous bypathes or opinions, which they warily
shund, though no mention be made what they are, which is the worst sort of
calumny.

Finding to my hearts grief the Seperatist thus left in the lurch, and likely
to be exposed to greater dangers then ever by the endeavors of these men, my
heart abounded with grief, knowing the Innocence of their intentions, and
honesty of their lives, that they are necessarily enforced to be of the mind
they are, upon long examination of their own tenants that they desire nothing
more then that they should be publicly and impartially reasoned, knowing
likewise their affection to the Commonwealth, their forwardnes of assistance
in purse and person, knowing eheir Meetings to be so iunocent, so far from
confederacy or counterplots (though they are very sensible of the sad and
perplexed condition that they are in) that they have not yet so much as spoke
ought in their own defense, but trusting to the goodness of God, the equity
of the Parliament, the simplicity and and integrity of their own ways, do
quietly enjoy themselves and their worship, let what will be brewing against
them, being resolved like Hester to do their duties, and if in doing thereof
they perish, they perish: Me thinks every man is bound in conscience to speak
and do what he can in the behalf of such a harmless people as these: what
though you are no Separatist (as I my self am none) the love of God appears
most in doing good for others: that love which aims only at it self; those
endeavors which would procure liberty only to them selves, can at best be
called but self love and self respects: It Is common freedom every man ought
to aim at, which is every man's peculiar right so far as it is not prejudiall to
the Common: Now because little can be done in their behalf, unless Liberty of
Conscience be allowed for every man, or sort of men to worship God in that way,
and perform Christ's Ordinances in that manner as shall appear to them most
agreeable to Gods Word, and no man be punished or discountenanced by Authority
for his Opinion, unless it be dangerous to the State: I have endeavored in
this Discourse to make appear by the best reason I have, that every man ought
to have Liberty of Conscience of what Opinion soever, with the caution above
named: In doing whereof, I have upon occasion removed all prejudices that the
people have concerning the Separatist, and vindicated them from those false
aspertious that are usually cast upon them to make them odious; wherein, my
end, I make account, will evidently appear, to be the peace and union of all,
and to beget this judgment in the People and Parliament, that it is the
principal interest of the Commonwealth, that Authority should have equal
respect, and afford protection to all peaceable good men alike, notwithstanding
their difference of opinion, that all men may be encouraged to be
alikeserviceable thereunto; liberty of Conscience is to be allowed every man
for these following reasons

1. Reason. Because of what judgment soever a man is, he cannot choose but be of
that judgment, that is so evident in it self, that I suppose it will be
granted by all, whatsoever a man's reason does conclude to be true or false, to
be agreeabe or disagreabe to Gods Word, that same to that man is his opinion or
judgment, and so man is by hisown reason necessitated to be of that mind he
is, now where there is a necessity there ought to be no punishment, for
punishment is the recompense of voluntary actions, therefore no man ought to be
punished for his judgment.

Objection. But it will be Objected, That the Separatists are a rash, heady
People, and not so much concluded by their Reason, as their Fancy, that they
have their Enthusiasni as, and Revelations, which no body knows what to make
off, and that if they were a people that examined things rationally, the
Argument would hold good for them.

Ans. That I suppose this to be the Argument not of the present, but of loose
witted times before the Parliament, where some politic Bishop, or Dr. Ignorant
University man, or knave Poet would endeavor by such a suggestion to the
people to misguide their credulous hearts into hatred of those good men, who
they knew to be the constant enemies to their delusions: but let all men now
have other thoughts, and assure themselves that the Brownist and Anabaptist are
rational examiners of those things they hold for truth, mild discourseres,
and abe to give an account of what they they believe; they who are unsatisfied
in that particular, may, if they please to visit their private Congregations
which are open to all comers, have further satisfaction; perhaps here and
there amongst them may be a man that out of his zeal and earnestnes for that
which he esteems truth, may outrune his understanding, and show many
weaknesses in his discourse, I would the like frailty and inabilities were not
to be found in many of us; but if the slips and wanderings of a few, and those
the weakest, be an Argument sufficient to discountenance the Separation, and
work them out of the worlds favor, I pray God the same Argument may never be
made use of against us; amongst whom, many, and they not esteemed the weakest
neither, would give great advantages that way: In the mean time I wish with all
my heart we could all put on the spirit of meeknes, and rather endeavor to
rectify by argument and perswation one another infirmities, then upbraid the
owners of them with a visible rejoicing that such things are slipped from them to
their disadvantage.

One Custom they have amongst them which does make even the generality of them
able arguers in defense of their way, and that is either an use of objecting
against any thing delivered amongst them, or proposing any doubt, whereof any
desires to be resolved, which is done in a very orderly manner, by which means
the weakest becomes in a short time much improved, and every one able to give
an account of their Tenets, (not relying upon their Pastors, as most men in our
congregations do) which may serve to remove the objection, and put us to
consider, whether the like custom be not wanting amongst us.

2. Reas. The uncertainty of knowledge in this life: no man, nor no sort of men
can presume of an unerring spirit: It Is known that the Fathers, General
Counsels, National Assemblies, Synods, and Parliaments in their times have
been most glosly mistaken: and though the present times be wiser then the
former, being much freed from superstition, and taking a larger liberty to
themselves of examining all things, yet since there remains a possibility of
error, notwithstanding never so great presumptions of the contrary, one sort
of men are not to compel another, since this hazard is run thereby, that he
who is in an error, may be the constrainer of him who is in the truth.

Ob. But unity and uniformity in Religion is to be aimed at, and confusion
above all things to be avoided, by Toleration new Opinions will every day
break forth, and to the scandal of the Nation, we shall become a very monster
in matters of Religion, one part being Presbyter, another Anabaptist, Brownist
another, and a fourth an Independent, and so diverse according to the diversity
of opinions that are already, or may be broached hereafter.

Ans. I answer, that in truth this objection appears specious at the first
gloss, and therefore is very moving upon the people, which the Bishops well
knew, whose it was, and taken up as the fairest pretense for the suppression of
those, who it is to be feared, will prove the suppressors. For answer whereunto
I aver, that a compulsion is of all ways the most unlikely to beget unity of
mind, and uniformity in practice, which experience will make evident. For,

The Fines, Imprisonments, Pillories, etc. used by the Bishops as means to
unite, rather confirmed men in their judgments, and begot the abomination and
odium which these times have cast upon the Hierarchy, being in the worst kind
tyrannical, as endeavoring by the punishment of the person, the bowing and
subjecting of the Conscience. And if it be it instanced, that some there were
that turned with the wind, and were terrified by fear of punishment into a
compliance. I answer, that such men are so far from being examples to be
followed, that they may more justly be condemned for weather-cokes fit (to be
set up for men to know which way blows the wind) of favor delicacy, ease and
preferment.

Secondly, The conscience being subject only to reason (either that which is
indeed, or seems to him which hears it to beso) can only be convinced or
persuaded thereby, force makes it run back, and strugle; it is the nature of
every man to be of any judgment rather then his that forces. It Is to be
presumed, that it is upon some good grounds of reason that a man is of that
Judgment whereof he is. Would thou have him be of thine? show him thy
grounds, and let them both work, and see which will get the victory in his
understanding. Thus possibly he may change his mind, and be of one judgment
with thee: but if you will use Club Law, instead of convincing and uniting, you
arm men with prejudice against you, to conclude that you have no assurance of
truth in you, for then you would make use of that, and presume of the efficacy
thereof, and not fight with weapons which you (do or at least should) know not
to be the weapous of truth. But I fear there is something more in it: I cannot
think that the Bishops in their times used so many stratagems of vexation and
cruelty against good people, to gain them to be of their mind, they could not
be ignorant that they set the Nonconformists of all sorts thereby at an
irreconcilable hatred against them. No, there end rather was this, They had
consulted who were opposite to their designs, and finding the Puritan and
Sectary so to be, their interest was by all possible means to suppress them,
that so they might without opposition trample upon the people. And therefore in
these times men should consider what they do. For if they who have the
public countenance do bear them elves after the same manner toward the
Anabaptists and Brownists, or whatsoever other sect there is, or may be, that
cannot comply with them in judgment or practice (as by their beginnings we
fear they will) what can we judge of them but that their ends and intentions
are the same with the Bishops? For by their fruits (says our Savior) ye shall
know them: we may be deceived by words their turnings and contextures are so
insinite, that they may be framed so, as to make the worst seem good. The
actions of men are the best rules for others to judge them by. Now upon view of
the actions of the Divines that are now in favor, men do speak very
strangly, some say the tyranny over conscience that was exercised by the
Bishops, is like to be continued by the Presbiters: that the oppressors are
only changed, but the oppression not likly to be removed. Others say, that the
Anabaptist and Brownist are like to find harder masters, for that the Bishops
made the punishment of them a matter of sport and profit to themselves, and
reserved their punishments to be diversions of the peoples minds from taking
too much notice of their intrenchments upon the laws and common liberty,
suffering their societies notwithstanding to remain, though so low and
dejected that they were past fear of them. But the Presbiters, as it is
conceived, will be more violent, as slaves usually are when they become
masters: and thus talk not only the Anabaptist and Brownist and Antinomian
(being chiefly in danger) but other the most moderate and ingenious meu, that
are not swayed by the Divines interest.

They say too, that as it is not just, so neither is it politic, that in the
beginnings and first rise, when the Divines are but laying the foundation of
their greatness, wealth, and sway over the peoples consciences, and twisting
their interest insensibly with the Parliaments, that in the in fancy of their
tyranny they should carry themselves so high and presumptuous as they do over
other men, shows that their wisdom here comes somewhat short of the
Serpents, or else that they are so impatient at the not compliance of other
men, that they break, out even against their own interest. Nay some say
further, that they did well indeed in being so zealous against the Bishops,
those Drones and Caterpillars of the Commonwealth, in making deservedly odious
to the people their oppressive Courts? Fines, Censures, and Imprisonments. But
they begin to fear thatsome bad ends of their own were aimed at herein, and
not so much the liberty of the people, as that they might get up into the
Chair and become to them instead of a Lord Bishop, a ruling Presbytery, which
they fear will bring in more rigidnesse and austerity, no less ambition and
domination then the former.

And the reason they have to fear, is, because our Divines have not dealt
clearly with us in many particulars, but continue cert^ine interests of the
Bishops, which they find advantageous to advance their honor and esteem with
the people and have entered already into many of their steps, which in them at
first they did seem so much to abomin^te. That the interest only of the Bishop
in particular, and of that sort of Prelates is exploded; but the general
interests of the Clergy, whereby another Prelacy may be erected, and the
mystery of the Divines maintained in credit amongst the people, is still with
all art and industry preserved. I will take the pains both to tell you what
those general interests are, and what in reason may be said against them.

I. Their first interest is to preserve amongst the people the distinction
concerning Government of Ecclefiasticall and Civil, though upon consideration
it will be found that two Governments in one Commonwealth has ever been, and
will ever prove inconsistent with the peoples safety: The end of Government
being to promote virtue, restrain vice, and to maintain to each particular
his own, one sort of Government which we call the Civil, either is
sufficient, or by the wisdom of the Parliament may be made sufficient for
these ends. At the beginning of this Parliament it was confessed, that it was
both too burdensome for the Divines, and too bazardous for the State, that they
should be trusted with any thing of Government, their preaching and
instructing the people being, if well discharged, sufficient to take up the
whole man. But the times change, and the men with them; the design is
feasible, and it must now again be thought necessary that the Divines should
have a stroke in the Government, and therefore that distinction is again
maintained, which being taken up at first by proud Churchmen for ambitious
ends, is still continued for ends though not in every thing the same, yet
differing (I fear me) rather in the degrees than nature of them, we cannot
tell what else to think of it, but that finding our Divines aiming at
authority and jurisdiction, have judged it most politic to gain a
pre-eminence, (less stately and pompous, but) altogether as imperious and
awful over men as the former, which because it is not so garish outwardly as
the Bishops, they may presume will therefore be the easier admitted, and prove
of longer continuance.

II. The second interest of the Divine, is to preserve amongst the people the
distinction of Clergy and Laity, though not now in those terms, because they
have been unhappily discovered. The Scriptures so evidently making the people
Gods Clergy by way of distinction from the Ministers, 1 Pet. 5. 3. but never
the Ministers by way of distinction from the people. And then for Laity, a
people (as the word signifies) I hope the Ministers are such as well as any
others. Well, the distinction by words is not so material, as a real
distinction with their interest is to pres^^ve. They would not have us to
think that a Ministter comes to be so, as an other man comes to be so, as an
other man comes to be a Merchant, Bookeseller, Tailor, etc. either by disposal
of him by his friends in his education, or by his own making choice to be of
such a Trade: no, there must be something spiritual in the business, a Iure
Divino must be brought in, and a succession from the Apostles, and even as some
would have us think Kings to be anointed of God, because the Israelitish
Kings were by his command, so we are made to believe, that because the Apostles
were ordained by God to be Teachcers of the people, and endued with gifts for
that end; that therefore there is a like divine, though secret ordination from
God in making of our Ministers, and spiritual gifts and qualifications
thereunto: Because otherwise, if the people did not believe so, they would
examine all that was said, and not take things upon trust from the Ministers,
as if whatsoever they spoke, God spoke in them: they would then try all things,
and what they found to be truth, they would embrace as from God, for God is the
Author of truth; what they found to be otherwise, they would reject, and then
for the most part they might spare their nothings and repetions too, unless
the more to discover the groundlesnesse of the doctrine, and the giddiness of
the doctrine, and the giddiness of the Divinity which they generally hear.
They would then handle their Ministers familiarly, as they do one an other,
shaking off that timorousness and awe which they have of the Divines, with
which they are ignorantly brought up. He that bade us try all things, and hold
fast that which was good, did suppose that men have faculties and abilities
wherewithal to try all things, or else the counsel had been given in vain.
And therefore however the Minister may by reason of his continual exercise in
preaching, and discoursing, by his daily study, and reading, by his skill in
Arts and Languages, by the conceit of the esteem he has with a great part of
admiring people (in whom is truly fulfilled the prophecy of St. Paul, 2 Timothy
4. 3. 4.) presume it easy to possess us, that they are ^^re divine then other
men (as they style themselves) yet if the people would but take boldness to
themselves and not distrust their own understandings, they would soon find
that use and experience is the only difference, and that all necessary
knowledge is easy to be had, and by themselves acquirable: and that it is the
Ministers interest, their living depending thereupon, to frame long methods and
bodies of Divinity, full of doubts and disputes, which indeed are made of
purpose difficult to attain unto, that their hearers may be a lwyes learning,
and never come to the knowledge of the trnth, begetting disquiet and
unsetlednesse of mind, continual controversies, sadness, and many times
desperation: All which makes for them, for that upon all occafionsmen have
recourse to them for comfort and satisfaction, which how weak and short soever
it be in it self, must be current, because from them: the Keys of the Church
(a prerogative which our Savior gave to his Apostles,) they arrogate to
themselves, a new Authority they make mention of in their Sermons, which they
call Ministerial (though no such thing belongs to them, nor is yet settled upon
them, nor I hope ever will be) thus their interest is to make of themselves a
peculiar Tribe, of a nearer relation to God then other men: His more immediate
Servants the Laborers in his Vineyard, the Co-workers with him, and all other
titles they claim, given in Scripture to the Apostles, though neither for
their abilities, much less for their virtues or conversations, or in any other
respect can be due unto them.

III. The third interest is to persuade the people, that the Scriptures though
we have them in our own tongue, are not yet to be understood by us without
their help and interpretation, so that in effect we are in the same condition
with those we have so long pitied, that are forbid to have the Scripturs in
their own tongue: for it is all one not to have them in our own tongue, and to
be made believe, that we cannot understand them though we have them in our
own. Is the Cabinet open to us, and do we yet want a Key? has so much labor
been spent? so many Translations extant, and are we yet to seek? Let us argue
a little with them: either the Scriptures are not rightly Translated, or they
are: If they are not, why have we not been told so all this while? why have
we been cheated into errors? If they are rightly Translated, why should not
Englishmen understand them? The Idiomes and properties of the Hebrew, and
Greek Languages, which some say, cannot word for word be expressed in English,
might all this while have been Translated into as many English words as will
carry the sense thereof. There is nothing in the Hebrew or Greek but may be
expressed in English, though not just in so many words (which is not material)
so that it must be confessed, that either we have not been fairly dealt withal
hitherto in the conveyance of the Scripture, (a thing which few dare suspect)
or else the Scriptures are as well to be understood by us, as by any Linguist
whatsoever.

Well, notwithstanding all this how evident soever it be, a great part of us
people do believe just as they would have us, and therefore silly men (as we
are) in case of doubt to them we go to be resolved: and hereby is maintained
the necessity and excellency of learning, and the Languages, and so of
Universities, and a supposall that the arts likewise are of necessity to a
Divine: seven years at least are allotted for the attaining thereof, to fit
and dispose men for the study of Divinity, the Arts being, as they say,
handmaids and preparations to Theology. But I hear wise men suspect all this,
and say, that the Divines of what sort soever, have other ends in urging all
these things to be of necessity.

First, they have hereby made it a difficult thing to be a Minister, and so
have engrossed the trade to them selves, and left al other men by rcason of
their other professions in an incapacity of being such in their sense.

And therefore, Secondly, if any do take upon them their profession without
University breeding and skill in the Arts and Languages (how knowing a man so
ever he be otherwise) they have fastened such an odium in the hearts of most of
the people against him, that a theif or murderer cannot be more out of their
favor then he. Thirdly, they being furnished with these Arts and Languages,
have a mighty advantage over all such as have them not, and care admirers
thereof, (as most men are) so that hereby they become masters of all discourses,
and can presently stop the peoples mouths, that put them too hard. to-it, by
telling them that it is not for Laymen to be too confident, being no
scholars, and ignorant of the Original; That the Original has it otherwise
then our Translations: And thus they keep al in a mystery, that they only may
be the Oracles to dispense what, and how they please: so that this third
interest is of much concernment to them.

I know what the scruple of most men will be, in reading of this last particulars
almost all will be the Divines Advocate for Learning, and have him in great hate
and derision, that is an enemy thereto. For as Diana was, so is Learning those
Crafts-mens living and the peoples goddess. However, I will make no Apology
for my self, but desire, that every man would give his reason scope, boldly to
examine, what it is, what good the World receives from it, whether the most
learned, or unlearned men have been the troublers of the World. How
presumptfious and confident the learned Scribes, Priests, and Doctors of the
Law were, that they best understood the Scriptures: How the po^re unlearned
Fishermen and Tent-makers were made choice of for Christ's Disciples and
Apostles, before any of them: How in process of time they that took upon them
to be Ministers, when they had acquired to themselves the mystery of Arts and
Learning, and confounded thereby the clear streams of the Scripture, and
perver^ed the true Gospel of Jesus Christ, and by politic Glosses, and
Comments introduced an other Gospel suitable to the covetous, ambitious, and
persecuting spirit of the Clergy (which their esteem with the people made
authentic) they then began to scorn the simplicity and meanness of the
Apostles, to call that the Infancy of the Church, and to engrosse great
Livings, Lordships, Territories and Dominions; to embroyle States in wars, to
supplant one an other and divert the people from the prosecution of their own
interest, (which is their safety and liberty) to maintain their quarrels,
and erect that Government the then rising part of them could agree upon. So
that the Priests and Ministers of Christendom (though others have the name)
yet they are indeed the Lords and leaders thereof, as at present by Englands
sad experience may evidently appear: For I would have all wise men consider,
there the party who are now in arms to make us slaves, consists not chiefly of
such as have had esteem for the most learned Arts men in the Kingdom; or of
others, (who if not learned themselves) are admirers of such as are. Yea, to
examine whence most of the wars of Christendom have sprung, and whether
these artif^ciall Clergy men have not been the chief causers and still are
the grand Incendiaries of our present miseries which threaten our utter ruin,
and although the Epifcopall Clergy pretend to strive for the Regal
Prerogative on the one side, and the Presbiterian Prelacy for Reformation, and
the Liberty of the Subject on the other side; yet both of these mainely in^^^^
their own respective profits, and advancements; so that which s^de soever
prevail (if such may have their wills (both aiming at their own greatness and
Dominion over the consciences of their Brethren) extremest misery, and basest
kind of slavery will unavoydably follow; whilst each of them by all slye
insinuations and cunning contrivances seek to obtain authority to compel the
whole Nation to be subject to their doubtful, yea groundless determinations,
which of all other is the greatest and worst sort of oppression and tyranny.
The people may, if they please, dote upon that which ever has been, and will
be their destruction: It would be more safe for them (I am sure) to distinguish
of Knowledge, and to reject what is useless (as most of that which has
hitherto borne the name of learning, will upon impartial examination prove to
be) and esteem that only which is evidently useful to the people; to account
better of them that having no by-ends or respects, have studied the the
Scriptures for their own and others information, and do impart the same to
the people out of a desire of their good, for nothing, (as the Anabaptists do
to their Congregations) than of such men as use all means to augment their
tithes and profits, who being rich and abundantly provided for, yet exact them
from poor poople, even such whose very bellies can hardly spare it; whose
necessities ought to be releeved by them, and not the fruit of their labors
so unreasonably wrested from them, as often it is, and the same so superfluously
spent, or so covetously hoarded up, as for the most part is known to be. When
they commend Learning, it is not for Learnings sake, but their own; her
esteem gets them their Livings and preferments; and therefore she is to be
kept up, or their Trade will go down. Have a care therefore O ye Clergy,,
as you esteem your honor and preferment, your profit and observance, that you
keep this Diana of yours high in the peoples esteem: Rouse up your selves, and
imagine some new ways to quicken the admiration of this your Goddess; for I
can assure you, men's eyes begin to open, they find that she is not so
beautiful as she once seemed to be; that her luster is not natural, but
painted and artificial: Bestirre your selves, or your Diana will down. But
why should I excite you, who I know are too industrious in the preservation of
your own interests.

Diverse other interests they have plied, as to make themselves the only public
speakers, by which means whom, and what they please they openly condemn, cry
up, or cry down, what makes for or against themselves: There they brand men
with the name of Heretics, and fastren what errors they think are most
hateful to the people, upon those men they purpose to make odious: There they
confute all opinions, and boldly they may do it, for as much as no liberty of
reply or vindication in public is allowed to any, though never so much
scandalized by them. And that men may not vindicate themselves by writing,
their next interest is to be Masters of the Presle, of which they are lately
become by an Ordinance for licensing of Books, which being intended by the
Parliament for a good and necessary end (namely) the prohibition of all Books
dangerous or scandalous to the State, is become by means of the Licencers (who
are Divines and intend their own interest) most serviceable to themselves
scandalous Books being still dispersed) in the stopping of honest men's writings,
that nothing may come to the Worlds view but what they please, unlessc men will
run the hazard of imprisonment, (as I now do) so that in public they may
speak what they will, write what they will, they may abuse whom they will, and
nothing can be said against them: well may they presume of making themselves
Masters of the people having these foundations laid, and the people generally
willing to believe they are good. I might proceed, to show what usage wise men
expect from their Government, being once established how rigid and austere some
think they will prove, countenancing no recreations but what themselves are
addicted to: how covetous others deem them, observing that they have more
regard to the Benefice then the people, and do usually change and shift upon
proffer of a better Parsonage. Some say that they are a people sick of the
Pharisees disease, they love to sit upermost at feafts, and to be reverenced in
public places, that their respects toward men are as they are rich and
benef^ciall to them, and that a poor man can hardly obtain a visit, though at
the time when the world couceives there is greatest necessity of it: that
they'hover about dying men for their Fee, and hope of Legacy, and many other
things are commonly talked of them, which because I suspect to be true I will
set myself hereafter more narrowly to observe.

The Objection wereupon all this (I hope) necessary digression is built, was
that men may be compelled (though against conscience) to what the Synod or
present Ministry shall conclude to be good, and agreeable to Cods Word, because
unity and uniformity in the Church is to be endeavored. To which I further

Ans. Answer, That to sorce men against their mind and judgment, to belecive
what other men conclude to be true, would prove such tyranny as the wicked
P^oc^us^es (mentioned by Plutarch) practiced, who would fit all men to one Bed,
by stretching them out that were too short, and by cutting them shorter that
were too long. If we believe as the Synod would have us, what is this but to be
brought into their miserable condition that must believe as the Church
beleives, and so become, (as said an honest man, not the Disciples of Christ,
but of the Synod?

3. Reas. The third Reason for Liberty of Conscience is grounded upon these
foundations, that whatsoever is not of faith is sin, and that every man ought
to be fully persuaded of the trueness of that way wherein he servcth the Lord:
upon which grounds I thus argue, To compel me against my conscience, is to
compel me against what I believe to be true, and so against my faith; now
whatsoever is not of faith is sin; To compel me therefore against my
conscience, is to compel me to do that which is sinful: for though the thing
may be in it self good, yet if it do not appear to be be so to my
conscience, the practice thereof in me is sinful, which therefore I ought not
to be compelled unto.

Again I am counseled by the Apostle to be persuaded in my own mind of the
truth of that way wherein I serve the Lord; I am not therefore to be compelled
to worship God in such a way, of the justness whereof I am not yet persuaded,
much less in such a way as is against my mind.

Ob. Nothing is more dangerous to a State, espeacially in these times, than
division and disturbance by several ways of Brethren which have increased our
miseries, and therefore to avoyde division they who will not of their own
accords comply, are for the quiet of the state to be compelled and punished.

Ans. I Answer, that it is verily thought that the harshnesse only of this
proposition hinders that it is not yet put in execution, till time and cunning
have fitted it for the people; for we are told in the last consideration
tending to diswade from further gathering of Churches, that suffering is like
to be the portion of such as shall judge the right rule not to be delivered to
them. A man would think that those people that so lately were the sufferers,
the noise of whose exclamations against such courses, is scarce yet ont of the
peoples ears, that they should not so soon think of being the Tyrants. But
to the Objection I answer, that the diversity of men's judgments is not the
occasion of division, because the word division has reference to falling off
from the Common cause. Now, though the provocations and incitements, against
the Brownists, and Anabaptists and some of the Independents have been many,
yet their affections to the Public weal are so hearty in them, and grounded
upon such sound principles of reason, that no assay of the Synod can make them
cease to love and assist their Country; and it is more then evident by the
prosperity of our neighbors in Holland, that the several ways of our
brethren in matters of Religion hinder not, but that they may live peaceably
one amongst an other, and the Spaniard will witness for them that they unite
sufficiently in the defense of their common liberties and opposition of their
common enemies: Besides, its very material to consider, that it has ever been
the practice of those that are countenanced by Authority to endeavor the
suppression of those that are not: who is therefore in the fault? the quiet
Separatist, who being persuaded in his conscience of the truth of that way he
desires to serve the Lord in, peeceably goes on to do his duty as he thinks
himself bound to do, or they who out of a lordly disposition care not what
injury they do to others, though to the hazard of the Commonwealth, to
advance themselves and their government, they defame the Separation in their
writings and Sermons, bid their poselites beware of them, as of a dangerous and
factious people, stop their mouths, keep the Press fom them, provoake them
by all ways possible, and then like the crafty Politian cry out upon them as
the causers of division.

I hear some men say, that it concerns the Minister so to do, because his
living (depending upon his tithes and gifts) is the greater, the more rich and
numerous his audience is; and therefore the Separa ists are not to be suffered,
who they find by experience draw many people after them, and though not the
devout honorable women, nor the chief men of the City, yet many whose number
might much increase the yearly revennue of the Minister, and therefore you must
think it has concerned them to meet together, and to say amongst themselves,

Sirs, you know that by this our craft we have our wealth: moreover ye se and
hear, that not alone at London, but in most parts of the Kingdom these
Separatists have persuaded and turned away much peo ple, saying that our
Ministry is no true Ministry, our Church, no true Church, our Doctrine in many
things erroneous, that our succession from the Apostles is but a pretended
thing, and as we our selves do derive it descended for many 100. years through
the detestable Papacy and mish Ministry, so that if these men be suffered our
gain, and the magnificence of the Ministry, which not England only, but all
Christendom does highly magnificence of the Ministry, which not England only,
but all Christendom does highly magnify and reverence, would quickly down:

For what other reason then this can be imagined, why the Separati on should
be the eyesore of our Ministers? It cannot be instanced in one particular
whereby the Commonwealth receives prejudice from them: And then for the charge
of Separating, for their maknig a Scisme, which is endeavored, to be cast so
heavily upon them:

I answer, That by reason of the Church of Romes corruptions, the Church of
England did long since make a Scisme from the Church of Rome, for which cause
likewise many of the present Ministers in lieve of the Antichristian
domineering Bishops thought it no robbery to make scisme from England; and even
this Idolizing Synod, which though not yet upon her Throne, sticks not to let
her clients see she says in her heart; Behold I s^t a queen, I am no widow,
and shall see no sorrow, Rev. 18. 7. May not I say this, Reverend Synod: if to
be proceeded against by such carnal sandy principles, such humane ordinances,
by which the Separatists stand prejudiced, be legally found, to have made the
greatest and most transcendent scisme which England ever knew or heard of,
since the Papistrie was discarded; If then the Separation have gone a little
further, and not only with the Bishops separated from Rome, with the Ministers
from the Bishops, but by reason of some corruptions still remaining among the
Ministers, are by their consciences necssitated to separate from them likewise:
In all these separations there was difference in judgment; the Bishops differ
in some things from Rome, our Ministers from the Bishops, and amongst
themselves too, which differecnes by the Scriptures they cannot determine, as
appears both by their writings and preachings, wherein with nuch vehemence
they urge the same against other; of little force then will the major vote of a
Synod be for the determining thereof, having so lately most notoriously
discovered themselves to be men-pleasers and temporisers, by crying down the
things which but yesterday they so highly magnified in their Pulpits, and also
practiced with much devotion (at least seemingly) and having withal their own
interests so much concerned therein (as is before in Part declared.) And
further, knowing that the same persons themselves, and their Tenets, (as well
as the opinions of Independents, Brownists, and Anababtists, whom they oppose)
do stand condemned not by the major vote of diverse Synods only, but by many
general Counsels also, (who are accounted to represent the whole Church upon
Earth) no whit inferior to them either in Arts or Learning, or any other
qualification: Let it be then no wonder, nor so much as seem blameable
hereafter, that the Separatists should differ in some Opinions from this
present Synod, since the Ministers therein no little differ amongst them
selves, much more than ye^ appears, and will do so, while Sun and Moon endures
until we have courage and strength enough to abandon all private interests and
advantages.

All times have produced men of several ways, and I believe no man thinks
there will be an agreement of judgment as long as this World lasts: If ever
there be, in all probability it must proceed from the power and efficacy of
Truth, not from constraint.

Objection. An Assembly of Divines, men that have employed all their time in
the study of Religion, are more likely to find out the truth, then other men,
that have not so spent their time; who being now consulting, what Doctrines,
and what Discipline is most agreeable to the Word of God, it is but meet that
all men should wait their leisure, till it be manifest what they shall produce.

Answ. To this objection I say first, That they being now in consultation, not
for themselves, but as they say, for the whole people; it is but reasonable
that they should publish to the world whatsoever is in debate amongst them, and
invite every man to give them their best light and information, that so they
may hear all voices, and not conclude ought against men's judgments before it
be heard what they can say for themselves: This might peradventure be a means
to find out all truth, and settle things so as that every man might be
satisfied. You will say, that they consider of all objections amongst
themselves. I reply, that is not sufficient, for it is a known case men are
generally partial to themselves and their own judgments, urging the weakest
objections, and that but slightly: and it can give no satisfaction to men to
have their causes pleaded by their Adversaries.

Secondly, how palpable soever it appear, that an Assembly of Divines are more
likely to find out truth then other men; yet it is to be considered, that it
will puzzle any man to instance when they did so. Besides, grant it be more
probable, yet it may be otherwise, and it is well known has proved so. The
Liturgy was by universal consent approved, and by the Parliaments Authority
authorized, particular men being for these many years averse to it, and
separating from the public Congregations because of it: it now appears who
were in the right. How confident soever therefore the Divines (as they style
them selves) are that they shall find out the right rule; yet since it may be,
and hitherto has been otherwise, it is but meet that they should decree only
for themselves and such as are of their own mind, and allow Christian Liberty
to all their Brethren to follow that way which shall seem to them most agreeable
to truth.

Ob. But we are told in the Divines Considerations that all men must wait,
otherwise the Parliament are like to be provoaked.

Answ. J marry Sir, this is a good strongue Argument, and speaks home to us: I
cannot blame the Separatists now for crying out, they fear your Club more then
your Reason. I see what they might expect, if the sword and authority were in
your hand, your nine Considerations informs me, wherein are these two
suppositions. First, that the right rule may not be delivered us: And secondly,
that then men may be called to s^ffer. It is a wonder to observe the wrethed
condition of man, and his foul ingratitude: Is it so long since the yoakes
were broaken off these men's necks, that they forget the burden and injustice
of them, or that assistance they had from their separatist Brethren in breaking
those yoakes, that now so soon as they are got into reputation, they should
suppose a time of suffering for their brethren for doing what to them appears
to be their duty! Regard O God, since man is become thus forgetful, take thy
distressed Servants, the Separatists into thine own pr^tection: Thou O Lord,
that art the Judge of all the Earth, put into the hearts of the Parliament to
do right in this cause, and to suffer those afflicted people no longer to
endure reproach or molestation for doing of their duties.

Ob. But some may I beat the Air all this while, there is no purpose in the
Divines to force the conscience, they are sufficienily informed that, the
conscience cannot be forced, being in no wise snbject to compulsion, only it
concerues them they say to prevent the grouth and increase of errors, which
cannot otherwise be done but by punishing those that are the authors and
maintainers of them, that so truth only may flourish, and the Gospel with the
Ordinances according to the true institution of them, be maintained and
practiced by all the people of the Nation.

Answ. I answer, that though it were certain that what they esteem truth were
so indeed, and that the true Gospel and Ordinances were in every part and
circumstance of them that which they judge them to be: however, though they are
earnestly to endeavor by argument and perswation to reduce all men to the same
beleife^ and practice with themselves, yet those that cannot be thereunto
periwaded, they ought not by any means to punish, for the first and third
Reasons before given. But then for the assurance of the Divines that their
conclusions and Articles are certainly true, if it be built upon certain
foundations, they need not avoyde the combat with any sort of men of what
opinion soever: Truth was uot used to fear, or to seek shifts or stratagems
for its advancement! I should rather think that they who are assured of her
should desire that all men's mouths should be open, that so error may discover
its foulnes and truth become more glorious by a victorious conquest after a
fight in open field; they shun the battle that doubt their strenght. Wise
men are at a stand to see that whilst the Press was open no man undertook
the Anabaptists, and that now their adversaries have bound their hands they
begin to buffet them; what can they do else but necessarily ssupect that our
Divines have not the truth, nor by any evidence thereof are able to make good
their own standings or practices. To stop men's mouths or punish men for
speaking their minds, was profitable indeed, and necessary for the Bishopes
who had proposed to themselves such ends as could endure no discourse upon
them, and framed such constitutions, ceremonies and doctrines, as must be
received without scanning, or else would appear empty and groundless. But
that the reforming Clergy, that pretend to have truth in its simplicity, and
the Gospel in its purity, and seem to abominate all by-endes or respects,
should yet take the same course of prohititions with the Bishops, lock up the
Press, and then vent themselves in a furious and (evidently) scandalizing way,
as in their late preachings and Pamphlets against the Anabaptists, will make, I
believe, all wise men suspect that either they doubt their own tenets, or know
some gross errors amongst themselves, which yet their interests and
professions engage them to maintain. To say they go not about to compel the
conscience, which is incapable of compu^sion, but will only punish the person,
is as if they were sportfull in their cruelty, and shows as if it proceeded
from men settled, and long practiced in tyranny, I could wish for Christianity
sake they had more wisdom then to play with men's afflictions: I profess unto
you, did I still dote upon the persons and seeming holiness of our Miuisters
(as I have done) such carriage as this I think would open mine eyes, and make
me see they are not the men they seem to be, that in so sho^t ^ time can grow
so wanton with their own estate and pre-eminence, as to gibe and scoff at
their brethrens miseries. Is it not a shame to our profession, and scandal to
our cause, that well affected men, real, and irreconcilable enemies to
tyranny, and our common Adversaries, should be necessitatd to leave their
native Country, because they can hope nothing from you, our Divines, but to be
imprisoned or punished for exercising their consciences, though by their help
you should be settled in your liberties, I cannot tell what else to make of this
for my part, but that you bad rather be slaves to the King, and hazard the
freed me of the whole Nation, then that these men should have freedom with
you; ye may flatter your selves, that ye are rich in spiritual graces, and
presume that you are in the right, and have found out the truth of the Gospel
and Ordieances, but so long as ye want the maine evidences thereof, Love and
lowliness of mind, so long as ye propose dominion and the sway over your
Brethren, which our Savior said his followers shonld not do, Matthew. 20. 25.
26. Murke 10. 42. you must give men that are unwilling to be deceived leave to
think that ye have yet but the form and show of Religion, but want the
inward sweetness and most excellent fruits and effects thereof; I could wish
I had no occasion for speaking thus much, but when sores bigin to fester, they
must not be nourished and swathed, but lanc'd and corraciv'd, it is no time to
hide and excuse men's imperfections, when they strive to take root for
perpetuity. Were it in mine own cause, I could not speak so much, but in half
of such a harmless people as I have found those of the Separation to be,
after much inquiry and examination of their Tenets, and practice, I think my
self bound in conscience to break silence and become their advocate.

Ob. There is one Objection more against the Anabaptists in particular, and
that is, that they allow not of Civil government and therefore not to be
tolerated because they hold an opinion directly destructive to the
Commonwealth.

Ans. Who says they hold this opinion? why the Divines commonly in their
Pulpits, and what ground have they for their so saying? They find it in books
that they who have written of them affirm that they maintain this opinion.
But how if the societies of Anabaptists in this Kinghome are most Zealous and
rational defenders of our Government? as to my knowledge they are, and that
experience can testify for them, that noe men have more forwardly and
constantly then they assisted the Parliament against those that would disolve
our free government, and bring in tyranny; how is it true then that the
Anabaptists hold such an opinion? O then they tell us that our Anabaptists are
no Anabaptists: To what purpose then do they exclaim against Anabaptists that
have been of that opinion? (as they say) (though for my part I believe neither
them, nor the books that tells them so) when they cannot but know, if they know
any thing, that the Anabaptists which now are, be not of that opinion; why for
this end and purpose, they resolve to make the Anabaptists odious to the
people, and nothing they think will sooner do it, then by making the people
believe that they are the harbourers of such an opinion as would dissolve all
society, and bring into confusion the state.

Now this they speak of the Anabaptists in general, knowing that the people
will apply it to the Anabaptists in England, concerning whom how true it is*
you may judge by that which follows.

The Anabaptists opinion concerning Government is, that the world being grown
so vicious, and corrupt as it is, there can possibly be no living for honest
men without Government: That the end of making Government, is the Peoples quiet
and safety, and that whatsoever does not conduce thereto is tyranny or
oppression and not government, That the Government of England is of all others
that they know the most excellent, the people by their chosen men, being the
makers and reformers thereof: That therein the Parliament is the supreme power,
and that the King is accountable to them for the not performance of his Office,
as all other Officers of the Commonwealth are: That the Parliament only are
the makers and alterers of Laws for the regulation and ordering of the people:
That of right they are to be called by those Laws they have made in that
behalf, and to dissolve when they themselves see good: that it is not at the
Kings will or pleasure to sign or refuse those Bills the Parliament shall
pass, but that he is of duty to sign them: That all great Officers and
Majestrates of the Kingdom are to be chosen by them: That the King is to have
his personal abode near the Parliament, that they may have free conference
with him at pleasure touching the former discharge of his Office, or the
present state of the Commonwealth: That to Parliaments alone belong the
disposal of Shipping, Forts, Magazines, and all other the Kingdoms strengths,
both by Sea and Land: The making of peace and war, the pressing of soldiers,
the raising of money for the preserving or regaining the safety or freedom of
the people, which for any other person to do, is treasonable. These grounds
and principles of our government they knowing, could not but see the
exorbitances of the King, and whereto al his lawles courses and designs
tended, and therefore have not ignorantly (as perhaps others) but upon these
grounds assisted the Parliament, and will do till the last.

Judge by this then whether these men hold an opinion against government, or at
what wretchlesse pass those men are that would make the people believe they
do.

I might insist here upon a Book called The Confutation of Anabaptists lately
set forth, which says, They are absolute and professed enemies to the
essential Being of Civil Government, but I find people so little regard the
Book, it being so full of nonsense, and in this particular so evidently
contrary to truth, and the experience of every man, that looks abroad, and
knows any thing of the Anabaptists; that it will be but loss o^ time to take
notice of it, only it were worth observation to see how easily it obtained an
Imprimatur, and how open the Press is to any thing true or false, sense or
nonsense, that tends to the Anabaptists scandal or disgrace.

In the beginning of the Parliament a Book was published, called the History
of the Anabaptists in High and Low Germany, the aim whereof was by fastening
odious errors and feigned mutenies upon the Anabaptists to deter this present
Parliament in their Reformation of Bishops, for fear, as the book says,
least they who now cry out for Christ's rule, strike not so much at the misrule
of Episcopacy, as quarrel at all rules, so that what course was taken by the
Bishops and their friends to hinder the Reformation of that Hierarchy, namely,
the affrighting the Reformers by airy and imaginary consequences, the same are
used by our Divines to prevent a through Reformation; of many erroures, and
mistakes in our Clergy, which they exceedingly fear, and therefore they have,
and do continue early and late to render the Anabaptists as odious to the
people as their wits and inventions can make them. But as the Bishops then
failed of their ends by the wisdom of the Parliament; so I trust the present
endeavoures of our Divines in striving to raise themselves upon their Brethrens
disgrace and ruin, will by the continued courage and prudence of the
Parliament prove vain and fruitless.

They who echo the Kings words and take the Bishops course (I will not say
have the Kings ends but) so far do the Kings work.

The King, I confess, has reason to cry out upon the Aabaptists, because he
knows them to be enemies not of Government, but oppression in Government, and
all those who intend to oppress in any manner, ought, if they will be true to
themselves to do so too; for the Anabaptists are oppressions enemies, whoever
be the oppressors.

And whereas they say, they find in Books, that the Anabaptists are enemies to
all Government, it were well if they would confider who wrote those Books: it
may be they were written either by mistake, or for the same end ahat they
repeat them. We can show you books too, that say the Parliament are Brownists
and Anabaptists; And past all question, if the King should thrive in this
unnatural war, this Parl. should in their Court Histories, not only be
called Anabaptists, but branded also to all posterity with that opinion falsely
and maliciously fathered upon the Anabaptists, That they were enemies to
Government, and went about to bring all into confusion. little credit
therefore is to given to Books in matter of obloquie and scandal: but the
men, and their judgments in the times they live, are to be considered: And then
I am confident it will appear, that the Anabaptists be of well affectted
minds, and peaceable dispositions, meriting a fair respect from the State,
and may well challenge amongst others, the quiet enjoyment of themselves as
they are men, and the ordinances of Christ as they are Christians.

I will add one thing more to the Brownists and Anabaptists glory; that in the
times of the Bishops domineering, when many of the Presbyterians complied, some
to the very top of Wrens Conformity, and preached for those things they now
prerend chiefly to reform, and the Independants fled to places where they
might live at ease, and enjoy their hundred pounds a year, without danger; the
Brownist and Anabaptist endured the heat and brunt of persecution, and
notwithstanding the several ways of vexing them, continued doing their
duties, counting it the glory of a Christian to endure tribulation for the name
of Christ: And the times a^^e^ing the Presbyterian soon comes about, and the
Independent comes over, to be ^eaders in the Reformation, when forgetting the
constancy and integrity of those who bore the heat and burden of the day, they
hold the same heavy hand over them, that their fathers the Bishops did. And as
the Brownists and Anabaptists affection to the common good of all, was
themfirme, and able to endure the trial of persccution, so has it in these
present searching times continued constant and unshaken, notwithstanding the
many almost unsufferable Injuries and provocations of the Divines on the one
fide, and the fair promises and frequent invitations of the King on the other;
so that had any ends of their own been aimed at, they could not have
continued such resolved and immovable enemies of Tyranny, and friends to their
conutry: I believe if we would suppose other men to be in their Condition, we
could hardly expect the like even and upright carriage from them, amidst so
many storms and temptations surrounding them. I hope all good men will take
all that has been said into consideration, especially the Parliament who I
presume are most ingenuous and impartial of all others. and whom it chiefly
concerns, they being called and trusted to vindicate and preserve the peoples
liberties in general, and not to enthrall the Consciences, Persons, or Estates
of any of them unto a pregmaticall pretended Clergy, whether Episcopal,
Presbiteriall, or any other whatsoever, The greatest glory of authority is to
protect the distressed; and for those that are Judges in other men's causes to
bear themselves as if the afficted men's cases were their own; observing that
divine rule of our Savior, What soever ye would that usen should due unto
you, even so do ye to them And if to the Parl. it shall appear for the
reasons given or other better they can siggest to themselves, that it is most
unjust, and much more unchristian, that any man should be compelied against his
conscience to a way he approves not of, I doubt not but they will be pleased for
Gods glory, and union sake and likewise for these good men's sake, which for the
present it principally concerns, at least for their own sakes (for who knows
how socne this may be his own case) speedily to stop all proceedings that
tends thereunto: and for the future provide, that as well particular or private
Congregations, as public, may have public protection, so that upon a penalty
no injury or offense be offered either to them from others, or by them to
others. That all Statutes against the Separatists be reviewed, and repealed,
especially that of the 35. of Eliz. That the Press may be free for any man,
that writes nothing standalous or dangerous to the State. That so this
Parliament may prove themselves loving Fathers to all sorts of good men,
bearing equal respect to all, according to the trust reposed in them, and so
inviting an equal affection and assistance from all: that after Ages may
report of them, they did all these things, not because of the importunity of
the people, or to please a party, but from the reason and justness of them,
which did more sway with them, then a Petition subscribed with Twenty thousand
hands could have done.

FINIS.
