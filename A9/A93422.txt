THE PVBLIQVE CONFIDER

Printed at OXFORD by Leonard L^^chfield, MDCXLIII.

THE CONFIDER
THe distempers, distractions iealousies, lawful and unlawful wars of these
present times, unhappily fallen, stirred up, and fomented by some, under
specious, but unjust pretenses, are the only motives to write on this present
Subject. The word is Confido, and it signifies to trust, or to put his trust in.

From these premises the inference that I deduc^ is this; let every soul be
subject to the higher power, for all power is of God: They are not my words,
but the assertion of the great Doctor of the Gentiles, Saint Paul in his 13.
Chap. Romans 1. wherein there are two things considerable, a precept in the first
words, and the reason enforcing it in the latter; for all power is of God.
There Is a threefold power, Monarchical, Aristocraticall, and Democraticall All
these are of God, and there is none that is, but is derived from him. The first
is the power of the Prince, the second of the Peers, and the third of the
people, or the house of Commons a All these must be obeyed, because all power
is of God; yet under correction, give me leave to hold this position, that the
first of these being Supreamest, ought (...) the prime place to be obeyed.

Divisum Imperium cum Jove Caesar habet; our ^esar is Superior to all, and
Inferior to none ^ne to God himself, the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.
There is a kind of Divinity in the word Monarchy, Vno minor est Jove, the King
is a Sovereign Monarch, and being but one, he is next to God: per me Reges
regnant, it is Gods privilege, and let not us deny his Vicegerent his
prerogative. The Kings power is conferred upon him by the supreme power, the
power of all powers; and therefore must every soul be subject to it (and then
we confide,) I say every soul, it is of a vast extent and capacity, none is
exempted, it being a term of universality.

The Church of Rome does except the Clergy, ^^^^^^ing that every soul of the
Laity ought to be subject, and here we may not confide; but the Church of
England is of a better opinion, holding according to the tenent of Saint Paul,
that every soul ought to be subject, for he is no good subject who is not
subject to the King; and here you ought ^^d will I hope confide.

The duty that every subject owes to his Sovereigne is threefold; honor,
subjection, and obedience.

First, honor him in your thoughts; ye must not conjecture ill of his Majesty;
he that think ill of the King, said the wisest, King Solomon, of mortal (...),
of immortal memory (shall not go unpu^^^^ed.)

Secondly, honor him with your tongue in giving him his just and due title and
style, defender of the true ancient Catholic and Apostolick^ (...) in all
causes, and over all persons, as well Ecelesiast call as civil, next under
Gods Sacred Majesty; supreme head and governor, ye must speak well of him,
and for him; for who shall say unto the King, what do thou, as you have it in
the 8. of the Ecelesiast, and 4. ver.

Thirdly, honor him with your hand, I mean with the homage of tribute, with
your means and substance, if he be King (though he come to the Crown by
inheritance, by election, by donation, or by the law of the sword) we must be
subject, and obey him; whatsoever he commands, if it be not contrary to the
sacred Word of God, we must yield obedience to, for the wrath of a King is as
messengers of death, Prove. the 16. and 14. and in the 22. and ^. he that
provokes him unto anger sins against his own soul.

O remember eternity, eternity, I say eternity, and then you will yield a
double obedience, active, and passive, in doing and in suffering, though he
should command what is again^ the law of the Land: we must by no means rebel,
for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, what we cannot perform with
obedience, we must be content to suffer with patience; but thanks be to God, we
have no such King, that requires of us any obedience against the will of God,
his will and promise is to rule us according to the known and Fundamental
Laws of the Land, he is our dearest parent, and we are bound by the Law of
God to honor and obey him, though he be not (...) luminum, the Father of
lights, nor Pater Spi^^^^, the Father of Spirits (for these two are Gods
^^^^tles) yet he is Paterpatria, the Father of his ^^^^^rey, and the nursing
Father and fosterer of this Church and State. But good God into what ^^^entable
times are we now fulaie; out of Silla into ^^^^bdes, from a high borne storm,
not confide^ing of a calm, to an unmoved rock, or an uncon^^nt sand; though
we ought to obey him, depend (...) him, believe him, honor him, and be subject
to (...), yet (such is our wretched diffidence and incredulity) we will by no
means confide in him; we (...) so full of fears and iealousies upon mere
fan^^^^ and apprehensions, general and uncertain ^ounds, that we cannot
confide in him; rather then we will take his word, we levy forces pretended for
(...), and are so strong in our weaknesses, that we are ^^^y enemies to our
own peace (is this to confide, (...) the word take its birth where it will,
here it is ^^^ative) this in the period will make us ludibrium ^^^^ium, the
laughing stock of the Nations, a prey ^^^our adversaties, a ruin to our
selves, and an ob^^quie to those about us.

His Majesty has vowed and protested to God ^^d the world, that he intend, to
maintain the true ^^^^ant Religion, the ancient Laws of the Land, (...)
liberty and property of the Subject, with the (...) privileges of the
Parliament, and shall we not ^^nfide in him? so gracious wa^ (...) the
^^gi^^ing of this Parliament, (...) to put himself freely and clearly upon the
love and affection of his English subjects, you not withstanding invite him by
your levies to do otherwise (...) I trust in God there (will be no need) you
have been told so, and if your consciences be not secured there is tel-troth
too he at first confided in us, and shall not we confide in him; the words of
a king are like himself sincere, and shall we not take his word? he has said
(and I dare say) from his heart, so God deal with him and his, as he intends to
do with his people: will not all these expressions move u's to confide in him?
If an ordinary mechanic should profess so much unto us we might not stick to
take his word, much less may we make it a scruple to take the word of a King.
Certainly that his absenting himself so long from his great Council (the
Parliament) has produced such a civil, or rather uncivil war at this time in
the Kingdom, has been more suitable to other men's evil desires then to the
Kings own words. It Is a maxim in the Law, that the King can do no wrong; but
if any ill be committed in matter of the State, the Council, if in matter of
justice, the Judges must answer for it, so much of knowledge I have of that
unknowing and unknown vindicator of the Parliament) his Majesty has declared
himself; that be will make the law of the land the rule of his power; he
abhors that saying, voluntas Regi^, lex populi, the will of the Prince the law
of his people; and for all this will we not confide in him, we will confide in
our servant that must obey us, and yet we will not confide in our S^^eraigne
that can command us: but it may be ^^^e will say how can he command us, when
as we ^^^^e his service. I answer that iwobedientia sub di^^^^^ (...) tollit
jus dominationis; The disobedience (...)subjects takes, not away the right of
the Sove^^^^^e; and therefore if there were no other reason (...) the relation
of King and subject, it were suffici^^^ ^o persuade us, but there are many
more; for (...) King is pious, gracious, prudent, just, valiant, ^^^erate,
element, merciful, he never delighted (...), nor was he ever ready to shed
blood, but ^d^^^ies willing to show his innate mercy and say it, he desires
peace and to that end has sent many gr^^^ieus messnages to his two honorable
houses of Parliament, that he might prevent the effusion of in^^cent blood, had
he loved the contrary, where (...) the Parliament's being, or all the gracious
a^^ he passed there, and yet we are not content, what v^^^d we, his Crown, our
ruin let us be modest (...) take heed, for that will cursh us to the center of
(...) ^arth, which some hold to be the place of Lucifer for his pride) as being
farthest from heaven.

(...) was his fathers motto, beati pacifici, blessed are the peace makers; and
in my heart I am persuaded the our Sovereign his Son does not in this legene^^
from his Royal Progenetor.

For our parts, let it be our care and duty to pray (...) God that we may seek
pe^ce and ensue it, Psalm. 34.13. and that our Royal King and his Parliament
may confide in each other, that there may ^^^o more bloodshed in this his
Kingdom, but that a happy and blessed union may be drawn between them: and
let us be confident (for o^^^ couragement) that if we pray in faith, G^^ grant
our requests. Let us therefore (in the (...) and fear of God) pray for peace
to the God of peace; (not with much babbling as though our ^^^ers cost us
naught, not yet with powdering (...) guns, and then gorging our selves like
Cannibals) that he would be pleased to settle peace in this ^^^ding and
distressed Kingdom, that so we may (...) the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace, that the two great armies now in the field may be speedily disbanded,
and that upon this wished for pacification, his Majesty may return again to
his high and honorable Court of Parliament, with the Olive branch of peace in
his mouth, to the glory of God, the comfort of his people, and terror of all
his enemies.

Me thinks I hear you enquire for the Author and his name, I Will tell you,
it is one that prefers (...) good of his King and Country before his own
safety, his abode the Kings Army, his name I. S.

Generesos.
