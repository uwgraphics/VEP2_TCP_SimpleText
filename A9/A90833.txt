The poor Committee-mans Account, avouched by BRITANNICUS.
O Yes! Behold here is my account,
I Am ready for to make it,
If any man who loves the King
will please to come and take it;
I am not as the Cavaliers
are pleased to call me, Traitor;
I am a poor Committees Clerk,
a simple harmless Creature;
That this is true you need not doubt,
examine Mr. Needam,
He Will tell you true, and swear it too,
it is for the Kingdoms freedom.
Free Pole Money, free money lent
upon the Propositions,
Free money raised for Irish Lands,
but God knows the conditions;
Free money lent on Ordinance,
free Subsidies full fifty,
If our Committees grow not rich,
I Will never think them thrifty;
That this is true, etc.
The fifth and twentieth part, Excise,
Customs and Sequestrations;
The Kings Revenues too we have,
besides the great Taxation;
And that great tax is monthly laid
upon the associated,
Which comes to threescore thousand pounds
a month, if rightly stated:
That this is true, etc.
But O! that Tophe^ Goldsmiths-Hall,
where men make composition,
Which gets (they say) the devil and all,
that Spanish Inquisition:
If any Dives should fall sick,
and dye (as men are sickly)
They would his heir a Lazarus make,
and they would do it quickly:
That this is true, etc.
They say they fourscore thousand had,
some make it up a hundred,
Suppose four hundred pound a man,
a sum scarce to be numbered;
The Bishops Lands are but a toy
with such great sums compared,
Yet those we hope will one day come,
amongst us to be shared:
That this is true, etc.
Ship Money was a hideous thing
these payments are but trifles,
That was enjoined by the King,
all Law and Justice stifles:
These toys the Parliament injoynes,
therein all Subjects share too,
Yet they who at the Stern do sit,
for this will take a care too;
That this is true, etc.
Alas! why should such men pay debts,
the Cavaleeres did plunder?
If not, yet they their charges bear,
then is it not a wonder,
The wicked should say they grow rich,
who but contrive the payments,
And of the public stock take care,
their gains scarce finds them rayments:
That this is true, etc.
These men defy all wicked tongues,
that challenge close Committees,
Let the^ throw stones have don no wrong
is it not a thousand pitties,
Such careful pious men as those,
who have done their endeavors,
To purge the Church and wicked state,
should now be thought deceivers?
That this is true, etc.
Suppose they have a public stock
sure that must be concealed,
It was but for the public raised,
and it shall be revealed;
We know, that were the stock as great as
David's, which amounted
To such a sum, we have such men,
it need not to be counted:
That this is true you need not doubt,
examine Mr. Needame,
He Will tell you true, and swear it too,
it is for the Kingdoms freedom.
