TO THE REVEREND, LEARNED and GRAVE DIVINES, IN THE CITY OF LONDON.
HAving of late, with great satisfaction, taken notice of your frequent and
earnest Addresses to our merciful God (by your public and private Fasts) for
the Settlement of these poor distracted Nations: And knowing; when we
supplicate for the Effusion of any Mercy; we are obliged to endeavor all
lawful and rational means that may conduce to its attainment, but most
especially in what concerns our Religion, Laws* and our three Nations greatest
good: (Right Reverend Fathers) with all due submission to your Grave Wisdoms)
we offer this our request unto your several Considerations; and according as it
shall please him who rules the hearts of all men, to direct you in this, which
we conceive may so much conduce to the public good, to appoint an Assembly of
your selves, and upon your most serious Consultation of what may most speedily
redress the Breaches of our ruined Nations* and establish our Religion, to draw
up the Heads of your Desires (which we know will be the freest from the
prejudice of selfinterest) with a subscription of all your names, and appoint
their delivery by some of your own Hands, to his Excellency the Lord General
Monk, (to whom God has now given an opportunity to make these three Nations
happy; And herein we are fully persuaded, that his Piety and Conscience will
neither pass by, nor reject, and much less act contrary to what by your
Assembly shall be, by right Reason, Judgment and Equity, manifested to be the
only means of our Settlement:

And if it shall please God in his infinite mercy, to make your Advice a
furtherance and persuasive to his resolutions, to use that power God has put
his hands in asserting the apparent good of the Nations, it would evidence the
acceptance of your Prayers to God, and endear you to the affections of all good
men.

And we do assure you, there is none whom (under God) we would so gladly
acknowledge the Authors of our happiness, as your selves. We suppose we need not
use any Arguments to persuade you herein; It being manifested by the like
Addresses from all the Counties through which his Excellency has yet passed,
to be a most probable way, by the expressed unity of the several desires of the
whole Nation to promote the Settlement and security of the true Protestant
Religion, of our known Fundamental Laws and Liberties, and to prevent the
Effusion of Christian Blood.

If you shall please to make use of this our humble Advice; we doubt not but
all good men will join with us in our Prayers to God, to bless and prosper your
Endeavors:
