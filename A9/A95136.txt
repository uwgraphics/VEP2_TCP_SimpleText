A True Relation from Rome, of a bloody and cruel Monster, That for many Years
has destroyed an infinite Number of Men, Women, and Children; devoured the
Growth of that Country, and reduced other Nations to want: With a Description
of its prodigious Shape, terrifying Aspect, and Fox-like Craftiness; the like
never yet seen in any other part of the World.
WE are assured in Scripture, That before the Dissolution of the Universe,
there shall appear Signs in the Heavens, and Wonders: But there never has been
known such a Wonder, or Prodigy, as the Monster in this monsterous Narrative
will appear; yet it is not so strange as true, as too many Nations have felt,
and found by woeful Experience.

The Letter which gives a Description of him runs thus: In this City there is a
Monster, such as never was seen, but only in this Place: He at first sprang out
of the Sea, having Seven Heads, and Ten Horns; and on his Head the Name of
Blasphemy: He is spoted like a Leopard, his Feet are like a Bears, and his
Mouth is like a Lyon's: He has done great Wonders, and deceived many Nations;
slain many Thousands of Innocents, and is drunken with the Blood of Saints: He
causes himself to be worshipped, and exalts himself above all that is called
God's, and he sits as God in the Temple of God: He is Letcherous as a Bore, as
full of Poison as a Toade, Cunning as a Fox, Surly as a Lion, Bloody minded as
a she Bear, Deceitful as a Leopard, Wise as a Serpent, and as Proud as the
Devil; treading upon the Necks of Emperors and Kings: And although he is of the
Nature of a Wolf, yet he always goes in Sheeps Clothing, the better to
deceive the Multitude; but he is known by his Works. To describe him to the
Life, would be almost impossible; but thus much we can say of him: He is an
Idolatrous, Traditious, Malicious, Superstitious, Perfidious, Deceitful,
Hateful, Bloody-Minded, Proud, Letcherous, Lofty, Factious, Perjured,
Equivocal, Ugly, Wicked, Damnable, Devil Incarnate; and is called the POPE. He
sells Heaven for Money, and lets who he pleases in; He forgives who he pleases,
and who he pleases he damns; He dethrones Kings at his Pleasure, and them that
will not worship him he Excommunicates, or puts to ignominious Deaths: He
extols and exalts himself above all others; and therefore, by all that has
been said, can be no other than the Son of Perdition, the Whore of Babylon, a
Burden to the Earth, and a Limb of the Devil; unfit to live, and more unfit to
dye; loathsome to Heaven, and a Shame to Mortals; therefore fit for nothing but
a Brakefast for Satan.

FINIS.
