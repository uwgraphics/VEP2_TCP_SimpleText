THE following Report was made to the Royal Society at Gresham College the
Third of April, 1700. by the Ingenious Dr. Hook.

That he had considered the Use of the Portable Scale, Invented by Mr. Tho.
Wastell, and finds it to be Ingenious, and of good Use for the more expeditious
Performance of the Operations mentioned, to be thereby performable in the Title
of his Book.

THE APPLICATION OF A New Portable SCALE, (Being the First of this Nature) In
Resolving Questions in the following Particulars, viz.

INTEREST, For any Sum, Time or Rate. DISCOUNT, Of Bills, Tallies, Stock, etc.
FACTORIDGE At all Rates. BROKERIDGE At all Rates. COMMISSION At all Rates.
EXCHANGE, etc. At all Rates. VALUE Of any Quantity of Goods, Merchandise, or
any Fractional part of an Intiger. Of any Number of Pistols, Dollers, or other
Foreign Coin. Of Wages due to any Workmen or Seamen, for any Time or Rate: As
also Short Allowance. NUMBER, Of Days in any distance of Time. PROPORTION, Of
any Sum per Annum, to One or any Number of Days. And several other profitable
USES.
The Second Edition, with Additions.

Invented by THO. WASTELL.

London, Printed for the Author, and Sold by Richard Mount, at the Postern on
Tower Hill. 1700.

To the Honored Charles Sergison, Esquire CLERK of the Acts OF HIS Majesty's Royal
Navy.
THis Scale (which is the Product of some vacant Minutes) is in Grateful
Acknowledgment of many Favors most humbly dedicated and presented by

His most Dutiful and Obedient Servant Tho. Wastell.

How to Tabulate any Number on this SCALE.
EAch of the six Reds has the nine Digits, and a proper Sum to each Digitt on
the right hand of it; which Rods are numbered on the outermost end with 1. 10.
100. 1000. 10000, etc. and are to be drawn out 'till the proper Figure (and the
Sum appertaining) come into the vacancy on the right hand end of the Scale,
clear of any other Sum: All Units are to be found on the Unit-Rod, Tens on 10
Rods, Hundreds on 100 Rod, and Thousands on the 1000 Rod, etc. To Tabulate 743,
pull out the 100 Rod to 7, 10 Rod to 4, and Unit Rod to 3; and place the
Numbers exactly one under another, and add the Sums to answer the Question, and
the like for any other Sum.

In shifting the Sides, turn the Rods one by one into their own Places.

Interest at any Rate, for any Time or Sum. Found on the First Side.
RVLE. MUltiply the Sum by the Number of Days, and the Product by the Rate of
Interest, Tabulate this last Product as before, and add the several Sums found,
for the Interest required.

Interest of Shillings is found by the same Rule, dividing the last Product by
20.

Three Quarters, Half, a Quarter, and Half Quarter per Cent. Is that proportion
of the Product of the Sum, Multiplied by the Number of Days, and to be added to
the Product when multiplied by the even Rate.

Note, Farthings are expressed by Dotts, and fifth part of Farthings by () and
where four fifths happen, one ought to be added.

The last Figure on the right hand need not to be Tabulated, in any Operation
on the First Side; therefore the Unite-Rod is omitted.

Examples at large.
What 354 l. at 5 per Cent. for 321 days, ^

What 67 16 0 for 73 days at 9 per Cent. ^

Or by one Operation, if Shillings and Pence be turned into Decimals.

Discount of Bills, Tallies, or Stocks.
On the First Side.
RVLE. Multiply the Sum by 365, and the Product by the Rate of Discount, which
last Product Tabulate, and Subtract the Interest found, out of the Principal.

Note. Fractions either in Sum or Rate are resolved as in Interest.

Examples at large.
What 230 l. at 7 per Cent. Discount. ^

What 150 l. at 4 per Cent. Discount ^

What 2123 l. at 2 per Cent. Discount. ^

What 315 l. at 17 per Cent. Advance. ^

Brokeridge, Factoridge, Commission, Exchange, etc.
On the First Side.
Are all performed by the same RVLE.

Examples.
What 7562 l. at 1 and Quarter ptr Cent. ^

What 412 l. at 5 per Cent. ^

Gold or Foreign Coin to cast up.
On the Second Side.
Pistols at 17 s. 6 d. Multiply their Number by 7, and then by 30, and Tabulate
as above.

Dollers, Pieces of Eight, etc. Multiply their Number by the value of Pence in
each, and Tabulate.

Examples.
What 513 Pistols at 00 17 6 each. ^

What 1714 Dollers at 54 d. each. ^

Value of Goods or Merchandise.
On the Second Side.
Multiply the Number of Yards, Else, Pounds, Ounces, etc. by the Value of one,
in Pence, and Tabulate the Product.

Half pence or Farthings, Take Half, Quarter, or three Quarters of the Numbet
or Quantity, and add to the Product.

Examples.
What 227 Ounces at 5 d. per Ounce? ^

What 1345 Yards at 20 l. per Yard. ^

What 5602 Feet at 2 d. per Foot. ^

What 730 at 4 d. each. ^

Or, if the Price of the Commodity, etc. consist but of one Figure, Tabulate
the Number or Quantity given, and multiply it by the said Figure on the Scale,
by beginning at Units, removing the Rod to the proper Figure when multiplied,
and carry the Tens to the next Rod, and so on; adding up the Sums appertaining
to the Product for answering the Question.

Wages to Workmen at Day-work.
On the Second Side.
Multiply the Number of Days, by the Number of Pence for one Day, and Tabulate;
Fractions, found as the last.

What 83 Days at 21 d. per Diem? ^

What 365 Days at 2 s. 2 d. per Diem? ^

Wages to Workmen by the Year.
On the First Side.
Multiply the Sum per Annum by the Number of Days required, add two Ciphers to
the right hand of the Product and Tabulate.

Example.
At 24 per Annum, what 77 Days? ^

Example.
At 36 10 per Annum, what 112 Days? ^

Note, No Ciphers are to be added where Decimals are used.

Seamen's Wages by the Year.
On the the First Side.
Multiply the Decimal of the Sum per Annum by the Number of Days, Tabulate the
Product, omitting the last Figure to the right Hand.

Examples.
What 28 Days at l. 24 8 10 per Annum. ^

What 90 Days at Ditto. ^

What One Day at Ditto. ^

Wages to Seamen per Mensem.
On the Second Side.
As 280 is to the Rate per Month, in Pence, so is the Number of Days to a
Number required; to which add a (0) to the right Hand and Tabulate.

The Pence may be taken Full or Nett.

Note, Cut off the odd pence of the Sum found.

Examples.
What 365 Days at 24 s. per Mensem. ^

What 1210 Days at 4 6 2 per Mensem. ^

Short Allowance.
On the Second Side.
Multiply the Number of Days by the Number of Pence for one Day, and Tabulate:
For Fractions, add the proportion of the Number of Days.

Examples.
What 307 Days at of all Provisions. ^

What 145 Days at Allow. of all Provisions. ^

A Yearly Sum, Pension, Salary, etc. being given, to find the Proportion to any
Number of Days.
On the first Side.
Multiply the Sum by the Number of Days, add (00) to the right hand of the
Product and Tabulate.

Examples.
At 450 l. per Annum, what 49 Days? ^

At 60 l. per Annum, what 99 Days? ^

If there be Shillings in the Yearly Sum, take the Decimal and work as before,
without adding the (00)

Example.
At l. 11 17 0 per Ann. what 32 Days? ^

For one Day, add (00) to the Sum per Ann. if an even Sum, and Tabulate; but if
a Decimal Tabulate the Decimal.

Examples.
At 70 l. per Ann. what a Day? 7000 Tab. gives 0 3 10.

At 48 10 per Ann. what one Day? 4850 Tab. l. 0 2 3.

The Price of a Load of Timber, being given, to find the Value of any Number of
Feet under a Load.
On the First Side.
Multiply the Price per Load (in Decimals) by (73) and that by the Number of
Feet, cut off two Figures to the right hand of the Product, and Tabulate the
Remainder.

Examples.
At 3 7 6 per Load, what 17 Feet? ^

At l. 5 10 9 per Load, what 11 Feet, and what one Foot? ^

Or if by the Tun or 40 Feet, Multiply by 912, 5.

Common Multiplicands, to find the Value of any Number of Feet, of Plank of any
Thickness under a Load, at any Price per Load: By the foregoing Rule.
Inches thick. Multipl. Inches. thick. Multipl. 10 608,33 5 304,1 9 577,97 4
279,43 9 550,52 4 243,33 8 521,43 3 212,92 8 486,66 3 182,5 7 456,25 2 152,1 7
425,85 2 121,65 6 392,62 1 91,25 6 365, 1 60,83 5 332,61

And by the same Rule may the value of any part or proportion of the
Particulars following be resolved at any Rate.

Great Hundred or (112) if multiplied by 326, Neat Hundred, or (100) With. or No.
by 365, 6 Score to the C. or (120) With. or No. by 304,2 If to the Hundred (108)
With. or No. by 337,96 For a Hogshead of (63) Gall. -- by 579,38 For a Tun of --
(252) Gall. -- by 144,84
Or any other Denomination whatsoever; first finding out its common Multiplier
by this Rule, Divide 36500, by the Number or parts in the Denomination, and if
any Fraction remain, add Ciphers to the Dividend, and proceed as far as it will
allow, seperating the Quotes got by the Addition of Ciphers, for Decimal parts,
and the Quotient will be the common Multiplier to that Denomination.

Note, That in all Operations where Decimals are multiplied; as many places to
the right hand of the Product be cut off, as there are Decimals in the
Multiplicand, and Multiplier, and the rest only Tabulated on the Scale.

Time to Cast into Days.
On the back side of the Rule.
The Number on the right hand of the Diagonal Line, are the Number of Days from
the first of January to the first of the Month over it; the Number on the left
hand are from the last of December to the last of the Month; the Days in the
Month to be added or subtracted.

From the Number of Days to the last Day given; subtract the Number of Days to
the first Day, from the first of January.

This Table is cast for Four Years.

Or, if the Shillings be even, take half for the first Figure of the Decimal;
if odd, add 5 for the second Figure; reduce the Pence into Farthings, to which
add the Farthings (if any to be reduced) and add the Tens to the second Figure
whether 0 or 5, and put the Remainder in the third Place: But if the Number of
Farthings be above 24, one more ought always to be added.

Any Decimal given are reduced into Shillings, Pence and Farthings, by the
Reverse of this Rule.

THroughout the First Part the Operations are all performed at large, and is, I
hope, sufficient to explain the Nature of the Scale, and its application to the
several Uses therein mentioned, as well as to render this Part more brief, by
allowing the use of these few Characters undermentioned, in the several
Examples performed therein; which I doubt not but will be as acceptable to the
Ingenious, and answer my Design, in rendering the whole Portable (as well as
the Scale) on any occasion.
