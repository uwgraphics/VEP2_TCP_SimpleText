A LETTER FROM EDINBURGH, Concerning The difference of the Proceedings of the
Well-affected in SCOTLAND From the Proceedings of The ARMY in ENGLAND.

LONDON, Printed in the Year 1648.

A Letter from EDINBURGH, Concerning the difference of the Proceedings of the
Well-affected in Scotland, from the Proceedings of the ARMY in England. Dated
the 19. of December. 1648.
SIR,
I Am much troubled and amazed at that which you relate concerning the late
proceedings of your England ARMY; but most of all at the pretenses which are
used to color the same, which are, That they follow the example which has
been given them here in Scotland, and that they act the Resolutions which our
Marquess of Arguile and your Lieutenant-Generall did conclude at their last
meeting. Which are things so far dissonant not only from truth, but from all
likelihood, that I dare confidently say, nothing could have been devised either
more falfly, or with less appearance. As for the Marquess, I dare pawn all
that I am worth in this world, that our Noble and faithful Marquess who has
so freely and often hazarded himself and all that he has for the true interest
of Scotland, in maintaining the National Covenant, did never agree to any of
those undertakings (you mention your Army set upon) which are most directly
opposite to all the purposes and intents of our Covenant. For in stead of the
Reformation and settlement of Religion, it is evident that your men intend to
settle nothing, but rather to unsettle all both in Church and State, by an
universal Toleration of all Religions: In stead of maintaining the Privileges
of Parliament, as the supreme Judicature of your Kingdom, they break it in
pieces, and settling themselves as Judges over it, over the King and over the
whole Kingdom, they effectively undertake to dissolve it: Instead of defending
the King and his Authority, in the preservation and defense of the true
Religion and Liberties of the Kingdoms, they set themselves to destroy him and
his Race, and will have an elective King or none at all. Thus the three first
Articles of the Covenant are utterly made void. In stead of bringing evil
Instruments, that hinder the Reformation of Religion, and divide between the
King and his people, to condign punishment; their whole way is to overturn
that which is settled in the Reformation of Religion, and to make a Faction
dividing the King from his people: which is against the 4. and 5. Articles. Nor
can they, by the principles which they follow, be faithful to the 6. Article
thereof, which is to defend and assist the Covenanters, but they rather will
become the chief prosecutors of the same. Now I am sure that neither my Lord of
Argyle nor any of those that manage the public affairs here at this time,
would ever give way to any designs from which such breaches of Covenant might
ensue: nay our zeal and sincerity for the Covenant and for the settlement of
all things according to it, will be found such, That whatever the Kings
concessions may be to you or us, upon the ratification of a Peace, nothing will
be satisfactory except the whole matter of the Covenant be approved, and the
taking thereof be confirmed and enjoined by Law, not being left Arbitrary or to
come in under an Act of Oblivion; and except also Episcopacie be utterly
extirpated root and branch for ever, whereupon you seem not to stand much at
this present. These things are so unalterably determined in our Councels, and
such fundamental grounds amongst us, that it is not possible that those Advices
by which your men are acted, can have had either their beginning, or ever will
have their approbation from us, or from any that are faithful to us, such as
we know the Marquess of Argile to be.

As for the other pretense, That this undertaking of your Army is done by our
example in these our last troubles: It is a most notorious falsehood, and a most
injurious calumny against us. For which cause I think my self bound to let you
see the contrary, and how far our actions differ from that which is related of
your Army.

Be pleased therefore to take notice, that in all our late proceedings, the
Party well-affected to the Covenant, who were disaffected to the Engagement,
never made any violent or tumultuous opposition against the Councels of the
Parliament; but whiles matters were in deliberation, the greatest part of the
people of this Kingdom petitioned only against the designs of the major part
of Parliament, which did pursue an Engagement against England, contrary to the
Covenant and Treaties: And when the thing was brought to a result, the
well-affected Members of Parliament dissented and protested (according to the
practice of this Kingdom) against the engagement. Nor did the well-affected
here make ever any opposition to the Parliament it self (whose Authority is
sacred and supreme amongst us) whiles they carried on matters which they had
resolved. Nor was there any opposition made to the councels of the Committee of
Estates nor ever any wrong offered to them in their persons; but all the
opposition which was made, was afterward made against a few persons of the
Committee of Estates, whose illegal proceedings and actual oppression being
intolerable, they were resisted not only in a way justifiable by the necessity
of natural defense, but even conformable to the Law of the Land.

Concerning the Persons which the Parliament nominated to be a Committee of
Estates, they were above an hundred; but when the Parliament was ended, Nine of
those alone were packt to make a Quorum, which could meet at all occasions, and
did overruled the whole Kingdom most illegally and tyrannically.

First their illegal proceedings were such, That contrary to all Law they took
upon them to impede the execution of Acts of Parliament; a power never given
unto them, nor that could be committed unto any, (for how can it be supposed
that ever any Parliament would, or lawfully could give to Deputies a power to
alter or suspend the Laws of the Kingdom and standing Acts of Parliament?)
They caused diverse Subjects to take the Oath ex Officio, A thing wholly
contrary to the Laws of this Kingdom. They gave Order to denounce the
Marquess of Argile Rebel before any charge given in against him, and other
things of this nature were done by them to others whom they did process for
Treason, upon a general accusation, without setting down the particulars, and
without producing any accusers, which even the abetters of their own
Counselors were ashamed of.

Secondly, Their actual Oppressions were such, that they caused Soldiers to
quarter upon the well-affected, with so much cruelty, as that in the space of
fourteen days they exacted in some places to the value of seven years rent; by
which means some families were dissolved and ruined, yea they killed women
that resisted their insolent and unruly carriages, and offered violence to
Ministers preaching in the Pulpit, interrupting Divine-Worship. All which was
done without any hope of redress, when petitioned against; yet this was
endured with much patience a long while, till all hope of redress was lost;
and till that packt Quorum begun to raise new Forces, whereby to oppress this
kingdom, and reinforce their wicked engagement a-against England. For although
they pretended in their Declaration to the Kingdom, that their going into
England was in pursuance of the ends of the Covenant, to preserve Religion and
keep the Union between the Kingdoms, yet they gave then Commissions to such as
had been eminently active in the Rebellion, under the conduct of the late Earl
of Montrose, which was not only contrary to express Acts of Parliament, but a
design utterly destructive to all the well-affected of this Kingdom, by the
arming of their deadly enemies against them; whereupon they were constrained to
look unto themselves, and stand upon their lawful defense.

Thus I have briefly opened, what the high tyranny, oppression and usurpation
of power, was in a few men of this Kingdom, above and against all laws civil
and natural which necessitated the honest Party to betake themselves unto the
just ways of defense which the Laws of this Land allow, and the natural
rights of all men do provide for them in such cases, which how they made use
of, and how the blessing of God has been upon them in their legal
Proceedings, I shall now add, that as by what I have said, you may see the
disterence of Authority and Government, which is between your Parliament and
our nine Committee Men. So by what I shall say, you may also see the way of
acting, which our well-affected Party here did take, and how far it differs
from the way wherein your Army has set it self to walk.

To this effect you must know, that the standing Laws of this Kingdom lately
confirmed, when the King was last with us in Parliament, have provided a remedy
for public grievances, when they are come to the extremity, and otherwise
fail; which is this, that the Subjects of this Kingdom may meet together in
cases of eminent danger, for the Preservation of their Religion, Laws and
Liberties, and the Public good of the Kirk and State. These are the words of
the Law. Therefore when matters were brought to this pass that I have told,
when many of the Committee of Estates were Prisoners in England, and some that
were at home did abuse their power, to the destruction of this Kingdom, and
the disturbance of the peace and union between the two Kingdoms: the question
was moved, whether or no the well-affected ought not to meet to provide for the
safety of the Kingdom, of their Laws and Liberties, seeing not only the Law
did allow them so to do in such like cases of danger, but besides natural
right, the National Covenant did bind them expressly to assist each other, in
maintaining and promoting the ends of their Covenant against all lets and
impediments whatsoever; the answer to this question being clear and easy, and
the practice of meeting in such occasions being ordinary in former times,
besides those of the Nobility, who had protested in Parliament against the
engagement; the Commissioners of diverse Shires and Burrowes did meet also as
formerly they had done in the like distress in the year 1637 and 38 and 39.
These Noblemen and Commissioners being thus met, and accompanied with a
considerable number of the Gentry and Yeomanry, went toward Edinburgh, the
place unto which the Lord Chancellor and others of the Committee of Estates
were summoned to meet by a Quorum of the Committee that were for the
engagement. These Lords and Commissioners therefore went as by the Law they
were allowed, and by their Shires and Buroughs they were directed for redress
of their Grievances. The Gentry and Yeomanry went as by their Covenant they
were bound to protect and defend with all their might their Commissioners in
pursuance of the ends of the Covenant, in case they should be assaulted or
wronged by those who were in arms against them. And the Noblemen went in
obedience to a Summons from the Committee of Estates, whereof themselves were
the principal members; when these came to Edinburgh at the day appointed, the
packt Quorum being conscious of their own guilt, durst not stay for them, but
speedily removed themselves out of the way, keeping neither day nor place which
themselves had appointed; yet this was no prejudice to the Authority residing
in the Committee of Estates appointed by Parliament, as if thereby it were
dissolved, because in this Realm the power of acting as a Committee does not
at any time depend upon the precise keeping of appointments, but only upon the
full number of the Quorum, nor at this time was there any wanting of the number
to make a Quorum, although those that had abused their power were retired. And
because the Lord Chancellor (who by virtue of his place may at any time call
the Committee of Estates) did call a Quorum of the Committee, by which all the
public businesses have been since managed, no Authority was dissolved; In all
this it is most evident, that the well-affected party in this Kingdom did
nothing presumptuously, but every thing regularly and justly; having for every
step of their proceeding, not only the warrant of a Law, but the allowed
practices of former times to lead them: Nor did they any Act of violence unto
the Members of the Committee of Estates, although they had been violently
assaulted and oppressed, they only defended themselves against those that were
in Arms against them; They came together to consult and redress matters out
of course, that the Kingdom might be preserved from ruin, and they made use
of their power to none other end, but to pursue and maintain their Covenant
with England in avoiding a war with it, by causing the forces raised against
it, to be disbanded, and the Garrisons detained from it to be restored, and for
the settlement of the Council of State, without all appearance of usurpation.
And least those who did retire from Edinburgh, (where now the Committee sits,)
should think themselves, or be looked upon by others, as excluded and deprived
by mere force from the right which the Parliament gave them to sit in the
Committee of Estates, therefore a friendly Treaty was entertained with them; at
which upon consideration of preventing a war with England, (which otherwise
seemed unavoidable,) they were rationally induced and considerately declared
themselves content to forbear the use of their right of coming to the
Committed of Estates, and the exercise of all public trust and to leave the
mannaging of the public affairs to such of the Committee, as had not been
accessory to the Engagement: And to refer all differences to a Parliament, to
be called betwixt that and the 10. of January, according to the power granted
to the Committee of Estates by the Parliament, to call a Parliament when ever
they should think fit, by which transaction you see that the just Authority of
Government is not only regularly but voluntarily, devolved upon those that
now manage it, and Providence did so order it, that this transaction fell out
near about the time when the Commissioners of Parliament, were to be chosen and
changed of course, according to the Laws and constant Practice of this
Kingdom, which is every year at Michaelmas, whether there be a Parliament to
sit or not.

Here then you see what that proceeding is, upon which the pretense of an
example to be taken from us is grounded, and what appearance there is (...) any
such ground; here all the Practices of our well-affected Party are necessary
and commendable in all circumstances, and most warrantable by all the Laws of
God and man in this land, as well Natural as Civil and Ecclesiastical, here
all particular grievances are referred by all sides to be determined by a free
Parliament, here all the fundamental Laws are entirely preserved, here every
thing has been carried openly and professedly from the beginning to the end
above board, without any subtle undermining practices, and here the least
offer is not made by any for the faults of some to change and alter the frame
of Government in the whole.

By all which if you consider matters ingenuously, I suppose you will say that
nothing will be found in your case, parallel unto ours, almost in any
circumstance. For if matters are carried amongst you, as you intimate and
others inform us, and as by some papers may be conjectured, they are or will
be shortly; I dare sadly prognosticate your fate, that you will have the most
disorderly and confused State, that is this day in the world; your condition
will be worse then ours; for though we were sadly oppressed and wickedly
involved into an unjust engagement against England to our own confusion, yet
the authors of our ruin were those that had some stamp of authority lawfully
conferred upon them, and there were laws known and ways practiceable, and
Instruments in a readiness to redress their exorbitances; but if you fall
under the power of those that are so far from having right to authority that
they can have no true stamp but that of servants, woe be unto you; the men that
did disorder us, were yet men of some sense and reason, although they did drive
their designs to the utmost furiously; but no fury is like that of a combined
unreasonable multitude, whose interest is to have no rule standing; what your
laws are to find a redress, or what ways you may have practiceable, and
what Instruments to follow them for your good, I am not capable to judge; but
this I may guess, that the Leaders of your Army and their Agitat^rs that lie
under deck, having gone so far, will not cease, and in all likelihood will
resolve to stick at nothing that may stand in their way of racing the present
foundations that they may stand alone. The old Maxim of Caesar is sad one. Si
violandum est jus, Regnandi causa violandum est, in caeteris Pietatem colito,
When men have not the fear of God before their eyes it is natural for them to
deifie themselves, and whatever they imagine then subordinate to that end which
they have set up to themselves and for themselves as best and supreme, they
think that only good and lawful, and every thing else abominable; upon this
ground they will easily dispense with themselves and their consciences, to do
evil that good may come of it. And because the good which they seem to aim
at, is a Libertine (not properly Government, but) correspondencie and equality
that they will sacrifice, (if they be true to their Principles,) all matters of
Rule and Order, both divine and humane, and all Obligations and engagements,
both natural, moral and conscionable unto this Idol; And in so doing they
will think themselves not only justifyable but glorious; And because the way
of power is only left unto them, to compass their glorious designs, they will
think all lawful, what can be done that way, and the more glory due to
themselves, the more they can crush others; but I pray God these Predictions
may never prove true in those men, whom you know I have truly counted worthy of
esteem, and for whose miscarriages I should be much afflicted in many respects,
partly for their great and many good parts, partly for their deserts in a good
cause, and the honor they have merited hitherto of all the well-affected
thereunto, and particularly of us here of late in Scotland, which I would not
have them stain with any disorderlinesse; partly, and especially, lest their
miscariages in this kind give the greatest wound unto Religion that can be
given by any in this age. This would grieve me to the heart. And when I think
on what I begin to see and hear from you and others, and remember that they are
but men as others, I tremble at the presages of my grief.

But these sad and passionate considerations do make this Letter too big, and
have made me almost forget the Parallel which I was about to make, or rather to
leave unto you to make, if any such thing can be found between the late
proceedings of our Worthies here, and the present undertakings of your Army
there.

For whether your consider the persons that are Actors in the business on both
sides, here and there; or the Actions which they undertake; or the way and
manner of their proceeding therein; or the things which they professedly aim
at; or the means which they use to bring the same to pass: I am sure there
will be nothing found in our men that has any resemblance to yours, and
consequently nothing that can give them an example for what they do, or any
ground in comparison with us to alter your State.

The persons who acted with authority our affairs here on the one side, were a
Quorum of nine Committee Men; and those that have right to authority among you,
are none but the Parliament: And what difference there is between that great
body of Representatives, and our Nine men, judge ye. On the other side, here
the Actors were the Peers and Noblemen of the Kingdom, joined with the
Commissioners of Shires and Buroughs, whom the Covenanters protected from
danger, as they were bound to do; And the Actors on the other side with you,
are the Officers and Soldiers of your Army. Now what difference there is in
the right of the one and the other to act in cases of public grievance against
those that are in Authority, judge ye by what I have formerly laid concerning
our Laws, and by this, That no Soldiers or Army in the world can have any
right or lawful calling before God or the world, either to be together, or to
act in any thing otherwise then as they are the Servants of those that have
chosen them to be an Army, which is with you the Parliament. Our Noblemen,
Commissioners, and Covenanters acted defensively according to Law, for the
redress of disorders ruinous to the State: but your Army is in a way of acting
offensively without Law and against trust, which is a ruinous disorder to the
State.

The undertaking of our Nine men, was the pursuit of an Engagement opposite to
the Covenant and Treaties with England, oppressive to all the faithful in the
Land, and destructive to the peace of the Kingdom and union betwixt the
Kingdom: but the undertaking of your Parliament was the pursuit of peace by a
Personal Treaty with the King which by his condiscensions was in some things
brought toward a hopeful issue.

What the difference is between these two, judge ye; and thereupon consider
what resemblance there is between the opposition which our Nobles and
Commissioners made unto the proceedings of our Quorum, and the resistance which
your Army does make against the Votes of their Masters the Houses of
Parliament, tending to the settlement of Peace in the Kingdom. As for the
manner of our men's proceedings, I have showed you how patiently they endured
oppression, how they never disturbed the Parliaments counsels, nor of the
Committee of Estates, nor offered violence to their persons, but by regular
addresses sought the redresses of grievances, and by a Treaty did obtain the
same. Whether your Army has suffered any oppression from the Parliament, or
have had any ill usage from them, your know better then I that am a stranger;
but I never heard of any: And what the way of their addresses are, I need not
to express; you can judge; and I will not conjecture what hereafter they may
be.

The professed aim of the well-affected party here, is the same which it was
formerly, To settle the Kingdom in the observance of the Covenant, of the
Treaties with England, and of the known Laws and constitutions of Government.
What the aim of your Army is, and how constant they are to the Proposals which
formerly they made, and where they will rest, I shall leave it to you to judge,
and to the event to show.

The means which our men used to prosecute their aim, were a friendly Treaty
to lay down Arms on all sides, To settle and maintain the just Authority of
Government, To right the wrong done to England, and to call a free Parliament.
Now, what resemblance the ways of your men have with these, judge ye; And then
tell me where the pretended example is, and wherein the comparison can be made
between that which we have done, and that which your men are doing: If it can
be showed in any circumstance, or made imaginable to any rational man, I shall
acknowledge my ignorance.

My admiration at a pretense so far out of purpose, and so injuriously
reproachful to our Cause, together with my zeal to vindicate the reputation
of our smeerity by the Righteousness of our proceedings, has moved me to the
thus large.

All the ground upon which we can challenge a right to be trusted and believed
in that which we do or say, that our meaning is upright and without deceit, can
be no other but the justifiablenesse of our carriage in our constant way, that
it is orderly in our Calling, and answerable to a known Rule. But if we keep no
Rule, or cast off all respect unto that Rule which we are bound to acknowledge,
and which we have obliged our selves to walk by; and if our enterprises are
disproportionate to our Calling, and to the principles of our profession in
Christianity; then we may justly be suspected to be deceivers, and not mean
truly whatever we pretend.

Therefore he that is nowhere to be found constant in his pretenses, nor in his
Rules known, can deserve no trust, nor can he be rationally judged to be
sincere; because he will naturally shape his Rule according to his Pretenses,
and not his Pretenses according to that which is a true Rule. He that walks by
a Rule, denies himself, and comes to the light thereof, that he may be judged:
But he that has no Rule, but pretends only now this, and then that, does seek
himself and is a deceiver, who shunneth the light, although he may pretend
never so much New-light. It is a sad thing to see men whom in charity we could
not but judge conscionable, after great professions and pretensions to the
Spirit in the beginning, to fall flat and end wholly in the flesh. The Lord
keep us from this temptation, and let him that stands take heed lest he fall.

I can scarce break off from these troublesome thoughts, but they are not so
pleasing to me that I should delight to lengthen them: Therefore I shall now
rest and bid you Farewell, who am --
