Veni Creator.
COme holy Ghost, eternal God,
proceeding from above,
Both from the Father and the Son,
the God of peace and love.
^t our minds, and into us,
thy heavenly grace inspire:
That in all truth and godliness
^e may have true desire.
Thou art the very comforter
^^all woe and distress:
The heavenly gift of God most high,
which no tongue can express:
^^e fountain and the lively spring
of joy celestial:
The fire so bright, the love so clear,
^^d unction spiritual.
Thou in thy gifts art manifold,
thereby Christ's church does stand:
(...) ^ithful hearts writing thy law,

^^u give speech of grace:
(...) through thy help the praise of God
^y stand in every place.
(...) Ghost, into our wits
^^d down thy heavenly light:
(...) our hearts with fervent love,
(...) serve God day and night.
^^gth and ^^ablish all our weakness,
^^^eeble and so frail:
(...) neither flesh, the world, nor devil
^unst us do prevail.
^^ack our enemies far from us,
(...) grant us to obtain
(...) in our hearts with God and man,
^^out grudge of disdain.
(...) grant, O Lord, that thou being
(...) leader and our guide,
^^y eschew the snares of sin,
(...) from thee never slide.
(...) such plenty of thy grace,
^od Lord, grant we thee pray,
^^^thou may be our comforter
^^e last dreadful day.
(...) strife and distention,
Lord, dissolve the bands;
(...) ^ake the knots of peace and love
^^^ghout all Christian lands.
^t us, O Lord, through thee to know
(...) Father most of might:
(...) of his dear beloved Son
^ay attain the fight:
(...) that with perfect says also
^ay acknowledge thee,
(...) Spirit of them both always,
(...) God in persons three.

The humble suit of a sinner. M.
(...) Lord of whom I do depend,
behold my careful heart:
(...) then thy will and pleasure is,
^^^se me of my smart.
(...) see my sorrows what they are,
(...) grief is known to thee:
^^^cere is none that can remove,
^^^ke the same from me;
^^ly thou whose aid I crave,
^^^se mercy still is pressed
(...) all those that come to thee
^^^ccour and for rest.
(...) thou see my restless eyes,
(...) ^ars and grievous groan;
(...) unto my suit. O Lord.
^^is well my plaint and moan.
(...) has so enclosed me,
^^^^past me about,
^^^m now ren^ediless,
^^^cy help not out.
^^^^ral man cannot release,
(...) gate this pain:
(...) thy Christ, my Lord and God,
(...) my sins was slain.
(...) bloody wounds are yet to see,
^^gh not with mortal eye:
(...) thy saints behold them all,
(...) I trust shall I.
(...) sin does hinder me a while,
(...) thou shall see it good
I shall enjoy the sight of him,
and see his wounds and blood.
And as thine angels and thy saints
do now behold the same:
So trust I to possess that place,
with them to praise thy name.
But whilst I live here in this vale
where sinners do frequent,
Assist me ever with thy grace,
my sins still t^ lament.
Lest that I tread the sinners trace,
and give them my consent
To dwell with them in wickedness,
whereto nature is bent.
Only thy grace must be my stay,
lest that I fall down flat:
And being down, then of my self
cannot recover that.
Wherefore this is yet once again
my suit and my request,
To grant me pardon for my sin,
that I in thee may rest.
Then shall my heart and tongue also
be instruments of praise,
And in thy Church and house of Saints
sing psalms to thee always.
Venite exultemus. Psalm. xcv.
O Come and let us now rejoice,
And sing unto the Lord,
And to our only Savior
Also with one accord.
O let us come before his face
With inward reverence,
Confessing all our former sins,
And that with diligence.
To thank him for his benefits
Always distributing:
Wherefore to him right joyfully
In psalms now let us sing.
And that because that God alone
Is Lord magnificent,
And eke above all other gods
A King omnipotent.
His people does not he forsake
At any time or tide:
And in his hands are all the coasts,
Of all the world so wide.
And with his loving countenance
He looks every where,
And does behold the tops of all
The mountains far and near.
The sea and all that is therein
Are his, for he them made:
And eke his hand has fashioned
The earth which does not fade.
O come therefore and worship him,
And down before him fall:
And let us kneel before the Lord,
The which has made us all.
He is our God, our Lord, and King,
And we his people are,
His flock and sheep of his pasture,
Of whom he takes care.
This day if ye will hear his voice,
Then harden not your heart,
As in the bitter murmuring,
When ye were in desert.
Which thing was of their negligence
Committed in the time
Of trouble in the wilderness,
A great and grievous crime.
Whereas your fathers tempted me
And tried me every way:
They proved me, and saw my works,
What I could do or say.
These forty years I have been grieved
With this same generation:
And evermore I said, they erred
In their imagination:
Wherewith their hearts were sore cumbred
Long time and many days:
Wherefore I said, Assuredly
They have not known my ways.
To whom I in my anger swore,
That they should not be blessed,
Nor see my joy celestial,
Nor enter in my rest.
Gloria Patri.
All laud and praise, be to thee, Lord,
O that of might art most,
To God the Father, and the Son,
And to the holy Ghost.
As it in the beginning was
For ever heretofore,
And is now at this present time,
And shall be evermore.
The song of S. Ambrose, called Te Deum.
WE praise thee, God, we knowledge thee
the only Lord to be;
And as eternal Father, all
the earth does worship thee.
To thee all Angels cry, the heavens
and all the powers therein:
To thee Cherub and Seraphin
to cry they do not sin,
O holy, holy, holy Lord,
of Sabbath Lord the God;
Through heaven and earth thy praise is spread
and glory all abroad.
The Apostles glorious company
yield praises unto thee:
The prophets goodly fellowship
praise thee continually.
The noble and victorious host
of Martyrs sound thy praise:
The holy Church throughout the world
does knowledge thee always.
Father of endless Majesty
they do acknowledge thee:
Thy Christ thine honorable, true,
and only Son to be,
The holy Ghost the comforter.
Of glory thou art King,
O Christ, and of the Father art
the Son everlasting.
When sinful man's decay in hand
thou tookest to restore,
To be in closed in virgins womb
thou did not abhor.
When thou had overcome of death
the sharp and cruel might,
Thou heavens kingdom did set open
to each believing wight.
In glory of the Father thou
do ^it on Gods right hand:
We trust that thou shall come our Judge
our cause to understand.
Lord, help thy servants whom thou have
bought with thy precious blood,
And in eternal glory set
them with thy Saints so good.
O Lord, do thou thy people save,
bless thine inheritance:
Lord, govern them, and, Lord, do thou
for ever them advance.
We magnify thee day by day,
and world without an end
Adore thy holy name: O Lord,
vouchsafe us to defend
From sin this day: have mercy, Lord,
have mercy on us all:
And on us, as we trust in thee,
Lord, let thy mercy fall.
O Lord, I have reposed all
my confidence in thee:
Put to confounding shame therefore
Lord, let me never be.

The song of Zacharias, called Benedictus.
THe only Lord of Israel
Be praised evermore:
For through his visitation
And mercy kept in store,
His people now he has redeemed,
That long have been in thrall:
And spread abroad his saving health
Upon his servants all.
In David's house his servant true,
According to his mind,
And also his anointed King,
As we in Scripture find.
As by his holy Prophets all,
Oft-times he did declare,
The which were since the world began,
His ways for to prepare.
That we might be delivered
From those that make debate,
Our enemies, and from the hands
Of all that do us hate.
The mercy which he promised
Our fathers to fulfill,
And think upon his Covenant made
According to his will.
And also to perform the Oath
Which he before had sworn
To Abraham our father dear,
For us that were forlorn:
That he would give himself for us,
And us from bondage bring
Out of the hands of all our foes,
To serve our heavenly King:
And that without all manner fear,
And eke in righteousness:
And also for to lead our lives
In sted fast holiness.
And thou, O Child, which now art born
And of the Lord elect,
Shall be the Prophet of the Highest,
His ways for to direct.
For thou shall go before his face
For to prepare his ways,
And also for to teach his will
And pleasure all thy days.
To give them knowledge how that their
Salvation is near:
And that remission of their sins
Is through his mercy mere.
Whereby the dayspring from on high.
Is come us for to visit,
And those for to illuminate
Which do in darkness sit.
To lighten those that shadowed be
With death, and eke oppressed:
And also for to guide our feet
The way to peace and rest.
The Song of blessed Mary, called Magnificat.
MY soul does magnify the Lord,
My spirit eke evermore
Rejoices in the Lord my God,
Which is my Savior.
And why? because he did regard,
And gave respect unto
So base estate of his handmaid,
And let the mighty go.
For now behold all nations
And generations all,
From this time forth for evermore
Shall me right blessed call:
Because he has me magnified,
Which is the Lord of might;
Whose name be ever sanctified,
And praised day and night.
For with his mercy and his grace
All men he does inflame,
Throughout all generations
To such as fear his name.
He showed strength with his great arm,
And made the proud to start,
With all imaginations
That they beat in their heart.
He has put down the mighty ones
From their supernal feat,
And did exalt the meek in heart,
As he has thought it meet.
The hungry he replenished
With all things that were good,
And through his power he made the rich
Oft-times to want their food.
And calling to rememberance
His mercy every deal,
Has helped up assistantly
His servant Israel:
According to his promise made
To Abraham before,
And to his seed successively,
To stand for evermore.
The song of Simeon, called Nunc dimittis.
O Lord, because my hearts desire
Has wished long to see
My only Lord and Savior,
Thy Son before I die:
The joy and health of all mankind,
Desired long before,
Which now is come into the world,
Of mercy bringing store:
Thou suffer thy servant now
In peace for to depart,
According to thy holy Word,
Which lighteneth my heart.
Because mine eyes which thou have made
To give my body light,
Have now beheld thy saving health,
Which is the Lord of might.
Whom thou mercifully have set,
Of thine abundant grace,
In open sight and visible
Before all peoples face,
The Gentiles to illuminate,
And Satan overquel,
And eke to be the glory of
Thy people Israel,
The Symbol or Creed of Athanasius, called Quicunque vult.
WHat man soever he be that
salvation will attain,
The Catholic belief he must
before all things retain.
Which faith unless he wholly keep,
and undefiledly,
Without all doubt eternally
he shall be sure to die.
The Catholic belles is this,
that God we worship one
In Trinity, and Trinity
in Unity alone:
So as we neither do confound
the persons of the three,
Nor yet the substance whole of one
in sunder parted be,
One Person of the father is,
another of the Son,
Another Person proper of
the holy Ghost alone.
Of Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
but one the Godhead is:
Like Glory, coeternal eke
The Majesty likewise.
Such as the Father is, such is
the Son in each degree:
And such also we do believe
the holy Ghost to be.
Uncreate is the father, and
uncreate is the Son,
The holy Ghost uncreate, so
uncreate is each one.
Incomprehensible Father is,
incomprehensible Son,
And comprehensible also is
the holy Ghost of none.
The Father is eternal, and
the Son eternal so,
And in like sort eternal is
the holy Ghost also,
And yet though we believe that each
of th^se eternal be:
Yet there but one Eternal is,
and not Eternals three.
As ne incomprehensible we,
he yet uncreate three,
But one incomprehensible, one
uncreate hold to be.
Almighty so the Father is,
the Son Almighty so,
And in like sort Almighty is
the holy Ghost also.
And albeit that every one
of these Almighty be;
Yet there but one Almighty is,
And not Almighties three.
The Father God is, God the Son,
God holy Ghost also:
Yet are there not three Gods in all,
but one God, and no mo.
So likewise Lord the Father is,
and Lord also the Son,
And Lord the holy Ghost: yet are
there not three Lords, but one.
For as we are compelled to grant
by Christian verity,
Each of the persons by himself
both God and Lord to be:
So Catholic religion
forbids us always,
That either Gods be three, or that
there Lords be three, to say.
Of none the Father is, ne made,
ne create, nor begot:
The Son is of the Father, not
create, ne made, but got:
The holy Ghost is of them both,
the Father and the Son;
Ne made, ne create, nor begot,
but does proceed alone.
So we one Father hold, not three,
one Son also, not three,
One holy Ghost alone, and not
three holy Ghosts to be.
None in this Trinity before
nor after other is:
Ne greater any then the rest,
ne lesser be likewise.
But every one among themselves
of all the Persons three,
Together coeternal all,
and all coequal be,
So Unity in Trinity,
as said it is before,
And Trinity in Unity
in all things we adore.
Therefore what man soever that
salvation will attain,
This faith touching the Trinity
of force he must retain.
And needful to eternal life
it is, that every wight
Of the incarnating of Christ
our Lord believe aright.
For this the right faith is, that we
believe and eke do know,
That Christ our Lord the Son of God
is God and man also:
God of his Fathers substance got
before the world began,
And of his Mothers substance born
in world a very man.
Both perfect God and perfect Man
in one, one Jesus Christ:
That does of reasonable soul
and humane flesh subsist.
Touching his Godhead, equal with
his Father God is he:
Touching his Manhood, lower then
his father in degree.
Who though he be both very God
and very man also,
Yet is he but one Christ alone,
and is not persons two.
One, not by turning of Godhead
into the flesh of man;
But by taking manhood to God,
this being one began.
All one, not by confounding of
the substance into one;
But only by the Unity
that is of one Person.
For as the reasonable soul
and flesh but one man is:
So in one Person God and Man
is but one Christ likewise.
Who suffered for to save us all,
to hell he did descend:
The third day rose again from death,
to heaven he did ascend.
He sits at the right hand of God
The Almighty Father there:
From thence to judge the quick and dead
again he shall appear.
At whose return all men shall rise
with bodies new restored,
And of their own works they shall give
account unto the Lord.
And they into eternal life
shall go that have done well:
Who have done ill, shall go into
eternal fire to dwell.
This is the Catholic belief:
who does not faithfully
Believe the same, without all doubt
he saved cannot be.
To Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
all glory be therefore:
As in beginning was, is now,
and shall be evermore.
The Lamentation of a sinner.
O Lord, turn not away thy face
From him that lies prostrate,
Lamenting sore his sinful life
Before thy mercy gate.
Which gate thou openest wide to those
That do lament their sin.
Shut not that gate against me, Lord,
But let me enter in.
And call me not to mine account
How I have lived here:
For then I know right well, O Lord,
How vile I shall appear.
I need not to confess my life,
I am sure thou can tell:
What I have been, and what I am,
I know thou know it well.
O Lord, thou know what things be past,
And eke the things that be:
Thou know also what is to come,
Nothing is hid from thee.
Before the heavens and earth were made,
Thou know what things were then,
As all things else that have been since
Among the sons of men.
And can the things that I have done
Be hidden from thee then?
Nay, nay, thou know them all, O Lord,
Where they were done, and when.
Wherefore with tears I come to thee
To beg and to entreat,
Even as the child that has done ill,
And fears to be beat.
So come I to thy mercy gate,
Where mercy does abound,
Requiring mercy for my sin,
To heal my deadly wound.
O Lord, I need not to repeat
What I do beg or crave:
Thou know, O Lord, before I ask
The thing that I would have.
Mercy, good Lord, mercy I ask,
This is the total sum:
For mercy, Lord, is all my suit,
Lord, let thy mercy come.
The Lords Prayer, or Pater noster.
OUr father which in heaven art,
Lord. Hallowed be thy Name.
Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done
in earth, even as the same
In heaven is. Give us, O Lord,
our daily bread this day.
As we forgive our debtors, so
forgive our debts we pray.
Into temptation lead us not,
from evil make us free.
For kingdom, power, and glory thine,
both now and ever be.
The X Commandments. Audi Israel. Exodus 20.
Hark Israel, and what I say
give heed to understand;
I am the Lord thy God that brought
thee out of Egypt land,
Even from the house wherein thou did
in thraldom live a slave.
None other gods at all, before
my presence shall thou have.
No manner graven image shall
thou make at all to thee;
Nor any figure like by thee
shall counterfeited be,
Of any thing in heaven above,
nor in the earth below,
Nor in the waters beneath the earth:
to them thou shall no: bow,
Nor shall them serve: the Lord thy God,
a jealous God am I,
That punish parents faults unto
the third and fourth degree,
Upon their children that me hate:
and mercy do display
To thousands of such as me love,
and my precepts obey.
The Name thou of the Lord thy God
in vain shall never use:
For him that takes his Name in vain
the Lord will not excuse.
Remember that thou holy keep
the sacred sabbath day:
Six days thou labor shall and do
Thy needful works always.
The seventh day is set by the Lord
thy God to rest upon;
No work then shall thou do in it,
ne thou, nor yet thy son,
Thy daughter, servant, nor thy maid,
thine ox, nor yet thine ass,
Nor stranger that within thy gates
has his abiding-place:
For in six days God heaven and earth,
and all therein did make,
And after those his rest he did
upon the seventh day take.
Wherefore he blessed the day that he
for resting did ordain,
And sacred to himself alone
appointed to remain.
Yield honor to thy Parents, that
prolonged thy days may be
Upon the land the which the Lord
thy God has given thee.
Thou shall not murder. Thou shall not
commit adultery.
Thou shall not steal. Nor witness false
against thy neighbor be.
Thou shall not covet house that to
thy neighbor does belong:
Ne covet shall in having of
his wife to do him wrong,
Nor his manservant, nor his maid,
nor ox, nor ass, of his,
Nor any other thing that to
thy neighbor proper is.
The complaint of a Sinner.
WHere righteousness does say,
Lord, for my sinful part,
In wrath thou should me pay
Vengeance for my desert:
I can it not deny,
But needs I must confess
How that continually
Thy laws I do transgress,
But if it be thy will
With sinners to contend,
Then all thy flock shall spill,
And be lost without end.
For who lives here so right,
That rightly he can say,
He sins not in thy sight
Full often and every day? Full often, etc.
The Scripture plain tells me,
The righteous man offends
Seven times a day to thee,
Whereon thy wrath depends:
So that the righteous man
Does walk in no such path,
But he falls now and then
In danger of thy wrath, In danger, etc.
Then since the case so stands,
That even the man right wife
Falls often in sinful hands,
Whereby thy wrath mayrise;
Lord, I that am unjust,
And righteousness none have,
Whereto then shall I trust
My sinful soul to save, My sinful, etc.
But truly to that post
Whereto I cleave and shall,
Which is thy mercy most?
Lord, let thy mercy fall,
And mitigate thy mood,
Or else we perish all.
The price of this thy blood,
Wherein mercy I call, Wherein, etc.
The Scripture does declare
No drop of blood in thee,
But that thou did not spare
To shed each drop for me.
Now let those drops most sweet
So moist my heart so dry,
That I with sin replete,
May live, and sin may die, May live, etc.
That being mortified
This sin of mine in me,
I may be sanctified
By grace of thine in thee:
So that I never fall
Into such mortal sin,
That my so^s infernal
Rejoice my death therein, Rejoice my, etc.
But vouchsafe me to keep
From those infernal foes,
And from that lake so deep,
Whereas no mercy grows.
And I shall sing the songs
Consirm^d with the just,
That unto thee belongs
Which art my only trust, Which art, etc.

T. S.

I trust in God, and hope that he

As men do prove their gold with fire,
my reins and heart espy.

I durst behold always:
For of thy truth I tread the trace,
and will do all my days.

with men whose deeds are vain:
To come in house I do refuse
with the deceitful train.

their deeds I do despise:
I do not once to them resort
that hurtful things devise.

Then to thine altar I make speed,
to offer there in sight.

And so declare how wondrous ways
thou have been good to me.

Wherefore to God will I give praise

For which I pray, and will desire

To see the beauty of his face,

And keep me secret by his side,

With psalms and songs I will apply

Have mercy, Lord, on me oppressed,

I sue to have thy grace:
Then seek my face, say thou to me;

Thou art my help still to this day,

And then the Lord himself yet took

For fear of such as watch for me,

ALl laud and praise with heart and voice,
O Lord, I give to thee,
Which did not make my foes rejoice,
but have exalted me.

Thou gay'st an ear, and did provide
to ease me with relief.

Thou did revive when strength did lack,
and kept'st me from the grave.

In memory of his majesty

But in his favor and his grace

Though gripes of grief and pangs full sore

The Lord to joy shall us restore

Tush, I am sure to feel none ill,
this wealth shall not decay.

But when thou turn'dst away thy face,
my mind was sore dismayed.

to thee, O Lord of might:
My God with plaints I did apply,
and prayed both day and night.

if death destroy my days?
Does dust declare thy majesty,
or yet thy truth does praise?

O Lord, I thee desire:
Do not this simple soul forsake

My Lord my God, to thee will I

J. H.
O Lord, I put my trust in thee,
let nothing work me shame:
As thou art just, deliver me,
and let me quit from blame.

Be thou my rock and house of stone,
my fence in time of need.

thou art my sort and tower:
For thy Names sake be thou my guide,
and lead me in thy power.

which they for me have laid:
Thou art my strength, and all my care
is for thy might and aid.

my spirit which is thy due:
For why? thou have redeemed it,
O Lord my God most true.

from things to be abhorred:
When they on trifles set their heart,
my trust is in the Lord.

I see it does excel:
Thou see when ought would me annoy,
and know my soul full well.

that would me overcharge:
But thou have set me out of band,
to walk abroad at large.
The second part.

Mine eyes wax dim, my sight does fail,
my womb for woe does ache.

my years in woe are past,
My strength is gone, and through disdain
my bones corrupt and waste.

my friends are all dismayed:
My neighbors and my kinsmen born
to see me are afraid.

so am I now forgot:
As small effect in me they find
as in a broken pot.

their threats my mind did fray;
How they conspired and went about
to take my life away.

not to be overtrod:
For I confess and still have said,
thou art my Lord and God.

O Lord, is in thy hand:
Defend me from the wrath and rage
of them that me withstand.

and show thy joyful face:
And save me, Lord, for thy goodness,
thy mercy and thy grace.
The third part.

But let the wicked bear the shame,

And cruelly with pride and spite

That fear and trust in thee therefore,

Lo, I was clean cast out of sight,
Yet heard'st thou my request,

And to the proud he does repay

T. S.
THe man is blessed whose wickedness
the Lord has clean remitted:
And he whose sin and wickedness
is hid and also covered.

Which in his heart has hid no guile,
nor fraud is found therein.

in silence and constraint,
My bones did wear and waste away
with daily moan and plaint.

so grievous was and smart,
That all my blood and humors moist
to dryness did convert.

and all my sins discover:
Then thou, O Lord, did me forgive,
and all my sins pass over.

So that the floods of waters great

But unto him that trusts in God

And ye of pure and perfect heart,

Exultate justi. Psalm. xxxiii.
J. H.
YE righteous in the Lord rejoice;

That upright men with thankful voice

With lute and instrument among

his works and all his ways.

And with his gifts he does delight

the heavens all were wrought:
Their hosts and powers every one

And hid them in the depth to be,
as in an house of store.

Ye that inhabit in each coast,
dread him and stand in aw.

What he does will is brought to pass
with full effect indeed.

He does defeat the multitude
of their device and thought.

The motions of his mind and will

Whom he does choose of mere accord

For he alone does know the thought

The man that of his might does boast

The strength of horse shall not prevail

With such as fear him to offend,

And if that dearth their land oppress,

And let us now exalt his Name

And me delivered incontinent
from all my fear and pain.

Their countenance shall not be dash^,

Who did him hear without delay,

To save all such as fear the Lord,

O happy man that makes him

above all earthly thing:
For they that fear the living Lord,
are sure to lack nothing,

and pined with famine much:
But as for them that fear the Lord,
no lack shall be to such.
The second part.

I shall you teach the perfect way,
how ye the Lord should fear.

Enquire for peace and quietness,
and follow it with speed.

His ears likewise do hear the plaint
of the poor innocent.

upon the wicked train:
And cuts away the memory
that should of them remain.

the Lord does hear them so,
That out of pain and misery
forthwith he lets them go.

He saves also the sorrowful,
the poor and meek in sprite.

But out of all adversities
the Lord does them deliver.

That not so much as one of them

And such as have the righteous man,

And who that put their trust in him,
nothing shall them confound.

J. H.
LOrd, plead my cause against my soes,

^tand up for me, and fight the field,
to help me from distress.

That thou unto my soul may say,
Lo I thy help at hand.

that seek my soul to spill:
^et them turn back and flee with shame,
that think to work me ill.

and that the angel of our God

O Lord, destroythem all:

and in their mischief fall.

The second part.

(...) rid the poor from wicked men,
that spoil and do them wrong.

(...) to accuse me they devise
of things I never knew.

they quit me with disdain:
That they should pay my good with ill,
my soul does sore complain.

and clad my self in sack:
With fasting I did saint full sore,
to pray I was not slack.

I did my self behave:
As one that makes woeful cheer
about his mothers grave.

and gather on a rout:
Yea, abject slaves at me did toy,
with mocks and checks full stout.

that all good things deride,
At me do grin with great disdain,
and pluck their mouths alide.

why do thou stay and pause?
O rid my soul mine only dear,
out of these lions claws.

And where most of the people be,
there will I show thy praise.

which hate me for no fault:
Nor yet to wink or turn their eye,

The third part.

their talk is all untrue:
They still consult and would betray
all those that peace ensue.

Well, well, say they, our eye does see
the thing that we desire.

cease not this gear to mend:
Be not far off, nor me forsake,
as men that sail their friend.

defend me in my right:
Revenge my cause, my Lord, my God,
and aid me with thy might.

my Lord God, set me free:
And let them not their pride express,
nor triumph over me.

There, there, this gear goes trim:
Nor give them cause to say on high,
We have our will on him.

And pay them home with spite and blame,
that brag at me with scorn.

which love mine upright way:
And they all times with heart and voice

To see his servants prosper well;
that is his pleasant sight.

Unto the Lord my God will I

Yet at no hand will he be taught

No wicked ways does he refuse,
nor nothing, that is ill.

So does thy truth it self extend
unto the cloudy sky.

Thy judgement's like to seas most deep,

In trust whereof, as in thy wings,

Of all delights they shall be sped,

And thou shall see with patience

So that the sun even at noonday

Their wicked steps avoid and flee,
and follow not their guise.

But such as trust in him are sure

No not so much as house or place

The second part.

In rest and peace they shall rejoice,
for naught shall them withstand.

against the just conspire:
They gnash their teeth at him, as men
which do his bane desire.

the Lord laughs them to scorn:
For why? he sees their term approach,
when they shall sigh and mourn.

their bow eke have they bent,
To overthrow and kill the poor,
as he the right way went.

which was to kill the just:
Likewise the bow shall break to shivers,
wherein they put their trust.

Then all these lewd and wicked men's
rich pomp and heaped store.

God will it overthrow:
Where contrary he does preserve

And will give them inheritance
which never shall decay.

When others shall be hunger-bit,
they shall be clad and ^ed.

Whereas the just by liberal gifts

And they whom he does curie, likewise

and gives him good success:
To everything he takes in hand
he sends good address.

Because the Lord stretches out his hand
at need, and does not fail.

yet did I never see
The just man left, nor yet his seed
to beg for misery.

and sends whereas is need:
His children and posterity
receive of God their meed.

So God shall grant thee long to have
on earth a dewlling place.

and shows to his such grace,
That he preserves them always,
but 'stroys the wicked race.

inherit shall the land,
Having as lords all things therein
in their own power and hand.

of matters wise and high:
His tongue does talk to edify,
with truth and equity.

his law does still abide:
So that where ever he goes or walks,
his foot can never slide.

the just man does beset,
By all means seeking him to kill,
if he fall in his net.
The fourth part.

yet God would succor send:
Though men against him sentence give,
God would him yet defend.

he shall preservethee then
The earth to rule, and thou shall see
destroyed these wicked men.

Flourishing in all wealth and store,
as does the laurel-tree.

and lo, he was quite gone:
Then I him sought, but could not fi^de

For the just man shall have at length
great joy with rest and peace.

destroyed they shall all be:
God will cut off their budding race,
and rich posterity.

Who in their trouble sends them aid,

And still will save them whilst that they

Domine, ne. Psalm. xxxviii.
J. H.
PUt me not to rebuke, O Lord,
in thy provoked ire:
Ne in thy heavy wrath, O Lord,
correct me I desire.

thy hand does press me sore:
And in my flesh no health at all
appears any more,

thy wrath that I am in:
Nor any rest is in my bones
by reason of my sin.

above my head are gone:
A greater load then I can bear,
they lie me sore upon.

as loathsome is to see:
Which all through mine own foolishness
betideth unto me.

in trouble and distress:
That I go wailing all the day
in doleful heaviness.

my flesh has no whole part:

I roar for grief of heart:

are open in thy sight:

mine eyes have lost their light.

And eke my kinsmen far away
are me departed fro.

and they that sought the way
To do me hurt, spoke lies, and thought
on mischief all the day.
The second part.

O Lord, thou Lord that art my God,

(...) when my foot did slip, then they
did joy my fall to see.

And eke my grievous heaviness
is ever in my sight.

And while I for my sinful deeds
my sorrows do express:

and mighty are also:
^^d they that hate me wrongfully,
in number hugely grow.

with evil do repay:
because that good and honest things
I do ensue always.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God,
be thou not far away:
a Haste me to help, my Lord, my God,
my safety and my stay.
Dixi. Custodiam. Psalm. xxxix.
J. H.
Said, I will look to my ways,
for fear I should go wrong;
I will take heed all times that I
offend not with my tongue.
As with a bit I will keep fast
my mouth with force and might,
^ot once to whisper all the while
the wicked are in sight.
I held my tongue and spoke no word,
but kept me close and still:
(...), from good talk I did refrain,
but sore against my will.
My heart waxt hot within my breast,
with musing, thought, and doubt,
Which did increase and stir the fire:
at last these words burst out;
Lord, number out my life and days
which yet I have not past,
(...) that I may be certifi'd
how long my life shall last.
Lord, thou have pointed out my life
in length much like a span:
^^e age is nothing unto thee,
so vain is every man.
Man walks like a shade, and does
in vain himself If annoy
^^getting goods, and cannot tell
who shall the same enjoy.
Now, Lord, fith things this wise do frame,
what help do I desire?
Of truth my help does hang on thee,
I nothing else require.
The second part.

Lord, quit me out of hand,
And make me not a scorn to fools
that nothing understand.

no trouble might me move:
Because I knew it was thy work,

I can them not withstand:
I faint and pine away for fear
of thy most heavy hand.

As does a cloth that moths have fret,

Before I go away from hence,

Expectant expectavi. Psalm. xl.
J. H.
I Waited long and sought the Lord.

At length to me he did accord
my voice and cry to hear.

And on a rock he set my feet,
and he did guide my way.

which I must show abroad,
And sing new songs of thanks always
unto the Lord our God.

Then they unto the Lord will flee,
and trust upon his aid.

That with the proud does take no part,
nor such as lie and fain.

Thy favor toward us exceeds
all things that ever was.

To such a reckoning they do rise,
thereof no end I know.

I know thy whole desire:
With sacrifice to purge his sin
thou do no man require.

thou would not have at all:
But thou, O Lord, have open made
mine ears to hear withal.

I come a mean to be:
For in the volume of thy book
thus is it said of me,

which thing does like me well:
For in my heart thy law I find
last placed there to dwell.

in great resorts I tell:
Behold, my tongue no time does cease,
O Lord, thou know full well.
The second part.

But I declare and have expressed
thy truth and saving health.

The trust that in thy truth I find,

But let thy love and verity

Make haste with aid to succor me,
O Lord, at my desire.

Drive back my foes, and them defame

Always at me they rail and cry,
Fie on him, fie for shame.

That those that love thy saving health
may say, To God be praise.

Yet thou, O Lord, wilt me restore

Wherefore my God, as thou art just,

Beatus qui intelligit. Psalm. xli.
T. S.
THe man is blessed that careful is

For in the season perilous

And he will not deliver him

Like to thy self:

Once shall thou feel

Before him shall the fire waste,

That God is just; and all must bide

And yet their works are foul and vain,

My heart and tongue shall then accord

O Lord, which art the only key:
And then my mouth shall testify

I would have offered many a one:
But thou esteem'st them of no price,

And, to speak truth, it is the best,

Which have not God before their eyes:

With them by whom my soul is staid.

And did my secret counsel hear,

And we together often did walk

For mischief reigns in the hall
and parlour where they dwell.

The Lord will help me by and by,
and he will succor me.

When I so instantly have cried,
he does not say me nay.

Although the number be full great

Will hear when I to him complain,
and punish them full sore.

For why? they will not God obey,
nor yet do fear the Lord.

Of friendship to neglect the bands

And all the counsel that they take

For in his wrath he does not let

And from their mothers womb always

Yea, like the adder that is deaf,
and fast does stop her ear,

of one that charmeth well:
No though he were the chief of choice,
and did therein excel.

within their mouths throughout:
The tusks that in their great jaw-bones
like lions whelps hang out.

as waters run forth right:
The shafts that they do shoot in haste,
let them be broke in flight:

and unto slime do run:
As one before his time that fell,
and never saw the sun.

The storms of anger waxing strong

And they shall wash their feet in blood
of them that him forsake.

And that a God on earth does dwell,
that justice does regard.
Eripe me. Psalm. lix.
J. H.
SEnd aid and save me from my foes,
O Lord, I pray to thee:
Defend and keep me from all those
that rise and strive with me.

whose doings are not good:
And set me sure and safe from them
that thirst still after blood.

they rage against me still:
Yea, for no fault that I did make,
I never did them ill.

when I no whit offend:
Arise and save me from their snare,
and see what they intend.

arise and strike all lands:
And pity none that do rebel,
and in their mischiefs stands.

as hounds they howl and grin:
And all the city clean throughout,
from place to place they run.

but in their lips are swords:
They 'greed my death, and then would say,
What? none does hear our words.

and laughed thereat apace:
The heathen folk thou do deride,
and mock them to their face.

O Lord, does come from thee:
My God he is my help at hand,
a fort of fence to me.

That I may see my foes in case
such as my heart does will.

But with thy strength drive them abroad,

Their wicked oaths with lies and wrong,

That men may know throughout the world
that Jacobs God does reign.

as dogs they grin and cry:
Throughout the streets in every place
they run about and spy.

but let them not be fed:
Not find a house wherein they may
be hold to put their head.

thy goodness I will praise:
For thou art my defense and God
at need in all assays.

O Lord, I sing to thee:
Thou art my fort, my fence, and aid,
a loving God to me.
Deus, repulisti. Psalm. lx.
J. H.
O Lord, thou did us clean forsake,
and scattredst us abroad:
Such great displeasure thou did take;
return to us, O God.

that it in sunder brake:
The hurt thereof, O Lord, restore,
for it does bow and quake.

the people that are thine:
And thou have given unto us
a drink of deadly wine.

a banner thou did show:
That they might triumph in the same,
because thy word is true.

thy folk that favor thee:
That they thy help at hand may have,
O Lord, grant this to me.

this was his joyful tale,
I will divide Sichem by pace,
and mete out Succoths vale.

Manasses mine beside:
Ephraim the strength of all my land,
my law does Judah guide.

And thou Palestine ought it to seek
for favor me unto.

Or who to Edom will me guide,
so that I go not wrong?

Our wars in hand thou would not take,
nor walk among our hosts.

The help that hosts of men can give,

He will tread down and ^ut to flight
all those that us withstand.
Exaudi, Deus. Psalm. lxi.
J. H.

Under thy wings I know right well
I shall be safe and sure.

Nonne Deo. Psalm. lxii.
J. H.
MY soul to God shall give good heed,
and him alone attend:
(...) why? my health and hope to speed
does whole on him depend.
For he alone is my defense,
my rock, my health, and aid:
(...) is my stay, that no pretense
^^all make me much dismayed.
O wicked folk, how long will ye
^^e craft? sure ye must fall:
^as a rotten hedge ye be,
and like a tottring wall.
Whom God does love, ye seek always
to put him to the worse:
(...) love to lie, with mouth ye praise,
and yet your heart does curse.
Yet still mysoul does whole depend,
on God my chief desire:
(...) all ill feats me to defend,
none but him I require.
He is my rock, my fort and tower,
my health is of his grace:
(...) does support me, that no power
can move me out of place.
God is my glory and my health,
my souls desire and lust:
^^f^rt, my strength, my stay, my wealth,
God is my only trust.
Oh, have your trust in him always,
(...) folk, with one accord:
(...) out your hearts to him, and say,
our trust is in the Lord.
The sons of men deceitful are,
on balance but a slight:
(...) things most vain do them compare,
^^r they can keep no weight:
Trust not in wrong, robb'ry, nor stealth,
let vain delights be gone:
^^ough goods well got flow in with wealth
let not your hearts thereon.
The Lord long since one thing did tell,
which here to mind I call:
(...) spoke it often, I heard it well,
That God alone does all.
And that thou, Lord, art good and kind,
thy mercy does exceed:
that all sorts with thee shall find
according to their deed.
Deus, Deus meus. Psalm. lxiii.
T. S.
O God my God, I watch betime

(...) why? my soul and body both

where waters there are none,
(...) flesh is parcht for thought of thee,
^or thee I wish alone.
That I might see yet once again
(...) glory, strength, and might,
(...) ^as wont it to behold
a thin thy temple bright.
F^r why? thy mercies fa^ surmount

For liars mouths shall then be stopped,
which have the truth disturbed.
Exaudi, Deus. Psalm. lxiv.
J. H.
O Lord, unto my voice give ear,
with plaint when I do pray:
And rid my life and soul from fear
of foes that threat to slay.

which in deceit do lurk:
And from the frowning face of them
that all ill seats do work.

men whet and sharp their swords:
They shoot abroad their arrows keen,
I mean most bitter words.

the upright man to hit:
The just unwares to strike by craft,
they care or fear no whit.

in counsel thus they cry,
To use deceit let us not dread,
what? who can it espy?

all times within their heart:
They all consult what feats to use,
each does invent his part.

when they think least upon,
God with his dart shall sure assail
and wound them every one.

shall work themselves such blame,
That they which then behold their fall,
shall wonder at the same.

And praise his witty works, and tell
what he to pa^s has brought.

So shall they joy with mind and voice,
whose hearts are pure and right.

Thy house and temple he shall use,

The hope of all the earth abroad,

Thou make the mountains strong and stout
to stand in every shower.

and make their streams full still:
Thou do restrain the peoples rage,
and rule them at thy will.

Which morn and even in great mirth
do pass with praise to thee.

Then with thy drops thou do apply,

and so does cause to spring
The seed and corn which men do sow,
for he does guide the thing.

whereby her clods do fall:
Thy drops on her thou do distill,

Thy clouds distill their dew apace,

The laud thereof the world about

On scot to pass both fair and dry,
whereof their hearts were glad.

With joyful voice declare abroad,

And there with chains and fetters strong

And bring us out into a place,

And there I will my self apply
my vows to thee to pay:

The vows, I say, which I did make
in dolor of my heart.

Yea, this my sacrifice shall be

What he for my poor soul has done

And thou my tongue make speed apace

Or if I have delight to sin,

They shall be glad and merry all,

And brought them through the wilderness,

The mount Sinai shook in such sort,

The Lord also in Sinai

Which in times past thy chosen flock

Thou did subdue, that they might dwell

Of those that in their wickedness

And all mine own, as I have done,

And how thou go as God and King

Salvum me fac. Psalm. lxix.
J. H.
SAve me, O God, and that with speed,
the waters flow full fast:
So nigh my soul do they proceed,
that I am sore aghast.

Whereas I feel no ground:
fall into such floods, I say,
that I am like be drowned.

my throat is hoarse and dry:
With looking up my sight does fail,
for help to God on high.

In number sure they are no less
then hairs are on my head.

They do compel me to restore
the things I never had.

And all the faults that I commit
to thee are known full well.

In spite of thee they would me make

Yea, if I weep and moan:
Yet in my teeth this gear is cast,

Then they anon will it pervert,

Because of their great tyranny,

For those that seek and work the same,

But find no friends to ease my smart,

And gave me in my thirst withal

And when they think full well to sat,

Bow down their backs, and do them bind,

Let thy displeasure in thine ire

So, so, there goes the game.

From folk unjust, and eke from them

Yea, from my youth I had a lust

Wherefore I will thee praise with mirth,

But thou art now, and still have been

And when my strength does waste away,

And they against me do conspire,

The second part.

For God from him is gone:
Dispatch him quite, for to his aid
(I wis) there comes none.

O Lord, when need shall be:
But that in time of grief thou may
in haste give help to me.

all those that seek my life:
Oppress them with rebuke also,
that fain would work me strife.

Still more and more, each time and tide,
I will set forth thy praise.

But of thy benefits, O Lord,
I know no count nor end.

and do instruct me still:
Therefore thy wonders to declare
I have great mind and will.

thou did me keep and stay:
For sake me not unto mine age,
and till my head be gray:
The third part.

And that our seed thy power may know
hereafter many a year.

Thy works are wonderful indeed,

Yea, thou did help and me restore,
and took'st me from the grave.

Yea, thou do make all grief to cease,
and comfort'st me again.

I will with viol sing:
My harp shall sound thy praise always,
O Isreal's holy King.

And eke my soul will much rejoice,
for thou have made me free.

For grief and shame do them confound
that seek to work me ill.
Deus, judicium. Psalm. lxxii.
J. H.
LOrd, give thy judgments to the king,

And with his son that princely thing,
Lord, let thy justice dwell.

And so defend through equity

unto thy folk give peace:
And eke let little hills apply,
in justiceto increase.

with aid, and make them strong:
And eke destroy for evermore
all those that do them wrong.

regard and fear thy might:
So long as sun does shine by day,
or else the moon by night.

like rain to fields new mown:
And like to drops that lay the dust,
and fresh the land new sown.

and all shall be at peace,
Until the moon shall leave to prime,
waste, change, and to increase.

from shore to shore throughout:
And from the floods within the land,
through all the earth about.

And all his enemies that rebel

And all the people of the world

And eke the simple folk that have

And eke the blood that they shall bleed

He shall be honored as a king,

That it like cedar-trees shall stand

In plenty it shall far exceed,

And think them happy through the same,
all folk shall bless his might.

For he does every wondrous thing,

Quam bonus Deus. Psalm. lxxiii.
T. S.
HOw ever it be, yet God is good
and kind to Israel:
And to all such as safely keep
their conscience pure and well.

my feet began to slide:
And ere I wist, even at a pinch
my steps awry 'gan glide.

I grudged and did disdain
That wicked men all things should have
without turmoil or pain.

as if death should them smite:
Their bodies are both stout and strong,
and ever in good plight:

when other men be shent:
And with the rest they take no part
of plague or punishment.

their necks as does a chain:
And are even wrapped as in a robe,
with rapine and disdain.

their eyes often times out start:
And as for worldly goods they have
more then can wish their heart.

boasting much of the wrong
Which they have done to simple men,
and ever pride among.

they spare not to blaspheme:
And prate they do of worldly things,
no wight they do esteem.

to see their prosperous state:
And almost drink the self-same cup,
and follow the same rate.
The second part.

should know or understand
These worldly things, since wicked men
be lords of sea and land?

in riches still increase,
Rewarded well with worldly goods,
and live in rest and peace.

my fantasy refrain,
And wash my hands with innocents,
and cleanse my heart in vain?

as subject to all blame:
And every morning from my youth
sustain rebuke and shame?

misliking mine estate:
But that I should thy children judge
as folk unfortunate.

this matter understand:
But yet the labor was too great
for me to take in hand:

thine holy place, and then
I understood right perfectly
the end of all these men.

upon a slippery place:
And at thy pleasure and thy will
thou do them all deface.

to see how suddenly
They are destroyed, dispatched, consumed,
and dead so horribly.

so shall their wealth decay:
Their famous names in all men's sight
shall ebb and pass away.
The third part.

my mind was much oppressed:

and in this point a beast.

thou hold'st me always fast:

to glory at the last.

but thee in heaven above?
And in the earth there is nothing
like thee that I can love.

but God does fail me never:
For of my health God is the strength,
my portion eke for ever.

thou shall destroy each one:
And those that trust in any thing
saving in thee alone.

and ever with him dwell:
In God alone I put my trust,
thy wonders I will tell.
Vtquid, Deus. Psalm. lxxiv.
J. H.
WHy art thou, Lord, so long from us
in all this danger deep?
Why does thine anger kindle thus
at thine own pasture-sheep?

which have been thine so long,
The which thou have redeemed and brought
from bondage sore and strong.

remember it full well,
Thy pleasant place, thy mount Sion,
where thou wast wont to dwell.

and all thy foes deface:
Which now at pleasure rob and waste
within thy holy place.

Thine enemies roar, O God:
They set as signs on every wall
their banners splaid abroad.

that on the hills do grow:
So shine the bills and swords of these
within thy temple now.

the goodly graven stones,
With axes, hammers, bills, and swords
they beat them down at once.

and eke in all this toil
The house appointed to thy Name
they raze down to the soil.

And how the foolish folk are set

As half on sleep their chariots stood,

J. H.
I With my voice to God do cry,
with heart and hearty cheer:
My voice to God I lift on high,
and he my suit does hear.

by night no rest I took:
But stretched my hands to him abroad,
my soul comfort forsook.

my trouble then is more:
I spoke, but could not make an end,
my breath was stopped so sore.

that I always awake:
With fear I am so sore oppressed,
my speech does me forsake.

and often did think upon
The times and ages that are past
full many years agone.

And with my heart much talle I find,

So that henceforth no time he shall

Or is his promise now delayed,

And so do make the people know

And they for fear away did flee,

Attendite populi. Psalm. lxxviii.
J. H.
ATtend my people to my law,
and to my words incline:
My mouth shall speak strange parables,
and sentences divine:
Which we our selves have heard and learned
even of our fathers old;
^d which for our instruction
our fathers have us told.
Because we should not keep it close
from them that should come after:
Who should Gods power to their race praise
and all his works of wonder.
To Jacob he commandment gave
How Israel should live,
^illing our fathers should the same
unto their children give.
That they and their posterity
that were not sprung up tho,
^ould have the knowledge of the law,
and teach their seed also.
That they might have the better hope
in God that is above:
^^d not forget to keep his laws
and his precepts in love.
Not being as their fathers were,
rebelling in Gods sight:
^^d would not frame their wicked hearts
to know their God aright.
How went the people of Ephraim
their neighbors for to spoil:
^oting their darts the day of war,
and yet they took the foil?
For why? they did not keep with God
the covenant that was made,

according to his trade:
But put into oblivion

In Egypt land within the field

And in the night when dark it was,

As plentiful as when the deeps

Of such abundance, that no floods

And stirred him that is most high

Requiring such a kind of meat
as served to their lust:

What? can this God prepare for us

And would not suffer all his whole

That passes away, and cannot well

And filled their country full of frogs,

And not so much as wild fig trees,

And all their flocks and herds likewise

thou listest up on high.

thou have thy seat and place:
Mercy and truth are still with thee,
and go before thy face.

thy present power, O God:
For in the favor of thy sight
they walk full safe abroad.

they joy and much rejoice:
And through thy righteousness have they
a pleasant fame and noise.

in thee alone does fie:
Thy goodness eke that has us staid,
shall lift our horn on high.

the Lord to us does bring:
The holy one of Israel,
he is our guide and king.

in visions thou did show:
And thus then did thou say to them,
thy mind to make them know;

your king and guide to be:
And set him up whom I elect
among the folk to me.
The third part.

whom I have searched out:
And with my holy oil anoint
him king of all the rout.

with him for to remain:
And with mine arm also I will
him strengthen and sustain.

they shall him not devour:
Ne yet the sons of wickedness
on him shall have no power:

before his face in fight:
And those that hate him I will plague,
and strike them with my might.

shall still upon him lie:
And in my Name his horn eke shall
be listed up on high.

upon the sea and land:
And eke the running floods shall he
embrace with his right hand.

on me, and thus shall say,
My Father and my God thou art,
my rock of health and stay.

of all on earth that springs:
His might and honor I will make
above all earthly kings.

as I my self have told:
My faithful covenant to fulfill
my mercy I will hold.

for ever strong and sure:
So that his seat shall still remain
while heaven does endure.
The fourth part.

and so begin to swerve:
And of my judgments have none aw,
nor will not them observe:

my statutes to them made,
And set all my commandments light,
and will not keep my trade:

their doings to amend:
And so with scourging for their sin,
if that they do offend.

I will not take him fro:
Nor handle him with craftiness,
and so my truth forgo.

with all that I have spoke:
No word the which my lips have told
shall alter or be broke.

and that perform will I:
With David I shall keep promise,
to him I will not lie.

and eke his throne of might:
As does the sun, it shall remain
for ever in my fight.

for ever stands fast
A faithful witness from on high,
so shall his kingdom last.

and now thou changest cheer:
Yea, thou art wroth with thine elect,
thine own anointe dear.

Lord, thou have quite undone:
And down upon the ground also
have cast his royal crown.
The fifth part.

his walls thou do confound:
Thou beatest eke his bulwarks down,
and break'st them to the ground.

of comers by throughout:
And so is made a mock and scorn
to all that dwell about.

that him so sore annoy:
And all his foes that him devour,
lo, thou have made to joy.

that should his foes withstand:
To him in war no victory
thou giv'st, nor upper hand.

his throne, his joy, his mirth
By thee is overthrown, and cast
full low upon the earth.

his youth and lusty days:
And raised of him an ill report
with shame and great dispraise.

for ever will thou turn?
And shall thine anger still always
as fire consume and burn?

my time consumes fast:
Why have thou made the sons of men
as things in vain to waste?

and death shall never see?
Or from the hand of hell his soul
shall he deliver free?

so often declared beforn,
Which by thy truth and uprightness
to David thou have sworn?

that on thy servants lie:
The railings of the people all
born in my breast have I,

blasphemed have thy Name:
The steps of thine anointed one
they cease not to defame.

both now and eke for ay:
Through sky and earth, and all the coasts,
Amen, amen, I say.
Domine, refugium. Psalm. xc.
J. H.
THou, Lord, have been our sure defense,

In all times past, yea so long since

From age to age, and always still
for ever thou art God.

And then thou say again, Return
again ye sons of men.

what is it in thy sight?
As yesterday it does appear,
or as a watch by night.

then is their life and trade
All as asleep, and like the grass
whose beauty soon does fade:

but fades by and by:
And is cut down ere it be night,
all withered, dead, and dry.

our might is much decayed:
And of thy fervent wrath and sum
we are full sore afraid.

thou sett'st before thine eye:
Our privy faults, yea, eke our thoughts
thy countenance does spy.

thereof does naught remain:
Our year^ consume as words or blasts,
and are not called again.

that we do live on mold:
If one see fourscore, surely then
we count him wondrous old.
The second part.

the which we count upon,
Is nothing else but painful grief,
and we as blasts are gone.

what might thine anger has?
Or in his heart who does thee fear
according to thy wrath?

how long our days remain:
That then we may our hearts apply
true wisdom to attain.

forth on in wrath proceed?
Show favor to thy servants now,
and help them at their need.

and then our joy shall be
All times so long as life does last,
in heart rejoice will we.

now also make us glad:
And for the years wherein full sore
affliction we have had.

and on thy servants light:
And show unto thy children dear
thy glory and thy might.

on us thy servants thus:
Confirm the works we take in hand,
Lord, prosper them to us.
Qui habitat. Psalm. xci.
J. H.

of God most high does dwell:
In shadow of the Mightiest grace

I to the Lord will say,
My God is he, in him will I
my whole affiance stay.

And from the deadly plague and care
whereof thou art afraid:

and keep thee safely there:
His faith and truth thy fence shall be,
as sure as shield and spear.

Of all the shafts that fly by day,
nor terrors of the night:

Nor yet of that which does destroy
and at noonday does waste.

a thousand dead shall be:
Ten thousand eke at thy right hand,
and yet shall thou be free.

thine eyes shall well regard,
That even like to their desert
the wicked have reward.

to stay my hope on thee:
And in the Righ'st I put my trust,
my sure defense is he.

with thee it shall not mell:
Nor yet the plague shall once come near
the house where thou do dwell.

with charge commanded he,
That still in all thy ways they shall
preserve and prosper thee:

still waiting thee upon:
So that thy foot shall never chance
to spurn at any stone.

the adder fell and long:
And tread upon the lions young,
with dragons stout and strong.

I will dispatch him quite:
And him defend, because that he
does know my Name aright.

an answer I will give:
And from his grief take him will I
in glory for to live.

I will fulfill his time:
The goodness of my saving health
I will declare to him.
Bonumest. Psalm. xcii.
J. H.

And eke declare his truth abroad

With all the mirth you can invent

And all such sools are nothing fit

They when they flourish in their ill

yea thou do reign therefore
In every time eternally,
both now and evermore.

behold thy foes, I say,
How all that work iniquity
shall perish and decay.

shall list mine horn on high:
With fresh and new prepared oil
thine ointed king am I:

Of all that up against me rise,
mine ears shall hear the same.

And as the cedars multiply

How long shall wicked men, I say,
thus triumph and rejoice?

and proudly prate their fill?
Shall they rejoice that be so stout,
whose works are ever ill?

Against thy people they do rage

They slay the children fatherless,

Can Jacobs God this understand?
tush no, he cannot see.

Ye fools among the multitude,

Then, Lord, thy goodness did me touch,

To save or consume things,

That it once to move

Because they keep no whit thy word,

Thy righteous judgments are also

But all in vain; for of thy word

For why? thy holy law do I

Ad Dominum. Psalm. cxx.
T. S.
IN trouble and in thrall
Unto the Lord I call,
And he does me comfort.

From liars lips always,
And tongues of false report.

Gett'st thou thus for to sting,
Thou false and flattering liar?

No less then arrows keen,
Or hot consuming fire.

Within these tents so black,
Which Kedars are by name,
By whom the flock elect
And all of Isaacs sect
Are put to open shame.

I came a peace to make,
And set a quiet life:

Causles^ I was controlled
By them that would have strife.
Levavi oculos. Psalm. cxxi.
W. W.
I Lift mine eyes to Sion hill,
From whence I do attend
That succor God me send

Which heaven and earth framed,
And all things therein named.

And will thee safely keep,
For he will never sleep.

No sleep at all can him catch,
But his eyes shall ever watch.

The Lord eke does thee cover
As at thy right hand ever:

Nor the moon not half so bright
Shall with cold hurt thee by night.

And will thy life sure save:

In all thy business good success.
Wherever thou go in or out,
God will thy things bring about.
Letatus sum. Psalm. cxxii.
W. K.
I Did in heart rejoice
To hear the peoples voice,
In offering so willingly:

And in the Lords house pray:
Thus spoke the folk full lovingly.

Shall in thy gates abide,
O thou Jerusalem full fair,
Which art so seemly set
Much like a city neat.
The like whereof is not elsewhere.

The tribes of God the Lord
Are thither bent their way to take:
So God before did tell
That there his Israel
Their prayers should together make.

And that for this respect,
To set forth justice orderly:
Which thrones right to maintain
To David's house pertain,
His folk to judge accordingly.

For Jerusalem^s p^ace,
Thy friends God prosper mightily:

And prosper thee throughout
Thy palaces continually.

For my poor brethrens sake,
That comfort have by means of thee.

Thy w^alth for to procure
So much always as lies in me.
Ad te levavi Psalm. cxxiii.
T. S.
O Lord that heaven do possess,
I lift mine eyes to thee:

As handmaids watch their mistress hand
some grace for to atchieve:
So we behold the Lord our God,
till he do us forgive.

and mercy in thy sight:
For we are filled and overcome
with hatred and despite.

the rich and worldly wise
Do make of us their mocking-stocks.
the proud do us despise.
Nisi quia Dom. Psalm. cxxiv.
W. W.
NOw Israel
may say, and that truly,
If that the Lord
had not our cause maintained;

had not our right sustained,
When all the world
against us furiously
Made their uproars,
and said we should all die:

they had devoured us all,
And swallowed quick,
for ought that we could deem:
Such was their rage,
as we might well esteem.

with mighty force do fall:
So had they now
our lives even brought to thrall.

most proud in roaring noise,
Had long ago
overwhelmed us in the deep:

which does us safely keep
From bloody teeth,
and their most cruel voice,
Which as a prey
to eat us would rejoice,

out of the fowlers grin
Escapes away,
right so it fares with us:
Broke are their nets,
and we have escaped thus.

and earth is our help then:
His Name has saved
us from these wicked men.
Qui confidunt. Psalm. cxxv.
W. K.
SUch as in God the Lord do trust,
As mount Sion shall firmly stand,
And be removed at no hand.
The Lord will count them right and just:
So that they shall be sure
For ever to endure.

Jerusalem about do close:
So will the Lord do unto those
Who on his godly will do wait:
Such are to him so dear,
They never need to fear.

By making wicked men his rod,
Lest they through grief forsake their God;
It shall not as their lot still be.

Whose hearts are true and right.

By crooked ways which they out sought,
The Lord will surely bring to naught;
With workers vile they shall abide:
But peace with Israel
For evermore shall dwell,
Another of the same,
by R. W.
THose that do put their confidence
Upon the Lord our God only,
And flee to him for their defense
In all their need and misery:
Their faith is sure still to endure,
Grounded on Christ the cornerstone,
Moved with none ill, but stands full
Steadfast like to the mount Sion.
And as about Jerusalem
The mighty hills do it compass.
So that no enemies come to them
To hurt that town in any case:
So God indeed in every need
His faithful people does defend,
Standing them by assuredly
From this time forth world without end.
Right wise and good is our Lord God,
And will not suffer certainly
The sinners and ungodlies rod
To tarry upon his family:
Lest they also from God should go.
Falling to sin and wickedness.
O Lord, defend world without end
Thy Christian flock through thy goodness.
O Lord, do good to Christians all
That steadfast in thy word abide:
Such as willingly from God fall,
And to false doctrine daily slide,
Such will the Lord scatter abroad
With hypocrites thrown down to hell,
God will them send pains without end:
But, Lord, grant peace to Israel.
Glory to God the Father of might,
And to the Son our Savior,
And to the holy Ghost, whose light
Shine in our hearts, and us succor:
That the right way from day to day
We may walk, and him glorify:
With heates desire all that are here
Worship the Lord, and say, Amen.
In convertendo. Psalm. cxxvi.
W. W.
WHen that the Lord
again his Sion had forth brought
From bondage great,
and also servitude extreme;
His work was such
as did surmount man's heart and thought:
So that we were
much like to them that use to dream,

with laughter filled then,
And eke our tongues
did show us joyful men.
The heathen folk
were forced then this to confess,
How that the Lord
for them also great things had done.

and therefore can confess no less:
Wherefore to joy
we have good cause as we begun.

thou can our bondage end:
As to deserts
the flowing rivers send.

that they which sow in tears indeed,
A time will come
when they shall reap in mirth and joy.

in bearing of their precious seed,
For that their foes
full often times did them annoy:
But their return
with joy they shall sure see,
Their sheaves home bring,
and not empaired be.
Nisi Dom. Psalm. cxxvii.
W. W.
EXcept the Lord the house does make,
And thereunto does set his hand:
What men do build it cannot stand.
Likewise in vain men undertake
Cities and holds to watch and ward,
Except the Lord be their safeguard.

And so at night go late to bed,
Feeding full hardly with brown bread,
Yet were your labor lost and worn:
But they whom God does love and keep,
Receive all things with quiet sleep.

That men have heirs to enjoy their land,
It is the gift of Gods own hand:
For God himself does multiply
Of his great liberality
The blessing of posterity.

They grow in strength and activeness,
In person and in comeliness:
So that a shaft shot with courage
Of one that has a most strong arm,
Flies not so swift, nor does like harm.

Furnished with such artillery:
For when in peril he shall be,
Such one shall never shake nor shiver,
When that he pleads before the judge
Against his foes that bear him grudge.

For so thou might soon purchase blame,
And in his wrath he would thee spill.

A Prayer.
The Spirit of grace grant us, O Lord,
To keep these laws our hearts restore:
And cause us all with one accord
To magnify thy Name therefore.
For of our selves no strength we have
To keep these laws after thy will:
Thy might therefore, O Christ, we crave,
That we in thee may them fulfill.
Lord, for thy Names sake grant us this,
Thou art our strength, O Savior Christ:
Of thee to speed how should we miss,
In whom our treasure does consist?
To thee for evermore be praise,
With the Father in each respect,
And with the holy Spirit always,
The Comforter of thine elect.

D. Cox.
OUr Father which in heaven art.
And make us all one brotherhood,
To call upon thee with one heart,
Our heavenly Father and our God:
Grant we pray not with lips alone,
But with our hearts deep sigh and groan.
Thy blessed Name be sanctified,
Thy holy word might us inflame,
In holy life for to abide
To magnify thy holy Name.
From all errors defend and keep
The little flock of thy poor sheep.
Thy kingdom come even at this hour,
And henceforth everlastingly:
Thine holy Ghost into us pour,
With all his gifts most plenteously.
From Satan's rage and filthy band
Defend us with thy mighty hand.
Thy will be done with diligence,
Like as in heaven in earth also:
In trouble grant us patience,
Thee to obey in wealth and woe.
Let not flesh, blood, or any ill,
Prevail against thy holy will.
Give us this day our daily bread,
And all other good gifts of thine:
Keep us from war, and from bloodshed,
Also from sickness, dearth, and pine:
That we may live in quietness,
Without all greedy carefulness.
Forgive us our offenses all,
Relieve our careful conscience;
As we forgive both great and small
Which unto us have done offense.
Prepare us, Lord, for to serve thee
In perfect love and unity.
O Lord, into temptation
Lead us not; when the fiend does rage,
To withstand his invasion
Give power and strength to every age.
Arm and make strong thy feeble host
With faith, and with the holy Ghost.
O Lord, from evil deliver us,
The days and times are dangerous:
From everlasting death save us,
And in our last need comfort us:
A blessed end to us bequeath,
Into thy hands our souls receive.
For thou, O Lord, art King of kings,
And thou have power over all:
Thy glory shines in all things,
In the wide world universal.
Amen, let it be done, O Lord,
That we have prayed with one accord.
The twelve Articles of the Christian Faith.
ALl my belief and confidence
is in the Lord of might;
The Father which all things has made,
the day and eke the night:
The heavens and the firmament,
and also many a star:
The earth and all that is therein,
which pass man's reason far.
And in like manner I believe
in Christ our Lord his Son,
Coequal with the Deity,
and man in flesh and bone:
Con ceived by the holy Ghost,
his word does me assure:
And of his mother Mary born,
yet she a virgin pure.
Because mankind to Satan was
for sin in bond and thrall:
He came and offered up himself
to death, to save us all.
And suffering most grievous pain,
then Pilate being judge,
Was crucified on the cross,
and thereat did not grudge.
And so he died in the flesh,
but quickened in the sprite:
His body then was buried,
as is our use and rite.
His soul did after this descend
into the lower parts:
A dread unto the wicked sprites,
but joy to faithful hearts.
And in the third day of his death
he rose to life again,
To the end he might be glorified,
out of all grief and pain.
Ascending to the heavens high,
to fit in glory still
On Gods right hand his Father dear,
according to his will;
Until the day of judgment come,
when he shall come again
With angels power (yet of that day
we all be uncertain)
To judge all people righteously,
whom he has dearly bought:
The living and the dead also,
which he has made of naught.
And in the holy Spirit of God,
my faith to satisfy,
The third person in Trinity
believe I steadfastly:
The holy and catholic Church
that Gods word does maintain,
And holy Scripture does allow,
which Satan does disdain.
And also I do trust to have
by Jesus Christ his death
Release and pardon of my sins,
and that only by faith:
What time all flesh shall rise again
before the Lord of might;
And see him with their bodily eyes,
which now do give them light.
And then shall Christ our Savior
the sheep and goats divide,
And give life everlastingly
to those whom he has tried:
Within his realm celestial
in glory for to rest,
With all his holy company
of saints and angels blessed;
Which serve the Lord omnipotent
obediently each hour:
To whom be all dominion
and praise for evermore.
A prayer to the holy Ghost, to be sung before the Sermon.
COme holy Spirit the God of might,
Comforter of us all:
Teach us to know thy word aright,
that we do never fall.
O holy Ghost, visit our coast,
defend us with thy shield:
Against all sin and wickedness,
Lord, help us win the field.
Lord, keep our King and his counsel,
and give them will and might
To persevere in thy Gospel,
which can put sin to flight.
O Lord, that giv'st thy holy word,
send preachers plenteously:
That in the same we may accord,
and therein live and die.
O holy Spirit, direct aright
the preachers of thy word,
That thou by them may cut down sin
as it were with a sword.
Depart not from thy pastors pure,
but aid them at their need:
Which break to us the bread of life,
whereon our souls do feed.
O blessed Spirit of truth keep us
in peace and unity,
Keep us from sects and errors all,
and from all papistry.
Convert all those that are our foes,
and bring them to thy light:
That they and we may well agree,
and praise thee day and night.
O Lord, increase our says in us,
and love so to abound;
That man and wife be void of strife,
and neighbors about us round.
In our time give thy peace, O Lord,
to nations far and nigh:
And teach them all thy holy word,
that we may sing to thee.
All glory to the Trinity
that is of mighties most:
The living Father, and the Son,
and eke the holy Ghost.
As it has been in all the time
that has been heretofore:
As it is now, and so shall be
henceforth for evermore.
Da pacem, Domine.
GIve peace in these our days, O Lord,
Great dangers are now at hand:
Thine enemies with one accord
Christ's Name in every land
Seek to deface,
Root out and raze
Thy true right worship indeed.
Be thou the stay,
Lord, we thee pray.
Thou help'st alone in all need.
Give us that peace that we do lack
Through misbelief and ill life:
Thy word to offer thou do not slack,
Which we unkindly gain-strive.
With fire and sword
This healthful word
Some persecute and oppress:
Some with the mouth
Confess the truth
Without sincere godliness.
Give peace, and us thy Spirit down send,
With grief and repentance true
Do pierce our hearts, our lives to amend
And by faith in Christ renew:
That fear and dread,
War and bloodshed,
Through thy sweet mercy and grace,
May from us slide:
Thy truth may bide,
And shine in every place.
The Lamentation.
O Lord, in thee is all my trust,
give ear unto my woeful cry:
Refuse me not that am unjust,
but bowing down thy heavenly eye,
Behold how I do still lament
my ^ins wherein I do offend:
O Lord, for them shall I be shent,
since thee to please I do intend?
No, no; not so thy will is bent
to deal with sinners in thine ire:
But when in heart they shall repent,
thou grant'st with speed their just desire,
To thee therefore still shall I cry,
to wash away my sinful crime:
Thy blood, O Lord, is not yet dry
but that it may help me in time.
Haste thee, O Lord, haste thee, I say,
to pour on me thy gifts of grace,
That when this life shall flit away
in heaven with thee I may have place:
Where thou do reign eternally
with God which once did down thee send,
Where angels sing continually:
to thee be praise world without end.
A Thanksgiving after the receiving of the Lords Supper.
THe Lord be thanked for his gifts
and mercies evermore
That he does show unto his saints:
to him be laud therefore.
Our tongues cannot so praise the Lord
as he does right deserve:
Our hearts cannot of him so think
as he does us preserve.
His benefits they be so great
to us that be but sin,
That at our hands for recompense
there is no hope to win.
O sinful flesh, that thou should have
such mercies of the Lord!
Thou do deserve most worthily
of him to be abhorred.
Naught else but sin and wretchedness
does rest within our ^earts:
And stubbornly against the Lord
we daily play our parts.
The sun above in firmament
that is to us a light,
Does show it self more clear and pure
then we be in his sight.
The heavens above and all therein
more holy are then we:
They serve the Lord in their estate,
each one in his degree.
They do not strive for mastership,
nor slack their office set:
But serve the Lord and do his will,
hate is to them no let.
Also the earth and all therein
of God it is in aw,
It does observe the formers will,
by skilful natures law.
The sea and all that is therein
does bend when God does beck:
The spirits beneath do tremble all,
and fear his wrathful check.
But we (alas!) ^o^ whom all these
were made them for to rule,
Do not so know or love the Lord
as does the ox or mule
A law he gave for us to know,
what was his holy will
He would us good, but we would not
avoid the thing is ill.
Not one of us that seeks out
the Lord of life to please:
Nor does the thing that might us lead
to Christ and quiet ease.
Thus are we all his enemies,
we can it not deny:
And he again of his good will
would not that we should die.
Therefore when remedy was none
to bring us unto life,
The Son of God our flesh he took
to end our mortal strife.
And all the law of God the Lord
he did it full obey:
And for our sins upon the cross
his blood our debts did pay.
And that we should not yet forget
what good he to us wrought,
A sign he left our eyes to tell
that he our bodies bought.
In bread and wine here visible
unto thine eyes and taste,
His mercies great thou may record
if that his Spirit thou have.
As once the corn did live and grow,
and was cut down with lithe,
And threshed out with many stripes,
out from his husk to drive;
And as the mill with violence
did tear it out so small,
And made it like to earthly dust,
not sparing it at all;
And as the oven with fire hot
did close it up with heat,
And all this done that I have said,
that it should be our meat:
So was the Lord in his ripe age
cut down by cruel death:
His soul he gave in torments great,
and yielded up his breath.
Because that he to us might be
an everlasting bread,
With much reproach and troubles great
on earth his life he led.
And as the grapes in pleasant time
are pressed very sore,
And plucked down when they be ripe,
and let to grow no more;
Because the juice that in them is
as comfortable drink
We might receive, and joyful be
when sorrows make us shrink:
So Christ his blood out pressed was
with nails and eke with spear:
The juice thereof does save all those
that rightly do him fear.
And as the corns by unity
into one loaf are knit:
So is the Lord and his whole Church,
though he in heaven sit.
As many grapes make but one wine,
so should we be but one --.
In faith and love in Christ above,
and unto Christ alone:
Leading a life without all strife,
in quiet rest and peace:
From envy and from malice both
our hearts and tongues to cease.
Which if we do, then shall we show
that we his chosen be:
By faith in him to lead a life
as always willed he.
And that we may so do indeed,
God send us all his grace:
Then after death we shall be sure
with him to have a place.
R. W.
PReserve us, Lord, by thy dear word;
From Turk and Pope defend us Lord:
Which both would thrust out of his throne
Our Lord Jesus Christ thy dear Son.
Lord Jesus Christ, show forth thy might,
That thou art Lord of lords by right:
Thy poor afflicted flock defend,
That we may praise thee without end.
God holy Ghost our Comforter,
Be our patron, help, and succor:
Give us one mind and perfect peace,
All gifts of grace in us increase.
Thou living God in persons three,
Thy name be praised in unity:
In all our need so us defend,
That we may praise thee without end.

PRAYERS. A form of prayer to be used in private houses every morning and
evening.
Morning prayer.
ALmighty God and most merciful Father, we do not present our selves here
before thy Majesty, trusting in our own merits or worthiness, but in thy
manifold mercies, which have promised to hear our prayers, and grant our
requests which we shall make to thee in the name of thy beloved Son Jesus
Christ our Lord, who also has commanded us to assemble ourselves together in
his name, with full assurance that he will not only be amongst us, but also be
our Mediator and Advocate toward thy Majesty, that we may obtain all things
which shall seem expedient to thy blessed will, for our necessities. Therefore
we beseech thee, most merciful Father, to turn thy loving countenance toward
us, and impute not unto us our manifold sins and offenses, whereby we justly
deserve thy wrath and sharp punishment, but rather receive us to thy mercy, for
Jesus Christ's sake, accepting his death and passion as a just recompense for
all our offenses, in whom thou art well pleased, and through whom thou can
not be offended with us. And seeing that of thy great mercies we have quietly
passed this night: grant (O heavenly Father) that we may bestow this day wholly
in thy service, so that all our thoughts, words, and deeds may redound to the
glory of thy great name, and good example to all men, who seeing our good works
may glorify thee our heavenly Father.

And forasmuch as of thy mere favor and love thou have not only created us to
thine own similitude and likeness, but also have chosen us to be heirs with thy
dear Son Jesus Christ, of that immortal kingdom which thou preparedst for us
from the beginning of the world; we beseech thee to increase our faith and
knowledge, and to lighten our hearts with thy holy Spirit, that we may in the
mean time live in godly conversation and integrity of life, knowing that
idolaters, adulterers, covetous men, contentious persons, drunkards, gluttons,
and such like, shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

And because thou have commanded us to pray one for another, we do not only
make request, O Lord, for our selves, and for them that thou have already
called to the true understanding of thy heavenly will, but for all people and
nations of the world; who as they know by thy wonderful works that thou art God
over all, (...) they may be instructed by thy holy Spirit to believe in thee
their only Savior and Redeemer. But forasmuch as they cannot believe except
they hear, nor cannot hear but by preaching, and none can preach except they be
sent: therefore, O Lord, raise up faithful distributers of thy mysteries, who
setting apart all worldly respects, may both in their life and doctrine only
seek thy glory. Contrarily, confound Satan and Antichrist, with all hirelings,
whom thou have already cast off into a reprobate sense, that they may not by
sects, schisms, heresies and errors, disquiet thy little flock. And because, O
Lord, we be fallen into the latter days and dangerous times, wherein ignorance
has gotten the upper hand, and Satan by his ministers seeks by all means to
quench the light of thy gospel; we beseech thee to maintain thy cause against
those ravening wolves, and strengthen all thy servants whom they keep in prison
and bondage. Let not thy long-suffering be an occasion either to increase their
tyranny, or to discourage thy children: neither yet let our sins and wickedness
be an hinderance to thy mercies, but with speed, O Lord, consider these great
miseries. For thy people Israel many times by their sins provoked thine anger,
and thou punishedst them by thy just judgment: yet though their sins were
never so grievous, if they once returned from their iniquity, thou receivedst
them to mercy. We therefore, most wretched sinners, bewail our manifold sins,
and earnestly repent us of our former wickedness, and ungodly behavior toward
thee: and whereas we cannot of our selves purchase thy pardon, yet we humbly
beseech thee for Jesus Christ's sake, to show thy mercies upon us, and receive
us again to thy favor. Grant us, dear Father, these our requests, and all
other things necessary for us and thy whole Church, according to thy promise in
Jesus Christ our Lord: In whose name we beseech thee as he has taught us,
saying, Our Father which art, etc.

Evening prayer.
O Lord God, Father everlasting, and full of pity, we acknowledge and confess
that we be not worthy to lift up our eyes to heaven, much less to present our
selves before thy Majesty, with confidence that thou will hear our prayers, and
grant our requests, if we consider our own deservings; for our consciences do
accuse us, and our sins do witness against us and we know that thou art an
upright Judge, which do not justify the sinners and wicked men, but punishest
the faults of all such as transgress thy commandments: yet, most merciful
Father, since it has pleased thee to command us to call on thee in all our
troubles and adversities, promising even then to help us, when we feel our
selves as it were swallowed up of death and desperation; we utterly renounce
all worldly confidence, and the to thy sovereign bounty as our only stay and
refuge: beseeching thee not to call to remembrance our manifold sins and
wickedness, whereby we continually provoke thy wrath and indignation against
us; neither our negligence and unkindness, which have neither worthily
esteemed, nor in our lives sufficiently expressed the sweet comfort of thy
gospel revealed unto us: but rather to accept the obedience and death of thy
Son Jesus Christ, who by offering up his body in sacrifice once for all, has
made a sufficient recompense for all our sins. Have mercy therefore upon us, O
Lord, and forgive us our offenses. Teach us by thy holy Spirit that we may
rightly weigh them, and earnestly repent us for the same. And so much the
rather, O Lord, because that the reprobate and such as thou have forsaken
cannot praise thee, nor call upon thy name; but the repenting heart, the
sorrowful mind, the conscience oppressed, hungring and thirsting for thy
grace, shall ever set forth thy praise and glory. And albeit we be but worms
and dust, yet thou art our Creator, and we be the work of thy hands; yea, thou
art our Father, and we thy children; thou art our Shepherd, and we thy flock;
thou art our Redeemer, and we thy people whom thou have bought; thou art our
God, and we thine inheritance. Correct us not therefore in thine anger, O Lord,
neither according to our deserts punish us, but mercifully chastise us with a
fatherly affection, that all the world may know, that at what time so ever a
sinner does repent him of his sins from the bottom of his heart, thou will put
away all his wickedness out of thy remembrance, as thou have promised by thy
holy prophet.

Finally, forasmuch as it has pleased thee to make the night for man to rest
in, as thou have ordained him the day to travail in; grant, O dear Father, that
we may so take our bodily rest, that our souls may continually watch for the
time that our Lord Jesus Christ shall appear for our deliverance out of this
mortal life: and in the mean season that we not overcome by any fantasies,
dreams, or other temptations, may fully set our minds upon thee, love thee,
fear thee, and rest in thee: furthermore, that our sleep be not excessive or
overmuch, after the insatiable desires of the flesh, but only sufficient to
content our weak nature, that we may be the better disposed to live in all
godly conversation, to the glory of thy most holy name, and the profit of our
brethren. So be it.

A godly prayer to be said at all times.
Honor and praise be given to thee, O Lord God almighty, most dear Father of
heaven, for all thy mercies and loving kindness showed unto us, in that it has
pleased thy gracious goodness, freely and of thine own accord, to elect and
choose us to salvation, before the beginning of the world; and even like
continual thanks be given to thee for creating us after thine own image, for
redeeming us with the precious blood of thy dear Son when we were utterly lost,
for sanctifying us with thy holy Spirit in the revelation and knowledge of thy
holy word, for helping and succouring us in all our needs and necessities, for
saving us from all dangers of body and soul, for comforting us so fatherly in
all our tribulations and persecutions, for sparing us so long and giving us so
large a time of repentance. These benefits, O most merciful Father, like as we
acknowledge to have received them of thy only goodness; even so we beseech
thee for thy dear Son Jesus Christ's sake, grant us always thy holy Spirit, that
we may continually grow in thankfulness toward thee, to be led in all truth,
and comforted in all our adversities. O Lord, strengthen our faith, kindle it
more in ferventness and love toward thee, and our neighbors for thy sake.
Suffer us not, most dear Father, to receive thy word any more in vain: but
grant us always the assistance of thy grace and holy Spirit, that in heart,
word and deed we may sanctify and do worship to thy name, help to amplify and
increase thy kingdom, and whatsoever thou sendest, we may be heartily well
content with thy good pleasure and will. Let us not lack the thing, O Father,
without the which we cannot serve thee; but bless thou so all the works of our
hands, that we may have sufficient, and not be chargeable, but rather helpful
to others. Be merciful, O Lord, to our offenses; and seeing our debt is great
which thou have forgiven us in Jesus Christ, make us to love thee and our
neighbors so much ye more. Be thou our Father, our captain and defender in all
temptations, hold thou us by thy merciful hand, that we may be delivered from
all inconveniences, and end our lives in the sanctifying and honoring of thy
holy name, through Jesus Christ our Lord and only Savior. So be it.

Let thy mighty hand and outstretched arm, O Lord, be still our defense; thy
mercy and loving kindness in Jesus Christ thy dear Son, our salvation; thy true
and holy word, our instruction; thy grace and holy Spirit, our comfort and
consolation, unto the end and in the end. So be it.

O Lord, increase our faith.
A confession for all estates and times.
O Eternal God and most merciful Father, we confess and acknowledge here before
thy divine Majesty, that we are miserable sinners, conceived and born in sin
and iniquity, so that in us there is no goodness. For the flesh evermore
rebelleth against the spirit, whereby we continually transgress thy holy
precepts and commandments, and so purchase to our selves through thy just
judgment, death and damnation. Notwithstanding, O heavenly Father, forasmuch
as we are displeased with our selves for the sins ye we have committed against
thee, and do unfeignedly repent us of the same, we most humbly beseech thee for
Jesus Christ's sake to show thy mercy upon us, to forgive us all our sins, and
increase thy holy Spirit in us, that we acknowledging from the bottom of our
hearts our own unrighteousness, may from henceforth not only mortify our
sinful lusts and affections, but also bring forth such fruits as may be
agreeable to thy most blessed will, not for the worthiness thereof, but for the
merits of thy dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ our only Savior, whom thou have
already given an oblation and offering for our sins, and for whose sake we are
certainly persuaded that thou will deny us nothing that we shall ask in his
name, according to thy will; for thy Spirit does assure our consciences that
thou art our merciful Father, and so love us thy children through him, that
nothing is able to remove thy heavenly grace and favor from us. To thee
therefore, O Father, with thy Son, and the holy Ghost, be all honor and glory
world without end. Amen.

A prayer to be said before a man begin his work.
O Lord God most merciful Father and Savior, seeing it has pleased thee to
command us to travail, that we may relieve our need; we beseech thee of thy
grace so to bless our labors, that thy blessing may extend unto us, without
the which we are not able to continue; and that this great favor may be a
witness unto us of thy bountifulness and assistance, so that thereby we may
know the fatherly care that thou have over us. Moreover, O Lord, we beseech
thee, that thou would strengthen us with thy holy Spirit, that we may
faithfully travail in our estate and vocation, without fraud or deceit; and
that we may endeavor our selves to follow thy holy ordinance, rather then to
seek to satisfy our greedy affections, or desire to gain. And if it please
thee, O Lord to prosper our labor, give us a mind also to help them that have
need, according to that ability that thou of thy mercy shall give us. And
knowing that all good things come of thee, grant that we may humble our selves
to our neighbors, and not by any means lift up our selves above them which
have not received so liberal a portion as thou of thy mercy have given unto us.
And if it please thee to try and exercise us by greater poverty and need then
our flesh would desire, that thou would yet, O Lord, grant us grace to know
that thou will nourish us continually through thy bountiful liberality, that we
be not so tempted that we fall into distrust, but that we may patiently wait
till thou fill us, not only with corporal graces and benefits, but chiefly
with thy heavenly and spiritual treasures, to the intent that we may always
have more ample occasion to give thee thanks, and so wholly to rest upon thy
mercies. Hear ^s, O Lord of mercy, through Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord and
Savior. Amen.

A prayer for the whole estate of Christ's Church.
ALmighty God and most merciful Father, we humbly submit our selves and fall
down before thy divine Majesty, beseeching thee from the bottom of our hearts,
that the seed of thy word now sown amongst us, may take such deep root, that
neither the burning heat of persecution cause it to wither, neither the thorny
cares of this life choke it; but that as seed sown in good ground, it may bring
forth thirty, sixty, and an hundre^-fold, as thy heavenly wisdom has
appointed. And because we have need continually to crave many things at thy
hands, we humbly beseech thee, O heavenly Father, to grant us thy holy Spirit
to direct our petitions, that they may proceed from such a fervent mind, as
may be agreeable to thy most blessed will. And seeing that our infirmity is
able to do nothing without thy help, and that thou art not ignorant with how
many and great temptations we poor wretches are on every side enclosed and
compassed; let thy strength, O Lord, sustain our weakness, that we being
defended with the force of thy grace, may be safely preserved against all
assaults of Satan, who goes about continually like a roaring lion seeking to
devour us. Increase our faith, O merciful Father, that we do not swerve at any
time from thy heavenly word; but augment in us hope and love, with a careful
keeping of all thy commandments, that no hardness of heart, no hypocrisy, no
concupiscence of the eyes, nor inticements of the world, do draw us away from
thy obedience. And seeing we live now in these most perilous times, let thy
fatherly providence defend us against the violence of our enemies, which do
seek by all means to oppress thy truth.

Furthermore, forasmuch as by thy holy Apostle we be taught to make our prayers
and supplications for all men; we pray not only for our selves here present,
but beseech thee also, to reduce all such as be yet ignorant, from the
miserable captivity of blindness and error, to the pure understanding and
knowledge of thy heavenly truth, that we all with one consent, and unity of
mind, may worship thee our only God and Savior: and that all pastors,
shepherds and ministers, to whom thou have committed the dispensation of thy
holy word and charge of thy chosen people, may both in their life and doctrine
be found faithful, setting only before their eyes thy glory; and that by them
all poor sheep which wander and go astray, may be gathered and brought home to
thy fold. Moreover, because the hearts of all rulers are in thy hands, we
beseech thee to direct and govern the hearts of all kings, princes, and
magistrates, to whom thou have committed the sword. Especially, O Lord,
according to our bounden duty, we beseech thee to maintain and increase the
honorable estate of the Kings majesty, and all his most noble counselors and
magistrates, with all the spiritual pastors and ministers, and all the whole
body of this commonweal. Let thy fatherly favor so preserve them, and thy
holy Spirit so govern their hearts, that they may in such sort execute their
office, that thy religion may be purely maintained, manners reformed, and sin
punished, according to the precise rule of thy holy word. And for that we be
all members of the mystical body of Jesus Christ, we make our requests unto
thee, O heavenly Father, for all such as are afflicted with any kind of cross
or tribulation, as war, plague, famine, sickness, poverty, imprisonment,
persecution, banishment, or any other kind of thy rods, whether it be calamity
of body, or vexation of mind; that it would please thee to give them patience
and constancy, till thou send them full deliverance out of all their troubles.
Root out from hence, O Lord, all ravening wolves, which to fill their bellies
seek to destroy thy flock. And show thy great mercies upon those our brethren
in other countries, which are persecuted, cast into prison, and daily condemned
for the testimony of thy truth: and although they be utterly destitute of all
man's aid, yet let thy sweet comfort never depart from them; but so inflame
their hearts with thy holy Spirit, that they may boldly and cheerfully abide
such trial, as thy good wisdom shall appoint; so that at length, as well by
their death as by their life, the kingdom of thy dear Son Jesus Christ may
increase and shine through all the world. In whose name we make our humble
petitions unto thee as he has taught us:

Our Father which art, etc.

The confession of the Christian Faith.
I Believe and confess my Lord God, eternal, infinite, unmeasurable,
incomprehensible, and invisible, one in substance, and three in person, Father,
Son, and holy Ghost: who by his almighty power and wisdom, has not only of
nothing created heaven and earth, and all things therein contained, and man
after his own image, that he might in him be glorified; but also by his
fatherly providence governs, maintains, and preserves the same according
to the purpose of his will.

I believe also and confess Jesus Christ the only Savior and Messiah: who
being equal with God, made himself of no reputation, but took on him the shape
of a servant, and became man, in all things like unto us except sin, to assure
us of mercy and forgiveness. For when through our father Adams transgression,
we were become children of perdition, there was no means to bring us from the
yoke of sin and damnation, but only Jesus Christ our Lord; who giving us that
by grace, which was his by nature, made us through faith the children of God:
Who when the fullness of time was come, was conceived by the power of the holy
Ghost, born of the virgin Mary according to the flesh, and preached in earth
the Gospel of salvation: till at length by tyranny of the priests, he was
guiltless condemned under Pontius Pilate then President of Jewry, and most
slanderously hanged on the cross between two thieves, as a notorious
trespasser; where taking upon him the punishment of our sins, he delivered us
from the curse of the law. And forasmuch as he being only God could not feel
death, neither being only man could overcome death; he joined both together,
and suffered his humanity to be punished with most cruel death, feeling in
himself the anger and severe judgment of God, even as he had been in extreme
torments of hell, and therefore cried with a loud voice, My God, my God, why
have thou forsaken me? Thus of his mercy without compulsion, he offered up
himself as the only sacrifice to purge the sins of all the world: So that all
other sacrifices for sin are blasphemous, and derogate from the sufficiency
hereof. Which death albeit it did sufficiently reconcile us to God, yet the
Scriptures commonly do attribute our regeneration to his resurrection. For as
by rising again from the grave the third day, he conquered death; even so the
victory of our faith stands in his resurrection: and therefore without the
one we cannot feel the benefits of the other. For as by his death sin was taken
away, so our righteousness was restored by his resurrection. And because he
would accomplish all things, and take possession for us in his kingdom, he
ascended into heaven to enlarge the same kingdom by the abundant power of his
Spirit, by whom we are most assured of his continual intercession toward God
the Father for us. And although he be in heaven as touching his corporal
presence, where the Father has now set him at his right hand, committing unto
him the administration of all things, as well in heaven above, as in the earth
beneath; yet is he present with us his members, even to the end of the world,
in preserving and governing us with his effectual power and grace: Who, when
all things are fulfilled which God has spoken by ye mouth of all his prophets
since the world began, will come in the same visible form in the which he
ascended, with an unspeakable majesty* power, and company, to separate the
lambs from the goats, the elect from the reprobate: so that none whether he be
alive then, or dead before, shall escape his judgment.

Moreover, I believe and confess the holy Ghost, God equal with the Father and
the Son; who regenerateth and sanctifies us, rules and guides us unto all
truth, persuading most assuredly in our consciences, that we be the children of
God, brethren to Jesus Christ, and fellow heirs with him of life everlasting.

Yet notwithstanding it is not sufficient to believe that God is omnipotent and
merciful, that Christ has made satisfaction, or that the holy Ghost has his
power and effect, except we do apply the same benefits to us which are Gods
elect. I believe therefore and confess one holy Church; which (as members of
Jesus Christ the only Head thereof) consent in faith, hope and charity, using
the gifts of God, whether they be temporal or spiritual, to the profit and
furtherance of the same. Which Church is not seen to man's eye, but only known
to God: who of the lost sons of Adam, has ordained some as vessels of wrath to
damnation, and has chosen others as vessels of his mercy to be saved; the
which in due time he calls to integrity of life, and godly conversation, to
make them a glorious Church in himself. But that Church which is visible and
seen to the eye, has three tokens and marks whereby it may be known. First,
the word of God contained in the old and new Testament: Which as it is above
the authority of the same Church, and only sufficient to instruct us in all
things concerning salvation; so is it left for all degrees of men, to read and
understand. For without this word, neither Church, Council, nor Decree can
establish any point touching salvation. The second is the holy Sacraments, to
wit, of Baptism, and the Lords Supper. Which Sacraments Christ has left unto
us as holy signs and leals of his promises. For as by Baptism once received, is
signified, that we (as well infants, as others of age and discretion) being
strangers from God by original sin, are received into his family and
congregation, with full assurance, that although this root of sin lie hid in
us, yet to the elect it shall not be imputed: so the Supper declares, that God
as a most provident Father, does not only feed our bodies, but also
spiritually nourishes our souls with the graces and benefits of Jesus Christ,
which the Scripture calls eating of his flesh, and drinking of his blood.
Neither must we in the administration of these Sacraments follow man's fantasy;
but as Christ himself has ordained, so must they be ministered, and by such as
by ordinary vocation are thereunto called. Therefore whosoever reserveth and
worshippeth these Sacraments, or contrariwise contemns them in time and
place, procures to himself damnation. The third mark of this Church is
Ecclesiastical Discipline; which stands in admonition, and correction of
faults. The final end whereof is excommunication by the consent of the Church
determined, if the offender be obstinate. And besides this Ecclesiastical
Discipline, I acknowledge to belong to this Church a politic magistrate, who
ministers to every man justice, defending the good, and punishing the evil; to
whom we must render honor and obedience in all things which are not contrary
to the word of God. And as Moses, Ezechias, Josias, and other good rulers
purged the Church of God from superstition and idolatry: so the defense of
Christ's Church appertains to Christian magistrates, against all idolaters and
heretics, as Papists, Anabaptists, with such like limbs of Antichrist, to root
out all doctrine of devils and men; as the mass, purgatory, limbus patrum,
prayers to saints, and for the dead, free will, distinction of meats, apparel
and days, vows of single life, presence at idol-service, man's merits, with such
like, which draw us from the society of Christ's Church wherein stands only
remission of sins, purchased by Christ's blood to all them that believe, whether
they be Jews or Gentiles, and lead us to a vain confidence in creatures, and
trust in our own imaginations. The punishment whereof although God oftentimes
deferreth in this life, yet after the general resurrection, when our souls and
bodies shall rise again to immortality, they shall be damned to unquenchable
fire: and then we which have forsaken all men's wisdom to cleave unto Christ,
shall hear the joyful voice, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the beginning of the world; and so shall go triumphing
with him in body and soul to remain everlastingly in glory, where we shall see
God face to face, and shall no more need to instruct one another; we shall all
know him from the highest to the lowest. To whom with the Son and the holy
Ghost, be all praise, honor, and glory, now and ever. So be it,
