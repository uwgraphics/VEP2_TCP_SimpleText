SUMMA PRIVILEGII. Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiastical, 1640. Artic. 8.
WHereas the Preaching of order and decency, according to St. Paul' s rule,
does conduce to edification, it is required that all Preachers (as well
beneficed men as others) shall positively and plainly preach and instruct the
people in their public Sermons, twice in the year at least, that the Rites and
Ceremonies now established in the Church of England, are lawful and
commendable, and that they the said people and others ought to conform
themselves in their practice to all the said Rites and Ceremonies, and that the
people and others ought willingly to submit themselves unto the authority and
government of the Church, as it is now established under the King's Majesty.
And if any Preacher shall neglect or refuse to do according to this Canon; let
him be suspended by his Ordinary during the time of his refusal, or wilful
forbearance to do thereafter.

TO THE Right Reverend Father in GOD, HENRY, Lord Bishop of LONDON, Dean of the
CHAPEL ROYAL, AND One of His Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council.
May it please Your Lordship,
WHen the following Sermon was preached, which is now a full twelvemonth ago
and as much as since the latter end of October, it made so great a noise about
the Town, and was the occasion of so loud a cry against me from a d^sloyal and
disaffected party, that I was forced immediately to put it to the Press, not
out of any vain opinion which I had of my performance, which, as it was but
mean in it self, so it could not be well expected that it should be better,
considering the short^ess of the time which was spent in the composing, but for
my own just and necessary vindication, that the world might see and be
satisfied what it was that had opened the mouth of Calumny and Detraction so
wide; and Your Lordship having received information that there was a design to
make my Sermon public, which Iacknowledge I ought not to have done without
Your Lordship's good leave, by whose commission and authority it was preached,
I was commanded to deliver up my Notes to be perused by Your Lordship before
they went to the Press; but it so happening that they were then actually in it,
before that order came, and the first sheet having been printed off, all the
possibility of Obedience that was left me was, to recall my Papers from the
Press and lay them at Your Lordship's feet, as they were, torn in pieces by the
Printer, and in a condition very much ashamed to make their appearance before
You.

Your Lordship was sensible of the confusion my Papers, as well as my self were
in, and would not suffer them to blush in your presence, but was pleased to
dismiss me in a most obliging manner, for which unexpected goodness, when I
came so apprehensive, as I was, of a less favorable usage, I am bound to pay
you my everlasting thanks, and to command me further, not without expressing
some trouble at the incivility and indiscretion of Sir P. W. which was indeed
an affront to Your Lordship and the whole Clergy of the three Kingdoms in my
person, to let you see the Papers when they were printed.

I came away, as I had reason, from Whitehall, where I had the honor to pay my
duty to Your Lordship then going to the Council, not only well satisfied, but
very much transported with so obliging an answer; and having now a License from
your self, as well as from the Eighth of the Ecclesiastical Canons made and set
forth by a Convocation of the two Provinces in 1640. whereby we are obliged
twice every year to preach upon the Subject of Decency and Order (and
whatsoever may be preached, may be printed also if occasion so require) I had
now a double encouragement to go on with the Impression, and accordingly I did
go on.

If Your Lordship shall demand of me, as it is very natural for you to do,
what was the reason of its publication being so long delayed, all the answer I
can make is that it was, (so far was I at first from designing it for the
Press, had I not been provoked to it by the clamours of the worst of men, as
well as encouraged to stand up in my own defense by such as were friends to the
Government, and by consequence to me) I say, as it was, I found it to be a very
imperfect and unfinished piece, and such as had reason to apprehend the
censures of its friends as well as enemies; therefore I presumed to take the
liberty, not to alter any thing which I had spoken, but only to add so much to
it, as might make a just disquisition upon the Subject, and yet if I had taken
a liberty of making alterations, so it had been only in the expression, not
the sense, it would have been such a liberty as would have been vouched by the
best examples that antiquity affords: Pliny, as himself confesses in his
Epistles, did so by his Panegyric to the Emperor Trajan; and before him that
great Master as well of thought as expression did the same by his Oration in
defense of Milo, and not to say any thing of the Verrine Orations, and the
invectives against Catiline, it is very reasonable to believe that the
Philippicks, instead of being burnt as Anthony would have had them, have been
transmitted to Posterity with an improvement of incensed eloquence and
Ciceronian rage.

There is one thing indeed, which I know not whether I ought to mention or no,
which did receive some little alteration, if the omission of a Line or two, for
it was no more, may be called by that name; and that is, that upon occasion of
discourse concerning the persecution still raging in the Territories of the
French King, I did speak of his Majesty, out of the zeal I had for the
Protestant Religion, and being under no tie of obedience to a foreign Prince,
but only of respect to his Character if he do worthily sustain it, with so
much sharpness and Satyr, comparing his Persecution to that of Nero, Maximine
or Dioclesian which was the very thing and the only thing that was omitted,
that there were persons, as I suppose, appointed by the Congregation de
propaganda side, the Committee that manage the interest of the Faction, to buz
in my ears, as an argument to discourage me from publishing what I had spoken,
that my Sermon would have the honor of being translated into French, for the
use of Monsieur Barillon; that a complaint would be made by the French
Ambassador in a memorial on set purpose, that I had broken the Peace between
the two Nations, and that a Fellow of a College, that had not so much as a
Pupil to take his part, had presumed barely with the assistance of his Sizar, a
worthy Squire to so redoubted a Knight, to levy actual War upon the most potent
and formidable Prince that these latter Ages of the World have seen; though I
was not sensible that I had said any more, than they themselves who made use of
this advantage against me, are every day speaking among one another with a
bitterness of Language peculiar to the men that use it; though for this perhaps
the French King is to thank them that they take no more liberty with him than
they do with their own rightful Sovereign and natural liege Lord, the one for
subverting the Protestant Religion, and the other for maintaining it, which
shows them to be a People so very hard to be pleased that I am resolved never
to be a servant to such difficult Masters; for as Aristophanes says rightly in
the entrance into his Plutus, (...)
(...);
Neither indeed, when all comes to all, have I said any more than what most of
the Princes and States of Christendom have publicly complained of by their
Ambassadors and Agents in the Court of France, and what is sufficiently
justified by that excellent Person Dr. George Hickes, a great ornament of
Learning, and as able a Champion for the established Religion as ever the field
of controversy has afforded, has verified to a tittle in his judicious
Sermon concerning the True Notion of Persecution, a Discourse which I wish with
all my heart those of the Separation would take the pains to read, that
complain so much, but so unjustly of the subject of it.

So that I think upon the whole matter Sorbiere's case and mine are very
different from one another, though that were the example that was used to
fright me, for I have not spoken contemptibly of the French Nation, which I
have always accounted of as a gallant People, valiant in War and always
excelling in all the arts of Peace, much less have I dared to vilify the
awful Majesty of so great a King, whose Sovereign Power I do as much
acknowledge to be an image of the divine, inviolable, sacred, and never to be
mentioned without reverence and honor, as I do that of our Royal Master
himself, the best of Princes, the Father of his Country, the delight of
Mankind, the wonder of this Age, and the inimitable Example of all that are to
come, but yet I think it to be such an image as it would be inexcusable
Idolatry in me who am an English Subject to fall down and worship.

And as my case is very different from that of Sorbiere so are my circumstances
too; for he they tell me for the indignities he put upon the English Nation,
the bravest people that the Sun beholds, was deservedly turned out of all, but
I am humbly bold to tell Your Lordship and the rest of my Superiors that I
have nothing out of which to be turned and that I should think my self
comparatively happy in respect of what I am now, if I could be placed in his
circumstances without the crime that occasioned them, and as I am a stranger to
his circumstances and his crime so, I thank God, I am as far removed from his
Principles too, for he and his two friends Mersennus and Gassendi were of the
Religion of Malmsbury, if they had any at all, as appears by their joint
admiration of the Book De Cive, the Latin Leviathan that sports himself in
foreign waters as the English one does upon the British Coast, but I own no
principles that destroy the very nature and being of obligation, and are by
consequence enemies to Mankind.

But it is easy to discern that all I have yet said is by no means a
satisfactory answer to Your Lordship's, question, why the edition of this
Sermon has been so long delayed, for the Additions to it are not so
considerable that the twentieth part of all this time need to have been taken
up about them; and though indeed when I am brought to this pinch I cannot give
a good account of such a slow and dilatory proceeding, yet a true one I will be
sure to give, and it is this, that when I had written and printed off ten
sheets of this discourse, which is as much as I now publish, I launched out I
know not how or why, into things merely Philological and foreign to the
subject, and as it is usually, when men are got into a Labyrinth, they do but
lose themselves the more for endeavoring to get out, so one digression
bringing on another, I found I had wandered so far out of my way, that the
subjects I now employed my thoughts upon began to speak another Language from
that in which the former part of my discourse was written.

They that have a Talent at censuring will be apt to say that this proceeded
out of nothing else but a certain vanity and affectation of appearing learned,
and it may be this was indeed the very cause, since it will be difficult to
assign a better, though I am not sensible of it, and so far as I know any thing
of my self (but how few are there that do understand themselves?) I have no
such thing as pride or affectation in my nature, and in truth it would be very
inexcufable in me to be proud of any thing or to appear as if I were so, and
much more to resolve industriously, in spite of the Subject or the Company I am
in, to be talking of matters in which neither are concerned, because this is an
humor so tawdry and impertinent, and touches my imagination with so satirical
impressions upon it self, that of all things in the World it would appear the
most despicable to me, if it did not make me sick, as it always does, and no
man can properly be said to despise that which he fears.

But whatsoever were the true reason of so extravagant a ramble from the
subject and the Text, whether it proceeded out of vanity and foolish
ostentation, or whether it were only, what some that know me will be apt to
plead in my behalf, that I am naturally inclined by my constitution to digress
from every such Subject which I undertake, which I believe to be a true account
of the business, for I scarce ever set upon any thing in my life, but I was
always pestered with a multiplicity of thoughts, as perfect strangers to the
Subject and to one another, as all the several barbarous and distant Nations of
which the Ottoman forces are composed, who though they are all engaged upon a
common design, yet they understand not one another Language; I say whatever
were the true occasion of such an irregular composure, or whether Your Lordship
will referr it, besides the two causes I have lately mentioned to some decay of
mind, which my misfortunes may have brought upon me, yet thus much I know, that
when I came to consider and compare the sheets which I had written together, I
was very much ashamed of what I had done, and very angry with my self, insomuch
that I saw no hopes of being reconciled, but by throwing those papers, that had
made the difference, aside, to try if that way it were possible the business
might be forgotten, that so Richard and Baxter, who were at Mortal jarrs, might
be brought to a better understanding with one another; for it is a very
painful and uneasy thing for a man to be fallen out with himself, and if
there be any torment more exquisite than another, a thing of which all the
Philosophers but the Scepticks are agreed, I am clearly of opinion that the
shame and confusion resulting from a foolish and imprudent action is the worst
punishment belonging to humane nature.

Therefore I did, as it very nearly concerned me, use all the expedients I
could think of or devise, and made all the friends I could possibly to my self
that the business might be timely made up, and, as the last remedy, I was
resolved to forget it and to employ my meditations upon subjects of another and
a very different nature.

In this interval I writ that Discourse concerning the Laws of Nature and their
obligation, which is now abroad, as the second part of it lies by me ready for
the Press, only it wants transcribing, for it is written after so confused a
manner that no Compositor can deal with it at present; I writ also that
Epistle, which followed, concerning the Marriage of Cousin Germans, which has
suffered great variety of censures not only from the different capacity of its
readers, but from their different interests likewise, for it is generally the
nature of Mankind, that they will have nothing to be true which does not suit
with the circumstances they are or would be in, albeit when things are
impartially considered I can scarce believe there are twenty men in the King's
dominions that are concerned in point of interest or honor to believe what I
have written to be false, and I have some reason to believe that the most
considerable objection that lies against that short Essay, is that it will be
very long before any man who understands himself will be so hardy to undertake
to answer it.

There was one indeed who had a design of that nature, and though I know not
the person, yet his character I do, and so will Your Lordship likewise, when I
shall have told you that it was the loyal, learned and ingenious writer of
Constantius the Apostate, an adversary whom though for his known ability I had
reason to dread, yet having Nature and Antiquity so clearly on my side, I would
have chosen such an Antagonist before any other, both because in his advocation
and defense of Cousin Germans, the utmost strength of that cause would have
been brought into the Field, which would have brought the matter on one side or
other to a speedy issue; and because he was pleased to express himself in a
Letter of his which had no name at the bottom, with so much candor and
ingenuity toward me, and indeed so far above any thing which I pretend to
deserve, that I was well assured that the controversy would be managed on both
sides without any heat of words, with mutual kindness and civility toward each
other, as becomes those that know how to defend the truth without insolence,
and how to yield to it without shame, and that have joined the courtesy of
Gentlemen and the charity of Christians to the learning, judgment and ability
of Scholars; but upon what reason I know not he afterward desisted, as it
seems, from his design, and I do not speak this as if I would be thought to
send him a challenge by Your Lordship, which it would be very rude in me to
do, but I would rather make it my humble request to him, that he would suspend
his engaging in the controversy against me, till he have heard all I have to
say for my self, and then if my arguments will not demonstrate what they
pretend to do, I will as freely recant my opinion as ever I maintained it, and
give the World the reasons why I have altered my mind; in the mean time I look
upon my self as bound in gratitude and justice to let Your Lordship and the
World understand, how much I think my self obliged to so ingenious a man for
his favorable opinion of me, and that I should be glad to be as well
acquainted with his person, as I am with his unquestionable loyalty and
learning.

My Lord, I am very sensible that by what I writ upon that subject, I did incur
the displeasure of some for whom I have so great an honor, that I am very
uneasy under the sense and apprehension of it, though I have done nothing but
what I thought my duty at that time when I did it, and I see no reason yet to
alter my mind; but these are the common inconveniences of humane life to which
every wise and good man ought with a Philosophical patience and equality to
submit, as I do, and am very perfect in that Lesson, which by long practice I
have taught my self, of bearing with patience, as well the affronts and
indignities of mine enemies, as the misconstructions and misinterpretations of
my friends, for such I call all those who are friends to our common friends,
the King, the Church, and the Religion established, and that I might give no
farther occasion of offense, I have suspended for a while the publication of
what remains upon the same subject, till the controversy, not yet decided by
my Lords the Delegates, have received its final period and issue by their
judicious, honorable and wise determination.

And besides these papers which have been either published or are ready for the
Press, and were some of them begun and others finished during that time of my
retirement from my former studies and to another end of the Town, there was
another discourse which lay by me imperfect, being an exercitatation upon that
Law of Moses, whereby the Brother or the next of kin was obliged to raise up
seed to his deceased and childless Brother or Kinsman, a great part of which
was written by me at Cambridge, as a preparatory to that other Treatise of the
Marriage of Cousin Germans, which it is now a long time that my thoughts and
studies have been conversant about, and being so much of it as was then done,
transcribed in a very fair and legible hand, it was the greater temptation to
me to send it to the Press, as I did, and have added so much to what I had
written at the College, that it requires but very little to put a conclusion to
it.

In this Discourse, as I have considered all the cases and circumstances of
that Law, with much more exactness than any have done before me, so I have
particularly levelled a considerable part of it against one Chapter of Mr.
Seldom in his Book De Successionibus, and have very largely exposed the vanity
of the Rabbinical Learning, and the manifest unskilfulness of that sort of men
in the Antiquities of their own Nation; and if I have not found out a new Key
to open and interpret the Mosaic Law, yet thus much at least I have done, I
have applied it to several Laws, to which it has not been applied before, and
have abundantly discovered the extreme impudence, as well as ignorance of the
Egyptian Moses and other celebrated Masters of the Jewish Learning.

I have likewise in an occasional Essay upon that subject demonstrated the
Antiquity of Episcopal and Diocesan government in the Jewish Church, the
dependence of the inferior Clergy upon the Bishop of the Diocese, and the
subjection of all the Bishops of the Province of Judaea to the Archbishop, or
High Priest, at Jerusalem: I have shown that this was the Government to which
our Savior and his Apostles, being members of the Jewish Church, submitted;
and not only so, but that the Jews had among them a Patriarchal dignity
likewise, that is, such Bishops as having their usual residence in Jerusalem or
in Judaea, had the care and inspection of the Churches in the dispersion, which
was likewise imitated by our Savior in his model of the Christian Church; and
certainly if their be no such harm in a Patriarch, that is, a foreign visitour
or inspectour, if this were imitated and approved by our Savior himself, then
much ^^ss can there lie any exception against a domestic and residing Bishop,
to whose authority likewise our Savior submitted, and consequently approved of
that sort of Government, which I will grant in its first original to have been
of humane institution, if that will please our Dissenters, for all they will
get by it will be this, that our Savior himself did allow of humane
institutions in the Christian Church, and did submit to them, and that this not
being a part of the Mosaic Law, so far as that Law consisted of types and
shadows which were to be done away, (as being fulfilled and answered by their
antitype in the person and dispensation and sacrifice of Christ) the reasons of
convenience upon which this government was founded, remain still the same, and
therefore that there is no reason why it should be altered though it had not
been recommended to us by our Savior's example, which may justly be thought to
give it a jus divinum, though it had none before, for he was by no means a
Presbyterian, and much less an Independent.

And yet if this business be examined into the bottom, though the granting it
to be of humane institution will do the Separatists no manner of service, it
will be found that this government was instituted by Moses, and established by
Joshua, both of which acted by divine appointment, and by consequence it having
nothing which was properly Judaical, that is, which was of a Typical or
Symbolical nature, nothing that had any necessary dependence upon or conexion
with their Sacrifices and lustrations and other Ceremonies of that Vmbratick
dispensation, there is the same reason why it should last after those shadows
were done away, as well as when they were looked upon to be in full force, and
were esteemed the most indispensably sacred.

I have also in the same treatise demonstrated the antiquity and the reason of
the Priestly maintenance by tithes, and I have shown upon what account it was
that the tenth of all the fruits of the Earth, and the increase of Cattle was
offered to God, and that the reason holds every whit as good to this day as it
was either in the Levitical times or in those that went before them.

And upon this occasion I have considered very briefly the question so much
controverted concerning usury, I have demonstrated its lawfulness to all but
the ancient Jews, and by the same clue I have opened a way to a better
understanding of the Chronology of the times before the Flood, and so long
after it as the age of man was reckoned to be an hundred and twenty years, and
have besides made it evidently appear what was the true meaning of the (...),
the (...), and the (...), in the computation of the ancient Chaldeans, and what
it was that gave both name and notion to the Kalendae and the Idus among the
Romans, things that are as yet a secret to the World.

But it being so ordered by divine providence that while I was employed in this
kind of meditations, there fell a living void in this City, in the gift of the
worshipful Company of Salters, I laid my antiquities aside to try what
interest I could make among them, for the obtaining their favor in the
disposal of it, and I was so successful, thanks to my good friends, who
appeared very zealous, and very numerous for me, that had the business poceeded
to a Poll when the first Court was called, which was a common hall consisting
of the whole freedom, I have reason to believe my circumstances at that time
would have carried it against any of my Competitours, although my merit were
very short of some.

And now having laid aside my new designs, compelled by a welcome necessity of
my affairs, as I had done my old ones for another reason, I began, as I had
leisure from that continual hurry in which my competition had engaged me to sit
down and consider seriously with my self, which I could not do without a
mixture of pleasure and melancholy together, in what a labyrinth of different
and disagreeing undertakings I had entangled my self; and being returned again
from a remote corner of the Town, into the neighborhood of Decency and Order,
I had, as it is usual with old friends, a very great desire notwithstanding the
late unkindness that had past between us, to see them once more and renew our
our old acquaintance, and try if it were possible, in the midst of such
confusion, to reduce them to a better agreement with themselves, as well as
with me, and make them answer to their own names, instead of those of Chaos,
Rhapsodie and Cento, by which they now began to be much better known.

And the best expedient I could think of to save my self harmless from the
censures of men, with as little injury to the Bookseller as might be, (for I
would have no man suffer upon my account if I could help it) was after a
retrenchment of several sheets, which are now wholly lost, and indeed were very
unfit to see the light, to divide the remainder into two several parts, not
such parts as had a mutual connection and dependence, but such as are wholly
what they are, by themselves, without any manner of relation or affinity to
each other.

The first of them is that with which I now present Your Lordship, which all
but the last six or seven pages has lain by as it is, for at least eighteen
months last past, and is, if I do not very much mistake my self and it, not
only a very pertinent discourse upon the subject it pretends to treat about,
but a very unanswerable one too, if any thing may be thought unanswerable in an
age where noise and faction supply the room of argument and reason, and where
instead of being yielded to as it ought to be by honest and unprejudiced minds,
the more convincing any argument is, with so much the greater violence and fury
it is opposed, and they that are able to speak the least good sense will always
be sure to make the loudest noise.

Sic ego torrentem qua nil obstabat eunti
Lenius and modico strepitu decurrere vidi,
Sed quacunque trabes, obstructaque saxa tenebant,
Spumeus and fervens and ab obice saevior ibat.
That other part which is likewise finished from the Press and shall
immediately come abroad by it self, consists of these two Philological
dissertations, the first concerning the true time of our Savior's Passover, an
enquiry that has of a long time baffled the endeavors of learned men, but
will now cease to be a question any longer; the second concerning the true
pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton, in which likewise, though it be not a
problem of such moment as the other, several very famous antiquaries and men
of the most considerable remark for learning have gone before me; but it will
appear, I hope, by my discourse upon that curious, though minute, subject, that
they have all been mistaken, and that the true secret has been reserved for
me, a man by no means to be compared with any of them, to interpret and
explain; but so it often happens that chance finds out what art and industry
have in vain sought after, and an accidental thought that wanders in the brain
with all the undesigning carelessness of a dream, may carry us directly to the
discovery of some truth, which has been courted in vain by the professed
addresses of more ingenious and diligent inquirers.

In what I have said upon the first of these, I have demonstrated the only
true signification of that which St. Luke calls the (...), or as we translate
it, the second Sabbath after the first, contrary to the several disagreeing
conjectures and accounts, disagreeing with the truth and inconsistent with
themselves, as well as with one another, which have been sent abroad by Joseph
Scaliger, Johannes Cloppenburge, Ludovic^s Capellus and Hugo Grotius, all very
great names, and all in this respect very widely mistaken, and by the account
which I have given, there is some light afforded to the ancient Jewish
Calendar, which was certainly quite another thing than the Kalendarium
Hebraicum of Sebastian Munster, and much ancienter than the Talmudical Canons
for the observation of the Jewish feasts, which are but a modern invention of
the ignorant Rabbis who make new antiquities to supply the room of the old
ones which they have lost, notwithstanding the authority which that Imposture
has m^t with from several very eminent scholars and very excellent persons.

In my discourse of the Tetragrammaton I have considered very largely the
Tetractys of the Pythagorean School, and I think have shown sufficiently what a
fondness it has been in almost all the learned writers that have written upon
the subject, to derive the latter of them from the former, and though in this I
will not be so positive as in my other conjectures, yet thus much I will say of
it, that I have bid very fairly for the discovery of the Tetractys; and whether
I have or no, I make my humble appeal to Your Lordship and other learned and
judicious men that have a palate in matters of this nature, but to Your
Lordship in the first place, whose patronage it begs, and humbly implores the
powerful protection of so great a name against the rude assaults of ignorance
and envy.

That which made me the more willing to publish the former of these
exercitations was, that I was under an engagement to the public for a
discourse of that nature, it being no more than what I did expressly promise in
the Epistle Dedicatory before the Sermon concerning Transubstantiation, which
it is now near four years ago that I preached before the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen of this famous City, and it was in obedience to that wise and
venerable Court that it was afterward printed; and it is a farther service
which I now pretend to do to the Protestant Religion, by settling the exact
time of our Savior's last Supper, which was a night before the legal Passover
was killed, and consequently was in imitation not of the real, which could not
be killed before the usual time, but of the Mnemoneutical or commemorative
Passover, as Grotius calls it, wherefore the body of Christ, which is our
Christian Passover, was not at that time truly eaten by the Disciples, but
only a remembrance of it, a Proleptical remembrance it was, as it must needs
be, being instituted by our Savior himself, then present among his Disciples,
as the Mnemoneutical Passover among the Jews was a Postliminious
commemoration. But of this notion of the true time of our Savior's last
Supper, so far as concerns the application of it, which in the papers I now
speak of, I have not meddled with, I shall speak more largely in some other
papers, written ex professo against that blasphemous and absurd tenet in
another Language, which shall shortly be communicated to the World, and I hope
will find a favorable acceptance in it.

But however wide a discourse of this nature may seem to be from the subject of
my Text, the occasion of it was pertinent enough, for I was speaking of our
blessed Lord's submitting himself, as became the Preacher and the Prince of
peace, to humane institutions in religious matters, which is an undeniable
argument that such like institutions are not in themselves unlawful to be
complied with; for he preaches by his example as well as by his doctrine, and
the occurrences of his most innocent and spotless life, are in many cases, as
clear testimonies of the divine will, as the express declarations of his
Gospel; wherefore this Mnemoneutical or commemorative Passover among the Jews,
with all the peculiar rites and usages belonging to it, being a matter
perfectly of humane institution the Law having only enjoined the real one, or
that which Grotius calls the (...), the sacrificial Passover, upon the 14th
day of the first, or in some cases of the second month, this alone, if there
had been nothing else, would have been sufficient in the way of instance,
besides what I have urged from the nature and necessity of the thing it self,
to prove that humane institutions for the better ordering and government of
religious duties are not only lawful in themselves, but that they ought to be
obeyed by us, if there be no particular reason from the quality of the thing
enjoined to the contrary, as they were by Christ, who gave in this an example
of obedience, and we cannot be his Disciples if we do not follow it.

But as it was not proper in a discourse that was intended to have the shape
and appearance of a Sermon to launch out into so large a Philological
disquisition, of which there are so very few of those that hear Sermons that
can be supposed to be competent Judges, so indeed it was needless to give a
particular instance, when our Savior's communion with the Jewish Church,
during the whole time of his sojourning among men, is it self an aggregate of a
thousand arguments to prove the lawfulness of humane impositions; for without
such impositions there can be no communion, any more than there can be a City
or Commonwealth without Laws, or a society without some rules and orders to
govern it self by, the submitting to which rules is that in which the very
being of a society consists, and the breaking of those measures by an universal
disobedience is a disparking the society, a pulling down the pale and barrier
of the body politic, and a letting all things loose into the state of nature,
that is, into a state of tumult, confusion and disorder.

For the other Diatriba upon the Shem Hameporash, as the Rabbis call it, or
the Four lettered name of God, I cannot say that it came in so well, but rather
must acknowledge that it was too slight an occasion which was taken hold of to
entertain the Reader's curiosity upon it; but as it happens in conversation, if
a man leave the company but for half a minute, he shall find oftentimes the
discourse as much altered when he returns again, as if he had staid away a
thousand years, or as if it were another company into which he was now fallen;
so it will always be in writing likewise, if a man do not keep a guard upon his
thoughts, but allow his fancy a liberty of ranging, which it will easily do in
a small space of time, over things at an infinite distance from one another.

However an essay of this nature considered by it self, though it will not
contribute any thing to the use of common life, yet it cannot be unpleasant to
any man to know for certain what the true pronunciation of that peculiar name
of God was, by which he is pleased to signalize and distinguish himself in an
especial manner from all created and dependent beings that are called Gods, but
are not what they are called; that name whose true and genuine pronunciation
has been lost for so long a succession of ages, for neither Josephus nor Philo
Judaeus were acquainted with it, and the Jewish Rabbis are generally agreed
(which discovers how ignorant they are themselves, and how unconscionably given
to impose upon others) that it was known only to the High Priest, and never
pronounced by him neither, but only once a year, in the most holy place, when
he brought his piaculary censer, within the vail upon the solemn day of
expiation: For I have not only solidly demonstrated what the true
pronunciation of this name was, but I have proved that there were other names
of God in Scripture that were equally sacred, though it is true they are owing
to the same root from whence this is derived, and that it was not only known
among the Jews themselves but that also the heathen nations were acquainted
with it, for Rabshekah in the sacred volume mentions it expressly, and Philo
Byblius the translatour of Sanchuniathon, a very ancient writer of the
Phoenician story, who lived in the interval of the Judges, has made it so far
from being any secret that he has long ago divulged it to the whole learned
World.

If Your Lordship shall demand of me, what it was that moved me, having
suffered them to lie asleep so long, to publish these papers just at this nick
of time; there are two things which I presume to offer as the reasons why I
took this opportunity, after so long a silence, to let them come abroad and
speak for themselves, and for the Church of England, which they pretend to
maintain, as well as for my self, the writer of them, who having suffered so
much upon their account, they are bound in justice to do me what right they
can, which I imagine they will sufficiently do by adventuring abroad and
putting themselves upon a fair and public trial.

One thing that moved me to publish them at this time was, that I thought they
would be as much, or rather more seasonable at this juncture than at that in
which they were written, and for this I had not only mine own opinion, but, as
I may interpret it, Your Lordship's also, together with the concurring suffrage
of all those reverend, learned and judicious persons, who are now employed, as
I have been informed, by the particular appointment and direction of Your
Lordship, whose paternal care suffers no possible expedient to be unattempted,
to procure the peace and unity of this Church, to satisfy the dissenters, as
many of them as act upon a principle of conscience, without design, in all the
pretended matters of difference between us, and to clear up the misty
Atmosphere of religious doubt, which has been raised by zeal, but is not yet
dispelled for want of knowledge; a design worthy of so great a Prelate, so
truly pious, so profoundly wise, so indefatigably good, and suitable to the
nobleness of so large a mind that has joined so much personal honor and so
much honor of inheritance together.

And though in the midst of so many great performances, in which the strength,
eloquence and prudence of the writers maintain an equal combat with each other,
I cannot hope that mine will do any thing which is not effectually done by
some of theirs; yet I thought it my duty upon this occasion not to be wanting
to the common cause, and rather to betray, though I hope there is no danger of
that, my want of skill or ability to maintain it, as it ought to be maintained,
than of affection to serve it to the utmost of my power.

If I have been so fortunate to stumble upon any thing, which has not been
thought of or considered by some of them, it is a new mite cast into the
treasury of the Temple, and ought to be accepted courteously, not for its own
weight, but for the cheerfulness and good intention wherewith it is offered,
without which the rich Hecatomb is not of so much value, as the poor man's
Turtle-dove or his handful of flower.

If I agree with them in any thing, as I cannot imagine but I shall do in all,
so as notwithstanding the conceptions which are uttered may be materially
different from one another, yet they will all bear their part in the harmonious
consort of our common design, which is to persuade to communion and to peace;
this ought in reason to be looked upon, since we have not at any time compared
notes together, nor have ever had any private conference at Sevill or
Valadolid, or any other place, to be not so much the voice of prejudice as of
nature, which is every where uniform and like her self, and being attentively
and heedfully consulted will be sure to pronounce the same sentence, where the
cases themselves are not different from one another.

But though all other considerations and motives should desert me, when I
pretend to give a reason of publishing these papers, yet this I am sure will
not, that if by the usefulness of my performance I cannot do an immediate
service to the cause it self, yet that cannot possibly suffer any disparagement
from so obscure a Champion for it, and I shall at least do a collateral
service by giving an advantage to others upon the comparison; and therefore I
beg of Your Lordship, if I am not so happy to make a succesfull attaque upon
the enemies of our Church, who hold out obstinately notwithstanding all their
arguments are answered, their trenches filled up, and their bastions beat about
their ears, yet that at least I may be suffered to be a foil to its friends,
and to appear in the company of those for whom I have so great an honor and
esteem, Velut Hedera serpens inter victrices lauros.


But that which was the chief inducement to me to come abroad at this time, or
rather a provocation which I could not resist was, that to frustrate the design
of my competition, when I appeared a candidate for the Salters favor, the
memory of this Sermon was by mine enemies made use of as an objection against
me; and though this stratageme was far from having that malevolent influence
upon the success of my affairs which was intended, it appearing after all, that
I had a very powerful interest in that Loyal body, yet I had reason to take it
very ill, that that which was an instance of my Loyalty and affection to the
government and the Religion established, and therefore ought in justice to have
been an argument in my behalf, should be made an article of impeachment against
me: And for that reason I was resolved to publish what I had written, partly to
vindicate my self, and partly that being challenged at so bold a rate with that
which was my duty, and was indeed mine honor, as if it had been an
unpardonable fault, not to publish it at such a critical juncture, might be
interpreted a disowning of what I had done, which I abhor to think of, and have
taken this course to purge and vindicate my self in the best manner I can, as
well from the suspicion of so detestable a baseness, as from the guilt and
blackness of the crime it self.

And as I was firmly bent upon this honest resolution, those words of our
Savior came into my mind, which he spoke to his Disciples in his Sermon on the
mount, and which have a particular reference to the Clergy in all ages, Ye are
the salt of the earth, but if the salt have lost its savor wherewith shall it
be salted? I considered that salt by naturallists was looked upon as the great
principle of fixation and rest, that by the ancients it was accounted a symbol
of friendship, and a token of peace; and upon such accounts as these, thought I
within my self, it cannot be that the Salters who are a Loyal body, firm to the
King and the Religion established, who are desirous to promote that peace and
good correspondence among men which is the very life of trade, and the greatest
blessing of life, and by consequence are zealous for that uniformity of divine
worship, without which experience tells us there is no peace to be had; it
cannot be that they who are thus disposed should be displeased with me for
being like themselves, so that instead of losing any thing of my interest among
them, I did rather promise my self abundance of advantage from the honesty of
this action; which if it be not otherwise rewarded, will sit down contented in
the enjoyment of it self, and will abundantly make up with inward satisfaction
whatever it wants of any outward reward.

If the salt have lost its savor, in the original it is, if we may call the
Greek the original of St. Matthew, (...), which Your Lordship knows to be a
Latinism, as there are many such in the New Testament, si sal infatuetur, for
this is the meaning of fatuus in Latin, it signifies a palled and phlegmy
substance that has no taste nor relish, no savor, life or spirit in it, it is
a floating sediment and a liquid Caput mortuum, and therefore it is very fitly
applied in the metaphorical way to insignificant and useless persons, the men
of latitude and moderation, that have not the courage nor the honesty to
declare themselves, but live in a Commonwealth with the same listless and
unconcerned indifference, as if they were not members of it, which if it have
any effect at all, it must needs be a very bad one, by keeping the disagreeing
parties at a bay, by casting a tacit and supposed reflection upon such as dare
stand up in defense of the Government and the Laws, as if they were not so
good, or at least not so wise as they should be, and by giving at the same time
a secret encouragement to the disaffected interest and party, as if their cause
were such that all the moderate and sober sort would side with them if they
durst, but dare not in Conscience take part with the Laws against them. And yet
after all, this is fatuum in both senses, it is not only insipid, but it is
foolish too, and certainly for any man to sit still with his arms folded, and
his eyes dropping into a forgetful slumber, pretending neither to see nor feel
any thing about him, when his own interest, which is involved in that of the
public, lies at stake, and when by declaring for his Country against a
Faction, he may ensure himself and get a great deal of deserved honor and
reputation into the bargain, is at once a most prodigious wickedness and a most
despicable folly together; for though they do a present service to the Faction
by it, yet it is true with them as it is with us, he that is not with us is
against us, and so it will be seen if ever they get the day, that the
indifferent standers by shall fare no better than he that made a stout and
resolute resistance, only there will indeed be this difference between them,
that though the estates of the one and of the other are an equally tempting and
inviting biat to the insatiable avarice of successful treason, yet the
courage, constancy and integrity of the one will even by the greatest
adversaries themselves be remembered with honor, and spoken of with signs of
inward veneration, when the pusillanimity and faintness of the other who can be
friends to no body but themselves, shall bring an unavoidable contempt upon
their persons, and make them reflect upon themselves with shame, as well as be
slighted and disesteem'd by others.

But of all men in the world a Clergyman that is of so cold a composition is
certainly the least excusable, because he is under the greatest obligation to
confess God and his truth openly before men, he is not to gratify any party by
a tame compliance to the prejudice of the public, nor to purchase his own
peace with the loss of that of the Church, which can only be maintained by
wholesome discipline and an established order, and therefore of such an one it is
still more true what follows immediately of the unsavory salt, that he is the
most contemptible, and (whatever high opinion he may have of his own wisdom
and prudence) the most really despicable creature in the world, he is
thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out with disgrace, and to be
trodden under foot of men. And therefore whatever becomes of my pretensions,
concerning which I am not immoderately solicitous, but refer my self wholly to
the wise disposal and goodness of almighty God, I shall be very glad if those
Gentlemen in whom the Title shall appear to be, shall pitch upon one that is at
least no M -- tonian, that is, no Deserter, for it would be very incongruous in
those of this fraternity especially, to choose an insipid Priest, when God
himself would not accept of a Sacrifice that was not salted. And let the result
of that assair be as it will, yet I shall always be very proud, as I am very
thankful for it, of the great favor and kindness Your Lordship has been
pleased to do me, by appointing me to officiate at that Parish during the
sequestration of the living, and allowing me so fair a competence out of the
profits of it.

May it please Your Lordship,
I am not insensible how much I trespass upon your great affairs by so prolix
an address, but yet I am humbly of opinion, that I have said nothing which the
necessity of this occasion, and of my circumstances did not almost
indispensably oblige me to do; and now having given Your Lordship an account
of my self, as Cato was used to say Etiam otii rationem reddendam esse, and to
whom am I more accountable than to Your Lordship my Diocesan, a Person to whom
I am so very much obliged, and one that has the most undoubted right to exact
an account of me? having acquainted Your Lordship, as faithfully as I can with
the true reasons that moved me to defer the edition of this busy trifle that
has made so great a noise, so long, as well as to defer it no longer, but to
publish it at this juncture of time there are two things still remaining for
which I do humbly beg a little more of Your Lordship's patience, while I insist
with all imaginable brevity upon them; the one concerns chiefly an objection
which the friends of the present establishment may raise, and the other is an
exception which I know for certain its enemies will make.

The friends of the Church perhaps will object against me, that my discourse
being chiefly levelled as it is all along against the Independency, whose name
is Legion, being a thousand different Heresies and Sects under one title and
denomination, this may be interpreted as a supposed allowance of the
Presbyterian model; but as for that I think I have already satisfied the world
what my opinion is, at the latter end of my discourse concerning the Laws of
Nature, and if I were to give a definition, or rather a description of
Presbytery, it should be this, that it is a device of ambitious and unruly
Presbyters broken loose from the government of their Bishop, and which though
it be not indepency it self, yet it is certainly the mother of it, for the same
restless and unquiet humor which could not submit it self to the Episcopal
constitution, will incline them in their Synods and Ecclesiastical assemblies
to contend for superiority over one another; for where all are equal, and there
is no tie of obedience from the one to the other, nor any common visitour or
inspectour endued with a power of discipline over them all, there it is natural
for men that have passions and designs about them to squabble, there it will
unavoidably come to pass that many will take it ill if they be not chiefly
regarded, and if their opinion or determination be not the law and rule of the
assembly, every man will be forward to speak, and desirous to govern, but loath
to hear and unwilling to obey: The consequence of which will be that it will
occasion parties and factions, while some take part with one and some with
another, and this cuts the reins of discipline in sunder, and does as naturally
terminate in Schism and Separation, as the day is concluded by the night, or as
fair and foul weather succeed one another; besides that when men have once
tasted the forbidden fruit of disobedience, which it is so natural for all
mankind to hanker after, they seldom or never end where they begin, but go on
farther and farther in pernicious attempts upon the good order and government
of the world, till they have brought all things into absolute confusion.

A subordination and dependence of one part upon another, is as necessary in
one sort of government as another, for though the Ecclesiastical and civil
Society be in some sense distinct from one another, yet in a Christian
Commonwealth they consist both of them of the same persons, and the nature of a
society is in both cases the same; wherefore because the State and the Church,
the body politic and the body ecclesiastic, are both of them made up of the
same members, because every man has both a civil and an ecclesiastical
capacity, it is impossible there should be any disorder in the Church which
will not sensibly affect the state; and the division of a Commonwealth or
Kingdom into infinite sects and parties is a dissolution of the civil body as
well as of the sacred, and every thing that has a tendency to such a
dissolution is in its proportion pernicious and consequently unlawful.

So that if there were nothing more in the Episcopal government, than what St.
Jerome, the great, but very much mistaken patron of the Presbytery has
allowed, namely that the ancient government of the Church, was by a parity of
Presbyters (though no body knows when or where, nor is it possible to assign
any age or place when and where it was not governed by Bishops) but that in
process of time this parity proving inconvenient, by being the occasion of
Schism and contention in the Church, then in toto orb decretum est, ut unus de
Presbyteris electus superponeretur caeteris, ad quem omnis Ecclesiae cura
pertineret, I say, if there were nothing more but this in the business, yet
this is sufficient to assert the necessity, and by consequence the jus divinum
of Episcopal Superiority in the Church of God; for the nature of things is
owing to the author of nature, and that which is best fitted to preserve the
World must needs be most agreeable to him that made it: and this is so true
that let this sort of Government be never so ancient, as I shall prove to Your
Lordship and the World that it was certainly the government of the Jewish
Church, and the government to which Christ and his Apostles did themselves
submit, yet its antiquity would be, as old things usually are, too weak and
infirm to be able to defend it, did not its usefulness and manifest expedience
to the good of society and of humane life, give it a perpetual youth and
vigor, by which it is rendered strong in its own defense, and will be too hard
for its enemies to the end of the world; otherwise if any man can show me
fairly that either the Presbytery or the Independency are more exactly
calculated for the quiet of the world, notwithstanding that the experience of
our late times, added to the reason of the thing, and the opinion of Saint
Jerome which was founded upon it, do seem at present to demonstrate the
contrary, I must beg Your Lordship's pardon if I withdraw my Canonical
obedience, for I must and will be either Presbyterian or Independent as the
nature of things would have me.

I speak it with all imaginable deference and profound submission to Your
Lordship's exact judgment, and that of my Superiors, I have considered of this
matter with all the care and attention I am able, and I am certain, if I can be
certain of any thing, that I have discovered the Philosopher's Stone, the true
Elixir of Government and of humane life, which it must be our own fault in
rejecting so great a blessing or by our disobedience not answering the design
of it, if it do not turn all things it touches into Gold, and make the whole
earth as happy as the Paradise of God.

The true state of the question is in short this, the end of government is
obedience and peace, and therefore all sorts of government, upon supposition
that they are equally fitted for the bringing of this end to pass, would have
an equal Jus divinum, an equal Jus natural, an equal right of obtaining and
continuing as they are in the several places and territories where they are in
use; because in this case nothing could make a disturbance but an alteration,
and therefore it would be with governments as it is with proprietours in the
state of nature, antecedently to any bargain or compact, the undoubted right
would be primi occupantis, because to deprive him of his possession, who was
already seized of it, might occasion an embroilment, might be the cause of
bloodshed and of war, but if every man would let his neighbor alone then all
the world would be happy, and upon supposition that every man would be quiet
and peaceable without it, that men could be so friendly, so happy and so secure
without government as with it, there would be no need of government at all; but
since man is by nature an ambitious, a necessitous, and consequently a
disobedient, turbulent and encroaching creature, since he wants many things,
and expects more than he wants, for this reason that form of government is
certainly the best which is the best fitted to command and force obedience: and
this I affirm from the nature of things, for men do not willingly obey their
equals, much less their inferiors, this I affirm from the consent of mankind
and the experience of all ages to be the Episcopal Government, or the
Subordinate Polity both in Church and State; and if any man will undertake to
prove the contrary, and will be as good as his word, then. I shall be for
levelling as well as he, but till I see this substantially proved, which I have
a strong fancy I shall never do, so long as humane faculties or humane passions
continue as they are, I desire to continue in my old post, and be content to
move, though in the lowest sphere of this subordinate and comely frame, rather
than by the perpetual jarring of equal powers and motions against each other,
to go stooping like a Goose under a barn door, and be in perpetual fear, ne
fractus illabatur orbis.

It was either the experienced or the foreseen mischiefs of equality and
independence that first introduced order and good government into the world,
and it is the natural desire of power in man, who is a needy, restless and
ambitious creature, that endeavors to break this order and dependence for
reasons of its own, without considering the interest of the public; lastly it
is the unspeakable confusion, mischief and calamity with which the breach of
this order is attended, that usually makes all parties (weary of those miseries
which by strife and disobedience they have brought upon themselves) return
again into some orderly establishment that may defend and shield them from the
same calamities in the time to come; but there is no safety, no security, no
quiet enjoyment of a man's self, his friend or his possession to be had but
under the shade and protection of such a subordinate state of things, in which
the very life and being of society consists.

The other exception, which I am infallibly certain will be made against me by
the dissenting party is this, that in the management of the subject I have
undertaken, I have discovered too much violence and heat of temper, and this
accusation will consist of two parts, the first will concern my style and way
of expression, the other that I have so openly and so zealously declared for a
vigorous execution of the penal statutes upon the dissenting parties.

With Your Lordship's good leave I will speak a little to each of these
particulars.

And as to the first of them, I might here conjure up the Ghost of an old
story, that has been so often disturbed by men that first pillage antiquity
for a smart repartie, and then steal, as it were, by consent from one another,
of Croesus and his son, the dumb Prince of Lydia, whose dutiful apprehension
of his Father's danger, broke through the obstacles and impediments of nature,
and taught him to speak as plain at half a minutes warning, as if the most
ingenious and learned Dr. H. had had him in tuition for seven years together,
and there is a scrap of Virgil too, if the often use of it had not made it so
cheap, that it will hardly pass so much as in capping of verses, where any
thing goes as far as from Ennius or Lucilius to Qui mihi, which would have done
me admirable service and that is

-- Quis talia fando
Myrmidonum, Dolopum ve aut duri Miles Ulyssi
Temperet a Lachrymis --
But these two being both of them prostitute citations which deny no author
that has occasion for them, I shall be content to say in homely, downright
English, without the advantage of historical embellishments, or Poetical
flowers, that it was impossible for me to be concerned as I am for the peace of
the Church, and the happiness of mankind, without expressing an hearty
indignation that we must be made miserable for the sake of trifles, and by the
bold artifices of conventicling varlets, that are as ignorant as they are
disloyal, fellows that pretend to I know not what influences of the Spirit,
only for that reason because they are unskilful in Letters, men that are so
far from being qualified to instruct the people, that they understand not
common sense themselves, and are the most contemptible idiots under the cope of
Heaven.

I appeal to Your Lordship, and to all manking, whether this be not sufficient
to justify a passion, and whither it be not a man's duty to express himself
after the example of our Savior with the same severity and deserved sharpness
with which he treated the Scribes and Pharisees and Hypocrites of his time,
nay, it is still more our duty to imitate that example, because there is
greater cause and matter of indignation; for the Pharisees, though they were
indeed Hypocrites and deceivers, and as Josephus assures us, a pragmatical
Sect, and very great medlers with affairs of State, yet they were many of them
admirable scholars, and men of great understanding, and though they may be
justly upbraided with want of honesty, yet with want of learning they could
not, they had that in abundance, and that was one reason that made them despise
the Gospel at that rate that they did, as being preached by the Carpenter's
Son, and by a few poor Fishermen and illiterate people.

But we are fallen into the hands of Fools as well as Knaves, men that have
neither honesty, nor sense, nor learning, that preach as with the same lowdness
that the Thunder does, or the Cataracts of Nile, which is music only for
Crocodiles and monsters, so with no better eloquence, or more intelligible
meaning, and they encourage and animate one another, like Mariners weighing
anchor, they set their shoulders to the government and muster all the strength
and all the noise they can make, and resolve with themselves to unhinge the
Kingdom, and overturn the world by importunity and clamor.

Wherefore let any expression be never so severe, yet I desire no allowance to
be made me, only let men consider whether what I say be true or no; for upon
supposition that I speak no more than the truth, the things are of that
consequence, that wonderful, and yet that manifest and plain importance, that
there can be no severity too much, no zeal too fierce, nor any Steliteutick or
Satry too invective.

David in his time said it of himself that, That zeal of God's house had eaten
him up, but we have lived to see the Phrase inverted, and seem to have eaten up
the zeal of God's house; and if there be any thing that can excuse those bitter
imprecations which David showrs in such plenty upon his enemies, which cannot
well be done by any thing but by saying, that they were enemies to God and to
Religion as well as to him, then certainly we shall still be more excusable, or
rather it will be highly commendable and praiseworthy in us if, without the
curses of David, we only give a due character of the seducers of our times,
the disturbers of our peace, and the most dangerous enemies of manking; that
the people may avoid them, and leave them, as they do very well deserve, to be
a curse and calamity to themselves.

Let any man judge, if a concern for any thing be in any case excusable,
whether it be fit to talk of matters of this nature and importance with the
same indifference as if he were demonstrating a dry proposition in Euclid, or
making out a crabbed problem in Apollonius Pergeus, being very well satisfied,
nay, and perhaps overjoyed as Archimedes was when he leaped out of the Bath,
and Pythagoras when he offered an Hecatomb for a discovery, that he has found
the truth himself; and so sleeps quietly with an opinion of his skill, and with
the satisfaction of a sober, mathematical assurance, but is not at all
concerned whether any body else either know or believe as he does, and whether
they do or no, yet the discovery may be such, however difficult and intricate
in it self, that it may be of little or no consequence to humane life.

Nay, I am so far from repenting the severity of any expression I have used,
that though it should happen to me as it did to him in Horace, Populus me
sibilat, the Mobile are displeased and angry at me, yet notwithstanding I would
go on as he did, at mihi plaudo Ipse domi, and I shall be glad, when it seems
good to fate, to walk along with him to the end of the verse, and tacita nummos
contemplor in Arca. But if any of that party shall pretend to take up the
Quarterstaff against me, though he will do well to follow my example, and take
the advice of Horace along with him,

Sumite materiam vestris qui scribitis aequam
Viribus, and versate diu, quid far recusent
Quid valiant humeri --
yet if he behave himself with civility toward me, I will either not answer
him at all, or I will do it with respect according as his performance is; but
if he have a mind to show his angry parts, I will set him such a copy of Satyr,
as neither he nor any of his party shall be able to follow, and I will let him
see that I can do what Isaac Vossius once threatened in a case of small moment
in comparison of this, Vtimur nunc leni flabello, usuri etiam flagro si porro
molesti esse pergant, I will show him that I have Scorpions as well as Whips,
and that without translating Ovid against Ibis, I shall find matter enough at
home to make him ashamed of himself and his performance; and without putting my
self to the drudgery of imprecation, a thing very inconsistent with the
goodness of my nature, which enclines me very strongly to wish well to all
mankind, all I shall do is to turn him upon himself, if he dare own his name,
otherwise I have neither the patience to beat the air to no purpose, nor the
courage and hardiness to fight with Goblins, that vanish out of sight, and
assault a man behind and before and on all sides at once, without any
possibility of being hit themselves: but let him own himself as an author
ought to do, and let him write so as to deserve an answer, and then let us have
a clear stage and fair play, and from him no favor; or if instead of Satyr he
have a mind to be more innocently wity, let him but mix a little seriousness
with his wit, and let that seriousness be such as is not dull, and then I
promise him (like Hippocrates his twins, a very old comparison, but it will be
older before it is quite out of date) we will be wonderful friends in the
midst of the fray, and we will laugh and cry together, and I will follow him
with a complement at the same time when I make a pass at the very heart of his
cause, as the Retiarii in the Roman Theaters were used to do by their
Antagonists, the Mirmillones, who had a fish graven or painted upon their
shield:

Piscem peto,
Non te peto,
Quid me fugis, Galle?
But I had much rather that they, whoever they are that shall think it for
their own credit, for otherwise I am sure they will hardly do it for the
interest of their cause, to concern themselves with such an unfledged author,
whom they may catch with chaff, as well as bird-lime, as they please
themselves, I say, I had much rather that they would betake themselves to a
serious and close way of writing, which notwithstanding all the sharpness of
the following discourse, which to be sure will be represented much greater than
it is, I have very carefully observed in it; neither is there any thing which I
should more hate in my self, or more despise in another, than for a man to lose
his argument in an impertinent wilderness either of wit or anger.

Therefore if any of that party be dissatisfied, or has a mind to pretend that
he is so, with what I have said already upon the three following questions, in
which all the matters in difference are contained.

First, Concerning Episcopal Government.

Secondly, Concerning humane impositions, in religious matters in the general,
and

Thirdly, Concerning the particular impositions that are the occasion, or
pretense, of Separation from the Church of England.

Let him then enter the lists as soon as he pleases, and I promise Your
Lordship I will not fail to answer him in defense of the established Religion,
and for the quieting the minds of his Majesty's good subjects against either
the tricks or the mistakes of inconsiderate or designing men; not that I
pretend to be able to say much more upon these subjects than I have done
already, but some men will not be convinced by any thing at the first hearing,
let it be never so plain, but they must have it over and over in other words
and in a new appearance, till by degrees the truth is rendered so familiar to
them as to subdue the prejudices they have imbibed against it, or the mistake
so palpable, that obstinacy begins to blush and be ashamed.

And the better to prevent all artifice and cant, which do but perplex the
cause and make all controversies endless, and cheat the world of their money
and their time, to prevent all squabbling about authorities, which is an
incompetent way of arguing in this case, because men that are not able to
search into these things themselves will be sure to believe the quotations of
their own side, whether true of false, or whether they be rightly applied or
not. For this reason I propose that we lay all arguments but those of nature
aside.

For if it be found upon principles that are universally acknowledged, and such
as make their appeal to every common understanding, that Episcopacy, that is, a
superiority on the one hand, and a dependence on the other, is the most perfect
form of Government both in Church and State, or indeed that there can be no
lasting government without it; that in the Church it secures the greatest
reverence to the Clergy, by which they are the better enabled to influence the
people, and by consequence to answer the end of their institution and
separation to the ministerial office; if it give the greatest encouragement to
learning, if it strengthen the hands of discipline, as well with respect to the
inferior Clergy as the Layety, and if this be a natural means to secure the
public peace, then here is all that can be expected to justify this form of
government in the Church: and though the testimonies of antiquity may receive
strength and advantage from the nature of things, which is the only true
immutable antiquity to which we must appeal, yet those very testimonies, let
them be never so numerous, unanimous and positive, when they have nature
against them, what are they but so many confessions of ignorance or design? of
want of honesty, or want of skill?

So also in the second enquiry, if it shall be found that humane impositions in
religious matters are of absolute and indispensable necessity for the keeping
any ecclesiastical society together, for the preservation of peace and unity
among men; if it follow plainly from the consideration of humane nature and
humane passions, as well as from the experience of our own and former times,
that without such impositions we must crumble into sects as numerous as the
motes that lie basking in a beam of the sun, or that lie basking in a beam of
the sun, or that infinity of crowding stars by which the Celestial Galaxy is
adorned: this is abundantly sufficient from the necessity of such humane
institutions, to justify their lawfulness, and to prove their obligation; and
it is so far from being true, that there can be no external circumstance of
religious worship appointed and ordained by men, which is not expressly revealed
and set down in some place or other of the New Testament, that if on the
contrary our Savior and his Apostles had expressly told us that we must not so
much as move an hand or a foot in any religious assembly or affair without
express license and authority from them, which they have no where done, and yet
at the same time had not adjusted the particular instances of our behavior in
these matters, which they have not done neither, all the inference that could
have been made from this would be, that we must not worship God at all, which
is a very odd sort of divine revelatition.

Besides that, nothing can be more foolish than to persuade to charity, to talk
perpetually of peace and love and such like luscious and delicious things,
only to make our mouths water, while at the same time we are denied the
necessary means of securing so desirable blessings to our selves.

It would be true at this rate not only in the event but in the design too,
that our Savior came not to bring peace but a sword, and the end of his
coming, if he had any at all, being only to set the world together by the
ears, as it must be if he deny the civil or ecclesiastical magistrate a power
of determining those indifferent matters, which he has not any where
determined himself; this would be a plain argument that he was a gross
impostour, instead of being, as he is, the prince of peace, and the most
powerful preacher, as well as the most perfect example of obedience.

From all which it follows unavoidably as to the third enquiry, which is
concerning the particular ceremonies or impositions that are excepted against,
that it is abundantly sufficient that there is a great deal to be said for
them, but nothing at all that can with any show of reason be objected against
them; and to except against a ceremony without giving some other reason, than
only that a man cannot comply with it, or because he is not satisfied with its
lawfulness, though he knows not why it should be unlawful neither, is an
indefinite sort of exception that extends to one ceremony as well as another,
and with as good reason may be applied to all humane impositions whatsoever:
wherefore unless the magistrate will utterly divest himself of all kind of
power and authority whatsoever, as all is included consequentially in this
power of humane institutions in religious matters, he must lay down this as an
unalterable rule and measure of proceeding never to dispense with any thing
that is enjoined, merely because his subjects are troubled with the Mulligrubs,
because they know not what they a^l, or what they would be at, or why they
would have what they complain of altered and dispensed with; for this is to
give up all into the hands of fancy, and which is still more dangerous, of
design, and it is the same thing as if a Phanatick or his wife should long for
a Crown jewel, not that they intend to make any use or advantage of it, but
only it is a pretty thing, and the good woman will miscarry if she have it
not, for it is certain if they be gratified in this request, they will long for
all the jewels one after another, and at last for the Crown and the prerogative
themselves.

I am very far (My Lord) from going about to detract from the great and worthy
performances of those who have ransacked antiquity to vindicate and defend our
church, either against the Romanists on the one hand, or the Separation on the
other; but yet it cannot be denied, that this instead of ending the
controversy has but had the unhappiness to render it more perplexed and
difficult than before, and to swell the dispute into so large a compass that it
is no more consistent with an ordinary leizure, than with an ordinary education
and capacity to consider it: however it is of absolute necessity that this be
done, that the only pretenses to antiquity may not lie on the wrong side;
notwithstanding, that after we have done our best, when the best parts and the
most accurate endeavors have been employed, men that are not Judges of these
things for themselves will rather be cheated by their own writers than
convinced by ours, and the writings of Blondel, Salmasius and Davillee, not to
say any thing of that Kidderminster stuff, which as course and as unfit for
service as it is, is the usual wear of the Schismatics of our times, will
always be in better esteem among some men, if there be no other expedient used
to convince them, than the most irrefragable and unanswerable demonstrations of
the episcopal Divines, who are either more able or more honest, or both of
them, than they.

And though when antiquity does but confirm the true notion of things, or
rather is it self strengthened and confirmed by them, it be in a manner
needless, yet when either the ancients themselves are on the wrong side of
nature, or are misapplied through ignorance, inadvertency or design to serve a
turn, there is nothing so odious, so distasteful to the palate, and so
disagreeable to the stomach of a wise man, as to see a page groan under a heap
of quotations, and a margent as full fraught with testimonies to no purpose, or
to a very bad one, as an Orange stuck with Cloves, or a Pheasant larded with
Bacon.

But where time and reason are both of them of a mind, there indeed is it a
double satisfaction to us to see that our ancestors before us were wise men,
and that we tread in their steps, but the true reason why we ought to follow
their example, is not perfectly because they gave it, and for nothing else, for
then we may follow bad examples, as well as good ones; but because their
practice and ours is alike founded in the reason of things, and the interest of
mankind, because nature is unchangeable and always the same, and because
experience cannot deceive us, though antiquity may.

I have therefore chosen, because I am satisfied the venture is very safe, to
put the stress of the whole controversy between the separatists and us upon
this issue, that we may stand or fall as nature shall determine, and that we
may proceed upon such principles as every man may judge and feel for himself
whether they be true or no.

If it be better for us to let loose the reins of Government, without reason
and without end, as fast as any man that has a brazen face, or a weak
understanding, or a sinister design, shall come and say, My Conscience is
tender, and it is but fit that Conscience should be heard (whether she can
speak any thing for her self or no,) then let us let them loose, to make an
experiment what the event will be, if former experiments will not resolve the
case; but if it be better to keep up an uniform and strict discipline, if the
interest of all be to be preferred before the humors of a few, and those of
the meanest of the people, both for their quality and understanding; if all the
fault of episcopal government and of humane institutions is, that they are not
submitted to or obeyed as they should be; if this be a fault, not of the
government or of the institutions themselves, but, of those that boggle at them
and quarrel with them for no reason, and if the same humor and itch of
disobedience may be as good an argument against any government in the world,
and against all institutions whatsoever; if the Episcopacy be the best fitted
to secure obedience, and to keep up discipline, to preserve peace and to reward
merit, to make us happy and wise into the bargain, Then it is but fit and
necessary that we continue as we are, and that without regarding peevish and
unwarrantable scruples which can have no good influence, and will admit of no
bounds or limits to restrain them, we encourage one another to stand to our old
post, and say to each other, remembering the signaculum Crucis which we have
received in token of our being soldiers under the sacred banner of the Cross,
as the Centurion said to his Ensign in Livy, when the senate was deliberating
whether or no they should remove to Veii, Sta signifer, statue signum hic
manebimus optime.

And this way of procedure I am the more satisfied with, because it gives me a
new assurance of the universal influence and undoubted truth of those
principles which I have formerly laid down to be the square and measure of
obligation, and which being applied to any particular case, will in every thing
resolve what is true or false. Before and melius Chrysippo and Crantore,


Principles that will obtain to the confusion of Popery, enthusiasm and every
evil work, when the envy of this age is under ground, and when the heads of
two or three Metaphysical Opiniatours are cold, whatever they may do at
present, of which I am not solicitous, but am content to take men and things as
I find them, with as little disturbance and trouble as I can to my self. Et
mihi res, non me rebus submittere conor.


And as I have intimated already, nature and experience cannot deceive us,
though antiquity may, it does not follow because such a polity or such a form
of Government was in use among the ancients whether in church or state, that
therefore the example of antiquity lays any manner of obligation upon us which
is extrinsique to the reason of the thing, but as Livy says of History in
general, hoc illud est praecipue in cognitione rerum salubre ac frugiferum,
omnis te exempli documenta in illustri posita monumento intueri: inde tibi
tuaeque Reip. quod imitere, capias, inde foedum inceptu, foedum exitu, quod
vites, I say, what he says of History in general, the same is true of
ecclesiastical history in particular, and though it does not follow that the
Episcopal government is therefore of necessity the best, because antiquity
submitted to it, who possibly in this as well as many other things may very
well be mistaken, for the ancients were but men no more than we, yet when the
history of all the several ages of the Church, shall not only recommend this
government to us by its perpetual and uninterrupted example, but shall also
inform us over and above how useful and expedient this government has always
been to the preservation of the peace and unity of the Church, and how fatal
the disobedience of Presbyters to their Bishop has been found, by being the
occasion of great calamities and disorders in it, as well of old time, as now
of late in the experience of our own age and nation; in this case antiquity
backed by experience gives us all the assurance which it is possible for us to
receive in a matter of this nature, that the Episcopal constitution as being
found by experience to be the most wholesome for the preservation of the
Churches health, and for the preventing all those maladies and diseases to
which the body Ecclesiastic would otherwise be exposed, is therefore
unquestionably the best that can be thought of, and has besides a right of
immemorial prescription, the advantage of long experience, which in matters of
this nature, is the most powerful reason, to recommend it to us.

It is with government in the body politic, as it is with medicines in the
natural, the end of medicine is health, and the end of government is obedience
and peace; and therefore though it does not follow because Hippocrates or Galen
in a case proposed made such or such a recipe, consisting of such ingredients,
and compounded in such proportions together, that therefore the Physicians of
our times whenever the same case occurs must of necessity prescribe after the
same manner, for we must examine not only into the prescription it self, but
also into the success of it with respect to the patient, we must compare
patient and patient, and then patient and prescription together, we must allow
for the difference of climate, constitution and diet betwixt one patient and
another, and if when all these things have been considered, such a course of
physic, or such a method of cure in such a case proposed shall be found to
have been successful in the time of those old Physicians and ever since, here
is an Empirical demonstration which cannot easily deceive us, what we are to
do at this time of the day, and in this case antiquity joined to success is a
very powerful argument in behalf of the prescription or the method given, and
look how much greater the antiquity is, and how much more frequent the cases
that have occurred, and the good success that has all along attended them have
been, so much the stronger is the argument which is drawn from antiquity in
their behalf, not so much for the sake of the antiquity it self, as for the
success and good fortune of the course that has been taken.

Wherefore the end of physic being health as the end of government is good
order and obedience, and the fitness of means being to be measured by their
suitableness to that end to which they are directed, it is manifest that
experience must determine the controversy in both cases, and as that physic,
or that diet or that air, is certainly the best, which has the most wholesome
and salutary effects, upon the natural body, so is that sort of establishment
or polity whether in Church or State undoubtedly the best, which has always
been found to be most productive of peace, most powerfully influential upon
obedience and good order, and the best fitted to prevent the inconveniences
with which the want or absence of government would be attended.

Therefore the question is this, what sort of government is that which is most
for the Churches health, and peace, and safety? is it a coordinate
administration, or will it be better, for the obtaining of these ends, that its
government, as it is in the body natural and in all other political bodies
whatsoever, do not consist of parts that are all of them of equal dignity or
power, but that one part be dependent upon another, and that the whole be knit
together by a steady and regular subordination?

Let us put the case in an army, can that army be well governed all whose
officers have equal power and dignity with one another? or did not the rebels
themselves in the late unhappy times, when they raised an army, and levied an
unnatural war against their king, did not they make this difference in the
commissions which they gave, that some were to be Generals, others Major and
Lieutenant Generals, others commanders of Tertia's or Brigades, Colonels of
Regiments, and so down to Captains, Lieutenants and Ensigns? now either this
depended upon the nature of government in the general, or it did not; if it
did, as what is an army but an armed commonwealth or city submitting to certain
rules of discipline and obedience within themselves? then the nature of
government is in both cases the same, and consequently a subordination in the
church militant is every whit as necessary for the preservation of its unity
and peace, as it was in the schism either militant or triumphant. But if it do
not depend upon the nature of government and society considered in the general,
then there is no reason why an army may not be managed by a parity of officers,
which if it could once be effected it would save a great deal of that
unnecessary expense, which is now thrown away, as it should seem, to no purpose
upon the great field-officers and the commanders in chief whether of whole
Regiments or greater parties.

To carry this comparison a little farther, because the power of the Presbyters
in our times is pretended to be swallowed up in that of the Bishop, like the
rods of the Magicians by the rod of Moses, contrary, as it seems, to the
practice of the primitive times, we may observe that in the affairs of a
private company, it is but reasonable that the captain should advise with the
rest of the commission-officers, and not manage all things wholly by himself,
but yet the power of summoning and dissolving the assembly is still entirely in
him, and he has a negative at least, entirely to himself, so that without his
consent and concurrence nothing can be done, as to all those things that are
within the cognizance and sphere of his authority, but if the commander in
chief of the whole regiment were to consult with his officers for their common
interest and safety, it is most likely that he would advise only with the
captains of the respective companies, and in a great council of war, where so
great a multitude would breed confusion, there the private captains are not
regarded neither, but only the ^hief officers and principal commanders of the
greater parties, in all which assemblies, for discipline and good order sake,
the general must be supposed to have his negative, and as the assembly is
called by his authority, so to have a power likewise of dissolving it as he
pleases.

And this has always been the custom in the Ecclesiastical model, a Bishop in
the ancient practice of the Church was used almost in all matters to advise and
deliberate concerning the affairs of his diocese with his Presbyters about him,
and from thence it came to pass that the whole assembly or the place where they
met, is sometimes by the ancientest of the Greek fathers termed, (...), the
Bishop being indeed, if, without using words which we do not understand we will
frame to our selves an intelligible notion of the thing it self, only the
chief or superintendent of the Presbyters having an inspection over them and
over the whole diocese, as they had over their particular charges, but still
the Bishop had his negative and consequently almost the whole power of
administration in his own hands; for otherwise than this I can by no means
understand the language of St. Jerome, who though in this he be so widely
mistaken that he will not have this government to have been ordained in the
church by Christ himself, yet he confesses that it was as old as the
contentions between Paul and Apollos and Cephas, and that it was made use of as
an expedient to restore the churches peace, which I think to be a very apt
translation of those words, ut schismatum semina tollerentur, but now what
peace there could be, or how this was a possible expedient of procuring it,
where the Bishop had not a negative voice in the assembly, I confess I do not
understand.

Again as no laws could be made without the episcopal Le veult, and on the
contrary all proceedings were stopped in every particular diocesan assembly by
the negative saviseroit of the Bishop, so as to those canons and constitutions
that were enacted, the Bishop was the person who was chiefly concerned to look
after their performance and to punish their neglect; and as no ecclesiastical
sanction could be made without him, so the executive power was in a manner
entirely his, he was to see that every pastor did his duty, he was to censure
and punish the delinquents against it, and in a controversy arising whether
this or that particular pastor had broken his canonical obedience or no, or
done any thing which was disagreeable to his function or his obligation, the
last diocesan appeal was to the Bishop, and without granting him as much power
as this comes to, it is utterly impossible to make sense of the words of St
Jerome, in toto orb decretum est, ut unus de presbyteris electus
superponeretur caeteris ad quem omnis Ecclesiae cura pertineret, ut schismatum
semina tollerentur; for how the bishop could be said in every diocese to be set
over the Presbyters, how the care of the whole church or diocese could be said
to be committed to him, and that for this end, to preserve the peace of the
church, or how that peace could be preserved without all this power which I
have allotted to him, fateor me scire juxta cum ignarissimis, and if there be
any man else that can explain it to me, let him pass from hence forward for the
Delian Diver or for the Delphick Apollo.

But though in this or that particular diocese the power of the Presbyters
seems to have been somewhat greater than it is nowadays, and yet, as I have
proved, it was not so considerable neither, yet as the Bishop did advise with
his Presbyters as to the affairs of his own diocese, and perhaps did scarce do
any thing of moment without their concurrence and direction in it, so in the
Provincial Synods which were convened together for the more regular and uniform
administration of several such diocesses together, both as to matters of
discipline and belief and much more in the general councils or ecumenical
dyets of the whole Christian Church, the whole affair was transacted by the
Bishops, and yet the canons and constitutions that were then agreed upon were
obligatory to all the Presbyters within the jurisdiction of those Bishops of
which the assembly consisted, and these constitutions did without question
determine the most important cases, they applied a remedy to all the greater
evils of the church, and laid down all the most general and most concerning
rules of discipline and obedience, so that the conferences of the respective
Bishops with their particular clergy, so far as any thing new was established
or enacted by them were only about particular cases which could not be
sufficiently foreseen or provided for by the larger assemblies, and for the
most part about matters of lesser moment.

But the Presbyters, as small a share as they had in the government of the
church, for it appears upon more accounts than one to have been but very small,
yet being used upon so frequent occasions to advise with their Bishop, and the
Bishop not being used to determine any new matter or issue out any new order
without their consent, this was in process of time, an occasion of the
Presbyters aspiring after more power, of their confronting and opposing their
Bishop, and taking upon them more than became them or than was for the peace of
the Church, which seems to have given occasion in part to Clemens his epistle
to the Corinthians, and to Ignatius his so frequent and so passionate
exhortations to the Presbyters to pay that duty and obedience which they owed
to their Bishop, as the messenger of God and the vicegerent of Christ in that
particular diocese wherein he was placed, but when all these endeavors of good
and holy men, proved ineffectual, as all exhortation is ineffectual with the
generality of mankind, where there is not a power sufficient to force
obedience, it seemed good at last to the wisdom of the Church, to remove the
occasions of such evils for the future by enlarging the power of the Bishop,
and to curb the insolence of the Presbytery by removing its cause, which was
their meeting together with him in the diocesan convocation upon any occasional
emergence that might happen; but yet the Bishop was not by this means rendered
absolute neither, but there lay an appeal from him to the Metropolitan or
Patriarch, to a provincial or ecumenical diet, and to the standing canons and
constitutions of the church, which it was not in his power to violate or alter,
and in which all the great lines of obedience, were contained.

And this alteration in the government of the church depended upon the same
reason with the disanulling popular elections either of Bishops or particular
pastors, which being found by long and woeful experience to be the occasion of
perpetual tumult and disorder in the church, the fruitful parent of
everlasting feuds, animosities and factions to the unspeakable detriment both
of church and state, was in process of time partly disused of it self by the
peoples being weary of so troublesome a right, and partly by the interposition
of imperial rescripts, and by the authority of the civil laws of our own and
other nations.

It was very natural in the beginnings of the church to allow some what more to
the Presbyters in consultation with their Bishop, and to the people in the
choice of both, than was consistent with the policy of aftertimes because, --
Pueris dant crustula blandi
Doctores elementa velint ut discere prima.
when churches and ecclesiastical societies were first to be gathered, men were
to be allured by privileges, and to be enticed by power, a thing of which all
mankind are naturally very fond, as well as to be convinced by arguments to
espouse the cause and interest of Christianity; but when the religion of Christ
had taken deep root in the world, when the temptations of honor and
preferment, and the dangers of persecution from the Pagan powers were now
utterly removed and extinguished, and when at the same time, the world being
turned Christian, the dangers and inconveniences of popular elections increased
with the number of the electours, and the Presbytery by reason of their number
began to be formidable to the Bishop, as well as troublesome and tumultuous
among one another, which must of necessity have been the occasion of very great
calamities, and very sad as well as frequent revolutions if a timely stop were
not put, this made it necessary upon the same principle of convenience to
abrogate this power, upon which it seems first to have been introduced, if
indeed it were introduced upon any reason at all but only a gradual and
insensible encroachment in both cases, and upon the supinity in or neglect of
the governors of the church, who did not possibly foresee those horrid
inconveniences with which this way of management would afterward be attended.

For my part I am so firmly of opinion, that the great design of religion is
charity, good will and peace, that I take it to be a certain argument of an
institution or custom essentially bad when it is directly calculated for the
disturbance of the world, and whatever becomes of the antiquity of the
business, which is used to afford matter of specious discourse on both sides of
the question in several important cases and particularly in these which I have
so lately mentioned; yet if it could be proved that antiquity and interest were
fallen out with one another, it is in this case but reasonable to consider that
the longer we and our forefathers have labored under the painful and
prejudicial consequences of error, the more it would behove us to think of a
reformation, which if it be not allowed to be a good argument in behalf of
truth, the Protestant Religion will be utterly unable to defend it self; and we
should consider likewise that even in point of antiquity, nature, and the
standing interest of the world are much ancienter things than any the oldest
custom can pretend to be, and therefore if antiquity be the measure by which
we are resolved to proceed, it will follow that nature and interest must
prescribe to custom and not custom to them.

Nay, if it could be never so demonstrably proved that our Savior did by his
example or by his institution recommend to posterity the presbyterian model,
or the congregational way, though it can hardly be supposed that he who was God
as well as man, could be guilty of so great a mistake in the true art and
mystery of government, yet these being found afterward by experience to be
very inconsistent with the great end of the Gospel, which is charity and peace,
it is manifest that the means having only a relative or conditional nature,
and being to be either used or rejected in proportion to their fitness or
unsuitableness to their end, the end of the Gospel, which is peace, would have
obliged posterity to alter that institution, though of Christ himself, which
was found by experience to be inconsistent with it; or rather, since the
declared design of our Savior's coming into the world was to reconcile God to
men, and men to one another, and since the causeless feuds and animosities of
men do set them at enmity with God, as well as among themselves, since they
extinguish that calm, serene and charitable spirit, without which neither our
persons nor our sacrifices can be accepted, since it is impossible, in the
language of St. John to love God whom we have not seen, unless we can also love
our brother whom we have seen, this would have been a plain argument, when he
preached peace and yet established such a form of government as had a direct or
a comparative tendency to confusion, one of which is the case of the
Independent churches, and the other of the Presbyterian form with relation to
the more perfect and complete establishment of the Episcopal subordination; I
say, it would have been a plain argument either that he had war in his heart,
notwithstanding that his words were smoother than oil, and that though he
talked of peace, yet he designed contention, or else if he were sincere in what
he did, that he did not understand the message he came about, and in either of
those cases he must be acknowledged to be a gross impostour, when he pretended
to be sent from God, for God sends no man to disturb the world, unless it be
for our sins, as other great plagues and calamities are inflicted, but how was
he then that auspicious, merciful and benign Prince, the Prince of peace, and
the son of him that is the father of mercies, in whom all the families of the
earth were to be blessed?

And for the same reason I affirm that all the declaimers of the separation,
whose lungs are employed in blowing the coals of strife, and in dividing
friends, relations and countrymen from one another, cannot possibly pretend a
mission from heaven for what they do, unless they can first prove that the
terms of communion in the church of England are unlawful to be submitted to,
nay, that they are utterly inconsistent with salvation, but when they offer no
manner of reason for so destructive a schism, so pernicious to our peace at
home, and to our power and interest abroad, but only tell us with a splay
mouth and a ridiculous tone that they cannot in conscience, that is, they will
not comply; (for this reason is infinite, and therefore ought not to be allowed
without a more particular and satisfactory plea) that such a thing is
superstitious, they cannot tell why, and that they are for greater purity and
greater edification, that is, for infinite schism, separation and confusion;
for noise and nonsense and eternal dashing of one disagreeing party against
another, as if the breach of charity, the destruction of good order, and the
subversion of government were the true methods of edification, that is, as if
building up and pulling down were the same, or as if they that have the meanest
parts, the least acquired learning, the most confused sentiments and the most
unintelligible notions, which is plainly the case of the Nonconformists at this
day, were the best qualified for instructing the people; or as if they that
hate the government and persecute all that love it, with a virulence not to be
equaled by any but themselves, were fit to be entrusted with the doctrine of
obedience, and were to be permitted in a christian common wealth to have the
conduct and governance of souls that have a civil capacity as well as a sacred,
and are obliged for God's sake to be subject to every lawful ordiance of man,
and certainly, either nothing is lawful in this world, or else humane
impositions and Episcopal government are so, when they are found by the
experience of so many ages to be either of absolute necessity to the public
peace which is the case of the former, or at least the best fitted to establish
and secure it, which is the true pinch of the controversy, as to the latter:
Quis Coelum Terrae non misceat and mare Coelo?


Or may it not be consistent, even with the meekness of a Christian spirit to
call for fire from heaven upon such bold miscreants that pretend a commission
from it to unhinge the world, and to set all manking together by the ears,
only for the sake of two or three signisicant ceremonies, and because they are
significant, that is, because they tend to that which they plead so much for,
and talk so loudly concerning, that is, edification, for otherwise what they
signify I cannot imagine, and I entreat some of them to tell me.

And yet if these things were abated, it is not to be hoped without a severe
prosecution of the penal laws, that ever the separation will cease together
with them, which under the disguise of religion is indeed nothing else but a
Republican faction, which the enemies of monarchy will be sure to cherish so
long as they can or dare, so that it is observable though they have been driven
forty times from one station to another, and though they know not where to fix
to entrench themselves safely against the assaults of truth, though the pleas
alter almost with the seasons of the year, and with the returns of the day, yet
the separation it self continues still the same, or has rather been every day
more obstinate and inveterate than the other, till the laws began to rouse
their drowsy heads, and show that they were not merely a dead and lifeless
letter, which it is natural for a Phanatick to despise.

Nay, though there were not, as there is, in the bottom of Phanaticism, a
Republican design, yet what terms of accommodation can possibly be expected,
when there are so many whose only trade is schism, and who get the very bread
they eat by keeping up their party; whose kitchins must be cold and bellies
empty, whenever that fatal day shall overtake them, in which the Conventicles
are not full and reeking with the unnatural steams of separation.

However such is the wise temperament and constitution of the church of
England, that it has left the Presbyters no reason to complain, inasmuch as
they are not obliged by any Canon or Ecclesiastical sanction to which
themselves have not given their free and full assent in convocation, by their
representatives at least, if not in their own persons, which is exactly the
same sort of assent which the free subjects and freeholders of England give to
those laws which are enacted in Parliament, their consent being included in
that of their Knight or Burgess, and the major part of the representatives
including the whole, as reason and custom do require in all assemblies of this
nature, is at the same time interpreted as the act of the commons of England,
who are represented in the whole assembly.

But it is easy to see by the disorders that frequently happen in so small a
number, what confusion it would make, if all the people or the freeholders of
England, were actually to have a vote in the passing of every law, as by the
disturbances which oftentimes happen in the Livery, which is a smaller body,
in the Guild Hall of London, it is obvious to any man at the first sight how
much more intolerable the mischief would be if all the freemen were admitted to
a right of suffrage, from whence to avoid those confusions they are now
excluded.

And the same tumults and disorders would no question happen if all the
Clergymen in England being in both orders, were admitted to a liberty of
voting in the convocation, for Clergymen have passions and designs too, as
well as other men, and being supposed by their function to be of the wiser and
learneder sort, this naturally makes every man the more zealous to betray his
ignorance, when he cannot show his wit or understanding; he will be sure to
make up in noise and bustle what he wants in knowledge, and it will always
happen in this case, that the Bishops and the wisest and best men will be born
down with the crowd of the inferior Clergy, who being men oftentimes of little
maintenance and as little parts, will as naturally comply and side with the
humor of the people, as it is natural for the people themselves in all
nations, as often as they can or dare to affront their governors, and disobey
the laws, which however just and equitable in themselves, and however well
tempered and proportioned to the happiness of those to whom they are
prescribed, they look upon as yokes, that are not to be born and will be sure
to break them as if they were so.

To which it is to be added, that where so many are concerned in the dispatch
of an affair, besides the feuds and contentions, which different humors,
interests and designs would create, it would occasion infinite delays and
difficulties in their proceedings, which would often times prove fatal to their
designs, and utterly disappoint the end of their coming together.

And what has been said of the whole Clergy's meeting in one or in the two
several and distinct convocations of Canterbury and York, the same
inconveniences would in proportion attend the diocesan assemblies, if any such
were practiced, wherein the Bishop had no greater power than only to be as it
were the Chairman or Prolocutour of the Synod, but could not move one foot
himself without the consent of a majority of the members of which it was
composed, especially in so populous a diocese as Your Lordship's is, where the
power and interest of a factious Clergyman may be of such dismal consequence
to the peace of the church; but such is Your Lordship's paternal condescension,
mixed with an exact judgment and profound wisdom, that You have found out an
happy temperament betwixt the authority of the Bishop on the one hand and the
dangerous power of the Presbyters on the other, by admitting your Clergy to so
frequent conferences and familiar debates concerning the common interest of the
church, and the respective good and advantage of their particular charges, yet
so as not to admit them to a liberty of controlling their Bishop, or invest
them with a power which may be employed to bad purposes as well as be made
useful and serviceable to good ones, of which though at present there can be
no danger, in a diocese so well stored with men equally conspicuous for
integrity, prudence and learning, for loyalty to the King, and obedience to
their Bishop, and love to one another, and care of their particular charges and
flocks, yet that may be pernicious and destructive in its example which is not
so in it self, and power when it is once given to the best of men, is not so
easily taken away from worse that may happen to succeed them, as it may be
employed to purposes very contrary and opposite to those for which it was
intended; otherwise there is no question but it is the indispensible duty of
every Bishop, to maintain a constant intercourse and correspondence with his
Clergy, that he may the better understand, as well them, as the diocese which
he is to govern, and may be the better enabled to make a judgment of both, and
accordingly to proportion the expedients of public peace and safety with a
wise and skillful hand; and that he may conciliate that love and reverence to
his person by the affability and obliging sweetness of his conversation,
without which all power is tyranny and force, and will not only be resisted
but overcome. Wherefore I pray God that the church may always be blessed as long
as time shall endure, with such faithful, vigilant and prudent Bishops as Your
Lordship, and with so pious, learned and obedient a Clergy, as that in which
this diocese in particular and the whole nation in general is at present happy.

But what it is that they mean who would extend the power of the Presbyters
with relation to their Bishop any farther than this, or who declaim so loudly
for the peoples right in the election of their pastors, I cannot possibly
conceive, unless it be that they do seriously design and purposely intend to
bring us all into confusion, which it is not much to be doubted but there are
some that do, or that being engaged in an interest they are ashamed to retract
their error, and therefore grasp at all arguments how weak soever to defend
it, which it is very natural for mankind to do; or lastly, that they are not
so wise men as they would be thought to be, and that they do not see into the
pernicious consequences of so mischievous a doctrine, which stands condemned by
the unalterable decrees of nature, and by the fundamental maxims upon which
cities are built, and by which humane society is supported.

I should be sorry to perceive my self thus insensibly engaged in so long a
disquisition concerning the natural grounds upon which the episcopal government
relies, very much contrary to my first intention which was far from any thought
of treating so distinctly, and as it were ex professo at this time upon this
subject, did I not hope to do some service to the church by giving an account
of my sentiments upon it, and were I not possessed with a very great inward
assurance that this way of procedure in the matter under debate, that is, by an
appeal to the Principles of nature and to the fundamental maxims of society,
whether it be civil or ecclesiastical, or of what kind soever, is that which is
liable to the least exception, and is by consequence the most certain and
infallible expedient of bringing those with whom we have to do, to a sense of
their duty and an acknowledgment of their mistake; which if it could be done,
it would be happy for us all, and therefore with Your Lordship's good leave I
will proceed to what remains, referring my self humbly to the things that have
been or shall be spoken upon a question of so great importance, to intercede
with Your Lordship and all that shall read this Preface in my behalf, if by my
too great length I have offended,

Wherefore to improve the comparison of an army, that is, an armed city or
society, yet a little farther, for it is not yet stretched out to its full
length, since it appears so plainly by the consent of all ages and by the
constant practice of the world, that such a body of men cannot be managed by a
parity of officers, the next thing to be considered is whether the imparity or
superiority of one officer over another be consistent with an equality of
salary or revenue? and for this we have the same universal experience and
consent, that the pay of the greater officers is proportionably larger
according to their respective dignity and place, and the same is to be seen in
civil as well as military employments, that the great officers of state, the
Judges of the law, and ministers of public justice, according to their
respective dignity and superiority over one another, so are the pensions and
advantages annexed to their employments for the most part proportionably
greater; and if the church so far as concerns the general nature of a society
be the same, and do as naturally require an imparity of officers as either the
civil or military subordination, so do the several imparities of dignity and
power as unavoidably call for an inequality of revenue, the reason of which in
all the three cases is this, that mankind are used to pay a reverence to their
superiors, not so much for their own sakes, as for the sake of some outward
appearance, formality and show, for hospitality which they keep, and for the
train and equipage that attends them, and therefore this is another fault of
the Presbyterian government with has not yet been mentioned, that it can never
be so readily obeyed by the people, because it wants those outward appearances
of magnificence and splendor, which are the natural causes of reverence and
esteem among men, and which it is much more easy for them to obey, than to
submit themselves to the disciplinarian rigor of such as are upon the level
with themselves; for this is deeply rooted in the very nature of government,
that men will always pay a reverence to the port and grandeur of those that are
placed over them, but if you divest them of their trappings and attendance,
they lose their authority together with them, and will as infallibly be
despised, as ever they were esteemed or reverenced before.

It is true indeed that power without wisdom will lose it self, and will
unavoidably produce either hatred or contempt, by tyranny on the one hand, or
by too much easiness and softness on the other; but it is every whit as true
that though wisdom be that for which all mankind have a natural inward
reverence and veneration, yet whether it be from emulation, or ambition, or
whatever be the cause, but so it is in experiment, which is the surest way to
distinguish truth and falsehood in these matters, that the person of a wise man
is usually disregarded, where the splendor and appearance of a great one is
wanting, at least thus much must be acknowledged on all hands to be true, that
a wise and good man with the advantages of honor and preferment suitable to
his worth, is capable of doing more good in the world, and of influencing
mankind more powerfully by his authority and example, than he that wants those
advantages to recommend him.

Wherefore the great stress of the question lies here, is it at all necessary
that there should be any set apart to the office of the ministry, that is to
say, to be the preachers and examples of obedience and good life? If it be not,
if we are so governable and so good of our selves that we stand in need of no
monitour to put us in mind of our duty, I see no need at all we have of any
Clergy to instruct us; for at this rate every man would be a Priest to himself,
his life would be the best of Sermons to men, and the most powerful and
effectual prayer to God; mutual examples would preach to one another, they
would encourage and approve themselves, they would excite and animate each
other, and the earth would be as happy as heaven it self, the habitation of the
blessed, and the seat of glorified and immortal spirits.

But since the case is clear otherwise, since it appears by every days
experience that the world is overrun by luxury and vice, by evil habits, and by
bad examples, by strife and faction, by animosities, contentions, quarrels,
feuds and emulations; since these are the great plagues of humane life, and
since the removal of these, or at least the abating, as much as is possible, of
their malignity and destructive influence, is the greatest blessing and benefit
that can befall us, and yet a task so difficult to be performed, that all the
zeal and diligence of the best and the wisest men is little enough to bring so
happy and so desirable an event to pass, it follows unavoidably from the
consideration of these things,

First, that it is naturally necessary that in every nation there should be a
regular and standing Priesthood, whose business and employment it should be to
persuade to charity, good will and friendship, to preach obedience, repentance
and amendment, and to exhort to a constant and assiduous practice of all
whether personal or political virtues, which are the only expedients of
public and of private peace.

And, Secondly, that for the better enforcing the doctrine which they preach,
they should have an honorable subsistence dealt among them, lest otherwise
their persons and their functions fall into contempt, which they cannot do
without detriment to the public, if it be true, what cannot without abundance
of waywardness and wilfulness be denied, that such an order of men is at all
useful or serviceable to it.

And because all greatness is in it self not an absolute, but a comparative
thing, it is manifest that the grandeur of the Clergy, must be taken in
proportion from the other parts of the government, that so all the parts of the
civil and ecclesiastical state may have a symmetry with one another; for
instance, there ought to be a Bishop of a diocese as well as a Lord Lieutenant
of a County, a metropolitan of more dioceses taken together, as well as a
Praetor, Proconsul, or Bassa of a Province, and a patriarchal, as well as an
imperial seat having several such Provinces under its jurisdiction.

The reason of which is founded in the nature of society, and in the
unquestionable maxims of the truest policy, that there ought always to be a
proportion and harmony inviolably preserved betwixt the civil constitution and
the ecclesiastical; and I appeal to any man of common understanding whether,
besides the envy and opposition that such an establishment would meet with, it
would not be ridiculous and monstrous in the body politic, for any Clergyman
to challenge or arrogate to himself the state, revenue and equipage of a
Patriarch in an Hans Town of Germany, or in one of the ancient commonwealths of
Italy or Greece; or whether it would not as infallibly be an equal deviation
from the rules of government, if in a large Empire converted to Christianity,
such as the Roman was of old, after the time of Constantine the great, no
Clergyman should be higher than a Parish Priest.

I have very frequently in my mind despised that Phanatick argument against
Popery, (God keep us from such defenders of the Protestant Religion) that Paul
worked with his own hands, and Peter was a poor fisherman, great in nothing but
his faith and sufferings, and in the supernatural gifts that were bestowed upon
him; whereas his pretended successor in the Apostolical chair, as he is, at
this day, a very great temporal Prince, rolling in wealth, and armed with
power, and furnished with all the Regalia belonging to the Triple Crown, so he
assumes at least a spiritual authority over all the Princes and potentates of
the Christian world.

For though I do not believe the Pope or any Bishop to have such a power over
Princes as that they may depose them, or absolve their subjects from their
allegiance, or that they can commission any to hurt or annoy their sacred
persons, and much more to destroy or kill the Lord's anointed, to whom our
Savior and the Apostles themselves have given us so powerful examples and so
frequently inculcated Precepts of obedience, whose persons are and ought to be
inviolable by the laws of nature, and by the unalterable constitutions upon
which all humane society is founded, which can never be at peace within it
self, if the sovereign be accountable to any power but of God.

And though I do not think there can be such a thing in nature as an universal
Bishop, any more than there can be an ecumenical Monarch whom all mankind
shall obey, it being an unmanageable and unwieldy charge which no one man can
possibly undergo with so much care and vigilance as is intrinsic and essential
to the duty of a Bishop; yet thus much I believe, that let a temporal dominion
be as large as it will, it is necessary to the ends of an ecclesiastical
society, which is to provide for the peace and unity of all its members, that
as there is one King or Monarch over the whole, so there should also be one
Patriarch or Metropolite, to whom all the rest of the Bishops should be in some
sort accountable, and upon whom they should have a dependence, as their
respective dioceses are accountable to themselves, and as the particular flocks
are likewise to pay a spiritual obedience to the several pastors or presbyters
that are placed over them; because by this means it comes to pass that the
government is all of a piece, and the unity of the church, which is Christ's
body, is preserved, by the members being fitly framed together, as well with
respect to one another, as to their head.

Without this it is impossible to prevent schisms and contentions in the
church, and by consequence troubles and revolutions in the state, or at least
there is not all the care taken to prevent them, which humane prudence and
foresight might have used; and for the same reason that there are such
differences and inequalities in power, there ought also to be a like disparity
in the outward formalities of secular appearance and greatness, otherwise the
establishment of such a subordinate power will be a design that will not take
effect, an establishment that can neither be so strong nor so lasting as it is
intended to be.

For as obedience is the cause of peace, so are respect and reverence the most
natural and the most lasting causes of obedience, and it is that which they
call the Typhus secularis, the pomp and vanity of this wicked world; as vain
and as wicked as it is, it is a show of grandeur, an appearance of power, a
plentiful table, a numerous dependence, and a long train of moenical servants,
belonging to a wise man, who knows how to make use of these things for the good
of the world, that is the most certainly productive cause of reverence and
respect; it is that which, bating the terrors of the rods and axes, and
setting the fears of punishment aside, has a magnetic nature to attract
obedience, and a power of persuasion to make it an easy and a voluntary thing:
Whereas though it be true that no society can subsist without fear, yet it is
true likewise that it can never possibly be strong and lasting, unless that
fear be tempered by esteem and love; and as the latter of these without the
former would be every whit as unconstant and uncertain as the changeable humor
of a fickle mistress, so would the former divorced and separated from the
latter, be in its subject the vassallage of slaves, and in its object the
barbarity and fierceness of a cruel tyrant, which will not be endured any
longer than needs must.

For man is naturally a disobedient creature, and therefore when he feels
himself abused and oppressed, there is his interest added to his natural
inclination to prompt him to rebel; but when a government proceeds by wise and
sober measures, though every man would be glad to be uppermost himself, yet
when he sees a moral impossibility lying in his way, that ever he should arrive
to the top of his desires, and when he can propose greater and more certain
advantages to himself by obeying his superiors than by conspiring or murmuring
against them, this creates in him an artificial or a secondary inclination to
be content with his condition, and to obey the authority that is placed over
him; and still the wiser any man is, the more he considers the mischiefs of
contention, the sad effects of confusion, the greater likelihood that there is
of losing his own fortune in the public scramble, than of getting another
man's, besides the tenderness that all men have for life, and the folly of
encountering with the most dreadful dangers upon an improbable prospect of
advantage, and this makes him the more willing and ready to acquiesce in
present things, and to propose to himself no other than such advantages, as may
be acquired with the good leave of the government, and with consistence to his
duty.

But where the mold and frame of the constitution it self is such, that men are
in a manner upon a level with their governors, and do by consequence
universally despise them, here is a conspiracy ready formed, without the
White-horse consults or the Wild-house caballs, to resist and overthrow it, and
the general disposition which is in all to disobey, makes the government it
self precarious and uncertain, which was the great fault of the Presbyterian
establishment; for, besides that equality is the parent of disorder, the
eternal source of strife, animosity and contention, and breaks out unavoidably
into independency, anarchy and confusion, I say besides this, men do not so
easily submit themselves to the discipline in Cuerpo, as to the solemnity of
the present constitution, and to the grave and fatherly reproofs or censures of
a wise and learned Bishop; so that what they wanted of the natural causes of
obedience, they were forced to supply by severity and rigor, or rather, every
thing seems like rigor and severity, where we have a mean or no opinion of the
persons that command, for every thing they enjoin has the force and appearance
of tyranny and usurpation, and arbitrary government, when the governors placed
upon the level with our selves do not look as if they had a natural right to
challenge any duty or obedience from us.

The contrivers of this model were very sensible of this disadvantage, and
therefore the better to reconcile the people to it, they very wisely called
their lay-neighbours in, to come and take upon them a share of the
administration; the lay elders were to rule the Parishes and to fill the
consistories, and the people, which is without question a very fine sort of
government, were to be governed by themselves, not considering that as laymen
neither are nor can be fit judges in ecclesiastical matters, so in the general
they do not understand sufficiently the nature of laws and the design of
punishment, they have not sufficiently considered the wise proportions and
temperaments of mercy and justice, they have not for the most part such a sense
of humanity, or such a comprehenfive prospect of the interest of the world, and
of the natural issues and results of humane actions, as is requisite to
qualify them duly for the charge of being public censors and perpetual
supervisors over the belief and manners of their brethren; but it oftentimes
comes to pass that he who is the richest man in a Parish, and by that means
puts in most powerfully for a mongrell Presbyter, is very far from being either
the wisest or the honestest in that circuit, and if he be of an insolent
humor, as many of that sort are when they get into power, for want of study
and liberal education, (besides the constitutional frailties which are common
to all men) if his temper be rather overweening than overwise, and if he have
gotten his estate by injustice and oppression: I need not say what an excellent
government we are like to have, when men thus qualified are got into the
saddle, the thing speaks but too plainly and too loudly for it self, so that
this device though a very proper expedient, till the inconveniences of it began
to be experienced, to cully in the vulgar to a compliance with this promising
model, that seemed as if it were intended to make all men governors, yet upon
experiment it will always be found to be one of the true causes that will for
ever render the Presbyterian government an odious and an intolerable thing.

It is absolutely impossible that any sort of society, be it civil, be it
sacred, or of what kind soever, should subsist, without some laws to govern it
self by, or without censures and punishments in case of disobedience; and
because the unity of the church depends very much upon that of the Clergy, who
are its officers, among themselves, therefore it is very natural for a man to
ask this question, -- Quis custodiet ipsos
Custodes --


Who are they to whom the inspection or supravision of the Clergy themselves
does most properly and rightfully belong, or who are they to whom it is best
and safest that the government and superintendencie of the Clergy should be
committed in order to this end, namely, that the peace and unity of the church
may be preserved? And I answer, that it is best it should be entrusted in the
hands of such overseers as shall be chosen for that purpose out of their own
number, and that for two reasons.

First, that all mankind do most easily, most willingly and readily obey those
of their own order and profession, the reason is because all men have a
passionate love for themselves, which though they will not own at every turn,
yet we may discern it plainly by a fondness which they are subject to express
for the most faint resemblances of themselves in others; a tradesman or
artificer, setting other considerations, which are nearer him, aside, has a
greater kindness for one of his own trade or company, for a brother, as he
calls him, of his craft and profession than another; a mariner would choose to
be commanded by a captain like himself that has been bred in a seafaring life,
and a soldier had rather serve under an old beaten officer, that perhaps was
once a common soldier, like himself, than under some novice or unexperienced
youth who has nothing but a great birth and fortune to recommend him, nay he
would take the severest discipline in good part from such an one, when yet if
the other should inflict the same severity for the same offense it might cause
an embroilment and disorder in the army; if they mutiny for want of pay, the
promise of such an one that he will look after it, shall signify more with
them than if another had paid them down half their arrears, they will follow
him cheerfully into the greatest dangers, and though it be at himself that they
have taken perhaps a very excusable and justifiable displeasure, yet his bare
presence and appearance among them shall have a wonderful eloquence to
persuade them to be quiet, it is like old friends and lovers that are fallen
out, they are glad on both sides to accept of any offers of reconciliation,
because there is kindness at the bottom, and they have a complacency in one
another.

Upon the same account it is, that men that are far from home are used to be
mightily pleased when they meet with a countryman of theirs, and much more with
one of the same town or neighborhood with themselves, although it may be when
they were at home, they had no knowledge of him; and let them be where they
will, yet if a man in his childhood have been but playfellow or schoolfellow,
if it so happen that he was born in the same parish or neighborhood with
another, who is famous for any art or skill, or is arrived to any great honor
or preferment, the man whenever he talks of it is almost as proud and as well
pleased as if himself had been the very person that is so wise, so skillful or
so great, and if he himself had been to prefer one into the same dignity or
high emploiment, supposing that he had no greater interest to conduct his
choice, he would infallibly prefer his countryman or his townsman before any
other competitour whatsoever, merely because he is so, and because of a certain
imaginary resemblance and likeness with himself.

Thus men that are of kin to greatness do reap a pleasure and satisfaction from
it, though they have neither honor nor estate themselves; and they who in a
mean fortune are yet descended of an ancient and illustrious stock, do take a
pride in thinking fuimus Troes, and for the likeness which they fancy betwixt
themselves and their progenitors they attribute all their honors, their
actions, their endowments, their virtues, their successes in some sort to
themselves.

To conclude, a Monk has usually a passion for his own order, a scholar has
the greatest kindness for those that are skillful in his particular
seize, for his own College, his own University, and every man has a
comparative fondness for every thing and person, wherein either nature has
made or education painted the least imaginary resemblance of himself.

To which it is to be added, that those honors and preferments which the
governors of the body ecclesiastic, being themselves members of the same
body, enjoy, as they are very natural and very certain expedients of procuring
reverence and esteem to their persons, and by consequence of making them fitter
for the end of government, which is obedience; so they are so far from being
grudged or repined at, by the inferior Clergy, that they do naturally rejoice
in them, and as they do in some sense enjoy those honors and those preferments
for the reason of self-love and self-likeness which has been lately mentioned,
so the consideration of them inspires them with gallant thoughts and virtuous
designs to make themselves capable of the same rewards and dignities in time to
come: for it is certain that all great attainements in any kind whatsoever are
owing to an honest and a generous ambition, and Mr. Hobs says somewhere
excellently well, nisi qui laudem amant, pauci faciunt laudabilia, so we may
say with equal truth, nisi qui ambiunt honores, pauci faciunt quae sunt
honoribus digna. The Scripture it self bids us look to the recompense of
reward, and press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling, and it is
certain that no man will or can do any thing with a steady purpose of mind,
wherein he does not propose some interest to himself. The prospect of such
advantages in future, makes a man obedient, as well as industrious for the
present, and by setting an example of submission to his superiors, and of
diligence in his station and emploiment, he is in both respects an instrument
of great honor and great service to the Church; he is in the ready way to make
a wise and excellent person, and will be the more readily obeyed when he comes
to govern, for having showed an example of obedience before.

But if there were not such honors and advantages to be met with in the
Clergy, then there would certainly these two notoririous inconveniences follow,
first that the governors of the church would lose very much of their authority
and power, which they cannot do without prejudice to the government it self,
and secondly, that the want of due encouragement would produce in the inferior
Clergy, a scorbutic idleness and inactivity, a want of due concern either for
the peace of the Church or for the honor of it; it would subject them to the
humors of the people, from whose kindness they might in this case expect as
great or greater secular advantages than they could propose to themselves in
any other course, so that instead of being the instruments of obedience, they
would by this means become the speaking trumpets of faction; and so it was seen
in the late disorderly times, when the Episcopacy was demolisht, and the
dignitary lands were all of them confiscate, men preached up rebellion for
lecture contributions, and I doubt not but many of them acted much against
their consciences for no other reason but to please the rabble.

It is an old saying (...), it is not to be denied but there are some instances
of very gallant men to be found in the reformed churches abroad, and that too
where they have not the benefit of episcopal government, but I dare appeal to
the dissenters themselves, if they will speak their consciences, whether ever
there was so plentiful an harvest of wise and excellently learned men as are
to be found at this day among the Clergy of the church of England, and whether
among themselves there be any such thing as learning to be met with, whether
both city and country are not now better furnished than in the late times, with
excellent preachers, and men that can speak sense, which is more than they can
do, or whether the Universities are not better stored with men of great
seize on the one hand, and great hopes on the other, than in the days
when humane learning and that abominable idol carnal reason were for the most
part banished with the King and the Bishops; the reason of which cannot
possibly be referred to any other cause, but only the more ingenuous
Principles that are now abroad, and the greater encouragements men have now
before them to study and take pains, and deserve well of the world.

This is certain, that the wisdom of Princes has always been so sensible of
the usefulness of ecclesiastics to the service of the public, for the
security, honor and safety of their governments, for the composing and calming
the minds of their people into a peaceable and obedient temper, that they have
thought no honors and advantages too great to bestow upon them as a reward of
their merit, and to make their authority still greater in the eyes of the
people; and it was very wisely provided by our ancestors in such a government
as this is, where the people have so great a share in the making of those laws
by which they are afterward to be obliged, that the Bishops should have a
place allotted them in Parliament, as well as the nobility or the commons have,
and that for their greater honor, and to give them a right of suffrage in the
house of Lords, they should have Baronies annexed to their respective sees.

For where the people have so great an interest in the enacting of their own
laws, there, if the Clergy be totally excluded, if there be none admitted into
the assembly to look after the interest of the ecclesiastical state, it will
most certainly and unavoidably come to pass, that by the envy or the ill
designs of men the Clergy will be deprest and trampled on at some time or
other, which it can never be without detriment to the state, upon supposition
that they are at all advantageous or serviceable to it.

Nay, if it be granted that they are of any use, it must be granted likewise
that they are the most useful persons that do or can belong to a society, and
therefore ought to be the most highly honored and esteemed; for what greater
blessing can there be than peace? or what greater plague or calamity can befall
a nation than to be embroiled in sedition, enflamed with strife, raging with
opposite and eager passions? what better instruments can there be in any state
or kingdom, than they whose business and whose study it is to exhort to peace,
and charity, and obedience, to submission to the government and love to one
another?

Certainly if the Lawyers get so much, and are so highly caressed and rewarded
sometimes for ending controversies, and sometimes for making them endless,
sometimes for setting men together by the ears, and at others for parting the
fray to the disadvantage of the true pretender; the Divines are much more
worthy to be honored and rewarded, whose business it is to prevent all strife
and contention, and who have perhaps determined as many controversies in a
cheap and amicable way at home, as ever the other decided at the bar, to the
ruin sometimes of both the parties concerned, and always to the signal
detriment and disadvantage of one.

I do not speak this to disparage or undervalue the learned Gentlemen of the
long robe, whose profession I acknowledge in every state to be not only
useful, but necessary to its peace and welfare, so far as it is not abused by
ill men, or by tedious delays, and by traversing of courts and actions, to the
infinite vexation and oppression of the subject. But, I say, the prevention of
all strife is a much more noble, excellent and useful thing, than the deciding
of controversies after they are actually begun, as it is better to prevent an
ague by a wholesome diet, or by a regular course of life or by preventive
medicaments before hand, than to remove the fit, or by degrees perhaps the
disease it self, by many repeated doses of the Jesuits powder, which when it
has had its utmost operation, there will still be some dregs of the disease,
and some of the very medicine it self that was intended to cure it, that will
remain behind; and so it is in law, though the suit be ended, yet the
contending parties are not reconciled, and the very going to law, which is the
remedy of strife, does oftentimes beget a quarelsome and contentious temper,
and make men more troublesome to their neighbors for the future, whether they
get the better of the cause or no; as losing gamesters play on out of hope to
repair their losses, and they that win so long as there is money stirring upon
the board, or an estate to answer the credit which they give, are every whit as
eager as the other, out of hope that fortune will continue to be kind.

And as the Priesthood for their usefulness excel the courts of justice,
inasmuch as it is a much more noble and more worthy emploiment to create in men
an obedient and charitable temper, by the one of which they shall converse with
the greater kindness and benevolence among one another, and shall be ready at
all times to hearken to truth and reason, and to submit their cause to the
umpirage of common interest and universal justice, without respect to private
ends or persons, and by the other they are rendered more tame and tractable, and
more easy to be governed, and in both respects contribute so much to the
peace, and happiness, and safety of each other; I say, as this is an emploiment
undoubtedly more excellent than that which is chiefly conversant about the cure
of diseases and the decision of quarrels, after the mutual hostilities are
begun, and has a much greater recourse to force than to persuasion, so it is
likewise in the order of nature before it, and in both respects it is, that the
Priesthood in all nations are not only worthy of double honor, but it is
absolutely necessary to the ends of government that they should have it.

But yet I do not deny, nay, I have already expressly granted and affirmed it,
that it is a part of our business and duty to reconcile differences as well as
to prevent them, as it is on the other hand a part of the counselors
emploiment to prevent quarrels by deeds of settlement and by antecedent
agreements and stipulations consented to by both parties in due form of law, as
well as to end them by bringing them to an issue and a verdict at the bar; but
still these two things remain unquestionably true.

First, that the greatest part of the Divine's business is preventive, and the
greatest task of Council learned in the law, is conversant not so much in the
prevention of controversies as in their final issue and determination.

Secondly, That as we prevent quarrels, so we reconcile them too after another
manner than the Lawyers do, we persuade to peace among our selves and to
obedience to the governors that are set over us, by endeavoring to infuse
such peaceable and charitable dispositions into men, as shall not only prevent
or reconcile one quarrel, or be a means of producing this or that act of
obedience, but shall be a lasting principle of action that shall run through
our lives, and in every particular instance that can be given, shall naturally
dispose us to act so, as is most friendly to one another, most dutiful with
respect to our superiors, and in both cases most for our own inward peace and
rest, for the quiet of the world and the happiness of mankind.

The Divine reconciles one quarrel so as by that principle upon which the
reconciliation proceeds to prevent another: The Lawyer prevents a quarrel so as
to make men uneasy under the restraint, and reconciles a difference after such
a manner as to leave the embers of a lasting animosity, and the seeds of a
contentious, discontented spirit raked up and glowing under the ashes of the
cause.

The Divine says, do this and you shall be happy, do it, or we cannot help
your being miserable, for there are natural troubles and inconveniences annexed
to all unreasonable and unjust actions; there is an almighty arm which you
cannot resist that is over you, and there is a vengeance expects you in the
world to come which it is in vain for you to think of escaping upon any other
condition than that of repentance and amendment.

The Law says, do this or you shall be severely punished; the law promises
nothing, neither indeed can it, for the rewards of virtue are natural and owing
to the actions themselves, therefore if the action will reward it self it may,
but the law gives nothing but impunity to obedience, and to disobedience
proposes terror.

And after all, its sanctions, which are founded in fear, are not only less
persuasive, because there is no argument to persuade to obedience to a positive
law but fear; because there is nothing to be got by submission but impunity, or
if any good consequence follow from it, it is no thanks to the law but to the
nature of the action; whereas the Divine who proceeds upon the nature and
tendency of actions, does not only work upon the fears of men, but likewise
upon their hopes and their desires, but he has also this advantage that the
terrors which the law displays, are only such as belong to ouvert actions
after due proof and process has been made, so that in many cases there may be
an hope of escaping, nay, a moral impossibility that a man should be
discovered, and so the inclination to evil remains, being cherished by an hope
of impunity and concealment, and although the outward act be in many particular
instances restrained, yet the inward principle of the mind is not altered all
this while, which cannot be done by any menace of the law, but by showing men,
whether they are discovered or not, that virtue and obedience are always for
their interest whenever they will consider all things impartially together.

And as the terrors of the law may be escaped, which cannot be said of those
of nature and religion, which are unalterable and unavoidable, so also, as
being but humane terrors, they may in many cases be resisted and overcome by
men, and sometimes they are laid asleep by the connivence and partiality of men
to one another; but in the rewards and punishments whether of natural or divine
laws, the case is clean otherwise, for so far as they proceed from the natural
issues and tendencies of actions, they have as necessary a dependence upon
their emanative cause, as the light has upon the sun, or the stream upon the
fountain, or heat and warmth upon a quantity of combustible matter already
kindled and in an actual flame, so that the causes or actions themselves being
supposed, there is no way to avoid the natural effects that are consequent upon
them; the rewards are certain, the punishments inevitable: virtue cannot be
separated from the advantages that are linked to it by a necessity of nature,
nor wickedness be practiced without the natural inconveniences that do by plain
and physical causalities attend all its motions and follow it by a line of
punishment, and a winding clue of guilt, which runs all along parallel to that
of sin, into all its most secret laby rinths and retirements.

Again as those rewards and punishments that are future and eternal are
therefore the most inviting on the one hand and the most dreadful on the
other, because of their eternity and everlasting duration, so is the
delightful prospect and assurance of the one rendered so much the more certain,
and by consequence more amiable and lovely to us, by a reflection upon the
veracity and goodness of that being, who to the natural arguments upon which
the belief of a blessed immortality depends, has added the more certain and
express ratification of his written word, and the terror of the other is
rendered still more formidable and more awful to us, by reflecting upon that
justice which cannot be bribed, that power which cannot be resisted, and that
knowledge to which all things are naked and exposed, compared with the
provocation which our sins have given him to stretch forth his mighty arm and
inflict all his vengeance upon us.

But yet I know not how it comes to pass, there is a charm in the denunciation
of judgments, as well as in the promises of happiness and reward, and those
calamities, which, being conditional and avoidable, cannot be avoided or
resisted upon the breach of that condition upon which their avoidance or
averruncation depends, have a certain eloquence to persuade and please, as well
as a dismal apprehension to startle and discompose us; and these two states of
happiness and misery being set in opposition to, or interwoven skilfully with
one another, are like the well tempered lights and shades of an exquisite
master in the art of painting, and afford a mutual advantage to each other,
they are like the discords in music happily met together to compose a melody
of charming sounds, like the jarring elements by the divine power and wisdom
reduced into the catholic unity of the world, and upon the whole matter, there
is as much difference betwixt the dry terror of an humane law, and the
insinuating charms, the soft and melting persuation of the natural and divine,
as there is betwixt the violence of saws and chisels, the screaking of a cart
or carriage-wheel upon its loaded axis, with the unnatural force of pulleys and
of cranes to compel the stones and timber into a fitness and harmony with each
other for the erecting of some stately building, and the prevailing harp of
Orpheus or Amphion, by which they are persuaded to come of their own accord and
place themselves in a beautiful and proportionable order; betwixt the notes of
Arion and the noise of thunder, by one of which the Dolphins are affrighted,
and to the other they dance.

Not that I would be thought to insinuate in the least, as if the restraints of
humane laws were not of absolute necessity in every commonwealth, nay they are
indeed so necessary that there can be no society without them, for what is an
humane society, but a society governed by humane laws? and it is but too
notorious by every days woeful experience, that all the restraints that can be
laid upon men, whether they be natural, divine or humane, are little enough,
nay they are too little, to conquer our frailties to subdue our appetites, and
to withstand our temptations; but yet it is still manifest that those arguments
are more strong, and consequently those persons more useful in every Kingdom
or state, whose business it is, to create an inward principle of duty and
obedience, than those which only respect the outward act but have no influence
upon the mind and will, one of which is the case of natural and divine laws and
the other of the humane, which by not being able to punish any thing but the
outward act, do in a manner give a license, if there were nothing else to be
considered, to all the secret and concealed iniquity that can possibly be
committed.

To which it is to be added, that the hopes of pardon, the prevalence of
interest, the importunity of friends, and, which is more, of money, the
consideration of our common frailty, and the mutual pity and connivence of men
that have offended or may offend toward one another, are things that do
extremely rebate the edge of humane punishments, and by consequence, by
allaying and qualifying those fears which are the only motives to obedience to
any humane law, they are a proportionable temptation, or at least they give
strength and power to those temptations which prompt us to offend and disobey;
and lastly, when an unlawful fact is never so evidently proved upon us, yet
there are three things that in many cases do either mitigate the punishment or
utterly remove it. First, That though a fact be never so wilfully committed,
yet either by the favor of chance, or by the design and contrivance of the
offender or by the art and eloquence of a subtle advocate it is capable of
extenuating and alleviating circumstances in the appearance of the world.
Secondly, That though a law be never so carefully drawn up by wise and skillful
men, yet there may oftentimes evasions be found out to elude its force, and
frustrate its design. And, Thirdly, That in commiseration of a man's family and
of the innocence of those that are to suffer together with him, there shall be
mercy shown for the sake of others though not for that of the offender himself.

But now the laws of nature are plain, impartial, inflexible, inexorable, their
sanction is founded in such goods or evils as flow immediately from the nature
and tendency of such actions or such habits considered in themselves, and by
consequence they are such as cannot be avoided, but the punishment will for
ever bear a proportion to the guilt, and the rewards of innocence and virtue
will always be proportionable to the things themselves, and then as for the
divine laws, the terror of the Lord, by which we endeavor to persuade men,
can no otherwise be avoided but upon the condition of an hearty and sincere
repentance joined to an effectual and thorough reformation, or at least a
steady purpose of it, if God should be pleased to grant us a longer life; and
this last, generally speaking, will not do neither, because a deathbed
repentance at the close of a wicked life, lays no manner of congruity upon the
divine goodness, neither does it come within the terms of the covenant, which
Christ has purchased for us with his blood; and if a general pardon should be
allowed to be granted to all that do heartily repent when they come to die,
this would be a thing of very bad example, and every man so long as he found
any appetite within him, or any temptation to be complied with from without,
would naturally defer his repentance till that time, and therefore it is highly
just and reasonable to suppose that God generally proceeds with men by other
measures; and, to be sure, to sin on upon that supposition, that God will
pardon us at the last cast, is in it self so bold a sin, so intolerable a
presumption, so great a provocation, that setting aside those sins which are
consequent upon it, this alone would be enough to sink us into the bottomless
pit, from whence there is no possible redemption to be expected.

It being therefore so clear of what importance and usefulness the Clergy or
Priesthood in all nations is, to the creating in men a peaceable disposition, a
virtuous and obedient temper of mind, for the happiness of all and of every
particular person, it must be granted likewise that it is moreover necessary
that all humane care and provision should be made that they may not fall out or
squabble among themselves, either about matters of discipline or doctrine,
because this will lessen their authority, and consequently their use and
service among the people; the question therefore is, to whom it is best that
the exercise of this discipline should be committed, whether to a Lay Judge, or
an Ecclesiastical, and I answer, as I have answered already, that it is best
this jurisdiction be entrusted with the latter of these, because men do more
easily obey their superiors in their own order, besides that the jurisdiction
being placed in Lay hands the Clergy have no prospect, but of perpetual
subjection, without ever hoping to be governors themselves, and this damps
their spirits and diminishes their authority, and chokes that honest and
laudable ambition, which is at once a cause of wisdom and virtue in themselves,
and of obedience to those that are in authority over them.

But then secondly, a second reason why it is undoubtedly best for the Clergy
to be governed by Superiors of their own Order, is that as the persons to be
governed do more easily obey them, so those that are to govern when they are of
the same order, and have lived formerly in the same condition and circumstances
of life with those that are to obey, have the greater sense of what is
reasonable and just to be expected from them; they will not in probability
behave themselves like rigid taskmasters, but equitable supervisours, and are
the more likely in all their constitutions and in all their censures to put
themselves into the place of their dependents, and to consider that as being
their own case again, which has been so once already; they have something in
them which is very like that which the Greeks call (...) or natural affection
to the persons of those over whom they are placed, and for the honor and
credit of the profession, and the others in requital do (...), they express
their resentment of this Paternal tenderness and love by such an obedience,
reverence and profound respect as becomes those who have the relation of Sons,
in that which the Canon Law calls, though in another sense, the Spiritual
cognation; and certainly so much care on both sides, on the one not to enjoin
any thing but what is reasonable and fit to be done, what is for the interest
of the obeisant parties and of that of the profession, and on the other not to
disobey any thing that is so, must needs make very much for the Honor and
Reputation of the Clergy, and if such an Order of men be of any use, for the
service of the world.

To which two considerations there is likewise a third to be added, which
though in it self very obvious I did not think of before, and that is that
Clergy men, that is, men that both by their Education and Profession have
devoted themselves to the service of the Church, are certainly the best and the
most proper Judges of Ecclesiastical whether things or persons, and by the same
reason that all the civil Guilds or Fraternities in a Corporation have Masters
and Assistants out of their own number, to whom the chief conduct and
administration of the affairs of such a Society does belong; by the same reason
that in a Parliament, a Committee for Trade shall call in Tradesmen and
Artificers to their assistance to take their opinions in the matters under
debate, of which they are naturally supposed to be the most competent Judges;
by the same reason, that a Lawyer invested with the power and Character of a
Judge sits to hear and determine controversies upon the Bench, not a Musician,
an Astronomer, a Grammarian, a Chemist, an Architect, a Divine, or at least not
because of any of these endowments or qualifications with which he may be over
and above adorned, but because of his skill and ability in the profession of
the Law; by the same reason certainly and upon the same Maxim, because
credendum est artifici in sua art, a Clergy man must needs be the most proper
Judge in matters that are of Ecclesiastical cognizance and concern, if we will
but grant this easy supposition that Divinity is more than an empty name, and
that it does require a proportion of pains and study as well as other
professions do.

There are three Powers or Offices in every Ecclesiastical Society the full
exercise and administration of which does without all question naturally and
rightfully devolve upon the Clergy, and not upon all the Clergy neither, but
only upon the Governors or Bishops of it.

The first is the power of Ordination.

The second of Visitation or inspection, from whence they have the name of
Bishops or Overseers.

And the third of Excommunication.

For the first, it would be impossible to prevent innumerable Heresies and
Schisms in the Church, if every Presbyter had the full power of Ordination in
his hands, but it ought to satisfy the Presbyter in this case that he is not
totally excluded, but that he is called in as an assistant to the Bishop, and
that the Ordination is performed according to the genuine practice of antiquity
by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, as well as by that of the
Ordaining Bishop himself. For the third, if every passionate Clergy man out of
private ends or out of a rash and ungovernable temper might Excommunicate and
devote upon every light occasion, it would at once bring the Ecclesiastical
censures to contempt, and be a means of infinite mischiefs and confusions in
the Church. And for the second it depends upon the first, for as they say in
Law, ejusdem est condere and interpretari, so by the same reason, the power of
Visitation or inspection must be seated in the same hands in which the
Ordination is placed, the design and intent of it being only this, to examine
whether every respective Curate or Incumbent do answer the end and meaning of
his Ordination.

And for the more authoritative and effectual administration of so great a
charge, it is requisite that the Port and Dignity of the Bishop above the
inferior Clergy may hold a proportion to his rank and station; and it is in
vain in this case to urge the poverty of the first Apostles and Preachers of
Christianity, who supplied by Miracles and supernatural inflictions, what they
wanted of the natural causes of Authority and greatness among men, not that I
would be thought to plead for such an excessive Pomp, as has more of pride and
vanity than real use, but as it is nenecessary to the ends of every well
regulated Clergy, that their condition in the general should be according to
the admirable Mr. Cowley's wish,

Too low for Envy, for Contempt too high.

So to answer the meaning of his institution, it is necessary there should be a
proportion of grandeur in the Bishop, suitable to the weight and dignity of his
charge, and to the eminence of his place and order in the Church.

I shall conclude this matter, with observing that Princes in all ages, who
certainly may be thought to understand Government as well as ever a busy
Lay-elder of them all, have always thought it safest for the quiet of their
Dominions to govern by Bishops, and I appeal to any one of common
understanding, supposing the Roman Empire to be still as great and flourishing
as it was of old, whether the unity of so great a Body, would be more likely to
be preserved, by the government of Presbyteries pecking at one another and
every moment in danger of crumbling into pieces, or by the Episcopal
subordination, which makes the Church of God like a fair, firm and well
compacted building whose parts do all give beauty and strength to one another;
and I do farther put the case, if we suppose all Christendom at this day to be
governed by Presbyteries after the newfangled Republican Model, and having so
potent a Monarch as the Turkish Sultan for their neighbor, whether its
strength, however broken and disunited, would be so firm and so well united as
it is at this day to make head against him, or so likely to hold out against
the terrors or temptations of the Asiatick steel or gold. These things are
easy to be considered and computed by any man of sense and experience in the
world, and are, if I am not very much mistaken, a plain and unanswerable
demonstration on the Episcopal side, for certainly that Government which is the
best calculated for the peace of the World, is also the most agreeable to the
Gospel of Christ, that Government which is the most likely and proper to defend
Christendom, does best answer the ends of Christianity.

Not but that in the Episcopacy as in all Governments there may be
inconveniences too, because men are men and always will be men as long as the
world endures, but it is sufficient if it labor under fewer disadvantages than
the Presbytery does, or if it be the best Government that can be thought of to
prevent the passions and designs of men from putting the world in a perpetual
flame.

There have been feuds and animosities in ancient time among the Bishops, but
that is not the question, but only whether they would not have been greater
and more frequent in proportion to their number in a National or Provincial
Synod of the Presbyters, as there are disturbances sometimes in a Parliament
house, but does it follow therefore that to prevent those inconveniences the
whole Kingdom should meet together in a general Assembly to make Laws, or would
not the dangers and inconveniences be incomparably greater on this side than on
the other? Or may I not now fairly sum up the evidence in the words of that
great Presbyterian St. Jerome, in his Dialogue ad Luciferianos, Ecclesiae salus
in summi Sacerdotis dignitate pendet, cui si non exors and ab omnibus eminens
detur potestas, tot in Ecclesiis efficientur schismata, quot Sacerdotes.

It remains still that, as I promised, I should give some account why I have
appeared so zealous for the execution of the Laws against Dissenters, but the
reasonableness of that is now sufficiently seen by the happy success it has
had upon the affairs of a distracted Kingdom, so that my answer is already made
to my hands, and I have nothing to add, but my Prayers to God that the same
Justice and Vigor may continue, and my most humble Petition to your Lordship,
that you would pardon the presumption of this long address, for the sake of its
honest and well-meant intention from, My Lord,

Your Lordships most humble dutiful and obliged Servant John Turner.

Advertisement to the Reader.
BEcause the Reader may be apt to be inquisitive how far the Sermon it self, as
it was Preached, went, therefore for his satisfaction it is thought fit to let
him know that it reached as far as p. 23. at these words, the wise provision
which the Church has made. There were two or three particulars added which are
not inserted, being very brief and in a concluding form, and therefore
inconsistent with the additions that have been made.

Farewell.
1. COR. 14. 40. Let all things be done decently, and in order.
THE unhappy breaches and differences among us in matters of Religion are at
present the subject of universal Complaint; and though nothing be more talked
of than an Union among Protestants against the common Enemies of our Liberties
as we are English men, and of our Faith as we are Christians; yet, if we will
believe men's Actions, rather than their Words, there is nothing that seems less
heartily to be desired, or, if you will give me leave to speak a little
plainer, for it is not now a time to mince the matter, with more solicitous
Care and Industry to be avoided.

For my part, I am not come hither to inflame those differences, and, if I
were, it is twenty to one but I should lose my Errant, for they are so great
already that perhaps they are incapable of being increased.

But, if you will allow me that liberty which every man now pretends to as his
birthright, that is, to spend my private opinion about the public Concerns, I
will put you in a way by which this blessed Union can only be effected, and
that is, by keeping up strictly to the Discipline of the Church, and by doing
all things decently, and in order.

We have, almost every day, many excellent Discourses delivered in the Pulpit,
to persuade us to mutual Charity and Forbearance with one another; and indeed
this is in a manner the whole design of Christianity, to produce in us those
calm and peaceable dispositions of mind which are best fitted to make us happy
in this life, and to prepare us for the blessedness of that other state, whose
very nature consists in perfect Charity and perfect Peace. Wherefore Saint Paul
tells us plainly, that without charity, which is the very bond of Peace, and of
all virtues, all our pretenses to Religion, and all our seize in it, our
proficiencie in spiritual knowledge, and our super-errogation, if that were
possible in good works, will signify just nothing at all; though I speak with
the tongue of men and Angels, says he, and have not charity, I am become as
sounding brass, or a tinckling Cymbal; and though I have the gift of prophecy,
and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so
that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing; nay, though
I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned,
and have not charity, it profits me nothing. And if to the Testimony of St.
Paul you will add the greater Authority of our Savior himself, he makes
reciprocal Charity and Love to be the distinguishing mark and character of his
Disciples, By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one
another.

If therefore this Charity which is so essential to a Disciple of Christ, that
he cannot be so without it; if the Union of the spirit in the bond of peace can
be preserved under differing denominations of different Sects and Parties,
notwithstanding the different external forms and circumstances of Divine
Worship; if all or any of those pious and learned Exhortations, which have been
made to persuade you to this Christian temper, can have that good effect which
is intended by them, notwithstanding the various forms of Church Government,
and the diversity of all other outward appendages and ceremonies of public
Worship; if we can fear God, and honor the King, and love one another, as well
and as heartily in the midst of these differences, as if there were no such
things to be found among us, then, by my consent, let all the Ecclesiastical
Enclosures be laid open, and let every man worship God, so he do but worship
him in spirit and in truth, and believe aright as to the fundamental Articles
of the Christian Faith, according to his own particular humor and fancy;
because by gratifying such an harmless, though unaccountable humor, there can
no inconvenience follow, but by disturbing and crossing it there may; and
therefore the ends of Religion will be better served by a diversity in Worship,
than by an uniformity of it.

But now, on the contrary, if it should prove true, as it will most certainly,
if either Experience or Reason can be heard amongst us, that the only way to
Unity and Peace is by an Uniformity of Discipline and Obedience. as to the
external circumstances of Divine Worship, then this great end, being so
necessary as it is for the procuring us all that Happiness which either this
World or the next can afford us, will justify all the necessary means that can
be used in order to the obtaining it.

Wherefore Uniformity being necessary as a means to Peace, and yet being
impracticable unless the Church be supposed to be invested with a Power of
prescribing the external modes and circumstances of Obedience, it follows
plainly, that the Church is actually invested with such a Power, and that all
its members are bound to obey its Prescriptions.

For the Topic of Experience, it is not without some unwillingness that I
mention it, much less do I think it proper at this time and place to lay open
the wounds of our late unhappy times, or present you with a mournful Scene of
those Miseries and Distractions which neither can nor ought to be remembered
without Amazement and Horror. But if you will, every one of you, retire into
your own thoughts, and ask your selves the question, What it was that brought
those dreadful Calamities upon us, that involved three flourishing and
powerful Kingdoms in Blood, and Slaughter, and Confusion, that made the Gods
to dye like men, and fall like one of the Princes; while Slaves were set over
us to be our Masters, and Frogs were heard croaking in the Chambers of our
Kings; then you your selves will answer for me, It was the tender Conscience
dissolved into rebellious Pretenses, that carried Order and Government before
it, and overflowed all things with a resistless Stream; it was a Cry against
Discipline, and Ceremonies and humane Institutions; it was a Clamor for
Liberty, against Will Worship and the Ordinances of men; it was a Spirit of
Sedition, a Thirst after Innovation, an insatiable Humor of being dissatisfied
with all the wholesome Establishments of Unity and Peace; it was an Itch of
new-modelling both Church and State; it was a Pharisaical Pretense to farther
Improvements of Purity and Holiness; it was Discontent, and Jealousy and godly
Fear, lined with Hypocrisy and Dissimulation, that reduced our Beauty and
Order into Ashes, that laid the magnificent and comely Fabrics of the British
Church and Empire, the Amazement of themselves, and the Envy of their
neighbors, equal with the ground; and, instead of one firm and well-compacted
Building, raised paper Tenements of crumbling Sects and Factions, which,
instead of being able to support themselves, betrayed us in a manner into that
Security which we now enjoy.

While we, forgetful of those Miseries under which our Fathers and our selves
have groaned, unthankful for those Blessings which, under the shade and
protection of a wise and happy Government we receive, ungrateful to Almighty
God, who out of that Chaos of Confusion has reared this new world of
Establishment and Order, displeased with the fatness of the Olive, and the
sweetness of the Fig Tree, and quarrelling with the friendly and sociable Vine
that cheareth God and Man, are calling again for the Bramble to reign over us,
and for the Thorns and Briars to protect us; or like the Israelites in the
Wilderness, surfeited with Miracles, with Manna, and with Quails, with the dew
of Heaven, and with the fatness of the Earth; with liberty and ease and plenty;
we are looking back for Slavery from our old Taskmasters in the Land of Ham,
and longing for the Garlic and the Onyons of Egypt.

But because an instance taken from our late Confusions, may but exasperate
whenit should convince. Let us avoid the mention of that Crying Guilt, for
which this Land of our Nativity has wept in tears of Blood, and should for ever
mourn in Sackcloth, and humble her self before the Lord in Ashes; and let us
trace the footsteps of Antiquity, and search the Records of the more innocent
and early Ages.

What was the reason in the Mosaic Dispensation, why all the external niceties
of divine Worship, in their Feasts, and in their Sacrifices, and in their
Lustrations were so carefully adjusted, by the particular designation and
appointment of God himself?

It is true indeed, that most of those Ceremonies were of a symbolicall nature,
and were designed to shadow out unto the Jews, either that purity, simplicity
and innocence of mind which God expects from all his worshippers and servants;
or else they were figurative and emblematicall Representations of the life and
death and sufferings of the Messiah, and of that more perfect Dispensation
which was to be introduced into the World by him.

But yet notwithstanding, it must not be denied, that there are many Ceremonies
to be found in the Law of Moses, which being equally commanded by God himself,
were of equal obligation as to their performance, with any of the rest, of
which no such Typical account can be given. And therefore the reason of their
Institution can only be this, That since every thing must of necessity be done
with some Ceremony, in some Place, or Time, or Order, or Gesture, or Manner and
Circumstance, or other; it pleased God for the avoiding of Confusion, and for
the preservation of an uniform and orderly way of Worship, which would
otherwise be exposed to perpetual change, disturbance and alteration, to adjust
and determine the particular circumstances of those indifferent matters,
because considering the perverseness of some men's minds, and the diversity of
their several fancies and humors, such changes and alterations could never
happen without a considerable breach of Charity and Friendship among men; which
must needs be a wonderful Obstruction as well to the interest of the Civil
State, as to all the religious Performances and Duties, both as to their
devotion in themselves, and as to their acceptance with Almighty God.

If therefore the nature of Mankind, be still the same under the Gospel that it
was under the Law; if the reasons for the necessity of Uniformity be the same
now that ever they were in former ages; if the method of this Uniformity be not
adjusted by God himself under the Gospel, as it was under the Law; and if this
Uniformity cannot be obtained unless the Church be invested with a right and
power of prescribing the terms of it; than it follows plainly, as has been
already observed, that the Church must be invested with such a power, because
else it would want the necessary means of its own unity and preservation, which
every Society must be supposed by the Laws of nature and reason, to be invested
with; and if the Church be invested with such a power, then all its Members are
under an indispensable obligation to obey it, because that Power which may be
lawfully disobeyed, is no Power at all: And this is sufficient to vindicate the
exercise of Ecclesiastical Censures.

And if you demand further, Whether it be lawful for the civil Sanction to
interpose in behalf of the Church, to see that its Orders and Injunctions be
duly and faithfully executed and obeyed, I answer that it is for this plain
reason, because the Civil Power has a right of exacting all kinds of lawful
Obedience from its subjects; and this obedience if it were not Lawful, could
not be enjoined by the Church it self.

But besides the express provisions of the Law of Moses it self, there were
also several pretended traditions of Moses from Mount Sinai; there were
likewise the determinations of their Wise men in controverted cases; the
Decisions of the Tannaim and the Amoraim; and of the Schools of Hillel and of
Schammai, the two so much celebrated, but disagreeing Founders of the
Pharisaick Order. For which Traditions and Determinations of their famous
Masters, the Jews had usually as great if not greater Veneration than for the
Law it self; and they were at length swelled into so vast a bulk, that (like
the Missals and the Rituals of the Romish Church at this day, which are so full
of Ceremonies, burthensom in their number, frivolous and superstitious in their
use) they ate out the very life and heart of true Religion; as our Savior
himself in several places of his Gospel with no less Justice than severity
complains.

The Heathen World had also their Sacred Offices prescribed by a certain Form
as well before as under the Law: And the same is the case with the Mohammedan
and Pagan Idolaters at this day; which Ceremonies of theirs, though for their
number they be intolerable to a devout Soul, which cannot suffer it is self to
be so far taken off from the more inward and substantial part of Religion,
though in their nature they be mostly foolish, and in their use Superstitious,
and in their design Idolatrous, as being directed to a false object; yet as
well these as the Jewish Formalities do prove thus much by the common consent
of Mankind, that an Uniformity in the outward circumstances of Divine Service,
is necessary to the more due and solemn performance of Religious Worship, and
to the public peace and quiet of the World.

What is the reason that at this day the French Persecution against the
reformed Religion and its Professors, rages with so much violence and fury,
thorough all the spacious Territories and Dominions of that mighty Monarch?
Shall we think it is a Zeal for the Catholic Religion, as they are pleased to
call it, that is for a Fardle of absurd, ridiculous and blasphemous
Superstitions, that inspires so wise and powerful a Prince, with so mean
thoughts of Cruelty and Revenge? Shall we think he acts upon a principle of
Conscience, who has sufficiently discovered to the world by his insatiable
thirst after Empire, which cannot be purchased without the price of Blood, that
he has no other principle of action than that of a boundless appetite of Rule
and Greatness? Shall he be thought to act upon a principle of Duty and
Religion, who makes destructive and depopulating Wars without giving a reason,
and violates the faith of Peace by arbitrary Dependances and unwarrantable
Claims? Who conquers more by the peremptory Decrees of his late erected
Chambers, than by the conduct of his Generals, or by the numbers, discipline
and valor of his Armies?

What therefore can be the true cause and motive, why he that glories in the
blessed title of the Most Christian King, should yet notwithstanding, persecute
Christianity it self? What else can be the true reason of all this Cruelty and
seeming Madness, but that he wisely considers that the true way to Empire
abroad, is by unity and peace at home, that a Kingdom divided against it self
cannot stand; and that these differences of Religion, as they have done already
in the experience of that Kingdom as well as ours, will some time or other
prove the occasions of great disorders and commotions in the State?

And shall we not then make use of the same wisdom for the support of
Christianity, which is with so much diligence and zeal made use of by others
for its Extirpation? For Popery is either no Christianity at all, or it is
Christianity wrapped up and hid in such an heap of Ceremonies and Superstitions,
that it can hardly be discerned.

Is it worth our while to contend about Ceremonies when we are losing the
Substance? to squabble and fall out about indifferent things, when our Religion
and our Liberty, our temporal and eternal Interest lie at stake? If the
things prescribed be indifferent and consequently lawful, why do we not show
that they are so by complying with them? If the quarrels raised about
indifferent matters, do yet notwithstanding rise as high, as those which are
agitated between the Papists and us about matters of a necessary and
unalterable nature; why do we not cement and compose these unhappy breaches, by
adding Humility to Obedience, and by submitting to every ordinance of man, so
far as we may without any violation of the Laws of God or right reason?

All our public feuds and animosities are comprehended in our Religious
Disputes, and if they were but once composed, we should be an happy Nation. The
King would be glorious, and his People secure. We should be safe at home and
formidable abroad. We should be in a condition to succor our Allies, to relieve
the distressed Protestants, to keep the balance even betwixt our neighbor
Princes, and to stop the progress of the Arms of France, which threaten to
involve all Europe in Slavery and Superstition together. Whereas now all we are
able to do, is to give protection for a while to persecuted Religion when it
flies hither for shelter.

But what will become of us, when the same torrent of Ambition, having
overslown what ever stood in its way, shall at length beat upon the British
Shore? Shall we suffer our selves to be devoured by our own intestine
Divisions, when the Enemy from without is battering our Walls and throwing in
his Bombes among us? or shall we not rather unite together for our common
safety? and shall we not severely repent that we did not sooner do it before it
was too late, that we did not take sweet counsel together and go into the
house of God as friends?

Certainly this one consideration, if it were but powerfully and frequently
impressed upon our minds, must needs have a wonderful influence upon us, and
must even fright men, and compel them by arguments both of fear and love, into
a thorough Reconcilement with the best of Churches, before it be too late, as
well out of a principle of Interest as Duty; for besides the considerations of
this World, it ought to afford matter of very sad reflection to us, or at least
to so many of us, as have been active either in causing or ^omenting the
Differences that are among us, that we must one day give a dreadful account
before the Judgment Seat of God, for a great part of that Blood which has been
spilt, and of those Spoils, Rapines and Depredations, which have been made by
the ambition or injustice of our Neighbors. We must be accountable for the
oppression of our persecuted Brethren beyond the Seas; and for ought we know,
if these destructive Animosities be not soon composed, for the removal of the
Candlestick from among our selves, and for the final extirpation of the
Protestant Religion.

The Jews had their Ritual, and the Christians their Liturgies or set forms of
Divine Service, the one before Christianity, and the other long before Popery,
were known in the World.

And first, As to the Jewish Ritual, which cannot be denied to have been a
thing of humane Institution, it was so little disapproved by our Savior, or
rather so highly approved, that he has been observed by Scaliger, and Buxtorf,
and Camero, and Hugo Grotius, and other learned men, to have borrowed most of
those expressions which he makes use of in the Institution of the blessed
Sacrament of his Body and Blood from thence; and that Hymn which after the
Celebration of that blessed Feast, he and his Disciples went out to sing
together on the Mount of Olives, was by Paulus Burgensis a Converted Jew and a
learned Bishop of the Christian Church, and out of him by Buxtorf, Drusius, and
others, conjectured to be the same which the Jews are used to call the Hallel
hagadol, being a Song of Praise and Thanksgiving, consisting of several Psalms,
and used to be sung in consort at the Feast of the Passover and other solemn
occasions.

And that God Almighty has actually approved those indifferent circumstances in
Divine Worship which have not been of his own appointment, being either not
contained in the Law of Moses, or no where commanded in Scripture, and in use
long before the Law was delivered; I will here prove by two other Instances,
which I the rather mention, because they are omitted by the learned and
judicious Writer of the Libertas Ecclesiastica; and because they are no where,
that I know of, taken notice of to this purpose.

The first shall be taken from that passage in the Psalms, Early in the morning
will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up, in which words, the
Psalmist, addressing himself immediately to God Almighty, expresses the Posture
in which he would pour out his Prayers before him, by looking up toward
Heaven; now, because we cannot imagine he would have made this Vow of looking
up to God in Prayer, if he thought it would have been displeasing to him, and
if, on the other hand, it can be proved that this was the general custom of
that Country in all their Prayers and Supplications; then we have here an
Instance of an indifferent Posture in Prayer, which the general custom of
Judaea had by degrees brought into the authority and reputation of a Law, which
yet was no where instituted by any Divine Command; but that this was the
general practice is plain from the Roman Authors, who tax them upon this
account with worshipping the Clouds and the Host of Heaven. So Juvenal,

Quidam sortiti metuentem sabbata patrem,
Nil proeter nubes and coeli numen adorant.
And in the Catalecta of Petronius,
Judoeus licet and Porcinum Numen adoret,
Et coeli summas advocet auriculas.
Which places, though they be otherwise interpreted by Mr. Seldom and other
Learned men, and the reading of the latter of them questioned by Doctor Isaac
Vossius, in his Notes upon Pomponius Mela, yet I conceive the first place dos
sufficiently vindicate the reading of the latter; and the Interpretation of Mr.
Seldom, instead of destroying, will rather help and encourage that which I have
given; for the reason why the ancient Jews called God by the name of Shamajim,
or Heaven, was the same with that, for which they looked heaven-wards when ever
they prayed unto him, namely, because they thought the more peculiar and
beatisick presence of the Divinity to be there; and this is the first Instance.

The second shall be taken from those words of God to Moses, Exodus 3. 5. Draw
not nigh hither, put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for which he subjoins
this reason, for the place whereon thou stand is holy ground: now though it
is true that Moses was bound upon the least signification of the Divine
Pleasure to obey it, yet this would have been no reason of his Obedience had
there not been such a custom in the World before that time; which, not having
the least foot-step of a Divine Command, was probably owing merely to humane
institution, but yet we see was approved by God himself.

This Custom prevailed also under the Law; though in the Law it self it be no
where enjoined, in all their solemn Feasts, as appears from this, that the Jews
are commanded to eat the Passover with their shoes on; which would have been a
needless Command, if in their other Festivals they had not used to put them
off; which was therefore done, because every meal among the Jews, but more
especially their solemn Feasts, was in the nature of a Feast upon a Sacrifice,
as I could prove more largely if it would not be a digression; and therefore,
being about an act of religious Worship, they were used to put their shoes off,
as the custom of those Countries was in like cases.

For this reason the Turks at this day do always go barefoot into their
Moschs: and it was a Precept of Pythagoras recorded by Iamblichus, in his Life,
(...), sacrifice and worship God with your shoes off. The Romans also did the
same at their Feasts, as is evident from several places of Martial and others.
Joshua is likewise commanded, by the Angel of the Lord, to do as Moses had
done before him, Josh. 5. 15. Loose thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place
whereon thou stand is holy; and Joshua did so. Marinus relates of Proclus,
that he, being about to worship God, made use of this Ceremony in the
performance of his Devotions, (...) -- (...).

And, because the Servants, as I conceive, were used to attend their Masters to
Divine Service, as Naaman the Syrian was used to go along with his Master to
the Temple of Rimmon, and there to take off their shoes or sandals for them;
from thence is that proverbial Speech of John the Baptist concerning our
Savior, whose Fore runner and Harbinger he was, Joh. 1. 27. He it is who
coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe latchet I am not worthy to
unloose. Lastly, in allusion to this custom is that passage of Juvenal, in his
sixth Satyr,

-- deinde adamas notissimus, and Berenices
In digito factus pretiosior; hunc dedit olim
Barbarus incestoe, dedit hunc Agrippa sorori,
Observant ubi festa mero pede sabbata reges,
Et vetus indulget senibus clementia porcis.
So that here we have two plain Instances of Institutions in matters of an
indifferent nature approved by God, but commanded only by men, for an
immemorial custom whose original or legislative sanction cannot be traced, and
perhaps it never had any, but crept in by degrees, is as much an humane
Institution as a possitive Command, of whose Author we can give never so clear
an account, as the Common Law of England, is every whit as much of humane
institution as the Statute; and those Tenures which hold only by Custom or
Prescription are to all intents and purposes as good as those which have Deeds
and Charters to produce.

Wherefore, if Custom may be complied with in these cases, then so may any
other humane Institution, and if Custom may not, then is it unlawful for us to
go to our Devotions at those times when our Neighbors and Countrymen are
used to frequent them, because this is an Imposition upon our Liberty, which is
not tied up either to place or time any more than to any other indifferent
circumstance of action.

But if the places and times of Divine Worship may be lawfully determined by
the Authority of the Church, (and if they may not, then the Church has no power
to see that God be worshipped at all, for he must be worshipped at some place
or time or other,) then I see no reason why the same Authority may not equally
extend to all other indifferent circumstances of action.

As for the use of Liturgies and Set-forms of Prayer in the Christian Church,
there is nothing more plain than that, as far as we can trace Antiquity, they
have been constantly used, several of the ancient Liturgies are at this day
extant among us; and the Service both of the Church of Rome, and our's, is in a
great measure taken from thence: nay, so ancient and in such constant use have
they always been in the Christian Church, that we have unquestionable
Instances of them: in the Apostolical times themselves, as has been learnedly
observed by a Dr. Lloyd, Bishop of St. Asaph.
Reverend Prelate of our own from Justin Martyr, in his second Apology, who
calls the Prayers of the Christians in his time, (...), Common Prayers: and
from Pliny, in an Epistle to Trajan, very often cited by Learned men in defense
of the Christians of the primitive times, who, being examined by him concerning
their Manners and Religion, affirmabant hanc fuisse summam vel culpoe suoe vel
erroris, quod essent soliti stato die ante lucem convenire: carmenque Christo,
quasi Deo, dicere, secum invicem, etc. The Learned Prelate, whom I have newly
mentioned, understands this place of Verses answering one another by turns, as
we speak the reading Psalms; and I know not, says he, how he could better
express it. And indeed this must be allowed to be a very proper, and a no less
acute and ingenious Interpretation; for the Psalms themselves were many of them
nothing else but Hymns of Praise and Thanksgiving which were composed for the
Service of the Temple, and this ancient way of worshipping God by Hymns, as
well in the heathen World as among Jews and Christians, is evident from the
Hymns of Homer, Orpheus, Callimachus, and others among the Greeks; from Hymns
of a like nature to be met with in the Interludes of the ancient Dramatick
Poesy, in the Odes of Horace, and in the Writings of Statius, Catullus, and
others: And in allusion to this it is that the same Pliny says, in a
Complyment to Trajan, Animadverto etiam deos ipsos non tam accuratis adorantium
precibus quam innocentia and sanctitate loetari: gratioremque existimari qui
delubris eorum puram castamque mentem quam qui meditatum carnem intulerit.

Among the Christians, to be sure, the singing of Psalms and Hymns in honor of
God and Christ, and for the mutual benefit and edification of one another, was
always looked upon as a special Duty, and we have several places of Scripture
which do not only vouch and justify, but also enjoin this Practice.

If therefore Hymns and Psalms, in which many are to bear their parts, cannot
possibly be sung but by a Form; if they must be composed before they can be
sung; if this be a true and proper exercise of Devotion and Divine Worship; if
Praise and Thanksgiving be essential parts of Prayer, as is manifest from that
Petition in our Savior's own Form, Hallowed be thy Name; nay, if it be the
most exalted and sublime exercise of a devout mind; and if all this may be
done, and in many cases must be done by a Set-form; then, why may not the same
be true of all other parts of Prayer? and, why may we not from hence conclude,
that a Form of Prayer, as it is always lawful, so it is in some cases
necessary to be used? it is necessary, because Psalms and Hymns cannot be sung
without it; and it is necessary, because in some cases we are enjoined to sing
Psalms or Hymns by the express command of Scripture.

And here, before I pass by farther, let me ask our dissenting Brethren one
Question, they in their Congregations are used to sing together the Psalms of
David converted into English Rhimes, some of them of one man's composing, and
some of another; now, though the words of the Psalms themselves, especially as
they are in the original, were divinely inspired, and therefore they may
pretend, though it be a Form, yet it is not a Form of humane Institution; yet
the words of him that puts them into Meeter are not David's words, any more
than a Paraphrase and the Text are the same: the same sense may be expressed in
different words, and those different words are so many different forms to them
that read them; from whence it is manifest that they do not pray by David's
Form which was inspired, but by the Translator's, which is of humane
Institution; and why then do they declaim so loudly against a Form of Prayer?
Why they will tell us, the Scripture has no where enjoined it; but I have
proved the contrary, and they themselves confute their own Pretenses by their
Practice.

But, suppose the Scripture did not enjoin it, what then? if we must neither
pray with a Form nor without, unless the Scripture bid us do one or the other,
then we must not pray at all; for the Scripture does not any where command
either of these, unless it be in the use of the Lord's Prayer; and yet at the
same time enjoins us to pray without ceasing.

But these Gentlemen, if they were half so good Philosophers as they are bad
Divines, would have understood before now, that all Prayer is a Form, and that
without a Form it is impossible to pray at all: for the sense at the bottom of
all Prayer is the same; it is either a devout acknowledgment and admiration of
the Divine Excellence and Perfection, or it is a thanksgiving for his Mercies,
or an humbling our selves before him for our Sins, or entering into new
engagements and resolutions of a new Life, by offering up the Sacrifice of a
broken and a contrite Heart; or lastly, it is a deprecating those Judgments
which hang over our heads for our Sins, and an entreating his Goodness for
those Blessings which the necessities of our nature, or the circumstances of
our fortune and condition do require; and let these things be expressed with
never so much variation of phrase, yet it is not that variation in which the
true nature of the Prayer consists; but it is the sense which is at the bottom,
which is always the same, as a tune is the same, though it be pricked down by
never such variety of marks, and a sentence the same, expressed by several
ciphers.

It is not the words that God regards, but it is the inward Ardency and
Devotion of the mind, which may be the same with a Form as without it; ^ay, in
trut^, it may be greater with a Form than it can be without it, because then he
that officiates, not being to seek for what he is to say, and his fancy and
invention, not being perpetually upon the rack, his mind is the more intent and
fixed upon the Object of his Devotion, and upon a sober and considerate
reflection upon those things which make up the entire theme and subject of his
Prayer: he is not apt to dishonor God, nor to expose himself and Religion to
contempt by rash and inconsiderate expressions uttered in the heat of a
distempered and inconsiderate Zeal, which we find by experience, I speak
without reflecting upon any particular person, many of our nonconforming
Brethren do, as well in their Prayers as Sermons, for want of duly considering
what they have to say beforehand, which shows plainly what extreme Presumption
and ^olly they are guilty of, when they pretend to utter such contemptible
stuff by the assistence of the Spirit.

It is true indeed, there was in the first ages of the Church such a thing as
the Gift of utterance, but it was when men of mean parts and education were
sent forth to preach the Gospel by our Savior himself, who without this could
not have delivered themselves as became the Ambassadors of so great a King; it
was at a time when the World could not be converted without Miracles, when the
Fears of Death and Torments and Persecution would have put all their natural
faculties to silence, had they not been assisted and encouraged by an
extraordinary influence of Divine Grace from above: It was at a time when they
were to be carried before Magistrates and Rulers, to give an account of
themselves and of that Gospel which they preached; and then it was necessary
indeed, that a particular assistence of the Divine Spirit should overpower the
fears of death, and remove all apprehensions of danger out of their way, and
that the words which they were to speak should be given them and put into their
mouths at that very instant, lest otherwise, for want of ability or courage,
they should expose and betray themselves and the Gospel.

But at this time of day there is no necessity of any such supernatural
assistence; and that it is not actually afforded appears partly from the
experience which we have of those that pretend to it, and partly from this that
Saint Paul expressly tells us, that the Gift of Prophecy, of Tongues, and of
Knowledge were in time to fail; and if they be not failed already, as well as
those other miraculous Powers of Healing Diseases, and of Casting out Devils,
we have little or no reason to believe that ever they will; besides, that the
Gift of Tongues being manifestly ceased, and these three being mentioned
together, we have abundant reason to conclude, that those of Prophecy and
Knowledge are ceased together with it.

But after all, we have no Promise in Scripture, that God, though by his Spirit
he will furnish us with affection and zeal to the end of the World, will ever
put the very expressions into our mouths; the Spirit it self helps our
infirmities, says Saint Paul, speaking of this very business of Prayer, but it
is not with a Gift of utterance, but with Groans that cannot be uttered: let
our words be what they will, so our hearts be but right, God is well pleased.

Compositum jus fasque animo, sanctosque recessus
Mentis, and incoctum generoso pectus honesto.
Hoec cedo ut admoveam templis, and far litabo.
It is true indeed, such is the nature of style, that the same sense clothed in
different expressions, shall either extort respect or laughter; the reason is,
because all speech is either proper or metaphorical; in proper speech, where
the words are the real and immediate marks of the things they express, there we
are affected with the sentence according to the opinion we have of those things
which are contained under it; but in metaphorical, we are differently affected,
as the Metaphors are taken from things of a contemptible or a serious and
useful nature.

Now nothing is more plain than that in religious Discourses, whether in Prayer
or Sermon, nothing ought to be said after such a manner as to move laughter or
contempt instead of exciting Devotion and serious attention; but whether this
end be more likely to be attained by an extempore or well-considered and
premeditated Prayer, let any man of common sense and understanding judge.

And though such rash and inconsiderate expressions may be well enough approved
where they are uttered among people that are affected by noise rather than by
sober and judicious expressions, by a sound and wholesome Form of words, yet it
ought to be considered, one would think, how unbecoming such things are to the
gravity of one that pretends to teach and instruct the World, or to the Majesty
of that Person whose Character he sustains; what scandal it gives to
understanding men, and what advantages to the profane: and lastly, how
unsuitable it is to the design of Religion, which is to make men happy by
creating in them a calm and sedate temper; not so much to move their Passions
as to inform their Judgments, and to prepare them for Happiness by wisdom and
instruction.

But if there be any who, by the strength of natural parts, by the quickness of
their fancy, or the volubility of their tongues, by long custom, or acquired
habits, by art and study, by ringing the changes and by shuffling the same
expressions at several times into a several order and method, shall from thence
seem either to themselves or others to be possessed of this Gift of Prayer, yet
they are in truth and reallity very much mistaken, and it will appear they are
so, in that they generally use these, whether talents or acquirements, or
artifices and devices of theirs, rather in a way of ostentation than use, by
spinning out their Devotions to an unusual length, and by endeavoring to
captivate the ears and hearts of inconsiderate people by that much speaking
which our Saviviour condemns.

Thus it appears plainly that a sober and well-considered Form of Prayer is a
manifest advantage both to the Speaker and the Hearer, and to the latter it is
an advantage in a respect which I have not yet mentioned.

If I pray in an unknown tongue, says the Apostle, my spirit prays, but my
understanding is unfruitful. 1 Cor. c. 14. v. 14. And again, v. 16. how shall
he that occupies the room of the unlearned, say Amen. From whence it follows
plainly, that in this age especially, when the miraculous effusions of the
Spirit are in a manner wholly ceased, those Prayers are the best to which we
are best prepared to say, Amen; but those are manifestly Forms of Prayer;
because in those we go along with the Minister himself; nay, we understand
beforehand what it is he is about to ask, and so are the better prepared to
join withhim, and to say, Amen, heartily, devoutly and preparedly to all his
Petitions.

And the same Chapter will likewise furnish us with another argument against
these extempore Effusions, when they are truly and properly, and not only
pretendedly so, which is but to put a cheat upon the People; namely, that they
are subject either to the heats of Enthusiasm on the one hand, or to the
coldness of Non plus and Drawling on the other; both of which expose Religion
to contempt in the opinion, or at least in the practice of those whose design
and interest it is to make it contemptible and cheap, and serves to alienate
the affections of much wiser men than ever they are like to gain over to
themselves.

If the whole Church be come together to speak with Tongues, and there come in
those that are unlearned and Unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
and if the same or a like advantage may and will be taken from the indiseretion
of every extempore Pretender, there is the same reason why he should lay by his
pretenses, and give way to a sound and sober Form of words.

The truth is a premeditated and an extempore Prayer have each of them their
inconveniences, the latter cannot be without them; and the first, if it be not
done by ^ man of some judgment and experience, he does usually endeavor only
to show his parts, as if his design were to recommend himself to the good
opinion of God Almighty for a man of Eloquence and Wit: the premeditated man
does oftentimes talk so fulsomely as if his design ^ere to cajole and cokes the
great God of Heaven and Earth; while the man of gifts and graces, as ^e thinks
himself, does by ridiculous or rash expressions, by mimical gestures and
affected alterations of his voice, by speaking sometimes so high as if he would
prevail with him by clamor, and sometimes so low as if he had a secret to
communicate to his Maker, openly affront and abuse him to his face and in the
face of a numerous Assembly.

B^t both these Inconveniences are happily avoided by the wise provision which
the Church has made.

If then the use of Forms of Prayer in the public Assemblies of Christians be
not only lawful in it self, and justified by the practice of all ages before
the Reformation, but also manifestly tending to Edification, and freed from
very many and very great inconveniences to which extempore Addresses are
exposed, and therefore necessary to be allowed.

And if though Forms of Prayer be necessary in the general, yet this or that
particular Form be not, otherwise the Liturgy of all Churches and all Ages must
be exactly the same.

Lastly, If no Formulary of Divine Service can be introduced into the common
use and practice of the Church but by the public Sanction, whether sacred, or
civil, or both, then we have here a plain instance of a lawful humane
Imposition in indifferent matters; for though a Form of Prayer be necessary,
yet this or that Form is not; from whence it follows, beyond all possibility of
contradiction, that an humane Imposition in indifferent matters, or a
Determination of those indifferent things by the authority of men to one part
of the indifference is not in it self unlawful, and whatsoever may be lawfully
commanded is of necessity to be obeyed, unless we will renounce all obedience
whatsoever.

However, thus much will certainly be granted by the most avowed Assertors of
the Separation, that we have every one of us a right and power of determining
our selves in those indifferent matters; for otherwise the nature of their
indifference is destroyed; and yet if thus much be but allowed, they will find
themselves driven to an absolute necessity, either to contradict themseves, and
to affirm contradictions in a breath, to say that the same things are and are
not indifferent at the same time, or else they must bid adieu to their beloved
Cause, and give submission to the Authority of the Church.

For whatever natural Liberty men have in themselves, when once they become
members of a Society, they are supposed to give it up to the legislative or
governing power of that Society so far as is necessary to the peace and quiet
of it; for otherwise a Society and no Society would be exactly the same, that
is, every man would still remain his own Master, and at liberty to do as much
as ever he could before.

For example, in that which Mr. Hobbs is pleased to call the State of Nature,
when a man is not a member of a Body politic, but a distinct and perfectly
independent person by himself, he is naturally invested with a right and power
of defending his person or his possession by force of Arms, he may lawfully
revenge his own injuries, and he is the only Judge when he is wronged or
injured; because without all this power he cannot live in the World, or
continue in that Being which God and Nature have given him.

But if having listed themselves by mutual covenant and agreement into a Body
politic or Commonwealth, for the mutual defense and preservation of every
particular person and of the whole Society, men shall notwithstanding after
this assume the same liberty to themselves of personal Revenges, and of being
their own Judges in controverted cases, without referring themselves to the
decision of the Law which is the civil Umpire betwixt man and man, it is
manifest this Society cannot be of long continuance, or rather so long as this
Liberty is taken it can never be a Society properly so called; from whence it
follows plainly, that it is necessary, if men will be members of a Society,
that they give up this private power into the hands of the public.

If therefore the Church be a Society truly and properly so called; if it be
that mystical Body of which Christ is the Head; if the members of this Body
cannot be knit and well compacted together without external rules of discipline
and order, in which the very nature of a Society consists; if the public
Orders of the Church and every man's prescribing rules to himself be
inconsistent together, and if the observing no rule or method at all either in
Divine Worship or civil conversation be rather like a man in Bedlam than a
Denison of a sober Corporation; if charity, good will and love; if mutual
helpfulness and reciprocal usefulness to one another; if peace with God, and
peace with men, and peace within our selves be the great design and business of
the Christian life; if a man cannot be at peace with God while he is at enmity
with his neighbor; if a man can neither love, nor fear, nor know, nor worship
God aright at the same time when his thoughts are taken up and filled with
envy, uncharitableness, detraction and revenge; if no man can be happy in
himself when he is displeased and angry with other men; if the controversies
raised about matters confessedly indifferent have been, when and wherever they
have happened, a perpetual bane and disquiet to the Church; if they always
heighten men's Passions against and alienate their affections from one another;
if they are always attended with a disturbance of the public peace, and have
de facto proceeded to the utter subversion both of Church and State; if all
these Animosities and Contensions would immediately cease by a quiet and
dutiful submission to the Authority of the Church; if by giving up this Power,
the Church, as a Body politic or Society of men is actually dissolved, a
Society or Aggregate of several persons, being no otherwise one. than as they
submit to the same Laws and are governed by the same external Rules of
discipline and obedience; if Place and Time, notwithstanding they be
indifferent in themselves as to this or that particular determination, yet is
it necessary in the general that they should be determined, otherwise there can
be no public Worship of God: lastly, when men are met together in a religious
Assembly; if every man shall follow his own particular fancy; if almost every
single person shall be seen in a different posture; and if this be more like to
make men look upon one another than to attend to the Minister or to mind
themselves; if it be more like to excite laughter than devotion; if it be a
natural obstruction to the solemnity and seriousness of religious Worship; if,
done by chance, it be a sign of too great negligence and remisness; and if,
done on set purpose, it be a sign of conceitedness and spiritual pride, while
every man prefers his own way, and despises that of another; if it be a ground
of censure, and may be a cause of uncharitableness, and, by degrees, of
separation; then is it plain, upon all these accounts which I have mentioned,
because it would be better if it were so, and because it is necessary that it
should be so; because the Church can neither preserve it self in reputation nor
so much as in being, because it is for its undoubted and its perpetual
interest, and because it is necessary to its preservation, that it should be
invested with an Authority of adjusting the most indifferent circumstances of
Divine Worship; without which the blessed ends of Unity and Peace can never be
obtained: I say; it is plain from all this, that the Church is actually
invested with this Power, and that Ecclesiastical Constitutions may for the
same reason determine indifferent matters, for which the Civil forbid Adultery
and Murder, namely, because it is necessary to the public Peace; which
reason, if it be not sufficient, the Civil Laws do all of them become
immediately null and void, as being founded upon no other basis but the
consideration of the public good; but if it be a solid and substantial reason,
I would fain know, if any of the Dissenters be at leisure to inform me, why it
may not equally extend to defend the necessity, and consequently justice of
Ecclesiastical whether Laws or Censures.

Especially if we consider that, as the case of the Christian world now stands,
the same persons, with the same interests, prejudices and passions are members
both of the Civil and Ecclesiastical State; so that it is as impossible there
should be a disturbance in the one, in which the other shall be unconcerned, as
that the same man should be divided from himself; and it is every whit as
clear, that either it is not lawful to use all necessary means for the
preservation of the Civil Peace, or it is lawful for the Church to concern her
self in the determination of indifferent matters, which Determinations and
Constitutions of hers may be lawfully confirmed and ratified by the State.

If men could differ without falling-out, something might be pretended in
behalf of an innocent, though unbecoming Liberty, but since the greatest feuds
and animosities do sometimes take their rise from the smallest beginnings,
since the religious differences are of all others the greatest, and the most
fatal to the public Peace, since there is nothing so infinitely scrupulous as
an unreasonably tender Conscience, and since there is no pretense so
inconsiderable, from whence either indigent or ambitious men will not take
occasions to advance their secular designs under the specious covert of a
Concern for Liberty, or a Zeal for Religion, it behooves those in public
Authority, as they tender the reputation of their own wisdom and justice, or
the quiet of the World, to cut off all occasions of disturbance, by seeing that
all things be done decently and in order, which rule of the Apostle's is
founded upon the same reason upon which all Laws whether humane or divine are
founded, and from whence alone they can and do receive their obligation,
namely, the common Interest of mankind and the particular Happiness of private
persons; it depends upon the same reason and the same necessity, for which
Injustice and Robbery are forbidden, or upon which Industry, Sobriety and
useful Arts are encouraged; which is nothing else but the consideration of the
public Good, which if it be as plainly concerned in this as in any other case,
this is sufficient to defend the Authority of the Church, and to make its
Sanctions in indifferent matters, so long as they are steered by principles of
undoubted Interest, to be of perpetual force and obligation.

Those actions are properly said to be indifferent, which may either be done or
let alone without inconvenience or advantage to the public, or to the interest
of any private person; but if any prejudice or advantage will accrue, then
there is a plain reason why they should be done or omitted, and consequently
they cease to be in different, and become necessary in proportion to the weight
of those reasons upon which their performance or omission is founded.

So, for example, we will suppose it for the present indifferent in what
posture we say our Prayers in a public Congregation; yet if we say them at
all, thus much is of absolute necessity; that we say them in some posture or
other; but now if the Civil or Ecclesiastical Magistrate, for the avoiding of
Confusion, and for the preventing of those Piques and Animosities which
frequently happen among men about things of little or no value in themselves,
especially when Religion is concerned, shall ordain that all men shall say
their Prayers in one and the same posture, and shall determine and assign what
that particular posture shall be; then here is a reason of Interest for the
good of the World, and for the quiet of that Society of which we are members,
why this posture should be used rather than any other; and consequently this
posture, though indifferent before, does now derive a necessity from that
reason of State and interest upon which it is imposition is founded.

To be sure men of common sense and understanding, if they have but common
honesty joined together with it, will take their measures of obligation as to
the lawfulness or unlawfulness of what is commanded, from it is design and
tendency to promote or obstruct the interest of the Public, and the happiness
of particular Persons; and if either the pretended or the real Scruples of any
might be sufficient to stop the course of Law against the common interest,
there could be no such thing as Order or Government in the World.

There are many Laws enacted by the sublime Wisdom of the King and his three
Estates in Parliament assembled, which though they be for the interest of the
whole Kingdom, all things considered; yet they manifestly tend to the
Prejudice of particular persons, but yet those very persons are as much obliged
by these Laws, as they who reap the benefit and advantage of them, because the
obligation of these Laws is to be taken from the fundamental Constitution of
all Societies, that a greater Interest be preferred before a less, and that
when the public advantage shall interfere with a private, the private must
give place, because otherwise the Society cannot be preserved; how much more
strictly therefore are we obliged by those Laws whose design and tendency being
nothing else, but to keep us all at unity and peace together, are so plainly
for the advantage of the Public and of every particular Person?

And if notwithstanding the manifest Conducibleness of such an Uniform way of
Worship to the public Peace, and the experience of those sad Effects which
our Religious Differences have produced, every private man shall yet after this
take upon him to Judge of the Reasonableness or Expedience of what is Enacted
by his Superiors, and shall from thence proceed upon I know not what
Pretenses, ridiculous in themselves and destructive of the public Welfare,
to withdraw his Obedience to their just Commands; he may as well take upon him
an insinite and boundless liberty of questioning the Reasonableness and Equity
of all Laws whatsoever, and either upon the same or more warrantable
Exceptions, for the expedience of no Law can be more evident than of that which
enjoins Uniformity in Divine Worship, he may withdraw his Obedience from all
kind of Government and Subjection whatsoever.

But here it is Objected, That if there were nothing but the Civil Interest, or
the Interest of this World to be considered, the experience of all Ages and
Nations will sufficiently demonstrate, that an Uniformity in Religious matters,
is the best Expedient that can be thought of to secure the public Peace. But
alas! we carry souls and Consciences about us, and these are precious things;
there is an immortal Interest lies at stake, which it would be great folly and
madness to part with upon any temporal consideration.

But to this I answer first in the general, That the main design of
Christianity being to promote Peace and Charity in this world, as well as to
procure us Eternal peace and happiness in the next; and indeed the one in order
to the other, it follows plainly that Uniformity in Religious Worship, as being
a necessary means to Peace, is in the general of Divine Institution, though
what the particular terms of that Uniformity shall be, the Scripture has no
where prescribed; as in truth it could not do, for a reason which I shall show
hereafter: it remains therefore, that the Church it self be in all Ages
furnished with a right and power of prescribing what those terms shall be, and
that all her members are obliged to a necessary Observance of them.

But here, because I have made so frequent mention of the Church, that I may
avoid Ambiguity, and leave as little room as may be for Exception, before I go
any further, I will explain what I mean by that term, and without descending to
too much nicety, the Church is one of these three things.

First, it is the congregation of Christian People dispersed over the whole
earth, and agreeing together in the fundamental Articles of the Christian
Faith, which are either expressly, or by direct and lawful consequence,
revealed in the Scriptures of the New Testament, to be of necessity to
Salvation. And in this sense it is not only unnecessary that there should be
every where the same Rites and Ceremonies observed in the Church, but it is in
the nature of the thing impossible that there should, because of necessity the
several manners, customs, and other circumstances of several Nations, will
introduce a diversity of external Formalitie into Religious Worship, which may
be done without any breach of Charity or Friendship among men, because there is
no interest to be served by promoting Feuds and Animosities between them; and
it will be all one to the peace and happiness of this Kingdom, what rites or
usages soever the Greek or Armenian Churches shall embrace.

We do not much trouble our heads, though by reason of their near Neighborhood
we have some reason to do it, about the French saying Mass, or adoring
Relics, or Images, or praying for Dead, or worshipping the Host: Nay, you
shall hardly ever see a man in a passion when he hears the Tragical stories of
those horrible persecutions against the professors of the Reformed Religion;
but though he may relieve and pity them, so far as a small temporary
Contribution will go, yet in truth and reality he is not much concerned;
whereas at home we can make a shift to fall out about much smaller matters; the
reason is, because we are not embarked in the same bottom with them, and so
being able to do neither good nor hurt by being angry or displeased, we scarce
ever trouble our selves. But at home the pretenses of Religion and Liberty,
which are always stirring when ever there is any prospect of public Disorders
likely to ensue upon them, will never fail to excite the ambitious, the
discontented, and the needy, to embroyle the State out of principles either of
Interest or Revenge, while the passions of men that daily converse together,
and are engaged by interest, or prejudice, or duty in the respective parties,
do but serve to blow the cole, and improve the sparks of Animosity into a flame
of War.

The consequence of all which is, That there may be differences in the
universal Church, consisting of many Kingdoms and Provinces without
dissension; and that all that whatever it is, which is requisite to the unity
of the Spirit in the bond of Peace, may be consistent enough with differences
in smaller matters, but that in the same Kingdom or Dominion this can never be.

But secondly, By the Church we may understand a National Congregation of
Christian People, divided into many partitions or particular assemblies united
together by an unity of Faith, and Discipline, and Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction; and this is that which I affirm to be necessary in every Kingdom
or State that would avoid all occasions of public Tumults and Disorders, and
would be as happy either as themselves can wish, or as Christianity designs to
make them.

And therefore this is that unity which is by every Good Christian, good
Citizen, or good Subject, above all things which this world can afford, the
most earnestly to be desired: for the obtaining of which, he is to submit to
every thing that shall be required of him, and he is to abstain from every
thing which is forbidden him; if all things considered, it may lawfully be done
or avoided.

Thirdly, In compliance with those of the Congregationall way, I am content to
allow a third sense of the word Church to be a particular and independent
Congregation governed by Laws and measures of its own, and acknowledging no
Jurisdiction Foreign to it self; and this is a Form of Church Government,
which in a Christian Kingdom or Commonwealth, I affirm to be naturally
unlawful: And here there are two cases to be considered.

First, Either the whole body of the People is divided into such particular and
independent Congregations, or there is a national Establishment from which
these particular Congregations have separated themselves. The first of these is
Babel in Effigy, the very Emblem and Landscape of Confusion, subject to
inconveniences that cannot be thought of till they are felt, and capable of
such infinite sub-divisions as will at length reduce the comely Form of
Government by so many particular interests and factions into a State of public
Hostility and Rapine; for the reason why men separate from one another, is
always out of some real or some pretended dislike, which dislikes by actual
separation, are so far from being composed, that they are manifestly improved
and heightened by it; and from hence arise so many several Interests as there
are Sects or denominations of Parties in a Commonwealth.

For it is natural to all men to desire to gain Proselytes to their own
Opinion, for men to love themselves and those of their own way, and to think of
other men, who are not enrolled in the same list with themselves, if not with a
real hatred, yet with a less esteem and a comparative Aversation, which
whenever a Ball of Interest is thrown between them, will be improved into all
the sad effects of the most desperate Malice and Revenge.

But here to make all sure as I go along, I must repeat again, That by
Ind^^endent Congregations, I mean, such as own no Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction
external to themselves; from whence it is easy to perceive that every such
Congregation may be a new Sect and Party by it self; as it was in a manner in
the late Times, when the Sects were spawned in such increadible abundance, that
the Alphabet began to complain of want of Letters to furnish so many different
and disagreeing Parties with names.

Neither is it to be supposed that so many several Factions, notwithstanding
their differences in matters of Religion, shall yet conspire in an uniform
Obedience to the Civil Power, because to be uppermost is that which they all
desire; and since the very same persons are members of the Commonwealth, and of
a particular Sect or Party, it is ridiculous to hope that the State can ever be
quiet, till all these parties can agree together to be of the same mind; which
is, to make them cease to be what they are.

In the United Provinces, where the greatest Liberty is given and taken of any
other Territory in the Christian World, the peace of the public could not be
secured, if it were not for the Overballance of the Calvi^isticall Party above
the rest; for the Calvinists, as Sir Willian Temple in his Observations upon
the United Provinces takes notice, p. 204. "make up the body of the People, and
are possessed of all the public Churches in the Dominions of the State as well
as of the only Ministers or Pastors, who are maintained by the public, who
have no other Salaries than what they receive from the State, upon whom they
wholly depend; and for that reason they will be sure to preach obedience and
submission to the People.

But yet notwithstanding this, so great has the power and interest of the
Louvestane or Arminian Party always been, that it has been the occasion of
great revolutions among them; and as it was probably one of the main causes of
their so sudden fall from the height of envy into the lowest region of pity and
despair within the compass of a very few years, so it is to be feared that in
not many more (the animosities between a Calvinist and whoever differs from him
being irreconcilable and everlasting) it will pr^ve the ruin of that once
powerful, but now declining State.

Neither was there any thing in the late unhappy times, next to the Title of an
incomparable Prince, to whom the Scepter of these Kingdoms did of right belong,
and the Affections of a loyal Party, which all the republican Cruelties were
not able to extinguish, that contributed so much to put a period to the
Usurpation, which was never established upon any certain bottom, as the
bandying of the several Factions against one another; which made it both
necessary for the Usurpers to support their power by the Sword, and that Sword
it self not being all of it of the same metal, and the Army that was to wield
it, being it self cantoned into Sects and Factions, they began at length not to
understand one another language, but were forced to leave working any longer,
and to desist from building that Babel of Religion, cemented with blood instead
of mortar, which is inconsistent with the quiet of the Earth, and by which men
in vain expect to climb to Heaven.

It is a prodigious thing for a man to consider what irreconcilable feuds the
smallest differences in Religion have created, and still the smaller those
differences are, the higher usually are those animosities that are produced by
them, as if it were the nature and genius of mankind to make up in passion what
they want in reason; as the Turks and Persians, though agreeing in all other
parts of the Ma^ometan Superstition, yet about a very small Punctilio they are
at mortal jars with one another; and, being so near neighbors as they are,
they never want an opportunity of expressing their resentments by the frequent
and bloody Wars betwixt those two formidable Empires.

The Calvinists pursue the Lutherans and Arminians, who on their own parts are
not wanting to retaliate the kindness, with every whit as great if not greater
hatred than those who do toto coelo errare, the Popish, I mean, the Mohammedan
and the Pagan World; nay, so apt are men to fall out with one another, that the
most inconsiderable niceties of difference that can be conceived, when they are
used as marks of distinction, when men shall obstinately persist in such
discriminations, and when they shall place an opinion or affectation in them,
will produce in them a dislike and aversation for one another; and, let the
difference be never so small, yet it will always be true to the World's end
that, Birds of a feather will flock together; so many distinctions as there
are, bating those distinctions which Trade and Functions and the Necessities of
humane life have made for the mutual support and maintenance of each other, so
many several Parties and Factions you shall have in that Commonwealth or
Kingdom where those distinctions are found.

Though in this case it will always happen, that the smaller Fishes will
associate and unite together against the Leviathan or prevailing Party, that
overballances the rest, but when that King of the Waters is destroyed, they
will then begin to prey upon one another, and contend which of them shall
ingross the Dominion of the Seas, which is the case of all the Republican
Factions against the Church of England at this day; though as well reason as
former sad experience may instruct us, when they have obtained their end, if
ever they do obtain it, which God forbid, what miserable work they will make of
it among themselves.

It is to be confessed indeed that there are abroad very great heats and
contentions to be found, which are not of such dangerous consequence to the
public Peace, such as are those feuds, which will never be extinguished,
betwixt the Seculars and the Regulars, and betwixt the regular Fraternities
with one another; and, I believe, there are but very few monastic Societies
will be found that are at peace within themselves; of which, and of the causes
of it, which I have well considered, I could say more, if it would not be a
digression; but whether it be that common obedience which they pay their Holy
Father the Pope, which keeps them in somewhat better order, or, that being men
of a single life, not encumbred with any secular interest or concern, their
animosities cannot so easily embroile the State as those who have a greater
interest in it, and who may with a better countenance pursue secular designs
than they can do; or, whether it be that the Laiety think it not worth their
while, any further than it is matter of common entertainment and discourse, to
take any part in the quarrels of Beadesmen and of Beggars; or whether it be
that their contentions are not of such a popular nature as to have an influence
upon any but themselves who make them; or that the perpetual austerities of
their respective rules, which are a constant emploiment to them, hinder them
from being capable of prosecuting any dangerous design, with that address and
diligence which is requisite to its success; or that all the heat of these
contentions is spent, by men that know better how to use their tongues than
swords, in complaints to the Pope, and in writing against and censuring one
another; or, lastly, whether it be that their way of life in the retirement of
their cloisters, and in the little formalitie of their cells, and convents
renders them unexperienced in affairs, listless and unactive in business, and
unfit to do any great good or mischief in the World; or whatever the true
reason be, there is no question but they are found by long experience, by
giving an example of poverty and contentment, and by the reputation of their
sanctity and holiness of life to be rather an advantage than detriment to the
places where they are suffered, and they make sufficient amends for their
intestine divisions, by their being united together in the Papal Interest and
in the support of the Romish Tyranny over the Consciences of men.

But let the reason be what it will, it is certain that no reason can justify
the lawfullness of separate and independent Congregations in a Christian
Commonwealth or Kingdom, which are in their own nature, and have been found so
by experience, to be so destructive to the welfare and happiness of the World,
which are so big with inconveniences not to be foreseen till they are felt,
which are surrounded on every side with infinite and unspeakable dangers, to
which no possible remedy can be applied, but by the removal of their necessary
cause, and by destroying the Independencie it self, that I make no scruple to
pronounce it as a self-evident Maxim, that an aggregate of separate and
disunited Congregations, unaccountable to one another or to any superior
temporal Head invested with a power of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction and Censure,
is contrary to the Law of Nature, destructive of the Peace of the World, and of
the design of Christianity it self, which is to engage men in closer
obligations of unity and friendship with one another, and therefore ought not
to be tolerated in a Christian State no more than Atheism or Infidelity
themselves; it being the extremity of Nonsense and religious Folly to allow
that Charity, Good Will and Peace are the indispensable duties of a Christian;
nay, the characteristick indications of his being Christ's Disciple; that God
is Love, and that whosoever loves not his brother whom he has seen, cannot
possibly love God whom be has not seen; and yet, that that Form of Church
Government is, I will not say of divine Institution, but of divine Permission,
which is in its very nature and essential constitution so exactly fitted to
bring the World into Confusion and Disorder.

And so I have done with the first Case, which supposes the whole Body of a
People to be parcell'd out into many distinct and independent Congregations.
Give me leave now to speak a very little to the second, which presumes only a
Separation of one or more Congregations from the Body of the National Church,
setting up a new Authority of its own, and disowning the Jurisdiction of the
public: which second Case differs only in proportion from the first, and will
of necessity labor with all those ill consequences in its degree and measure
with which the first is encumbered; and, it being much easier for small things
to increase than to begin, the consequences at the long run will be exactly the
same, if the Government, by a wise temperament of Care and Courage, do not put
a timely stop to the progress of such ill boding beginnings.

Into such separate Assemblies as these all the ill humor^ of the Body politic
will naturally flow, thither the unfortunate, the discontented, the covetous
and the ambitious will betake themselves, to seek revenge against real or
imaginary wrongs, to repair the decaies and ruins of a broken fortune, to
satisfy the craving circumstances of poverty and want, and to fill up the wide
capacity of immodest, unreasonable and unjust desires at the expense of the
public welfare, security and quiet.

Neither are such Conventicles as these dangerous only to the Civil Peace, by
being the natural causes of embroilment and disturbance, the very sinks and
commonshores into which all bad humors disembogue themselves and find a welcome
entertainment, while the simplicity of some suffers it self, under the specious
pretenses of an extraordinary zeal, to be misled and carried away captive by
the designing Hypocrisy of others; but, which is still worse, they have a no
less pleasing aspect upon Religion it self, which either by the infinite
pretenses to greater purity, a most absurd and foolish cause of Separation,
which knows no Law, and will admit no bounds, they refine so long till they
have utterly lost it; or by a most impious and unreasonable claim to I know not
what Gospel Liberty, they get at last to be Libertines indeed, and are placed
as far above the reach of Ordinances as those Ordinances themselves, by their
design and use for the preservation of Love and Unity in the Church, by their
Divine institution and appointment, and by the supernatural Grace which is
exhibited and conveyed by a due and worthy participation of them, are placed
above the blasphemous contempt of such profane and dissolute W^etches.

But I would by no means be so far misunderstood, as if I were so uncharitable
as to think that all, or so much as the greatest part of those that separate,
do it out of any bad design; for I am not only morally certain of the
contrary, as to the much greater number of the People, but as to the Pastors
themselves, if that be any credit for them; I dare be confident, in very many
instances, that the blind lead the blind, and that they are not sensible of
those dismal inconveniences to which their Separation is naturally exposed; but
in what I have just now said I chiefly reflect upon the sad experience of
former times, which is sufficient to convince us, what the genuine tendencie of
these new models is; and I do no more question that the same causes, if
suffered to operate with the same freedom, will have the same effect, than I
do, whether humane nature and humane passions be the same now that they were
twenty or thirty years ago; which Consideration if all well-meaning, but
misguided Christians would seriously lay to heart, I cannot doubt but it would
soon have a very wonderful effect upon the Peace and Settlement of these
distracted Kingdoms, by persuading all that heartily wish the Prosperity of
Sion and pray for the Peace of this our spiritual Jerusalem, to leave their
separate Assemblies, and betake themselves into the bosom of the Church, which
cannot behold so much goodness and sincerity so miserably misled and gone astray
without all the concern that is natural to a distressed, forsaken Mother, and
stands always ready with her arms wide open, and with an entreating voice and
mind to receive them into her most tender and passionate embraces.

Some sort of Unity as to external Discipline is necessary to the consistence
even of those lesser bodies; nay, the Quakers themselves who are much the most
exorbitant of all Parties to be found among us, yet they differ from others,
and agree with one another in nothing more than in a certain Formality peculiar
to themselves: And how much more desirable would it be, that all Parties,
laying aside their respective heats and animosities which under such diversity
of outward forms they so dangerously foment and carry on against each other,
should unite together under one common rule in such a blessed band of Peace and
Love, as would remove all our Jealousies, and prevent all our Fears, and make
every man in the Streets in an unknown Face, to meet his Guide, his Companion,
and his own familiar Friend?

This is my first Answer to the Objection taken from the pretense of a Tender
Conscience, That an Uniformity of one sort or other, is of absolute necessity
to the peace of the Church; which Uniformity since it cannot be obtained,
unless men could all jump into the same mind of themselves, and continue in it
when they had done, it follows unavoidably that there is, and must always be in
the Church a standing Authority, from whence the Sanctions of Discipline and
Order shall receive their obligation.

I come now to give a more particular Answer to the Objection proposed, and in
that, I shall consider in the general what the terms of this Uniformity must
be, or rather what kind of terms they are to which all Christian People are
obliged to submit.

It must be granted therefore, That though an Uniformity in Religious Worship
be that which is above all things in this World the most passionately to be
desired, yet this being only in order to that great End, to which all our
endeavors and counsels ought to be directed, the Eternal happiness and
salvation of our Souls; no terms of Uniformity ought to be submitted to which
are inconsistent with Salvation. And that Church, whatever she is, let her
pretenses to Infallibility and Truth, be never so great, which imposes those
either Opinions or Practices, as the terms of Communion, which are directly
contrary to the word of God, or to the light of Nature and the impartial
dictates of right Reason is by no means to be communicated with any longer; but
we must immediately come out from Her and separate in our own desence, lest we
be made partakers of Her sins and of Her plagues; and in this case it is she
who is guilty of the Schism by necessitating a Separation, not we who separate
when we cannot avoid it.

As to matter of Doctrine, I presume there is no man who calls himself a
Protestant, of what Denomination or Party soever he be, who will charge our
Church with any damnable Error; but on the contrary, there are many of our
Dissenting Brethren, who, when they are taxed with the unpleasant imputation of
propagating very absurd and very unreasonable Opinions, are used to take
Sanctuary in the Articles of the Church of England; of whose Authority, as to
some points, they will pretend themselves to be the only Assertors, with what
Justice, I think I have in part discovered in some other Papers.

As to Ceremonies there are three Restrictions chiefly to be considered, which
if they be all carefully observed in the discipline of any Church, there is no
manner of pretense or ground for Separation upon a Ceremonial account; and
those three Restrictions are these which follow. First, They must not be too
cumbersome and heavy by their number. Secondly, They must not be Superstitious
in their use. Thirdly, They must not be Idolatrous in their direction.

First, They must not be too cumbersome and heavy by their number, for this is
that which eats out the very heart and root of Religion, and takes it off from
being a Devotional exercise of the mind, by turning it into outward Pomp and
Show, which can neither make us better men for the future, nor appease the
wrath of God, or apply to us the merit and satisfaction of Christ for what is
past.

This was that of which St. Austin in his time complained; but yet he did not
think it Lawful to make any breach or distrubance in the Church upon this
account, but rather to take this occasion for the exercise of those two
excellent virtues of Patience and Humility, and expect the good time when this
burden should be removed by the same regular Authority that had imposed it.

This was the case of the Mosaic Bondage, especially as that Bondage was
afterward increased by the Pharisical (...), or by the traditionary Rites and
Usages of the Jewish Church; and this is at this day, and was at the time of
the Reformation, and for many Ages before, the case of the Roman Yoke; from
which the Wisdom and Piety of our Ancestors, has with no less Justice than
Necessity freed us, and placed us in that state of Christian Liberty, which
does not consist of such an exemption from all Ceremonies as some men seem to
desire; which is absurd and impossible in the nature of the thing it self, but
in the choice of such as are best fitted to the ends for which all Ceremonies
ought to be designed, and have the greatest tendency to Edification.

There were other causes upon account of the Ceremonies imposed by the Church
of Rome, which might be sufficient to justify a Separation, of which I shall
speak in the two following Heads.

And though a National or Provincial Church have a Right and Power within it
self of retrenching the supersluities of the Ceremonial part of their Divine
Service, which may very well be done without any Schism or Separation from the
body of the Church abroad, either on the one part or the other: Yet for private
men to separate from the National Establishment, upon pretense that the
Ceremonies are too burdensome or too many, is manifestly unlawful. The reason
is, because this will be liable to the same Inconveniences, to which a
separation upon pretense of greater Purity, is exposed; and in both cases, if
every private man shall be allowed to judge for himself, and to proceed to a
Separation in pursuance of that judgment, so infinite are the humors, the
sancies, the prejudices, the perversities of some men; so fond are they of
Novelty and Change, so apt to control Authority, and so desirous to be
governed only by their own Measures, that there can be no lasting Establishment
in the World, but the Discipline of the Church will be always reeling like a
Drunken Man, and driven to and fro like a Wave of the Sea, by every Capricious
wind of Innovation.

We will suppose for the present, in favor of the Dissenters, because they
cannot prove it, that there are too many Ceremonies in our Church, yet I
presume it will be granted that there are not above four or five, or half a
dozen too many; or if you will, to make it a plump number, and to put the
Objection into better shape, let them be half a score, which I believe upon an
exact computation, will go a great way in the Ceremonies of the Church of
England; and let all these be imposed as indispensable conditions of Communion:
It Is pretty severe I confess, to lay so great a stress upon Indifferent
Matters; but yet certainly no man in his wits will ever pretend that this is
such an intolerable burden, as that he must needs separate rather than
comply; but if there be any that are so hardy to do it, though I will not
discommend them for their courage, a virtue, of which in this contentious Age
we have a great deal of need; yet in my opinion they deserve rather to be
soundly Laughed at, than seriously Confuted.

What has been said of the Churches Power in retrenching the number of her
Ceremonies, the same is likewise true as to the Ceremonies themselves, that
they may from time to time be altered and changed for others in their stead by
the Authority of the Church, as shall seem most Expedient to that public
Wisdom for the great Purpose of Edification; but for every private person to
challenge this Right to himself, is unlawful, because liable to the same
inconveniences, with separating under color of Ceremonious Superfluities, or
of purer Ordinances and purer Ordinances and purer Worship, which are therefore
justly to be suspected to proceed out of a bad design, because they never can
have any end.

Saint Paul, in several places of his Epistles, expresses great tenderness for
the infirmity of the weak Brother, but yet, if the Instances of such his
condescension be examined, they will be sound to be of a quite different nature
from those which make up the pretenses of our days, as consisting, first, in
the eating of things sacrificed to Idols, which as looking like a participation
of the table of Devils, and as being expressly prohibited by a temporary Canon
of the Council of Jerusalem, must needs give very great offense and scandal to
the Christians of those days, who did not understand so well as Saint Paul did
that an Idol was nothing, and that the consideration of the Food might well
enough be prescinded from that of the Idol, and that therefore it was lawful
for one who was well grounded in the reason of things and might do it without
offense to any weaker than himself, to eat whatever was sold in the shambles.

From which last cited place of St. Paul we may observe a threefold difference
in the practice of those times as to this Affair. First, There were some, and
they the most perfect Christians, in which number St. Paul himself was, who
would make no scruple of eating the Idolathyta, though they knew them to be
such, so they might do it without scandal to others. Secondly, There were
others who could not justify to themselves the eating of such food; but yet,
by Saint Paul's permission, they would not be at the pains of a solicitous
enquiry, but suffering themselves to remain in ignorance would eat whatsoever
was sold in the shambles, asking no question for conscience sake. Lastly, There
were a third sort, more scrupulous than either of the former, who thought
themselves bound not to eat any manner of meat but what they were sure had not
been sacrificed to Idols, and it is to these especially that Saint Paul's
condescension is with abundance of equity and justice made, because their
scruple was founded not in a Circumstance or Ceremony only, but in a deep
sense of Devotion, and in a jealousy for the Honor of God and Religion.

The second Instance of this Tenderness of St. Paul's is taken from the Jewish
Abstinence from things strangled and from blood, which was not only strictly
enjoined by the Ceremonial law, but also continued and confirmed by the same
temporary Edict of the Jerusalem Synod; and what has been said of Abstaining
from Blood, the same was true likewise of Circumcision, which in some cases was
dispensed with even after Conversion to Christianity; this was the reason why
Paul circumcised Timothy, because of the Jews in the 16th. of the Acts, and it
is his advice in the first to the Corinthians, c. 7. v. 18. Is any man called
being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised: is any called in
uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. And then it follows, For
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the
Commandments of God.

What is meant in this place by becoming uncircumcised is needless to my
purpose at present to examine and scarce consistent with Modesty to explain.

But that which is more pertinent to my design at present to take notice of is
this, that in both these instances of abstaining from Blood and of
Circumcision, the case is far different from the scruples of our days; since
it was not the squeamish aversation of a Ceremony, but an obstinate adherence
to the Ceremonial Law on which those scruples were founded, with which
notwithstanding Saint Paul, as it were on purpose to show how little an enemy
he was to Ceremonies was pleased for the time to dispense, although the
retaining of those two Ceremonies in the Church, pursued into those
consequencies of which they were not sensible, did in reality include in it a
Denial of Christ and his Gospel.

For Circumcision, what was it but the Seal of that particular Covenant which
God had entered into with Abraham and his Posterity? whereas now that enclosure
was laid open and that partition wall was broken down; the renting of the vail
in sunder at the instant of our Savior's Passion was to signify the final
abolition, antiquation and repealment of the Abrahamitical Covenant and Mosaic
Law, the Holy of Holies was at that instant laid open, whereinto not only the
High priest with Sacrifices once a year, but all mankind by virtue of that
great propitiatory Sacrifice which was at that time offered up upon the Cross,
without any other Sacrifice of their own than that of a broken spirit and a
contrite heart might enter and be happy; and there was now ratified a New and
better Covenant, established upon better Promises, whereinto not the Jews
only, but all men that would accept of the conditions of the Gospel, of what
sort or quality or Nation soever they were, whether Jew or Gentile, bond or
free, Greek or Barbarian, had a free and welcome admittance; and it was in this
sense only that the Promise was literally fulfilled to Abraham that his seed
should be as the stars of heaven, and as the sands of the sea shore for number;
that is, not the carnal, but the spiritual seed, which was much larger than the
other; Romans 9. 6, 7, 8. For they are not all Israel which are of Israel:
Neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children, but in
Isaac shall thy seed be called: That is, They which are the children of the
flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are
counted for the seed: And again, Gal. 3. 29. If ye be Christ's, then are ye
Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.

The Abstinence from Blood, though it be not so much a Jewish Institution, but
was as old as the Creation it self, and continued all along in force till our
Savior's time; yet then its obligation, together with its reason, was to
cease, the reason given in the Law, which was the same before it, being this;
that God had given it upon the Altar, to be an atonement for the souls of men:
it is manifest therefore, that when the Sacrifice and the Oblation ceased, as
they actually did upon the suffering of the Messiah, as to their efficacy and
virtue, and as the Prophet Daniel had long before expressly prophesied it should
do; I say, when the Sacrifices were no longer allowed in which this legal
Abstinence was founded, it is plain the Obligation to the Abstinence it self
must cease together with it, because, sublata causa tollitur effectus: that
Cause upon which Abstinence was enjoined being now finally antiquated and
abolished, the Effect that Cause, which was this Abstinence from Blood, must of
necessity be supposed to be abrogated likewise.

But yet, I know not how it came to pass, not only the converted Jews in the
Apostolical times, but the primitive Christians for many Ages together did
generally abstain from Blood, and this Abstinence has not wanted very learned
Assertors even in our days, Curcelleus has written a particular Diatriba or
Dissertation, De esu sanguinis, wherein he defends this practice, with what
success I leave others to determine, when they shall have considered what I have
here said; to which I will now add, to strengthen the Demonstration, that that
Text of Saint Paul's which I have already cited, whatsoever is sold in the
shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake, may as well refer,
and does as necessarily do so, to a permission of Eating the (...), which we
Translate, things Strangled, and to the Repealment of the prohibition of Blood;
as to the Idolothyta, or things Offered up in Sacrifice upon the Table of
Idols. For they could not eat whatsoever was sold in the Shambles, without
eating many times such meat as was not killed with that exquisite Accuracy for
the draining of the Blood which was peculiar to the Jews, and derived
afterward to the Christians from them.

A particular Instance of this exceeding Care and Solicitude of theirs, we
have 1 Samuel 14. v. 32. And the people flew upon the Spoil, and took Sheep and
Oxen and Calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with
the blood; that is, lying upon the ground the Blood could not so easily be
drained out of the Orifice that was made; and besides, the Blood flowing about
them, polluted and the ground where they lay, and defiled the Skins of the
Beasts that were killed, which put the whole Animal in a state of Levitical
Uncleanness; and that which made the touching of Blood to contract a
Defilement, was this, that by the Levitical Sanctions, the Blood was of an
Expiatory nature, and was always Offered up by the express Command of God
before the door of the Tabernacle, as long as the Israelites sojourned in the
Wilderness; and so being spilt by way of Expiation, it was supposed to be
Defiled with the Guilt of the Owner and his Family, who were afterward to
partake of the Flesh, and therefore was Unclean, as all Expiatory Sacrifices
were; as is manifest, not only from the reason of the thing, Expiation being a
Translation of Guilt, and Guilt the cause of Uncleanness, but also from the
Rites of the Sin, and the Trespass Offering; which in some cases were by reason
of their uncleanness to be burnt without the Camp, and the Skins of these
Sacrifices did not belong to the Priest as in some other cases, because they
were unclean.

Now though it is true that after the Children of Israel were settled in the
Land of Canaan, this Custom of bringing all Animals to be slain at the door of
the Tabernacle, was omitted, and indeed was utterly Impracticable by reason of
the great distance of many parts of Judea from the Temple and Tabernacle; yet
notwithstanding, God did not by this lose that Right which he had appropriated
to himself in the Blood, but it was in the nature of a tacit or supposed
Sacrifice in behalf of the Owner, and those that partook with him of the Flesh,
though it were not sprinkled by the Priest before the Lord, as the Law of
Moses, if by reason of Distance it had not been impossible, would have required.

By this it appears how the Beasts that were killed in this place of Samuel,
came to be defiled, and unlawful to be eaten.

Let us now see which was the thing I first intended, what care was taken by
Saul for the redress of this neglect, or at least to make some amends for it,
v. 33, 34. Then they told Saul, saying, Behold the people sin against the Lord
in that they eat with the blood. And he said, ye have transgressed, roll a
great stone unto me this day. And Saul said, disperse your selves among the
people, and say unto them, bring me hither every man his Ox, and every man his
Sheep, and slay them here, and sin not against the Lord in eating with the
Blood: And all the people brought every man his Ox with him that night, and
slew them there. Nay, it is probable that the Blood was also sprinkled from the
hands of the Priests; for it follows in the next Verse. And Saul built an Altar
unto the Lord, the same was the first Altar that he built unto the Lord.

Now the reason of that Command of his, of rouling a Stone to the place where
the Beasts were to be killed, was this, That they were to be laid athwart it
with their N^^ks hanging down, that so the blood might flow with the greater
freedom out of the Orifice which was made; and might fall upon the ground
without defiling the Bodies of the Animals themselves; as I have already taken
notice in another Discourse upon a very different Occasion from this, and in
another Language.

The Jews continue Obstinate to this day in a Religious abstinence from Blood,
notwithstanding their Temple be demolished, and they do not so much as pretend
to any thing of Sacrifice till it be rebuilt; and I know a Learned Jew, with
whom I had for some years a particular acquaintance, who was so scrupulous in
this point, that he would never eat any kind of Flesh which he had not killed
himself.

But before I pass any further, I will take notice of one cause of Saint Paul's
Condescension, as to the business of Abstinence from Blood, which I did not
think of before. And that is, That besides what I have said of its Levitical
Pollution, which it seems they that were the Patrons of this Opinion, did not
apprehend to be abolished by the fulfilling of all those legal Sacrifices in
and by the Sacrifice of Christ; they considered further, that God having
appropriated the Blood to himself; which Property and Right of his they did not
conceive him ever to have relinquisht, they looked upon it as a kind of
Sacrilege to seed upon Blood; and therefore abstained from it upon the same
Pious principle, upon which they would have abstained from Robbing of Hospitals
or Colleges, or from Pilfering the Ornaments of Churches, and seizing the
Revenues of the Ecclesiastical State; a sort of Piety so necessary to the
honor of God, and to the prosperity and happiness of the Church, that it ought
by no means to be discouraged, though in a mistaken Instance; much more if
Saint Paul himself foresaw, which we cannot tell but he might, that
Sacrilegious humor of the Saints which our times have experienced, when the
Church was swallowed up at one Morsel, and the Kingdom at another; when all
that was Sacred and Devoted to the service of Almighty God, was converted to
profane uses by Thieves and Robbers in the disguise of Saints; with as little
reason as that for which Dionysius of Syracuse divested Apollo of his Golden
Ornaments, upon Pretense that they were too heavy and too hot for Summer, and
that in Winter they would not keep him warm.

We see therefore that it was not a bare Infirmity without any color or
pretext of Reason that was dispensed with in these cases; for such
Dispensations if they be once allowed, there can be no end but Confusion and
the utter Subversion of all manner of Government and Order. We see upon what
reasons and prejudices these Scruples were founded, and how necessary it was at
that time to Comply with them: We see likewise that they were not matters of
small Weight and Moment, they were not things looked upon on both sides to be
of an indifferent nture, they were not Controversiae de Nugis Siculis and
Gerris Germanis, de foliis Farfari aut Noevill Butubatis, de umbra Asini, aut
de lana Caprina, they were not matters of mere Ceremony and Show, matters of
External Discipline and Form, that exercised the tenderness and infirmity of
those times. Those Babes in Christ that were but newly initiated into the
Christian Faith, and had as yet tasted only the sincere milk of the Word,
without adventuring upon stronger meats, were yet better fed and better taught,
than to quarrel about Indifferent Matters, or to Control their Governors in
things of Publique-Decency and Order. But the instances of their Scrupulosity,
were founded in such things as they looked upon to be in themselves Offenses of
the highest nature against the express Commands of God, against the honor of
his Name, against the entire and incommunicable respect which is due from all
Creatures both in Heaven and Earth to his Adorable Majesty and Greatness, and
against the indispensable duties of natural Reason and Religion; in which
though they were never so much mistaken, yet these were Scruples not of small
Concernment, but of the highest Consequence and Importance; and St. Paul did
therefore comply with the Infirmity and with the mistakes of those Good Men,
not barely to gratify a squeemish Fancy, which is out of love with things for
no reason and without any end; but lest by opposing Prejudices so deeply rooted
in matters of so extraordinary a nature as these were, they might be tempted to
an Apostasy from the Christian Faith, which did impose burdens upon them which
their Consciences, not ^eing yet sufficiently informed of the true extent of
that liberty which Christ had purchased for them, could not possibly bear; for
this reason, it was Saint Paul's rule to become all things to all men, that he
might save the more; and he despensed with them in some cases out of mere
necessity, that his Brother, for whom Christ dyed, might not be destroyed, by
Relapsing to Judaism on the one hand, or Idolatry on the other: As our Learned
Mr. Thorndike, and out of him the Accurate and Industrious Doctor Falkner, have
observed. And this latter case of Idolatry was therefore the more tenderly to
be regarded, because the Author to the Hebrews speaking of this very business,
tells us, c. 6. v. 4, 5, 6. It is impossible for those who were once
enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly Gift, and were made partakers of
the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
World to come, if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance,
seeing they Crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open
shame. And St. John in his first Epistle c. 5. v. 16. tells us there is a sin
unto death: I do not say that he, that is our Brother, shall pray for it; that
is, there is great danger that his Prayers will never be heard in behalf of
such a person; and what that Sin is he afterward explains v. 21. Little
Children keep your selves from Idols. And this is likewise very suitable to the
practice of the Church in the Primitive times, who upon any such Relapse to
Idolatry, were not used to receive the Apostate, though giving all imaginable
demonstrations of Repentance, into the bosom of that Church, which he had
forsaken, by Sacramental Absolution, sometimes at the very instant of Death,
and sometimes not till then; as is manifest from the case of Serapio, and
others.

However, since Peace is the thing above all others, the most to be prized and
valued, and with the greatest passion and earnestness to be desired; since no
kind of discipline or external Form is any further necessary or so much as
lawful than it shall be found to Contribute to this blessed end, since Rites
and Ceremonies established in the Church, are in themselves of a changeable
nature, and since our Church her self has openly and expressly declared, that
she is no longer desirous to retain all or any of them than they shall be found
expedient for Edification; I should not be against closing with any
Proposition, let it be almost what it will, by which a lasting Peace and
Settlement might be obtained.

And because I think there are but three ways to be thought of in order to this
end. The first of which is a Toleration of those that differ from us in their
several differences and distinctions. The second, an Alteration of those
Customs and Usages which are excepted against for others in their stead. And
the third, an Abatement or Abolition of those Ceremonies which are scrupled
without any Reparation by the Substitution of others in their room: Therefore I
shall speak very briesly to each of these particulars.

And first, A Toleration as it is commonly understood, is a Liberty from the
Government for every man to say and do as he pleases in Religious matters for
Conscience sake; or upon account of a tender Conscience which cannot submit it
self to the public Rule; and such a Toleration as this is, I affirm to be
directly and positively unlawful, because it cuts the sinews of Government in
pieces, and lets the Rains loose to all manner of misrule and disorder: For the
truth of which I need only appeal to the Experience of former times, when by
such an unbounded Toleration, the Kingdom was put into such a floating and
uncertain Posture, that we had almost as many alterations in Government, as
there were Sects and Parties that were to obey.

The Presbyterians, when time was, having shaken off the Episcopal Yoke, as
they were pleased, if not to think, yet at least to pretend it to be; were as
much for Uniformity as other men, and urged the very same Arguments with great
Judgment and Reason, against the Independency, which may now with irresistible
Force be retorted upon themselves; as the Most Reverend and Incomparably
Learned, the Excellent Dean of Saint Paul's, a singular Ornament and strong
Support of the English Church and State against their Enemies of both kinds,
has very Wisely, and like himself, Observed.

Nay, to what excess of Riot a Toleration in its utmost Latitude will proceed,
the extravagancies either in Opinion or Practice, or both, of the Antinomians,
the Seekers, the Quakers, the Ranters, the Sweet-Singers, and the Family of
Love, are a sufficient witness; most of whose Opinions as they proceed only
from Ignorance, or Melancholy, or a worse cause, a Life ill spent, or a desire
to spend it amiss for the future; so the Debaucheries and the Obscenities of
some of these Sects which I have named, under a pretense of I know not what
Liberty, are so great and so horrid, that I should not have believed it, if I
had received it from any other information than that of some who pretended with
abundance of asseveration, and in a Company not easily to be imposed upon to
speak their own certain knowledge, and who, I have great reason to believe,
would not go about to deceive either me or any other man whatsoever.

Or if it be thought too grating to reflect with so great, and, which is still
worse, so just and so deserved a Severity upon the Miscarriages of our own Age,
upon Religious Pretenses; you may then consult the Annals of Antiquity; and
then Epiphanius and Irenoeus will tell you, if you consult them, that there was
no Crime so horrid, nor any unnatural Beastliness so detestable to humane
Nature, not yet corrupted and depraved by vicious habits, which the Gnostics,
the Basilidians, and the Valentinians did not practice; the instances of their
execrable turpitude being so horrid and so filthy, that I remember when I first
read them, which I did in the laborious Annals of the most learned Cardinal and
Jesuit, Coesar Baronius, I could not believe he had quoted his Authors
aright; and when upon a more narrow search into the business I found he had not
deceived me, I was amazed, and could scarce believe my own eyes, and to this
day am very loath to believe, for the respect I bear to Mankind, that they are
true.

But if such Exorbitances in our Age, or any other, be the effects of Liberty,
whether tolerated by others, or assumed upon what Pretenses soever to our
selves, then certainly, since humane Nature is always the same, and being
allowed the same scope, will always be guilty of the same or like Enormities,
which, by the prevalence of bad example, and by the addition of impunity to
temptation will always increase, instead of taking up within a dutiful
compass of Sobriety and Moderation, such an unbounded Liberty as this ought
always, by the utmost Severity of public Justice, to be repressed, and
punished, and restrained.

Neither must we be so vain to pretend, because such Enormities are not now
usually practiced among those that pretend to an higher degree of Saintship
than their Neighbors, that therefore they never will; for we must not take our
measures from the present state of things, but we are to consider what would
^ollow upon the Dissolution of the Government, to which these separate
Congregations have a clear and a natural tendency in themselves, and then we
will suppose, if you please, that such Libertines as these, if upon such
infinite Pretenses they do not separate themselves, shall be expelled the
respective Congregations to which they belong; but there being no public
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, who shall hinder them from associating into a
Confederacy with one another? to which all that live as if there were no God,
or have a desire to live as if there were no Government in the World will
immediately unite themselves, and betake themselves thither for Protection, as
to a Sanctuary of Liberty and Riot.

To say that such things will never happen is as much as to say they never did;
for whatever has been may be again, when humane Nature which is always the
same shall be joined to the same unhappy circumstances of Affairs.

To say that these things, though they should happen, will never be of any
dangerous consequence to the public, because the common Interest of Mankind
will always keep a prevailing Party in better order, is to set bounds to a bad
example, and to the corruption of manners which is impossible; and besides, to
proceed upon this presumption, without taking that course which is in its own
nature the best fitted to prevent any such public mischief, which can only be
done by a regular and orderly Discipline, is to lean so much upon humane
probabilities and upon our selves, that it is an high provocation to Almighty
God to withdraw his Grace, without which it is impossible for any of us to
persevere in a constant and steady course of Virtue.

But we will suppose for once, let what Toleration will be granted, that things
will never proceed to this extretremity; but it is still to be considered that
all these separate Congregations are Imperium in Imperio, there being in a
manner so many several Societies as there are several and independent
Congregations, without any foreign Appeal, or Judge in Ecclesiastical matters;
for at this rate it shall be at the Liberty of every private Paslour to preach
what Doctrine he pleases, be it never so much to the disturbance of the
Government of the public, as some of them do at this time take a most
unpardonable liberty in their Sermons: But if it be lawful for the Government
to assume to it self a Judgment of what Doctrines tend most to the
Establishment of its peace and safety, it is much more lawful for it to
concern it self in matters of Discipline, which are not in themselves of so
great moment, and which notwithstanding being left undetermined will have the
same effects; which it is for the interest of the World they should be adjusted
after an uniform manner, and in which the Gospel has left no rule, whereby we
are to manage and govern our selves.

If the Government where we live shall impose such things upon our Belief and
Practice as are inconsistent with Salvation, contrary to the duties of natural
and revealed Religion, and repugnant to such Propositions of Belief as are
expressly revealed in the Scriptures of the New Testament; then all we have to
do is, to suffer patiently, as our glorious Predecessors, the Apostles and the
primitive Christians did, and we shall certainly have our reward in Heaven for
so doing; but if we suffer only for breaking the Rules of decency and order,
which have been found by experience to be so necessary to the public Peace,
and which have no other tendencie, meaning or design, but in order to this end,
unless we can allege reasonably what I shall by and by insist upon, that there
is Superstition or Idolatry involved in our obedience, this is not Persecution
but Punishment, we suffer either like Fools or Madmen, or, what is worse than
either of these, like Boutefeus, Incendiaries and Disturbers of the quiet of
mankind, and must not expect either the Title or the Reward of Confessors or
Martyrs.

I reckon there are three Causes especially of the present Nonconformity from
the established Discipline of the Church of England.

The First is, The Ambition, or Necessity, or Discontent of some bad men who
know very well what Advantages may be made for the promotion of any ill Designs
by a Separation; neither is it any matter whether such persons be all of them
actually listed in some separate Assembly, so they do but abet and favor those
that are; but rather by paying a personal obedience to the Authority of the
Church, which they would have not destroyed, but enlarged, by breaking down
that Wall of partition to which we have no right, because the Dissenters have
built it upon their own ground, by endeavoring to let in the Trojan Horse of
Fanaticism through the Breaches of the Church, by very specious, but very
destructive and pernicious Pretenses of moderation and comprehension, and such
other hard names, which can only be understood by being felt; by a pretended
tenderness of dis-uniting Protestants, and yet at the same time uncharitably
representing the best Defenders of the Reformation under the odious and
invidious Characters of Papists or Popishly affected; by questioning the
Jurisdiction of the Bishops in temporal causes, that by that means they may
weaken their Ecclesiastical Power, by striking at the King through the sides of
his loyal and well-affected Clergy; and by doing all this and a great deal more
out of a dissembled Zeal for Unity and Peace, and out of a passionate Concern
for the Honor and Safety of the King and Church, they do abundantly more
mischief than either the Dissenters themselves, or they who are the most
unmanageable and indiscreet in the expressions of a bitter and unchristian
Animosity against them; because these, as being prejudiced and professed
Parties, will not be heard so equally on both sides.

Secondly, a second Cause, though indeed in the order of causality it may well
enough deserve the first place, of the Continuance of such an unnatural
Separation among us, notwithstanding there is so little or rather nothing at
all to be said in justification of so prejudicial and so unwarrantable a
Practice, is the Necessity or Revenge of those who at the happy revolution of
his Majesty's return, like the rising of the Sun, with healing in his wings to
heal the Sores of three divided Kingdoms, being ejected in great numbers out of
those Livings and Benefices of which they were then possessed, being unable to
digg, unless it were in the Vineyard, and being ashamed to beg; being desirous
to reak their Revenge upon the Government, which had ejected them only for
that reason, because it could not trust them, and because they would not obey
it; being tainted with the Leaven of the good old Cause; being soundly seasoned
with Democratical and Demagogical Principles of which it is very hard for a
thorough Commonwealth's man, especially when he is no Philosopher, to rid
himself; being in some small hopes, as drowning men are when they catch at a
Reed, of reaping a new Harvest out of the Church lands and out of the Spoils of
the Crown; being encouraged and abetted by men of like Principles and Practices
and Circumstances with themselves, by good old Officers that had been in
Commission, by Proprietours that had lost those Tenements and Hereditaments
that never were their own, by inconsiderate Women that are naturally fond of
Saintship and Persecution, by Men that were Bigots to a Party, or Dependents
upon an Interest, that wanted a Wife, or would oblige a Chapman, or insinuate
themselves into a Last Will and Testament; by the Women's caressing their
Husbands, and the Husbands persuading their Wives; by causes that cannot be
justified, and causes that must not be named, the black Fraternity of the short
robe were at length so far emboldened, as, notwithstanding the Severity of
those wholesome Laws, whose edge was rebated by the fatal Clemency of a too
Gracious Prince, toward men that ought not to be trusted, and cannot be
obliged, to own and justify a Separation, which is now grown to that excessive
height, that the Contention is no longer about Liberty, but Dominion; they
break the Laws openly, without regard to Justice or to Shame, and to propagate
a Succession of Law-breakers like themselves, they have ordained an Under-wood
of Nonconforming Shrubs, who will in time grow up to be Cedars of Rebellion,
and come by the Priesthood much by the same right and title that Oliver came by
the Protectourship, or Trincalo by his Dukedom: So that it is now with the
Dissenters as it was the Israelites in Jeroboam's time, they have their
separate Assemblies and their distinct Altars, their Priests, not of the
Levitical or Aaronical Tribe, much less of the more perfect Melchisedecian
Order, but of the dreggs and refuse of the People, and Calves in abundance, the
Idols of the Faction, as far as from Dan to Bethel.

But Thirdly, a third Cause of that dangerous Nonconformity which prevails
among us is, a certain sort of Opiniatrity, or Affectation, or Newfangleness
which in all Ages usually possesses the ordinary sort of People, by which they
are always apt to quarrel and find fault with the present Establishment, let
it be never so wholesome; and if it were not for this Cause, the other two
Causes which I have mentioned would want a subject upon which to work: but
certainly, if men would seriously consider with themselves how dangerous all
Innovations in the general are, and how destructive oftentimes to the public
Peace; how little most of them are like to get by Innovation, and how much they
may lose; how small and inconsiderable, how unreasonable and unwarrantable the
present Differences are; how necessary it is there should be some
Establishment, and how impossible that any should please all; and that this is
but to perpetuate quarrels by the nicety of some and the design of others, from
one generation to another without any measure, moderation or end, to the
inexpressible and unconceivable disturbance of the World; they would not then
think it worth their while to lose the Quiet of their own minds, their Charity
for others, and the good opinion of others for them, to crumble into Sects and
Parties, to embroil us in infinite and inextricable Difficulties at home, and
to expose us to the unavoidable Dangers of a foreign yoke, and a foreign
Religion from abroad; only to gratify the Designs of proud, or discontented,
or necessitous men; to feed Contempt and Ignorance themselves, and to cloth
Want of loyalty, learning, good nature and good manners.

It is true indeed, that the Wisdom of this World is Foolishness with God, and
that the Wisdom of God is Foolishness with this World, and that they are
opposite the one to the other; but then by the Wisdom of this World, is meant,
that Carnal Mind that has a greater consideration for a Temporal Interest,
than for the Interest of Truth and Virtue; for the Commands of God, or the
precepts of the Gospel; but that men that have little or no Learning of their
own, and yet are unassisted by those extraordinary helps of Utterance and
Supernatural Illumination with which the Apostolical times were furnished; men
that are so far from understanding what Reason is, that they decry it; men that
are steered wholly by considerations of Interest, by impulses of Passion, by an
habit of Prejudice and a principle of Revenge; that these of all others should
be thought the fittest to Instruct the People, and to have the care and conduct
of such precious things as are the Souls of men committed to their Charge; that
these should be thought worthy to be the instruments of our Confusion, who have
neither the wit nor the honesty to make us Happy, who design us no Good, and
can do us none if they did design it; is a thing which I am very confident,
will find no manner of countenance from Scripture, and is utterly unable to
plead the least shadow of a Grant or Commission from above.

An unlimitted Toleration must of necessity be unlawful, if any thing be;
because it contradicts the design for which all Laws are made, and that is
nothing else but to secure the Peace and Quiet of the World; which must needs
be very inconsistent with an unlimitted Toleration, by which nothing else is or
can be meant, but a Liberty for every man to do or say as he pleases, so he
do it upon a Religious account, or out of a Principle of Conscience, of which
himself is the only judge in this case: to say otherwise, being to constitute
such a foreign Appeal, is altogether incompetible with such a toleration.

Now if it can be proved that the allowance of separate and independent
Congregations, without any Jurisdiction in Ecclesiastical affairs, Foreign to
themselves, is such an unlimitted Toleration in it self, and will prove so in
its Effects; then I suppose it will be granted, that all such Separate
Assemblies are unlawful; and consequently, that a Toleration of them cannot be
allowed by the Chief Magistrate, or by the Legislative Power, without a
Dissolution of the Government, and a betraying of that Trust which is reposed
in them for the preservation of the public Peace.

What if an Holder-forth in a Separate Assembly, shall teach his Auditors that
they owe no subjection to any Earthly Prince, that Rebellion is expressly
dispensed with in the Charter of the Saints; that Adultery, and Sacrilege, and
Theft, and Murder, themselves; though in the Wicked and the Unregenerate, they
be horrid crimes; yet they are a part of the privilege of the Elect, that all
sorts of swearing are in the Reprobate unlawful; but that Perjury it self, in
such as are sanctified and made Partakers of that new Birth by which so many
Monsters are brought into the World, may be not only Lawful, but Pious and
Commendable, and in some cases an indispensable Duty?

Shall the Government in this Case, Shall Civil or Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction
be allowed to Interpose, by punishing such Profligate and such Insolent
Wretches, and by forbidding under severe Penalties the venting of any such
Doctrines for the future, which tend so manifestly to withdraw his Majesty's
liege People from their Obedience, and to the unspeakable peril and hazard of
their immortal Souls? If thus much be not allowed, then all things must run to
Confusion; and if it be, then if the regulalation of Discipline be sound by
experience to be as necessary to the public Welfare, to the peace of the
Kingdom, and to the preservation of Charity and Friendship among men; without
which it is hardly possible there should be any such thing as true and
acceptable Religion: then certainly it does as much belong to, and is as
necessary a part of Civil and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, as the other.

I know but two things that can possibly be urged against the irresistible
force of so plain a Demonstration: I call it a Demonstration, because it will
prove so when those Objections are considered. First, It may be pretended that
there is no danger, such Doctrines will ever be preached. And secondly, That a
Difference grounded merely upon matters of Discipline, will never produce those
bad Effects that are pretended.

In answer to the first, there are but two things to be said, the first is an
Argument from Reason, the second from Experience. Reason tells us, and so does
Experience too, for they cannot well be separated in this case, that men are
naturally subject to seek excuses first to palliate, and then arguments to
defend those Vices to which they find themselves addicted, and of which they
are known to be scandalously guilty, or which they would practice for the
future without control.

The Drunkard, he puts his excess to the account of his friendship and good
nature; the Lustful plead a perpetual inclination as a natural call to
enjoyment; the Covetous man is desirous of the character of Provident and
Frugal; and the Ambitious would be thought a man of a losty and heroique mind;
but nothing is so great a plea for Libertinism and Licentiousness of all sorts
whatsoever, as when it is made an Instance of Christian Liberty, and a Freedom
from the Yoke of Ordinances; to which none but Jews and Formalists, and the
tame Vassals of the dead Letter are subject.

There is no question to be made, but there are very bad People to be found in
all Parties, let the Pretenses to Religion be what they will; but it is not my
business at present to upbraid any with their sinful practices, so they do not
own the Principles from whence those practices proceed.

But what shall we think of the Gnostics of old time, that made adulterous and
inces^uous mixtures, and promiscuous coitions a part of their Religion? or, of
the Family of Love, that do the same? or, of the Sweet singers, that drink Ale
and puff Tobacco to excess in their very religious Assemblies? or, of the
Reformers of this last Age, that thought they did God good service by robbing
his Church and persecuting his Servants to death, and banishment, and
confiscation of goods? or, of the received Maxim of those blessed times,
Dominium fundatur in gratia, that is, The longest Sword has the best Title? or,
of the Fifth monarchists of England? of the incredible Impudence and Villainy
of the religious Incendiaries in Scotland? of the Zealots among the Jews, the
exact Patterns of the Zealots of our days, of whom Josephus relates such
prodigious Stories? of Theudas or Theodosius and his Followers, and of Judas of
Galilee or Judas Gaulonites and his Accomplices, in the Acts of the Apostles?
all which, under several religious Pretenses, have in time past, or do at
present endeavor to set up for themselves, and shake off the Yoke of obedience
to their lawful Superiors, to their liege Lords and rightful Masters. What
sort of People in the World are so arbitrary as these, who yet are the loudest
Declamours not only against Arbitrary Power, but against all Power but their
own? The Papists themselves are not more bloody than they, nor any of the
persecuting Emperors more powerfully acted and possessed by a Spirit of
bitterness and persecution. To conclude; Did not the Levellers preach Community
of goods, according to the primitive example, (though the reason of that
practice be now utterly ceased) and to reduce the natural state of things, when
all things lay in common, before either Industry or Arts began? and what is
this but a more religious method of Picking of Pockets and Breaking open Houses
and Robbing upon the High way? What was it but a new Invention of those
pil^ering Saints, to give Thieves and Robbers, like themselves, a right to the
glorious Title and Reward of Martyrdom?

Now if all these Mischiefs and Inconveniences are owing perfectly to separate
Congregations, and to men's embodying themselves into particular Ecclesiastical
Societies distinct from the public Discipline and Rule; if such Opinions and
Practices cannot better be promoted than by independent methods, nor otherwise
or at least better be prevented than by an uniform and regular Discipline of
the Church; then is it abundantly manifest that such ^eparate Congregations, as
tending plainly to the disturbance of the World, are unlawful; that they may,
and that they ought to be suppressed; and that all the Favorers and Abettors
of such unlawful Assemblies, are Promoters, Aiders, Comforters and Assisters
of Rebellion and Disobedience both against God and Man.

Neither is it at all material in this case, that many of those who frequent
these separate Assemblies, nay, to give them their due, the infinitely greatest
part of them, are not conscious to themselves of any such bad Design, but they
do it only out of a religious prejudice which they have conceived against the
Establishment of the Church of England, and out of an opinion which they have
of the greater Sanctity of their Teachers, and Purity of those Ordinances of
which they are made partakers by their ministration, out of a real and an
hearty zeal for God, although that zeal be not according to knowledge, yet we
are not to consider so much what it is they design, as what the natural
tendencie of all Separation is, which, because by experience it is found to
bring so great and so horrid inconveniences and mischiefs upon the World,
unless it be timely restrained, it may, and it must of necessity have very bad
effects; and this is enough to make men guilty of the consequences of their
Separation, though at first they did not intend them. He that commits a fault
through want of consideration is not altogether so guilty as he that knowing it
to be a fault, does yet notwithstanding commit it on set purpose; but yet he is
guilty in his proportion and degree as well as the other, because it was his
duty to consider better, and still the more easy it is too for a man to inform
himself: (and what is or can be more manifest than the Prejudice arising from
men's embodying themselves into particular and independent Societies?) So much
the greater is the guilt arising from the want of due heed and consideration,
because a very little attention would have served the turn, when there is so
much reason in the thing, and so much experience to improve that reason into
all the certainty of demonstration.

But secondly, It will be said, That a bare difference in the externals of
Religion, in matters of mere Discipline and Ceremony, will not produce those
bad effects that are pretended; and I wish with all my heart, that there were
as much truth in this Exception as they that make it would have it seem to
have; but, by Experience, which is the great Judge in this Controversy, to
which we must apply our selves for the discovery of the truth, the contrary
does but too manifestly appear. For what is it that has been the true source
and fountain of all our pablick Calamities, that has made so dreadful and so
terrible Convulsions both in Church and State, but an overheated zeal against
Ceremonies and public Order, which sort of zeal, if it be tolerated, the
strength and beauty of the Church is lost, by every man's pursuing fancies of
his own, or siding with a new model of a particular Party instead of joining
in the regular and uniform Worship of the public, which is at once an instance
of our Obedience to the Divine and Humane Laws, and a certain expedient of
Unity and Peace with one another; but if this zeal, instead of being tolerated,
shall be restrained and opposed, then it immediately complains of Persecution,
and would have its sufferings thought as meritorious for raising unreasonable,
insatiable and eternal Scruples, as if the Cause of Christianity it self were
at stake, as if it were the being of a God or the immortality of the Souls of
men that were denied by us, and asserted only by the Dissenters from the
public Order and Rule.

So that either way the inconvenience is in a manner equal, a Toleration has a
manifest tendencie to the subversion of the Government both in Church and
State, and in that, there is no question to be made, but it will certainly end,
when once it has been suffered to have its full scope and swinge; and yet a
vigorous Prosecution of the Laws against the Disturbers of the Peace is branded
with the odious name of Persecution, and they that suffer by it, for being
Incendiaries, are termed Saints; and because it is natural for a distressed
Cause to find a friendship and pity from the common People whether it be
reasonable or no, Suffering being a very sensible and a very affecting thing
when the Causes of those Sufferings are not so plain and obvious to every
common understanding, especially when blinded by prejudice or concern for the
persons of those that suffer; from hence it comes to pass that a just and
necessary Prosecution of the Laws, if it be not managed with abundance of
temper and prudence, so as it may appear it is not done out of hatred to a
Party, but out of a real tenderness to the common good, may sometimes prove the
occasion of great and fatal disorders in a State, and may in its con^equence be
attended with all those confusions to which a boundless Toleration is exposed.

This was the great reason of the revolt of the United Provinces from under the
Spanish Yoke; who, if they had been treated with less severity, might probably
by gentler methods have been reduced to Obedience; but by the Cruelty of the
Spanish Governors and Soldiery who pursued them, especially under the
Government of the Duke D'Alva, with all the symptoms of the most mortal hatred,
they were so far alienated in their affections from a Government that used them
so ill, they had such a dread of those unheard of Cruelties and such a deserved
aversation for that Religion that delights to propagate it self by Blood, that,
being assisted by the Hugonots from France, whose interest it was to stand by
the Reformation, and by Supplies from England, which was glad at that time to
find an opportunity to reduce the Spanish greatness to a juster balance with
the rest of the European Princes, they were at length perfectly severed from
the body of the Spanish Empire, and united in a common Alliance among
themselves, for the mutual support and main tenance of each other; which,
though it gave beginning to the most powerful Republic that has ever appeared
since the Roman, yet, as a Republic in its nature and constitution is more
exposed to the ambition or animositie of bad men than a Kingdom or Monarchy is
or can well be, so in the midst of its greatness, it always carried in its
bowels the undoubted symptoms and causes of its ruin, which it is to be
feared, what with the Factions at home, and the daily increasing Power of its
enemies from abroad, is not far off at this time.

But yet though Cruelty be that for which all mankind, but they that exercise
it upon others, have a just and mortal aversation, yet a Prosecution of all
Penal Laws cannot be called Cruelty, unless it be Cruelty to govern, or to use
the necessary and the only means to keep the World in order; all Punishment is
Cruelty, or at least Injustice, which is inflicted is defense of a bad cause or
a bad religion, but when the Penalties themseves are not so severe as to
deserve the name of Cruel, and when they are inflicted for the Preservation of
a sound and orthodox Religion, which I persuade my self most of the Dissenters
will acknowledge that of the Church of England to be; when they are inslicted
for the preservation of Unity and Friendship among men, when this is the only
Expedient by which an universal Friendship and Charity can be maintained, by
which the Government can be rendered safe in it self and easy to those that are
to obey, by which we can be rendered quiet and secure at home, or considerable
abroad, by which we can be put in the best capacity to resist an Enemy or to
succor an Ally, or to transmit the Profession of the Gospel in its native
purity and beauty down to our own Children and to their posterity through all
generations as long as time shall endure, whereas without this course we shall
be subject to infinite changes and vicissitudes in our Secular and in our
Ecclesiastical Concerns, and shall be more dangerously exposed, when our
strength by a Toleration is disunited and broken in pieces, to the incursions
of Idolatry, Superstition, Infidelity, Debauchery, Profaneness, and of all
manner of Evil whatsoever it be; this is sufficient to justify a lawful Power
in the use of the only means by which these Inconveniences may be avoided, and
if it shall so happen, through the evil disposition of men, that a Prosecution
of the Laws, which is the only possible expedient of Peace and Safety, shall
yet notwithstanding produce the same mischiefs and disorders which a Toleration
would have done, yet in this case the Magistrate will have the satisfaction in
his own Conscience and before God of having discharged his duty, and of not
having betrayed that trust which is reposed in him; which in the other, as
being a natural means to bring us all to confusion, I do not see how he can
ever have or expect.

The Contentions about matters of Discipline are therefore manifestly of the
highest importance, because they occasion a Separation, which is the fruitful
mother of all those fatal mischiefs both to Church and Kingdom that have been
mentioned already, and can never be too often repeated, or too seriously
reflected upon.

I would very willingly know of our Dissenters what they think themselves, upon
supposition that the whole Nation were divided and parcell'd out into separate
and independent Congregations, which is that which an unlimited Toleration
would produce, whether or no its strength would be so firm and so compacted as
it is now? To say it would, is to say that a divided interest can be as strong
as that whose parts are never so well compacted and knit to one another; and it
is, besides this absurdity in the reason of the reason of the thing, to
contradict the experience of our own Age and of all that have gone before it;
to maintain the lawfulness of such separate Congregations, notwithstanding
those many and dismal inconveniences to which they are exposed, is to affirm,
that it is lawful to endeavor the subversion of the Government, which in this
case will never be able to maintain it self without a standing Army, no more
than in the times of usurpation; and it will be very hard, if not impossible;
besides other incommodities and pressures to which this way of administration
is exposed; that instead of defending the Laws, they shall not at some time or
other subvert them, instead of making the Prince happy and his People secure,
they shall not make both miserable, obnoxious and dependent; instead of
agreeing together for the maintenance of the common peace and safety, they
shall not fall out among themselves, partaking of the epidemical giddiness of
the People whom they pretend to serve, but are in reality their absolute Lords
and Masters, and burn up all the senses of Property and Right in the unnatural
flames of an intestine War.

I demand farther, whether they can or do suppose, though God be thanked we are
not yet brought to the utmost persection of Tumult and Disorder, that the
separating of so many particular Congregations is not a weakening of the
Government, as well as the dividing the whole Nation into such independent
Assemblies would be a subvertion of it? Certainly this depends in its
proportion upon the same reason with the other, and therefore cannot be denied;
besides, that the present posture of affairs does sufficiently prove it to be
true, when our Heats and Dissentions about indifferent matters, as men are
pleased to call them, have made us, from a Nation that was used to be the
Umpire and the Arbiter of Europe, to become so inconsiderable as we are abroad,
and so uneasy and unsafe at home; besides, that by our Divisions we increase
those dangers of Popery which we pretend to dread; while by an universal, but
deserved cry against so detestable a Superstition, we are heaping coals of fire
upon our own heads against the day of wrath and persecution if ever it prevail
among us, and we provoke our Enemies with more zeal than prudence, unless we
would join together, as we ought to do, in a common League to resist them: so
that it still appears more and more evident, upon all considerations, that
Uniformity is necessary to the public safety; it is necessary to the honor
and seemly appearance of the Government as well as to the happiness of it: it
appears likewise that separate and independent Congregations are therefore
unlawful, because where there is no common jurisdiction there can be no common
rule of discipline and order: it appears that a Toleration of such independent
Assemblies, is a Toleration of uncharitableness and strise among men, and
therefore as being directly and diametrically opposite to the very nature and
temper of Christianity, it must of necessity be unlawful: lastly it appears
that humane impositions are lawful, because this Uniformity, which is
necessary to the quiet of the World and to the making Christianity useful to
so good an end cannot possibly be obtained without them.

Separation, let it be for what cause or upon what pretense soever, does, as I
have said already, imply a dislike, and does create an alienation of affection
in the parties separating from one another, and therefore since a quarrel is
much more easily somented than begun; since it is hard in many cases for the
best tempers to ^e reconciled to one another, but very easy by new
provocations to add new fuel to the fire of discord, till it grow masterless
without any hopes of quenching, therefore no such Separation ought ever to be
made without necessary causes; and such as make Communion in its own nature
unlawful, because all other pretenses are infinite, and at that rate there can
be no end of Dissension among men; especially if we consider farther, what is
not perhaps so usually regarded, or at least not mentioned among the reasons
which prove a Separation unlawful; men do not only by this means divide from
one another as to their religious concerns, but even in their temporal affairs
they care not to deal or have to do with one another; and thus they trade, and
marry, and converse generally with the men of their own way, and are almost to
all intents and purposes as many distinct Societies as there are parties or
factions in that unhappy Church whose misfortune it is to be so miserably
divided: the consideration of which cannot choose but affright every man who has
any regard either of his own peace, or to that of his Country, by presenting
him with a dismal Scene of a Church divided and mangled into several
disagreeing bodies, separated in all respects from one another, and as it were,
drawn up in Battalia, and expecting only the Signal of opportunity or
advantage on any side to begin a bloody encounter; which they that complain so
heavily of Persecution themselves (when they have so little reason, and when
they at the same time persecute the Government and all that favor it with
calumny and detraction, which is a very grievous sort of persecution) will
certainly do whenever it shall lie in their power. They having not only given
us a sufficient spice of their temper in the late times, to teach us not to
trust them any more or any farther than needs must; but it is scarce longer ago
than yesterday, that the tender Consciences were indulged so long till they
grew too hard for the Government, and it is but too ^vident, by their words and
actions in that critical juncture, that if they had gained their point, which
was the subversion of the present establishment disguised under specious
pretenses of uniting Protestants, who cannot be united by any thing but a
public Form and Ritual of Divine Service; they would soon have shown us what
opinion they have of their pretended Diana Toleration, a Goddess never worshipped
in the public Temples, and a word that never sounds pleasantly, but to those
that want the thing.

So that an universal Toleration of all parties and opinions being manifestly
proved to be naturally unlawful, to be attended with infinite inconvenience
and mischief both to the public and particular persons, of which the body
politic it self is made up, as the whole is but an aggregate of several parts
considered as one, and summed up together, there remains now nothing farther to
be considered under the topic of concession, but that either we alter some
ceremonies which have afforded matter or pretense of scruple for others in
their stead, or that we do totally abolish whatever is excepted against,
without any supplement or reparation: For the first of these, it is granted by
such as shall desire it, that an imposition in the general is lawful,
otherwise it would be ridiculous to talk of substituting other Ceremonies in
the stead of those that are abolished, when the very substitution it self is
made an exception against them, it behooves those persons therefore who are
desirous of such an alteration, since by the desire it self they do imply an
acknowledgment, that a substitution, that is, a new imposition may lawfully be
made, and by consequence that an imposition in the general considered is not
unlawful; I say, it concerns them to show some particular reason, besides the
imposition, of their dislike of the Ceremonies which are already in use; for
otherwise if we must alter them for no reason, we can have no certainty that
this innovating humor will ever have an end, neither is it possible to make
any other construction of it, but that it proceeds out of a design to give an
endless disturbance to the public peace, notwithstanding it pretends to
establish and secure it. And as for those, in the second place, that are for
abolishing without a reparation, the case will be the same again; for either
they are against those Ceremonies, which they would have abolished, merely for
that reason because they are imposed, and then it is manifest they ought not to
be heard, because this, like Sampson, with an honest perhaps, but yet a blind
fury, and a mistaken zeal pulls up the very Pillars of Government from their
natural basis, and destroys the only expedient under Heaven of public safety,
security and peace; it makes the very worship of God it self precarious and
uncertain, and exposes it at every turn to the design of Knaves, the
destructive zeal of Madmen and Enthusiasts, the libertinism of Epicures and
voluptuary persons, to the scorn of Atheists, and the contempt of all wise,
considerate and sober men; there must therefore still be another reason
assigned why the Ceremonies that are boggled at should be abolished, and those
reasons can be none but one of those three that have been mentioned already,
either they are too cumbersome by reason of their number, or they are
superstitious in their use, or they are idolatrous in their direction.

The first of these particulars has been already considered; and as to the
second, a Ceremony may be said to be superstitiously used, when we ascribe to
it some Physical virtue or efficacy, or some supernatural effect which it has
not, or when we say that by or together with it, grace is conferred, as in the
two Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper; but we do not affirm this of
any of our Ceremonies, and our Church has expressly declared that she intends
nothing by them but only peace, and decency, and edification; and for the use
of the Cross in Baptism, which is the great thing scrupled under this head of
Superstition, she does expressly declare that it does not at all belong to the
Essence of it, that the Baptism is complete without and before it, that it is
only a declarative rite of the persons being listed under Christ's Banner, of
our being dedicated to his service, who for our sakes underwent so painful and
so ignominious a death, of our not being ashamed of that Cross which the Son of
God himself underwent, and of our willingness, if occasion be, to take up our
Cross and follow him through much tribulation and sufferings into the glory of
the Father. So that here there are but two things to be considered, either this
Rite is unlawful because it has been superstitiously abused by those in the
Romish Communion, and then upon the same account kneeling at our Prayers will
be unlawful, because the Papists kneel to the host, which yet, I presume, none
of the Dissenters will be so hardy to say; or else, secondly, it will be said,
as some of them do, that it is therefore unlawful because it is a Ceremony of
a symbolical or significative nature, which is very strange, as if a Ceremony
could be unlawful, only for that reason, because it tends to edification, as
it is the nature of a significant Ceremony to do. And here indeed is a great
and common mistake concerning indifferent things, as we do usually, but falsely
call them; for though we do not say, that any one Ceremony has any
superstitious efficacy or virtue in it, or that it can never upon any
consideration be changed or omitted, or that it is of absolute necessity in
order to salvation, yet this must be confessed at the last, that many things
are not so indifferent, as they are usually esteemed.

It is very fit and consequently a duty, that the Clergy should go attired in
black rather than in colors, that they should wear long robes rather than
short, and rather short hair than long, because it will always be, that the
latter of these will in the minds of all men create a sense of levity, a
disposition to contempt, an opinion of luxury and effeminate softness, whereas
the former in the common interpretation of Mankind will always have a grave and
a majestic appearance, they will reslect authority, credit, and an opinion of
sobriety and staidness upon him that wears them; and if the person be unlike
what he appears, his habit which was designed among other things for a mark of
distinction, will be the greater and the more deserved reproach to him. The
Nonconformists themselves are so sensible of this, that they themselves wear
black, for no good reason but what is symbolical, though they condemn that
account of any thing we do in us, and they wear long cloaks too, though Gowns
and Cassocks they have nothing to do with, and therefore they do still remain
in a state of superstition and uncleanness, only for that reason because they
are longer, that is, more grave, more becoming, more authoritative, because
they preach better and persuade more effectually than short ones.

The Surplice, a thing so much decryed and talked against by some, what is it
to the Layety? or how come they so deeply to scruple it in others, who are not
obliged to wear it themselves? if they scruple it for no reason but only
because they are not, that is, they will not be satisfied, a man can as little
tell where such an unaccountable scrupulosity will end, as from whence it
begins or upon what reason it is founded, when it is confessed to be founded
upon no reason at all, besides that it is intolerable, that they that talk so
much of liberty themselves, should not leave us at our liberty to act as our
Oaths and as the Laws oblige us, when they can assign no reason why we should
not, and when the dispute is about a matter in which they are not personally
concerned: if there be any reason why it is scrupled it is only because it is
a symbolical thing which has been already answered, besides that it stands
perfectly upon the same bottom with their own putting on clean clothes and
change of raiment on a Sunday, which that that day of the week is chose above
all the rest to do it in, it must be confessed to be done upon a religious
account and a symbolical reason, out of respect to that day, and to intimate
that purity and innocence of mind which is expected from them in the worship of
God. For the Communion Tables being railed in, and separated in that manner
which it is from the rest of the Church, it is declared in the Canons of 1640.
Article 7. that it is only to avoid that irreverence and prosanation, which
would otherwise bring a contempt upon all holy things, and upon the consecrated
Elements themselves.

It is rather necessary than otherwise that I should be uncovered at Church, as
being at that time more especially in the presence of God, and that I should
kneel or stand rather than sit at my Prayers, because these are Natural
postures of humility and reverence, and have been esteemed so in all Ages and
Nations, whereas sitting, or leaning, or lying along do betoken a comparative
carelessness and disregard of God and of his worship, and will without question
produce that bad effect upon the minds of men wherever they are put in
practice; as on the contrary, a devout and submissive gesture and deportment of
our selves at the times and places of religious worship is of real benefit and
advantage to our selves, and is of good example to others, and for the
edification of all; which things are so plain and so undoubted a justification
of all significant Ceremonies, that I need say no more concerning them.

Lastly, there is no Ceremony in our Church, which is or is pretended to be
Idolatrous in its direction, for as to the bowing toward the Altar or
Communion Table placed at the East end of the Church, it is left to every man's
liberty by the Canons of 1640. to behave himself in that matter as he pleases,
so that here is nothing imposed, and yet because this has been formerly so
highly censured, and perhaps with some more tolerable pretense, than any of the
other exceptions that are made, I should not use it, since I am not enjoined,
where it may give offense or be an occasion of scandal to the weak, but in
Cathedral or Collegiate Churches, where the Congregations usually are better
informed, there is no reason why it may not be done, for it is not pretended
that we bow to any carved Image, or to the likeness of any living Creature
whether in Heaven or Earth, which was the thing expressly forbidden by the
second Commandment, that we worship the Railes or the Table it self, or at any
time the consecrated Elements upon it, which is likewise included in the
meaning of that Commandment, all which our Church does expressly declare
against, in as plain Language as words are capable of speaking: And in the
second place it is to be considered, that the Israelites long before
Christianity was thought of, did always worship toward Jerusalem, that is,
toward a certain quarter of the Heavens without any the least suspicion of
Idolatry, and that for ought appears, only by humane institution; lastly, I
hope it will not be denied that God is in all times and places a very true and
proper object of adoration, and that there is no quarter of the Heavens,
besides the symbolical reasons upon which this practice depends, toward which
we may not worship him without Idolatry.

As for our kneeling at the Sacrament our Church has sufficiently declared her
self in this point, that she intends no worship but to God only, to God the
Father, who sent his only begotten Son into the World to die for our sins; to
God the Son, who is then spiritually received, and dies afresh for us in the
merit, and virtue, and efficacy of his passion as often as we do worthily
partake of those holy mysteries, and to God the Holy Ghost, whose Grace is then
implored and received by us.

Because the Papists worship their Breaden God, shall it therefore be unlawful
for us to kneel at our Prayers, to behave our selves humbly in the presence of
the true and only God, to acknowledge our offenses, and repent us of our sins,
and give thanks to God for his mercy, to pray that the Body and Blood of our
Lord Jesus Christ may preserve our Body and Soul to everlasting life, and to
take that holy Sacrament to our unspeakable and eternal comfort, meekly
kneeling upon our knees?

But it would be infinite to say all that might be said upon so copious a
subject, in which I have all the way so plainly concurring with me, the voice
of reason, of experience, and of the wisest and best men of these and all times
ever since the Reformation, therefore I shall sum up all, as I began, with the
words of the Apostle, Let all things be done decently and in order.

THE END.

Jews, and from several other reasons, p. 139. The Conclusion, p. 140.
AN EXERCITATION Concerning the true Time of OUR SAVIOR'S Last Supper WITH HIS
DISCIPLES.
FOR the time of our Savior's Passover, I affirm, that it was upon the evening
of the fourteenth of Nisan, being the night before the Jews by the prescription
of the Mosaic Law were to celebrate theirs; and, for the proof of this, I
shall produce these following places of Scripture in that order in which they
are set down but not answered by the late excellent and profoundly learned
Samuel Bochartus, who being dead, yet speaks, and whose Works will follow him
through all generations laden with the spoils of industry; and the rewards of
praise as long as civility and learning shall endure; but it is excusable in
those that write so much to be sometimes mistaken, and it is usually seen that
the errors of great men are like themselves.

He therefore in his Hierozoicon, in that Chapter where he discourses of the
Paschal-lamb, has ranged those Scriptures which he pretends to answer in the
following order.

The first is Joh. 13. 1. Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew
that his hour was come. And then, v. 2. And supper being ended, etc. From
whence the Argument is clear, that if this place be to be understood of his
last Supper with his Disciples, then that last Supper was before the Feast of
the Passover.

The second place is the eighteenth Chapter of the same Gospel at the 28.
verse, Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was
early, and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be
defiled: but that they might eat the Passover. Now this happening, as it did,
the day after, or rather the very same day when our Savior ate his Passover
with his Disciples, whereas the Jews were not to eat theirs till the night
following; it is manifest our Savior's Passover was a night before theirs.

The third place is Chap. 19. v. 14. And it was the preparation of the
Passover, and about the sixth hour: and he (that is, Pilate) says unto the
Jews, Behold your King. Now if Christ were betrayed and carried before Pilate
upon the Preparation of the Passover, then the Jewish Passover was not yet
come; for the Parasceve or Preparation of any Feast was the day before it.

The fourth place is the 31. verse of the same Chapter, The Jews therefore,
because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the
cross on the Sabbath day (for that Sabbath day was an high day) besought Pilate
that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. In which
words there are two things to be considered. First, We have it again plainly
asserted that it was the preparation of the Sabbath, which Sabbath this year
was coincident with the Passover it self. Secondly, It is said, That that
Sabbath day was an high day (...).

And what the meaning of a great or high day is, you may see from Isay. 1. 13.
the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies I cannot away with. Where
the LXX. render it thus, (...) where the calling of assemblies is rendered by
(...), the great, or high day, which in other places is termed an holy
convocation, by which is meant the first and last day of the three great Feasts
which were kept for seven days together, in the first and last of which there
was a more extraordinary concourse of the People, and besides, a Sabbath or day
of Rest from all manner of secular imploiment; which notion if Bo^^artus had
understood so thoroughly as he should have done, if he had known that the
seventh day of a Feast was as well (...), a great, or high day, as the first,
though it was not equally so, for by this time most of those that lived at any
distance from Jerusalem were gone home, he would not have uttered these words,
Quin apud Jadaeos nullum fuit Festum in quod non quadret hoc nomen, that there
was no Feast Day among the Jews which might not properly enough be called a
great, or high day; for which he cites that Text of Joh. c. 7. v. 37. speaking
of the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles, (...), in the last day, that great
day of the Feast; neither is this any more than what is usual in our own Age,
as Bochartus could not choose but know; for what day or night is so guilty of
excess and riot as that which is the last of the Carnival in Popish Countries?
and here, among our selves, the Solemnities of Twelftide and Candlemass are in
a manner equal to that of Christmas day. Procopius himself whose Authority is
produced by Bochartus may be sufficient to put him to silence, his words are
these, expressly asserting a great, or high day to be, (...) that is, every day
which is termed an holy convocation, as the first and seventh day of
Vnleavenedbread, the day of Pentecost, the tenth day of the (...) (Tisri,) and,
in one word, every more remarkable ^^ extraordinary Feast Day. But you see he
expressly tells ^^ as to the Feast of the Passover, that only the first and
seventh were (...), great, or high days; ^^^ the same is to be understood of
the Feast of Pentec^^, or Weeks, and of the Feast of Tabernacles; for the
latter of which we have the express Authority of Saint Jo^^, it being absurd to
call the seventh day of the Feast, (...), the great, or high day of the feast;
if all the seven days were so as well as that, so that Bechartus his darling
Testimony does sufficiently con^^^^ that opinion which he endeavors to
establish upon it; for that which he designs to prove is, that the second day
of Unleavened bread, upon the approach of which he supposes our Savior to have
suffered, was a great, or (...) day, which this Testimony will by no means do,
nor that of Procopius neither. Since therefore it is agreed ^^ all hands, that
our Savior did not suffer upon the seventh day of Vnleavened-bread, or upon
the approach of it, what can be more plain, than that he underwent his Passion
upon the approach of the Feast, at that very time when the Paschal-lamb was to
be slain? and from hence it is, though I did not intend to have betrayed that
Secret now, that Easter sunday, by the ancient (...) Church, was called (...),
the great, or (...) Sunday, as I have seen it in their Liturgies, both in
Manuscript and printed. For although the Tessarescaidecatit^, so called from
their following the Jewish account, celebrated their Easter upon any day of the
week indifferently, as Eusebius, Epiphanius, Saint Austin, Theodoret and
Philastrius assure us; yet it was the general way of the Church, which we
retain, to celebrate it upon the Sunday after the anniversary of the Passion,
which being coincident with an ordinary or weekly commemoration of (...)
Resurrection, which every Sunday is, was called the (...), or high Sunday, as
well because of the concurrence (...) it were of two Holydaies in one, as for
that this being our Christian Passover, it answers to the first day of
Unleavened bread, which was an Holy Convocation among the Jews.

The last place mentioned by Bochartus is Matt. 26. 5. But they said, Not on
the Feast day, lest there be an uprore (...) the people. Which place, to speak
truly, proves nothing either way. For thus much is certain, that the Jews were
wont to put to death notorious Malefactors, and such some of them looked upon
our Savior, and others would have had him thought to be upon the Preparation
of their solemn Feast-days, when there was a general conslux of the People,
that so the Punishment might be of greater example; but at this time, because
of the great reputation and esteem which our Blessed Lord had gained among the
People, it was resolved among the Chiefpriests and Scribes, that his
Crucifixion should not be on the Feast Day, lest the Concern of the People for
him might occasion a Tumult: but now it being clear that the Concourse would be
in a manner equal either on the first day of Unleavened-bread or on the day
before it, when all that were to partake of the Passover were actually come to
Jerusalem to prepare themselves in order to it; we must refer it wholly to the
Providence of God, who put it into the hearts of the Chief-priests and Scribes,
upon occasion of Judas his betraying him, to do what they designed at a time
when they did not design it, that so he might approve himself to be Christ our
Passover, as Saint Paul calls him; and the Lamb slain from the foundation of
the world in the Divine Decree; but not to be brought actually to the Slaughter
until this fullness of time.

For this reason it was that not a bone of him was ^^^ken, when the Theives who
were crucified together with him, not being yet actually dead, were dispated
this way; because a bone of the Passover was not t^ be broken; for this reason
he expired at the ninth hour that is, about three in the afternoon, the very
time wh^^ the Passover was to be killed; for this reason he came^ Jerusalem, as
Bochartus himself ingeniously and lear^ly observes, upon the tenth of Nisan,
the time wh^ the Passovers, according to the Law of Moses, were (...) be set by
for Sacrifices on the fourteenth; and for the same reason it was, as the same
Learned man conjectures that he began to preach in the thirtieth year of his
age (which being the perfect age of a man in his full strength and vigor,
answers to the Passover of a year old) and ^^ continued preaching till his
thirty fourth year, where if you take years for days, in the Prophetic style,
(...) entering upon his Preaching in his thirtieth year, will (...) as it were
his setting apart, in order to his being a Sa^^^fice in the thirty fourth.

Lastly, Our Savior himself expressly says, Matt. 26. v. 2. Ye know that after
two days is the feast of the Passover; and the Son of man is betrayed to be
crucified; because ^^ his Person and Sufferings at that time the meaning and
intention of all the Paschal Sacrifices under the Law ^^^ to be fulfilled.

Against so plain and so manifold evidence of Scripture to prove that our
Savior's Supper with his Disciples ^^^ the night before the Passover of the
Jews, there are ^^ three Places that I know of produced in favor of ^^^
contrary opinion, which if they had been so well ^^derstood as, I hope, they
will be hereafter, had, inste^^ of confirming that opinion, overthrown it.

The first is Matt. 26. v. 17. Now the first day of t^^ feast of
unleavened-bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where will thou
that we prepare for thee to eat the Passover?

The second is Mark 14. 12. And the first day of unleavened-bread, when they
killed the Passover, his disciples said unto him, Where will thou that we go
and prepare, that thou may eat the Passover?

The third and last place is that of Luke 22. 7. Then came the day of
unleavened bread, when the Passover must be killed.

In which Places, if those Learned men who have stood up in defense of the
Latin Church, had observed that upon this first day of Unleavened bread
(wherein the stress of their Argument lies) the Passover was to be killed, they
would then have concluded, that this first day could not be any of those seven
mentioned in Exodus, the first and last of which were to be an Holy
Convocation. For it was the day before the first of these that the Passover was
to be killed, that is to say, about three of the clock in the afternoon upon
the fourteenth of Nisan, whereas the Feast upon the Paschal lamb was to begin
upon the beginning of the fifteenth, which was at six of the clock that evening.

Besides, it is worth our while to observe the particular Phrases by which the
two latter Evangelists St. Mark and St. Luke have expressed themselves; in
which they killed the Passover, says Saint Mark, that is, when it was the
usual custom of the Jews to kill their Passover, which was, as I have said,
upon the fourteenth of Nisan, which answers to part of our months of March, and
April; but Saint Luke is still more express, (...), when the Passover must be
killed; or, as a man would express it in Latin, quo die solenne erat ex
proescripto Legis, ex instituto Mosis, ex Hebroeorum disciplina, ex proecepto
Dei ut mactaretur Pascha.

But then you will ask how it comes to pass, that the Parasceve, or Preparation
to the Passover is called the first day of unleavened-bread? to which I answer,
that, first, we may look upon it as a Roman way of speaking, of which there are
many in the New Testament, as there must needs be in the Language of those
times when Judoea was become a Roman Province, and so (...) is as much as (...)
as in Latin, Pridie calendarum is Primo die calendarum, that is, Primo die ante
calendas.

But this, though it cannot be denied by any that have a distinguishing palate
in these matters, to be a very plausible conjecture, yet I must confess
ingenuously, I do not think it to be true, and therefore I shall not stand upon
it.

That which I take to be the very truth is this, That upon this day the
Unleavened-cakes were made, and the Leaven purged out of all the Jewish houses,
in order to the Feast, which is the present practice of the Jews, as you may
see in Buxtorf, in his Synagoga Judaica; and to both of these it is that Saint
Paul alludes, 1 Cor. c. 5. v. 7. (...). Purge out therefore the old leaven,
that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. Ludovicus Capellus, in his
Epicrisis against Cloppenburge, somewhere observes, that the Leaven is usually
purged out of all the Jewish houses, by one of the clock upon the day of the
Preparation, which is two hours before the Passover was to be killed, and
therefore that day wherein this was done might well enough be called by a
Synecdoche of the part for the whole, the first day of unleavened-bread, not
because any Unleavened bread was eaten that day, but because upon that day it
was made in order to the Feast, and because after such a certain time there was
no Leaven to be found; to which purpose the words of Grotius upon Matt. 26. 17.
are considerable, Incipiebant autem Judoei locum in quo comesturi erant Pascha
parare ab ea nocte quoe antecedit solemn decimum quartum and pars est (...)
decimi quarti, quod nunc etiam faciunt; ejus proeparationis magna est pars
anxia (...), ad quam alludit Paulus, 1 Cor. 5. 7. solicit enim ea nocte and
antemeridiano tempore sequenti, inquirunt ecquid usquam fermentatum supersit,
etiam micas colligentes: and upon this account it is that Josephus in the Third
of his Antiquities, speaking of the Feast of Unleavened-bread, speaks of it in
the most proper acceptance of those words, for that Feast of seven days
continuance, wherein there was no Leaven to be touched or eaten; (...), says
he, (...) upon the fifteenth of Nisan, after the feast of the Passover follows
the feast of Vnleavened-bread, which continues for seven days. But in his
Second Book, speaking of the same Feast, he says, (...). We celebrate the
feast of Vnleavened-bread for eight days together. In which last place it is
manifest he must of necessity include the Preparation to the Feast as well as
the Feast it self, otherwise his eight days will want of their number.

Having thus vindicated these three Texts of the Evangelists, Saint Matthew,
Mark and Luke, from the false Interpretations which the Latin Church and their
Defendours, whether among themselves or of the Reformation, have made, and
shown that these very places do equally conspire with the rest to overthrow the
opinion of that infallible Dictatress, the Church of Rome, and of all that in
this particular have taken her part; I will now add one Text more to confirm
what has said, and then consider very briefly the Exceptions that have been
made, or rather the Evasions that are made use of to justify an indefensible
cause.

The place is Matt. 26. 18. And he (Jesus) said, Go into the city to such a
man, and say unto him, The Master says, My time is at hand, I will keep the
Passover at thy house with my disciples. Where the Reason given why he would
needs keep the Passover at this man's house was, (...) My time is at hand: lest
the Master of the house should wonder at his message, when the time of the
Passover was not yet come.

And now, having shown so plain and so unanimous a consent of the Evangelists,
as to the time of our Savior's last Supper, I am not obliged to expose all the
Evasions, in which the Patrons of the Roman opinion take shelter; yet, that the
thing may appear still more plain, and that I may not seem to avoid any
difficulty or any objection, I will consider a little Bochartus his Evasions,
meddling with others only so far as they are included in him, or borrowed by
him from them; for Baronius and Toletus have already been considered by Isaac
Casaubon, in his Exercitations upon the Annals of the former; and Cloppenburge
has been taken to task by Lud. Capellus.

To the first place of Saint John he answers, that (...), before the feast, is
as much as, (...), at the entrance upon the feast, or, in the beginning of it;
as (...) is a part of an Oration, (...) a part of an House, (...) a part of the
Tongue, (...) a part of the Hair, (...) a part of the Forehead, (...) a part of
a City, (...) a part of a Wall, and the like.

But supposing there were such a word as (...), which I believe it will be
difficult to find, yet I deny (...) and (...) to be the same; no more is (...)
and (...) and so in the rest of the Instances, the Preposition with the
Genitive case annexed being manifestly of greater latitude of signification than
any of the compound words. It is true indeed that Greg. Nazianzen has somewhere
put two such words together, as (...), but then he understands it not of the
beginning of a Feast, but of the day before it, which will not serve Bochartus
his turn.

Dr. Lightfoot, though with no better success, has denied that which ought
only to be denied, if any thing ought, and that is, that this Chapter of Saint
John does any way concern our Savior's last Supper with his Disciples: But if
you consider that this was that Supper from whence Judas went out to betray
him; that this was that Supper in which he preached Charity and mutual
Condescension to his Disciples; which he is found to do likewise in Saint
Luke's Gospel; that the story of that Supper which Dr. Lightfoot refers to is
manifestly contained in the twelfth Chapter of the same Gospel, and that it is
not likely we should have two several relations of the same Supper in two
several Chapters immediately following one another. Lastly, If you consider
that that expression which immediately follows those words, now before the
feast of the Passover, viz. when Jesus knew that his hour was come when he
should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which
were in the world he loved them unto the end, cannot so properly be applied to
any Supper as to his last, you will then easily conclude with me, and with
Grotius, who in this matter concurrs very strongly in opinion with me, that it
was indeed his last Supper, and that it could be no other.

To that Text of the same Evangelist, c. 18. v. 28. they themselves went not
into the judgment-hall lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the
Passover: he answers, after several others, that by the Passover is meant the
Chagigah, or Peace offerings, which were to be eaten together with the
Unleavened-bread for all the seven days of the Feast; but to this it is enough
to answer, that this is by no means the most natural and easy sense, and
therefore when there are other places which in their most genuine and first
acceptance do so unanimously conspire to prove the same truth, That our
Savior kept his Passover the night before the Jews observed theirs, it ought
by no means to be allowed; but yet (though I am not obliged to put the cause
upon this Issue, being supported by so many Authorities besides that of this
Text) if so much as one single place can be produced besides this which is in
question and must not therefore be alleged to justify it self, where the word
Pesach, or (...), in the singular number, is used for the chagigah, or
Peace Offering of any of the seven days of Unleavened-bread, then I will be
content to allow that Bochartus and those whom he follows in this particular
are in the right, notwithstanding that supposing the chagigah, or Peace
offering of the days of Unleavened-bread to be understood in this place by the
Passover, yet this would have been no reason of their not entering into the
judgment-hall, (...) that they might not be defiled.

For, in the first place, there was not that Purity required to the feeding
upon the chagigah, which was requisite for the Passover it self, and therefore
though the first and last day of the seven were a Sabbath and an Holy
Convocation, yet the other five days were not of a sabbatical nature, as you
may see plainly in Exodus, where the Institution of this Solemnity is
appointed; sed ita erant Festi, as Grotius expresses it, ut tamen essent ex
aliqua sui part (...), they were days of a middle state and condition between
the work of the week days and the Rest of the Sabbath; and if the later Jews
have taken so solicitous a care by the Rubric, as I may call it, of their
Calendar, to hinder the concourse of two Sabbaths together, of which I shall
speak more by and by, much less can we think, as indeed it is not possible to
be done, that either they or their Ancestors ever kept seven days together
with a sabbatical of observation.

But, secondly, it is agreed on all hands, If our Savior did not suffer upon
the Passover it self, yet that it was upon the first day of Unleavened-bread,
which being a Sabbath, and kept among the Jews with all the religion and
strictness that can be conceived, it would have been no reason of their not
entering into the judgment-hall, (...), that they might eat the Chagigah, but
that they might not be defiled upon the first day of Unleavened-bread, which
was so sacred among the Jews that there needed no other reason to make them
afraid of being defiled. From all which it follows plainly, that by the
Passover in this place, the Paschallamb in its utmost strictness and propriety
of acceptance is to be understood.

To the Text of c. 19. v. 14. and it was the preparation of the Passover, he
answers, that by (...), or the preparation, the Friday in every week was
ordinarily understood, which I should readily have granted him, though he had
not confirmed it out of Beresith Rabba and the Arabian testimony of Giauhari,
with which his admirable skill in Oriental Learning has supplied him; but that
the Passover, if it happened to fall upon a Friday, was ever called (...),
which is that which he and diverse others contend for, this is that which I
deny, because, first, it must be acknowledged to be precarious, having no
Authority of any Hebrew Calendar to vouch it; in the second, when the Friday is
called (...), it is an elliptical way of speaking, which must be supplied thus,
(...), and if it be asked, What is meant by those words? the answer will be
that, It is the day before the Sabbath; and so a man would think, by the same
way of construing, that (...) was the day before the Passover, and not the very
day of the Passover it self: but, thirdly, if the Jewish Calendar must be
called in to determine this important Question, which has exercised the wits of
so many Learned men, we may remember that, in the sixth of Saint Luke's Gospel,
there is mention made of the second Sabbath after the first, which in the Greek
is called, (...), and which, no question, was a day of special remarke in the
Calendar of those times; and, because it is very apposite to my purpose, after
the vain attempts of Scaliger, Cloppenburge, Capellus and Grotius, I will now
give a clear Explanation what is meant by it.

It is plain therefore that the Sabbath being a period or revolution of seven
days, the first Sabbath of Nisan must of necessity fall upon one of the days
inclusively of seven; and for the same reason the Passover, being a Feast of
seven days, it must always have a Sabbath for one of the number, which being
either the Passover it self, or one of the days of Unleavened-bread, it was
for that reason of greater Solemnity, because it was at once a commemoration of
the Divine Rest after the Creation of the World, and of his Goodness in their
Deliverance out of the Land of Egypt; and it had, besides the daily morning or
evening Sacrifice, the celebration of the Passover, or the Chagigah, into the
bargain, and this Sabbath is that which is properly called, (...), that is,
(...), or rather, (...), the second Sabbath after the first of Nisan, which
must of necessity fall either upon the Feast of the Passover it self, supposing
the first day of that month to fall upon the Sabbath, or else upon one of the
days of Unleavened-bread.

Now, if you consider how many places of Scripture there are, which have been
already produced, which do manifestly savor its falling upon the Sabbath that
year when our Savior suffered upon the Cross; if you consider what Solemnity
the conjunction of the Sabbath would add to that of the Passover; if you
reflect upon this, that no Execution could be done upon the Feast Day it self,
which was a Sabbath, in which it was not lawful to do any Work, Exodus 12. 16.
or for the Bodies of men to remain or be upon the Cross, Joh. 19. 31. and that
upon the first day of Unleavened-bread, in the morning, they that lived at a
distance from Jerusalem were used to repair to their respective homes, Deuteronomy.
16. 7. because it not being without great detriment to their affairs that many
of them were forced to repair from the uttermost parts of Judaea to Jerusalem,
while God by a Miracle preserved their Flocks and their Substance at home from
the Incursion of the neighbor Nations, Exodus, c. 34. v. 24. who, not being
miraculously restrained, would have made use of this occasion at once to enrich
and revenge themselves for the Injuries they had received, he was pleased, upon
so necessary an occassion, to dispense so far with the fabbatical Rest, as to
suffer every man to depart to his own home upon the first day of
Unleavened-bread, notwithstanding it had in other respects all the solemnity
and strictness of a Sabbath; by which means it would have come to pass, if our
Savior had been crucified upon that day, that he would not have been slain by
all the Congregation of Israel, as the Law required the Paschal-lamb to be.

Lastly, If you shall observe, what in this case is very material to be
considered, that if our Savior had not suffered upon the usual time, when the
Passover was to be considered, that if our Savior had not suffered upon the
usual time, when the Passover was to be killed, that is to say, upon the
fourteenth of Nisan, but upon the fifteenth, or upon the first day of
Unleavened-bread, he would not in this have represented the Passover, but the
Chagigah, or Peace Offering, of the days of Unleavened-bread, neither would he
so fully have answered the Legal Types, being no otherwise typify'd by the
Chagigah than he was by all Sacrifices whatsoever, which though they did all of
them point at that great Sacrifice, which was in the fullness of time to be
offered up once for all, yet the Passover, and the Sin and Trepass Offering
had some sort of pre-eminence above the rest in this umbratical designation, as
is manifest from his being called so frequently, the Lamb, and the Lamb of God,
and the Lamb without blemish, and Christ our Passover; and from his suffering
without the Gate, to answer the typical adumbration of the Sin offering which
was for this reason burnt without the Camp; certainly, from all this, you
cannot choose but see it absolutely necessary to confess, that on the year of
our Lord's Passion, the first day of Unleavened-bread and the Sabbath were co
incident with one another, and that the Sabbatum Deuteroprotum was always
either upon the fifteenth of Nisan or else inclusively from that to the one and
twentieth.

What the true meaning of this Sabbatum Deuteroprotum, or the second Sabbath
after the first, as we render it, should be, has been a Mystery which has been
hid from Ages, and which it is now my happiness, for the better adjusting the
true time of our Savior's Passion, and for the farther vindication of the
Scripture History, which receives at once light and credit by being solidly
explained, now first of all to discover.

Erasmus upon this occasion gives a pleasant Specimen of Monkish Ignorance, and
Saint Jerome, (so long ago have Learned men been ignorant of the true meaning of
this passage in Saint Luke) consulting Gregory Nazianzen upon this question,
was answered only with a Jest, instead of giving his opinion. De vocis (...)
interpretatione, says Grotius, dici ferme potest, quot capitatot sententioe.
Syrus and Arabs, Tanto quam nos sumus illi and seculo and loco propiores, satis
manifest ostendunt, se, quid hoec vox velit, ignorasse: and of this
disagreement among the Ancients, as to the meaning of this place, you may see
abundance more in Isaac Casaubon, in his fourteenth Exercitation against
Baronius.

Neither have any of those modern Writers, who have either occasionally or ex
professo inquired into this matter, succeeded any better than the Ancients have
done. Scaliger's conjecture, though approved by Casaubon and other Learned men,
and of which he was very fond himself, is yet, upon account of the harshness of
the composition, (which he, being so good a Grammarian, would have understood
had it been any man's conjecture but his own,) and for other very good reasons,
rejected by Grotius and Ludovicus Capellus.

Scaliger's Conjecture is founded upon Levit. 23. 15, 16. And ye shall count
unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the
sheaf of the wave offering: seven sabbaths shall be complete: Even unto the
morrow after the seventh sabbath, shall ye number fifty days, and ye shall
offer a new meat offering unto the Lord. From whence he would needs have it
that the Jews were used to count their Sabbaths to the Feast of Pentecost from
the second day of Unleavened-bread, after this manner, (...), etc. reckoning
from the (...), that is to say, the second day of unleavened-bread, but then it
should not have been (...) but (...), etc.

Secondly, (...) without an adjection would not, nor ever did that can be
proved, signify the second day of Unleavened-bread, but as they say, (...),
and in another place, (...), for the first day of unleavened-bread, and the
last day of the Feast, so if they had a mind to be understood, they must speak
out as plainly (...), otherwise, what second day, or what second thing, which
might be any thing with a seminine gender, was meant, it would be impossible
for any man to divine.

Thirdly, In the place upon which this Conjecture is founded, it is not from
the second day, but from the morrow; mimacharath, in the Hebrew; and in the
LXX. (...) so that it is plain, if they had followed either the original Hebrew
or the Translation of the LXX, with which they were better acquainted in those
days, and from whence they must have borrowed this way of numbering of their
Sabbaths, if any such thing had been, they would not have said, (...).

Fourthly, The Jews in this case did not count by Sabbaths, but by days; for
though it be true what Moses says, that from the morrow after the Sabbath,
seven Sabbaths were to be complete, yet when he speaks of the way of counting
these seven Sabbaths he says, v. 16. Even unto the morrow after the seventh
sabbath, shall ye number fifty days; and so the Jews at this day keep their
account, saying, the first after Omer, the second after Omer, etc. till they
come to fifty days, as Grotius upon this place-hath-observed.

Fifthly, and lastly, which I believe has not yet been taken notice of by any
other, though it be plain demonstration against Joseph Scaliger's opinion, he
proceeds upon a mistaken notion of the word Sabbath, which in this Text has
two significations, but neither of them such as will serve his turn: for when
it is said, from the morrow after the sabbath, by the Sabbath is understood the
first day of Unleavened-bread, which was, as has been shown, of a sabbatical
nature, let it fall upon what day of the week it would, and from hence they
numbered seven Sabbaths, that is, not seven Saturdays or Jewish Seventh-daies,
but seven times seven days; so as, if Scaliger's opinion be true, and if the
Sabbaths were to be counted after his manner, then it would not be always the
Saturday or Jewish Sabbath on which the Sabbatum Deuteroprotum would fall, but
upon any day of the week indifferently; so, as for example, if the second day
of Unleavened-bread were upon the Monday, then the next Sabbath after it,
excluding that day, that is, the next sabbatical Period of seven days would be
upon the Tuesday come seven night, and this, according to Scaliger; would be
the Sabbatum Deuteroprotum, and the Wednesday come six Weeks after would be the
day of Pentecost.

But now it is plain, that in that Instance of the (...), which the Gospel of
Saint Luke gives us, it is to be understood of the Saturday or of the Jewish
Sabbath properly and strictly so called, for otherwise the Cavil of the
Pharisees, instead of deserving that solid and judicious answer which our
Savior gives to it, would have been ridiculous, and would have needed no
answer at all, since a Sabbath in the meaning and sense of that place from
whence Scaliger borrows his Argument might have been understood of any day of
the week, let it be what it would, and though there were no manner of Sanctity
in it.

But if either Scaliger, had he been living, would have understood, or if any
now will needs understand for him, the word Sabbath of seven revolutions of the
Saturday or first day of the week, and will have it, that the day of Pentecost
was the day after the seventh or last of these, then let us suppose the
Passover it self to be coincident with the Sabbath, in which case the second
day of Unleavened-bread will be upon our Sunday, and upon the Monday come seven
weeks the fifty days will be complete, upon the Tuesday, the first day of the
Feast of Weeks or the first day of the Feast of Pentecost ought to fall; but in
regard there have not yet been seven revolutions of the Saturday come about, we
must stay yet five entire days longer, that is, five and fifty days, and the
first day of the Feast of Pentecost must always happen upon our Sunday, both
of which since they are very absurd and contrary to the express words of the
Law, which reckons but fifty days from the second day of Unleavened-bread, let
that day happen upon what day of the week it will, it is manifest what is
become of Scaliger's opinion, of which, as absurd as it is, Grotius was pleased
to say, Sententia ista magnis argumentis a suo Authore desensa est, that it was
defended by its Author by great and weighty arguments, though for some reasons
he thought it necessary to dissent from him; and Casauben, speaking of the same
Conjecture, says, Tantum dicam, Certum atque indubitatum sententioe Scaligeri
Fundamentum esse in verbis Mosis, Lev. 23. 15. that is, I will only say this,
that Scaliger' s opinion is grounded upon a certain and undoubted foundation of
Levit. 23. 15. for we have seen how sandy and infirm and rotten that foundation
is, and how unable it is to support that little building of a very small
conjecture, how great soever in the opinion of its Author, which Scaliger
would have built upon it.

Scaliger's pretended solution of this difficulty being thus confuted, though
in truth much the most ingenious and the nighest to truth of any which have
been thought of either before or since him by those who would pretend to
substitute a better in its stead: Grotius comes next to be considered, and his
solution is this,

That the Sabbath Day next before the Passover is at present called by the
Jews, Shabath hagadol, that is, the great Sabbath; and that sometimes the same
Sabbath is called also Shabath hagadol, that is, the great Sabbath; and that
sometimes the same Sabbath is called also Shabath harishon, the first Sabbath.
Now, says he, there being three great and solemn Feasts among the Jews, that
is to say, the Passover or Feast of Unleavened bread, the Feast of Weeks or of
Pentecost, and the Scenopegia or Feast of Tabernacles; it is but reasonable to
believe that the Sabbaths immediately preceding the two latter, had also some
pre-eminence above other Sabbaths, as well as that which was immediately
antecedent to the Passover it self; and so the order of these three great or
first Sabbaths will be thus;

The Sabbath before the Passover is, (...).

The Sabbath before Pentecost is, (...).

The Sabbath immediately preceding the Feast of Tabernacles is, (...).

This is as plain a representation as can be given of Grotius his opinion;
which after all is exposed to more and greater inconveniences than that of
Scaliger, which both he and Capellus have rejected.

For, First, granting him what he says to be true, That the Jews at this day
do call the Sabbath immediately going before the Passover Shabath harishon or
Shabath hagadol, the great or the first Sabbath; yet this is only (...), as
would have it, much less are there any footsteps of the (...) any where to be
found, which yet has as great a share in his solution as the other, so that
give him all that he desires himself, yet these two, and especially the latter,
are perfectly precarious.

Secondly, His argument proceeding from the names now in use in the Jewish
Calendars to those which obtained in our Savior's time, it is manifest that
this way of argumentation is perfectly fallacious, because if that ancient
Calendar had not been lost, there could have been no controversy about the
true meaning of the (...), and if it be perfectly lost, I do not understand how
any modern Calendar can help us out in a difficulty which none but the ancient
can determine.

But, Thirdly, if the Language of the modern Jews must be drawn into argument
in this case, yet it ought to be drawn no farther than it will go; and since
that has only pointed out one great or first Sabbath in the year, it is
unreasonable upon that authority to establish two other of which it is
perfectly silent, and which, as silent as it is, it does very strongly imply
that there were no other Sabbaths that went by this name, otherwise this
Sabbath would not have been called simply Shabath hagadol or harishon, but
Shabath hagadol harishon, the first great Sabbath, or Shabath harishon min
harishonim, the first of those Sabbaths which are called First.

Fourthly, It is unanswerable what Capellus objects against Grotius, that his
notion of the Sabbatum (...) makes the time of Wheat-harvest to fall much lower
than is consistent either with the custom of that Country or with the nature
of the soil, which is a great absurdity indeed; for certainly the Disciples
could not well pluck the ears of corn after the time of the Wheatharvest was
over.

Fifthly, and Lastly, I shall prove immediately against Grotius, that the Jews
in their ancient Calendar had a day which they were used to call the (...), or
first sabbath, but that it was not the first before the Passover, but the first
in Nisan, between which and the Passover there must always of necessity be one
Sabbath intervening.

Grotius being thus answered, Capellus, who has undertaken Grotius, comes next
in course to be confuted himself; and though not having his Book at present by
me, which it is many months ago since I read, nor being able to procure it, I
cannot so particularly determine what his Hypothesis is, yet this, as I
remember, is the foundation of it, that it depends upon the double account of
the sacred and civil year among the Jews, in respect of which Tisri, which
answers to part of our September, was the first month in one account, and Nisan
in the other; now if it can be proved, with the good leave of the Chronologers,
who are universally of another mind, that there was indeed no such difference
of account in the Jewish year, then Capellus his conjecture, which is founded
upon this difference, must of necessity fall to the ground.

There are but two ways that I know of by which this different account can be
rendered either probable or certain; it might be thought probable if any use of
such a difference could be known, but supposing that one year consisted of as
many days as the other, why may not one year serve all the purposes both of the
sacred and the civil account? and what then will a distinction of names
signify when the thing is the same?

It cannot certainly be proved, unless it be by the Testimony of Scripture
which is the only authentic Record in this case, and that is so far from
favoring this conceit of a double account that it will perfectly overthrow it.
For all the light we have from Scripture is no more than this, that whereas the
old year from the Creation began in Tisri or September, yet in memory of the
Deliverance of the Israelites from the Bondage of the Egyptians at that time,
they were from thenceforward ordered to change the beginning of their year, and
to look upon Nisan or Abib as the first month in the Hebrew Calendar; and
therefore, though in the History of the Flood Tisri is expressly called the
first month, yet after the institution of the Passover, whenever its order is
mentioned, it is called the seventh, but no where the first; neither was it
ever after this accounted the first month in any respect whether sacred or
civil.

To make this out more clearly, you may observe, that all the ancient
Chronology proceeded usually by the Lunar year, and from thence it is that the
Jews had no other name for a month but chodesh, from a word that signifies to
renew, which is a plain intimation that their months were measured by the
return of their new moons; in which case one of these three things was
necessary, either that their Feasts which were either upon their new moons, or
at such a certain distance from them, should run thorough all the seasons of
the year, or that in each month there should be some days added to make an
equation with the Sun's motion; or, lastly, that at the end of the year there
should be a Lunar month added to set the account even betwixt the Sun and Moon.

The first could not be, because there were some Feasts which could not be
celebrated but at such a season of the year; as the Feast of Weeks or
First Fruits after all their Harvest-work was over and their Corn inned into
their Barns; and the Feast of Tabernacles, after the gathering of their
Autumnal Fruits, which two could not possibly be kept at any other time than
about Midsummer and Autumn.

The second could not be, because this would disturb the observation of their
new moons, by the intercalation of one month's falling upon the new moon of
another; it remains therefore, that at the latter end of the year there was an
intercalary month, by which the equation between the two great movers was
preserved.

Since therefore it is clear that all the Hebrew months were Lunar, they having
no name for a month but what implies so much, one of these three things must
needs be granted; either that those things or actions which were used to
recurre at certain seasons with respect to the Sun, did yet notwithstanding
wander thorough all the Lunar months of the year, and did sometimes fall out in
this month, sometimes in that, and every year about a month different from the
other, so as in twelve years or thereabouts to run thorough the whole course of
Lunar months, or else there was a different way of intercalation in the civil
year from the sacred; or, lastly, there is no difference between them, but the
sacred and the civil years are, as they say, a distinction without a
difference, and words invented by Learned men to puzzle themselves instead of
informing the World.

For the first of these, since there was such a connection betwixt things civil
or secular and sacred as there was, and since they had such a dependence upon
one another, as the waving of the sheaf, which was always to be in Nisan, had
a dependence upon the earing and ripening of the corn, and the Feast of
Tabernacles or In-gathering upon the gathering of their autumnal Fruits, it
cannot be questioned but both of these were measured by the same common
measure; and to say otherwise is not only precarious, but also very
unreasonable, to think that people would perpetually trouble themselves with
two accounts crossing and disturbing one another to no purpose.

For the second, besides that it is precarious, and in a manner as troublesome
as the other, and that we have no names of months distinct from the Lunar,
there can hardly any other intercalation, besides that at the end of the year,
be supposed, unless it be an Embolism at the end of every month; which would be
to turn the Lunar into a Solar year without any ground, and contrary to the
notation of the word chodesh, and to make every Solar month in process of time
to travel thorough all the names of the Lunar, since every such month does
gain some ground upon them.

It remains therefore that this distinction is frivolous and impertinent, and
that there is no such real difference as is pretended betwixt the sacred and
the civil year.

And now, to confirm what has been said, I will do these two things: First, I
will show by another Argument drawn from the notation of an Hebrew word, that
the Lunary year was the only year in use among the Jews. Secondly, I will
answer such places of Scripture as I imagine may be urged in defense of this
double year.

And, First, for the Argument drawn from the notation, it is known very well
that in Greek one of the names of the M^on, from whence we have our English
word it self, as also that of Month derived from it, as the Latins have their
Mensis, and the Greeks their (...), is (...), which is without question from
the Hebrew word manah, numeravit; from whence also the Arabians with a Praefix
have their Almenick, or Almanak, as we are used to call an Ephemer is among us;
all which may be sufficient to convince us that the Jews had no way of
measuring the larger periods of time but by the motion of the Moon, by the
multiplication of whose circle so many times into it self, the Solar year was
made up, and not by twelve equal Sections of the Solar circle, which by reason
of their Feasts and Holy days depending so much upon the Moon, would have
brought all their Chronology into confusion; besides, that it is most natural
and therefore probably most ancient to measure the several periods of time, as
far as may be, by the perfect and entire motion of one of the Heavenly bodies,
as the natural day is measured by the Sun's diurnal circle; the month, by one
complete and perfect revolution of the Moon; and the year, by one entire
procession of the Sun thorough all the Signs of the Zodiak or Ecliptic, or by
the multiplication of so many Lunar intervals as are equal to that larger
circle which the Sun describes.

The places of Scripture that come at present to my mind from whence this
double account may seem to be justified are two; the first as long before the I
aw as the Creation it self: Genesis 1. 14. And God said, Let there be lights in
the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night: and years. Which
place, because it equally concerns the Sun and Moon, the two great Lights that
were at that time created, it may seem that there was always a different
account of the Solar and Lunar year, as old as the Creation it self; but to
this, an explanation of that Text is a sufficient answer.

Let them be for signs, LXX. (...) which is no question to be understood of
that use which the Judicial Astrologers are used to make of the several Aspects
and Configurations of the Heavenly bodies, as signs and tokens of future
events, not that they are so naturally in themselves, or that they are capable
of affording any such use; but that God in his Wisdom foresaw that this use
would be made of them by the vain curiosity of inquiring mortals, who will
needs be prying into those dark Mysteries of the Book of Fate, which all the
Stars of the Firmament can never enlighten.

By their being for seasons (lemohadim) two things may be meant, that is,
either to point out the solemn and religious Feasts, which all along in
Antiquity belonged to the Moon, or to distinguish the several quarters and
seasons of the year, which is the natural business of the Sun, and is for that
reason expressly attributed to him in Scriputre. So 2 Samuel 11. 1. and 1 Chronicles.
20. 1. And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when Kings
go forth to battle: in the Hebrew it is Leteshoubath hashanah, and Leheth
teshoubath hashanah; i. e. at the return of the year or of the Sun from the
vernal Equinox toward the Equator: And Exodus 34. 22. Vechag haasiph tekouphath
hashanah, and the feast of in-gathering at the years end, so we translate it;
but it should be, at the revolution of the year, that is, at the return of the
Sun from the Autumnal Tropic.

But these Lights were not only for Signs and Seasons, but also for days, and
years; both of which, though they may indifferently be measured either by the
Sun's motion or the Moon's, yet I conceive the earliest Antiquity as well in
their account of days as months had a particular respect to the motion of the
latter, and that this was one reason, besides what may be taken from the
History of the Creation, why they began their natural day in the evening, from
this Planet's having the dominion of the night; and as the month was made up as
I may say of Lunar days, so was the year of Lunar months, at least in process
of time, when for avoiding of confusion in their Chronological account the
motions of the Sun and Moon were adjusted and fitted to one another, as it was
by the intercalary month of the Jews, which they no question borrowed from the
neighbor Nations, among whom the Moon had the Government of their solemn
Feasts as well as among the Jews; otherwise, to speak properly, every entire
revolution of one of the Heavenly bodies is that which is called a year, at
least in the language of all the ancient World. For shanah in Hebrew, what is
it, but the repetition of the same motion in the same circle; and (...), is,
(...), because, in sese volvitur annus, as the Egyptians paint the year by a
Serpent whose tail is inserted into his mouth, to signify the ending of a
Planetary motion in the point where it began; and the Latin, annus, is nothing
but a great Ring or Circle, from whence the diminutive annulus is derived, and
may in its true signification equally belong to the revolution of a day, a
month, or a year; so that, for ought we know, shanim (years) in this place may
be but exegetical of jamim (days) that went before; from whence it is that
jamim in the Plural number does sometimes signify years as well as days, and
that the terms of a day and a year are in the Prophetic style are in a manner
convertible with one another. However it is certain, whatever the meaning of
this place be, that it has nothing to do with the distinction of the sacred
and civil year among the Jews, which depended upon a particular occasion, and
was two thousand years younger than the Creation.

But though this place cannot be of any moment in this controversy, yet there
is another which I shall now produce, that has a greater semblance of
argumentation in behalf of this double year, and that is Exodus 23. 16. Vechag
hahasiph betseth hashanah, we render it, and the feast of in gathering in the
end of the year; and the LXX. (...) now if Tisni, in which month the Feast of
In-gathering was to be kept, were the end of the year, it must also be the
beginning of it, because the year ends and begins together, as has been shown;
so that here we have plainly, after the Law was made, two beginnings of the
year, the one in Nisan, and the other in Tisri: but to this I answer,

First, That this cannot be, because in the sacred account, to which the Feast
of In-gathering must needs refer, Tisri was not the first month but the seventh.

Secondly, I take the liberty to say, That neither our Translatours, nor the
LXX. themselves have rendered this place as they should have done; for whereas
they have translated it in the end, they ought to have said in the beginning of
the year; not that there were two beginnings of the Jewish year; but because
the old year from the Creation began in Tisri; the Sun being supposed by
Antiquity first to have set out, when he began his course from the Autumnal
Tropic, and it is in allusion to this opinion, which the Jews and Chaldees
had, that this Expression is used, betseth hashanah, that is, not in the end,
but in the setting forth of the year or of the Sun; and so the Sun beginning to
run his everlasting course is compared Psalm. 19. 5. to a bridegroom coming out
of his chamber, and rejoicing as a Giant to run his race: where what we
translate, coming out of his chamber, is in the Hebrew, jotse michouphatho,
which is the very word used in the place of Exodus last cited. And so in that
place of Samuel already cited, the time when Kings go forth to battle is called
^eth tseth hamelachim, that is, the time not when they end, but when they begin
their expedition.

And thus, I hope, it is abundantly manifest that there were not two several
beginnings of the Jewish year, and consequently that the ground upon which
Capellus relies is utterly false and mistaken. But yet I cannot leave this
Discourse till I have observed farther that in that Text of the Psalms which I
have just newly produced, the way or path of the Sun is called orach, from
which word the Moon in Hebrew has its name jareach, because by her motion the
course of the year was observed; as Saturn is called (...), as it were (...),
there being very frequent commutations in all Languages of a Lene and an
Aspirate into one another, because he describes the largest circle and is
therefore the greatest measure of time; or else in the ancient Physiologie,
which I am very apt to believe, (...) in Greek, and Saturnus in Latin, were the
same with the Moon. (...) from the Hebrew keren cornu, from the horns of the
Moon, as they are used to be called by us and by the Latin Poets. Nec nova
crescendo reparabat cornua Phoebe.


And Saturnus, from sathar, latuit, because of its so often and so long
disappearing, from whence Italy was called by the Latin Poets saturnia tellus,
and in common speech latium, according to another known Verse of the same Ovid.
Dicta fuit latium terra latente Deo.
And that it may appear to be more than a fancy, that the Moon was called
jareach because the course of time was measured by her, you may observe farther
that the Greek and Latin (...) is exactly the same with the Hebrew orach, from
whence jareach is derived, and signified anciently not barely the four and
twentieth part of the natural day, as it does usually in the more modern
Writers, but any of the seasons or quarters of the year, as you may see it
proved by Isaac Casaubon, in his Animadversions upon Athenaeus. And I remember
somewhere such a Verse as this, it is either in Homer or the Anthologie, I know
not well whether, (...).


From hence also it was that the Moon was called by the Latins Diana, because
she had the dominion of the natural day among the Ancients which was reckoned
to begin in the evening, and by the Greeks (...), that is, either from two
Hebrew words erets and chamah, because she receives that light from the Sun
which is intercepted and obstructed by the Earth; or else from two Greek ones
which is more likely, (...), because she was the measure of time; for (...) in
the dorick Dialect is the same with (...) in the common, as (...) and (...) are
the same. (...).



Or, lastly, which I acknowledge to be most likely of all, though it do not so
much favor my opinion it may be, (...), from cutting the Air or Atmosphere, as
by the passage of the Clouds in a moon-shinynight the Moon seems to do with a
swift and hasty motion; from which as looking like a pursuit of some game, and
from the barking of Dogs, whether it be that they are pleased or offended at
her brightness, she was by the ancient Mythologists made to preside over
Hunting, and from thence it is that she is called Cynthia, that is, (...), and
Cybele, from the same Greek word compounded with the Phoenician bell, from the
Hebrew bahal; and Berecynthia, by adding to the former composition the Hebrew
barach, fugit, to denote the swiftness of her motion; from whence also one of
the names of the North Wind, Boreas, is to be derived, it being exactly the
Participle in Pohel, boreach; as Daniel Heinsius, in his Exercitation upon
Nonnus his Dionysiaca, has before me observed. And because it may seem harsh
and unusual to compound an Hebrew or Phoenician word with a Greek, though in
that there be no such absurdity that I know of, it is to be noted that (...) it
self, as being the Feminine of (...), is of Hebrew extract as well as the other
part of the composition; for (...) is from thohu, by which the primigenial Mass
is signified in the first Chapter of Genesis; from whence the Heathen Theology
derived all its Gods, as you may see in the Remains of Hesiod, Orpheus,
Epicharmus, Aristophanes, and others of the ancient Mythologers. From thohu is
the Phoenician (...) in Sanchuniathon; and from thence the Greek (...) or
(...), thau and sigma being easily changed into one another, as may be observed
from this, that there is a natural sibilus in each of them, wherefore the Jews
at this day, in their pronunciation of thau at the end of a word, do always
melt it into an s; and in this very word of which we are speaking it is
manifest that it has been subject to such a permutation; for what the common
Greek calls (...), that the laconick was used to pronounce (...) Hesychius,
(...) and so Sibulla is usually supposed to be composed of the laconick (...)
with the common Greek word (...) thus from the Greek (...) is the Latin
sepelio; from the Nominative case (...) the oblique (...) from (...), mare, the
Greek (...), and the Latin sal and salax; and as (...) is from thohu, so from
choshech in the same Chapter is that other Greek word in the ancient Mythologie
(...); and from tehom in the Hebrew the Greek (...); so as the true translation
of tehom rabah, the great abyss, would be in Greek by (...).

And now if we can but prove (...) to be as good Hebrew as the rest, the
business is done. That it is not a Greek word I am almost certain, there being
no word but (...) whence it can be derived, whose signification belongs but to
one sex, and that too in common with all other Animals whatsoever. We must take
notice therefore that the old Greek word was (...), from whence there still
remains the Plural Number (...), and the compound (...); for that what ever it
is, (...) Since therefore shacan in Hebrew is consedit, habitavit, (...)
according to this Etymology will be properly canis domesticus, a mastiff or
household dog; as among the Latins lar signifies both an house and the dog
that keeps it; whence the tutelar Deities of their houses were painted and
carved in the shape of Dogs, and latrare is quasi larrare, to make a noise
like a dog: but enough of this.

Having thus overthrown the Conjecture of Capellus as well as of those other
Learned men that went before him, I will now, to establish mine own opinion
upon a certain bottom, produce a fragment of Saint Peter out of Clemcns
Alexandrinus, which whether it be genuine or no is very ancient, as being to be
found in all the Copies of Clemens, and therefore is of greater authority than
any modern Conjecture whatsoever.

The place of Clemens is this, Strom. l. 6. speaking of the Jews, (...), Unless
the moon appear they never celebrate that sabbath which they call the first,
that is, this Sabbath, as all other Feasts, is regulated by the Phasis of the
Moon: it seems therefore there was a Sabbath among the Jews which was called
(...), the first sabbath: wherefore it having been proved already that they had
but one beginning of their year in Nisan; and it being farther clear that they
reckoned their years by months, and their months by new mons, this first
Sabbath can be no other than the first after the New Mood of Nisan; but in
regard the reason of this change of the beginning of the year from Tisri to
Nisan depended upon the Deliverance of the Israelites from under the Egyptian
Bondage, which happened upon the fifteenth of Nisan, therefore this day in some
sense might be called the beginning of the year, and the Sabbath coincident
with it, or following next after it, (...), that is, (...), or (...), or (...),
the second first sabbath; as in a different respect we may call the Sunday
incident upon the first of January or next after it, the first sunday; and that
upon the five and twentieth of March or next after it, the second first sunday;
and this is somewhat like that notion which Epiphanius had of this word, for he
makes it be the second of two Sabbaths, the one of which is a legal Sabbath,
that is, any Feast day; the other a natural, by which he means the Saturday
Sabbath, which was instituted from the Creation: but here is the fault of that
solution, that he makes it to be no certain day in every year, but only casual
or once in so many years, lighting upon the concourse of two such Holy days
together; the latter of which though it be in order second, yet it is in nature
and dignity first; the same inconvenience does likewise attend the solution of
St. Chrysostom, which in other respects is not so good as that of Epiphanius;
but of all men, unless it be those that have acknowledged their ignorance, who
yet in this are to be commended for their ingenuity, Isidorus Pelusiota has
betrayed the greatest want of skill and judgment in this affair; for he makes
the (...) to be (...), the second day of the passover, but the first of
unleavened-bread, which is impossible and absurd.

Thus have I after the unsuccessefull attempts of so many Learned men, as well
ancient as modern, evidently explained what is the meaning of (...), without
supposing any thing which is precarious or which does not sufficiently prove it
self.

And since the first sabbath, as it was called, was a day of more than ordinary
Festivity, as may be seen by those words of Clemens, (...) in Greek being a
word peculiar to Festival solemnities, as agitare is in Latin, it is but
reasonable to suppose that the sabbatum deuteroprotum or second first sabbath
was likewise used to be celebrated with the same Joy and Ceremony with the
other, as having its name from its relation to it, and being in the sense I
have explained a first sabbath as well as the other, it being the Anniversary
of that day upon whose account the order of the months was inverted, and
therefore indeed had rather a better right to challenge all the solemnity of a
Feast Day than the other.

Again, Since it was so that the sabbatum deuteroprotum must of necessity fall
upon one of the days of Unleavened bread, and since the Solemnity would be
much greater if it fell on the first, which was the (...) of the Passover it
self. Lastly, Since Christ by this means would in the most signal manner
imaginable fulfill the typical adumbration of the Passover, if he died upon the
parasceve of the first day of Unleavened-bread, coincident with the Sabbath,
which was the most solemn Passover that could be conceived; it is manifest from
all this, that all these things do mutually confirm and strengthn one another,
that the sabbatum deuteroprotum was always the third Sabbath in Nisan, that it
fell upon the year of our Savior's Passion upon the day of the Passover it
self, and that our Savior celebrated his last Supper with his Disciples the
night before the Jews were to celebrate their Paschal-feast.

The last place which Bochartus endeavors to evade is that of Joh. 19. 31. For
that sabbath day was an high day, which I have already occasionally considered,
and proved against him out of his own authorities how widely he is mistaken: I
will now only add to what has been said already the authority of that place
of Clemens Alexandrinus, who goes on thus, speaking still concerning the Jews,
(...) that is, that without the phasis of the moon, they neither celebrate a
new mood, nor the days of unleavened-bread, nor any feast nor high-day: from
whence it is evident that every Holy Day is not properly, in the hellenistical
Language, (...), a great or high day, which is distinguished both from the
New Mood, and from a Feast in the general considered, and from the days of
Unleavened-bread, so far as their (...), as I may so call it, or their
unleavenedness, is only to be considered; but when such a day is coincident
with the Passover it self, as the first day always is, and when upon the
seventh there is a more than ordinary Festivity, a Sabbath, and an
Holy-convocation, this is that which makes the (...) otherwise though it may be
jom tob, dies genialis, a day of public joy and gladness, yet it is not a
great or high day.

It being so undoubtedly clear that our Savior's Passover was celebrated the
night before that of the Jews, and it being unlawful to sacrifice the
Paschal-lamb at any time but on the fourteenth of Nisan between the two
evenings, this has afforded new matter for the Wits of Learned men to exercise
themselves upon to find out an expedient whereby to make it appear lawful to
sacrifice the Paschal-lamb, which they suppose to have been eaten at this last
Supper by our Savior and his Disciples.

There are some that will needs have recourse to certain Talmudical Canons for
the more orderly and regular observation of the Jewish Feasts; and the rule of
the Passover they tell us was Badu, that is, that if the Passover happened to
fall upon the second, fourth or sixth day of the week, it was transferred to
the next day following, especially on the second and sixth, to hinder the
concurrence of two Sabbaths together; this was the opinion of Munster in his
Annotations and in his Kalendarium Hebraicum, and of Zegerus in his Notes upon
the New Testament, and of Edvardus Liveloeus, an English man, once Fellow of
Trinity College, and Hebrew Professor of the University of Cambridge, in a
Chronological Disputation upon this Subject against Cardinal Toletus; and,
lastly, of Isaac Casaubon who follows the other in his Exercitations against
Baronius.

But though it must be acknowledged that such Talmudical Canons there were, yet
it is equally true that they are of much later date than our Savior's time,
when they were used, (and for a long time after,) to celebrate the Passover
indifferently upon any day of the week, though it should so happen that the
Sabbath should be the day before it or the day after, as has been proved by
undeniable Testimonies from the Talmud and the Jewish Rabbis by Joannes Coch
of Bremen in his Notes upon the Massecheth Sanhedrin, and after him by Dr.
Cudworth in his Learned Treatise of the Sacrament, but most particularly of all
by Bochartus who has confirmed the Jewish Authority by the concurrence of
Christian Writers both Greek and Latin, and by the Practice of the
Tessarescaidecatitae, who, in imitation of the Jews, were used to observe their
Easter not only upon the Sunday, but upon any day of the week on which the
fourteenth day of the month should happen to fall; nay, so little did they
scruple the concurrence of two Sabbaths together by the Passovers being either
the day before or the day after the Seventh-day Sabbath, that in the Mishna in
Pesachim we have an express provision in that case as to the time when the
daily Evening-sacrifice is to be killed, c. 5. Chal hereb pesach lehijoth
behereb shabath, etc. that is, If the evening of the passover shall fall upon
the preparation of the sabbath, then the daily evening-sacrifice must be killed
at half an hour past six, that is, with us; at half an hour past twelve, and it
must be offered up at half an hour past seven, or, as we would say, at half an
hour past one: and Epiphanius in his solution of the sabbatum deuteroprotum, of
which there has been so much discourse already, does manifestly suppose the
concurrence of two Sabbaths sometimes among the Jews, and so does S. Chrysostom
and Isidore likewise; which solutions of theirs though they have been already
considered and exploded, yet if no such concurrence had been ever known, they
had not only been false in themselves, but also built upon a false foundation.

The reason why these Learned men, who have stood up in defense of the
Talmudical Canons, have made the difference between our Savior's Supper and
the Jews to arise from thence was this, that so it might appear that our
Savior did celebrate his Passover upon the legal day, whereas the Jews, being
governed rather by the Traditions of their Masters than by the Law of Moses, to
avoid the concurrence of two Sabbaths (the Passover that year, as they tell us,
happening upon the Friday) transferred it to the next day, and so made a
coincidence of the Passover and Sabbath together, but how indefensible this
opinion is we have abundantly seen, and I account my self not a little happy,
that, after the gleanings of so many Learned men, I have been able to confirm
the truth by some new authorities not taken notice of by them.

The second Expedient thought of by Learned men for the solution of this
Difficulty is this, that both our Savior and the Jews celebrated their
Passover upon the legal time, to the best of their understanding, on both
sides, but that they only differed in their way of computation; our Savior he
went more exactly to work, and computed his Passover from the (...) or
astronomical conjunction of the Sun and Moon, while the Jews, not being it
seems so good Astronomers, proceeded only by the sensible phasis, which was
about a day after; but to this though it may be sufficient to answer with
Bochartus, that all this is gratis dictum and fine ullo test vetustatis, that
it is spoken without any the least color of authority to vouch it; yet it is
farther true that Maimonides does expressly affirm that it was a Tradition of
Moses from Mount Sinai that they should compute their New Mons by the phasis,
and that as long as the Sanhedrin lasted, and all the while the Doctors of the
Mishna and the Gemara lived till the days of Abijah and Rabba, they had no
other way of computation; and so it is also expressly asserted in that passage
of Clemens Alexandrinus, of which I have already made so much use, (...), etc.
that the Jews never celebrate any of their feasts or solemn days but they
compute them from the phasis of the moon.

The third Expedient is that of Ludovicus Capellus, who pretends, as I
remember, to solve the difficulty by the Embolism or Intercalation of a day at
the end of the month foregoing, which being observed by the Jews, but not by
our Savior, makes the Jewish Passover a day later than his: but to this though
we may answer as to the former, that it is perfectly precarious, it is only
faid and not proved; yet there is one place of Scripture yet behind, which will
serve for a sufficient Confutation of all these three Expedients, it is Joh.
13. 29. when Judas went out to betray his Master, it is said of his fellow
Disciples, that some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had
said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast: which
Feast, if it be meant of the Passover, as it can be meant of no other, then we
have here an express Testimony of the Disciples themselves, and certainly that
is as good authority as can be produced, that the Passover was not yet come:
For as for those that expound it of the Chagigah, they do not consider that
upon the first day of Unleavened-bread, as this must be, if it were not the day
before, it was unlawful either to buy or sell.

But, besides these three, there has another way been thought of, as
insufficient in my opinion as any of the former; and that is, that as the Jews
now adays do use to keep the fifteenth and sixteenth of Nisan both of them
with a Paschal solemnity, that they may be sure to avoid a mistake as to the
time of the conjunction of the two Heavenly bodies, so from thence there are
some that will needs infer that this was the ancient practice, and, at that
rate, that night when our Savior supped with his Disciples was no less the
Passover night than that which followed it. But first, it is to be considered,
that there is no testimony of antiquity that can be produced to prove that this
was the ancient practice, and therefore it is precarious. Secondly, The ancient
Jews, if they did practice it, yet the practice of the modern can be no
argument to prove it, because what they do is propter dubium conjunctionis
luminarium, as Scaliger observes, whereas the Ancients went altogether by the
Phasis Thirdly, Maimonides observes that even in old time those Jews that were
in captivity, or lived in foreign Countries, were used to observe two days
together, because they could not certainly tell what day the Sanhedrin at
Jerusalem had consecrated for the New Mood: But as this exception is an
argument that it was not the general practice, so the reason given of it
proves, that at Jerusalem this custom never obtained; for there they could not
be ignorant what day the Sanhedrin had pitched upon. Fourthly, When the Friday
on which our Savior suffered is called by Saint John, (...), the preparation
of the Passover, it is certain it could not be the Passover it self, for the
preparation was only in order to it, and was of necessity a day before it.
Fifthly, The place of St. John which I have produced upon the former head is
every whit as good an argument upon this for had that day upon which Judas went
out to betray his Lord been a Passover as well as that which followed next
after it, certainly the Disciples could never have been so silly and so
ignorant of their own customs and Nation, and of the Law of Moses, as to
suspect he was gone to buy any sort of provision at a time when nothing could
either be bought or sold. Sixthly and lastly it is an unanswerable argument
against this and all other ways of making our Savior's Supper a properly
Paschal or Sacrificial Feast, that He himself was that Lamb of God whom all the
mosaic Passovers represented; and that he might unquestionably approve himself
to be so, and unexceptionably fulfill the legal Types, it was necessary that he
should suffer at the true time when the Passover was to be killed, and
therefore that true time could not possibly be come when he supped with his
Disciples: So that it being clear that our Savior and his Disciples: So that
it being clear that our Savior and his Disciples neither did nor could partake
of the Paschal Lamb, properly so called, the question is what manner of
Passover it was which he celebrated with them, and I answer that it was that
which Grotius calls the mnemoneutical or commemorative Passover; and if you
would know what manner of Passover that was, you may consult Buxtorf, in his
Talmudical Lexicon, under the word Aphicomen, and in his De Coenoe Dominicie
ritibus and forma, and Scaliger in his De Coenoe Dominicie ritibus and forma,
and Scaliger in his sixth De emendatione temporum: I will not insist upon it at
present in this place, having done it already very largely in some other Papers.

THE PREFACE TO THE READER.
IF the usefulness of these Discourses will not fpeak their Apology,
notwithstanding they are so little of kin to any thing of a Sermon, which was
the only occasion of their writing, then I shall be at a loss for any other
defense, and must submit upon discretion to the censures of my Readers, who are
my proper Judges, and from whose sentence there lies no farther remedy or
appeal.

I did not till very lately intend to publish the first of these Discourses,
but because I find I have referred to it in the latter, (if it may be called
the latter, for they are indeed all but one, and the reflection upon this will
do a kindness to several passages which may otherwise seem absurd) therefore I
have persuaded it to come abroad, lest otherwise you might think me to be
haunted with feverish Apparitions, and to refer to things that were not in
rerum natura; or lest you should chance to loose your way when you are so
obligingly disposed as to design me a Visit, and for More-fields, instead of
St. Thomas, mistaking one sort of Hospital for another.

I have nothing farther to add, but that if you will pardon these digressions
for this once, I will engage to you solemnly and verbo sacerdotis, which was a
very sacred way of plighting Faith, before the discovery of the Popish-Plot, to
be more close and pertinent for the future; and if what I have done already may
have the good Fortune to meet with candid acceptance, it will give me
encouragement as well to finish with cheerfulness and Vigor, what is now upon
my hands, as to launch out farther into new designs, for the improvement of
Learning, and for the good of the World.

Farewell.
THE first Exercitation being but very short, and having but few particulars,
needs no particular Enumeration of the Contents. The Contents of the Second are
as follows.

THE CONTENTS.
ABen Ezra accusing the Samaritans of Worshipping Ashima, is guilty either of
an Equivocation or a downright falsehood, Page 199. Asima, what, ib. The Secret
of the Tetragrammaton not unknown to Christ according to the Author of
Toledoth Jeshu, which seems to be confirmed by a testimony of Suidas, but
nothing can be safely affirmed or denied upon such testimonies as these, 200
Our Savior could not belong properly to the Aaronical or Jewish Priesthood,
being not descended of the Tribe of Levi, otherwise than by the Mother's side,
ib. The Testimony of Philo Judaeus concerning the Tetragrammaton produced, and
proved from it that Philo Judaeus had not read the Original Book of Moses
himself, upon which that Testimony pretends to rely, 200, 201. The Testimony of
Josephus concerning it produced, 201. From whence it appears plainly that
Josephus was not acquainted with the four lettered name of God, as that name is
represented in its Hebrew form and appearance, 202. (...) in the citation of
Josephus are Vowels properly so called in opposition to Consonants, or mute and
unsounding Letters proved against. Jos. Scaliger, ib. The name of God according
to Josephus in this place can be nothing else but (...). ib. A Second place of
Josephus concerning the ineffable or unutterable name of God, 202, 203. Two
Reasons why it came to be so great a secret even among the Jews themselves,
203. First Reason, the General Reverence which has prevailed in all Nations
for the name of God, in so much that even among the Heathens themselves they
were used to omit his name even at that very time when they Swear by it, saying
only in an Elliptical way, (...) and (...). Pindar, Aristophanes, and the
Anthology explained; 203, 204. The Second Reason, of the Jewish ignorance of
this Sacred name to be taken from the Version of the 70. who have rendered it
by (...) without any where mentioning the name it self, 204, 205. But though
Josephus were himself ignorant of the true Pronunciation of this name, yet from
what he has said there is sufficient light afforded to discover it, 205, 206.
The Second Testimony of Josephus resumed, and that he speaks there of the Ehjeh
Asher Ehjeh, which was that name of God in which Moses delivered his Message to
the King of Egypt, 206. (...) ib. The same with Ehjoh, which is afterward
proved to have been the old punctation, 207. (...) has but three Letters
whereas Ehjoh has four, and why, ib. The reason given for it confirmed by the
Authority of Bochartus in a resembling instance, ib. Neither the Javoh of
Bochartus nor the Jahoh of St. Jerome were the true and ancient pronunciation
of the Tetragrammaton, 207. Which is still farther confirmed, 208. Ad calcem
page The Tetragrammaton consisted exactly of the same Letters in St. Jerome' s
time with (...) of our Masoret^^^al Bibles, and that the Procopian (...) read
backwards according to the Eastern mode, in the same, p. 207, 208. The
interpretation of (...), as it is corruptly read for (...), in Clemens Alex.
answers to that Etymon of it which I have assigned, p. 208. The particular
reasons assigned why neither Bochartus his Etymon of (...), nor that of St.
Jerome, are to be admitted, ibid. As (...) is Ehjoh, so is (...) Jehvoh, and
this is that name of God expressed in Greek characters which Josephus affirms
to have consisted of (...), four Vowels, 209. (...) is from Hajah, with a Jod,
(...) from Havah, with a Vau, both signifying the same thing, ibid. (...), for
(...), ibid. The punctation of the future tence of Havah and Hajah, by a Cholem
instead of a Segol, very ancient, as is proved by several instances out of
Plautus his Paenulus, 209, 210. The affinity, and in a manner sameness, of the
Hebrew and Punick Language, ibid. Several other considerations to confirm the
same punctation and first, from the testimony of a place of Theodoret, 210,
211. The punctation by a Cholem is confirmed by the custom of the Ancients in
their adoration of a Sneeze, Xenophon and Plato explained, 247. A Sneeze why
used and consulted in Divination, the Anthology, Propertius, Catullus,
explained, 247, 248. A third reason by which the same punctation is confirmed
taken from the seven lettered name of God in the Oracle and in the Anthology,
249. Scaliger mistaken in several instances, ibid. The seven lettered Name of
God so called by the mistake and ignorance of the Greeks was the (...) and the
(...) joined together, ibid. This conjecture farther vindicated against a
possible exception, and the gross error of Bochartus discovered, 249, 250. God
is not only called Ehjoh and Jeh voh but Jah, which was a name of God as
sacred, peculiar and incommunicable as the other, 250. Proved out of Symmachus,
the quinta Editio, and the LXX. themselves in their (...), that this was the
ancient and true punctation, ibid. It is owing to the same root with the other
two, and its analogy cleared, ibid. An objection against the punctation of the
name Jah considered and answered, 251. The place of Theodoret farther
considered, ibid. (...), the error of Haeschelius, ibid. (...), Jugum, (...),
jaloux, jealous, Pherecydes Syrius explained, ibid. (...) and (...) in
Alexander Trallianus, whence, 251, 252. Pharaoh, Pharaoth, Pharaothes,
Phraates, ibid. Abraxas, the God of the Basilidians, who, and why so called,
and the Abracadabra in Serenus Sammonicus explained, 252. (...), Juno, (...),
what and whence, 253. (...), from Jah, Jupiter, q. Jouipiter, from the
Imperative Joh, the same with Jah, the conjecture of Cicero, Agellius and
Lactantius concerning the name Jupiter rejected, ibid. As also the Jovis pater
of the Moderns, ibid. (...), 254. Lucilius explained, and the reading of the
present Copies vindicated against Mr. Seldom and Dousa, ibid. Nomen in Lucilius
what, ibid. Pater and Genitor the common Epithet of all the Heathen Gods, 254,
255. Apollo, why so called, 255. Apella, (...), Horace explained, ibid. Baal
Peor the same with Priapus according to St. Jerome and Isidore, ibid. But this
not approved by Mr. Seldom, 256. The true Etymon of Priapus proved out of
Isidore, and the false one of Dionysius Vossius refuted, (...), 256. Priapus
why made to preside over Ports as well as Gardens, ibid. (...), who, ibid.
Salax, whence, ibid. Portunus, Neptunus, a portubus, navibusque tuendis, ib.
(...), vox nihili, and the conjecture of Plutarch concerning the Etymon of
Neptune rejected, ibid. (...) and (...), Navius and Nevius the same name, ibid.
The Heathen Deities not only called Patres and Genitores, but also (...),
Reges, and both of these comprehended in the Tetragrammaton of the Hebrews, and
in the (...) of the LXX. 257. But the title of (...) most proper to the supreme
Numen, or him who was accounted the Sovereign of the Gods, ibid. Molech,
Moloch, Milcom, Anamelech, Adramelech, who, and why so called, ibid. Annibal,
Asdrubal, whence, ibid. Adrumetum and Atramyttium, as much as Adir Mot, and the
conjectures of Drusius, Isaac Casaubon and Bochartus himself exploded, from 257
to 260. (...), in the Phenician Language the same with the English Mud, 258. It
is made probable from Bochartus that the Phenicians traded hither, and the name
Britain is originally Punick, ibid. The mistake of Bochartus as to the
signification of the Hebrew word Chatsar, 258, 259, 260. Adir, a Phenician
word, proved from Priscian and Saint Austin. 260. Philo Judaeus vindicated
against Joseph Scaliger, and the word (...) or (...) farther explained, 260,
261, 262. (...), palus, 261. Tehom, (...), what, ibid. The mistake first of
Philo Judaeus, and then of the Jewish Rabbi^^, as to the Etymon and
signification of Cherub, or Cherubim discovered, and the true meaning of that
word vindicated and explained, 262, 263. Another indication of the punctation
of the Digrammaton by a Cholem, from the Io of the Latins, and the conjecture
vindicated from the inscription upon the Numisma of Abraxas, together with a
farther confirmation of my conjecture concerning the seven lettered Name of
God, 263. Mr. Selden' s conjecture concerning Juba the Mauritanian God
confirmed, and shown how by analogy it may be reduced to the Tetragrammaton, or
indeed is of it self the same with it, 263, 264. (...) and (...) or Deus the
same, 264. The Tetragrammaton no such secret among the ancient Jews, as it has
been usually represented to be, proved from Mr. Seldom, 264, 265. Neither was
name Jehvoh only known to the Gentile World, but also that of Ehjoh too, being
both of them from the same root. 265, 266. The Rabbis beholding to the
Septuagint for their punctation of Jehvoh by the points of (...), 266. The
superstition of the LXX. themselves in not delivering these names of God, viz.
Jehvoh, Ehjoh, and Jah, by their own proper Letters and Vowels, (...), ibid.
The Tetractys of the Pythagoreans, not the same with the Tetragrammaton of the
Jews, ibid. No mystery in the number Four, nor any thing more incommunicably
sacred in the name Jehvoh, than in that of Ehjoh or Jah, 267. The Rabbis
called the incommunicable name in its original, Shem Shel Arbah Othijoth, but
this was borrowed by them from the Greeks, who understood it, as has already
been proved, only of (...), that is to say, of that name as revealed to the
Gentile World, not as kept secret from it, 267. The time of Pythagoras compared
with that of Sanchuniathon, and shown that so long before his time, as the
latter was elder than the former, the name (...) was no such secret even to the
Gentile World. ibid. Nay that it was much earlier abroad than the time of
Sanchuniathon, who was contemporary with Gideon, is proved from what has been
said before, 268. Nothing but want of skill in Grammar which made the
Tetragrammaton and the Tetractys confounded together, ibid. The Tetractys
explained what it is, 268, 269. And that explanation confirmed out of a place
of Lucian in his (...). 269. The analogy and reason of the word (...) explained
and demonstrated out of a place of Homer, and the meaning of the (...) in the
Pythagorick School, 269, 270. The Pythagoreans swearing by their Tetractys, no
argument that it was the same with the Tetragammaton, ibid. The number four, as
has been already declared, had no mystery among the Jews, and the name
Tetragrammaton invented by the Greeks long after the time of Pythagoras, so
that he could not allude to it, 271. Neither did the Jews ever swear by the
number Four, but Seven, and why, ibid. Nishbah, Shebouah, what they signify,
and several Passages belonging as well to the History as Dispensation of the
Jews explained from this observation, 271, 272. Particularly the reason of the
Rite of Circumcision is from thence largely explained, and the opinion of
Grotius confuted, together with that of Maimonides, with whom Grotius concurs
in his judgment, both being beholding to a passage in Aristotle, who giving the
reason why children among the Greeks were usually named upon the seventh day,
was himself very grossly and palpably mistaken, from 272 to 275. (...), what it
signifies in the old Scholiast upon Homer, shown by comparing it with that upon
Apollonius, the Writer of the Argonauticks, 275, 276. My notion of the
Tetractys farther confirmed, 276, 277. The Pythagoreans were used also to swear
by their Master Pythagoras, as believing him from the Stories which he related
of himself, and which were told concerning him to be a divine and self-existent
person, and how ridiculous and impossible those Stories were, 277, 278. The
same was likewise true of Empedocles, Epimenides, and Abaris, three Disciples
and followers of Pythagoras, that they also pretended to Divinity as well as
he, 278, 279. And of Apollonius Tyaneus, a professed Pythagorean, who lived long
after them in the time of Domitian, ibid. And had the honor afterward to be
worshipped in the Lararium of Alexander Severus, ibid. The symbolick meaning of
Pythagoras his golden Thigh considered, from 279 to 292. The Thigh a symbol of
fruitfulness and generation, proved out of Heinsius in his Aristarchus, 279,
280. Bacchus thence said to have been taken out of Jupiter' s Thigh, that is no
more than to be the son of Jupiter: (...), the ignorance and pedantry of the
Greek Grammarians, 280, 281. Two places of Scripture proposed concerning
Eleazar' s laying his hand upon the Thigh of Abraham, and Joseph upon that of
Jacob by way of adjuration, together with the reasons of this custom assigned
by Sebastian Munster, R. Solomon, Aben Ezra, P. Fagius, and H. Grotius, 281,
282. An account why Munster' s is insufficient, 282. R. Solomon mistaken in
matter of fact, 282, 283. The reason of Aben Ezra perfectly precarious and
without any shadow of ground, and that of P. Fagius, besides that it is
precarious as the former, not comprehensive enough to give an account of the
universal obtaining of this custom in all the Eastern Countries, 283, 284.
Besides the authority of Aben Ezra there is a citation produced out of
Busbequius to prove that this custom did universally prevail, and that it is
still in use among the Turks in the civilities of conversation. From the
citation of Busbequius in concurrence with Aben Ezra three observations are
raised: 1. That the laying the Hand upon the Thigh was all over the East
accounted a token of high respect: 2. That the outward expressions by gesture
of civil respect and divine worship are the same, being generally the same in
all Ages and Nations: 3. The mistake, or as it seems wilful error of Josephus
in relating the story of Abraham and Eleazar is represented, and a warning
given not to rely too securely upon his authority without farther testimony
from the probability of things and the concurrence of other Writers, especially
the sacred and canonical, from 284 to 288. The reason assigned by Grotius for
this custom considered and refuted, 288. The true reason of this custom
explained, that it includes an appeal to the maker of all things, the first
cause of all vital faecundity, and in whom as in the common Parent, the seeds
of all other vitalities or existencies are contained, and as in religious
worship in includes an appeal, an invocating or an imprecation, so in civil
conversation it includes a prayer to the same being, in whom are the Issues of
life and death, for the health and safety of that person to whom this respect
is paid, which was the reason also in civil salutation of laying the hands to
the breast, by way of appeal to the searcher of hearts that we do inwardly wish
the health and peace of our Brother to whom we address our selves with this
formality of salutation, 288, 289. The signification of Tachath in Hebrew, and
of (...) in the Hellenistical Language reconciled to the present usage of the
Turks of laying their hands upon, not under the Thigh, 289. Several other
places of Scripture produced to prove that the Thigh or the Knee, was a symbol
of generation, 289, 290. The reason of taking hold of the Knees in
supplication. (...), etc. Seneca in Troade, explained, 290, 291. The reason of
bowing the Knee either in Divine Worship or civil conversation explained, 291.
All this applied to Pythagoras his golden Thigh, and it is extremely probable,
if not absolutely certain, that the golden Thigh was intended for a symbol of
Divinity, the fruitfulness of the Divine nature being denoted by the Thigh, and
by its being made of Gold the stability and eternal firmitude of that
fruitfulness was represented, 291, 292. Pythagoras though he received not his
Tetractys from the Jewish Tetragrammaton, yet is he not to be denied to have
had some acquaintance with the Jewish Nation and affairs, and that he had
considerable acquaintance with them both is probably asserted from the
testimony of several Authors, and especially Porphyry in his Life, 292, 293.
Zabratus the Babylonian, Nazaratus, Zaran, Zaratas, Zaradas, all the same, 293,
294. Abraxas, the God of the Basilidians, is in some Copies styled Abraxan, but
the former is the true reading, and why, 293, 294. Zabratus as much as Jah
Berith, the God of the Covenant and why so called, 294. Why said to be a
Babylonian, 294, 295. In what sense Pythagoras may be said to have conversed
with Zabratus, and of the likeness and resemblance betwixt the Doctrine of
Pythagoras, delivered by Zabratus, and the Books of Moses, in three
particulars, 295. Of the dissimilitudes or disagreements betwixt Pythagoras and
Moses, and the causes of it, 295, 296. Sanchuniathon noted, ibid. But it is not
impossible that Zabratus might be the name of an Idol, the same with Bahal
Berith in the Book of Judges, because the name Jah, though it be of right
incommunicable and belonging only to the true God, yet this hinders not but
this might be applied by the Heathens to their Idols, because they took them to
be such, and this, besides what is said afterward concerning Zamolxis, may
serve for a farther indication that the name Jah, which was every whit as
incommunicable as the Tetragrammation it self was no secret to the Heathen
World, 296, 297. Bahal Berith, (...), unskilfully confounded with Abibalus,
which was the name of the true God, being as much as El Abib, Deus Spicarum, so
called from the change of the beginning of the Jewish Year from Tisri to Nisan,
or Abib, the confusedness of Sanchuniathon' s History is again perstringed,
297. Four reasons assigned to strengthen my conjecture concerning Abibalus
being the name of the true God, from 297 to 300. (...), what, 298. (...) for
Neptune, Mos or Moy for Water in the Egyptian Language, ibid. (...) the same
with Isaac, Annobret with Sarah, (...) with Rouach Elohim, or the spirit or
breath of God in Sanchuniathon, for which three discoveries I acknowledge my
self indebted to Bochartus, 299. Notwithstanding the manifest Anachronisms, and
other mistakes or impositions of Sanchuniathon, yet his agreements with Moses
are a testimony to the truth of the Mosaic Writings, ibid. Zamolxis the same
with Jah Moloc, 300. Much ancienter than Pythagoras according to Herodotus,
ibid. Worshipped for Saturn according to Mnaseas in the Etymologist and Suidas,
and this is a farther confirmation that Zamolxis and Moloc were the same, ibid.
Appeased also by humane Sacrifices as Moloc was, 300, 301. Called Gebeleizin
from a Hebrew Word which signifies as much as Terminus, or Jupiter Terminalis,
(...), as Herodotus expressly calls Zamolxis, ibid. Alagabalus, the tutelar of
Emissa, whence he had his name, ibid. Several other considerations to prove
that Jah and Zamolxis are at least so far the same, as that the first is a part
of the composition of the latter. First he was worshipped without an Image, and
supposed to have his peculiar residence in Heaven, from whence God by the
ancient Jews was called Shamajim, several places of Scripture are explained,
and two passages of Herodotus, 301, 302. Secondly, the Scythians believed of
their Zamolxis that he was the true and only God, and that there was none
besides him, which was the reason of their shooting up to Heaven whenever it
thundered and lightened, in defiance of those Meteors, as insensible and
dependent Creatures, though other Nations worshipped them for Gods, 302, 303.
Thirdly, The Scythians believed the transmigration of Souls, or the passing of
the same Soul successively through several humane Bodies, but that this did not
belong to all but only to the good, both of which are asserted concerning them
by Herodotus, and both of these opinions were received by the Jews themselves
in our Savior's time, from 303 to 307. (...). Herodotus and Hellanicus
explained, 304. Porphyry' s opinion concerning the Etymon and signification of
the name Zamolxis considered and refuted, 307, 308, 309. Zaleucus and
Charondas, who they were, a possible Etymology of each of their names showed
with a detection of the vanity of each, and a caution to wariness in
Etymologies, which afford so large a field for Fancy, with a discovery of the
true analogy and signification of each of these names, which concludes this
Discourse, from 309 to 312.
The First EXERCITATION, Attempting to demonstrate that the Jews, till after
the Return from the Captivity of Babylon, were not allowed the public and
promiscuous use of the Canonical Books of the Old Testament.
IT is so far from being true, that every Jew in his private capacity was bound
to transcribe one Copy of the Law, as the Rabbis would persuade us, that I can
make it very probable if not absolutely certain that the Commonalty of the
Jewish Nation neither had nor were permitted usually to have any Copy of the
Law for their own private reading, for all that long interval which happened from
the time of Moses himself till after the return from Captivity of Babylon in
the times of Ezra and Nehemiah, and so much longer as till the version of the
70. was comple^ted, and by degrees was brought into common use. My Reasons
which make me think so are these that follow.

First, When it is said, Deuteronomy. 11. 18, 19, 20. Ye shall lay up these my words
in your heart, and bind them for a sig^ upon your hand, that they may be as
frontlets between your eyes, and ye shall teach them your Children, speaking of
them when thou sittest-in thine house and when thou walk by the way, when
thou lie down and when thou risest up, and thou shall write them upon thy
gates. These words to be explained of the Decalogue or Ten Commandments, not of
the whole Law of Moses, as will appear by comparing this Chapter with the 34th.
of Exodus, which is parallel to it, and therefore when it is said verse. 20.
Thou shall write them upon the door posts of thine house and upon thy gates, in
the first place this literally taken of the whole Law of Moses or of the Five
Books of which the Pentateuch consists is both ridiculous and impossible,
ridiculous to think that Posts and Gates were the only sacred Volumes then in
fashion, and impossible that all the Law of Moses, in a legible character
should be written in so small a compass; wherefore in the second place we are
not to interpret this place of writing, or of Posts or Gates in the literal
sense, but it is in allusion to the sprinkling of Blood upon the Posts and
Lintels of the Israelitish houses the night before their deliverance out of
Egypt, it is a command with a promise of happiness and safety annexed to its
performance, and is as much as to say, "if you observe diligently to obey me
and keep my Commandments, you shall be safe from any Evil or Judgment that may
otherwise befall you, as your Ancestors were exempted from the slaughter of
the Firstborn by the blood of the Paschal Sacrifices sprinkled upon the Posts
and Thresholds of their houses; and such another allusion as this, is that
saying of Moses to his Maker, Exodus 32. 32. Yet now if thou will forgive their
sin: and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou have written.
And then verse. 33. And the Lord God said unto Moses, whosoever has sinned
against me, him will I blot out of my book. Not that we must entertain so gross
and so unworthy conceptions of God Almighty, as if he entered down all humane
or other Occurrences in a certain Journal, without which, if they did not
escape his cognizance he would loose the memory of them, as if he kept an Album
Amicorum,. a Catalogue or List of his Friends and Favorites, without which they
would ship out of his mind; but it is an allusion to the Genealogical Tables of
the Jews, in which such as dyed without Issue, as being of no use in carrying
on the series and account of time, were used by those who transcribed the
public Genealogies for the common use, or the private Pedigrees for the use of
particular Families, to be omitted, and consequently in after Ages forgotten,
of which I have spoken more largely in that Disquisition, which I have
mentioned, concerning the Brother's marrying the Brother's wife in the
Levitical Law; and this is plainly the meaning of that Passage, Psalm. 109. 13.
Let his Posterity be cut off, and in the Generation following let their name be
blotted out; that is, when the Genealogies come to be transcribed for the use
of the next Generation, let their names as barren and supersluous and dying
without Issue be omitted.

Where^ore the Precept of writing of the Law or the Commandments upon the Posts
and Gates of their houses, must be explained by verse. 18. Ye shall lay up these
my words in your heart and in your soul, and this was that which they were to
teach their Children, verse. 19. that is, not the whole Law, which those tender
apprehensions could not receive or attend unto, much less comprehend the entire
Systeme and Model of so intricate a Dispensation, but only the general Rules of
Life and Practice, in which it was but requisite they should be trained up from
their infancy and childhood, that the exercise and love of Virtue and Religion
might be the more habitual to them in their age; and for this reason they were
used to instruct them particularly in the Decalogue, as Children now a days
are used to be taught the Apostles Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten
Commandments, which contain the general Heads of Devotion, Articles of Belief
and Rules of Practice. The very reducing the general Rules of duty both with
respect to God and Man, under ten general Heads, the putting them not less than
twice by themselves into Tables of Stone by the Finger of God himself, that is,
by a supernatural operation of the Divine Will, notwithstanding there is
nothing in the Commandments themselves, which is not more largely insisted upon
in the body of the Law, and branched out into many particular cases, is a
sufficient argument that these ten Words or Precepts, or Commandments, were
intended for the use of the (...), or vulgar sort of men, to give them a
general scheme of their duty; though for their satisfaction in particular
cases, whether of religious scruple or civil right, they were to betake
themselves to the Judges and Officers of their respective Tribes, and from
thence if they were not satis^y'd, they were to appeal to Jerusalem, in that
manner which has been already declared.

Letters were so scarce in those early times among the Jews, as well as among
other Nations, that to be able to write and read, especially to read the Law
after the traditionary way, of which I shall speak more by and by, was that
which qualified men for the highest employments in the Jewish State; and
therefore it is observable that Shoter, and Sopher, and Shophet in Hebrew as
they are names very like in sound, so they are also in signification, and were
all of them frequently expressive of the highest power and authority among
them. Sophrim and Shophtim are joined together as exegetical and declaratory
one of another, 2 Chronicles. 34. 13. and so are Shophtim and Shotrim, Deuteronomy. 16. 18.
In the first of which places the Seventy render it (...), Scribes and Judges;
and in the latter they are termed (...), Judges, and Promulgers of Judicial
Edicts and Letters, as Andreas Masius in his learned and elaborate Notes upon
Joshua would have it, but by his favor, I do not allow that interpretation,
but am rather of opinion that this word is synonymous with the former (...).
For (...) is an Introduction, (...) an Introductour or Instructour in any Skill
or Knowledge, and so Plutarch calls his little Book (...), that is, of the
instruction or information of Youth; and so (...) will be interpres, enarrator,
Doctor Legis, an Expositor or Teacher of the Law, and consequently a Judge of
those Controversies that were to be decided out of it; or it is one that was
used to bring out the Law among the People, who were not allowed the use of it,
or could not make use of it at home, to read and explain it, and address
himself to them in practical and popular exhortations, as the People spoke to
Ezra the Scribe, Neh. 8. v. 1. To bring the book of the Law of Moses; and then
v. 2. And Ezra the Priest brought the Law before the Congregation.

Neither were they only by means of this skill of reading and interpreting the
Law, capacitated to be the prime Judges and Officers among the People, but also
by writing and keeping the Genealogies, which was no question another
Employment of theirs, they had opportunity of knowing all the People and of
being better known to them, of understanding their qualities and conditions and
serving themselves accordingly of them, and by being necessary to all
conveyances and settlements of right between man and man, which will always be
done in writing where such a thing as writing is to be found; they did by this
means aggrandize and enrich themselves, and had a mighty stroke with their
respective Clients, so that it is no wonder the Scribes are mentioned in the
Gospel as men of so great authority and sway amongst the Jews, this being a
name, for the reasons above given, of the greatest dignity and power among
them, and so in the first of Macchabees the fi^th Chapter and forty second
verse, the (...), the Scribes of the people, are manifestly the Leaders and the
Chiefs among them, and Acts 19. 35. he who in our Translation is called the
Town clerk, a man of principal credit and authority among the People of that
place, is in the original called (...), the Scribe; and though I am ready to
grant that this word does not always denote so much, but that sometimes the
more inferior Officers, such as the Latins call Lictores, apparitores,
viatores, accenso, are understood by it, which is I think Masius his notion of
(...), yet that it sometimes and that very frequently in the Old, and always in
the New Testament denoted men of the greatest credit and power among the Jews,
cannot without great unskilfulness be denied.

A second reason from whence it may appear probable, that the ancient Jews were
not permitted the use and reading of the sacred Volumes in their private
persons or Families, is that a great part of it did not concern them, but was
perfectly the business of the Priests, and of none but them; so that to
instruct them in the knowledge of those things, with that accuracy and niceness
with which it was requisite the Priests and Levites themselves should
understand them, was but to fill their heads with a superfluous lumber, which
was of no use to them, and was rather an hindrance than otherwise to their
improvement in, and to their due attention to those practical Precepts in which
they were chiefly concerned.

Thirdly, There were some things in the Law, the knowledge of which could serve
to no other purpose but only to be a perpetual temptation to transgress it, as
men have usually an hankering after those things, which are with the greatest
rigor and severity forbidden them; such was the confection or composition of
the holy Ointment, with which the Tabernacle and all its Vessels and Furniture
and the Priests themselves were to be anointed, Exodus 30. where after the
enumeration of its ingredients from v. 22. to 32. it is added v. 32. 33. Upon
man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it,
after the composition of it: it is holy and it shall be holy unto you,
whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever puts any of it upon a
stranger, shall even be cut off from his people. And the same is true likewise
of the holy Perfume, whose ingredients are specified v. 34. of which it is said
v. 37, 38. And as for the perfume which thou shall make, ye shall not make to
your selves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy
for the Lord, whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even
be cut off from his people. Wherefore the knowledge of these two things in the
Levitical Law, being, if not put in practice, useless, and being practiced, not
only dangerous, but fatal and destructive, it is most likely that as well the
ingredients of these two holy Compositions, as also the proportions of each,
and the manner of tempering and mingling them one with another, was kept as a
secret among the Priests, or known only to him or them whoever they were to
whom the composition of them belonged.

What has been said of these two Instances, the same would be likewise true of
what the Greeks call the Tetragrammaton, and the Jews, Hashem, or Shem
Hameporash, the name, or the nomen explicatum, the explained name, as it should
seem by an Antiphrasis, because, if we will believe the generality of the
Jewish Masters, it cannot be explained, which being only to be pronounced with
its true Vowels by the High Priest once a year, when he entered into the Holy of
Holies, was therefore probably, if this be true, (to hinder it from being
profaned) kept from the knowledge of all but him, or his immediate Successor
in that high Employment; it is certain that at this day its true pronunciation
is not known, and the Masorethical Jews either out of ignorance or superstition
or both, are always used to point it either with the Vowels of Adonai or
Elohim, but mostly of the former; nay so foolishly superstitious are they, that
in the numbering of the Verses in the present Hebrew Bibles, when they come to
the 15th verse of any Chapter, whose proper marks are a Jod and an He, they
always change them into a Teth and a Vau, counting it by nine and six, instead
of ten and five, because the Letters by which the former two numbers are
denoted, are two of those Letters of which the Shem Hameporash is composed.

He that would see more of the modern Superstition, may consult Buxtorf in his
Learned Synagoga; and he that desires to be informed what admirable work the
Cabalistical Triflers have made of this mysterious name may repair for
satisfaction to Rabbi Paulus Fagius, who is to be spoke with at all hours of
the day in the 28th of Exodus at the 30th verse.

A fourth reason then, which may be assigned, to make it appear that private
persons among the Jews were not permitted the reading of the Law, may be taken
from their so frequent relapsing to Idolatry; notwithstanding the Law was so
passionately severe in its denunciations against that dreadful sin, so
frequent, so unwearied in its exhortations against it, and that the seven
Nations, whose Land they came to possess, were rooted out from off the face of
the earth for no other reason but this, or at least for none so much at this,
for their Idolatry and spiritual fornication; it being impossible and absurd to
conceive, if all the people had been sufficiently instructed in the Law (which
Law at the same time they must be supposed to acknowledge to have been of
divine inspiration, and that all the curses and blessings therein mentioned did
and would certainly belong to the performance or violation of what that Law
commanded); I say, it would be impossible and absurd in this case to think,
that Idolatry should creep in so often as it did, without any noise or
disturbance; for in all those revolutions in the Jewish Church, from the
Established Religion to the worship of Idols, and to the abominations of the
Heathens round about them, though there might be and were actually some few who
did not bow the knee to Baal, or submit to those pollutions which were so
inconsistent with the worship and honor due to the true and only God; yet it
is manifest the Crowd and generality of the People were generally swept away
with it, as by an Epidemical Distemper, a certain Plague and Murrain of the
mind.

And this fourth reason will borrow yet farther strength from these three
considerations, each of which are alone sufficient, and much more all of them
together to put the matter beyond all possibility of doubt or question.

First, If we enquire into the true reason from whence it came to pass, that
the Romish Church in the Adoration of Images and Relics, in the worship of
Saints, and the sacrifice of the Mass has been guilty of so vile and execrable
Idolatry, besides an infinite number of the most foolish and ridiculous
superstitions, that either the wit or the folly of man could invent; it is very
plain, that the true and only cause why the deluded World has submitted it
self so tamely to be trampled upon and trodden under foot, in spite of common
reason and common sense, and has believed the gr^ssest contradictions, as
Articles of Faith; condescended to the most Contemptible and Apish Follies as
parts of a Serious and Devout Worship, is ultimately resolved into their
unacquaintance with the Scriptures, which as long as they were in common use
among the people, so long the Christian Faith continued, as to the main, free
from that foul degeneracy and corruption, to which it was afterward for so
many ages condemned, and under which so great a part of the Christian World is
to this day so fatally oppressed; but when once the Greek and Roman Tongues
became from vernacular to be learned languages, when neither the Fountains
themselves, nor their purest streams could be repaired to by the ordinary
people, and in too many instances not by the Priests themselves, while
Translations were either not thought of or not permitted; this gave occasion
for ignorance and superstition, by insensible degrees to corrupt and adulterate
Religion; and for the craft and wickedness of designing Priests, who gain by
nothing more than by the credulity and superstition of ignorant and foolish
men, to introduce those opinions and practices into the world, which it is hard
to say, whether they were better fitted to promote the outward pomp and
splendor, the secular interest and advantage of the Romish Church and Clergy,
or more expressy contrary to the positive and declared Revelations of Christ
and his Apostles; such as are the sacrifice of the Mass, Prayers and Masses for
the dead, denying the Cup to the Laiety in the Holy Eucharist, and the Celibate
of the Clergy, or forbidding Clergymen to Marry: of which the first and third
were intended to create a respect and reverence for the person of the Priest;
the second to be a perpetual Tax and Subsidy upon the Laiety; the last to
secure the grandeur and external pomp of the Church, and all of them to fill
the peoples heads with such absurd and grossly superstitious opinions, as are
the most effectual means for the promoting and perpetuating to ^uture
generations all these unwarrantable interests and designs.

Secondly, As unacquaintance with the Scriptures, which to the Romish Church
are as a talent hid in a Napkin, or a Candlestick put under a bushel, was the
true cause of that Universal Idolatry and Corruption which prevails among the
deluded Votaries of that Communion; so on the other side the true reason why
the Reformed Churches have shaken off that yoke of absurdities and
abominations, why they have embraced a Religion more agreeable to nature, and
more suitable to revelation, is to be referred to the Holy Evangelists and
Apostles, speaking to every one of us, as they did to the multitude on the day
of Pentecost, in his own proper Idiom and Language; which it is utterly
impossible they should do, but they must at the same time discover plainly to
the world, God's utter detestation of all such Idolatrous practices, and of all
those absurd and unwarrantable opinions upon which those forbidden practices
are founded.

But, thirdly, to bring the matter a little more home to the Jews themselves,
if it be demanded why before the Captivity of Babylon, they were so often
guilty of Idolatry, but never after it, as it is plain they were not; the true
reason of this is, that soon after the established worship was again settled
upon its old foundations by Esdras and Nehemias; the Translation of the seventy
was made out of the Original Hebrew, and from that time forward the Law was
laid open both to the Jewish and the Gentile World.

And these three things, as I have said, which are matters of fact, and
arguments drawn from experience, I take to be a plain and undeniable
demonstration of the matter in question, that the ancient Jews were not
permitted the reading of the Law for themselves, or in their respective
families or persons.

This is the fourth reason, a fifth no less demonstrative than that is, shall
be taken from the peoples calling to Esdras, to bring out the Book of the Law,
and of their having lost not only the memory of those rites and usages with
which their solemn Feasts were to be observed, but of the very Feasts
themselves; of their having lost their language in so great a measure, that
Esdras was forced not only to produce the Law, but to explain it to them, as I
conceive, in the Chaldean or Assyrian tongue, which was then more familiar to
them than their native Hebrew: All which it is utterly unconceivable how it
should ever have come to pass, had it been the custom of every private person
to transcribe the Law for himself, as the Rabbis and their adherents would
make us believe, and to read it to his Children and Domestiques in his family;
I say, it would have been impossible at this rate, that in so small a period of
time (there being several who had seen the first Temple, who likewise returned
again from the Captivity and saw the foundations of the second laid) so
strange an ignorance, and so utter a forgetfulness of the whole Law should
overspread the whole Nation of the Jews. Insomuch that it was the opinion of
Ireneus, Eusebius and several other of the ancient Fathers, that the Law of
Moses in this Interval was utterly lost, and that by a supernatural revelation
it was renewed by Edras; nay, Tertullian in his book de habitu Muliebri, is so
positive as to affirm it for a certain and undoubted truth, Hierosolymis
Babilonia expugnatione deletis, omne instrumentum Judaicae literaturae constat
per Esdram esse restauratum; "It is certain that after Jerusalem was demolished
by the King of Babylon, all the Monuments of the Jewish Learning or Law (which
were now perfectly lost) were restored by Edras. Which opinion, as being
grounded upon no other foundation, than that extreme ignorance of the people in
the Law after the return from the captivity, and their importuning Esdras to
bring out the Book of the Law, may without any unwarrantable disrespect to
antiquity be rejected, especially since I hope I may pretend to have given a
better account of those matters, because it has nothing precarious in it,
which is the fault of this; for it does not follow, because Esdras was desired
to bring out the book of the Law, that therefore it was revealed to him by
inspiration, but he could not bring it out, unless he had it in possession is
certain, which is all that I contend for.

Neither need we be so scrupulous of rejecting the testimony of the Fathers in
this case, if we consider that the divine inspiration of the seventy
Interpreters, and their exact jumping together, notwithstanding every man made
his Translation apart, is asserted by every whit as strong, nay, a much
stronger suffrage of antiquity than this of the (...), or supernatural
illumination of Esdras; nay, Justin Martyr tells us, that he himself saw those
very Cells, in which this miracle of a Translation was wrought; and yet nothing
in common sense is more plain, nothing that happened either yesterday or to day
more known, than that Justin Martyr was imposed upon, and that all his fellow
suffragans were mistaken; unless we will affirm that the Spirit of God was so,
and put all the mistakes and over-sights of the 70 Interpreters, which after
all that Isaac Vossius has said in their defense, were very many, to the
divine Spirit, either imposing upon all mankind, or being mistaken and deceived
it self; either of which is almost equally absurd and blasphemous to suppose,
because the first argues a pravity in his Will, the second an imperfection in
his Nature, and by both the foundation of all certainty is destroyed, it being
the same thing with respect to our faculties, which depend upon his skill and
veracity for their truth, whether he be capable of being deceived himself, or
be of such a fallacious and deceitful nature, that he will make no scruple of
imposing upon us.

Sixthly, It is to be considered, that this was the constant practice of the
most remote antiquity among all nations, that the Mysteries of their Religion
were usually locked up among the Priests, and kept from the knowledge of the
common people, and they had either generally no writing at all but among the
Priests, and such as was to be found in the public Records or in the sacred
Volumes, both of which were used to be kept in their Temples; or if they had
any, yet it was a distinct character from that which the Priests and
Hierophantoe used, which was unknown to the ordinary sort of men: so Porphyrie
says of Sanchuniathon, that he took his History, (...), Out of the public
Records, and sacred Volumes laid up in the Temples: And Philo says, that he
compared his History, (...). With the hidden or concealed Monuments of the
Ammonites which were laid up in their Temples; for so I rather choose to
translate' (...), than as Bochartus does of the Idols of the Sun, which are
called in Hebrew Chamanim; for all men that understand any thing in these
Grammatical affairs, do know very well that' (...) is a very Analagous word
from' (...) or '(...) to signify one of that people or nation; and I conceive
that in this place it can, in strict Analogy, signify nothing else: So also
Diodorus Siculus, speaking of the letters of the Egyptians, says, they had
two sorts in use among them, one which was the public letter of the whole
Nation, the other peculiar to the Priests, derived down to them successively
from Father to Son, and kept secret among themselves.

Laertius, in the life of Democritus, giving a Catalogue of the Books which he
wrote, among others mentions these two, (...), and (...) of the sacred
Characters in Meroe and Babylon.

And lastly, Theodoret in his Questions upon Genesis, (...) In the Groecian
Temples there were certain peculiar characters, which were called (...), that
is to say, the letters or characters of the Priests, where when Bochartus, from
whom I have borrowed these Citations, would interpret (...) in a larger sense,
for any Barbarous or Heathen Temples; it is certain that this is precarious, if
it be not false, and that the more strict interpretation, by which (...) in
Greek is usually opposed to (...), is the more likely to be true.

From hence it is that the Greeks are used to call that secret learning which
is kept among the Priests by the name of (...), the Mysteries; from the Hebrew
Sathar, latuit, the Participle of which in Hophal is Mustar, and from thence is
the Greek (...), applied afterward peculiarly by the Greek Fathers to the
consecrated Elements of the Holy Eucharist; for this reason, because the
Catechumens themselves, and much more the (...), those that were perfectly
without the pale of the Church, were not admitted to see or know any thing of
the solemn administration of that holy Supper; insomuch that in their Homilies
or Sermons, or other Discourses, they never allowed themselves to talk plainly
concerning it, that the knowledge of those secrets might not by any means be
imparted to any, but such as were admitted into the most perfect order of
Christians, and were in the strictest degree of fellowship and communion with
the Church.

Wherefore when ever they had occasion to touch upon any thing of those holy
rites, the knowledge of which was not permitted to any but the perfect
Christian, they were used to speak of it only in very general terms, closing up
their dark and general expressions with an (...), that is, the initiated or the
perfect Christians understand what I mean; and by the same Analogy with this,
to observe that also, now it lies so fairly in my way, the Turks at this day
are used to call those who are Atheistically given, or rather they are used to
call themselves, (as arrogating a more extraordinary knowledge to themselves
above their neighbors, only for being more ignorant and stupid than they are)
the Musarim, that is, (...), the profound or deep searchers into the nature of
things, for Sour in Hebrew is recessit, and Mousar the Participle in Hophal is
qui in recessu latet; and Mousarin, as I have said, are the profound and deep
Philosophers of the times, as this sort of people usually account themselves,
and laugh at all that are piously or seriously disposed, as a pack of silly,
superstitious mortals frighted by public tales, by clouts and scare-crows, the
crafty inventions of Priests and Politicians to keep the world in awe.

Lastly, By the same Analogy it is that the Turks call themselves Mushlemen,
that is to say, the faithful, the perfect or the elect, for Shallem is
perfectum, beatum esse, and from thence in Hophal Mushlam, and by the addition
of a Turkish termination Mushleman (as from the Chalday Tirgem is the Turkish,
Drogerman for an Interpreter) is a perfect or blessed man, or a professor of
the true Religion, in which appellation the Mahometaus hug themselves, as their
fellow Predestinarians among us are used to do, and learn to despise and hate
the rest of Mankind.

Now if it be true, as I have made it appear, that this was the custom of all
the ancient World, to keep their sacred Volumes locked up in the Temples, and
concealed from the knowledge of the common people; if this were the custom of
the Ammonites and the Egyptians, both of them so near neighbors to the
Israelites, then these two things seem pretty plain.

First, If you add this general custom to what has been said before to prove
that the common Jews had little or no acquaintance with their law, I hope all
this, taken together, will at least strengthen what former proof has been
given, if it may not pretend to be a new proof by it self.

Secondly, If we should suppose that the Jews had generally that familiar
knowledge of, and acquaintance with the law which is denied, what extreme
madness and folly would it have been in this case for them to relapse to the
Idolatries and Superstitions of the Heathen World, that is, to run out of the
light of noon, into the darkness of midnight, to leave a Religion which they
perfectly understood, and were not capable to be abused by the craft and
subtilty of designing Priests, to embrace that, where all was kept secret, and
where they were in perpetual danger of being imposed upon by the designs and
artifices of those whose trade and livelihood depended wholly upon the
credulity and ignorance of the people? or would they not rather have said to
any that should have endeavored to persuade them to make so foolish and so
unaccountable an exchange of their Religion, as our Savior said to the
Samaritane Woman, Tou know not what you worship, we know what we worship, for
salvation is of the Jews? So that besides the direct proof of this assertion,
which this consideration will afford, here is also a Demonstratio per absurdum,
and the manifest inconvenience of the contrary opinion is enough to overthrow
it.

Seventhly, For this reason the law is called the Covenant of Levi, Malach. 2.
4. And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my
covenant might be with Levi, says the Lord of Hosts. Not but that the Covenant
was made in common with the whole people of Israel, but it is called the
Covenant with Levi, because as it follows v. 7. The Priest's lips should keep
knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth, for he is the messenger
of the Lord of Hosts. And then v. 8. to show how easy it was for them, who had
the entire possession of the law to themselves, and who were the Oracles upon
whom the people depended to impose upon them, and abuse them at their pleasure;
it is added, But ye are departed out of the way, ye have caused many to stumble
at the law, ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi.

Eighthly and lastly, It is to be considered that in all the most ancient times
of the Jewish Church, the sacred Volume consisted wholly of Consonants, and
that the Vowels were supplied, without the help of any visible Characters, by
the skill or traditionary usage of the Priests, among whom it was preserved;
that it had no Vowels visibly and determinately set down, is evident from the
Genius of all the Eastern languages, to all of which this defect did anciently
belong, and from the Writings of all the Rabbinical Doctors, whether Ancient or
Modern, who always have, and still do continue to this day, to write down only
the Consonants, or unsounding Letters, leaving the Vowels to be supplied by the
skill or conjecture of their ^^ders; and, lastly, from all the ancient MSS. of
the Hebrew Bible it self; of which Isaac Vossius, who had seen Two thousand, an
incredible number, affirms, that he never saw any ancienter than Six hundred
years, which had the Masorethical Vowels and Accents annexed to it.

Now it being clear and evident, to those who understand any thing of these
matters, from the nature of the thing it self, and from the experience of those
differences which are to be found, by comparing the several Translations, which
have been made out of the Original Hebrew with one another, by collating the
seventy, and the Chalday Paraphrasts, and the fragments of Symmachus, Aquila
and Theodotion, the Vulgar Latin, and the ancient Medrashes or Jewish
Expositions and Paraphrases together, (somewhat of which has been already
attempted by Capellus, but yet so as that, without any detraction from that
incomparable work, there is still an infinite field remaining for the industry
of others to exercise it self) I say, it being evident from all this, that the
same Consonants are capable of, and have been actually pointed with different
Vowels, which different Vowels shall constitute different words by themselves,
and shall by the change of one or more such words make a different sense to
arise in a sentence taken together according to the several possibilities of
variation in the same clause or sentence; it is manifest that every new way of
pointing, is in effect a new Comment or Paraphrase upon the Text, in which this
variation is made.

But besides this there is also another sort of variation to be considered, to
which the Scriptures of the Old Testament are easily, and have been actually
exposed either by the mistakes, or by the wilful and industrious fault of the
Transcribers, and that is by the likeness of Consonants either as to the sound
or figure either in the Old Samaritane, or in the ^esent Assyrian Character;
such as are the changes of ^ ^aleth, a Resh and a Lamed, by reason of likeness
in figure, or of an Hajin and an Aleph, being both gutturals, for the
similitude of sound, into one another; of which sort of a^terations there are
an incredible number of instances to be found, by comparing the several
Translations with one another, to say nothing of that addition which might be
made to these by a comparison of all those M SS. which are extant at this day,
nor to take notice of the Keri and the Ketib of the Masoreth it self, or of the
various readings of Ben Asher and Ben Nephthali, that is, to say of the Eastern
and Western Jews.

Now whoever shall consider these two causes of different reading or different
interpretation, and shall withal suppose the ancient Jews to have been every
one of them obliged to transcribe an entire Copy of the Law for himself, and to
have read it without any Points and Vowels; and, lastly, shall compare this
with the mistakes to which men are subject, the woeful ignorance and want of
sense, to which the common crowd of all Nations is usually exposed, and much
more the Jews, who are by nature a stupid, melancholy and superstitious sort
of men; and with the conceits and prejudices, the love of novelty, the natural
itch of being thought wiser than their teachers, and the wicked ambition which
in all ages and nations possesses many men's breasts, of overthrowing and
unsetling the present establishment of things, of disobeying their superiors,
of gathering Churches or Congregations, as the Modern phrase is, that is, of
siding into Factions and Parties, and of disturbing the public peace and
quiet upon religious pretenses; and then let him tell me whether it were safe
after all this to entrust every private person to transcribe the Law or
Prophets, or to point it for himself, that is, in effect to make all the
alterations in Religion, which either ignorance, carelessness or design can
introduce; nay, whether it would not have been impossible, in so great variety
of reading and interpretation as this would have unavoidably occasioned, but
that the Jewish Nation must have been cantoned and divided into as many Sects,
as there were different possibilities of interpretation, arising from either of
the two causes, which have been above specified and assigned.

What confusion would this have introduced into the Ceremonial part of the
Mosaique Law, while every alteration of a letter or vowel would have made a new
Ceremony, and there would have been as great diversity of rites as there was
possibility of variation, and all pretending to the same divine authority to
justify and vouch themselves? how would the people, out of that innovating
humor which is natural to the populace of all the world, have divided and
subdivided themselves into several Parties, Conventicles and Factions? and how
would the Priests, as fast as revenge, or ambition, or opiniatrity and
affectation should prompt them, have put themselves in the head of disagreeing
Sects, and would have fomented those differences among the Jews with the same
real or pretended zeal and earnestness that the Non-conformists do now among
us, only with this advantage, that the Jews might have done it, when the
interpretation of places, for want of a standing punctation, was left so much
to every man's honesty and judgment, with infinitely greater plausibility and
pretense of warrant from above, than our dissenting Incendiaries can do, who
are so shamef^lly driven out of all their posts, unless it be their ignorance,
knavery and impudence, which are citadels impregnable against all the power of
argument in the world, and can only be taken in by the faithful and vigorous
execution of severe and wholesome Laws? how would they have lampoon'd and
ridiculed the Prophets? and how would the several Parties, by a several way of
reading, pointing or accentuation have discharged the several Prophecies at one
another? Lastly, what strange uncertainty would this have brought upon the Law
and Prophets? how would it have confounded all those Prophecies that foretold,
and all those Rites and Sacrifices that typified and shadowed out the coming of
the Messiah? And by consequence how would it have perplexed and entangled, nay,
plainly evacuated and disanulled all the evidence which we have, besides the
unquestionable miracles of our Savior and his Apostles, for the Christian
Religion? how would it have baffled and defeated that argument for our
Savior's Person and Doctrine, upon which he himself laid so mighty stress,
that he despaired any miracle, how great soever, should persuade them, with
whom the testimonies of Moses and the Prophets were of no force and
signification? For upon supposition of such infinite variation, as the
Promiscuous use of the Original Hebrew, before the use of points, would have
introduced, these testimonies could not possibly have been of any weight or
value with any considerative or thinking man, because the several readings by
their mutual opposition would have destroyed and supplanted one another.

It is so far from being true, that the ancient Jews were permitted the
promiscuous use and reading of the Law, that it seems rather to have been
denied to most of the Priests and Levites themselves; for we are to consider
that in the distribution of the Levites to their several employments, there
were none admitted to the actual exercise of any sacred office whatsoever, till
they were arrived to the age of twenty years, and that at that age they were
only capable of the more servile or handywork employments; and as they arrived
to greater maturity of years, so they were admitted to offices and employments
of a more honorable nature; that there were some appointed for Porters, others
for Singers, whose business was only to be instructed in the Songs of the Lord,
without any obligation that appears to any particular study of the whole Law:
And so for those that were employed, in dressing or preparing the sacrifices,
or in sprinkling the blood, it was not requisite they should learn this skill
by a personal converse and acquaintance with the Law; as well because all the
Ceremonies belonging to the performance of such Ministeries as these, neither
were nor could be prescribed in the Law it self, without swelling it into a
much larger Volume, than that in which it is now contained, as has been
already observed, to the shame of all Nonconforming scruples, and to the
undeniable justification of humane institutions in religious worship; as
because it is seen that things of this nature, that is, the ceremony and
formality of Offices, whether Civil or Divine, may be and are actually handed
down to men in a traditionary way; as it is possible for a man, and many a man
actually does understand the Laws of England sufficiently well, and yet in the
practice of a particular Law-Court, is not half so well skilled as an ordinary
Attorney.

Besides all which, it is still further to be considered, that at the return
from the Captivity of Babylon, as has been already observed, Esdras did not
only instruct the people in the knowledge of the Law, but also the Priests and
the Levites themselves, Nehem. 8. 13. which would have been needless, if all
the Priests had been equally instructed in the knowledge of it; or if some of
them, unless in those matters which belonged to their particular charges, which
as well as the Law it self, were now by seventy years disuse forgotten, had not
been either altogether or very nigh as ignorant as the common people.

Wherefore it is most reasonable to conceive, that as the line and family of
Aaron, were of all the Levitical race, the highest in the Priestly dignity
among the Jews, insomuch that the Priests and the Levites are frequently
distinguished from one another in Scripture (though it is true that the Levites
were Priests too, though in a greater latitude, as well as Aaron and his sons,
being all of them equally substituted instead of the first born, and all of
them dedicated, though in a less degree, to the service and ministry of the
holy things,) I say, it is highly reasonable from hence to conclude, that the
more particular knowledge and study of the Law was confined to the family of
Aaron, who were those Priests, most properly and strictly so called, whose lips
in the language of Malachi were to preserve knowledge; and to whose custody
alone, as being the most sacred depositum in the world, the Original M S. of
the Law it self, or the most Authentic and unquestionable Copy of it, was
committed, Deuteronomy. 17. 18.

It is not certainly for nothing that the Letter or Commission of Xerxes to
Esdras in Josephus is thus superscribed, (...), to Esdras the Priest, and
Reader or Interpreter of the Law of God; and so he is called again afterward
in the body of the Epistle it self, which is to me a plain intimation, that the
skill of reading, and much more of interpreting the Law, was in the time of
Esdras, a great rarity among the Priests themselves; for that by (...) or
Reader, somewhat more is implied, than what the Jews afterward in their
Synagogue worship called Chazan, and the Greeks sometimes (...), is evident
from the words of Epiphanius in the Heresy of the Aebionites, who calls the
Hebrew Chazanim, by an Hellenistical word (...), and interprets it in Greek by
(...) or (...), which is the very word used in St. Luke's Gospel; and it is
plain from that place of St. Luke, and from the interpretation of Epiphanius,
and the place above cited out of the Tractate Succa, that no more was meant by
it than an ordinary Reader in one of our Parish-Churches; whereas Esdras was
not only a Priest, but a Priest of greatest note and dignity among the Jews at
that time, as appears sufficiently, as well by the sacred Story, as by the
testimony of Josephus, who calls him, Antiq. L. XI. c. 5. (...), the chief
Priest of the people, that is, of that part of them, who returned out of
Babylon into Judea, which all the Jews did not, the High Priest of the whole
nation, properly so called, remaining still behind, whose name in the time of
Esdras was Joakim, and was succeeded, after his death, by his son Eliasim,
remaining still in Babylon, as Josephus reports; which is still a new argument
to invalidate those testimonies of the ancient Fathers, whereby they would make
Esdras, to have recovered the law after it was perfectly lost, by a divine
inspiration; for certainly it is not very likely that the High Priest himself,
who was chiefly concerned to understand the law, was any whit less knowing in
it than Esdras, much less that all the succession, during that Interval, which
consisted of three several persons according to Josephus, that is, Jesus, and
Joakim, and Eliasim, were all of them so utterly unacquainted with the law, and
with their office, as they must be, if this opinion of the Fathers be admitted
for truth; besides that what Josephus says of Esdras, that he was (...),
sufficiently or competently skilled in the law of Moses, is very short of a
divine inspiration.

It being therefore thus clear from so many irrefragable arguments, that the
reading of the law till after the translation of the seventy was not permitted
the commonalty of the Jews, (which if it had, it would have been impossible,
that both the law and language during this interval, should have been so
utterly lost.)

It being certain that they were kept in this ignorance and darkness, even in
the time of their best Kings, of David, and Solomon, and Josiah; and that it
was so far from being disallowed by God himself, that it seems expressly
approved by him, in those words of the Prophet Malachi, which I have produced.

Lastly, It being no less evident, that such a concealment of the Law, from the
knowledge of the common people, could not be without great inconveniences
attending it, by exposing them to the cheats and impostures of the Priests, as
it is at this day in the Church of Rome in a great measure, and by being in all
probability the occasion of their so frequently relapsing into the Idolatrous
worship of the Nations round about them.

From hence we have another pregnant instance how strict and religious care was
had to the preservation of peace and unity in the Jewish Church; and this
example pursued into its consequences, is still a stronger argument for all
those humane means of unity and public peace, which if quietly submitted to
and obeyed, will bring to pass that blessed end they aim at, without exposing
us to any of those dangers and inconveniences with which this Jewish
prohibition was attended.

If it were lawful or warrantable, among the ancient Jews, to prohibit the
reading of the Scriptures, or so much as to permit them not to be read, because
the reading of them would be attended with this fatal consequence, that it
would infallibly through the perverseness of bad, or the unskilfulness of
ignorant men, have been the occasion of great schisms and disorders in the
Jewish Church and State, (as I have demonstrated, it must needs have proved,)
notwithstanding the great danger and inconvenience to which the prohibition it
self was exposed; then certainly all those humane institutions which tend to
the same end, without the same or any like inconvenience are undoubtedly
lawful and fit to be commanded, and consequently both fit and necessary to be
obeyed.

The great design of Religion is the peace and happiness of Mankind, and
therefore whatever does in its own nature, or in its direct and necessary
consequence, tend to the disquiet and disturbance of the world, is naturally
forbidden to men considered as members of a civil society; such was the
promiscuous use of the Law and Prophets among the ancient Jews, and for that
reason it was with equal justice and necessity forbidden; and if it be the same
case in the permission of things indifferent, or in the public allowance of
every man's private fancy and humor, as to the circumstances and external
Modifications of Divine worship; if this be always found by experience to be a
means of crumbling men into Factions and Parties, of alienating men's
affections, and disuniting their interests, and setting the several Parties at
a perpetual strife and variance with one another; then it follows plainly, that
a prohibition of such liberty under legal penalties, which is the only remedy
against such disorders, is, because necessary to a necessary end, the peace and
welfare of Mankind, lawful, and a duty incumbent on the Civil Magistrate, to
whom the care of the public peace and safety is committed; which if he shall
neglect, he is answerable to God for the greatest breach of trust of which any
public administration is capable; and it being confessedly at every man's own
choice, not considering him as a Member of a Society, what indifferent posture
or circumstance he will make use of in divine worship, otherwise there could be
no indifferent things in nature; it is as necessary when he enters into, or
engages himself in a society, that he resign up this liberty to the public
Will of the Supreme Civil Power, as any other privilege or power of acting,
with which antecedently to all bargain or compact, he is by nature invested;
For this plain reason, because otherwise the society can either not subsist at
all, or not without perpetual trouble and disorder; which because it is in all
its degrees, a proportionable tendency to an actual dissolution, it may and
must be restrained with the same care, with which Rebellion or Anarchy should
be avoided; which being the direct contrariety to Government, or the return of
Society into a state of nature, is that in whose prevention by all necessary
means the Magistrate is chiefly concerned.

We find in Scripture that even divine Laws themselves are sometimes of no
force or obligation, when a particular act of Charity or Mercy either to man or
beast is concerned; as when David and his followers ate the shewbread, which
could not legally be eaten by any but the Priests; and for the same reason the
plucking a Sheep out of a pit, the pulling of ears of Corn, and healing of the
blind on the Sabbath Day, are allowed not to be a violation of the Sabbath,
though expressly contrary to the words of that Commandment, wherein the
observation of the Sabbath, or a feriation from all manner of work or labor is
enjoined; which how strictly it was observed, not only by the superstition of
the Jews, but by the appointment of God himself, in cases where there was no
such absolute necessity, we know by the punishment of him, who was stoned by
the whole congregation for gathering of sticks on the Sabbath day.

If therefore a divine Law may be dispensed with in cases of necessity, at the
prudence and discretion of men, what can be more plain than that upon the same
account a humane law may justly be enacted? For this reason, because a
dispensation of any divine Law, in cases not particularly excepted in the Law
it self, is every whit as much an humane institution, as any positive humane
Law; and if there be the same reason of necessity in both cases, that is, for
the welfare of a particular person, and much more of a whole society, they are
both of them of equal obligation; neither will it avail any thing in this case
to distinguish betwixt humane institutions in sacred and in civil Matters, for
certainly the observation of the Sabbath belongs to the former of these; and if
humane laws may determine in what particular instances the Sabbath is violated,
and in what it is not, that is, in what manner the Sabbath shall be observed;
then it may as well determine, nay, and much more, any other bare external
circumstance of Worship whatsoever.

But above all things, we can never too frequently reflect upon what has been
said as to the prohibition of reading the Law and Prophets to the Jews of old,
which being a thing drawing so great inconvenience after it, and which could
have no other good meaning than to preserve the peace and unity of the Jewish
Church, which I have shown plainly, without this prohibition could never have
been preserved; this certainly extends in its consequence with much more
conclusiveness to all those expedients of public peace and safety, whatever
they be, which have no such inconvenience attending; which to be sure must be
the case of all indifferent matters, which would otherwise cease to be
indifferent, and by being manifestly hurtful would lose their name.

But let not any man for all this think or suggest, that in this I favor the
cause of the Papists, who deny the Populace the use of Bibles in the vulgar
tongue; for in the first place I only represent matter of fact, without making
any application; in the second I say there is great disparity of reason betwixt
the Papists and the Jews; for had the Vowels been added to the Consonants in
the Hebrew Bibles, so as the sense might have been more plain and less subject
either to error or design, which is the case of all our Bibles in the Modern
Tongues, there had not then been the same reason to keep them locked up among
the Priests that there was; and it would have been as safe to permit every man
the use of the Law and Prophets for his own private reading, as it was after
the seventy had completed their Translation, after which the knowledge of the
Law was diffused in common among all the Jews.

Again, If the Law had contained only matters of Morality and rules of Life,
which is the main business of the Gospel, it could not have been so liable to
any dangerous corruption, because it would be more difficult for any Doctrine
to gain credit among men, which contradicted the common sense and the common
interest of Mankind; but in a book of Rituals and Formalities of external
worship, as different readings must have produced different rites, so those
different rites would have produced so many different Parties and Factions
among the Jews.

Fourthly, It was absolutely necessary before the appearance of our Savior in
the world, that the Scriptures of the Old Testament should be laid open to the
knowledge both of Jew and Gentile, to prepare them for the reception of the
Messiah that was to come, and to render them the more inexcusable, especially
the former, if at his appearance they did not give him that welcome and
respectfull entertainment, which was due to the greatness of his character and
person.

Fifthly, We are expressly commanded in several places of the N. T. to search
the Scriptures, we are told that all Scripture is written for our instruction,
and Timothy is commended by St. Paul for his knowledge of the Scripture from
his youth upwards; and since all these places in the New Testament, where the
Scripture or Scriptures are mentioned are to be understood of the Old, this is
sufficient to show how necessary it was sometime before our Savior's
appearance, and at that time it self, and ever since, that the Scriptures of
the Old Testament should be laid open and exposed to the view of Jew and
Gentile, because Moses and the Prophets did testify of the Messiah; and it
would have been impossible to understand how all the Prophecies and Types of
the Old Testament were fulfilled in the person, and by the sacrifice of the
Messiah, without comparing the Life and History of that person, and those types
and prophecies together.

Sixthly, Since we are commanded in the Scriptures of the New Testament to
study and search into the Scriptures of the Old; and that only for this reason,
because they bear their testimony to the Messiah, whose types and shadows are
explained and unfolded in the Gospel: this is sufficient to show the obligation
we are under, to search the Scriptures of the New Testament also, because they
can neither be sufficiently understood without one another; and the reading of
the Old is enjoined us only for that reason, that we may compare it with the
New for our better understanding of both, and especially the latter.

Seventhly, Since the History of our Savior's Birth and Life, and Miracles and
Sufferings are so faithfully and particularly set down in the Gospels, as this
was unquestionably intended for the benefit of all succeeding generations, who
would otherwise have lost that History, or have received it, corrupted and
imbezled by foolish and ridiculous Fables; so the greatest benefit which any
man can receive from a Narrative of this nature, is to be expected from the
Original Narrative it self, or from such a faithful translation, as keeps the
closest to the literal and Grammatical sense of the Original; besides, that
such Translations, made by men of learning and integrity in all ages, into the
vulgar tongue, for the use of the common people, are a perpetual security
against all the corruptions and impostures of superstitious, ignorant or
designing men.

Eighthly, As there is matter of History in the books of the New Testament,
which is best preserved and most edifyingly delivered to the common people, as
nigh as may be in the very words, which, it may be supposed, the divine Penmen
themselves, had they been to interpret their own books into English, or any
other Modern language would have used; so there are also matters of Faith and
Practice: The first of which as containing mysteries above humane
comprehension, ought to be delivered as exactly as is possible in the very
words of the inspired Writers, to do otherwise, being either to pretend to
explain those things which cannot be explained, or to make mysteries of our
own, instead of delivering those of God and Religion. And then as to the rules
of life and practice, they can never appear in a more Authoritative or becoming
garb, than in that which God himself has put them; neither can the native
simplicity and beauty of the Gospel, that peaceable and gentle temper which it
breathes from it self, and is apt to inspire into all that converse with it, be
any way so advantageously and so profitably represented to the world, as by
every man's perusing the Gospels and Epistles for himself, by reading the very
Sermons of our Savior himself, and the advices of his immediate followers and
Apostles, in those very words, or their equivalents in which they were
delivered.

Ninthly, Though it cannot be denied when we have so many and so sad
experiences to convince us of the truth of it, that the reading of the Holy
Scriptures in the vulgar tongue is attended with many inconveniences from the
perverseness, the design, or the ignorance of men; yet those inconveniences
neither are nor can be so great, as that they ought to stand in any degree of
competition with the salvation of the souls of men, which are of infinitely
more price and value than any other consideration whatsoever.

Tenthly, These inconveniences are not so great as those to which not only
particular persons, but Religion it self is exposed by the contrary extreme,
that is, by keeping the Bible locked up in an unknown language, which is in it
self, and has been found by experience in the Romish Church, to have been the
cause of all those monstrous Idolatries and Superstitions, all those absurd
Fables and foolish Traditions, with which that communion is at this day
polluted; and which instead of being so zealously practiced, and so eagerly
pursued after by the Votaries of that way, would by the light of Scripture, if
they were to take their measures from thence, be sufficiently detected and
proportionably abhorred; which is not only manifest from the repugnancy of the
Scripture it self, to such abominable trumperies and wicked impositions upon
the belief or practice of men, but also from the separation of the reformed
Churches from that of Rome, which proceeds altogether upon Scriptural measures,
and cannot be justified upon any other pretense; and still in all ages, ever
since the corruption of Christianity by the Romish artifices, from its first
simplicity into a fardle of absurdities and innovations, those gainful
impieties have been proportionably detected, as there was more or less of
Evangelical light and truth shining forth in the world.

Eleventhly, There never can any so great inconvenience happen by a promiscuous
use of the Holy Scriptures in the vulgar tongues, which may not in a great
measure, if not altogether, be remedied by the strict and impartial severity of
wholesome Laws; and where Laws do not govern the outward practices of men,
though they have nothing to do with private opinions, while they remain such
and do not walk abroad; there the government must of necessity be dissolved,
and all the banks of order and society must give place to a deluge of
Enthusiasm and Fanatique madness.

Twelfthly, There can no mischief or inconvenience follow upon a public
allowance of reading the scriptures in the vulgar tongues, if there be but such
restraints laid upon the practices and opinions of men, as are of absolute
necessity to the peace and security of every Commonwealth; and if thus much may
not be allowed, if every man shall be permitted not only to read the
Scriptures, but to interpret them as he pleases, and to practice in consequence
of his interpretation; so prodigious are the follies, so strong the prejudices,
so rash and inconsiderate the zeal, so wicked and detestable the designs of
abundance of men; that if this be the true English of Gospel-liberty; if this
be that liberty which Christ came to purchase for us, and which he has
entailed upon every follower or disciple of his, then his followers, though
agreeing in this, That they all acknowledge him for their head and leader, will
yet be at as great strife and variance among themselves; nay, and perhaps at
greater too, than if they had been destitute of such a common guide, who by
such an ungovernable, unbounded liberty of interpretation, speaking no certain
sense, but accommodating himself in all things, to the follies, prejudices and
designs of ignorant or wicked men, will instead of being the Prince of Peace,
and the healer of all breaches and animosities among us, prove the certain and
infallible cause of infinite misery and distraction to the world.

FINIS.
The Second EXERCITATION, Concerning the true Pronunciation of the
Tetragrammaton, or four lettered Name of God among the Jews; As also concerning
the Pythagorick Tetractys and other Philological matters that have a connection
with it.
A Ben Ezra in the Introduction to his Paraphrase upon the Book of Esther tells
us the Samaritanes were used to worship Asima, insinuating thereby that they
were Idolaters, though this indeed be but a Rabbinical Equivocation, and is
rather a confession in behalf of those whom he would pretend to accuse, that
they were Worshippers of the true and only God that made Heaven and Earth and
all that therein is; For what is Asima? it is either Ath shema, that is,
Hashem, the name of God among the Jews, or it is (...), him whose name cannot
be expressed in its true sound and pronunciation, and so is the same with the
shem hameporash; or if it be not an Equivocation, it is a downright Falsehood,
for it was not the men of Cuth, as the Jews call the Samaritanes, but those of
Hamath that worshipped Ashima, but the Cuthites Idol was Negal, 2 Kings 17. 30.
and though all the several Nations there mentioned verse 31. may in some sense
be comprehended under the general name of Samaritanes, as being all
transplanted by Salmanasser into that Country, which from Shomron the
Metropolis was usually called Samaria, yet it is manifest that it was but a
very small part of them, that worshipped this Idol Ashima, and therefore Aben
Ezra cannot free himself from the imputation either of an Equivocator or a
false Accuser.

There is also a certain Hebrew Gentleman the Author of a Book called Toledoth
Jeshu, or the Book of the Generations of Jesus, who is so kind to our Savior
as to acknowledge that he was acquainted with the sed shem hameporash, the
Arcanum nominis Tetragrammati, (a mighty secret it seems it was accounted) and
if you will believe all that Suidas tells you in (...), you may then make out
to your self a probable account how he came by this secret, by being of the
number of the Priests themselves, among whom this secret seems to have been
locked up; but though I grant he knew every thing which was possible to be
known, and that from him, as being God, no secret could be hid, yet upon the
Authority of such Jewish Fables as these, no man will believe any thing that
understands what Authority is, and upon what grounds it may safely be relied
upon: For as to the first I shall prove that it was not any such secret as is
pretended, and for the latter, besides many other absurdities in the Story it
self, it is certain that our Savior, any otherwise than by his Virgin Mother's
side, which could not entitle him to the Priesthood, was not of the Tribe of
Levi; but of that of Judah, of which Joseph his reputed Father was descended,
and in whose right by a tacit kind of (...) or Adoption he was the Son of David
and the King of the Jews.

How long the Jews have been ignorant of the true pronunciation of this sacred
Name may be seen in part by Philo Judaeus, who seems to have been ignorant of
it himself, and to pronounce the same of the generality of his Countrymen the
Jews, L. 3. de vita Mosis, where he has these words, speaking of the
Breast Plate which was to be upon the Ephod of the High Priest, Exodus 28. and
particularly of the binding of woven work mentioned v. 32. (...) (...); that
is, about the Breast Plate there went as it were a golden Bracelet, interwoven
with the four Letters of that name, which it is not lawful for any either to
speak or hear, unless it be in the Sanctuary, having first rightly prepared and
purified themselves. Now if it can be proved that Philo had never read the Law
in Hebrew, then it is plain that he himself was ignorant of those letters of
which this name consisted, and this besides other instances which may be given
of his great unskilfulness in the Hebrew Customs and Language, cannot be better
made out, than by the place it self which I have justly newly produced, in the
close of which he says, (...), the Theologue or Divine, that is, Moses, (who by
Lucian in his Philopatris is called (...), the slow Speaker) tells us that this
name consisted of four letters, which Moses does no where say; though indeed as
it was delivered down to Posterity by him, it consisted of no more.

Neither was Josephus any more knowing in this Affair, after'all his brags of
an extraordinary skill above other men, than Philo; his words are these, L. 5.
(...). chapter 15. speaking of the Head-tire of the High Priest, (...); that is,
his head was covered with a Linen Tiara or Mitre, which was to be surrounded
with a blew or purple Lace, about which there was to be another binding of gold
having the four sacred Letters woven in it, now those four Letters are four
Vowels.

Now if these four Letters were not Vowels but Consonants then it is manifest
that Josephus was mistaken, and consequently was unacquainted with the
Tetragrammaton in its original form and appearance.

I am not ignorant that Joseph Scaliger in his Notes upon a fragment of
Porphyrie in Eusebius will needs have it that (...) in Josephus does not
signify Vowels properly so called, but any Letters whatsoever, but by the
favor of so great a man the contrary is unanswerably manifest from the place
it self, for if by (...) immediately foregoing Letters in general are to be
understood, as there is no doubt or question to be made but they are, then it
is manifest that when he adds, (...), these Letters are the four (...), he must
be supposed to restrain the genus of (...) or Letters to the species of (...)
or Vowels; and to say otherwise is but to repeat the same thing several times
over to no purpose, it being as much as if Josephus had said, that the Mitre of
Aaron had a Band about it interwoven with four Letters, which four Letters were
four Letters, so blind are great men sometimes out of a too indulgent fondness
for their own Conceits, when they are hunting about, through all the cold
scents of Criticism to support a very lame and feeble Conjecture, which was
Scaliger's business in this place. It is plain therefore that by (...) in
Josephus, Vowels are to be understood, and that he must be understood of the
name (...), as that holy Name was represented by Philo Byblius out of
Sanchoniathon, for there is no other that I can find or hear of consisting of
four Vowels.

To this place of Josephus I shall add another from his Antiquities, L. 2. p.
61. by which, though it will still appear more plain, how ignorant he was as to
this commonly reputed Mystery, so by the help of what he tells us, we shall
afterward find a way by which this Mystery shall be plainly and
demonstratively revealed. His words are these, speaking of the Miracles that
were wrought to persuade Moses, that it was indeed no other than God himself,
that was about to send him upon so dangerous and so di^pleasing an Errant to
Pharaoh King of Egypt. (...); that is, Moses being no longer able to withstand
so great Testimonies of a Divinity, having seen and heard so great attestations
of a Divine Power; besought him further, that he would continue to give the
same Proofs and Evidences of himself in Egypt, and that he would vouchsafe to
acquaint him with his name, that so when he came to do sacrifice to him, he
might entreat him to be present to and to accept of his Sacrifice by that name
which was most pleasing to him, with which request of his it seemed good to the
Divine Majesty to comply, and to acquaint him with that name of his, which was
till that time unknown to mortal Men, and which it is not lawful for me to
utter.

If it be demanded how this name of God, which is the most proper to him and
the most expressive of his nature, as shall be hereafter declared; came to be
so great a secret, even to the Jews themselves, who ought in reason to be the
most familiarly acquainted with it, as being derived from a Root of their own
Language, there are two accounts to be given of it.

First that general Reverence which has prevailed in all Nations for the name
of God, which by being used upon every ordinary occasion, would render his
Being less respected, and his Power less feared than it ought to be amongst
Men, of which we have a very remarkable Instance in an Epigram of an uncertain
Author in the Anthology. (...) -- (...)



Where the Epigrammatist speaks in a form of solemn swearing, but does not name
that God to whom he makes his appeal. And so also Pindar, as he is cited by
Brodeus in his Notes upon this Epigram, (...); where the Scholiast says, (...);
out of reverence to so sacred a thing as on Oath and to the Gods to whom the
appeal is made, the Ancients were wont to leave out the names of their Gods,
even then when they swear by them. So also Aristophanes in his (...) -- (...).
where the Scholiast thus glosses upon the place; (...); that is, he swears
elliptically or imperfectly, for this is the custom of the Ancients when they
swear, sometimes out of reverence to leave out the name of that God whom they
invoke.

A second cause of this ignorance among the Jews was that this reverence to the
name of God, having in a manner worn it out of use among the Jews themselves,
the Seventy when they came to translate the Law, and Prophets (if indeed they
did translate both at the same time, which is much questioned by learned Men)
would not expose that holy name to the view and knowledge of the Gentile world,
which had been either very nigh or altogether concealed from the Jews
themselves; and therefore in their Translation they always render it by (...),
a ^ame in Greek equally significative of Existence and Authority together, the
first of which, as being the basis of all other Attributes, is the foundation
of the latter. So that the reading of the Scriptures not being permitted the
common Jews (as I have in part proved already, and shall prove more largely and
more clearly by and by) till such time as the Version of the Seventy prevailed
in the world, and was exposed equally to the sight and perusal both of Jew and
Gentile; it is no wonder that this Ignorance in so important a matter instead
of being improved by that Translation, should rather be confirmed and take
deeper root from thence, so as utterly to banish the Knowledge of it, as well
out of the Jewish as the Gentile world; so as had it not been for the Monuments
of Sanchoniathon, and some other remains of Antiquity, known only to the more
curious and inquisitive sort of men, it had been utterly lost and forgotten,
and its true pronunciation could have been only ghess'd at, without any
certainty of truth, as it is at this day, not without a palpable discovery of
their ignorance in the matter, by the Masorethical Pointers of our present
Hebrew Bibles; wherefore Josephus and Philo not being acquainted with those
monuments of Antiquity which I have mentioned, nor with the Original Hebrew it
self, (which I believe to be true of Philo especially, and very probably of the
other also) at least being ignorant of the true punctation of that word, which
since their being carried away captive into Babylon was now utterly lost among
the Jews themselves, it is no wonder they speak of it, as of a name which it
was not lawful to utter, being willing to excuse their unskilfulness by a
pretended reverence for that name whose true pronunciation and ^ound they did
not know.

But, as I have said, though Josephus himself wore a stranger to the
Tetragrammaton or name of God consisting of four Letters, yet by that light
which we may borrow from him, we may be able to demonstrate what this Name was,
of what Consonants it consisted, and with what Vowels it ought to be pointed.

For in the first place, when Moses desired to know by what name he should
invoke Almighty God when he was sacrificing to him, or rather as the Scripture
it self declares it, what name he should make use of to Pharaoh, as the name of
that divine Person by whom he was employed, he adds, (...), God then acquainted
him with that name of his, which till that time was unknown to men, and which
it was not lawful for Josephus to utter. Now this name of God consisting of
four Letters, (for it is the Ehjeh asher Ehjeh, I am that I am, which the
Seventy translate (...), and Philo Judaeus in more places than one (...), I am
he that is) it is manifest that this is the proper Tetragrammaton or sacred
Name of God, to which the Jews have always paid so great and so just a
veneration.

And if we consider further that in the Monuments of the Greek Antiquity there
is extant, as the name of the Supreme Numen among the Jews, (...), as appears
by the voice of Clarius Apollo in Macrobius, and by many other Testimonies
produced by Bochartus, and by two other Inscriptions, the one not known, the
other not taken notice of by him. (...), and
(...).
The first of which is taken notice of by Scaliger in his Notes upon that
Fragment of Porphyrie which I have mentioned; and the last is the Inscription
of an Antique Seal now in the possession of my Reverend and Learned Friend Dr.
Covell, a present great Ornament of that excellent Society, of which I have the
honor and happiness to be a Member.

Lastly, if by a very little variation of the present punctation, instead of
Ehjeh by a segol, we shall read it Ehjoh by an holem, then by taking away the
he which being an aspirate in the middle of a word cannot be expressed in
Greek; that which is left is (...), or for better sound's sake (...), as what
the Hebrew calls Ramathaim, the Seventy for the greater sweetness of the sound
have called (...); and this is the reason why in Greek it consists but of three
Letters, whereas in the Hebrew it has four, because the Aspirate which cannot
be expressed by the Greeks any where but in the beginning of a word is lost,
which is likewise acknowledged by Bochartus in his De Coloniis Phoenicum, L. 1.
c. 9. though in the true Etymon of the word (...) he be as widely mistaken; his
words are these, Insula Chia est insula Serpentis, ex Chiuja, V consonum a
Groecis est necessario omissum, ut in (...) ex Javoh Dei nomine Tetragrammato;
that is, The Island Chia (or Chios) is as much as to say the Island of a
Serpent, from the Syriac Chiuja leaving out the V consonant which by reason of
its aspiration the Greeks cannot express, as in (...) from the Hebrew Javoh
which is the Tetragrammaton or four lettered name of God. But by his Favor
there is no such word as Javoh in the world, no nor Jahoh neither, which was
Saint Jerome's conceit, though the latter Editions have read it corruptly
Jehovah in his Commentary upon Psalm. 8. Prius nomen Domini apud Hebraeos
quatuor literarum est, jod, he, vau, he, quod proprie Dei vocabulum sonat and
legi potest Jahoh, by which he would imply that the Greek (...) answers to this
Jahoh in Hebrew, though still we gain thus much by this Testimony of Saint
Jerome, that the holy Name of God, usually called the Tetragrammaton was
written exactly with the same letters in his days, with those which are now
extant in our Modern Bibles; and the same thing appears likewise in the (...)
of Procopius in Esajah, which I make no question was taken out of the Tetrapla,
or Hexapla, or Octapla of Origin in all which Editions, one Colume was the
Hebrew written in Greek Characters and with Greek Vowels; but the Name of God,
consisting of these four Letters which I have mentioned, was, as I conceive,
(its true pronunciation being at that time unknown to the Jews themselves, or
if it were known it was so superstitiously sacred that it was though unlawful
to utter it) expressed only by its Consonants without the addition of any
Vowels, which being read backwards according to the Eastern Fashion, is exactly
the Procopian (...). And if this explication of (...) which I have given be the
true, it will then answer exactly to that explication of it which is given by
Clemens Alexandrinus from Lib. 5. (...), for both of these ehjoh which is the
Future Tense from hajah will signify, as well because the Future Tense in
Hebrew is both of a future and present signification, sometimes one and
sometimes the other, as becase he that affirms of himself, ehjoh, that is,
(...), or, (...), I will be, or, I am he that will be hereafter, does by that
very affirmation include and suppose his present existence.

Bochartus. his Etymon of this name, is therefore certainly false, as well
because he is forced to recurr to a needless Elision of the V consonant, as
because the ancient Future Tense from Havah was not Javoh but Jehvoh as I shall
prove immediately; and Saint Jerome's Solution is therefore absurd, and
consequently false, upon supposition that Jahoh is from the Present Tense
Havah, because it melts a radical into a quiescent letter, which certainly
ought not to be.

Again, as Josephus in the place last mentioned is to be understood of (...) or
Ehjoh, as has been shown, so when he tells us that the (...) the letters of
which the holy Name of God consisted, were (...), four vowels, it is equally
manifest that he can be understood of no other name, than the (...) of
Sanchoniathon, which he learned of Jerombaal, that is, Gideon, as Bochartus
rightly determines; for there is no other name of God in Hebrew, which being
expressed in Greek Characters, will consist of four vowels but this; and as
(...) answers to the Hebrew ehjoh which is the first Person of the Future Tense
from hajah, so (...) is the Hebrew jehvoh, that is the third Person singular of
the same Future Tense from havah, which is the same with hajah, as our first
Mother Eve was therefore called chauah, with a vau, because she was eem col
chai, the mother of all living, with a jod, and so both of these names as well
(...), will signify the same, and will be both of them expressive of the
Divine Existence which is the foundation of his power; all the difference is
that when God speaks of himself his name is ehjoh, but when men speak of God
his name is jehvoh, and both of them are fitly enough rendered by the Seventy
(...), he that is, or (...), which is the same, for one signification of (...)
is (...), and by the Oracle (...), he whose original is from himself. (...),
(...).
And that the change of the punctation from a segol to a cholem may be no
longer a scruple, I will now show that this was indeed the ancient way of
punctation, from a place of Plautus in his Poenulus, where Milphio thus salutes
Hanno the Carthaginian and his companions in his own Language. Avo Quojates est
is? aut quo ex oppido?
And again,

Ha. Avo Mil. salutat. And a little after, Mi. Avo Donni, which being so often
repeated, it cannot be questioned, but it is the true reading, and that Avo, is
as much as the Latin Ave, salve, that is, it is the Imperative from Havah,
which signifies to be or live; and if Hevoh be the Imperative, then Jehvoh is
the Future, as well in Hebrew as Punique, for these two are in a manner the
very same, as will appear by those large Remains of the Punique Language extant
in Plautus, which have been learnedly explained by comparing them with the pure
Hebrew, by our Countryman Mr. Seldom in his ingenious and learned Treatise de
Diis Syris, by Samuel Petitus in his Miscellanea, and lastly by Bochartus
himself in the second part of his Geographia sacra which is de Coloniis
Phoenicum; besides that the names both of Persons and Places in the Phoenician
Tongue are a sufficient argument of its near affinity or rather perfect
sameness with the pure Hebrew, so that I think for the proof of my Assertion,
here is all the authority that can with reason be expected, but yet to put it
beyond all doubt or question I shall add two or three Considerations more.

And first, whereas Theodoret upon Exodus represents the Samaritane
pronunciation of this holy Name very different from the Hebrew, (...), says
he, (...). From this it is to be observed.

First, That when Theodoret affirms the (...) to have been peculiar to the Jews
in distinction from the Samaritanes, this includes an affirmation that the
Jewish punctation was properly by an Holem.

In the second place, as a farther confirmation of that Pointing and
Pronunciation of this sacred Name which I have assigned, I appeal to the
custom of the Ancients in their adoration of a Sneeze; for as it is still our
custom upon that occasion to say God bless or God save you, Sir, with a bow
toward the person to whom the Salutation was made, so anciently they were used
at all such times, to say, (...), which is the same; the reason of which was,
that the person so affected, does by the very Sneeze it self pronounce the holy
name of God, which is Ehjoh, which being thus casually and involuntarily
pronounced, the standers by were used to invoke him in behalf of the party
Sneezing, saying, Hoshiah, or some such word signifying a Prayer for his health
and safety. And from hence it was that Xenophon cited by Aristotle out of the
third of his (...), calls the Sternutamentum or the Sneeze it self a God, and
the Bird of (...), or Jupiter, the Savior, but not for that reason which he,
not understanding the true original of this Custom, assigns, (...), because it
proceeds out of that most Divine and Godlike part of the head, which is the
seat of Reason, or of Ratiocination. For I make no manner of question but the
true reason was that which I have assigned, and the rather because he calls it
not only a God, but the bird of Jupiter Servator, which puts me in mind of a
passage in Plato, where Socrates exhorts to sacrifice a Cock to Aesculapius,
for this Aesculapius is Jupiter Servator, and the sound of a Cock crowing, is
much the same with that of a Sneeze in men, Ehjoh.

For this reason it was that they used to consult a Sneeze as a certain Oracle
to resolve them in doubtful Cases, or in future Events: So the Husband in the
Epigram that had a mind to be rid of a troublesome Wife, Sneez'd over her Grave
in a public Burying place, to know when she would die.

L. 1. (...).

(...).
Propertius, Aridus Argutum sternuit Omen Amor.


Catullus,

Acmen Septimius suos amores
Tenes in Gremio, mea, inquit, Acme,
Ni te perdite amo atque amare porro
Omnes sum assidue paratus annos,
Quantum qui pote plurimum perire,
Solus in Lybid Indiaque tosta
Caesio veniam obvius Leoni.
Hoc ut dixit, Amor, sinistra, ut ante,
Dextram sternuit approbationem.
Which place of Catullus I have cited thus largely, because the latter part of
it which cannot be understood without what goes before, is so excellently
Translated by Mr. Cowley, with allusion to the ancient custom of bowing and
adoring a Sneeze.

The God of Love, that stood to hear him,
(The God of Love was always near him)
Pleased and tickled with the sound,
Sneez'd aloud, and all around.
The little Loves that waited by,
Bowd and blessed the Augury.
A third reason by which my Conjecture concerning the Tetragrammaton may be
confirmed, is that in Antiquity we find mention also of a seven-lettered name
of God. So the Oracle (...).
And in the Epigram, (...)
(...) --
which places when Scaliger endeavors to explain by HOA (...), he trifles most
egregiously, for how is that HOA by which he designs to express the Hebrew
(...), a part of the name of God? neither does he mend the matter when he is,
as he is afterward, in a quandary with himself, whether he should explain it
of the Egyptian Serapis, or of the Basilidian Abraxas, both of which have seven
letters, but by his favor, neither of them seven vowels; which is the thing
requisite to explain these two Citations, especially the latter, for he does
not only say that they are (...), but also (...), which for the reasons already
given in our Discourse of (...), can be understood of nothing but vowels, which
can be explained no better, than by putting both the names of God already
mentioned together, which the ignorance of the Greeks might well enough jumble
into one thus, (...).

Neither is it at all material in this case, that some of these Vowels are
twice repeated, for there are not seven vowels in all; and the Rabbis by the
same way of speaking, call the Tetragrammaton shem shel Arbah Othijoth, the
name of God consisting of four letters, though the He be twice repeated. And
from hence we may see the error of Bochartus in these words. Geogr. Sac. p.
856. Eusebius habet (...) sed Theodoretus (...), quod ideo praefero, quia Dei
nomen (...), Groeci vix aliter efferunt, for I think by this time it is
sufficiently clear, that as well (...) as (...), was the real and undoubted
name of God answering to the Hebrew Jehvoh.

Lastly, God is not only called in Scripture Ehjoh, and Jehvoh, but more
contractedly Jah, which is described in Scripture as his peculiar and
incommunicable name; so in the Psalms, at the close of a Psalm or Versicle,
Hallelu Jah, which the LXX. render (...); and Psa. 68. 4. Sing unto God, sing
praises to his Name: extol him that rides upon the Heavens by his name JAH,
and rejoice before him. Hebr. bejah shmo. Symmachus (...). the ancient version
which was called quinta Editio. (...). LXX. (...); from all which we have a
clear account both of its true pronunciation and its true meaning. Its true, or
at least its most common pronunciation was Jah, and its meaning is (...), that
is, (...) the same with Ehjoh, and Jehvoh; it is therefore the Imperative Mood
from Hajah, as from Halac or jalac, is Lek, from Nagash, Gash, and the like;
and as the other names are as much as to say he is, or he shall continue to be,
so this is as much as to say let him be, or let him live; it is vox per
gratulationem agnoscentis and adorantis existentiam Dei. So Romans 3. 4. Let God
be true and every man a liar, is as much as if the Apostle had said in two
Categorical Enunciations, God is true and every man is a liar. And Psalm. 69.
34. Let the Heaven and Earth praise him, the Seas and every thing that moves
therein; that is, they do actually praise him, by being through all ages
constant and perpetual testimonies of his goodness and power.

It will be objected, that if the second Future be Ehjoh, the imperative or
first Future ought to be Hejoh, or joh, not Jah, and this is true; but why may
it not be both of these, both in the imperative and future, though the
punctation by a Pathach be more common in the imperative, and that by a Cholem
in the future? for after all what if that (...) of the Samaritanes, or as
Scaliger represents it, (...), be not so much a mistake, or a wilful error, as
one of the ancient ways of Pointing this holy Name; that is, Jahvah, or Jehvah?
of which opinion Scaliger seems to have been; and if that reading which Mr.
Seldom represents as the common reading, be the true, which is not the (...) of
Bochartus, but (...); then this place of Theodoret does not so much represent
the difference of the Samaritane from the Hebrew, as of the Hebrew from it
self, being the two Names of God, the one the Tetragrammaton Jehvah or Jehvoh,
the other, as I may so call it, the Digrammaton, which is Jah; though
Haeschelius not having considered those places of the Seventy, and Symmachus,
and the Fifth Edition which I have mentioned, would needs have it (...), and in
this he is followed by Mr. Seldom and Bochartus, though I see no reason to
believe otherwise, than that they may be all mistaken.

From Jah is the Greek (...), the Jod being changed into the Greek (...), as
these two letters are easily changed into one another; as from (...) is Jugum,
from (...) the French Jaloux, and the English Jealous.

Pherecydes Syrius,

(...)
(...)
(...)
From the same Original likewise, is the (...) in Alexander Trallianus in his
Magical Charm for the Cure of the Gout; as (...) in the same Author, is
exactly the Greek (...), or the Hebrew Ehjoh, the He finale not being quiescent
as in (...), but changed into Th, as Pharaoh in the Hebrew, is in the LXX.
Pharaoth, and in Josephus Pharaothes and Phraates, for these are both of them
the same name.

I was once of Opinion also, that the Abraxas of the Basilidians so often
mentioned, was as much as (...) in composition with (...), as much as to say
(...), as God is often called in Scripture; but since I see Reason to change my
mind, not only from the ancient Inscriptions and ancient Copies, which do more
frequently represent (...) than (...), but chiefly because Tertullian de
Praescriptionibus, represents Abraxas as the supreme Numen of Basilides and
Valentinus, who yet notwithstanding, looked upon the God whom the Jews
worshipped, under the notion and character of an inferior Deity, being only
the Tutelar Angel of the particular Province of Judea: therefore I concur with
that account which Tertullian and other of the Fathers give of it, that it was
only an Adumbration of the Sun or the Solar year, which consists of 365 days,
which number is made up by the numeral Potestas of those letters of which
Abraxas consists. I had likewise once such another conceit of the
Abracadabra, which is a Charm for the Cure of the Hemitritean or Double Tertian
Ague in Serenus Sammonicus, because Chad or Echad, which signifies unity in
Hebrew, is reckoned by Macrobius as one of the names of God; but this I confess
is a little hard, and therefore I am rather of opinion, that it was a Magical
word made at random, all whose power consists in this, that the beginning and
end of it are the same, to signify the returns of the Fit, but the middle of a
very different and disagreeing sound to denote the day of intermission.

From (...) by a very light mutation is the Greek (...) which is the name of
Jupiter upon the Theban Monument in Porphyrie, (...).


From (...) is the oblique case (...) or (...) in the common Greek, and from
thence is the Latin Janus, the Eolique (...) and the Latin Juno; as Salmasius
upon Lampridius, and Aegidius Menagius upon Diogenes Laertius have observed,
though the last of these may perhaps be rather from the Syriack Junoh, or
Jonoh, which signifies a Dove, in which form Semiramis was worshipped among the
Assyrians; Tzetzes for better sound sake, leaves out the jod, and calls it
(...),

(...)
(...),
(...) --
Lastly, From the Hebrew Jah, by turning the He into an Aspirate, was the Greek
(...), and the Latin Jacchus.

Again, as from Jah is (...) and Zan and Zano and Janus, and the rest that have
been mentioned, so also in the Heathen Mythology, there want not manifest
footsteps of the other punctation by a Cholem; for as from Jah is (...), so
from Joh is (...) or (...), for so they pronounced it, as is evident from the
Latin jouis derived from it, which was not pronounced anciently, as I conceive,
by an v consonant or Eolique Digamma, but by an u vowel; and so Jupiter, is as
much as Jouipiter, which I look upon to be a clearer Etymology than either
Juvans Pater, which was the conceit of Cicero, Agellius and Lactantius among
the Ancients, or Jovis Pater of the Moderns, which with the Eolique Digamma is
much more harsh, because it depends upon an unnecessary contraction of the
word, than if by dissolving that v consonant into a vowel it be all melted down
into one Syllable, which by the addition of Pater, is of it self without any
further former ation, the very word enquired after; unless you would have it to
be (...), which turns to the same account, and therefore I shall not be against
it, though in the latter the Analogy be more exact, as in Marspiter, Diespiter,
and such other words; besides that, it answers indifferently both to Jopiter
and Jupiter, which were the two several ways of writing it among the Romans,
who were always used to add the title of Pater or Genitor to the names of all
their Gods.

Lucilius,

Vt nemo sit nostrum, quin Pater optimu' Divum,
Vt Neptun' Pater, Liber, Saturnu' Pater, Mars,
Janu', Quirinu' Pater, nomen dicatur ad unum.
Where Mr. Seldom after Dousa, instead of Nomen dicatur, will needs have it
omnes dicamur, not considering that the quantity of the Verse will not bear it,
nor understanding what is the true meaning of Nomen in this place, which is not
what we call a proper name, and the Latins otherwise vocabulum; but it is
Numen, which was the old way of writing, and of which by going no further than
the Glossary of Philoxenus, you may soon be furnished with Five hundred
Instances.

Thus Ennius in Lactantius introduces the people of Rome praying to Romulus
after he had been snatched from them, in these words.

-- O Romule, Romule, dic, O
Qualem te Patriae custodem Dii genuerunt?
Tu produxisti nos intra hominis auras,
O Pater, O Genitor, O Sanguen Diis oriundum.
And in the same Language Aeneas bespeaks his Followers and Companions
concerning Anchises in Virgil.

Nunc Pateras libate Jovi, precibusque vocate
Anchisen Genitorem --
Where by Genitor is not understood the Father of Aeneas, though that he was
too, but him that was now translated into the order and dignity of the Gods.

So, also among the Greeks' (...) is as much as Abheljon, Pater excelsus, the
high or lofty Father, which is a very fit name for the Sun; and this puts me in
mind of that place of Horace, -- Credat Judaeus Apella Non Ego --



Where there are some that will needs have Apella to be as much as Sine Pelle,
or Verpus, which the quantity of the Verse will not suffer. Wherefore the true
reading is (...), Apellas, that is, Apollonius, or Apollodorus, or
Apollinarius; as Theudas is Theodosius, Hermas is Hermotimus or Hermodorus,
Epaphras is Epaphroditus, Antipas is Antipater, Cleophas is Cleophilus, Joses
is Josephus, and many other of the like nature.

And Baal Peor because he is supposed by St. Jerome in more places than one, and
by Isidore in his Origenes, to be the same with Priapus of the Greeks and
Latins, is therefore thought by Dionysius Vossius in his Notes upon Maimonides
de Idololatria, to be as much as Peor Ab, or Father Peor, (the same Idol being
sometimes in Scripture called simply Peor, as well as with the addition of
Baal, Bahal Pehor) but this conceit is evidently too far fetched, and after all
Mr. Seldom will not allow that Priapus and Baal Peor are the same, or at least
he will not grant what this Etymon supposes that the Greeks were beholding to
the Moabites and Midianites for their God Priapus; but the words of Isidore
well considered, will help us to the true Original, they are these, L. 8.
Beelphegor interpretatur simulachrum ignominiae. Idolum enim fuit Moab
cognomento Baal super montem Phegor, quem Latini Priapum vocant Deum hortorum.
He tells you that Priapus was Deus hortorum, and that is well enough known,
though Isidore had been silent, Priapus therefore is not Pehor Ab, but Pri Ab
the Father of Fruits. And for this reason he is made to preside not only over
Gardens, but Ports by the Sea side, because thither as to a common Receptacle,
the fruitfulness and plenty of the whole World repairs; or because in the Sea
there is a spirituous and volatile which is the Principle of life and
fruitfulness in the world; from whence it is that Venus the Mother and supreme
cause of all vital Fecundity among the Heathens, is called (...), as being
supposed to be born of the Foam or Salt supreme of the Sea; and Salax in Latin
is derived from Sal, and all the sorts of Salsamenta are known to be (...) and
in this sense Priapus, as in Isidore's notion he, is Custos hortorum, so in the
Greek Epigrams he is called (...), which is as much as the Greek Palaemon, or
the Latin Portunus, that is, custos portuum, a Portubus tuendis, as Neptunus
who is also the same, is not from (...), in Plutarch, which I believe to be a
word of no signification, though he interprets it to denote the Sea shore; but
it is nevitunus, a nevibus, hoc est, navibus tuendis, as (...) and (...) in
Greek are the same, and Nevius the old Latin Poet, is certainly the same name
with Navius the Augur in Florus and Livy.

And as the Heathen Deities were usually called Patres, and Genitores, by which
title the Self-existence and the Prolifick fruitful nature of the Deity was
signified; so also they are no less frequently styled, (...), Reges, Kings, by
which their dominion and sovereignty over all things was denoted; and as by the
first of these that notion of the Tetragrammaton is fulfilled by which it is
rendered (...), so by the latter that other signification of it from whence the
LXX. have rendered it by an Hebrew word (...) is represented, both of which
together are comprehended in (...), as has been already observed.

But this title though it be applied sometimes to the inferior Deities, as to
Apollo in Homer, yet it most properly signified him who was as it were the King
and Sovereign over the rest; so Homer invokes Jupiter (...). And Juvenal, Credo
pudicitiam Saturno Rege moratam In terris --



From hence it was that from the Hebrew Melech, the Ammonites called that God
whom they worshipped, who is supposed to be the same with Saturn or Jupiter
Latiaris, Molech, and Moloch and Milcom. And the Sepharvaites in the book of
Kings, worshipping two supreme Beings, as the Manicheans afterward did, the one
the Author of all good, the other of all evil and mischief, called the one
Anamelech, that is, the Gracious King, who was worshipped for his goodness, the
other Adramelech, that is, the Strong or Powerful King, who was feared and
adored for his Power; to which among the Carthaginians with the addition of
Bahal instead of Melech, the names of Annibal and Asdrubal do exactly answer,
and part of the signification of the latter of these is likewise to be found in
Adrumetum a Colony of the Phoenicians upon the Coast of Africa, which is not
Chatsarmaveth, or Chatsarmoth, as Drusius and Casaubon after Scaliger would
have had it, which opinion is sufficiently confuted by Bochartus himself;
neither is it Chatsar Maathan, that is, Regio Centum, because it seems the
Country thereabouts was so fruitful as to produce a crop of an hundred fold,
as Bochartus himself will needs have it. For first, when he translates Chatsar
by Regio, he does not consider that Adrumetum was not the whole Country, but
one particular Town upon the Coast. And secondly, when by the addition of the
Syriack Mathan, he makes it to signify a fruitful Country, bringing forth an
hundred fold; this is such an Elliptical way of speaking, as not being backed
by any other probability than the bare likeness of sound, would not have been
allowed for a tolerable conjecture by Bochartus himself, had it been any other
man's but his own; but it is the nature of Mankind to be fond of Monsters,
Idiots and Cripples, so they be but of their own begetting.

It appearing therefore how slight and unsatisfactory Bochartus his conjecture
is, I do humbly propose instead of it, Adir Mot, Adir is validus, potens, and
is a part of the composition in Adramelech and Asdrubal, and Mot by Philo
Byblius out of Sanchuniathon is sometimes rendered (...), lutum, and sometimes
(...), a mixture of Water and Earth together, a slimy or Marish Land, a Fen or
Bogg, in English we call it more exactly Mud, which may well enough be a
Phoenician word, if it be true what Bochartus tells us, that the Phoenicians
traded hither for Lead and Tin, and that from hence these Islands had their
name of Britain, as in Greek they are called (...), the Tin Islands; so that
Adrumetum is as much as arx, praesidium, munimentum, propugnaculum, luto, aut
aggere aut vallo cinctum, which was the only way of fortification in the
earliest times, by mud walls and heaps of Earth thrown up together, like the
fortification of the Roman Camps, or like the lines about London and Colchester
in the time of the Civil War.

Thus it was that Semiramis fortified Babylon, for which, if it had not been,
we should have had but little mention of her in the ancient Story; this action
of hers being mentioned, as her greatest enterprise, by all that speak any
thing concerning her, so that from thence she seems to have had her name. For
Chemer Ramis is as much as Lutum calcatum, or pressum, in the language of the
East; and it is particularly applied to Walls and Fortifications in the book of
Nahum, c. 3. 14. Draw the waters for the siege: fortify the strong holds, go
into clay and tread the mortar: make strong the brick-kilne. Where what we
render tread the mortar, is in the Hebrew Rimsi bachomer; so also in the
building of Babel after the Flood, it is said, Genesis 11. 3. They had brick for
stone, and slime had they for mortar; in the Hebrew, by a very pleasant (...)
it is thus: Vatehi lahem halebenah leaben vehachemar hajah lahem lachomer. 70.
(...).

And as a further confirmation of this conjecture concerning Adrumetum, it is
to be considered that there was also another place, which was likewise a
Phoenician Colony, which the Greeks call (...), being either the same with
Thebae Hypoplaciae, or very nigh it, and the Bay or Promontory upon which it
stood was from thence called Sinus Adramyttenus ((...)) this Bochartus himself,
as to the latter part of its composition will have to be from the Phoenician
(...), as much as Chatsar mot, that is, Regio lutosa; but for his Chatsar, the
former inconvenience returns, it being not the whole Country, but one
particular Town which was called by this name. Wherefore I make no question,
but these being two places, both built by the Phoenicians, and both so very
like in sound, that what little difference there is, may justly be suspected to
have come rather from the corruption of the Greeks, than from the Phoenicians
themselves; this, as well as the other, is no more than Adir mot, that is, arx
lutea, which Etymon will receive infinite advantage of probability above that
of Bochartus, from these two Considerations.

First, That besides what has been said of the Names of Asdrubal and Annibal
above, it appears, and may be proved that the very word Adir was a Phoenician
word; so Priscian in his 5th Book makes Abaddir, that is, Pater magnificus, or
validus or potens, to be the name of a God; and St. Austin in his 44th Epistle
does peculiarly refer it to the Gods of the Phoenicians.

Secondly, There is no question but both of those places lying upon the
Seacoast, and being intended by the Phoenicians in their Voyages for the
convenience of Carining, and Tallowing, and taking in fresh water, and trading
up the Country, there was always a constant Garrison of Phoenicians in them
both; and they were both of them places fortified as well as the skill of those
times would allow, and this the word Chatsar was very unfit to express, it
being expressly applied to Country Villages, and midland Cottages without walls,
Levit. 25. 31. therefore all that is meant by Adrumetum, or Atramyttium, for
they are both the same, is no more than a Garrison or place of strength
fortified with a mud-wall; and so all these things do mutually strengthen and
confirm one another.

Before I leave this digression, being got thus far out of my way, as it is
very easy for any man to wander who is talking of matters of this nature, I
will step aside a little farther, to take notice of an error of Joseph Scaliger
and correct it. Philo Judaeus in the life of Moses, says, that among the
Egyptians (...), Mos is as much as to say water; and from thence he would have
Moses to derive his name, because he was taken out of the water: this Scaliger
rejects with the superciliousness of a Critic, and not without some signs of a
triumphant insultation over the ignorance of Philo; in which after all he is
but partly in the right, and partly mistaken: For I am of Scaliger's mind, that
Moses had his name from Maslah extraxit, because he was taken or drawn out from
among the Flags or Bulrushes by the River side, Exodus 2. 10. And she called his
name Moses, and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. In which words,
notwithstanding, the action of drawing, and the place from whence he was drawn,
the water, seems to have had an equal share in the giving him his name;
therefore if (...) at last do happen to signify water in the Egyptian
language, then Scaliger was very much mistaken, and Philo not so much as he
would make him seem.

It is to be considered therefore, that he was not drawn out of the mere fluid
Element, nothing but water, but from among the Flags, that is, a marshy, slimy
place, which is the Greek (...), and the Latin Palus, and answers exactly to
the Phoenician (...), or (...), for they are both the same, and do neither of
them signify simple water, but what Philo Byblius calls (...), or (...); so
that though Philo in this do not altogether hit the exact propriety of the
word, yet neither is he altogether mistaken, it being no more than what others
have been guilty of as well as he; for what the Hebrew in the description of
the Primigenial Mass calls Tehom, the 70 call (...), and both of them mean a
confused jumble of earth and water together, but yet the Greek Lexicographers
expound (...), and from thence it was that Thales had his opinion, that all
things sprang out of the water. And after all, since the Egyptian language is
utterly lost, and since Maim in Hebrew signifies water, which anciently, for
ought we know, might be pointed Moim, if you consider the extreme likeness of a
Samech and a Mem in the Chaldee or Assyrian Character, Philo may not be so much
to blame as Scaliger would represent him; and besides those Eastern languages
bating some words peculiar to each, differing only as Dialects do from one
another, we cannot at this day pronounce what allowance is to be made to
Philo's interpretation, upon account of the difference of sound, arising from
the diversity of Dialect in the Egyptian and Hebrew Speech.

I could have furnished Scaliger with a better instance, to show how little
skill Philo had in any of the Eastern Languages, being so unskilful as he was
in the Hebrew it self, as appears among other things by his interpretation of
the word Cherubim, which he renders (...). In which exposition of his he takes
no notice of the Caph, which is a radical letter; and the Nun at the latter
end, which is only a formative of the plural number is by him advanced into the
dignity of a radical; the foundation of the conceit lying in this, that Rab is
(...), and Rob is (...), multitudo, and Boun signifies (...), from whence Binah
answers to the Hebrew Chochmah, and to the Greek (...); and yet this
interpretation, as bad as it is, is as good as that of the Rabbis, who are the
great pretenders to Hebrew, who will have Caph to be a servile letter, and the
whole word to be as much as Cherubia, or Cherabia, because, forsooth, Rabia in
Chaldee signifies a boy or youth, of which shape and appearance they will have
the Cherubims to have been; whereas there is no question but the true
derivation is from Carab to ride, which is particularly applied to Spirits and
to God himself in Scripture, as in that place of the Psalms already cited, 68.
4. Extol him that rides upon the heavens by his name Jah. Of whom also it is
said, 2 Samuel 22. 11. He rode upon a Cherub, and did fly, and he was seen upon
the wings of the wind. And so because the Cherubs in the sanctuary were made
with wings, therefore wings are attributed in Scripture to God himself, Psalm.
17. 8. Keep me as the apple of thine eye: hide me under the shadow of thy
wings. And in many other places.

Another manifest remainder of the punctation of the digrammaton, or
two-lettered name of God by a Cholem, is the Jo of the Latins so frequently
prefixed to the names of all their Gods, as Jo Paean, Jo Bacche, Jo Triumph,
Jo Hymenaee; in which instances Jo is the general name of the supreme Numen,
joined to the particular Deities thereafter mentioned, who were all of them the
supreme Numen under different notions, as the Basilidians are found to have
added the name (...) to that of their supreme Deity Abraxas: And this, if it
will hold, as I see no reason why it should not, is a further confirmation of
that explication of the seven-lettered name of God, which I have mentioned;
that is, (...), in which (...) is added exegetically, to show that (...) is the
name of the supreme Numen, as in Abraxas.

The Mauritanians worshipped their King Juba. Minucius Felix. Et pejerante
Proculo Deus Romulus, and Juba Mauris volentibus Deus est, and Divi caeteri
Reges qui consecrantur, non ad sidem Numinis, sed ad honorem emeritae
potestatis. Lactantius. Romani Caesares suos consecraverunt and Mauri Reges
suos. L. 1. c. 15. And a little after, Privatim vero singuli populi gentis aut
urbis conditores, summa veneratione coluerunt, ut Aegyptii Isidem, Mauri Jubam,
Macedones Cabirum, etc. And Mr. Seldom would have it, that this Juba of the
Moors was no other than the God of the Hebrews, the Tetragrammaton it self;
perhaps so, if you consider the nearness of sound betwixt Jehvoh or Jehvah* and
Juba, and the nearness of the Pure Hebrew to the Punick or African language;
for as from Havah is Jehvoh, or Jehvah in Kal; so in Hophal it will be Juhvoh,
or Juhvah, and by its Passive signification, it may denote the stability and
rootedness, or firmitude of the divine Being.

Lastly, From (...) is the Aeolick or Dorick (...), from whence, according to
the common way of declining, is (...) in the accusative case, that is, Zah,
from Jah, as the Doricks express the (...) of the common Dialect by (...), as
in (...), and the like.

But from all this I think there is abundant demonstration, whatever other ways
of pointing there might be among the Jews or Samaritanes, or other Nations,
that among the Jews themselves, the most ordinary and usual pronunciation of
the Tetragrammaton, and that which the Greeks received from them, was Ehjoh and
Jehvoh, and that of the Digrammaton, which was most usual, was Jah.

I shall conclude this business with the words of Mr. Seldom, though he knew
nothing of what I have here declared, Syntag. c. 1. de Diis Syris, p. 208, 209.

(...) --
In which words, which it is needless to translate at length, Mr. Seldom
affirms, and sufficiently proves by the instance of Rabshakeh, who frequently
mentions and defies this Sacred Name, that it was not unknown to the Gentile
world; and what he affirms of Jehvoh, which I have proved to be its most
common, if not its only pronunciation, the same is likewise true of the name
Ehjoh, which was as sacred as the other, and may as properly be called the
Tetragrammaton, that this also was known to the Heathens, it being that very
name by which God declared himself to Pharaoh and the Egyptians by the hand of
Moses; and I think, though we had not Mr. Selden's Authority to vouch us, yet I
have sufficiently proved it from the Monuments of the Heathen Antiquity, which
have so exactly represented all these three names, which in their original and
root are all the same, of Ehjoh, and Jehvoh, and Jah, that the matter hereafter
will not bear any longer dispute among learned men.

Secondly, Mr. Seldom tells us, that the seventy Interpreters do always
interpret (...) by (...), or (...), which are in Greek and Hebrew both the
same, and do exactly answer to one another. From whence there are two things
observable: First, That the Rabbis, who always point this name with the points
of Adonai, unless when Adonai it self is joined together with it, have
manifestly borrowed this way of pointing from the rendition of the 70;
notwithstanding they would fain make us believe that they are wiser than they,
and that they are not beholding to them in any kind whatsoever. Secondly, We
see how ancient this superstitious reverence for the sacred and incommunicable
name has been, that the 70 have no where expressed it, by its proper Letters
and Vowels, which is not only true of (...), but of (...), and (...) too,
though the last of these be expressed by (...) in (...); yet so, as that the
Name of God is hid in the composition, and cannot be discovered by one not
skilled in the Hebrew language.

Lastly, He tells us that the Pythagorean Tetractys, which was so great a
secret in that School, was no other than the Tetragrammaton of the Hebrews,
that is, the name Jehvoh; for this is that name which is generally called the
Tetragrammaton, though Ehjoh in its Hebrew form (though not as represented by
the Greeks) have as much right to it as the other.

And in this conceit Mr. Seldom tells us he differs from the interpretum turba,
the common crowd of Interpreters, though neither is he singular in this
conjecture; and if he had gone along with the crowd, he had been less mistaken.
For this is a very idle surmise of learned men to think that in this name there
was any sacredness in the number four, since Jah, which consists but of two
letters, was every whit as sacred as the other, and as peculiar to God, as
incommunicable to any besides him, and as studiously concealed from the
knowledge of the Heathen World, by the 70 Interpreters, as the other two, which
have all of them the same Fountain and Origination.

The ground of this mistake does sufficiently consute it self; for all the
reason of this conjecture is founded only upon this, That the name of God was
called by the Greeks Tetragrammaton, which seems by its sound, and by the
signification of its number to answer to the Pythagorean Tetractys; but they do
not consider, though the Rabbis after the Greeks have called the same name in
its original, shemshel Arbah Othijoth, as has been already observed, yet the
Greeks meant it only of the (...), that is, of the Name of God, not as kept
secret from the Heathen World, but as revealed to it, as has already been made
appear; so that at this rate Pythagoras would have had but little reason to
boast of his Mystery, which lay open to the view of all curious inquirers, as
well of himself and his disciples; for the time of Pythagoras, according to
Livy and Dionysius Halicarnassensis, falls above an hundred years lower than
that of Numa, who was contemporary with Hezekias, being toward the latter end
of the Babylonish captivity, or about the return from it; whereas
Sanchuniathon, who had his information from Gideon, and who was the first by
whom this name was communicated to the Gentile World, belongs to the interval
of the Judges, before that which was usually reputed the oldest Epoche of time,
The Trojan War, and within less than Two hundred years of Moses himself, to
whom this Holy Name was first imparted.

Besides, that though Sanchuniathon were perhaps the first who did in writing
divulge this name to the Heathen World, yet is it plain from what has been
said of its being communicated to Pharaoh himself and his Egyptians, in the
time, and by the information of Moses himself, that it was got abroad long
before his time, and that it was no sooner imparted to the Israelites
themselves, than foreigners were made acquainted together with them; neither is
it probable when Rabshakeh so frequently ingeminates this blessed Name, that he
received his knowledge of it, from the Phoenician Monuments of Sanchuniathon;
but that it was then as publicly known, as it is now lost and forgotten, by
being studiously concealed by the superstition of aftertimes, or by that
common calamity, which the Babylonish captivity brought upon the Jewish Nation
and Language together.

But after all, it is nothing but want of skill in Grammar, which has been the
reason hitherto why learned men have favored this opinion, That the Tetractys
and the Tetragrammaton are the same. For what is Tetractys?

It is to be considered that the Pythagorick Philosophy was used to explain all
things after a mystical manner by numbers and proportions, in which one, or
unity, or (...) is the most simple, undivided, and perfectly indivisible root
of all things; two, or what the Pythagoreans call the Dyas, is the first
principle of multiplicity or composition, and both of these added together,
make the number three; in which, if you suppose each unite, to be one side of
an oequilateral Triangle, and then by counting the sides after the Triangle is
built, you begin at any side indifferently one, two, three, you come then back
again to that side from whence you set out; which being considered in two
different respects, as the terminus a quo, and the terminus ad quem of this
computation; the whole Triangle is therefore called the Tetractys, because a
Triangle returning into its head or fountain is the number four. And these
numbers added to one another 1, 2, 3, 4. make the number ten, which is, as it
were, the Universal Basis of infinite numeration.

But that in this I may not seem to represent my own fond conceits, instead of
the truth and reality of the Pythagorean Doctrine, I will here produce a place
of Lucian out of his (...), which will both confirm what I have said, and may
be explained by it. (...). It is a discourse between Pythagoras, who stood to
be sold for a Slave in the Market, and the person who came to cheapen and buy
him; Pythagoras tells him he was able to teach him Music, Geometry and
Arithmetic: Arithmetic, said he, I understand that already: Say you so, said
Pythagoras; let me hear you number. At which he beginning to count, one, two,
three, four: Do you see, said Pythagoras, that which you call four, is indeed
ten, a perfect or oequilateral Triangle, and the Oath of me and my followers.
Then by that greatest of Oaths, the number four, said he, I never till now
heard such divine and excellent discourse as this.

It appearing therefore by this place, that four in the Pythagorick School was
as much as ten, and that it was usually compared to an oequilateral Triangle,
from hence we may see what is the meaning of the Triangle, from hence we may
see what is the meaning of the Tetractys; for as (...) is the number four,
which was the first root and basis of all number and proportion, and
consequently the great Principle of their natural Philosophy, (For by (...), or
an unite, they mean a material Atome; and by their Dyas and Trias the first
complexions of those Atoms with one another, as is manifest from the use of
(...) in the Anthology. -- (...)
(...).)
From hence it comes to pass, that (...) is the art or mystery of resolving all
causes and effects into the number four, or of explaining all the Phoenomena of
nature according to the Pythagorick mode. As (...) is an Harp, and (...)
derived from it the art or skill of playing upon the Harp, exactly according to
the same Analogy.

Homer.

(...),
(...).
(...)
(...).

(...) KI^API^TYN.
Neither is it at all favorable to this groundless fancy, that the
Pythagoreans were used to swear by the Tetractys, for they were used to swear
by their Master himself, as has been already noted out of Mr. Seldom,

(...).

And then at the same time they tell you plainly what this Tetractys was,
(...), the source and fountain of everlasting or universal nature, or that
which contained in it the roots and seeds, that is, the first principles of the
Pythagorick Physiology, from whence it is plain that the Tetractys is to be
understood in that sense which I have already explained.

It is true that the Name of God in Hebrew did really consist of four letters;
but yet it is equally true, that in that number there was no Mystery placed
among the Jews themselves, who did not take any such religious notice of it,
but it was afterward by the Greeks, long after the time of Pythagoras, that it
was called the Tetragrammaton; which yet notwithstanding had nothing more of
sacredness or peculiarity in it, than the Digrammaton or Name of God,
consisting of two letters, as has been sufficiently proved.

Besides, the Jews did not use to Swear by the number four, and therefore the
Pythagoreans could not have it from them, but by the number seven, for Nishbah
in Hebrew signifies to swear, whose root is Shebah signifying seven; and it is
as much as to say, that they swear by him who in six days made Heaven and
Earth, and all that therein is, and rested from his labors on the seventh. And
as Nishbah is to swear, so Shebouah, which signifies the septenary number,
signifies also an Oath; that is to say, an Oath by him who completed the
Creation in six days, and rested the seventh. This was also the meaning of
those seven ewe lambs, which Abraham had set aside to be a witness between
himself and Abimilech, that he had dug the well, Genesis 21. 28, 29, 30. That
is, it was a Symbolical appeal to God as the witness of the Covenant between
himself and Abimilech. This was also the meaning, not only of the weekly
Sabbath, but also of the Sabbatical years, and of the years of Jubilee, which
consisted of the Multiplication of the Sabbatical period by it self. The same
account is also to be given, why the Solemnities of the Passover, Feast of
weeks and of Tabernacles, consisted all of them of seven days, and why there
were seven weeks to be numbered from the second day of unleavened bread, to the
feast of Pentecost; it was a kind of Jubilee of days, as the other was of
years, being to commence at the expiration of that term, which consisted of the
Paschal Festivity, consisting of seven days, multiplied by it self: This was
the reason why of the clean beasts seven, by the Divine appointment, were to be
admitted into the Ark; whereas of the unclean, there were to be but two; for
that there were more than two, in the General, this depended upon this reason,
that they were afterward permitted for food as well as for sacrifice, and so
it was necessary more of the clean kind should be preserved than the other; but
that there were to be just seven, neither more nor less, this had a mystical
allusion in it, and pointed at him, to whom as the author and finisher of all
things in the space of seven days, the seventh was to be offered up in
sacrifice when they came out of the Ark.

To the same symbolical account we must also put the number of persons that
entered into the Ark, which were eight in all; but Noah is to be considered as
distinct from the rest under the notion of a Priest; that as the World was
created in six days, so it might be restored and replenished by six persons,
Noah's three Sons and their Wives, while the seventh, that is, Noah's Wife,
being now past Childbearing, may be looked upon as now wholly devoted to the
service of God, and may answer that seventh among the clean species of Animals,
which was to be for sacrifice at their coming out of the Ark; or else the eight
persons are the septenary number returning into it self, by including both the
terms, as in the Pythagorick Tetractys, and as in all those cases where the
Feasts of seven days continuance among the Jews have sometimes eight days
allotted to them, as has been already taken notice of, that is, by including
the Terminus a quo, that is, the (...), or preparation to the Feast into the
number.

Lastly, This was the reason of Circumcision upon the eighth day, which is the
space from Sabbath to Sabbath, including both the terms, and by admission of
the Males into the Jewish Church and Covenant upon that day, he was
symbolically shadowed out, to whose service they were dedicated by that Rite,
and into Covenant with whom they were admitted, which held not only in men, but
in some sort was observed even in brute animals themselves, which could not be
accepted until the eighth day, that is, till they were full seven days old.
Exodus 22. 30. Seven days it shall be with his dam, and on the eighth day thou
shall give it me. Levit. 22. 27. When a Bullock, or a Sheep, or a Goat is
brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth
day and thenceforth, it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the
Lord. And Grotius observes out of Pliny, l. 8. c. 51. Pecoris foetum sacrificio
purum esse die septimo, that Sheep and Lambs are fit for sacrifice on the
seventh or eighth day, and not till then; for that is plainly the sense of
Pliny, whose words are these, Suis foetus sacrificio die quinto purus est,
pecoris die octavo, which confirms what I have said, that seven and eight in
these instances are all one, the latter being only by inclusion of the two
terms, or by the return of the Septenary or Sabbatical period into it self.

The same Grotius upon Genesis 17. 12. in which place the first institution of
Circumcision is contained, uses a passage out of Aristotle in his 7th de
animalibus, wherein he imagines the reason of Circumcision upon the seventh or
eighth day may be found; where speaking of infants, he says, (...); that is,
Children dye frequently before they be seven days old: Which is the reason why
at that age they usually give them their names, having then some hopes, when
seven days are past, that they may continue to live and do well. And he also
produces the opinion of Maimonides, why Circumcision was not performed till the
eighth day, Quia ante eum diem infirmior infans quam ut par sit dolori; Because
before the eighth day the child was usually so weak, that this operation could
not be performed without danger of life, or too great extremity of pain. But
now that this reason of Maimonides is no reason at all, is plain from this,
That the Circumcision was never anticipated, though the child should prove
never so vigorous and strong, as it is plain there is great difference in the
strength and vigor of children from the very birth, as well as afterward,
when they come to greater age; neither was it ever deferred any longer, though
at the age of eight days the child should prove never so weakly and unlikely to
live. This therefore instead of being a solid reason, is but a Maimonidism or a
Rabbinical dream.

The same may also be said of Aristotle's reason, why children had their Names
given them upon the seventh day among the Greeks, which term, if it were not by
custom either anticipated or prorogued according to the differing degrees of
health, which is the general account why the seventh day above others was
pitched upon; then this was either no reason at all, or which is still worse,
so very bad a reason, as does sufficiently betray and expose it self.

It is therefore more likely that Aristotle was mistaken in his account, and
that the true Original of this custom was from the Jews, who were used upon the
eighth day to perform the Ceremony of Circumcision; at which time also the Name
was probably given to the child. And I think it may be pretty plain from all
this, that the reason of Circumcision upon the eighth day, and of not offering
up any animal in sacrifice till then, was the same in both cases, and had a
mystical allusion to the septenary number, or to the return of the Sabbatical
period into it self, as an act of homage or obedience to him, who rested the
seventh day, when he had finished the wonders of his Power, Goodness and Wisdom
upon the other six.

From this custom of symbolical swearing by the number seven, or with the
Pythagoreans by the number four; or perhaps from both of these causes it came
to pass, that (...) in Greek, which signifies properly to count or number, is
also found to have the signification of swearing, as appears by comparing two
of the Greek Scholiasts, the one the old Interpreter of Homer, and the other of
Apollonius, the Writer of the Argonautiques, together; that upon Homer is Il.
(...). 264. (...).
Upon which the Scholiast says thus: (...); that is, Ceneus was the Son of
Elatus, and King of the Lapithoe, once a beautiful Virgin; but being deflowred
by Neptune, she requested of him, that she might be turned into a man; which
request of hers was not only granted, but she became invulnerable into the
bargain, and was the most redoubted Hero of that time; insomuch that on a
certain time fixing his Spear in a place where the Gods were to pass by, he
would oblige them all to number, that is, to swear by his Spear; at which
Jupiter was so angry, as well he might, that he resolved to be revenged, and
immediately set the Centaures upon him; who though they could not pierce him,
being invulnerable, yet made a hard shift to ram him down by the weight of
massy Oaks and Ashes into the earth, of which Apollonius in his Argonautiques
thus speaks; and then follows over again the very same Story, as it is told by
Apollonius, where the Scholiast relating the same Fable, though not so
particularly as the Interpreter of Homer does, what the first calls (...), to
number, he expressly renders by (...), to swear, (...), he compelled all that
came by to swear by his Spear. And then afterward adds as the reason why
Jupiter was so severe upon him, (...). This calamity befell him, because he
would neither sacrifice nor pray to the Gods, but only to his own Spear.

Neither does it necessarily follow, because the Pythagoreans were used to
swear by the Tetractys, which implies indeed that there was something of
Divinity in it, that therefore the Tetragrammaton was pointed at, or that any
respect was had in it to the four letters, of which the Name of God, either in
Greek or Hebrew was composed, but only to that root of number and proportion
which I have mentioned, in which the seeds and principles of all natural
Productions were contained, (...), the source and fountain of everlasting
nature, which word nature is it self only one way of expressing the
fruitfulness and plenty of the divine Being, in which as in their proper
Fountain and Original, all the possibilities of things are in a powerful and
hidden manner contained, and from which their actualities proceed, so that God
and nature are indeed but two words for one and the same thing. Hanc Deus and
melior litem natura diremit, said Ovid.
And Seneca, Vis illum fatum vocare? non errabis: Hic est ex quo suspensa sunt
omnia, causa causarum. Vis illum ^rovidentiam dicere? Recte dices: Est enim
cujus consilio ^^ic mundo providetur, ut inconcussus eat, and actus suos
^xplicet. Vis illum naturam vocare? non peccabis: Est enim ^x quo nata sunt
omnia, cujus spiritu vivimus; and other ^assages of a like import. And as
natura, according to Seneca, is ex qua nata sunt omnia, so is (...). And this
was that which by the ancient Heathen World, was worshipped and ^dored by the
name of Pan. Neither would they have ^een any more blameworthy, that they were
used to ^^ear by their Master Pythagoras himself, if it had been ^rue what he
pretended, and they too rashly believed, that ^e was indeed an immortal,
self-existent and divine Person; For upon this supposition they went, whenever
^hey made their appeal to him in swearing; and indeed (...) is ridiculous to
swear by any thing, whose Omniscience cannot qualify him for a witness to the
imprecation, and those Omnipotence cannot punish the falsehood, of a de^eitfull
Oath in the opinion of him that makes it. Ecce negas jurasque mihi per templa
Tonantis,
Non credo, Jura, Verpe, per Anchialum.
And the belief of his Divinity was occasioned partly ^y the mystical and
extraordinary nature of his Doctrine, and partly by those strange Stories which
he told of himself, or procured to be told by his Abettors, and which were no
sooner told than believed by his followers and others; as of his persuading a
Bear to abstain from the flesh of Animals, as himself and his Disciples did;
his whispering to an Ox, and by that means prevailing with him to abstain from
Beans; his calling an Eagle down from Heaven in the greatest height and
swiftness of its flight; and after having stroak't and made much of it, letting
it go again; his being saluted by Caucasus, and as others say by the River
Nessus, when he swam over it with his Golden Thigh, with a (...), which was
looked upon as a kind of testimony of nature to the Divinity of his person; his
telling some Fishermen as they were dragging their Net, before it came to
shore, how many Fishes they should catch, and by a miraculous power preserving
them alive when they were out of their own Element; his pretending to have
lived in ages long ago past, to remember perfectly the Trojan War, and all the
bodies he had past through from that time, till he came to set up for the
Founder of the Italique Sect, and went by the name of Pythagoras in Italy; his
telling before Ships came to shore what Freight they were charged with; his
foretelling of Earthquakes, averting of Plagues, and stilling of Winds and
Tempests; his being able at any time either to raise or allay the passions of
men to any pitch or degree; his being seen on the same day to persons at an
incredible distance from one another: All which, though they speak him no other
than a very great Impostor, yet being believed, as impossible as some of them
might seem, and as ridiculous as others, it could not be otherwise but that
they must needs create in his followers an opinion of his Divinity.

Neither was Pythagoras himself the only pretender, to such extraordinary
seats, but his disciples also, Empedocles, Epimenides and Abaris did the same;
and of the first of them it is certain, and may very well be presumed of the
rest, that he had a very strong ambition to be thought a God, otherwise he
would not have thought it worth his while to leap into Aetna to purchase the
honor of being so esteemed. Flaccus, -- Deus immortalis haberi Dum cupit
Empedocles, ardentem frigidus Aetnam Insiluit --

But as very ill luck would have it, he left his shoe behind him, and that
betrayed his mortality and folly to the world; and what Porphyrie, out of whom
I have excerped these particulars, relates of these Gentlemen whom I have last
mentioned; the same, or things equally incredible, are related by Philostratus,
concerning Apollonius Tyaneus, who was himself of the Pythagorean School, and
had the fortune, I cannot call it good fortune, of compassing that design which
his Predecessor Empedocles had missed; that is, of being thought a God, and
worshipped under that notion in the Lararium of one of the Roman Emperors.

But because I have made mention of Pythagoras his Golden Thigh, of which so
many Authors have spoken; among which are Lucian, Laertius, Aelian, Porphyrie
or Malchus, and others, which yet is in its literal sense so ridiculous and so
impossible a figment, I will here explain what was meant by it in the
Symbolical Doctrine of Pythagoras. It is to be noted therefore, that in the
language of the Eastern World, where Pythagoras had conversed very much, and
from whence he received a great part of his Philosophy; the Thigh was looked
upon as an Emblem of fruitfulness and generation, and Jerek in Hebrew sometimes
signified as much as (...), which though it cannot be unknown to learned men;
yet because Daniel Heinsius in his Aristarchus, has been pretty accurate in
this observation, therefore I will set down his words as I find them, p. 13.
Qui orientem salutarunt, sciunt vocem Jerek, hoc est, femur, pro pudenda part
viri pariter and mulieris poni; ac de viri quidem, ut cum aliquoties, nam
infiniti prope loci sunt, posteritas Jacobi Femur ejus dicitur egressa, Genesis
46. 26. Exodus 1. 5. ubi modo (...), modo (...), Hellenistae rediderunt: pro
mulieris autem, ut cum ea pars jam ad conceptum minus apta, (...) ab iis
dicitur, Number. 5. 21 -- Et quis nescit locum illum, (...). and tale aliquid
Procopius acceperat, cum notavit, (...) -- De Gideone cui plurimi fuisse filii
dicuntur, (...), dicunt Hellenistae; and Sibylla, cujus fragmentum Theophilus
ad Autolycum commemorat, (...)
(...)
Which words, for the sake of those that are learned, it is needless to
translate; and for others, (...), it is better they should remain, as they are,
untranslated, that in this at least I may not seem to wander from my Text,
(...).

From hence it was that Bacchus in the Heathen Mythology was said to be taken
out of the Womb of Semele, and sowed up in Jupiter's Thigh, from whence he was
called by the Greeks (...), which Ovid renders insutus femori. Metam. L. 3.

Imperfectus adhuc infans genitricis ab alvo
Eripitur, patrioque tener, si credere dignum,
Insuitur femori; maternaque tempora complet.
That is, in plain English, no more than that Bacchus was Jupiter's Son, which
may also be the meaning of the Greek (...), if after the usual trifling of the
Greek Grammarians, instead of (...), you read it (...), which seems to have
been the Original word from Jerek, Femur, and Jo or (...) the name of God.

This was also the reason why anciently in swearing, the person making Oath,
was used to lay his hand under the Thigh of him by whom he was adjured, Genesis
24. 1, 2, 3, 4. And Abraham was old, and well stricken in years, and the Lord
had blessed Abraham in all things; and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of
his house that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my
thigh, and I will make thee swear, by the Lord, the God of Heaven, and the God
of the Earth, that thou shall not take a wife unto my son, of the daughters of
the Canaanites among whom I dwell: but thou shall go unto my country, and to
my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. And again, Genesis 47. 29, 30, 31.
And the time drew nigh, that Israel must dye, and he called his son Joseph, and
said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy
hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray
thee, in Egypt, but I will lie with my Fathers, and thou shall carry me out of
Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place: And he said, I will do as thou
have said; and he said, Swear unto me, and he swore unto him, and Israel bowed
himself upon the beds head. Sebastian Munster upon the first of these places
says thus, Jurabant veteres illi manu sub femore atque genitali part posita,
quod inde posteritas esset futura, atque ideo veluti res sacra haberetur; vel
ut R. Salomo sentit, quod illic esset signum Faederis nempe circumcisio, vel
quod hoc indicio dabatur intelligi potestas superioris, and promptus inferioris
obsequendi animus, ut Aben Ezra autumat, dicitque hunc morem adhuc observari in
terra Indiae: That is, 'The Ancients in the East were wont to swear, by putting
their hand under the thigh or genital part of the person by whom they were
adjured, because that was, as it were, the Fountain from whence posterity was
to spring, and was upon that account esteemed sacred; or as R. Solomon thinks,
it was because in that part the Seal of the Covenant, that is, of Circumcision
was made; or it was to denote the Power of the superior, and the cheerful
obedience of those that were subject to him, as Aben Ezra is of opinion, who
says likewise, that in India the same custom still obtains; the words of Aben
Ezra himself, are produced by P. Fagius upon the same place, who afterward
adds of his own, Quidam ex nostris hoc modo jurandi adumbratum ferunt Christum,
qui ex Abrahamo oriturus erat. 'There are some among the Christian Expositors,
who believe Christ, who was to be descended of the loins of Abraham, to have
been typify'd and shadowed out by this rite. Grotius, Quasi dicerent, si
fallam, ense tuo peream, nam ad femur locus ensis, Jud. 3. 16, 21. Psalm. 45. 3.
'As much as to say, if I swear falsely, or if I break my Oath, may I perish by
your Sword, for the Sword was used to be girt about the thigh.

But as for Munster's three reasons, for so many there are; the first of them
is trifling, because it is not a cause sacred and great enough to be the
foundation of an Oath, (which is an act of divine Worship), or of any solemn
Ceremony belonging to it.

The second of R. Salomon's is like the reason of a Rabbin, that is, no reason
at all, for it was not under the pudenda, (Quod verecundiae ratio non patitur,
ut factum credamus), but it was under the thigh it self, properly so called,
that the hand was used to be laid, as shall be proved by and by. Neither is
Aben Ezra's reason, which is the third, any less Rabbinical, that is, false,
ridiculous and absurd, than the other; for how the thigh was an Emblem of
superiority, or the putting the hand under it a symbol or token of subjection,
I do not understand; and Aben Ezra does not so much as pretend to prove, or so
much as assert, which yet if he had, the affirmation of a Rabbin will signify
but little, that ever these things were actually made use of in such a
symbolical way.

As for P. Fagius his account, in which also Clarius his Transcriber, as how
should it be otherwise? agrees with him, that it was a Typical adumbration of
Christ, who was to be descended of the loins of Abraham; it is to be observed,
that this is at best but precarious, and is likewise opposed by very strong
Reasons into the bargain: For, first, we find this rite again repeated c. 47.
in the person of Jacob, for which though the same account may again be given;
for Jacob also was a Progenitor of the Messiah, who was more immediately
descended from him, than from Abraham himself; yet the repetition of this rite
speaks it rather to be a custom of those times, not founded upon any such
particular reasons, as belonged only to Abraham and his family, but obtaining
generally at those times and places; besides that when Aben Ezra tells us,
Vezeh hamishphat hadajan bou beerets Hodo, 'That this in his time was still a
custom in the land of India: It is very strange, that a rite which in its first
institution, was so peculiar to the family of Abraham, and had a particular
respect to the coming of the Messiah, who was to arise from thence, should yet
obtain so generally all over the Eastern Countries; for that, I suppose, is to
be understood by Erets Hodo in the language of the Rabbin; or if Aben Ezra's
Authority, shall be thought as little by any, in matter of Fact, as I have
represented it in matter of Opinion, where Speculation and Judgment are
concerned, (talents very rarely to be met with in that sort of men), to
strengthen the Testimony of Aben Ezra, let us call in that of Augerius a
Busbeck, a man of unquestionable credit and reputation; who in the fourth of
those excellent Epistles, wherein he gives an account of his Embassy from the
Emperor to the Grand Seigniour, and of what he observed, or heard, or what
Occurrences fell out during that time, and speaking in this particularly of a
Turkeish Hoggia, of whom he there tells a pleasant story, taking leave of a
Bassa, by whom he had been, together with many others, plentifully entertained,
he says, Nam remitteret paulisper, valedicturus hospiti, necesse erat, quod
eorum ita ferat consuetudo, ut manibus ad pectora vel ad femora applicatis suos
optimates salutet. 'Being about to take leave of his Host, it was now high time
for him to shut up his pouch, which he had been busy in filling with good
provender to carry home; and the rather because he would have need to make
other use of his hands, this being their perpetual custom among the Turks; that
being to take leave of their Superiors, as a token of respect, they always lay
their hand upon their breast or thigh; and so having made their obeisance, take
their leave.

From which Citation of Busbequius, in concurrence with the testimony of Aben
Ezra, there are several things very well worth observation: As first, that this
was and is a general token of respect in the Eastern Countries.

Secondly, The outward expressions by gesture, of civil respect, and of divine
worship, being generally the same in all Ages and Nations, as shall be proved
more largely in its due place; the difference between these two, consisting
only in the difference of the object, and the different application or
direction of the mind in the one and the other; and it having been shown
already out of the unquestionable Records of Moses himself, that some such
ceremony as this was used in Divine Worship, of which every Oath is a part (it
being an acknowledgment of the divine Omniscience, and of his Justice and
Power, it including an Appeal to the former as a witness, and a Prayer to the
two latter, so to exercise and dispose themselves either for our benefit or
hurt, as we assert truly, or perform faithfully, what we affirm, deny or
promise); it is manifest that this Modern custom of the Eastern Countries, is
the best explanation of that ancient usage, of which we have given instances in
the Story of Abraham and Jacob; and that therefore R. Salomon's interpretation
must needs be false, it being clear that in this Citation of Busbequius the
word Femur is to be understood in its most proper, strict and natural
acceptance.

Thirdly, By comparing this testimony of Busbequius, with the two places of
Genesis, which we have mentioned, it appears how much Josephus was mistaken,
who in his Antiquities, L. 1. c. 16. gives this account of that Story of
Abraham, which is to be found in the first of those places, (...); that is, he
(Abraham) sends or dispatches his eldest servant to make up the contract
betwixt Isaac and Rebekkah, obliging him by the most sacred ties imaginable,
punctually to observe his instructions; now the manner of imposing such solemn
and sacred ties, is this; The party obliging, and the party obliged, do both of
them mutually put their hands under their thighs, and shaking hands after that
manner with one another, they invoke God as a witness of what passes between
them, or of what the one requires to be done, and the other promises to do;
than which there can be nothing more contrary either to the express words of
Scripture, or of Busbequius; by the first of which the ancient usage is
expressed, and by the second the continuance of it in these latter times; but
on the contrary it is as plainly asserted, as it is possible for words to
express it; that all that was done was, that the party adjured was used to put
his hand upon, or under the thigh of him, by whom the adjuration was made; and
if you consider that in the instances of Abraham and Jacob, they were both of
them bed-ridden and lying along, while Eliezer in the first example, and Joseph
in the second stood by the bed side; such a way of shaking of hands, as Joseph
in the second stood by the bed side; such a way of shaking of hands, as
Josephus describes, though it be not impossible, must needs be extremely
difficult and painful to the party standing by the bed side, as will be easy
to imagine, to any that shall but fancy in their minds the posture in which the
adjured person must be, with respect to him who lay along in his bed. Wherefore
we must attribute this misrepresentation of the matter, either to the ignorance
of Josephus, or to an affectation which he had of dressing up the Hebrew
customs in the Garb of the Greek and Roman, among whom joining of hands was
always used, as a way of plighting of Faith, that so he might the better
accommodate his History, to the approbation and good acceptance of those for
whom it was intended; but let it be either way, it argues either want of
honesty or skill, either of which are sufficient to weaken his authority and
credit to that degree, that his high pretenses to integrity and skill, as if he
scorned to deceive, and could not be imposed upon, being so very skillful, that
at a very tender age the Priests themselves were used to consult him in
difficult and doubtful cases (which they that please may believe) are so far
from supporting his tottering reputation, that compared with such failures,
either out of ignorance or design of these, they do but still speak him more
plainly either an unwary or unlearned Writer; and indeed how is it reasonable
to expect much of sincerity from him, where he may either serve the interest of
his Nation, or the credit of his own Eloquence and Parts, with which he must be
acknowledged to have been very plentifully furnished, by putting false colors
and artificial lights and shades upon his Story, when he gives so excellent,
nay, so divine a Character of our Savior himself; for he questions whether he
were a mortal man or no, and was in that respect under greater convictions than
any of the Socinians of our days can be, and yet was not persuaded to become
one of his followers and disciples; not that I would be so understood, as if I
would utterly destroy the authority of his Writings; but I say there is care
and judgment to be use in distinguishing his truth from his mistakes, or his
impostures.

And first in the general we may and ought to believe, that his main intention
was to write truth, because there was no reason why he should do otherwise,
and because to do otherwise too palpably and too often would have exposed him
to the just indignation and hatred of his own Nation, and he would have been
confuted and exposed into the bargain. And lastly, because he that out of
vanity, affectation or design would effectually deceive sometimes, must be sure
for the most part to be a religious observer of truth, that so under the
protection of his integrity, his falsehood may pass with the less examination.

Secondly, The far greatest part of his Story is attested by the concurrence of
the sacred Writings together with it. Lastly, As there are some falsities so
palpable, that they expose and betray their own shame and nakedness to the
world; so also there are other relations that carry such signatures of
probability in themselves, as are a tolerable testimony to their own reality
and truth; so that it is plain by all this, I do not so much design to expose
the credit of this Writer, as to establish what is credible in him upon a more
certain foundation.

The last opinion which is to be considered, is that of H. Grotius, Quasi
dicerent, ^i fallam, ense tuo peream; that is to say, that this rite of laying
the hand of the adjured person upon the thigh of him, by whom the adjuration
was made, was as much as to say, If I deceive you, or if I break that Oath
which I am now making, may I perish by your Sword, that being the place where
the sword is used to be girt: But really, to speak the most favorably of this
interpretation, it is a conceit by no means suitable to the name of him that
made it, (...). For certainly it would rather look like a jeer or scoff, more
like a sarcastical insultation over the infirmity of a bed-ridden and dying
man, than like a solemn and serious appeal to the Omniscience and Justice of
God, to say, May I perish by your Sword, when he had no strength to wield a
Sword; and by reason of old age, an incurable disease, was never like to wield
it any more; or would not the symbolical meaning at this rate be rather, as
much as to say, I never intend to keep my word, because I imprecate only such
curses upon my self in case I break it, from whence I have no reason to
apprehend any danger?

Having therefore seen how unsatisfactory all these solutions are, that which I
propose instead of them, is this; That it having been proved that the thigh in
the Symbolical or Hieroglyphique language signified fertility and generation;
the meaning of that expression of Abraham and Jacob, Put, I pray thee, thy hand
under my thigh, is as much as to say, I adjure you by the Father and Make^ of
all things: (...) (...), or (...), and that this is truly and plainly the
meaning of it, appears sufficiently from the first of these places it self,
Genesis 24. 2, 3. Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and I will make thee
swear by the Lord, the God of Heaven, and the God of the Earth. And so in that
passage of Busbequius, when the Turks in their customary salutation of their
superiors apply their hand, either to their breast or thigh; by the first of
these there is symbolically denoted, an appeal to him who is the searcher of
hearts, that they do heartily wish and pray for the health and safety of him to
whom this salutation is made; and in the latter there is included a Prayer to
the Father and Maker of all things, that he would continue to prosper and
preserve him.

Neither is it at all material in this affair, that whereas the present custom
in Turkey is to lay the hand upon the thigh, the Hebrew word in these places of
Genesis is Tachath, which the 70 render by (...), and our translation by,
under, for Tachath in Hebrew is of a much larger signification than so, and may
signify in general, in loco femoris, that is, either subter or super; and
therefore it is most rational to expound it from the Modern custom, which is,
no question, a remainder of antiquity, and to understand the (...) of the
seventy, rather in an Hellenistical sense, as being co-extended to the
signification of Tachath in Hebrew, than in its proper and genuine acceptance.

But to make it the more clearly out, before I apply it to the instance of
Pythagoras, that this was indeed a symbol of generation, and that the use of
this rite in solemn adjuration did include an appeal to the Maker and Parent of
the World. I will add some other testimonies both out of the sacred and
profane Writings, Genesis 30. 3. And she (Rachel) said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go
in unto her, and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by
her: And c. 50. 23. And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation:
the children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's
knees. In both which places by Bilha's bearing upon the knees of Rachel, and by
the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh being brought up upon the knees of
Joseph, nothing else is meant, but that the offspring of Machir and of Bilhah,
were accounted as descended of Joseph and Rachel, while they were yet living;
the one virtually, in as much as Manasseh, the Father of Machir was the son of
Joseph, the other by a sort of adoption peculiar to the Eastern Countries and
to the earliest times, whereby the children of the handmaid, begotten by
consent of the Mistress, by her Lord and husband, were accounted as if they had
been born of her self, as appears by those words already cited, She bear upon
my knees, that I may also have children by her: And the same thing appears
likewise from v. 6, 8, 11, 13. of the same chapter: And in the case of Hagar
the handmaid of Sarah, Genesis 16. 2.

By what means the Mistress was invested with this propriety in the offspring
of her handmaid, I have declared in my Papers of the Leviratical Law, which was
an usage every whit as ancient as this, and built exactly upon the same
foundation: but all that I now take notice of, is the symbolical way of
expressing this imputative generation, by bearing, or being brought up upon the
knees of the person to whom the propriety belonged.

This was likewise the reason that in the ancient way of the most humble
supplication, the person supplicating was used to take hold of the knees of him
or her to whom the supplication was made, which included in it a symbolical
intimation of a prayer or adjuration by the Maker of Heaven and Earth, that the
request might be granted; this Homer calls, (...) and (...), and the Latin
Writers, amplecti, prensare genua, genibus advolvi, genibus manus admovere, and
other expressions of a like import; but Seneca in Troade has expressed it a
little otherwise, where Andromache thus speaks to Ulysses in behalf of her son
Astyanax, -- Ad genua accido Supplex, Vlysse, quamque nullius pedes Novere
dextram pedibus admoveo tuis.

Where what he calls genua in the beginning of these words, he afterward calls
pedes, because in this affair pes, and femur, and genu, are of the same import.
So Genesis 49. 10. The Scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from
between his feet, until Shilo come, where the 70 have it, (...), as has been
already observed.

Lasty, This was the ancient meaning of bowing the knee, whether in divine
worship or civil respect; in the first of which it was a symbolical
acknowledgment of the Prolifique and Demiourgique nature of God; in the second
it includes a Prayer to the Maker and Conserver of all things, for the health
and prosperity of the person to whom the salutation is made; and if to this I
may add, what though it be most obvious in it self, yet it did not till just
now come into my mind, that (...) and genu have their very names from
generation; from all this I will conclude, that the Golden Thigh of Pythagoras,
being in the literal acceptance, a most ridiculous and absurd figment, was in
the symbolical, an assertion of his Divinity; the fruitfulness of the divine
nature being signified in general by the word (...) or thigh, and by its being
made of Gold, the perpetuity and stability of that fruitfulness was denoted: So
that it is not much to be wondered, when he made such large and lavish pretenses
to a divine and self-existent nature, if by his disciples, who were used to
submit to him in all things with an implicit Faith and Obedience, he were
worshipped under the Name and Character of Apollo Hyperboreus; or if the
Metapontini and the Tauromenii built Temples and Altars to his reputed, though
mistaken, Godhead, after his decease.

From whence he received this symbolical way of expressing that Divinity to
others, which he arrogated to himself, is, I think, by this time, sufficiently
plain; and though I may pretend to have proved, that it is but a vain conceit
of some very learned persons that Pythagoras borrowed his Tetractys from the
Tetragrammaton of the Jews, or rather Greeks, or Hellenists, who lived long
after Pythagoras his time; yet I am far from denying that he had any knowledge
of the Jewish affairs; his symbolical way of Phylosophising in the general, and
this particular instance of his Golden Thigh, are sufficient testimonies of his
having no inconsiderable acquaintance in the East; and Porphyrie tells us
expressly out of Diogenes in his Book, (...), of the wonders or incredible
rarities of the Thule; (...), that he traveled among the Egyptians, Arabs,
Chaldees and Hebrews; which is likewise asserted by Clem. Alexandrinus,
Eusebius and St. Ambrose, and not only so, but if we will believe St. Ambrose,
it was the received opinion of a great many that he was descended of the Jewish
Nation. And what is still a farther confirmation, how little a stranger
Pythagoras was to the Nation, Manners and Religion of the Jews; the same
Porphyrie tells us, (...) (...). In Badylon he conversed, as with other of the
Chaldeans, so with Zabratus himself, by whom he was purified from the
pollutions of his former life, and was taught what abstinence was required of
all that will be virtuous men; he was instructed likewise by the same person in
the knowledge of nature, and of the principles or causes from whence this
Universe is made, or by which it is preserved.

This Zabratus, by Clemens of Alexandria, is called Nazaratus, by Cyrill
against Julian, Zaran, by Plutarch, Zaratas, and by Theodoret Zaradas, but for
the Nazaratus of Clemens, L. Holstenius conceives, that the first syllable is
only the last of the preceding word carelessly repeated by the Transcriber,
which is a very good conjecture, and like so expert a Critique as Holstenius
was; or it might be that the same carelessness might repeat the first syllable
twice, as it often happens that by negligence, the same syllable, word, and
sometimes an entire clause or sentence is twice repeated; by which means it
would be Zazaratus, which looking like an uncouth name, and considering the
likeness of Z and N in the larger character, the one being but the transverse
of the other; and considering, lastly, that there was such a place in the world
as Nazareth; all this running in his mind, who first bestowed that reading upon
us which the present copies embrace, he changed the Zaratus of Clemens, which
was improved into Zazaratus by the Transcriber, into Nazaratus, which he looked
upon to be as much as (...). The Zaran in Cyrill, who is beholding to Clemens,
is partly owing to an abbreviation very frequent in all ancient MSS. by which
unskilful Transcribers are deceived; and partly to this, that N and (...) have
so great a likeness and resemblance to one another, which was the reason that
in some of the Copies of Tertullian, the God of the Basilidians, instead of
Abraxas, is called Abraxan, which though at first it confirmed me in my
conceit, that Abraxas was a composition of (...) and (...), because he is
likewise called (...), as has been seen already; yet that conjecture, for the
reason above mentioned, falling to the ground, it is manifest that this is a
corrupt and putid reading, because the whole mystery of that name consisting in
the numeral potestas of those letters of which it is composed, if you put an N
instead of (...), it will fall very short of that number in which the whole
mystery consists.

For the Zaratas of Plutarch, and the Zaradas of Theodoret, they are both the
same with one another, and with Zabratus in Porphyrie, or Malchus; for (...)
and (...) are (...), letters very nigh of kin in their sound; from whence it
comes to pass, that both in the use of common speech, and by the mistake of
Writers, whose ears are not always so accurate as to distinguish, they are very
often changed into one another; but the reading by a (...) is indeed the true,
as shall be seen by and by, and the (...) was omitted by Plutarch and
Theodoret, (...), to mollify the word into the softness and Elegance of the
Greek pronunciation.

So then all this diversity of reading, being so naturally and so fairly
reducible to the Zabratus of Porphyrie, the remaining question is, who this
Zabratus should be, which is the thing I am now about to explain. Zabratus
therefore is Jah Berith, the God of the Covenant, as the salt of the Sacrifice
is called the salt of the Covenant; and God frequently calls himself in
Scripture, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob; that is, he who had
entered into Covenant with them and their posterity, and circumcision was the
peculiar seal of that Covenant betwixt God and them; neither is it any matter
in this case that Porphyrie calls this Zabratus, a Babylonian, because the time
of Pythagoras falls, as I have said, toward the conclusion of the Babylonish
captivity, and so the names of a Jew and a Babylonian might well enough at that
time be confounded together, because of their being mingled and interspersed
among one another. Zabratus therefore, notwithstanding he calls him a
Babylonian, may be understood of the God of the Jews, and his converse with
him, may be meant of that part of his Philosophy or Discipline which he learned
out of the Mosaique Law, either by a perusal of the Law it self, which I scarce
believe, for want of acquaintance with the language, which was then in a manner
lost among the Jews themselves, or by converse with the Jews; who though they
had not now any accurate knowledge of the Law, yet were able to give him some
traditionary and imperfect account: And this I the rather believe, because all
the three things which Pythagoras is said to have received from Zabratus, are
largely insisted upon in the Books of Moses, that is to say, the Origin of all
things, in the first Chapter of Genesis, the distinction of foods or abstinence
from unclean things, in the History of the Flood, and afterward in the Body of
the Law it self; and, lastly, the rites and ceremonies of lustration, which are
no where more nicely adjusted than in the Levitical Law.

And if in these particulars he be not in every thing conformable to the
platform of Moses, yet this is no argument that he had no knowledge of that
Law, or of the Religion and Manners of the Jews, but only that it was
Traditionary, confused and obscure; besides that, there are two other causes
which might and did probably conspire to make a variation as to particular
instances, though the Genius and Spirit of the Pythagorean Philosophy, were
much the same with that of the Mosaique Law.

First out of a particular affectation to be the founder of a Sect, and to be
thought, as well by himself, as others, to have been the inventor of a new
Doctrine, and the introducer of a new Philosophical institution into the World.

Secondly, He did not only converse with the Jews, but with all other Eastern
Nations, and so his Philosophy was probably little more than a Medley of the
Hieroglyphique and Symbolique Mysteries of diverse nations (as all the
Philosophy and Religion of the East was wrapped up in Symbols) jumbled into a
Philosophical Oglio together. It was much such another thing in Philosophy, as
the Phoenician History of Sanchuniathon was for an account of time, where there
are many very plain and undoubted strictures of true and genuine antiquity:
jumbled together without any regard either to truth or shame, (though I do not
say the composition of Pythagoras was equally frivolous and indiscreet) with
the Heathen Mythology of all the barbarous Nations and fabulous times.

But after all, though the converse of Pythagoras in Babylon, be at the same
time an argument of his acquaintance with the Jews; yet it may well enough be,
that that knowledge, which he is said to have received from Zabratus, may be
only a Transcript out of the sacred Volumes in the Temple of an Idol, such as
that which by the Midianites and Amalekites in the book of Judges, was called
Bahal Berith; for as Bahal, though it be for the most part applied to the
signification of an Idol, may yet notwithstanding in its genuine and first
acceptance denote and signify the true God; so may Jah also, which is the
proper and incommunicable name of the true God, who is only self-existent, and
is what he is from himself, be applied not improperly, by the Heathens
themselves to the most contemptible and silly Idol in the world; because let it
be what it will in it self, it is looked upon by them that worship it, under
the notion of a true and proper Deity, and that it was actually applied to the
Idols of the Heathen, I shall immediately make appear; and and if I do, it will
then, I hope, be granted, for another reason besides what has been already
urged, that this incommunicable name of God, which is every whit as sacred as
the Tetragrammaton (and consequently that also), was not so great a secret
among the neighbor Nations, as the superstition of the later Jews would make
it.

So then Zabratus, though it may most properly and fitly be understood of the
true God, yet nothing hinders, but a false one may also be signified by it; and
at that rate it will be the same with Baal Berith, whom Philo Byblius, the
Translator of Sanchuniathon calls (...), the King of Berith, or of the
Berytians, and whom he confounds very unskilfully with Abibalus, which was the
name of the true God, and was, I make little or no question, the same with
(...); the words of Philo in Eusebius are these: (...), etc. In which words,
when I consider what a strange Miscellany that History of Sanchuniathon was,
and as it seems a designed imposition upon the credulity of after-ages; I
cannot but believe, that this Abibalus, whose name does so exactly hit to the
pat and proper signification of the true God, was one of those names by which
he was used to be called. For what is Abibalus, but El Abib, that is, Deus
spicarum, as he was called from changing the beginning of the Jewish year, to
the month of Abib from Tisri, of which so much has been already spoken? And
that which confirms me very much in this conjecture, is one of these four
things which follow, and much more all of them together.

First Eusebius says, (...), which if you understand of a dedication, such as
has been usual to great persons in the more civilized and learned times, I
doubt it will be hard to find any instance of such a dedication at a time, when
letters themselves were scarce known in the world, and without being able to
produce an instance, it is very absurd and ridiculous to suppose it; you may
suppose any thing else, though never so extravagant, with equal reason. But if
you will understand it so, as that the Monuments of Sanchuniathon were laid up
in the Temple of Abibalus, which is the most proper sense of (...) and (...) in
Greek, then, let the thing it self be true or false, here is a kind of a
confused and obscure acknowledgment that Abibalus was the name of a God; which
since he cannot be the same with the (...), whether you understand by those
words the King of the Berytians, who was a mortal man, or the Idol of Baal
Berith, to which the Etymon of Abibalus, will not so well suit as to the true
God, here is one, though a faint and obscure indication, that Abibalus was the
name of the true God.

Secondly, We meet with other compositions exactly of the same form and analogy
with this, in the Monuments of the Eastern Antiquity; For as the God of the
Hebrews, for the reason above mentioned, was by the Phoenicians, or by the men
of Berith called Abibalus, so by the Egyptians Neptune was called (...), from
El and Mos, which signifies water; exactly by the same Analogy with the other,
as Tztzes has recorded, which is a new argument against Scaliger in his
Controversy with Philo Judaeus, which is likewise backed by the testimony of
Josephus, who says, that among the Egyptians Mos or Moy has the
signification of water.

Thirdly, It matters not, though this name be no where found in Scripture, for
the Phoenicians called even those things and persons, for whose knowledge they
were indebted either to the Scripture it self, or to a Tradition derived from
it, by names of a very different sound, from those by which they were called in
the books of Moses themselves, though by their signification, as in this
instance of Abibalus, they did sufficiently discover from whence they came. So
Isaac was called (...), that is, Jachid, as being the only son; Sarah,
Annobret, that is, Quae per gratiam concepit, as having conceived and brought
forth in her old age, when it had ceased to be with her after the manner of
women; and the breath of God, which is said to have been breathed into the
nostrils of the first man, is called (...), that is, Kol phi Jah, Sonus, or
Sibilus oris Dei.

Fourthly and lastly, If we consider the distance of the age of Sanchuniathon,
from that of his Translator Philo, who flourished in Adrian's time, it may seem
very probable, that the language out of which he made that Translation was not
so perfectly understood by him, but that he might be guilty of many and great
mistakes; so that if to the unskilfullness or wilful errors of the original,
you add the defects and failures of the Translation, there will but little of
credit remain to that ancient Writer; only thus much is certain, that those
names which still remain in their original sound, are many of them owing, as to
their signification, to the true and genuine antiquities of Moses, and as the
manifest Anachronisms which are to be found in those Phoenician Fables, for
they are no better, are a sufficient confutation to themselves; so on the other
hand what there is remaining agreeable to that account of things, which has
been given by Moses, is an undeniable attestation to the authority of his
Writings, and shows plainly that there have been really such persons and such
transactions in the world, as have been left upon record by him.

But whatever becomes of Abibalus or Zabratus, in the latter of which
especially, I am not without great confidence that I am in the right; it is
certain that in Zamolxis, which was another name for one of Pythagoras his
Masters, who was, if I am not mistaken, the very same with Zabratus, the name
of Jah is very plainly contained, for this Zamolxis is evidently no other than
Jah Moloc, or the King Jah.

For in the first place, as for those among the Greeks, who will needs have
Zamolxis to have been contemporary with Pythagoras, and to have been his
servant, and to have received his Doctrine from him; this opinion is expressly
rejected by Herodotus in Melpomene, in these words, (...). I am of opinion that
this Zamolxis lived many years before the time of Pythagoras. In the next place
Mnaseas in the Etymologist, who is transcribed by Suidas, says, that he was
worshipped by the Getae for Saturn; nay, his words are more express, (...),
that Saturn is worshipped by the Scythians, and is called Zamolxis; so then
Zamolxis is evidently Jah Moloc, for Moloc and Saturn have always been
accounted the same; and from hence it is that humane sacrifices are offered to
Zamolxis in Herodotus, as well as to Moloc by the Ammonites, or to Saturn or
Jupiter Latiaris by any other barbarous and heathen Nations; for he tells us,
that constantly once in five year they were used to send a Messenger to
Zamolxis, with particular instructions to inform him of what every one wanted,
and to desire him to supply their respective wants; and the manner of their
sending of him was this, that they were used to fasten three sharp Stakes upon
the ground, and then to take their Messenger, as they called him, and throw him
upon the points of those Stakes; in which case, if he dyed presently, they took
it then for a good Omen, that their requests were granted; but if he were not
presently dispatched, then they were used to say he was a wicked man, and that
Zamolxis would not receive his Message, and so they sent another and another in
the same manner, till some one was immediately dispatched, and him they
accounted acceptable and well-pleasing to Zamolxis; which is a plain sign that
this Messenger, as Herodotus calls him, was looked upon as an Expiatory
sacrifice, which ought to be clean and pure it self, that it may the better
atone for the sins of others. And that this Zamolxis is really a word of
Hebrew Origination, appears still further from this, that as Herodotus says,
(...) some of the Scythians were used to call him Gebeleizin, which is no other
than Gebel or Geboul, in composition with Zan or Zen, whom the Latins would
call Terminus, or Jupiter Terminalis, and the Greeks (...), as Herodotus
himself afterward renders it, (...). And so the particular tutelar Deity of
the City of Emissa in Phoenicia was called Alagabalus, that is, Eloah Geboul,
the God of the Coast, or President of that City, and the Territory belonging to
it.

But besides this there are several other things, which do very plainly confirm
what I have conjectured, that Jah and Zamolxis are at least so far the same, as
that the first is a part of the composition of the latter.

First, It is certain he was not worshipped by any Image or sensible
representation, to which they always supposed the Spirit or Divinity of the
Numen himself to be present; but they conceived of him, as of an invisible
being, having his peculiar residence in heaven; for which reason the Jews were
used to call God Shamajim, that is, Heaven; and that not only of latter times,
but you may see instances of it in Buxtorf, out of Lex. Talmud. in Shamajim.
the Talmud, as old as Shammai, who lived a good while before our Savior, and
in our Savior's time there are many instances of it; that place of St.
Matthew, where our Savior forbids his disciples to swear by heaven, and that
passage of the prodigal son, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before
thee; and that Quaere of our Savior's to the Priests and Elders, the baptism
of John, whence was it from heaven or of men? are all very plain examples of
this signification; and another instance of it we have likewise in the book of
Daniel, who lived in the time of the Babylonish captivity, c. 4. 26. After that
thou shall have known that the heavens do rule; that is, he who has his more
peculiar or beatifique seat in heaven, though by his divine extension he be
equally present to all other places besides. For this reason it was, that the
Scythians did (...), send a Messenger to him, whom they supposed to have his
residence in heaven; and they that dyed were said (...), to go to Zamolxis,
which is exactly the language of the Scripture it self: So the Author to the
Hebrews, speaking of the Translation of Enoch, immediately subjoyns, He that
comes to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
diligently seek him. Eccles. 12. 7. Then shall the dust return to the earth, as
it was, and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

Secondly, The Scythians believed of this Zamolxis, as the truth was, and as
the Jews believed, and were obliged to believe of the God of their Fathers,
that he was the Lord, and that there was none besides him, none that might
compare with him in Majesty, Perfection or Power, Exodus 20. 3. Thou shall have
no other Gods before me; therefore the Scythians were used to shoot up toward
heaven, as it were in defiance, when ever it thundered or lightened, to show
that whatever opinion any other of the Heathen Nations, might have of those or
any other Phoenomena of nature, whose causes they could not explain; they
themselves notwithstanding had not any other opinion of them, than as of
dependent and created things, that had nothing of Self-existence or Divinity in
their nature, and could not wound or annoy any thing, whether men or houses, or
corn or beasts, but either by chance, or as they were directed by a Superior
power and skill: they are the words of Herodotus, (...); that is, and this part
of the Thracians (that is, the Getae) are used to shoot up toward heaven, when
ever it thunders and lightens, threatening and affronting their supposed
Divinity, as thinking there is no other God but Zamolxis.

This Zamolxis therefore was El heljon, Deus ille altissimus, as the Socinians
are used to speak in another case, in opposition to all inferior and dependent
Beings, and to all Images, or material representations the works of nature or
of art; and it is manifest from this, that these people were not Idolaters
properly so called, but that they worshipped the true God by his name Jah,
though after such a manner, as he had not only not appointed, but expressly
forbidden by commanding the Israelites, that they should not suffer their
children to pass through the fire to Moloch, as the Ammonites were used to do,
and by substituting the lives of Sheep and Oxen to be an expiation for the sins
of men; by both of which there is nothing more plain, than that all humane
sacrifices were forbidden.

Thirdly, These Scythians were zealous assertors of the Doctrine of
Transmigration, which the Greeks call (...), and (...), and (...), that is, the
passing of the same soul through several humane bodies; so as after they were
gone to Zamolxis, that is, dissolved from that body to which they were last
united, they returned again into a new Scene or Stage of humane life, to act
their parts over again in a new suppositum or personality, consisting of the
same soul united to another body.

Fourthly, They did not hold this of all departed souls, but only of those that
were good and virtuous, or at least of such as had lived within some tolerable
compass of sobriety and duty; both of these are expressly asserted by Herodotus,
(...). that is, it was the Doctrine of Zamolxis, that neither he nor his
companions or disciples, nor any that were descended from them, should ever
dye, but that they should return to the earth again, from whence they were
parted, where they should always enjoy all manner of good things.

And in that I have translated (...), (which in strictness of speech is those
that were used to drink together with him) by his companio^s, or rather
disciples; in this I am warranted both by the thing it self, eating and
drinking together being an argument of their being in Covenant with him, and
that they were his servants and his followers, which was the meaning of the
peaceofferings among the Jews, of which the Priests, the People and God himself
had each of them their share. And I am further confirmed by the words of the
Etymologist, and Suidas out of Hellanicus relating the same Story, (...), that
neither he nor those that were with him should ever dye; those that were with
him, that is again, his disciples, (...), as the Greeks would express it, or in
the Hebrew Idiom, they that walked with God.

Now both of these Doctrines, that is to say, of the Transmigration, and that
it belonged only to good men, or at least to such as were comparatively and
tolerably so. Both of these, I say, were the Doctrines of the Pharisees among
the Jews, in both of which, because it is unlikely they would have jumped so
exactly with one another, if one had not received them from the other; this is
another argument that Zamolxis is Jah Moloc, the name of the true God, whom the
Pharisees worshipped. Joseph. Antiq. l. 18. c. 2. speaking of the Pharisees,
says thus: (...). They are of opinion that humane souls are of an immortal
nature, that the souls of the wicked are punished under ground, and that those
of the just are in a state of happiness and reward; and that the first of these
are under a perpetual restraint, but the other do easily return to live over
the wonted period upon earth again. And in the second book de bello Judaico,
the same Author, delivers it as the Doctrine of the Pharisees, (...) That
every soul is immortal, but that only those of the good and virtuous return to
live over in another body.

From which places it is plain that the Doctrine of the Pharisees, and of the
Scythians, the Worshippers of Zamolxis, was the same; only whereas the
Scythians seem to have believed that only the souls of the good were immortal,
Josephus reports it as the Doctrine of the Pharisees, that all souls were so;
yet since the (...) in Herodotus, is certainly the same with the (...) in
Josephus, that is, the return of good men into new bodies; this hinders not,
but that they are both of them for all this exactly agreed.

And that this was the opinion of the Jews, that is, of part of them, for it
could not be the Doctrine of the Sadducees, who believed there was neither
Angel nor Spirit, is evident from several places of the Gospels, Matthew. 16. 13.
Jesus puts this question to his disciples, Whom do men say that I the son of
man am? To which they return this answer, v. 14. Some say that thou art John
the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the Prophets; that is,
they supposed the Person of our Savior, by reason of the Miracles which he
wrought, and the admirable Doctrine which he communicated to the world, to be
the ^^ul of one of these great and holy men united to that body which they saw.
So in the Story of Nicodemus, Joh. 3. 3. Jusus said unto him, Verily, verily, I
say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God. V.
4. Nicodemus says unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter
the second time into his Mothers womb and be born? And v. 9. Nicodemus answered
and said unto him, How can these things be? To which Jesus answered v. 10. Art
thou a Master in Israel, and know not these things? As much as to say, that
this was a common thing among the Jews, and that our Savior in describing the
regeneration or conversion of a sinner after this manner, did but allude to the
received Opinions and Doctrines among themselves; for according to them it was
literally true, that a man did really enter into his Mothers womb, in order to
being born again. Lastly, Joh. 9. 1, 2. As Jesus passed by, he saw a man, which
was blind from his birth, and disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin,
this man or his parents, that he was born blind? Which place, though some
learned men are pleased to interpret in favor of the Doctrine of
Pre-existence, in a superior state, and a more refined, subtle and aetherial
body; yet from those testimonies of Josephus and of Scripture it self, which I
have produced, think it much more reasonable to interpret it of the Doctrine of
Transmigration out of one terrestrial body into another.

These are the reasons that persuade me to believe the Zamolxis of the Getae to
be a composition of Jah and Moloc together, and consequently are a confirmation
of Pythagoras his either immediate, or at least oblique and secondary
acquaintance with the Jews; and I do humbly conceive, that what I have said
upon this occasion is so plain, and so demonstrative, that it carries its own
evidence along with it; and will therefore, as presume to hope, give all the
satisfaction, which an enquiry of this nature can afford to learned men. But
notwithstanding this, it is to be confessed, that Porphyrie gives another
Etymon of this so celebrated and famous name, which I shall now produce to show
the unskillfulness of Porphyrie, and the insufficiency of his conjecture; which
instead of doing any disadvantage or disparagement to mine, shall but further
recommend it to the good opinion of every judicious and impartial Reader: the
words of Porphyrie then are these, (...). That is, he (Pythagoras) had another
boy, whom he bought in Thrace, whose name was Zamolxis, which name was given
him; for that immediately after he was born, he was wrapped up in a Bears skin,
for the skin of any beast is by the Thracians called Zalmos.

If this conjecture be true, as I shall demonstrate it to be false, then it
ought to be read in the Copies of Porphyrie, not Zamolxis; but Zalmoxis, as it
is de facto in some MSS. of Herodotus, and of the Citations out of him of
Aeneas Gazeus, and of Eustathius in his Scholiast upon Dionysius Alexandrinus,
commonly called (...). Aldobrandinus in his notes upon Laertius, at least as I
have seen it in the London Edition, citing this place of Porphyrie, calls it
(...), which is certainly false, for Zaimos is vox nihili, a word of no
signification; and though Zalmos be the true reading of Porphyrie, as appears
by all those Copies of diverse Authors, that read the name pretended to be
derived from it, Zalmoxis; yet I conceive it is not the true word of the
Scythians themselves, who (bating the instance of Zamolxis, which being now the
matter in dispute, must not be drawn into argument either way) by what has
been said of the word Gebelisin, appear to have had no small tang of Hebraism
among them; but the true word, as I conceive, is Zamlos, for Semilah in Hebrew
signifies any garment, and we know the first garments, after fig leaves, were
made of leather, Genesis 3. 21. Which might be the reason why Semilah among the
Scythians might answer to (...), or by mistake it might be so interpreted by
one who had the Story of Genesis in his mind, which sort of mistakes do very
often happen among unskilful men; but yet I will not absolutely deny, but
there might possibly be a Metathesis in the case, and that what the Hebrews
called Semilah, the Getae might call Selimah or Salmah, as (...) and (...) in
Greek are the same; and what the Hebrew calls Chetoneth, and the Greek (...),
is Tunica in Latin, though I rather conceive that to be a tuendo, because it
defends us from the injuries of weather, and so all the Films and Membranes of
the Eye are by Anatomists called Tunicae, still a tuendo from guarding and
protecting the Pupil, about which they are spread.

But supposing this to be indeed a Scythian or Hebrew word, which yet is
improbable, because such a signification of Selimah, would confound it with the
root of Shallem or Shalom, by which all manner of peace and prosperity is
denoted; and supposing this to be the true signification, which Porphyrie has
assigned, yet by what Analogy shall we be able to come at the whole word
Salmoxis; for my part I do not understand it, and I believe it would puzzle a
better Grammarian than I pretend to be.

Again, Suidas tells us, (...), Zamolxis it the Feminine gender is the name of
a God dess. And how? was this Goddess too wrapped in a Bears skin. (...)!
Auditum admissi risum teneatis.


Zamolxis therefore, or rather Zamolxos, as the Etymologist reads it, Jah
Moloc; and Zamolxis is, Juno Regina, (...).

But in the Story of Pythagoras, there is not only mention of Zabratus and
Zamolxis, but also of Charondas and Zaleucus. Porphyrie, (...), He (Pythagoras)
gave Laws (to several people their named) by the hands, or by the Ministry of
Charondas the Catanean, and of Zaleucus of Locris. Now if a man consider with
himself, what has been said of Zabratus and Zamolxis, and that the latter of
these, notwithstanding that by the ignorance of the Greek Writers, he is made
Contemporary with Pythagoras himself, and represented as his servant and his
disciple; yet in the opinion of Herodotus, who is in this confirmed by the
Etymologist and by Suidas, he is much ancienter than Pythagoras his time; the
truth of which appears likewise by the most likely Etymon of his name, and by
other concurrent circumstances which I have carefully set down; I say, he that
shall consider this, and that Charondas and Zaleucus may both of them be very
plausibly reduced to the Hebrew Jah, may not absurdly conclude, notwithstanding
that these two last named are made contemporary with Pythagoras, as well as
Zamolxis was, that yet they are much ancienter as well as he; and that all of
these, Zabratus, Abibalus, Zamolxis, Gebelizin, Charondas and Zaleucus are the
same, being only so many several indigitamenta of the same Polyonymous Numen,
which was a certain indication of the Majesty and Greatness of the Divinity in
it self, and of the respect which it received from its Worshippers and
Servants, according to that of Callimachus. (...)
(...) --
From which place Mr. Seldom will needs interpret that reprehension of the
Pharisees by our Savior, that thought they should be heard for their much
speaking, (...), as if it were to be understood of this (...), by repeating
over a bed-roll of all the names of God in Scripture, such as are El, Eloah,
Elohim, Saddai, Sabbath, Adonai, Jehvoh and Ehjoh; but with due respect to the
Memory and Authority of so great a man as Mr. Seldom, I am not of his opinion,
for the Pharisees are manifestly reprehended by our Savior for the affected
length of their Prayers, in which they are unhappily imitated by their
successors of this hypocritical age into which we are fallen. Now it being
manifest that all the names of God in Scripture, though repeated several times
over, would make but a very short prayer; nothing can be more plain, than that
Mr. Selden's is but a fancifull interpretation of the place.

But to return to the consideration of Charondas and Zaleucus: And first for
Charondas, Charondas may be Jah Haran, the God of Haran, (...) the 70 call it,
and that the Heathen World had some knowledge of that Vision of the Ladder,
which might give occasion to this name, has been seen above in what has been
said concerning the (...) in Hesychius, and Das the termination of Charondas,
answers to the Hebrew Jah, from whence is the Greek (...) or (...) supposed to
be the ancientest of all the Gods, and the parent of them all; and that (...)
and (...) are the same, appears in (...), and other instances which I have
mentioned in other Papers, and will not transcribe them hither. So much for
Charondas; and for Zaleucus, what can be more like than Zaleucus, and Jah
Louchoth, that is, Deus Tabularum, with respect to the Commandments which were
written upon Tables of Stone by the singer of God himself, which Tables in
Hebrew are properly called Louchoth, and it may seem that Pythagoras consulted
these, in that those Golden Verses that go under his name, and are to be sure
very consonant to his Sentiments, though they are supposed to have been written
by Phocylides long after his time, begin with the worship of God, and
afterward enjoin reverence to an Oath, and paying the respect and honor due
to Parents.

But I only mention these two last instances to show what care ought to be
taken of Etymologies, and how deceitful the prettiest conjectures may be, when
all things are not considered; for the unanimous consent of Greek and Latin
Writers forbid us to think otherwise, but that there were indeed such humane
persons as Charondas and Zaleucus, that they lived in the age of Pythagoras,
and at those places which Porphyrie has mentioned; the one in Locris, in that
corner of Italy, which was anciently called Magna Graecia, the other in Sicily,
in or about that place which even at this day goes by the name of Catanea,
where the late dreadful eruption of the Volcano's happened: and the true
Analogy of both those names is this; as from (...), or (...), is Epaminondas;
so from (...), or (...), is Charondas; and Zaleucus is as much as (...), that
is, the Latin Albius or Albinus, the French Le Blanc, the Italian Bianchi, and
the English White; so the Etymologist, (...), the Eolique Dialect expresses
the Preposition (...) by (...) and though I was once of the mind for another
reason, besides, that it will favor my conjecture, or rather demonstration,
that the Hebrew Jah, and the Greek (...) are the same, viz. to avoid a very
fulsome tautology in the Etymologist, that this place ought rather to be read,
with a very light mutation, (...) yet since I have altered my mind, not only
because my conjecture needs it not, but because the oblique case in any
instance that I can think of is never a part of the composition in the Greek
tongue, unless it be the genitive, of which there are examples, (...).
