To the Supreme Authority, the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England. The
Humble Address and Congratulation of many thousands of Watermen belonging to
the River of Thames.
Most Renowned and Worthy Patriots,
THe various changes and troubles that this Nation of late years has been
involved into (the oppressions and miseries thereby entering into the doors of
every private person) has made us sensible of the mis-government and
maladministration of public affairs; and though we are not exercised in
matters of Rule, but wholly subjected to the several Usurping Powers that have
been over us, yet are we thereby (though to our sad and woeful experience)
taught the reasons of our growing miseries and strange alterations in
Government, (unhinging and moving the Nation from the firm foundations of all
safety and peace) and we cannot expect any remedy, but a further addition of
confusion and misery, until the Original Cause and Root of those evils be
clean taken ^way, all that is of personal and private Constitution (whether of
ancient or latter date) weeded out, and the Public secured and centered upon
the grounds of common Concernment, equal and impartial to all. Of old time
indeed our Parliaments have been intermixed and clogged with Kingship and
Peerage, and though owned and of long continuance, yet were they of great abuse
and violation to the just Rights of the People, (a mere Family-Interest, and in
perpetual opposition to the whole) neither King nor Lords being any part of the
true Parliaments of England, but an imposed power upon them from the Interest
of the Old Norman Sword; a true Parliament being the Representative of the
People, their chosen Deputies in Council, neither King nor Lords being chosen
or representing either County, City, or Borough, but merely as unnatural Wens
and Bunches upon that Authority, the evils whereof this Nation has felt
through all succession of times, the Over-balance of those Families proving
fatal to the whole, multiplying miseries and calamities upon us at mere will
and pleasure, till the same at last (extending too far) broke forth into an
absolute war, the Parliament taking up arms against the King in the just
vindication and defense of our Laws and Liberties; and after many sharp and
bloody battles, it pleased God to give the People in Parliament Conquest over
these Prerogative Powers.

But after the first War was over, and God had delivered the King (the Capital
and Grand Author of our Troubles) into your hands, desperate Combinations and
Endeavors were then used by the now secluded Members to render that Conquest
fruitless and in vain; which the better to effect, a malignant tumult of
Apprentises and rude people was procured to come up to Westminster, who put the
first grand Disturbance and Force upon the Parliament, that the Speaker and
those Members who had not forfeited their right of Session in Parliament, were
forced to fly from the House for shelter to their Army, while the apostate
Members in their absence chose themselves a new Speaker, raised the City, and
proceeded to the forming of an Army under Poynze and Massey, admitting the
impeached Members to sit in the House, and Vote as formerly, when they had been
expelled by this House in full Parliament from their Session there, for the
treasonable Engagement in the City of London 1647. and drawing the Scots to
invade this Nation.

And now the Old Enemy again (under a pretended Right from the first Election
of the said impeached and confederate Members) endeavors their readmittance
in Parliament, on purpose to reinforce our old bondage of Monarchy again upon
us, putting the Ambition of a single Family in competition with the Republic
of England; this being the apparent design of the now secluded Members against
us. But as your Honors have upon just grounds declared and adjudged their
Exclusion lawful, So we will with our lives and fortunes stand by you therein.

Now after your Honors had past over this first grand Interruption, and were
freed in your Counsels from the said traiterous Confederates, and so entered
upon the free exercise of your Trust again, cut off the King, and were settling
the Government in the way of a Free State, without Kingship, Peerage and
Persecution, wholly paid off your Armies and Navies, and even brought us to the
Harbor of Freedom and Safety, another Interruption succeeds by that Apostate
and Tyrant Oliver, who introduces a more absolute Monarchy then before. And
being thus removed from the Freedom of a Commonwealth to a Family-Interest
again, horrible and innumerable were the Evils which naturally followed: Peace
made with the Dutch upon dishonorable terms, when by your Navies they were
almost subdued; the Act of this Parliament for the increase of Navigation and
Trade totally neglected, an unnecessary and destructive War with Spain
contracted, Taxes and Impositions exacted without consent in Parliament, all
Law and Justice overawed at pleasure, the great Treasure of the Nation left by
this Parliament in Banck wholly spent, new vast Sums raised, and an
unparalled Debt contracted, multitude of Shipping lost, and thousands of the
free People of England destroyed in Jamaica and Flanders, all Trade ruined, and
Beggary and Confusion brought upon us; no other being the Issues to be expected
from Kingship or Single Person.

But it having pleased God to take this Tyrant from us, and to blast the
designs of that Family, and once again to make way for your Return, whereby
the hearts of your most cordial Friends were made glad and revived with fresh
hopes of an happy settlement by your hands, and in that little respite of time
you had you gave an honorable beginning to that happy Work; but the ambition
and private interest of the Great Officers of the Army not being able to endure
the same, you received another Interruption, which carried the face of a more
universal and fatal Calamity to the Nation then all that went before; this
Parliament, our Laws, and all future Parliaments seeming thereby to be
extinguished, (the blow being aimed thereat) and all Civil Authority dissolved.
In which time of public Confusion, your Servants (the Watermen) most of us
gave in our names to Colonel William Wetton and his Officers (being by them
much animated thereunto) with full resolution to venture our lives under his
Command, for Restoration of this Parliament again, against all Enemies and
Opposers thereof.

And now it having pleased Almighty God, by a most wonderful and no less then
miraculous appearance to bring you together again in great honor and freedom,
we do render all due praise and acknowledgments to God for the same, and do
heartily congratulate your most happy Return, owning this Parliament to be the
Natural Head of our Country, the Supreme Authority of the Commonwealth of
England, and do humbly present our Obedience to your Honors Command in the
justification and defense of your Persons and Authority against all Enemies
whatsoever; hoping you will now clearly free us from all personal and private
Faction, (God hitherto blasting all the Counsels and Undertakings of such) and
safely settle us upon the speedy succession of Equal Representatives, wherein
(according to your late Declaration) our Laws and Liberties may be preserved,
all Arbitrary Powers prevented, Trade and Navigation encouraged, Division and
Differences ended, and the whole People quieted in the common Brotherhood of
Unity, Freedom and Peace; that not only this Age, but the Generations to come
may be happy therein, and call you Blessed; which is the hearty Prayer of

Right Honorable, Your dutiful and most obedient Servants.

Tuesday, January 31. 1659.
THe House being informed that diverse Petitioners were at the Door, they were

affections, who are their Neighbors; as ye have always had, so now you have
manifested your good affections to the Parliament. Upon all these
Considerations, the Parliament have commanded me to give you hearty thanks,
