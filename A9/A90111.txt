An ODE MADE ON THE WELCOME NEWS OF The safe Arrival and kind Reception OF THE
Scottish Collony AT Darien in America.
NOw is the time for Thanks and Praise;
Now is the time, when every Tongue
Should echo forth a joyful Song:
When Scotland with joint Notes should raise
To HEAVEN glad Consorts of Harmonious Lays.
II.
Consider SCOTS, how much ye owe
to Heaven's Protecting Power above;
what mighty Tributes of your Love,
And Grateful Service should ye show!
How lowly Worship Him on Earth below!
III.
Who by His Divine Power does guide
the infant weakness of your State,
and shows that He will make ye Great;
Provided ye in's Fear abide,
And from your Necks shake every yoke beside.
IV.
It Is He alone, that can Chastise
our Sins; and it is He alone
that can our Blemishes Atone;
Whose awful Nod does shake the Skies,
And all the quaking World terrifies.
V.
His Gracious overruling Sway
sent out a gentle prosperous Breeze,
to sweep our Navy over the Seas.
In Three Moons they traversed their way,
And safely Rode in their intended Bay.
VI.
He soothed the Natives savage Breasts,
and thawed them to Humanity
almost like Christian Charity;
They whom they dreaded worse than Beasts,
Join all as Brethren in their Jovial Feasts.
VII.
Their Land they freely did Resign,
and all the Treasures of their Soil,
and frankly bear a share in the Toil,
To carry on the Great Design,
And, for their Common Intrest, both Combine.
VIII.
He safely did conduct again,
the welcome, much desired Express,
confirming our Great Happiness:
He smoothed the rageing of the Main,
And made it like a level Bowling Plain.
IX.
The Country now will be at ease,
the tender Mothers will no more
their Sons Uncertain Fate deplore;
And Indian Gold shall soon release
The Nation from its Tempral Poverty

*Grand Disease.
X
No swarms of Beggars shall annoy,
no Vagabounds corrupt our Wealth;
but every Man that enjoys Health,
His frugal Country shall employ
To Increase our Store, and crown our lasting Joy.
XI.
Let the Fourth of November stand
a lasting Feast Day on Record
as Birthday of our Sovereign Lord,
And that on which our Darling Band
First set their Foot on Caledonia's Land.
XII.
May the first Week of that Month be
as lucky to us ever more,
as it has been in times before,
In bringing forth our Liberty
From Powder-plots and Arbitrary Tyranny.
EDINBURGH, Printed by James Watson in Craig's Closs 1699.
