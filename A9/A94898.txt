A true and certain Relation of sundry great Machinations and Plots of diverse
Jesuits, Priests, and other Papists in several parts of this Kingdom against
the Proceedings of the Honorable the High Court of PARLIAMENT.

And for the bringing in superstition and Popery into this KINGDOM.

Together with the Copy of a Bull sent by the Pope to Father William
Stillington, Provincial of the English Jesuits, promising in it plenary
Indulgence to all those that should assist the Papists Cause; that is, full
remission of their sins.

Published by one that has known all their Plots, and by him discovered for
the benefit of this COMMONWEALTH.

LONDON, Printed for Fr. Wright.

IN Lancashire a Country very aburdant in Popish Recusants: They have by the
instigations of diverse Popish Priests and Jesuits, being the only instigators
and stirrers up of the sunple peoples disaffection to the Parliaments
Proceedings, there being in the Army of James Earl of Darby, at least two
hundred noted Recusants, besides a great number of Church Papists; they having
contributed ^o the charge of his Army privately at least ten thousand pounds,
besides diverse of them maintain themselves at their own cost, and their men.
Such are the malicious intentions of those Popish Malignants, as appeared
lately in their wicked plot against the good, Town of Manchester; which in
loyalty to the Parliament was invaded by the Earl of Darby, who being repulsed
from thence with much disgrace and loss, diverse Papists thereabouts plotted
how they might betray it by treachery. Coming therefore ^o Manchester in the
habit of Country market folk, they were received into the house of one John
Davison a suspected Recusant, being indeed a Church Papist, where they laid
this wicked design; namely, that on the next night they should set fire on
diverse outhouses in the Town, which while the Inhabitants were busy in
quenching, some of my Lord of Darbyes Troops that were lodged privately in the
adjoining Villages should upon the signal of the fire rush into the Town,
surprise it, fire it, and kill up the Inhabitants. Man purposes and God
disposes, who brings to naught the counsel of the ungodly. These Papist
Cavaliers, whereof two of them were Priests: One Father Goddinton a Jesuit,
and Father Kensington a Secular, drinking at the Tavern with the rest of the
Conspirators, being in number eight, glorying in their intended business,
discoursed the likelinesse of the success one to another in Italian, thinking
no man had understood them: But the host of the house, a good sensible fellow,
that had sometime been a soldier under the States of Venice in Italy, though
he spoke not Italian perfectly, he understood enough to detect their villainy,
and so slipping out of the room he hasted to the Magistrates of the Town and
revealed the whole Conspiracy, aggravating the danger the Town was in if it
were not suddenly prevented. They taking into consideration their own peril
with a strong guard presently beset the house, the Bayliffe entering into their
room, and charging them in the Kings name to yield themselves; one of those
desperate Priests pulled out of his pocket a little dag, discharged it against
the good Bayliffes breast; but he by falling flat on his face to the ground
avoided the blow, and the other Company entering. they seeing resistance in
vain yielded themselves, and upon examination confessed their hellish purpose.
Whereupon they were committed to safe custody, and the Townes-men resolved, if
it were possible, to entrap those Troops of the Earl of Darbyes that lay in
ambush for their ruins; knowing, that to deceive the deceiver is no deceit. So
placing a strong Corpse du guard in their Market place, and laying men as
closely as they could possible at all the entrances into their Town, about
eleven a clock, which was the appointed hour, they gave fire to some huge
heaps of straw and furs, which they had placed on the outside of the Town on
set purpose; The Cavaliers acknowledging the Signal came in upon the spur
toward the Town, dispersing themselves to the several Lanes and Entrances
thereof in sundry small Bodies, making assured account of firing, and pillaging
that wealthy and populous Town. But no sooner were they entered within each
street, but our men saluted them with their Muskets. The very women out of the
Windows and Casements, pouring scalding water on their heads, and the Corpse du
Guard from the Marketplace, taking down each Lane of the Town, they put
those miscreants into a terrible affright, killing at least sixty six, the rest
of them befriended by the darkness of the night, turned their Horses about and
fled cursing Manchester as a place fatal to them and their Companions.

In the Army of the Lord Herbert of Ragland, son to the Earl of Worcester,
at least a third part are notorious Papists, all those Recusants of Wales being
entertained into his socity. And it is credibly reported the occasion of that
Lords desertion from the honorable Court of Parliament to the Kings
malignants, was merely at the instigation of a Priest, one Father Stillington
his Confessor, who by threatening the poor noble man with damnation, if he did
not assist the Catholic Cause, whose Champions, as he terms them, the Army
of the Cavaliors was; and promising a free remission of all his sins if he
undertook the quarrel, drew him unwillingly into it. The said Stillington as
it is affirmed for the advancing his wicked designs against the peace of this
Kingdom, and hoping to bring in Popery hither, to encourage all superstitious
Recusants to the liberal contribution of money toward the charge of the war,
and that they should hazard their lives with the greater desperatnesse in the
Cause, procured a Bull from his holy Father the Pope, wherein he promises
plenary indulgence to all that shall assist the Catholic cause: the Copy of
which in English (though the original be Latin) that all may understand I
have here truly set down.

Urban the eighth, a servant of the servants of God, by whose special
providence We are constituted Christ's Vicar, General here on earth, and as his
successor. Keeper of the keys of Saint Peter: To all our dearly beloved
sons, the true Roman Catholics in England, Grace and Apostolical
benediction Whereas it has been notified unto Our holiness by our dear son
and faithful servant, William Stillington, of the society of Jesus in England,
Vice-Provinciall, that there are some hopes that the Catholic Cause may
again respire in England, after so many persecutions, since sanguis martyrum
est semen Ecclesiae, there being forces now on foot in that Island, the quondam
dowry of our blessed Virgin Mary, to eradicate their pretended Gospel, which
on the infallible faith of our holy Chair, is mere heresy. We do hereby
require, and fatherly advise you and every of you, and as Christ's Vicar and
Feeder of his flock (whose voice all his sheep will obey) We by this our
Bull, do charge and command you in general, that you be assistant both with
bodies and goods to the said holy war, to which whosoever contributes money, or
goes in person, shall be capable of, and receive these indulgences following:

Imprimis, saying every a day a Pater noster and an Ave Maria, he shall
certainly have the power to release any soul whom he intends, out of the pains
of Purgatory. Item, he sHall receive full power and authority to eat flesh in
Lent, Advent, and other prohibited times. Item, he shall without absolution
from his Ghostly father, or any other Priest receive remission for all his
venial sins. Item, he shall for ever be freed from the danger of Purgatory,
and as often as he pleases release a soul from thence. Item, it shall be in
his power to give full remission from any venial sins, to any persons as
ample as if they received it from a Priest after confession. Item, that
whosoever shall dye in the Catholic Cause, though they be hanged, drawn and
quartered, shall be sure to be put into our general Calender of Martyrs, and
be let into heaven by the keys of Saint Peter.
All these Indulgences we do freely confirm the dispensing which we conferro
on the said Father, William Stillington, and his substitutes;

Given under our hand this tenth of October, Stilo Novo, at the Vatican, and
signed sub annulo piscatoris.
By the virtue of this Bull, though it be as ridiculous as uneffectuall,
Stillington roaring it out among the ignorant superstitious Papists in those
parts, has procured no small aid to the Lord Herbert; both of men and money,
who, though he had the impudence in a Letter to my Lord of Stamford, to tax the
high Court of Parliament for entertaining Papists into their Army, which they
never did or intended, yet himself has been glad to make up the best part of
his malignant forces, of such superstitious misled ignorant people by the means
aforesaid, seduced into his quarrel: so like wise in the Army raised by the
Earl of Newcastle in Northumberland, and the Bishopric of Durham, the most
considerable number of them both for wealth and bravery are convicted
Recusants, whose purses have been largely stretched, and revenues exposed to
sale and morgage for the raising and maintaining the said Earls forces.
Ammuniton and Arms in abundance, being upon all occasions transported from
Dunkirke to Newcastle, being purchased there by the factors and moneys of the
Jesuits of Liege, Gaunt, Watten and Saint Omers, that have used, and do daily
endeavor all that is possible, to soment and increase confusion amongst us;
nay, this very City of London, as carfull as it is looked to, and as
excellently governed as can be imagined, is not free from these Serpents that
sting unseen, they daily machinating and contriving new mischiefs against the
kingdom and the sacred Parliament, whose vigilant Ministers have detected
diverse of those incendiaries, and brought them to their so well merited
destiny, the Gallows, make us thankful for it, and in time, no doubt, the
rest of that damned Idolatrous crew of Priests and Jesuits, will come to the
same end; for their inventions are all wickedness, and how they may destroy
the peace of Israel, which God grant may flourish like an Olive tree, and we
sit secure under it is branches, of which there is no doubt, having so strong a
tower of defense as the Almighty is to us, in the high Court of Parliament, the
representative body of the kingdom which has so well begun the rooting out
superstition and Popery, from amongst which, heaven in it is good time send they
may accomplish to the glory of God, and prosperity of us his people, Amen.

FINIS.
