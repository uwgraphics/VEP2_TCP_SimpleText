A SONG At the Loyal Feast, held by the Nobility and Gentry of the Parish of
St. MARTINS, kept on the 14th. of October, 1685. Being His MAJESTY'S Birth Day.
I.
TO offer up high to this Days Celebration,
The Birth of our Glorious KING;
No Gums nor Perfumes from Arabia we will bring,
Nor Sweets from the Zephyrus Grove;
The HEART that is Loyal and free from Invasion,
Is the Incense that pleases our JOVE.
Let Zealots strut on, puffed up with Ambition
Of Riches and Fame, the Source of Sedition,
Whence Treason and Jealousy springs,
With such a lost Wretch who would change his Condition;
For Fame is an Echo, and Riches have Wings,
Whilst Loyalty sleeps in the Bosom of Kings.
Chorus. Then to render a Grateful Oblation,
Of our Hearts we will an Offering lay down;
From the Counterfeit Imps of Invasion,
It Is Loyalty guards the Crown.
II.
Since then this Glad Day with the Gods did record Him
A MARS in the Annals of Fame;
This Day we devote to that Glorious Name,
Since Rebels their Shame did expose,
And Heaven through a Series of Wonders restored Him
To Triumph in spite of his Foes.
Let a Volley go round at so solemn a Season,
Let Care be a Pain, and a Sigh be held Treason,
Whilst zealous Debauches repine;
To be Drunk with Rebellion is a Sot without Reason;
Would you seek a Virtue more Noble in Wine?
It Is LOYALTY flows from the Bottom of Mine.
Chorus. Then to render, etc.
III.
With LOYALTY crowned each man fill a Brimmer,
A Health to our Sovereign JAMES;
Whose Courage his Conquests so loudly proclaims,
The Gods from all Treasons defend;
But for the Pretender and Bigoted Trimmer,
The Gibbet and Vengeance attend.
With LOYALTY armed and winged with ALLEGIANCE,
Advanced with our JOVE to the uppermost Regions
Triumphant in's Chariot we will ride;
Whilst Captivate Rebels that kick at Obedience,
Like Icarus scorcht in the height of his Pride,
Shall drop in the Ocean and fall with the Tide.
Chorus. Then to render, etc.

New Exchange in the Strand, 1685.
