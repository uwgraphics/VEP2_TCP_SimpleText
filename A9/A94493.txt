TO THE HONORABLE THE KNIGHTS CITIZENS AND BVRGESSES OF THE COMMONS HOUSE
ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT. The humble Petition of the High Sheriff and Diverse of
the Gentrey, Ministers, Freeholders, and Inhabitants of the County of Hereford.
Most Humbly shows,
THat withal thankfulness we acknowledge those many and great Blessings we
have already received through Gods mercy, the favor of our Gracious
Sovereign, the Wisdom, Council, Solicitation, and unwearied Pains and
Patience of this Honorable Assembly for the preservation of the Privileges of
Parliament, and liberties of the Subject, the removing of many of these
Obstructions which hindered your good endeavors; your zealous furthering of
bleeding Irelands Relief, earnest desire of disarming Papists, and securing of
their persons; your prudent care in disposing the Militia, Navy, and places of
Importance of this Kingdom to such persons of Trust as may (by Gods blessing)
give assurance of safety to the Kings Royal person, and good subjects of all
his Majesty's Dominions; your Pious Care to settle a Government in the Church
according to the Word of God, your godly desires to prevent the Profaning of
the Lords day, To take away Pluralities and Non Residents, and your zeal to
provide Preaching Ministry throughout the Kingdom, whereof this County
stands in great need, it now abounding with insufficient, Idle, and Scandalous
Ministers, whereby the people generally are continued in Ignorance,
Superstition, and profaneness, and are ready to become a prey to popish
suducers, which Idolatrous profession has of late years with much boldness
appeared in this County: And whereas one of our chief Commodities is the Native
Wool of this County, the price whereof is much fallen through the excessive
importation of Spanish woolls to our great impoverishing.

May it therefore please this Honorable House to continue your Prudence and
Pious inte^^^ons and endeavors in all the Premises not yet Accomplished, to
hasten the speedy releife of ^^^stressed and Gasping Ireland, To remove evil
Counselors, To take away the Votes of Po^^h Lords, Speedily to disarme the
Papists, To settle a Godly and Learned Ministry, and to re^^^aine the
excessive Jmportation of Spanish Wool.

And we shall be ready with cheerfulness to contribute all possible
Assistance, our Prayers, lives, and livelyhoods may afford for the defense of
his Majesty's Royal person, this Hhnorable House, and the preservation of the
privileges of Parliament.
