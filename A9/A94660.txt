TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORDS and COMMONS assembled in PARLIAMENT at
Westminster. The humble Petition of the Knights, Gentry, Clergy, and
Commonalty of the County of SUSSEX. Presented to both Houses upon Wednesday
last, June 7. 1648.
SHOWS,
THat the miserable effects of this civil War under which our Count^^e, and
three Kingdoms have long and heavily groaned, are the only motives of these
our humble and fervent Desires h^reby propounded to Your Honors.

1. That our most gracious Sovereign Lord King CHARLES may be speed^ly and
honorably received to a safe Treaty with the two Houses of Parliament, for
the firm settling of a well grounded Peace both in Church and Commonwealth, as
also of his own just Rights, and of the Rights of Parliament. 2. That the
Arrears of the Army under the command of the Lord Fairfax may be paid, and the
Army with all expedition disbanded. 3. That according to the Fundamental
Constitutions of this Kingdom we may be governed by the known Laws of this
Kingdom, and not otherwise. 4. That from henceforth our estates and goods may
be freed from all Taxes and Impositions. 5. That no Garrisons within the said
County be any longer continued, and that the Ordnance and Ammunition taken
from the Sea Towns may be returned for the better defense of them and the whole
Country from foreign Invasions.
We therefore (as the Well-affected Counties have already) do humbly pray You
to yield a present condescension to our humble Desires, That so our differences
and divisions may be happily composed, all misunderstandings between Prince and
People timely removed, His Majesty (according to our solemn Engagement) rendered
glorious, both King and Kingdom returned to their pristine dignity and
splendour at home and abroad, and your selves thereby merit the grateful and
universal acclamations of good and faithful Patriots.

And your Petitioners shall pray, etc.
