A Brown Dozen of Drunkards: (Ali-ass Drink-hards) Whipped, and shipped to the Jsle
of Gulls: For their abusing of Mr. Malt the bearded son, and Barley-broth the
brainlesse daughter of Sir John Barley-corne.

All joco-seriously descanted to our Wine-drunk, Wrath-drunk, Zeale-drunk,
staggering Times.

By one that has drunk at S. Patricks Well.

A brown dozen of Drunkards, ali-ass Drink-hards, Jocoseriously descanted to
our wine-drunk, wrath-drunk and zeale-drunk staggering cimes.
1. Drunken Wimble-tree, ali-ass Reeler.
THe foreman of the Jury to give in their verdict at Bacchus his Bar, that a
full pot is better then an empty purse: make way for him there, let him have
elbow-roome enough; mark how how he comes rolling like a wheelbarrow, weltring
like a Greenland Whale, and tumbling like a ship amongst Waves, half under
water: look at him well (as an emblem of our Perniz'd times, as good as any in
Catz, Quarles, Whitney, or Withers,) how he turns round like a ball, or an
unbiassed bowl, runs in a circular motion, like a Scopperill, or Whirligigg,
as though more quicksilver were in his heels, then silver in his purse; and
more weathercock on his head, then wit in his head: how naturally his feet
without any art, like a poetizing louse, with six feet, make Hexameters with
Pentameters, long and short, up and down, like the spoaks in the whirling
wheels of those Coaches, in which Tamberlaine was drawn by the pampered Jades
of Asia: By the influence of the Moon on his maulted Element, one would think
this Moon-calfe, like other calves, had the sturdie, or like a Smithfield Jade,
the staggers, he takes such frisks and capers from the circumference of the
wide streets, into the center of the channel, which he claims as his
hereditary right, by such a title as the Rebels kept a plot of ground near
Athy in Ireland, called Gallows Green, from whence they often marched (as
Campian, Garnet, and other Jesuits, from Tyber to Tyburne) down
Gallowes-gate, and up Hempstreet: he is so intoxicated in his giddy brains
like a Midsummers Goose, that he staggers in his motions, like our old and new
Enthusiasts, Familists; Anabablers once in Germany, and now in England, with
our new Seekers for the Man in the Moon drinking Claret, reeling in their
motions, and miscreant opinions, as once drunken Elderton in his Potions: I
will stand to it, that however he goes to the Ale-stand a Nowne Substantive, he
ever comes from it a Nowne Adjective, no more able to stand by himself, then a
hop or a vine without a prop or a wall: a trencher-Parasite without a feeding
Patron, or a weaning child without the upholding hand of a mother, or a nurse;
take your hand from him, and let him stand on his own legs, and you take
crutches from a cripple, and a leaning staff or post from a lame Giles, knocked
in the head with a Barley bullet, as an Ox with a Butchers Axe, procumbit humi
bos, he stands so long as he can stand, then staggers and falls, per varios
casus, after he has declined potum, (to which he is much inclined) throughout
all cases, till he be fit to be trust up in a cap-case, tendit in lutum, he
reels into the mire, where he wallowes like a weak horse in a bog, or a
Gentleman in debt, and cannot get out, till some charitable hand help him: To
anatomize him further, this Brute-asse (though not so oraculously as Brutus)
often kisseth his Mother earth, and acknowledges her bowell-bred worms to be
his brothers, yea with as much humility, as once S. Francis said brother Wolf,
he often says brother Hog, since it cannot be denied, but that as the same
Barley-graines feed and fat them both, so they are often stied together, and
kennelled in one channel, which although he lift his legs often very high,
when his head goes very low, it is very probable, that he is as full of grave
thoughts, or thoughts of his grave, as a Goose egg long sitten full of matter,
since he is so often digging his grave, as the Badger his hole, with his very
nose, only his pride is, that after he has kept his priorums amongst his
Aristippized pot-professors, he causes the stones, as once Tarlton, to kiss
his posteriornms, though they be the bones of his old mother Tellus, as Poets
tell us: the thing I most pity in him is this, that for all the reeling of this
Ganderized giddy head, if his wife card no better at home, then he reels
abroad, they will make a web no better then Arachnes clew, fit to be swept
down, or then a fools Medley of Goats wool, Dogs hair, and mossie down;
they will twist such webs as Penelope and Lucrece wove ad Calendas Graecas, in
Platoes great year, when all Hens will make holy water, all Virgin vestall Nuns
give milk, all Judges hate bribes, all Lawyear refuse fees, and all Black-coats
great benefices: but since it is as probable that he may reel home, to steal a
nap, as some Senior or Junior Immerito may be informed in these reformed times,
how to slip, steal, or stumble into an undeserved plump personage, we will
leave him to lolling, till his wine be out of his head, and his wit in, and
reflex on his next fellow.

2. Drink-hard Helluoh.
A Tospottalian of a stronger bulk and brain then the former wind (or wine)
shaken reed, or any of his fellows: one that is no flincher, he will stand to
it more then any Tinker, as a metall'd man indeed, back and edge; he will not
out, till the last man be born, nor shrink from his tippling task, (like most
now a days from their poor friends) like Western cloth in the wetting, he is
not loose in the haft, like so many Totnams that have lately turned French, yea
Hispanioliz'd, Italionate, or Devils incarnate for their own ends, if he set
his feet once at Bacchus his Bar, he cannot be peerkt over as a wrangler, he
will go through stitch with his work in sucking Bacchus his grapes, till they
be as dry as a kimestick, or the sparks in a smiths throat: he will not fall
off, as a Horse-Leach from sucking the Gouty legs of a Gundimer, when she is
full, or as a Souldierly Clineas, or Dametas from his colors, when his faint
heart is in his heels: he is a stiff blade indeed, steel to the very back,
yea to give this doughty Drunkard (like the devil) his due, though I set him
in the second place to his small grace, as though it were something, as in the
Olimpick Games, to be a second in wrestling, as the Pitcher-bangers in
Alexanders Feast at Babylon, for the Barley wreath and Bacchus his Garland, yet
indeed he is like a Cock of the game amongst Famlerts, or a Conqueror amongst
Cravens, the King and Cob of all the rest, usually a Ledger when they are all
under board; no Beer Brewers horse has the commendation to draw on, (draw in)
or bear his drink better then he: as there is fama in malo, fame even in
infamy, (which he aimed at, who burnt Diana's Temple) so like these
furre-blazed Bacchanalians in their times, Tricongius, Novengius, Bonosus,
Tymoleon, and the rest of the riotors, he is the Coripheus and prime amongst
all the frothy fraternity of Fudlers, the proto-Lippler amongst all his
Naballs, his Nebuloes, his drunken neighbors, the maine barrel amongst lesser
firkins, in which he steeps his Lands moneys and means, till both he and his
be in a pitiful pickle; he has a drunken Dropsy in his throat harder to be
quenched with wine, then the Golden Dropsy in a covetous Cremes, or then the
flames in the Northern Hecla, the Scicilian Aetna, or that Vesuvius which
choked Pliny, to be quenched with water; harder to be cured then the Gout, the
Sciatica, the Strangury, or the regnant spleen amongst Sectaries of all sorts
and sexes: yea as dangerous, so no less difficult to be cured, then the
shaking of the elbow in an habituated Gamester, the hot mouth Fever in a
scold, the tongue Palsy in a babbling Battus, the stone in the heart, worse
then in the reins of Pharoized impenitents, his Appetite for drink; is like
the grave for bodies, hell for sonles, materia prima for forms, the fire for
fuel, and the barren womb of a Messalina for lust, which was lassata non
satiata, insatiable, as Pliny the younger, Plautus, Cleanthes, Demosthenes, and
others in their Diurnall, and nocturnall studies, were Helluobs (Librorum) of
Books, so he is Helluoh liquidorum, of bottles filled with liquids, quo plus
bibuntur, plus sitiuntur aquae, the more he drinks, more dry he is, like the
Smiths forge, says Leonius, ( de Morbis lib. 8. cap. 8. sect. 3.) which by an
Antiparistasis burns more fiercely by casting water on it, like un^leckt lime:
liquids rather inflame him, then cool him, I know no disease more spread over
millions of Microcosmes, like a Canker, more domineering, more incapable of
cure, then this swelling Gangrene, or a swilling drinking Dropsy, except a
Tympany of more then Antichristian, even Luceferian pride in many Sectaries.

3. Of drunken Barnabee.
WIth whom to make a short dispatch, and to trusse up his humor in a paper
halter, because we have dwelt too long upon Helluoh, this Barnabee, ali-ass
Maudlin drunk, besides the description that his proper new Ballad makes of him,
as drunk all night and dry in the morning, his carch being still one tooth is
dry, like one old Chamberlain, called old Twitcher in Yorkshire, who though he
had washed many hundred pounds down his throat, protested he was yet dry for
all that: but passing by that humor, which has some coincidence with
Helluohs, this our maultified Maudlin is but half drunk and half sober, like a
Newter in Religion, half a Protestant, half a Papist, half light, half
darkness, like the twilight, or as a lukewarm Laodicean professor, half
hot, half cold, or indeed his true Hierogliphick is an Archized, Tarltonized
Buffon, half a fool, half a knave, like a mule, half a horse, half an ass, or
a Cynocephalist, half a dog, half an ape, or a Mare-maid, half fish half
flesh, (Mulier formosa superne desinens in piscem,) but chiefly reflecting on
Virgils worse verse, as a Ventriloquist termed his semivirumque bovem,
semibovemque virum, half a man in his sober part, half an Ox, a very beast in
his acted drunken postures, just (or unjust) as King Philip was on his
Tribunal, half asleep, half awake, not as a Lion, the emblem of a Politician,
waking when he feignes to sleep, as that Witt-all, or all-wit, in Rome did to
Mecoenas: (with his soli Mecoenati dormio) but like a Semidormant, and
Semivigilant, betwixt hawke and buzzard, cup and can, a Semi-drunkard, and
Semi-soberatus, quoth old Horsley, like a mere mongrill, half a Gray-hound,
half a Mastife: yet as in Divinity we say, that God will have all in man or
naught, the whole man or no man, without any more will to admit a corrivall,
then Caesar to shift stakes with Pompey, or Alexander with Darius, or the true
mother once to divide the child with the false mother, detesting an Agrippa,
that is but half persuaded to be a Christian and no further, like a Cake, half
baked, or flesh half boiled, or half broiled, occasioning so much our Irish
Fluxes: so in moralty, though I approve what Paul allowed Timothy, and Solomon's
Mother the sad hearted, a little wine, as a little rain to refresh the earth,
not to bog it with too much, or so many cups from the grape (according to the
old distinction) as tend to necessity, and to hilarity, yea to acuity to
whetten the wits of a heavy Dutchman, and to heat a cold Beotian brain, yet I
dislike a man to be half drunk, maudlin drunk, and but partly sober, as I
distaste a man that is but partly honest, and not downright as Cato in Rome,
and Phocion in Athens, and a woman that is suspected to be too great a dancer
with the Roman Sempronia, or too great a comrade, with young Gallants, like
Augustus his Livia, and Julia, to be held absolutely honest. But to trouble the
bystanders no more with this half-staking Gamester, I touch upon another, who
has often troubled me.

4. One drunken Tom Trouble-towne, or Troublesome.
A Wonderful Linguist, tho no Artist; unless that illiberall Ars bibendi, the
art of drinking or drowning all arts and good parts like some Beuclarks in
drink, as Pearls cast into boggs, be an art, though as needless as for a
young Phaeton to help Phoebus in his Chariot, or a candle to help the Suns
light, to as much purpose as for a pen-feathered, pride-puft ignorant arrogant
Novice to intrude himself to gain souls, or rather silver from an aged, a
powerful, painful, and gifted Divine, which were as though some Gusman or
Gooseman Junior, should offer to help an old man, though a bold man, and
spirited, to get children on his Brides Matrimonial or Ministerial: This
premised, to descant and describe him in his pestilent postures. A blustering
blatrant blade he is, who cannot be content to be drunk in silence, (as many a
biting usurer, a close adulterer, an envious Snake, a silent Serpent, a
covetous Euclio, a churlish Nabal, a plotting Court Haman, a Camp'd Achitophel,
are damned in hugger mugger, and go to the Devil their Father without any
noise) but his brains once washed, and his tongue oyled with the bleedings of
the Barley, the clack of a Water Milne, the striking of the Jacks, the whirling
of the wheels in a Clock, the scolding of two Xantippes, the prevarications of
two Sophisters in the Schools, the word Tiltings of two Lawyers at the Bar,
yea, the chatterings of Crows in a wood, when their nests are pulled down, or
the removal of a Court or a Camp, are not with more noise and disturbance then
drunken blusterings, houtings and shoutings of this turbulent Tom
Trouble-towne, which are more harsh then the noise of Dragons, the hallow tones
of Biturnes, the shrill shreeks of Night-owles, or the loud Hones and Hubbubs
of our clamorous Irish: but if these speak him not fully, when he drinks
fluently, the shouts which the old wives in Chaucer gave, and Dame Partlet the
Hen, when the Fox carried Chanticleere the Cock to the wood, or the
vociferations of the Carthaginean wives, when their children were shipped, and
carried pledges to Rome, scarce parallel the clamours and Stentor voices, which
this obstreperous immorigerous troublesome Tofpot with his night-walking
Nebuloes make, when their throats are deep ramm'd, and the barrells of their
brains full charged with Bacchus his bolts: Oh they roar then as if in so many
Pumps, they so deaf the snortings of Bears, the howling of Irish Wolves, and
the barkings of all the Towne-Doggs, that it is not possible to steal a nap
for them, so long as these Tarmagants roar; for my poor part, I had rather
hear a hundred bullocks of mine own bellow, and a thousand sheep of mine own
bleat, then to have my ears taken up by a Commission in the commotion of their
black Santos: and however some Zealists have rather delighted in an untuned
Welsh Harp, or in a Scotch Bagpite, then in the bellowings out of an Alehouse
into Cathedralls of some white and black-spotted Bulls of Basan, (as they
Satirically stigmatized them, and their unedefying Cantings to loud Organs,)
yet to me nothing comes more harsh then the Reboations of these tumultuous
Trouble-townes, excepting to hear or see an ominous Owl or a foolish Moore
Cock making a noise in an ill becomed usurped cage, with the extrusion of a
more-desired, more-delighting, more-deserving Nightingale, or an ignorant
beardlesse Symplicius with no more learning then a Layman, flurting up as
unwarrantably, unworthily, unwelcomely into the Pulpit of such a Divine
extruded, as might be his Tutor for gifts and years, to beat into his blockish
brains both morality, Divinity, science, conscience, humanity and civility,
with all all the blusterings of Sir John Barlicornes clamorous Clyents could
not so disquiet me, as to so or hear (what I heard at second hand in Ireland)
numerous Locusts singing, and Frogs croaking from Po and Tyber in the chambers
(as Quondam near Thames) of Catholicall Grandees, and collapsed Ladies: yet in
conclusion in the greatest feared confusion, I should be distressed, disturbed,
and distracted more then by all these, if I should see or hear in this our
white Albion (died red by the Pseudodox, as once Jerusalem, Antioch, and
Damascus with the blood of the Orthodox) the raging of French and Spanish
Bears, the roarings of Turkish Lions, the bellowings of Romish Bulls, (louder
then from five Popes in Queen Elizabeth's days) and the howlings of Irish
Wolves, called Rebels, in the deadly tones of the Moabites, up and to the
spoils of our English Israelites, let us fish our own ends in their muddied
yea bloodied waters, we are called in by a powerful, and pestilent
party-colored spotted Leopard, called Liberty of Conscience, to plant every
Nation and nature with more immunity and impunity then in Poland and Holland,
his own braine-bred Religion, though a blasphemous Alchoran, or Thalumd, or
Valentinus his renewed fond Aeones, or the reawakened dreams of Montanus and
Priscilla, or the deluding dotages of the Fratricellians, and Begnardines, and
filthy Familists and Adamites, which fired Italy and Germany; all these with a
Warrantizabimus by the unerring spirit of Revelation without any Scripturian
foundation, to be planted by power and possession, to the supplanting of grace,
peace, truth, and to the deforming a pretended and projected uneffected
Reformation. But least my porcupined pen pricking the galled hides of guilty
hearts, should so far trouble some zeal-drunk Zoilists, more then Drunkards
trouble me, as not only to kick me out of a Church, as if innocent Philip from
his own pride to be possessed by some Herodian hot-spur, but to hurry me into
John's prison, or Jeremiabs Dungeon, since procul a Jove, procul a Fulmine, it is
good sleeping in a warm skin, least this troublesome fellow by Law concluding
in Ferio, trouble me as I have troubled him; I fly from him tanquam a cane and
angue, as from an unworm'd dog or snake, and bring on the Stage another, as
though butter would not melt in his mouth. And that is

5. Drunken Agonethetas,
THe Master of the Revells, called M. Controler, who as peert as a Peermonger,
and as spruce as a finicall Barber, will have either thing (which we scarce do
in our devotions) done in his drink in or der, though he cares as little for
any solid Doctrine, as Aesops Cock fora Pearl, or a dog for a holy thing,
which he sleights, as the Gaderens did the best Doctor, and as our Gadders now
into the Land of Nodd, nullify our best Divines: yet he is wonderful
punctual, for Discipline is observed more strictly in his Taphouses, then in
some Temples, or in the whilom Camps of Caesar, Scipio, Hannibal, Sertorius,
Charles the fifth, or the Germane Otho the 4. for even when he drinks with his
comraigns as unmeasurably as any historified. Tricongians and Novengians, or as
Alexander at Celanus his Funeral, and when he danceth after full pots, as
after full blown pipes, the English Dance (now most in use in Courts, Camps,
Countries and Cities) called, Passing measure, and Sellingers round, or the
world upon wheels, yet he will be unmeasurably angry and more hot then a
Graves-end Toast, if all things be not done in measure: hence he acts more
complements in drinking then Jesuits and Friars in their studied Cringings and
duckings, or then the French, Spanish, or Italian in their Courtings, all
besprinkled with Court-holy water; so long as he can stand, he stands as much
upon ceremonies in all houses that are Alehouses, as ever they were stood
upon, urged, pressed and prescribed in Bishop Quondams days, ere the
altar-case so much altricated, did alter and halter too ( quo Jure, I discuss
not) in the reign of Sir John Presbyter, opposed by Hugh Sir Peter, and his
Petreans: hence in all his punctual postures acted to a hair, he vents all
his invented and new minted complementall phrases of Ditantoes, supernaculmus,
upsefreeze, pro fas, cup-Waggins bearing up stiff, winding up to the bottom,
with his constant care of observing all the Statutes enacted in Bacchus his
headless, brainlesse, staggering and party-colored Senate, as amongst the
rest: First, that no blown drink be left, it is loathed as some birds loath
their eggs, if a Serpent do but breath on them. Secondly, healths as they go
(like causes often in Courts) by favor and friends, so they must be pledged
personally, not (as some noble men say grace, and have some to venture hell for
them) by any Atturneyes, Stewards and Deputies. Thirdly, some healths must go
(as the globed world and the tottering times go) round, and like current coin
pass from man to man, till the motion the potion begin again, from terminus a
quo, till it end in the terminus ad quem. Fourthly, though some Auditors and
Schoolboyes in Churches care not for more then needs, being so conscionable,
that they care not how little they have for money; yet as a just measuring man
that will have penniworths for his penny, he will have the black pot as brim
full as he has the liquids from it brainefull, blatherfull, and bellifull.
Fifthly, he will have no drinking to the Tapster, Chamberlain, Drawer, or
vulgar Officers, as once Tom Brown to his man. Sixthly, he so observes the Sex
Feminine before the Masculine, being honored in England, women's paradise, more
then in India, Turkey, Italy, or any Country their Purgatory, withal knowing
that in most Countries Ducks will drink as much as Drakes, and Geese as much as
Ganders, he enacts, that a woman must be drunk unto first, before a man, and
sometimes first drunk also. Seventhly, he looks that every man pledge what is
drunk to him, not looking for any Lord-Dane or Lurdan to be pledge for him.
Eighthly, he often urges, that every man shall drink as many cups as there be
letters in the name of his absent friend, whose health he drinks, for which he
quotes a verse of as much Antiquity or Iniquity, in Martial, that Naevia sex
Cyathis septem justina bibatur, Lide quatuor I Would tribus. Ninethly, every man
must keep to his first man, souping of his full Can if he can, herein
resembling the Lion whose eye is never off him who darted first at him.
Tenthly, he will not have it forgotten to call ever for a shot pot or come
again, after the reckoning, as a man of great reckoning in his drink, though
of small account, being sober; in such exact punctualities he would turn all
drinkings, as some lately (to their small Laud be it spoken) all Church Service
into Ceremony, all solemn spiritual Worship into Formality, as all Bottle-ale
turns into froath, most of Owls flesh into feathers, and Banbury Cheese into
parings. But we have had enough of him and his Complements, we Summon next to
the Bar,

6. Drunken Dick the Gull-Gallant.
NOt Dick mihi Musa virum, for though this be a true Trojan, and a mad merry
Grigg, though no Greek; yet he is not Virgils Dick, nor Dick of the old house
of Lancaster, nor Dick Ecclesiae; old Dick Bancroft of Canterbury in his time
the Domine fac totum, that with a perilous pen writ his Theses Periculosae,
perilous positions, like Lisamachus Nicanor, and Owens Antipareus,
parallelling English and Scottish Puritans (as Pluritans branded them) with
State-firing Jesuits; nor is it Dick Dulman who commenced at Dawes Cross, and
to say no more of him, as if Dunsticall Husbands should be enforced upon a
relucting Brides, is huft and puffed up into a Pulpit as his Parish cross or
curse: nor is it Dick Litchfield the neat Cantibrigian Barber, whom Tom Nash so
trimmed in his Epistle against the three Harvies, but it is Dick the
Gull-Gallant, the silken sot, who though he have like a black pudding some such
excellent blood, mixed with his oatmeale and sewet, as a widow wished for, in
her matrimony, or matter of money, I mean great means to his generous or noble
birth, such Patrimony to his Parentage, as expose him not to the misery of
naked honors, with many of our Barons or bare-ones in both Clymes: yet
nevertheless he has so many wide-throated Crows about him to pluck his
silver plumes yea to prey on him (and not as on other carrions) before he be
dead, that they pluck him as bare as a birds tail, yea as naked as a Crecket,
or Baboon, as our Irish Wolves lately shore and tore our English sheep; for as
though an Elephant should stoop to catch a mouse, and an Eagle pounce a fly,
yea as though Alexander in the Olympic Games, should run or tilt with a
Peasant, not with a Prince, this most unworthy Gentleman, who never was candid
nor Gentile, has his wealth possessed, like a cowards sword, by such a dastard
and dunsticall Master, that playing at small Games ere he sit out, as if a Hawk
should keep airy with Buzzards, he consorts himself usually with Cordions and
Cobblers, Rakehells and Raveners, Oastlers and Tapsters, Raggamuffins, and
Tatergallians, Tipplers, and Tinkers, and all the Troup of trash allied to the
lash: These are delitias Domini, every one of them his vade mecum, his fidus
Achates, his alter ego, his Philadelphus, at the least his Lackeys (till he
lack) to attend him; yea his very spirits like Brutus his Ghost, which haunt
him and follow him as close as his shadow, he can no more shake them off then
Doctor Faustus his Mephistopholes: or Cardinal Crescence, and Cornelius
Agrippa their Familiars in form of black Dogs: in their deaths they cleave to
him like burres, contrary to other Horse-leaches, they will not fall off even
when they are full, they wait on him like inferior beasts, called Courtiers
and Pensioners to the Regal Lion, to feed upon his leavings, or rather upon
his livings, he feeds these Spaniels which fawn upon him, with good lappings
from the tap: then when these Stentors are as full of wine as Organ-pipes, and
Bag-pipes of wind, they proclaim his worthless worth further then the Birds
of Sapho and Hanno let out of their cages, sung the fictitious Dieties of their
feeders, as loud as those poor men whom the Duke of Savoy feasted, as his
Hounds, by which Papistically he hunted heaven, opened loud when he came
amongst them, with their God bless the Founder, (and as his Steward, replied
the confounders too;) and though these his Water-doggs like the Dogs of
Actaeon, devour this their great Master, and as Pharoahs lean kine eat up this
fat one by degrees, yea though these insatiable Gulphs swallow him quick as it
were another Codrus, down their wide weasands in some proportion, as then
Whale did Jonas; at best, though these Cornvorants and Harpies prey on him,
flocking after him like Vultures at the scent and smell of the blood of the
grape, so eating into his lands and livings by gradations, as worms into the
entralls, and Flesh-wolves into the flesh where they were bred and long fed,
that at last his best means being spunged, as the best juice out of Oringes
and Lemmans, in his purse-consumption, he grows as lank as a Greyhound, or a
shotten Herring, or as a jaded horse so over-ridden, that he is run clean out
of his girts, like one Gabriel Archer once in the Town of Maulton, or
Mault-Towne, that was so guawne by these water rats in his golden mines of
1000. a year, as once Hatto of Mentz, and Popiel of Poland by landrats in their
flesh, that though his Father was Bayliffe of Buy-land, he came by such
Catterpillers his comraiges, so to be Duke of Sell-land, and at last to be
Prince of No-land, that his best Taverns were watersprings, his Host-Duke
Humphrey, his Hostess mother Need, his lodging Beggars Inn, where many a lewd
Leutulus, a profane Esau, a profuse Prodigal has lodged both before him, and
since after him: yet nevertheless when my Gull-Gallant is amongst such
potti^ing Peasants as claw him like a Tiger, whilst he washes their mouths,
and oils their throats, placed in the midst amongst them, as the Devil
sometimes in the shape of a beast amongst Witches and Conjurers, being here the
chief figure amongst these Ciphers, the principal verb amongst these
Heteroclites, the Cock of the game amongst these Famlerts, even crowing upon
these dunghills; but chiefly the maine male Dear and Buck of the first head,
with his silver horns amongst these Rascals, where he may be Sir Jack say
all, and Sir ohn pay all, being here as Caesar wished, King and Corypheus over
these Mole-hills, rather then a subject to mountains. Oh! he is in his desired
Center, his Turk^^h heaven, his Temple, his Elizian fields, his petty Paradise:
but if it be his hard hap as he thinks, to stumble into better company, his
equals or superiors, oh then he is as melancholy as a Hare or an Owl, as
dogged as a Tymen, as Saturnall as once Brutus, as silent as a Birding Cat, or
a Turkish Mute, as much frightened as frogs with lightning and thunder, he dares
no more speak then Roscius once before Gato, he fears as much to open his
mouth as a black Bird to chatter, or Cranes to make any noise when the Hawke
sores over the one, and Eagles watch the other, as they fly over Caucasus; oh,
then he is in his real Purgatory, he had rather be turning the wheel at
Roterdam, yea Ixions wheese, or fill leaking tubs with Danaus daughters, or
roll Sisiphus his stone, or do any other Herculean task that he could
manage, then undergo the penance of conversing with any above his own Sphere,
from whom he flies further then Daphne in the Poet, from Apollo, or that young
man in the History from John the Divine, loving the company of Thieves more
then his; with his good will he comes no nearer any better then himself, then
a Serpent to an Ashtree, or to Irish ground, or then Spiders to Irish wood in
Westminsterhall, where in no case they dare come to spin any catching webs for
fat flies, though Doctor Didimus doubts it, and Scepticus does discuss it, but
I am sure he flies from all generous and ingenuous society as Moses from kis
rod turned serpent, quid piscis in arido, Monachus in Mundo, he wonders what he
should do amongst such more then a fish in the Forest, or a Monk out of his
Cell amongst seculars: and amongst such he shuts his lips as Graculus inter
Musas, unfit he should jangle amongst witty Gentlemen: so he shuts also his
purse, and binds it faster then any man a scolding tongue, to such good
behavior, that it lies quiet in his pocket and never stirrs: to get a farthing
from him, unless amongst his own froathy followers, were to get oil out of a
stone, or water out of a flint, or a penny from most Churches now in Troynovant
to relieve distressed Hibernians, though roasting us at lingering fires, or if
ought be wrung from him, as Neptunes Trident, or Jupitor^ Mace out of their
fists, for very shame not to be counted a hedger, this is as to wring the blood
out of his nose, he parts with it as willingly as with his right eyes, or what
is spent this way, he counts it misspent as oil spilt upon the ground; but
hoping that though he have fed long on Widgins, Dotterills and Woodcocks, yet
by change of diet, and a fresh air removed from the bogs of base bagages up to
the hills of holier spirits, and by a little Hellibore to cure his madness,
his badnesse, and many break-fasts of Rue mixed with thrift, he slsalt not
hereafter break fast, as he has begun. Let us reflect more briefly on a
spurious base brother of his, his Cozen Germane a Crow of a rotten egg steept
in wine Lees, or rather a hot spawne of the old Serpent the unclean spirit. And
that is

7. Drunken Laurence, ali-ass Lusty-guts.
WHose indictment to draw as favorably as I can, however when he is himself,
and has on his considering cap, he is as seemingly continent as an Hippolitus,
a Scipio, a Zenocrates, as though he fed much on Agnus, Castus, and sallets of
Lettice and Rue steeped in drink, viris Venerem minuens, (Mulieribus addens) a
great friend to Masculine ch^stity, and being unmarried, wanting wedlock waters
to cool his fires, he improves as a Votary to Minerva and the Muses the
ordinary use of ex^iccating Tobacco, and is put to his shifts of daily shifted
shirts, yea of swimming in ponds and rivers, as S. Francis tumbled himself
naked in the nettles, and S. Dominick in the snow, ad restinguendam Venerem, to
keep himself chaste by art, though not by nature; yet when he puts off his
considering cap, and puts on his barley cap, as he begins to be a friend to
Bacchus and Ceres, he shows himself no foe to Venus, (as once her Adonis:)
nay then as much as any of her Priap^^ed Friars, or such vestall Nuns her
Votaries as filled Gregory's Fish Pond with five hundred sculls of dead
Infants, or as Pope Joan who by the help of a Cardinal or carnal ^oal'd a
fair young Pope in the open street, (as the right Scarlet Whore indeed) least
the Papacy should want heir males of her body unlawfully begotten, or as
chaste as that Cardinal in England who declaimed against the marriages of
Ministers, when himself was catched in bed with a Concubine that very night:
this late Lusty Laurence, that Lancashire Lad, who had 17. bastards in one
year, if we believe his Ballad, after his Alemash and pot provender, is a
stallion that neighs after every female Filly, every Phillis or Ill-is, he is
in this hot humor, omnium horarum homo, as the Schoole-boy or Foole-boy
misconstrued it, a man for every whore, a Jack for every Gi^^ omnium mulierum
vir, as Caesar was called, prostituting his Terentia, Servillia, Po^^humia, and
other Mistresses, more then the late French Henry had; in this potting pickle:
any flesh fits his over-boyling pot, all is fish, or rather flesh that comes to
his net, from Madame to mad, he will use puddle waters to quench his fires,
rather then none, any dirty pudding serves this hot whelp of Cerberus, he
desires to devour more flesh then any Minotaure, he would not spare an
Ephigenia if she come in his way, this Cub would lick and worry also lean
lambs rather then none, no Jephtas daughter should bewail her Virginity, if
she would but bend her string to his bow, for as he waxes wild with wine, he
would seal all his obscame Letters with Virgins wax, and break up every Bride
Pie, ere it be well baked by Hymen, though it breed naught but worms within
him, and raw crudities in his drunken thirst, he is such a hot-spur, that he
would lose every Virgin Zone ere it be truly tied by Hymen, and good Sir John;
in this hot pot posture he will promise every maid marriage, and seal his
promise if he can with his own Image, though once seducing any daughter of Eve
to taste the forbidden fruit, this hot Serpent casts off the poisoned tree, this
Spaniel shakes off the water on the shore, when he has used it to catch his
desired Duck, when he has corrupted the wine, he throws by the cracked
barrel, as Politicians throw by all ladders (if not break them, if
Court-ladders for Princes) once climing to their own ends; his desires after
women increase with his wine, the fifty daughters of Danaus in one night
deflowred by Hercules, nor the one hundred Sarmatian Virgins prostituted by
Proculus in one week, nay all the women in the grand Turks Seraglio would
scarce sattisfie the desires of this flesh-monger, this Mutton-worrier: this
calfe so surfeits on change of pastures, and he is so often shaven with female
Barbers, whose waters are heated with S. Anthonies fire, that vox populi cries,
there went the hair away, so far and so fast plucked off by a French P. called
if you will a Pincer, that there is not a hair betwixt his head and heaven,
but with this he shames so little, not caring one heir for his hairs, that he
counts it his (graceless) grace to be near a kin to Romes Caesar, often called,
as a cooling card to his triumphs, Mechum calvum the bald Lecher, as also to
the French Carolus calvus and Baldus the great Civilian. But I leave this
Junior Heliogabalus or Sardanapalus, or pale-asse in praesenti tobe more wise
in futuro, when the burnt child has so often felt the feared fire, otherwise
unless he mend his ways, should I survive him, I would write on him this
Epitaph, This mad young colt deserves a Martyrs praise,
For he was burned in Queen Mary's days,
The fuel to this fire, (oh, who would think it!)
In his own belly burned when he did drink it.


But as I have no Genius for a Poet, I would not for a world the world should
know it, so I turn my Prose in the next place to a Poet indeed, a doughty Poet
in his drink,

8. Drunken Don Quixo^, ali-ass Wittypoll.
OF a sudden by the fumes of Bacchus a mushrump Poet, (as a Plebeian Enthusiast
in a trice by a Revelation dropped out of the clouds, or like a Pallas
(pale-asse) borne out of a fictitious Jupiters brain, in his own conceit or
deceit, is a Mushrump Preacher,) with his est Deus in nob is agitante
calescimus illo, Moses and Aaron yield to us our fires, Promethians be our
Spirits, heaven inspires, but to send your eyes after this Sir Ferdinando Fash,
this Furor Poeticus, however when he is himself mere man, and no more, his
Genius is obtuse, and dull and heavy, as a great headed Ox that needs the
Goad, or as a Smith-field jade that needs the spur, yet heated with such
waters, as are extracted by fires from Limbecks of coldest Simples, he is
presently in excelsis, he is hoisted up as a squib into the air, with such
cracks and flashes as would terrify all the Buzzards that flock about him, and
all the Ducks and Ganders that swattle with him in the same puddles or fuddles,
Icarus, Dedalus, Simon Magus, our English King Blad^d never soared higher by
Magical or Artificial wings, then he by the sufflations of grinded and
powdered Barley, hotter in his brains to blow up his inventions, then any
Saltpeter to blow up a Parliament House into the air, for sympathizing with
his Predecessors Tom Nash, George Peale, Kit Marlow, John Green, old Elderton,
Churchard (buried with Alectoes torch in the Church Porch) fantastique Fenner,
and the rest of the pottizing Poetizing fraternity: he never is so good a
Poetaster, as when a pot-taster, when he is as giddy with drink, as a
Midsummers Goose, then he swaggers more valiantly with a Goose-quill, then any
Cline^s or Damatas from the Bodkin to the pike upward, then he marches through
any man's guts as it were with Gunpowdertermes, his pen pricks sharper then a
Porcupines, his ink is as strong as his drink, it peirceth into a man's brains,
in jerking Iambicks and pricking Satyrs, sharper then the bristles of a
Hedge-hogg, it were able to make another Hipponax go hang himself. Oh, how he
then ^ents Sesquipedalian words, how his ^e^mes are stronger then Aquafortis
that eats into steel, how he speaks lapldes and Fulmina, squibs and fireworks,
how his wits sparkle like salt in the fire, he casts them amongst his
Comraiges, as one Maples in Cambdens Britania said, he was cast amongst
Courtiers, as salt amongst fresh Eels, to ma^e them frisk, and dance without a
piper: of all Heresies now revived extremo ab orco, as from the lowest held,
which ^ow pester the Church, as Locusts from the bottomless pit, as he hates
most the Heresy of the Aquarii, or waterdrinkers, so he is very glad that it
is not set abroach now amongst the rest; he holds this Axiom above any Article
in the Nicene or Apostolic Greed, that nulla, scribuntur, Carmina aquae
potoribus, that as good verses come from Rural Skinkers, as from our
Hydro-Poets, water drinkers, and he is verily persuaded that however Tailour
row in the water, yet when he shaped his best Poetical shreds, his Muse drunk
wine out of the old bottells of the Tower: in brief, lapping out of old Homers
basin, that Vinum Cos. which Homer drunk, though he do not as exactly as
Virgil imitate Homer, nor as our Chaucer and Spencer Virgil, yet as Anguitur
vini vinosus Homerus, as Homers raptures smell of wine, so do his Rapsodies
with old Ennius nunquam nisi potus ad arma, he never poetizeth so vigorously,
as when he poetizeth with his tippling tools, then secundi and foecundi calices
fecere desertum, he quaffes elocution out of full cups pleno cornu, every Can
is his Cornucopia, post sumptum vinum loquitur sun lingua Latinum, he with his
wine sips wits and words so strong as fill him fluent with his Latin Tongue,
his pinta Mayor, and pinta Minor, this pot and that pint makes him more fluent
then Hector pinta upon Esa: these are to him for words and phrases more then
either Couper or Minshaw, or Calepine, or Holyoake or Rider, or Thomas Thom-ass
or any other Dictionaries: if he be to hammer out any wordy work indeed, he
never stands musing on the matter, with his Pierides Musae, nor does invocate
his great Pan, a great Can, out of which he steals a hearty draught, elevates
his soring raptures as high as Parnassus, his Helicon is only to Hell-it-on, as
we say in Yorkshire, and power in spirited liquor which will cause him power
out spirited lines; but at last leaveing this Junior Randoll; Pupil to
Aristippus to read his red Latice Lectures, I take a Synopsis with a little
more brevity on

9. Drunken Spermologous.
A Bird of the same feather, a word-minter, a Coriatized Odcomb, a mere verbal
Windy-bags, above any mountbank, Emperick, or Albumazar, a coiner of fustian
phrases in Bacchus his forge, in such proud pitied and derided follies,
straining to be eloquent, as the fabled Frog swelled to be an Ox, in his
Inkcornisme Rombismies; Gallymawfreyes, and Omnigetherums, of English and
Latin, and some shreds of French too, and in his Gibberish in Welsh and
Cornish, which he would have to go for Greek, mixed also together in such a
drunken hotchpotch of affected rope Rhetoric, as makes him as ridiculous as a
jangling Jay, or prating Parrot, which talks at random she knows not, nor she
cares not what; all his discourse, as too course for any judicious and solid
ear, being held only to keep a fitting Symetry with Sir Simon Simple, and Sir
Gregory Nonsense, such companions as most of our zeale-drunk Plebeians take
with them up into most of our usurped Pulpits, which they leave as foully
polluted with ignorance and arrogance, as Foxes, Fowmarts, Weasells and
Poulcats leave ill smells behind them where ever they come: but having enough
of this Windybaggs, permitting him to fly with the wings of his wits,
fantastically feathered, as an Ole in an evening, I make as bold as welcome, to
descant a brother of his,

10. Drunken Phylautus,
WHo double drunk with self-conceit, as well as wine, he is no sooner a note
above Ela in his maultified mental music, but then especially, he conceits
all his Geese to be Swans, his Capons Cocks, his Goats Sheep, his Rats Rabbits,
and his Glowworms blazing Stars; and that he, and not that whilom fantastike
Parsons, nor yet old Oberon is King of the Fayries, or faire-eyes, the great
Duke of Eutopia, and the grand Seignior of all that Land, within the Orb of the
Moon, which the Author of the Lunatic Moon-book Mathematically and
Supposititiously describes unto us: I must confess, when I observe the strange
humors and conceits of his out-weaned worthless self, which the Devil and
drink infuseth into this proud drunken fool, and note all the addle idle eggs
which Bacchus has in his brain, I less marvel, that a poor, silly, simple,
vulgar, Mechanic Idiot drunk with mere blind and bewitching zeal, and
self-conceit of his supposititious and imaginary gifts, should conceit
himself to be as legal, as able, as gifted as called a Preacher, as any of
the Sons of the Prophets, on whom God has redoubled, as the spirit of Elias on
Elisha, the spirit of preaching, and whom the Church has called to the
Function of a Pastor. But being as much ashamed, that Doctor Carter, Carrier,
Currier, Brewer, Dunce, and Dulman, should presume to equallize Doctor Worth,
Wisdom, and Discretion, as that Cumanus his Ass should jet it in a Lions
skin, or that any Midas should as an emblame of a sottish Auditor, prefer
Pans harsh poor pipe, before Apolloes melodious Harp: I sound retreat to
stand, and observe another strange Bacchanalian,

11. Drunken Sip-Sobrius.
A Strange Hermaphrodite, who in one hour changes from drunk to sober, as a
Raven in few days changes from white to black in her hatching nest, and as a
Hare and Hiena are said in one year to change from male to female, and as
Camerarius in his Historicalls, Goulart and Wolfius in their Admiranda,
instance in many changing Sexes, from men to women, as the witches in Livonia
in the months of June and July, are said to change from women into wolves: so
this Sip-Sobrius, as though rope-maker-like he went backward and forward, as
some men and women with their words and works, he is in a very trice both drunk
and sober: what operation the diversified music of Timotheus had to cause
Alexander first to put on his Armor to fight as a Lion, then to calm him as
mild as a Dove, or to turn him to a sad melancholy, and then by other strains
to be joviall, me thinks the same work has drink in this Camelionized
metamorphosed Maultworme, Peernizing him from drunk to sober, sooner then all
solid preaching and powerful oratorious perswafions can work upon the
intoxicated brains of a mad Plebeian Enthusiast, to turn him from a
zeale-drunk self-conceited Teacher, to his own former garb of a sober
Tradesman, which being almost as impossible as to conjure down a Devil into
hell, his old Center, or to gather the dispersed winds into Aeolus his bag
again: I leave him, and being bold to strain courtesy with the Clergy as
well as the Laity, I make up my Brown Dozen with

12. Drunken Clericus, or Simplicius.
THe Country Vicar, who to his meat must have liquor, as well as others, even
as often as a Lemman to his fauce, as Mr. Howard told Queen Mary when she took
away wines from the Clergy, yea though many call him Sir John Lack Latin, yet
with his good will this Senior Immerito, will not lack liquids; in which
humor, pace tanti viri, I have often seen I must confess, even learned
Latinizing Beuclark himself, and sometimes Ingenioso, a Master of Arts, as
well as Tripes the prevaricating Sophister, or Aristippized Randoll, or Junior,
and Senior vix Sanior Bachalaurius, Baculo, non Lauro dignus, with many
fellows as right good fellows in Colleges, as Noah was a good Lawyer, Butler
a good Physician, and Paracelsus a good Chimist: and although that Carp-fish
that Aristarchus or stark-ass, that Tymonist, that Misanthropist, yea that
dogged Cynick, if not formal Pharisee, that Samet more precise then wise
brainsick Zealist, who will not only friske away from the best gifted
Preacher, as a young Heifer with a tick on her tail, out of a fresh pasture,
leaping over hedges, or as a wild Dear or Rascal trips over the mountains at
chop of a Beagle, but will shoot his fools bolts at him, that he is a friend
to Publicans or Sinners, if he see him but (semel in anno ridens Apolle) raro
aut nunquam, now and then in an Inn or Tavern, though perhaps upon as lawful
an occasion as the Spies had who lodged in Rahabs Inn in Jerico, or as Josoph
had when he took up his lodging in Bethlem: I say such a critical or
hypocritical censor, had need to have either his brains took out and washed
with salt and sage, or his inwards purged from the over-flowings of gall and
swellings of the spleen: yet nevertheless as I would have all of Levies Tribe
to steer from the rocks of the least offense, because a little mote is seen in
their eyes, a little mire on their coat, and that which is drunkenness (says
a Father) in others, is sacrilege in them; so for my part, sepe bilem, vestri
movere tumultus, it often stirs up my passion, as well as compassion, to see so
many excellent good parts, pains, graces, and wits not only washed, but as once
Noah's for a time drowned in drink, at least soiled as Pearls in a quagmire; as
they tax the finnes of others, so the observing vulgars taxing some of them,
not for legal using, but too much abusing both Bacchus Tobacco, and all strong
liquids in their quiffs and their quasss, that they often drink till there be no
wine in their pots, wits in their pates, nor wealth in their purses, in most
Climes, some ecclipsing and clonding all the best of their shining gifts by the
interposition of a lunatic watery Plannet, many more commonly then commendably
taking their liquors till their liquors take them, as the Lobster caught the
Cat, when the Cat thought to catch the Lobster, and as the Wasp caught the
Welsh-man by the nose, when her thought to eatch the Wasp by the laps of her
yellow Jerkin: carousing as freely all sorts of strong liquids, whether Derby
Ale, or Nantwich Whiskings, or Bristow Beer, or Glocestershire Sydar, or
Worcestershire Perry, or Welsh Mead and Metheglin, or French Claret, or
Germane Rennish, or sweet Muscadine, and Malmsie, or Spanish Sack well mixed
with sugar, as zeal with discretion, all quaft as freely as the Turks their
Cossa, the Graecians their Falern, and Vinum Cos, the Irish their Aqua vitae,
and Vsque bangh, or the Jesuits in Paris their vinum Sorbonicum and
Jesuiticum; I resolve to tell you the truth, (as giving you thirteen to the
Dozen) to Anatomize

13. Drunken Tom Tell-troath.
TO give you the full or fool of him, he is one that either never read or
never understood nor regarded Alberius magnus, that great All-beard, nor
Wickerus, nor Baptista Porta, nor Levinus Lemnius de secretis, nor Cardan de
occultis, nor any writings of hid things and secrets, which he no more heeds
nor observes to keep, then most in this false and sickle age, heed or keep
faith, truth, honesty, justice, credit or conscience, which most of them are
fled to heaven to complain of their want of entertainment upon earth. Of all
others he is unfit to be a Secretary as a woman, who for the most part writes
Roman hand, few of that sex Secretary; eversince Fulvia bewrayed the secrets
of Cataline, Martia of Comodus, Dalilah of Sampson, or Fabia of her husband
Fabius, concerning that which Augustus revealed to him of adopting Tyberius to
be his successor in the Empire, what ever he knows must out at one hole or
other: were I a King, and he as familiar with me, as Schoogan with the French
King, I would make him of my privy, rather then of my counsel, least he kept
it no better then a sive or a riddle keeps water: what I would have known or
divugled, I would tell him, he would vent it sooner in his cups, then if I told
it in a Barbers shop, a Milne, a Market, a Schoole-house, amongst boys, a
Bake-house amongst wenches, or at a Gooseups feast, only commending one good
thing in him, (as once one just act in Cambises) I leave him, and that is, that
he never lets any secrets rot in his mouth, (as a Roman once Apologized) to
cause him to have a stinking breath. But least we hunt him and his fellows out
of breath, for their being foxt like Foxes till they stink again, giving them a
breathing time to repent, and to weep, if it be but drunken tears in their
Dog-sick vomits, we reprieve them till the next Sessions, where more of their
fellows, God willing, shall be arraigned with them at Bacchus his Bar: and
as we find some dozen and a half more of them guilty, after whipping and
stripping, they shall have a shipping into Drunkallia, or the Isle of Gulls,
for their too bold and base abusing of Sir John Barley corn, and M. Malt his
bearded son, and M. Barly-broth, his brainelesse daughter, as in a manner
unworthy, till they mend their manners, to stay or stagger any longer in the
Isle of Man.

FINIS.
