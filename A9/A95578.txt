RELIGIONS ENEMIES. WITH A BRIEF AND INGENIOUS Relation, as by Anabaptists,
Brownists, Papists, Familists, Atheists, and Foolists, sawcily presuming to
toss Religion in a Blanquet.

RELIGIONS ENEMIES.
WHEREIN IS DESCRIBED ALL their diverse and erroneous opinions against the
truth of the Gospel.
TO begin to some purpose in prose, because nothing to any purpose either in
Verse, poetry, Rhyme, or reason is for their stomachs, nor are they much
affected with good prose (for as the Tree is known by the fruit it bears, so
they may be perceived of what spirit they are by their speech and writings, and
daily libelling. And to the end that I may rather prove my self a just
reprehender of their follies, then an impudent rayler at their fooling and
saucy ignorance, (which in plain terms is no better then malice and
madness) I am induced to mix that which is material, true, and serious, with
some things that may seem harsh, tart, and distasteful to the pallats of these
curious furious lavish Libellers, and pestiferous platformers: Indeed they do
pretend fair colors for their soul intentions, strong proofs for their
weak Assertions and scandalous Aspertions, their talk being reformation,
rectifying, mundifying, clarifying of the Church, and nothing is in their
mouths or pens but railing and reviling against our Church of England, the
Book of Common prayer, preaching, Sacraments, Ceremonies, Rites, Orders,
Government and Governors; for Governors and Government was instituted by the
Patriarchs before the Law, by Moses, the prophets and priests under the Law, by
our Savior Christ Jesus and his Apostles and successors, since the time of
the Gospel, established, confirmed, and ratified by Scriptures, General
Counsels, Ancient Fathers, Ecclesiastical Canons, Martyrs and Confessors, by
Acts of Parliament ordained and decreed, and by all the aforesaid Authorities
continually used and daily practiced within the Church of Christ Catholic,
Apostolic and Militant over the face of the Earth, and received into this
Kingdom when Lucius was King here, and Flentherius was then Bishop of Rome,
who was the thirteenth Bishop of that See, Anno 179. so that the Institution
and pract^se of our Church and religion has continued amongst us near 1500.
years, except when It was eclipsed by popery, even from the near time of the
death of some of the Apostles or their next successors: For Saint Jerome says
that Saint John the Apostle and Evangelist did live 68 years after our
Saviors passion, and that he dyed in the year of Christ 101. and that he
outlived Saint Paul, and Saint Peter, whom some improbable Authors say was the
first Bishop or Pope of Rome; also that he survived Linus, Amatletus; and to
the ninth year of Clement, the first bishop of Rome of that name, so that by
computation of time, Saint John could be no less then 120. years of age when
he dyed; so that our Church and Church Government is no Innovation or noveltie,
as these late licentious Libellers have maliciously belyed her.

But indeed it is no Innovation or Novelty, for the Church of God and the only
Spouse of his only beloved Son Christ I sus to be despised, dispersed,
persecuted, hated, scorned, jeered contemned, derided, and traduced, for it
has been, is, and will be ever the marks and tokens of the true Church to be
known from Heathens, Infidels, pagans, Atheists, Mahometans Heretics,
Hypocrites, Schismatics and Sectaries, with the whose rabble of the Kingdoms
of Satan and Antichrist, for since the beginning the Devil has been busy to
entrap and destroy her.

By the word Church I do mean all the faithful people of God that have ever
been created, or that are to be to the end of the world, of what Nation,
condition, or sex soever they be, if they make a conscience, to be obedient to
Gods Laws, and with gladness embrace the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in whose faith
if they live here, they are (in Grace) his Church militant here, and dying in
Gods favor they are, that are so departed, and shall be in glory his Church
Triumphant hereafter eternal.

This Church has many times bin so overwhelmed with afflictions, tribulations
and persecutions, that she seemed to be quite sunk, or sinking as S. Peter was
when he walked on the Sea, Mat. 14.31. then God in mercy has still held forth
his gracious hand of power, providence, protection and preservation, has still
supported, held her up, strenthned, comforted and delivered her, so that in
dispight of the raging of Tyrants, the rigor of torments, the storms and
tempests of persecution, she has still resplendently broken through and
dispersed all the obscure clouds of the Devils malice, so that the gates of Hell
has never prevailed against her.

This Church was, by the subtilty of the Devil, assaulted in paradise in the
persons of our first Parents; This Church was persecuted by Cain when he
murdered his righteous brother Abel; this Church was opposed and rebelliously
murmured against by Corah, Da^han, Abiram, and their accomplices; this Church
that was prefigured by the Arc of Noah that swom and floated when all the
world else was drowned, and none were saved that were not in it, which Arc,
maugre all storms and tempests, was preserved and rested on the mountain
Ararat, which was a Type that the true Church does rest upon the most High:
this Church was also fore-shewed by the Bush that burned with fire, and was not
consumed, which prefigured her preservation: and this Church was and is as the
seamles coat of Christ not to be divided, this is that Church which these
factius men would sink, burn, and rend in pieces, they being more merciles then
the raging waters, their blind zeal more hot then the violent flaming fire,
and their manners and civility far less then the barbarous soldiers.

The Arrians, Anabaptists, Brownists, Donatists; Erticheans, Familists,
Marcianists, Montanists, Nicholaitans. Pelagians, Papists, Puritans, Nonatians,
and all other sorts of Heresies and Sects do stiffely hold and maintain to
their uttermost power that every one (in his own opinion) in each of their
Sects are the true Church, and under the colors of a feigned piety they are
all in violent opposition against each other, in a disunion and diversity among
themselves, and all in a general malignant inveterate hatred against the
Government, the Governors, and of the true Church indeed.

God has ordained certain Orders, Degrees or Functions of men in this
Kingdom for the defense, guard, guide, preservation and salvation of mankind;
the first is Kings, Princes, Potentates and Peers (or Nobility, whose wisdom
and power may and have made Laws and Statutes agreeable to Gods Word, the
spring and Fountain of which Laws are derived from the Law of God: secondly,
under Kings and Rulers) there are the most right Reverend Fathers the Clergy
for the Churches Government, and for the directing and guiding of the wandering
and straying Flock of Christ, whose Learning, wisdom, gravity, painful life
and example may draw souls unto God. And whose Office and Authority which they
have from and under the King (as from Gods Lieutenant) is such that they by
imposition of hands always have done and do (as occasion requires) ordain
Ministers for the Church, for the preaching of the Word to the people, for
prayer for them, and for the true and due administration of the Sacraments to
them; and also by their power to maintain Order and Decency in the
Congregation, and in their Jurisdictions and charge to admonish, reprehend, and
excommunicate all obstinate and erroneous offenders, and (in fine) advance the
Word of God, and make it propagate, and to trample on, tread down, and
suppress all Heresies, sects, schisms, and needless and impertinent
innovations, that might any way disturb the peace of the Church.

Thirdly, the Physician is to be honored, because he is Gods Instrument for
the health and preservation of the body, but as much as the soul (which is
immortal) is in value above the body, which is frail, transitory, and
mortal, so far is the holy Function of a sincere and painful Divine, (who is
a physician for the soul) to be preferred before any Physician for the Body.

And fourthly, the Lawyer is to be reverenced and esteemed for he is (or should
be) the rule, square, guide, and rectifier of all our temporal Actions, a
righter of wrong, a true and impartial Decider and Judger of all matters of
debate and controversies amongst men, concerning our houses, lands, debts,
touching estate or loss of limb or life, and all these are comprised under
the title of the goods of Fortune; in which, were not the Lawyer expert, the
Law it self is but a dead letter, and of no Force or Virtue: Now, as much as
goods and all outward means, which are called the goods of Fortune, because
they are uncertain, here to day and gone to morrow, are short of the
estimation of bodily life and health, so much is the Lawyer below the Physician
in use or estimation.

But men being constant in nothing but in wavering inconstancy, do in a
perverse and preposterous manner begin at the wrong end, and as they do make
more account of body, goods and Fame, then they do either of their souls or
everlasting happiness, so much they esteem the Physician and the Lawyer above
the Divine; I confess them all to be as worthy of Honor as they are endued
with Honesty, and each of them to be held in as much regard and Reverence as
their pains and studies shall merit for their true service to God and man;
yet, with Mary, I humbly desire to make choice of the better part which shall
not be taken from me, Luke 10. and 41.42.

In the mean space, (amongst mutable and contentious spirits) Religion is made
a Hotch porch, and as ir were tossed in a Blanquet, and too many places of
England too much Amsterdamnified by several opinions; Religion is now become
the common discourse and Table-talke in every Tavern and Alehouse, where a
man shall hardly find five together in one mind, and yet every one presumes
he is in the right. The Book of Common prayer which was established by Act of
Parliament by that good and godly King Edward the sixth, and after
re-established by another Parliament, by that unparaleld and peerlesse
princess Queen Elizabeth, and continned since in the happy Reigns of two
gracious Kings in the Church of England for the service of God these ninety
years; yet one would have it to be cast out now, holding it a false worship;
another is angry at the vestments and habits of the Ministry; one will not
kneel, another will not stand, one will sit down, one will not bow, another
will not be uncovered, one holds all good manners to be popery, another that
all decency is superstitious, another that railes are Romish (which is false,
for the papists have no railes in their Churches, nor any thing so convenient:
One foolishly assumes and presumes to save himself, and some of his Neighbors
too, by his good works; another will be saved by a bare and lazy Faith that
will do no work at all, and thus religion is puffed and blown to and fro with
every wind of doctrine, and as it were tossed in a Blanquet; but of this more
largely hereafter in another part which will suddenly be printed, till when and
ever it shall be my hearty prayers, that as there is but one Shepherd, that
God in his gracious goodness and mercy would make us all one sheep f^ld.

FINIS.
