Capellus Virbius, SIVE REDIVIVUS: OR, A MONUMENT Erected in Several ELEGIES
To the Memory of the Right Honorable and Noble Arthur Lord Capell, Baron of
Hadham.

And His Excellent Lady, the Lady Elizabeth Capell Dowager.

LONDON Printed by Roger Vaughan, dwelling in St. Martins le Grand, 1662.

To the Right Honorable Arthur Earl of Essex, Baron of Hadham; AND Sir Henry
Capell Knight of the Bath, Sons to the ever-honoured Arthur Lord Capell.
Most Excellent Brothers,
THough it be Unlawful to offer up Sacrifices to the Dead, yet license me to
sacrifice these Elegies to the Remembrance of your ever-Honoured, and
never-to-be forgotten Parents, and permit me to make the Name of CAPELL an
Altar, though not the Tomb. I must confess, had not the Importunity of
Friends, concentered in a numerous Address, and the particular Obligations by
which my Service is entitled to your Family, engaged me to devote these narrow
Testimonies of my Zeal to the Scrutiny and Inspection of the Public, they had
been for ever folded up in their own Oblivion.

Least therefore I might seem Ungrateful, or at least Unfruitful, I have
adventured to drop this Earnest of my Affection on these Noble Relics, not
hoping by this to add any perpetuity to those, which will in future Ages, stand
both Brass to the Tomb, and Marble to the Stone, but only as a Symboll of that
Acknowledgement I owe to two Names of such an Eternal Duration.

Indeed I never did believe that these Poems could contract an estimate from
any intrinsique Value resident in themselves, but only as they were offered up
at the Tombs of those Worthy Persons, to whose Memory they were Originally
Consecrated.

Suffer then these Monuments of a Zealous Gratitude to give themselves up to
your view, since you may be ascertained, that they issue from one whose Study
it is, that his Practice may be how he may declare himself

The Humblest of your Servants, Thomas Philipot.

Capellus Virbius, SIVE REDIVIVUS: OR, A Monument erected in several ELEGIES To
the Memory of the Right Honorable and Noble Arthur Lord Capell, Baron of
Hadham.
AN ELEGY.
AS when the (...) ^gilt with its borrowed Fires,
And tinsell'd over with the Suns light expires,
Dialls then only when the Day is done
Declare their use, and show there was a Sun:
So now that Flame which did in Capell burn
Is, like some Meteor, shrunk into his Urne.
This cheap and narrow Tribute of my Verse,
Which I have dared to fasten on his Hearse,
May like some Dyal, now his Light is set,
Stand to his Name a fixed Alphabet.
And since his Thread which was so firmly spun;
Is by rude Hands unravelled, and undone;
In me if any Vigor seem to dawn,
It Is but by him a Faint Resemblance drawn;
And if in Me the Pulse of Phansy beat,
With any Masculine or active Heat,
It Is but a Beam shot from that nobler Fire,
Which did his Breast at once warm and inspire.
Unrip the Quarries then, and reconcile
Marble, Jet, Brass, and Jasper in one Pile,
And fix the Gaudy and Magnifique Stone,
Upon the Dust and Rottenness of one,
Whose Name perchance will moulder and consume
Amidst his Nard, Balm, Spicery and Perfume.
Brave Capells Tombe's beyond the Reach of Art,
His Monument's Established in each Heart,
When he shall stand from Times Impression safe
Unto himself Both Urne and Epitaph.
Let Scholars here and Soldiers both combine,
And mix in a full Quire about his Shrine,
Since both in him did vigorously unite,
The Scholar, did advise, the Soldier fight:
So that of Him it might be truly said,
He had an Heart, yet did not want an Head,
For both in Him appeared so close Compact,
His Head consulted, ere his Heart did act;
His Epitaph first by his Sword was made,
Enrolled in Characters that hardly fade;
Insculp'd in every Hospital it stands,
Writ in disbanded Legs, or banished Hands,
Then 'twas rescrib'd and copied out again,
And written something fairer by (...) Pen;
For in his Monuments of His printed Meditations.
Brain we see
H'as reared to himself both Tomb and Elegy,
Which to such comely shape and frame are brought,
And yet with such a Marble Phansy wrought,
That in these Trophies he shall live as long,
As Time shall weild a Sith, or Fame a Tongue.
Obsequies offered up to the Memory of the ever Renowned, and never to be
Forgotten, ARTHUR Lord CAPELL. Written 1649.
DO; paddle still in Blood, for it is not strange
Now if your thirsty dropsi'd Blades do range
Over the whole stock of Man; or that they spread
To Trunck and Boughs, since they have lop't off the Head:
For since the KING, who like one general Soul,
Did through each nerv and agile muscle roll;
And like some public Conduit did dispense
To every Vein, both Sap and Influence;
Shine's in His Crown of Martyrdom above,
Gilt and enameled with the Beams of Love;
The Cement thus unfix't and slack't, we must
Needs languish into shuffled heaps of Dust:
And as in Bodies, where the Head is lop't
From off the weeping Stem, some Spirits dropped
From that great Magazine, into each part,
And left as Legacies unto the Heart;
Contract the Joints and Hands, then make them spread
As if they caught at the dislodging Head;
So after this vast Ruin, though the Frame
Of Nature were both discomposed and lame;
Yet in this crippled Structure, there might be
Some starts and leaps, which flowed (brave Lord!) from Thee;
On whom, as some not yet discovered Sours,
Which does to th'suppled Earth fresh Sap disburs,
And through her veins melt's in a purling rill,
The expiring KING His Vigor did distill.
And as some sullen Vapor which was spun
From the Earth's course Wardrobe, by the glaring Sun,
To some wild Meteor, hover's in the Air,
And on each Cloud shed's its unravel'd hair;
But wanting Active Heat to waft it higher,
Does in dull Slime and sluggish Mists exspire:
So before CAPELL was (like the early Flower
Which Ruder Hands tore from the Mangled Bower)
Rent from His Bleeding stalk, we might perchance,
Like vapors winged with His brave heat, advance
Above the Common-level, yet but now
His Flames shot-up no new supply t*allow.
We crumble shall to Ruin straight, and run
Into a wild Precipitation.
And as when Morning from the Azure Towers,
Powr's out the day, and pluck's out the unfledged hours;
The Earth unlock's its womb, each flower unweav's
Its Odorous tresses, and untie's its leaves,
That so they may be spangled by that blaze
That from the blooming Sun's gilt luster stray's;
So now that He like a new-budded Star
That stud's the Orb's above, does from a far
Point out his Beams to us, let their clear Light
Steer us through the perplexed maze of Night;
And our benumbed and frozen Souls so thaw,
He may both our Example be and Law;
For though that Man's a world within himself;
In Him no Passion swelled into a Shelf
To split His even thoughts, no Rock of Pride
Did intercept or justle the free Tide
Of well-poiz'd Actions, and no Mountain there
Was by Ambition made, or Gulf by Fear.
His beauteous Actions too without did meet,
Still in such comely and well-ballanc't feet,
And were so fairly knit, you would think they would been
Each one the Transcript of His Soul within;
No Byas His Religion warp't awry
Into a crooked Excentricity,
'Twas sullied with no Ends; He could not tell
How to vamp Calvin with dark Machiavel.
No Widows cooler sighs did fan His Cup,
He drank in's Wine no Tears of Orphans up;
His Pregnant Fields were moist'ned by the Skies,
Not wet with showers rained from His Tenants eyes;
And having thus with Virtue paved the Track
Which to His Urn did guide His Footsteps back;
He, when His full-fledg'd Soul cast off her Clay,
To bathe in Tides of never-ebbing day,
Did in so soft a Calm dismiss His Breath,
As if it were His Espousals, not His Death;
And that in His cold shroud He were to meet
The Pourtraict only of His Genial sheet,
AN ELEGY ON The Great Exemplar of all Virtue, the Lady Elizabeth Capell.
WE can for every cheap and trivial Loss
Condole so much, we even seem to Ingross
The Public Stock of Grief, and at our Eyes
Embezel our exhausted Faculties,
Whilst our dull Passions pant with eager Throes,
As if they teemed with Mountains of vast Woes,
Each Maime by Fire, each Shripwrack can induce
Our Eyes to such Intemp'rate and profuse
Resentment, that those Cataracts of Rain
Our Eyes un-sluce, might quench the Flame again;
Or in the^ brin^ Deluges once more,
Ingulph the Ruined Bark upon the Shore;
But when such precious Earth as this, we see
To crumble into early Ashes, we
Should from the officious Limbecks of our Eyes
Distill, as Rights paid to her Obsequies,
Such Floods of Pious Tears, that if dull Art
Should by some Lame Neglect forget to impart
Her Nard, and unctuous Balsome, to exempt
These Noble Relics from Time's rude contempt,
They might embalm her fading Mass of Clay,
And fortify it so from all Decay,
No saucy or intruding worm should dare
To be an Inmate to her Sepulcher.
Then let the Sluices of our Eyes un-lave
Streams of un-summon'd Tears out on her Grave,
Which by that Cold our chiller Sighs shall vent
Shall stiffen to a Crystal Monument,
And stand a fixed Index to her Dust,
To tell the World this Tomb is put in Trust,
Virtue it self in its cold Cell to hide,
Which in this Lady lived, and with her died;
But when the World, and its gay Pomp expire,
And both lie gasping in the general Fire,
When all the Throng of petty Stars like Tears,
Shall drop in flaming Gelly from their Spears,
And Sol it self, Light's great Exchequer, shall
From its dark Orb like a blind Cindar fall,
When the Impenitent Earth so long shall burn
Till it into Repentant Ashes turn,
And each conspicuous Ornament it wears
Shrinks into Dust, this shall resolve to Tears.
Her EPITAPH.
HAve you beheld the Sun un-shroud,
The enameled Fringes of a Cloud,
Then wrap up in the Folds of Night
All that embroyderie of Light,
As if by that Recesse he meant
The ancient Chaos to prevent?
So from this Ladies twins of Sight
Such Beams did dawn, that with their Light
They did each sullen Mist dispell,
Which did in our Horizon dwell,
But now those radiant Suns are set,
And in the gloomy Cabinet
Of her dark Urne locked up, the World,
Into one Common Cloud is hurled.
The Phoenix in her Pile of Spice,
Perhaps may vie with Paradise,
And Roses tortured in a Still,
In that warm Agony a Rill
So sweet disburse, it does overcome
Nard in its bruised Martyrdom;
This Ladies virtues do disperse
Such choice Perfumes about her Hearse,
That should we those by these esteem,
They'ld cheap, and sickly Odours seem;
They that all cunning Pomp do scan
By the Louvre, or the Vatican,
Let them unlock her Marble shrine,
And they will trace out a various Mine,
There lodge the Diamonds of her Eyes,
Which Rays so pointed did comprize:
Gulcundah and Socodania in the East Indies are the places whence the choycest
Diamonds are extracted.
Gulcundah's Quarries can display
No beams that scatter such a Day,
There lie wrapped up in an Eclipse
Of Dust, the Rubies of her Lips,
Nay this Exchequer too contains
The melting Saphirs of her veins,
So that we now may justly call
Her urne the best Escuriall;
Since then she is dead whose fragrant breath,
Did to the Fields new Flowers bequeath,
Let Us cull them all that they may meet
On her, that she may make them sweet;
However on her Dust we will strew
Those Flowers which seemed on her to grow,
As on their Stem; First, there shall be
The Rose of Blushing Modesty,
Which did so long her Check adorn,
Offered up unto her urne:
The Marigold shall then become
The Second tribute to her Tomb,
Within which flower we may descry
The Image of her Piety;
For this locks up its leaves when Night,
In its black Mantle, folds up Light,
And still unclasps them when the Sun
Bespangles all our Horizon:
So she, when first The Infant Day,
The Eastern Portalls did Array
With the Attire of Light, did run
To open her Devotion;
And when Darkness clothed the Air,
Clasped it up in Holy Prayer:
Then the Violet we will shed
Upon her Hearse, which bows its Head,
And, like her, appears to be
The Emblem of Humility;
Next, we will to her Dust dispense
The Lilly white with Innocence,
Where we, as in a Glass, may see
The transcript of her Purity,
Whose Odours will perfume her Name,
And so embalme her quickened Fame,
Her Marble, like the hallowed Shrine
That does dead Virtues self confine
Within its hollow Womb, shall be
Adored by all Posterity.
FINIS.
