OXFORD, Printed in the Year. 1652.

To his Excellency The Lord General CROMWELL.
MY LORD,
IT is hoped, Your Excellency may pardon this boldness, upon the
consideration, That this poor mite offered in zeal, may longer bear Your
superscription, then choicer pieces cast into the Treasury of Your desert, by
greater and more popular pens: However his Election cannot be blamed, that
seeks shelter under that Tree of Honor, which, during the storms of so many
contrary Factions, has not only shadowed all formerly owned by Antiquity, but
may chill the hands of Posterity with despair, of ever being able to match Your
Actions hereafter. For those most celebrated for their Valor and Conduct, did
but gleane repute amongst the thorns of contrary and doubtful Successes;
Whereas You, being the true Master of the Harvest of Honor, never were known
to return without bringing Your sheaves with You; Which may be the less
wondered at by those who observe how just an Accomptant You are to Your alone
Captain, the Lord of Hosts, in summing Your Bills of Victory to his glory, not
Your own; Who has now not only suffered You to build, but to shut the Gates
of the Temple of War; And will no doubt inspire you with a pattern for that
of Peace; so that as you have begun with Joshua, you may end with Solomon:
Jethro has long since laid the platform how to make a people happy. And it
were presumption to offer to prescribe farther unto Master Builders; Yet in
particular for Oxford, of which Providence has made you Chancellor, may it be
spoken without offense, That the University, however represented, retains no
surfeit of Obstinacy or Riches; Your Reformation being as suitable to her
desires, as Your Protection: if Your wisdom apprehend a superfluity in one
place, the next glance may possibly discover hundreds that want it: Her
misfortune is, to be looked upon as having labored so long of a Malignant
Fever, that she is run past recovery in the books of prejudice, having
nothing to redeem her from ruin, but Your pity and power; if You would be
pleased to take Her into Your more peculiar Protection* and not suffer Her any
longer to lie committed unto other Hands then Your Own, and such as under You,
and nearer Her, shall be thought fit to put Her into. Which she has the
greater hopes to obtain, because more then ten times the number of good men
assigned by God for the stop of the severest sentence ever pronounced against
a City, Listed themselves in one day under the Noble Governor that then was,
without looking back upon any thing of their own Interest, esteemed vile in
comparison of the Public Safety, and Your Honor.

There needs no more interruption be given to Your weightier affairs, then to
acquaint You, that the Author absents his Name out of no other fear, then to
keep himself in a condition to do You farther service. For though Kings fall
before You, their Instruments may rise up against others that endeavor to give
evidence to an opposite Government; especially having no Legions to defend him
but Your Name, and the assurance he has to be owned, as truly he is

Jan. 1. 1651/2. (My Lord) Your Excellencyes most humble and obedient Servant.
To the Reader.
NOt to stumble into the like folly with those who court their Readers for*
Applause; since the most are wont to crowd about new Books, rather to note the
blemishes, then beauties of Authors; hooting, like Boys, at all they find
dissonant from what, Custom or Education has tuned their apprehensions to;
and not considering that what seems harsh now, may, when it is perfectly
scanned, be most harmonious: I will say no more, least I should seem to spread
my endeavors to catch etc. -- This being only directed to such candid spirits
as being themselves in quest of Truth and the present Quiet, cannot but love
those that do, though but weakly, promote it.

A PERSUASIVE to a Mutual compliance under THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT*
IT was never thought safe, much less prudent, for a suppressed party to be
intemperate in speeches, and turbulent in their Actions; especially having no
Power standing ready in the eye of probability, to protect them: Neither are
Examples easily found (all provocations considered) of greater Clemency, then
has been used by our present Governors; Into whose hands God has delivered
by an indubitable Conquest, some in his Anger, as others in his Mercy.

Though Envy cannot charge me, to have fallen from my first Love, The true
Representative of England; yet I never wanted natural bowels to those whom
Prejudice and other more selfish respects had unhappily cast on the other side:
but did daily lay out my supplications; and the poor Talent God entrusted me
with, to buy them to the ways of Peace. And therefore I am not so much to be
suspected of Partiality, but that I may possibly persuade at least the
Vanquished (and so in reason the most exasperated) to such a temper, as may
render, in their behalf, the prevailing Power as admirable for Moderation, as
Success has proclaimed them famous for their Valor.

That no Government extant this day, can possibly be demolished by fowler
hands, then it was erected; That, by the judgment of Truth it self, a strong
man ought not in reason to be bound but by one more mighty; And That the sword
in all ages, during the storms of War, has pretended to a privilege of
cutting such knots, as under a more serene Heaven might have puzzled not only
Reason but Religion to uniie; Are so notorious to all not wilfully or naturally
blind in Story, as he that should endeavor the proof of it, would to the wise
seem an Owl, rather then an Athenian* there being news of little else in all
History both sacred and profane.

And though such changes are strangers to us hatched under a still peace; they
were familiar to our Fathers; whose births stood ordinary dated from some
Foreign Conquest or their Deaths from a civil Dissension at home: Yet, by the
continuance of many of their Names in the same possessions, it does plainly
appear they had more patience and wisdom then perpetually to oppose
irreconsileable minds to succesfull and irresistible Powers. And where this was
not observed, how fatal and impartial the severity of Conquest has proved,
is plain in Comines, who attests to have seen a Branch of one of the most
illustrious Families in England, begging in Burgundy: whose Duke after that
infamous defeat given him by the Helvetians, ran, as was supposed, the like
fortune, his body not being found. Neither is there any thing likelier to cast
our Nobility and Gentry into this condition, then a chang by another War,
which will lie most heavy upon them, besides the uncertainty of the event: when
as a quiet and timely submission would estate them or their Children, in an
undoubted capacity to share in what is, or shall be established: Inabling them
to alter what they may find amiss. Whereas otherwise it would be an act of the
highest indiscretio^ for people so long beaten by the cruel storms of a Civil
War, to refuse for the present any Harbor, though never so incommodious: and
to venture again the wrack of so sacred a Vessel as the Commonwealth, for no
richer commodities, then an uncertain hope of boying up such Honors, profits
and Jurisdictions, as the fears, wilfulness and evil Counsels of those
formerly at the Helm, caused them to cast away; since experience has taught
us, we may live happily without them. Neither are those thus desirous of
alteration, able to procure it by their own strength; but must borrow of such
suspected friends, or known enemies, as are unlikely to show much more favor
to their Inviters, then those that shall labor to keep them out.

Were it not more discretion, to let her lie quietly a while in the Dock, under
the trimming of our new Masters? Who cannot be long uncompel'd, if not by
affection to themselves and their Children, yet by strong necessity, to set her
a float under Justice and good Government; hitherto obstructed by your selves
and new declared Malignants, who have nothing to show for their Lives and
Fortunes, but the mercy and courage of those they so bitterly exclaim against;
Yet are not able to screen themselves from their Power; although as far from
being pleased with it, as they can be safe without it.

Others presuming on the Articles conceded at Oxford or elsewhere, protest
themselves injured by that innocent Act for Subscription: But did they please
to look back, now, upon the naked condition they stood in then, destitute of
all hope of Relief; they might find greater cause to celebrate the goodness,
then arraigne of rigor, those did begirt them: For had the total destruction of
those Lords and Gentlemen, been so grateful to the State, as some in spleen,
others in ignorance do since represent; the siege need have been continued but
a few days, and all must have perished by the hands of despair, or without
caution have cast themselves into those of Mercy: or say the Commanders in
chief (never known prodigal of blood or time) to give an honorable pretense
for the rendition of that place, which the enemies had made impregnable by so
many Oaths nnd Protestations, did yield to more then in reason could be asked,
or granted, from so imperative a Power; It cannot be imagined they meant to
situate them in a higher condition then they were themselves; making that
arbitrary and at the will of the Vanquished, which is imposed without
exception, on all that Overcame: By which they had not only bound their own
hands from punishing all future disobedience; but left their enemies the
liberty to subscribe to the ruin, that they refuse, to the preservation of
themselves and their country.

Consult seriously your own consciences, and catechize them with this Question;
What Oaths, Confiscations, Restraints, and Obligations should have been
imposed on all had survived your revenge, In case providence had cast the Die
of War to the like advantage on your side? And you will not only blush at your
own shame, but confess your selves doubly subdued, first by the Valor, then
the Civility of those you pronounce the meanest of men.

The Norman Conquest, hitherto the fairest flower in the Crown of our Kings,
and this of the Armie's, were cut out with the same Iron, by the hand and
direction of a like Providence: The difference is, he was a Stranger, these
Natives; He established a Monarchy, whose nature is to decline into Tyranny;
These a Government styled by all Politicians, Free; And if you find it
otherwise, you may thank your selves, who will neither be happy, nor suffer
others; But oppose so obstinately the Public Establishment, out of no more
weighty reason, then to reinitiate splendid Titles, so far from being
essential to humane felicity, that such Nations as have them, were never
thought the happiest; no more then those that want them, the most miserable.

Were I so uncivil, as to draw the curtayne charity hangs before the Actions of
dead Princes; I could match, out of the Annals of your own Government, as great
disorders and oppressions, as you note in this; The latter being rendered so
much the more excusable, because, not only precedented by the former, but
created and continued to prevent such mischiefs, as your implacable Spirits do
foment in the hearts of ignorant and abused people; To whom though a Government
be most necessary, this kind or that is as absolutely indifferent. Yet if your
doctrine be infallible, That a King is only responsible to God for his worst
actions; it cannot but increase al wise men's affections to a Jurisdiction so
modest, as to acknowledge their best correspondent to the people, at least in
their Representative: And if you will suffer such a Government as these drive
at, quietly to be settled, it may be gest, by Venice and the United Provinces
(though inconsiderable for strength in respect of England) what wonders may be
expected; the first having stood a bulwark for above a thousand years against
the Turks, as the later has, from her infancy, a wall to the King of Spaine's
encroachments.

I do not believe, those daily Alarum's, you give the State, are beaten by
your consciences; but the louder Passions of Ambition, and Revenge: And if you
could remain quiet, you might abundantly satisfy both, by sharing in the
Government; and helping farther to chastise the perfidious Scot, who (under
God's vengeance for our Sins) was, you think, the cause of all these distempers.

You are to blame, if you have not already done your best to set up that
Interest, your Consciences, for the present, taught you to maintain, and if
so, you are freed from the shackells of all former Oaths and engagements; Man
being bound to no performance beyond possibility: yet least this should seem
too weak a discharge for so much honor and fidelity, as you pretend to owe
your King; God has called him to an higher Court: And that he has reserved
all cognizance of the manner of his removeall wholly to himself appears, by
placing the Authors of it above the reach of any power, but his own.

It shall not be the project of this Discourse either to naturalize, or make
invalid the Lines of Princes: though the truth or falsehood of them is made so
contingent by the infidelity of Women; as it does much abate my zeal, and may
do all others in the prosecution of their interests, before that of a Free
State; in a Nation so exhausted and tattered by divisions already, as it cannot
but expire under a milder conflict, then these new and Victorious Governors
will make, rather then part with their power, on which depend their heads, as
dear to them as a Crown can be to those that bid for it; who being out of
possession, are not so likely to find friends as enemies; especially in this
conjuncture, when most Nations have need of more swords then their own, and
therefore likelier to borrow then lend assistance: Neither is it a slight omen
of their continuance that the wise Spaniard courts them: As for France they
have work sufficient cut out already, or in case of want, we are near enough
to send them more: Concerning Danes and Swedes, they may, like the Cat, desire
the sweet milk of England, but will hardly venture wetting their feet, or the
encountering an English Navy: It being not likely that such Foreign Princes as
stood still all the Fathers time, who had an Army might secure their landing,
will in his vanquished Sons be active, who has now almost nothing left to
assure success, but the unarmed discontent of some Subjects; which cannot be
so unadvised, as to venture what is left at the curtesy of strangers; much
less can their hopes be so buried in the despair of the moderate government
of their countrymen, as to think to measure out a better by the splinters of
that broken reed Scotland, That has no cleanlier way to redeem her self from
being the byword and hissing of the World, for former Treacheries toward
their Native Kings, then by selling us and our children to a perpetual slavery
under one of their exasperated Sons: Neither durst they have ventured so much
beating, had they not been encouraged by a moldy Prophecy, That England (in
which you have yet a great share, and may keep it if you will be quiet) must be
one day ruined by the basest of people; which, in their own apprehention, can
be understood of none but themselves.

The Apostle Paul commands Christians to submit to the present power, for
Conscience sake; And justifies this Precept so far by his own example, as to
appear before a Court of Justice, no less illegal in regard of the Nation of
the Jews, then corrupt in respect of the Judges: where by his Rhetorical
expressions he teaches us, to own all Jurisdictions God has pleased to endow
with an Imperative power: Else we should deny that to the Magistrate, which we
make no conscience to concede to Thieves; from whom we take our selves to be
happily discharged, if we escape only with the loss of our money, and a promise
never to do any thing to their prejudice.

Nor can I think Panl would have shown less compliance, or used courser
language, had his trial fallen out in the days of Galba, Otho, or Vitellius;
the which had no stronger titles then the sword estated them in; being all
strangers to the line of the first Caesar's, or any adopted by them.

Nay had Pisoe's Conspiracy succeeded, and Rome by wise Seneca's persuasion
been reduced to their ancient Liberty; would the Apostles unwillingnesse have
been more, to subscribe to that, then the Title of Nero? Can you think he would
have pretended antiquitated Oaths, Covenants, or I know not what Protestations
formerly exacted? which if offered, he could not have avoided; a refusal being
as unsuitable to his Doctrine as safety: For we never heard news, till these
times, of State-Martyrs; The primitive Saints thinking all Kingdoms too poor
to dye for, but that of Heaven.

Indeed Shimei of the House of Saul, would needs be cursing where God blessed;
which gave occasion to Solomon to leave a Precedent under which you are sallen
for the like luxuriousness of speech. And here note by the way, how short
lived the love and forgiveness of Princes are: Since the best, though he could
forget Jonathan his friend, was sure to remember Shimei his enemy: both secured
by Covenant, the first of Amity; the latter of Charity, in acknowledgement of
his kindness in meeting him.

Now if David could not dye quietly intestate to Revenge, what huge Legacies
may we expect from the Heir of a Faher, who lost not only his Crown, but the
Head that ware it? or if so much temperance might be found in his Successor as
might mortify so high provocations; Yet the daily cries and clamours of the
Widows and Fatherless, whose Husbands, Fathers, and Estates were lost in his
defense, could not choose but call revenge up again. It being an ordinary
course for Princes to esteem that part of their assistance as is lost in ill
success, so little below enemies, as they oftentimes confiscate their Estates,
only to increase the encouragement of those, from whom they hope to receive
better. And if it be not the complexion of Kings to be ungrateful, I pray give
me the Reason, why Henry the 7th cut off Stanlies head, after he had set the
Crown upon his own?

Therefore let not the sound of your discontent be heard in other Nations, to
the prejudice of the happiness of your own: By which the ears of all that
delight in war are so tickled, that the Sea, this Island is encompassed with,
were too shallow to keep them out, but that it is assisted by a greater depth of
Gods mercy.

Such as oppress unnecessarily the people, shall never want enemies; nor those
that truly stand for Liberty, friends: Therefore have patience, and assure your
selves, that God, which harh taught the Army the ways to so much miraculous
success, will suddenly (after this general submission I persuade to) inspire
them with an Enstablishment may make us happy: or in case they neglect it,
undoubtedly send as exemplary a ruin upon their own heads.

Let me therefore entreat you to imitate your Ancestors, who suffered the Crown
of England with more patience, to be transferred from one Strangers head to
another, then you do contribute to the setting it on your own and your
childrens: There being nothing able to render you incapable of it, but an
unseasonable desire to wring it out of their hands, who, I hope, have no more
ambitious ends in retaining it so long, then to make it fit and easy for you:
Neither can any be in a right capacity to receive it, till brought to such a
temper, as it is indifferent to them, either to obey or command.

If you are so desirous the letter of the Law should be exactly observed, do
nothing contrary to the sense of it, which is the preservation of the
Government in being; whose quiet it is now as naturally to intend, as it was
formerly that of Kings: Alter but the Name, and contribute the like obedience,
and you are just where you were. But if this be denied, do not wonder, that
new trials are opposed to new offenses: For if ordinary Jurers will assign no
punishment for them which act by the Kings Authority, it is fit the State
should provide others to take care, that in case it be employed against their
safety, such as do it may not escape without punishment: Since God, that has
given them such vast successes, has also endued them with more Prudence, then
to be ruined by niceties.

Neither are they less resolved to defend themselves from unavoidable ruin,
then you to obtain a more uncertain reward. This makes me believe you would
have as much reason to bewail an absolute victory, as they a total loss. For
in that case, if the Nation should escape the tyranny of Strangers, it were
impossible to avoid falling into a greater of her own: It being the custom of
all Princes, to proportion the weight of the peoples fetters, to their own
fears: Now how the Cavaliers can be free, when the Roundheads are slaves, is
not to be found in the small volumne of my Politics.

Though the High Presbyterian so suddenly swelled with the hope he had swallowed
of Sovereignty, that he brake in the opinion of the people, before he was able
to set up for himself, by endeavoring to lay to every single Parish, a power
judged too unweldy for a Dioces; Yet I thought not to have taken him so soon in
the habit of a Malignant; which suits better with his passion, then the gravity
and piety he pretends to; or discretion, which cannot but dictate to him, that
he has sinned past forgiveness, by reducing the Crown to the last extremity;
And compelling the Army by an unparalleld ingratitude, to actions more suitable
to his own, then the chief Commanders former deportment; in which if they
leaned too much on worldly policy, it was to avoid falling into that visible
pit, the heads of this party had contrived for them.

What religious observers of the Covenant, they have been, and what enemies to
the known faults of the Bishops, they with so much spleen, exploded, may
appear by the multitudes of preferments, and bunch of Steeples the have hung
to their pursestrings: Besides their ungrateful desertion of that Army, who,
when they durst not trust their own side, for fear of being betrayed;
expunged, by their faithful valor, that sentence of death, which those they
seem to adhere to now, had writ upon every wall against them.

Is it not a sad thing, to see Conscience like a cloake-bag, stuffed with all
carriages, be they foul or fair? Were not the Papists truer friends to their
Countries peace; who upon a change in Religion, and more to their general
disadvantage, then this can be, to any at enmity with Rome, swore Allegiance to
those of contrary Tenants; The truth of which they so far maintained, as in the
year 88, many appeared with considerable forces, in favor of a Protestant
Queen, against him they styled the most Catholic King?

For those they call Levellers, so many of their Propositions as may concern
the equal administration of Justice, and the Liberty of the People, ought no
doubt to be harkned unto: But their Consciences being possibly agitated by
subtiler heads then their own (the Devil never being in a greater capacity to
act mischief, then when he is transformed into an Angel of light) it behooves
them to be wary; least, pretending to a government more exact then humane
corruption is capable of, they do not fall into a worse then ever yet was
established: For if they create a division in the Army, they promote the ends
of their enemies, and shall set up nothing but tyranny, and the destruction of
themselves and their Party.

Then since this Nation has endured so many several changes, in these later
years, without any considerable diminution of her splendour and felicity; I
heartily pray it may not run a severer fortune hereafter; which cannot be
better prevented, then for all Parties in their several relations, quietly to
submit to this present Government: Which having the only power of Protection,
cannot in justice be denied the duty of Obedience. To persuade which the more
easily, I most humbly beg of those in Authority, To concede to the just desires
and Tears of the Nation.

FINIS.
A PLEA FOR THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT, COMPARED WITH MONARCHY.
NOTHING makes me more sensible of the wrath of God for sin, then the
consideration, That want and oppression are become the ill consequents of that
primitive Blessing, Increase and multiply; from whence the Devil taking
advantage on our natural self-love, raises up Covetousness, the parent of
Propriety; out of whose bosom result all humane calamities: Amongst which this
is one of the most severe, That it renders us incapable to be governed without
Laws; being too partial, to judge uprightly between our own interest, and
our neighbors; so as where Right is absent, Power steps in and supplies her
place.

This at first necessitated Jurisdiction; And the example of one God might
present a pattern for Monarchy: But Kings did so far deviate from this
precedent, that they quite forgot, their Election was to increase the felicity
and ease of their Subjects, not their own: Which has caused people in all
ages to have recourse to Arms; whereby sometimes they impaired, seldom mended
their Condition: Because out of pride, ignorance, or a superstitious reverence
to custom, they refused to entrust more then one with their Obedience: And we
have cause to believe, that the exorbitant power, and scandalous adoration
given to Princes (in which, like Promotheus, they rob God of his Divinity,
bestowing the Attributes of Sacred, Worship, and Majesty upon a sinful Man)
grew at the beginning out of the bitter root of Idolatry; This dignity being at
first found among the Heathen, and never taken into one Family by the people of
God, till in likelihood, the goodness of David had allured them, and the
wisdom of Solomon ensnared them into an absolute tyranny, under the House of
Jesse: Which they saw so much cause to repent of, as ten Tribes cast it off by
a Defection, made legitimate by God himself. And what frequent changes
followed, appears in Sacred Story; set down no doubt not only for the
instruction of Kings, but as a direction for Subjects what to do in such cases
of oppression: Like causes being liable to the like effects.

Greece and Rome, from whom the grounds of Learning are deduced, did suffer
their wanton Poets to endow their Princes with the powers and names of their
Gods; and their Gods with the vices of their Kings; as Adulteries, Rapes,
Oppressions, Thefts, etc. not sparing Jupiter himself, whom they challenge to
have wrested the Celestial Monarchy from his Father Saturn: (in which is
morallized the unnaturalness of Ambition, breaking through all Relations,
though never so sacred). But as the Idols of the Heathen cannot be
distinguished from ordinary stones, unless by the worship given them by those,
who yet upon higher illuminations, do break or cast them away: So though
Princes (such Monsters in power) are able to dazzle the weak eyes of ignorant
men, by the false rages of Divinity, the flattering Clergy flash in the faces
of such as oppose them; Yet it is no less then miraculous, that wise men
should be so enamoured on the works of their own hands, as to place such so
near God, and to pronounce them unaccountable for personal faults, much less
for those of so epidemicall a nature, that they concern the welfare of all;
forgetting that flesh and blood is of so wild a condition, that nothing can
restrain it but the fearful apparition of some visible punishment; And that
other Governments want not the blessings of the best of Monarchies, yet stand
uncharged with their inconveniences (It being possible to be a bad King, though
a good man in an inferior Relation: The whole mass of History being scarce
able to furnish out one in all points accomplished with so many Regal virtues,
as might compense the damages received from his Predecessor, or him that did
immediately succeed: Yet dazzled with the splendour of a Title, whose foul
original continuance has razed out of the memories of the most, The ignorant
multitude do, without any scrutiny after worth or convenience, think
themselves obliged to submit to the untried discretion of the next of the same
Line: So far entrusted in England before the Conquest, that the decision of
all controversies lay incumbent in the person of the King only; till
corruption and oppression had given cause to mould Reason into a more certain
Law; which no respect to their Subjects good, but only their own trouble or
visible constraint, was able to tempt them to: Yet the people were so simple,
that upon the least concession of ease, they buried the benefit which might
have resulted from their expense of blood and treasure, in the same Government,
if not in the same person, they had opposed; who was made the more cunning, not
the better, by any thing had passed; it being the business of all politic
Princes, to rebate the edge of the Laws toward themselves, for whose
moderation they were chiefly intended, and to render them mortal to the
people; who in case they were too weak to make good the justest quarrel
against their King, perished as Traitors, when the true treason was perpetrated
by their Prince and his evil Counselors; who are ordinarily the first
causers of commotions by their cruelty and oppressions.

Now the indiscretion of our Ancestors has been such, tempted to it by the
miseries incident to Civil War, as they gave concession to all the Laws
reason or experience could present were likely to strengthen the security of
the King in fact; So as the justest opposition in the Subject lay under no
slighter penalty, then the loss of Honor, goods, lands and life: Forgetting,
That the stronger Fortification was raised before the gates of Kings, the more
difficult they rendered all access to Liberty, when ever they were invaded by
Tyranny, or the peoples convenience should call for another Government less
ranting and expensive.

And I may be confident, this could not have been effected with such ease, but
upon a presumption That the power of Parliaments was thought subordinate to any
Law, Experience being barren of occasion to make demonstration, where the
Legislative power should reside, in case of a rupture between the King and both
or either House, never till now in dispute, though tacitly implied in the cases
of such as it is known they have deposed (which questionless was done without
the Royal assent;) Therefore not being determinated in express words, it
might be thought impossible, a Court so paramount, should lie included under
general Rules, esteemed in all grants unable to prejudice the Crown, and
therefore with better Reason unbinding to the Parliament, often known not only
to dispose of that, but the heads that wore it, So far as to determine some
unable, some unworthy to govern. And if any should endeavor to set bounds to
the power of this High Court, it was as vain an attempt, as to limit the
Nation to such an extent of felicity; which could no longer hold in nature or
Reason, then those that did it were able by love or force to master her
strength; which wisdom would persuade her to resume upon the first approach of
advantage. Besides, the King owning himself but a third Estate (as you may
find in one of his well-pen'd Declarations) he could not, by his absence,
remove power so far from the other, but that it did vertually remain in some
hands for the good of the People (esteemed the supreme Law) supposed in all
probability to be more cordially intended by the other, by reason they were
inseparable companions with the people in any good or evil redounded to them
from the Law; Then by the Prince, whose Interest was single, and so far
remote from epidemicall ends, that he might, by incroachment, improve his
condition to a selfe-advantage, raising a particular gain, at the cost of the
Public; not probably to be intended by the Nobility, unless their reason
were quite lost in their dependence on the Crown; but impossible to be
projected by the Commons, who after dissolution, and their power returned to
those that gave it, all marks of distinction cease, and they are mingled with
the rest of the people, being equal sharers in what loss or advantage the
Representative, in which they did reside, produced to the Commonwealth.

Wherefore if a Parliament falls in pieces, as this has done, so much Legal
power cannot remain in both the other, as in the House of Commons, The
fairest, most natural, and least partial Representative of the whole Nation,
whose true and unquestioned proxcies they are; The Lords residing by birth, as
the Bishops (in these latter times) by favor; And both found by experience,
rather to intend their own ends, then the public.

And for such as maintain, That we owed the liberty of electing Parliaments,
to the benevolence of our Kings, May as well say, we were indebted to them for
our being or nature; which abhorres to hold felicity, and what is assigned for
supportation, at the will of another; a servitude impossible to be imposed upon
a major part that are Masters of right reason.

Now for the King, I should not have looked for him among the three Estates,
much less have owned him for one of them, had he not pleased to name himself
so, and, by this confession, made empty the formerly unquestioned seat of the
Church; By which he rather did weaken, then support, the unnatural and
destructive pretense he made to a Negative voice: For where there is a Parity
in an unseparable union, it is impossible to find room for so much difference
in power, as that the most single and suspected part (in regard of an
experimented selfe-interest), should determine of the fitness or inconveniency
of what the other should present, without giving a stronger Reason then his own
Will; never known, but upon constraint, or for want of money, to contradict it
self for the peoples good.

And though in cases of equal correspondency there might seem some color of
Justice, yet here there cannot; Because the King professes his Person so far
out of the point blank of Law, as that he is responsible to none but God, for
the worst, not only that he can do himself, but suffer to be done by his
Instruments.

Therefore since no tie can be made strong enough to restrain him from
breaking in to his Subjects most sacred immunities, this power must needs be
too extravagant to mingle with theirs less interessed; who are so modest as to
confess themselves and their judgments implicitly contained in the suffrages
of the Major part; though the Law passed be never so contrary to their sense:
And I cannot but admire from whence this Infallibility should at first be
derived, which were no less madness for the people to give, then presumption
in any, below a God, to receive.

Such as allow the King a Negative voice, forget they place the Abstract of all
the Prudence, Power and Probitie of the Nation, in one Individual; Juells of
too high a value to be packt up in so single and weak Vessels, as our English
Monarchs appear to have been: But were they better, they might upon this
account, enervate the gravest results of the Supreme Council; yet denied by
Law and Custom the ability to quash the sentence of an inferior Court of
Justice.

Then if no Example can be produced, of any King, that has voluntarily, and
out of no more impulsive respect, then mere conscience and indulgency to his
poor prince-trodden people, offered a Bill to abate the power he found so
abused by his Predecessors, and not likely to be better employed by such as
might succeed; What greater Impudence can there be, then to maintain, That
this Negative vote is claimed only to avoid the abolition of good laws, and to
hinder the passing of worse: Since it is notoriously known, that all the
customs people complain of, have been intruded and still kept in being by
the countenance of an exorbitant power pretended by Kings: And therefore such a
prerogative cannot be looked upon as natural and convenient, but destructive
to the very essence of Liberty; and consequently void in it self.

In case of Minority, Madness and Folly, the trial of the Kings sufficiency
is without question in the Parliament; and if that be allowed to determine the
extent of his power in contingencies, no ways chargeable upon any as faults:
Shall wicked, contumacious and destructive principles and practices be exempt
from their cognizance? Since the fool or mad man cannot be liable to so severe
a censure, as he that imployes his wit wholly to the destruction of his people.
And if we trace our Kings through all the paths their encroachments have made
over the peoples immunities, we shall find, it was not Charity has kept them
from being more tyrannical, but Weapons and constraint: all our privileges
having been first written, and in all ages forced to be copied out, in the
peoples blood; An argument sufficient to prove, that little is to be expected
from them, in favor of the Public, but by constraint; Kings intending
nothing more then the augmentation of their own Arbitrary power: Therefore
Flattery, rather then Truth, fonted them Fathers of their Country; to which
they are in nothing suitable, unless in correction, the severest and least
hospitable part of Justice.

They indeed, as domestique Fathers, are oftentimes suborned by a particular
natural love, to do that which is destructive to the general well being of a
Nation; as where an equal affection to their children shall cause a division
of their Kingdom into several Cantons; by which the whole is weakened in
regard of the expense of more Courts, and exposed to ruin by division; as is
not without a precedent in Story.

Next the affection they bear to their female issue, makes them raise great
taxes to marry them, not only suitable to their birth, but unlimited ambition:
By which means a people are often made subject to the curse of a foreign
Jurisdiction: And in case it should happen to light upon France or Spain, or
any Prince else unwilling to remove his Throne further from the Sun, they must
run the fortune of Naples, Sicily, Millan, Navarre, etc. who are so miserable
as to be under the Regiment of unnatural Strangers.

And say they should be so mad, as to follow their ambitious humors, in quest
of honor, out of their own territories, as Francis and John of France did,
they may like them, fall into captivity, and tie their Kingdoms to harder
conditions, and a greater Ransom, then all the particular benefits redounding
from that government are able to compense; or all the inconveniences objected
to a Popular State, parallel; who are confessed on all sides to be responsible
for their misgovernment, in parcel, as particular Members; or in gross, as
the whole Council, when dissolved: Whereas the flattering Clergy and
Courtiers, by perverting the Scriptures, have in a single person situated
Regality out of the reach of all question; so as he may shake or kick about
the world without any fear of other danger, then what the Poets feign fell to
Phaeton from Jupiter himself: Which cannot but persuade wise men to keep it
out, where it never was; and upon all advantages to explode it, where
misfortune has brought it in.

Queen Elizabeth, though an excellent Prince, yet incroach'd upon the English
Liberty, by denying them to enquire who should be her Successor; The
unnaturalness of this tyranny being hid from the eyes of the people (whose
interest it was to know it) by the delicate and soft hand she carried over
them; defective in nothing, in their imagination, but that it was frail earth,
and so subject to mortality: which made the Commons wink at the commitment of
Pigot and Wentworth; valuing the satisfaction of her mind, before the Members
of their own Body: Neither could they well have found weapons to have revenged
this unparalled outrage, she standing so fair painted in her Subjects
hearts: Therefore though they did well to pass by a fault they could not
punish; yet the goodness of her reign cannot be said to expiate the curse she
brought in by this example, the unnaturalness of the Scotch Line took
advantage of: which I believe had never come in (especially without Caution)
but that the fear of the Londoners (wanting time to secure their wealth) and
the baseness of the Nobility, tempted them to betray themselves into the hands
of those, who were ever enemies to this Nation: Now if there was so little care
found in a Queen, raised from a prisoner; and goodness in a King taken from
the barren mountains of Scotland; Who could expect more gratitude, then we
have found in his Son, that to make good his Fathers Monopolies and his own
illegal taxes, covered the Kingdom with a Sea of blood?

It is impossible for a Popular Government to be so expensive as these two last
Kings, though with Jeroboam they should sell themselves to work wickedness;
not having whereupon to bestow it, without making so palpable a demonstration
of their Covetousness, as the people would soon take notice thereof, and
redress it by their change or ruin; which might be obtained at an easier rate
then by a War; without which no Monarch, though never so bad, is able to be
removed; who commonly has a power to defend him proportional to his
prodigality, and the Honors he throws about; by which those multitudes who
only hope, are as strongly taken, as the few that enjoy benefit by him.

Now Princes though generally bad, do yet admit of comparisons; as you may
find the three Degrees in Elizabeth, James, and Charles. For though Queen
Elizabeth incroached upon the liberty of particulars; She maintained War in
France, the Low Countries, with Spain and Ireland; yet never had unlawful tax,
or more then two Subsidies at once; which put to the whole Revenue of the Crown
(as I have heard) did not make 700000l per annum: yet she kept a glorious
Court, paid all debts, and was never known to break her word with the Subject.
King James enters, who never paid Army, built House, or was any way
magnificently hospitable, yet scrued the Revenue to a double proportion, sold
and gave away inestimable quantities of Woods and Lands, omitting nothing
wherein he might poll his Subjects; Yet died in debt, and scandalous for his
breach of Faith, besides the incomparable repute lost to the Nation by the sale
of the Cautionary Towns to the Dutch. King Charles succeeds, who answers ths
peoples love and vows for his safe return from Spain, and assumption to the
Throne, with a contempt of Parliaments, and augmentation of the Revenue
(Ship-mony cast in) to 1800000l (yet never equaled the magnificence of Queen
Elizabeth, nor the liberality of King James) sums not be concealed by a more
popular State; or if possible, easy to be retrived by squeezing the purloiners;
whereas this vast Treasure mouldred away in Masks and other effeminate
vanities, no ways for the honor or safety of the State. Not to say more,
whose business is only to show the blessings of a Free Regiment, not all the
curses attending the Government, or faults incident to the persons of Kings;
which are rendered by our Clergy incurable, as sheltred under a Divine Right.

But neither this foolish varnish, daubed on by flatterers; nor prescription it
self, backed by an unquestioned consent of our Fathers, can be of strength
enough to dispossess a people of so inherent a property, as nature has
estated all Reasonable creatures in; viz. The choice of the Laws they intend
to be governed by: No more then a Parliament, which is virtually the whole
People, can bind Posterity longer then shall suit with the will of the same
power that did at first establish it. And if the Parliament is oftentimes so
cautious, as to make Laws probationary; Can any think it suitable to the
principles of Reason, that a King (obnoxious to the frailties of other mortals)
should be borne to a right above them; and left to an absolute liberty; not
only to do what he please, but to cross any thing shall be offered from his
Subjects, by the inspiration of I know not what negative Power? I wonder men
are so indiscreet to give that to a child, fool, or mad man, which they deny
to a grave, wise, and experimented Pope; whom they call Antichrist for nothing
more justly, then the arrogance he shows in advancing his single judgment
above a Counsel. And if things be rightly considered, you shall find them both
hang upon the same irrational string, and likely to drop into the same
bottomless pit; the one vaunting to be Vicar general for things temporal, the
other for eternal.

Yet if we look near, we may find marks to demonstrate it was not thus from
the beginning, that Kings pretended to a Negative power; as appears by the
modest words he uses at the crossing of a Bill offered to him; which are Le
Roy s'advisera: Though time and neglect may have taken such precedents of the
file, as they have a number more, by which Kings were chalked a way to their
duty; a thing by them so much abhorred, that the Records in the Tower have
suffered a continual suppression. Besides it is notoriously known that this
Negative Power so much insisted upon, and employed by the last King against the
peace of the Nation; has in all ages been subordinate to the will of a Wife or
Favorite, who have not seldom been found to give or sell it to the prejudice
of the Commonwealth.

Wherefore if the inconveniences of Kings assending without any opposition be
so insufferable; what mischief can escape the imagination, (if the sense) of
that people, who have all of them, according to Regal Law, forfeited as
Traitors, all that is dear to nature; either for opposing, or want of
assisting the dead King; should any of his Line succeed? which formerly so
shackled us, but is now unravelled by the same means it was twisted, by
William, styled, though unjustly, the Conqueror.

As for places of Scripture alleged in favor of wicked Princes, by which
their Parasites endeavor to remove them out of the way of Question; They will
upon examination rather prove suborned, then competent witnesses; as taught to
speak by intressed Divines, whose power and estates were wholly dependant on
the Crown.

The extent of the Jurisdiction of our Monarchs, held no proportion with that
of Israel, confessed by God, to be founded in his wrath; who used at first to
allot them out of his own choice; which rendered it, if not presumption, yet
useles to limit them by Laws: But after this prepared Manna of just Government
ceased to drop upon them from Heaven; They had reason to provide wholesome
Ordinances of their own, to preserve them from corruption; As we find the ten
Revolted Tribes did, by the process against Naboth; whereas Solomon gave no
other reason for the death of men, then his will, by which alone Ioab and his
own brother were tried and condemned. And if want of wisdom, have, or lack of
experience, made the people forget their own convenience, in the large extent
of power they afforded them; I know no place of Scripture binds us to follow
their indiscretion; No more then it warrants our Kings to imitate the vices of
theirs. And after Solomon I do not find any bad Prince longer endured then the
people were constrained out of mere necessity; To whose destruction also they
were oftentimes incited by God himself; whose silence now cannot in reason be
taken for his consent, because he has long since forborne to speak unto us
otherways then by written examples, which afford plenty of them Deposed and
put to Death.

The mercinary Lawyers, to keep Kings safe behind the curtain (where they
play at boh-peepe with justice, as their holy Father the Pope, does by
Religion) make the King a party in cases touching Life; By this means
shrowding his Person so securely under his Office, as nothing could rescue the
people from tyranny, but a through Reformation of the Common Law.

For in the condition we stood, Magna Charta, and all other Laws extorted from
our Kings in favor of the people, are rendered invalid, if Kings were
responsible for no misdemeanors; It being the Lawyers position in all cases
That the King can do no wrong. Though it is apparent, that no mischief fell
to us, but from his unlimited and usurped power: Since therefore so many years
experience proclaims it a thing impossible, to manacle a Supremacy in one
single individual; it cannot but be most safe, to divide it amongst more: Many
not being so apt, as one, to be intoxicated by the fumes of power and flattery.

The childish Love the Common people bear the gaudy person of a King, gives
occasion to believe, that popular Goverments are rather results of Princes
disorders, then the natural effects of the peoples inclinations; and therefore
founded with the more difficulty; But after establishment easiest maintained;
wise men being apter to connive at a fault in this Government, out of hope to
have one day the happiness to mend, or commit it themselves.

The first Monarchies were purely tyrannical as Babylon and Persia, who used
to try both Plaintiff and Defendant in a Starchamber of Beasts: Yet, though
absolute tyrants over their people, so much enslaved to their own passions; as
what was uttered against the life of the Prophet in folly, was not after
repealable in judgment. And under these arbitrary Monsters the world labored,
till necessity, the pregnant Mother of all convenience, taught their Subjects
to temper them with Laws. But sinding absotute Princes of so faithless a
nature, that they were not tenable by compact: delighting like the Demoniaques
in the Gospel, to rome in the estates and among the graves of their Subjects;
some Nations exploded them quite; as formerly several Cities of Greece and
Rome etc. and of later years the united Provinces, who having obtained their
liberty, and so not being exhausted by the exorbitant and vast expenses of a
King, nor shackled by the distracted and contrary interests of a foolish and
suborned Counsel; were able from their infancy to tear such morsells out of
the throat of his great Catholic Majesty; as the weakness of France suffered
him to swallow; and the fears of King James caused him to sell, to prevent the
danger, he was persuaded by his jealousies, and some of his Counselors (more
servants unto that State then to him) waited upon the delivery or denial of
the Cautiona^y towns to the King of Spain; which this poor spot of Earth
does not only dare to own, as their birthright; But have brought him to that
pass, as he has twice concluded peace with them, under the free notions of an
Independent State.

And some Nations never at all admitted any Kings; and such as are celebrated
for most wisdom, felicity, and continuance; Apparent in the State of Venice,
who has outlived the story of her own birth, and seen the often repeated
funerals of all the Kingdoms in Europe; being now by her account, onward of
her twelfth Century: And though France seems to boast of little less
continuance, deriving her original from the uncertain history of Pharamond,
supposed her first King: Yet the impartial reader may find her subject to the
discipline of strangers, and her own inferior Princes, till Lewis the
eleaventh's wisdom had compounded for her wardship: and if Edward the fourth
his contemporary had been owner of so much prudence, as the Free Cantons of the
Swisse; he had mis'd of his mark.

Fulness of bread, that inclines a people to Idolatry, makes them so proud and
wanton, as to think any of their own body too mean to Govern; choosing rather,
with the Froggs in the Fable, a Storke for their King, though it be his nature
to devour them, then a selected number of their own, tied in reason to
preserve them. Not perceiving that Monarchy is a sacrilegious overcharging a
single person with more honor and power, then so frail a creature is able to
bear, without falling into the distempers of excess: which renders
industrious Nations more capable of freedom, as nearer to a parity; then such
as time and luxury have overstock'd with Nobility and Gentry; who scorning to
be subject to those of their own quality, and not so well able to tyrannize
over inferiors upon their own single score; cry up Princes, whose faults they
cover with a false varnish, made up of an imaginary Divine Right, glistering
only in the eyes of fools; wise men owning it as borrowed from the Eastern
Idolaters; who were never better pleased then when they saw something carried
before them gloriously adorned with the eare-rings, jewels, and spoils of the
people. Which gives all Politians occasion to to pronounce, that a Prince
cannot disparrage his affairs more, then by suffering his power to fall under
a popular contest; Nor a Republic decline sooner into a tyranny, then by
continuing that shadow which decency constraines Free Governments to retain of
Monarchy, too long in one Family (as the Dutch did) without change or some
vigorous opposition. For however Insurrections, like thunders are terrible for
the present, They render Liberty more serene and clear: Princes being apt,
with Alexander, to apprehend themselves more then humane, unles they be now and
then besprinkled with their own blood; Affliction and opposition being better
able to put them into the way of duty, then flattery or prosperity; so as if
Fear were not more prevalent with them, then Love, Subjects would be far
more miserable: since it is without question, that the interest of Princes
looks with a contrary aspect to that of the People; His gain being for the
most part their loss, as in case of illegal taxes, which if once carried
clear without question, are conveyed as an inheritance to their posterity; who
improve, rather then diminish any thing laid in charge by their Predecessors:
Therefore Governors out of their own body, in reason should be more natural,
then these fathers in Law, who see nothing about them but what they falsely
imagine to be their own.

Now though a Senate may have inclusively the same power, they are more tender
of using it; for fear the evil consequence should reach their Children, who
in these impartial Governments mingle among the people, and participate of all
their inconveniences; unles wisdom and good parts makes them capable of their
Fathers dignities; which happens rarely; Able Statesmen finding their virtues
commonly wanting in their Children: And this discovers another gross
inconvenience in successive Kingdoms, where not only Law and Custom, but
Religion, if you trust Regal divinity, teaches the people to cry Hosanna to
the next Heir; Though nature, or which is worse, his wicked inclinations,
render him unworthy the government of a Ass; Whereas a Senate is continually
filled with the most able men.

Not to loose time in casting up the account Antiquity made of this Government;
upon whose approbation it is the nature of men to look through the prospective
of multiplying opinion, as they do upon less remote verities with the eyes of
envy and contradiction; The progress and virtues of the State of Venice are
patterns not found in the greatest, or matched by the best of Kings: Who has
received nothing (her situation only excepted) but from the benevolence of
Heaven and her own virtue; which has enabled her (though but a Pamphlet in
comparison of the Voluminous power of other Nations) to bear the opposition of
all her Neighbors in their turns, and sometimes united by the malice of his
Holiness; Though armed with no more natural weapons, then what her money puts
into the hands of strangers; (the most unhappy Militia a State can employ;) Yet
because all her Senators look one way, and not a squint upon Foreign
Interests, as the Privadoes of our Kings have been known to do, in relation
to their respective Pensions; Unity improves their small force to so much
advantage, as they have for these latter years, not only disputed the
dominion of the Seas with the Grand Seigniour, but forced him to wash away with
his peoples blood, diverse marks of advantage his multitudes of Soldiers had
purchased him in the Levant: So as if Monarchs were owners of so much
Christianity, as to spend but the tith of what is consumed yearly in Masks,
and such unnecessary vanities, this way (a thing not to be hoped for, till our
good God have discovered to all Nations, the curse of monopolized authority)
this enemy to Christ might be easily reduced; Since all the force he can make,
returns him, from this single State, nothing but dishonor and loss; whereas
the greatest German Caesar was never yet able to bear the least branch of his
power, without imploring and receiving aid from most of Christian Princes, who
are now so weltered in their own blood, as they omit the opportunity; Thinking
themselves more charitably employed in the ruin of their own people, or
Neighbors; A Lunacy could never befall them, were they not agitated by such
ridiculous humors, as Commonwealths disdain to be affected withal; where
there is no room for any disputation about such trivial things as crabbid
Titles, Legitimacy etc. all being ejected there as spurious that conduce not to
honor or safety. And what advantage this State has in the wise Conduct of
affairs, may be easily discerned by any eye, that shall pass over the
Transactions of this Senate and Paul the fifth, during the Interdict; and
compare them with the Treaties of our King James with Spain: the first
redounding no less to the honor of that Republique, then the latter to the
shame and loss of this Nation.

Neither are these advantages peculiar to Venice only, but to all found under
this Government; which officiating in the double capacities of a King and a
Council both, cannot choose but be wiser then the first, and less subject to
corruption then the latter; it being as unnatural for them to betray their
own power, as it is usual with the greatest Courtiers to sell the revelation
of their Masters most secret Counsels.

Though Offenders under Free States are punished with the greatest severity, it
is with the least injustice and partiality: Single persons being more subject
to be agitated by the tempests of Fury, Prejudice or Revenge, then Popular
Tribunals, which in all reason are not capable of so total a distemper, as to
utter such intoxicated Censures, as ordinarily drop from single judgments; who
rather then confess a mistake, will, with the Tyrant in Seneca, make three
guilty, because they find one innocent.

Neither does Covetousness, the root of all evil, prosper so well, or spread
so much in the hearts of Senaters, as in those of Kings; lest their Posterity
should be forced to disgorge what they had devoured; Too vast estates being so
formidable to this Government, as they cannot be passed by without observation,
and jealousy, by such as know the cause of the reduction of the State of
Florence under the House of Medici: But Kings are such bottomless pits, that
they proclaim themselves responsible to none but God, for all their rapines
and injustice: By which they do not only adjourne all reparation to the day
of Doom, but leave their oppressions for lawful inheritances to their
successors; As the Monopoly Queen Elizabeth granted upon Glasses, was
improved since to very Rags and Marrowbones.

All a Senate can justly be charged with by way of disadvantage, after
perfectly founded, is division; which if pure from popular ambition, may
possibly occasion more good then hurt, by keeping them upright; One Faction
remaining as a guard upon the rest: Their own safety persuading all
Corporations to intend the general welfare, in which Reason gives the right
hand of advantage to the Government by a Senate, rather then that of a King;
whose best designs are retarded, if not buried with his person; whereas this
Jurisdiction is never sick, much less subject to drink or death; but reaches,
through a continual suppliment, to as immense an eternity, as Providence has
afforded any humane Society; not being apt to be scared out of the paths
leading to their advantage; consisting of too great a number to be subject to
any clandestine attempt, or abused by evil Counsels, or corrupted by rewards;
whereas experience teaches, that Kings may be forced through fear, or allured
by flattery, to resign their reason, and concede things not only contrary to
their peoples, but their own interest: as appeared by that celebrated Prince
Henry the Fourth of France, who was not ashamed to confess, he durst not for
fear of his own life, but revoke the just Ban, he and all the Parliaments of
France had pronounced against the bloody Jesuits; whose expulsion the Venetians
make good against all their machinations, threats of the Pope, and mediation of
Princes. From whence I may observe, That though experience proves by this
State, and the Catholic Cantons, etc. that the Roman profession may suit, in
some measure, with all kinds of Government, yet undeniable Reason of State
renders Monarchy most acceptable to the Pope, as it does the Reformation to
Free States; who are too wise to admit willingly a Foreign interest into the
Commonwealth, by a multiplicity of Ecclesiastics, independent on any other
power but that of Rome; which Kings, being but single persons, dare not resist,
for fear of the Knife; it being besides a maine disadvantage, in worldly
policy, to profess a Religion so odious to their neighbors, that they are
looked upon under no better notion, then Heretics; and so no faith to be kept
with them, nor marriage contracted, but by an especial Indulgence from his
Holiness, which Republickes have no use of; And being already under the ill
opinion of the Roman Church, do but desire a fair opportunity to free
themselves from it, and make booty of the Religious Houses, long since looked
upon by them, as dens of Traiters and idle persons. Therefore such as desire a
through Reformation, displease their ends by abetting Monarchy: Kings being
known not only to have been the Begetters and Nources, but the only
Maintainers of Antichrist, if the POPE be the man. And if any, in opposition to
this truth, object Queen Elizabeth (her Brother Edward's Youth and short
reign rendering his inclinations abortive to the benefit of the Nation); I
answer, whosoever considers how resolutely the Pope denied to reverse her
Illegitimation, refusing to give a decent reception to her Ambassadors; And
with what affection the Parliament (out of pure zeal, hatred to the Clergy, or
fear of refunding the profits made of Abbey Lands;) did offer to cover her
blemishes with the Crown; must conclude, there could be no better refuge for
her in prudence, then to side with such, as did maintain the Church of Rome it
self to be Basterdized. And for the dangers probability might threaten to such
a total defection, all being avoided by her tyrannical Father, her Council
(in whom she was the happiest ever waved the English Scepter) thought a
dispencing with them less prejudicial to her affairs, then the tedious
ceremonies incident to a Reconciliation with Rome. Neither was the progress
the Protestants made in Germany, France and Switserland, a small provocation;
who by letters instigated her to this resolution; (the hopes of the Council of
Trent not being quite lost,) because they found a general desire in all
Princes to see the power of Rome moderated.

And that she was rather thrown by necessity, then fell of her own accord,
from the Church of Rome, appears by the Ceremonies used at her Inauguration,
all purely Catholic; so as though she was not unwilling to give the new
Profession hope, she could not be brought suddenly to put the old in despair;
not endeavoring to bring in a greater Reformation then she found, but suffered
the Bishops to besprinkle her Reign with the blood of some, and enrich her
Exchequer with the livelyhoods of many more, that were so zealous as to desire
a review of such errors, as they presumed the base ends of Henry the Eighth
had let slip: And these were then persecuted (though of most exemplary lives)
whose followers God has in our days been pleased to requite with the most
miraculous success that ever crowned the endeavors of an Army. And for a
farther confirmation, that this total separation from the Pope, grew rather in
the minds of the people, then the Prince; All the endeavors they could use,
were not able to abrogate the ceremonies of Cross, Ring and Surpleece; though
confessed by all, of no more absolute necessity, then what they derived from
the breath of Authority: But their true end was, to discover such consciences
as were irreconcilable to Rome, unto which they had then, and do still drive
on a design of returning; Provided they could, by an universal conjunction of
Princes, bring the Pope to renounce the power he pretends to have over Kings,
in that which is merely temporal: And if I am not foully mistaken, the too
vigorous prosecution of this project, was the cause of the murdering the two
last Henryes of France. Therefore such as hinder the establishing a Free State,
oppose the most probable way of suppressing Superstition, and discovering
Truth; which in time will by the blessing of God, work it self into Unity.

I do not write this out of an humor of singularity, or to cast dirt upon the
Memory of Queen Elizabeth, who in my opinion deserves to be celebrated above
all the Princes I ever heard of; but to manifest this truth, That Monarchs look
upon all Religions with love or disdain, as they find them suit with their
worldly concernments. The like may be said of most of the Princes in Germany
who took part with Luther, to have a pretense to seize upon the rich
Monasteries and Lands of the Church. (And though humane policy may inject the
same thoughts into the minds of Senators, yet purity of Religion is likelier
to find friendship among many, then one.)

Neither is the small countenance the French give to those of the Reformation,
under a shallower policy, then to balance all partiality, which, the Pope may
be terrified, out of a dread of his power, to show the King of Spain, to the
French King's disadvantage; being always able by their assistance, to make
the like booty of the Gallican Church, as Henry the Eighth did of the English.

Neither had the rich revenues of the Roman Profession (which Christian Princes
have long since surveyed, as too great a patrimony for a few Priests) been
untaken in, but that the Catholic King is tied, not only by a contrary, but
a stronger interest, to keep up the Pope from a total suppression: because he
has nothing to show for the possession of diverse of his territories, and the
dispensation of so many incestuous Matches, but the power his Holiness
arrogates to make any thing lawful toward God or Man.

Yet if any desire farther satisfaction, Why Spain remains so true to the
bondage of Rome, whilst other Nations are in labor with divisions? it may be
said, That besides the Inquisition, her natural pride and affected gravity
renders her proof against Innovation; especially in order to a Profession
less splendid then her own; being, like the Jews, more delighted with well
dressed Ceremonies, then naked Truth: Neither have they any general propensity
to the study of Controversies, or the writing of any thing besides Romances, to
which the Roman Religion best suits, being replenished with the high
Rhodomontadoes of Saints and miraculous Stories.

A Monarchy both in Church and State is most suitable to the English Clergy,
whose maintenance being raised out of the sweat of the Labourer, can find none
so ready (the Pope excluded) as Princes to protect them: Commonwealths making
no such room for flattery, as Kings, to whom those Churchmen are dearest, and
readiest to be preferred by them; as having the faculty to discover Virtues
where none are, and hide Vices where they most abound: to which qualities James
and Charles were the indulgentest Princes, since the Reformation: For Queen
Elizabeth, standing fair in her Subjects opinions, was bold to make exchanges
with them to their disadvantage; The cause the sweetness of her Reign is no
more legible. This proves it madness, to expect a pure Reformation under
Kings; the Roman Religion being in all policy most necessary for them, because
they have his Holiness ready at any time, as an honorable Vmpire, friendly to
cement them together by fair means; or in case they will not agree, to
excommunicate the contumacious party: No small advantages to Kings, who
participating of the same vindictive humors with other private mortals, fall
upon most destructive wars, only to revenge personal affronts: As the last
quarrel we had with Spain, rose from no more serious a bottom, then a
misprision the Duke of Buckingham stumbled upon in his lust. And the same Kings
Expedition to the Isle of Reez had as noisome a source: which are things below
a Senate, not apt to run a madding like unadvised Princes, who are distempered
upon the least bite of a passion.

Add to what has been said, the vast sums correspondent to the charge of a
Court, and wanton affections incident to Kings; (James of England having
thrown away upon Dunbarre, Carlisle, Sommerset and Buckingham only, according
to computation two millions) and you cannot but conclude a Free State the
thriftiest Government for the people; about whom no such sums can be found,
but under the hazard of a present or future question. Besides, consider the
excessive expense the Nation would be at, to repair the utensils of a Crown,
which the charge or fate of war has exposed to sale or ruin.

We see it is the fortune of most private Families (notwithstanding their
severer education) to fall within two or three generations, under a fool, or
which is worse, one so infatuated with an immoderate thirst of pleasure, as to
hazard the cutting off the strongest Intaile: And can people be pronounced so
happy, who have no more to show for their felicity, but the crazied and
uncertain life of a King, (rarely found to be indifferently good in the first,
but ever intolerable in the second or third Descent) as a Senate, which never
dies, but grows daily more acquainted with the Constitution of the Nation;
being taught by experience how to administer to the peoples necessities?

Whose children do not remain a burden and terror to the Commonwealth, as
those of Monarchs: Which makes the Great Turk to strangle them, like Vermin;
and the Persian to put out their eyes, lest they should bewitch their Kingdoms
into seditions: as in the Annals of our English Monarchs is legible in red
letters; though many deep marks of blood have been expunged by their power,
or covered by the flattery of such as penned their Stories. And if we would
seriously consider it without prejudice, we might clearly foresee, That no
State is able (without stocking up the ancient Nobility and Gentry) to bear
the true, much less the borrowed issue of three Queens in succession so
fruitful as our last Mary: The pregnancy of whose head for mischief has not
yet been so fatal to this Nation, as her womb may prove hereafter to
Posterity; that perhaps may be ignorant how few Kings come to the Crown
unspotted with the blood of their Predecessors; And that Nature is so far
buried in their jealousies and fears, as oftentimes she cannot be heard in
behalf of her own Children; manifested in Philip the Second of Spain, who put
his own Son and Heir to death; A Tragedy since revived and acted by the same
Kings Players, upon the person of Prince Henry in England, at the especial
command, as was thought, of etc --, because he seemed averse from a Match with
the Infanta, for whose sweet sake his Brother undertook that honorable
journey into Spain; by which (not to reckon the vast expense and shame it
brought) the perpetual quiet of this Nation was in hazard. And till any can
parallel this, with a like absurdity committed by a Senate, they must excuse
all who think Monarchy not the wisest or happiest Government.

Neither are the progeny of Kings less unmindfull of their filial duty; since
it is notorious, that Lewis the XIth, and Charles his Son, were found in the
head of an Army against their Fathers, before discretion could securely entrust
them with a Sword for fear of hurting themselves: the eldest not having
attained the age of twelve years.

What Tragedies the Royal issue have acted in England, is well known: But in
Scotland they have been so frequent and dismal, that their Crown seems
rather a snare to catch unadvised fools, then a Symbol of Honor; proving as
fatal to most have worn it, as the Shirt of Hercules, the Drab had poisoned.

Though a Senate may be tempted to severity at first, out of care and love to
the people and themselves; The disturbers of peace being subdued or reformed,
it is as contrary to their natures and discretions to delight in blood, as for
a wise Physician to use Phlebotomy when the distemper is over. Whereas under a
Monarchy, the Nation runs a hazard of blouding upon every change; being ready
to fall into a Fever by the contrary humors and claims of those of the same
line; who upon the least nicety they are able to create, raise a civil and
destructive war; as between Lancaster and York, which lasted so long as the
people, out of mere poverty and weariness, were willing to sell themselves
for Slaves to the succeeding Pharaohs of the prevalent Line: And having found
such mischiefs to result from contrary claims, they, to perpetuate a single
Title, made the justest endeavors to oppose it, Treason; and so entailed a
perpetual inconvenience unto Posterity, that fell into the clutches of the Law
upon the least offer they made to free themselves from these arbitrary
Taske-masters, at whose devotion they have ever since eaten the bread of
affliction and constraint, which they might have avoided, by changing the
Government: But that, like Lucian, they lay under so strong a fascination, as
they were in their abused judgments capable of no cure, but first by
recovering a Conjunction between the Roses, and then an union with Scotland.
And though the vanity of this conceit be made apparent by 40 years contrary
experience; yet the generality cannot be wooed to assume their natural shape
of Freemen, but desire rather to remain Asses still under the heavy pressures
of a King; not considering, that the old Line is so exasperated, That if any of
it come to succeed, they cannot in Prudence or Safety, but so bush up all ways
leading never so little toward liberty, as we may well groan, but shall not
have so much as hope to be heard or redressed hereafter: When those that stand
for Kings shall receive as severe a doom as the rest, out of fear, they may
another time, be as well able and as willing to oppose as now to assist them.

After having weighed the deeds of the United Provinces, and Venice; Consider
what despicable Nations (if capable of that Title) these had been, under
absolute Princes: Or what King, deduction being made for the expense of his
Court only; (without reckoning the concomitant vanities of Play, Revels etc.
in which our last Kings spent more then they have done, in bringing home
Victory from Spain or Turkey) would be able, with so small revenues, to pay so
many Garrisons, and maintain such an Army as the Dutch have done for 80 years?
Neither is the advantage lessened by objecting the vast sums they stand
accountable for, to the Subjects of stranger Princes; which being entrusted
without paune, is the greater honor; all men's repute in the world having been
suitable to their debts: Therefore since no Prince was ever thought capable of
so much credit with his Neighbors, as to be entrusted with the like
inestimable sums; as these, and other Free States are known to be; (who are
made depositaries for the Fatherless and Widows) it is an infallible argument
of their less esteem of Kings; never found true to their nature all Subjects;
which makes none willing to lend to them, but out of fear or constraint, when
money is by heaps laid voluntarily at the feet of this more free government.
And what is to be expected from our redemption out of Monarchical thraldom, may
be guest by the words of the Kings own Agent; who urged as an inducement to
Holland, to favor his party, that if England could be free, they would be
formidable unto them, not only by interrupting their Fishing, and all other
Maritine advantages; but by robbing them of Trafick, as they had done the
Venecians: and not only so, but give Law to all Christendom, by reason of the
commodiousnesse of their harbors, and multitudes of their ships: Yet our bl --
brethren of Scotland were so liquerish after the dainty shadow of being sharers
with us in England, by the mediation of a King, they meant to have set over us,
that they let fall the substance of as great a felicity of their own; having
Sea room and greater advantages then the Hollander began with, or can yet
purely call his own.

To that obvious objection, That reason did always concede an advantage to the
absolute Jurisdiction of a single person in the field; prescribing to that end
but one General to an Army, for fear of divisions upon contrary Counsels and
Commands; May be replied, that no King had ever greater success waited on his
person, then this Government has been ordinarily presented with from her
Subjects; Who are not only heated with as great a sense of Honor, but also
moderated by that of Fear; being subject to question, as well for Victory, if
attained under too hazardous or improbable an adventure, as Loss; Whereas
Princes take liberty to expose their people, without control upon all
occasions and pretenses, though never so trivial, disadvantagious or unjust.
Neither are Generals taken up on trust, as Kings are, in successive
Monarchies, who have nothing more to show for their Legitimacy, then the word
of their Mother; nor better Reason and sufficiency for the execution of their
Regality, then that his Majesty's Father had rendered the people miserable
before him. And here I am constrained by truth to attect, That no Nation was
ever more blessed in the conduct and success of a General, then England is now;
whose valor and judgment has not only broke through such difficulties, for
which Kings were wont to Triumph; but is become so familiar with Victory, as it
may seem she dares not leave Him, for fear of being overcome her self.

Neither is the good use may be made of Kings, excluded in a Free State, but
continued; as in the Duke of Venice, and heretofore in the Prince of Orange
etc. Who have the custody of such Honors and Ceremonies, as are not, with
decency or convenience, communicable to more then one: And such a Prince is not
likely (nor in my poor judgment fit) to be kept from a Commonwealth: Provided
his admittance be with that Caution, as no trespass may be committed upon the
Peoples Liberty.

Free States have been always looked upon as most auspicious to men of parts;
Whereas Monarchs prefer a good face; the importunate recommendations of a
Mistres; or their own solitary affection; before all the desert attending upon
parts or breeding: because empty themselves, they fear to be sounded by those
more sufficient; Being as unable to resolve, as unconstant in the prosecution
of the better counsels of others; which wise men communicate to Kings with
much caution, as knowing that what they advise is upon no lighter penalty then
their ruin, if it be not as suitable to the Favorites humors as their Masters
own safety; which makes them either conceal their true judgment, or comply
with such as prefer their single interest before the Public. This renders
the best designs of Princes addle, exposing their Subjects to a succession of
evil events in the midst of their most probable advantages: A punishment
inflicted upon the generality of Kings, for their Murders, Rapines and
Blasphemies; it being rare for any of them to hold their Principalities from a
more legitimate Tenure, then Poison or the Knife; their births being so
sophisticated by the surer side, That they have oftentimes no more of the blood
Royal in them, then the consent they lent to their Predecessors destruction
has clogged their consciences withal. And if the possession of the Crown
alone be esteemed sufficient, in the sense of the Law, to expunge the grossest
spots yet found in any that wore it; may it not as well charifie a Republic
from any imputation can be objected to the means they ascended by? It being the
custom of all supreme powers; to shape their Result, to the pattern, Prudence
and success has cut out for them, and not according to the fashion of old
formalities; so little regarded by Princes as the oath was never yet sworn but
they have broken; nor Stipulation so strong as to hold, when they saw the least
advantage before them: They have therefore the less cause to complain, being
only whipped with their own Rod; or like Haman rather, who was the justlier
executed, because it was upon the same Gibbet, he had set up for the people of
God.

Therefore if men will not render themselves deaf to the voice of Providence,
in no worldly thing so audible as a continued success; They may conclude, what
is done, is by the approbation of God himself: He having manifested his power
as well on the high and barren hills of Scotland, as in the fat and rich
valleys of England and Ireland: Neither are his blessings wanting in the deep,
where our Navies are no less successful, then our Armies on the Land; Though
looked on with an evil eye, and cursed by the Kings of the Nations: whom the
same God has so weakened or employed as they have had no power or leisure to
do us hurt.

So as he that after all this, shall seem to apprehend more Divinity lost in a
King succeeding by Conquest etc. Then may be found in a State (using as decent
a proceedure, as can be expected in such a conjuncture, and from so many
implacable humors and oppositions,) cannot but be blinded by Passion, or some
selfeish interest: For though Government may be by Divine Institute; yet This
or That is as indifferent, as whether your clothes be made after the Dutch or
the French fashion; It being sufficient, if They defend us from the injuries of
the Weather, and This protect us against our enemies; and prevent Sin and
Disorder, the true occasions of all Government.

I do not find particular Interests, that are useful and safe, much worsted
by this change: For if our ancient Nobility consider how basely they were
trampled upon by those two beggarly Princes Rupert and Maurice; who had nothing
to bear the charges of their Pride, but the charity of those they scorned, and
the gracious aspect of a Uncle, who could not love them, but for his own ends;
What precedence or Honor could they have expected, had the Royal Issue been
dilated to the probable number in three Descents it might have attained to,
whereas now there is no likelihood, any more will be made; it not being suitable
to Republiques to give honors of that Magnitude; Though those few, the cruelty
of the Catholic King left in the Netherlands, still retain the same Dignities
and Possessions, the State found them in; As I doubt not but th^se may do
here, if the implacablenesse of their Spirits do not render them unworthy of
that favor; in thinking it not felicity enough, To be free from oppression
themselves; unless they be in such a condition, as they may exercise with
impunity a Tyrannical power upon others; as formerly they did; when like
burning glasses, they multiplied the heat of the Kings Oppressions.

It is a wonder to me, to see, how nice they are now of their Honors; And what
a scruple they make of submitting to this power, not to be denied Superlative;
when I remember how basely I have seen them, or their Fathers, lying at the
feet of the Court Minnion; scrambling for his durty Neeces; not leaving Innes,
Shopps, and (if not belied) worse places, unsought, to find some of his femall
Kindred, for their Heites: Forgetting that he is more Noble, who has ventured
his Life for Liberty; then he that has nothing to show for his Honor, but a
good face, or an Acquittance for so much money.

Look upon our General in his Cradle, and you shall find him as good a
Gentleman; as most of these (one of that House and Name having been a
principal Instrument in overturning those Hives of Drones, and freeing us from
the tyranny of the Pope:) But consider him in his Saddle, and you will think
such low spirits unworthy to be his footmen: If he has any faults, they lie
neither in his Valor, Conduct, Prudence, nor Humanity: Being as far from Pride
as Baseness; and known to be as faithful in the Preservation of his friends, as
Providence has made him successful in the subversion of his enemies. I had
not writ this, for fear of being accused of Flattery; but that I know he is so
employed in purchasing new Honors, and settling this Nation, that he has not
the leisure to hear what he has already deserved.

Concerning the Interest of the Ministry; I mean such as have no other end,
then the glory of God; They may be more happy under this, then Monarchical
Government: For though sublimer Titles (the Diana of more licentious times) be
taken away; yet since the Kingdom of Jesus Christ is promised to be set up in
the place; They ought with patience to expect; Assuring themselves, That God
would never give so miraculous success to men designed for the ruin of Truth.
Neither is it suitable with the rest of the Prudence used by those who have the
absolute power of determining, to take away the decent maintenance of the
Ministers of the Gospel, or to demolish the Universities: But rather hold the
hands of such as, like blind Samson might go about to pull them down and ruin
their own selves by their folly and indiscretion.

It is past humane prevention, That two factions, both so fruitful in Learning
as the Protestant and Papist, should not fall into so many subdivisions; as it
is impossible to keep them all in Unity, Under a less severe restraint, then
an Inquisition (as repugnant to charity, as unsuitable to the spirits of a free
people); Or else by enjoying so indulgent a Liberty, as may leave every
Conscience free (All civil Obedience presupposed as due to the present
Government). Now such as conclude from this Permission, That the Catholics
will then in a short time Master all; Do not consider, how much easier Oxen
are kept out of a Pasture, then Conies or Hares: The Papist having rendered
himself so unsociable to all opinions but his own, as he is detested in
Amsterdam, where the Jews find as good, if not better protection.

Therefore the United Provinces and all other Free States, whose Foundations
were laid under the mixed occasion of maintaining Religion and Liberty
together; are not reprovable for making use of, and indulging tender
Consciences, though they retain some things superfluous, or have not yet the
strength to concoct into practice, all things necessary: For as Rome was not
built in a day; so it is as impossible to pull it down in so short a time.

Wherefore I desire men to be more charitable in their censures; since the
Primitive Christians were so far Independent, That they retained only so much
of the Truth, as the tyranny of those times, and the stronger or weaker light
they walked by, gave them opportunity to snatch up. Some running away with a
belief of the Holy Ghost; others without so much as ever hearing of such a
thing: some with simple Baptism; others with a mixture of Circumcision: Some
with the bare knowledge of the Baptism of John, yet judged mighty in the
Scriptures: Some with a religious respect to Days and Meats; others without
it. And yet Paul is so far from reproving them, that he attests, it was all
done to the Lord. Neither is it less manifest, that they all did teach: And if
the same Apostle would never eat Flesh rather then offend a weak brother,
what charity appears in those High Presbyterians, that clamor for a Coercive
power, as Saul did before his conversion, that they might deliver these men
bound. I would feign have them tell me, What is meant by building with Hay,
Straw, Stubble etc; which shall raise at least the Builders to heaven; provided
Christ the Foundation be kept: And if so, let us take heed, least a woe do not
follow the scandalizing these men, who without doubt are our Saviors little
ones. And since we cannot recover the whole seamles coat of Christ's
righteousness, let us not despise any, about whom we find the undeniable
pieces, though spotted with the frailties of humanity.

The last Interest is the Peoples; which if not already better under this
present Government, then a Kings, they may thank themselves, who by their own
intemperance and noncompliance, occasion the major part of these heavy taxes;
Which the State can take no pleasure in raising, Their own lands being as
obnoxious to them, as the meanest Subjects.

Therefore if all would willingly submit to the power, God has set over them,
The Tradesman might live free from being interrupted by Monopolies; and the
Husbandman, from the rapine of Purvoyers, Comissaries, Dear, Carriages,
Shipmony, Wardships, and an innumerable number of other illegal impositions.

Whereas otherwise it is impossible to make a Nation happy, that is resolved to
be miserable; and to seek their own ruin by hating to be Reformed.

FINIS.
