A Plea for Moderation in the Armies Transactions.
UPon reading of that Paper called Proposals for Peace and Freedom offered to
Commissary General Ireton, for the concurrence of the Army by diverse worthy
Citizens of the Common Council, and others, and upon much weighing the matter,
I discover something of the substance thereof, and in regard of the strength of
reason, even in all things therein touching the present condition of the state
of things now with us, (it being the only wisdom to look at what best may
be, and not at the narrow desires that every man's will coveteth) and as to the
honesty thereof; I conceive no reasonable man of what party soever, unless the
prodigal, or such as desires to live by the ruin of others, can say that
there is any thing which tends to any other then the sure contrivance for the
settlement of a happy peace, and the maintenance of the due and equal
propriety and freedom of all men: wherefore I have thought meet to observe,
that first they conclude the King to be the person that has brought this woe,
misery, and lamentable distraction upon the three Kingdoms. Secondly, that
they conclude into that true Maxim of the Law, that whatsoever is not just in
the beginning, cannot be made just by any Custom of the longest continuane
whatsoever; and therefore do first adjudge him guilty of all the blood and
ruin of England and Ireland. Secondly, that they are desirous that all
usurpations and encroachments upon the peoples Liberties whatsoever, may be
immediately taken away: and perhaps may believe with me, that Kings Courts are
the fountains from whence the streams of excess do flow, and (that Kings
are the Beasts spoken of in the Revelation of John) that thereby devour the
people, and thither also do the subtillest serpents resort, and by their
supreme power sting (even unto death) the rest of the silly beasts of the
mountains, and it is they that turn the grace of God into wantonness and a
lie, exalting with the horn of honor the covetous, the Extortioner, the
Damner, Swearer, Whorer, Gamester, Cheater, Liar, and lascivious Prodigalls, to
the banishment of godliness and true virtue, and all such as (according to the
only end for which they were borne) endeavoure righteousness for the good of
their generation. But considering the great dubiousnesse of the best of men,
and that three Kingdoms concentereth in one Crown, and that through the union
thereby since King James came first into England, their Riches as well in Trade
as Revenue were (before the war) increased not less then fourfold. Secondly,
that none of the three can be highly happy without peace in all. Thirdly, that
our old foundations of Government in reference as aforesaid, cannot be mended,
except in the free and more equal choice of the Representative. Fourthly, that
since it has pleased God that a solemn National Covenant has been made and
remains between Scotland and us, whereby that Nation requires mercy on the
behalf of the King as due thereby. Fifthly, for that God is a God of mercy,
and not of punishment, unless as they say, it will in reason convert into
mercy. Sixthly, for that their provisions for peace and freedom against all
Tyranny is in reason unviolable through a general agreement to be founded by
this great and honorable City (out of Arms) upon as certain provisions
therein as can be laid down. Seventhly, that the union between the Scots and us
may be preserved, and their peace settled as well as ours. Eighthly the sudden
reducement of Ireland. Ninthly, the conviction of all the particular parties of
the pure Parliament Interest, together again. Tenthly, although it cannot be
imagined that godly Statesmen will intend the alteration of a Government for
the worse, for that is not to be expected at the hands of the most evil
Machivillians, for by the goodness of the things laid down must their
supportation in strength, honor, and fame be. But necessity has ever been
observed to force the fairest promising Statesmen upon alterations of the
Government of Nations into the height of Tyranny and cruelty, especially where
a new Government is ushered in by fear, that opposite to love and freedom,
nor can the accomplishment thereof be expected by this generation. And though
extreme wars could be avoided, yet cannot imprisonment, hanging, heading,
hunger-pining of thousands, nay likely ten thousands, and in the end may the
work come into as evil hands as this Tyrant, at large, our present King; but
in the Cities way there is nothing but certainties in reason, for binding their
Kings with chains, and their Nobles with links of iron, yet by a sweet yoke,
and pleasant bonds to the producement of their greatness peace and honor, as
well as the peoples. Eleventhly, I further observe, that the King deserved
death even long before the wars through the violations of our Laws, his Oath
and Covenant (besides that of his Father) but more especially for all the evil
done in the first war, until August and September, 1647. when notwithstanding
he was concluded to be the same in resolution, touching the evil of his heart,
as at first, when notwithstanding so great tenderness was had not only of his
life, but to his Negative voice also. And wherefore now if more could not be
fought for, or expected as to freedom, then may be had by the continuance of
his life, much better then by his death, as if mentioned by all the foregoing
reasons, why then may not mercy be afforded him, and not to run the hazard of
destruction and confusion to the whole three Nations. And again for that the
Prince and Duke of York are both abroad, therefore must we not only expect
present contests and Wars with Scotland and Ireland, but with most of the
Adjacent Princes in Europe, which cannot but immediately destroy our old and
famous Trade of Merchandise; For which considerations, as also for the
supportation of those hundreds of thousands of People of this City, and
likewise for the mainenance of the manufactory of the whole Kingdom, must the
Citizens be for ever reputed both pious, moderate and wise, if again they
press forward herein. In their Paper I further observe, that they would have
the King disarmed of those two poisoning swords of destruction, whereby all
Princes (together with their serpents about them) destroy the Nations, viz. the
power of dignifying with Offices, and also with Titles of honor, whomsoever
best serves their lusts; and indeed should he have been brought in naked,
these two excepted, if the Parliament should have continued but a few years
longer, it would not have been difficult and hard unto him (by those two baits
of honor) to have drawn the Angels of heavenly knowledge and stars of great
light unto the earth again, when having courted in the idolized and deisi'd
heads of the particular parties, the rest following of course, would thus have
made the Nation slaves of what degree soever he had pleased: Is any thing for
Nations freedom like bonds to Ambition? And were it but the fashion for Kings
to discountenance vice, and dignifie virtue, they would then merit their
Crowns, for which only end they first had them; for then would righteousness
and virtue shine forth in the Nation, as the fashionable things; and debauchery
and excess fall to disdain. They also in their Paper have sufficiently
provided for a godly preaching Ministry, with an augmentation of more then one
third of that of old, by avoiding the Ministers accustomed charge of gathering
and converting Tithes, as the avoiding of suite, trouble and contention
thereupon, besides the more equal consideration for the labors and pains of
those that shall be appointed thereto, which although not the same with the
Scots, yet for that it wholly thwarteth not the Covenant (not admitting the
civil Magistrate a Judge in point of conscience) is well relished by them,
notwithstanding a general Liberty of Conscience to all godly conscientious
walkers; protesting against the State-destroying Tenants as to peace and
freedom not only of Popery, Episcopacie, and all Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction,
by Courrs and Offices to that purpose. And did they think that the punitive
power mentioned by them in their Remonstrance of June 1647. in point of
Conscience, had even justly brought these great evils upon them and the
Nation, but not find that is not the thing, as witness the judgment of some
powerful persons in debate, and yiedling the thing, if it would have been
accepted on in another (though a worser) manner. Their Noble care that the
soldiery in general may be paid all their Arreares due unto them, and so as
cannot but be to the great advantage of the State by improvement of that
wilful wast formerly made, as may soon be some millions to the benefit of the
State; as also to the well pleasing both of Lord and Tenant, and the gladding
and making joyful of the hearts of many thousands of the poor that are now
ready (even daily) to perish with want, and are not only contented that the
renowned Army should be presently satisfied, and by lands paid as follows,
viz. for every year that every Trooper is in arreare, or proportionable in
time thereunto, the sum of four pounds during his life, without defalcation
of free quarter; and that every Foot-Souldier that is in arreare, may have
fifty shillings a year for every year due unto him, during his life, with
proportion to time as to the Horse aforesaid; and without defalcation for
free quarter also; and that those which shall be thought meet by the general
Council of the Army to be dismissed for Ireland, have the Fee-simple thereof to
them and their heirs for ever. And it is now commonly spoken in the City, they
are further content, that what was formerly assigned to the Soldiery for term
of life, may be conferred upon them for ever: And that those that shall be
dismissed to Ireland, as aforesaid, may have their proportions increased to one
fourth part more then is now assigned; and will also upon security of the
intended lands for that purpose, if the general Council shall think meet, pay
in ready money all such arreares as shall be due either to any Officer or
soldier, by order from the general Council aforesaid: And further, I
conceive, greater endeavors for the preservation of the Armies honor and
interest, both in England and Ireland, cannot be expected, beyond what is laid
down in the Cities paper of Proposalls: and do they expect their chiefest
safety to be concerned in them, as further appears by that power reposed in
that excellent and honorable Committee for the dispose of all Offices,
degrading, and dignifying with titles of honor all such as pleases that
Committee: But if what is desired by the honorable Citizens may not be
permitted, but that wars must still be our portion, or a settlement by the
Sword only, we cannot expect better then in all the world besides, viz. that
how just soever the Government is chalked out and intended to be, yet must we
have no more thereof meted unto us, then the leading persons of State will in
the future be pleased to afford us: and may it be our portion with Germany,
where the People have by right of Agreement, not only the choice of their
Emperor, and many of their Kings and Princes, but of their Laws also, yet may
not according to truth have choice in either, but are lamentable slaves; for it
is not as Laws are made, but as the Power pleases, that puts them in
execution, whether to call truth falsehood, or falsehood truth, as witness our
introachments and usirpations by false Judges that have brought forth all these
our distractions, to obtain honor from the Beast: And in this, and this only
rests, and wholly depends our Freedom; viz. to endeavor and obtain the
avoiding of all force and Wars, whereby we may without delay put our now
known Rights in execution, to the present commanding of King, Lords, and
People to an immediate obedience upon the present incurment of the strictest
penalty of the Law, and when we be at Peace: then will the severity of
punishing the breakers of the National Law (for the preservation of the
public Peace) convert into mercy. But when commotions are, and (that there
be many parties in a Nation, and not any one of which, were they uppermost, but
would destroy the rest (or so many of the rest as should best please) even by a
Law, and be cried up too (by their party) for pure Justice, in this case ought
the motion of the distempered waters, I mean the People, to be truly observed,
and for them that will profess Christ, to endeavor as mediators to lay the
distempers, and if they in reason see that advantage to a happy peace maybe
obtained by sparing of one or more of the leaders of one party, (and the like
of another) after whom God has been pleased to suffer the hearts perhaps of
thousands, 10. thousands, or millions of people to be drawn out after, (though
by a delusion or a lie as some may call it, yet as they or some of them may
conceive truth) and that thereby the boisterous falt waves may cease further to
swell, until a conjunction by fresh-waters may in time happily refine them;
this rule of Christianity and reason. And through the freedom and
frequentnesse of Parliaments, will all, not only all old and beastly customs
be avoided, and evil Laws repealed, but what is best and most seasonable for
a general good, be provided for; as also if honest men be chosen for Members
thereof, (perhaps) they may act honest things for 5. or 6. months for Gods
sake, If knaves (for the Peoples) for Popularity sake, nor will any have
opportunity to act much evil in so short a time; and what is not well done in
one Parliament, will be mended in the next: for by the frequentnesse thereof,
will all men be acquainted with what is freedom, and what is slavery, and
where the Breach is, which by long sitting of Parliaments, or the long
vacations thereof, (as woeful experience teaches the Nation) a forced
ignorance to the destruction of Freedom must follow.

This I thought necessary to speak touching some few particulars, of the Paper
of the Citizens Proposalls, and could I earnestly desire that the godly
Officers of the Army and soldiers also would view them well, especially all
such as look not asquint (as the floating Courtyer used to do that neither
looked back to his Father, or on the right or left hand to his Brothers,
Sisters, Kinsfolk and acquaintance: Or to what may ensue to his Childrens
Children, and others of the Generations to come) and would show what is wanting
therein to the settlement of the present peace with the maintenance of all due
and equal propriety, and unalterable Freedom, to all ensuing Posterities
(theirs and the private soldiers Honorable and great reward with more
certainties then otherwise themselves can propose) but if the matters proposed
be unanswerable in reason, that then they would endeavor the acceptance
thereof.

Friends, it is my burden, that the actions of Christ have been so much
neglected by some whose name is so precious in their mouths, that their
righteousness and humility shines not forth after that manner, as the Beams
thereof might melt the name of all other Kings, and whereby I am forced to be an
Advocate for the Title of a King, whose name I abhor as they are the
standards of Ambition, and Fountains of excess, to the destruction of the
Nations: But of two evils the lesser is to be chosen; and when yesterday
cannot be called again, let the best be made of the day present: and it is
more safe to have to do with a musled Lion, then a tame serpent.

FINIS.
