TWO PETITIONS OF THE Sequestered Clergy of England and Wales.

ONE, To the Kings most excellent Majesty: THE OTHER, To Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX.

WITH The Declaration of the General, and his Council of War thereupon.

AS ALSO, His Majesty's Proclamation against Intruding into other men's Cures,
and detaining their Tithes.

LONDON, Printed for Richard Royston, August 2. 1647.

To the Kings most Excellent Majesty.
The Humble Petition of many thousands of Your Majesty's loyal Subjects, the
poor sequestered Clergy of England and Wales,
Humbly shows,
THat whereas your Petitioners have a long time been destitute of all
liveli-hood, by means of sequestration of their Estates and other losses, and
are at present driven to extreme necessities how to provide for themselves and
their families, and the season now approaching for the receiving the benefits of
the Harvest before which time, if some charitable course be not taken, they are
like to starve or beg another year.

May it therefore please Your most Sacred Majesty to take our sad condition
into Your Gracious consideration and care, that some course may be taken for
our speedy relief, as may preserve us alive, and enable us to do more service
in Gods Church to Your Majesty and the Kingdom.

And as in duty bound, we shall ever pray for Your Majesty's happy
establishment, and long and prosperous Reign.
This Petition was delivered to His Majesty, on Saturday July 17. by two of the
sequestered Clergy, employed by others of their Brethren to prosecute this
business. His Majesty very graciously expressed himself how deeply sensible he
was of their condition, and bid them rest assured, that whatsoever was in his
power for their relief, should not be wanting; but for the present all that he
could do, was to recommend the Petition to the General and the Commanders of
the Army; which accordingly he did both by special Messengers, and by word of
mouth at several times.

Hereupon this Petition ensuing was delivered to the General, and Copies
thereof left with some of the chief Commanders.

To His Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax.
The Humble Petition of many thousands of the poor sequestered Clergy of
England and Wales,
Humbly shows,
THat whereas the eyes of all the oppressed people of the Kingdom are fixed
upon Your Excellency and the Army, as the great Instruments (under God) to
restore them to their legal Rights and Liberties, which they do justly ground
upon Your several Declarations published to the World.

And whereas your Petitioners (a considerable number of the freeborn men of
this Kingdom) have been for diverse years outed of their livelihood and
free-holds, contrary to Magna Charta, and other fundamental Laws of the Land,
by the arbitrary power of Committees; whose proceedings usually have been by no
Rule of any known Law, but by their own wills: of whose orders no Record is
kept, nor scarce any notes or memorials, whereby it may appear when, by whom,
or for what your Petitioners were removed, the Committee: for scandalous and
for plundered Ministers (by whom the greatest part are turned out) being
grounded not so much as upon any Ordinance of both Houses; the most of your
Petitioners outed for refusing the Covenant, or adhering to the King and the
Religion established according to their Judgments and Consciences; and, of
those, diverse never called to answer, scarce one had any Articles proved by
oath, or other legal process, and some put out upon private information given
to the Chairman Mr. White: by which unheard of proceedings not to be paralleld
in any age, Your Petitioners, who have lived heretofore in good esteem,
according to their Calling, Degrees, Birth and Education, are reduced to
extreme misery and want, with their Wives and children, that they must either
starve or beg, if some speedy course be not taken for their relief. And
whereas those, who are put into our places, labor by all means to stir up the
people to involve this Kingdom in a new war, and are generally men ignorant
and unable to instruct the People, and many of them scandalous in their
practices, if impartially examined, and diverse of them bold three or four of
the best Benefices, whilst diverse other Churches are void and without any
constant Preacher: And Your Petitioners are ready to submit themselves for
their Rights to trial by the known Laws of the Land, and if any appear guilty
of any legal scandal (which we know to have been unjustly charged upon many,
and is a great part of their present sufferings) we shall leave them to
undergo the severest punishment and censure, which by any known Law can be
inflicted.

And forasmuch as the maine profits of our Benefices consist in the Harvest,
which is now at hand; which many of the present possessors, if they could
receive, would presently be gone, whereby the burden of the Cure will lie upon
Your Petitioners, having nothing to live upon all the next year.

Your Petitioners therefore Humbly pray, that Your Excellency would be pleased
to make stay of the Profits of this Harvest, in such way as Your Excellency
shall think fit, that such as are charged with any legal scandal, may come to a
just trial, and both they (if they be found innocent) and the rest, may enjoy
their Rights, and have the benefit of Subjects, according to the known Law of
the Land, and Your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc.
Upon the delivery of this Petition, the matter was debated at a Council of
War, July 19. and afterward by the Prosecutors of the Clergy, and others whom
His Majesty had entrusted herewith, with the General, Lieutenant-Generall,
Commissary-Generall, and others at several meetings; And the result of all in
conclusion was this:

That whereas the General and his Council of War had resolved to send a
Proposition or Declaration to the Parliament, that the estates of all
sequestered persons should remain in the hands of the Tenants and occupiers,
until a general peace be settled, That this Proposition should extend to the
Clergy as well as others, so as to include the Tithes, and all other
Ecclesiastical profits due to them, to remain in the hands of the
Parishioners, or others their Tenants or occupiers, until the said public
settlement. And accordingly the said Declaration was drawn up, and agreed upon
by the General and Council of War, upon Thursday, July 22. to this effect,
viz.

That the estates of all persons, of what rank or condition soever, whether
real or personal, under any sequestration, howsoever or to whomsoever disposed,
shall remain in the hands of the Tenants, Parishioners, or any other persons
from whom they are legally due, until the general peace be settled, and then
to be restored and accounted for, to those to whom they shall be justly and
legally due.

This Proposition, which by reason of the present distractions hopning since in
the Parliament, has been hindered from passing by way of Ordinance, is thought
fit to be now published in regard of the present Harvest, as containing a
Declaration of the sense of the Army, grounded upon apparent equity and
justice, that so as well the Parishioners, as the Intruders, and all others
whom it does concern, may take notice thereof, and conform themselves
thereunto; and that the Parishioners may prevent thereby such further
Inconveniences as may happen to them, if they shall pay the dues of this
Harvest justly belonging to the rightful Incumbents, to any unjust and
usurping Intruders. Which that they may be the better fore-warned of, they may
take notice of His Majesty's Proclamation to this purpose formerly published by
Royal authority, and still in force, and now reprinted, as follows:

C R
HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal English blazon or coat of arms By the KING. A
Proclamation against the Oppression of the Clergy by the Intrusion of Factious
and Schismatic Persons into their Cures, and inverting and detaining their
Tithes and Possessions by Orders of one or both Houses of Parliament, contrary
to all Law and Justice.
WHereas by the great Charter of the Liberties of England it is provided, that
the Church should have all its Rights whole, and Liberties inviolable; and
amongst others the Church has these privileges, That regularly no
Ecclesiastical Possessions may be extended, seized or sequestered but by the
Ordinary, And that Distresses may not be taken of Lands wherewith Churches have
been anciently endowed: And that Churches presentative cannot be filled, and
the lawful Incumbents thereof removed but by the Ordinary, nor the Cure of the
Incumbents served by Curats, Lecturers, or others, but by their own
appointment, or in their default by the appointment of the Ordinary; neither
are any of Our Subjects of the Laity by the Common Laws of Our Realm capable
to take or receive Tithes (which are the portion of the Clergy) unless by
demise from them, or such as are appropriate and made Lay-Fee: Nevertheless by
color of Orders or pretended Ordinances of one or both Houses of Parliament,
the Estates Real and Personal as well of Our Clergy as Laity have been and
are daily seized, sequestered and taken from them, and their Possessions
distrained for illegal Taxes and Contributions for supporting the Rebellion
against Us: Which being clearly against law and unwarrantable, We did forbid by
Our Proclamation of the seventh of April last, and do hereby forbid the same,
under the penalties in that Our Proclamation contained. And whereas diverse of
Our Clergy eminent for their Piety and Learning, because they publish Our
lawful and just Commands and Declarations, and will not, against the known
Laws of the Land and their own Consciences, submit to Contributions, nor
publicly pray against Us and Our Assistants, but conform themselves to the
Book of Common Prayer established by Law, and preach Gods Word according to the
purity thereof, and in their Sermons will not teach Sedition, nor will publish
illegal Commands and Orders for fomenting the unnatural War levied against
Us, are some of them driven and forced from their Cures and Habitations, some
others frienced and discharged from the exercise of their Cures, and
persecuted; and their Curats, if Orthodox, or placed, and others, who are
Factious and Schismatical intruded and put in, to sow Sedition, and seduce Our
good Subjects from their obedience, expressly contrary to the Word of God, and
the Laws of the Land; and the Glebes, Tithes, and other emoluments of right
belonging to such Incumbents as will not conform to that Faction, are diverted
in all Parishes where such Arbitrary power prevails, and distributes, part to
such lacious Curates, and the rest to the maintenance of this War, against Law
and the Liberties of the Church: Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, and We do
hereby straily charge and command all Our Subjects, as well Ecclesiastical as
Temporal, not to presume to intermeddle in discharging or hindering any of Our
said Clergy for the cause aforesaid, or any other the like pretenses, or any
of them from the exercise of their Cures and Functions, or in displacing the
said Curats substituted by them: nor do presume to intrude or cause any
Curats, Lecturers or others, to be intruded or put into such Cures; or to take
or dispose the Glebes, Tithes, Fruits or Emoluments belonging to any of Our
said Clergy, who are so silenced, forced from their Cures, and persecuted as
aforesaid. And We do hereby require and command all Our Subjects duly to set
forth and pay their Tithes to their several and respective lawful Incumbents
of their Parishes, or to their Farmors, Assigns, or Deputies, without any
guilt or fraud, and so as the same may be received and enjoyed by the same
Incumbents, without any diminution, substraction or diversion, notwithstanding
any sequestration or pretended Orders or Ordinances, or other command
whatsoever of one or both Houses of Parliament. And if any person or persons
whatsoever shall presume to transgress this Our Command, We do hereby declare
and signify, That they do not only oppugn and infringe the good old Laws
of the Land, and the Liberties of the Church (which all Our Subjects, as well
as Our Self, are bound to maintain and observe) but do also assist a
Rebellion against Us, for which We shall proceed against them according to Law,
as they shall be apprehended and brought to the hands of Justice, and will give
direction for taking their Lands and Goods into safe custody in the mean time.

And We do hereby farther straightly command and require all Churchwardens,
Sides-men and Parishioners whatsoever, to resist such persons as shall be so
intruded or put in into any of the Cures aforesaid, by or upon pretext of any
such pretended Orders or Ordinances or commands as aforesaid, and to assist (as
much as in them lies) the lawful Incumbents, their Curats, Farmors, Assigns
or Deputies, in the receiving, taking and enjoying the Glebe, Tithes, Fruits
and Emoluments to them of right belonging. Willing and commanding all
Sheriffs, Mayors, Bayliffes, Justices of Peace, Constables, Head-boroughs, and
other Our Officers and loving Subjects whatsoever, upon their Allegiance, and
the severest punishment that by the Law may be inflicted upon them, not only
to obey and observe carefully these Our commands, but to be aiding and
assisting to the utmost of their power to all such persons as shall require
their assistance and protection in this behalf, and to resist and repel, by
force of Arms, all such as shall oppose this Our Legal command. And Our Will
and Pleasure is, That this Our Proclamation be read in all Churches and
Chappells in this Our Kingdom. Given at Our Court at Oxford, the fifteenth day
of May, in the nineteenth year of Our Reign.

God save the King.
