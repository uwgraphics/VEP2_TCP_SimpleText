The Resolutions of the Army, against the King, Kingdom and City.
July 15. 1648. at 8 of the Clock in the Morning.
MEMORANDVM, That upon the day above set, John Dias one of Colonel Whaleys
Regiment, and Kinsman, did utter these speeches following:

That the resolution of the Army was to fight for themselves, against all that
should oppose them; and that they resolved not to be governed by a King, and
that nothing vexed them more, then the Parliaments recalling their Declarations
of making no more addresses to the King.

And being asked why they did not declare; he answered,

That yet it was no time, but that shortly, he did not doubt, but that all
would be their own, and then they would make their resolutions known.

It was replied, that if the Army should thus declare, it was likely the City
and Kingdom would rise. He answered,

They regarded not the City, but could fire it at pleasure.

It was likewise inquired, How the General had performed his word with the
King and Kingdom, in re-establishing the King, and restoring the Kingdom to
peace. He answered,

The General never intended any such thing; and that for the personal Treaty
the Army would not suffer it, because the City would think they gained the
honor of it; and that the Parliament did Vote the personal Treaty only to
delude the people, and to keep them in suspense while they had done their
business abroad.

He likewise said, He should (or hoped) to see the City on fire shortly. He
further said, That if the Kings Revenew were ten times so much more, it were
the better for them; for the Crown Land would make many of the soldiers
Gentlemen: and if we conquer you, then you shall be our slaves; and if you
conquer us, we will be your slaves; and further he said, that this was not only
his sense, but likewise the sense of the whole Army.
