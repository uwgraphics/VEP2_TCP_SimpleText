A PETITION OR DECLARATION, Humbly desired to be presented to the view of His
most Excellent Majesty; By all his MAJESTY'S most Loyal and Dutiful Subjects.

Showing the great danger and inconveniences that will happen both to the King
and Kingdom, if either His Majesty or His People desert His Grand and most
faithful Council, the High Court of Parliament.



London Printed, 1642.

A MOST HUMBLE PETITION, AND DECLARATION.
Humbly shows
THat his Majesty having first declined, and after deserted and since by force
of Arms prepared to invade his Great Council (as we conceive) does now expect
a concurrence therein according to several messages and commands, not only
from diverse persons of both houses of Parliament, but also from all his loving
Subjects, amongst whom we of the City of London are no inconsiderable n^mber.

That we conceive (as the case now stands) that it cannot be, but a most
impious and mischievous thing in us, either to forsake, or by arms to seek the
d^struction of that sacred Court; for these Reasons.

First, because in former ages this Kingdom has very seldom relinquisht its
representative, elected, entrusted Council, and when it has, it has soon
found cause to repent that Treachery, and instability, and commonly that
Repentance proved fatal both to King and kingdom.

Secondly, That private Council by which his Majesty is incensed against his
general Council, ^bscures it self from the world; neither the^ names nor
qualities, nor their grounds of exception are declared or avowed. And since his
Majesty is now attended by so many Peers, Counselors of state, Judges, and
Lawyers, and has sufficient Forces to commence war, and cannot be imagined
to obey the conduct of mere private reason, in a matter of such transcendent
consequence, we a^e apt to think, that the promoters of this horrid war
would not conceal themselves and their grounds, if they were not Papists,
Prelates, Delinquents, necessitous Courtiers, or such mercinary Swordmen, as no
Nation nor age ever expected faith or piety from. And there is a rumor here
spread, that diverse of the Nobles now in his Majesty's train departed not from
hence without great solicitation, and have not that freedom now of advice, or
of access to his Majesty, or recesse to the Parliament, as was expected, nor
does any thing under their hands publicly testify, how fare they adjudge this
Parliament traiterous, or this war against it justifiable. And yet policy,
justice, honor must needs enforce this, and does challenge it both from his
Majesty and from them.

Thirdly, we having lived nearer and been more jealously intentive eye and
ear witnesses of Parliamentary proceedings, then remoter count^ies, have not
been able to discover any disloyalty in the major part of Lords and Commons,
but on the contrary, have seen all the slanders of their enemies, detected of
villainous falsehood and malice, as in the maine matters of engrossing the
public treasure to their own use, or seeking to corrupt the Militia of the
Land, that thereby they might tirannize over King and kingdom, we believe, we
see, we know the contrary, and so must needs all sober men.

Fourthly, if his Majesty did not rely upon allegations without proofs, and
if those allegations also were not full of uncertaintie and insuffiency many
times, no blood need to be shed in this difference, a legal debate even in
Parliament it self would sift out the truth to the satisfaction of all the
kingdom, and neither the Orators tongue, nor the soldiers arm (whom none but
times very calamitous use to employ) need here to be engaged: for sometimes
his Majesty professes to have honorable thoughts concerning the Parliament,
blaming only the too great influence which some malignant party has upon
both houses, yet his Majesty names no malignants, nor specifies the nature of
that influence; sometimes his Majesty charge by name some few of each House,
and promises particular charges, but publishes none, sometimes his Majesty
inveigheth against some particular Votes of the mayor part of both Houses,
condemning them as treasonable, and apparently illegal, but takes no issue,
nor assigns any legal trial, nor allows any appeal from his own breast
and Sword, and though in very te^rmes no war is confessed against the
Parliament, yet it is mamanifestly levied against Sir John Hotham, etc. for
being an Actor under the Parliament, and treason is fixed upon all such as obey
the ordinance of both Houses: and yet both Houses themselves must not be
thought to be aimed at; and as there is uncertaintie in the parties charged so
there is the like in the crimes imputed, for sometimes the ordinance concerning
the Militia, bears the burden of all, sometimes some other plots and
conspiracies of bringing in an arbitrary power, and Aristocraticall usurpation
over King and kingdom, both are intimated, and a more satisfactory narration
of particulars are promised, but we see no such thing as yet pe^formed. And
thus the case not being yet rightly stated, nor the certain traitors nominated
nor the certain treasons declared, nor any other interpreter of Law, but his
Majesty alone without any of his Peers or Judges admitted, yet we are moved
to betray that treshault assembly, whom all law, conscience and interest, nay,
all that is sacred or can be near or dear unto us, binds us to defend with
our lives, till we are clearly convinced of their falsehood to us.

Fifthly, diverse exceptions taken against the Parliament much insisted on, as
that they may vote the King to be at London when he is at York, or declare
treason to be loyalty, and loyalty treason, etc. savor of mere merriment,
and require no other answer, if the sadness of the times would allow it, for
though general consent enable the Parment very far, whilst it is not abused,
yet that being all the Basis of their power when that shall fall away (as it
does when grossly abused) all derivative power vanishes with it; and Story tells
us that the Kingdom s^metimes has causelessly out of levetie and love of
noveltie, betrayed the Parliament, but no Age ever saw one Parliament that
proved treacherous to the whole kingdom.

Sixthly, as we see none but good fruits in this public Council, so we see
none but bad in its private opposite, for when we see his Majesty at the same
time raising Forces here against a Parliament, not justly convinced of treason,
and yet not affording his ready assistance to supplies for Ireland, whilst many
Protestants are murdered daily there for want of the same, and that by the
hands of those bloody miscreants whom his Majesty never mentions without
horror. And when we see all intentions of forces abiured, and with such high
imprecations disclaymed, except for a guard only, and yet as soon as Forces
are increased thereby, open defiance proclaimed to all which adhere to the
Parliament in orders made for public safety. And when we see the intrusting
of the public Militia into faithful hands by Authority of the whole state
thundered against as oppressive to the Subject, and yet at the same time,
Commissions of Array issued out to such as may Lord Rivers, etc. the said
Commissions being as illegal and vexatious, and dangerous, and so generally
known to be; as the Ship-Scot was, when we see these things and many other like
we grieve, we bleed inwardly for his Majesty, and it seems prodigious to us
that so gentle a Prince should endure so much, so many years together for such
Ministers sakes contrary to the prayers and advertisements of this whole
glorious British Monarchy.

Seventhly, his Majesty rests only in generals (which according to his
Majesty's own words amount to just nothing, for as general complaints of
subverting Law, and subjecting both King and Kingdom to lawless Arbitrary
rule, are pressed against the Parliament, so nothing but general promises, of
making us a happy people, and consenting to all just requests, are uttered by
his Ma^estie: at this present when his Maje^tie prefers private advise before
public, yet he attributes generally all due respe^t to Parliaments: And when
his Majesty takes up the Sword against the Parliament, the highest Court of
Law in England, and not condemned, but by Edict Law only, (no Peer, Judge,
etc. appearing in the condemnation) yet this sword is said to be taken no
merely to protect the Law; This strange persecution of a Parliament, and all
its favorers, by fire and sword, which to our ordinary ap^rehensions seems so
dismal and fatal, especially at this time, when it is as great a benefit to
Popish Rebels in Ireland, as it is a scourge to loyal Protestants in England*
and this must seem not only to stand with his Majesty's general expressions
of Grace, but in a general sense it is it self an a^t of Grace.

And this is not wonderful, for we know that whilst the Ship-scos, and all
other Projects and M^nopolies lay heavvest upon us, in all our sore grievances
and violations, general expressions of Grace did ever accompany them, though
they r^ther added than diminished to the weight of our sorrows. And therefore
we have now the less reason to comfort our selves with general assurances,
especially since deeds of hostility fail not to attend our sweetest words of
clemency; Nay, and in the same Manifestoes, as we find professions favoring
all of Law, right, and limited power* so we find withal intermingled diverse
positions placing the King beyond all Law, right and limitation, and reducing
Parliaments to less power than ordinary Courts.

In all submissive humility therefore we humbly prostrate our selves before his
Majesty's feet, with the pious tender of these our earnest supplications.

First, That it would please his Majesty, in a war of this confounding nature
to the three Kingdoms at once, and to the true Religion, in them to have
recourse to the impartial advise of former ages, rather then of this.

Secondly, to abandon the Councels of Papists, as well such as go to Church by
dispensation, as not, and as well such as send instru^tions from beyond the
Sea, as those which are here more visible; and in the same manner to reject the
advertisem^nts of Delinquents, Prelates, Soldiers, etc. whose known interests
makes them incompetent advisers in this case, no age having a parallel to it,
and if his Majesty conceives public advise to be partial at this time; yet to
let the kingdom know what private advise is hearkened to, and what the quality
and grounds of it is, for the better vindication of his Majesty's Honor, and
the more full satisfaction of all true Protestants.

Thirdly, To make a further guess at some of his Majesty's Counselors, by
those false slanders of Treasons which they have powered into his Majesty's
ears, and are now disproved to all the world.

Fourthly, That his Majesty would not admit of any crime in the Parliament, but
such as bears the stamp and form of a legal and judici^ll accusation; and
instead of general invectives, to publish the certain kind of Treasons, and
names of Traitors, and the certainty of his Majesty evidence and how far his
Majesty will refer the trial there^f to any peace^le tre^ty, laying down the
sword in the mean time, witho^t o^ a^vanta^e (...) either side, for if the
offense of the P^rliament be tha^ they h^ve been t^o ze^lo^s of the safety of
the Kingdom, in making Ordinances to settle the Militia, Then the question is
only, whether or no the King has such a sole interest in the Towns, For^s,
etc. and st^ength of the Kingdom, as that he may a(...)e entrust them to
suspected Substitutes, in time (...) danger, without general advise, nay
contrary to general consent. And th^s ^eemes a strange ground for such an
uncouth dismal war, at such a time as this, when it makes our Lords and
Commons worse Rebels then the Irish, and chooses rather that the Protestant
Religion, together with the Crown there shall perish, then any truce shall be
granted here, or any umpirage admitted. It cannot but be better that the State
of Scotland were entreated to mediate and arbitrate in this difference, then
that so unsesonable and unnatural a war should be waged. For if Sir John
Hotham be not fitter to be trusted than Captain Leg, and my Lord of Warwick
then Sir John Pennington, yet the Kings interest is not altered, nothing but
the subordinate person is changed, and if this be not allowed to a parliament,
the Subject has no remedy nor power of defense in any danger when the King
mistakes both his friends and foes: but if this be allowed, the King suffers
nothing by it. He which serves the State faithfully, must needs serve the King
faithfully, (it is to be wished, the contrary were as true) a general
defection is not to be feared, nor could be redressed if it should happen, and
except in case of general defection, the State cannot choose to the
disadvantage of the King: But if the Militia be not the main cause of this war,
if any other super-emergent exceptions, against any particular persons, in, or
out of Parliament may be taken* this may be debated, and accommodated legally
without blood, except one side will declare it self not to be sa^isfied
otherwise then by blood. Till these things be better cleared no Force ought to
be used, and if the King will admit of no truce, it will not be said that the
Parliament takes up Arms against the King, but the whole kingdom in its
representative Court defends it self against such as have seduced, and
uniustly incensed the King, and such, as though they have usurped the Kings
person, and word, and command, yet have not so true a right to his virtue, and
authority, nor ought to be held so friendly thereunto as the Parliament.

Fifthly, not to make the Parliaments arbitrary power in declaring Law, etc. any
ground of charge since this strife between prerogative and liberty must be
decided, and by the Law it self without some interpreter cannot, and since his
Majesty does not claim that sole interpretation, and since the Parliament
cannot be suspected therein.

Sixthly, to judge of the Councillors and Fomenters of this war by the
favor which it bears to the Irish Rebellion, and the disagreement thereof
with his Majesty's former gracious professions: and at least to hearken to a
truce till the Irish war be ended, except the Lords and Commons seem more
detestable Traitors than the Irish Rebels.

Seventhly, That his Majesty will let us know something in particular
concerning our privileges, in and out of Parliament, and what latitude of
authority and power shall be granted to the representative body of the whole
Kingdom, even when his Majesty likes better of private advise; and also how
far his Majesty will grant his Royal Prerogative to be within the
Cognizance and Declaration of the Lords and Commons, because in our
understanding to have no right, and no impartial Judge of that right, and to
have no limits, and no known limits is one and the same thing.

Now therefore our humble and hearty desires to his Majesty are, that he
would be graciously pleased to condescend to these so necessary things, now
that so streaming a Comet of bloody aspect hangs over our heads, and so
abominable a war is commenced amongst us, it will facilitate a happy and
fair accommodation, it will disappoint the greatest adversaries of the Church
and State, it will make his Majesty's reign more blessed now, and his story
more candid and unstayned with blood hereafter.

And his Majesty's most humble Petitioners shall ever pray, etc.
