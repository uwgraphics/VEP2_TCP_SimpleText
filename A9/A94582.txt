To the Parliament of the Commonwealth of ENGLAND. The Humble Petition of many
of the well-affected of the County of KENT,
SHOWS,
THat though the Kings of the Earth have been unwilling that the Anointed JESUS
should Reign: yet the observation of the outgoings of the most High in these
latter days, causes your Petitioners to believe that the day of the
accomplishment of the Promises on the behalf of the Son of Righteousness is
dawned, if not approached very near its Noon, who is weary always to behold
the Burdens on the Backs, the Yoaks on the Necks, and to hear the Groans and
Cries from the mouths of his People, wherefore he has powered forth a Spirit
which has encountered and vanquished our open Oppressors, and powered contempt
upon those who would be but partial deliverers, the Sun of whose power sat at
Noon, because it ripened not the Desires and Petitions of Gods People by a
favorable influence, but suffered their Hopes to blast, after so many Promises
and Protestations, and so much expense of Treasure and blood. The same God who
has pulled them down has set you up; but not to rule for your selves, but for
the People of God; not to seek your own, but the Honor of Christ; And we can do
no less than hope and pray that the Spirit of the Lord may fall down upon you
(and teach you to rule after the heart of Christ) to whom we make bold to make
this humble Address, not to interrupt your weighty Affairs, or misdoubting
your Wisdom and Faithfulness, But only to show how our hearts own you as our
Parliament, and to confess we dare not neglect our assistance to the great
work of the Lord, though it be but in being your Remembrancers of what you have
proposed to us of your desires in your late Declaration, to the breaking of all
our Yoaks, and removing all our Burdens, at which our souls joy. And to keep
warm the Breathing of that Spirit, We humbly crave leave to spread before you
one Grand Burden, under which we have groaned till our hearts ache;

Humbly desiring that Tyths of all Sorts, Root and Branch, may be abolished,
That that Jewish and Antichristian, Bondage and Burden on the Estates and
Consciences of the Godly may cease, And that we may not be ensnared with forced
Maintenance, or any thing like it in the stead thereof.

And your Petitioners shall own the Lord in you, and bless the Lord for you,
and pray, hope and wait to see your hands stretched out for the Lord, till you
shall help to tear the flesh of the Whore, and burn her with fire.

This Petition being subscribed by above two thousand persons, whereof four
were Justices of the Peace, and presented on Thursday the fourth of August, the
Speaker returned the Petitioners this Gracious Answer;

Gentlemen, I am commanded by the House to give you thanks for your good
affections to the Parliament, That the Business of your Petition is, and shall
be, under Consideration, and that the House will do therein as the Lord shall
direct them.
