THE USE OF THE PLANISPHERE.
IN this Planisphere the Center represents the North Pole of the World, about
which are these four Concentrick Circles.

1. The Artick Circle being a lesser Circle distant from the Pole 23 degrees. 30
min.

2. The Tropic of Cancer distant from the North Pole 66 degrees 30 minutes,
and from the Equator 23 degrees 30 minutes.

3. The Equator, which is distant from the Pole 90 degrees, numbered 10, 20, 30,
etc. to 360.

4. The Tropic of Capricorn, distant from the Equator Southward 23 degrees 30
minutes.

The Ecliptic makes an Angle of 23 degrees 30 minutes, with the Equator at the
two opposite Points and, and is divided into 12 Signs, marked,,, etc.

Any Right Line supposed to be drawn from the Pole or Center of the Planisphere
is a Meridian, but that which is called the Graduated Meridian is numbered from
the Equator both ways, with 10, 20, 30, etc.

By the help of this Planisphere, the following useful Problems may be resolved.

1. The Day of the Month being given to find the Sun's Place in the Ecliptic.

2. To find the Hour of the Night by any known Star, being upon the Meridian.

3, To know what Month and Day any Star will South at Midnight.

4. To find the Declination of any known Star.

5. To find the Right Ascension of any known Star.

6. To find the Time of the Moon's Southing any Day of her Age.

7. To find the Time of the Sun's Rising and Setting, any Day in the Year, in
the Latitude of London.

For the Solution of those Seven Problems, you have Directions at the Corners
of the Planisphere.

Prob. 8. Having the Sun's Place to find his Declination.

Extend your Compasses from the Center of the Planisphere, to the Degree of the
Ecliptic that the Sun is in; then keeping one Point in the Center, turn the
other to the Graduated Meridian, and it will show the Declination required.

Example. I desire to know the Sun's Declination when he is in 0 degrees. 0 min. of
Taurus.

Extend the Compasses from the Center to 0 degrees. 0 min. of on the Ecliptic
Circle, then turning them about as before directed, the moveable Point falls on
11 degrees. 30 min. which (because it is numbered from the Equator toward the North
Pole) is North Declination, which was required.

Prob. 9. Having the Sun's Place given to find his Right Ascension.

Lay a Scale from the Center over that Point in the Ecliptic that the Sun is
in, and observe where it cuts the Equator; the Degrees and Minutes so found, is
the Right Ascension of the Sun at that time.

Example. The Sun's Right Ascension when he is in 0 degrees. 0 min. of, is required.

Lay your Scale from the Center of the Planisphere over 0 degrees. 0 min. of in the
Ecliptic, and it will cut in the Equator 27 degrees. 54 min. the Sun's Right
Ascension sought.

Having thus found the Right Ascension of the Sun, and also the Right Ascension
of any Star, by Prob. 5. you may find what time of the Day or Night the said
Star will be upon the Meridian (besides the Method proposed in Prob. 2.) Thus,

Subtract the Right Ascension of the Sun from the Right Ascension of the Star
(borrowing 360 degrees. if Subtraction cannot be made) the Remainder reduce into
Time (allowing for every 15 degrees one hour, and for every degree 4 minutes)
it gives the hour and minute Afternoon that the Star will be upon the Meridian;
and if it amount to more than 12 hours, subtract 12 hours from it, the
Remainder is the hour and minute that the Star comes to the Meridian next
Morning.

Example. It is required to know what time the Lyon's Heart will be upon the
Meridian on the Day that the Sun's Place is found to be in 0 degrees. 0 min. of us.

The Right Ascension of the Lions Heart, is found (by Prob. 5.) to be 147
degrees 48 minutes, from which subtract the Right Ascension of the Sun (which
is found by Prob. 9. to be) 270 degrees; the remainder 237 degrees. 48 min. reduced
to Time gives 15 hours 51 minutes Afternoon, from which abating 12 hours, the
Remainder 3 hours 51 minutes is the hour of the Lions Heart coming to the
Meridian in the Morning.

Note, If you put a small Bead upon the String that is fixed at the Center of
the Planisphere, the String and Bead so fitted will supply the Use of Scale and
Compasses, the String serving instead of a Scale, and the Bead slipping up and
down upon the String at pleasure, gives any Extent from the Center upon the
Graduated Meridian.

A CELESTIAL PLANISPHERE By J. Seller.
The Use of this Celestial Planisphere Ilustrated for want of room by the
Examples only.

Prob: 1. The day of the Month being given to find ye Suns place.

Example Let the day be the 5th. day of May, on which day the Suns place is
required, lay a third or Ruler from the Center, to ye Circle of Months to ye
5th. of May. And it will show you in the Circle of Signs that the Sun is 25d.
20 in Taurus, and on the fifth day of November, the Sun is in 24. degrees: of
Scorpio, And on the 5th. of January you. will find the Sun to be in the 26. of
Capricorn. And on the Twentieth day of February you will find the Suns place to
be in the 13th. degrees: of Pisses.

Problem 2. To find the Hour of the Night by any Star upon the Meridian.

Example on ye 30. of January. I see ye Bulls eye upon the South part of ye
Meridian. I requier to find ye hour of the Night. Lay ye third or edg of a
Ruler from ye Center upon ye Bulls eye. And note where it cutts ye Hour Circle,
from which point set one point of your Compasses, and extend ye other point to
the Hour of 12. ye same Extent. ye same way will reach from ye 30th. of January
to 50. min. past Six of the Clock.

Problem 3. To know what time of the year ye Bulls eye will be upon the
Meridian at 12 of the clock at night. Lay a Ruler over the diameter of ye
Planispher and through ye center of ye Bulls eye, then ye oposite part of ye
Ruler will cut ye 16 day of November: the night on which the Bulls eye will be upon
the Meridian.

Prob. 4. To find ye Declination of any Star.

Example Extend your Compasses from the Center of the Planisphere to the Bulls
eye, then turn the foot of your Compasses to the graduated Meridian, and there
it will show you the Declination from the Equinoctial to be 15. degrees: 48. min.

Problem 5th. To find the Right Ascension of any Star.

Example of the Bulls eye. Lay a third or edge of a Ruler from the center of the
Planisphere over the Bulls eye, and you will find that it cutts in the circle
of Signs 64d. 27. counting it from Aries.

Example of the Lions heart, Lay a third or Ruler over the Center of the
Planisphere, and over the Lions heart, you will find that the third or Ruler
will cut in the circle of Sines in 27 degrees: 48. of Leo. which being counted
from the first Point of Aries is 247. degrees: 48. minutes which is the Right
Assention of the Lions heart.

Prob 6 To find ye Moons Southing any day of her Age And ye time of full Sea

Example I Requier ye time of ye Moons Southing when she is 6 days old. seek
her Age amongst ye small figures yt are plast among the Hours, and you will find
ye figure 6 stand at 4. a clock 53. the time of the Moons Southing. To which if
you a^ ye time of Flowing, it will give ye time of high water in any place, for
London add 3. which makes 7. of the clock and 53. past ye time of High water at
London bridge.

Prob. 7 To find the Rising and Setting of the Sun every day in the year.

Example I Require to know ye Rising and setting of the Sun on ye 26 day of
December. Therefore lay a third or the edg of a Ruler from the Center over the
day of the Month, then in the outer Circle it will show you that the Sun rises
at 8 of the clock 9 minutes past And Sets at four of the Clock 9 minutes
wanting

The Use of the Planisphere, upon the Plain of the Ecliptic.
THESE two Planispheres upon the Plain of the Ecliptic, are one for the
Northern Hemisphere, the other for the Southern; but their Use is the same,
their Centers are the Poles of the Ecliptic, and their Periphery is the
Ecliptic Circle, and the Poles of the World are 23degrees. 30m. from the Center or
Pole of the Ecliptic. In the Northern Hemisphere you have the Pole-Artick, or
North Pole, and about it is Described the Artick Circle, the Tropic of Cancer,
and one half of the Equator. In the Southern Hemisphere, you have the South
Pole, (and respecting it for a Center, you have) the Antartick Circle, the
Tropic of Capricorn, and the other half of the Equator. The chief Use is,

1. To find the Longitude of any fixed Star.

Lay a Scale from the Center, over the Star whose Longitude is required, and
the Sign and Degree cut by the Scale upon the Ecliptic, or outermost Circle,
is the Place of the Star in Longitude.

Example. I desire the Longitude of Capella, ( which is a bright Star in the
Constellation called Auriga.)

I lay a Scale as before directed, and I find it cuts the Ecliptic in 17degrees.
30m. of Gemini; the Place of the Star required.

2. To find the Latitude of any Star.

Extend your Compasses from the Center of the Planisphere, to the Star, then
keeping one foot in the Center, turn the other to the Graduated Line of
Longitude; which (in both Hemispheres) is one of the Lines drawn from the
Center to the Periphery and numbered toward the Center, with 10, 20, 30, etc.
and you have the Latitude of the Star required.

Example. I desire to know the Latitude of the Star Capella, or the Goat,
before mentioned.

Extend the Compasses from the Center to the Star, then turn it to the
Graduated Line of Longitude, it falls upon 22degrees. 50min the Latitude of the
Star required.

Note, Always if the Star whose Latitude is sought, be found in the Northern
Hemisphere, the Latitude is North; (as in the Example above) and and if it is
in the Southern Hemisphere, the Latitude of the Star is South.
