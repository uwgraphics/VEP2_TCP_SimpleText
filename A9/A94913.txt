A TRUE AND EXACT RELATION Of the whole proceedings of the Parliament Forces
into KENT.
UPon Monday last, we marched thorough Synock, about which the said Combustion
did first begin, but finding none of the adverse party there, we hastened
toward Tunbridge, where we had intelligence, that a strong party of them lay
being a place, by nature very strongly fortified, and before we came to make
any assault upon the Town, Colonel Brown sent a Trumpeter to them to summon
them to yield up the Town and to lay down their Arms, whereupon they returned
answer to this effect; That they stood for their ancient Laws and Customs,
without which they refused to lay down their Arms, but desired to treat
further about the said business, upon which, Colonel Brown sent them word,
that he would come and treat with them himself. And so about three of the
clock in the after noone, a part of our Forces having matched about nine miles
that day: We approached within half a mile of the Town, where we discovered
the Enemy upon a hill within a quarter of a mile of the Town, upon which our
Soldiers expressed much joye, and were exceeding forward to fall upon them:
After which three or four files of Nusqueteers were drawing out upon the
forlorn-hope, and marched down into a bottom, near to the Enemy, through a
lane where we could march but six a breast, there being in the bottom, a
narrow Bridge, where the Enemy lay in Ambuscado, and charged upon us before we
perceived them, yet thorough Gods mercy, there was but one man of us hurt
(being of the left hand File) which was shot through the thigh, but not killed:
we charged them again, but running away, they escaped: Then we played upon them
with two Drakes, and forced them into the Town: We drew nearer to them, and
both with our Drakes and Musket shot did much annoy the Enemy, who having the
advantage of a Town of such consequence, and houses, and other places of
refuge, they hold us fight for about three or four hours together, after
which perceiving the Enemy forces to begin to fly, we marched up to the very
Town, with our body of Foot (the Horse having little opportunity to perform
any considerable service) and et our entrance into the Town, the Enemy gave us
a volley of shot, but did us little hurt, only Sergeant Major Rows Ensign
was slain.

Having thus entered the town and finding the enemy to, fly command was given
to the Horse to pursue them toward the Bridge, which the Enemy perceiving,
many of them left the Bridge and leaped into the River, and were drawned;
others that got over the River, left the high ways and betook themselves to
by paths and hedges, but if night had not overtaken us, we had taken, in all
probability, all their Horse (as we did a great part) and few of their Foot had
escaped.

The neighboring Towns were very joyful at our entrance into this Town, and
the next morning hundred and fifty Dragoones came in to us, profering their aid
and assistance, and there being five hundred of the Malevolents at a Town
called Yawlden, about six miles from Tunbridge, the strength of the County came
against them and put them to flight.

We took a hundred and fifty prisoners, but the next day some of them were
released, and the rest being a hundred and four, we have brought away to
Synocke, besides the Minister of the Town, who is a great Malignant, and had a
hand in inviting the Cavaliers thither, and an ancient Gentleman which is
thought to be one of their chief Commanders.

We lost in all six of our men, whereof the Ensign before mentioned, was the
chief, and notwithstanding the great advantage the Enemy had in the Town, we
found three men dead in the streets, besides those that were drowned in the
River, and one man (being mortally wounded) desired our Soldiers to put him
out of his pain, whereupon some of our Soldiers asking who was their chief
Leader or Commander, he answered, he knew not, but he thought, the Devil.

It seemed that the Enemy expected aid and assistance from other places, which
failed them; for during the fight they rung the bells hackwards, yet none durst
come to aid them: What strength they had was not certainly know, but they had
both Horse and Foot, and some Arms, though many of them were forced to make
use of Birding-peeces, yet to show their malice, they which we took prisoners
had many of them poisoned bullets in their pockets.

Thus having given a faithful and true Relation of such things as happened in
our marching upon this service and having so much dispersed them that as we
knew not where to find them, so will it be hard for them to gather together
again, we returned to Synocke with our prisoners, where the Army does as yet
remain, and a Counsel of War is this day holden to proceed to trial of such
prisoners as we have taken, and if the Malignants are not wholly dissipated and
dispersed we shall be ready to perform such service as may tend to the good
and safety of the Kingdom and the Peace and prosperity of the Commonwealth,
against all that shall raise and increase the divisions and distractions of the
State, and make the breach greater between the King and the Parliament.

FINIS.
