The Worlds Wonder! OR, The Prophetical FISH.
Being a full Description of this Monster, its length and breadth with
Predictions on it. As it was taken by Fishermen in the Port of Cucanga, near
the Province and Kingdom of China, in the year 1664. and sent to the Emperor
of Germany, and from thence Conveyed to his Royal Majesty, the KING of Great
Britain, etc.
To the tune of, When Stormy Winds do blow.


^Le tell you of a Wonder,
that lately has been Shown,
(...)s strange as Winters Thunder;
or Frost and Snow in June:
Fish by Fishermen was caught
late in Cucanga Bay,
(...)Vhere Health, and Wealth,
their Plenty do Display.
(...)n Sixteen hundred sixty four,
this Monstrous Fish was caught,
(...)ent to the German Emperor,
then from him it was brought
(...)o Charles the King of England,
(...) Prince of high Renown,
(...)hich well, does tell,
much' welfare to his Crown,
This monstrous Fish is twelve Foot long,
and likewise six foot broad;
Upon his back (so firm and strong)
he bears a pondrous load,
A Piece of Ord'nance mounted,
upon a warlike Carr;
Whose Charge, at large,
does threaten woeful War.
The Face of it, is like a man,
upon 'its head a Crown;
A Cross for England, in the Van,
Presaging all is our own;
The Cross does issue from his mouth,
which he seems to disgorge;
And cry, We Will die,
for England, and St. George.
I thank you for my poor house


Your humble s^rvant Sir.




WHen with their base power they would conquered his friends
they quickly surprised the Kings Majesty,
These zealots Religion, was for their own ends,
their Oath of Allegiance they then did defy
a Scaffold erected,
Murder effected,
Heathens never acted so horrid a thing,
but Monck has confounded,
each prick-eard roundhead,
Now let us be Loyal and true to our King.
But while these Rebels did thus tyrannize,
a terrible Governor quickly arose,
Although Kingly government they did despise,
'twas treason to meddle with Olivers Nose,
for he like a Hector,
was their Protector,
Rebels had shelter under his wing:
but Monck has confounded,
each prick-eard roundhead,
Now let us be Loyal and true to our King.
This Tyrants government lasted too long,
for Rebels in England did daily increase,
Yet none but poor Cavaleers suffered wrong,
while every Ass was made Justice of Peace,
and Cavys must stand sir,
with Cap in hand sir,
At their command sir, in every thing:
but Monck has confounded,
each prick-eard roundhead,
Now let us be Loyal and true to our King.
Worshipful Walton got Sommersome Park,
without any labor or taking of pains,
And Wagstaffe that Major was counted a Spark,
although he did live upon other men's means,
and Rainsborough nimble,
slighted his Thimble,
When Higham Park such profit did bring,
but Monck has confounded,
each prick-eard roundhead,
Now let us be Loyal and true to our King.
These pitiful fellows are all put to flight,
which thought that their pleasures would never ha'end
For they in ambition did take such delight,
there is many supposes they will be hanged ere they will mend
for they in their bravery,
acted such knavery,
Curbing true subjects in every thing,
but Monck has confounded,
each prick-eard roundhead,
Now let us be loyal and true to our King,
I wish with my heart all the Kings enemies
both Rebels and Traitors on Tyborn may swing
That every moment do mischeef devise,
and cannot be content with a Protestant King,
Esquire Dun take them,
never forsake them
Until thou make them peep through a string,
now Monck has confounded,
each prick-eard roundhead,
Now let us be loyal and true to our King.

The second part,
to the same tune.
THis rarity in Nature,
Does all men's wits control,
This strange Prodigious Creature,
Is Flesh, and Fish, and Foul:
The Flesh is meant for England sure,
The Foul is meant for France,
The Fish, a Dish.
For Hollands Mainteynance.
His Back is full of Fish-like Finns,
his Legs have Eagles Claws,
And Cock-like Spurs, as sharp as Pinns,
which blood in Battle draws:
The Eagle is a Princely Bird,
and never Fights for States;
But flies, at the Eyes,
of such Confederates.
Upon his very Shoulder Bone,
he bears two Flaggs a cross;
A. D. I. H. is writ on One,
importing some great loss:
Which I shall now Expound to you,
the next ensuing Lines;
If this, do miss,
I Will leave it to Divines.
A. D. I. H. does seem to teach,
the Dutchman shall have no Land;
A. D. does stand for All Down, and
I. H. does mean In Holland:
A. D. I. H. does plainly show,
All Down In Holland falls;
(...)f They, obey
not England's Brazen Walls.
There are Three Muskets and a Sword,
displayed upon the Rump;
Which shows the Hollander Aboard,
is beaten to the Stump:
Death's Head on his Left-side is,
and like so many Shots;
(...)ll round, it is Crowned,
with Pestilential Spots.
Which does demonstrate unto men,
our woeful Plague of late;
And will, we fear, renew again,
if we Repent not strait:
This Fish has Arrows in the Tail,
which he against Holland draws,
And slights, the Flights,
their Lion has in's Paws.
Thus have I plainly painted out
the Picture of this Fish;
Pray God all things may come about,
as we do desire and wish:
Three Nations against England come,
it is not Nobly done;
I hope, they will stoop,
And find enough of One.
Let us but move, in truth and love,
and prove good Friends at home,
That Sacred Power that is above.
will give them all their doom.
If we by Factions spoil our Selves,
and on each Other Fall,
The Foe, will grow,
too Powerful for us all.
But if We hold together,
nor French, nor Dutch, nor Dane,
With Butter-box, and Feather,
shall make our Fortunes wain:
We Will whip the Frisking Frenchmans tail,
which would possess our Land;
The French, shall Flinch,
and bow to CHARLES Command.
God bless the King, the Queen, the Duke,
with all the Peers beside,
And may the Lord of Host rebuke
the Dutch and French-mans pride:
We need not fear the Powers that come
from Paris, nor from Delf,
If we, then be,
at Peace within our Self.
FINIS.
