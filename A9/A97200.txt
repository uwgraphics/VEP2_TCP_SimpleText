A Warning to all Priests and jesuits, by the example of two Mass Priests,
which for seducing and stealing away the hearts of the Kings Loyal Subjects,
were hanged, drawn, and quartered: whose execution was on Friday, being the 21.
day of January, 1642.
To the Tune of, A Rich Merchant Man.


COme you Seducers all,
which dares presume to stay
To see your factions brethrens fall,
cease now on beads to pray.
And serve the Lord alone,
for why you see the Pope.
Can give a pardon unto none,
to save them from the rope.
And if not from the rope,
much less a soul from hell,
For that's a place wherein the Pope
himself may go and dwell.
Then Jesuits, Priests, and Friars,
to Rome make haste away,
Lest that the Hangman pays your hires,
if you in England stay.
Two Priests being judged to dye
now at this Sessions past,
May cause the rest from hence to fly,
which are not yet laid fast.
But if they longer stay*
I fear they will chance to take
Young Brandons blessing by the way,
except more haste they make.
The dominering knave,
can hardly be more grieved,
Then when the Priests their judgments have,
and afterward reprieved.
And yet it is believed,
had not the saucy else,
At this last Sessions been reprieved,
he had been hanged himself.
Then Jesuits, Priests, and Friars,
to Rome make have away,
Least that the Gallows do prove your hires
if you in England stay.
The names of these two Priests
like Traitors Judged to dye,
Shall herein briefly be expressed,
to you immediately.
They that our Laws contemned,
the one called Albert Roe,
And Father Renals being condemned,
above seven years ago.
From Newgate they were sent
like birds both of ane feather.
And lovingly up Holborne went
both on one fledge together.
The second Part, to the same tune.


FAst bound and guarded strong,
unto their dying place,
These Papist Priests were drawn along
to suffer in disgrace.
Then hanged till almost dead,
and so immediately,
Were both cut down and quartered,
as Traitors use to dye.
Then Jesuits Priests and Friars,
to Rome make haste away,
Least that the Gallows prove your bires,
if you in England stay.
Their members and their hearts,
were all in fire burned,
Their guts, and all their inward parts,
were straight to ashes turned.
Thus with a shameful end,
they finished up their days,
So must the rest* which dares offend,
in such presumptuous ways.
In Newgate I perceive,
there still lies other seven,
Which sought to make the blind believe,
up Holborne's the way to Heaven.
