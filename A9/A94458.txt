To the Honorable House of now Commons assembled IN PARLIAMENT. The humble
Petition of many Thousands of Clothiers, Weavers, Bay-makers, Serge-makers,
Say-makers, Clothworkers, and Worsted-Combers within the Realm of England,
whose names are hereunder written, As Well for and on the behalf of themselves
as of all other persons that trade and deal in Wool, and the using and
employing thereof, In the making of Cloth, Stuffes and other Manufactures of
Wool within the said Kingdom and the Dominion of Wales, Subscribed unto also
by diverse Merchants and Woollen-Drapers of London for themselves and on the
behalf of the rest who are concerned therein, being dealers and Adventurers of
the Commodities made of Wool.
Shows,
THat whereas the Woolls of the growth of this Kingdom, and of the said
Dominion, are the principal and chiefest Staple Commodity thereof, and that
by the using of the said Woolls in the making of Clothes and Stuffes of the old
and new Draperie, and other Manufactures, many thousand of Families have
heretofore had their sole livelihood and subsistence, and in respect of the
Customs for the exportation of such Clothes, Stuffes, and other Manufactures
into foreign parts, have brought to this Kingdom a great Revenue, and the
makers thereof from time to time been enabled in the payment of such Subsidies
and Taxes, as by this State has been required from them. The consideration
whereof heretofore moved the wisdom of this State in former times to make and
provide diverse good Laws for the preventing of the frauds and deceipts used
in the winding up and sale of Wool, whereby it was provided that none should
wind, or cause or suffer to be wound and sold any fleece of Wool, the same
not being first sufficiently washed, nor wind nor suffer to be wound within any
Fleece of Wool, any Lambs-Wooll, Refuse-Wooll, Cat, Tar, Taile-lockes,
Cleg-lockes, Hinder-shanks, Claydung, Cumber, or any other filth or trash,
whereby the fleece may become more weighty to the deceit and loss of the
buyer, upon pain ^he seller of any such deceiptfull Wool, to forfeit for
every fleece of Wool so sold six pence. The omission and neglect of the due
execution of which and other good Laws tending thereunto, has emboldened
owners of Sheep, and other usual sellers of Wool, as Staplers, Ingrossers,
Fellmongers, Jobbers, Brogers, and others in latter times to practice and use
more deceits and abuses, and ^o sell and utter more deceivable Wool and trash
made up therein then are hereby before expressed, or has been in the winding
of Wool formerly practiced: For that besides the deceipts as afore^aid used,
whereas Farmers and other Owners of Sheep have usually heretofore shorn their
sheep within three or four days next after their washing, and if they go
longer unshorne, and put into, or suffered to go into Fallow-fields, or
Highways, it is needful they should be washed again before shorn; They now
in diverse Counties and places of this Kingdom do commonly after the Sheep are
washed, however the weather fall out, let them go unshorne, as well in
Fallow-fields and Highways, as Pasture-grounds, by the space of two or three
weeks together, and never wash them again, which does cause them to sweat and
gather soil, and make the Wool the more weighty; And that Fellmungers by
their not well washing and not well drying their Wool, does cause so sold
oftentimes to shrink two pound weight at the least in every twenty pounds
weight thereof, besides the great deceipts used in most parts of this Kingdom,
by putting up of all sorts of Wool together, and by the needless and too
often branding of sheep with great brandmarkes of pitch, and that at diverse and
sundry times in the year, on several parts on the Sheep, and commonly in the
places where the Wool is best, and most usually not long before they are
shorn, which does cause the same to be much the more weighty; And the
Petitioners for the most part carrying the same by water, whereby or otherwise
taking wet, causes the same to heat, and thereby to melt the said
pitch-markes, which by running through the Wool does spoil a great part
thereof, and hinder the dividing and working of the same; And the Petitioners
thereby constrained to cut off and cast away such pitch-markes, the charge
whereof (besides the loss of the Wool which is the greatest) is very
considerable to the Petitioners, besides the Wool that is lost in the
Commonwealth thereby; The cutting of which brands at the sheering of the Sheep
would be very little or no charge to the Owners of the Sheep (if there were any
need so to brand them) By all which before mentioned frauds and deceipts the
Petitioners are very great loosers: Forasmuch therefore as the Petitioners and
others that trade and deal in Wool, and the using and employing thereof in
making of Cloth and other Manufactures of Wool by reason of the remoteness
and distance of their respective habitations from the several Counties and
places where the most part of the said Woolls do grow, cannot possibly
discover the abuses and deceipts so as aforesaid practiced in the winding up
and sale of Wool, or otherwise concerning Wool, and for that the exhibiting,
commencing, and prosecution in the Courts at Westminster or elsewhere of
several Informations, Actions and suites in Law against the said Offenders as
in such cases has been usually, will tend to the Petitioners great charge and
expenses, the neglect of their several Trades and Callings, and in fine the
remedy become worse then the disease; And for that the Petitioners many of them
on the behalf of the rest have this year several times, and their Agents
more constantly attended this Honorable House to procure a redress for these
grievances having too long undergone the said grievances. May it therefore
please this Honorable Assembly, That if it seem good to your wisdoms for the
redress of such mischiefs as aforesaid, a penalty upon every score of faulty
Fellwooll may be set and imposed, and that the said forfeiture of six pence
upon every fleece of deceiptfull Wool that shall be hereafter sold, may be
increased, and that in such places where there is no Woolls carried to any
Markets to be sold, convenient Markets may be appointed whither the Owners of
Wool may bring their Wool to sell. And for that it manifestly appears that
the want of Commissioners and Officers to enquire of the frauds and deceipts
used in and about Wool, and to see the Laws put in execution, is the cause of
the growing and increase thereof; If it may therefore stand with the wisdom
and pleasure of this Honorable House, It is the Petitioners humble suit, That
Commissioners and Officers may be appointed to see the Law made, or such as
shall be made touching the premises, put in due execution. And your
Petitioners will be willing to afford a considerable allowance for their
charges, care, pains and encouragement in the faithful discharge of the trust
in them to be reposed. And it is the Petitioners humble desire, that they may
be such as they have trusted with the managaing and prosecution of this suite,
If it shall likewise stand with the good liking of this Honorable House, when
the said persons and said allowance shall be presented.

The Petitioners further humbly showing, That whereas by diverse other good
Laws heretofore made, it was enacted, That no person whatsoever should
transport any Wool or Wooll-fels; And whereas by diverse other good Laws it was
also enacted, though now repealed, That no person or persons whatsoever should
buy any Wool but only to or for his or their only proper use and uses, and to
make Cloth and other Manufactures thereof, or sell or cause to be sold, or send
or cause to be sent Woolls to any Market, or else where to be sold other then
such Woolls as are of his or their own growing, nor buy any Wool to sell the
same again unwrought; Notwithstanding which said Laws as aforesaid made
against the transporting of Wool, there has been for diverse years last past,
more especially of late years, great quantities both of Wool and Fullers
earth transported into Foreign parts, and so consequently the Trade of making
of Clothes and Stuffes, and other Manufactories of Wool, where they have now
(as the Petitioners have been credibly informed) such great quantities of Wool
which they have had from hence heretofore at low rates, that they are able to
afford the said Woolls and the Commodities made thereof cheaper then they can
now be afforded here, That if the transporting of Wool and Fullers earth be
not prevented, the Trade will be very much in time carried from hence thither,
and this Kingdom likely to be very much impoverished thereby; whereas if the
Wool and Fullers earth thereof were kept within it, Clothes and other
Manufactures of Wool such as are made here could not any where else be
afforded so cheap, or made so well without our Wool and Fullers earth as here,
Nor can any great quantities be had elsewhere, And so the Trade would be kept
here to the enriching of this Nation, and the setting the poor thereof on
work as the Petitioners humbly conceive. And the said Laws against buying and
selling of Wool again unwrought being as aforesaid repealed; The said
Staplers, Fellmongers, Jobbers and Brogers are become the principal Ingrossers
of Wool; And the Petitioners verily believe that they will also appear to be
the chiefest transporters thereof, and find that they by buying and engrossing
the same into their hands, do use much deceit in packing up thereof, and
mixing therewith sand and water, or otherwise corrupting of it, whereby it
becomes to be more weighty. That the said buyers of Wool do some of them
sometimes forthwith sell the same again at the Market where it was bought
cheaper then they did buy it, and yet are gainers by the sale thereof. The said
Jobbers and Brogers and the like also usually forestalling the Market in buying
of Woolls by the way as they are going thither, and selling them at the same
Market where they were to have been sold by the grower. And the Petitioners
have since the said Law was repealed, been constrained to buy most part of the
Wool they use at the second and third hands, and now of late at more hands,
which does not only inhaunce the price of the Manufactories made thereof, and
tend to the decay of Trading here, and hinderance of the setting on work, and
the impoverishing, and in time, if not prevented, to the utter undoing of many
thousand of Families having their dependence of the said Wooll-commodities, but
also to the increase and advancement of the said Trades of making Clothes and
Stuffes, and other Manufactories of Wool in Foreign parts, and the loss of
the Customs to be paid upon them in case the same were made here: And the
buying and selling again of Wool unwrought by reason of the Law against it
repealed as aforesaid, being so prejudicial to the Petitioners, and as they
conceive to the Commonwealth, It is their humble suite, that the said Statute
may be again revived and stand in force.

And the Petitioners humbly conceiving that unless it be made Felony to
transport not only Sheep but Wool, Wool fells, Yarne, Fullers-earth, and
Fulling-Clay into Foreign parts, and also the loss of Ship and Vessel, and
all therein, wherein any such goods shall be transported, The transporters
thereof will hardly be wholly or to any purpose restrained; It is therefore the
Petitioners humble suit, if it shall stand with the wisdom of this Honorable
House, That the transporting of the Commodities aforesaid may be made Felony
and loss of all as aforesaid, or otherwise, as to your grave wisdoms shall
seem meet.

And that for the preventing the transporting the said Commodities, and the
putting in execution the said Law against the buying and selling of Wool
again unwrought if it be revived as is desired, or such other Laws as shall
be made touching the same; It is the Petitioners humble suit, That the
aforesaid desired Commissioners and Officers may be appointed, and some
provision made for their charges, time, care and pains therein, if to your
Honors it shall seem good.

And further the Petitioners humbly show, That whereas by the working and
making of Wool into Clothes, Stuffes, and other Manufactures, many Thousand
of Families have for many Ages pastobtained and had their sole means of
livelihood and subsistence, and the Trades, Arts, and Mysteries arising from
Wool, tending to the supportation of the Commonwealth, are greatly fallen and
decayed by reason of many abuses practiced; particularly, for that contrary to
the Laws of this Kingdom, many have presumed to take upon them the said
Trades, who never served an Apprentiship thereunto, (viz,) FarmersSonnes, and
diverse others that have other Trades and means of livelihood, by giving of
Money have attained to some small knowledge therein, but for want of skill and
ability have made such bad and deceitful Ware, that it has caused our
Clothes and Stuffes to be disesteemed and unliked, not only here, but in
Foreign Parts, by reason whereof, your Petitioners are not only deprived of
the profit of their labors, but others are thereby discouraged from putting
their Children Apprentices to the said Trades, albeit the same is the only way
to make them skillfull in using and managing of the said Trades as they ought
to be; and have caused many of the said Trades, Arts, and Nisteries, to go into
Foreign Parts, there to set up and teach the said Trades, Arts, and Mysteries
to Aliens and Strangers, which tends to the decay of the said Trades here
within this Kingdom, and the impoverishing of many Thousands of Families which
have their dependancy upon the said Trade, Art, and Mystery.

May it therefore please this Honorable Assembly, That no Person or Persons
within this Kingdom or Dominion of Wales, shall or may hereafter use or
exercise the said Trade, but such only as shall first have served as
Apprentices thereunto for the Term of Seven years at the least, nor any that
have lately entered upon the said Trades who have not served as Apprentice any
time thereunto: And if it shall stand with the liking of this Honorable House,
That Commissioners and Officers may be appointed to see the said Laws made or
to be made, put in due execution, which the Petitioners pray may be such as are
before desired; And that such recompense may be allowed them for their care and
pains therein, as to the wisdom of this Honorable House shall be thought
fit, which the Petitioners shall be willing to afford them,

and pray, etc.
THis Petition was preferred to the Honorable House of Commons, and a special
Committee, being appointed by the said House to take the same into
consideration, The matter was before the said Committee several days debated
by Counsel on the part of the Petitioners, and of the Merchants of the Staple
of England: But in regard the business was of a general concernment, leave
was given to Print the Petition, that notice might be taken thereof in the
several parts of the Kingdom before the next sitting of that Honorable
Committee, which will be the second Wednesday in Easter Term next, being the
Twelfth of May.

The Petitioners have Printed and dispersed the said Petition, and have without
warrant inserted, that many Thousands (whereof some are mentioned to be of more
special quality) have subscribed it. Whereupon, occasion is given to recommend
to the consideration of all Wooll-growers, and others concerned in the said
business (who far exceed in number those that subscribed the Petition) how
inconvenient it will be to the Wooll-growers and others, and destructive to the
Kingdom, if the Petitioners shall be the sole and only Buyers of all the Wool
of the Kingdom, and Merchants of the Staple be prohibited, and none to be
permitted but the Petitioners to buy any Wool. And if the Wooll-growers and
others shall apprehend such the Petitioners endeavor to be a common damage,
Then by all just ways to endeavor to prevent the Petitioners therein.
