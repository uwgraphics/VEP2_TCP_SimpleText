THe Author of this Examen being (as I hear) a godly man, and of the
Presbyterian judgment, though I am not of opinion with him (notwithstanding
any thing I have here read) viz. That Infants are not the subject of Baptism;
yet the end of his writing, as I conceive, being the provoking of others to
write, that so his arguments being answered, himself and those that are of his
mind may receive satisfaction, I permit it to pass the Press: Not doubting
but since now (according to the desire of many) it is known where the chief
strength of the Catapaedobaptists lies, some will be found out in due time to
encounter with it.

AN EXERCITATION ABOUT INFANT BAPTISM; Presented in certain Papers, to the
Chairman of a COMMITTEE of the ASSEMBLY OF DIVINES, Selected to consider of

Additions, and an Answer to one new Objection. Translated out of Latin, by the

AN EXERCITATION CONCERNING Infant Baptism.
THe present Tenent,. 1. The first Argument for Infant Baptism, examined from
the interest in the promise, Genesis 17. 7.
according to which Infant Baptism is practiced, is, that the Infants born of
a Believer, are universally to be baptized.

This Doctrine and Practice conformable, is made doubtful to me, by these
Arguments.

Arg. 1. That which has no testimony of Scripture for it, is doubtful.

But this Doctrine of Infant Baptism, has no testimony of Scripture for it;
Ergo, it is doubtful.

The Minor is proved by examining the places that are brought for it, which are
these: Genesis 17. 7, etc. Acts 2. 38, 39. 1 Cor. 7. 14. Mark. 10. 14. 16. Acts
16. 15. 32. 1 Cor. 1. 16. The Argument from Genesis 17. 7, etc. is almost the
first and last in this business; and therefore is the more accurately to be
examined; but it has so many shapes, that I may here take up that Speech, With
what knot shall I hold shape-changing Proteus? But in the issue, it falls into
one or other of these forms:

The first thus; To whom the Gospel Covenant agrees, to them the sign of the
Gospel Covenant agrees also. But to the Infants of Believers the
Gospel Covenant agrees; therefore to them the sign of the Gospel Covenant
agrees, and consequently Baptism. The Minor is proved from Genesis 17. 7. where
God promises to Abraham, I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.

I answer, That we may meet with this Argument, diverse things are to be
examined, which are taken for granted:

First, Whether the Gospel Covenant, and the Covenant made with Abraham be the
same: Secondly, what seed of Abraham it is, of which it is said, I will be a
God to thee and to thy seed: Thirdly, whether there be the same reason of
circumcision and of baptism in signing the Gospel Covenant: Fourthly, whether
these terms be convertible [ Federate, and to be signed].

Of these, I say; 1. The Covenant made with Abraham, is not a pure
Gospel Covenant, but mixed, which I prove;

The Covenant takes its denomination from the promises; but the promises are
mixed, some Evangelical, belonging to those to whom the Gospel belongs, some
are Domestique, or Civil promises, specially respecting the House of Abraham,
and policy of Israel; Ergo.

That was Evangelical which we read, Genesis 17. 5. I have made thee a father of
many nations; and that which we find, Genesis 15. 5. so shall thy seed be; in
which it is promised, that there shall be of the Nations innumerable that shall
be Abraham's children by believing, Romans 4. 17, 18. It was Evangelical, which
we find, Genesis 12. 3. and Genesis 18. 18. and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of
the earth be blessed; for in these is promised blessing to Believers, of whom
Abraham is father, Gal. 3. 8, 9. and by Christ, who is the seed of Abraham,
Gal. 3. 16. Acts 3. 25.

Domestique and Civil promises were many; of the multiplying the seed of
Abraham, the birth of Isaac; of the continuation of the Covenant with Isaac; of
the coming of Christ out of Isaac; the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt, and
deliverance thence; of possessing the Land of Canaan, Genesis 15. 13. 18. Genesis 17.
7, 8. 15. 16. Act. 7. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. and many other places.

Yea, it is to be noted, that those promises which were Evangelical, according
to the more inward sense of the Holy Ghost, do point at the privileges of
Abraham's House, in the outward face of the words; whence it may be well
doubted, whether this Covenant made with Abraham, may be called simply
Evangelical, and so pertain to Believers, as such, although there be
Evangelical promises in that Covenant, pertaining to all Believers, as
Believers. There were annexed to the Covenant on Mount Sinai, sacrifices
pointing at the sacrifice of Christ, and yet we call not that Covenant simply
Evangelical, but in some respect.

Secondly, The seed of Abraham is many ways so called: First, Christ is called
the seed of Abraham, by excellency, Gal. 3. 16. Secondly, all the Elect, Romans
9. 7. all Believers, Romans 4. 11, 12. 16. 17, 18. are called the seed of
Abraham, that is, the spiritual seed. Thirdly, there was a natural seed of
Abraham, to whom the inheritance did accrue; this was Isaac, Genesis 21. 12.
Fourthly, a natural seed, whether lawful, as the sons of Keturah, or base, as
Ishmael, to whom the inheritance belonged not, Genesis 15. 5. But no where do I
find, that the Infants of Believers of the Gentiles are called Abraham's seed,
of the three former kinds of Abraham's seed, the promise recited, is meant, but
in a different manner thus: that God promises, he will be a God to Christ,
imparting in him blessing to all nations of the earth, to the spiritual seed
of Abraham in Evangelical benefits, to the natural seed inheriting, in
domestic and political benefits.

3. That the promise of the Gospel, or Gospel Covenant, was the same in all
ages, in respect of the thing promised, and condition of the covenant, which we
may call the substantial and essential part of that covenant, to wit, Christ,
Faith, Sanctification, Remission of sins, Eternal life; yet this Evangelical
covenant had diverse forms in which these things were signified, and various
sanctions, by which it was confirmed: To Adam, the promise was made under the
name of the seed of the woman, bruising the head of the Serpent; to Enoch,
Noah, in other forms; otherwise to Abraham, under the name of his seed, in whom
all nations should be blessed; otherwise to Moses, under the obscure shadows of
the Law; otherwise to David, under the name of a successor in the kingdom;
otherwise in the New Testament, in plain words, 2 Cor. 3. 6. Heb. 8. 10. It had
likewise diverse sanctions. The promise of the Gospel was confirmed to Abraham
by the sign of circumcision, and by the birth of Isaac; to Moses by the
Paschall Lamb, and the sprinkling of blood on the book, the rain of Mannah, and
other signs; to David by an oath; in the New Testament, by Christ's blood, 1
Cor. 11. 25. Therefore circumcision signified and confirmed the promise of the
Gospel, according to the form and sanction of the covenant with Abraham,
Baptism signifies and confirms the same promise according to the form,
sanction and accomplishment of the new Testament: Now these forms and sanctions
differ many ways, as much as concerns our present purpose in these: First,
circumcision confirmed not only Evangelical promises, but also Political; and
if we may believe Mr. Cameron, in his Theses of the threefold Covenant of God,
Thesi. 78. Circumcision did primarily separate the seed of Abraham from other
nations, sealed unto them the earthly promise; Secondarily, it did signify
sanctification: But Baptism signifies only Evangelical benefits. Secondly,
circumcision did confirm the promise concerning Christ to come out of Isaac;
Baptism assures Christ to be already come, to have been dead, and to have
risen again, Thirdly, circumcision belonged to the Church, constituted in the
House of Abraham, Baptism to the Church gathered out of all nations; whence I
gather, that there is not the same reason of circumcision and baptism, in
signing the Evangelical covenant; nor may there be an argument drawn from the
administration of the one to the like manner of administering the other.

4. That some there were circumcised, to whom no promise in the covenant made
with Abraham did belong; of Ishmael, God had said, that his covenant was not to
be established with him, but with Isaac; and yet he was circumcised, Genesis 17.
20, 21. 25. Romans 9. 7, 8, 9. Gal. 4. 29, 30. the same may be said of Esau: All
that were in Abraham's house, whether strangers, or born in his house, were
circumcised, Genesis 17. 12, 13. of whom nevertheless, it may be doubted, whether
any promises of the covenant made with Abraham, did belong to them; there were
other persons, to whom all, or most of the promises in the covenant pertained,
that were not circumcised; this may be affirmed of the Females, coming from
Abraham, the Infants dying before the eighth day, of just men, living out of
Abraham's house, as Melchisedech, Lot, Job. If any say, that the females were
circumcised in the circumcision of the Males, he says it without proof; and by
like, perhaps greater, reason it may be said, that the children of Believers
are baptized in the persons of their parents, and therefore are not to be
baptized in their own persons. But it is manifest that the Jews comprehended
in the covenant made with Abraham, and circumcised, were nevertheless not
admitted to Baptism by John Baptist, and Christ's Disciples, till they
professed repentance, and faith in Christ. Hence I gather, first, that the
right to Evangelical promises, was not the adequate reason of crrcumcising
these or those, but Gods precept, as is expressed, Genesis 17. 23. Genesis 21. 4.
Secondly, that those terms are not convertible, [ federate and to be signed].

Whereupon I answer to the Argument: First, either by denying the Major, if it
be universally taken, otherwise it concludes nothing: or by granting it with
this limitation; it is true of that sign of the covenant which agrees
universally in respect of form and sanction, to them that receive the Gospel,
but it is not true of that sign of the covenant, which is of a particular form
or sanctior of which sort is circumcision.

Secondly, I answer by denying the Minor, universally taken, the reason is,
because those children only of believing Gentiles, are Abraham's children, who
are his spiritual seed, according to the election of grace by faith, which are
not known to us, but by profession, or special Revelation.

THe second Argument is thus formed:. 2. The second Argument for Infant
baptism from the succession of Baptism to circumcision, examined.


To whom circumcision did agree, to them Baptism does agree, but to Infants
Circumcision did agree, therefore also Baptism.

The Major is thus proved: If the baptism of Christ succeed into the place of
circumcision, then Baptism belongs to them that circumcision belonged to; but
the Antecedent is true, therefore also the Consequent. The Minor is proved to
be true, because, Colos. 2. 11, 12. it is said the Colossians were circumcised,
because they were buried with Christ in Baptism.

For Answer: This Argument supposes Baptism to succeed in the place of
Circumcision, which may be understood many ways.

1. So as that the sense be, that those persons be to be baptized, which
heretofore by Gods command were to be circumcised, and in this sense the
Argument must proceed, if it conclude to the purpose; but in this sense it is
false, for no females were to be circumcised, which yet are to be baptized,
Acts 16. 14, 15. and Believers out of Abraham's house, as Lot, Melchisedech,
Job, were not to be circumcised, but believing Gentiles are universally to be
baptized.

2. It may be so understood, as if the rite of Baptism then began, when the
rite of circumcision did, or was of right to end; but this is not to be said:
For John Baptist and the Disciples of Christ baptized, Joh. 4. 1, 2. before
circumcision of right ceased, and they who first were circumcised, were after
baptized, being converted to the faith, as is manifest concerning Paul, Phil.
3. 5. Acts 9. 18.

3. It may be understood, as if Baptism did succeed into the place of
circumcision, in respect of its signification, which is true in some things:
First, it is true that both signified the righteousness of faith, Romans 4. 11.
Romans 6. 3. Gal. 3. 27. 1 Pet. 3. 21. Secondly, it is true, both signified
sanctification of the heart, and this is all that may be concluded out of the
place alleged, Col. 2. 11, 12. to which I think meet to add; that if the Text
be looked into, that place speaks not of any circumcision, but of Christ's
circumcision in whom we are complete, and by whose circumcision we are said to
put off the body of the sins of the flesh; nor does the Text say, we are
circumcised, because we are baptized; but we are complete in Christ, because we
are circumcised in him, and buried with him in Baptism, in which, or in whom,
ye are also risen together, through the faith of the operation of God that
raised him from the dead.

In some things Baptism does not succeed into the place of Circumcision, in
respect of signification: For, first Circumcision did signify Christ to come
of Isaac, according to the flesh, Genesis 17. 10. 21. but Baptism does not
signify this, but points at the incarnation, death, and resurrection of
Christ. Secondly, Circumcision was a sign that the Israelites were a people
separated from all nations, Romans 3. 1. but Baptism signifies, that all are
one in Christ, Gal. 3. 28. Thirdly, Circumcision signified that Moses Law was
to be observed, Gal. 5. 3. but Baptism does signify that Moses his Law is
made void, and the Doctrine of Christ to be retained, Acts 10. 37. Fourthly,
Circumcision did sign the promise of the Land of Canaan, Baptism eternal life
by Christ.

From hence I answer to the Argument: First, by denying the Major of the fore
Syllogism. Secondly, to the conditional Syllogism, by denying the
Consequence of the Major, if the Antecedent be understood of succession, in the
third sense, in respect of some signification granted; but if the succession be
understood in the first, second, or third sense, in respect of other
significations, the Minor is denied; the proof from Col. 2. 11, 12. is already
answered.

And indeed, if this Argument be not warily, and restrainedly understood, an
Egg is laid, out of which manifest Judaisme may be hatched, but if it be taken
restrainedly, no more follows thence, but that Baptism and Circumcision in
some things, signify the same, which is more plainly said of Noah's flood, 1
Pet. 3. 21. of the red Sea, and the cloud that guided, 1 Cor. 10. 2. and yet we
say not that Baptism succeeded into their place, much less do we infer any
rite to be instituted in their stead, respecting the same persons; yea verily
it is to be seriously thought on.

1. That by such Arguments drawn from Analogies, not conceived by the holy
Spirit, but drawn out of our wit, a new kind of instituting Rites, to wit,
from Analogies, is brought in, besides our Lords Precepts and the Apostles
examples.

2. This being once laid, by like manner of argumentation, it will be lawful
to bring into the Christian Church, under other names and forms, the whole
burden of Jewish Rites; yea, almost, out of what you will, to conclude what
you will; for who shall put a bound to men's wits faining Analogy, when they go
beyond the Lords Precepts, and the Apostles examples? It is well known, that
the divine appointment of tithes to be paid, and many other things, in the
writings of Divines, are asserted by this kind of Argument, besides the rule
of the Lords Precept and the Apostles example.

3. Hereby will the opinion of Papists be confirmed, who affirm from 1 Cor. 10.
11. the Sacraments of the Jews, to be types of the Sacraments of Christians,
which is rejected by Divines that dispute against Bellarmine.

4. This manner of arguing will countenance the Arguments of the Papists for an
universal Bishop, because there was an High Priest amongst the Jews; for
sacrificing Priests, because the Jews had such; for a linen garment at Mass,
because there was such among the Jews; for holy water, purification of women,
Easter, Pentecost, and many more such ceremonies, for which the Papist do in
like manner argue, as appears out of Durandus Rationals, and other Interpreters
of Rituals among the Papists; yea, what hinders, but we may give children the
Lords Supper, if we argue this way, since Samuel, Jesus Christ under age, were
partakers of the Passover, and of right, all the males were to appear thrice
in the year, before the Lord; and therefore it is certain they did eat the
Passover; and it shall be after showed, that the place, 1 Cor. 11. 28. will
not avoid this inconvenience, if the Text, Matthew. 28. 19. may be shifted off,
as Paedo-baptists use to do. Lest any man take this for a light suggestion, I
will add, that grave, godly and learned men, have often warned, that we are to
take heed, that we do not rashly frame arguments from Analogy: among others in
their late writings, in the English tongue, John Paget, in his Defense of
Church Government, part. 1. chap. 3. page 8. and elsewhere, John Ball in his
Reply to the Answer of the New England Elders, unto the 9. Positions, Posit. 2.
page 14.

Lastly, it is to be considered again and again, how by these Argumentations,
consciences may be freed from the danger of will worship and polluting so
remarkable an Ordinance of Christ as Baptism is, specially this care lies on
them, who by Prayers, Sermons, Writings, Covenants and Oaths, do deter
Christians from humane inventions, in Gods worship diligently, and as is to be
hoped sincerely.

THe third Argument is thus framed.. 3. The third Argument from the parity of
grace in the new Testament to that in the old examined.


If Baptism be not granted to the Infants of Believers, then the grace of God
will be more restrained in the new Testament then in the old: but this is not
to be affirmed; therefore Baptism is to be granted to Infants of Believers.

Answ. 1. If this Argument be of any weight, it will prove that the grace of
God is straitened, because we give not the Lords Supper to children, to whom
the Passover was given, as appears by that which was above said.

2. The grace of God is not tied to Sacraments, neither do Sacraments give
grace by the work done, and therefore grace is not restrained, though
Sacraments be never granted, grace is not denied to an excommunicated person,
who is inhibited the Lords Supper, the Grace of God is free, whether we
understand it of the divine affection, or the effects of it; nor can be made
larger or narrower by our act.

3. Yet it is not absurd to say, that in respect of some privileges, the Grace
of God is more contracted in the new Testament then in the old: For instance,
no family has now the privilege that was granted to Abraham's family, that out
of it Christ should be born; no man besides Abraham is called The father of the
faithful; no woman besides one, The mother of Christ; nevertheless, simply
the grace of God is said to be larger in the new Testament, by reason of the
revelation of the Gospel imparted to all nations, the more abundant
communication of the holy Spirit, and more plain manifestation of the mystery
of the Gospel: I would have it weighed, whether those phrases of the Apostle,
Romans 11. 21. as the natural branches, ver. 24. The wild Olive by nature,
were it graffed contrary to nature. These which be natural branches, do not
sufficiently imply, that the Jews children by their birth had a privilege
beyond the Gentiles children.

Thereupon I answer to the Argument: First, by denying the consequence of the
Major, for the reason given: Secondly, by denying the Minor, if it be
understood of straitning the grace of God, in respect of some privilege,
although the Assumption may be granted, if understood of the straitning Gods
grace simply.

The sum of the Answer to the Arguments, drawn from Genesis 17. 17. is this: The
Sacraments are not to be administered according to rules taken from our
reasonings, but Gods appointment. Rightly does Mr. Ball forenamed, in the Book
forenamed, Posit. 3. and 4. page 38. say, But in whatsoever Circumcision and
Baptism, do agree or differ, we must look to the institution, and neither
stretch it wider, nor draw it narrower then the Lord has made it, for he is
the institutor of the Sacraments according to his own good pleasure; and it is
our part to learn of him, both to whom, how, and for what end the Sacraments
are to be administered, how they agree, and wherein they differ, in all which we
must affirm nothing, but what God has taught us, and as he has taught us.

THe Argument from Acts 2.. 4. The Argument from Act. 2. 38, 39. for
Infant Baptism examined.
38, 39. may be thus formed: To whom the promise is made, they may be baptized;
but to the Infants of Believers the promise is made, therefore they may be
baptized.

The Minor is proved from the words of verse. 39. for the promise is made to you
and to your children.

That an Answer may be fitted to this Argument:

1. It is to be observed, that the promise made, is the sending of Jesus
Christ, and blessing by him, as it is expounded, Acts 3. 25, 26. Acts 13. 32,
33. Romans 15. 8, 9.

2. That the Text says, the promise was made to them he spoke to, and their
children, then to them that are afar off, who, whether they be Gentiles, who
are said to be afar of, Ephesians. 2. 12. or Jews, in future ages and
generations, as Beza thinks, are limited by the words closing the verse, as
many as the Lord our God shall call, which limitation plainly enough shows the
promise to appertain to them not simply as Jews, but as called of God, which
is more expressly affirmed, Acts 3. 26. To you, God having raised up his Son
Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his
iniquity: or as Beza, Every one of you turning your selves from your
iniquities; therefore the promise here is not said to be made but with
condition of calling, and faith, which may be confirmed abundantly from Romans
4. 13, 14. 16. Gal. 3. 9. 14. 22.

3. That Peter, verse. 38. does exhort to repentance and Baptism together, and
in the first place persuades to Repentance, then Baptism, which shows
Repentance to be in order before Baptism.

4. That mention is made of the promise, not as of it self, yielding right to
Baptism without Repentance, but as a motive, inciting together, to Repentance
and Baptism. Whereupon it is answered:

1. That the Major is to be limited, to whom the promise is made, they may be
baptized, to wit, when they are called, and have showed signs of repentance;
If it be taken without limitation, it is to be denied.

2. By denying the Minor, if it be universally taken of all Infants of
Believers, of whose Baptism the question is; as for the Text, it speaks not
expressly of Infants, but of children indefinitely; nor of the children of the
Gentiles at all, (of whom we are) but of the children of the Jews, and
therefore, if that promise be extended to Infants, which does not appear, the
promise is to be expounded so, as to note something peculiar to the Jews
Infants.

THe Argument from the place,. 5. The Argument from 1 Cor. 7. 14. for
Infant Baptism, examined.
1 Cor. 7. 14. may be thus formed: They who are holy with Covenant-holinesse,
may be baptized: But the Infants of a Believer are holy, with a
Covenant-holinesse; for it is said in the Text, but now they are holy;
therefore they may be baptized. I answer:

1. The Minor is not true, universally understood, as is manifest from Romans 11.
16. where it is said, If the first fruits be holy, so is the lump: if the root
be holy, so are the branches. The sense is, that Abraham is the first fruits,
and holy root; the elect Israelites are the branches and lump; so that it
follows, that the elect of the Israelites not yet called, are holy in respect
of the Covenant, and are not yet therefore to be baptized; for although they
may be said to be holy in regard of the Covenant, of old entered into with
Abraham, and the gracious respect of God to them, to be manifested in opportune
time, yet in their present state, before calling, they denying Christ, neither
Infants nor grown men are to be baptized, unless we would have the branches
broken off to be graffed into the Church; and therefore, although the sense
were in the place of 1 Cor. 7. 14. your children are holy with
Covenant-holinesse, by reason of Gods gracious favor to be manifested in due
time, yet it will not follow, that they are to be baptized, who have not yet
yielded any shows of divine grace.

2. The Minor is not proved from the place alleged: For it does not speak of
federall holiness, but of holiness, that I may so call it, Matrimonial, so
that the sense is, your children are holy, that is, legitimate. Whether any in
the ages before, the age last past, expounded it, of federall holiness, as
they call it, I am not yet certain: as for the exposition of that place, of
that holiness, I called Matrimonial, of it the place is expounded by Aquinas,
in his Commentary upon the place, and perhaps by others, whom I have not yet
had time to look into, but I think best to set down the words of Joachimus
Camerarius, about this matter, in his Commentary on the new Testament, lately
printed at Cambridge; [for the unbelieving husband has been sanctified] an
usual change of the Tense, that is, is sanctified, in the lawful use of
marriage, for without this ( he says) it would be, that their children should
be unclean, that is, infamous, and not legitimate, who so are holy, that is,
during the marriage are without all blot of ignominy: Moreover, Melancthon in
his Commentary on the place, Therefore Paul answers, that the marriages are not
to be pulled asunder, for their unlike opinions of God, if the impious person
do not cast away the other; and for comfort he adds as a reason, the
unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife, of which Speech diverse
interpretations are made, but the true and natural is this, as elsewhere, he
says, Meat is sanctified, for that which is holy in use, that is granted to
Believers from God, so here he speaks the use of marriage to be holy, and to be
granted of God, [else were] the interpretation of the Sept. so speaks unclean,
it calls unclean that which is prohibited; as we say Swines flesh was unclean
by the Law of Moses, that is, prohibited, or a woman brought to bed, is
unclean, that is, whose touching is forbidden. The connection of the Argument is
this: If the use of marriage should not please God, your children would be
bastards, and so unclean; but your children are not bastards, therefore the use
of marriage pleases God: How bastards were unclean in a peculiar manner, the
Law shows, Deuteronomy. 23. Let not a bastard enter into the Congregation of the
Lord, to the tenth generation, that is, Let him be admitted to no function in
the Church; therefore this is the most plain meaning, children are not
bastards, nor to be kept away, as the Law of Moses kept them away; therefore
also the use of marriage pleases God. Musculus Comment. on 1 Cor. 7. 14. has
these words; [is sanctified] this expresses the reason of that which he says,
Let him not put her away; perhaps, the more unskilful Christians thought such
dwelling together to be unclean and unlawful; and they did fear, lest they
should be made one body with the yoak-fellow that was an Idolater, as he that
is joined to an Harlot, is made one body with the Harlot, and so of the members
of Christ, should make them members of an Idolater, which has more sin then if
they should make them the members of an Harlot; for this cause, he says, for
the unbeliever is sanctified, etc. that is, for the unbelieving husband in the
wife, that is, in the conjunction of the wife, which is by marriage, even long
ago has been cleansed by virtue of marriage; so that his conjunction and
copulation, has nothing unclean: so in like manner also, the unbelieving wife,
by reason of lawful wedlock, in which she is joined to the man, even long ago
is cleansed, that the believer is not defiled, if she live together with him;
for the word holiness here, is taken for the cleanness of the marriage bed
which he has by the tradition of God, therefore he says, else your children
should be unclean, but now they are holy; he should have said, but now they are
clean, if to be holy, and clean, in this place were not the same.

Therefore the most plain understanding of this place is, first, in that we
understand not the word holiness, of that holiness which is by the covenant
of God, or the Spirit of faith, by which Believers are sanctified, as a people
of God, but of the holiness of the conjugall bed, otherwise it will bring
forth a troublesome dispute, how an unbelieving husband may be said to be
sanctified. Then, that we attribute this sanctification that is cleanness, not
to the faith of the believing yoak-fellow, but to the marriage, by reason of
the appointment of God; with Hierome, who says, because by Gods appointment,
marriage is holy; and Ambrose, who has it thus, the children are holy, because
they are born of lawful marriage; therefore, that in the wife and in the
husband, is not to be read with the addition of Believer, as the old
Interpreter has it, but simply, as the Greek has it; if any thing be to be
added, it is better to be added, the lawful wife or husband, that we may
understand, that the unbelieving husband is cleansed in his lawful wife, that
is, by virtue of their lawful marriage, is not unclean, but clean, as far as
appertains to the law of cohabitation of marriage, although he be impure so far
as appertains to the commerce of Religion, of which the word of Deacons in the
Church was, Let the profane depart, the holy draw near. [else your children]
Ambrose so expounds this particle [else] that is, if thou the believing husband
should put away thy unbelieving wife, and marry another, your children should
be unclean, because you should be made Adulterers, but [now] that is, if thou
retain thy unbelieving wife, they are holy, because they are born of a lawful
marriage. But it is more plain, that we understand the Apostle, to have respect
to the sanctimony of marriage, even of them who without the faith of Christ,
are conjoined in marriage, as if he had said, unless marriage were holy and
clean, even between unbelievers, what other thing would follow, then that all
the children of Infidels are bastards, and unclean? but far be it from us to
say so; they are holy, for they are born of lawful marriage. Ambrose looks to
that which he said, Let him not put her away; the other Exposition to that
which he said, the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife. I have
sometimes abused the present place against the error of Anabaptists, keeping
back Infants of Christians from Baptism, thinking that speech, but now are
they holy, to be the same, as, they are the people of God, by reason of the
believing parents; but although it be sure in it self, that the children of
believers, are both holy, and pertaining to the people of God, by reason of the
participation of the Covenant, and so are partakers of Baptism, as the sign of
the Covenant, yet the present place makes nothing to this cause, in which the
sanctimony of the Covenant and people is not meddled with; but the cleanness
of lawful marriage even of Infidels: for not only to children, to whom
perhaps, the holiness of a believing parent, may so appertain, that for it
they may be partakers of the Covenant, but also to unbelieving husbands and
wives is sanctimony ascribed, although they oppose the Christian faith; nor is
any other holiness or cleanness of children meddled with, then that which
agrees also to unbelieving parents, for to them, no other agrees, then that
which is by lawful marriage. There Is other testimonies out of Scripture, from
whence the Anabaptists may be convinced of error; so that there is no need to
use this place against them. Thus far Camerarius, Melancthon, Musculus.

Perhaps some one will object, that no where is holy, the same with legitimate:
to which I answer, That holiness is put for Chastity, is manifested from 1
These. 4. 3. 4. 7. and the word [sanctified] in this place, what does it found
else, then [is lawfully coupled] and [is sanctified] 1 Timothy 4. 5. what else
does it signify, then [is lawfully used]? at which place Beza has these
words, Therefore meats are said to be sanctified, which we use lawfully, and
with Gods good leave; he alludes to legal purifications, and the difference
between clean and unclean meats: And why may not by a like allusion, unclean,
be put for Bastards, and holy for legitimate? for the Bastard is among the
unclean, Deuteronomy. 23. 2. To which I may add what John Calvin has on Mal. 2. 15.
Wherefore has God made one? to wit, seeking a seed of God; a seed of God is
here taken for legitimate, as the Hebrews do name that divine whatsoever does
excel, yea, they call that divine which is pure from any fault and spot:
therefore he sought a seed of God, that is, appointed marriage; from whence
should be born a legitimate and clean offspring. Secretly therefore does the
Prophet here show, that they are all bastards, that shall be born by polygamy,
because they neither can, nor ought to be counted legitimate sons, but they who
are begotten according to Gods institution, but where the husband violates the
faith given to the wife, and takes to himself another, as he perverts the order
of marriage, so also he cannot be a lawful father. Thus Calvin, and in like
manner Cameron praelect. in Mat. 19. 5. interprets that Text.

Lastly, if the words of the Text be weighed, this will seem the only and
genuine sense; for the question which the Apostle resolves was, whether the
conjunction was to be retained of the believing yoak-fellow, with the
unbelieving? The reason of doubting was, because that conjunction seems impure,
by reason of the impurity of the unbelieving yoak-fellow; the Apostle answers,
not so: For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified in the wife. To draw
out the sense of this place, it is to be noted, that [ the unbelieving husband]
sounds the same, as if he had said, [ the husband, though he be an unbeliever];
for the scope requires that this be the sense, the Husband, though he be an
unbeliever, yet is sanctified in the wife.

2. That it is not said, in the believing wife, nor in the believing husband
(though I deny not Beza observed some such thing in the Clermont copy, and
elsewhere): For the copies do not so read, and it seems the Apostle of purpose
so spoke, that the reason of Sanctification may be intimated to be taken, not
from the faith of the yoak-fellow, but conjugall relation.

3. [(...)] is not rightly rendered, [ by] in the vulgar and our English
translation, as if the sense were, that the faith of the wife, were the cause
of sanctifying the unbelieving husband, for this sense cannot be fastened to
this place; for no man will say, the faith of the unbelieving wife, sanctifies
the unbelieving husband federally; so that the unbelieving husband should be
capable of Baptism by his wifes faith, (which yet, by the good leave of such
men be it said, does as well follow from this place, as that the son is
federally holy, and capable of Baptism, for the faith of the parent) neither
can it be said, that the parent is sanctified with spiritual sanctification by
the faith of the wife; for how ever it be determined that faith is the cause of
inward sanctification, yet it is certain that the faith of one is not the cause
of the sanctification of another, I mean, the next and effectual cause. Nor
does this sense pertain hither, the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the
wife, that is, is renewed in the spirit of his mind, by the diligence of his
wife, instructing him in the faith, as she is said to save, verse. 16. For this
sanctification being put, the children may remain impure, and not holy; the
contrary whereof is here asserted: and this sanctification is contingent, it
may be, or it may not be, as is manifest from verse. 16. For how know thou?
But in this place the sanctification is certain and necessary, else it should
not take away the doubt, about the retaining the conjunction; nor does the
sense pertain hither, the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, that
is, the wife, because she has faith, has used the unbelieving husband without
all scruple of conscience; for the contrary was the occasion of this Discourse;
nor does this belong a whit to the impurity or holiness of the children;
therefore more rightly [(...)] is rendered in Latin in the Dative, Mat. 17. 12.
[to the wife] for the particle (...), is often so used, as Gal. 1. 16. (...),
Acts 7. 44.
to me, 2 Pet. 1. 5. (...), to faith, Acts 4. 12. (...), to men; and 1 Cor. 7.
15. (...), is rendered by Beza unto peace: the sense then is, that the
unbelieving husband is sanctified to the wife, that is, is not coupled as an
unclean fornicator, but as a lawful husband, and that copulation is holy, that
is, remains chaste, the unbeliever remaining a husband; for an unbeliever is a
husband, and therefore the use of him is chaste, [else] the Apostle proves what
he had said, of the sanctification of the unbelieving husband, to the wife, and
the order being turned, by an argument from an absurdity, which may be reduced
unto this form:

If the unbelieving husband be not sanctified to the wife, and the order
turned, then your children should be unclean; but your children are not
unclean, but holy; Ergo. [(...), else] plainly shows, that absurdity would
follow, if this were not granted, that the unbelieving husband is sanctified to
the wife, (...), otherwise certainly, as Beza renders it, your children are
unclean, that is, your children which you have have hitherto begotten, should
be unclean, that is, bastards, but now they are holy: [ but now] Beza rightly
notes it, is not an Adverb of time, but a Conjunction, that is wont to be used
in the Assumptions of Arguments, and the sense is, [ but now] that is, but for
as much as the unbelieving husband is sanctified to the wife, that is, in
respect of the use of the wife, your children are holy, that is, lawfully
begotten and born; but if it be granted the sanctification is understood of
lawful and chaste use, (which is necessarily to be yielded) and yet the
uncleanness and holiness be understood of that which they call federall, then
this will follow, that the children born of wives superadded to the first,
incestuous, concubines and harlots are not within the Covenant, neither to be
circumcised nor baptized, whereas not only Ishmael by Abraham, but also many
sons of Jacob, the sons of Judah, Pharez and Zarah by Thamar, were circumcised;
nor does custom or canon put such back children from Baptism; but in very
deed, this cannot be the sense, for only holiness, which I call Matrimonial, of
the children, follows from Matrimonial lawful copulation, which is here
asserted, and only uncleanness opposite to legitimation, follows illegitimate,
and polluted copulation, and of these alone there was doubt amongst the
Corinthian Christians, and therefore the Apostles resolution.

Nor yet, as Beza inferres, if this sense be put, should the Apostle draw an
argument from civil Laws, to pacify conscience, but he using his Apostolical
authority, resolves the doubts in this Chapter, and teaches, that according to
Gods Law, and Christ's Precept, the marriage is not dissolved by the infidelity
of either yoak-fellow, but that they may lawfully dwell together, and couple,
according to Gods institution of Marriage. As for that which Beza says, No man
has ever said truly, that marriage is holy between two unbelievers, and that
their children are holy, since their meats are unclean to them, as being to be
sanctified by the Word, and giving of thanks; it is true, if we speak of the
sanctification of the heart, but it is manifest from that which is before said,
that the Apostle speaks of the sanctification and sanctity, that is in
chastity, and legitimation, and in respect of it Beza grants the marriage of
Infidels not to be accounted before God for fornication; for marriage is
honorable among all, even unbelievers, and the bed undefiled, but Whoremongers
and Adulerers God will judge, Heb. 13. 4. but honor and holiness sound the
same, 1 These. 4. 4.

THe Argument from Mat.. 6. The Arguments from Mat. 19. 15. for Infant Baptism
exmined.
19. 15. Mar. 10. 14. 16. Luke 18. 15, 16, 17. may be formed in diverse manners:
First thus; they are to be baptized, whom Christ commands to be brought to him,
being moved with indignation toward his disciples, that repelled them.

But Christ commands Infants to be brought to him. Ergo. That this Argument may
be examined, it is to be considered:

1. Who they were that brought these children.

2. What little children they were that were brought.

3. Upon what motives.

4. To what end.

5. What time.

6. In what place they brought them.

7. For what cause the Apostles did repel them.

8. For what cause Christ being angry with the Apostles, com- ^

In many of these, we have scarce any thing beside conjectures, which we may
follow, neither have I leisure or books to look into all things which
Commentators have discoursed concerning these heads.

As for the first, it it is supposed that the bringers were either parents, or
other believers, who at least wished well to the little children; which is
probable from the end for which they brought them, to wit, that he might bless
them, and pray for them, for this showed faith and love.

As for the second, it is probable they were children of Jews, because this was
done in the coasts of Judea, Mat. 19. 1. Mar. 10. 1. But whether the parents of
the children believed in Christ or otherwise, is not manifest.

As for the third, concerning the motive, there is little certain, whether it
were upon the sight, or hearing of that which Christ did, Mat. 18. 2. or from a
custom among the Jews, of seeking the blessing of Prophets and holy men, for
their little ones, as Rebecca for Jacob, Joseph for his sons; or from the fame
of things done upon the prayers of Christ; or an instinct from God, that
occasion might be given of teaching the things that Christ taught upon this
matter; or some other motive.

As for the fourth, the end is expressed by Matthew, that he might put on hands
and pray; by Mark and Luke, tha the might touch them, which tends to impart a
blessing.

As for the fifth, Matthew points at the time, by the particle [ then] and both
Mark and Matthew, put it after the dissertation, with the Pharisees concerning
divorce, and the answer to the Disciples exception, which Mark testifies was
made in the house; Luke puts it after the parable of the Publican and the
Pharisee, but he is wont to relate things out of their right place. But what
the holy Spirit does intimate, by noting the time precisely, I guess not,
unless perhaps he would have it noted, that an occasion was opportunely
ministered, of amplifying the argument concerning making a man's self an Eunuch
for the kingdom of heaven, though this reason does not very much like me.

As for the sixth, the place is intimated, Mat. 19. 1. Mar. 10. 1. in the
coasts of Judea, beyond Jordan, in Matthew; By the farther side of Jordan, in
Mark; about which it avails not to our present purpose to inquire.

As for the seventh, the reason of repelling, is not known, but by conjecture,
it is probable this bringing of little children, was troublesome to them, either
because it did interrupt Christ's Speech about marriage, and fitness to the
Kingdom of heaven, or because they sought rest in the house, or because they
did think this bringing would be in vain.

As for the eighth, Christ without doubt, was angry with the Disciple, because
they hindered the occasion of doing good to men, whereas Christ went about doing
good, Act. 10. 38. And in this business the faith of the bringers was to be
cherished, and the power of blessing in Christ was to be manifested, and the
excellent doctrine to be delivered, concerning little childrens being capable
of the Kingdom of heaven, of the quality of them who receive the Kingdom of
heaven; but whether Christ would that this fact should remain, as a perpetual
rule for baptizing the Infants of Believers, is yet a question. It seems,
scarce probable it should be so.

1. Because Baptism of Infants, being merely positive, so obscure and
doubtful an institution, is without example and reason.

2. Because we find no practice or hint in Scripture, which may expound this
fact to this sense.

3. Because, if he had given a command to the Apostles of baptizing Infants, he
had rather said, bring the little children to me, then suffer them to be
brought to me.

4. He had declared whose Infants he would have baptized, and not have spoken
so indefinitely, it is certain, before the command, Mat. 28. 19, 20. There is
no Precept extant, concerning baptizing Gentiles, much less concerning
baptizing the Infants of the Gentiles.

5. The words, suffer and forbid not, and (...), these little children, as Beza
reads, show that Christ's words are meant only of those children.

6. If this fact pertain to Baptism, then we must say, that Christ baptized,
the contrary whereof is said, Joh. 4. 2. As for that which is objected, that
three Evangelists rehearse this fact, that thence a perpetual rule may be
drawn, of bringing Infants to Christ by an outward Ordinance, which is not done
but by Baptism, it is weak: For,

1. Three Evangelists rehearse the bringing of the palsy man to Christ, the
access of the leprous person to Christ, and many other things, from which yet
no perpetual rule is formed.

2. If any rule be hence to be formed, that is to be perpetually observed, this
relation will serve more fitly to establish Episcopal confirmation, by laying
on hands, and praying, then Presbyteriall baptism.

Secondly, we must distinguish, concerning bringing to Christ; there is a
bringing to Christ, by local admotion, there is another bringing to Christ by
spiritual instruction; this bringing to Christ, is the cause of Baptism, not
the other: for many were brought by the command of Christ, to Christ, as the
blind son of Timaeus, and others, of whose baptism, or conversion we read
not; for not all that were corporally healed by Christ, were also spiritually
healed, as we are to say of the nine Lepers. Malchus and others.

3. The Argument supposes they may be baptized, whom Christ commands to be
brought, but neither is this true of spiritual bringing; for not those whom he
commands to be brought spiritually, are to be baptized, but those whom he has
brought; as for that which is said, they are repelled from Christ, that are
repelled from Baptism, it is a light thing, for Baptism does not bring men to
Christ, unless the persons be first in Christ; neither is therefore any man
repelled from Christ, because he is not baptized, but when he is kept back,
being fit for baptism.

To the Argument therefore answer is made, by denying the Major universally
taken.

Secondly, the Argument is thus formed:

Arg. Those whom Christ embraced, laid his hands on, blessed, may be baptized;
But Christ embraced Infants, etc. Ergo.

Answ. I answer, this argument supposes these acts of Christ, to have been all
one, as if he had baptized, but this is said without proof, in very deed, that
act of blessing was more then Baptism, and yet it had not the same reason with
Baptism; it is manifest out of Joh. 4. 2. that Baptism was an act of
ministry, which Christ did not exercise by himself, but his Disciples, but that
blessing was an act, by which he obtained some singular gift from God by
prayers for those Infants, upon whom he had laid his hands; nor is this benefit
said to be bestowed on them for the faith of their parents, but out of singular
favor which Christ bestowed upon many, as Lazarus, with his sisters, John the
Apostle and others, therefore the Major Proposition is to be denied; for there
is no connection between this act, which is extraordinary, and the act of
ordinary ministry, which is to be fulfilled according to the Lords
prescription.

The third Argument is thus formed.

Arg. They may be baptized, whose is the Kingdom of heaven; but of Infants is
the Kingdom of heaven; Ergo.

Answ. I answer, the Major Proposition is true, if it be understood of those
whose is the Kingdom of heaven, when it appears that the Kingdom of heaven
belongs to them, otherwise it is not true. Secondly, it is not said in the Text
[ of Infants is the kingdom of heaven] but, of such is the kingdom of heaven;
and Christ expounds what he means, Mar. 10. 15. Luke 18. 17. to wit, of them
who in humility of mind, are like little children, as it is Mat. 18. 3, 4. but
if [ of such] be to be expounded, as Beza would, Annot. in Mat. 19. 14. of
these and the like, as above, 18. it is not proved from thence, that the
kingdom of heaven pertains to all Infants of Believers, but to them whom he
then blessed, and to those persons who either are so blessed, or are converted
and humble as little children.

Whence it is answered; first by denying the Major, if it be expounded
universally and unrestrainedly: secondly, by denying the Minor, as it is put
indefinitely, for the reasons above put.

THe Argument from the place,. 7. The Argument from Acts 15. 16. etc. for
Infant Baptism examined.
Act. 16. 15. 32. 33. Act. 18. 8. 1 Cor. 1. 16. is thus formed: If the Apostle
baptized whole households, then Infants; but the Apostle baptized whole
households, Ergo.

Answ. This Argument rests on a slight conjecture, that there were Infants in
those houses, and that those Infants were baptized, whereas the words of the
Text evince not these things, yea, those things which are said, Acts 16. 32. He
spoke the Word of the Lord to him, and to all in his house; and verse. 33. He
rejoiced, believing God with all his house. Act. 18. 8. Crispus believed the
Lord with his whole house, do plainly prove, that under the name of the whole
house, are understood those only that heard the Word of God and believed.
Whence it is answered by denying the consequence of the Major Proposition.

Some other arguments occur, which make a number without strength.

FIrst,. 8. The Argument from general promises for Infant Baptism examined.
it is argued from general promises, made to the godly and their seed, Exodus
20. 6. Psalm. 112. 2, etc. Whence it is gathered, that God makes a difference
betwixt the children of the godly and the wicked, that he promises blessing to
those, not to these, therefore the children of the godly are to be baptized,
not the other.

Answ. The promises recited, are first general and indefinite; secondly, for
the most part concerning corporal good things; thirdly, with the exception of
free election; fourthly, to be understood with the employed condition of faith
and repentance, and so they serve not to this purpose.

SEcondly, 9. The Argument from Isa. 49. 22. for Infant Baptism examined.
from Isai. 49. 22. it is foretold that Gentiles should bring their sons in
their arms, and their daughters on their shoulders, therefore the Prophet
foresaw in spirit, the baptism of the little ones of the Gentiles.

Answ. First, little ones might be brought for other ends then baptism, as
Mat. 19. 15.

Secondly, I will use the words of Francis Junius in his Annot. on the place,
All these things are said Allegorically, of the spiritual amplification of the
kingdom of Christ, as the Prophets are wont, they are fulfilled in the
persuasions in which the Gentiles exhorted their children to embrace Christ.

THirdly,. 10. The Argument from 1 Cor. 10. 2. for Infant Baptism ex^
from 1 Cor. 10. 2. All our fathers were baptized, therefore also Infants.

I answer, first, if this verse prove that Infants were baptized, the verses
following will prove that they received the Lords Supper.

2. The sense is not that they were formally baptized, with the rite of
Baptism, begun by John Baptist, and ordained by Christ; but that by a like
representation, the sea and the cloud signified salvation to them by Christ as
baptism does to us, and that they were in a like condition, as if they had
been baptized.

FOurthly,. 11. The Argument from Ephesians. 5. 26. for Infant Baptism examined.
from Ephesians. 5. 26. where it is said, that Christ cleansed the Church with the
washing of water through the Word, therefore Infants either belong not to the
Church, and so are excluded from the benefit of Christ's death, or they are to
be baptized.

Answ. If this Argument be of force, the thief crucified with Christ, and
repenting on the cross, Infants, Catechumeni, Martyrs, and others, dying
before baptism, are excluded out of the Church, and from the benefit of
Christ's death; we are therefore to say, that either the Church is taken for the
more famous part of the Church, or that purification is to be understood of
that, which is for the most part.

FIfthly,. 12. The Argument from 1 Pet. 2. 9. for Infant Baptism examined.
from 1 Pet. 2. 9. Believers are called a chosen generation, a holy nation,
which things are said of the Israelites, Exo. 19. 5, 6. therefore Believers of
the nations obtain the same birth-priviledges, which the Israelites had, and
therefore their children are within the Covenant, and to be baptized as the
children of the Israelites were to be circumcised.

Answ. 1. If this Argument proceed, it will follow, that there is some
nationall-church among the Gentiles, as of old among the Jews, which is not to
be granted, which I would have understood in this sense, there is now no such
nationall-church, as amongst the Israelites, so as that a person should be
accounted a member of a church, in that he is an Englishman, Scot, Dutchman,
etc. In this speech I oppose not them which affirm the outward government of
the Church should be subject to national Synods. 2. Exodus 19. 5, 6. God speaks
not of a privilege flowing from birth, but obedience. 3. The Epistle was
written to the dispersed Jews, and therefore the Argument lies liable to
exception, when it is drawn from that which is said of the Jews, as if it were
said of the Gentiles. 4. But letting these things pass, the sense is, ye which
believe, as it is verse. 7. whom God has called out of darkness, are a holy
nation, whether Jews or Gentiles, by spiritual regeneration, as Believers are
called a family or kindred, Ephesians. 3. 15. the household of faith, Gal. 6. 10.
the house of God, 1 Timothy 3. 15. a people, 1 Pet. 2. 10. wherefore in this
family, kindred, house, people, are only Believers, whom not carnal birth, but
spiritual causes to be reckoned in that number.

SIxthly,. 13. The Argument ^ churches failing, if infant baptism be not
lawful examined.
the Church of God fails not, but we must say, the Church of God has failed,
if baptism of Infants be not lawful, Ergo.

Answ. 1. The Church of God may consist without baptism, as in the crucified
converted thief, etc. Secondly, neither perhaps, is it necessary to be said,
that the baptism of Infants, because not lawful, is therefore nall. Thirdly,
there was in the Church Baptism of persons grown, in all ages. Ludov. Vives in
his Comment. upon Aug. de Civit. Dei. lib. 1. cap. 27. has these words, No man
of old was brought unto Sacro baptisterio admovebatur.
the place of holy baptism unless he were of grown age already, and when the
same person knew what that mystical water meant, and desired to be washed in
it, and that more then once, an Image of which thing we see yet, in our
baptism of Infants; for as yet the Infant, though born the same day, or the
day before, is asked, whether he would be baptized, and that thrice; for whom
the sureties answer, that he would. I hear in some cities in Italy, that the
old custom, for a great part is yet preserved.

SEventhly,. 14. The Argument from Heb. 6 2. for Infant Baptism examined.
Heb. 6. 2. the Apostle speaks of the doctrine of baptismes, and laying on of
hands; now this is not likely to be understood of laying on of hands in healing
sick persons, or bestowing the Holy Ghost, for these were extraordinary or
miraculous, and therefore not to be put in the number of the principles of the
oracles of God, the foundation, milk for babes, nor of imposition of hands for
ordination to special function in the church, for that, though ordinary, yet
not likely to be put among the principles, the foundation, milk for babes,
therefore it remains, that it was the laying on of hands on children formerly
baptized in infancy, which though corruptly made a Sacrament by Papists, and
superstitiously abused, yet being freed from the abuse were very useful, as
being an Apostolical ordinance, from this Text, and manifests that there was
Infant Baptism in the Apostles days, which is confirmed, because it is
coupled with baptism, and therefore seems to be a consequent upon it.

Answ. 1. There is great incertainty, what this imposition of hands mentioned,
Heb. 6. 2. served for, the reason to prove that it could not be either for
healing, or giving the Holy Ghost, because they were miraculous or
extraordinary, is not cogent; for though they were by more then ordinary power,
yet were they frequent in those times, and might well be put among the elements
to be in those days first learned: nor is the reason cogent to prove it could
not be the imposition of hands in ordination, for special function in the
Church; for it is more likely that it should be meant, which it is certain was
still in use, and to continue to be used, and therefore it was needful to be
taught younglings, as well as the doctrine of baptismes: then laying on of
hands for confirmation of baptism, of which there is no certainty (though
pretended examples) in Scripture, be brought to give some color to it; nor is
imposition of hands in ordination unfitly coupled to baptism, both being
ordinances for initiation, the one into the pro- ^

2. But if it were supposed that this imposition of hands, meant Heb. 6. 2.
were on the baptized; yet this proves not the baptism of Infants in the
Apostles days, unless it could be proved that it was used after the baptism
of Infants only, for a confirmation either of the baptism, or baptized. Or the
contrary, it is apparent out of Tertul. de corona militis, c. 3. that in the
primitive times the baptisied did make his confession at baptism, sub manu
antistitis, that is, the Minister laying hands on him. And to save labor in
reciting testimonies, Chamier may be seen, who in his Pans. Catholica, tom. 4.
l. 4. c. 11. sec. 14. at large proves out of the Ancients, that the imposition
of hands, which after was made a distinct Sacrament, called Confirmation, was
either a part or appendix of Baptism: and many passages he cites to show, that
it was when the baptized was to confess the faith, and to renounce Satan: And
if Hierom, tom. 2. in his Dialogue against the Luciferians, do assert that use
of Imposition of hands from Scripture, yet he alleges not Heb. 6. 2. for it,
but the examples of giving the Holy Ghost by laying on of hands, in the Acts of
the Apostles.

THe second Argument follows:

That which agrees not with the Lords institution of Baptism, Arg. 2.
that is deservedly doubtful.. 15. The argument from the institution of
Christ, Mat. 28. 19. against Infant Baptism, confirmed.


But the rite of Infant Baptism agrees not with the Lords institution of
Baptism, Ergo.

The Major is proved, because Institution is the rule of exhibiting worship to
God.

The Minor is proved from the words of Insti^ution, Mat. 28. 19. Going
therefore, disciple ye all nations, baptizing them.

Whence I gather thus:

That rite agrees not with the Lords institution of Baptism, according to
which they are baptized, whom the Lord appointed not to be baptized.

But after the rite of Infant Baptism, they are baptized whom the Lord
appointed not to be baptized, Ergo.

The Major is manifest of it self.

The Minor is proved: The Lord appointed not Infants to be baptized, Ergo. The
Antecedent is proved;

Those, and no other, the Lord appointed to be baptized, who have been made
disciples.

But this cannot be said of Infants. Ergo.

The argument is confirmed from John 4. 2. where it is said that Jesus made
more disciples, then, that he baptized: first it is said that he made
disciples, then baptized.

Some one perhaps will say that Baptism of Infants is elsewhere instituted,
although not here.

To which is answered, Let he that can, bring forth that institution, and the
doubt will be loosed.

But infants may be disciples, for they may be sanctified by the Spirit?

Answ. It is true, Infants may be sanctified by the Spirit of God, purged by
the blood of Christ, saved by the grace of God, my mind abhorrs from the
doctrine of them that assert, that Infants not baptized, necessarily perish, or
are deprived of the Kingdom of God, nor do I doubt, but that the Elect Infants
dying in infancy are sanctified, yea if it should be made known to us that they
are sanctified, I should not doubt that they are to be baptized, remembering the
saying of Peter, Act. 10. 47. Can any man forbid water, that these should not
be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost as we?

Then you will say [make disciples] in that place, may be so expounded, as that
it may include infants?

Answ. It follows not; but this only follows, that in ease extraordinary, we
may depart from the ordinary rule: But the ordinary rule is, make disciples,
that is, by preaching the Gospel, make disciples, as appears from Mark. 16.
15. and baptize them, to wit, whom you have made disciples, and in the ordinary
course of ministry, we must follow the ordinary rule.

Perhaps some one will except, that Christ teaches that such disciples should
be baptized, but that the speech is not exclusive.

Refut. But it is meet he remember, who shall thus except, if institution be
the rule of worship, it is necessary that he that shall administer the worship,
bind himself to the rule, otherwise he will devise will worship, and arrogate
the Lords authority to himself: Surely the Apostle in the business of the
Lords Supper, insinuates this, when being about to correct the aberrations of
the Corinthians, concerning the Lords Supper he brings forth these words, 1
Cor. 11. 23. For I have received of the Lord, that which I also have delivered
unto you.

Besides as Christ Mat. 19. 4. 8. argues from the institution of Marriage,
against Divorce for a light cause, and Polygamie, because it is said, Two, not
more then two shall be one flesh; so in like manner it may be here argued,
Christ said Baptizing them, and not others, therefore these and not others are
to be baptized.

But as for him who gathers from this place, infants are to be baptized,
because Christ commands all Nations to be baptized, verily he is faulty. 1. In
casting away that restriction that Christ has put.

2. By determining that all men whatsoever are to be baptized, so that this is
not a privilege of believers and their children, but common with them, to all
Infidels and their children.

And in very deed, however assertors of Infant Baptism, crack of a privilege
of believers and their offespring, not only the usual practice of baptising
any little children offered, but also sayings prove, that men have gone far,
not only from Christ's institution, but also from the principles, upon which,
men at this day are busy to establish Infant Baptism. I shall prove this by
some instances. In the 59. Epistle of Cyprian to Fidus, from which Augustine is
wont in his disputations against the Pelagians, to take his proof for
Infant Baptism, and to which Writers attribute much, although that I may say
no worse, without cause, this reason is put, why it was not assented to Bishop
Fidus, who thought that an Infant was not to be baptized, before the eighth day,
according to the Law of ancient Circumcision, We all rather judged, that the
mercy and grace of God is to be denied to none, that is born of men.

By the answer of Augustine to Bonifacius, Tom. 2. Epist. 23. Enquiring
concerning the truth of Sureties, in affirming the unknown faith of little
ones, and promising for them, it will appear to the Reader, that the baptism
of any little ones offered to baptism, is defended by him, Although they were
not brought, that they might be regenerated to eternal Life, by Spiritual
grace, but because they think by this remedy (I use the words of Augustine) to
retain or receive temporal health: John Gerhard, Loc. Theolog. Tom. 4. de
Baptis. Cap. 7. Sect. 4. defends the practice of the Ancients baptizing the
Children of unbeleevers: And the words of Mr. Samuel Rutherford, Scot, in his
Book lately put forth in the English tongue, entitled A peaceable and
temperate plea, c. 12. arg. 7. seems to me to propend too much to this opinion,
The words are these, If then the Jews in Paul's time were holy by Covenant,
howbeit for the present the Sons were branches broken off, for unbelief, much
more seeing God has chosen the race and nation of the Gentiles, and is become
a God to us and to our seed, the seed must be holy, with holiness of the
chosen nation, and holiness external of the Covenant, notwithstanding the
Father and Mother were as wicked as the Jews, who slow the Lord of glory.

And the grave confutation of Brownists, by Rathband, Part. 3. Page 50.
Fourthly, Children may be lawfully admitted to Baptism, though both their
Parents be profane, if those who are instead of Parents to them do require
Baptism for them, and give their promise to the Church for their religious
Education, seeing they may lawfully be accounted within Gods Covenant, if any
of their Ancestors in any Generation were faithful. Exodus 20. 5.

Lastly, if this Argument be not of force, Christ commands first to Disciple,
and then to baptize those that are Discipuled; to exclude Infants from
Baptism; neither will the argument be of force, from 1 Cor. 11. 28. Let a man
examine himself, and so let him eat, to exclude infants from the Lords Supper,
for by the like clusion this argument may be rejected by saying, that the
speech of the Apostle is not exclusive, and is to be understood of receiving
the Lords Supper by persons grown only, yea, verily, neither will the argument
be of force from the institution of the Supper, Mat. 26. 26, 27. therefore only
believers are to be admitted to the Lords Supper. If any reply. But the Apostle
1 Cor. 10. and 11. has declared, that the institution is exclusive, the same
may be said of the institution of Baptism, from the following Argument.

THE third Argument is taken from the practice of the Apostles and John
Baptist, Arg. 3.
which is the best interpreter of our Lords institution, 16. The argument from
John Baptist and the Apostles practice against Insant-baptism confirmed.
from whence the Argument is thus formed:

That tenet and practice, which being put: Baptism cannot be administered as
John Baptist and the Apostles did administer it, agrees not with the practice
of John Baptist and the Apostles.

But the tenet and practice of Infant Baptism being put; Baptism cannot be
administered, as John Baptist and the Apostles administered it, Ergo.

The Major is of it self manifest.

The Minor is proved; Before the Baptism of John even the Jews did confess
sins, the Apostles before baptism did require shows of faith and repentance,
but this cannot be done in the baptism of Infants: The Major is proved by
looking on these places, Mat. 3. 6. Luke 3. 10. Act. 2. 38. Act. 8. 12, 13. and
ver. 37. when the Eunuch had said to Philip, What lets me to be baptized?
Philip answered, If thou believe with thy whole heart thou may; he implies
the defect of faith to be an impediment of Baptism, Act. 9. 18. Act. 20. 47.
Act. 11. 17. 18. Act. 16. 15, 31, 32, 33. Act. 18. 8. Act. 19. 5. Act. 22. 16.

This Argument is confirmed, for if it be rightly argued from 1 Cor. 11. 28
That the Lords Supper is not to be granted to Infants, because self-examination
is pre-required, by like reason we may say Baptism is not to be yielded to
infants, because repentance and faith are pre-required, Act. 2. 38. Act. 8. 37.
and that of those who are descended from Abraham, and to whom the promise was.

THE fourth Argument is taken from the practice of the next Arg. 4.
Age after the Apostles.. 17. The argument from the practice in the Age next
the Apostles against Infant Baptism confirmed.


That tenet and practice is doubtful of which it cannot be proved that it was
in force or use, in the next Age after the Apostles.

But it cannot be proved that the tenet or practice of Infant Baptism was in
force or use in the Age next after the Apostles, Ergo.

The Major is of it self manifest.

The Minor is proved by the testimony of Lodovicus Vives above recited, to
which Vossius in thesibus Historico Theologicis, of Infant Baptism, joins the
testimony of VValafridus Strabo, and by the examining of places brought to that
purpose, and by the continuation of questions propounded to the baptized in
Ages following, and other tokens from Councils and Ecclesiastical writers,
which in Historical business are wont to beget credit.

The words of Walafridus Strabo, who lived about the year 840. in his book de
rebus Ecclesiasticis, Chap. 26. are these, We are also to note, that in the
first times the grace of Baptism was wont only to be given to them, who by
integrity both of body and mind were already come to this, that they could
know and understand what profit is to be obtained in baptism, what is to be
confessed and believed, what lastly, is to be observed of them that are born
again in Christ.

THe fifth Argument: Arg. 4.


That which in succeeding Ages,. 17. The argument from the wrong original of
Infant Baptism, confirmed against it.
in which it was in use, was in force, 1. as a Tradition not written; 2. Out of
imitation of Jewish Circumcision; 3. Without universal practice; 4. Together
with the error of giving Infants the Lords supper, and many other humane
inventions, under the name of Apostolical traditions; That is deservedly
doubtful.

But in some ages after the first from the Apostles, the tenet and practice of
Infant Baptism was in use, 1. as a tradition not written, as appears from
Origin, Hom. on Romans 6. Of which book nevertheless let me add the censure of
Erasmus on the Homilies of Origin upon Leviticus, But he that reads this work,
and the enarration of the Epistle to the Romans is uncertain whether he read
Origin or Ruffinus. And the testimony fetched from these books for
Infant Baptism, is so much the more to be suspected, because Augustine,
Hierom, etc. rely (so far as yet is manifest to me) on no other testimony, then
of Cyprian and his fellow-Bishops in the Council, of which mention is made
Epist. 59. ad Fidum.

Secondly, out of imitation of Jewish circumcision, as the doubt of Fidus, in
the 59. Epistle of Cyprian to Fidus, intimates, though there were also other
reasons of Infant Baptism; as the opinion of the necessity of Baptism to
salvation, and the greediness to increase the number of Christians, and
perhaps the imitation of heathenish lustration of little ones; and some other.

Thirdly, without universal practice: for it is manifest that Constantine,
although born of Helena his mother, a Christian, was not baptized till aged, as
Eusebius in the life of Constantine written by him. The same is manifest from
the book of Confessions of Augustine, concerning Augustine hmself, whose mother
Monica was a Christian. The things which may be drawn out of Theodoret,
Augustine, and others, concerning Theodosius, Alipius, Adeodatus, and many
others (although my books, and notes out of them are wanting to me, by reason
of the injury of the times) unless I be deceived will evince that (though in
the Churches of those times, little ones were baptized, yet) many were not
baptized, whose baptism its likely the Church would sooner have dispatched, if
the opinion of Baptism that now obtains, had then obtained.

Fourthly, together with the error of giving the Lords supper to Infants, as is
manifest out of the book of Cyprian de lapsis, and others. And that many other
Inventions of men under the name of Apostolical tradition, out of a wrong
liking of Judaisme, did then prevail, as the Paschall solemnity, etc. is so
obvious to him that reads Fathers and Ecclesiastical writers, that no man will
need proof, Ergo.

And in very deed, as of old, because the rite of Infant Baptism seemed to be
of so great moment against the Pelagian heresy, and for the authority of the
Council under Cyprian, the Council of Milevis, Augustine, Hierom, and others,
rather then from any solid argument out of Scripture, in former ages,
Infant Baptism prevailed; so in this last age, some modern men seem to embrace
this tenet of Infant Baptism, out of horror of mind, lest they should go
headlong into the pernicious errors of former Anabaptists, and their mad
furies, or lest they should seem to desert the leading men of the Reformed
Churches, or move troubles in the Church; rather then from perspicuous
foundation in the Scriptures. Which they will think that I have not said as one
that dreams, who shall read what Robert Lord Brook has in the end of his
Treatise concerning Episcopacie, Daniel Rogers in his treatise of Baptism, and
others elsewhere.

THe sixth Argument follows: Arg. 6.


That which has occasioned many humane inventions,. 19. The argument against
Infant Baptism, from humane inventions occasioned by it confirmed.
partly by which Infant Baptism it self may be under-propped, partly the
defect in the policy of the Church, which in very deed is to be supplied by the
lawful use of Baptism, Of that it is deservedly doubtful whether it be not
in it self weak and insufficient for its proper work.

But the matter is so in the business of Infant Baptism,

Ergo.

The Minor is proved by instances: they are,

1. The use of sureties in Baptism, which is an humane invention, for a
shadowy supplement, and I had almost said sporting, of that profession of faith
which at first was made by the baptized in his own person.

2. Episcopal confirmation, in which the Bishop lays hands or anoints the
catechized, that Baptism, or the baptized may be confirmed, and they made
capable of the Lords supper.

3. The reformed union, by examination, confession, subscription, of the
received doctrine in the Church, before the communion of the Eucharist, of
which Parker of Eccles. policy, l. 3. c. 16.

4. The Church Covenant, as they call it, before the admission of members into
Church Fellowship, of which the New England Elders in the little book in
English, called Church Covenant, which in very deed are devised to supply the
place of Baptism; for by Baptism, according to Christ's institution, a person
is exhibited a member of Christ and the Church, 1 Cor. 12. 13. Gal. 3. 27.
Ephesians. 4. 5.

THe seventh Argument: Arg. 7.


That which has occasioned many errors,. 21. The argument against
Infant Baptism, from the Errors occasioned by it, confirmed.
that is deservedly doubtful, whether it be right.

But the practice of Infant Baptism has occasioned either the birth or
fostering of many errors, Ergo.

It is proved by instances:

1. That Baptism conferres grace by the work done.

2. That Baptism is Regeneration.

3. That Infants dying, are saved by the faith of their parents, faith of
sureties, of the Church receiving into her lap: which is to be ascribed alone
to the grace of God by Christ.

4. That some regenerate persons may utterly fall from grace.

THe eighth Argument: Arg. 8.


That which has caused many abuses and faults in Discipline,. 20. The argument
against Infant Baptism, from many abuses caused by it, confirmed.
and Divine worship, and Conversation of men, that is deservedly doubtful.

But Infant Baptism is such, Ergo.

It is proved by enumeration.

1. Private baptism.

2. Baptism by women.

3. Baptism of Infants not yet brought into light.

4. Baptism of Infants of uncertain progeny, whom we call children of the
earth and world.

5. They are baptized in the name of the Lord, who know not the Lord, nor have
ever consented, or perhaps will consent to the confession of the name of our
Lord.

6. It has brought in the admission of ignorant and profane men into the
communion of the Church, and to the Lords supper: for who can deny rightly, the
right of the Church to the baptized?

7. It perverts the order of discipline, that first a man be baptized and after
among the catechized.

8. The Sacrament of baptism is turned into a mere Ceremony, yea into a
profane meeting to feast together.

9. Men forget Baptism, as if they were never baptized, so that it has the
force of a carnal rite, not of a spiritual Institution.

10. It takes away, or at least diminishes zoale, and industry in knowing the
Gospel.

THE ninth Argument. Arg. 9.


That is deservedly doubtful,. 22. The argument from unnecessary disputes
caused by it against Infant Baptism, confirmed.
that yields occasion to many unnecessary disputes, f^stering only
contention, and which cannot be determined by any certain rule.

But the tenet or rite of Infant Baptism is such,

Ergo.

It is proved by instances.

1. Of baptizing the Infants of Excommunicated persons.

2. Of baptizing the Infants of Apostates.

3. Of baptizing the Infants of such Parents as are not members in a gathered
Church.

4. Of baptizing ^he Infants of those, whose Ancestors were believers, the next
Parents remaining in unbelief; These things show that men have departed from
the Rule, when they know not where to stay.

THE tenth reason of doubting is, Arg. 10.


That in the midst of the darkness under the Papacythe same men opposed
Infant Baptism, 23. The argument against Infant Baptism from the opposition to
it in the midst of Popery, confirmed.
who opposed invocation of Saints, prayer for the dead, adoration of the
Cross, and such like; This is manifest out of the 66. Sermon of Bernard, on
the Canticles, where of the Heretics (as he calls them) who he said boasted
themselves to be Successors of the Apostles, and name themselves Apostolic,
he has these words, They deride us, because we baptize Infants, because we
pray for the dead, because we ask the suffrages of the Saints, and in his 140.
Epistle to Hildefonsus, Earl of Saint Giles, he complains of Henricus the
Heretic, formerly a Monk, that He took away holidays, Sacraments,
Churches, Priests, that the life of Christ is stopped to the little ones of
Christians, while the grace of Baptism is denied, and they are not suffered to
draw near to salvation.

From the Epistle of Peter Abbat. Cluniacensis, to three Bishops of France,
against Peter de Bruis, and Henricus, holding errors, digested into five heads.

1. That little ones are not to be baptized.

2. That Churches or Altars ought not to be made.

3. That the Cross of our Lord is not to be adored or worshipped, but rather
to be broken and trodden under feet.

4. That the Mass is nothing, nor ought to be celebrated.

5. That the good deeds of the living, nothing profit the dead; That we are not
to chaunt to God. He says, that the heresy of the Petrobrusians was received
in the Cities of Gallia Narbonensis.

And from Lucas Osiander his Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History, Cent. 13.
l. 1. c. 4. at the year 1207. where he accuses the Albigenses as consenting
with the Anabaptists.

To which I add, That in the ages near the Apostles, Tertullian and Gregory
Nazianzen dissuade the baptism of Infants, unless the danger of death happen.
The words of Tertullian are in his book of Baptism, c. 18. Therefore for the
condition and disposition, also age of each person, the delaying of Baptism is
more profitable: Yet chiefly about little ones; for what need that the Sureties
be also cast on danger, who themselves may by mortality be wanting to their
promises, and be deceived by the coming forth of an evil disposition. The
Lord says indeed, Do not prohibit them to come to me; let them come when they
are grown, let them come when they learn, let them be taught when they come,
let them be made Christians when they can know Christ. Why does innocent age
hasten to the remission of sins? shall it be done more warily in things
secular, that to whom earthly substance is not committed, divine should? Let
them know how to ask safety, that thou may know to give to him that asks.

Gregory Nazianzen, in his 40. Oration of holy Baptism:

For which we are to use all diligence, that we miss not the common grace.
Some one will say, let these things be concerning them that seek Baptism: but
what may you say concerning them that are yet babes, and neither perceive
loss, nor grace? shall we also baptize them? Yes by all means, if any danger
urge; for it is better that they be sanctified without perceiving it, then to
go away unsealed or unaccomplished. And the reason of this, to us, is
Circumcision on the eighth day, being a certain typical seal, and offered to
them that had not yet the use of reason; as also the anointing of the posts,
which by things without feeling preserved the first born. But for others, I
give my opinion that they stay three years, or a little within this, or beyond
it, when they may be able to hear and answer some mystical points, if they
cannot understand perfectly, yet being thus stamped, they shall sanctify both
souls and bodies with the great mystery of consecration.

THe eleventh reason of doubting, Arg. 11.
is, Because the Assertors of Infant Baptism little agree among themselves,.
24 The Argument against Infant Baptism, from assertors difference about the
ground of it, confirmed.
upon what foundation they may build Infant Baptism. Cyprian and others of the
Ancients draw it from the universality of divine grace, and the necessity of
Baptism to salvation. Augustine, Bernard, and others, bring the faith of the
Church as the reason of baptizing Infants: Others, among whom is the Catechism
in the English Liturgy, put as the reason of Infant Baptism, the promise of
the Sureties, in the place of the faith and repentance of the baptized. The
Lutherans, the faith of the Infant; others, the holiness of a believing
Nation; others, the faith of the next parent; others, the faith of the next
parent in covenant in a gathered Church. This difference of the maintainers of
Infant Baptism, deservedly causes doubt concerning the thing it self.

THE last, Arg. 12.
and that a weighty reason of doubting is, because Infant Baptism seems to
take away one, perhaps the primary end of Baptism; for many things argue that
it was one end of Baptism, that it should be a sign that the baptized shows
himself a disciple, and confesses the faith in which he has been instructed.

1. The requiring of confession by John Baptist and the Apostles, was wont to
be before Baptism, Luke 3. 10. Act. 8. 35. Act. 16. 31.

2. The frequent manner of speaking in the new Testament, which puts Baptism
for Doctrine, Act. 10. 37. Act. 19. 3. shows this. Beza in his Annot. on Act.
19. 3. The answer is most apposite, in which they signify that they professed
in Baptism the doctrine propounded by John, and confirmed by use of Baptism
with which they had been baptized, whereby they had acknowledged Christ but
very slenderly.

3. The form of Christ's institution, Mat. 28. 19. compared with the phrase as
it is used 1 Cor. 1. 13. Or, were you baptized into the name of Paul? implies
the same. On which place Beza,

The third reason is taken from the form and end of Baptism, in which we give
our name to Christ, being called upon, with the Father and Holy Spirit.

4. That which is said, Joh. 4. 2. He made and baptized more disciples. And
Mat. 28. 19. Going, make disciples in all nations, baptizing them; Intimate
this. And if, as some affirm, Baptism was in use with the Jews, in the
initiating of proselytes into the profession of Judaisme; this opinion is the
more confirmed. But in Infant Baptism the matter is so carried, that Baptism
serves to confirm a benefit, not to signify a profession made: and so one,
perhaps the chief end of Baptism is voyded. And here I think it is to be
minded, that the usual description of a Sacrament, and such as are like to it,
That it is a visible sign of invisible grace; has occasioned the
misunderstanding of both Sacraments, as if they signed a divine benefit, not
our duty, to which in the first place the Institution had respect.

It seems to some, that Infant Baptism should be good, because the Devil
requires Witches to renounce it. Which reason, if ought worth, might as well
prove Baptism of any Infants, Baptism by a Midwife, good; because these the
Devil requires them to renounce, as well that which is of the Infants of
believers, by a lawful Minister. But the true reason why he requires the
Baptism of Witches to be renounced by them, is not because the Baptism is
good in respect of the administration of it, but because the Faith mentioned in
the form of Baptism, is good; and they that renounce not their baptism, do
show their adherence to that faith in some sort, which cannot stand with an
explicit covenant with the Devil. Nor is the assuming of baptism in ripe
years by those who were washed in infancy, a renouncing of baptism, as some
in their gross ignorance conceit; but indeed a firmer avouching of baptism
according to Christ's mind.

This more likely might, be inferred from the Devils practice in requiring.
Witches to renounce their baptism; That the profession of Faith is the main
business in Baptism, which should be before Baptism, if it were rightly
administered after the first pattern.
